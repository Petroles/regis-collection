Acknowledgements

My most heartfelt thanks go to my advisor, dear friend and primary mentor Pro-
fessor Ilson Silveira. My achievements would not have been possible without
his scientific guidance and energetic encouragement throughout the years. I feel
truly fortunate and thankful for having been trained under his phenomenological
approach to physical oceanography and to have been able to make that the core
of my own passionate view of science. Thank you so much for everything you
made possible and for being there for me at all times.

I am deeply thankful to Professor Kenneth Brink, who generously received
me as a guest student at WHOI, and effectively co–advised this research. His
encouraging and inspiring mentoring have helped shape the science student I
am today. I am truly indebted to him for his kindness in receiving me in his
office nearly every day of my time at WHOI, for his great ideas, and illuminating
comments. I also thank him for letting me sit on his Fall course on data analysis
and for encouraging me to present part of this work on a WHOI COFDL talk. My
sincere thanks for making this rewarding experience possible.

I am indebted to many other people at WHOI. In particular, I thank Deepak
Cherian for a great deal of numerical modeling–related help and for great sci-
entific comments and suggestions, as well as other students of the MIT/WHOI
Joint Program. Thanks are also due to Ke Chen for helpful suggestions with the
model implementation and diagnosis. Technical support from the CIS helpdesk
with the WHOI cluster was fundamental in running the numerical experiments.
I also gratefully acknowledge helpful advice and suggestions from Professors
Glen Gawarkiewicz, Anthony Kirincich, Magdalena Andres, Joseph Pedlosky
and Steven Lentz. I am especially grateful to Professor Lentz for the dense and
mind–bending conversations.

A special thanks to the entire WHOI community for nurturing such a wel-
coming and open environment. It makes so much difference. Living next door
(literally) to Walsh Cottage for six months and being able to sit in Summer GFD
lectures freely was not a privilege I could ever have dreamed of when I first vis-
ited Woods Hole in Winter/2012.

I gratefully acknowledge help regarding ROMS momentum balance diagno-
sis from Professor Jianping Gan (HKUST/China), during his visit to WHOI in
Summer/2014 and later.

I Thank Professor Wilton Arruda (UFRJ/Brazil) for providing the outputs
from the HYCOM numerical experiment and for much helpful input on its anal-
ysis. I also acknowledge his comments and suggestions on the simplified ROMS
experiments and on the ATW analytical model.

Thanks to Professor Alberto Piola (SHN/Argentina), for helpful suggestions
regarding the analyses of the observations and for the exciting lectures during
the XIII Austral Summer Institute course ´´Circulation and Water Masses in the
Southwest Atlantic”, held in January/2013 at UdeC/Chile.

I am really fortunate to have had excellent instructors, and it is a pleasure to
acknowledge their dedicated work. In particular, I thank Professors Belmiro Cas-
tro, Marcelo Dottori, Paulo Polito, Olga Sato, Alberto Piola, Kenneth Brink and
Ilson Silveira for teaching me so much. Thanks are also due to Professors Ma?rcia
B??cego and Sueli Godoi for the encouragement throughout my undergraduate
and graduate years at IO/USP.

I am also happy to thank all my lab colleagues and friends from the Ocean Dy-



ii

namics Laboratory (LaDO–IO/USP) for many pleasant sciency and non–sciency
moments. Special thanks go to Ce?sar Rocha, Rafael Soutelino, Herm??nio Foloni,
Filipe Fernandes, Ronaldo Mitsuo, Leandro Ponsoni, Leilane Passos, Ma?rcio Ya-
mashita, Pedro Calixto, Filipe Pereira, A?gata Braga, He?lio Almeida, Gilberto Wa-
tanabe, Dante Campagnoli, Iury Simo?es, Ana Paula Krelling and Tiago Bilo?.

A warm thanks also to my dear friends Hanna Vale, Renato Oliveira, Iole
Orselli, Quek Yew Aun, Santiago Benavides, La??s Farina, Filipe Galiforni, Juliana
Damasceno, Guilherme Castela?o, Bia Melo, Olavo Marques, Natasha Hoff and
Nancy Kazumi.

Administrative support from IO/USP and WHOI is also gratefully acknowl-
edged.

The datasets used in this work come from a number of sources. Despite hav-
ing participated in only one (AMBES 09, October/2012) of the five mesoscale
cruises whose data were used in the present work, I gratefully acknowledge the
hard work done by the crews of R/V Wladimir Besnard and R/V Seward Johnson
in obtaining them. CTD and ADCP data from the AMBES 09 and AMBES 10
cruises was kindly provided by Petro?leo Brasileiro S/A (PETROBRAS). The Abrol-
hos 1, Abrolhos 2 and PRO–ABROLHOS cruise data were obtained from the
LaDO–IO/USP historical database. The World Ocean Atlas 2013 climatological
data (WOA13) was downloaded from https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/
woa13/woa13data.html. The SRTM30–plus bottom topography dataset was
downloaded from http://topex.ucsd.edu/WWW_html/srtm30_plus.html.
The Sea Surface Temperature climatology from the Pathfinder Project v5.0 was
obtained at http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/SatelliteData/pathfinder4km/.
The Multiple–Satellite Blended Sea Surface Winds product was downloaded from
http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/thredds/dodsC/oceanwinds.

Many thanks also go to my uncle Anto?nio, my aunt Cristina, and to my grand-
parents Maria and Jose? for their love and friendship.

Finally, I profoundly and warmly thank my parents Andre? Palo?czy and Cris-
tiane Ortiz for always being there for me, for their loving support, and for the
encouragement and friendship that made this work possible.

2.5 Hydrographic observations in the ESB shelf. (a): Sea Surface Temperature (SST)
summer climatology. (b): Scattered T –S diagram for two contrasting hydro-
graphic snapshots: Cyan (magenta) dots correspond to a scenario with (without)
South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) on the shelf. (c): Near–bottom temperature
map derived from all Conductivity, Temperature, Depth (CTD) casts of the five
synoptic cruises. The black dots mark the locations of all CTD casts. The blue
dots mark the casts shallower than 100 m where the near–bottom temperature
was lower than 21?C (a qualitative evidence of water with high SACW content).
(d): Cross–shelf temperature section from the SEP04 survey (September/2004)
along a transect at the narrowest part of the shelf. The black triangles along the
top of the figure mark the along–transect positions of the CTD casts. The green
dots on the map insert mark the position of the CTD casts within the ESB. The blue
dashed line marks the approximate depth of the 21?C isotherm in a hypothetical
scenario without the Brazil Current (BC). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 26

2.6 Instantaneous maps of the thickness of the layer occupied by intruded water on
the shelf. In red areas, the entire water column is occupied by water that was
located offshore of the 70 m isobath (approximately the shelfbreak depth) in the
initial conditions. In blue areas, no water originally offshore of the shelfbreak
is present. (a,c,e): Smooth topography experiments. (b,d,f): Rough topography
experiments. (a,b): Wind–only experiments. (c,d): Wind + Brazil Current exper-
iments. (e,f): Brazil Current–only experiments. In the wind–forced experiments
(a,b,c,d) the instantaneous fields are shown for model day 8.2, near the end of
the spinup of the shelf circulation. In the BC–only experiments (e,f), the instan-
taneous fields are shown for the last model day (29.6), because the features in
the dye fields take longer to develop. The thick gray lines represent the 70 m
and 1000 m isobaths. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 29

ment. (a,c,e): Temperature and velocity at the surface. (b,d,f): Temperature
and velocity near the bottom. The red arrows in the right column panels indi-
cate preferential pathways of onshore flow. The gray lines mark the 70 m and
1000 m isobaths. For clarity, every tenth (second) vector is drawn in the upper
and middle rows (bottom row). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 32

topography experiments. (a,b,c): EXP–smoo–1 (wind–only). (d,e,f): EXP–smoo–
3 (wind+BC). (g,h,i): EXP–smoo–2 (BC–only). The left, middle and right columns

pressure gradient force (AGEOy?) and the net momentum advection term (NLy?).
(a): EXP–smoo–1 (wind–only). (b): EXP–smoo–2 (BC–only). The heavy black
line is the zero contour. The smallest residues are found away from the Ekman
layers, within the nearly frictionless interior (areas indicated by the horizontal
dashed lines). The markers labelled 1–5 along the x–axis of the top panel indi-
cate along–isobath locations, which correspond to the dots on the map insert. . . 37

2.12 Run–averaged along–isobath residue between the along–isobath ageostrophic
pressure gradient force (AGEOy?) and the vertical viscosity term (VVISy?). (a):

which are indicated by the blue arrows on the map insert. The vertical lines la-
belled 1–5 indicate along–isobath locations, which correspond to the numbered
dots on the map insert. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 40

pressure gradient force per unit mass (?Py?), Coriolis acceleration (?fU) and
cross–isobath velocity (U) along the 70 m isobath for the realistic experiment.
The blue shading marks areas of onshore flow (U &amp;lt;0), which are indicated by
the blue arrows in the map insert. The vertical lines labelled 1–5 indicate along–
isobath locations, which correspond to the numbered dots on the map insert. . . 41

sure gradient force per unit mass (?Py?, a,c) and Coriolis acceleration (?fU, b,d)
for the smooth topography scenarios. (a,b): EXP–smoo–1 (wind–only). (c,d):
EXP–smoo–2 (BC–only). The thick gray lines represent the 70 m and 1000 m iso-
baths. The color scale is the same for all panels and the heavy black line is the

2.16 Model histories showing the effect of pycnocline uplifting by the BC. (a): Com-
parison of the model minimum shelf SST histories (on the TB area) for EXP–
smoo–1 (wind–only), EXP–smoo–2 (BC–only) and EXP–smoo–3 (wind+BC) ex-
periments. The black dashed line indicates the observed climatological mini-
mum SST (see Figure 2.5a). (b): Comparison of the model shelf–averaged in-
truded dye volume histories (on the TB area) for the same experiments. The
dashed lines are linear least–squares fits, and their slopes represent the mean
onshore transport of slope water onto the shelf under each forcing scenario. ?
indicates the mean flushing time of the shelf control volume, based on the slope
of the linear fits. The negligible signal of the unforced scenario (solid black line)
is a model sensitivity test, whose flow field is exclusively due to numerical hor-
izontal pressure gradient errors. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 45

2.17 Distributions of model velocity (run–averaged and depth–averaged in the up-
per 100 m) and centrifugal acceleration normalized by the Coriolis acceleration,
Rocurv = V/(fR). (a): Streamlines for simplified experiment EXP–smoo–2 (BC–
only). The red line is the 100 m isobath, used to perform the Rocurv calcula-
tions. (b): Associated along–isobath velocity (blue) and curvature Rossby num-
ber Rocurv as functions of latitude. The red arrows indicate areas of large curva-
ture effects, which are found mostly where the along–isobath flow encounters
sharp changes in isobath orientation. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 47

ertial frequency, Ro= |?/f|, demonstrating the proneness of shelf edge locations
to the effect of shelf encroaching of the BC. (a,b,c,d): Examples of observation–
derived cross–transect velocity (a,c) and Ro (b,d) along two transects occupied
in the OCT12 survey. The red lines on the map inserts indicate the location of the

velocity (white streamlines) and Ro (color shading) from the realistic Hybrid Co-
ordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) simulation. the gray lines are the 30 m and 200
m isobaths. The arrows indicate areas of large relative vorticity, located mostly
around the shelf edge, following the inshore lobe of the BC jet. . . . . . . . . . 48

2.19 Schematic representation of a single–layer reduced gravity model for the BC.
(a): Geometry of the model, showing the cross–shelf (x), along–shelf (y) and
vertical (z) coordinate axes, the variable thickness of the upper layer (h) and the
densities of the upper (?1) and lower (?2) layers. (b): Schematic representation of
an equatorward along–shelf pressure gradient force (PGFy) linked to an along–
shelf gradient in the upper layer thickness induced by the planetary ?–effect. . . 51

2.20 Climatological thermocline depth estimated from the World Ocean Atlas 2013
(WOA13) dataset. (a): Depth of the 1025.7 kg m?3 isopycnal (black contours),
chosen as representative of the main thermocline. The red arrows indicate the
hypothetical south and north ends of the reduced gravity model. The magenta
contours are the 100 m and 200 m isobaths. (b): Horizontal map of number of ob-
servations at the depth of the 1025.7 kg m?3 isopycnal within each 0.25?square.

2.21 Schematic representation of the proposed South Atlantic Central Water (SACW)
intrusion pathways and physical mechanisms in the Esp??rito Santo Basin (ESB).
The solid black arrow indicates the direction of prevailing wind and shelf mean
flow. The wiggly arrow indicates the direction of propagation of long Coastal
Trapped Waves (Coastal Trapped Waves (CTWs)). The thick red line indicates the
BC flow along the shelf edge and areas of local inertial overshooting. The blue
arrows indicate preferential pathways for SACW intrusions. The dashed blue
arrow indicates the possible pathway along the southern flank or the Abrolhos
Bank (AB). The long (short) dashed black arrows over the shelf indicate areas of
stronger (weaker) onshore flow. The green arrow indicates the direction of the
total time–mean along–isobath pressure gradient force (PGFy?) on the shelf. . . 54

3.1 Numerical time–averaged (30 days) depth–averaged along–isobath Pressure Gra-
dient Force (PGF) at the shelf edge (70 m isobath) as a function of along–isobath
distance. Each line represents a numerical solution for a different Brazil Current
(BC) core velocity. The gray dashed line is a least–squares sinusoidal fit rep-
resenting the idealized forcing prescribed at the shelf edge of the Arrested To-
pographic Wave (ATW) model. The vertical lines labelled 1–4 indicate along–
isobath locations, which correspond to the numbered dots on the map insert. . . 62

3.2 Solution to the Arrested Topographic Wave problem (Equation 3.16). (a): Pres-
sure p(x,y). (b): Streamlines. The red bar in the lower right corner indicates the
cross–shore length scale of deep–ocean influence

?

Abstract

The intrusion pathways and physical mechanisms associated with intrusions of
cold, nutrient–rich South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) onto the continental
shelf of the Esp??rito Santo Basin (ESB), off southeast Brazil (18?S–22?S), are in-
vestigated. The approach consists of analyses of a set of simplified, process–
oriented, primitive–equation numerical models supported by the analyses of an
independent, more realistic numerical model and available observations. The
cross–isobath circulation is found to be strongly dominated by wind–driving,
consistent with previous findings. In the model experiments, SACW enters the
ESB shelf through two preferential pathways along the Tubara?o Bight area (TB,
19.5?S–22?S). These pathways are found to be locations where an equatorward
along–isobath pressure gradient force (PGFy?) of ? 2 × 10?6 m s?2 develops
in response to steady wind forcing. This equatorward PGFy? is essentially in
geostrophic balance, and therefore induces onshore flow across the shelf edge
and most of the shelf proper. The Brazil Current (BC) imparts an additional equa-
torward PGFy? on the shelf. The momentum budget reveals that the ageostrophic
residue of the PGFy? is compensated mostly by momentum advection and bottom
friction. Buoyancy arrest might be important under more intense SACW intru-
sion events, as suggested by the maximum observed values of the slope Burger
number (0.32–0.92). Among the deep–ocean forcing mechanisms considered, the
intrinsic pycnocline uplifting effect of the BC seems to be responsible for ?1.4?C
colder upwelled water under steady, upwelling–favorable wind forcing, relative
to a flat stratification scenario. The BC also seems to induce local intrusions by in-
ertially overshooting the shelf edge, consistent with Rossby numbers of ?0.3–0.5,
as estimated for the area along the TB shelf edge. Finally, the planetary ?–effect
is also related to a background equatorward PGFy?.

In addition, the steady response of the continental shelf to a periodic (in the
along–shelf direction) pressure forcing at the shelf edge is compared with the BC–
forced primitive–equation numerical solutions. A simple Arrested Topographic
Wave (ATW) analytical model is found to be successful in representing the gen-
eral features of the numerical solutions. The cross–shelf e–folding scales of the
cross–shelf velocity estimated from the numerical solutions agree in order of
magnitude with the cross–shelf penetration scale q?1 =

predicted by the ATW, where r is a linear bottom resistance parameter, l is the
along–shelf wavenumber of the forcing at the shelf edge, f is the Coriolis param-
eter and s is the bottom slope. Furthermore, the use of quadratic bottom stress
accounts for some of the relative increase in the numerical onshore penetration
scales, which are predicted to be q?1quadratic =

tum revela que o res??duo ageostro?fico da PGFy? e? balanceado principalmente pela
advecc?a?o de momentum e pelo atrito de fundo. O mecanismo de desligamento da

Chapter 1

Introduction to the thesis

1.1 On the thesis structure

The core of this thesis is composed of two chapters written in the form of self–

contained manuscript drafts (Chapters 2 and 3), in which the pathways and the

associated physical mechanisms of South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) intru-

sions in the Esp??rito Santo Basin (ESB, 18?S–22?S) are investigated. In the present

Chapter, a brief regional overview of the western boundary of the South Atlantic

Subtropical gyre is given in Section 1.2, followed by a statement of the dynamical

constraints involved in cross–isobath flow in Section 1.3. The thesis hypotheses

and objectives are posed in Section 1.4. Chapter 4 Summarizes the main find-

ings of Chapters 2 and 3 and presents some of the open questions that could be

addressed by future work.

1.2 Regional overview

The region of interest of this thesis is located in the western South Atlantic, in

the western boundary of the anticyclonic large–scale feature known as the South

Atlantic Subtropical Gyre (SASG, Figure 1.1). The SASG extends from the surface

down to the base of the pycnocline, in the upper ?1000 m of the water column. Its

eastern and western boundary currents are the Benguela Current and the Brazil

Current (BC), respectively. The quasi–zonal flows of the South Atlantic Current



2

and the South Equatorial Current (SEC) connect the eastern and western bound-

aries of the SASG (e.g., Talley et al., 2011). The SASG encompasses the latitude band

between ?10?S and ?40?S, decreasing in meridional extent with increasing depth

due to the southward shift of the SEC transport (Schmid, 2014).

As the western boundary current of the SASG, the BC flows poleward in the

form of a Sverdrup return transport, analogous to e.g., the Gulf Stream in the

North Atlantic or the East Australian Current (EAC) in the South Pacific. The BC

forms where the southern branch of the SEC impinges on the continental margin

of South America. The bifurcation of the SEC has, however, a complicated depth

dependence. At surface levels, in the domain of the Tropical Water (TW), the SEC

bifurcates in the latitude range 13?S–17?S. At pycnocline levels, in the domain

of the South Atlantic Central Water (SACW), the bifurcation is located climato-

logically at ?18.6?S (Figure 1.2, Stramma &amp;amp; England, 1999; Rodrigues et al., 2007;

Schmid, 2014). As a result of this southward shift of the bifurcation with depth,

the BC thickens downstream, increasing its vertical extension from 350 m at 22.7?S

to 850 m at 27.9?S (Rocha et al., 2014).

The Esp??rito Santo Basin (ESB) is located in the northernmost part of the South-

east Sector (20?S–28?S) of the Brazil Current System, close to the pycnoclinic bi-

furcation latitude of the SEC. In this region, the BC has a conspicuous mesoscale

activity, with semi–permanent eddies steered by the complex regional topogra-

phy (Soutelino et al., 2011, 2013; Arruda et al., 2013). The ESB continental shelf is

located in the coastal domain known as the Abrolhos–Campos Region (ACR, Cas-

tro &amp;amp; Miranda, 1998). In the archetypal coastal regime classification of Loder et al.

(1998), the ESB shelf is as narrow, wind–driven shelf, with a Western Boundary

Current at its edge. This type of shelf is usually expected to be oligotrophic,

in contrast to the eutrophic eastern boundary coastal upwelling systems (Walsh,

1988). However, local areas of high biological productivity are known to exist

(e.g., Gaeta et al., 1999), and seasonal coastal upwelling of nutrient–rich SACW has

long been observed in this region, mostly from satellite data (e.g., Schmid et al.,

1995; Rodrigues &amp;amp; Lorenzzetti, 2001; Castela?o &amp;amp; Barth, 2006; Castela?o, 2012; Mazzini



3

&amp;amp; Barth, 2013).

Historically, the neighboring coastal upwelling system of Cape Frio (23?S) has

received far more scientific attention (e.g., Allard, 1955; Em??lsson, 1961; Ikeda et al.,

1976; Carbonel, 2003; Franchito et al., 2008). Although there has been some recent

development on the understanding of the coastal kinematics and dynamics of

the ESB on the basis of observations and analytical models (Mazzini &amp;amp; Barth, 2013)

and primitive–equation numerical models (Aguiar et al., 2014), numerous basic

questions remain. For instance, (i) Through which pathways does SACW enter the

shelf in the ESB? and (ii) What are the driving physical mechanisms of these intrusions,

and more specifically what are the effects of bottom topography, wind–driving and the

BC? This thesis addresses these questions. An answer to (i) can contribute to the

basic description of the regional hydrography, whereas as answer to (ii) is key

in the understanding of the coastal dynamics and of the coupling of the coastal

ocean and the deep–ocean.

1.3 The Taylor–Proudman constraint

The dynamical basis for understanding the mechanisms involved in exchange

between the deep–ocean and the continental shelf are embodied in the Taylor–

Proudman constraint. In this section, we follow the reasoning in Brink (1998) to

arrive at this well–known result.

Assuming that the flow is steady, linear and inviscid, and that the meridional

scale of the flow is not too large, the equations of motion under the hydrostatic

and Boussinesq approximations are

Current System, approximately at the bifurcation latitude of the SEC at pycnocline levels. Cour-

displacement of the free–surface is negligible (i.e., the rigid–lid approximation)

translates into

w = 0 at z = 0 (1.3a)

w = ?u ·?h at z = ?h, (1.3b)

where ?? x??x + y??y is the horizontal gradient operator and u ? x?u + y?v is the

horizontal velocity vector. Combining the surface boundary condition (Equa-

tion 1.3a) with Equation 1.2 implies that w = 0 everywhere, such that Equa-

tion 1.3b becomes

u ·?h = 0 at z = ?h. (1.4)

Equation 1.4 says that there must be no flow against the topography at the bot-

tom, or, equivalently, that bottom flow is constrained to always following iso-

baths. Differentiating Equations 1.1a and 1.1b with respect to z gives

or, equivalently,

z? · (u×uz) = 0, (1.8)

where z? is the unit vector in the vertical direction. Equation 1.8 demonstrates that

vertical shear in steady, linear, inviscid flow on an f–plane is always parallel to

the flow1, and flow is constrained to following isobaths, as stated by Equation 1.4.

Therefore, relaxing any of the four assumptions made here leads to deviations

from geostrophy and in turn to cross–isobath transport. This result holds both in

the homogeneous and stratified cases, meaning that the existence of stratification

alone is not related to cross–isobath flow.

1.4 Thesis hypotheses and objectives

In Chapter 2, we test the hypothesis that The Esp??rito Santo Basin continental shelf is

wind–driven at lowest order and modulated by multiple deep–ocean forcing mechanisms

linked to the Brazil Current at next order. Specifically, the objectives of Chapter 2

are:

• To characterize the hydrography of the South Atlantic Central Water (SACW)

intrusion phenomenon in the Esp??rito Santo Basin (ESB);

1An exception is when u = 0 at some level, in which case the flow can decouple, allowing
geostrophic flow above the depth of no motion to cross isobaths.



8

• To model the effects of bottom topography, wind forcing and the Brazil Cur-

rent on the SACW intrusions in the ESB;

• To develop a physical understanding of the SACW intrusions in the ESB

from kinematic and dynamical standpoints;

• To examine the momentum budget of the system in the along–isobath direc-

tion and to evaluate leading–order balances and hence cross–isobath trans-

port mechanisms;

• To rationalize the core physics contained in the observations and numerical

models in terms of simpler conceptual and analytical models.

To pursue these objectives, process–oriented, simplified, primitive–equation

numerical models are used in concert with a more complete numerical model,

available observations and simple theoretical ideas.

In Chapter 3, we further examine the response of the ESB shelf to deep–ocean

forcing. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that the time–mean response of the ESB

shelf circulation to the Brazil Current forcing at the shelf edge can be rationalized in terms

of a modified form of the classic Arrested Topographic Wave model (Csanady, 1978). The

objectives of Chapter 3 are:

• To derive a simple modified form of the original Arrested Topographic Wave

(ATW) model that includes periodic forcing at the shelf edge and

• To compare the theoretical predictions from the modified ATW model with

simplified numerical solutions for the ESB, in particular with respect to the

onshore extent of the Brazil Current influence.

The analytical ATW model and a subset of the simplified numerical solutions

discussed in Chapter 2 are combined to fulfill these objectives.

Pathways and mechanisms of

offshore water intrusions on the

Esp??rito Santo Basin (18?S–22?S,

Brazil)

Abstract

The intrusion pathways and physical mechanisms associated with intrusions of
cold, nutrient–rich South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) onto the continental
shelf of the Esp??rito Santo Basin (ESB), off southeast Brazil (18?S–22?S), are in-
vestigated. The approach consists of analyses of a set of simplified, process–
oriented, primitive–equation numerical models supported by the analyses of an
independent, more realistic numerical model and available observations. The
cross–isobath circulation is found to be strongly dominated by wind–driving,
consistent with previous findings. In the model experiments, SACW enters the
ESB shelf through two preferential pathways along the Tubara?o Bight area (TB,
19.5?S–22?S). These pathways are found to be locations where an equatorward
along–isobath pressure gradient force (PGFy?) of ? 2 × 10?6 m s?2 develops
in response to steady wind forcing. This equatorward PGFy? is essentially in
geostrophic balance, and therefore induces onshore flow across the shelf edge
and most of the shelf proper. The BC imparts an additional PGFy? on the shelf,
which is about half as intense as the wind–driven PGFy? and alternates sign. The
momentum budget reveals that the ageostrophic residue of the PGFy? is com-
pensated mostly by momentum advection and bottom friction. Onshore bottom
Ekman transport does not seem to have important leading–order effects, possi-
bly due to buoyancy arrest under more intense SACW intrusion events, as sug-
gested by the maximum observed values of the slope Burger number (0.32–0.92).
Among the deep–ocean forcing mechanisms considered, the intrinsic pycnocline



10

uplifting effect of the BC seems to be responsible for ?1.4?C colder upwelled wa-
ter under steady, upwelling–favorable wind forcing, relative to a flat stratification
scenario. The BC also seems to induce local intrusions by inertially overshooting
the shelf edge, consistent with Rossby numbers of ?0.3–0.5, as estimated for the
area along the TB shelf edge. Finally, the planetary ?–effect is also related to a
background equatorward PGFy?.

2.1 Introduction

The Esp??rito Santo Basin (ESB) is located in the western boundary of the South

Atlantic, within the Abrolhos–Campos Region (ACR, Castro &amp;amp; Miranda, 1998),

slightly to the south of the latitude at which the southern branch of the South

Equatorial Current bifurcates, originating the Brazil Current (BC). At surface lev-

els (0–200 m), within the domain of the warm and oligotrophic Tropical Water

(TW), the bifurcation site migrates seasonally in the 13–17?S range. At 200 m,

within the domain of the cold and eutrophic South Atlantic Central Water (SACW),

the bifurcation takes place climatologically at 18.6?S, slightly to the north of the

Vito?ria–Trindade Ridge (Figure 2.1, Stramma &amp;amp; England, 1999; Rodrigues et al.,

2007).

At mesoscales, offshore of the shelfbreak, the ESB is dominated by a rich eddy

field. According to Soutelino et al. (2011), three semi-permanent anticyclones oc-

cupy the surroundings of the Abrolhos Bank (AB, Figure 2.2). Furthermore, to

the south of the VTR there is a transient cyclonic perturbation of the BC, known as

the Vito?ria Eddy (VE, Schmid et al., 1995; Arruda et al., 2013). This scenario reveals

a complex oceanic circulation in the ESB, which can be expected to be a possi-

ble forcing to the SACW intrusions onto the continental shelf. As pointed out by

Soutelino et al. (2013), the presence of cyclones or anticyclones could lead to dif-

ferent patterns of ocean–shelf exchange. Hereafter, SACW will be taken to mean

relatively colder and fresher water on the shelf (compared to the warmer and

saltier TW).

On the continental shelf, the main forcing in the banks area is the wind, which



11

is southwestward year–round, producing southwestward currents (Figure 2.2).

Along–shelf current variability in the middle shelf is mostly driven by the wind

in the subinertial band, and cross–shelf current variability in the middle shelf is

mostly tidally–induced (Castro et al., 2013). In the inner shelf, the along–shelf

circulation is mostly driven by the subinertial along–shelf winds (Teixeira et al.,

2013). Shelfbreak upwelling induced by internal tides seems to be important

along the southern flank of the AB (Pereira et al., 2005), possibly contributing to

the observed local nutrient enrichment (Gaeta et al., 1999). North of the VTR, the

newly–formed BC flows offshore, and has little effect on the shelf circulation. In

contrast, to the south of 19?S, this current is well–defined and follows the shelf

edge closely (Castro &amp;amp; Miranda, 1998). For example, Miranda &amp;amp; Castro (1982) have

observed a BC transport of ?1 Sv (Sv?106m3s?1) inshore of the shelfbreak at 19?S.

Coastal waters between the AB and Cape Sa?o Tome? are dominated by the in-

fluence of the warm and salty TW year–round. In the AB, the TW occupies most

of the volume of the continental shelf. To the south of the AB (21?S), the influ-

ence of the relatively colder and fresher SACW close to the bottom is intermittent.

Such influence is most intense in summer, when a strong seasonal thermocline

is established in response to the penetration of this oceanic water mass onto the

continental shelf (Castro &amp;amp; Miranda, 1998).

The first study to consider the dynamics of the coastal circulation under steady

wind forcing in the ESB was carried out by Rodrigues &amp;amp; Lorenzzetti (2001). The au-

thors addressed the effects of coastline geometry and bottom topography on the

coastal circulation, using a set of three process–oriented experiments with a two–

layer numerical model. They suggest that bottom topography is more important

than coastline geometry in controlling the time–averaged coastal upwelling re-

sponse in the Tubara?o Bight (TB) area (19.5?S–22?S). The more simplified analyti-

cal approach employed by Mazzini &amp;amp; Barth (2013) further clarified the upwelling

mechanisms related to wind forcing and coastal geometry, by breaking down the

vertical transport into two wind–forced components (coastal Ekman transport

divergence and Ekman pumping) and two topographically–forced components



12

(shear vorticity and curvature vorticity). Specifically, they show that the TB re-

gion to the north of Vito?ria (?19.5?S–20.5?S, see Figure 2.1) is where the Ekman

transport–forced upwelling is a maximum (?0.75 m2 s?1). In addition, they esti-

mate that wind–driven (topographically–driven) upwelling in the TB area is more

than 75 % (less than 25 %) of the total upwelling, with the Ekman transport diver-

gence accounting for nearly the entire wind–driven signal (80–100 %). This also

substantiates earlier results from Castela?o &amp;amp; Barth (2006), confirming that the con-

tribution of Ekman transport divergence is far more important to vertical trans-

port in the TB than Ekman pumping.

Although deep–ocean forcing mechanisms related to the BC seem to be rel-

evant to coastal upwelling south of the ESB (Calado et al., 2010; Palo?czy et al.,

2014), their effects within the ESB have only recently been examined in the study

by Aguiar et al. (2014). The authors performed diagnostic analyses of a realis-

tic primitive–equation numerical model to quantify the upwelling contributions

from Ekman transport, Ekman pumping, encroaching of the BC1 onto the shelf

and cyclonic BC meandering2. They found that BC encroaching is generally more

effective than cyclonic meanders in driving SACW intrusions within the TB area.

Aguiar et al. (2014) also point out that coastal Ekman transport divergence is the

most effective forcing mechanism around 21?S, consistent with the previous find-

ings of Castela?o &amp;amp; Barth (2006) and Mazzini &amp;amp; Barth (2013).

The above review shows that much remains to be learned on the SACW intru-

sion processes within the ESB. The aim of this study is to answer the following

questions:

1. Through which preferential pathways (if any) does SACW penetrate onto the

continental shelf within the ESB?

2. What are the driving physical mechanisms of the cross–isobath circulation

on the continental shelf? Specifically, what are the individual and combined

1´´Encroaching” is taken to mean the inertial overshooting of the BC jet onto the shelf as it
encounters a sharp change in isobath orientation.

2Cyclonic meanders produce vertical transport either by uplifting the pycnocline and propa-
gating along the shelf edge of by drawing water from the shelf, thereby producing an additional
return flow.

effects of bottom topography, wind–driving, and the Brazil Current?

The approach chosen consists of analyses of a set of process–oriented experi-

ments with a simplified primitive–equation numerical model, supported by anal-

yses of an independent, more realistic numerical model and available observa-

tions. We first describe the datasets in Section 2.2 and the numerical models in

Section 2.3. Next, in Section 2.4, we analyze the pathways through which SACW

may enter the ESB shelf. We then address the dynamics linked to the intrusion

processes in Section 2.5, and attempt to isolate and rationalize some of the phys-

ical mechanisms involved in Section 2.6. We conclude by summarizing the pri-

mary results and presenting conclusions in Section 2.7.

2.2 Datasets

2.2.1 In situ quasi–synoptic hydrographic and velocity data

The in situ data used in this study come from five quasi–synoptic oceanographic

cruises: Abrolhos 1 (September/2004), Abrolhos 2 (March/2005), PRO–ABRO-

LHOS (September/2007), AMBES 09 (October/2012) and AMBES 10 (May/2013).

Hereafter we will refer to these surveys as SEP04, MAR05, SEP07, OCT12 and

MAY13, respectively. Surveys SEP04, MAR05 and SEP07 were carried out on

the R/V Prof. Wladimir Besnard, while surveys OCT12 and MAY13 were carried

out on the R/V Seward Johnson. The geographic distribution of the Conductivity,

Temperature, Depth (CTD) stations of each survey are shown in Figure 2.3. Hy-

drographic data from the CTD casts were processed following standard proce-

dures (e.g., McTaggart et al., 2010). Velocity data from underway Acoustic Doppler

Current Profiler (ADCP) time–averaged profiles were processed with the Common

Ocean Data Access System (CODAS) software, following the procedures described

in Firing et al. (1995).

Climatological data from the World Ocean Atlas 2013 (WOA13) were used in the

elaboration of the initial conditions of the simplified numerical experiments and

in the evaluation of one of the analytical models. The fields used in this study

are the Temperature (Locarnini et al., 2013) and Salinity (Zweng et al., 2013) aus-

tral summer distributions, objectively–analyzed to a 0.25?grid with 102 vertical

levels.

Atmospheric Administration (NOAA, Zhang et al., 2006). The summer climato-

logical (1982–2008), 4 km–resolution SST field was derived from the Pathfinder

2.3 Numerical models

2.3.1 Numerical and parametric modeling setup

We employ the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS, Shchepetkin &amp;amp; McWilliams,

2005), which has already been successfully implemented in the ESB (e.g., Soutelino

et al., 2013). ROMS is a free–surface, terrain–following coordinate model that



17

solves the primitive equations of motion under the Boussinesq and hydrostatic

approximations.

The west boundary is closed and the east, south and north boundaries are

open. Different forms of radiation/nudging boundary conditions are used for

the tracers and barotropic/baroclinic velocity components. Harmonic (i.e., Lapla-

cian) lateral mixing is used for momentum and tracers. Momentum (tracer) mix-

ing is computed along S–surfaces (geopotential surfaces). A sponge layer with

?15 grid points was used at the open boundaries, where the horizontal viscosity

coefficient AH was linearly ramped from its interior value of 10 m2 s?1 to 100 m2

s?1 at the open boundaries. The vertical viscosity coefficient AV is found at each

time step with the Mellor–Yamada level–2.5 turbulent closure scheme (e.g., Wi-

jesekera et al., 2003). Bottom stress was parameterized using a quadratic bottom

drag law, with a canonical value of CD = 3 × 10?3.

The horizontal grid is rectangular (spanning the 41.6?W–36.1?W, 23.3?S–18.2?S

longitude–latitude box) and has an average resolution of ?930 m. The form of

the vertical stretching curve was chosen such that the spacing of the 50 verti-

cal S–levels was no coarser than 45 m. Bottom topography from an updated

version of the Smith &amp;amp; Sandwell (1997) dataset (SRTM30–plus dataset, available

at http://topex.ucsd.edu/WWW_html/srtm30_plus.html) is used. The

30–arcsecond raw topography data was linearly interpolated to the model grid,

and capped at 1200 m. The topography was then smoothed with a Hanning win-

dow.

The stretching curve, the number of vertical levels, the amount of smooth-

ing applied and the maximum model depth were chosen to bring the spuri-

ous velocities produced by the Horizontal Pressure Gradient Errors (HPGEs) to

a tolerable level, while maintaining a reasonable computational cost and retain-

ing desired morphological features. The optimal combination of grid parame-

ters was that which minimized the quantities ?h/h (Beckmann &amp;amp; Haidvogel, 1993)

and ?z/z (Haney, 1991). These ratios quantify the hydrostatic consistency of the

grid, by means of the maximum steepness of the bottom topography and inte-

18

rior S–surfaces, respectively. ?h/h ? (hi ? hi?1)/(hi + hi?1), where h is the

depth of a grid cell and i is an index in either horizontal direction. ?z/z ?

(zi,k ? zi?1,k + zi,k?1 ? zi?1,k?1)/(zi,k + zi?1,k ? zi,k?1 ? zi?1,k?1) is like a three–

dimensional version of ?h/h. The final value of each of these parameters is the

absolute maximum found after iterating over all grid cells in both horizontal di-

rections.

The effects of the seamount chain (the VTR) and the smaller–scale topographic

features on the continental shelf were examined using two separate grids, differ-

ent only with respect to bottom topography. On the first grid, the topography

underwent the least possible smoothing, with the single purpose of decreasing

the HPGEs. On the second grid, the seamount chain was totally removed, and

the topography was further smoothed to filter out the smaller–scale topographic

features of the continental margin. A comparison of the rough and smooth to-

pographies is shown in Figure 2.4.

Figure 2.4: Bottom topographies used in the simplified model experiments. (a): Rough (real-
istic) topography grid. (b): Smooth (idealized) topography grid. Model grid details are shown
on the right panel, and are identical for both grids, except for the hydrostatic consistency ratios
?h/h and ?z/z.

Flat stratification scenario

The flat–stratification initial conditions were derived from the WOA13 tempera-

ture and salinity fields. First, the summer climatological profiles shallower than

200 m were averaged together over the ESB (22?S–18?S), to produce a rough rep-



19

resentation of the mean summer stratification on the continental shelf. Then, a

rectangular area to the south of the VTR and away from the shelf edge was chosen

to produce a second pair of spatially–averaged T–S profiles, meant to represent

the deep–ocean stratification. The distance to the shelf edge was chosen to be

10 first–mode baroclinic radii of deformation (Ld), with Ld ?40 km (Houry et al.,

1987). This choice was motivated by the desire to represent an ocean approxi-

mately at rest, where the stratification is not perturbed by the signal of a western

boundary current in thermal wind balance. The shallow and deep profiles were

then merged smoothly and interpolated to the vertical model grid at all horizon-

tal grid points.

Brazil Current parameterization

The BC was parameterized using the methodology known in the literature as

Feature–Oriented Regional Modeling System (FORMS, Gangopadhyay &amp;amp; Robinson,

2002). Briefly, FORMS consists of empirically–analytically parameterizing the wa-

ter mass and velocity structures of regional synoptic features (e.g., fronts or ed-

dies) using parameters chosen on the basis of previous observational knowledge.

Within the FORMS framework, we chose the velocity–based backward approach

(Lozano et al., 1996; Gangopadhyay &amp;amp; Robinson, 2002). This approach consists of pa-

rameterizing the velocity field of the chosen synoptic feature, and then deriving

the tracer fields from it. The BC jet structure was parameterized as a surface–

intensified, isobath–following Gaussian jet, using the formulation of Soutelino

et al. (2013). The mass structure (i.e., the temperature and salinity fields) was

calculated from the velocity field assuming that the jet is in thermal wind balance

with the density field. Details of this methodology are found in Soutelino et al.

(2013).

The parameters chosen for the model BC jet are intended to represent the ap-

proximate core velocity, volume transport and geometry (width and vertical ex-

tent) of the real BC as observed within the ESB (e.g., Miranda &amp;amp; Castro, 1982; Evans

et al., 1983; Stramma et al., 1990; Rodrigues et al., 2007; Silveira et al., 2008; Arruda



20

et al., 2013). The transport (core velocity) was -3.2 Sv (-50 cm s?1). The Gaussian

width (depth) of the jet was 80 km (150 m).

Mass conservation was prescribed along the north (incoming flow) and south

(outgoing flow) boundaries, with a variable Coriolis parameter in the thermal

wind relation. No flow through the east boundary was prescribed. The Inter-

mediate Western Boundary Current jet, whose core lies typically at ?800 m (e.g.,

Boebel et al., 1999; Legeais et al., 2013) was not parameterized, under the assump-

tion that it is not a relevant direct forcing of the intrusions of SACW onto the con-

tinental shelf.

Model wind forcing

The steady wind forcing employed in the numerical experiments is spatially–

uniform and upwelling–favorable (southwestward). The wind stress was linearly

ramped to its full magnitude (0.072 N m?2) over a local inertial period (?34 h).

The magnitude of the model wind forcing was chosen based on the time–mean of

the along–shelf component of the wind stress (?sy, parallel to the ?-40.5?coastline

tilt) taken over the summer months (January–March), and averaged over the TB

shelf area. The ?sy series was derived from the time–average of the 1988–2013

daily scatterometer dataset, considering only upwelling–favorable (i.e., ?sy &amp;lt;0)

snapshots. The wind stress vector ~?s = (?sx)x? + (?sy)y? was derived from the

wind velocity vector ~U = (Ux)x? + (Uy)y? 10 m above the sea surface using the

standard bulk formula ~? = ?aCDa||~U||~U, where x?, y? are the unit vectors in the

cross–shelf and along–shelf directions, respectively, ?a is the air density (assumed

to be 1.226 kg m?3) and CDa is the drag coefficient. CDa was parameterized using

the traditional formula from Large &amp;amp; Pond (1981), modified for low wind speeds

according to Trenberth et al. (1990).

2.3.2 Process–oriented simplified experiments

In this study, we chose a process–oriented approach, in which the responses of

the system to different forcing scenarios are diagnosed and compared. A set of



21

semi–idealized numerical experiments was designed to investigate the individ-

ual and combined effects of bottom topography, wind forcing and deep–ocean

forcing. Here, deep–ocean forcing is taken to mean the effects of the time–mean

BC jet, without mesoscale eddies. Specifically, we performed each experiment

with different combinations of the following features: 1) Either flat stratification

(horizontal isopycnals) or BC stratification (tilted isopycnals); 2) Either smooth

(idealized) or rough (realistic) topography and 3) Either no wind forcing or steady

wind forcing.

In this process–oriented framework, we first sought a BC–free scenario with

flat stratification, and then compared it with a stratification scenario typical of an

idealized, mean BC jet. The comparison of the model results in both scenarios

provided insight on the role of the mean baroclinic signal of the BC, i.e., the in-

trinsic uplifting of isopycnals linked to the geostrophic shear of the current, and

other effects related to the interaction of the BC flow with the continental shelf.

Table 2.1 summarizes the set of process–oriented experiments performed.

Each experiment was run for 21 local inertial periods (one local inertial period

?34 h), or ?30 days. Instantaneous outputs were averaged over half an inertial

period. In the following sections, the model fields described are time–averages

of the entire 30–day simulation, unless otherwise noted. The rationale for this

choice is that experiments with the BC develop energetic instabilities along the

continental slope, therefore introducing unwanted time–dependent biases on the

instantaneous fields. This effect was minimized by averaging over the first 30

days of the simulation. The choice of averaging over this amount of time was

motivated by the fact that, in runs where the idealized BC is present, the shelf–

averaged horizontal kinetic energy completes approximately two periods in 30

days (not shown).

2.3.3 Realistic experiment

As an independent verification of our interpretations of the simplified, process–

oriented ROMS experiments, we used outputs from a more complete regional

nested implementation of the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM), orig-

inally analyzed by Arruda et al. (2013). First, the coarser (1?/4 horizontal reso-

lution) parent simulation was run for the entire Atlantic Basin (65?S–60?N) from

1948 through 2009, initialized with climatological fields and forced with monthly

means of atmospheric reanalysis fields. Next, a finer (1?/24 horizontal resolution)

child grid for the western South Atlantic region (54?W–32?W and 34?S–12?S) was

run from 2004 through 2009, forced with the same atmospheric products as the

parent simulation and with lateral boundary conditions derived from the parent

simulation fields. For details, the reader is referred to Arruda et al. (2013).

2.4 South Atlantic Central Water intrusion pathways

In this section, we examine the pathways through which SACW may enter the

shelf. We begin with simple analyses of the hydrographic observations, and then

seek more detailed evidence in the simplified and realistic numerical solutions.

2.4.1 Observational setting

One of the striking features of the ESB is seasonal coastal upwelling. This process

is relevant to the present study because it is well–known that the cold water that

outcrops during coastal upwelling events has a high SACW content. Therefore, in-

vestigating the surfacing of the thermocline in the ESB is likely to provide insight

on the intrusion processes we are ultimately concerned with.

Satellite–derived SST images found in previous studies reveal a SST minimum

on the shelf centered at ?21?S, which is most intense during summer (e.g., Mazz-



23

ini &amp;amp; Barth, 2013, their Figure 5). The summer climatological SST field shown in

Figure 2.5a supports these observations, depicting a signal that is likely the re-

sult of the averaging of transient coastal upwelling plumes. This climatological

plume has a minimum temperature of ?24.5?C, originates at ?19.5?S and widens

downstream, reaching the shelf edge at ?21?S.

The wind regime is, on average, strongly upwelling–favorable. Considering

the time series derived from the daily scatterometer dataset, the along–shelf com-

ponent of the wind stress vector ?sy was upwelling–favorable 80 % of the time

in the period 01/01/2002–09/02/2013. This result highlights the likely leading–

order effect of the wind forcing in coastal upwelling in the ESB. A similar conclu-

sion was reached for the Cape Sa?o Tome? area (22?S), where ?sy was upwelling–

favorable 78 % of the time between 2000 and 2011 (Palo?czy et al., 2014).

The question of how the SACW gets to the coast before outcropping then arises.

Does it penetrate on the shelf locally or upstream (north) of the SST minimum? As

a first attempt to answer this question, a simple analysis of the near–bottom tem-

perature observations was done, as the cold SACW signal is observed roughly in

the lower half of the water column, and is bottom intensified. Figure 2.5b shows a

map of near–bottom temperature, indicating stations where SACW was observed.

The 21?C isotherm was chosen as a tracer for SACW. This choice was based on the

knowledge that the average SST observed during upwelling events within the ESB

is ?21?C (Castro et al., 2006). During four of the five synoptic scenarios analyzed,

SACW was observed at least once at every alongshore location sampled between

19.5?S and 21.5?S. The only exception was the MAY13 survey, when no water

colder than 22.3?C was observed inshore of the 100 m isobath. SACW was not

observed to the north of 19.5?S (Figure 2.5c). The lowest temperature observed

on the shelf was 16.4?C, around the 50 m isobath at the southernmost transect

of the OCT12 survey. Evidently, this result does not mean that SACW never en-

ters the shelf north of 19.5?S. Rather, it suggests that intrusion events tend to be

more common to the south of the seamount chain (the Vito?ria–Trindade Ridge,

VTR), all along the Tubara?o Bight (TB) and the southern flank of the wide Abrolhos



24

Bank (AB).

The scattered Temperature–Salinity (T –S) diagram in Figure 2.5b highlights

the typical water mass structure on the ESB shelf. Warm and salty TW in the mixed

layer interfaces with cold and fresh SACW advected onshore from the oceanic py-

cnocline, with little evidence of a modified (fresher) coastal water mass. This

stresses the point made in the previous paragraph, as the water with highest

SACW content (coldest and freshest) is observed to the south of the seamount

chain (VTR) rather than to the north of it.

The cross–shelf structure of the temperature field in the ESB (Figure 2.5d) re-

veals the well–known presence of the BC jet. The thermocline (and the pycn-

ocline) is uplifted near the shelf edge, and a layer of relatively cold, fresh and

dense water occupies the shelf. There is a variety of possible physical mecha-

nisms related to the BC that may play a role in the intrusions of SACW. Perhaps

the simplest of those is the fact that colder branches of SACW are available at the

shelf edge simply due to the presence of the BC there. It will be argued that this

uplifting of the main thermocline is one of the leading–order deep–ocean mech-

anisms involved in the problem, as previously pointed out for other nearby up-

welling systems such as the Cape Sa?o Tome? (22?S, Palo?czy et al., 2014) and Cape

Frio (23?S, Cerda &amp;amp; Castro, 2014) areas.

Buoyancy arrest and frictional spindown predictions

If along–shelf scales are assumed to be much larger than cross–shelf scales, the na-

ture of the response of the shelf circulation to wind forcing in the low–frequency

band (i.e., days to weeks3) is expected to be dominated by the barotropic mode

when the quantity S2 = ?2N2/f2 is small (where ?, N and f are representative

values for the bottom slope, buoyancy frequency and Coriolis parameter, respec-

tively). Furthermore, the wind–driven flow fluctuations at the shelf edge are ex-

pected to be negligible compared to fluctuations near the coast when S = ?N/f is

small (Clarke &amp;amp; Brink, 1985), meaning that the entire wind–driven flow is trapped

within the shelf and has little effect on the circulation in the shelf edge area. It is
3Synoptic–scale atmospheric systems, in the so–called ´´weather band”.



25

therefore insightful to estimate S from the CTD data.

Table 2.2 shows shelf–averaged (stations shallower than 100 m) values for

each of the five surveys within the TB area. The average bottom slope in the TB

area is ? = 2.3 × 10?3, and a reference absolute value for the Coriolis parameter

is f = 5.1 × 10?5 s?1. S2 varied between 0.10 and 0.85, and S between 0.32 and

0.92. This implies that a significant baroclinic response is predicted throughout

the shelf, and that the low–frequency wind–driven circulation at the shelf edge is

expected to have a non–negligible amplitude. This picture stands in contrast with

regions where S2 is much smaller and the shelf response is quasi–barotropic, such

as the wintertime South Brazil Bight (S2 = 1.6×10?4–1.9×10?2, Stech &amp;amp; Lorenzzetti,

1992), the Sa?o Paulo Continental Shelf (S2 = 2.2 × 10?4–3.0 × 10?4, Dottori &amp;amp; Cas-

tro, 2009)4 or the wintertime West Florida Shelf (S2 = 5.0 × 10?5, Clarke &amp;amp; Brink,

1985). The baroclinic response to low–frequency wind forcing in the TB shelf is

not expected, however, to be as energetic as in other regions, such as the Peruvian

shelf (S2 = 1.10–2.25, Clarke &amp;amp; Brink, 1985; Lentz &amp;amp; Chapman, 2004).

Another implication of the size of S is how effective buoyancy arrest is ex-

pected to be. In a stratified, sloping bottom Ekman layer, cross–shelf buoyancy

advection produces a horizontal density gradient, which brings the near–bottom

along–shelf velocity (hence along–shelf bottom stress) to rest through thermal

wind shear. The absence of bottom stress implies no bottom Ekman transport.

This mechanism is known as buoyancy arrest (e.g., Garrett et al., 1993; Brink &amp;amp;

Lentz, 2010). A rough estimate of the timescale Tbuoyancy over which this phe-

nomenon is expected to occur is given by the quantity (S2f)?1 (Garrett et al., 1993).

For the five datasets considered here, Tbuoyancy varies from 55 h to 7 h, with a

mean value of 15 h. This suggests that buoyancy arrest may happen fast enough

in the strongest SACW intrusion events, where the shelf–averaged N2 is largest,

and Tbuoyancy is shortest. However, a more thorough examination of the potential

importance of buoyancy arrest would have to account for its along–shelf scale

(Brink, 2012).
4The Sa?o Paulo Continental Shelf (?23?S–26?S) is located in the central part of the South Brazil

Bight (?22?S–28.5?S). In fact, Dottori &amp;amp; Castro (2009) applied Clarke &amp;amp; Brink (1985)’s numerical
model to this region, showing that it effectively predicts moored velocity observations.



26

Alternatively, the wind–driven flow may simply undergo frictional adjust-

ment before buoyancy arrest takes place. A first estimate of the frictional adjust-

ment timescale Tfriction is given by the quantity H/r (e.g., Brink, 1998), where H is

the local depth and r is a linear bottom resistance coefficient. Assuming a canon-

ical value of 3×10?4 m s?1 for r, Tfriction is 65 h at the 70 m isobath, and 19 h at the

20 m isobath. Compared to the 7 h–55 h estimated range for Tbuoyancy, it seems that

a combination of buoyancy– and friction–induced adjustment of the flow should

be expected, with the buoyancy effects possibly being more important during

stronger SACW intrusion events.

2.4.2 Model kinematics of SACW intrusions

While the synoptic observations discussed in the previous section yield some

qualitative conclusions on the SACW intrusions, a more detailed examination of

the pathways and physical mechanisms involved require a numerical approach.

We start by looking at the passive tracer (dye) fields from the process–oriented

numerical experiments.

Passive tracer distributions

The dye fields were initialized by setting the dye concentration (in kg m?3) to

be numerically equal to the local depth (in meters) at each grid point. Figure 2.6

presents snapshots of horizontal distributions of the fractional thickness of the

layer occupied by water initially offshore of the 70 m isobath (approximately the

shelfbreak depth). In other words, it shows the thickness of the layer occupied by

water with dye concentration equal to or greater than 70 kg m?3, divided by the

local depth.

Figure 2.6 shows that slope water tends to penetrate the shelf mostly within

the TB area, in agreement with the qualitative picture suggested by the observa-

tions. This intrusion area is active under all forcing scenarios (wind–only, BC–only

and wind+BC), although clearly only wind forcing is capable of driving slope wa-

ter all the way to the inner shelf. The rough topography scenarios show more

irregular distributions, although the overall spatial patterns are similar to those

in their smooth topography counterparts. We therefore discuss only the smooth

topography experiments in the following sections. However, there seems to be an

additional intrusion spot on the southern flank of the AB, which is more evident

in the wind–driven rough topography scenarios (Figure 2.6b,d). This suggests

that some kind of local mean flow–topography interaction process could be rele-

vant there, in addition to the tide–topography interaction mechanisms suggested

by Pereira et al. (2005).

Unlike the wind–driven intrusions, the BC–driven intrusions occupy the en-

tire water column, and are therefore likely to cause TW to penetrate the outer

shelf along with the SACW in certain parts of the TB area. This point is demon-

strated by the slope water layer thickness distributions in the BC–only scenarios,

which are equal to the local depth near the shelfbreak (Figure 2.6e,f). In contrast,

the wind–driven experiments show bottom–intensified SACW intrusions farther

onshore on the TB shelf, followed by a top–bottom slope water layer within the

coastal upwelling plume (Figure 2.6a,b,c,d).

Velocity and temperature distributions

The surface and near–bottom temperature and velocity distributions from both

EXP–smoo–1 (wind–only) and EXP–smoo–3 (wind+BC) show minor differences

(Figure 2.7, upper and middle rows). Both realistically reproduce the shape of

the coastal upwelling plume, as noted by their similarity with the observed cli-

matological SST pattern (Figure 2.5a). The primary difference is that EXP–smoo–3

produces colder SACW intrusions.

The near–bottom temperature and velocity distributions from the simplified

experiments reveal two major pathways of SACW intrusion within the TB and one

in the southern flank of the AB (Figure 2.7b,d). The realistic Hybrid Coordinate

Ocean Model (HYCOM) simulation has a coarser horizontal resolution (?4.5 km)

than the simplified ROMS experiments, and therefore is not expected to represent

the coastal circulation as well as the deep–ocean circulation5. Despite this limita-

tion, some snapshots from the realistic simulation do represent similar intrusion

pathways (e.g., Figure 2.7f).

The model temperature and cross–isobath velocity vertical structures along

the TB shelfbreak are consistent with the dye distributions, in that the onshore

flow occupies the lower half of the water column in the wind–driven scenar-

ios, but spreads throughout the water column and is surface–intensified in EXP–

smoo–2 (BC–only, Figures 2.8 and 2.9). This again suggests that standard cross–

shelf surface Ekman transport divergence may be the lowest order mechanism

responsible for the SACW intrusions in the TB. The maximum onshore velocity

is ?9 cm s?1 and ?7 cm s?1 in EXP–smoo–3 and EXP–smoo–1, respectively, but

only ?2 cm s?1 in the EXP–smoo–2. In both wind–driven scenarios, the max-

imum onshore velocity is not found near the bottom, as classic, homogeneous

Ekman Theory suggests. Rather, it is found at mid–depth (?30–40 m), consis-

tent with the theoretical predictions of Lentz &amp;amp; Chapman (2004) for the parameter

range S ? ?N/f ? 1 (S ? 1 in the estimates for the most strongly stratified cases

observed in the TB, see Table 2.2). In the theory of Lentz &amp;amp; Chapman (2004), this

mid–depth intensification of onshore flow is linked to the divergence of nonlinear

cross–isobath momentum advection. Besides this mechanism, local acceleration

or an along–isobath pressure gradient force can also produce an additional on-

shore return flow.

The maximum onshore velocity is located at the narrowest part of the shelf

(?20?S). It is there that the thermocline is shallowest in both wind–driven scenar-

ios, where water as cold as 22?C and 19.5?C is found in EXP–smoo–1 (wind–only)

5details on the model verification are found in Arruda et al. (2013).



31

and EXP–smoo–3 (wind+BC), respectively. This difference also suggests that the

effect of thermocline uplifting by the BC is important in modifying the source

water temperature, causing colder branches of SACW to enter the shelf.

Another point worth stressing is the qualitative similarity between the cross–

isobath velocity sections in both wind–driven scenarios. The local maxima and

minima in the EXP–smoo–3 scenario (wind+BC) seems to be very similar to the

sum of the EXP–smoo–1 (wind–only) and EXP–smoo–2 (BC–only) scenarios (Fig-

ure 2.8). In fact, the normalized root mean square difference between EXP–smoo–

3 and the sum of EXP–smoo–1 and EXP–smoo–2 is only 7.8 %. This indicates that,

in the shelfbreak area, the total model cross–isobath circulation is almost a linear

combination of the individual effects of the wind and BC forcings.

The cross–shelf temperature distributions further stress the depth–dependent

character of the SACW intrusions within the TB. For both wind–driven scenarios,

the three cross–shelf lines in Figure 2.9 show different regimes. The southernmost

line reflects the well–mixed character of the shelf and the offshore displacement

of the coastal upwelling plume all the way to the shelf edge (Figure 2.9a,d). The

middle line is located at the narrowest part of the shelf, where the maximum on-

shore velocity is found, and where the thermocline is shallowest (Figure 2.8a,b).

In this area, a mature coastal upwelling plume is found at ?8 km from the coast

(Figure 2.9b,e). The northernmost line reveals a clear bottom–trapped temper-

ature front, but no coastal upwelling plume. The intrusions in EXP–smoo–2

(BC–only) are also consistent with the interpretation suggested by the dye dis-

tributions. No upwelling plume develops, and the uplift of the isotherms in the

bottom–trapped temperature front is much gentler than in the wind-driven sce-

narios (Figure 2.9g,h,i).

2.5 Along–isobath momentum balance

At this point we have presented evidence that SACW tends to enter the ESB shelf

at preferential along–shelf locations. But what are the physical mechanisms in-

volved? We begin to address this question by examining the momentum budget

in the simplified numerical solutions.

2.5.1 Depth–dependent momentum balance along the shelf edge

First, we locally rotate each of the momentum balance terms to an isobath–follow-

ing coordinate system, using the procedure described in Gan et al. (2009). In this

new coordinate system, y?? (x??) is the along–isobath (cross–isobath) direction. y??

(x??) is positive equatorward (offshore). The rationale for using this transformed

framework of reference is that it is a more exact approach to the study of flows

that deviate from geostrophy and transport mass across isobaths, breaking the

Taylor–Proudman constraint. The along–isobath component of the momentum

budget, with pressure in kinematic units (i.e., divided by the Boussinesq reference

tum balance relates directly to the cross–isobath circulation, and geostrophy was

found to dominate the cross–isobath momentum balance in all experiments, as

consistently supported by observational evidence for the subtidal mean flow on



35

most continental shelves (e.g., Lentz &amp;amp; Chapman, 2004, and references therein).

For these reasons, only the along–isobath momentum balance is discussed here.

In addition, due to the similarity between the wind+BC experiment (EXP–smoo–

3) and the wind–only experiment (EXP–smoo–1), we restrict ourselves to com-

paring results from the wind–only (EXP–smoo–1) and BC–only (EXP–smoo–2)

experiments.

Along the 70 m isobath (approximately the shelfbreak depth), there are areas

where PGFy? is positive (i.e., equatorward, Figure 2.10). Part of this equatorward

PGFy? gives rise to a geostrophically–balanced onshore flow, which has been

found to be an important source of onshore transport in many continental shelves

(e.g., Scott &amp;amp; Csanady, 1976; Palma &amp;amp; Matano, 2009; Pringle &amp;amp; Dever, 2009; Gan et al.,

2009, 2013; Xu et al., 2015; McCabe et al., 2015). The PGFy? is surface–intensified

in both EXP–smoo–1 (wind–only) and EXP–smoo–2 (BC–only), and tends to not

change sign vertically. The EXP–smoo–2 scenario features a more clearly periodic

pattern, with alternating areas of equatorward PGFy? (onshore geostrophic flow)

and poleward PGFy? (offshore geostrophic flow). Finally, the amplitude of the

PGFy? in EXP–smoo–1 is greater than the amplitude of the PGFy? in EXP–smoo–2

by a factor of ?3. This proportion is similar to the proportion between onshore

velocities across the shelfbreak (Figure 2.8a,b).

The spatial patterns of the individual momentum advection terms
(

and w?v

)
are qualitatively similar and nearly balance each other (not shown),

leaving a net momentum advection NLy? that is O(10?6) m s?2 or smaller. In

all experiments, the local acceleration (ACCELy?) and horizontal viscosity terms

(HVISy?) are everywhere O(10?7) m s?2 or smaller, which is at least one order of

magnitude smaller than the next–largest terms.

To close the momentum budget, it is helpful to examine the part of the PGFy?

that is left unbalanced by the Coriolis acceleration, i.e., AGEOy? ? ? ?p?y? ? fu.

Within the geostrophic interior, this ageostrophic pressure gradient force is ap-

proximately balanced by net nonlinear momentum advection NLy? (Figure 2.11).



36

Therefore, away from the Ekman layers, the simplified momentum balance is

or geostrophic balance modified by net momentum advection. Considering the

wind–driven case, the combination of this result with the mid–depth position of

the maximum onshore return flow (Figure 2.8a) alludes to the dynamical regime

predicted by Lentz &amp;amp; Chapman (2004) under strong stratification. Within the bot-

tom Ekman layer, AGEOy? is approximately balanced by the vertical viscosity

VVISy? (Figure 2.12). The simplified momentum balance within the bottom Ek-

man layer is then

or an Ekman–like balance modified by the PGFy?. This leading–order balance in

the bottom Ekman layer has been found in other studies (e.g., Palma et al., 2008;

Palma &amp;amp; Matano, 2009). The surface Ekman layer (in the wind–driven scenarios)

appears to have a more complicated balance, requiring both NLy? and PGFy? to

compensate the residue of the Ekman balance (not shown).

The picture that emerges from this model analysis is that of an energetic,

geostrophic leading–order cross–isobath circulation at the shelf edge. The non–

negligible PGFy? at the shelf edge is consistent with the predictions from Clarke

&amp;amp; Brink (1985) for the observed values of the slope Burger number (Table 2.2). At

next order, nonlinear effects and bottom stress seem to be important.

2.5.2 Depth–averaged momentum balance

A question now worth examining is what are the leading–order momentum and

mass balances in a depth–averaged sense. Neglecting the highest–order terms

(local acceleration and horizontal viscosity), the depth–averaged, along–isobath

momentum balance with stresses in kinematic units (i.e., divided by the Boussi-

Along–shelfbreak patterns

We now evaluate the terms in Equation 2.4 to determine what dynamics dom-

inates the flow and the net cross–isobath transport along the shelf edge. Fig-

ure 2.13 shows that in areas of onshore flow the water column is approximately in

geostrophic balance in the along–isobath direction. Momentum advection is the

next–largest term, and is particularly important in the north of the TB (?20.5?S–

19.5?S) in EXP–smoo–1 (wind–only), as the depth–dependent momentum bal-

ance suggests (Figure 2.11a). In both EXP–smoo–1 and EXP–smoo–2 (BC–only)

scenarios, bottom stress is the smallest of the terms considered. Part of the rela-

tive ineffectiveness of the bottom Ekman transport along the shelfbreak may be

due to buoyancy arrest (see Section 2.4.1). The ratio ?by?/?sy? in the wind–only

experiment is 0.12 or smaller, indicating that, along the shelf edge, the offshore

transport in the surface Ekman layer is at least 9–10 times larger than the on-

shore transport in the bottom Ekman layer. Inshore of the shelfbreak, the median

(maximum) of this ratio at the location of maximum onshore flow is 0.37 (0.67),

showing that the contribution of the bottom Ekman transport to the mass balance

increases toward the coast. This range of ?by?/?sy? values agrees with estimates

derived from observations in different coastal upwelling systems (Lentz &amp;amp; Chap-

The depth–averaged balance in EXP–smoo–2 is mostly between the pressure

gradient force, the Coriolis acceleration and the net momentum advection. In

the wind–driven scenarios (EXP–smoo–1 and EXP–smoo–3) the wind stress is

also important at leading order. Simplifying Equation 2.4 using this result, and

multiplying it through by H/f yields

This can be seen as a form of the parallel transport model (Csanady, 1982). The

physical content of Equation 2.5 is that the net cross–isobath volume transport per

unit length (in the along–isobath direction) is a balance between offshore surface

Ekman transport and onshore geostrophic transport induced by the equatorward

PGFy? throughout the water column (with a smaller contribution from momen-



40

tum advection), as shown in the previous section. This depth–averaged analysis

confirms that the leading–order balance is geostrophic–like under the three forc-

ing scenarios, especially in the BC–only case (EXP–smoo–2, Figure 2.13b). More-

over, the previous conjectures on the importance of the model nonlinear cross–

isobath momentum advection (Lentz &amp;amp; Chapman, 2004) are also confirmed.

The realistic HYCOM solution reveals encouraging similarities with the sim-

plified ROMS solutions. Specifically, the time–mean, depth–averaged flow across

the shelfbreak is partly in geostrophic balance, and is onshore at the same pref-

erential intrusion locations suggested by the results presented previously (blue

shaded areas in Figure 2.14). In the areas where the PGFy? is equatorward (i.e.,

preferential intrusion sites), its magnitude is ? 2–3×10?6 m s?2. This magnitude

is comparable to the values obtained in the simplified experiments (Figure 2.13).

The onshore velocities in the realistic experiment (simplified experiments) are

typically 3–5 cm s?1 (1–4 cm s?1).

The net transport across the TB shelf in the realistic experiment (EXP–smoo–3

experiment) is -0.13 Sv (-0.05 Sv). The difference is certainly in part due to the

contribution of more energetic BC frontal eddies in the realistic experiment (see

Arruda et al., 2013 for details), since the BC sought in the simplified experiments is

meant to represent a hypothetical state of the current with minimal eddy kinetic

energy, i.e., least mesoscale activity.

Horizontal patterns

After having examined the momentum budget along the shelf edge, a relevant

question is: Is the equatorward PGFy? also the primary forcing of the model in-

trusions inshore of the shelfbreak? To answer this, we examine the spatial distri-

bution of the PGFy? and the along–isobath Coriolis acceleration in the simplified

experiments.

The onshore depth–averaged flow extends over large areas of the shelf in both

EXP–smoo–1 (wind–only) and EXP–smoo–2 (BC–only) cases (Figure 2.15). These

areas are consistent with the preferential intrusion sites discussed previously. The

arrows on the map insert. The vertical lines labelled 1–5 indicate along–isobath locations, which
correspond to the numbered dots on the map insert.

equatorward PGFy? is partly balanced by the Coriolis acceleration, producing an

onshore geostrophic flow. We also point out that the areas of onshore flow are

roughly the same in both scenarios, once again suggesting that the effects of both

forcings favor the SACW intrusions (Figure 2.15b,d), underneath the surface Ek-

man layer. The normalized root mean square difference between EXP–smoo–3

(wind+BC) and the sum of EXP–smoo–1 and EXP–smoo–2 is 2.7 % and 4.8 % for

the ?Py? and ?fU fields, respectively.

Other studies have shown that preferential locations for offshore water in-

trusions and coastal upwelling may be associated with the combined effects of a

western boundary current, upwelling–favorable winds and shelf geometry. Specif-

ically, Palma &amp;amp; Matano (2009) show that a large area of geostrophically–balanced

equatorward PGFy? forms in their numerical experiments in the South Brazil

Bight area (22?S–28.5?S), producing onshore flow. At the south end of this re-

gion, Campos et al. (2013) show that the combination of intermittent upwelling–

favorable winds and the BC–related PGFy? is a plausible explanation for the ob-

served prevalence of coastal upwelling off a particular location around Cape

Santa Marta (28.5?S). In addition, the cape geometry also has an important local

effect in producing vertical transport through flow–topography interaction mech-

anisms (Mazzini &amp;amp; Barth, 2013). The ESB area also features dramatic along–shelf

changes in shelf geometry and coastline orientation, which have been shown to

be important on a smaller scale by Mazzini &amp;amp; Barth (2013). The present study sug-

gests conclusions consistent with this perspective, as both the wind and the BC

forcings add up to produce onshore motion at the preferential locations indicated

by the blue arrows in Figure 2.15.

One of the effects related to along–shelf geometric changes is that onshore

transport is expected to be enhanced in regions where the shelf narrows in the

direction that long Coastal Trapped Waves (CTWs) propagate (Pringle, 2002). The

downwave direction in the present case is equatorward, and therefore it could be



43

asked whether the sharp change in shelf width at ?22?S has any effect on the pres-

sure (and flow) field at the north end of the ESB (?19.5?S). As shown by Pringle

(2002), the scale of influence Lfric of a geometric perturbation in the downwave

direction (in the barotropic and linear limits) is predicted to be Lfric = (fH2)/(?r),

where H is the local depth and f, ? and r are typical absolute values for the Cori-

olis parameter, bottom slope and a linear bottom friction coefficient. Plugging in

representative values6 for the TB yields Lfric = 360 km at the 70 m isobath. This is

longer than the along–shelf extension of the TB (Figure 2.1). Therefore, we argue

that this effect could remotely set up part of the PGFy? found in the the wind–

driven experiments, and therefore enhance SACW intrusions within the TB.

2.6 Deep–ocean forcing mechanisms

In this section, we attempt to isolate some of the deep–ocean physical processes

involved in the SACW intrusions. We begin by quantifying the change in the up-

welling source water caused by the thermal wind signal of the BC. Next, we

investigate the shelf encroaching of the BC by inertial overshooting. Finally, we

examine the along–shelf pressure gradient associated with the planetary ?–effect

with a simple analytical model.

2.6.1 Pycnocline uplifting linked to the Brazil Current mean jet

Perhaps the simplest mechanism through which a boundary current can influ-

ence coastal and shelfbreak upwelling is by changing the properties of the water

available at the shelf edge. This is just a consequence of the fact that the current

is in thermal wind balance, and therefore the pycnocline has to be either deeper

or shallower (as in the present case) relative to its depth in the Sverdrup interior.

We quantified the change in the upwelling source water induced by the BC

uplifting by comparing the minimum SST histories on the TB shelf in the sim-

plified model experiments. Figure 2.16a shows that both wind–driven scenarios

6f = 5.1 × 10?5 s?1, ? = 2.3 × 10?3 and r = 3.0 × 10?4 m s?1.

undergo a spinup phase and attain a quasi–steady minimum shelf SST. In EXP–

smoo–3 (wind+BC), however, the minimum SST is ?1.4 ?C colder than in EXP–

smoo–1 (wind–only). As wind forcing has been shown to dominate the flow on

the entire model shelf, we argue that the change in SST is mostly a consequence

of the uplifting of colder isotherms due to the presence of the BC along the shelf

edge.

Figure 2.16b shows the evolution of the intruded water volume on the TB shelf

for the simplified experiments. This was measured by calculating the total vol-

ume instantaneously occupied by offshore water within a control volume of 1245



45

km3 in the TB shelf7. Surprisingly, the mean onshore transport in EXP–smoo–3 is

0.10 Sv, 30 % smaller than in EXP–smoo–1. Consequently, the mean flushing time

? is also shorter in EXP–smoo–1 (97 days). In the wind–driven experiments with

realistic topography ? is ?50–60 days (not shown).

It can be seen that intruded water (mostly SACW) eventually occupies ?25 %

of the TB shelf volume, considering a typical volume of 300 km3 of intruded water

on the shelf (Figure 2.16b). South of the ESB, in the northern South Brazil Bight,

SACW has been estimated to occupy a larger fraction of the total shelf volume

(37–56 %, Cerda &amp;amp; Castro, 2014).

We conclude from the present analyses that the amount of intruded water in

EXP–smoo–3 (wind+BC) is slightly smaller than in EXP–smoo–1 (wind–only), but

the minimum SST on the shelf is colder. In other words, total mass exchange is

slightly smaller when the BC is present, but the additional uplift of the thermo-

cline causes the upwelling source water to be colder.

2.6.2 Shelf encroaching of the Brazil Current by inertial over-

shooting

When flow in exact geostrophic balance encounters a change in bottom topogra-

phy, its ability to continue to follow isobaths depends on its amount of inertia.

As it flows along the ESB shelfbreak, the BC is expected to locally overshoot it in

some areas, thereby advecting SACW and TW onto the outer part of the continental

shelf.

This effect is expected to be more important where the curvature R?1 of the

isobaths is large enough to cause the centrifugal acceleration V 2/R experienced

by a water parcel moving with an along–isobath velocity V to become compara-

ble to the Coriolis acceleration fV . The ratio

Rocurv =

cates the observed climatological minimum SST (see Figure 2.5a). (b): Comparison of the model

the shelf control volume, based on the slope of the linear fits. The negligible signal of the un-
forced scenario (solid black line) is a model sensitivity test, whose flow field is exclusively due to
numerical horizontal pressure gradient errors.



47

can therefore be defined to measure the importance of the contribution of curva-

ture effects. Figure 2.17 shows Rocurv along the 100 m isobath in EXP–smoo–2 as

a function of latitude. The mean (maximum) value of Rocurv is 0.02 (0.18), and the

local maxima coincide with the areas of maximum isobath curvature. Away from

the maxima, Rocurv is everywhere smaller than 0.05. The smallness of Rocurv re-

flects the relatively weak mean along–isobath flow represented by EXP–smoo–2,

which is everywhere slower than 26 cm s?1. If a typical synoptic along–isobath

velocity of 0.6 m s?1 is considered instead (as observed during the OCT12 survey,

Figure 2.18a,c), the mean (maximum) Rocurv increases to 0.11 (0.51). Curvature ef-

fects are therefore more relevant in the south and north ends of the TB, especially

when the incoming BC jet is most energetic.

Areas of high relative vorticity ? clearly exist along the TB shelf edge, and a

convenient measure of the relative importance of the total (curvature + shear)

nonlinear effects is given by the quantity Ro = |?/f| (Figure 2.18). It is seen

that both the time–mean realistic model fields and direct velocity observations

indicate typical (maximum) values of Ro of ?0.3 (?0.5), spreading over large

areas of the TB slope and shelf edge. Therefore it seems that it is horizontal shear

(rather than the more localized and episodic curvature effects) that account for

the bulk of the nonlinearities at the shelf edge in a time–mean sense.

The Kuroshio is perhaps one of the best documented examples of the iner-

tial overshooting process (e.g., Hsueh et al., 1996; Ve?lez-Belch?? et al., 2013), with

Ro ? 0.5 (Brink, 1998). The size of Ro estimated in the present analyses therefore

predicts shelf encroaching to be locally important along the shelf edge of the TB.

Off southeast Australia, encroaching of the East Australian Current (EAC) has

been shown to occasionally precondition the water mass field on the shelf with

colder offshore water, which may in turn reach the coast under the influence of

persistent upwelling–favorable winds. This interaction has been shown to cause

more intense coastal upwelling events than the ones observed without encroach-

ing or other favorable EAC–related processes (e.g., Gibbs et al., 1998; Roughan &amp;amp;

Middleton, 2002; Schaeffer et al., 2013). Events when the BC is more energetic are



48

thus probably associated with stronger shelf encroaching, and therefore more sig-

nificant preconditioning of the shelf water mass structure to wind–driven up-

welling.

2.6.3 Meridional pressure gradient induced by the ? effect

Although safely neglected in models of coastal circulation where the f–plane ap-

proximation is valid, the planetary ?–effect is perhaps an overlooked mechanism

in the context of shelfbreak upwelling. In the following we examine the merid-

ional (i.e., along–shelf) pressure gradient force PGF?y induced by the planetary

?–effect. We employ a single–layer reduced gravity model8 as in Charney (1955).

The dynamically active (upper) layer (Figure 2.19) is assumed to be in geostrophic

balance, i.e.,

?fv = ?g?hx, (2.7)
8Also referred to in the literature as a 1.5–layer equivalent–barotropic model.

where f is the Coriolis parameter, v is the along–shelf velocity, h is the upper layer

. (2.11)

Let us now seek a crude estimate of the along–shelf pressure gradient force

at the shelf edge (PGF?y ) caused in response to this effect. We assume that the

BC jet conserves mass (Q = constant) between two along–shelf locations ynorth =

19?S and ysouth = 22?S, and that the offshore thermocline depth ho does not vary

between those locations. Plugging approximate values for Q, g?, ho, fnorth and

fsouth in Equation 2.11 yields

(hc)north ? (hc)south ??8 m, (2.12)



51

that is, the thermocline is predicted to be ?8 m shallower in the north end of

the TB shelf, which is consistent with the existence of a northward PGF?y and an

onshore geostrophic flow across the shelf edge. We may use Equation 2.12 to

estimate the magnitude of this force:

PGF?y = ?g
?
[

(hc)north ? (hc)south
ynorth ?ysouth

]
= 5.6 × 10?7m s?2. (2.13)

This acceleration is comparable to the total pressure gradient force per unit mass

modeled in the BC–only scenario (Figure 2.13b). It drives an onshore depth–

averaged geostrophic velocity PGF?y/f of ??1 cm s?1.

An evaluation of the accuracy of the estimate in Equation 2.12 and the as-

sumption that ho does not vary in the along–shelf direction is desirable. To achieve

this, we examined the thermocline depth distribution derived from the annual

WOA13 objectively–analyzed (OA) Temperature (T) and Salinity (S) fields. The re-

sult does show an ?10 m shallower thermocline at 19.5?S relatively to 21?S (Fig-

ure 2.20a). We point out, however, that an accuracy estimate for this dataset is

not straightforward in this case. This is because the objective analysis technique

used to produce the WOA13 fields does not provide information on the spatial dis-

tribution of the variance of the interpolation error, unlike other objective analysis

techniques commonly employed in the spatial mapping of oceanographic vari-

ables (e.g., Bretherton et al., 1976). In the WOA13 case, the standard error about

the statistical mean and the difference between the OA fields and the statistical

mean fields (OA?X) are the natural measures of uncertainty. However, the anal-

ysis of the thermocline depth distribution derived from the statistical mean fields

of T and S gives rise to another problem. The number of T and S observations

per 0.25?square is so small in the ESB (Figure 2.20b) that the thermocline depth

distribution derived from the statistical mean (and hence the OA?X map) is ex-

cessively patchy (not shown). Due to its statistical limitations, we consider the

OA WOA13 fields only as a suggestive experimental verification of the PGF?y .

2.7 Summary and conclusions

The goal of the present study is to investigate the intrusion pathways and the as-

sociated physical mechanisms involved in the intrusions of South Atlantic Cen-

tral Water (SACW) onto the Esp??rito Santo Basin (ESB) shelf, with emphasis on

the Tubara?o Bight (TB) area. We employ a combination of realistic and simpli-

fied numerical experiments and an analysis of available observations to examine

the effects of bottom topography, wind–driving and the Brazil Current (BC). A

schematic overview of our findings is presented in Figure 2.21.

SACW appears to enter the model shelf through preferential pathways which

coincide with along–shelf locations where a geostrophically–balanced equator-

ward (i.e., intrusion–favorable) along–isobath pressure gradient force (PGFy?) ex-

ists, as consistently suggested by the simplified and realistic numerical experi-

ments. The geostrophic balance in the along–isobath direction is modified by

momentum advection at mid–depth and by friction in the bottom Ekman layer.

Both wind– and BC–forced scenarios are found to produce an equatorward PGFy?.

However, the BC–induced PGFy? is about half as intense as its wind–induced

counterpart (which is ? 2 × 10?6 m s?2), and has a periodic along–shelf pat-

tern, alternating areas of onshore and offshore geostrophic flow. The net effect

is an equatorward PGFy? throughout most of the TB, with local maxima at the

preferential intrusion sites.

Typical magnitudes of the model time–mean, depth–averaged onshore veloc-

ities are 1–5 cm s?1. The dominance of the model onshore geostrophic flow ex-

tends beyond the shelf edge area, apparently contributing to the SACW transport

also on the shelf proper. Estimates of the slope Burger number from the five avail-

able hydrographic datasets yield values between 0.32 and 0.92. The associated

buoyancy arrest time scales suggest that the system might be more likely to expe-

rience buoyancy arrest during vigorous SACW intrusions. The vertical structure of

the onshore velocity at the shelf edge is consistent with theoretical predictions for

S = O(1), suggesting the interpretation that the cross–isobath velocity structure

in the TB is modulated by the intensity of the SACW intrusions.



55

Wind forcing alone is both required and sufficient to reproduce the main fea-

tures of coastal upwelling in the TB. Among the next–order effects, the uplifting of

the thermocline by the BC results in the outcropping of water ?1.4?C colder under

steady, upwelling–favorable wind forcing (compared to a flat stratification, BC–

free scenario). The BC also affects the SACW intrusions by inertially overshooting

the shelf edge, consistent with what is expected for the estimated Rossby num-

bers of ?0.3–0.5 along the shelf edge. Finally, the planetary ?–effect is also found

to account for a background equatorward PGFy?.

It was not our intention to accurately represent the coastal and deep–ocean

circulation of the ESB, nor to develop a detailed understanding of all the physical

processes involved in the problem. Therefore, many open questions remain. Fu-

ture work should be aimed at the effects on SACW intrusions of coastal trapped

waves, internal waves, and the energetic mesoscale eddy field associated with

the BC, among other processes. From an observational viewpoint, additional and

better–resolved quasi–synoptic and moored observations on the middle shelf and

shelf edge areas would allow for experimental testing of the model predictions

discussed in the present study.

Analytical and numerical solutions

for the Tubara?o Bight (Southeast

Brazil)

Abstract

The steady response of the continental shelf to a periodic (in the along–shelf di-
rection) pressure forcing at the shelf edge is compared with primitive–equation
numerical solutions for a narrow shelf in the Tubara?o Bight (TB, 19.5?S–22?S,
Southeast Brazil). The Brazil Current (BC) flows along the TB shelf edge, trans-
porting cold South Atlantic Central Water and imparting a pressure gradient that
was found to extend throughout the shelf in the numerical solutions discussed in
Chapter 2. In this study, a simple Arrested Topographic Wave (ATW) analytical
model is found to be successful in representing the general qualitative and quan-
titative features of these numerical solutions. The cross–shelf e–folding scales
of the cross–shelf velocity estimated from the numerical solutions agree in or-
der of magnitude with the cross–shelf penetration scale q?1 =

?
?2r/(lfs) = 10

km predicted by the ATW, where r is a linear bottom resistance parameter, l is
the along–shelf wavenumber of the forcing at the shelf edge, f is the Coriolis
parameter and s is the bottom slope. The numerical e–folding scales decrease
with increasing forcing amplitude, and are found to be partially within the pre-
dicted range for q?1, especially for stronger (&gt; 60 cm s?1) BC core velocities. Fur-
thermore, the use of quadratic bottom stress accounts for some of the relative



58

increase in the numerical onshore penetration scales, which are predicted to be
q?1quadratic =

?
?2CD/(lfs)×

Ubot, where CD is a quadratic bottom friction param-

eter and Ubot is the near–bottom velocity magnitude. The kind of steady response
to periodic deep–ocean forcing examined here may provide insight into other
continental shelves under the influence of western boundary currents or other
deep–ocean pressure gradients.

3.1 Introduction

Much understanding on the time–mean circulation of the coastal ocean has been

gained with the classic Arrested Topographic Wave (ATW) model (Csanady, 1978).

The simplest forms of this model describe the steady–state response of the coastal

ocean to pressure perturbations imparted by wind, river runoff or deep–ocean

pressure gradients. The effects of the coastal boundary, friction and rotation

combine to diffuse the pressure perturbations throughout the shelf and produce

along–shelf pressure gradients that are in partial geostrophic balance, giving rise

to cross–shelf transport.

Different versions of the ATW model have been used to rationalize observa-

tions and primitive–equation model results. Schlichtholz (2002) showed that a

modified version of the ATW is consistent with hydrographic observations and in-

verse solutions of the near–bottom flow in Fram Strait. Miller et al. (2011) derived

a matched shelf–slope ATW model to rationalize primitive–equation numerical

results obtained by Matano &amp;amp; Palma (2008) in the context of shelfbreak upwelling

in the Patagonian shelf. Miller et al. (2011) showed that quantitative agreement

was found between the nonlinear, stratified primitive–equation solutions and the

much simpler linear, homogeneous ATW solution in their case.

In Chapter 2, process–oriented numerical experiments were analyzed to in-

vestigate the effects of forcing mechanisms related to the Brazil Current (BC) on

intrusions of cold, nutrient–rich South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) on the con-

tinental shelf of the Tubara?o Bight (TB) area (19.5?S–22?S), off southeast Brazil.

With the neglect of wind forcing, the bulk of the onshore transport of SACW was



59

related to a geostrophically–balanced pressure gradient force in the along–isobath

direction, but the actual mechanisms behind the generation of this force were un-

clear. In the present study, an ATW model forced by a sinusoidal pressure field

at the shelf edge is used to rationalize some features of the numerical solutions

discussed in Chapter 2. The modified ATW solution is derived in Section 3.2 and

compared to the numerical solutions in Section 3.3. Conclusions are presented in

Section 3.4.

3.2 The analytical model

We consider the idealized domain of a continental shelf in the southern hemi-

sphere that is infinite in the meridional direction, with a solid coastal boundary

at x = 0. A steady western boundary current flows poleward along the shelf

edge, which is placed at x = L. The current has a periodic structure with wave-

length 2?/l in the along–shelf direction. No wind forcing is prescribed.

Under the long–wave (e.g., Gill &amp;amp; Schumann, 1974) and f–plane approxima-

tions, the depth–averaged equations of motion in the steady, linear and barotropic

limits are (e.g., Csanady, 1978):

?fv = ?
1

?
px (3.1a)

fu = ?
1

?
py ?

rv

h
(3.1b)

(uh)x + (vh)y = 0, (3.1c)

where p is the depth–averaged pressure, u and v are the cross– and along–shelf

depth–averaged velocities, f is the Coriolis parameter, ? = 1025 kg m?3 is density,

r is a linear bottom resistance coefficient and h is depth. A linear cross–shelf depth

profile of the form h = h0 + sx is chosen, with h0 = 0 m and s &gt; 0. Subscripts

with respect to the independent variables (x,y) indicate partial differentiation.

Equations 3.1a–c may be combined into a single parabolic partial differential



60

equation for pressure, i.e.,

pxx +
fs

r
py = 0. (3.2)

As pointed out by Csanady (1978), Equation 3.2 is analogous to the one–dimen-

sional heat equation. In this analogy, p is like temperature, the y direction is like

time, and the quantity r/(fs) is like thermal conductivity but has units of length.

As wind forcing is not included here, the boundary condition of no cross–shelf

flow at the coast (uh = 0 at x = 0) that follows from Equations 3.1a and 3.1b is

px = 0. (3.3)

The boundary condition at the shelf edge (x = L) is chosen to approximate

the sinusoidal shape of the pressure field obtained in the numerical solutions

(Figure 3.1):

p = a sin (ly), (3.4)

where a and l are the amplitude and along–shelf wavenumber of the pressure

field, respectively.

The boundary condition in the y direction is more elaborate. It is analogous

to the initial condition of the heat equation, which represents the initial temper-

ature distribution along a one–dimensional iron slab. In the present problem, it

represents the cross–shelf shape of the pressure field at a known along–shelf po-

sition. The rationale for neglecting this boundary condition is that we do not aim

to study the along–shelf spreading of an arbitrary cross–shelf pressure perturba-

tion like p(x, 0) = ?(x). Rather, we are concerned with the onshore penetration

of a prescribed sinusoidal pressure field at the shelf edge. Defining k ??r/(fs),

the problem becomes

p(L,y) = a sin (ly) (3.5c)

in the domain 0 &amp;lt;x &amp;lt;L,?? &amp;lt;y &amp;lt;+?. Assume a periodic solution of the form

p±(x,y) = ?±(x)e±ily, (3.6)

Such that the full solution is p(x,y) = p+(x,y) + p?(x,y). Then plug Equation 3.6

into Equations 3.5a–c. Using the fact that a sin (ly) = ia

?lfs/(2r), recalling that

k ? ?r/(fs). We note that the e–folding scale of p in the cross–shelf direction

(the real quantity q) depends not only on the conductivity parameter (k), but

also on the wavenumber of the forcing (l). q does not depend on the amplitude

of the forcing (a). It is seen that the distance q?1 scales the onshore extent of

the deep–ocean influence in the case of periodic forcing at the shelf edge. This

result is analogous to that of the periodic along–shelf wind stress ATW problem,



63

where l represents the along–shelf wavenumber of the along–shelf wind stress

field (Csanady, 1978; Winant, 1979).

The choice of parameters a,l,f,s,r and L (Table 3.1) was guided by the nu-

merical solutions from experiment EXP–smoo–21 (Chapter 2) and the approxi-

mate geometry of the TB shelf. Although the solution is meridionally infinite, the

finite shelf length Ly considered here is intended to roughly match that of the

TB shelf. The choice of pressure amplitude a corresponds to a reference ampli-

tude of the numerical pressure gradient force (6.9 × 10?7 m s?2). The along–shelf

wavenumber l = 3?/Ly m?1 is set so as to simulate the numerical shelf edge

pressure field (Figure 3.1). The linear drag coefficient r is picked from a range

that has been found to agree well with observations (e.g., Pringle, 2002). The pre-

dicted cross–shore scale of deep–ocean influence associated with these parame-

ters is q?1 =
?
?2r/(lfs) = 10 km. For reference, the internal Rossby radius of

deformation at the 70 m isobath is Ld = NH/f = 18 km, using the mean N value

for the TB shelf obtained in Chapter 2 (see Table 2.2).

The ATW solutions for the pressure and flow fields are shown in Figure 3.2.

The form of the solution is a mirror image of the solution to the periodic along–

shelf wind stress ATW problem. The alternating high and low pressure centers are

associated with bands of onshore and offshore flow, which cause onshore trans-

port of oceanic water through preferential pathways on the shelf. The flow field

is slanted in the direction of propagation of long coastal trapped waves (hereafter

the downwave direction).

3.3 Comparison with primitive–equation numerical

solutions

We begin with a qualitative comparison between the ATW solution and the nu-

merical solutions from Chapter 2. Figure 3.3 shows the time–averaged depth–

averaged flow field from an experiment with a simplified (smoothed) topogra-

phy, no wind forcing and a BC jet flowing along the shelf edge. The flow pattern

on the shelf bears qualitative similarities with the ATW solution (Figure 3.2), in

that there are closed streamlines and the isotachs are slanted in the downwave

direction.

As a consequence of the periodic nature of the forcing, any quantitative com-

parison of shelf–averaged quantities is highly sensitive to the choice of along–

shelf averaging length (assuming the wavenumber l of the forcing is held fixed).

We therefore compare the analytical and numerical solutions in terms of the cross–

shelf penetration scales. Figure 3.4 shows two examples of cross–shelf profiles of

depth–averaged cross–isobath velocity (u), and the associated exponential fits.

The length scale q?1 =
?

2k/l =
?
?2r/(lfs) predicted by the ATW for values

of the linear bottom friction parameter r in the canonical range 2–5 × 10?4 m s?1

(e.g., Pringle, 2002) is consistent with the numerical results in terms of order of

magnitude.

For a bulk comparison, we averaged all of the fit e–folding scales for each of

the ten cross–shelf lines in Figure 3.3b to obtain a mean value and a standard de-

viation for each BC flow amplitude. Figure 3.5 shows that q has a poorly defined

decreasing dependence on the forcing amplitude, meaning that a stronger incom-

ing BC flow tends to penetrate farther onshore. Predictions for q underestimate

the numerical exponential fits by ?0–40%, with better agreement obtained un-

der stronger forcing. Evidently, the non–constancy of the numerical penetration

scales is partly attributable to the complexity of the primitive–equation model.

Another important source of disagreement, however, is that the numerical so-

lutions use a quadratic bottom stress parameterization, meaning that the equiva-



67

lent of the linear bottom friction parameter r is the quantity CDUbot, where CD is

a unitless quadratic bottom friction parameter (set to 3.0 × 10?3 in the numerical

solutions) and Ubot is the near–bottom velocity magnitude. Physically, this means

that the predicted onshore penetration scale becomes a function of the forcing

amplitude (i.e., the BC core velocity). This new penetration scale is thus

q?1quadratic =

?
?2CD

×
?
Ubot, (3.17)

meaning that the onshore extent of deep–ocean influence over the shelf increases

with the square root of Ubot. Assuming for simplicity that Ubot is proportional to

the BC core velocity, we used Equation 3.17 to estimate the predicted increments

in qquadratic (relative to the first numerical solution, with a BC core velocity of 20

cm s?1) and compared the result to the numerical e–folding scales (Figure 3.5).

ments relative to the first numerical e–folding scale (Ubot = 20 cm s?1) rather than absolute val-
ues. Representative values for the TB are used: Bottom slope s = 2.68 × 10?3, inertial frequency
f = ?5.10×10?5 s?1, and an along–shelf wavenumber l = 4.42×10?5 m?1 for the forcing at the
shelf edge.

3.4 Conclusions

Process–oriented numerical experiments discussed in Chapter 2 revealed a time–

mean periodic pressure field along the shelf edge in the TB area. Here, we pre-

sented evidence suggesting that the steady response of the coastal circulation to

this deep–ocean forcing imparted by the BC can be rationalized as a manifestation

of the physics contained in a simple ATW model. The use of quadratic bottom

stress in the ATW onshore penetration scale expression accounts for some of the

decrease of the numerical e–folding scales, improving the agreement between the

analytical predictions and the numerical solutions. The weak, shelf–wide ?0.2–

1.0 cm s?1 cross–isobath ATW circulation could account for part of the onshore

transport of cold, nutrient–rich SACW all the way to the inner shelf, provided that

other physical processes have already transported it across the shelfbreak (e.g.,

inertial overshooting of the BC). This process could therefore be an additional

supporting mechanism to the more energetic wind–driven cross–shelf circulation

of SACW in the TB.

Final remarks

4.1 Thesis summary

This thesis investigates the pathways of and the physical mechanisms associ-

ated with the intrusions of South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) onto the Esp??rito

Santo Basin (ESB) shelf (18?S–22?S, Brazil) by employing a combination of ob-

servational, numerical and analytical approaches to distill the physical basis of

the phenomenon. In Chapter 2, a set of simplified, process–oriented, primitive–

equation numerical experiments is used in conjunction with a more complete

numerical model and available observations to disentangle the kinematics and

dynamics underlying the SACW intrusions. It is found that wind drives the shelf

circulation at leading order, in accord with previous findings. Preferential path-

ways of SACW intrusion are recognized in the model experiments off Aracruz

(?20?S, where the shelf is narrowest) and in the area between Marata??zes and

Cape Sa?o Tome? (21?S–22?S). These locations are collocated with areas where an

equatorward along–isobath pressure gradient force (PGFy?) consistently forms at

the shelf edge in both the simplified and realistic model experiments. The PGFy?

is found to be nearly in geostrophic balance and to spread over most of shelf,

thereby accelerating a geostrophic onshore flow. The along–isobath geostrophic

balance is modified by nonlinear momentum advection at mid–depth and by fric-

tion within the bottom Ekman layer. Typical magnitudes for the model time–

mean, depth–averaged PGFy? are 5 × 10?7 m s?2–5 × 10?6 m s?2, associated with



72

onshore velocities of ?1–5 cm s?1. Buoyancy arrest might be important during

vigorous SACW intrusions, owing to the observed range of values for the slope

Burger number1 (0.32–0.92). Three higher–order deep–ocean physical processes

are identified and quantified. Specifically, the intrinsic thermocline uplifting ef-

fect of the model Brazil Current (BC) is found to bring ?1.4?C colder water to the

surface under steady, upwelling–favorable wind forcing (relative to a flat, BC–free

scenario). Moreover, the ?0.3–0.5 values estimated for the Rossby number along

the shelf edge suggest that the BC is prone to inertial overshooting, giving rise

to local intrusions of SACW at the shelf edge. Finally, the planetary ?–effect is

estimated to account for an additional background O(10?7 m s?2) equatorward

PGFy? along the shelf edge.

In Chapter 3, the question of the onshore transmission of the time–mean pres-

sure perturbations imparted by the BC at the shelf edge is further examined under

the framework of an analytical Arrested Topographic Wave (ATW) model. Com-

parison with the primitive–equation numerical solutions discussed in Chapter 2

suggests that the physics contained in the ATW model is indeed a plausible ratio-

nalization for most of the features obtained in the numerical solutions. Specifi-

cally, the cross–shelf e–folding scales estimated from the numerical solutions are

found to agree in order of magnitude with the cross–shelf onshore penetration

scale
?
?2r/(lfs) = 10 km predicted by the ATW, where r is a linear bottom re-

sistance parameter, l is the along–shelf wavenumber of the shelf edge forcing, f

is the Coriolis parameter and s is the bottom slope. The numerical penetration

length scales are found to generally increase with BC amplitudes. Best agreement

between numerical and theoretical penetration scales are found for stronger (&gt;60

cm s?1) BC core velocities. Furthermore, agreement improves when quadratic bot-

tom stress is introduced. In the quadratic case, the relative increase in the numer-

ical onshore penetration scales is roughly predicted. The quadratic cross–shelf

length scale becomes q?1quadratic =
?
?2CD/(lfs) ×

?
Ubot, where CD is a quadratic

bottom friction parameter and Ubot is a near–bottom velocity magnitude.

1The slope Burger number can be defined as S ? ?N/f, where ? is the bottom slope, N is the
stratification frequency and f is the Coriolis parameter.

4.2 Future work

The regional picture that emerges from this study is that of a scale–dependent

cross–isobath coastal circulation, which is wind–driven at leading order, but mod-

ulated by deep–ocean processes at next order. Further investigation of a number

of open questions is key to better understanding, modeling and predicting the re-

gional coastal ocean in the Esp??rito Santo Basin. Some of the questions that future

work on this subject should address are:

1. How important to the South Atlantic Central Water intrusions is the Brazil Cur-

rent mesoscale eddy field in the Esp??rito Santo Basin? What are the physical mech-

anisms involved?

2. What is the role of coastal–trapped waves in the cross–shelf circulation in the

Esp??rito Santo Basin? Are there important resonant effects with the deep–ocean

forcings?

3. What is the effect of internal waves in the intrusions of South Atlantic Central

Water in the Tubara?o Bight?

4. Does buoyancy arrest inflict strong constraints on intrusions of South Atlantic

Central Water in the Esp??rito Santo Basin?

5. What are the physical mechanisms involved in the intrusions of Tropical Water in

the Esp??rito Santo Basin?

6. Are cross–shelf intrusions and extrusions in the Esp??rito Santo Basin associated

with submesoscale processes (e.g., mixed layer instabilities and filaments) compa-

rable in magnitude with their mesoscale counterparts?

Finding answers to these questions will probably entail a variety of methods.

Personally, I feel that the thoughtful combination of process–oriented primitive–

equation numerical modeling and observations (both in situ and remote) is a

powerful approach for developing a mechanistic view of the core physics of a

system, which may in turn be rationalized in terms of much simpler models.
