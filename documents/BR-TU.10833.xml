resumo 
 
 

A investigação em engenharia de tecidos (ET) tem procurado soluções para as necessidades de reforço 
e de regeneração dos tecidos recorrendo por vezes a substâncias bioactivas que podem favorecer a 
proliferação celular. Os avanços recentes em ET têm beneficiado da utilização de matrizes 
tridimensionais porosas (scaffolds) que permitem a adesão, proliferação e regeneração das células bem 
como a vascularização, estimulando a formação de novo tecido. A obtenção de scaffolds de quitosano 
(CH) para a regeneração óssea tem merecido especial interesse devido às suas propriedades biológicas 
e físicas, apresentando no entanto o inconveniente da falta de resistência mecânica e de bioatividade. A 
obtenção de scaffolds compósitos por incorporação na matriz polimérica de materiais bioactivos de 
fosfato de cálcio, permite reforçar o scaffold, melhorando o seu desempenho mecânico e a sua 
osteocondutividade.  
No presente trabalho, produziram-se scaffolds compósitos de quitosano/hidroxiapatite por processos de 
congelamento e liofilização de suspensões de fosfatos de cálcio (CaP) em soluções de CH. Utilizaram-
se CaP sintetizados laboratorialmente, quer na forma de fibras de hidroxiapatite (HA), quer de lamelas 
de monetite, quer de mistura dos dois. Os CaP foram sintetizados por um método de precipitação em 
meio aquoso, tendo-se monitorizado a precipitação de fosfato de cálcio durante 3 dias. Avaliou-se a 
evolução das fases cristalinas e da morfologia das partículas precipitadas por microscopia eletrónica de 
varrimento (SEM), difracção de raios X (XRD) e por adsorção de N2 usando a isotérmica de BET. Os 
resultados evidenciaram que o aumento da temperatura de refluxo acelera a transformação das fibras 
de octacalcium fosfato em fibras de HÁ, permitindo reduzir o tempo de precipitação total para 
obtenção de fibras de HA 
 As soluções de quitosano e as suspensões de HAP em solução de CH, a dois valores de pH (pH=2 e 
pH= 5), foram congeladas a três temperaturas diferentes antes de serem liofilizadas. Caracterizaram-se 
os scaffolds por SEM, DRX, microtomografia computorizada (µ -CT) e espectroscopia de 
infravermelhos com transformada de Fourier (FTIR), tendo-se ainda avaliado o seu comportamento 
mecânico em compressão. Obtiveram-se scaffolds compósitos macroporosos com porosidade superior 
a 80%, tamanho de poro na gama 50-250µm e porosidade interconectada com grau de interconexão de 
91-98.5%. Verificou-se que o tamanho e morfologia de poro dos scaffolds é condicionado pelo pH das 
suspensões e pela temperatura de congelamento. O valor de pH mais elevado (pH=5) e a temperatura 
de congelamento mais elevada (T=0ºC) são as condições que mais favorecem o crescimento de cristais 
de gelo e por conseguinte a formação de poros de maior dimensão. Verificou-se também que a 
incorporação de partículas de CaP na matriz polimérica de CH aumenta a resistência mecânica do 
scaffold, que é também condicionada pelo tamanho de poro e pela morfologia da partícula de CaP. O 
estudo do comportamento bioactivo dos scaffolds compósitos em soluções simuladoras do plasma 
humano (SBF), monitorizando a variação das concentrações de Ca e P na solução de SBF, evidenciou 
o contributo das partículas de CaP para a bioactividade do scaffold. Os scaffolds compósitos em que 
coexistem brushite e HA (preparados a pH=2) evidenciaram bioactividade superior á dos scaffolds 
compósitos CH/HA. 
Preparam-se também scaffolds incorporando grânulos de hidroxiapatite carregados com um fármaco 
modelo, a dexametasona (DEX), na solução inicial de CH. Os grânulos obtiveram-se por atomização 
de suspensões de HA nanométrica em solução de DEX. Construíram-se os perfis de libertação da DEX 
em solução tampão fosfato (PBS) por determinação da concentração de DEX por espectroscopia de 
ultravioleta (UV) ao comprimento de onda de 242 nm. Entre as várias curvas de libertação de DEX 
decorrentes das diferentes metodologias testadas para carregamento do fármaco, evidenciou-se um 
perfil de libertação de DEX segundo o qual cerca de 80% da DEX é libertado ao longo de ~30 dias, 
assegurando-se assim uma libertação mais lenta e prolongada do que as referidas na literatura para a 
DEX  
As características dos scaffolds compósitos preparados no presente trabalho apontam os materiais 
produzidos como promissores para aplicação em engenharia de tecidos, apresentando como potencial 
adicional a capacidade de se comportarem como sistemas de libertação controlada de fármacos.

abstract 
 

Tissue engineering research attempts to satisfy the needs of support, reinforcement and in some 
cases organization of the regenerating tissue with a controlled supply of bioactive substances that 
might positively influence the behaviour of incorporated or ingrowing cells. As demonstrated by the 
recent advances on biomaterials, the ideal scaffold for tissue regeneration should offer a 3D 
interconnected porous structure behaving as a template to promote cells adhesion and proliferation 
and vascularisation as well thus stimulating the new tissue ingrowth. A special interest has been 
focused on chitosan (CH - the partially deacetylated derivative of chitin) scaffolds for bone 
regeneration due to its biological and physical properties, in spite of some drawbacks regarding its 
lack of mechanical strength and bioactivity. The incorporation of bioactive calcium phosphates 
materials in the polymer matrix is expected to reinforce chitosan scaffolds improving their 
mechanical performance and osteoconductivity. 
In the present work, chitosan based scaffolds were produced by freeze-drying CH solutions 
containing calcium phosphate (CaP) particles, either as fibers of hydroxyapatite (HA), platelets of 
monetite or a mixture of both. CaP particles were prepared by a wet precipitation method. The 
calcium phosphate precipitation was monitored by taking a number of samples during 3-days. 
Evolution of the morphology and crystal phase composition of the precipitated particles were 
followed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), N2 adsorption using the BET isotherm (BET), and 
X-ray diffraction (XRD). It was observed that the increase of refluxing temperature allowed a faster 
transformation of octacalcium phosphate fibers into HA fibers, hence shortening the precipitation 
time required for obtaining HA fibers, 
Chitosan based scaffolds suspensions at two different pH values were frozen at three different 
temperatures before freeze-drying (thermally induced phase separation-TIPS). SEM, XRD, 
microcomputed tomography (µ -CT) and Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used 
to analyze the physical and chemical properties of the composite scaffolds. Compressive mechanical 
tests were also undertaken to characterize the materials. Bioactivity studies were performed in 
simulated body fluid (SBF) solutions by monitoring the Ca and P concentration variations of SBF 
solutions.  
Highly interconnected macroporous scaffolds with a pore size ranging from of 50 to 250µ m, 
interconnectivity around 91-98.5%, and porosity higher than 80% were obtained. The freezing 
temperature and the pH of chitosan solution/suspension revealed to play a significant influence in the 
pore structure. The higher pH (pH=5) and the higher freezing temperature (T=0ºC) were found as the 
most favourable conditions for ice crystal growth which resulted in larger pores. It was also observed 
that CaP particles incorporation in the CH matrix increased the scaffold mechanical strength which 
was also conditioned by the pore size and by the reinforcing particle morphology. The bioactivity 
studies revealed the CaP contribution for the scaffold bioactivity. The composite scaffolds having 
brushite and HA (obtained at pH=2) exhibited enhanced bioactivity as compared to composite 
CH/HA scaffolds based.  
CH based scaffolds were also prepared by incorporating HA granules loaded with dexamethasone 
(DEX), a drug model, in CH solution. The granules were obtained by spray drying HA nanosized 
particles suspended in DEX solution. The drug release profiles of DEX were determined in 
phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) by DEX concentration evaluation in the releasing medium by 
Ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy at the wavelength of 242 nm. Among the different DEX release 
patterns corresponding to the various DEX loading methodologies which were tested, an adequate 
release profile could be selected: it showed that the release of 80% of the DEX loaded amount could 
be ensured during ~30 days, thus enabling a prolonged and slowest DEX release as compared to 
literature reports. It is thus found that the CH scaffolds engineered with a calcium phosphate based 
drug delivery system (DDS) provides the desirable association of a bioactive and osteoconductive 
matrix with an in situ controlled release of a therapeutic agent. These results point out an additional 
potential of the composite CH/HA scaffolds for behaving as a controlled drug release system (DDS).

Introduction &amp;amp; Objectives 

 

Tissue engineering (TE) is an important therapeutic strategy aiming at replacing 

and facilitating the re-growth of injured or diseased tissue1. The application of tissue 

engineering comprises in a wide range area, such as fabricated skin, liver, pancreas, 

cartilage, bone, ligament, tendon, etc2. Its basic concept started believing that cells can be 

isolated from a patient, expanded in a culture, seeded into a carrier, and finally grafted 

back into the patient. The goal of tissue engineering which is to fabricate living 

replacement parts for the body is achieved by combining three main elements: biomaterials 

(scaffold), cells, and bioactive/signaling molecules3.   

One of tissue engineering applications is bone regeneration. Bone loss due to 

trauma or disease is one vital health problem. In United States at least 6,3 million fractures 

happen every year, bone problem due to osteoporosis harm over 10 million Americans, 

and disease due to low bone mass affect another 34 millions3. In all those cases and also 

other cases, such as bone cancers, bone regeneration is critical in order to restore the 

function. 

Several medical treatments are available for bone injuries, being autograft one of 

them. In the case of autograft, implantation is done by harvesting bone tissue from one 

certain site in patient’s body and fixing it to the injured site. However, several limitations 

were found in these treatments, such as loosing function in the place where the bone was 

harvested, infection, and pain. Besides autograft, allograft and xenograft can also be done 

for bone implantation where the bone grafts are obtained from another person and another 

species, respectively. In this case, spreading of danger diseases and negative response from 

the body might occur3. Bone implantation can also be done by using metallic materials, 

such as iron, cobalt, titanium. Nevertheless, some drawbacks mainly related to the 

inappropriate mechanical properties appear. Ceramic materials are also able to be utilized 

for surgical implantations. However, besides their inadequate mechanical performance, 

several shortcomings from both ceramics and metals are their low or non-biodegradability 

and limited processing.  

The development in TE area might be one of the solutions of the previous 

problems. By utilizing scaffolds, cells, and or bioactive molecules to support and facilitate 

the growth of new bone tissue, a bone defect will be restored without the use of any 

permanent implant3. TE approach in general, including for bone regeneration, can be done 

in several ways as shown in Figure 1-1. Based on the existence of cells prior to 

implantation, systems can be divided into two: cellular systems and acellular systems4. In 

acellular systems, scaffolds are implanted directly in the human body without cell addition. 

While in cellular system, two approaches can be done: (1) seeding cell at point of delivery

and (2) seeding and allowing cells to remodel the scaffold into natural tissue in the 

laboratory prior to implantation5. 

 
Figure 1-1 Application of scaffolds in tissue engineering (TE) approach consisting of (1) in vivo 

approaches with or without cells and (2) traditional TE which involves seeding and growing cells in the 
laboratory 5 

 
Based on explanation above, it is clear that the scaffold has an important role in TE 

approach. In order to fulfill its purpose, the scaffold has to meet several requirements, such 

as: biocompatibility, bioactivity, biodegradability, and appropriate mechanical properties. 

Several materials, including ceramics, polymer, and ceramics-polymer composite have 

been used for preparing scaffolds. The advantages of using ceramics, such as CaP 

(Hydroxyapatite/HA, ?-Tricalcium phosphate/?-TCP) and bioglass, are their 

biocompatibility, osteoconductivity and sufficient mechanical strength. HA is one 

compound which is most used since its chemical composition is similar with inorganic 

component of bone in human body. In the other hand, they also have several shortcomings, 

such as being slowly degradable and brittle6. Utilizing polymers have some limitations, 

mainly poor stiffness and compression strength. As compared to ceramics, some polymers, 

such as polylactid acid (PLA, PLLA, PDLA), polyglycolic acid (PGA), collagen, alginate, 

and chitosan, may easily degrade. The adequate combination of ceramics and polymers is

thus being addressed as a promising approach for producing scaffolds displaying the 

desired characteristic for bone TE. 

 Another function of the scaffold in bone regeneration besides its supporting 

structure role for cells grow is as drug delivery system (DDS). During its function as cell 

growth support, ideal scaffolds are supposed to degrade6, 26, 7. Based on this nature, drugs 

can be loaded into the scaffold and later released to implantation sites during scaffold 

degradation.  

Among the most studied composite scaffold, it is worthy to mention chitosan/CaP 

(CH/CaP) composite materials due to chitosan biocompatibility and biodegradability and 

to bioactivity of CaP (as HA and TCP). A number of studies on the area of CH/CaP has 

been carried out8, 9, 10, 11, 7, 43 showing that the addition of CaP has improved the 

mechanical properties of CH/?-TCP scaffold9, the biocompatibility and bioactivity of 

CH/nano-HA scaffold8, 43 . Furthermore it was also shown that CH scaffold may play a 

retarding role during a drug release, i.e. gentamincin sulphate, which is kept under release 

for more than 3 weeks7, thus pointing its potential for DDS applications. However the 

combination of scaffold and DDS performance in the same biomaterial device has been 

scarcely exploited.  Furthermore CH based scaffolds still present relatively modest pore 

sizes, very often less than 100µ m8, 43. Studies aiming to improve CH scaffolds 

microstructure are thus still welcome.  

In the framework of the CH issues stated above, it is necessary to further exploit 

both the composition and the manufacturing method of CH/HA composite scaffold in 

order to improve its structural characteristics (including pore size, porosity, 

interconnectivity) and potentialities as a DDS. The present study is thus targeted to the 

development of CH/HA composite scaffolds aimed at bone regeneration, with the 

following objectives: 

1. To exploit and understand the role of processing variables including the pH of chitosan 
solution, and the freezing temperature on chitosan based scaffolds microstructure. 

2. To combine the effects of processing variables  and of  different types of CaP 

reinforcing particles for engineering the scaffold microstructure and bioactivity while  

improving the mechanical properties of the scaffold 

3. To evaluate the potentiality of CH scaffolds as drug delivery system. 

For achieving these objectives, composite scaffolds with different compositions 

were produced under different experimental freeze drying conditions. The microstructure, 

mechanical properties, and bioactivity of the obtained scaffolds are here analyzed and 

discussed. Furthermore, the scaffolds behavior as drug delivery systems using 

dexamethasone as a drug model is also analyzed.   

This report consists of five chapters. Chapter 1 addresses the interest and objectives 

of the present study. In Chapter 2, literature review about scaffolds, including its 

requirements, raw materials and manufacturing techniques are set up to build up better

understanding on this area. The problem formulation of this research is presented in 

Chapter 3. Materials and methods of the experimental procedure are explained in Chapter 

4. The results and respective discussions are presented in Chapter 5. Finally the main 

conclusions and recommendations are summarized in Chapters 6.

Literature Review 

 
In the following section, basic knowledge and information regarding to the topic 

from recent publications and books are presented in order to have better understanding. In 

section 2.1 a number of issues related to porous scaffold requirements for bone 

regeneration are explained. Section 2.2 describes the material choices for scaffold; 

information about chitosan and CaP are written here. And in section 2.3, a number of 

scaffold manufacturing processes are illustrated. 

 

2.1. Porous Scaffold for Bone Regeneration 
In tissue engineering, scaffold has an important role. Scaffold is designed as three-

dimensional biodegradable structure which possesses a high porosity and pore 

interconnectivity. It performs as structural support for cells while they gradually degrade 

and the new tissue being formed6.  

As mentioned in chapter 1 about scaffold requirements, the criteria for choosing 

materials to perform as scaffold are quite complicated and challenging since it has to face 

complex biological and sensitive system as the human body. In the case of bone 

regeneration application, several requirements should be fulfilled as shown in Table 2-1. 

 
Table 2-1 Scaffold Basic Design Parameters for Bone Tissue Engineering12 

Parameter Requirements 
Porosity  Maximum possible without compromising mechanical properties (typical 

porosity around 90%) 
Pore size 200-400µ m 
Pore structure  Interconnected 
Mechanical properties of cancellous bone  
Tension and compression Strength : 5-10 MPa 
 Modulus : 50-100 MPa 
Mechanical properties of cotical bone  
Tension Strength : 80-150 MPa 
 Modulus 17-20 GPa 
Compression Strength : 130-220 MPa 
 Modulus : 17-20 GPa 
 Fracture Toughness : 6-8MPa ?m 
Degradation Properties  
Degradation time Must be tailored to match the application in patients 
Degradation mechanism Bulk dissolution in medium 
Biocompatibility No chronic inflammation 
Sterizability Strerizable without altering material properties 
Bioactivity Bioactive 

 

Basically, mechanical properties of scaffold should match with the tissue at the 

implantation sites and provide the correct stress environment for the neotissues2,6. 

Biocompatibility is needed; in which generation of any unwanted tissue response to the 

implant is avoided so that not inflammatory response occurs3. In the case of 

biodegradability, scaffold is required to degrade in a controlled manner to facilitate load

transfer to develop bone and allow bone growth into the defect. Furthermore, it is 

compulsory for the degradation products to be non-toxic to the body3. High interconnected 

porosity structure and high surface area are needed to allow cell adhesion, proliferation, 

facilitating cell contacts, and cell migration in order to encourage bone ingrowths and 

repair1,2 

Osteoconductive materials are preferable, in which the properties of a material 

show an ability to support bone growth by providing a site for cell attachment and vascular 

ingrowth3. Another requirement is bioactivity; bioactive materials allow and enhance the 

formation of apatitic layer which allow bonding to the bone tissue. 

 

2.1.1. Mechanical Properties 
In the case of mechanical properties, porous scaffold materials should match with 

the properties of target sites. It should be able to give enough strength to the damaged 

locations and in the same time allow gradual load transfer in order to facilitate the newly 

growth tissue for bone recovery3.  

Bone has very unique mechanical properties which are originated from its chemical 

components and hierarchical organization13, 14, 15. As shown in Figure 2-1, bone is a 

complex biological material which consists of collagen fibril and HA crystal. Inorganic 

material which is mainly HA covers 60% composition of bone, organic material covers 

30%, and the remaining 10% is water. This composition makes bone with outstanding 

mechanical properties in which the compressive strength is originated from the rigid HA, 

while collagen fibrils are capable of energy dissipation and impart the tensile properties3.

Two types of bone exist in human body, i.e. cortical bone and cancellous bone. 

Cortical bone which covers 80% of adult skeleton is hard, compact, dense bone which 

posses only 10% porosity3. Its strength values are 79-151MPa in tension and 131-224MPa 

in compression; its modulus is 17-20GPa in both compression and tension. Cancellous 

bone on the other hand is spongy and may have 50-90% porosity. Its compressive strength 

is 4-12MPa and its modulus is 0.1-0.5GPa13.  

Figure 2-2 shows a comparison of mechanical properties between several polymer 

and ceramic-based biomaterials with natural bone. It is shown that dense biodegradable 

polymer has close mechanical properties with cancellous bone, and dense bioactive 

ceramics with cortical bone21. However, when it comes to porous materials, mechanical 

properties of both porous biodegradable polymer and porous bioactive ceramics need to be 

improved. By combining the two materials: ceramics and polymer; porous biodegradable 

composites are able to improve the mechanical properties closer to cancellous bone. 

 
Figure 2-2 Mechanical properties (both compressive strength and elastic modulus) of biodegradable 

polymer, bioactive ceramics and composite21 

 

A huge number of materials including the class of synthetic polymers (PLA, PGA, 

PCL, PPF), natural polymers (chitosan, collagen), bioactive ceramics, bioactive glass, and 

polymer-ceramic composite21 have been investigated to imitate the properties of bone. In 

the area of porous biodegradable composite, numerous researches have been done; for 

instance amorphous CaP, HA, Bioglass were used to reinforce PLGA, PLLA, and PLA21, 

chitosan9,10,11, and collagen16. Boccaccini and Maquet achieved three times higher 

compressive modulus of PLGA by addition of 50%wt of bioglass17, Zhang and Zhang9  

were able to improve compressive modulus of chitosan from 0.967 to 2.191 MPa and the 

yield strength from 0.109 to 0.208 MPa with reinforcement of ?-TCP.

2.1.2. Scaffold Morphology 
Control of scaffold morphology is very crucial for its application in tissue 

engineering since it influences its degradation kinetics, mechanical properties, and also 

controls the cellular colonization rates and organization within an engineered tissue18.  

High porosity and critical pore size are essential. High interconnected porosity is 

needed to facilitate diffusion of nutrients and waste (degraded materials); it also supports 

the vascularization of ingrown tissue. A typical porosity of 90% is obligatory for good 

vascularization and cell penetration. Large surface area is needed for cell attachment and 

growth; while large pore volume is required to facilitate sufficient place for tissue repair. A 

certain pore size is necessary to be fulfilled depending on the type of applications; in the 

case of bone optimum size should be in the range of 100-350µm, 20-125µm for adult 

mammalian skin, 5-15 for fiberblast ingrowth, etc2. 

Table 2-2 illustrates the pore size and porosity dependence of bone regeneration 

development as summarized by Yang et al.2. It is known that porosity is one important 

variable for bone regeneration after one research which shows that there was no new bone 

formed on the solid particle, while in porous scaffold direct osteogeneis occurred19. 

However, it is not only porosity which influence bone growth as shown in Table 2-2, but 

also pore size. One material with porosity of 33.5% with very small pore (2-6µ m) shows 

no tissue ingrowth. 

In the point of view of pore size, from Table 2-2, research from Klawitter et al.19  

which implanted calcium aluminate cylindrical pellet to dog femorals showed that pore 

size of ~100µ m is typical minimum pore for bone regeneration. Data provided by Whang 

et al.20 shows that higher pore size (&lt;350µ m) showed significant bone growth, however 

this data is not complete since unavailability of the pore distribution. On contradiction to 

Klawitter et al., one research with titanium plates which were implanted to rabbit femorals 

defects under non-load-bearing showed that all pore sizes (50, 75, 100, and 125 µ m) 

indicated no significant differences in the ingrowth bone19. These suggested that ~100 µ m 

may not be the critical pore for non-load-bearing applications. Whang et al.20 also 

succeeded to prove another method of bone growth via hematoma stabilization. In this 

case, scaffold with porosity of 90% and pore size in the range of 16-32 µ m are capable of 

osteoinduction to grow new bone.  

   From those descriptions, minimum pore size for bone regeneration may not be 

~100 µ m for some cases: such as non-load bearing conditions and another mechanism of 

bone growth based on hematoma stabilization. However, it is suggested to have at least 

100 µm in order to allow proper cell penetration and vascularization of the ingrown 

tissue2,21. Furthermore, pore size bigger than 300 µ m is recommended due to enhance new 

bone formation while small pores favored hypoxic conditions in which there is a lack of 

oxygen and ultimately can cause bone diseases19.

Figure 2-3 shows several typical morphologies of porous scaffold which are 

produced with different manufacturing techniques. Figure 2-3-a shows one typical 3-D 

porous scaffold with interconnected open pore prepared with freeze drying or particulate 

leaching. Different structural types are also available; such as in nanofibrous matrix 

(Figure 2-3-b) and microsphere (Figure 2-3-c). Each type is produced with different 

techniques and also can be used for different application. Nanofiber mesh type is usually 

produced by fiber bonding method. Microsphere scaffold can be used with injection 

method. Further information about scaffold manufacturing methods will be presented in 

section 2.2.

Bioactivity is the ability of materials to stimulate the growth of apatite layer on

surface when placed in human body. This apatite layer normally consists of nano

of carbonate-ion-containing apatite that has a defective structure and low crystallinity. This 

biological active carbonate HA layer is chemically and structurally

mineral phase in bone. Due to this similarity, bone producing cells, i.e., osteoblasts, can 

preferentially proliferate on the apatite, and differentiate to form an extracellular matrix 

composed of biological apatite and collagen

surrounding bone comes into direct contact wit

to the artificial materials.

occurrence is minimal to happen23. However, in the point of view of bone repair,

In vitro formation of apatite layer can be promoted by immersing tested materials 

in SBF (simulated body fluid). SBF is a fluid prepared with ion concentration equal to 

those of the human blood plasma; as shown in Table 2-3.

2.1.4. Scaffold Biodegradability 
In most cases, implanted scaffolds are supposed to degrade prior to the insertion to 

the body. Instance or partially degradation is expected to occur while the tissues or organs 

remodel and grow1, 25. In the view point of TE applications, understanding of degradation 

mechanism is crucial. How these materials degrade, how long time is needed to degrade, 

and what is the degradation product need to be studied prior to its application in human 

body. Tunable degradation time and non-toxic waste of degradation are urgent in TE 

applications. Toxic waste of degradation process might trigger the occurrence of 

inflammatory response 

Ceramic and metal materials are known to have limited and non biodegradability. 

On the contrary, most of polymers are biodegradable2. Basically, there are two main 

mechanisms of polymer materials degradation in vivo: enzymatic and non-enzymatic 

degradation process. Synthetic polymer such as PLA, PGA, PLLA degrades through non-

enzymatic degradation which involves de-esterification process21. One issue which 

addresses to synthetic polymer degradation is the possibility of strong inflammation to 

occur if the acidic degradation product is released abruptly. On the contrary of synthetic 

polymers; natural polymers degrade mainly by enzymatic process; for example chitosan 

which degrade through hydrolysis of acetylated residues by lysozyme1. 

Biodegradation time of scaffolds is supposed to be able to be tuned easily 

depending on its certain application. By combining ceramics with polymers, for instance, 

one can tailor the degradation time of the produced scaffold. Boccaccini et al.17 succeeded 

to retard the degradation time of PLGA by addition of bioglass.  

A wide range of degradation time depending on type of materials is available. 

PLGA basically degrades too quickly in which they lost 50% of their tensile strength 

during two weeks; while PGA degrades too slowly where 3-6 years are needed for

complete resorption1. Others example are poly(propylene fumarate) or PPF in which lose 

about 13.6-27.9% of their weight during 12 hours in PBS immersion; poly(glycolide-co-

caprolactone) or PGCL lose 50% mass during 6 weeks25.    

 

2.1.5. Scaffold as Drug Delivery System 
Basically, human body has the ability of initiating tissue regeneration after injury, 

such as in bone marrow and skin. However, this ability varies much depending on size and 

cause of injury, and also on the age of each individual. In this case, having drug which can 

support and stimulate the regeneration process will be advantageous. Scaffold which can 

combine synergies of the porous support structure and of the drug delivery for promoting 

bone tissue regeneration may be envisaged the solution for this challenge.  

 
Figure 2-5 Schematic illustration of the most common strategies to fabricate DDS in 3-D scaffold: 

drugs adsorption either in their unprotected (a) or protected (b) forms and drug entrapment either in 
their unprotected (c) or protected (d) forms 6 

 
Delivery system has been applied in several therapies, such as: delivery of insulin, 

anticancer, anti-inflammatory agents, growth factors, etc26. Regarding to bone 

regeneration, several bioactive molecules and/or drugs can be loaded into the carriers (i.e. 

scaffold): (1) biomolecules or also known as growth factors 14, 27, 28  such as BMP/bone 

morphogenetic protein, EGF/epidermal growth factor, PDGF/platelet-derived growth 

factor, TGF-?1/transforming growth factor-beta1, FGF/fibroblast growth factors, 

VEGF/vascular endothelial growth factor, (2) antibiotics such as gentamicin, tetracycline, 

ciprofloxacin, polymiyxin B and (3) anti-inflammatory drug such as dexamethasone, 

ibuprofen6.  



Chapter 2: Literature Review 

 

 

13 

 

Several types of carriers have been used in drug delivery, such as nanoparticles, 

microspheres, membranes, rods, hydrogels and also 3D scaffolds28, 29. In the case of 

scaffolds, the drugs can be loaded into the scaffold by using several techniques, as shown 

in Figure 2-5. The drugs can be adsorbed or entrapped and also protected (with 

microspheres) or unprotected. Furthermore, the preparation method also influences 

whether the drug release is dominated by diffusion or degradation of the matrix.  

Ideally the drugs are delivered locally into the injured sites in controlled release 

manner which allows an adequate concentration level to be built up in a certain desired 

time. This is the benefit of having controlled drug delivery system, offering a tailored drug 

release pattern. Without controlled release, the drug might be released quickly thus 

enabling the possibility of the entire drug amount to be supplied before the infection stop.  

The materials which have been used as drug delivery are varied, from polymers to 

inorganic materials28. The polymers which can be applied as drug delivery systems can be 

divided into two main groups: (a) natural polymers, including alginate, chitosan, and 

collagen; and (b) synthetic polymers, including polyesters, polyaminoamides, 

polyacrylates, and their copolymers and blends. All these biodegradable materials degrade 

during its application while releasing the loaded-drug. 

 

2.2. Scaffold Materials Choices 
 
Basically, there are three main types of materials which can be used to prepare 

scaffolds, i.e. polymers, ceramics, and composites.  

Both natural and synthetic polymers have been used in tissue engineering 

applications. Natural polymers; such as collagen, gelatin, chitin, chitosan, alginate, 

cellulose, starch14, 33 have been widely applied. However poor mechanical performance of 

some of them limits their usage. Synthetic polymers, belonging mainly to the 

polylactic/polyglycolic acid group, have been in use for more than 20 years in surgical 

sutures2.  

A wide range of ceramics has been employed in biomedical applications. In the 

field of bone regeneration, HA-based CaP compounds and bioactive glass have been the 

most widely used due to their bioactivity and osteoconductivity properties.

2.2.1. Chitosan 
 

Naturally derived polymers are of special interest mainly due to their degradability, 

biocompatibility, low cost, and availability30. Besides, as natural component of living 

structures, their biological and chemical similarities to natural tissues are also the reasons 

why they are used abundantly in TE1.  

Basically, there are two main classes of natural origin polymers which have been 

widely used: protein-based polymers and polysaccharide or carbohydrate-based 

polymers33,30. Protein-based polymers, such as collagen, gelatin, and fibrin, have the 

advantage of mimicking many features of extracellular matrix and thus have the potential 

to promote better cell migration, growth, and organization during tissue regeneration30. 

Polysaccharide class such as chitosan, alginate, hyaluronan, and starch, have very good 

compatibility with blood (haemocompatibility properties) which might be due to their 

chemical similarities with heparin (component of blood)14, 30.  

Chitosan is a linear polysaccharide, derived from chitin by (partial) deacetylation of 

chitin in the solid state under alkaline condition (NaOH concentrated) or by enzymatic

hydrolysis in the presence of chitin deacetylase31. It is composed of glucosamine and N-

acetyl glucosamine units linked by ? (1-4) glucosidic bonds1. The structure of both 

chitosan and chitin can be seen in Figure 2-6. Chitin is the second most abundant polymer 

after cellulose. It can be obtained from exoskeleton of arthropods, such as shrimp, and also 

from the cell walls of fungi and yeast31. The properties of chitin and chitosan such as 

biocompatibilty and nontoxicity make them important materials in biomedical 

applications.   

Chitosan can be used in the form of gel sponge, membrane, bead, and porous scaffold. 

Its easy processability by dissolving it in acid solution (pH &amp;lt;6), makes chitosan become 

one of the most used materials in biomedical applications. The practical use of chitosan 

has been developed recently by modification to improve its solubility or to introduce 

desired properties. The main chemical modifications applied to chitosan work based on 

graft copolymerization and chemical grafting32, 1. Some examples of modified chitosan 

applications are: (1) specific recognition of cell can be introduced to chitosan by sugar 

modification; such as galactosylated chitosan for hepatocyte attachment, (2) sialic acid 

bounded chitosan to inhibit influenza1, (3) ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) 

grafted onto chitosan increases the antibacterial activity of chitosan32, etc. Furthermore, 

functional biomaterials made from chitosan have been used in wide range of applications, 

such as tissue engineering (both cartilage and bone), wound dressing, drug delivery, and 

cancer diagnosis31. 

 

 
Figure 2-6 Structure of Chitin and Chitosan31 

 
The illustration of chitosan applications in tissue engineering field is shown in Figure 

2-7. Chitosan can be processed with cells and combined also with other biomaterials (such

as bioceramics: CaP; and other polymers like gelatin). Chitosan scaffolds for tissue 

engineering application are mainly produced by lyophilization, as can be seen in Figure 

2-7. Despite all advantages of using chitosan as mentioned above, several drawbacks of 

using chitosan are found, such as their poor mechanical properties and absence of 

bioactivity. In order to overcome these problems and obtain better properties, 

reinforcement with inorganic bioactive particles might be one of the solutions.

2.2.2. Calcium Phosphates 
 

An extensive variety of ceramics has been utilized in the area of medical applications 

due to their positive interactions with human body, such as: CaPs, silica, alumina, zirconia, 

and titanium dioxide. The characteristics of these ceramics are usually high mechanical 

strength, good-body response, and low or non-existing biodegradability33. One type of 

ceramics which have been used widely is calcium phosphate (CaP), mainly class of 

calcium orthophosphate34 which naturally exist as the main compounds of bone and teeth.  

Among wide range of CaP compounds (as shown in Table 2-5), HA is one type of 

ceramics which is applied most in bone tissue field since around 60% of bone is made 

from HA21, 35. HA have an outstanding biocompatibility due to their close chemical and 

crystal resemblance to bone mineral. Besides HA, ?-TCP and BCP (mixture between TCP 

and HA) are also used extensively.  

In the point of view of biodegradability, ?-TCP degrades faster than HA. However, 

when it is pHA (precipitates HA which contains smaller crystallites size) compared to 

sintered HA, the biodegradation is strongly enhanced due to higher solubility36. Regarding 

the mechanical properties, it depends on several factors: porosity, composition, 



Chapter 2: Literature Review 

 

 

17 

 

microstructure, and flaws/reliability16. Increase in pore size and porosity lead to lower 

mechanical strength. In the point of view of composition, one study shows that in BCP, 

increasing the amount of ?-TCP resulted in lower mechanical strength16. Regarding 

biological response, these CaP compounds might also behave differently. Kruyt et al. 

investigated the bone ingrowth of HA, BCP, and ?-TCP by addition of BMSC (bone 

marrow stromal cells). The results show that bone ingrowth was better in BCP and ?-TCP 

compared to HA33.

CaP compounds can be used in the form of granules, cement (granules with 

phosphate salt and water), and 3D scaffold. The type of 3D scaffold employed can be non-

porous or porous as can be seen in Figure 2-8. However, a number of drawbacks are found 

when using ceramics scaffold, such as: slow degradability and too brittle mechanical 

properties.

preparation has been investigated extensively. Basically, there are two main methods to 

synthesize HA powders: (1) dry chemical method which include solid-state reaction and 

(2) wet chemical method which include hydrothermal reaction, precipitation, and 

hydrolysis methods37. By varying the synthesis route, HA particles may display different 

morphologies (shape and size) as can be seen in Figure 2-9. Plate-shaped apatites can be 

synthesized by the hydrothermal process using an organic medium. Spherical and fibre-

shaped apatites were prepared by ultrasonic spray-pyrolysis, by homogenous precipitation 

method, by solid state synthesis at high temperature and by sol-gel process56, 38. 

 
Figure 2-9 Various types of HA morphologies13  

One popular way to prepare HA crystals is homogenous precipitation. It is claimed 

to be an easy way to obtain uniform HA particles39 and tailor the morphologies38. It was 

found that additives can define the final precipitates. The additives can be organic solvents 

(acetone, methanol, ethanol, buthanol, ethylene glycol, and glycerin) and cations (Na+, K+, 

Mg2+, Sr2+, Ba2+, Al3+, and Y3+). The final crystal can be spherical or fiber-like depending 

on the additives38.  

Zhang et al.39 and Aizawa et al.56 succeeded to produce HA fibers with uniform 

morphology and good crystalinity. A mixture of 0,167 mol/L calcium ions and 0,1 mol/L 

phosphate ions were refluxed in a certain temperature. Ca(NO3)2 was used as the source of 

calcium; (NH4)2HPO4 as the source of phosphate; and urea as additive. Zhang et.al studied 

different synthetic temperature and time (120h at 85oC, 72h at 90oC, and 48h at 95oC), 

while Aizawa et.al 56 used 24h at 80oC and followed by 72h at 90oC. It is temperature, 

synthetic time, pH of the solution, concentration of Ca2+ and PO4
3- which become the main 

factor to influence the HA morphology.

Hydroxyapatite precipitation process may not be a straightforward process since 

different types of CaP solid phases may precipitate depending on the precipitating medium 

composition and pH. The formation of HA follows a multistep route which includes solid-

solid transformations13, 40. The CaP phases involved are: dicalcium phosphate anhydrate 

(DCPA) or monetite, octacalcium phosphate (OCP) and hydroxapatite (HA). The 

precipitation of any phase requires supersaturation conditions, being the solubility of each 

phase a pH dependent parameter. At pH 2.22-5.92, the precipitation order is usually: 

HA&gt;&gt;OCP&gt;&gt;Monetite39.

depending on the solubility depending on this curve 

2.2.3. Chitosan/CaP Composite 
 

Combining polymers with ceramics to produce composite scaffold have became 

one very interesting research approach. Polymer scaffolds have poor mechanical properties 

and furthermore in the case of chitosan, lack of bioactivity. Conversely, ceramics scaffolds 

are too brittle and less biodegradable than polymers. Thus composite scaffolds combining 

these two kinds of materials are expected to present better properties. One problem may 

arise from composite scaffold manufacturing is as this process might be complex. 

A number of researches have been carried out on the topic of chitosan/CaP 

scaffold. Different phases of CaP were used to prepare scaffold; ?-TCP7,9,10; nano-HA42, 43, 

  



Chapter 2: Literature Review 

 

 

20 

 

and some references used a mixture of CaP invert glasses (consists of CaO, P2O5, TiO2 and 

Na2O)
7,10. Not only variation of the inorganic part, some researches were carried out using 

chitosan/HA and combination of other polymers, such as gelatin44,45 and alginate46. 

Thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) which involves freezing and freeze 

drying is the manufacturing technique mainly used to prepare chitosan/CaP scaffold. 

Composite scaffolds of chitosan and ?-TCP, HA, and invert glass were prepared by 

addition of CaP powder to a chitosan solution (normally in acetic acid). The solution was 

put in a container/mold which afterward determines the shape of the scaffold. Instead of 

using mold, Ang et al.47 used a robotic desktop rapid prototyping to fabricate the scaffold. 

The next step prior to both methods is similar which are freezing and subsequently freeze-

drying.   

Composite scaffold of chitosan/nano-HA were prepared by two methods: (1) 

addition of Ca(NO3)2 and (NH4)2HPO4 to a chitosan solution; and nano-HA (140-260nm) 

was formed during the process8; this process is called in situ and (2) addition of nano HA 

powder42. Chitosan/?-TCP was prepared by adding directly the powder to chitosan 

solution prior to freezing.  

It was reported that several properties were improved by combining chitosan and 

CaP. Regarding the mechanical properties, Zhang et al.10 succeeded to increase the 

mechanical properties of chitosan scaffolds by addition of ?-TCP. The adjustment of the 

type and the amount of the reinforcement enable the production of scaffolds with different 

microstruture morphology, mechanical properties, and degradation rates too. 

Not only mechanical properties, biocompatibility and bioactivity of chitosan/CaP 

composite scaffold were also improved. Bioactivity test by immersing composite scaffolds 

on SBF showed (1) mass increase of the chitosan/nHA scaffold which means apatite layer 

were formed8 and (2) concentration decrease of the Ca and P concentrations in SBF 

solution after immersion of chitosan/?-TCP composite scaffold10. Biocompatibility study 

by seeding pre-osteoblasts MC3T3-E142,8 and human osteoblast-like MG6348, shows 

higher population of cell on composite scaffold of chitosan/nHA. This means that 

composite scaffolds have superior cytocompatibility. 

 

2.3. Scaffold Manufacturing Techniques 
 
Various manufacturing techniques have been reported to produce polymer 

composite scaffolds, such as TIPS, solvent casting/particle leaching, solid free-form 

fabrication, microsphere sintering, scaffold coating, fiber bonding, high pressure 

processing, hydrocarbon templating, electrospinning, microsphere sintering, and melt 

molding, etc2, 14, 21. Among those manufacturing techniques, solvent casting with or 

without particle leaching and TIPS combined with freeze-drying are two very popular 

methods for preparing polymer composite scaffold.  



Chapter 2: Literature Review 

 

 

21 

 

2.3.1. Overview on scaffold manufacturing method 
 

Solvent casting/particulate leaching and TIPS are two methods that require the raw 

materials to be soluble in order to be processed. Solvent casting procedure involves the 

casting of a polymer/salt/organic mixture solution followed by solvent evaporation and 

removal of the salt by dissolution50. In solvent casting (as shown in Figure 2-11), the 

polymer solution is poured into a bed of porogen (the porogen can be salt particles, 

paraffin microspheres or emulsion drops of defined size). To evaporate the solvent, freeze 

drying can be applied. The porogen removal can be achieved by rinsing with distilled 

water or with an organic solvent2. In this way, the pore size can be tailored by the size of 

the porogen and the porosity can be tailored by ratio of the polymer and the amount of 

porogen49. However, two main limitations on using solvent casting are harmful solvents 

and limited thickness of porous scaffold (film) can be produced. 

 

 
Figure 2-11 Illustration on scaffold manufacturing using particle leaching method50 

 

TIPS is one very popular technique to fabricate 3D porous scaffold with high 

volume of interconnected micropores. In TIPS, the polymer is dissolved in a certain 

solvent. Liquid-liquid or solid-liquid phase separation is induced by lowering the 

temperature. The solvent is then sublimated and leaves a porous polymer scaffold2, 21. The 

limitations of this process are the following: quite long time is needed to sublimate the 

solvent completely, and shrinkage issues are also a concern.

For thermoplastic polymer that cannot be dissolved, melt molding, and solid free 

form fabrication (SFF) techniques can be used. SFF also known as rapid prototyping are 

computerized fabrication techniques using data generated by CAD systems, computer-

based medical imaging modalities, digitizers and other data makers. Several types of SFF 

are Solid Laser Sintering (SLS), Three-Dimensional Printing (3-DP), and Fused 

Deposition Modeling (FDM)51. The advantage of using SFF is the ability of tailoring 

porous structures and the good interface with medical imaging.  

There are still some other techniques available, such as fiber bonding, membrane 

lamination, melt molding, hydrocarbon templating, etc. Figure 2-12 shows a typical 

porous polymer scaffold produced by different methods. Table 2-6 summarizes

information on polymer scaffolds fabrication techniques. It is clear that by using different 

materials, different methods, and also by controlling the variable in each manufacturing 

technique, the morphology of the scaffold can be tailored depending on the requirements. 

 

2.3.2. Thermally Induced Phase Separation (TIPS) 
 

Among the wide range of methods for preparing scaffolds, chitosan-based scaffolds 

have been mostly prepared by TIPS7,43. This probably reflects the easy preparation of 

chitosan solutions by dissolving chitosan in dilute acid.  

TIPS works based on the principle that a single homogenous polymer solution 

prepared at higher temperature is converted via the removal of thermal energy to two-

phase separated domains composed of a polymer-rich phase and a polymer-lean phase52. 

The removal of thermal energy is done by lowering the multicomponent system so that it 

becomes thermodynamically unstable and tends to separate into more than one phase in 

order to lower the system free energy49. After fully frozen, lyophilization/freeze drying is 

applied to sublimate the solvent-rich phase and leave a porous polymer scaffold. The pore 

morphology is controlled by any phase transition that occurs during the cooling process54 

i.e. solid-liquid phase separation or liquid-liquid separation. 

Basically there are two types of TIPS: solid-liquid phase separation and liquid-

liquid phase separation. In solid-liquid phase separation, lowering the temperature induce 

solvent crystallization from polymer solution; also define as solid formation in liquid 

phase49. Example of solid-liquid phase separation is the separation of chitosan-acetic acid 

solution; ice of acetic acid solution are formed and separated from chitosan-rich phase. 

Decreasing temperature can induce liquid-liquid phase separation in the case of a polymer 

solution with an upper critical solution temperature49. An example of this case is a mixture 

of dioxane and water which have been used to fabricate PLA &amp;amp; PLGA scaffold52. 

However, combination of both separation types can also be used. Lim et al.53 prepared 

porous chitosan scaffold from chitosan-acetic acid solution with alcohol as the non-

solvent.  

Figure 2-13 illustrates a binary phase diagram of polymer solution undergo three 

different cooling route. Depending on where the end point of quenching is located, 

whether (1) metastable region between binodal and spinodal curve or (2) unstable region 

below the spinodal curve, two distinctive morphologies can be achieved: (1) poorly 

interconnected bead-like structure by nucleation and growth mechanism or (2) well-

interconnected open pore structure52. Several parameters in TIPS influence the final 

morphologies (pore size distribution and interconnectivity) of porous scaffold: polymer 

concentration, quenching rate, and composition of solvent/non solvent52, 54.  



Chapter 2: Literature Review

Figure 2-13 Schematic phase diagram illustrating several possibility of morphology depending on 

cooling route54 

  

After the occurrence of phase separation during the cooling process, the frozen 

solution is freeze dried (or also known as lyophilized), i.e. the solvent is removed at very 

low pressure and temperature. Such conditions allow a phase change in which the frozen 

solvent (i.e. water) is converted in gas, i.e. a sublimation process. 55

Chapter 3  
Problem Formulation 

 
In the present work, a systematic study of chitosan based composite scaffolds is 

carried out. Pure chitosan and composite chitosan scaffolds using different reinforcing 

particles (HA fibers, monetite platelets and mixture of fibers and platelets) and HA 

granules loaded with drug) were prepared under different experimental conditions (pH of 

chitosan solution and freezing temperature). 

The HA fibers used to reinforce the scaffolds were prepared by a precipitation 

method. In this research, two routes combining different time and temperature (4h-80oC 

followed by 24h-90oC and 24h-80oC followed by 24h-90oC)  were applied. The chemical 

and crystal phase composition and the morphology of the precipitated particles were 

studied. 

Regarding chitosan based scaffolds, some experimental parameters were varied in 

order to obtain better microstructure, mechanical properties, and bioactivity of the 

resulting scaffolds. During the preparation of CH solution/suspension, the pH of the 

solution and the type of reinforcement particles were varied. Two pH values were used: pH 

2 and pH 5. The reinforcement particles with different shape and composition were 

obtained by precipitation:  HA-fibers, incipient monetite thin platelets and a mixture 

between those two types of particles. Furthermore, during TIPS, different freezing 

temperatures (0, -15, and -196oC (liquid N2)) were also used. The effects of these variables 

on scaffold microstructure, mechanical properties, and bioactivity were analyzed and 

investigated.  

For exploiting the potentiality of chitosan scaffolds as a drug delivery system 

(DDS), dexamethasone (DEX) was selected as a model drug. HA was also selected as a 

primary drug carrier. HA granules loaded with DEX were independently produced by 

spray drying HA nanoparticles suspended in a DEX solution. The spray dried HA granules 

loaded with DEX where then suspended in chitosan solution and subsequently freeze 

dried. Three different routes for preparing the drug loaded scaffold were adopted and their 

drug release profiles were studied.

4.2. Preparation Methods 
 

4.2.1. Precipitation of HA Fibers  
HA fibers were prepared by a precipitation method in aqueous solution, following a 

procedure described by Aizawa et al.56. A solution of 0,167M Ca(NO3)2, 0,100M 

(NH4)2HPO4, 0,50 M (NH2)2CO (urea) and 0,1M HNO3 was refluxed for a certain time at 

80oC and 90oC.  
Table 4-1 Raw Materials for HA Fiber Synthesize 

Composition Raw Material for 250 mL solution 

Ca(NO3)2 0,167 M Ca(NO3)2.2H2O 9,85 g 

(NH4)2HPO4 0,100 M (NH4)2HPO4 3,30 g 

(NH2)2CO 0,50 M (NH2)2CO 7,50 g 

HNO3 0,10 M HNO3 65% 1,73 mL 

 

The first experiment (so called batch 1) was carried out by refluxing (Figure 4-2-a) 

the solution for 24h at 80oC, followed by aging at 90oC for 72h. The second experiment 

(so called batch 2) was done by refluxing the solution for 4h at 80oC followed by aging at 

90oC for 72h. 

 Small amounts of the suspension were withdrawn in the middle of the refluxing 

process in order to follow the phase evolution. This procedure involved mixing and 

shaking the container to make sure that the suspension is uniformly sampled, and then 

pouring a little amount to a beaker, filtering in vacuum filter (Figure 4-2-b), washing the 

solid cake with distilled water, and drying it in the oven at 60oC. During the refluxing 

process, the pH of the solution was monitored and revealing an increasing from ~1 to ~7,5 

since NH3 was released by the hydrolysis of urea
56.  

For batch 1, samplings were carried out at 0,5h, 1h, 2h, 4h, 8h, 20h, and 24h at 

80oC; followed by 24h, 48h, and 72h at 90oC. For batch 2, samplings were performed at 2h 

and 4h at 80oC; followed by 24h, 48h, and 72h at 90oC. All the obtained dried powders

and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to characterize the powder crystal phase 

composition and morphology.

Preparation of Chitosan solution/suspension 
2 wt% chitosan solutions were prepared with two different pH values, i.e. pH ~2 

and pH ~5. The chitosan solution at pH ~2 was prepared by dissolving 2g of chitosan in 

98g acetic acid 2M (pH =2.5-2.6; further these scaffolds are referred with scaffolds pH 2). 

The mixture was magnetic stirred at 50oC for 3-4 hours until complete dissolution. 

Chitosan solution at pH ~5 was prepared by weighing 2g of chitosan powder, adding (1) 

~70mL of distilled water, (2) acetic acid 25% drop by drop while stirring at 50oC until 

complete dissolution (pH ~3,5), and (3) ammonia (ammonia 25% : H2O = 2:1) drop by 

drop until pH ~5 was reached. Finally, distilled water was added until the total mass 100 g 

of the solution. 

 

 
Figure 4-4 (a) Chitosan Solution Preparation with Magnetic Stirer; (b) and (c) Differently shaped 

containers used for preparing the chitosan-based scaffolds   

 

The composite scaffolds were prepared with a (chitosan:calcium phosphate) ratio 

of (2:1) by weight. Following the same procedure as described above, before adding the 

distilled water to 100g of the total mass, 1 gram of calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite 

fibers which was obtained via precipitation method (4h 80oC+24h 90oC), monetite powder 

(30min of reflux), mixture of HA fibers &amp;amp; monetite powder and spray dried-HA granules 

with or without DEX) were then added to the solution. The resulting suspension was then 

stirred for 1 to several hours in order to homogenize. Ten minutes of sonication were also 

allowed in order to ensure a complete mixing. Finally, the chitosan solution or the 

chitosan/calcium phosphate suspension were poured into a container (a mold which 

determines the final 3D shape of the scaffold) being then ready to be frozen. 

Three different freezing temperature were used in this experiment, i.e. ~0oC , -15oC 

and -196oC (liquid N2). The freezing process at ~0
oC and -15oC were carried out during 

24h. Quenching in liquid N2 was carried out very rapidly, being the container directly 

immersed in liquid N2 for ~4min. After freezing and quenching procedures, the solidified 

chitosan solution/suspension was quickly transferred to the freeze-dryer.

Freeze-Drying/Lyophilization 
Frozen chitosan solution/suspensions were placed in a freeze-dryer as illustrated in 

Figure 4-5-a. Freeze drying (also known as lyophilization) is a process aiming to remove 

the solvent through a sublimation process. Labconco Freeze Dry System (operating at 

~52oC and 12x10-3 mbar) was used in this experiment. In order to reach complete 

sublimation of the solvent, 3 days of freeze-drying were applied to all the samples. 

Particular attention was paid to ensure that a constant pressure is required; increase of 

pressure will not allow phase transformation from ice to water vapor directly but from ice 

to liquid water. If this occurs in the beginning of lyophilization, the samples might be 

damaged, since chitosan (in the presence of acetic) might dissolve.

Postprocessing with Ethanol 

Freeze-dried samples were rehydrated and stabilized with ethanol treatment 

following the procedure by Madihally et al.18 with modifications in order to remove the 

acetic which still existing in the scaffold. This treatment is needed in order to avoid 

moisture uptake by the scaffold.  

The first treatment was done by immersing the scaffold in absolute alcohol (99%) 

for 1 hour, followed by 30minutes in 70% ethanol and another 30minutes in 50% ethanol. 

After immersion in ethanol, the samples were subsequently quenched in liquid N2 and 

placed again in freeze-drying for 24h.

4.2.3. Drug-Loaded Composite Scaffold 
Drug-loaded composite scaffold was prepared with the same procedure as CH 

composite scaffold (as written in section 4.2.2) in which drug-loaded HA granules were 

used instead of fiber to reinforce chitosan. Pure HA granules and drug-loaded HA granules 

were produced by spray-drying of HA and HA-drug suspension76. In this study, 

dexamethasone (DEX, Figure 4-6) as one anti-inflammatory drug was used as drug model 

and spray-dried with HA suspension in the proportion of 10%wt (DEX/HA). 

 

Figure 4-6 Chemical Structure of Dexamethasone80 

 Different procedures were used in the preparation of CH composite solution 

containing drug-loaded HA granules: (1) pure HA granules and DEX were added to CH 

solution (pH ~5), (2) drug-loaded HA granules were added to CH solution (pH ~5) without 

any additional DEX, and (3) additional DEX was added to CH composite solution 

prepared with the second procedure (Table 4-2)

CH composite solutions were magnetic-stirred and ultra-sonicated in order to

subsequently put in the freezer (0oC) for 24h. Frozen solution was then freeze-dried for 

70h to sublimate all the solvent.  

 

4.3. Characterization 
4.3.1. Precipitation of HA Fibers  

Characterization of the as synthesized calcium phosphate powder was carried out 

by several methods, including: X-Ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption with the BET

isotherm, and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). XRD was performed in order to 

identify the powder crystal phase composition. This test was carried out in a equipment 

Rigaku Geigerflex DMAX III/C using monochromatic CuK? (1.54056 Å) radiation at 

40kV. The 2? scan range was 3-80o with the scanning speed 3o/min.  

Relationship between shape of peaks in XRD spectra and crystallite size is 

explained by The Scherrer equation57. The peak broadening can be observed when 

crystallite size is smaller than 100Å. Smaller crystallite size and more random oriented 

crystal will have broader diffraction peaks. Scherrer equation is written in equation 4.1.

where ? is x-ray wavelength (1.54Å in this case); c is a factor depending on crystal shape 

(usually in the range of 0.9-1; 0.9 is taken); B is the difference in angles at half of 

maximum intensity or also called full width at half max (FWHM; which is calculated 

based on equation 4.2); and ? is the Bragg angle in radian57. Monetite crystallites size were 

measured based on peak (002), OCP based on peak (010), and HA based on peak (300). 

In order to calculate the relative amount of each phase in one sample, the area 

below each peak was calculated. For crystallite size calculation, the same peak area of 

monetite were measured based on peak (002) at 2?=~26.5o, OCP based on peak (010) at 

2?=~4.6o, and HA based on peak (300) 2?=~32.5o. 

The surface area of the powder was accessed by N2 adsorption at 200
oC with the 

BET isotherm in equipment from Micromeritics Gemini. 

The powder morphology was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy Hitachi 

SE-70 SEM. The powder samples were dispersed on the sample holder with the help of 

carbon-tape and then coated with a conductive layer of gold-palladium and finally 

observed in SEM at 15kV using different magnifications.

5/(-15oC), CH-fibers/pH 5/0oC, CH-fibers/pH 5/(-196oC), and CH-fibers/pH 2/(-15oC) 

were chosen to be representative to study the influence of pH and freezing temperature. 

Each sample was cut into small cylinder in the size of ~3mm in diameter and ~7-10mm in 

height. 

 

Compressive Test 
The scaffolds compressive mechanical behavior for the as prepared scaffold 

(without ethanol treatment) was tested using a Bose Smart Test equipment as shown in 

Figure 4-9. The specimens were cylindrical about 17-19mm high and 15-17mm in 

diameter. The crosshead speed was set at 1mm/min, and the load was applied until the 

specimens deformed to approximately 60-70% of its original thickness. At least three 

specimens were tested for each type of samples.

The strain-stress curves were built based on the data obtained from the machine. 

The compressive modulus was calculated as the slope of the initial linear region; while the 

compressive strength was taken from the intersection between the linear line and the 

plateau region.  

 
In vitro biomineralization studies 

In vitro biomineralization in SBF (simulated body fluid) was done to the selected 

samples to observe the bioactivity of the scaffold. The selected samples: pure CH/pH 5/(-

15oC), CH-fibers/pH 2/(-15oC), and CH-fibers/pH 5/(-15oC) were chosen to compare 

different biomineralization ability between pure &amp;amp; composite scaffold and also the 

composite scaffold which were prepared at different pH.

SBF with the composition shown in Table 2-3 were prepared following the 

procedure by Kokubo and Takadama24. The reagents which were used to prepare 500mL 

of SBF were listed in Table 4-3. 

To prepare 500 mL of SBF, first of all, 350 mL of deionized water was put in a 

glass beaker and heated to 36,5±1,5oC under stirring. Reagents 1 to 8 were dissolved one 

by one following their order. Reagent 9 (CNH2(CH2OH)3) was added drop by drop while 

monitoring until it reached pH 7,45. At this value the addition of reagent 9 was stopped 

and HCl 1M was added in order to lower the pH to 7,42. Again reagent 9 was added until 

pH raised to 7,45. This process was repeated until all reagent 9 was dissolved.  Finally, 

HCl 1M was added to adjust the pH to 7,40. The solution was poured to volumetric flask 

and subsequently deionized water was added until a final volume of 500mL. SBF was 

stored in fridge (5-10oC) and shall be used within 30 days after preparation.

Bioactivity test was carried out by immersing a certain size/mass of scaffold in 

SBF (Figure 4-10). The scaffolds used were ethanol-treated scaffolds. As-prepared 

scaffold from freeze-drying cannot be used since the acetic acid left in the surface trigger 

dissolution of chitosan scaffold.

SBF was put in plastic bottles and placed in oven to maintain the temperature at 36-

37oC. The volume of SBF that was used for testing was calculated based on equation 4.3. 


? =  ??/10 (4.3) 

 

where Vs is the volume of SBF (mL) and Sa is the apparent surface area of specimen 

(mm2)22. For porous materials, the volume of SBF should be greater than the calculated 

one.  

After immersion for different periods of time (7, 14, and 21days), the scaffolds 

were separated from the liquid part, washed with deionized water, frozen with liquid 

nitrogen, and freeze-dried for at least 24 hours. The morphology of the samples after being 

immersed in SBF was investigated by SEM. Energy-dispersive X-Ray (EDX) 

spectroscopy analysis was performed on Hitachi SE-70 SEM equipped with Bruker AXS 

Microanalysis. X-Ray diffraction analysis (Rigaku Geigerflex DMAX III/C) and Fourier 

transform infrared spectroscopy – attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR), using FT-

Infrared Bruker Optics Tensor 27 were performed to allow identification of the chemical 

phase or functional groups.  

The liquid parts were collected with a syringe equipped with 0.22µm filter and 

analyzed by inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP) to measure the Ca &amp;amp; P 

concentrations.  

The variations of Ca and P concentrations are expressed as ?Ca and ?P in mg/L 

which are calculated based on equation 4.4. and 4.5.

In vitro dexamethasone release in PBS 
Release studies of DEX were conducted in PBS (phosphate-buffered solution) at 

pH 7.4 and 37oC. PBS was prepared by mixing 405mL of 0.2 M Na2HPO4.2H2O and 

95mL of 0.2 M NaH2PO4.H2O.  

To perform the drug release test, specimens with size around 10x6x4 mm3 and 

mass around 0.012-0.017g were immersed in 10mL PBS in plastic bottles and kept at 

37oC. Figure 4-11 illustrated the drug release test in which a number of containers were 

prepared. After predefined time intervals, the scaffold was separated from the solution. 

The solution aliquots were withdrawn using a syringe equipped 0.22µ m filter and placed in 

a plastic container.

Chapter 5  
Results &amp;amp; Discussions 

 
In the present chapter, the results respecting (i) the precipitation and 

characterization of calcium phosphate  (CaP) particles,  (ii) the preparation and 

characterization of chitosan (CH)-based scaffolds and (iii) the drug (dexamethasone, DEX) 

release behaviour of DEX loaded scaffolds will be analysed and discussed in the following 

sections, i.e. sections 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3, respectively.  

 

5.1. Precipitation of HA Fibers  
The experimental results respecting the crystal phase composition and morphology 

aspects of the precipitated calcium phosphate (CaP) particles obtained by the refluxing 

method will be firstly presented. A comprehensive discussion aiming to compare these 

results with the previous ones reported for the same method by Aizawa et al.56 will be then 

attempted. 

 

5.1.1. Crystal phase composition of precipitated CaP particles  
As mentioned in the experimental procedure, two different methodologies were 

followed aiming at obtaining HA fibers: (1) refluxing the precipitating medium at 80oC for 

24h and then at 90oC for 72h and (2) refluxing the solution for 4h at 80oC and then at 90oC 

for 72h.  

Figure 5-1 and Figure 5-2 show the evolution of the XRD spectra for the CaP 

precipitates withdrawn from the precipitating medium after different periods of time. It is 

observed that incipient monetite peaks start being detected after 30min of refluxing which 

then become more intense and sharper after 60min (Figure 5-1). OCP diffraction peaks 

started to be noticed after 20 hours. Both the peaks of monetite and OCP became sharper 

with the increase of refluxing time. After 24h at 80ºC monetite and OCP are still the main 

crystalline phases being detected. This crystalline phase evolution of the precipitates is 

accompanied by a significant pH variation within the precipitating medium, from ~1 to ~5 

as depicted in Figure 5-3. When the particles obtained after refluxing at 80ºC for 24h are 

now exposed to refluxing at 90ºC during 72h, HA is the dominant crystalline phase with 

some OCP still detected in the XRD. As shown in Figure 5-3, HA crystallization is 

followed by a pH increase to 7.5. 

Figure 5-2 illustrates the diffraction peak evolution for the particles precipitated by 

the second methodology, i.e. the CaP precipitates obtained after 4h at 80ºC and then 

refluxed at 90oC during 72h. After refluxing at 90oC for 24h HA peaks become noticed as 

well as a strong OCP peak. As refluxing at 90ºC goes HA peaks become more intense 

while OCP is unnoticed. After 72h at 90ºC the precipitated particles evidence HA as the 

dominant crystalline phase with traces of monetite. It thus concluded that the increase of 



Chapter 5: Results &amp;amp; Discussions 

 

 

39 

 

the refluxing temperature from 80oC to 90oC has speed up the formation of HA crystalline 

phase.  

 

Figure 5-1 XRD spectra of CaP precipitates showing an increase of peaks’ sharpness of monetite and 
OCP during 24hours-reflux at 80oC 

Table 5-1 shows the crystallite size development of the three main compounds 

detected in XRD (monetite, OCP, and HA) during precipitation. It is observed that both 

monetite and OCP present crystallite size variation curves with maxima while HA 

crystallite size values increase continuously during refluxing at 90ºC. Moreover it is 

evident that regardless the used methodology HA crystallites after refluxing at 90ºC are 

well developed with sizes in the range 170 – 180 Å

5.1.2. Crystal Morphology 
Figure 5-5 shows SEM images of CaP precipitates obtained after refluxing at 80 

and 90oC for different periods of time. Different morphologies are revealed as the 

refluxing time increases:  a mixture of spherical particles and thin platelets assembled in a 



Chapter 5: Results &amp;amp; Discussions 

 

 

41 

 

florrete-like structure is evidenced after a short period, i.e. 30min, which then converts to 

thicker platelet-like particles and later on to a prismatic morphology as refluxing 

continues; after longer periods fibers start to be noticed and become the dominant shape 

after 24 hours. It is worthy to be mentioned that no relevant morphology change is noticed 

when the fibers obtained after refluxing at 80ºC are subsequently refluxed at 90ºC. 

Futhermore, it is observed that fibers are also obtained when the prismatic particles formed 

after refluxing at 80ºC are then submitted to a 90ºC refluxing.  

The evolution of the specific surface area of CaP precipitates during precipitation is 

illustrated in Figure 5-4. The surface area decreased drastically from 30m2/g to 0.6m2/g 

during the first 4 hours of refluxing being this low value maintained during the remaining 

refluxing time. The subsequent refluxing at higher temperature (90ºC) allowed a slight 

increase of the specific surface area to 2m2/g.

72h 90oC)  

5.1.3. Growth of HA fibers 
 

HA particles precipitation from moderately acidic solution is also known as a soft 

chemical route in which no subsequent high-temperature annealing process is required for 

obtaining the desired crystal phase. HA fibers precipitation is a complex process since it 

might not only involve nucleation and growth of a single crystalline phase but rather 

secondary nucleation or phase transformation13. A number of experimental conditions 

which influence HA precipitation are known to be reagents concentrations, molar ratio of 

precursor ions, pH, temperature, presence of additives among others13, 38, 39. In the present 

work, Ca(NO3)2 and (NH4)2HPO4 were used as source reagents of calcium and phosphate, 

respectively; HNO3 and urea were used as additives for pH control.

Figure 5-6 puts together the properties variation of the precipitates during the 

refluxing process, i.e. their crystal phase composition particle morphology. For 

comparative purposes, the relative amount of each phase estimated trough XRD peak area 

calculations is also presented. The overall results show basically that CaP precipitation can 

be divided into three main stages: (1) formation of platelets shaped monetite, (2) formation 

of fibers-like OCP, and (3) transformation of fibers-like OCP crystal into HA.  

In the first stage, as shown in XRD spectra on Figure 5-1, incipient monetite 

appeared after 30min refluxing. This is in line with the findings from H. Zhang et al.39 

which demonstrated that during this process, urea decomposes and contributes to pH 

increase until a critical (2,4-3,1) pH range where monetite starts precipitating, the sooner 

the higher is the temperature: after 12 min at 95oC, 28 min at 90oC, and 46 min at 85oC. In 

the present case crystalline monetite was obtained at 80ºC after 1 hour at pH~ 2. Other 

references which also studied HA precipitations are Aizawa et al.38, 56. However, none of 

them followed the crystal morphology evolution during the precipitation process.  

 Monetite is the first CaP phase to be precipitated. According to CaP solubility 

isotherms (Figure 2-10), at pH&lt;4.5 monetite is the most insoluble CaP phase and thus is 

the first to be precipitated41. After 60min the XRD peaks became sharper indicating a 

higher crystallinity which is reflected by the increase of monetite crystallite size (Table 

5-1). The existence of crystalline monetite is revealed by SEM images as thick platelet 

shaped particles which are very clearly detected after 2hours of refluxing. The specific 

surface area is seen to decrease drastically during the first two hours of refluxing being 

then followed by a slower decrease until 4hours (Figure 5-3). This surface area decreasing 

reflects the growth of the large platelet shaped particles from the small sized spherical 

particles and thin platelets detected at the early stage of the refluxing (Figure 5-5). 

Figure 5-5 (b) also documents the heterogeneity of the precipitates.  Sphere-like 

monetite on Figure 5-5 (b-left) and thick platelet-like shaped monetite Figure 5-5 (b-right) 

coexists in solution after 2h of refluxing. This inhomogeneous condition might indicate 

that some overlap between nucleation and growth probably took place. Further, this fact 

may also explain why the final HA fibers possess a relatively wide range of size (50-

300µm).  

The second stage of the precipitation process involves the formation of OCP. The 
existence of OCP starts to be detected in the XRD spectra (Figure 5-1) after 4h-80oC 
refluxing. The strong peaks of OCP observed in XRD spectra after 20h-80oC refluxing 
corresponds in SEM images to fibers-like OCP (Figure 5-5 (e-f)). At this stage, the 
monetite thick platelets and prisms previously referred transformed into fibers, being 
evident that the grow of particles with fiber-like morphology was already initiated after 4h-
80ºC refluxing (Figure 5-5 (c)). According to solubility isotherms of calcium phosphate 
phases in the ternary system Ca(OH)2-H3PO4-KNO3-H2O at 37ºC (Figure 2-13), HA has 
lower solubility than OCP  in the 3&amp;lt;pH&lt;10 range. Consequently HA should be preferably

formed instead of OCP at a precipitation temperature of 37ºC. As the current experiments 
are being performed at a higher temperature it is anticipated that the temperature 
dependence of OCP solubility might account for some solubility variations as compared to 
HA. Moreover it is also known that kinetic factors may have a considerable effect in 
determining the nature of the CaP phases that precipitate, further helped by anions and 
cations from solution which stabilizing role can not be ruled out41. These arguments may 
explain why OCP preferentially precipitates in a pH range where the solubities of OCP and 
HA are supposed to be very close.  

During the third stage of the precipitation the crystal phase transformation from 

OCP into HA fibers-like particles takes place. As can be seen in the phase composition 

summary presented in Figure 5-6, that phase transformation started to occur after 20h-80oC 

refluxing. OCP transformation into HA is described by the following equation 5-139: 

5Ca8H2(PO4)6.5H2O  ? 4Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 + 6H3PO4+ 17H2O          (5.1) 

    

            (OCP)             (HA)  

For (4h-80ºC+72h-90ºC), the transformation of OCP into HA was completed 

during refluxing at 90ºC though not all monetite had been converted into OCP being thus 

noticed in XRD spectra (Figure 5-1). Once again arguments based on the stabilizer role of 

the precipitation medium ions may be put forward to explain the slow conversion of 

monetite into other thermodynamically more stable CaP phases. For (24h-80ºC+72h-

90ºC), the transformation of OCP seems to be not completed yet, since a small peak of 

OCP still exist. The morphology variations during the last refluxing step at 90ºC were 

meaningless. It is thus concluded that OCP is a precursor phase of HA, behaving like a 

template for HA crystallization as HA fibers keep the shape of OCP fibers.  

Figure 5-5 shows SEM images of the fibers obtained after 4h-80ºC refluxing and 

then refluxed at 90ºC during different times. In spite of the differences underlying the two 

routes, i.e. (24h-80ºC+72h-90ºC) and (4h-80ºC+72h-90ºC), the characteristics of the final 

particles either in terms of morphology or of crystal phase composition are very alike: in 

both cases HA fibers with similar size and crystallite size are the main product of the 

refluxing at 90ºC regardless the duration of the 80ºC refluxing (Figure 5-5). It is thus 

concluded that the incipient OCP, with fiber-like morphology, early detected at 80ºC after 

a 4h refluxing was easily converted into HA fibers at 90ºC, even after 24h. Therefore, 

overall shorter precipitation times are required if refluxing temperature/time relation is 

conveniently manipulated. The present results demonstrate that 76hours, i.e. 

(4h/80ºC+72h/90ºC = 76h) are required for obtaining HA fibers which would otherwise 

require longer times (96hours), i.e.  (24h/80ºC+72h/90ºC= 96h) to precipitate. 

 Temperature may be also manipulated towards lower values for obtaining HA 

fibers. The work from Zhang39 has shown that precipitation of HA at temperatures lower 

than 90ºC is possible but after much longer times: 120 hours under 85ºC refluxing.

Despite of its advantages of being easy to carry out, preparing HA fibers 

has one main drawback. Since several phase transitions are involved 

in this process, their coexistence in the final product is very likely to occur. For example, 

as shown in the XRD spectra of the Figure 5-2, the final HA fibers contain a small amount 

of monetite. This is also illustrated in Figure 5-7 that reveals the non-uniformity of the 

final precipitate where some non-fiber particle corresponding to a monetite transient phase 

which didn’t transform completely into HA fibers are still observed. Besides 

thermodynamic and kinetic issues contributing to this non-homogeneity, it is worthy 

mentioning that experimental conditions may also account for this fact as precipitation was 

carried out without any stirring. It is foreseen that improving experimental technique in 

future work in order to include uniform stirring may help to obtain pure HA fibers without

5.2. Chitosan based Scaffolds 
 

To fulfill the requirements of a scaffold for bone regeneration, a number of 

parameters should be met as stated in Table 2-1. In the present research, four main 

properties are addressed: (1) the chemical and crystal phase composition; (2) the 

microstructure, including porosity, pore size, and interconnectivity; (3) the mechanical 

properties, evaluated by compressive tests, and (4) the bioactivity. Different chitosan-

based scaffolds, unloaded and loaded with different type of CaP particles, prepared under 

different experimental conditions of chitosan solution pH and freezing temperature will be 

analyzed and comparatively discussed in the present chapter. Table 5-2 presents the 

scaffolds under study and their respective preparation conditions.

5.2.1. Influence of pH and Freezing Temperature on CH Scaffold Properties 
 

CH scaffolds were prepared from chitosan solutions with different pH, i.e. pH=2 

and pH=5, and subsequently frozen at different temperatures, i.e. liquid nitrogen (-196ºC), 

-15ºC and 0ºC. All the samples collected from freeze drier looked like white spongy bodies 

but exhibiting different shrinkage. As illustrated in figure Figure 5-8, chitosan scaffolds 

prepared at pH 5 showed larger shrinkage as compared to pH=2 and consequently higher 

geometrical density (Table 5-3).

These macroscopic differences were followed by microstructure variations, too. 

The microstructures of the obtained chitosan scaffolds are imaged in Figure 5-10. 

Interconnected porous structures are generally observed but with differently sized pores, 

thus denoting a significant effect of pH and freezing temperature on the scaffold 

microstructure.   

For the freezing temperatures of 0oC or (-15oC), pH effects on pore size reveal a 

slight tendency for larger pores to be obtained at higher pH (pH=5), as shown in Figure 

5-10 (a b, d and e). The calculated average pore sizes presented in Figure 5-9 confirm that 

scaffolds prepared from chitosan solution at pH 2 resulted in slightly smaller pore size.  

The study of freezing temperature influence in chitosan and alginate has been done 

previously by Madihally and Matthew18 and ZMora et al.58. The results shows similar 

trend regarding to freezing temperature. However, an attempt to study the effect of pH, 

haven’t been done so far.  

 
Figure 5-9 Effects of freezing temperature and pH of chitosan solution on mean pore size diameter of 

chitosan scaffolds 

Regarding the freezing temperature effects, a clear tendency for smaller pores as 

the freezing temperature decreases is observed on the scaffolds prepared at pH 2.

However, scaffolds prepared at pH 5 do not follow that trend and a quite different pore 

structure was obtained for the freezing temperature of -196oC (liquid N2): the pores are 

larger and seem to be apparently less interconnected than in the other scaffolds. 

Furthermore freezing scaffold at -196oC also resulted in thicker wall pore as can be seen in 

Figure 5-11. 
 

 
Figure 5-11 Higher magnification of SEM images show wall thickness of: pure CH/pH5/(-196oC) (left) 

and pure CH/pH5/(-15oC) (right) 

 

It is known that the morphology of the scaffolds manufactured by thermal induced 

phase separation process depends on several experimental variables such as freezing 

temperature, freezing rate, solution concentration, solvent type and polymer molecular 

weight among others18. When a chitosan solution is frozen, the magnitude of the 

temperature gradient (?T) imposed during freezing quantifies the equilibrium deviation of 

the solution so that the higher ?T the higher is the driving force for ice nucleation and 

growth. This reasoning anticipates that lowering freezing temperature enhances nucleation 

rate and thus favors smaller sized pores to be formed. The results obtained at pH=2 (Figure 

5-10 a, b and c) seem to fit well to this idea since they point out a trend of pore size 

decrease with freezing temperature decrease. However increasing the chitosan solution pH 

from 2 to 5 originates a deviation from that trend. As observed from Figure 5-10 (d and e) 

pore freezing at 0 or -15ºC resulted in pore sizes slightly larger than their counterparts at 

pH=2, though less affected by freezing temperature variation. Furthermore, when freezing 

at -196 the largest pores were obtained. As these results reflect the joint effects of 

temperature and pH variation it seems that chitosan solution pH plays an important role in 

the scaffold microstructure design. 

 It is known that pH variations modulate the amount of cationic groups bounded to 

chitosan molecule as described by equation 5-2:

+ ? Chit-NH3
+ + H2O 

 
(5.2)

Chitosan bounded –NH3
+ groups impart to chitosan a polycationic condition that 

helps maintaining the chains free of attractive interactions among them. This cationic 

condition explains the pH dependence of chitosan solubity59. At higher pH (pH=5), 

bearing a smaller cationic [NH3
+] load, chitosan chains may agglomerate easier in solution 

and form polymeric structures. This will also contribute to increase the viscosity of 

chitosan solution60 as was experimetally observed indeed: after adding NH4OH to chitosan 

solution to increase its pH from 2 to 5, the resulting solution showed to be effectively more 

viscous. Thus, for interpreting the pH effect on pore size Figure 5-10 (a, b, d and e) it is 

thus suggested that the more protonated chitosan chains (pH=2) ensure a true chitosan 

solution condition in which homogeneous nucleation of ice crystal occurs whereas the less 

protonated chains condition (pH=5) are prone to the formation of polymeric structures 

which might offer preferential sites for ice crystal nucleation. In this condition (higher pH) 

and under a very fast freezing imposed to the solution (-196ºC) it is here suggested that 

cationic sites probably play as favorable sites for ice nuclei formation and thus, as 

compared to the first condition (lower pH), a lower amount of ice nuclei is formed and 

thus allowed to grow further. 

The large pores obtained after freezing in liquid N2 indicate that freezing under 
liquid nitrogen temperature did favor ice crystal growth rather than ice crystal nucleation. 
It is thus postulated that the scarcity of cationic groups limits the benefit of large ?T in 
nucleation rate which starts occurring at preferential cationic sites; once nucleated, the ice 
nuclei find appropriate conditions (large ?T) to undergo a higher growing rate as 
compared to the other freezing conditions. 

5.2.2. Chitosan/CaP Composite Scaffolds 
 

In the present section the effects of the processing conditions (pH and freezing 

temperature) and of the used CaP particles as reinforcement elements on CH/CaP 

composite scaffolds characteristic are analyzed and discussed. Two different reinforcement 

particles were used in this current research: HA fibers (4h-80oC+72h-90oC reflux), 

florrete-like monetite powder (30min-80oC reflux) and a mixture between these two 

particle type  was also used in order to understand their differences. 

 

5.2.2.1. Scaffold Microstructure 
Chitosan scaffolds loaded with different types of CaP particles were produced from 

CaP particles suspensions in chitosan solutions upon freezing at -196ºC, -15ºC or 0ºC. As 

noticed before the variation of CH solution pH produced a significant effect on the freeze 

dried CH-HA scaffold either at a macroscopic level either from the microstructure point of 

view. Following the same tendency exhibited by CH scaffolds (discussed in the previous 

section) the preparation from pH 5 solutions originated larger shrinkage. The calculated 

geometrical densities values presented in Table 5-3 reflect this pH shrinkage tendency.

scaffolds showed to increase with pH, being obviously higher than those of their CH 

scaffolds counterparts (in Table 5-3). 

SEM images have revealed the samples pores size while porosity and 

interconnectivity could be accessed by µ -CT. CH composite scaffolds prepared by 

quenching in liquid N2 showed to display the lowest interconnectivity and porosity which 

confirmed the indication of SEM images (Figure 5-13) that this scaffold seems to be less 

interconnected than the remaining ones. Composite scaffolds prepared at -15oC under two 

different pH values showed similar porosity values, nearly similar interconnectivity and the 

same tendency of pore size variation evidenced by SEM pictures.  

The obtained values of porosity and interconnectivity for the scaffolds CH-

fiber/pH5/-15oC and CH-fiber/pH2/-15oC are quite satisfactory. The porosity value which 

is 90.7% is within in the range of the porosity typically required for promoting proper new 

bone growth (90%)21. The interconnectivity degrees, i.e. 98.5 and 98 respectively, are 

extremely valuable for perfusion and cell migration63. 

Quenching composite solution in liquid nitrogen resulted in lower porosity and 

interconnectivity degree. The value of porosity which is 80.6% is relatively low for bone 

regeneration. Regarding to interconnectivity degree, a clear reference to a minimum value 

could not be found in the literature, so far. For comparison, Darling and Sun63 obtained 

PCL scaffold with interconnectivity degree in the range of 98.16-99.59% and Ho and 

Hutmacher64  gained 100% interconnectivity by preparing scaffolds from copolymer of 

PEG, PCL and PLA with rapid prototyping. As compared to these data, 91.6% of 

interconnectivity seems to be apparently low.  

5.2.2.2. Phase Composition 
Figure 5-15 shows the XRD spectra of CH-HA fibers composite scaffolds prepared 

at different pH, i.e. pH=2 and pH=5. It is observed that the scaffold obtained from pH 5 

chitosan solution reflects the peaks of HA superimposed on a baseline showing the 

chitosan hump at 2?=20º. However for the scaffold prepared at pH=2, both  HA peaks and 

brushite peaks are detected. 

The presence of brushite in the CH-Fibers prepared at pH 2 indicates that part of 

HA transformed to brushite during the scaffold preparation. Such phase transformation 

probably occurred via partial dissolution of HA fibers in the acidic conditions (pH=2) of 

chitosan solution followed by brushite. This partial dissolution/recrystalization of HA 

fibers may also explain why less and smaller fibers are detected on the pore walls of the 

scaffolds prepared at pH 2 as compared to pH 5 (Figure 5-12 d and e)). A phase 

transformation was also observed on CH-incipient monetite scaffolds prepared at 

pH=5.Monetite was seen to transform into HA as shown in Figure 5-15 E. CaP dissolution 

and recrystallization as a crystalline phase different from the initial one has been seldom 

reported, depending on the pH conditions72, 65.

5.2.2.3. Mechanical Properties 
In the case of composite scaffolds to be used as support for bone regeneration, the 

improvement of mechanical properties while ensuring an adequate microstructure with 

sufficient large pores for vascularization and tissue ingrowth is a critical issue. It is known 

that the type of reinforcement together with the processing variables may influence the 

pore structure and porosity and hence the mechanical response of the scaffold. Concerning 

the particles used as reinforcement, depending on their geometry, they may also affect 

differently the porosity66 and pore orientation67 and thus the mechanical properties. To 

exploit the simultaneous effects of these experimental variables, different processing 

conditions (pH and freezing temperature) and different CaP loading were selected for the 

present study. 

Figure 5-16 shows the stress-strain curves of various scaffolds, including CH and 
CaP loaded CH scaffolds. The stress-strain curves evidence two main regions: (1) initial 
linear loading regime denoting an elastic behavior and (2) a plateau region which refers to 
the collapse or cell wall buckle10. Two main properties may be calculated from these 
curves: the compressive modulus – from the initial linear behavior and the compressive-
strength – as the highest point which is taken from the intersection between linear behavior 
and plateau region. It is generally shown that (1) loading the chitosan matrix with calcium 
phosphate particles resulted in higher mechanical property; (2) the type of reinforcement 
also affected the scaffolds mechanical properties and (3) the CH-fibers composite scaffolds 
prepared at pH 2 (-15ºC) exhibited the highest compressive modulus and strength.

prepared scaffolds and in terms of biomedical applications, the scaffold illustrated in 

Figure 5-17 seems to be one offering a good combination of mechanical properties and 

microstructure for tissue regeneration purposes. 

Furthermore, it was also shown that a partial dissolution and recrystallization of 

calcium phosphate fibers did occur. It is also thought that this fact may have favored a 

stronger bonding between the recrystallized particles and the polymer matrix thus 

contributing for mechanical properties enhancement too. It has been reported that the 

interaction between the reinforcement particles and the matrix is crucial for load transfer 

between the two phases as a lack of adhesion between them results in early failure/low 

mechanical properties16. Reinforcing chitosan polymer with HA particles under two 

different pH conditions may affect differently the chemical bonding between the matrix 

and the CaP particles as chitosan cationic groups may effectively condition the bonding 

strength between the two phases. 

The results of Figure 5-16 also evidence that the freezing temperature during TIPS 

also affected the scaffolds mechanical properties. Comparing the HA fiber loaded 

scaffolds (pH5) frozen at different temperatures, i.e. -15ºC and 196ºC, an improvement of 

compression strength accompanied by a decrease of  compression modulus is observed for 

the scaffold quenched in liquid nitrogen temperature. The reasons underlying this behavior 

are not completely clear. Probably, taking into account the results from SEM and µ -CT 

analysis (Figure 5-13 and Figure 5-12), it can be considered that close pores and thicker 

wall of pores (Figure 5-11) might be important reasons accounting for this phenomenon, in 

line with the findings of Yu et al.70  .  

Two types of reinforcements were used aiming to improve mechanical properties. 

A pH 5 CH solution was used in order to avoid CaP dissolution. Different values of 

mechanical properties were measured for scaffolds loaded with HA fibre, incipient 

monetite and mixture of HA fibers and incipient monetite (HA: monetite = 3 : 2).The 

results show  that the incipient monetite powder and its mixture with HA fibers loading 

enabled higher compressive strength compared to CH-fibers. As pointed out before, 

properties of a composite depend on several variables such as reinforcement size, size 

distribution and shape. It has been reported that irregular shape is preferred to spherical 

shape since it can form better interfacial bonding with the polymer62. Figure 5-12 (a and f) 

shows the two type of reinforcements which were used: HA fibers and incipient monetite 

powder. It is here suggested that the better mechanical properties achieved with the 

mixture of HA fibers and incipient monetite powder compared to the reinforcement 

provided by HA fibers alone may be due to the irregular and non-smooth surfaces of 

incipient monetite powders which may favor a better connection between these particles 

and the polymer itself. The fibers flat surfaces are thought to ensure a lower mechanical 

interlock with the polymer as compared with monetite particles.

The Ca and P concentration variations in the immersion media (SBF) during the 

soaking period are expressed in Figure 5-24 as depletion amounts. It is observed that for 

CH-fibers composite scaffolds, the SBF solutions depletions increase with the immersion 

time whereas they are not significant in the case of pure CH scaffolds. In the case of the 

composite scaffolds, the CH-fibers/pH 2 scaffold showed to promote a larger depletion of 

SBF P ions as compared to CH-fibers/pH 5.

Figure 5-24 Variations on Ca and P concentrations decrease (C0-Ct) of the immersion media after 0, 7, 

14, and 21 days 

 

The decrease of SBF Ca and P concentrations indicate that these ions were 

withdrawn from SBF solutions in the case of the composite scaffolds and precipitate on the 

scaffold pore walls as a CaP phase. For pure CH scaffolds the concentration of both Ca 

and P are relatively stable with negligible variations. Comparing the values of both ?Ca 

and ?P of composite scaffolds (CH-fibers/pH 2 and CH-fibers/pH 5) and pure CH, the 

bioactivities of the scaffolds under analysis may be ordered as CH-fibers/pH 2&gt; CH-

fibers/pH 5&gt; pure CH. This result is in line with XRD and FTIR spectra, in which HA 

peaks and phosphate stretching bands are sharper in CH-fibers/pH 2, followed by  CH-

fibers/pH 5, and then by pure CH.  

Bioactivity qualifies the tendency of a material to form a chemical bond with the 

host bone16 and is experimentally denounced by the formation of an apatite layer. The 

precipitation of such CaP layer requires nucleation sites for apatite nuclei to be formed and 

later start growing. CH composite scaffold/pH 2 present a smaller sized porous structure as 

compared to the one prepared at pH 5. Moreover it was shown that the crystalinity and 

crystal phase compositions of the CaP reinforcement (Figure 5-22) is different from that of 

the composite scaffold/pH5.  

The studies on apatite nucleation in biomaterials have revealed that there are a 

number of different mechanisms depending on the materials22. For bioglass and glass 

ceramics which are based on the Na2O–SiO2 or CaO–SiO2 binary system, the SiOH 

functional group favors the apatite nucleation. In the case of HA, Kokubo et al.22 studied 

the mechanism of apatite formation by monitoring the zeta potential prior to immersion in 

SBF. It was shown that in the early time, HA became negatively charged due to its OH- 

and PO4
3- groups. Because of this negative charge, Ca2+ from SBF were combined with 

HA thus formed Ca-rich calcium phosphate which accumulated and allowed a final 



Chapter 5: Results &amp;amp; Discussions 

 

 

69 

 

positive charge. Further process was combination of PO4
3- to the existing Ca-rich calcium 

phosphate to lower the Ca/P ratio until reaching the stoichiometric ratio of HA. 

The above mechanism may explain a different stabilization tendency of Ca 

concentration as compared to P concentration. This tendency is clearly shown in CH-

fibers/pH 2 scaffolds (Figure 5-24) as the Ca depletion curve started to stabilize after 14 

days while the P depletion curve still showed an increasing trend until 21 days. Smaller or 

slower depletions of both Ca and P were observed for CH-fibers/pH 5 during the first two 

weeks. However after that initial period certain acceleration is noticed in both ions 

depletion. It is here suggested that the pore walls collapse illustrated in Figure 5-21(d) 

might have contributed for an enhancement of Ca and P removal from SBF solution. These 

results also indicate that CH-fibers/pH 2 promote faster Ca and P SBF ions consumption. 

However this tendency may be altered by polymer degradation which seems to start earlier 

for scaffolds prepared from CH solutions pH5.    

Besides their different stabilization tendencies of Ca and P SBF concentration, it is 

also evident that depending on the CH solution pH, pH 2 and pH 5, different ?Ca/?P are 

observed. In CH-fibers/pH 2, the ?Ca/?P value after 21 days is close to 1.85 (?wt /?wt) 

or 1.4 (?mol/?mol) while in CH-fibers/pH 5 is close to 3.90(?wt/?wt) or to 2.9 

(?mol/?mol). These values also qualify the bioactivity difference between the scaffolds 

prepared at different pH, as already confirmed by XRD and FTIR (Figure 5-22 and Figure 

5-23). In CH-fibers/pH 2, the value of ?Ca/?P (1.4) is below the ratio of stoichiometric  

HAs (Ca/P= 1.6-1.7) while in CH-fibers/pH 5, the value of ?Ca/?P (2.90) indicates a 

different bioactivity in which the process of P absorption is delayed. The obtained curves 

anticipate that longer times will be required for CH-fibers/pH 5 if a value ?Ca/?P 

approaching that of stoichiometric HA is desired.  

In the case of CH-fibers/pH 2, the as prepared scaffold contains brushite (XRD in 

Figure 5-15 A). After 21 days of SBF immersion (XRD in Figure 5-22 A), the peak of 

brushite has disappeared thus indicating that its dissolution and possible recrystallization 

as a different CaP type. It is known that acidic CaP, like brushite, is not stable at pH values 

above 6. This reason explains why in SBF (pH ~7), brushite transforms into a more stable 

CaP72. Zhang and Zhang10 studied the bioactivity of ?-TCP and glass reinforced chitosan 

composite scaffold and monitored the variations of Ca and P concentration during the first 

day prior to immersion. The results revealed that Ca and P concentrations increased due to 

dissolution of glass and ?-TCP occurred during the first 20hours. Further observation 

showed the Ca and P concentrations decreased which indicated the formation of apatitic 

layer in the scaffold. 

As explained before, preparing the scaffolds at pH 2 turned out to dissolve some 

amount of HA fibers giving place to brushite precipitation during the later freezing step. 

(section 5.2.2.). The existing brushite in the scaffold CH-fibers/pH 2 underwent dissolution 

and precipitation during SBF immersion. The CaP re-precipitation will originate smaller

particles as compared to the original HA fibers. Compared to CH-fibers/pH 5, in which 

only HA fibers (in the size of 50-200µm) are present in the scaffold, the existence of other 

smaller sized precipitates in CH-fibers/pH 2 is though to offer more nucleation sites for 

apatite formation. As mentioned by Alves et al.73, smaller sized bioactive particles which 

reinforce in the composite enhance osteoblast proliferation and differentiation and thus 

further enhance biomineralization process.

5.3.Drug-Loaded Composite Scaffold 
 

A study of the chitosan based scaffolds prepared in this work for the application of 

drug delivery system was carried out. HA granules either loaded or unloaded with 

dexamethasone were prepared in the laboratory and futher mixed with chitosan solution. 

Dexamethasone used as a model drug in this present study is one kind of anti inflammatory 

drug6. It is widely used in bone engineering application; in osteogenic media to direct the 

differentiation of stem cells towards the osteogenic lineage74, 80. Drug delivery study on 

this system was aimed to design locally the controlled release of DEX in order to 

effectively support the bone ingrowth.

Figure 5-25 shows the hydroxyapatite-dexamethasone (HA-DEX) and HA granules

details information related to dexamethasone location or appearance in the microsphere. 

Both types of microspheres were used for the preparation of chitosan based composites 

loaded with DEX as a model drug. The as prepared scaffolds by freeze-drying chitosan 

solutions with HA and HA-DEX granules, were subsequently immersed without any 

rehydration process (ethanol treatment) in PBS solution for assessing the DEX release 

behavior.

It can be observed for all the types of drug loaded scaffolds that an initial burst 

release occurred during the first 12 hours (Figure 5-28 and Figure 5-29). However, for 

longer release time, the scaffold prepared by procedure 1 showed the faster release in 

which after 2 days, the release curve started to stabilize. For procedures 2 and 3, the drug 

release seems to be rather delayed , being the release pattern of procedure 3 a more 

retarded one (Figure 5-28 A).   

 
Figure 5-29 Higher amplification for shorter release time from Figure 5-28 A 

The drug delivery profile from any delivery system depends on several factors: (1) 

the microstructure of the system, (2) the drug solubility, (3) the type of bond between the 

drug and the matrix, and (4) the mechanism of degradability of the matrix (if existing)77. 

From the point of view of polymer carriers, three main possible mechanisms are available 

for drug deliver: diffusion controlled, solvent-activation (swelling-osmotically controlled) 

and controlled by biodegradability (chemically-controlled)78. In the present study, the 

scaffolds were seen to degrade superficially (Figure 5-26 (b)). This indicates that besides 

diffusion, the biodegradability of the chitosan scaffold will be also contributing to the drug 

delivery. 

In the procedure 1, the initial burst release accounts for almost all the released 

drug. As the drug was dissolved directly in the composite suspension (CH + HA 

microspheres), most of the drug remained probably located in polymer matrix sites with 

easy access to the release medium. Conversely, using DEX-HA loaded granules 

(procedure 2 or 3) resulted in a less accessible location of the drug to the release medium. 

The drug loaded into the granules has now to diffuse through the granules and then 

through the polymer matrix before reaching the release medium. It can thus be considered 

that the closer to polymer matrix surface, the faster is the release. This is supposed to be 

the case of procedure 1 which showed the fastest drug release, with  approximately ~80% 

of the DEX being released in less than 2days.  



Chapter 5: Results &amp;amp; Discussions

Furthermore the initial burst release during the first few hours exhibited by all the 

scaffolds indicates that all scaffolds possess a certain amount of drug located in the near 

surface region, including the scaffold prepared by procedure 2. For this one, even though 

the drug was loaded only into the HA granules, there is a probability that a certain amount 

of DEX diffused to the chitosan solution before freeze drying and then precipitated within 

the polymer matrix during freezing. Such behavior indeed decreased the effectiveness of 

drug loading into HA granules.  Regarding the procedure 3, the addition of a certain 

amount of DEX to the chitosan solution decreases DEX concentration gradients  

throughout the whole system and thus minimizes the DEX diffusion out from the HA 

granules into the chitosan solution. By applying this method, the DEX concentration inside 

the HA granules is likely maintained and the diffusion from granules to chitosan solution 

minimized. This is confirmed by the curves in figure 5-27 (B) which show that the initial 

burst release in procedure 1 and 3 are essentially the same. This initial burst reflects the 

delivery of equivalent amounts of DEX existing within the polymer matrix which 

correspond to the same M mg of DEX dissolved in the CH solutions of both cases.  

Compared to procedure 1, both procedures 2 and 3 show the ability to retard the 

drug release. The scaffold prepared using procedure 2 showed an initial burst drug release 

of about ~45% of the total loaded drug during the first 12 hours (Figure 5-29), followed by 

a slower release until 80% during the remaining 30days (Figure 5-28 (A)). The results also 

show that preparing the composite scaffolds by procedure 3,i.e. by adding an extra amount 

of DEX to the CH solution, allowed to reduce the initial burst release to ~30%, thus 

enabling a larger amount of DEX to be released slower during the remaining period. This 

fact demonstrates that the drug initially added to the chitosan solution succeeded to keep 

the drug confined to the granules during the initial period of drug release thus slowing 

down the overall release rate.  

Fitting the initial burst release to Fickian diffusional release equation of the type:  

   
??

??

= ??
?       (5.3) 

where ?? is the amount of DEX released at t time, ??is the total released amount 

at infinite time, t is the release time, k is a constant, and n is the diffusional exponent, it 

was observed that the initial burst release data corresponding to the release time ~10hours 

fit well the equation. The value obtained for n was close to ~0.42. This value of n is close 

to n = 0.5, which indicates a diffusion controlled release74, 79. It is thus suggested that 

diffusion controlled drug release occurs in all the prepared scaffolds during the initial 

release periods. Further studies are required to explain the mechanism applying to longer 

release times. 

The drug loading methods of chitosan scaffolds used in the present work improved 

the DEX sustained release ability. Duarte et al.80 prepared chitosan scaffold loaded with 

dexamethasone using supercritical impregnation, and the result showed that almost 90% of 



Chapter 5: Results &amp;amp; Discussions 

 

 

76 

 

the loaded drug was released after 2 hours. Chitosan composite scaffold with ?-TCP and 

glass which were loaded by gentamicin sulphate via 48h of soaking showed initial burst 

releasing ~80% of the drug during 2 days and followed by slower release until ~20days7. 

Comparing with these two methods, it is worthy to mention the advantages of loading the 

drug into HA microspheres and further inserted them into the chitosan solution before 

freeze-drying (both procedure 2 and 3).  The results pointed out that those scaffolds were 

able to retard the drug release evidencing a sustained release profile of DEX, thus 

suggesting their potential to be used as controlled drug release system.

Conclusions &amp;amp; Recommendations 

 
A comprehensive study on chitosan based scaffolds for bone regeneration has been 

carried out in the present work. Different types of chitosan based scaffolds were prepared 

with different composition and under different conditions. HA fibers and monetite thin 

platelets were obtained by a precipitation method. These two types of CaP particles as well as 

a mixture of them were used as reinforcing elements of chitosan scaffolds. HA granules 

(loaded or unloaded with DEX) prepared by spray-drying were also used to load the scaffolds 

with DEX. Microstructure characteristics (pore size, porosity and interconnectivity), crystal 

phase composition, mechanical properties, bioactivity, and drug delivery performance of the 

produced scaffolds were studied.  

 

CaP particles precipitation 

HA fibers with a size in the range of 50-150µm were successfully produced by a 

precipitation method reported by Aizawa et al.38 and Zhang et al.39, in moderately acidic 

solution. Three main stages were identified in the precipitation (1) formation of platelet 

shaped monetite, (2) formation of fibers-like OCP, and (3) transformation of fibers-like OCP 

crystal into HA. The fiber morphology was defined in the first 24 hours of refluxing at 80ºC 

while increasing refluxing temperature to 90ºC ensured the transformation of OCP into HA. 

It was also demonstrated that modifying Zhang method by anticipating the 90ºC refluxing 

does enable to reduce the time required for obtaining HA fibers.  

 

Chitosan based Scaffolds 

Highly interconnected macroporous scaffolds with pore sizes in the range of 50-

300µm, interconnectivity around 91-98.5%, and porosity higher than 80% were produced by 

freeze-drying. Three dimensional chitosan based scaffold loaded either with HA fibers, or 

with monetite platelets or a mixture of both were characterized in terms of microstructure, 

crystal phase composition, mechanical and bioactive behaviors and compared to pure 

chitosan scaffold. The pH of chitosan solution, the freezing temperature during TIPS and the 

type of loaded calcium phosphate particle were confirmed to have a significant influence in 

the properties of the obtained scaffolds. These variables showed to play an important role in 

defining the scaffold microstructure. Larger pores were normally obtained when using higher 

freezing temperature, higher pH CH solutions and by HA fibers loading (pH 5).  

The mechanical properties of the scaffolds were seen to be highly dependent on pore 

size and on the type of reinforcement.  Low pH values and freezing temperatures resulted in 

scaffolds of smaller pore and hence with better mechanical properties. Conversely, high pH 

value and freezing temperature resulted in larger pore but lower mechanical properties. The 

morphology of the reinforcing-particles was also a critical variable. Monetite thin platelets 

displayed a better reinforcing ability as compared to HA fibers, being this effect attributed to 



Chapter 6: Conclusions &amp;amp; Recommendations 

 

 

78 

 

the irregular and smaller sized platelet shape which allowed a better bonding with polymer 

matrix. From the point of view of bioactivity, chitosan composite scaffold loaded with HA 

fibers exhibited enhanced bioactive response as compared to pure chitosan. Continuous 

variation of Ca and P concentrations in SBF solution during scaffolds soaking indicated 

deposition of apatite layer in the materials. This behavior was not observed in pure chitosan 

scaffold. 

Some experimental conditions combinations were found appropriated for obtaining 

scaffolds which porosity, pore size, interconnectivity and mechanical properties point out a  

potential applicability in bone tissue engineering, CH-fibers/pH 2 frozen at -15oC 

demonstrated the best bioactivity and mechanical properties (compressive modulus: 

2.58Mpa, compressive strength: 0.18Mpa) while displaying an average pore size of ~136µm.  

Other produced scaffolds were found to have larger pore sizes such as CH-fibers/pH 5 frozen 

at -15oC (~152µm) and CH-fibers/pH 5 frozen at -196oC (~190µm) but lower mechanical 

properties. CH-monetite/pH 5 frozen at 0oC showing the second best mechanical properties 

(compressive modulus: 0.7-0.87Mpa, compressive strength: 0.07-0.11Mpa) with an average 

pore size (~170µm) is also worthy mentioning. These pore size values are already close to the 

size required (200-400µm) for good cell proliferation. However, from the point of view of 

mechanical properties, the obtained scaffolds still need to be improved. 

 

Chitosan based Scaffolds DDS 

Loading dexamethasone as a drug model into HA granules and inserted them further 

in chitosan scaffold was proved to be a good strategy to retard the drug release. Three 

different methodologies of drug loading into to the scaffolds were confirmed to affect 

significantly the drug release rate. Immobilizing the drug in HA granules by spray drying 

before combining with the chitosan solution demonstrated slower release as compared to 

mixing directly the drug with the CH solution. An even slower release rate could be obtained 

by adding DEX to the chitosan solution in order to minimize DEX concentration gradients: 

25% of DEX was released during the first 14hours being followed by a slow release of DEX 

until 80% during the remaining 30days.  This method showed to provide a slower release rate 

as compared to other reports   

 

This study underscores the chitosan based scaffold as a potential scaffold for bone 

regeneration and drug delivery system.  

 

Recommendations for Future Work 
The results obtained in the present work revealed some needs of further studies 

aiming to clarify the following issues: 

1. Freezing temperature during TIPS was shown to be a critical variable for determining  the 
pore structure which in turns determines the mechanical properties. However freezing at -

196ºC is though to have a potential for pore orientation which was not exploited in the 



Chapter 6: Conclusions &amp;amp; Recommendations 

 

 

79 

 

present work. It is thus suggested to test sufficiently low freezing temperatures combined 

with different freezing methologies for exploiting the method potentialities for pore 

alignment. 

2. The effects of increasing loads of CaP particles in CH scaffolds need to be investigated 
for assessing its effect on both the scaffold pore size and mechanical properties. 

3. Drug release studies with various drug concentrations should be undertaken for assessing 
the active mechanisms during drug release for longer times, It is expected that such 

studies might contribute to identify the scaffold parameters that rule DEX release.   

4. Biocompatibility test (cell culture tests) should be carried out in order to study the cell 
response (attachment and or proliferation).dependence on the scaffolds characteristics.

Standard Curve of DEX 

Standard curve was made by preparing DEX solution in several concentrations; such 

as 5, 10, 20, and 30 µg/mL in PBS solution. The absorbance was observed with UV-Vis 

spectroscopy and noted as follows: 

Table A-4 Absorbance of DEX solution in PBS 

[C] µg/ml Absorbance 
0 0 
5 0.195 
10 0.372 
20 0.73 
30 1.078 

 

From the absorbance data written above, curve was built and line equation was made, 

as shown in the figure below: 

 
Figure A-1 Standard Calibration Curve for DEX solution in PBS 

 
With: y is the absorbance; x is the concentration in (µ g/mL). 
Based on the linear equation above, for one known absorbance (from UV Vis spectroscopy), 
the concentration can be calculated as follows: 

? =
