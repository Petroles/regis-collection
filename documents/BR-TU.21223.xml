ABSTRACT: The aim of this work was to analyze the sedimentary 
record of the coastal plain of Pelotas Basin, placing it in the context 
of temporal and spatial scales, and proposing a stratigraphic hierar-
chical framework. The coastal plain, located in southern Brazil and 
in northern Uruguay, is mainly formed by four Quaternary barri-
er-lagoon systems. Three of these systems were studied through the 
integration of surface and subsurface data (geomorphological and 
topographical mapping, outcrops description, geoprocessing, dating 
and Ground Penetrating Radar — GPR — records) and interpreted 
as the preserved, onshore portion of depositional sequences main-
ly controlled by glacioeustatic cycles of about 100 kyr. The stacking 
pattern comprising these sequences is progradational with seaward 
downsteping (highest sea-levels measured: 9.5, 8 and 3 m, respective-
ly), comprehending a degradational sequence set, or the regressive/
falling stage systems tract of a higher order depositional sequence 
identified in seismic sections, with about 0.5 Ma. The youngest se-
quence has diachronous systems tracts  — while some sectors have 
already transitioned from the transgressive to the highstand/falling 
stage systems tract, others are still under a transgressive context. It in-
dicates that, in this time and scale, the sea level is not the main con-
trol of coastal evolution, and autogenic factors are fundamental in the 
run of geological record.
KEYWORDS: Barrier-Lagoon; Glacioeustasy; Diachronism of Systems 
Tracts; Ground Penetrating Radar; Rio Grande do Sul coastal evolution.

RESUMO: O objetivo deste trabalho foi analisar o registro sedimentar 
da Bacia de Pelotas, contextualizando-o em escalas temporais e espaciais e 
propondo um arcabouço estratigráfico hierarquizado. A planície costeira, 
localizada no Sul do Brasil e Norte do Uruguai, é principalmente for-
mada por quatro sistemas deposicionais do tipo laguna-barreira. Os três 
sistemas mais jovens foram estudados por meio da integração de dados 
de superfície e de subsuperfície (mapeamento geomorfológico e topográ-
fico, descrição de afloramentos, geoprocessamento, datações e registros de 
georradar) e interpretados como a porção costeira, preservada, de sequên-
cias deposicionais controladas principalmente por ciclos glacioeustáticos 
da ordem de 100  ka. O  padrão de empilhamento das três sequências, 
em conjunto, é progradacional com altitudes mais baixas no sentido do 
oceano (máximos níveis do mar medidos: 9,5, 8 e 3 m, respectivamen-
te), correspondendo a um conjunto de sequências degradacionais, ou ao 
trato de sistemas regressivos/nível em queda de uma sequência de maior 
ordem, identificada em seções sísmicas, com aproximadamente 0,5 Ma. 
A sequência mais jovem possui tratos de sistemas diácronos — enquanto 
alguns setores já possuem o registro do trato de sistemas de nível alto/em 
queda, outros ainda se encontram em contexto transgressivo. Isso indi-
ca que nesse tempo e escala o nível do mar não representa o principal 
controle da evolução costeira, e fatores autogênicos são fundamentais no 
desenvolvimento do registro geológico.
PALAVRAS-CHAVE: Laguna-Barreira; glacioeustasia; diacronismo 
dos tratos de sistemas; georradar; evolução costeira do Rio Grande do Sul.

INTRODUCTION

Sequence stratigraphy is a method used to build strati-
graphic frameworks and examine the geological record of 
sedimentary basins through the definition and mapping 
of coeval, genetically related packages of rock, emerging 
from the works of Blackwelder (1909), Grabau (1913), 
Sloss et al. (1949), Vail et al. (1977), Van Wagoner et al. 
(1988), among others. Sequence stratigraphy has evolved 
from seismic stratigraphy (Payton 1977) and established 
itself as a revolutionary paradigm for the understanding of 
stratigraphic record (Wilgus et al. 1988), mostly due to the 
demand and technological development of the oil indus-
try and pioneer work of Sloss et al. (1949). Sequence stra-
tigraphy can be used in the analysis of the record in differ-
ent hierarchical ranks, from the great stages of sedimentary 
basin filling to the evolution of depositional environments 
(Posamentier et al. 1992; Schlager 2009; Catuneanu 2002; 
Neal &amp;amp; Abreu 2009).

The Pelotas Basin coastal plain, located in Rio Grande do 
Sul and Santa Catarina states, in southern Brazil and in northern 
Uruguay, has the most complete record of Quaternary events 

along the Brazilian coast (Fig. 1). This plain, with 770 km of 
extension and 15 to 100 km wide, is formed by alluvial fan 
systems and by the lateral juxtaposition of four barrier-lagoon 
depositional systems, firstly defined for Rio Grande do Sul by 
Villwock et al. (1986). Such systems have evolved during the 
Upper Quaternary, due to the combination of allochthonous 
and autochthonous processes, such as the eustasy (Delaney 
1965; Villwock &amp;amp; Tomazelli 1995; Tomazelli &amp;amp; Villwock 
1996), tectonics (Rosa et al. 2009), climate (Martinho et al. 
2008, 2010; Lopes et al. 2013), coastal dynamics, and sedi-
mentary budget (Toldo Jr. et al. 1999, 2004, 2005; Dillenburg 
et al. 2000, 2009; Gruber et al. 2003, 2006; Dillenburg &amp;amp; 
Barboza 2014). Thus, the understanding of the geological 
development of the coastal plain can be improved through 
the application of sequence stratigraphy.

Therefore, this work aimed at examining and organizing 
the fragmented sedimentary record of the coastal plain of 
Pelotas Basin, discussing scale issues, placing it in the context 
of the particular temporal and spatial scales, and proposing a 
stratigraphic framework to connect scales. Moreover, through 
the stratigraphic analysis we intended to show the diachronous 
nature of stratigraphic surfaces and systems tracts.

High-Frequency Sequences in the Pelotas Basin Quaternary



GEOLOGICAL SETTING

In order to contextualize the coastal plain record and 
link large scale — regional and long-term trends — to short 
scale — high-frequency events affected by climate and local 
coastal processes — we started positioning the geological 
record through a hierarchical framework for the entire basin 
fill, from Cretaceous to Quaternary. This framework resulted 
from the analysis of the main studies related to the evolu-
tion of Pelotas Basin detailed ahead.

Pelotas Basin is located in the extreme south of the 
Brazilian Continental Margin (Fig. 1), and has an area 
of approximately 210,000 km2. It borders Santos Basin 
to the north, through Florianópolis High (Gamboa &amp;amp; 
Rabinowitz 1981), and Punta Del Este Basin to the south, 
through Polonio High, in Uruguay (Urien &amp;amp; Martins 
1978). The Pelotas Basin was formed due to tectonic 
movements associated with the opening of the South 
Atlantic Ocean (Asmus &amp;amp; Porto 1972). The basement 
is composed of Uruguayan-Sul-Rio-Grandense Shield, 
Santa Catarina Shield and Paraná Basin strata. Main 
stages of the basin filling are summarized in Figure 2, 
based on the works of Fontana (1996), Abreu (1998), 
Bueno et al. (2007), Neal and Abreu (2009), and Abreu 
et al. (2010).

Low-Frequency Sedimentary Record: 
Pelotas Basin

According to Fontana (1996), the Pelotas Basin can be 
divided into three major phases (Fig. 2). These phases would 
include the formation of a Rift Megasequence, developed 
in the early stages of opening, followed by a Transgressive 
Megasequence that started in the Aptian, and a Regressive 
Megasequence, which evolved since the Paleocene. These 
three megasequences were subdivided into 17 depositional 
sequences, five belonging to the transgressive phase and 12 
to the regressive phase.

According to Bueno et al. (2007), main phases of basin 
filling are the Pre-rift, Rift, Post-rift and Drift Supersequences 
(Fig. 2). The Pre-rift Supersequence is related to magmatic 
processes that occurred prior to the initial stages of rifting, 
with the generation of thick volcanic flows (Serra Geral 
Formation). Continental magmatism was emplaced between 
138 and 127 Ma, with peak at around 132 Ma (Stewart 
et al. 1996; Bueno et al. 2007). 

The Rift Supersequence can be divided into two 
stages, Rift I, with a predominance of basalts (Imbituba 
Formation), and Rift  II, with siliciclastic deposition 
(Cassino Formation). This phase consists of filling anti-
thetical half grabens approximately 125 Ma. The Post-
rift Supersequence is composed of the volcanic suite of 

the Curumim Formation (basalts, andesites, traquian-
desites), alternated with lacustrine sediments grading to 
marine limestones and sandstones. Volcanic units com-
prising the oceanic crust are represented by seaward dip-
ping reflections identified on seismic sections (Fontana 
1996; Abreu 1998). According to Bueno et al. (2007), 
the continuation of the opening process led to the Drift 
Supersequence, which was divided into three phases: 
initial (shallow shelf ), intermediate (transgressive) and 
final (regressive wedge). Bueno et al. (2007) interpreted 
12 depositional sequences in the transgressive phase and 
four in the regressive phase, forming a siliciclastic wedge 
(Cidreira and Imbé formations) from the Miocene to 
the Holocene.

In Abreu (1998), 1,500 km of seismic sections were 
interpreted in Pelotas Basin and 3,000 km in the con-
jugate Walvis Basin in West Africa. These seismic lines 
have been integrated with core data in an attempt to 
correlate the existing record on both sides. In this work, 
Pelotas Basin has been divided into four units (Fig. 2): 
Basement, Transgressive phase (Aptian-Turonian), 
Aggradational phase (Coniacian-Eocene) and Regressive 
phase (Oligocene-Recent). The  resulting stratigraphic 
framework is composed of 56 depositional sequences, 
in which 18 are Cretaceous and 38 are Cenozoic. 
The mean duration of sequences was determined based 
on biostratigraphy.

Low- and Medium-Frequency Sedimentary 
Record: Accommodation Succession

In Abreu et al. (2010), the stratigraphic framework 
established by Abreu (1998) for Pelotas Basin was used to 
apply the Accommodation Succession Method proposed by 
Neal and Abreu (2009). According to this method, sequence 
stratigraphic units and key-surfaces are defined regardless 
the time of duration, controlling mechanisms, or magni-
tude of the events. Thus, resulting sedimentary architecture 
identified to define sedimentary packages solely depends on 
two factors: on the rate of changes in accommodation and 
on sediment supply.

On the hierarchical framework of Abreu et al. (2010), 
four composite sequences were established for the Pelotas 
Basin (Fig. 3). Each composite sequence is formed by three 
sequence sets, defined according to their stacking pattern 
as Progradational-Aggradational (PA), Retrogradational (R) 
and Aggradational-Progradational-Degradational (APD). 
Thus, 12 sequence sets compose the basin filling (Fig. 3).

The last sequence set (APD4) comprises eight deposi-
tional sequences (Abreu 1998). Following the same reason-
ing of Neal and Abreu (2009) and Abreu et al. (2010), these 
sequences were grouped by Rosa (2012) according to the

High-Frequency Sequences in the Pelotas Basin Quaternary



same patterns, resulting in PA4a, R4a and APD4a (Figs. 2 
and 3). Thus, the record that regards the upper portion of 
the basin has the APD pattern, and the last sequences jointly 
have a degradational architecture.

According to Abreu (1998), the last sequence boundary 
(no. 43) found in the seismic section is about 0.5 Ma. The age 
of this sequence corresponds to the existing Quaternary sed-
imentary record onshore, in which it is possible to interpret 
that this sequence is in fact composed of higher frequency 
sequences. As discussed ahead, these are partially represented 
in the onshore portion of the Pelotas Basin by the record of 
coastal plain depositional systems.

High-Frequency Sedimentary 
Record: Barrier-lagoon Systems

The coastal plain is a physiographic feature correspond-
ing to the onshore portion of the Pelotas Basin (Villwock 
1984). Younger deposits of the basin fill are exposed, con-
sisting predominantly of alluvial fans near the basement, 
and of four barrier-lagoon depositional systems (Fig. 4). 
Pioneer studies of these depositional systems were devel-
oped in the coastal plain Rio Grande do Sul by Backeuser 
(1918), Lamengo (1940), Rambo (1942), Delaney (1965), 
Jost (1971) and Villwock (1972).

According to Villwock et al. (1986), these depositional 
systems were controlled by glacioeustasy with resulting trans-
gressive-regressive cycles. Also, tectonics (Rosa et al. 2009), 
climate, coastal dynamic processes, and sedimentary budget 

(Toldo Jr. et al. 1999, 2004, 2005; Dillenburg et al. 2000, 
2009; Gruber et al. 2003, 2006; Martinho et al. 2008, 2009, 
2010; Lopes et al. 2013; Dillenburg &amp;amp; Barboza 2014) have 
controlled the creation and filling of accommodation. In this 
paper, we reviewed the age and sequence stratigraphic evolu-
tion of Systems II through IV. System I, which outcrops in 
the inner most position of the coastal plain and has almost 
100 m of altitude, is not yet as well studied as the other sys-
tems and was not addressed in this paper.

The ages of the Barrier-lagoon Systems I through IV 
(400, 325, 125 and 7 ka to recent) have been first suggested 
by Villwock and Tomazelli (1995), based on oxygen isotope 
stages defined by Shackleton and Opdyke (1973) and Imbrie 
et al. (1984). These systems are interpreted to represent peri-
ods of high sea level, which Villwock and Tomazelli (1995) 
correlated to isotope stages 11, 9, 5 and 1, respectively. These 
correlations were confirmed for Systems III and IV by 14C and 
thermoluminescence dating (Poupeau et al. 1988; Tomazelli 
et al. 1998; Buchmann &amp;amp; Tomazelli 2003; Dillenburg et al. 
2006,ore recent work indicated that System II was developed 
in response to transgression related to the oxygen isotope 
stage 7, instead of stage 9, based on thermoluminescence 
ages in quartzose deposits and electron spin resonance ages 
in fossil teeth (Lopes et al. 2010, 2014). Then, according to 
these authors, System II was deposited around 200 ka, and 
Barrier I is likely to be correlated to stage 9 (Fig. 5).

The evolution of these systems was initially defined 
mainly based on geomorphological observations, as

well as on sedimentological data from outcrops and 
boreholes. More recently, high-resolution seismic and 
Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) enabled a more con-
tinuous view of the depositional architecture and pro-
vided key-observations to further the understanding 

of the evolution of these systems (Weschenfelder et al.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The stratigraphic analysis performed is based on the 
integration of surface and subsurface data. Interpretations 
obtained from main studies summarizing the current under-
standing of the Pelotas Basin were integrated with new data, 
including geomorphological and topographical mapping, out-
crops description, geoprocessing, and GPR records. Remote 
sensing and field data were organized and integrated into 
a Geographic Information System (GIS), using ArcGIS© 
platform. Optical images from Landsat 7 and 8, SPOT 5, 
QuickBird and RapidEye, as well as the topographic model 
of Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and ASTER 
Satellite, were the bases of the GIS project. The Global 
Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) was utilized to position 
field data, using the equipment Trimble® ProXRT (WGS84 
datum), and the differential method.

Detailed topographic measurements were performed in 
order to establish the relative position of maximum sea level 
related to each system. Altitude measurements were based 
on paleo indicators, consisting of the combination of sedi-
mentary structures generated on the beach face, the occur-
rence of Ophiomorpha ichnofossils, and the vertical facies 
succession. As discussed by many authors (Frey et al. 1978; 
Tomazelli et al. 1982; Pollard et al. 1993; Gibert et al. 2006), 
Ophiomorpha nodosa forms a complex 3D structure that can 
be extend in depth. Vertical shafts with thick-lined, narrower 
and not pelleted burrows correspond to the best indication 
of water-sediment interface (Gibert et al. 2006). As this fea-
ture was not easily identifiable at the measured outcrops, 
the combination of Ophiomorpha with sand deposits con-
taining low-angle planar cross-stratification was related to 
foreshore. Considering the actual coast is microtidal, with 
semidiurnal mean range of only 0.5 m, the maximum alti-
tudes of Ophiomorpha occurrence and the top of foreshore 
deposits were leveled, resulting in the minimum highest 
sea-level position for each evaluated system. The altitudes 
are considered the minimum in view of possible erosion.

The altitude of the paleo sea levels in each locality were 
referenced to the mean low tide determined by the tide gauge 
of Imbituba vertical datum, which is considered today’s zero 
sea level along the Brazilian margin. Two methods were used 
to perform this reference: trigonometric leveling and satellite 
positioning. In System II, topography measurements were 
carried out in the southern region of the coastal plain, where 
it is well preserved (Fig. 6). Leveling was based on a reference 
given by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics 
(IBGE — RN1968U) at an altitude of 13.6217 m, and 
the stations were leveled with a Zeiss Elta 50 Total Station. 
Differential GNSS measurements were performed for the 
same type of features of Systems II and III. The model applied 

to convert ellipsoidal to geoidal altitude is MAPGEO2010, 
provided by the IBGE.

The GPR profiles were collected with a GSSI™ (Geophysical 
Survey Systems, Inc.) SIR-3000 with antennas of 200, 400 MHz 
(monostatic — GSSI™), 80 and 124 MHz (Subecho SE-70 
and SE-150 bistatic — Radarteam Sweden AB). The GPR 
system was connected to the GNSS allowing the topographic 
positioning of the survey. The data were acquired in the com-
mon offset method, with 32 stacks for each trace to improve 
the signal-to-noise ratio, and varying the depth of investiga-
tion according to the penetration from about 300 to 1,000 ns 
of two-way travel time (TWTT). Considering the dielectric 
constant for sand (10), representing a velocity of 0.09 m/ns 
(Davis &amp;amp; Annan 1989), the depth of investigation ranged 
from about 15 to 45 m. This dielectric constant was vali-
dated using lithological data obtained from SPT drill holes 
(Dillenburg et al. 2011). Trace stacking, frequency and gain 
filters were applied during the collection to reduce noise and 
enable real time data viewing. The records were post-processed 
with the software packages Radan™, Reflex Win® and Prism 
2®. Data processing comprised time-zero adjustment, back-
ground removal, band-pass frequency filters, gain equaliza-
tion, time-to-depth conversion, and topographic corrections. 
A total of 220 km of GPR data were obtained in both dip 
and strike directions, along Systems II, III and IV.

The stratigraphic interpretation was based on the method 
of seismostratigraphy (Payton 1977). The method was based 
on termination (onlap, downlap, toplap and truncations), 
geometry and pattern of the reflections to interpret units 
and surfaces (Mitchum Jr. et al. 1977; Vail et al. 1977; Neal 
2004; Catuneanu 2002; Catuneanu et al. 2009; Abreu et al. 
2010; Barboza et al. 2009, 2011). GPR units are determined 
based on its internal configuration and geometry, allowing 
the definition of radarfacies and packages. The main radar-
facies and its interpretation related to the depositional envi-
ronment are well defined for the coastal plain of Pelotas 
Basin (Barboza et al. 2009, 2011).

The radiocarbon ages mentioned in this paper are related 
to the evolution of System IV, resulting from the works of 
Tomazelli et al. (1998, 2008), Dillenburg et al. (2004, 2006, 
2007), Travessas et al. (2005), and Silva (2011). The samples 
were collected in standard penetrating test (SPT) cores and 
outcrops, and analyzed by Beta Analytic Inc., corresponding 
to six mollusk shell samples, one piece of wood, one sam-
ple of root and one sample of organic sediment (Table 1).

RESULTS

The applied methods resulted in the information 
that allowed characterizing the barrier-lagoon systems.

The geomorphological analysis allows distinguishing the 
main units which compose the coastal plain: barriers and 
lagoons. Barriers can achieve altitudes of almost 30 m, with 
the exception of Barrier I, which is almost 100 m high in 
the north of the coastal plain in response of aeolian cover-
ing of the bedrock. Barriers have undulating surfaces related 
to aeolian activity in contrast with lagoonal features, which 
are plan or composed of distinguishing elongate curved spits 
(Fig. 6). As barriers are higher, dryer and mainly composed 
of sand, they tend to appear brighter in comparison with 
lagoonal deposits, and are easily to discriminate in remote 
sense images.

Topographic profiles from System I to IV show that 
together they are at progressively lower altitudes (Figs. 5 
and 6). Outcrops measurements allowed defining the alti-
tudes of paleo sea level along Barriers II and III, which 
have good exposures along the coastal plain. In the south 

of the coastal plain, the top of the beach and the base of the 
aeolian deposits of System II resulted in altitudes ranging 
from 8.1 to 9.5 m, with a maximum altitude of 8.3 m for 
Ophiomorpha occurrence (Fig. 7).

For System III, in the southern of the coastal plain, 
Ophiomorpha occurrence has a maximum altitude of 3.6 m 
and the top of foreshore is at 4.2 m. On the north coast, the 
measurements of these ichnofossils vary from 5 to 7 m of 
altitude, and the top of foreshore is at 7.2 m. In another out-
crop on the north coast, also related to System III, Tomazelli 
and Dillenburg (2007) measured two different levels on the 
top of Ophiomorpha occurrence, one of 5.1 and other of 
7.7 m, where the top of foreshore is at 8.0 m. As mentioned 
in the methods section, the combination of Ophiomorpha 
with sedimentary structures, and the vertical facies succes-
sion allowed for the interpretation of the closest position of 
paleo sea level. The measurements performed for this work 

Figure 7. Example of sedimentary structures generated on the beachface (foreshore and upper shoreface) and the 
occurrence of Ophiomorpha ichnofossils. The combination of these indicators was measured to obtain minimum 
paleo “zero” sea-levels highs.

and those of Tomazelli and Dillenburg (2007) resulted in the 
minimum sea-level altitudes related to highstands of 9.5 ± 1 
and 8 ± 1 m for Barrier II and III, respectively.

System IV indicators of paleo sea level are related to 
geomorphological features, as lagoonal terraces (Barboza &amp;amp; 
Tomazelli 2003), and the foreshore/shoreface position along 
strandplains, observed at outcrops, drill holes and GPR pro-
files (Barboza et al. 2009, 2011). As System IV has the most 
studied stratigraphic record of the coastal plain, and sea-level 
history during Holocene is quite well known we did not per-
formed new measurements in this work. Barrier IV was stud-
ied in detail by Dillenburg et al. (2000, 2009), Dillenburg 
and Barboza (2014) and Hesp et al. (2005, 2007), which 
distinguished three main morphological barrier types: relict 
dunefields, active dunefields or a complex foredune ridges, 
and dunefields combination. The morphological types of 
Barrier IV are related to the stratigraphic stacking found in 
GPR data (Rosa 2012; Barboza &amp;amp; Rosa 2014).

GPR interpretation resulted in the definition of radar-
facies correlated with depositional systems (Table 2 and 
Figs. 8 to 11). According to radarfacies relations, there are 
three main patterns defined: retrogradational, aggradational 
and progradational (Figs. 8 to 11). The retrogradational 
stacking is characterized by reflections dipping landwards 
(Barboza et al. 2011; Rosa 2012; Lima et al. 2013; Silva 
2011, 2015; Dillenburg &amp;amp; Barboza 2014). Radarfacies are 
related to lagoonal deposits covered by aeolian, backshore, 
foreshore and shoreface deposits (Figs. 8 and 9). Usually, 
retrogradational pattern is associated with barrier morphol-
ogy of dunefields. In some GPR sections, it is possible to 
recognize the maximum shoreline transgression (Barboza 
et al. 2011) where backshore and foreshore reflections reach 
its landward most position (Fig. 9). 

Seaward, in some sectors of the coastal plain, prograda-
tional stacking is observed and characterized by continuous 
sets of beach and marine deposits (Figs. 9 and 10). In the 
GPR sections, progradational staking is composed by radar-
facies related to aeolian, backshore, foreshore and shoreface 
deposits, forming a set of reflections dipping seaward (Silva 
et al. 2010; Barboza et al. 2011; Rosa 2012; Dillenburg &amp;amp; 
Barboza 2014). Barrier morphology is mostly represented 
by strandplains, with complex foredune ridges and dune-
field combination (Dillenburg et al. 2000, 2009; Hesp et al. 
2005, 2007; Martinho et al. 2008, 2010). The third pat-
tern is defined as aggradational, with parallel to subparal-
lel horizontal reflections related to aeolian deposits, where 
the barrier morphology is mainly of dunefields (Rosa 2012; 
Dillenburg &amp;amp; Barboza 2014).

The definition of stacking based on reflection configura-
tion and radarfacies succession allowed identifying the main 
internal and bounding surfaces. Each barrier-lagoon system 

(II, III and IV) is separated by unconformities, represent-
ing a depositional sequence characterized by a conformable 
succession of strata. The architectural pattern of Systems II, 
III and IV is mostly the same. Thus, as the work done in 
System IV is so detailed and GPR data has a much better 
quality, and because System IV is less affected by digenesis, 
its understanding was used to guide the interpretation of 
Systems II and III.

The determination of retrogradational, aggradational, 
progradational and degradational stacking allowed defin-
ing the transgressive and the highstand/falling stage system 
tracts packages (Figs. 8 to 10). The lowstand system tract was 
only recognized into an incised-valley related to System IV, 
studied by Tomazelli et al. (2008), and the degradational 
stacking (also known as falling-stage, or forced regression) 
was not separated from the highstand system tract because of 
data resolution. Dillenburg et al. (2017) (in press), studying 
Barrier IV in the southern portion of the coastal plain, were 
able to separate highstand and falling-stage systems tracts.

DISCUSSION

In order to contextualize the coastal plain record, we 
summarized current stratigraphic understanding of Pelotas 
Basin in a hierarchical scheme. Figure 11 and Table 3 show 
a summary of published data used to build the proposed 
hierarchy. Major phases of basin filling are defined as Rift, 
Post-rift and Drift (Fig. 2, Table 3 — Low), with the two 
later phases subdivided into transgressive, aggradational, and 
regressive intervals, which, according to Abreu et al. (2010), 
include four composite sequences (Fig. 3, Table 3 — Low 
and Medium). Each composite sequence is divided into 
three sequence sets, resulting in 12 sequence sets for the 
basin (Fig. 3). The last sequence set (APD4) encloses eight 
depositional sequences (Fig. 3). 

Starting from the interpretation of seismic sections of 
Pelotas Basin, it is possible to define that the geological 
record of the coastal plain is part of a depositional sequence 
defined by Abreu (1998) (number 43 of his work) with about 
0.5 My. The integration of surface and subsurface data leave 
to interpret that this sequence is in fact composed of high-
er-frequency sequences, partially represented by each bar-
rier-lagoon system (Table 3 — High I). 

The onshore record of each system was associated by 
Villwock and Tomazelli (1995) to high sea levels, related to 
oxygen isotope stages from Imbrie et al. (1984). The age con-
trol demonstrates that, in general, this correlation is correct 
and each sequence was formed in response to glacioeustatic 
cycles of 100 kyr (Fig. 5), such as that represented in oxy-
gen isotope records where there is a downward trend from

about 400 ka (Chappell &amp;amp; Shackleton 1986, Martinson 
et al. 1987; Raymo et al. 1989; Gibbard &amp;amp; Cohen 2009).

The altitudes of relative sea-level highs defined through 
topographic measurements from this work are in accordance 
with those performed by Tomazelli and Dillenburg (2007), 
and Lopes et al. (2014). The minimum highest sea-level 
altitude estimated to System II is 9.5 ± 1 m, to System III 
is 7.7 ± 1 m, and to System IV is 3 ± 1 m. Rohling et al. 
(1998) and Rabineau et al. (2006) established magnitudes 
of lowstands to the past 500 kyr. Considering the correla-
tion with oxygen isotope stages to determine the age of 
sequences lowstand, it is possible to determine that sea level 
was more than 100 m below its current position during each 
lowstand (Fig. 5).

Analyzing the magnitude of sea-level changes and the 
time of formation of each system, it is possible to interpret 

that expressive and regional unconformities were formed 
by exposition, erosion and non-deposition, bounding the 
related sequences. Considering the maximum measured paleo 
indicator of sea-level position as the minimum altitude of 
the zero shoreline at the time of deposition of each system, 
and the age control, Systems II to IV together are progra-
dational and are at progressively lower altitudes, resulting 
in a degradational architecture.

Internally, each sequence at the onshore portion of the 
basin is formed by the record of depositional environments 
disposed in retrogradational, aggradational, progradational 
and degradational stacking (Figs. 8 to 12). The stacking 
defines system tracts and surfaces, prevailing the transgres-
sive and highstand (Fig. 12).

Quaternary depositional sequences are worldwide identi-
fied, specially related to 41 and 100 kyr glacioeustatic cycles

Figure 8. GPR sections obtained on the Barriers IV (A) and III (B). Locations are outlined on the map in Figure 4. 
Both sections are mainly composed by reflections dipping landwards associated to lagoonal (radarfacies 4a and 
4b) and aeolian systems (radarfacies 1b) retrogradation, defining transgressive systems tracts related to two 
depositional sequences (IV – section A, and III – section B). The bottom of section A is interpreted as the limit with 
older deposits related to System III, representing both a sequence boundary and transgressive surface. In section 
B, lagoon margin is covered by two phases of aeolian deposits: one is related to the evolution of System III in a 
highstand systems tract context, while the other one is related to younger loess deposition related to System IV, 
described and dated (between 30 and 10 kyr) in the area by Lopes (2013) and Lopes et al. (2016).

Figure 9. GPR sections obtained on the Barrier IV showing in the base the same type of record of Figures 8A and B, 
with landward dipping reflections representing lagoon margins (radarfacies 4a and 4b) moving to this direction. 
The shoreline landward most position related to its maximum transgression is located where reflections change 
and backshore, foreshore and upper shoreface (radarfacies 2 and 3) reflections configure barrier progradation. 
In section A, a 14C analysis determined the age of 8,320–8,070 cal yrs BP (Silva 2011). In section B, a 14C analysis 
determined the age of 7,760–7,600 cal yrs BP (Dillenburg et al. 2007). Sequence boundary is attested to sedimentary 
features interpreted as Barrier III deposits obtained in the drill holes (Silva, 2011 and Dillenburg et al. 2007). 
Sections locations are outlined on the map in Figure 4.

(Boyd et al. 1989; Saul et al. 1999; Carter &amp;amp; Naish 1998; 
Yoo &amp;amp; Park 2000; Morton et al. 2000; Blum &amp;amp; Carter

2006; Parham et al. 2007; Riboulot et al. 2012; Amorosi 
et al. 2016). However, the time of sequence formation and 
its record vary according to the factors controlling their evo-
lution. Studies developed in New Zealand, where the record 
is strongly influenced by tectonics, identified the occurrence 
of sequences with frequencies of 41 and 100 kyr developed 
during the Pliocene and Quaternary (Naish &amp;amp; Kamp 1997; 
Carter &amp;amp; Naish 1998; Saul et al. 1999; Abbott et al. 2005). 
In the Golf Coast (USA), sea-level changes are responsible 
by the formation of Quaternary sequences related to upper 
Pleistocene and Holocene (Blum et al. 2002; Blum &amp;amp; Aslan 
2006). Studying the coastal plain and incised-valleys, Blum 
et al. (2002) e Blum &amp;amp; Aslan (2006) defined depositional 
sequences related to the 100 kyr cycles, composed by low-
stand, transgressive, highstand and regressive systems tracts. 

Sequences formed in response to 100 kyr are identified as 
well in Eastern Niger submarine delta (Riboulot et al. 2012), 

In North Carolina, Parham et al. (2007) studied a drain-
age system and detected nine depositional sequences filling 
an incised-valley with ages younger than 140 ka, conclud-
ing that multiple sea-level oscillations occurred during this 
time or the area must be influenced by glacial isostatic uplift 
and subsidence.

The coastal plain of Pelotas Basin is located in the tec-
tonic context of a passive margin, thus its evolution must 
be mostly influenced by sea-level changes. As its record is 
well correlated to oxygen isotope curves, and higher fre-
quency sea-level oscillations are predicted in these curves, 
they could be recorded in the offshore portion of the basin, 
as well as a factor influencing onshore deposition. However, 
the data analyzed allow establishing only the influence of 
100 kyr glacioeustatic cycles to form the studied deposi-
tional sequences.

Figure 10. GPR sections obtained on the Barriers IV (A) and III (B). Locations are outlined on the map in Figure 4. 
Both sections are mainly composed by reflections dipping seawards associated to swales, backshore, foreshore 
and shoreface (radarfacies 1a, 5, 2 and 3) defining the progradational stacking of highstand systems tracts related 
to two depositional sequences (IV – section A, and III – section B).

Tectonic influence in the relative sea level related to those 
sequences was not determined. Nevertheless, in Central 
Patagonia (Argentina), Pappalardo et al. (2015) measured 
similar coastal landforms (beach ridges, marine terraces and 
river mouth terraces) correlating its age to marine isotope 
stages 1, 5, 7, 9 and 11. The authors attributed the eleva-
tion of landforms to sea-level rises combined with tectonic 
uplifts, with rates varying from 0,016 to 0,067 m/kyr. 
Despite uplifts is not proved for the coastal plain of Pelotas 
Basin, a tectonic influence in its sedimentary record is not 
discarded, especially for the older deposits.

System IV
As previously discussed, Barrier III is interpreted as related 

to oxygen isotope stage 5 (125 ka) and has a sea-level posi-
tion up to 7 m higher than current sea level based on the 
record of beach outcrops (Tomazelli &amp;amp; Dillenburg 2007; 
Rosa 2012). The oxygen isotope record shows a continuous 
trend of falling sea level starting in stage 5 until the Last 
Glacial Maximum (LGM) at about 20 ka. In the LGM, sea 
level is interpreted to have been situated at around 120 to 
130 m below the current position (Fairbanks 1989; Corrêa 

1995; Peltier &amp;amp; Fairbanks 2006). After the LGM, sea level 
rose at a fast rate. Along the Brazilian margin, sea level is 
interpreted to have exceeded the present level around 7.7 to 
6.9 ka, reaching its maximum at approximately 5.6 ka (Martin 
et al. 1979; Angulo &amp;amp; Lessa 1997; Bezerra et al. 2003; Caldas 
et al. 2006; Angulo et al. 2006). In Rio Grande do Sul, sea 
level is estimated to have reached from 2 to 4 m above the 
current level (Barboza &amp;amp; Tomazelli 2003; Dillenburg et al. 
2000, 2009). Since then, it would have started to fall again 
until it reaches the present level (Angulo &amp;amp; Lessa 1997; 
Angulo et al. 2006).

The formation of System IV is intrinsically related to sea-
level changes already described (Table 3 — High II). Coeval 
fluvial and estuarine deposits are present in the coastal plain 
of Rio Grande do Sul (Tomazelli et al. 2008; Weschenfelder 
et al. 2005, 2014). Tomazelli et al. (2008) detailed the evo-
lution of an incised valley in the area of Taim Swamp and 
Mirim Lagoon, located in the south region of the coastal 
plain (Fig. 4). Gravimetry and magnetometry (Rosa et al. 
2009), seismic, GPR profiles, cores and sedimentological 
analysis were integrated to understand the geometry and the 
fill of the valley. GPR and seismic profiles (Fig. 13) show

the contact between the valley bottom and System III. 14C 
age dating of shells obtained in SPT cores on the barrier 
indicates a Holocene age above this contact. The valley was 
completely filled during the Holocene, represented today 
by a swamp.

The base of this incised valley was defined as a sequence 
boundary by Tomazelli et al. (2008), separating System 
III from the valley deposits. This unconformity was inter-
preted by these authors as the sequence boundary formed 
as a consequence of the LGM. Roots from drill hole indi-
cate 14C ages of 19,550–19,270 cal yrs BP to the base of 
valley (Tomazelli et al. 2008). The lowstand system tract is 
interpreted to be related to the basal portion of the valley 
and to paleosoils and other continental correlated deposits 
beyond the coastal plain (Tomazelli et al. 2008; Rosa 2012). 
Atop the lowstand valley deposits, the transgressive surface 
is interpreted by the differentiation of filling architecture 
patterns in GPR and seismic profiles, associated to sedimen-
tological changes (Fig. 13). Into the valley, the transgres-
sive system tract is characterized by lateral accretion, related 
to the evolution of channel bars disposed in aggradational 
staking. Fluvial channel deposits are characterized by a high 
content of coarse sand. Mud lenses and biodetritical gravel 
are present too. To the top, estuarine and lagoon deposits 
were interpreted, and shells of reworked mollusks indicate 
14C ages between 8,160–7,990 and 6,820–6,640 cal yrs BP 
(Tomazelli et al. 2008).

The transgressive system tract is represented in GPR by 
landward dipping reflections of lagoonal deposits, when 
lagoonal margin migrates landwards (Fig. 8A). During 

transgression, beach face erosion caused sediment trans-
port from the barrier to the lagoons, mostly through wash-
over fans and wind. As they are below the wave level, these 
features have a higher preservation potential during barrier 
transgression. In this case, the transgressive surface and the 
sequence boundary are merged (Figs. 8A and 9).

The lagoonal radarfacies are, at some sectors of the 
coast, covered by the radarfacies of aeolian, backshore, 
foreshore and shoreface deposits, composing retrograda-
tional parasequences. The landward most beach and marine 
deposits represent the maximum shoreline transgression 
or the maximum flooding surface (Fig. 9). In other sectors 
of the coastal plain, the shoreline transgression reached 
the western continental margin of the paleo lagoons, and 
wave action sculpted scarps in Barrier III. This induced a 
significant difference in the record of transgressive system 
tract along the coast, which is represented by thin marine 
deposits in these sectors.

The age of maximum flooding surface varies along the 
coastal plain, and occurred in some sectors even before sea level 
reached its maximum elevation at about 6 ka. Silva (2011) 
obtained a 14C age of 8,320–8,070 cal yrs BP for a piece of 
wood from drill hole into the transgressive lagoonal mar-
gin deposits in the coastal plain of Santa Catarina (Fig. 9A). 
Dillenburg et al. (2006, 2007) dated preserved shells of marine 
mollusks in foreshore and shoreface deposits positioned at 
depths of 9 to 12 m. The oldest 14C ages obtained in the 
barrier progradational phase was 7,760–7,600 cal yrs BP 
(Fig. 9B) and 7,685–6,685 cal yrs BP, interpreted as close 
to the beginning of the highstand.

Figure 13. Strike seismic section of the incised valley where the sequence boundary is related to the unconformity 
between the depositional sequences of Systems III and IV. The valley fill refers to System IV, in which the main 
stratigraphic surfaces and system tracts were interpreted. The location of the section is outlined on the map in Figure 4.

Coastal embayments show a progradational stacking inter-
preted as the highstand systems tract, represented mostly by dis-
tinct strandplain morphology (Figs. 9, 10A and 14). Landward, 
the maximum flooding surface is positioned between the top 
of lagoonal and the base of beach deposits, while seaward it 
is in the shoreface deposits (Fig. 9). In most of the lagoons of 
the coastal plain, scarps were sculpted when the water level 
was higher in response to the high sea level. These scarps repre-
sent the continental record of the maximum flooding surface.

Some authors recognized progressive changes in the 
morphology and altitude of the strandplains, with fore-
dune ridges narrower and downsteping, and interpreted 
the transition from normal to forced regression (Silva 2011, 
2015; Dillenburg et al. 2006, 2009). According to models 
as the ones of Hunt and Tucker (1992), Helland-Hansen 
and Gjelberg (1994), and Plint and Nummedal (2000), 
this record could be related to the forced-regressive system 
tract. However, the basal surface of forced regression and 
the regressive surface of marine erosion are not recognized 
in most of GPR sections and cores. So the forced regression 
was only identified in some studies related to the evolution 
of Barrier IV (Dillenburg et al. 2006; Silva 2011, 2015; 
Dillenburg et al. 2017 in press).

As already observed by Tomazelli and Villwock (1989), 
Dillenburg et al. (2000, 2009), Barboza et al. (2011), Rosa 
et al. (2011), Rosa (2012), Dillenburg and Barboza (2014) 
and Barboza and Rosa (2014), the Pelotas Basin shoreline 
has sectors with different behaviors, with System IV pre-
senting synchronous progradational, aggradational and ret-
rogradational patterns along the coast.

System IV shows sectors along the coast with transgres-
sive shoreline, where GPR record exhibits landward dipping 

reflections (Fig. 8A). These sectors are located where the 
shoreline is more projected seaward (Fig. 14). In these sec-
tors, lagoonal mud and peat outcrop in the current beach 
face (Tomazelli et al. 1998; Dillenburg et al. 2004). 14C dat-
ing of these deposits indicate ages of 6,843–6,303 cal yr BP 
(Travessas et al. 2005), 4,252–4,641 cal yr BP (Tomazelli 
et al. 1998) and 3,551–2,888 cal yr BP (Dillenburg et al. 
2004), which imply that the barrier was positioned seaward 
of its present position.

Where the coastline form embayments, progradational 
stacking is observed in System IV (Fig. 14). In these sectors, 
GPR profiles show seaward dipping reflections (Fig. 10A). 
The strandplains of these areas can reach up to 15 km width 
(Dillenburg et al. 2009; Dillenburg &amp;amp; Barboza 2014). 
Aggradational behavior occurs in the transitions between 
the progradational and retrogradational sectors, mainly posi-
tioned where shoreline changes its orientation (Dillenburg 
&amp;amp; Barboza 2014).

The occurrence of different stacking patterns along the 
shoreline is interpreted to be controlled by the interaction of 
longshore currents and shoreline configuration, establishing 
local areas of erosion and deposition (Fig. 14). Main factors 
controlling the change in stacking would be wind and wave 
action, shoreline orientation and shelf slope and inner shelf 
bathymetry, as already discussed in previous studies (Toldo 
Jr. et al. 1999, 2004, 2005; Dillenburg et al. 2000, 2009; 
Martinho et al. 2009; Silva 2015; Barboza et al. 2006, 2011; 
Dillenburg &amp;amp; Barboza 2014). These factors influence and 
are recorded in even higher frequency scales, as lagoon level 
changes (Lagoa dos Patos — 300 yr), increased vegetation in 
dune fields (60 yr) and shoreline erosion (22 yr) (Table 3 – 
High III from the studies of Toldo Jr. et al. 1999, 2004,

Dillenburg et al. 2017 in press). As already observed in exper-
imental studies, the signal of autogenic processes may be pre-
served in the stratigraphic record (Paola et al. 2009; Jerolmack 

&amp;amp; Paola 2010; Straub &amp;amp; Esposito 2013; Kim et al. 2014). 
In the coastal plain of Pelotas Basin, the variability of the 
shoreline configuration, as well as the characteristics of dep-
ositional systems, is highly influenced by autogenic processes.

High-Frequency Sequences in the Pelotas Basin Quaternary



CONCLUSIONS

The performed analysis resulted in a Sequence Stratigraphic 
framework which allowed positioning the Quaternary record 
of the coastal plain of Pelotas Basin in relation to its evolu-
tion through a Sequence Stratigraphic view. Furthermore, 
the detailed analysis of System IV demonstrated the dia-
chronous nature of stratigraphic surfaces and systems tracts, 
which is related to scale issues and the relation of autogenic 
and allogenic factors controlling the stratigraphic record.

The coastal plain is mainly formed by barrier-lagoon dep-
ositional systems, here interpreted to represent the preserved, 
onshore portion of depositional sequences (Systems II, III 
and IV). GPR and elevation data of the four systems indi-
cate that they have a degradational stacking corresponding 
to a sequence set prograding and downsteping into the basin 
(Figs. 5 and 6), comprehending a degradational sequence 
set. Stacking and types of deposits are show in four sche-
matic dip sections (Fig. 12).

These sequences are interpreted to be mainly controlled 
by glacioeustatic cycles of about 100 kyr duration repre-
sented in oxygen isotope records. Higher frequency sea-
level oscillations were not detected in this studied, but could 

be recorded in the offshore portion of the basin as well as 
a factor influencing sedimentation. This record could be 
searched in future studies.

System IV shows the concomitant occurrence of pro-
gradational and retrogradational stacking along the coast. 
In some sectors, the maximum flooding surface reached its 
landward most position between 8 and 5 ka, with progra-
dation occurring afterwards associated with the highstand 
system tract. In other sectors, the stacking pattern is still 
retrogradational and the shore is still under transgression 
(Fig. 14). It demonstrates the variability of factors con-
trolling the sedimentary record. On this scale of analysis, 
coastal depositional systems behave differently at the same 
time along strike, demonstrating the importance of auto-
genic factors in its evolution.
