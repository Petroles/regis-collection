ABSTRACT
Two laboratory experiments were carried out to evaluate the effects of sugar cane straw on soil acidity. Sugar cane straw

residues were added on the surface of a Typic Harplortox in a polyvinyl chlorid (PVC) column at rates of 0, 20, 40, and 76 g kg-1, the
soil was incubated to field capacity with distilled water and incubated for 0, 7, 14, 45, and 90 days. Soil samples were taken at 0-5,
5-10, 10-15, 15-20, and 20-25 cm depth. With the increase of sugar cane straw rates one verified the increase of soil pH

CaCl2
, and

decrease of KCl exchangeable Al in the top 15cm soil layer. The contribution of organic compounds to Al detoxification incresead with
increasing sugar cane straw rates. Wheat root elongation used as acid indicator plant increased with  increasing sugar cane straw rates.
Maximum root growth  was about 15cm long in the soil after eight days for the highest sugar cane straw rate.

Index terms: Saccarum sp., plant residue, aluminun.

RESUMO
Conduziram-se dois experimentos em laboratório avaliar o efeito da palha da cana- de-açúcar na acidez do solo. A palha da

cana foi adicionada nas doses de 0, 20, 40, e 76 g kg-1 na superfície de um latossolo roxo distrófico acondicionado em colunas de PVC.
O solo foi incubado a capacidade de campo durante 0, 7, 14, 45, e 90 dias. Após cada incubação, o solo das colunas foram subdividido
e amostrado nas seguintes frações 0-5, 5-10, 10-15, 15-20, e 20-25 cm. Com o aumento da dose da palha da cana verificou-se aumento
do pH

CaCl2
 do solo e decréscimo do alumínio trocável até a camada de 15 cm de solo da coluna de PVC. A contribuição de compostos

orgânicos para a destoxificação do Al aumentou com o acréscimo das doses da palha da cana. O crescimento da raiz das plantas trigo
usadas como planta indicadora aumentou com o acréscimo das doses da palha de cana. O máximo de crescimento da raiz foi até a
camada de 15 cm de solo depois de oito dias para a maior dose de palha da cana-de-açúcar.

Termos para indexação: Saccarum sp., resíduo vegetal, alumínio, pH do solo.

Burning sugar cane straw before harvesting is a
common practice in Brazil. However, a new brazilian
legislation has been introduced to reduce burning sugar
cane and improve mechanical harvesting. It is estimated
that sugar cane residues left after mechanical harvesting
varied from 13.8 Mg ha-1y-1 dray matter (OLIVEIRA et al.,
1999) to 45 Mg ha-1y-1 fresh matter (ASGHAR &amp;amp;
KANEHIRO, 1976).

Although there are many questions about the
mangement of the sugar cane straw left after mechanical
harvesting, the greatest impact compared with burning will
be on the soil organic matter content and its implication
with soil chemical, physical, and biological properties

(MENDONZA et al., 2002). It is well stablished that organic
matter has great effect on acid soil chemistry (ASGHAR &amp;amp;
KANEHIRO, 1980; HUE, 1992; MEDA et al., 2001;
MIYAZAWA et al., 1993; POCKNEE &amp;amp; SUMNER, 1997).
Many mechanisms have been suggested to explain the
acid neutralizing capacity of the organic matter, such as:
H+ ion adsorption on the surface of organic matter (HOYT
&amp;amp; TURNER, 1975); exchangeable reaction between soil OH-

with organic anion (HUE &amp;amp; AMIEN, 1989); and reduction
reactions envolving N-cycling (HOYT &amp;amp; TURNER, 1975;
HUE, 1992). Recent reports have found that plant materials
with high basic cation contents are more efficient in
neutralizing soil acidity than those with low contents

(MIYAZAWA et al., 1993; POCKNEE &amp;amp; SUMNER, 1997).
In fact, Cassiolato et al. (2002) showed that there is a linear
relationship between soil pH and plant residue basic
cation content. However, it is accepted that the quality
of the organic matter measured as its total basic cations
is very important in the amelioration of soil acidity (MEDA
et al., 2001; SUMNER &amp;amp; PAVAN, 2000). The aim of this
study was to evaluate the influence of sugar cane straw
on   soil acidity and on wheat root elongation used as
test plant.

Sugar cane straw composed by stem and leaves
(Saccarum sp., RB85-5536 variety) was collected in the
field at Usina de Açucar &amp;amp; Alcool - Cooperativa
Agropecuária de Rolândia (COROL), in Rolândia, state of
Paraná, Brazil. Plant materials were dried at 65ºC  for 48 h,
ground to pass 1 mm sieve, stored in paper boxes, and
then used for the following chemical analysis: plant nutrient
contents (MIYAZAWA et al., 1992); basic cation excess
(PIERRE &amp;amp; BANWART, 1973); acidity neutralizing
capacity (MIYAZAWA et al., 1993); and H+ adsorption
capacity using a titration curve (YOUNG et al., 1981). The
plant extract was obtained using the procedure described
by Meda et al. (2001) and analyzed.

Soil samples taken from the 0-25 cm depth of a Typic
Harplortox (U.S. Soil Taxonomy) were air dried, ground
and passed through a 2  mm sieve. The soil had an original
pH

CaCl2 
value of 4.1;  exchangeable Ca, Mg, K, and Al

contents of 1.04, 0.43, 0.46 , and 2.2 cmol
c 
dm-3, respectively,

and total organic carbon content of 10.8 g kg-1. The clay,
silt, and sand contents were: 787.2, 65.2, and 147.6g kg-1,
respectively. Columns (305 cm3) of rigid polyvinyl chlorid
(PVC) were used. Soil samples were transferred to PVC
columns and compacted to a homogeneous bulk density
(mean of 1.0g cm-3). The sugar cane straw (1 mm sieve) was
added on the soil  surface at rates of 0, 20, 40, and 76g kg-
1 of soil. These rates were added at the amount equivalent
to neutralize KCl exchangeable Al (0.6, 1.3, and 2.5 cmol
dm-3). The soil columns were brought to field capacity with
distilled water and incubated for 0 (initial), 7, 14, 45, and 90
days. At each time, deionized water was added in as amount
equivalent to four porous volumes (122 mL per column) at
a rate of 0.5 ml min-1. Soil samples were taken at 0-5, 5-10,
10-15, 15-20, and 20-25 cm depth, air dried, ground to pass
a 2 mm sieve, and analyzed for pH

suspension, 1:2.5 soil solution ratio, 1h shaking time); KCl
exchangeable Al (1 mol L-1 KCl, 1:10 soil: solution ratio);
and CuCl

KCl was assumed to be exchangeable inorganic Al; Al-
CuCl

2
 total exchangeable Al (organic + inorganic); and (Al-

) - (Al-KCl) exchangeable organic Al.

A biological test was evaluated to verify the
capacity of sugar cane extract on acid soil amelioration
and on root elongation using wheat (Anahuac cultivar)
as indicator plant. The biological test was the same
described by Franchini et al. (2001). All treatments have
three replicates in a completly randomized block
design.

Sugar cane straw presented the following chemical
properties: organic carbon 610g kg-1; total nitrogen 71.4
cmol kg-1; base excess 200 cmol kg-1 ; total basic cations
(Ca+Mg+K) 81.2 cmol kg-1 ; and hidrogen neutralizing
capacity 33 cmol kg-1. In according with Pierre &amp;amp; Banwart
(1973) sugar cane straw is classified as high potential in
alleviating soil acidity due to its high base excess content.
The results also show that for each 100 cmol kg-1 of N
absorbed by sugar cane roots there is a base excess of 280
cmol kg-1. Thus, this sugar cane straw present higher cation
contents than inorganic anion contents. If the electrical
neutrality principle is required, the excess of cation must
be balanced with organic anions. In fact, there is a good
correlation between base excess and organic anions in
plant tissues (DEWIT et al., 1963).

The quality of sugar cane straw measured as its
acid neutralizing capacity was an important residue in the
amelioration of soil acidity after 90 days of incubation
(Table 1). Increasing sugar cane straw rates increased
pH

CaCl2 
and organic carbon up to 15 cm soil depth and

decreased KCl exchangeable acidity (H+Al) up to 25 cm
soil depth. These results confirm the high acidity
neutralizing capacity of sugar cane straw based as its high
base excess content.

Figure 1 shows the effect of sugar cane on soil
pH

CaCl2 
as functions of rates, soil depth, and incubation

time. Soil pH
CaCl2  

increased with increasing sugar cane
rates mainly in the first 7 days incubation and then
decreased with increasing time. These effects were more
evident in the 0-10 cm soil depth. Similar results were
obtained by Miyazawa et al. (1993) and Pocknee &amp;amp; Sumner
(1997) on brazilian and north american soils, respectively
with different plant materials. There are at least two effects
on soil pH: first (short time effect, 7 days) a rapid pH
increase due to mineralization of basic cations in the
organic material, high base excess, low N/basic cation
ratio and high H+ adsorption on the functional groups of
the organic compounds (RCOO- + H+ RCOO- H+); and
second (medium time effect) pH increases due to the
organic matter mineralization, where lime is liberated in
proportion to the basic cation content (POCKNEE &amp;amp;
SUMNER, 1997).

Figure 2 shows the effect of sugar cane straw on
KCl-Al as functions of rates, soil depth, and incubation
time. At the top 0-5 cm soil layer, the highest sugar cane
straw rate neutralized totally KCl-Al. Increasing sugar cane
rates decreased KCl-Al, and the effect was higher in the
begining of the experiment (0 to 7 days) than at the end (90
days) mainly in the top 15 cm soil layer. These results

support the view that complexation of Al by organic
compounds is an important reaction for decreasing Al
toxicity [3 R-COO- K+ + Al+++ ? (R-COO-)3 Al

++++ 3K+].
When the pH is above 5.2, the Al-organic complexes
precipitate as Al(OH)3. Sumner &amp;amp; Pavan (2000) explored
the more theoretical aspects of soil acidity amelioration by
organic compounds.

The role of sugar cane straw on soil reaction 2073

Table 2 shows the effect of sugar cane straw rates
on the contributions of organics and pH to Al neutralization
in soil profile. The contributions of organics and pH were
calculated as it follows:

Table 2 – Contributions of organics and pH to Al
neutralization.

Increasing sugar cane straw rates from 20 to 76 g kg-1

increased the contribution of organics to Al detoxification
up to 20cm soil depth. The contribution of organics to Al
neutralization was about 72% in the 15 – 20 cm in soil layer.
Thus, when organic strategy is adopted in sugar cane
plantation, where all trashes are left on soil surface without
burning, the organic compounds form complexes with Al.
The contribution of pH to Al detoxification increased with
decreasing sugar cane straw rates,  increasing sugar cane
straw rates from 0, 20, to 76 g kg-1 increased wheat root
elongation (indicator plant) from 3.39, 10.26 to 15.71 cm,
respectively after 8 days. As expected, wheat root growth
was due to increase soil pH and decrease KCl - Al up to 15
cm soil depth. Therefore, the organic compounds are
important in the transfer of alkalinity from top to subsoil
enhancing deeper root elongation.
