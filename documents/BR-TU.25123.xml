ABSTRACT 

 

This study refers to a qualitative and quantitative weathering characterization of a 

gneiss rock mass (weathering profile, intact rock and discontinuity) in a tropical region. 

The rock mass was excavated for a construction of an unlined railway tunnel, which 

during its useful life began to present block instability problems linked to the weathering 

and the time of exposure of the rock. 

The weathering of the rock mass and its weathering grades are approached in the 

geological and geotechnical points of view, covering bibliographical review on the 

subject, field inspection, direct and indirect investigations, and laboratory tests: 

petrographic analysis, X-ray diffraction, physical properties and durability index, 

sclerometry, ultrasonic test, uniaxial and diametral compression. 

 

Keywords: Tunnel, weathering, weathering indexes, petrographic analyses, gneiss, fall of 

blocks

Este estudo se refere à caracterização qualitativa e quantitativa do intemperismo de 

um maciço rochoso gnáissico (perfil de intemperismo, rocha intacta e descontinuidades) 

em uma região tropical. O maciço foi escavado para a construção de um túnel ferroviário 

não revestido, que ao longo da vida útil começou a apresentar problemas de instabilidade 

de blocos vinculados ao intemperismo e ao tempo de exposição da rocha. 

O intemperismo do maciço rochoso e os seus graus de alteração foram abordados 

do ponto de vista geológico e geotécnico, levando-se em consideração uma ampla revisão 

bibliográfica sobre o tema, inspeção de campo, investigações diretas e indiretas, e os 

seguintes ensaios laboratoriais: análise petrográfica, difratometria de raios X, índices 

físicos e de durabilidade, esclerometria, ultrassom,  compressão uniaxial e diametral.

1. INTRODUCTION  

 

The Monte Seco Tunnel, pertaining to the Vitória – Minas Railroad (VMR) 

responsible for the transportation of ore from the region of Belo Horizonte (BH) to Vitória 

(VT), southeast Brazil, was excavated in a gneissic rock mass. Given the favorable 

conditions at the time of the construction (1950s), neither shotcreting nor anchoring were 

used for treating the rock mass. In recent years, however, as reported by the railroad 

maintenance team, the instability of blocks in this and in other tunnels of the VMR have 

been reported. Although they do not indicate a generalized risk, this problem can cause 

severe logistic damages to cargo transport. This theme has recently motivated researchers 

from the GeoInfraUSP (EPUSP) to develop studies to evaluate the geomechanical 

behavior of the Monte Seco Tunnel. 

The block instability observed in the Monte Seco Tunnel results from several 

factors related to the tropical climate that have caused the degradation of geological-

geotechnical parameters of the rock mass, such as the joints shear strength and the intact 

rock durability and tensile strength, causing blocks to loosen from the roof and walls, 

particularly in fractured and weathered zones, making excavation unsafe over the years. 

In this manner, it is important to investigate how weathering affects certain regions of the 

tunnel and others do not. And, in the affected areas of the rock mass, to study deeply the 

rock matrix weathering process and to characterize his weathering grades. 

The study developed for this dissertation demonstrates that geological-geotechnical 

investigations, with emphasis on structural geology and rock characterization by 

petrographic analyses and laboratories test are of fundamental importance for civil 

engineering works in tropical regions, where the weathering affects in an anisotropic and 

heterogeneous way the rock mass to great depths, affecting progressively its mechanical 

properties. Besides that, the use of a standardized classification of the textural and 

micromorphological modifications of the minerals can improve the criteria among the 

engineering geologists in the petrographic weathering index analyses applied to 

weathering grades assessment. 

The fractures and foliation are the structures responsible for the weathering advance 

in the rock mass. The genesis of these structures has influence on the type and intensity 

of fracturing, in the weathering of their walls and the water infiltration along the tunnel. 

Among the analyzed sectors (A, B, C and D), which showed different weathering aspects, 



 

 

sector C, a fault zone, is the most susceptible to weathering and consequently block 

instability. 

The gneissic rock mass presents three petrographic facies B1, B2 and B3, which 

characterize the heterogeneity of the lithotype banding. The effect of the heterogeneity 

was analyzed along the weathering grades in terms of petrographic analysis, physical 

properties, durability sclerometry, ultrasonic test, uniaxial compressive strength and 

indirect tensile strength.  Comparatively to facies B1 and B2, facies B3 was placed at the 

start of the moderately weathered grade according with the weathering indexes 

considered and the related petrographic and mechanical properties. 

Among the principles minerals of the gneissic rock observed in thin sections, such 

as quartz, feldspars, biotite and garnet, the cordierite mineral is the one with the greatest 

alterability. The appearance of the Meso-alteromorph texture in the cordierite and biotite 

minerals in the weathering grades III and IV, respectively, contribute to the generation of 

intra to transmineral fissures, and the resulting changes reflects the fragility mechanism 

of the crystalline fabric, which are the major responsible for the gneissic rock mechanical 

degradation. 

The heterogeneity characterization and the relationship between petrographic and 

physical-mechanical weathering indexes of gneissic rocks are usually limited in the 

literature as well as the bond loss effects of the cordierite weathered mineral.   For these 

reasons, it's believed that this dissertation brings some pioneer aspects of the 

characterization of weathering grades of gneissic rocks.

3. CONCEPTUAL WEATHERING MODEL OF GNEISSIC ROCK MASSES 

IN TROPICAL CLIMATE CONDITIONS1  

  

Abstract 

The Monte Seco Tunnel is part of the Vitória-Minas Railway in Brazil and is used for 

transporting iron ore. It was excavated in the 1950s through a gneissic rock mass of the 

Nova Venécia Complex. Rock falls currently occur in tunnels along this railway, affecting 

ore transport logistics. Rock block falls in the Monte Seco Tunnel are controlled by 

subvertical fracturing, foliation and weathering. Fractures and foliation are the structures 

responsible for the weathering advance in the rock mass. The genesis of these structures 

influences the type and intensity of fracturing, the weathering of their walls and the water 

infiltration along the tunnel. The analyzed sectors showed different weathering aspects. 

A fault zone was identified as the most susceptible to weathering and, consequently, to 

block instability. In this paper, geological investigations that utilized geoelectrical 

imaging and 3D terrestrial laser scanning mapping, focusing on the structural geology, 

let to the development of a conceptual model of weathering advance in the Monte Seco 

Tunnel.

3.1 Introduction 

 

The Monte Seco Tunnel, of the Vitória-Minas Railway (VMR), is used to 

transport ore from the region of Belo Horizonte (BH) to Vitória (VT) in southeastern 

Brazil and was excavated in a gneissic rock of the Nova Venécia Complex (Vieira et al. 

2014). Given the favorable conditions at the time of construction (1950s), neither 

shotcrete nor anchoring were used for treating the rock mass. In recent years, however, 

the instability of blocks in this and in other tunnels of the VMR has been reported by the 

railroad maintenance team. Although they do not indicate a generalized risk, this problem 

can cause severe damage to cargo transport logistics. This issue has recently motivated 

researchers from the GeoInfraUSP (EPUSP) to develop studies to evaluate the 

geomechanical behavior at the site laboratory of the Monte Seco Tunnel (Cacciari et al. 

2013; Monticeli et al. 2015; Cacciari and Futai 2016, 2017). 

The block instability observed in the Monte Seco Tunnel results from several 

factors related to the tropical climate and have caused degradation of geological and 

geotechnical parameters of the rock mass, such as the shear strength of the joints and the 

durability and tensile strength of the intact rock, causing blocks to loosen from the roof 

and walls over the last several years, particularly in fractured and weathered zones, 

making the tunnel potentially unsafe. Hence, a detailed study of the geological 

characteristics that have influenced the weathering evolution in the tunnel is fundamental 

to re-evaluating the rock mass behavior. 

The weathering of rock masses is widely recognized to depend on intrinsic factors, 

such as the nature of the rock, and extrinsic factors, such as the climate, topography, time 

of exposure and geotectonic evolution. The climate influence is manifested via the 

oscillation of temperature and rainfall, which is the most influential factor that determines 

the type and intensity of weathering processes. The topography controls the infiltration 

and drainage of rainwater along weathering profiles, causing erosion and deposition. The 

rock mass is more or less resistant to physical and chemical processes according to its 

genesis and geological history. In addition to lithology, another important geological 

aspect is the presence of certain structures, such as fractured and faulted zones (Saunders 

and Fookes 1970; Deere and Patton 1971; Dearman et al. 1978). 

Geological structures, i.e., fissures, fractures, fault zones, geological contacts, and 

foliation, which result from the evolution of geotectonic regimes in geological history, 



27 

 

are the link that connect weathering agents from the surface with the deepest portions of 

the rock masses, promoting the variation in the weathering profile sequence and geometry 

and the building of landscape features (Delvigne 1998; Modenesi-Gauttieri et al. 2002; 

Turkington et al. 2005; Place et al. 2016). This connection could even be related to 

endogenous processes (Dewandel et al. 2017), which are more significant at greater 

depths in underground excavations. 

The genesis of the rock mass, chronology of the structures present, and in situ 

stress fields are relevant aspects in the weathering advance to the subsurface, as the flow 

of water, the main weathering agent, is governed by the opening of discontinuities in 

fractured crystalline rock masses (Freeze and Cherry 1979). The crosscutting of fractures 

and the current stress field could induce reactivation of certain discontinuity sets, which 

leads to displacement and dilation. The increase in aperture would consequently increase 

transmissivity along specific paths in the fracture network (Barton et al. 1995; Ferrill et 

al. 1999; Konzuk and Kueper 2004; Morin and Savage 2003), influencing the weathering 

pattern in the subsurface and spatial variation in the weathering profiles. Differences in 

weathering intensity with geological time may also influence the change in hydraulic 

conductivity of weathering profile horizons (Lachassagne and Wyns 2011). 

A rock mass undergoes specific geotectonic regimes throughout its history, which 

could promote the development of a complex weathering pattern that is structurally 

controlled in the subsurface. This pattern is not usually considered in the main 

classification models of weathering profiles applied to engineering geology. To 

characterize weathering in the subsurface, it is fundamental to characterize the 

conditioning properties at different scales and under different points of view, gathering 

detailed and varied information about weathering advance and evolution (Ehlen 2005). 

In this article, information on the genesis of geological structures, weathering 

profiles, and weathering along discontinuity walls in a study area is collected and 

compared with discontinuity and signal return intensity (or backscatter) maps from 

terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) point clouds and geoelectrical imaging profiles in the 

same area. In this case, it was possible to correlate the genesis of geological structures 

with the fracture intensity observed along the tunnel, the moisture identified on the walls 

and roof, the geoelectrical anomalies and the weathering conditions of the discontinuity 

walls, allowing for a better understanding of the preferred weathering paths and, 



 

 

consequently, the advance of weathering profiles and patterns inside the Monte Seco 

Tunnel. 

The data interpretation indicated that the tunnel has four sectors, A, B, C and D, 

with different weathering aspects. The weathering advanced via F1 and F2 discontinuity 

sets in sectors A and C and via foliation Sn in sector B, while sector D does not exhibit 

weathering agents. The F2 discontinuity set of Precambrian age was reactivated during 

the Cretaceous, forming a fault zone identified in sector C. Neotectonism (Cenozoic) is 

responsible for the change in the drainage pattern in the study area and for originating F1 

discontinuity set, which currently controls water infiltration in sectors A and C. The sheet 

fractures are closely related to opening along foliation Sn in the tunnel site and transport 

weathering agents in sector B. These geologic features trigger the destabilization of rock 

blocks that impact iron ore transport logistics of the VMR. 

 

3.2 Geological settings 

 

The regional study of the structural geology covered the main tectonic events that 

occurred in the study area. The photointerpretation of the regional structural framework 

of the basement was carried out using Quantum GIS software, connecting the domains of 

Folha Aracruz (SE-24-Y-D-IV) and Colatina (SF-24-Y-C-VI) (Figure 3.1). The final 

product, represented at a 1:100.000 scale, used 2.666 km2 of aerial photos to obtain the 

trace lineaments. 

The Monte Seco Tunnel was excavated in a gneissic rock of the Nova Venécia 

Complex in the northern portion of the Mantiqueira Province (Araçuaí fold belt system), 

on the Brazilian Atlantic coast (Figure 3.1 A) (Almeida et al. 1981; Pedrosa-Soares et al. 

2001). The overall geology and structural framework of this province is related to the 

Brasiliano orogenic cycle, which includes a succession of accretionary and collisional 

episodes that were mainly active during the Proterozoic to Paleozoic and were responsible 

for the creation of Gondwanaland (Brito Neves and Fuck 2013). Lineaments associated 

with shear zones are well recognized in the study area and are marked by the change in 

orientation from NE and NNE in the Ribeira domain to N-S and NNW in the Araçuaí 

domain (Braun 1982).

Figure 3.1 - Site of the Monte Seco Tunnel. Southeast Brazil (A), Colatina Lineament Domain (B) and in 

detail, the local geological map (C) (modified from Vieira et al. 2014). 

  

This structural rearrangement is related to the Vitória Ecoporanga Shear Zone 

(VESZ), locally named the Colatina Lineament, a NNW-trending network of fractures, 

faults and shear zones that crosses the state of Espírito Santo from Vitória to Atelia, 

totaling 280 km in length (Vieira et al. 2014). These are the main structures that 

characterize the Monte Seco Tunnel area (Figure 3.1 B). The crystalline basement of the 

study area consists mainly of Neoproterozoic rocks (Precambrian), including highly 

deformed gneissic rocks of the Nova Venécia Complex in contact with syn-collisional 

granitoids due to tectonic movement. Cambrian rocks are also present and consist of a 

variety of post-collisional granitoids of Paleozoic age, sedimentary deposits of the 

Barreiras Formation, and alluvial, colluvial and coastal deposits of Cenozoic age (Figure 

3.1 C). Mesozoic magmatism is represented by dike swarms that rarely outcrop in the 

study area and are therefore not shown in our maps. 



 

 

The geological and structural evolution of this area is marked by a series of 

deformation phases and structural reactivations accompanied by magmatic episodes, 

periods of denudation and erosion, seismicity and intraplate activity, some of which are 

well-established and some of which are still controversial. Regionally, 299 lineaments 

were identified and are represented in the map in Figure 3.2A. The lineament attitudes 

and lengths were measured, resulting in the principal orientations WNW, NNW, NNE, 

ENE and E-W (Figure 3.2B and C). The Monte Seco Tunnel was previously investigated 

by field measurements, and three discontinuity sets and gneissic foliation were recognized 

(Figure 3.3) (Cacciari and Futai, 2017). 

The NNW lineaments stand out in the study area because of their frequency and 

length; similarly, the WNW and NNE trends are less distinctive yet also stand out. 

However, only the NNW-trending lineaments result in a significant expression in the 

tunnel structural mapping. Foliation and F2 discontinuity set show the same trend of the 

regional NNW lineaments, which correspond to the regional-scale trend from the 

Neoproterozoic to the Paleozoic. Ductile structures, such as the gneissic foliation, formed 

during the Brasiliano/Pan-African orogenic cycle, and the brittle structures formed after 

the lateral shift of the orogeny in the early Cambrian (Alkmim et al. 2006; Vieira et al. 

2014). 

According to Valente et al. (2012), the set of fractures NNW mapped in Suite 

Atelia as a dextral transtensional strike-slip fault zone that originated in the Brasiliano 

(represented in orange in Figure 3.1C) was reactivated by a brittle and extensional regime 

early in the Cretaceous. This was accompanied by the intrusion of small-scale dike 

swarms dated to 136 Ma. The Monte Alegre alignment (AFZ) fracture set, whose genesis 

is connected to the Colatina Lineament located S of Vitória (capital of the state of Espírito 

Santo), shows features that indicate assimilation of the tectonic movements, reactivating 

some of these structure planes as NNW-SSE normal faults (Calegari et al. 2016). The 

reactivations and dike intrusions that occurred preferentially along the Precambrian 

structures of the Colatina Lineament are interpreted as analogous to the dike swarms of 

the Ponta Grossa Arch in southern Brazil: the result of an aulacogen or aborted rift related 

to the opening of the Atlantic Ocean in the Cretaceous (Sial et al. 1987; Novais et al. 

2004; Vieira et al. 2013). 

The ENE and EW lineaments are less significant in frequency and length at a 

regional scale, showing approximately the same trend of the F1 discontinuity set in the 



31 

 

Monte Seco Tunnel (Figures 3.2 and 3.3). F1 discontinuity set is a transversal structure 

relative to foliation and F2 discontinuity set, showing angular relations and geometric 

patterns of conjugate pairs of shear joints with extension cracks, and are related to a 

normal fault in an extensional regime. Thus, these discontinuities probably initiated in the 

Cretaceous in brittle and extensional regimes. However, the ENE and EW lineaments 

have been considered to be related to the evolution of the Brazilian Continental Coastal 

Basins and resurgent tectonics, which started in the Paleogene and has been continually 

active during the Neogene and the Holocene. Such lineaments correspond to the initial 

phase of the neotectonic intraplate activity in Brazil, as registered by the initial deposition 

of the Barreiras Formation (Hasui 1990). 

 

Figure 3.2 - Mapping of lineament traces (A), rose diagram and identification of main sets of lineaments 

traces (B), and histogram of respective lengths in km (C). 

 

Some of the NE- to ENE-trending normal faults of southeastern Brazil, recognized 

by Riccomini et al. (1989) and Riccomini and Assumpção (1999), are associated with a 

distensional tectonic event whose minor tensile axis is oriented along the NW-SE 

quadrant. The normal faults in the weathered basement rock, as observed by Calegari et 



 

 

al. (2016), and in the superficial deposits, as observed by Mello et al. (2005) and 

Hatushika et al. (2005), were related to this stress state, in accordance with the orientation 

of F1 fractures in the Monte Seco region. 

F3 discontinuity set, with no superficial expression due to its low dip angles, 

terminates at both the F1 and F2 structures, sometimes crossing them, as noticed during 

field inspections at the tunnel site. F3 is considered to be a set of sheet fractures related 

to the aperture of the foliation as a consequence of the hilly topography of the area.

pole concentrations (B) and rose diagram (C) of the geological structures. 

 

The geological structural characteristics formed a relief composed of hills and 

slopes with pronounced declivities along valleys structurally controlled by regional NNW 

lineament traces. The shape of the outcropping rock is that of a sugarloaf and has been 

affected by weathering and gravitational pluvial events, causing the valleys to be filled 

with varied materials from the hills. ENE-trending drainage leads superficial water 



33 

 

toward the valleys (Baltazar et al. 2010) (Figure 3.4).

Monte Seco site. The Vitória-Minas Railroad (VMR) and the local highway (BR 101) are represented by 

red and black lines, respectively. 

 

Climatic conditions control the intensity of weathering on the surface. 

Disaggregation and decomposition of the rock mass are mainly influenced by temperature 

and rainfall. In the study area, seasonal rainfall varies from 100 to 120 cm in the summer 

and from 50 to 20 cm in the winter, and the average daily varies from 28 to 26 °C in the 

summer and 22 to 20 °C in the winter. According to Dearman et al. (1978), the climate is 

tropical, with clear contrasts between the dry and rainy seasons, characterizing a physical-

chemical weathering intensity that varies from moderate to very slight (Figure 3.5). 

It is important to consider the effect of the foliation of the gneissic rock mass 

according to two main factors: (i) the compositional variation in the lithology, which 

depends on the banding and the presence of micas in the foliation plane; and (ii) the 

orientation of the foliation, which controls the weathering advance in the subsurface 

(Dobereiner et al. 1993; Le Pera et al. 2001; Marques et al. 2010; Borreli et al. 2014; 

Regmi et al. 2014).

(blue) (modified after Dearman et al. 1978). 

 

In relation to the alterability of the intact gneissic rock, this rock can be considered 

equivalent to an acidic (high SiO2 content) igneous rock that is more resistant than 

intermediate and ultrabasic igneous rocks to weathering in tropical environments. 

However, the variation in composition of a gneissic rock caused by banding can create 

differences in alterability along the rock mass. The heterogeneity of the intact gneissic 

rock of the Monte Seco Tunnel region is shown in Figure 3.6. 

 

Figure 3.6 - Classification of heterogeneity in petrographic facies B1, B2 and B3 for the gneissic rock of 

the Monte Seco Tunnel. 

 

The geological-geotechnical surveys, terrestrial laser scanning mapping, electrical 

resistivity investigations and rotary drilling took place during an intense rainy season that 

lasted from February to April. Therefore, the information obtained refers to conditions 



35 

 

under which the rock mass undergoes considerable water percolation and infiltration. 

 

3.3 Terrestrial laser scanning analyses 

 

TLS was used for discontinuity mapping and analysis along the Monte Seco 

tunnel, aiming to obtain the discontinuity geometrical parameters necessary for stability 

analyses (Cacciari and Futai 2016, 2017). Along the tunnel, 324 m was fully scanned, 

mapped and analyzed by Cacciari and Futai (2017). The authors were able to quantify the 

discontinuity volumetric intensity (P32) continuously along the tunnel for each fracture 

set (F1, F2 and F3) by using automatic window sampling methods and discrete fracture 

networks (DFNs). P32 is defined as the total discontinuity area per unit volume of rock 

mass. Figure 3.7 shows the orientation data from TLS mapping and some examples of 

discontinuities that were apparent on the tunnel point cloud. 

The scanner used was a Faro Focus 3D (Faro Technologies Inc.), which has a data 

acquisition rate of approximately 106 points/s. The output of TLS is a dense point cloud 

composed of the Cartesian coordinates and signal return intensity (SRI) of each point. 

The SRI varies with the color, texture and moisture of the scanned surfaces (tunnel 

surface). 

During field and TLS inspections, water inflow and wet rock surfaces were 

identified in three different sectors of the tunnel, named A (0-15 m), B (60-90 m) and C 

(110-130 m). Figure 3.8A shows TLS point cloud cuts from these sections, in which the 

darkest regions highlighted are wet. In sectors A and C, the water inflow occurs via F1 

and F2 discontinuity sets, respectively, while in sector B, the water inflow occurs via 

foliation Sn. Sector D, from 160 m forward, remains free from the action of weathering 

agents and is thus used comparatively to further guide the interpretations. 

The distribution of the volumetric fracture intensity of the discontinuity sets in the 

rock mass of the Monte Seco Tunnel are shown in Figure 3.8B. 

The values of P32 related to water inflow for F1 and F2 discontinuity sets are 1.3 

and 0.9 1/m, respectively, in sector A and 1.5 1/m within the entire studied rock mass. 

Sector B, with P32 values slightly lower than those of sector A, presents water inflow 

conditioned by a specific plane of gneissic foliation that intercepts the tunnel over 30 m. 



 

 

In sector C, the F2 P32 peaks on the order of 3.0 1/m, followed by that of F1, with peaks 

between 1.5 and 2.0 1/m. This sector can be treated as a singular region of the rock mass 

or a fault zone, where the water inflow is clearly structurally controlled by these 

discontinuity sets. Sector D presents high values of P32 that are lower than those of sector 

C; such high values could thus be related to water inflow, as in sector A. However, this 

sector (D) remains dry, free from weathering agents.

concentrations (B) and rose diagram obtained (C) of the geological structures (modified after Cacciari and

3.4 Weathering profile 

  

From the results of the indirect and direct investigations carried out at the study 

site, the weathering characterization of discontinuity walls and the conceptual model of 

weathering advance in the Monte Seco Tunnel region are presented below. 

 

  



 

 

Indirect and direct investigations 

 

The indirect and direct investigations at the Monte Seco Tunnel site consisted of 

eight geoelectrical profiles (GPs 1-8) and three drilling boreholes (SR-01, SR-02 and SR-

03) (Figure 3.9). The weathering profile characterization was compared to the slope 

weathering profile of Deere and Patton (1971). 

Geoelectrical imaging profile 1 was positioned above the drilling boreholes SR-

02 and SR-03 to identify the electrical resistivities associated with the direct sampling of 

the weathering horizons. The interpreted geotechnical profile from SR-01, -02 and -03 

and the corresponding geoelectrical resistivity of GP 1 are presented in Figure 3.10. GPs 

2 to 7 were used to identify the geoelectrical anomalies related to fracture intensity, 

moisture presence and weathering profile pattern changes along the tunnel region and are 

presented in Figure 3.11. The steep valley on the tunnel site hindered positioning the 

geoelectrical imaging profiles perpendicular to the tunnel axis. Nevertheless, it was 

possible to include GP 8, which was positioned above an intensely fractured zone 

observed inside the tunnel (Figure 3.12). 

 

 

Figure 3.9 - Location of the first 340 m of the Monte Seco tunnel and geotechnical investigation 

performed at tunnel site (Cacciari and Futai 2016). 

 



39 

 

 

The local weathering profile consists of three weathering horizons: I – transported 

soil, II – very to moderately weathered rock, and III – weakly weathered rock (Figures 

3.10 and 3.11). 

Horizon I contains soil and various sizes of rock blocks that are partly weathered. 

The transported soil that covers the rock mass is characterized as an orange to reddish 

silty sand. In the electrical resistivity investigations, the soil is distinguished by its low 

resistivity, which is less than 750 Ohm.m, with respect to the higher resistivities 

interpreted as rock blocks with different weathering grades. 

Horizon II is associated with an abrupt change in resistivity from 700 to 1700 

Ohm.m; in the drilling boreholes, it is associated with fractured and weathered zones 

presenting mineral discoloration, iron oxide and hydroxide impregnation, and weakened 

structure, due to its relatively easy fracturing under hammer blows. 

 

 

Figure 3.10 - Geotechnical profile from SR-01, 02 and 03, the correspondent geoelectrical profile 1 and 

the drilling boreholes illustrating the contrast between the weathering horizon along the valley. 

 

Horizon III is defined by its high resistivity (higher than 1700 Ohm.m) and by the 

visual and tactile characteristics of a fresh to slightly weathered rock. In this horizon, only 

the discontinuity walls show significant weathering, as observed in the drilling boreholes. 

The thickness of horizon I varies from 20 to 30 m in the valley and decreases 



 

 

significantly with a higher incidence of rock blocks toward the slope face, where an abrupt 

contact between horizons I and III is found. This trend was also noticed in the outcrops 

close to the Monte Seco Tunnel site (Figure 3.13). The absence of intermediate horizons 

and the development of horizon II, whose thickness varies from a few centimeters to a 

few meters, is related to the environmental conditions, the presence of fractures and the 

orientation of the foliation. 

The foliation dips subparallel to the slope of the hillside. Despite the downward 

flow of water, in a nonfractured portion of the rock mass, the weathering front cannot 

advance. However, an increase in the subvertical fracturing related to F1 and F2 increases 

the volume of rock in contact with weathering agents, consequently developing a very to 

moderately weathered rock mass. 

The interpretation of the top of the bedrock, the contact between horizon I and 

horizons II-III, and the low-resistivity anomalies related to the fractured zones, inflow 

and weathering around the Monte Seco Tunnel were highlighted in the geoelectrical 

profiles (Figures 3.11 and 3.12). The low-resistivity anomaly identified in GP 2 is 

associated with the E-W drainage, leading to water inflow into sector A. The low-

resistivity anomalies identified in GPs 4, 5 and 7 are associated with sector D and with 

the E-W drainage. In contrast the drainage in to sector A, that in sector D does not lead to 

water inflow into sector D, which indicates a lack of interconnection of the discontinuity 

sets from 160 m forward. The low-resistivity anomalies identified in GP 3 are related to 

sectors B and C, where the water inflow is controlled by the foliation and by the fault 

zone, respectively. This fault zone is more clearly identifiable in GP 8, where the 

geometry of the low-resistivity anomaly is structurally controlled by discontinuity set F2. 

Notably, there is no drainage related to sectors B and C (Figure 3.9). In sector B, 

the direction of the water inflow follows the dip of the bedrock, whereas in sector C, it 

follows the dip of discontinuity set F2.

Weathering of discontinuity walls 

 

The weathering condition of the discontinuity walls was characterized by tactile 

and visual features using drilling boreholes. Parameter Ja, the “joint weathering number”, 

defined in the geomechanical classification system of rock masses known as the Q System 

(Barton et al. 1974), is treated as a key parameter in this study because it allows for fast 

assessment of the relative aperture of discontinuities related to the changes induced by 

tectonic stresses and rock mass weathering. 

Parameter Ja is subdivided into three categories according to the width of the 



43 

 

discontinuity, the relative degree of displacement between the walls, the tactile and visual 

features (Table 3.1). Additionally, thin sections were described to compare the mineral 

conditions at the surface of the discontinuity sets. The thin sections were collected parallel 

to the discontinuity wall. The discontinuity walls were sampled at the weathering front of 

the rock mass (horizon III) by cutting a thin layer of rock from the discontinuity plane. 

The information obtained was correlated with the apparent physical indexes, in 

accordance with International Society for Rock Mechanics (ISRM) procedures (ISRM, 

1979). 

The most representative samples showing the weathering along discontinuity 

walls and the differences in the petrographic characteristics are shown in Figure 3.14. The 

Ja classification and the physical properties of the samples, denoted D1 to D13, are 

presented in Table 3.2. 

F1 and F3 discontinuity sets, as well as the foliation planes that split during core 

drilling, are characterized as rock-wall contacts with no relative displacement between 

the walls. The F1 samples showed higher residual friction angles then the foliation 

samples, which showed lower angles due to weathering increasing. The F2 discontinuity 

set also showed weathering aspects, such the thin fillings and rock-wall contacts with less 

than 10 cm of relative displacement (Table 3.2). 

The walls of F1 discontinuity set are usually unaltered but slightly stained and 

present stretch marks. The petrographic analysis revealed a thin edge of intra- to 

transmineral unfilled fissures parallel to the discontinuity wall (Figure 3.14A). On the 

other hand, the walls of F2 discontinuity set (Figure 3.14B) and the foliation (Figure 

3.14C) exhibit more advanced weathering grades, marked by coatings and stained and 

weakly weathered minerals: in the thin sections, a greater thickness of the fissure 

microsystem and stronger weathering of the wall minerals are observed. In these 

locations, the intra- to transmineral fissures are impregnated with iron oxides and 

hydroxides, and the original minerals are replaced with carbonate and clay minerals 

(pinite, chlorite and sericite). 

F2 samples D5 and D7 and foliation sample D13 have notable weathering 

intensities (Table 3.2). 



 

 

Sample D7 has well-consolidated fillings consisting of iron oxides and hydroxides 

and clay mineral coatings, indicating connections between discontinuities along the 

weathering profile. These connections can be related to the tectonic reactivation event 

that could have promoted an increase in fracture intensity and a significant displacement 

and dilation, increasing the discontinuity aperture and water flow, consequently 

weathering the walls and filling the apertures with secondary products. 

The most susceptible minerals to weathering occur in bands through the intact 

rock; in this case, cordierite is replaced by pinite, chlorite and iron oxides and hydroxides 

(Figure 3.14). 

This weathering path may reach significant distances, as shown in sample D13, 

where the presence of a weathered band composed of carbonate and clay minerals in the 

foliation plane caused fracturing when the rock was drilled from a previously intact 

portion of the rock mass. It is possible that a conductivity fracture is present nearby, 

providing water that weathered the rock, but was not sampled by drilling. Alternatively, 

the weathering may have occurred along specific planes of the foliation due to the 

complexity of the gneissic banding of the rock mass, constituting a significant subsurface 

weathering path that depends on the rock structure and composition. 

Despite the limited number of discontinuity samples from the drilling cores, the 

foliation and discontinuity set F2 can be classified as advanced weathered, as observed 

by its tactile and visual features and the high apparent porosity and respective low average 

residual friction angle estimated by parameter Ja (Figure 3.15). In this interpretation, the 

high secondary porosity is assumed to be only related to the weathering of the thin layer 

of rock on the discontinuity wall. Among the physical properties, the residual friction 

angle against the porosity presented the highest coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.85) 

(Figure 3.15). 

This correlation may indicate unfavorable geological structures through the 

geomechanical classification applied to drilling boreholes and could be used as additional 

information to characterize the weathering of discontinuity sets.

Conceptual model of weathering advance in the Monte Seco Tunnel region 

 

The comparison of P32 (F1+F2+F3) between the tunnel, surface and bedrock 

topographies and the occurrence of water inflow and its probable flow direction are 

presented in Figure 3.16, in which sectors A, B, C and D are indicated. The data gathered 

indicate five conditioning agents: (i) water inflow via fractures and foliation; (ii) rock 

cover and (iii) P32, which were correlated with the (iv) genesis of the geological structures 

and (v) weathering of discontinuity walls. The discrimination of these sectors and the 

following comments helped elucidate the conceptual model of weathering advance at this 

site, as presented in Figure 3.17. 

The genesis of the foliation and the F2 discontinuity set is related to the Brasiliano 

orogenic cycle, the ductile-brittle regime active during the formation of the gneissic 

crystalline basement from the Neoproterozoic to the Paleozoic. F2 discontinuity set 

consists of fractures from the NNW-trending structural lineament set of the Colatina 

Lineament. At the regional scale, the most persistent fractures were reactivated as normal 

faults or were intruded by dikes in a distensional and brittle regime during Pangea 

fragmentation and opening of the South Atlantic Ocean in the beginning of the Cretaceous 

(Figures 3.1-3 and 3.7). Sector C may have been tectonically affected during this event, 

thus forming a fault zone, which is an intensely fractured region (Figures 3.16 and 3.17), 

where some structural planes were displaced in relation to others at different intensities. 

This movement is corroborated by the presence of thick weathering on the walls of F2 

discontinuity set, as seen in the drill cores (Table 3.2 and Figure 3.14). 

Among the stress states during the end of the Pleistocene and beginning of the 

Holocene (Cenozoic), the NW-SE-trending distensional regime is related to the 

emergence of F1 discontinuity set at the local scale (Figures 3.1-3 and 3.7). This trend is 

responsible for the formation of E-W- and ENE-trending normal faults, identified in the 

weathering soil of the Barreiras Formation and in superficial deposits. 

In certain cases, F1 discontinuity set overlapped F2 discontinuity set, increasing 

the fracture intensity of the rock mass, as observed in sectors A and D and more intensely 

in sector C (Figure 3.8). In the weathering profile, the presence of these discontinuities 

(F1 and F2) is correlated with the development of horizon II, which promotes the 

connection between weathering horizons I and III, transporting the weathering agents to 

the intact rock mass (Horizon III) (Figures 3.10 and 3.17). In sectors A and C, which have 



49 

 

less rock cover than sector D, this connection could be identified by the geoelectrical 

anomalies and TLS analysis results (Figures 3.8, 3.16 and 3.17) inside the tunnel. 

Moreover, the last in situ stress state related to the genesis of F1 discontinuity set 

influenced the preferential water flow direction driving the weathering agents through 

this fracture system. The unusual degree of weathering of the F1 walls highlights that this 

weathering event was younger and less intense than that evidenced along F2 discontinuity 

set, which is intensely weathered (Table 3.2 and Figure 3.14). 

F3 discontinuity set, related to denudation and uplift of the rock mass, formed 

following the topography and the gneissic foliation (Figures 3.3, 3.4 and 3.7). The 

foliation, parallel to the hillside, influenced the genesis of these discontinuities, which are 

structurally related to the anisotropy of the rock mass. In sector B, which is only slightly 

fractured, the water infiltration along 30 m of a specific foliation plane (Sn) may be 

related to overlapping of the relief fractures (F3) (Figure 3.8). 

In sector D, there is no interference of weathering in the tunnel, probably because 

it is thicker than other sectors and has a lack of connections between fractures (Figures 

3.8, 3.11, 3.16 and 3.17). The conditioning agents of the weathering advance in the Monte 

Seco Tunnel are briefly summarized in Table 3.3, in which sector C is indicated as the 

highest susceptibility to weathering and, consequently, to tunnel instability.

3.5 Conclusions 

 

The overall geology and structural framework of the Monte Seco Tunnel site is 

related to the Brasiliano orogenic cycle (Proterozoic to Paleozoic), which is characterized 

by a succession of accretionary and collisional episodes. Locally, these deformational 

events generated the structural fabric of the gneissic rock mass, resulting in four 

discontinuity sets: F1, F2, F3 and Sn. 

Foliation and F2 discontinuity set show the same trend as the regional NNW 

lineaments, which corresponds to the regional-scale trend from the Neoproterozoic to the 

Paleozoic. F1 discontinuity set shows the same trend of regional ENE and E-W 

lineaments, which corresponds to the initial phase of the intraplate neotectonic activity in 

Brazil (started in the Paleogene and continued during the Neogene and the Holocene). 

F1, F2, F3 and Sn were mapped both by manual fieldwork and by TLS point 

clouds (in detail), and the results are similar between these methods. The reactivation of 

F2 during the Cretaceous created the fault zone in sector C, clearly observed from the 

TLS mapping due to the abrupt P32 increase in this portion of the tunnel. This fracture set, 

associated with F1, controls the water inflow in sectors A and C, as confirmed by the high 

electrical conductivity of these sections observed on the geoelectrical profiles. In sector 

B, a persistent and permeable foliation plane is responsible for the water inflow and, 

consequently, the high conductivity, as F1 and F2 showed low intensity in this section. 

Because of the aforementioned water inflow, the weathering advanced via F1 and 

F2 discontinuity sets in sectors A and C and via foliation Sn in sector B, while no 

weathering agents were observed in sector D. However, the watering grade of F2 and Sn 

is much higher than that of F1. As identified by the Ja parameter, the residual friction is 

considerably reduced by weathering, compromising the strength of these discontinuities 

and the overall quality of the rock mass. 

From the conceptual weathering model presented herein, sectors A and C should 

be studied in detail for different reasons: Sector C represents the lowest rock mass quality 

due to its high fracture intensity (F2 fault zone), presence of water (TLS images and 

geoelectrical profiles) and, consequently, high weathering potential. Sector A shows a 

much lower fracture intensity than that of sector C but also shows the presence of water 



53 

 

 

 

 

and is extremely shallow (close to horizons II and I); thus, it also has a high weathering 

potential.

(SDT) and the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of three petrographic facies from a gneissic 

rock mass excavated for a railway tunnel without lining, which has presented problems of 

instability of blocks due to long term exposition to weathering. The characterization of the 

gneissic rock matrix was made tactile visually and by means of microscopical petrography, 

combining the tests of physical properties, SDT, UCS with weathering indexes. It is argued, 

particularly, for the importance of describing the heterogeneity of the gneissic rock to interpret 

its influence in geotechnical parameters. The interpretation of the results indicates that the rock 

being studied presents one facies with greater susceptibility to weathering, loss of strength and 

durability. This study also proposes an equation to access the alterability parameter, recently 

added in the 2014 update of the Rock Mass Rating (RMR), which may be overvalued to 

crystalline rocks, as observed in the analysis.

4.1 Introduction 

 

The Monte Seco Tunnel, pertaining to the Vitória-Minas Railroad (VMR), responsible 

for the transportation of ore from the region of Belo Horizonte (BH) to Vitória (VT), southeast 

Brazil, was excavated in a gneissic rock of the Nova Venecia Complex (Vieira et al. 2014) 

(Figure 4.1). Given the very favorable stability conditions of the rock at the time (decade of 

1950), neither shotcrete nor bolts were used to treat the rock, but, in the last years, as reported 

by the railroad maintenance team, problems of instability of blocks in this and other tunnels of 

the VMR have been noticed. Although they do not indicate a generalized risk, these problems 

can cause severe logistic damages in cargo transport. This theme has recently motivated 

researchers from the GeoInfraUSP of the Department of Geotechnical Engineering of the 

EPUSP to develop several studies to evaluate the geomechanical behavior of the Monte Seco 

Tunnel (Cacciari et al. 2013; Monticeli et al. 2015; Monticeli et al. 2016; Cacciari and Futai, 

2017). 

The block instability observed in the Monte Seco Tunnel results from several factors 

associated with the tropical climate that, through the years, caused the degradation of 

geological-geotechnical parameters of the rock mass, causing blocks to loosen from the tunnel 

roof and walls, particularly in fractured and weathered zones, turning excavation unsafe through 

the years. In this manner, the detailed study of modifications in the characteristics of 

heterogeneous rocks, such as gneissic rocks, in different weathering grades, has proved to be 

fundamental for reevaluating rock mass behavior. 

In the present article information is collected regarding the durability of the gneissic rock 

matrix, aiming at a better comprehension of the intact rock disaggregation in the Monte Seco 

Tunnel. The effect of the heterogeneity of the rock, classified according to petrographic facies, 

is analyzed in terms of the petrographic analysis, physical properties, uniaxial compressive 

strength (UCS) and durability along weathering grades, indicating in which cases the rock 

matrix would be more susceptible to disaggregation and loss of strength. In general, the 

classification of gneissic rocks in terms of their heterogeneity and their geotechnical behavior 

when affected by weathering, which are the motivation of this study, are themes not usually 

seen in the literature. Despite of the influence of the foliation in the UCS tests and the strength 



61 

 

 

 

of rock wedges and blocks, this study does not address it directly in its relation to the 

heterogeneity of the gneissic rocks. 

This study also proposes an equation to quantify the alterability parameter as an 

alternative to the procedures presented in the recent update of the RMR system (Celada et al. 

2014). The necessity of RMR adaptations in engineering is a common practice to manage 

specific geological conditions, particularly in tropical environments such as Southeast Brazil 

(Santos et al. 2012; Amaral Junior et al. 2016).

4.2 UCS and SDT in RMR 2014 update  
 

The uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) is widely used in rock mechanics and is 

considered a major parameter in the RMR classification system (Bieniawski, 1989) and was 

kept essentially in the same way in the RMR 2014 update (Celada et al. 2014). On the other 

hand, the slake durability test (SDT) has been used with great success in the study of tunnels, 

seeking the prediction of the mechanical behavior of the substrate in certain geological 

conditions, in which the rock is prone to disaggregation and expansion when absorbing water 

or being exposed in the excavation front (Franklin and Chandra, 1972). Recently, because of 

its relevance to the understanding of the geomechanical behavior of rock masses, the durability 

index (Id2) has been incorporated as a classification criterion in the RMR 2014 system update 

(Celada et al. 2014). 

Bieniawski, in the World Tunnel Congress, Foz do Iguaçu (Brazil), presented the study 

of Celada et al. (2014), which introduces three modifications related to the number of fractures 

per meter instead of RQD and joint spacing, rearranging the values of joint conditions and 

incorporating the alterability parameter, accessed by the Id2 and obtained by the SDT. 

According to that study, which is based on results obtained from 2,298 cases in Spain, RMR 89 

concentrates the values in their third part and the alterability parameter was chosen to distribute 

the RMR values along the third and second geomechanical classes. The Monte Seco Tunnel 

rock mass concentrates the RMR 89 values between 56 to 62 (III – II) (Cacciari, 2014) and has 

an instability problem related to long term exposition of the surrounding rock to weathering. 

For this reason, the use of the RMR update in the geomechanical reevaluation of the Monte 

Seco Tunnel, performed with a view to characterize the heterogeneity of the gneissic rock 

matrix, may identify areas related to the rock falls currently observed by the GeoInfraUSP 

researchers. This study will focus on the estimate of the newly incorporated parameter – 

alterability, regarding intact rocks. 

 

4.3 Characterization of weathering grades 

  

 The SDT was originally performed in soft and weak rocks prone to expansion and 

disaggregation when absorbing water. It has also been also applied in the study of weathering 



63 

 

 

 

and alterability of igneous and medium- to high-grade metamorphic rocks, basically because of 

the need to predict the behavior of the rock submitted to tropical environments (Arel and 

Tugrul, 2001; Gupta and Rao, 2001; Gupta and Ahmed, 2007; Marques et al. 2010; 

Moradizadeh et al. 2016; Ahmad et al. 2017; Momeni et al. 2017).  

The durability index presents a favorable relationship with the strength ratio (Rs) in the 

assessment of weathering grades, as shown in Figure 4.2. The strength ratio proposed by Gupta 

and Rao (2001) correlates the UCS values of weathered rocks with the UCS value of the fresh 

rock. It was obtained for different igneous and metamorphic rocks, being correlated with the 

Id2 of the SDT (Arel and Tugrul, 2001; Gupta and Rao, 2001; Ceryan et al. 2008; Marques et 

al. 2010; Khanlari et al. 2012), according to the ISRM (2015) subdivision of weathering grades. 

It can be observed that for fresh to slightly weathered grades the Id2 hardly discriminates 

the rock crystalline behavior as Rs (Rs &gt; 85% and 85% &gt; Rs &gt; 60%, respectively) in a general 

weathering classification. On the other hand, starting from a moderately weathered grade there 

is a clear influence in the variation of the durability behavior (95% &gt; Id2 &gt; 80%) due to 

weathering intensity, which can be also noticed in strength ratio values (60% &gt; Rs &gt; 20%). For 

highly and completely weathered grades the variation of the durability index increases 

(respectively, 80 &gt; Id2 &gt; 50% and Id2 &amp;lt;50%) in relation to strength ratio values (respectively, 

20% &gt; Rs &gt; 5% and 5% &gt; Rs) (Figure 4.2).  

As specific types of secondary products form and their respective quantities vary 

throughout the weathering of each kind of rock, the durability index reflects the relative strength 

reduction and can be used to compare or distinguish disaggregation degrees of crystalline rocks 

caused by water absorption, drying and SDT abrasion cycles, which are roughly compared to 

weathering in tropical environments. In the geotechnical practice, the use of SDT combined 

with the UCS test can characterize the most important rock modifications and can be used as 

an important additional information for the characterization of weathering grades of igneous 

and metamorphic rocks.

Figure 4.2 - Relationship between strength ratio and durability index for some igneous and metamorphic rocks in 

accordance with a general classificatory approach of weathering grades. 

 

Rock characteristics, such as mineral composition, grain size, structural and textural 

properties (Gupta and Rao, 2000), the geometry of pores and fissures (Arel and Tugrul, 2001), 

and the appearance and types of secondary minerals and increasing fissures (Momeni et al. 

2017), are the main factors influencing rock strength and durability with weathering. For 

example, the increase in the average crystal size is inversely proportional to the uniaxial 

compression and tensile strength of crystalline rocks in fresh to slightly weathered rocks (Sajid 

et al. 2016). Moreover, the mineralogical characteristics are responsible for the different 

alteration potentials of a rock (Delvigne, 1998) and are closely related to the durability values 

of the material (Dhakal et al. 2002). Therefore each kind of rock (igneous or metamorphic) has 

a mineral composition that influences rock strength and durability with weathering and that 

must be investigated thoroughly. 

Petrographic analyses are necessary for a better understanding of the mineral 

characteristics, their conditions and transformations. When it comes to weathered material, 

indices are usually used to characterize the weathered rock, such as the micropetrographic index 



65 

 

 

 

(Ip) of Irfan and Dearman (1978), which has been compared to other indices to check its 

applicability to the characterization of different rock weathering grades (Gupta and Rao, 2001). 

These authors indicate that, despite the wide range of values of this index (0-100), it is best 

applied to granites of varied compositions, but not to quartzites and basalts. 

Many authors have used the micropetrographic index, showing that it is reliable to 

estimate the weathering stages of different kind of rocks, including heterogenous rocks. In fact, 

Ip can better estimate rock weathering, helping interpret correlations between weathering and 

mechanical degradation for geological and engineering aims (Le Pera et al. 2001; Khanlari et 

al. 2012; Borrelli et al. 2014; Ahmad et al. 2017). 

 

4.4 Materials and methods 

 

The fresh gneissic rock of the study area is composed of quartz, plagioclase, alkaline 

feldspar, biotite, cordierite, hypersthene, and garnet. Other minerals (sillimanite, hercynite and 

opaque minerals) occur subordinately and are not responsible for the loss of rock strength 

(Monticeli et al. 2016). 

 The samples were carefully collected from drilling cores and outcropping rock blocks 

in the vicinity of the southern part of the Monte Seco tunnel in order to represent the three 

alteration horizons of the rock mass (Figures 3.10 and 3.17). The weathering grades of the 

samples were characterized according to the proposal presented in Table 4.1, which was based 

on Hoek and Brown (1997), BS 5930 (1999) and ISRM (2015) weathering classification.  

To consider the abrupt weathering behavior observed in field investigations and the 

hardly distinguishable durability of a crystalline and heterogeneous rock, the fresh (I) and 

slightly weathered (II) grades were grouped in grade W1. The moderately (III) and highly 

weathered grade (IV) were maintained in W2 and W3 respectively. In this proposal, the highly 

weathered grade (IV), in its tactile features, could be distinguished into highly and completely 

(V) weathered grades, depending upon results of laboratory tests. Unfortunately, it was not 

possible to assess weathering grade W2 in one of the gneiss facies for the SDT. Petrographic 

analysis and physical-mechanical tests (physical properties, UCS and SDT) were carried out in 



66 

 

 

 

laboratories of the Institute of Geosciences, EPUSP and the Engineering School of São Carlos 

– University of São Paulo. 

 Initially, the characterization of the gneissic matrix was carried out by means of tactile 

and visual inspection and petrography. Mineral composition, structure, texture and grain-size 

of the rock were described, as well as an accurate description of grades, types of weathering 

and mineral cracking. The modal composition of primary minerals and secondary products was 

obtained by counting points for each facies, totalizing fifteen thin sections. The 

micropetrographic index (Ip), following the recommendations of Irfan and Dearman (1978), 

was obtained to investigate the mineralogical characteristics and the transformations due to 

weathering. This index is the ratio between the number of sound minerals (SM) and unsound 

constituents (UC) that include unsound or weathered minerals (UM), fissures (F) and voids (V).   

The representative specimens of each weathering grade (Table 4.1) and petrographic 

facies were submitted to physical tests. Porosity, density and apparent absorption were obtained 

following the ISRM (1979a) guidelines. The UCS of the 53 samples were obtained following 

the ISRM (1979b) guidelines. The angle (?) between foliation and load direction obtained for 

weathering grade W1 fell around 60° and 0° and 90° for grades W2 and W3. 

With the use of equipment and procedures recommended by ASTM D4644-16 (2016) the 

Id were obtained during SDT. The Id values were categorized according to Table 4.2 presented 

in Gamble (1971) and suggested for the classification of rock durability (ISRM, 1979a). The Id 

values were also classified according to the alterability parameter from RMR 2014 update 

(Celada et al. 2014). The criterion is the fifth parameter of classification and is accessed by the 

Id2 of the SDT. Table 4.2 shows that ten points are grouped in classes Very High (VH), High 

(H) and Medium High (MH); for the other three classes – Medium (M), Low (L) and Very Low 

(VL), a significant drop in material durability and longer grading intervals occur, as the value 

decreases to zero.

4.5 Results and discussion 

4.5.1 Petrographic and physical characterization of the gneissic rock 

  

 The lithotype, referred to simply as gneissic rock, is light gray to bluish dark gray, fine- 

to medium-grained, secondarily coarse-grained. Centimeter- to meter-sized bands that 

correspond to the mesosome are characterized by a lepidogranoblastic texture and a biotite-rich 

gneiss foliation, interspersed with millimeter-sized light (felsic) and centimeter-sized quartz-

feldpathic lenses. Well-formed bands of granoblastic texture correspond to the medium- to 

coarse-grained leucosome composed of feldspar, quartz, cordierite, garnet and opaque minerals. 

The presence of these features, closely related to metamorphism of a sedimentary 

prototype, leads to the heterogeneity of the rock matrix. These variations, which represent the 

gneissic banding, were classified as petrographic facies B1, B2 and B3, according to mineral 

composition, structure, texture and grain size (Table 4.3). The most representative 

photomicrographs are presented in Figure 4.3. The micropetrographic indexes for each thin 

section numbered 1 to 15, with the respective test of apparent physical properties, are shown in 

Table 4.4 and the correlation between Ip and porosity is presented in Figure 4.4.

Fresh to slightly weathered gneissic rock  

 

In thin sections 1-2, 6-7 and 11-12 from the facies B1, B2 and B3 respectively, a 

clear change of the microsystem contact among the minerals of the rock matrix is 

observed, which translates into the structure, from foliate to incipient massive with loss 

of foliation given by the planes of aligned micas, and into the texture, initially 

equigranular and lepidogranoblastic to inequegranular and granoblastic. This 

modification is accompanied mainly by the increase in grain-size of the rock matrix that 

varies significantly for facies B3, rich in quartz, feldspar, and cordierite porphyroblasts 

(Tables 4.3 – 4.4).  



71 

 

 

 

Intramineral microcracks are absent or incipient in facies B1, leading to a more 

evolved fissure microsystem in facies B3, marked by a significant quantity of intramineral 

fissures (Fi) that reach the quartz, feldspars and cordierite rims, being sometimes 

connected with other Fi, forming intermineral (Fe) and transmineral fissures (Ft) (Figure 

4.3A - C). Some minerals only show signs of alteration in some more weatherable 

minerals such as cordierite in fissured portions of the rock matrix. The difference in the 

degree of microcracking of facies B3 of the gneissic rock matrix showing incipient 

weathering causes a great difference in Ip obtained in weathering grade W1 (Figure 4.4).

Moderately weathered gneissic rock  

 

Weathering begins in fact with the emergence of physical-chemical alteration in 

minerals (quartz – cracks; cordierite, biotite, plagioclase, orthoclase, and hypersthene – 

decomposition and disintegration), with the generation of secondary minerals where a 



72 

 

 

 

network of fissures (intra to transmineral) is under development, as seen in the samples 

3, 8, and 13, respectively from the facies B1 to B3 (Table 4.4). Hypersthene and garnet 

are weathered to iron and aluminum oxides and hydroxides along intra, inter and 

transmineral fissures. Biotite is weathered along the open cleavage planes with the 

production of chlorite and iron oxides and hydroxides (Figure 4.3D). Cordierite is altered 

to pinite, chlorite, sericite and iron oxides and hydroxides (Figure 4.3E). Orthoclase and 

plagioclase are altered to sericite along the intra to transmineral fissures (Figure 4.3F).  

 

 

Figure 4.4 - Relationship between micropetrography index (Ip) and porosity (?) for the gneissic rock 

facies B1, B2 and B3. 

 

Cordierite and the biotite lead to the impregnation of iron oxides and hydroxides in 

the matrix, causing, when weathered, changes in texture by the appearance of radial 

fissures (Fr) in the minerals adjacent to them (Monticeli et al. 2016). These changes act 

as a weakening factor, increasing the coalescence of fissures into intermineral and 

transmineral fissures by the physicochemical weathering of the microsystem formed by 

them (Delvigne, 1998). This process weakens the bonds between adjacent minerals and 

favors the advance of the weathering agents to other minerals, increasing the alteration of 



73 

 

 

 

the whole rock matrix (Figure 4.3 D and E). The whole of mineralogical transformations 

increases the porosity of the rock in about 3%, while Ip values are significantly decreased 

for the rock matrix classified in facies B1 and B2, following the order of the scale to facies 

B3 (Figure 4.4). 

 

Highly (to completely) weathered gneissic rock  

 

Weathering had an intense effect upon the primary minerals, often causing their 

total transformation into secondary minerals, now in high quantity in the fissured 

weathered matrix, as seen in samples 4-5, 9-10 and 14-15, respectively facies B1, B2 and 

B3. The set of mineral transformations decreases Ip values to the lowest of each facies, as 

the porosity of the samples drastically increases (Table 4.4 and Figure 4.4). The 

petrographic analyses showed that each matrix presents some particularities regarding the 

development of secondary minerals, types of fissures and fillings.  

It can be noticed in facies B1 that intra and intermineral fissures are more common. 

The intermineral fissures (Fe) can be seen only because they are filled with iron oxides 

and hydroxides (Figure 4.3G), while facies B2 and B3 show all kinds of fissures (intra, 

inter and transmineral) particularly filled with iron oxides and hydroxides in high 

quantities and secondly by pinite, chlorite and sericite in the foliation plane in facies B2 

(Figure 4.3H). In facies B3, fissures are filled in great quantity with sericite, secondly 

with iron oxides and hydroxides only close to cordierite (Figure 4.3I). The fissure 

microsystem of each facies controls particularly the intensity of the weathering of 

minerals in each matrix, as observed by differences in the percentage of sound and 

unsound minerals in facies B1 in relation to facies B2 and B3. The micropetrographic 

index and porosity were sensitive to these mineralogical aspects, showing higher Ip and 

lower porosity values for facies B1 in relation to B2 and B3 of grade W3 (Table 4.4 and 

Figure 4.4).  

The correlation between Ip and the physical properties of the petrographic facies 

defines a trend along the weathering evolution that may help outline distinctions or 

similarities between samples, weathering stages and mechanical behavior. Among them, 

preference was given to porosity, because it presents a higher coefficient of determination 



74 

 

 

 

than density and absorption. Facies B1 and B2 clearly present the same trend at earlier 

stages of weathering but, when weathering intensifies, facies B2 approaches the trend of 

facies B3, which presents a completely distinct behavior in respect to weathering. 

The thin sections of facies B3 of grade W1 (Table 4.4) show petrographic aspects 

that result in a lower Ip value in relation to facies B1 and B2, despite the close values of 

porosity around one per cent, as indicated by the dotted line (Figure 4.4). The Ip values of 

facies B3 of grade W1 are those of grade W2 – facies B1 and B2. In this sense, the 

petrographic index is a good additional information on the rock matrix condition in face 

of weathering, thus permitting us to predict certain mechanical behavior of the rocks 

being studied. 

 

4.5.2 Durability and strength characterization of the gneissic rock 

 

Figure 4.6 shows the photos of the sample assemblies after all the SDT cycles. 

Figure 4.7 shows the Id values according to the cycle number (n) for all facies of 

weathering grades W1 and W3; for facies B1 and B3 of grade W2, as it was not possible 

to obtain enough representative pieces of rock to define sample B2. Durability 

classifications (Gamble, 1971) and the value of the alterability parameter (Celada et al. 

2014) taken from Table 4.2 are also shown in Figure 4.6. 

In Figure 4.7, UCS and Rs were correlated with porosity, Ip and Id. To investigate 

the influence of heterogeneity in the variation of the results, all data were plotted versus 

the porosity of the samples (Figure 4.7A and D). To analyze the difference between the 

Ip values for petrographic facies B1 and B2 in relation to B3, especially in the earlier 

stages of weathering as observed previously in Figure 4.4, the average Ip values of the 

thin sections of each weathering grade calculated from Table 4.4 were correlated to the 

mean UCS and Rs (Figure 4.7B and E). 

The relationship between the mean UCS value and Id along the SDT cycles is 

presented in Figure 4.7C, and the best correlation (4th cycle) was used to guide a general 

weathering grade classification (I, II, III, IV and V) based on Rs and Id4 (Figure 4.7F). 

The data from Gupta and Rao (2001) and Khanlari et al. (2012) were also plotted to 

calibrate the range of values. The maximum UCS obtained for facies B1 was 164 MPa 



75 

 

 

 

and this result was used for the Rs calculations. The average values of UCS and Id along 

the SDT cycles are presented in Table 4.5. The weathering grade classification of the 

gneissic rock from the Monte Seco tunnel is displayed in Table 4.6.

(medium), L (low), VL (very low) with the value of the alterability parameter (10 – 4) (Celada et al. 

2014).

weathered, III: moderately weathered, IV: highly weathered and V: completely weathered. 



78 

 

 

 

 

It can be observed in the SDT that the edges and corners of weathering grade W1 

samples are generally comminuted for all facies characterized as Type I (ASTM, 2016), 

but the formation of non-passing fragments in the mesh only for facies B3 reflects the 

influence of the grain-size of the minerals in the defragmentation process. For all the 

facies of weathering grades W2 and W3 an intense comminution of the specimens is 

observed with the formation of non-through fragments in the mesh, characterized as Type 

II (ASTM, 2016) (Figure 4.5). It is observed in the B3 – W3 facies that this process is 

more intense with a larger number of fragments than in original samples. It was noticed 

that the through-material of facies B1 and B2 is fine to medium grained and that it is 

clearly fine to coarse grained for B3.

Concerning the second SDT cycle, the petrographic facies B1 and B2 of grade W1 

yield higher Id2 values, respectively, 98.89% and 98.72% and are classified in the same 

category Very High, while B3, with a slightly lower value of 97.73% falls in a lower 

category (High) (Figure 4.6). In all of them, the durability of the material decreases as the 

weathering intensity increases, as shown in grades W2 and W3. The durability indexes of 



79 

 

 

 

the petrographic facies are classified in equal categories, respectively, Medium High, for 

facies B1 and B3, respectively 92.61% and 87.09% and Medium, for all facies B1, B2 

and B3, respectively 75.64%, 79.29% and 72.81%. As for the results along the SDT 

cycles, it is observed a noticeable decrease in the durability indexes and the categories of 

classification. The Id values for facies B1 and B2 overlap the subsequent numbers of 

cycles in weathering grade W1 and almost in grade W3. In contrast to that, facies B3 

shows a slightly different behavior, the drop-in durability class occurring many cycles 

before B1 and B2. This behavior translates into the durability classification of facies B3 

normally in a lower category than the others depending on the SDT cycle (Figure 4.6). 

The gneissic rock heterogeneity has a clear effect in UCS and Rs in weathering 

grade W1 (I and II), where the porosity is lower than 1.5% (Figure 4.7A and D). As 

commented by Sajid et al. (2016), the increasing grain size is inversely proportional to 

UCS in the earlier stages of weathering and, in parts, controls the difference noticed 

between petrographic facies B1 to B3. However, as observed in the petrographic analysis, 

this strength variation is also related to the characteristics of the rock, structure and texture 

modification (Table 4.3), followed by the increasing degree of microcracking triggered 

by the incipient process of weathering of cordierite from facies B1 to B3. These aspects 

were highlighted by Ip (Figure 4.7B and E) and Id (Figure 4.7C and F), whose correlations 

point out that facies B3 samples previously characterized by visual tactile features of 

weathering grade W1 (Table 4.1) present the behavior of petrographic facies B1 and B2 

of weathering grade W2 (III), in accordance with laboratory tests. 

UCS and Rs values of the gneissic rock facies B1, B2 and B3 decrease with 

weathering, following exponential functions in relation to porosity and Id4, and a 

logarithmic function in relation to Ip. The influence of heterogeneity in the variation of 

UCS and Rs values decreases while the porosity increases drastically (Figure 4.7A and 

D). Again, as with facies B3, the previously weathering grade characterized as W2 (III) 

shows, in fact, more signs of alteration, being classified in grade IV by all the properties 

studied here (Figure 4.7). It is worth mentioning that Ip and the degradation of Id with the 

SDT cycles were crucial to the interpretation above, once these aspects noticed in facies 

B3 were not observed in facies B1 and B2, whose samples, previously characterized using 

Table 4.1, are in accordance with the general classification based on laboratory tests 

(Figure 4.7 and Table 4.6).  



80 

 

 

 

In spite of the decreasing strength variation among petrographic facies with 

weathering, the characteristic transformations of the rock and the kind of secondary 

products produced in each petrographic facies are continually heterogeneous, which is 

slightly reflected in the increasing difference of durability between B1 and B3 along the 

SDT cycles employed (Figure 4.6 and Table 4.5). Facies B1 of these samples, previously 

characterized in the advanced weathering grade W3 as highly weathered (IV), was kept 

in this category, whereas facies B3, with lower UCS and durability values, was 

comparably placed in the category completely weathered (V). Facies B2 remains in-

between, based on UCS and Rs and Id4 (4
th cycle) values (Figure 4.7F). Previously, Ip 

values in Figure 4.4 also indicated these aspects. 

As expected, the combination of UCS and Rs with Ip and Id is sensitive to the 

differences and transformations in the rock matrix, presenting a significant reduction with 

weathering (Figure 4.7). The combination of weathering grades (Table 4.1), in order to 

provide a brief characterization of the rock mass condition, can be applied to the tunneling 

practice by means of laboratory tests, considering whether weathering indexes, such as 

Rs, Ip and Id4, are adequate to investigate the influence of heterogeneities in the gneissic 

rock on its physical-mechanical properties, especially those related to loss of strength and 

disaggregation (Figures 4.6 and 4.7). In fact, this procedure helped differentiate the 

behavior of the petrographic facies and then correct their comparative positioning in the 

general weathering grade classification and subdivision (Table 4.6). 

Recently, Kahraman et al. (2017) found a strong correlation between UCS and Id4 

and pyroclastic rocks (extrusive igneous rocks), and Momeni et al. (2017) indicates two 

cycles or more to distinguish weathering grades and capture the durability aspects of 

crystalline rocks. Indeed, the correlations of Id values along the cycles with UCS was a 

good procedure for weathering grade characterization and strength estimate, making 

possible the identification of Id4 as the best correlation. This trend (Id 4th cycle) 

comparatively correlated with data collected from Gupta and Rao (2001) and Khanlari et 

al. (2012), both using Id2, to guide the arrangement of the scale of values of the general 

weathering grade classification of gneissic rock of the Monte Seco tunnel (Figure 4.7C 

and F, Table 4.6).  

The trend line for loss of strength and durability of the gneissic rock from the first 

to the second SDT cycle resembles that of a granodiorite, whereas that from the fourth to 



81 

 

 

 

the fifth cycle resembles that of a granite, whose weathering grades are better defined by 

these properties. Comparing the number of cycles needed to access the best fit line from 

a gneissic rock to a granite, it can be remarked that the granite has a relative intensity of 

disaggregation four to fifth times superior than the gneissic rock under such SDT 

conditions. This comparison could be used as additional information in the study of the 

behavior of crystalline rocks during the process of durability degradation.

4.5.3 RMR ratings of Id and UCS 

 

The alterability parameter (Celada et al. 2014) was previously shown together with 

the durability classification (Gamble, 1971) in Figure 4.6. The alterability of the gneissic 

rock is maximum throughout the cycles from fresh to moderately weathered grades. When 

weathering intensifies from moderately to completely weathered grades, the categories of 

its durability fall, consequently decreasing the scores of the geomechanical parameter. 

The value drops from ten to eight from weathering grades III to IV, and subsequently 

from eight to four from grades IV to V, this being the total number of cycles employed in 

SDT. In this manner, the alterability criterion indicates that the rock can only be driven 

to a decrease in geomechanical quality if it is in advanced weathered condition. 

Aiming at a detailed characterization and classification of the Monte Seco tunnel, 

especially considering intact rock parameters and degradation due to weathering, the UCS 

and alterability RMR parameters are correlated in Figure 4.8, considering the Id values 

along the cycles. The number of cycles plays an important role in determining r2, 



82 

 

 

 

especially in Id2, the Id suggested to parameter estimative. The coefficient is 0.76 in the 

first cycle (Figure 4.8A), decreases to 0.59 in the second cycle (Figure 4.8B) and reaches 

the best value (0.91) from the third cycle onwards (Figure 4.8C).  

As seen in Figure 4.8B, it is not possible to distribute the alterability values 

adequately among the weathering grades using the alterability parameter (Table 4.2) and 

Id2 only, as recommended by Celada et al. (2014). Furthermore, the Monte Seco tunnel 

classification would not properly discriminate the geomechanical behavior of the rock 

facies, as may be later revealed in field investigations. 

The increase of the number of cycles to more than three in order to better estimate 

the alterability parameter clearly distributes the scores as weathering intensifies and UCS 

decreases (Figure 4.8C). However, the value of the alterability parameter obtained with 

Table 4.2 may be, in general, overvalued for the gneissic rock along the weathering 

grades. For instance, the alterability value for grades IV and V, which show 

characteristics like a residual soil, is 4 (Id4). Values around 0 would be expected, as 

observed for UCS, which achieved scores around 1.5, a value much closer to the extreme 

0. 

In this manner, as Id reflects the relative strength degradation and rock 

disaggregation, showing well established relationships with UCS and Rs (Figures 4.2, 

4.7C and F), it can be assumed that the value of the alterability parameter could be 

equivalent to the strength ratio in the weathering grade characterization.

In this case, an adjusted equation is proposed, based on the granite Id2 and the 

gneissic rock, Id4, in order to access the alterability parameter along the weathering grade 

classification (Figure 4.9A). The proposed equation (1), when compared to Celada et al. 



85 

 

 

 

(2014) (Figure 4.9B), fulfills the values of the alterability parameter along the weathering 

grades, improving the initial idea mentioned by these authors, namely that of using Id to 

distribute the RMR values (Table 4.7).

4.6 Conclusion   

 

 In the study of the relationship between durability and strength of an intact 

gneissic rock along weathering grades, it was fundamental to characterize its 

heterogeneity, since it clearly affects the variation of these properties, as in the related 

estimate of parameters.  

The gneissic rock presents three petrographic facies B1, B2 and B3, which 

characterize the heterogeneity of the lithotype banding. Among these facies structural 

changes can be noticed, from foliated to massive, and also textural, from 

lepidogranoblastic to granoblastic, accompanied by increasing grain size, fissures and 

disappearance of the micas that define the anisotropy plane of the rock (Table 4.3). These 

mineral characteristics generate different alterability conditions, which, in turn, influence 

the specific appearance of secondary products, creating a unique mineralogical 

microsystem for each facies along weathering (Figure 4.3).  

The visual and petrographic analysis and the physical-mechanical tests (SDT and 

UCS) resulting in weathering indexes (Ip, Id and Rs) were able to qualify, quantify and 



86 

 

 

 

distinguish this mineralogical information (Figures 4.4 to 4.7), improving the weathering 

grade classification for the revaluation of the Monte Seco tunnel (Table 4.6). 

Comparatively to facies B1 and B2, facies B3 was placed at the start of the moderately 

weathered grade (III), because it presents greater potential to weathering, loss of strength 

and durability, is subject to disaggregation and therefore more susceptible to produce 

fragments. This aspect was highlighted by relationships between weathering indexes (Ip, 

Id4 and Rs), which proved to be a good procedure for weathering grade characterization 

and strength estimate. Moreover, Id4 proved to be the best durability index to the 

relationship with UCS and Rs in the gneissic rock studied. 

The assessment of the alterability parameter needs to be further investigated by the 

geological engineering community for a better understanding of its applicability and 

influences in tunneling in different kinds of rocks and weathering conditions. For now, 

when it comes to the gneissic rock of the Monte Seco tunnel, submitted to a tropical 

environment, the use of Id2 and the respective parameter value, following the procedures 

in the RMR update (Celada et al. 2014), is not adequate to express strength and durability 

degradation noticed for this lithotype along the weathering grades (Figures 4.8 – 4.9). 

Moreover, it appears to be overvalued for granite and gneissic rocks. 

For this reason, an equation has been proposed, which is based on the relationship 

between strength ratio and Id4 assessed through the alterability parameter. The proposed 

equation contributes to a better distribution of values (10 – 0) than that obtained by 

following the procedures of Celada et al. (2014) (10 – 8) (Table 4.7) as to the gneissic 

rock under consideration, indeed improving the initial idea these authors had of using Id 

to indicate differences in RMR classes. In tropical climates, such as in the southern part 

of Brazil, the study of adaptations in geomechanical classifications is a topic of great 

importance and has been considered by several authors (Santos et al. 2012; Amaral Junior 

et al. 2016).   

The procedure developed to characterize the intact rock heterogeneity and its 

influence on related parameters (UCS and alterability) could be tested in this tunnel as 

well as in other VMR tunnels in which problems of instability have been noticed and were 

excavated in different igneous and low- to high-grade metamorphic rock masses, that 

undoubtedly have different strength and durability behaviors according to the time of 

exposition to weathering. The use of the RMR 2014 update may be a significant 



87 

 

 

 

alternative to differentiate these tunnels, once two of five parameters can be related to the 

characteristics of intact rocks.

5. TEXTURAL AND MICROMORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION 

OF TROPICAL WEATHERING EFFECTS ON CORDIERITE IN GNEISSIC 

ROCK3 

 

Abstract 

This paper evaluates the tropical weathering of cordierite in the gneissic rock mass 

surrounding the Monte Seco Tunnel, an in-situ laboratory. This tunnel was excavated in 

the 1950s and, except for the entrance and exit, does not include the use of either only 

concrete liners or both liners and bolts. The weathering, rock matrix deterioration and 

arenization, promoted the edge effect of biotite alteromorphs due to its meso-

alteromorphic texture. The microsystem of the foliation formed by the biotite and 

cordierite alteromorphs produced secondary minerals, such as chlorite and smectite, that 

contributed to the fissuring and weathering. The cordierite distributed in the rock mass 

(intact rock), concentrated along the foliation, was destroyed by pinitization, 

chloritization and replaced by pinite, chlorite, sericite, smectite, kaolinite and goethite 

along cleavage planes, intramineral fissures and the alteromorph rims. The corresponding 

weathering pattern is characterized by the generation of secondary crystalline products 

that interfere in the intramineral fissuring of the adjacent minerals that form the rock 

microsystem, leading to a textural change characterized as meso- and halo-alteromorphic. 

These weathered minerals contribute to the generation of a secondary fissural porosity, 

and the resulting textural change reflects the fragility mechanism of the crystalline fabric 

or the lepido-granoblastic texture. The tropical environment intensifies the effects of this 

type of fragility because wetting and drying cycles allow the secondary materials that fill 

the fissures to leach or expand and contract, further loosening the bonds between the 

minerals and compromising cohesion. When the minerals present in the foliation, such as 

biotite and cordierite, undergo weathering, they promote fissuring of the crystalline fabric 

and the subsequent loosening of mineral bonds. 

 

Keywords: gneissic alteromorphs, cordierite, weathering, texture, petrographic indexes.

5.1 Introduction 

 

The complex behavior of a rock mass is strongly influenced by geological structures 

such as joints, faults, and foliations and by weathering stages. This paper elucidates the 

weathering and degradation stages of gneissic rock in an old tunnel associated with block 

instability. 

The Monte Seco Tunnel is the in-situ laboratory and is located close to Vitória, the 

capital city of the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil, and is a segment of the Vitória–Minas 

Railway (EFVM, Estrada de Ferro Vitória–Minas). As the majority of the tunnels 

constructed along this railway in the 1950s, it was excavated in gneissic rock, and except 

for the entrance and exit, does not include the use of either only concrete liners or both 

liners and bolts. Due to the long-term exposure of the rock to weathering, the initial 

mechanical characteristics of these EFVM tunnels have been degraded, resulting in rock 

falls from the ceiling and walls. EFVM is responsible for the transport of iron ore from 

the Iron Quadrangle (Quadrilátero Ferrífero) in the state of Minas Gerais: its full 

operation is important because any delay in ore supply can cause logistical losses. 

The detailed assessment of the present geological-geotechnical conditions of the 

Monte Seco Tunnel and of the other tunnels along this railway, to determine the risks 

associated with rock instability, constitutes a fundamental part of several studies from the 

GeoInfraUSP (University of Sao Paulo) research group (Cantarelli et al., 2016, Cacciari 

and Futai, 2016, 2017, 2018). Among the parameters being investigated, the weathering 

grades of a rock mass (intact rock and discontinuity-bearing rock) have been 

characterized based on petrographic analyses and destructive and nondestructive tests, 

such as the sclerometer test, the slake durability test, and the uniaxial compression test. 

Regarding petrographic analyses aiming at the definition of petrographic 

weathering indexes at the microscale (Lumb 1962, Mendes et al. 1966, Onodera et al. 

1974, Irfan and Dearman 1978, Cole and Sandy 1980, Gupta and Rao 2000, Arel and 

Tugrul 2001, Gupta and Rao 2001, Ceryan et al. 2008), we observe that mineral textures 

and micromorphology are seldom correlated with patterns and evolutionary stages of 

weathering. For a certain weathering grade, the variation in strength of a rock is basically 

related to its texture (Sajid et al. 2016). However, when texture is described by 

petrographic indexes, such as the textural coefficient (TC), these indexes are neither 



93 

 

 

 

sensitive to the mineralogical transformations related to weathering nor correlate well 

with the geotechnical properties (Azzoni et al. 1996, Gupta and Rao 2001). Notably, 

mineral composition and textural properties, such as fissures and voids, are the most 

important factors in the determination of the strength of a rock (Gupta and Rao 2000). 

Therefore, to understand the physical-mechanical degradation of a rock, it is 

fundamental to describe the weathering processes and the textural modifications in a 

standard way. The classification presented by Delvigne (1998) is an alternative to the 

analysis of the textural modifications of the crystalline fabric of a rock that underwent 

weathering and can improve the interpretations of the petrographic weathering indexes 

and their relationship with the physical-mechanical behavior of the rock. 

Delvigne (1998) proposed a classification of weathering patterns for individual 

minerals of a rock based on their micromorphological and textural description. The 

weathered minerals are called alteromorphs and can be dealt with either individually or 

in groups constituting three main types of microsystems: (i) Contact: contacts between 

unweathered minerals. (ii) Plasmic: minerals undergoing weathering. (iii) Fissures: intra-

, inter- and transmineral fissures. The identification of the microsystem, extent of the 

weathering and proportions of the primary and secondary minerals and pores and fissures, 

as well as the way that the weathering affects the minerals, are the basis of the 

classification system. According to the extent of the preservation, size and shape of the 

primary minerals that underwent weathering, three weathering texture types can be 

distinguished: iso-alteromorph, meso-alteromorph and kata-alteromorph (Figure 5.1). 

Depending on the intrinsic properties of a mineral, such as its cleavage, twinning, 

structural integrity, and grain size, weathering takes place in a specific way, which 

determines the mineral weathering pattern and evolutionary stages (0, unweathered, to 4, 

completely weathered), as presented in more detail in Delvigne (1998). 

The objective of this study is the textural and micromorphological characterization 

of weathered minerals from a gneissic rock from the Monte Seco Tunnel, which has 

experienced tropical climate conditions, and the roles of texture and micromorphology in 

rock degradation along the weathering grades. Petrographic analyses and X-ray 

diffraction tests were conducted to characterize the primary and secondary products along 

the weathering grades. The gneissic rock-forming minerals were characterized according 

to the textural classification presented in Delvigne (1998). However, we do not address 



94 

 

 

 

cordierite alteromorphs, which are one of the main constituents of the gneissic rock where 

the tunnel was excavated, and consequently its micromorphological modifications with 

weathering. Moreover, the description of cordierite in the literature is usually limited to 

its mineralogical and crystallographic properties (Prider 1945, Vogel 1975, Klein 2007, 

Nesse 2012). In this sense, cordierite alteromorph characterization according to textural 

and micromorphological classification and by means of petrographic intramineral 

weathering indexes that are proposed here, namely, extent of weathering (Ea) and 

intramineral fissures (If), is pioneering work in the study of cordierite. 

In contrast to the orthoclase, plagioclase, hypersthene and garnet alteromorphs that 

showed textural modifications in the petrographic analyses, the cordierite and biotite 

alteromorphs showed an edge effect, producing intra- to transmineral fissures in the 

adjacent minerals and increasing the bond loss of the foliation plane, consequently 

causing instability of the rock blocks in tropical conditions. It is expected that this study 

can aid in the textural and micromorphological classification of minerals undergoing 

weathering in general, as well as in the study of the modifications of the gneissic 

crystalline fabric caused by such a process in engineering geology applications.

5.2 Geological and weathering conditions 

 

The geological setting of the region where the Monte Seco Tunnel was excavated is the 

Nova Venécia Complex, located in the Paraíba do Sul Domain of the Araçuaí Orogenic Belt of 

Mantiqueira Province. The rock analyzed in this study is a migmatitic sillimanite-garnet-

cordierite-biotite gneiss (Baltazar et al. 2010), herein referred to as gneiss. 

Climatic conditions control the intensity of weathering mechanisms such as 

disaggregation and decomposition of the rock, which are basically influenced by temperature 

and rainfall. In the study area, the rainfall varies from 100 to 120 cm in the summer and from 

50 to 20 cm in the winter, and the temperature varies from 28 to 26 °C in the summer and 22 to 

20 °C in the winter. According to Dearman et al. (1978), the climate is tropical with clear 

contrasts between the dry and rainy seasons, characterizing a physical-chemical weathering of 

moderate intensity, varying from strong to very weak. 

The geological and environmental conditions led to the modeling of a relief composed of 

hills and slopes with pronounced declivity: the outcropping rock has a sugarloaf shape. 

Underground investigations via geoelectrical profiles and rotatory drillings were conducted and 

used to determine the geological profile. The local weathering profile was created by a 

continuous geomorphologic evolution and therefore is compared to the slope weathering profile 

of Deere and Patton (1971); the profile is constituted by three weathering horizons (Figure 5.2): 

I – transported Soil, II – very to moderately weathered rock mass, and III – weakly weathered 

rock mass. Horizon I contains soil and rock blocks of various sizes, which are in part very 

weathered. 

Abrupt or weakly evolved contacts between the weathering horizons are common in 

slopes developed in gneissic regions, especially in Southeastern Brazil, where the study area is 

located (Barroso et al. 1996, Pimentel and Barroso 1996, Marques et al. 2010).

5.2 Materials and methods  

 

The gneissic rock samples were carefully collected from drilling cores and outcropping 

rock blocks in the vicinity of the Monte Seco Tunnel to represent all three weathering horizons 

(Figure 5.2). The weathering grades of the samples were characterized by visual and tactile 

procedures according to the descriptions presented in Table 5.1. 

Due to their fragility, samples representing grades W2 and W3 were impregnated with an 

epoxy resin inside a vacuum heater; then, thin sections were carefully prepared from those 

samples at the Geoscience Institute of São Paulo University (IGc-USP). This procedure helped 

maintain the sample in a more compact form, preserving textural and micromorphological 

features that could be disturbed during preparation of the sections. The petrographic analyses 

were conducted with the Leica Zeiss Axioplan optical microscope of the Laboratory of 

Sedimentology of the IGc. The images were captured using the Leica Application Suite (LAS) 

V4.7 software. Duplicate samples were submitted to for X-ray diffraction testing to characterize 

the weathering products not usually identifiable in petrographic analyses. These two sets of 

tests were conducted separately at the IGc and the Engineering School of the University of São 

Paulo (EPUSP) laboratories. The weathering grade characterization and the additional work 

carried out on the thin sections are described in Table 5.2. 

The initial procedure was to characterize the dominant weathering processes acting to 

transform the primary mineralogy into secondary minerals and the type of secondary 



98 

 

 

 

mineralogy produced. The information obtained helped in the identification, characterization 

and classification of the microsystems, the mineral weathering pattern and the textural and 

micromorphological aspects of the weathered minerals. The gneissic rock-forming minerals 

and their alteromorphs were described in terms of the weathering grades according to Delvigne 

(1998). Additionally, the cordierite alteromorphs were characterized by intramineral 

weathering petrographic indexes, the extent of weathering index (Ea) and the intramineral 

microfissure index (If), which were used to quantify the disaggregation and decomposition 

processes. The methodology applied in this study and the literature consulted to characterize 

the weathering process are summarized in the flowchart shown in Figure 5.3. 

In the additional step, the cordierite alteromorphs were first identified and compared to 

the weathering stages of the Delvigne (1998) classification. Approximately sixty alteromorphs 

were sampled for the analyses. The Ea index of an alteromorph, expressed as a percentage, is 

the relationship between the area occupied by the secondary products and the total area of the 

original cordierite. The If index, expressed in fissures per millimeter (f/mm), is the number of 

fissures of any type (intra- to transmineral), counted on a scanline drawn inside the alteromorph. 

The scanline was drawn perpendicular to the most pronounced orientation of the observed 

fissures. The measurement and treatment of data were performed using ImageJ software. The 

image treatment consisted of transforming the photomicrograph (taken with crossed nicols) and 

extracting the background using the software tool extract background. By applying this tool, 

the fissures and the relief of the unweathered mineral are enhanced, whereas the weathered 

portion is not. This additional step is described in detail in the flowchart shown in Figure 5.4.

5.4 Results 

 

The results for the gneissic rock characterization will be presented considering the 

cordierite alteromorphs, which are described in detail below. 

 

5.4.1 Gneissic textural and micromorphological characterization 

 

The gneissic rock is composed of quartz (Qz), orthoclase (Fk), plagioclase (Pl), cordierite 

(Cr), biotite (Bt), hypersthene (Hp) and garnet (Gr). Sillimanite and other minerals, including 

opaque minerals, are subordinate. Figure 5.5 shows the most representative photomicrographs 

for the textural and micromorphological characterization and classification developed for the 

mineralogical assemblage of the gneissic rock. Figure 5.6 shows an example of the X-ray 

diffraction test result (sample n°5) used to identify the final weathering product. The dominant 

weathering processes acting to transform the primary minerals to secondary minerals are 



102 

 

 

 

presented in Figure 5.7. The classification of the microsystems, weathering patterns and textural 

modifications of the alteromorphs are organized schematically in Figure 5.8. 

The quartz, resistant to decomposition, suffers preferential disaggregation processes due 

to the occurrence of intra- to transmineral fissures in the microsystems formed with the biotite 

and the cordierite alteromorphs (Figures 5.5 G and 5.7). 

The feldspars (orthoclase and plagioclase - andesine), felsic minerals, undergo a partial 

hydrolysis process with various intermediate minerals throughout their weathering stages, 0 to 

3 and 0 to 4, respectively. The mineralogical transformation of these alteromorphs is triggered 

by sericitization with the formation of sericite (illite), kaolinite and gibbsite.  

The weathering in the orthoclase begins from the edges and cleavages, following a regular 

pattern, whereas in the plagioclase, it starts from the irregular intramineral fissures, following 

an irregular pattern, speckled and patchy. These alteromorphs present secondary products with 

low crystallinity and cavernous residues, with primary mineral nuclei fissuring. These minerals 

present a textural modification characterized by iso-alteromorphs and halo-alteromorphs and 

contribute to an intramineral secondary porosity, which is linked to the secondary mineral 

porosity, and fissural porosity, related to the opening of cleavage planes in the orthoclase 

(Figures 5.5 B - C, 5.7 and 5.8). 

Cordierite and biotite, intermediate mafic minerals, also undergo a partial hydrolysis 

process, producing various intermediate minerals throughout their weathering stages, 0 to 4 and 

0 to 3, respectively. The mineralogical transformation is triggered by pinitization followed by 

chloritization in the cordierite and chloritization in the biotite, with the formation of pinite, 

chlorite, sericite (illite), smectite, kaolinite, gibbsite and goethite. The weathering in the 

cordierite starts from the borders and intramineral fissures in a regular banded pelicular pattern.  

The weathering in the biotite starts from the cleavages, opening them in a regular linear 

parallel pattern. These alteromorphs present secondary products, such as chlorite and smectite, 

that influence the intramineral fissuring process of these alteromorphs as well as of the adjacent 

minerals, forming the microsystems of the gneissic rock matrix. Through weathering stages 1 

to 2, due to crystallization of these secondary products, the modification of the volume of the 

cordierite and biotite alteromorphs is noticeable in at least one crystallographic direction. These 

minerals present a textural modification characterized by meso-alteromorphs and halo-

alteromorphs and contribute to a secondary intramineral porosity, linked to the secondary 



103 

 

 

 

products formed, and fissural porosity, clearly related to the development of fissures and the 

coalescence of intra- and intermineral fissures, forming transmineral fissures (Figures 5.5 F-G, 

5.5 D-E, 5.7 and 5.8). 

 

 

Figure 5.5 - Photomicrographs of the mineral weathering stages and weathering process in fissured quartz (Qz), 

orthoclase (Fk) and plagioclase (Pl) (A – C). Biotite (Bt) undergoing incipient weathering, producing goethite 

(Gth) along some cleavages (D) and interlayered chlorite (Chl) and probably smectite in an advanced weathering 

stage (E). Cordierite (Cr) undergoing weathering, producing pinite (Pn) and chlorite with an incipient wedge 

effect (G) in an advanced weathering condition or producing interlayered pinite, chlorite and probably smectite, 

with sericite (Sr) with an extreme wedge effect (F). Hypersthene (Hp) (H) and garnet (Gr) (I) producing high 

quantities of goethite. In the images, (D – G) depict the fissuring process due to the textural modification of the 

biotite and cordierite alteromorphs. The voids are represented by the letter V, while the mineral weathering 

stages (0 – 4) are denoted inside the brackets. 

 

Hypersthene and garnet, mafic minerals with a small amount of silicon in their 

composition, tend to undergo a very intense alteration process of total hydrolysis plus oxidation 

despite their completely different alterabilities. Hypersthene weathers up to stage 4 in slightly 



104 

 

 

 

to moderately weathered samples, whereas the garnet weathers to stage 3 in completely 

weathered samples. The weathering of these minerals generates large amounts of goethite; in 

particular, weathering of the garnet generates abundant gibbsite.  

The weathering in the hypersthene starts from the edges and cleavages in a regular, 

pelicular to linear pattern. The weathering in the garnet starts from the borders and intramineral 

fissures in an irregular, crossed and linear pattern. These alteromorphs present residual primary 

mineral nuclei that are fissured and in contact with intramineral voids in a skeleton formed by 

goethite. These minerals present a textural modification characterized by iso-alteromorphs and 

poro-alteromorphs, specifically septo-poro-alteromorphs, and contribute to secondary porosity 

related to intramineral pores and fissures (Figures 5.5 H-I, 5.7 and 5.8). 

 

 

Figure 5.6 - Illustration of a X-ray diffraction test showing some of the final weathering products, in this case, 

smectite, illite and kaolinite. 

 

The mafic minerals, when weathered, release Fe2+ ions, which, due to their low mobility, 

soon oxidize and precipitate in the form of goethite, iron oxide and hydroxide, usually filling 

and cementing the intra-, inter- and transmineral fissures, generally increasing the iron content 

in the rock matrix. This aspect can also characterize the texture of the echino-alteromorphs

microsystems in the rock matrix, helping to describe the mineral boundaries and the evolution 

of the fissure microsystem in accordance with each mineral weathering stage (Figure 5.8).

5.4.2 Cordierite textural and micromorphological characterization 

 

The most representative photomicrographs of the evolutionary stages of the 

cordierite alteromorphs and the respective values of Ea and If obtained for 60 minerals 

along their evolutionary stages are presented in Figure 5.9. The evolution of cordierite 

weathering is summarized in Table 5.3 in terms of its textural and micromorphological 

features, evolutionary stages, and petrographic index averages and intervals. 

Cordierite is present in the contact microsystem formed by quartz, orthoclase, 

plagioclase, biotite and garnet and opaque minerals (Ot), overlain by another microsystem 

composed of intramineral fissures related to twinning planes in cordierite and 

transmineral fissures linked to the fracturing of the rock mass. This arrangement is 

considered the initial stage (stage 0) of the textural and micromorphological evolution of 

the cordierite located in the parental microsystem marked by lepido-granoblastic texture 

(Figure 5.9 – stage 0). The minerals identified in stage 0 contain 2.7 intramineral f/mm 

and are practically unweathered (Ea = 0.82%), composing the gneiss parental 

microsystem. The microfissuring connects the weathering agents with the mineral, 

triggering pinitization in the alteromorph (Figure 5.9 and Table 5.3). 

In stage 1 (Figure 5.9 – stage 1), alteroplasmation (a type of pinitization) starts at 

the mineral rims and penetrates through fissures inward, consequently increasing the If 

and Ea values of the alteromorph. Alteroplasmation is regular at the rims and along the 

fissures of the mineral, forming pinite, which is an isotropic material under polarized 

light. Twinning planes, when present, and intramineral to transmineral fissures are 

preferential areas for mineral weathering.  

The weathering pattern is characteristically regular, pelicular combined with linear, 

the resultant alteroplasm or iso-alteromorph being formed by primary cordierite and 

pinite, with a well-defined geometry and shape. Pores were not observed in this 

microsystem. The 10 to 4 f/mm interval is determines the alteromorph textural evolution 

as well as the gradual increase in index Ea along the subsequent stages (Figure 5.9 and 

Table 5.3).

In stage 2 (Figure 5.9 – stage 2), pinitization evolves and develops a kind of banding 

in the secondary minerals with the accumulation of iron oxides and hydroxides (possibly 

goethite) in the weathered minerals. In addition, the number of intramineral fissures in 

the alteromorph increases. Banding occurs with a fine pinite layer at the weathering front, 

accompanied by a crystallized portion of chlorite. Banding occurs both at the mineral 

rims and in the most expressive fissures. Pinitization evolves from the initial stages of 

cordierite weathering, forming chlorite, smectite and kaolinite. Sericite is a potassic 

mineral identified in the most weathered portions of the alteromorph, which are usually 

linked by transmineral fissures to the rock microsystem, where orthoclase and biotite are 

being decomposed.

petrographic intramineral weathering indexes. 

 

The intramineral fissures are oriented in two directions. The fissures in the most 

prominent orientation are filled with evolved minerals, such as chlorite and goethite; the 

secondary direction developed later, and the corresponding fissures may not be filled or 

filled only with pinite. The minerals in contact with the cordierite alteromorphs present 

intramineral fissures filled with secondary minerals that are oriented perpendicularly to 

the contact between these phases, roughly radially around the alteromorph. The analysis 

of the fissures indicates a change in size in one or more directions, which is corroborated 

by the secondary products, characterizing the meso-alteromorphic texture. When goethite 

forms past the cordierite rims and fills the fissures of adjacent minerals, the newly formed 

texture is echino(meso)-alteromorphic. However, in stage 2, the cordierite alteromorphs 

are found in a parental microsystem of superimposed fissural and plasmic microsystems. 

The If values present a subtle increase, while a gradual increase in Ea to values less than 

50% are observed, i.e., a greater proportion of primary mineral (Figure 5.9 and Table 5.3). 

In stage 3 (Figure 5.9 – stage 3), pinitization and chloritization are almost complete, 

isolating irregular, residual nuclei of the primary mineral inside the secondary plasma. 

Pinite and, specifically, chlorite are well crystallized, constituting the main secondary 

minerals of the alteromorph. Pinite is restricted to the weathering fronts and intramineral 

fissures, which propagate through primary mineral nuclei to the rims. Goethite mostly 

fills the fissures. 



111 

 

 

111 

 

In stage 4 (Figure 5.9 – stage 4), pinitization and chloritization are complete in the 

alteromorph. Cordierite is completely weathered and is disaggregated, decomposed, and 

replaced by secondary products (pinite, chlorite, sericite, smectite and goethite). The 

primary mineral nuclei are now distinguished only by the differences in crystallinity 

among the constituting plasma. Mineral weathering makes both the visualization of the 

intramineral fissures and the quantification of If difficult. The alteromorph still preserves 

its original volume, despite being modified in shape. Under the microscope, no pores 

were identified in cordierite alteromorphs when they were completely replaced by 

secondary products, characterizing the final texture as holo-alteromorphic. 

In stages 3 and 4, a great variation in the number of intramineral fissures, between 

7.9 and 19.2 f/mm, is observed; these fissures superimpose those observed in stages 2 and 

1. Nevertheless, a lower limit of approximately 10 f/mm can be established for textural 

evolution in these stages. In stages 3 and 4, the alteromorphs formed by secondary 

products are in a larger proportion than those from the primary mineral; the calculated Ea 

exceeded 68% and increases up to 100%, characterizing the holo-alteromorphic texture 

(Figure 5.9 and Table 5.3). 

 

5.4.3 Petrographic aspects and weathering grade characterization 

 

The main petrographic information regarding the textural and micromorphological 

modifications was gathered in Table 5.4 according to the weathering grades previously 

characterized. Table 5.4 also includes photomicrographs that illustrate the cordierite 

weathering evolution of the gneissic foliation microsystem. 

In the fresh to slightly weathering grades, W1, the gneissic rock matrix is formed 

by a lepido-granoblastic texture with incipient intramineral fissures, and the cordierite 

and plagioclase show incipient weathering. In the moderately weathering grade, W2, the 

weathering continues to the sericitization of the feldspars, orthoclase and plagioclase, and 

the pinitization and chloritization of cordierite and biotite alteromorphs. 

The quartz appears to be fissured by formation of the secondary minerals produced 

by the cordierite and biotite alteromorph rims. The contact microsystem of the lepido-



112 

 

 

 

granoblastic texture starts to be superimposed by fissural and plasmic microsystems. The 

cordierite alteromorphs begin to have a decisive impact because they increase 

intramineral fissuring, forming transminerals along the foliation plane. In the highly to 

completely weathering grade, W3, the rock matrix is completely modified due to 

weathering of the whole primary minerals in different development stages. Cordierite and 

plagioclase alteromorphs were found to be completely weathered to secondary minerals 

presenting meso(holo)- and holo-alteromorphic textures, while orthoclase and biotite 

alteromorphs showed partial development, showing iso- and meso-alteromorphic 

textures, respectively. The initial contact microsystem of the lepido-granoblastic texture 

is not easily recognized due to the superimposition of the fissural and plasmic 

microsystems, which now dominate the rock matrix. 

Among the alteromorph textural modifications that occur with the progression of 

the mineral weathering stages, the main aspects controlling the degradation of the rock 

matrix are associated with the following stages: i) 3 and 4 for the orthoclase and 

plagioclase that are related to the isolation of nuclei of the fissured and cavernous primary 

minerals enveloped by secondary products (Figures 5.5 B-C and 5.8) that define 

weathering grade W3 (Table 5.4); ii) 2 to 4 for the cordierite and biotite that are related 

to the occurrence of fissures in the adjacent minerals and in the alteromorphs and to the 

textural modification classified as meso-alteromorphs (Figures 5.5 D-G and 5.8), which 

are observed in weathering grades W2 and W3, respectively (Table 5.4); and iii) 2 to 4 

for the hypersthene and garnet that are related to the occurrence of intramineral pores, 

isolating cemented nuclei from the primary mineral via fissures (Figures 5.5 H-I and 5.8), 

considered due to the low mineral volumes of the petrographic analyses.

5.5 Discussion and conclusion 

 

The present research focused on a gneissic massif excavated for the construction of 

an unlined tunnel, which remained exposed to weathering for more than 50 years. The 

resulting block instability has affected the logistics of the iron ore railway transport. This 

research was based on mineral textural and micromorphological characterization and 

contributes to the understanding of the weathering and degradation stages that modified 

the mechanical properties of the gneissic rock. 

The edge effect of the biotite alteromorphs that formed in the rock matrix 

deterioration and arenization processes, due to the meso-alteromorphic texture, were well 

documented in the literature to be one of the fabric modifications responsible for strength 

loss of gneissic rock, as observed in Le Pera et al. (2001) and Regmi et al. (2014), as well 

as for the granite rocks (Irfan and Dearman, 1978). However, the cordierite weathering 

behavior of some gneissic lithotypes seems to be relevant but still not fully considered 

properly. Marques et al. (2010) described weathering in Kinzigite, relating the oxidation 

and formation of iron oxides and hydroxides. In their work, the minerals pinite, chlorite, 

sericite and smectite were not considered or described as secondary products, which are 

part of the mineralogy observed in the Nova Venécia gneissic rocks studied here. 

In the foliation plane, under weathering of the gneissic rock studied, the 

microsystem formed of biotite and cordierite alteromorphs produced secondary minerals, 

such as chlorite and smectite, that contributed to the increase in fissuring, triggering 

weathering of the whole mineral; this weathering caused deep changes in the mineral 

bond, consequently decreasing the rock strength. The Monte Seco Tunnel was excavated 

in a gneissic rock mass that is in a tropical climate marked by wetting and drying cycles, 

which intensifies this type of weathering and rock matrix fragility, undoubtably 

contributing to rock block instability problems. 

Cordierite distributed in the rock mass (intact rock) and concentrated along the 

foliation planes is destroyed by pinitization, chloritization and replaced by pinite, chlorite, 

sericite, smectite, kaolinite and goethite along cleavage planes, intramineral fissures and 

the alteromorph rims. The corresponding weathering pattern is characterized by the 

generation of secondary crystalline products that interfere in the intramineral fissuring of 

the adjacent minerals that form the rock microsystem, leading to a textural change 



115 

 

 

115 

 

characterized by meso-alteromorphs and halo-alteromorphs. 

The presence of the meso-alteromorphic texture in the cordierite and biotite 

characterize weathering grades W2 and W3, respectively. These weathered minerals 

contribute to the generation of a secondary fissural porosity, and the resulting textural 

change reflects the fragility mechanism of the crystalline fabric or the lepido-granoblastic 

texture. The tropical environment intensifies the effects of this type of fragility because 

wetting and drying cycles allow the secondary materials that fill the fissures to leach or 

expand and contract, further loosening the bonds between the minerals and compromising 

cohesion. 

This analysis is fundamental to the understanding of the role played by the gneissic 

foliation in the instability of the blocks in a tunnel with no lining. Foliation is known to 

be a plane of minimal strength or traction, characterizing surfaces that favor the separation 

of blocks from the rock mass. When the minerals present in the foliation, such as biotite 

and cordierite, undergo weathering, they promote fissuring of the crystalline fabric and 

the subsequent loosening of the mineral bonds. Thus, biotite and cordierite textural 

modifications have a decisive influence on the loss of mechanical strength of wet rock, 

which deserves proper attention because of its relevance for determining the maintenance 

for and lifetime of the Monte Seco Tunnel.

6. THE INFLUENCE OF WEATHERING GRADES ON GNEISSIC ROCK4  

 

 

Abstract 

This paper presents the influence of weathering grade on gneissic rock behaviour under 

tropical climatic conditions. The studied rock mass, through which a tunnel was 

excavated, was not reinforced by lining during tunnel construction and thus has been 

exposed to weathering for more than fifty years. This rock mass is starting to present 

problems related to block instability, motivating the re-evaluation of the geotechnical 

properties of the rock mass (intact rock). The physical properties (density and porosity), 

rebound number (RL), compressional wave velocity (Vp), uniaxial compressive strength 

(UCS), indirect tensile strength (ITS) and tangent elastic modulus (E) were correlated 

with the micropetrographic index (Ip), physical weathering degree (PWD), and strength 

ratio (RS) for weathering grade characterization. The analyses indicated that mineral 

fragility influences the mechanical behaviour. A strength degradation relationship that is 

a function of weathering was suggested. A quantitative weathering grade was presented, 

which is important for tunnel maintenance, future engineering interventions and regional 

rock formation studies. Data from relevant literature were used to propose the normalized 

general degradation strength for gneissic rock and other rocks with the same 

mineralogical composition.

6.1 Introduction 

 

The Monte Seco Tunnel (Espírito Santo State, Brazil) is a segment of the Vitória-

Minas Railway (VMR) and was excavated in a gneissic rock mass; additionally, this 

tunnel has lining only at the entrance and exit. Since this tunnel was constructed in the 

1950s, it has experienced a degradation of its initial mechanical characteristics due to the 

long-term exposure of the rock to weathering, resulting in rock falls from the ceiling and 

walls. VMR is responsible for the transport of iron ore from the Quadrilátero Ferrífero 

(Iron Quadrangle), in the state of Minas Gerais, to the Vitória ports, in the state of Espírito 

Santo, and its full operation is fundamental because ore supply interruption can cause 

logistical issues. Detailed assessment of the present geologic-geotechnical conditions of 

the Monte Seco Tunnel has indicated the risks associated with rock instability, 

constituting a fundamental part of several studies from GeoInfraUSP – EPUSP (Cacciari 

and Futai, 2016, 2017; Monticelli et al., 2019a,b). 

A commonly studied subject is the rock weathering grade characterization and its 

relation to gneissic behaviour; however, the proposed classifications are usually 

qualitative graded from lowest to highest grade (hence, from highest to lowest mechanical 

strength), considering three to five grades (fresh, slightly weathered, moderately 

weathered, and highly weathered, for example) and based on weathering profiles and 

visual-tactile assessment of the intact rock (Deere and Patton, 1971 and  ISRM, 2015). 

Weathering grades have been correlated with the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of 

rock (BS 5930, 1999; Hoek and Brown, 1997), thus assigning quantitative values. 

However, each rock type should be appropriately studied, and the classification of 

weathering grades should be based on existing experience and correct interpretation of 

local conditions and field and laboratory test results, appropriate to the level of the 

research project. 

The focus of this study was the weathering grade characterization of a gneissic rock 

by the application of petrographic and physical-mechanical weathering indexes. The 

gneissic rock matrix was previously classified in terms of its petrographic facies in 

accordance with mineralogical properties and by means of tactile and visual weathering 

grade characterization. After classification, the samples were submitted to petrographic 

and physical-mechanical tests. The physical properties (density and porosity), rebound 



121 

 

 

121 

 

number (RL), compressional wave velocity (Vp), UCS, indirect tensile strength (ITS) and 

tangent elastic modulus (E) were correlated with the micropetrographic index (Ip) of Irfan 

and Dearman (1978), the physical weathering degree (PWD) of Esaki and Jian (1999), 

the coefficient of weathering (IVp) of Illiev (1966) and the unsound constituent (UC) and 

strength ratio (RS) indexes of Gupta and Rao (2001). 

The petrographic and the engineering weathering indexes could distinguish the 

gneissic petrographic facies behaviours; the results indicated that one of the facies 

exhibits a more moderate weathering grade than those of the other facies. The 

heterogeneity of the gneissic rock mass along the tunnel length may have allowed the 

geomechanical properties to be overestimated in previous investigations. 

The analysis of these conditions and the results of the tests led to the proposition of 

a curve of the degradation of strength and stiffness related to the weathering of gneissic 

rock. The quantitative weathering information obtained in this research is fundamental 

for Monte Seco Tunnel maintenance, future engineering interventions and other 

applications related to the effect of weathering on the geomechanical behaviour of rock 

masses with the same lithology. 

 

6.2 Background 

 

Petrographic weathering indexes are used to qualify and quantify the intensity and 

the evolution of the decomposition and disintegration processes that affect the minerals 

that form the rock matrix. Engineering indexes are used to express the physical-

mechanical property degradation along a continuous scale or range along the weathering 

grade scale, and if possible, define its limits. 

Among the most widely used petrographic indexes is the Ip of Irfan and Dearman 

(1978). Ip relates the number of sound minerals (SM) to the UCs (unsound or weathered 

minerals, UMs; fissures, Fs; and pores, Vs) and characterizes both the decomposition and 

the disaggregation processes of the minerals according to Eq. 1.

The PWD was defined by Esaki and Jian (1999); it relates the secondary porosity 

of a weathered sample to the total secondary porosity of the rock acquired after 

weathering and could provide additional information in rock characterization. However, 

the PWD application requires knowledge of the variation in porosity (?) along the 

weathering profile. The PWD is calculated according to Eq. 2, where ?f represents the 

fresh rock, ?w is the weathered rock and ?u represents the ultimate weathering product, 

usually the complete or the extreme weathering grade.

The index usually used to quantify weathering aspects is the coefficient of 

weathering (IVp) proposed by Iliev (1966); this index quantifies the Vp loss in the 

weathered rock and is calculated according to Eq. 3, where Vpf represents the fresh rock 

and Vpw represents the weathered rock. The index is multiplied by 100 to obtain its value 

as a percentage. The author suggested an IVp value of approximately 0% for weathering 

grade I, between 0-20% for grade II, 20-40% for grade III, 40-60% for grade IV and 60-

100% for grade V. Weathering grades I-V are comparable to those of the ISRM (2015) 

classification.

Among the mechanical weathering indexes, the strength ratio (RS) was introduced 

by Gupta and Rao (2001) to characterize and quantify weathering grades with a rapid 

assessment of the effects of mechanical degradation. Although this index did not develop 

through research in gneissic lithotypes, the authors demonstrated that the index (RS) is a 

useful tool in the assessment of the variation in elastic modulus due to the weathering of 

quartzite, basalt and granite. In addition, IVp could be used to estimate the UCS in RS 

calculations. RS relates the UCS of the rock in weathering states (UCSw) with the fresh 

rock (UCSf), and it is calculated according to Eq. 4.

6.3 Materials and methods 

 

Samples of the rock mass were obtained from blocks from the Monte Seco Tunnel; 

the different weathering grade samples were collected manually in the outcrop. The 

samples were collected from the same rock mass in the Monte Seco Tunnel and included 

all weathering grades. 

The rainfall varies from 100 to 120 cm in the summer and from 50 to 20 cm in the 

winter, and the temperature varies from 28 to 26 °C in the summer and from 22 to 20 °C 

in the winter. Dearman et al. (1978) define this climate condition as tropical because there 

are dry and rainy seasons. In tropical conditions, such as the climate of the studied area, 

the physical-chemical weathering intensity varies from moderate to very slight and 

controls the disaggregation and decomposition of rock. 

The characterization of the gneissic rock was carried out by means of tactile-visual 

inspection and petrography. The fresh gneissic rock of the study area is light grey to bluish 

dark-grey and predominantly fine- to medium-grained with a secondary coarse-grained 

texture. Centimetre- to metre-sized bands that correspond to the mesosome are 

characterized by a lepidogranoblastic texture and a biotite-rich gneiss foliation, 

interspersed with millimetre-sized light (felsic) and centimetre-sized quartz-feldspathic 

lenses. Well-formed bands of granoblastic texture correspond to the medium- to coarse-

grained leucosome composed of feldspar, quartz, cordierite, garnet and opaque minerals. 

The presence of these features, which are closely related to the metamorphism of a 

sedimentary prototype, leads to the heterogeneity of the rock matrix. 

This gneissic banding was classified into petrographic facies B1, B2 and B3, 

according to mineral composition, structure, texture and grain size (Table 6.1). The 

samples were carefully collected from drilling cores and outcropping rock blocks in the 

vicinity of the southern part of the Monte Seco Tunnel to represent the three alteration 

horizons of the rock mass. The weathering grades of the samples were characterized 

according to the proposal presented in Table 6.2, which was based on the Hoek and Brown 

(1997), the BS 5930 (1999), and the ISRM (2015) weathering classifications. To consider 

the abrupt weathering changes observed in field investigations (Monticelli et al. 2019a) 

and the rock heterogeneity, the fresh grade (I) and slightly weathered grade (II) were 



124 

 

 

 

grouped into grade W1, while the highly weathered grade (IV) and completely weathered 

grade (V) were grouped into grade W3. The moderately weathered grade (III) was 

maintained in W2. In this proposal, the W1 and W3 grades could be distinguished, by 

their tactile features, through the results of laboratory tests. 

Petrographic analysis and physical-mechanical testing (physical property testing, 

rebound hardness testing, ultrasonic, in their tactile features, UCS and ITS analysis) were 

carried out at the laboratories of the Institute of Geosciences (IGc), EPUSP and the 

Engineering School of São Carlos at the University of São Paulo. The textural and 

micromorphological characterization of the rock-forming minerals was presented in 

Monticeli et al. (2019b). The mineral composition, structure, texture and grain size of the 

rock were described, as well as an accurate description of the grades and types of 

weathering and mineral cracking. 

The Ip ratio was modified in Eq. 5 to capture the development of fissures and the 

coalescence of intramineral fissures in the formation of transmineral fissures due to the 

mineral fragility of the cordierite and biotite alteromorphs (Figure 6.1, blue boxes), which 

are determinant for the rock matrix modifications. Figure 6.1 illustrates the criteria used 

to calculate the modified micropetrographic index (Ip mod) of the gneissic rock of the 

Monte Seco Tunnel based on the Delvigne (1998) standardized classification of 

weathered minerals.

The modal composition of SM and UC was obtained by counting points for each 

sample. The point counting was performed using the JMicroVision software following a 

random mesh in representative microsites of the thin sections, analysed under the Leica 

Zeiss Axioplan optical microscope. The counting ended when the proportions became 

constant at 200 points. Approximately 12 microsites were investigated in each thin 

section, totalling 2400 points analysed in this way. A total of fifteen thin sections were 

used to characterize the weathering grades. The photomicrographs were captured using 

the Leica Application Suite V4.7 software.

Representative specimens of each petrographic facies (Table 6.1) and weathering 

grade (Table 6.2) were submitted to physical tests. Porosity, density and apparent 

absorption were obtained following the ISRM (1979a) guidelines. MTS equipment was 

used to determine the UCS of the 53 dry samples. The UCS testing was performed 



127 

 

 

127 

 

following the ISRM (1979b) guidelines. The tangent elastic modulus (E) of the 17 dry 

samples was also obtained by using local instrumentation with a strain gauge. The angle 

(?) between the foliation and load direction for weathering grades W1, W2 and W3 was 

approximately 60°, 0° and 90°, respectively. The ITS testing of 44 dry samples was 

carried out by using the EMIC test equipment with curved loading jaws, following the 

procedures recommended by the ASTM D 3967-08 (2008) guidelines. The angle (?) 

between the foliation and load direction was either 0° (parallel) or 90° (perpendicular). 

In the sclerometry test, a Proceq, type L (0.735 Nm), digital Silver Schmidt 

hammer, which has a system for rebound correction in relation to the orientation of the 

device application, which is the main advantage of this sclerometer over other hammers, 

was used in the rock weathering characterization. Ample debate on the method to obtain 

the rebound number is observed in the literature; single or continuous impacts are usually 

performed (Hucka, 1965; Poole and Farmer, 1980; ASTM D5983-00, 2001; Kahraman et 

al., 2002; Aydin and Basu, 2005; Buyuksagis and Goktan, 2007; Aydin, 2009). In this 

work, the methodology of ASTM (2001) was used, which proposes 10 single impacts 

separated by at least the diameter of the sclerometer point and collected away from the 

sample edges to avoid effects. 

Following the guidelines of Aydin (2014), the compressional wave velocity test 

was carried out on the cylindrical specimens using the Pundit Lab+ equipment from 

Proceq, positioned in a direct transmission manner with transducers of 250 kHz, where 

the average of five measurements was recorded for weathering characterization. After the 

laboratory tests, the physical-mechanical weathering indexes were calculated with Eqs. 2 

to 4. Based on the RS index proposed by Gupta and Rao (2001) (Eq. 4), the indirect tensile 

strength ratio (RITS) and compression elastic modulus ratio (RE) were calculated and 

introduced in the same manner in this study.

6.4 Influence of weathering on the petrographic and physical properties of 

gneissic rocks 

 

The result of the SC and UC counting points showed that the gneissic Ips values, 

compared to those of granite, do not indicate a weathering evolution and descriptions that 

are the same nor reflect the same petrographic characteristics of those determined by Irfan 

and Dearman (1978). For these reasons and seeking to adapt and calibrate a weathering 

grade classification (I-V, from fresh to completely weathered) to the gneissic rock matrix 

evolution, the most representative photomicrographs of the petrographic facies, their 

respective Ipmod and the previously associated weathering grade (Table 6.2) are shown in 

Figure 6.2. 

There is a clear difference between the Ip mod values among the weathering grades 

and petrographic facies. Compared to facies B1 and B2, the B3 thin samples previously 

characterized by grade W1 (Table 6.2) present many intra- to transmineral fissures related 

to cordierite and orthoclase alteromorphs, which decreases the fit of the Ip mod values for 

the moderately weathered grade W2 (III) and highly weathered grade (IV) (Figure 6.2, 

sample numbers 11-14). On the other hand, the decrease in Ip mod for the petrographic 

facies B1 and B2 is due the development of intra- to transmineral fissures related to the 

meso-alteromorph textural and micromorphological modification presented in the 

cordierite and biotite alteromorphs.  

This textural modification influences the fissuring of the adjacent minerals, 

consequently connecting plasmic microsystems and increasing the whole mineral 

decomposition (Figure 6.2, samples numbers 1-10). These aspects are fundamental to 

understanding the influence of mineralogical characteristics on the gneissic rock 

behaviour after calibration of the relation among the petrographic facies and weathering 

intensity with a continuously decreasing Ip mod.

Figure 6.2 - Photomicrographs illustrating the evolution of the fissures in facies B1 (sample numbers 1-5), B2 (sample numbers 6-10) and B3 (sample numbers 11-15) 

according to the Ip mod and the comparison between the initial (Table 6.2) and the general (I-V) weathering grade classifications. The samples numbers 1 to 15 are denoted in 

white, and the values of Ip mod are denoted in red. Intramineral (Fi), intermineral (Fe) and transmineral (Ft) fissures are indicated. 



131 

 

 

131 

 

Notably, the behaviour observed in facies B3 is influenced by the granulometry 

(Table 6.1), which, due to the high quantities of coarse-grained minerals, increases the 

mineral embrittlement, resulting in open cleavages in the orthoclase and fissures in the 

cordierite alteromorphs. 

The petrographic aspects of the gneissic banding (Table 6.1), which are closely 

related to the suggested weathering grade rearrangement (Figure 6.2), are also responsible 

for the variation in the physical properties, density and porosity, as presented in Figure 

6.3. Facies B1 and B2, rich in mafic minerals with tight intramineral fissures, such as 

those found in biotite, are more dense than facies B3, rich in felsic coarse-grained 

minerals with incipient intra- to transmineral fissuring, for the same porosity range in the 

low weathering grades (0.2-2%). Due to the development of secondary porosity related 

to the increase in fissuring and mineral decomposition, the variation in density among the 

petrographic facies decreases with the porosity, although some B3 densities seem to be 

outside the limits of density determined for previously studied gneissic rock.

132 

 

 

 

The average results of the petrographic analyses, Ip mod, physical properties (bulk 

density and porosity), Vp and RL were organized in Figure 6.4. The average values were 

calculated based on Ip mod and RS for general weathering grade classification (I, II, III, IV 

and V, from fresh to completely weathered). Basically, facies B3 were grouped into 

grades III, IV and V, unlike facies B1 and B2, due to the petrographic characteristic data 

(Figure 6.2), and further considerations will be given for mechanical degradation. In terms 

of the major petrographic and physical aspects of the effect of weathering on gneissic 

rock, it can be observed that Ip mod density, Vp and RL decrease and porosity increases as 

weathering becomes more severe. The resultant significative coefficients of 

determination support the rearrangement of the gneissic rock weathering grades and the 

observed modifications to the rock matrix. These relationships provide useful and 

accessible information to characterize gneissic weathering grades (Figures 6.2 and 6.4), 

although a preliminary heterogeneity classification may be needed to comprehensively 

evaluate the gneissic behaviours.  

Regarding the sclerometry test results, a comparison between the rebound values 

obtained on the surfaces of the weathered rock blocks (RLsur) and the average of the 

samples extracted from them (RLint) was performed (Figure 6.5). Under ideal conditions, 

there would be no difference between RLsur and RLint. However, in general, the RLsur values 

of the weathered rock blocks were observed to be lower than the RLint values, and this 

trend was observed for a continuous range of known rebound values.  

In the rock blocks that are more homogenously weathered or exhibit an advanced 

weathering condition, e.g., block J, this difference seems to be smaller, but often the 

samples extracted from such rock blocks are broken during the sclerometry test. This 

indicates a possible limit in the rebound values of cylindrical samples due to sample 

breaking. On the other hand, in heterogeneously weathered rock blocks, for rock blocks 

presenting less advanced weathering conditions with exfoliation weathering, the 

difference is slightly greater, e.g., block H, reflected by the data point plotting farther 

from the 1:1 line in Figure 6.5. In general, the broken samples were re-utilized to produce 

ITS samples to determine the approximate relationships between RL, VP, and UCS and 

the rock indirect tensile strength, as shown below.

Figure 6.4 - Relationships among the average values of the petrographic index, physical properties (bulk 

density and porosity), compression wave velocity and rebound number with the general weathering grades. 

 

The relationship between RLsur and RLint shows that it is important to consider that 

the extracted samples of a weathered rock block can be weak enough to be broken with a 

few rebounds, in a sense, setting the expectations for the rebound results of the samples 

(RLcp) and indicating that a weaker sclerometry device may be used to improve the 

weathering characterization. In addition, the joint compressive strength (JCS) estimation 

of the Barton and Choubey (1977) criterion is incorporated once the cylindrical specimens 

that were extracted close to a weathered discontinuity surface show rebounds higher than 

the true weathering condition of the discontinuity surface, and this estimate is more 

significant in heterogeneously weathered rock blocks. 



134 

 

 

 

 

Figure 6.5 - Results of sclerometry tests carried out in heterogeneously weathered rock blocks. Rebound 

numbers were obtained from the rock block surface (RL sur), the extracted sample (RL cp) and the average 

values of the extracted samples (RL int). 

 

6.5 Influence of weathering on strength and deformability 

 

The photographic records of the UCS and ITS samples in weathering grade W3 

(IV-V) and the representative stress-strain (displacement) curves for the general 

weathering grades are shown in Figure 6.6. The comparison of the ITS values obtained 

parallel and transverse to foliation in the extreme weathering grades is shown in Figure 

6.7. The UCS, ITS and E values were correlated with bulk density and porosity in Figure 

6.8 and with RL and Vp in Figure 6.9. Figure 6.10 shows the relationship between E and 

ITS with UCS along the general weathering grade classification. Unfortunately, it was 



135 

 

 

135 

 

not possible to characterize E with confidence in the moderately weathering grade 

because the material became deformable, and it was difficult to fix the local 

instrumentation. Figures 6.6 to 6.10 summarize the geomechanics results and are 

discussed below. 

The axial and splitting rupture modes were observed in the UCS tests for all the 

petrographic facies, but for the material with advanced weathering conditions, one shear 

failure was usually observed in facies B1, while multiple shear failures were observed in 

facies B2 and B3 (Figure 6.6a-c). 

The foliation of the gneissic rock studied weakly influenced the UCS values in 

weathering grade W1 (I-II) of facies B1 and B2, as was noticed by one rupture along the 

foliation plane oriented at 60°, resulting in a UCS of 77 MPa, was disregarded in the 

relationships between the physical and mechanical properties shown below. 

Dobereiner et al. (1993) noted that the difference between parallel and transverse 

UCS values increases with weathering, but Marques et al. (2010) argued that the gneissic 

rock becomes more isotropic. The foliation effect was not fully addressed in the UCS 

characterization; however, the ratio between the transverse and  parallel ITS values of 

facies B1-B2 in the extremes weathering grades indicated an increase in the foliation 

effect with weathering (Figure 6.7). 

In general, the ITS is higher in specimens loaded in a direction transverse to 

foliation than those loaded parallel to foliation. However, when the weathering grades 

increase, the effect of anisotropy increase, and the ratios of parallel to transverse ITS 

results can be compared. This ratio is 0.65 for grades I-II and decreases to 0.37 for grades 

IV-V. This result indicate that weathering reduces the strength along the foliation planes.

The increase in the effect of foliation on the ITS values could be related to the 

cordierite and biotite textural modifications. The aligned contact microsystem of the 

biotite-cordierite foliation plane in the low weathering grades or the lepidogranoblastic 

texture is superimposed by parallel and transverse transmineral fissuring triggered by the 

weathering of these minerals in the advanced weathering grade. 

 

 

Figure 6.7 - Comparison between parallel and transverse tensile strength values obtained for the extreme 

weathering grades. 

 

The difference in the mineralogical conditions among the petrographic facies was 

easily recognized in the relationships between the UCS and ITS results and the physical 

properties. The petrographic facies B3 samples presented UCS and ITS maximum values 

of approximately 100 MPa and 6 MPa, respectively, while those of the B1-B2 facies were 

approximately 160 MPa and 11 MPa (Figure 6.8a-d). For granite, according to Sajid et 

al. (2016), the increase in mineral grain size decreases the UCS and ITS strengths in the 

less advanced weathering grades. This aspect also influenced the variation in strength 

observed in facies B1-B2 to B3 in the UCS and ITS tests. Facies B3 presents UCS and 

ITS values that plot roughly in the middle of the mechanical degradation trend in relation 

to facies B1-B2 (Figure 6.8a-b).

The mechanical responses of UCS, ITS and E have practically the same tendency 

(Figure 6.8); the value increases with bulk density, and the opposite trend is observed 

with porosity. For bulk densities higher than 2.6 g/cm3 or porosities lower than 2%, the 

strength and stiffness of the rock increase rapidly. The fit of the proposed correlation 

equation is better with porosity than with bulk density. 

In the estimation of the mechanical properties by non-destructive testing, the 

foliation and heterogeneity effects increase the variation in the data (Figure 6.9); thus, the 

average gneissic rock behaviour is characterized. High coefficients of determination were 

observed for the relationships among UCS, ITS and E from the non-destructive tests (RL 

and Vp values), despite the low amount of E data used for the correlation (Figure 6.9). 

The sclerometry device used was a useful tool for the rock weathering characterization, 

although a weaker sclerometry device could have been used for the characterization of 

advanced weathered grade rock materials, as interpreted above; however, when correlated 

with mechanical properties, the variation in rebound number was most significant in the 

low weathering grades (Figure 6.9a).  

The rock samples broken in the sclerometry tests were recycled and used in the 

ITS tests, which providing information for rock weathering characterization in field 

inspections, although the foliation effect was not fully assessed (Figure 6.9c-d). The IVp 

index was not capable of distinguishing grades W1 and W3, and its relationship with Vp 

was consistent with those of the other properties (Figure 6.9b, d, e). The correlations using 

RL and VP to determine UCS, ITS and E were represented by power functions. These 

relationships are important in practical applications because RL and VP can be used to 

determine in situ conditions and mechanical parameters indirectly.

One of the major topics discussed in rock mechanics is the proportionality 

between the UCS and ITS and the UCS and E (Perras and Diederichs, 2014). These 

proportionalities are not well known for gneissic rocks, especially in the characterization 

of weathering grades, but good results were obtained for the studied gneissic rock (Figure 

6.10). The ratio between ITS and UCS is 0.066, and that between E and UCS is 380. It is 

useful to estimate ITS and E by using UCS.

For gneissic rocks, usually, either petrographic or geochemical indexes are used 

for physical-mechanical properties in rock weathering characterization. Here, the 

petrographic weathering indexes (Ip mod and UC mod) of the studied gneissic rock were 

correlated with the mechanical parameters (UCS, ITS and E) for weathering grades I-V, 

as shown in Figure 6.11. Ip mod showed slightly higher coefficients of determination than 

UCmod, which demonstrates that the Ip mod can also characterize heterogeneous and 

metamorphic rocks, such as the gneissic rock of the Monte Seco Tunnel. In addition, the 

ratio (SC/UC) seems to be a better alternative to relating the mineralogical constituents 

and their respective textural modification effects than considering only UC as the 

petrographic weathering index.

6.6 Discussion 

 

The quantification of the gneissic rock weathering in terms of UCS, ITS and elastic 

modulus (E) can be obtained through the physical index PWD and petrographic index Ip 

(micropetrographic index). According to the presented methodology, it is necessary to 

correctly identify the extreme porosity values (maximum, ?u, and minimum, ?f) for the 

correct application of the PWD index, as well as the maximum strength and elastic 



143 

 

 

143 

 

modulus values (UCSmax, ITSmax and Emax) and the R (S,ITS,E) index. In addition, the 

application of petrographic indexes, such as Ip, it should be supported by textural and 

micromorphological criteria. A petrographic index based on a ratio of mineralogical 

characteristics seems better relates the weathering increase than a single aspect. 

The results presented previously can explain the influence of weathering on the 

petrographic, physical and other measures and on the mechanical properties of the rock; 

there are sufficient tests results to explore deeply. The index properties of the rock were 

tested, and the PWD presented results that better represent the weathering grade, which 

can be determined by simple tests. The strength has to be normalized, as proposed by 

Gupta and Rao (2001), and the same principle was used to normalize not only the UCS 

but also the ITS and E (Eq. 6).

where R is the strength and stiffness degradation, UCS is the uniaxial compressive 

strength, ITS is the indirect tensile strength, E is the elastic modulus, the subscript w 

denotes weathered simples, and the subscript f denotes fresh samples. 

Both the porosity and strength (or E) were normalized for the normalized curve, 

which represents the effect of weathering on the gneissic rock mass of the Monte Seco 

Tunnel. The result of the normalized UCS, ITS and E versus PWD is presented in Figure 

6.12. Figure 6.12a is plotted on an arithmetical scale, and PWD is presented in the log 

plot in Figure 6.12b.  

The results indicate that one unique curve can be used to represent the degradation 

weathering effect (Figure 6.12). It is an interesting and innovated result that should be 

tested for other rock lithologies, and in the future, the general behaviour of mechanical 

degradation under weathering should be determined. The degradation curve can be 

represented by Eq. 7:

                                                             (7) 

 

Note that the UCS, ITS and E degradation curves of the Monte Seco Tunnel rock 

mass have the same form (Eq. 7) and depend on PWD only. Therefore, the same 

degradation function will be able to determine all parameters. For example, the weathered 

UCS is obtained by Eq. 8, and the same procedure can be performed for ITS and E.

1+0.1 ???1.4
 ????                                            (8) 

 

These preliminary results motivated us to infer the application of this theory to 

other rock masses with similar mineralogical and textural characteristics. Five data points 

were selected from the literature to represent UCS results for a large range of weathering 

conditions (PWD): gneiss (Dobereiner et al., 1993), quartzite and kinzigite (Gupta and 

Rao, 2001), augen gneiss and leptinite (Marques et al., 2010). The literature data were 

normalized by using the same approach as that used for the Monte Seco Tunnel test data 

(Eq. 4 and Eq. 6), and the results are presented in Figure 6.12c (arithmetic scale) and 

Figure 6.12d (PWD plot in log scale). The parameters used to normalize the mechanical 

parameters are shown in Table 6.3. The normalized literature data plot in the same range 

as the Monte Seco Tunnel data and can be represented by a unique function. The 

innovative result is that Eq. 8 can be used with the results of all the data. Figure 6.12a 

indicates that Eq. 8 can represent the normalized results of UCS, ITS and E, and Figure 

6.12c shows the Eq. 8 fit result of UCS for different rocks with the same characteristics. 

A general, qualitative and quantitative synthesis of Monte Seco gneissic rock 

weathering is presented in Table 6.4. Table 6.4 was constructed for weathering grades I 

to V, for which the rock matrix mineralogical modifications were related to the 

geotechnical parameters. For example, cordierite (Cr) and biotite (Bt) are minerals that 

control the matrix bond loss of the gneissic rock of the Monte Seco Tunnel because they 

trigger cracks in the adjacent minerals in grades III and IV (more intense cracking in 

degree IV), a situation that does not occur in grades I and II. The weathering grades III 

and IV present significant reductions in their strength parameters, for example, grade III 



145 

 

 

145 

 

has a UCS between 100-30, whereas grades I and II have a UCS&gt; 100 MPa. Quantitative 

information about weathering (Table 6.4) is important for Monte Seco Tunnel 

maintenance and future engineering interventions. 

The PWD and R-value of Table 6.4b should be considered a general result for 

gneissic rock and similar lithologies and could be used to define the degradation effect 

on mechanical properties.

6.7 Conclusion 

 

The paper presents data on a complete range of weathering conditions, index 

properties and mechanical properties of the Monte Seco Tunnel gneissic rock mass. A 

mineralogical and petrological study was performed to explain the effect of weathering 

on the rock microstructure. Three petrographic facies (B1, B2 and B3) were identified. 

The weathering index of the gneissic rock mass was associated with its microsystem 

evolution, weathering pattern, textural and micromorphological classification. 

Facies B1 and B2 are rich in mafic minerals with tight intramineral fissures (biotite), 

resulting in higher density values than those for facies B3, which include felsic coarse-

grained minerals with incipient intra- to transmineral fissuring. 

Ip mod was used to quantify the mineralogical weathering effect. The relationships 

among Ip mod, physical properties (bulk and porosity), RL and Vp were defined, and the 

index clearly depended on both these rock properties and the weathering grade. 

The anisotropy was determined from the transverse and parallel ITS results. The 

effect of anisotropy increases with weathering grades.   

The mechanical properties (UCS, ITS and E) and the bulk density, RL and Vp 

decrease with increasing of porosity. These results directly reflect the influence of 

weathering on the mechanical properties. 

A general degradation curve for this gneissic rock mass and correlated lithology 

was proposed. The normalized UCS, ITS and E of the Monte Seco Tunnel rock mass fit 

the same function and depend on PWD. The degradation curve can represent the 

weathering effect of 6 lithologies. This result may be different for rocks from other rock 

formations or with different microstructural arrangements, textures, mineralogies, etc. 

However, this paper introduces an approach for grouping normalized data and can be used 

to create a general classification of weathering grade associated with quantitative 

information.

7. GENERAL REMARKS 

 

In the weathering study of the gneissic rock mass, the geological and geotechnical 

investigations focusing on structural geology were of fundamental importance to develop 

the concept model of weathering advance in the Monte Seco Tunnel. The study of the 

genesis of the structures along the geologic time helped explain the difference of intensity 

and type of fracturing that affects the rock mass in depth, permitting characterize specific 

weathering profiles along the tunnel. The weathering advance in the gneissic rock mass 

is clearly structurally controlled. 

In the critical sector C, ca. 120 m far from the southern entrance, the weathering 

advanced via foliation Sn and discontinuity set F2 of the Precambrian age, reactivated 

during the Cretaceous, and via discontinuity set F1 of Cenozoic age. The Neotectonism 

(Cenozoic age) is responsible the changing the drainage pattern in the study area and for 

originating discontinuity set F1, which currently conditions water infiltration in sector A. 

This process is also responsible for the denudation and uplift of the rock mass, which 

helped the formation of relief fractures (discontinuity set F3) related to the foliation, 

parallel to hillside in sector B. These geologic events trigger the destabilization of rock 

blocks that impact iron ore transport logistics by the VALE S.A. Vitória-Minas Railway 

in the Monte Seco Tunnel. The sector D there is no conditions to weathering advance and 

the fall of blocks can be disregarded comparatively to sectors A, B and C. 

Once the weathering was recognized throughout the rock mass, the heterogeneity 

of the intact rock was classified in petrographic facies and analyzed by thin sections and 

physical-mechanical tests. The use of standardized classification of the textural and 

micromorphological modification of the minerals helped characterize the increase of intra 

to transmineral fissures and the mineral weathering stages related to the mechanical 

degradation in each weathering grade. These procedures were needed to understand the 

gneissic rock matrix transformations and identify the minerals - and modifications in their 

crystal fabric - responsible for the alterability of the petrographic facies and the influence 

in the strength degradation in the tropical environment.  

The cordierite and biotite Meso-alteromorphs textural modifications acts as an edge 

effect triggering the increase of intra to transmineral fissuring processes of gneissic rock

matrix, which conducts a significant bond loss among whole minerals and progressively 

drops in the gneissic mechanical values in the weathering grades II-III and III-IV, 

respectively. The increase of grain size of the minerals from facies B1 to B3 influenced 

the fissure increasing and the cordierite weathering conducting higher disaggregation 

process to facies B3, comparatively to facies B1 and B2. Based on the petrographic and 

physical-mechanical indexes, such as Ip, Id 4° and RS, facies B3 was placed at the start of 

the moderately weathered grade (III), thus an unfavorable rock matrix characteristic to 

the Monte Seco Tunnel. 

The development of this work also made it possible to propose an equation for 

estimating the alterability parameter in the RMR 2014 update, which contributes to a 

better distribution of its values and allows the distinction of geomechanical sections of 

heterogeneous geological substrates, such as the Monte Seco Tunnel. However, the 

assessment of this parameter by slake durability test needs to be further investigated by 

the geological engineering community for define the number of cycles, his applicability 

and influences in tunneling projects.  

A general degradation curve for this gneissic rock mass and correlated lithology 

was proposed. The normalized UCS, ITS and E of the Monte Seco Tunnel rock mass fit 

the same function and depend on PWD. The degradation curve can represent the 

weathering effect of 6 lithologies. This result may be different for rocks from other rock 

formations or with different microstructural arrangements, textures, mineralogies, etc. 

However, this dissertation introduces an approach for grouping normalized data and can 

be used to create a general classification of weathering grade associated with quantitative 

information. 

The methodology developed herein to the weathering study of a gneissic rock mass 

can be applied to unsupported tunnels with problems of block instability, not only along 

the Vitória-Minas Railway, but also in other geologically similar regions. The present 

study of the Mantiqueira Complex is of interest to Southern Brazil, where important 

metropolitan regions are located, and which may demand projects and construction of 

underground works, such as highway and railway tunnels.
