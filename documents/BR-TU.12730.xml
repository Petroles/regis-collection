Título 

Adaptações biomecânicas e morfológicas na mulher durante a gravidez e pós-

parto, na execução da marcha 

Sumário  

A gravidez é uma fase especial da vida, com diversas alterações nos sistemas 

hormonais, anatómicos, e na composição corporal da mulher. No entanto, não é claro 

que alterações biomecânicas tridimensionais ocorrerem. Através do acompanhamento 

da mulher na gravidez e pós-parto, os objetivos da presente tese foram: 1) determinar 

os parâmetros temporais e espaciais do ciclo da marcha; 2) descrever a cinemática 

angular do membro inferior; 3) calcular os momentos e potências articulares do 

tornozelo, joelho e coxofemoral, utilizando o cálculo por dinâmica inversa; 4) descrever 

as magnitudes dos picos dos momentos e potências articulares dos membros 

inferiores; 5) identificar possíveis diferenças entre as fases de recolha relativamente 

aos parâmetros biomecânicos; 6) descrever longitudinalmente a composição corporal 

as alterações morfológicas; 7) analisar a influência das alterações antropométricas na 

cinética articular. Os resultados mostram que as mulheres mantêm os parâmetros 

temporais e espaciais da marcha. A cinemática angular do membro inferior tem o 

mesmo padrão, no entanto, a magnitude de alguns picos, especialmente na bacia e 

coxofemoral durante a fase terminal do apoio, pré-balanço e de balanço, apresentam 

alterações significativas. A coxofemoral é a articulação com mais alterações na 

cinética articular, com um aumento da carga interna associada aos momentos 

articulares da coxofemoral no plano transversal. No entanto, diversos momentos e 

potências articulares revelam uma diminuição significativa para o final da gravidez e/ou 

um aumento entre alguns trimestres da gravidez e o pós-parto. Como esperado, a 

maioria das variáveis associadas à composição corporal e às dimensões corporais tem 

um aumento significativo durante a gravidez e uma diminuição no pós-parto. Os 

modelos desenvolvidos para prever a carga interna aplicada ao membro inferior da 

grávida através de variáveis antropométricas, incluem quatro modelos com variáveis 

associadas à quantidade de gordura, quatro modelos com variáveis associadas à 

massa corporal global, três modelos que incluem a massa livre de gordura, e um 

modelo que inclui a forma do tronco. Os altos valores do R2 ajustado, mostram que as 

alterações na composição corporal e morfologia, determinam em grande parte a 

cinética articular da mulher nesta fase particular da vida. 

Palavras-chave: gravidez, marcha, cinemática, cinética, composição corporal.

Title 

Biomechanical and morphological adaptations in women during pregnancy and 

the postpartum period in walking 

Abstract  

Pregnancy is a special phase of women's lives, which process leads to several 

changes in hormonal, anatomical, body composition, and musculoskeletal systems of 

women. However, it is not clear what three-dimensional biomechanical changes occur 

at this stage. With the longitudinal monitoring of woman's in pregnancy and 

postpartum, the purposes of the present thesis were to: 1) determine the temporal 

parameters of the gait cycle pregnant women; 2) describe the angular kinematics of the 

lower limb of the pregnant women; 3) calculate net moments of force in ankle, knee 

and hip joints, using inverse dynamics; 4) describe peak magnitudes of the joint 

moments of force of the pregnant women; 5) to identify potential differences between 

the four collection phases on the biomechanical parameters, concerning gait cycle; 6) 

describe the body composition of women and their morphological changes; 7) Analyse 

the influence of anthropometric variables in the kinetics of joints of women. Results 

show that women maintain the same temporal and spatial parameters of gait 

throughout pregnancy and in the postpartum period. The angular kinematics of lower 

limb have the same curve pattern, however the magnitude of some peaks, especially in 

pelvis and hip joint during terminal stance, pre-swing and mid-swing phases, suffer 

significant changes. The hip is the joint with the greatest changes in joint kinetics 

during pregnancy, with an increase of the internal loading associated with the hip 

moments in the transverse plane. In the other planes of motion, joint moments and 

power shows a significant decrease to the end of pregnancy or an increase from some 

stages of pregnancy to the postpartum period. As expected, most of the variables 

associated with body composition and body dimensions showed, a significant increase 

during pregnancy and a decrease in the postpartum. The models developed to predict 

women's internal loading through anthropometric variables include, four models with 

variables associated with the amount of fat, four models that with variables related to 

overall body weight, three models that include fat-free mass, and one model that 

includes the shape of the trunk as a predictor variable. The high values of adjusted r 

square, show that changes in maternal’s body composition and morphology, largely 

determine kinetic dynamics of the female joints in this particular stage of life. 

Keywords: pregnancy, gait, kinematics, kinetics, body composition

 Rationale for the Investigation 

Pregnancy is a special phase of life, in which women suffer visible 

morphological changes in their body, and also other less visible changes in 

physiological and hormonal systems. In addition to these changes, the growth and 

development of the foetus, the uterus, all pregnancy-associated tissues, including 

placenta and foetal membranes and also the amount of liquid, contribute to an increase 

in the woman’ body weight in an average of 12 kilograms. Of these, the weight of the 

foetus may contribute to 3.5 kg, plus 2 kg corresponding to the weight of the amniotic 

fluid, placenta and foetal membranes, more 1 kg for uterine weight and 1 kg for 

woman's breasts. The remaining 4.5 kg corresponds to an increase of blood volume 

and extracellular fluid (3 kg), and an increase of body fat (1.5 kg). Much of these 

tissues are expelled during birth, and in the following days, the fluid in excess is 

excreted in the urine (Guyton &amp;amp; Hall, 2006). 

Recent evidence-based studies show that exercise is safe for both mother and 

foetus. The literature supports the recommendation to initiate or continue exercise in 

most pregnancies (Paisley, Joy, &amp;amp; Price, 2003; Parad, Leonard, &amp;amp; Handler, 2015), 

even when it comes to moderate-to-vigorous resistance exercise, since it's a healthy 

pregnancy (Petrov Fieril, Glantz, &amp;amp; Fagevik Olsen, 2015). Different modes of exercise, 

such as walking, jogging, cycling and swimming, with low and high intensity are not 

associated with increased miscarriage rates between the first trimester until the middle 

of the second trimester (Parad et al., 2015). Walking appears as one of the preferred 

modes of exercise, not only because it is an exercise that uses large muscle groups in 

a continuous and rhythmic way, but also because it is a physical activity that is easy to 

control regarding the intensity of exercise (A.C.O.G., 2003).  

The biomechanical loading assessment of gait in the musculoskeletal system of 

pregnant women is of particular interest because this information becomes very 

important to implement exercise programs for pregnant women and to develop 

strategies to increase adherence. There are many anatomical changes during 

pregnancy that could potentially lead to gait alterations, and those alterations may 

contribute to musculoskeletal overuse conditions such as back and lower limb pain 

(Foti, Davids, &amp;amp; Bagley, 2000). Nevertheless, to conduct an evaluation of the human 

motion, it is necessary to proceed with a description of the pattern, which in the case of 

the walking is well defined and described in the literature (Los Amigos Research 

Education Institute Inc et al., 2001; Perry &amp;amp; Burnfield, 2010; Rose &amp;amp; Gamble, 2006; 

Vaughan, Davis, &amp;amp; O'Connor, 1999; Whittle, 2007). It is not clear whether the temporal,

spatial, kinematic and kinetic patterns of gait during pregnancy are the same as the 

apparently healthy adult population, if the changes that happen in this period are due to 

pregnancy, or due to the normal processes that take place over time in a perspective of 

lifespan development. 

In the last decades, few studies have analysed the mechanics of walking in the 

body of the woman from the beginning of pregnancy (Falola, Gouthon, Koussihouede, 

Agossa, &amp;amp; Brisswalter, 2009; W. L. Gilleard, 2013; Hagan &amp;amp; Wong, 2010; Huang, Lin, 

Ho, Yu, &amp;amp; Chou, 2002). These studies have reported few changes to the temporal, 

spatial, kinematic and kinetic pattern of walking gait, but are not mentioned the inherent 

calibration errors of the systems they use, and only some of them use the last 

technology devices to accomplish these assessments. Thus, it becomes essential a 

detailed quantitative analysis of the movement data, attempting to access the women 

from the beginning of pregnancy. It is necessary to take into account, however, the 

great privacy that women give to their condition during at least the first trimester, 

usually because many spontaneous miscarriages happen during this period, which can 

be a major barrier to getting women for the sample of the first trimester. Another aspect 

that must be considered is the longitudinal follow-up of the women throughout 

pregnancy, to the detriment of analysis by cohorts with a cross-sectional design. In 

order to detect changes that are due to the course of pregnancy, should be 

implemented an experimental design of longitudinal and prospective type. This type of 

experimental design aims to collect data from the same subjects at more than one 

point over the forward passage of time (Bowling, 2002). To this end we intend to 

perform a biomechanical evaluation, which is considered a powerful way of observation 

at the highest level of evaluation, where it possible to compare in detail (Winter, 2005), 

the changes that are due to the pregnancy. 

 General Research Questions 

Since there is some diversity in the results and only a minority of studies 

considers early pregnancy, the questions that arise were the following: 

1. Are there any changes in temporal and spatial parameters, and in the 

kinematics of the pregnant woman gait, especially in the joints kinematics of the 

lower limb? 

2. Are there any changes in kinetic parameters of the pregnant woman gait, 

especially in the joints kinetics of the lower limb?

3. Are morphological and body composition changes of women happening 

consistently since the beginning of pregnancy? 

4. Are there any effects of the morphology on the kinetic parameters during 

pregnancy and postpartum?  

 Purposes of the Thesis 

In order to better understand the biomechanics of woman's gait during 

pregnancy and in the postpartum period, the purposes of the present thesis were to: 

1. Determine the temporal parameters of the gait cycle; 

2. Describe the angular kinematics of the lower limbs;  

3. Calculate net moments of force in ankle, knee and hip joints, using inverse 

dynamics; 

4. Describe peak magnitudes of the joint moments and joint powers; 

5. Identify potential differences between the four collection phases - first, second 

and third trimesters of pregnancy and postpartum period - on the biomechanical 

parameters, concerning gait cycle; 

6. Describe the body composition of women and their morphological changes 

throughout pregnancy and postpartum; 

7. Analyze the influence of anthropometric variables in the kinetics of lower limb 

joints. 

 Thesis Overview 

Following the present introduction (chapter 1), this thesis embraces a 

compilation of four papers, as follows.  

The aim of the first study (chapter 2) was to analyze the available evidence on 

the biomechanical adaptations of gait that occur throughout pregnancy and in 

postpartum, specifically with regard to the temporal, spatial, kinematic and kinetic 

parameters of gait. The paper is published at:

Article ID 527940, 5 pages. http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/527940 

The aim of the second study (chapter 3) was to quantify and verify the kinematic 

changes of gait as pregnancy progresses. If the changes were confirmed, the second 

objective was to ascertain whether women could recover the initial kinematic patterns

in the postpartum period. In terms of the main objective, it is necessary to describe the 

kinematic variables in the joints of the lower limb during gait at the end of the first, 

second and third trimesters of pregnancy and in the postpartum period. The paper is

and Biomechanics. (in press) 

The aim of the third study (chapter 4) was to assess the gait kinetics, in order to 

check if there are any changes in the dynamics of the load of women throughout 

pregnancy and after delivery. To achieve the main objective, it was necessary to 

describe and quantify the kinetic variables relating to the GRF, joint moments of force, 

and joint power of ankle, knee and hip, during gait, at the end of the first, second and 

third trimesters of pregnancy and in the postpartum period. The paper is published at:

Postpartum. Scientifica, 2015, 14. doi: 10.1155/2015/580374. 

The aim of the fourth study (chapter 5) was to quantify the maternal 

anthropometric and body composition changes throughout pregnancy and in the 

postpartum period, and identify what is the contribution of these parameters on the 

lower limb joints kinetic during walking gait. The paper was submitted to:

Finally, in chapter 6, a general discussion, the main conclusions of the thesis 

and the recommendations for practice are presented, as well as few recommendations 

for future research.

 Methodological Considerations 

Regarding the means and methods used in the present work, several 

methodological definitions are possible to use. However, considering the different 

publications, the methods used to build the biomechanical model of the woman's lower 

limbs throughout pregnancy and in the postpartum period, was based on the definitions 

recommended by Robertson, Caldwell, Hamill, Kamen, and Whittlesey (2014). For the 

construction of the Cartesian system for three-dimensional collections the definitions 

established by Hamill, Selbie, and Kepple (2014), were considered in what concerns to  

a setup with at least ten high-speed infrared cameras (Oqus-300, Qualisys, Sweden; 

FR: 500 Hz) positioned statically to minimize light reflection artefacts, and three force 

platforms (two Kistler AG, Winterthur, Switzerland, and one Advanced Mechanical 

Technology, Inc., Watertown, U.S.A.; FR: 1000 Hz) in order to collect at least two 

consecutive contacts of the feet on the ground. The three-dimensional space was 

calibrated by wand type, with an exact wand length of 751.4 mm moved randomly 

across the recorded field before the data collection of each participant. Calibration was 

accepted if the standard deviation of the wand length measures was below 0.5 mm. 

The marker setup follows the recommendation of Cappozzo, Cappello, DellaCroce, 

and Pensalfini (1997) for lower limb segments, and CODA (Charnwood Dynamics Ltd, 



Chapter 1 - Introduction

Leicestershire, United Kingdom) protocols for models of the pelvis segment. The 

explanation of the setup marks, to define each segment can be found in Chapters 3 

and 4. 

Due to major changes in the pelvic and abdominal volume of the pregnant 

woman, some care has been taken in the construction segment of the pelvis, not only 

in the placement of markers (point 1), but also in the selection of the regression 

equations used to compute the joint center of the hip (point 2). Thus, for the first point, 

to ensure the correct placement of the reflective markers throughout pregnancy, a 

comparison of the length of each segment (whose size is defined by the markers 

placed in proximal and distal extremities) was performed, in particular the right and left 

segments of the shank and the feet. After this comparison, no differences were found 

in the size of the segments of shank (F(3,30)=0.049, p=0.985 and F(3,30)=0.580, 

p=0.633, respectively for right and left shank) and of the feet (F(3,30)=0.372, p=0.774 

and F(3,30)=0.190, p=0.902, respectively for right and left foot).  

In the second point, for the estimation of hip joint center after the construction of 

the pelvis model, the equations developed by Bell and colleagues (Bell, Brand, &amp;amp; 

Pedersen, 1989; Bell, Pedersen, &amp;amp; Brand, 1990), by Harrington, Zavatsky, Lawson, 

Yuan, and Theologis (2007) and by Davis, Ounpuu, Tyburski, and Gage (1991) were 

considered. Although there are no specific equations to compute the hip joint center of 

the pregnant woman, our choice falls on the equations of Bell and colleagues (Bell et 

al., 1989; Bell et al., 1990), for being frequently used and so there are the same basis 

for comparing the results found with the existing publications. 

In the construction of the model global optimization algorithms were considered, 

originally proposed by Lu and O'Connor (1999), where it is assumed that the model 

consists of rigid bodies connected by joints, and where the optimized position is one 

whose multilink model minimizes difference between the measurement and the model 

given by the coordinates of the markers. These algorithms were then mathematically 

improved by van den Bogert and Su (2008), which considers a minimum markers for 

describing the position of the segments. In the present study we also use the 

Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm in order to make the more efficient calculation of 

common minimization algorithms (Levenberg, 1944; Marquardt, 1963). In this global 

optimization is considered a hierarchy between segments, and in this case the 

construction of the model and respective kinematic calculations are performed from 

proximal to distal segments. In order to reduce errors of the model it is possible to 

define constraints (limit some degrees of freedom) of every joint, which are presented 

in Table 1.

For the calculations of the angles between segments, the Cardan-Euler system 

was used, for having provided an optimal representation of the joint angles of the lower 

extremities (Hamill et al., 2014), with a sequence of rotation XYZ.  

Given that in the calculation of the joint angles, the matrix of rotation considers 

the coordinate system of the proximal segment, which allows making an angle 

normalization, where the "zero" position corresponds to the standing posture, taken in 

the standing trial with all anatomical markers. This procedure allows standardizing the 

analysis of the participants over time and guarantees uniformity across participants. 

The determination of the kinetic variables of the joint moments and joint powers 

was performed by means of inverse dynamics analysis. Therefore three kinds of data 

are needed. In first place, the anthropometric data, specifically: the location of the 

coordinate system of each segment in its proximal joint center; the segment mass; its 

center of mass; and also, its moment of inertia. The determination of the mass of the 

segments was based on regression equations by Dempster (1955). To calculate the 

center of mass and moment of inertia of the segments, its primitive geometric shape 

was considered (Hanavan, 1964), set by the segment length, the proximal radius and 

distal radius of the segment, calculated by V3D software based on the location of the 

markers. The kinematic calculations are the second kind of data needed for each 

segment, in order to provide the center of gravity position, translational velocity, 

translational acceleration, angular velocity, and angular acceleration, which in this 

work, were also computed  in V3D. Finally, the third kind of data were the external 

forces, which were collected by three force platforms (two Kistler force platforms and 

one AMTI) in order to achieve contact forces of the feet during two consecutive gait 

cycles. All steps for calculating by means of inverse dynamics method are described in 

Robertson et al. (2014) and in C-Motion (2015) website.

 Abstract 

During pregnancy women experience several changes in the body's physiology, 

morphology and hormonal system. These changes may affect the balance and body 

stability and can cause discomfort and pain. The adaptations of the musculoskeletal 

system due to morphological changes during pregnancy are not fully understood. Few 

studies clarify the biomechanical changes of gait that occur during pregnancy and in 

postpartum. The purpose of this review was to analyse the available evidence on the 

biomechanical adaptations of gait that occur throughout pregnancy and in postpartum, 

specifically with regard to the temporal, spatial, kinematic and kinetic parameters of 

gait. Three databases were searched and 9 studies with a follow-up design were 

retrieved for analysis. Most studies performed a temporal, spatial and kinematic 

analysis. Only three studies performed a kinetic analysis. The adaptation strategies to 

the anatomical and physiological changes throughout pregnancy are still unclear, 

particularly in a longitudinal perspective and regarding kinetic parameters.

 Introduction 

Pregnancy is a unique time in the life of women with many changes that affect 

the musculoskeletal system (Artal &amp;amp; O'Toole, 2003). Over 38 to 42 weeks, women 

experience several changes in the body's physiology, morphology and hormonal 

system. These changes are visible especially in increased weight and skeletal 

alignment. Other less visible changes are the increased joint laxity, and change in the 

centre of gravity. Altogether, these changes affect the balance and body stability and 

can cause discomfort and pain (Butler, Druzin, &amp;amp; Sullivan, 2006). The displacement of 

the centre of gravity has been discussed over the years with different statements. 

Some studies indicate that the centre of gravity (CG) moves upper and anteriorly (e.g., 

Foti et al., 2000; Rodacki, Fowler, Rodacki, &amp;amp; Birch, 2003). Other studies state that the 

CG shifts on the upper and posterior direction (e.g., Fries &amp;amp; Hellebrandt, 1943). 

Whitcome, Shapiro, and Lieberman (2007), evaluated the evolution of lumbar lordosis 

in bipedal hominids, and the results elucidate that the CG moves anteriorly until the 

foetus reaches 40% of the expected final weight. From that moment, the woman 

increases the lordotic adjustment which in turn enables the control of the CG, but with 

greater biomechanical costs (Foti et al., 2000). 

Hormonal changes in women are quite variable throughout pregnancy. 

However, the hormone relaxin may have a more decisive role in the mechanics of 

movement, as it provides greater ligament laxity in the pelvis and on the peripheral 

joints (Butler et al., 2006; Calguneri, Bird, &amp;amp; Wright, 1982; Schauberger et al., 1996). 

The concentration peak of relaxin occurs around the 12th week of gestation, which 

means that there is enough time to act on osteoarticular structures until the end of 

pregnancy. 

One of the aspects that most influences the musculoskeletal system is the 

increase in maternal weight. When weight is in excess it may cause several adverse 

maternal effects, including gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, difficulties 

during labour, weight retention in postpartum, and subsequent maternal obesity with 

the risk for unsuccessful breastfeeding (Institute of Medicine and National Research 

Council of the National Academies, 2009). The ideal weight gain during pregnancy is 

related to the women's weight or body mass index (BMI) before pregnancy. The weight 

gain may range between 12.5 Kg and 18 Kg for women under weight (BMI &amp;lt;18.5); 

between 11.5 Kg and 16 Kg for women with normal weight (18.5 ? BMI &amp;lt;25); between

the National Academies, 2009). The weight gain during pregnancy is related to several 

factors, such as, the amount of blood, the increased volume of the breasts, the 

increased fat mass and extracellular fluid (Whitcome et al., 2007). The foetal tissues, 

the placenta and the amniotic fluid are related to the weight gain of the foetus (Institute 

of Medicine and National Research Council of the National Academies, 2009). 

A strategy to control weight gain during pregnancy is by performing structured 

or recreational physical activity. The guidelines for exercise prescription of the 

American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend aerobic exercise 

consisting of activities that use large muscle groups in a continuous, rhythmic manner 

(Artal &amp;amp; O'Toole, 2003). Walking emerges as a highly recommended physical activity 

for pregnant women. Walking is one of the movements most commonly performed by 

people in the day-to-day tasks and it is easy to control exercise intensity.  

When performing motor tasks such as walking, the adaptations of the 

musculoskeletal system due to morphological changes during pregnancy are not fully 

known. Few studies clarify the biomechanical changes of gait that occur during 

pregnancy and in postpartum.  

 

 Aim of the review  

The purpose of this review was to analyse the available evidence on the 

biomechanical adaptations of gait that occur throughout pregnancy and in postpartum, 

specifically with regard to the temporal, spatial, kinematic and kinetic parameters of 

gait.  

 

 Methods 

 Eligibility criteria 

The review was limited to studies meeting the following eligibility criteria: 1) 

healthy pregnant women with no history of foot, ankle, knee, musculoskeletal or 

neuromuscular trauma or disease; 2) women aged between 20 and 40 years; 3) 

studies performed in the last 14 years; 4) studies performed by means of optoelectronic 

systems, image analysis, force platforms and others; 5) outcome measures related to 

biomechanical variables of gait including, spatial (stride length, step length and stride 

width), temporal (single and double support time), kinematic (velocity and cadence),

and kinetic (ground reaction forces, joint moment and joint power) parameters; 6) study 

design including cross-sectional, follow-up, quasi-experimental trials and randomized 

controlled trials. 

 Information source 

The studies were identified by searching three databases - ScienceDirect, 

PubMed and SciELO – from January 2000 to August 2014. In addition, reference lists 

of identified studies were also scanned. Studies published in English, Portuguese, 

Spanish or French were scanned. Only published full papers were included. 

Unpublished data, books, conference proceedings or academic theses were not 

included. 

 Search strategy and study selection 

 The search was performed using the following keywords in English: 1) gait / 

walking; 2) pregnancy / pregnant; and 3) biomechanics / kinetics / kinematics. These 

keywords were in first place identified in the titles and in the abstracts. The study 

selection was conducted in two stages. The first stage was the screening of the titles 

and abstracts against the inclusion criteria to identify relevant papers. The second 

stage was the screening of the full papers to identify whether they met the eligibility 

criteria. 

 Data collection process and analysis 

After screening each paper, the following data were extracted: 1) study design; 

2) sample size; 3) age of the women; 4) gestational phase of data collection; 5) 

outcome variables: spatial variables; temporal variables; kinematic variables; kinetic 

variables; 6) biomechanical instruments. The studies were therefore described 

according to these characteristics and outcome measures. 

 Results 

 Study selection and characteristics 

The search yielded 741 articles from the three databases. ScienceDirect (711), 

PubMed (28) and SciELO (2). After removing duplicate articles 21 articles were 

considered for analysis. Articles were then screened on the basis of title and abstract, 

with 16 excluded. After searching the reference lists of the selected articles, 4 more

16 

articles were included. The remaining 9 full papers were examined in detail and found 

to meet the inclusion criteria, and then, included in the review.  

The characteristics of the studies included in the review are presented in Table 

2. All studies have follow-up design. The sample sizes across the studies ranged from 

29 to 1247. All studies reported the mean age and standard deviation, except one 

(Lymbery &amp;amp; Gilleard, 2005). Different studies used video-based systems for kinematic 

analysis, except for two studies that use optoelectronic systems (Branco, Santos-

Rocha, Aguiar, Vieira, &amp;amp; Veloso, 2013; Forczek &amp;amp; Staszkiewicz, 2012), and one that 

only uses pedometers (Falola et al., 2009) to analyse the temporal and spatial 

parameters. Only three studies report a kinetic analysis (Forczek &amp;amp; Staszkiewicz, 2012; 

Hagan &amp;amp; Wong, 2010; Lymbery &amp;amp; Gilleard, 2005) and most studies provide an analysis 

of the kinematic, spatial and temporal parameters.

 Outcome measures: spatial and temporal parameters 

The variables of stride length, step length, stride width and base of support, 

single and double support time are the spatial and temporal parameters analysed by 

the papers reviewed. Most papers reviewed showed changes in spatial and temporal 

parameters in late pregnancy, specifically, a significant decrease in the length of the 

gait cycle (Branco et al., 2013; Carpes, Griebeler, Kleinpaul, Mann, &amp;amp; Mota, 2008; W. 

L. Gilleard, 2013; Hagan &amp;amp; Wong, 2010), and in step length (Branco et al., 2013; 

Carpes et al., 2008; Forczek &amp;amp; Staszkiewicz, 2012; Hagan &amp;amp; Wong, 2010), and a 

significant increase in the double support time (Branco et al., 2013; Carpes et al., 2008; 

Foti et al., 2000). Other studies showed a significant reduction in the single support 

time (Carpes et al., 2008; Foti et al., 2000), and a significant increase in step width (W. 

L. Gilleard, 2013; Lymbery &amp;amp; Gilleard, 2005). Forczek and Staszkiewicz (2012) also 

found a significant increase in the base of support. Nevertheless, the remaining studies 

suggest that pregnant women have the need to increase the body stability, and use the 

parameters listed above to meet those demands. 

 Outcome measures: joint kinematics 

The variables of velocity (or speed) and cadence are the kinematic parameters 

analysed by the studies included in the review. Most papers reviewed showed changes 

in kinematic parameters in late pregnancy, specifically, a significant decrease in speed 

(Falola et al., 2009; Forczek &amp;amp; Staszkiewicz, 2012; Hagan &amp;amp; Wong, 2010) and a 

significant reduction in the gait cadence (Falola et al., 2009; Forczek &amp;amp; Staszkiewicz, 

2012). 

The joint kinematics of the lower limb, shows few changes throughout 

pregnancy. The angular displacement of the pelvis increases in the anterior tilt of 

approximately five degrees (Foti et al., 2000; Hagan &amp;amp; Wong, 2010). The joints of the 

lower limb in the sagittal plane shows an increase in hip flexion during stance phase 

(Branco et al., 2013; Foti et al., 2000; Hagan &amp;amp; Wong, 2010), an increase of knee 

flexion during the terminal stance phase (Carpes et al., 2008), a decrease of knee 

extension (Branco et al., 2013), and a decrease of ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion 

(Branco et al., 2013; Hagan &amp;amp; Wong, 2010). In the frontal plane, W. L. Gilleard (2013) 

found a reduction in the amplitude of the unilateral elevation of the pelvis. The hip joint 

had different results considering the two studies performed: Foti et al. (2000) found a 

peak with greater magnitude in the hip adduction; Branco et al. (2013) found a 

decrease of this peak.

 Outcome measures: joint kinetics 

Few studies have evaluated the kinetic parameters of gait during pregnancy. 

Foti et al. (2000) analysed the joint moments and joint powers with and without 

normalizing the weight of the women in late pregnancy. Although they found several 

changes in these parameters without normalization, the authors recommend the 

analysis with normalization (Foti et al., 2000). The analyses performed with normalized 

data found a significant increase in the hip extensors moment (Huang et al., 2002), and 

a significant decrease in the knee extensors moment (Huang et al., 2002) and in the 

ankle plantarflexors moment (Foti et al., 2000; Huang et al., 2002) in the sagittal plane. 

In the frontal plane, there was an increase of the hip abductors moment (Foti et al., 

2000) and in the knee adductors moment (Huang et al., 2002). 

 Discussion 

The purpose of this review was to analyse the available evidence on the 

biomechanical adaptations of gait that occur throughout pregnancy and in postpartum. 

Data from 9 follow-up studies were included in the analysis.  

Women are subjected to various anatomical and physiological changes 

throughout pregnancy. However the adaptation strategies that are pursued are still 

unclear (Forczek &amp;amp; Staszkiewicz, 2012). Two of the situations they face are, on the one 

hand the reduction of energy costs associated with gait and, on the other hand, 

maximizing safety during the motor task. The later strategy seems to be dominant 

because the increase in step width is associated with a greater energy cost while 

walking (Donelan, Kram, &amp;amp; Kuo, 2001). This parameter has great consistency between 

studies. In addition, the development of pregnancy is associated with a reduction in 

stride length, which together allow the woman to have a larger base of support 

(Forczek &amp;amp; Staszkiewicz, 2012). Other way found by pregnant women to ensure 

greater body stability is keeping their feet on the ground for a longer time during the 

gait cycle and decreasing the single support time, which seems to be also a strategy to 

support the increased weight (Foti et al., 2000). In fact, the medial-lateral instability of 

the women as the pregnancy progresses is one result that seems to have great 

importance among different types of biomechanical parameters. However so far the 

medial-lateral component of the ground reaction forces show no significant changes, 

but tend to be higher in late pregnancy (Lymbery &amp;amp; Gilleard, 2005). This observation 

requires further research.

Much of the biomechanical changes occur in the pelvis or in adjacent joints. 

Although there are few kinematic changes in late pregnancy, most of it are related to 

the angular motion of the pelvis and the hip joint. The result with greater emphasis on 

studies is the anterior tilt of the pelvis. The position taken by the pelvis in late 

pregnancy seems to be a consequence of the weight of the uterus, placenta and foetus 

placed in the anterior zone of the body, and the weaker capacity to produce force by 

the rectus abdominis. However, the function of this anterior tilt and the increase of the 

lumbar lordosis is related to the maintenance of the trunk in an upright position (Foti et 

al., 2000). The decrease in the range of motion of the pelvis in the frontal and 

transverse planes, suggests that this may be a way to control the angular momentum 

caused by the increase of the moment of inertia of the trunk in late pregnancy (W. L. 

Gilleard, 2013). These changes bring consequences for the muscles attached to the 

pelvis, particularly a greater participation of the abductors and extensors muscles of the 

hip, which combined with a higher stretch derived from the anterior tilt of the pelvis, will 

contribute to lower back, pelvis, hip and sacroiliac pain (Foti et al., 2000; Huang et al., 

2002). These types of pain are also associated with a decrease in the participation of 

the knee extensors and ankle plantarflexors (Huang et al., 2002). The changes in 

angular motion of the ankle may also be associated with other issues of pregnant 

women, including a decrease of dorsiflexion that is related to pain and higher 

probability to trip and fall (Hagan &amp;amp; Wong, 2010). 

 Limitations 

The strength of this review is that a systematic methodology was adopted to 

identify relevant studies on the biomechanics of gait during pregnancy. However, the 

review has some limitations. Articles published in other languages than those 

mentioned above may have been excluded. The search was performed only in peer-

reviewed published articles since 2000. There is a possibility of missing data published 

previously or other unpublished data, which were not included in the analysis. The 

small sample sizes and the different periods of data collection may have introduced 

some bias in the analysis performed. The lack of studies on this subject as well as the 

consistency of the outcome measures is a major limitation to perform a meta-analysis. 

Cautions should be taken when drawings conclusions about gait adaptations 

throughout pregnancy, due to the limitations mentioned above.

 Conclusions 

The evidence from this review suggests biomechanical adaptations of gait 

throughout pregnancy. Further research is required using common outcome measures 

and standard follow-up periods of data collection (weeks of gestation and postpartum 

period). Most of the results presented in this review are consistent between studies. 

However there is a great scarcity of studies addressing the gait biomechanics of 

pregnant women in a longitudinal perspective. There is a need to examine the 

kinematics of the woman closely while walking considering the beginning of pregnancy, 

in order to confirm the influence of morphological changes in the angular motion of the 

lower limb segments during the course of pregnancy.  

Very few studies analysed the kinetics of gait of pregnant women. Nevertheless, 

these data are seen as essential to understand the magnitude and implications of 

changes in the welfare of women. In future research, there must be a special focus on 

the analysis of moments and joint powers to understand the changes in muscle 

participation, and if there are changes in the type of contraction during motor tasks. 

It is not possible to understand the influence of morphological changes, if body 

composition and anthropometric variables are not quantified throughout pregnancy. 

Further research is required to understand to which extent these variables influence the 

biomechanical parameters. 

No studies were found addressing the effects of physical activity, low back and 

pelvic pain or maternal weight control on the gait biomechanical adaptations of gait 

throughout pregnancy and postpartum.

 Abstract 

The kinematic analysis of gait during pregnancy provides more detailed 

information about anatomical changes and aids exercise and rehabilitation prescription. 

The aim of the study was to describe and quantify the spatial, temporal and kinematic 

parameters in the joints of the lower limb during gait at the end of the first, second and 

third trimesters of pregnancy and in the postpartum period. A three-dimensional 

analysis was performed in 11 pregnant women. Repeated measures were performed 

for comparisons between periods. The longitudinal effect of pregnancy was not 

observed in spatial and temporal parameters, but trends such as stride width during 

pregnancy and postpartum were observed. In joint kinematics the effect of pregnancy 

was observed in all joints for the three planes of motion. The hip joint and the segment 

of the pelvis are structures with more changes, and the results suggest an increase in 

the anterior tilt of the pelvis as pregnancy progresses, a decrease of the amplitude of 

the hip joint, and that pregnant women need to maintain their body stability to become 

more efficient in terms of locomotion. Generally, the results confirm retrieval of the 

values from the beginning of pregnancy, indicating that the body self-organizes in order 

to overcome the morphological and physiological changes which women suffer during 

pregnancy, that women have the ability to adapt to such demands, and that when the 

effect of pregnancy subsides they retrieve values similar to those found in early 

pregnancy.

 Introduction 

Pregnant women undergo various changes during pregnancy, including 

hormonal and morphological changes (A.C.O.G., 2010). Although, these changes may 

lead to many complaints, discomfort and pain in lower limbs, it is unclear whether the 

biological, hormonal and morphological changes lead to the modification of gait pattern. 

Few studies describe the temporal, spatial and kinematic motion on the lower limb of 

the pregnant women, particularly in a longitudinal perspective. 

Foti et al. (2000) analysed a set of gait three-dimensional (3D) kinematic 

parameter in 15 women, from the 3th trimester of pregnancy until one year postpartum. 

The overall results showed changes in the gait pattern of those women, comparing with 

a non-pregnant group. In the pregnant group gait pattern the amplitude of hip extension 

is decreased while the anterior pelvic tilt, hip flexion and hip adduction are increased. 

Regarding temporal parameters significant increases were found in double support 

time and significant decreases in single support time. In spatial parameters they found 

a significant increase in pelvic width and ankle separation. Lymbery and Gilleard (2005) 

investigated the temporospatial and ground reaction forces (GRF) variables in the 

stance phase of walking in 13 women at 38 weeks’ gestation and 8 weeks after birth. 

They concluded that in late pregnancy, there was a wider step width, and mediolateral 

GRF is increasing in a medial direction. They suggested that women may adapt their 

gait to maximize stability in the stance phase of walking and to control mediolateral 

motion. Huang et al. (2002) compared the natural pattern of walking, tested once, in 10 

pregnant women, divided into three groups (12, 13-28 and 29-40 weeks of gestation) 

with of control group of 10 nulliparous. They reported significant differences between 

the pregnant and non-pregnant women, especially in knee abduction angle, knee and 

hip internal rotation angles. Also, as gestational age progress, the pregnant women 

showed increased in hip extension moment and knee adduction moment, and 

decreased in knee extension moment, and ankle plantar flexion moment. According to 

these authors the hip is the main work-loading area, associated with an over stretch of 

the hip extensors, which are highly related to sacroiliac pain, caused by an easily 

fatigue of these muscles. 

Few studies analysed gait kinematic changes throughout pregnancy, in each 

trimester of gestation, or associated the kinematic and kinetic variables for each phase 

of the gait cycle. In a previous study Branco et al. (2013) found that the gait pattern of 

pregnant women showed changes between second and third trimesters in such a way 

that the stride and right and left step lengths decreased, while double limb support time

26 

increased. Joint kinematics showed a significant decrease of right-hip extension and 

adduction during stance phase between trimesters. Also, an increase in left knee 

flexion and a decrease in right-ankle plantarflexion were found between trimesters. 

No studies were found performing a longitudinal analysis encompassing the 

three trimesters of pregnancy and the postpartum period, so that the changes that are 

arising from pregnancy are not fully quantified. These leads us to wonder whether there 

are changes in kinematic parameters during pregnancy, and if so, are women able to 

recover to values close to those found in early pregnancy? 

 Objectives  

The main objective of this study was to analyse the kinematic changes of gait 

as the pregnancy progresses. If these changes were confirmed, the second objective 

was to ascertain whether women can recover to the initial kinematic patterns in the 

postpartum period. The hypothesis tested is that the gait of pregnant women has 

changes in the kinematic parameters throughout their pregnancy, and women in 

postpartum period recover these parameters to values similar to those of early 

pregnancy. To achieve the main objective, it is necessary to describe the kinematic 

variables in the joints of the lower limb during gait at the end of the first, second and 

third trimesters of pregnancy and in the postpartum period. 

 

 Materials and Methods 

 Subjects 

Eleven pregnant women (age: 33.20 ± 1.62 years; range: 32 to 37 years) with 

no trauma or disease history regarding foot, ankle, knee, musculoskeletal, and 

neuromuscular tissue participated in this study. The characteristics of the participants 

are described in Table 3.

had contraindications for physical exercise. The study was approved by the ethical 

committee of the Faculty of Human Kinetics, University of Lisbon (FMH-UL) and all 

subjects gave written informed consent prior to their participation in the study. 

 

 Data Collection and Processing 

Data were collected at the Laboratory of Biomechanics and Functional 

Morphology (FMH-UL) during the later stages of each trimester of pregnancy and once 

in the postpartum period. In each data collection session anthropometric and 

biomechanical data were recorded. Weight and height were measured  according to 

the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK) 

standardized measurement protocol (Stewart, Marfell-Jones, Olds, &amp;amp; de Ridder, 2011) 

by ISAK certified anthropometrists. These anthropometric data were used to calculate 

the body segment mass and inertia moments.  

The biomechanical data were recorded while the subject walked barefoot a 

distance of 10 m, between two points, in a straight line in both directions at a natural 

and comfortable speed for 3 min. The floor had no specific patterns or irregularities, 

and the participants had no knowledge of the location of the force platforms, which 

were placed in the middle of the defined distance. Participants were allowed to become 

familiar with the laboratory system and no fatigue occurrence was reported. The last 

four gait cycles performed by each participant were considered for the analysis. 

The marker set-up follows the recommendation of Cappozzo et al. (1997) for 

lower limb segments and CODA (Charnwood Dynamics Ltd, Leicestershire, United 

Kingdom) protocols for models of the pelvis segment. In the static trial for the foot 

model, reflective spherical markers were placed on the fifth metatarsal head, the first 

metatarsal head, the posterior proximal top of the calcaneus, the posterior distal top of 

the calcaneus, and the lateral top of the calcaneus. For shank model construction, 

markers were placed on the lateral malleolus, medial malleolus, lateral femoral 

epicondyle, and medial femoral epicondyle and a cluster with three markers was 

placed in the lateral of the shank. For the thigh model construction, markers were 

placed on the lateral femoral epicondyle, and medial femoral epicondyle and a cluster 

with three markers was placed in the lateral of the thigh (Figure 1). To define the CODA 

pelvis model, markers were placed in both the anterior superior iliac spine and the 

posterior superior iliac spine. The pelvis model allowed the estimation of the right and 

left hip joint centre with the regression equation proposed by Bell and colleagues (Bell 

et al., 1989; Bell et al., 1990). For the dynamic trials, at least three markers were left in

each segment as reference to static marker set-up, in order to allow segment 

reconstruction. The angular displacement of the hip, knee and ankle joint was 

calculated with Visual 3D (V3D) software (C-Motion Inc., Germantown, USA) through 

the application of the Euler method. 

 

Figure 1. Reconstructed biomechanical model in Visual 3D with marker setup used for motion captures. Anterior and 
lateral view of the model. 

Kinematic and kinetic data were collected by means of 12 infrared high-speed 

cameras (Oqus-300, Qualisys, Sweden; FR: 500 Hz), two Kistler force platforms 

(Kistler AG, Winterthur, Switzerland) and one AMTI platform (Advanced Mechanical 

Technology, Inc., Watertown, U.S.A.), at a rate of 1000 Hz. The capture hardware was 

connected to a Qualisys USB Analog Acquisition interface in order to synchronize 

kinetic and kinematic data with software Qualisys Track Manager (QTM; Qualisys AB, 

Gothenburg, Sweden). Both data sequences were recorded in the same file. The 

system was calibrated by wand type, with an exact wand length of 751.4 mm moved 

randomly across the recorded field before the data collection of each participant. 

Calibration was accepted if the standard deviation of the wand length measures was 

below 0.5 mm. The cameras were positioned statically to minimize light reflection 

artefacts and to allow recording of at least two consecutive walking cycles, defined as 

the time between two consecutive initial ground contacts of the heel strike for each 

side.  

A three-dimensional analysis was performed which included both sides of the 

body. The trajectory of the reflective markers was smoothed with a Butterworth low-

pass filter with a 10 Hz cut-off. Collected data were interpolated by means of cubic 

spline interpolation as suggested by Robertson et al. (2014), for a maximum 10-frame 

gap, and filtered with a Butterworth digital low-pass filter, at 10 Hz cut-off frequency for 



Chapter 3 – 3D kinematic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum 

 

 
29 

 

kinematic and kinetic data, as suggested by Robertson and Dowling (2003). All data 

were normalized in time. 

Considering the four phases in the analysis, kinematic pattern curves were 

estimated relative to the walking stride cycle. The gait cycles were based on GRF data 

for both feet and the heel marker pattern recognition followed by correction when 

needed. The data curves and the peak angles values were estimated, for left and right 

sides, with Visual 3D software (V3D). Lower-extremity joint angles and spatial and 

temporal parameters during the walking gait cycle were calculated with the use of V3D. 

In the three periods of pregnancy and in the postpartum, the following variables 

were analysed in the sagittal plane:  

? the pelvic tilt, defined by two peaks representing the maximum anterior 

tilt occurring at the terminal stance phase and the minimum anterior tilt 

which occurred at the mid-swing phase;  

? in the hip joint two peaks were considered, the first representing the 

maximum hip extension which occurs in the toe-off event, and the 

second some moments before heel strike and representing the 

maximum hip flexion;  

? in the knee joint four peaks were considered, the first after the heel 

strike and representing a slight flexion to absorb the contact with the 

floor; the second representing the slight knee extension near the late 

mid-stance phase; the third peak occurred in the mid-swing phase as 

the maximum knee flexion; and the fourth peak represented the 

maximum extension of the knee, and occurred immediately before heel 

strike;  

? in the ankle joint four peaks were considered, the first immediately after 

heel strike with a sudden decrease of dorsiflexion of the foot; the second 

peak occurred approximately at contralateral heel strike; the third peak 

indicated the maximum plantar flexion at toe-off event with a decrease of 

plantar flexion; and the fourth peak occurred in mid-swing phase, and 

represented the maximum dorsiflexion of the foot in preparation for 

contact with the ground. 

The following variables were analysed in the frontal plane:  

? in the hip joint two peaks were considered, the first in the mid-stance 

phase representing the maximum value of hip adduction; and the 



Chapter 3 – 3D kinematic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum 

 

 
30 

second after the toe-off event and representing the maximum value of 

hip abduction; 

? in the ankle joint four peaks were considered, the first in mid-stance in 

the maximum ankle eversion phase; the second represented the 

maximum value of ankle inversion during toe-off event; the third 

occurred in the mid-swing phase close to the neutral position; and the 

fourth peak occurred immediately at the end of the swing phase in 

inversion.  

The following variables were analysed in the transverse plane:  

? in the hip joint two peaks were considered, the first representing the 

maximum value of internal rotation and occurring immediately before the 

toe-off event; the second peak represented the maximum value of 

external rotation and it occurred in a late swing phase; 

? in the ankle joint two peaks were considered, the first at the beginning of 

the mid-stance phase, and the second in the mid-swing phase. 

The following spatial and temporal variables were analysed: speed, cycle time, 

right and left step time, double limb support time, right and left stance time, right and 

left swing time, right and left step length, stride length and stride width.  

 Statistical Analysis 

All statistical procedures were conducted with IBM SPSS Statistics 22 software 

for Windows. Shapiro-Wilk normality tests were conducted and not assumed for all 

cases. The Mauchly’s test of sphericity was performed before repeated measures 

ANOVA analysis and sphericity was not assumed in all tests. For post hoc tests, 

Bonferroni test based on Student's t statistic was used, and the observed significance 

level was adjusted to take multiple comparisons into account. When the data set does 

not fulfil the assumptions for the RM analysis, the Friedman test was performed, and 

for pairwise analysis the Wilcoxon test was performed. In this case, Bonferroni 

confidence interval adjustment was applied to allow an adjustment to the confidence 

intervals and significance values for multiple comparisons.

parameters showed a slight increase during pregnancy, particularly for double support 

time, left step time, single support time, and the left swing phase. In the spatial 

parameters only the step width showed a minor increase of 0.7 cm from the first to the 

second trimester and the second to the third trimester.   

 

 Joint Kinematics 

 Sagittal Plane 

A longitudinal effect of pregnancy was observed in joint kinematics, in the 

sagittal plane, namely for the angular data of all lower limb joints (Figure 2).

Descriptive statistics of collections phases and their levels of significance for 

post hoc comparisons are presented in Table 5. A significant effect of pregnancy was 

observed in all joints of the lower limb with the exception of the hip joint. 

Between the first and second trimesters the right limb showed a significant 

increase in maximum knee flexion (third peak) with an average difference of 3.1 

degrees and a significant decrease in maximum knee extension (fourth peak), with a 

difference of 4.2 degrees. The hip joint showed a significant decrease of hip extension 

in the first peak from the second trimester and from the third trimester to the 

postpartum period a decrease of 5.6 and 7.3 degrees respectively.

The second peak of the right hip joint showed a significant increase of hip 

flexion from first to second and from second to third trimesters, and also from second 

and third trimesters to the postpartum period, with values of flexion which increased by 

more than five degrees at the end of pregnancy. In the segment of the pelvis, 

significant changes were verified between the first trimester and the second and third 

trimesters, with an increase of 2.97, 3.68, 4.6 and 5.31 degrees, respectively for the 

first peak, and above five degrees for the second peak. Between the second and the 

third trimesters, and between pregnancy and postpartum periods, a significant 

decrease in the pelvic tilt of 4.6 and 5.31 degrees respectively, was evidenced by the 

first peak.

 Frontal Plane 

In the frontal plane, it was found that pregnancy influences the angular values of 

the joints of the lower limbs (Figure 3).

in the later stages of first (dotted line), second (dashed line) and third trimester (solid line) and of the postpartum period

The descriptive statistics of collections phases and respective levels of 

significance of post hoc tests are presented in Table 6. Most of the variables did not 

show any changes during pregnancy and postpartum, with the exception of the second 

and third peak of the ankle, the first peak of the hip, and the second peak of the pelvis.  

Changes between the first and third trimesters of pregnancy in the second and 

third peak of the ankle were subtle but significant, with an increase of 3 degrees in 

ankle inversion for late pregnancy, and 2.45 degrees between the first trimester and 

the postpartum period.

The hip joint showed a slight decrease of 2 degrees in hip adduction between

second trimesters, and a slight increase of 0.22 degrees between the first and third 

trimesters. 

 

 Transverse Plane 

The statistical analysis of angular data in the transverse plane shows that these 

are influenced by the particular stage of pregnancy (Figure 4). The descriptive statistics 

of collections phases and the respective level of significance from post hoc 

comparisons are presented in Table 7.

The first peak of the hip joint in the transverse plane showed a slight but 

significant increase in internal rotation of the thigh from the first to the second and third 

trimesters. From the second and third trimesters to postpartum, there continued to be a 

significant increase. These increases were between two and three degrees of internal 

rotation of the hip. 

 Discussion 

The main goal of this longitudinal study was to describe the changes in the gait 

biomechanical parameters throughout pregnancy and in the postpartum period. The 3D 

analysis of kinematic parameters as well as of spatial and temporal parameters was 

performed. The hypothesis that these parameters are influenced by the course of 

pregnancy is rejected for the spatial and temporal variables during walking, and 

accepted for the kinematic variables in the three planes of motion. In our previous 

study (Branco et al., 2013) and in Foti et al. (2000) found higher values in the stride 

width and in the double support time for third trimester, when compared to the values 

found in the postpartum or in control group, respectively, and are largely influenced by 

the stage of pregnancy. However, even without significant changes in this study, the 

stride width was 1.4 cm larger in the third trimester than in early pregnancy, and 

decreases in postpartum, and the double support time also features the inverted U-

shaped, with an increase of 0.17 seconds between the first and the third trimesters and 

a decrease from the third trimester to postpartum of 0.20 seconds, which seems to 

point to the same behaviour as the literature. A possible explanation for discrepancies 

in the results between our study and literature may be due to sample size. 

The kinematic parameters in the three planes of motion are influenced by the 

progression of pregnancy, checking for deviations in several angular data of the lower 

limb joints. In the sagittal plane, the knee, hip, and the segment of the pelvis present 

the major changes during pregnancy. There are few studies in the literature that 

referred knee changes during pregnancy and postpartum. Our results are in line with 

Carpes et al. (2008) that found a significant increase in knee flexion in the terminal 

stance phase, and with our previous study (Branco et al., 2013). We also found a 

decrease in knee extension at the end of swing phase, which may be the result of a 

lower participation of the knee extensors. This may be associated to back pain, 

specifically with sacroiliac pain, referred by pregnant women (Huang et al., 2002).  

The hip joint has been referenced in the literature as the joint where major 

changes occur in late pregnancy. In our study an increase in flexion of the hip during 



Chapter 3 – 3D kinematic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum 

 

 
38 

stance phase was found which is supported by previous studies (Branco et al., 2013; 

Foti et al., 2000; Hagan &amp;amp; Wong, 2010), leaving effectively no peak of hip extension 

during pre-swing phase.  

The published results about the pelvis are consistent across the studies, 

showing an increased anterior tilt of five degrees throughout the gait cycle (Foti et al., 

2000; Hagan &amp;amp; Wong, 2010). In this study, in addition to assessing the significant 

increase in this anterior tilt, we discriminated that this increase occurs, between the first 

and second trimesters and remained similar between the second and third trimesters, 

as previously observed (Branco et al., 2013). This pelvis position, seems to agree with 

the morphological changes already undertaken by pregnant women at the end of the 

second trimester, where there are an increase in abdominal volume and weight of the 

foetus that affects about 40% of its final weight (Whitcome et al., 2007), combined with 

a lower capacity for force production by rectus abdominis. However, Foti et al. (2000) 

state that the function of the anterior pelvic tilt, combined with an increase of lumbar 

lordosis is to keep the body in an upright position. After delivery, between the fourth 

and sixth months, there is a significant reduction in the pelvic anterior tilt angle similar 

to those found in the first trimester which seems to be an indicator of the recovery of 

the pelvis position in postpartum, also observed in the literature between pregnancy 

and the postpartum (Branco et al., 2013; Foti et al., 2000; Hagan &amp;amp; Wong, 2010). 

Regarding the sagittal plane, the results confirmed that the angular data show 

deviations associated with pregnancy and are recovered in the postpartum period. 

In the frontal plane, there are influences of the stage of pregnancy on the 

angular data, revealing significant changes in the ankle, hip and pelvis segment. Few 

studies have examined the frontal plane changes. Gilleard (2013) found a reduction in 

the amplitude of the unilateral elevation of the pelvis. In this study, during the mid-

stance, there was an increase of the magnitude of the fall of the pelvis from the third 

trimester to the postpartum period. During the toe-off, the pelvis shows a slight 

decrease in elevation between the first and second trimesters, and an increased 

elevation of the pelvis between the first and the third trimesters. Both results suggest 

that, in late pregnancy, the dynamic of the two angular peaks of the pelvis is related to 

the attempt to control the angular momentum of the trunk caused by the increase of its 

moment of inertia (Gilleard, 2013). In the hip joint, this study showed a decrease in the 

hip adduction during the mid-stance phase, between the first and third trimesters. In a 

previous study, (Branco et al., 2013) we found similar results between the second and 

third trimesters and between pregnant and non-pregnant women. However, Foti et al. 

(2000) point to a contradictory result, showing an increase in hip adduction between 



Chapter 3 – 3D kinematic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum 

 

 
39 

 

participants at the end of pregnancy and one year after delivery. The ankle joint 

showed no changes in the frontal plane in the literature (Branco et al., 2013). In this 

study, however, there are significant changes in the pre-swing phase, with an increase 

of ankle inversion from the first to the third trimester and to the postpartum period, 

showing that this parameter does not recover and remains at least up to six months 

after delivery. The ankle inversion between the first and third trimesters keeps 

significantly increased until the mid-swing phase, showing that both stances as the 

swing phases of the pregnant woman are with an increased inversion of the foot during 

pregnancy. Since the changes only occur between the first and third trimester, and 

remain in the postpartum, justifies the fact that it has not been found in previous 

studies, which only studied women since the end of the second trimester. In the frontal 

plane, the hypothesis that the data show angular deviations associated with pregnancy, 

is accepted for the above variables. However, the hypothesis that these variables 

retake the values of early pregnancy is not accepted only for the inversion of the ankle, 

which keeps increased up to the postpartum period. 

The kinematic parameters in transverse plane remain largely unchanged during 

pregnancy and postpartum, however there is an increase in the hip internal rotation 

from the first to the second and to the third trimester. In the postpartum period there is 

a continuous increase in internal rotation during the terminal stance phase. According 

to Los Amigos Research Education Institute Inc et al. (2001), the internal rotation of the 

hip during the single support, is associated with an internal rotation contracture, 

femoral anteversion or an intention to increase knee stability, leading to a toe-in 

position, hindering the forward advancement and may increase pressure on the lateral 

side of the knee joint. Regarding transverse plane, the hypothesis that the data show 

angular deviations associated with pregnancy, is rejected for most variables except for 

internal rotation of the hip. This variable, however, does not return the values of early 

pregnancy, rejecting that hypothesis, by remaining increased until the last moment of 

collection. 

 Conclusions 

This study followed a descriptive longitudinal type design, in which pregnant 

women were assessed in the first, second and third trimesters of pregnancy and also in 

the postpartum period. The gait analysis showed that pregnancy is a factor which 

influences the kinematic variables of the lower limb joints. The pelvis and hip joint are 

the segments that experience greater changes throughout pregnancy. Changes in the 

sagittal plane indicate that there is greater care in the anterior progression of the body. 



Chapter 3 – 3D kinematic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum 

 

 
40 

However the temporal and spatial data reveal no significant changes over the gait 

cycle. In the remaining planes of motion, there is less amplitude of motor actions, which 

seem to indicate greater constraints on movement. In general the results retrieve the 

values from the beginning of pregnancy, indicating that the body was self-organized in 

order to overcome the morphological and physiological changes which women suffer 

during pregnancy and that has the ability to adapt depending on the demands. Other 

questions are raised by these results, in particular if these kinematic changes bring an 

overload to the musculoskeletal system of the pregnant woman and its association with 

lumbopelvic pain.

 Abstract 

Pregnant women experience several adaptations in morphology and physiology 

throughout pregnancy. Some of the biomechanical adaptations that occur result in 

changes in gait pattern and daily task performance. These changes may also 

contribute to musculoskeletal overuse conditions such as low-back and pelvic pain. 

However, the biomechanical adaptations of gait remain only partially understood. The 

purpose of this study was prospectively to describe and compare the kinetic 

parameters in the joints of the lower limb during gait at the end of the first, second and 

third trimesters of pregnancy and in the postpartum period in healthy pregnant women. 

A three-dimensional analysis was performed by 11 participants. Repeated measures 

were performed for comparisons between periods. The main results show a reduction 

in vertical reaction forces, as the pregnancy advances, indicating a smaller downward 

acceleration for the advancement of the body, as well as the transmission of weight. 

Pregnant women showed during most of the stance phase medial reaction forces as a 

motor response to promote body stability. Several changes were observed in the lower 

limb kinetics, most of which showed a decrease in the different planes of motion for all 

joints, including the participation of the flexors and extensors of the thigh and its 

eccentric contraction, and decreases in the production of the mechanical energy of 

knee extensors, the participation of ankle plantar flexors, and the eccentric contraction 

of the ankle abductors. Only one parameter showed an increase of the mechanical 

load of the hip joint, whereby there were significant increases in the participation of the 

external hip rotator. In conclusion, the joint which undergoes the most evident changes 

is the hip. The generality of the results points to biomechanical adjustments that show 

a decrease of the mechanical load of women throughout pregnancy in order to avoid 

strong interaction with the ground.

 Introduction 

During the normal development of pregnancy, women experience a variety of 

morphological and physiological changes, as well as a continuous increase in body 

weight (A.C.O.G., 2010; Institute of Medicine and National Research Council of the 

National Academies, 2009). However, it is not fully described the dynamics of the load 

that women experience, and how this weight gain influence everyday tasks, such as 

walking. Walking is widely used not only as a mean of locomotion, but also as a mode 

of exercise, especially recommended throughout pregnancy and without 

contraindications for pregnant women (Artal &amp;amp; O'Toole, 2003).  

The ground reaction forces (GRF) have been widely studied in the 

characterization of walking, however only in the last two decades these parameters 

were studied in pregnant women. The importance of these parameters to investigate 

the stability and possible causes of falls in pregnant women has been the focus of 

recent studies. Lymbery and Gilleard (2005) concluded that in late pregnancy the 

mediolateral GRF tended to be increased in a medial direction along with a wider step 

width, suggesting that women may adapt their gait to maximize stability in the stance 

phase of walking and to control mediolateral motion. Branco, Santos-Rocha, Vieira, 

Aguiar, and Veloso (In press) in a previous study, analysed the tri-dimensional 

adaptations of kinetic parameters between the second and third trimester of twenty four 

pregnancy women and with a control group. Most of the results reveal significant 

changes between pregnancy stages and non-pregnant group, reporting a decrease of 

the mechanical load of pregnant women, specifically with a lower magnitude in the third 

peak of vertical GRF and in the second peak of anterior component of GRF, and most 

of the stance phase has a medial GRF. According to Abu Osman and Mat Ghazali 

(2002) and McCrory, Chambers, Daftary, and Redfern (2011) no changes were found 

for GRF in the collected groups. However, in most studies only the last stages of 

pregnancy were considered (exception for (Abu Osman and Mat Ghazali (2002); Inanir, 

Cakmak, Hisim, and Demirturk (2014)), not getting clearly defined if there is any 

influence of pregnancy condition on these variables, and if these changes happen 

gradually from the beginning of pregnancy. Such as the GRF, the joint kinetics is 

mostly studied in the last two trimesters of pregnancy or between the end of pregnancy 

and postpartum (with exception for the study of Huang et al. (2002)). Foti et al. (2000) 

regarding this analysis, reported significant increases in hip and ankle kinetics during 

pregnancy. Their findings show that during pregnancy there may be an increased 

demand placed on the hip abductors, hip extensors, and ankle plantarflexors muscles 



Chapter 4 – 3D kinetic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum 

 

 
46 

during walking. Branco et al. (In press) analyse the tri-dimensional adaptations of 

kinetic parameters between the second and third trimester of twenty four pregnancy 

women and with a control group. Most of the changes reveal significant changes 

between pregnancy stages and non-pregnant group. In the joint moments they found a 

decrease in hip flexors, knee extensors, ankle dorsiflexors, and ankle evertors’ 

moment, and an increase in the participation of hip external rotators during loading 

response phase of pregnant women. In the joint powers they found significant 

decreases in the absorption of mechanical energy of hip flexors, and significant 

decreases in the production of mechanical energy of the hip abductors and in the ankle 

plantarflexors. An increase in the production of mechanical energy was found for hip 

extensors and hip external rotators. Huang et al. (2002) compared the gait pattern of 

non-pregnant and pregnant women divided into three groups, respectively: 12 weeks, 

13-28 weeks, and 29-40 weeks of gestation, which were tested only once. They 

reported significant differences between the pregnant and non-pregnant women, 

especially in knee abduction angle, knee and hip internal rotation angles, hip extension 

moment, and hip power. Also, as gestational age increased, the pregnant group 

increased hip extension moment, decreased knee extension moment, increased knee 

adduction moment and decreased ankle plantar flexion moment. It is not clear 

however, in the different studies (with exception of Branco et al. (In press)), if these 

changes occur bilaterally, occur only unilaterally, or correspond to an average values 

between sides. 

 Objectives  

Thus, the main purpose of this study was to assess the gait kinetics, in order to 

check if there are any changes in the dynamics of the load of women from the 

beginning of pregnancy until the postpartum period. To achieve the main objective, it 

was necessary to describe and quantify the kinetic variables, regarding to GRF, joints 

moment of force and joints power, of ankle, knee and hip, during gait, at the end of the 

first, second and third trimesters of pregnancy and in the postpartum period. 

We tested the hypothesis that the GRF, joints moment and joints power 

parameters exhibit deviations along the pregnancy and are associated to this special 

phase of life, which are recovered in the postpartum period.

 Materials and Methods 

 Subjects 

Eleven pregnant women, aged between 32 and 37 years (33.20 ± 1.62 years) 

and with no history of foot, ankle, knee, musculoskeletal, and neuromuscular trauma or 

disease, participated in this study. The characteristics of weight and weeks of gestation 

in the four periods of data collection were: 1) first trimester: 61.1 ± 6.6 kg and 14.2 ± 

2.4 wk; 2) second trimester: 66.6 ± 8.5 kg and 27.3 ± 1.0 wk; 3) third trimester: 71.0 ± 

8.0 kg and 36.3 ± 0.9 wk; and, 4) postpartum period: 62.4 ± 7.4 kg and 20.6 ± 5.2 wk. 

The participants were recruited via direct contact and flyers placed in gym and 

health centres and volunteered to participate in the study. None of the participants had 

contraindications regarding physical exercise. All subjects gave written informed 

consent prior to their participation in the study.  

 Data Collection and Processing 

The study was approved by the ethical committee of the Faculty of Human 

Kinetics (University of Lisbon) and data were collected at the Laboratory of 

Biomechanics and Functional Morphology in four periods: during the later stages of the 

first, second and third trimesters of gestation and in the postpartum period. Before the 

motor task was performed, anthropometric data were measured (weight and height), 

according to the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK) 

standardized measurement protocol (Stewart et al., 2011) by ISAK certified 

anthropometrists, to calculate the body segment masses and inertia moments.  

In order to collect static and dynamic data trials, spherical reflective markers 

were placed on the skin on both sides of the lower body with double-sided adhesive 

tape. The marker set-up was in agreement with the recommendation of Cappozzo and 

colleagues (Cappozzo et al., 1997) for lower limb segments, and CODA (Charnwood 

Dynamics Ltd, Leicestershire, United Kingdom) protocols for models of the pelvic 

segment.  

The motor task was to walk barefoot for a distance of 10 metres between two 

points in a straight line in both directions at a natural and comfortable speed for three 

minutes. The floor had no specific patterns or irregularities, and the participants had no 

knowledge about the location of force platforms, which were placed in the middle of the 

defined distance. Participants were allowed to become familiar with the laboratory 



Chapter 4 – 3D kinetic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum 

 

 
48 

system and no fatigue occurrence was reported. The participants performed three non-

consecutive minutes' walking at a comfortable speed. 

Planar motion of the hip, knee and ankle joints was calculated with Visual 3D 

(V3D) software (C-Motion Inc., Germantown, USA) by a computational procedure 

implementing the dot product between the skeletal segments articulated by these joints 

(Figure 5).

lateral view of the model. 

Kinematic data were collected by 12 infrared high-speed cameras (Oqus-300, 

Qualisys, Sweden) at a rate of 200 Hz, and kinetic data were collected with two Kistler 

force platforms (Kistler AG, Winterthur, Switzerland) measuring 0.60 m x 0.40 m and 

one AMTI platform (Advanced Mechanical Technology, Inc., Watertown, U.S.A.) 

measuring 0.90 m x 0.60 m, at a rate of 1000 Hz. The capture hardware was 

connected to a Qualisys USB Analog Acquisition interface in order to synchronize 

kinetic and kinematic data with software Qualisys Track Manager (QTM; Qualisys AB, 

Gothenburg, Sweden). Both data sequences were recorded in the same file. The 

system was calibrated by wand type, with an exact wand length of 751.4 mm moved 

randomly across the recorded field, before the data collection of each participant.

Calibration was accepted if the standard deviation of the wand’s length measures was 

below 0.5 mm. Cameras were positioned statically to minimize light reflection artefacts 

and to allow recording of at least two consecutive walking cycles, defined as the time 

between two consecutive initial ground contacts of the heel strike with each foot. The 

last four cycles performed by each participant were considered in the analysis.  

A 3D analysis was performed, including both sides of the body. The trajectory of 

the reflective markers was smoothed with a Butterworth low-pass filter with a 10 Hz 

cut-off. Collected data were interpolated by means of cubic spline interpolation as 

suggested by Robertson and colleagues (2014), for a maximum 10-frame gap, and 

filtered with a Butterworth digital low pass filter, at 10 Hz cut-off frequency for kinematic 

and kinetic data, as suggested by Robertson and Dowling (2003). All data were 

normalized in time. 

The four time phases were considered in analysis, and kinetic pattern curves of 

the three components of the GRF were normalized to units of body weight, and were 

estimated relative to the total time of contact of the foot with the ground. These data 

curves and peak values were estimated for left and right sides with V3D software (C-

Motion, Inc., Germantown, USA).  

The net joint moments and powers of the ankle, knee and hip were calculated 

with an inverse dynamics approach, considering an XYZ Cardan sequence for joint 

angles, and resolved for the proximal segment’s coordinate system (Selbie, Hamill, &amp;amp; 

Kepple, 2014) in Visual3D software. For kinetic parameters, initial foot contact data 

were collected at the time corresponding to first contact of the foot on the floor, and 

final contact data were collected at the last contact of the foot on the floor. 

In the four periods under analysis, the following variables of the GRF curves 

were analysed: three peaks characterized the vertical component, two peaks 

characterized the anterior-posterior component, and two peaks characterized the 

medial-lateral component. 

The joints’ moments’ patterns were as follows. The hip was characterized by 

two peaks in the sagittal plane, two peaks in the frontal plane, and one peak in the 

transverse plane. The knee moment was characterized by three peaks in the sagittal 

plane. The ankle moment was characterized by two peaks in the sagittal plane, one 

peak in the frontal plane, and two peaks in the transverse plane. 

The joints’ power patterns were as follows. The hip power was characterized by 

two peaks in the sagittal plane, three peaks in the frontal plane, and two peaks in the 

transverse plane. The knee power was characterized by three peaks in the sagittal 



Chapter 4 – 3D kinetic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum 

 

 
50 

plane. The ankle power was characterized by two peaks in the sagittal plane, two 

peaks in the frontal plane, and two peaks in the transverse plane.  

 Statistical Analysis 

All statistical procedures were conducted with IBM SPSS Statistics 22 software 

for Windows. Shapiro-Wilk normality tests were conducted and not assumed for all 

cases. The Mauchly’s test of sphericity was performed before repeated measures RM) 

analysis and sphericity was not assumed in all tests. For post hoc tests, the Bonferroni 

test based on Student's t statistic was used, after adjustment of the observed 

significance level to account for the fact that multiple comparisons were made. For 

variables and groups which not fulfil all assumptions for RM analysis, the Friedman test 

was performed, and for pairwise analysis the Wilcoxon test was performed. In this 

case, Bonferroni confidence interval adjustment was applied to cater for the confidence 

intervals and significance values for multiple comparisons. 

 Results 

 Ground Reaction Forces 

Most of the components of the GRF are influenced by the stage of pregnancy, 

particularly in the three peaks of the vertical component; in the two peaks of the 

anterior-posterior component; and at the first peak of the medial-lateral component of 

GRF (Figure 6).

The first and second peaks of vertical GRF shows significant changes from third 

trimester to the postpartum period, emphasizing an increase of 4% in the braking peak 

and a decrease of 5% of bodyweight (BW) in the inverted peak for right lower limb. In 

both stances, were observed a significant decrease of 5% BW in the third peak from 

the first to the third trimester, and an increase of about 7% BW from the end of 

pregnancy to postpartum period, which corresponds to a recovery to values above 

those recorded in early pregnancy. Also in propulsive peak, to the right stance, there is 

a decrease of 4% BW from second to third trimester. In the anterior-posterior 

component of GRF, were found an increase of 2% BW from first trimester to 

postpartum period in the posterior direction (first peak) of the right lower limb, and a 

decrease of 2% BW in the anterior direction (second peak) of the left lower limb which 

represents that at the end of pregnancy the participants apply less of their bodyweight 

of force against the floor in the loading response phase and in the pre-swing phase. 

The medial-lateral component of GRF decreases in the first peak, moving from a 

medial reaction to a lateral reaction in the third trimester to the postpartum period. 

 Joint Moments of Force 

 Sagittal Plane 

A longitudinal effect of pregnancy in joint moments of force in the sagittal plane 

was observed for some peaks of hip and ankle joints (Figure 7).

The moment of force in hip joint shows a significant decrease of 0.128 N.m.kg-1 

in the action of hip extensors, during loading response phase from first to third trimester 

in the right lower limb, and an increase of respectively 0.87 N.m.kg-1 and 0.154 N.m.kg-

1 from first (left side) and third trimester (both sides) to postpartum period, indicating 

that there is an opposite trend to what happens during pregnancy even from the 

beginning. In terminal stance phase, only for right side, there is a significant decrease 

of 0.156 N.m.kg-1 in the action of the hip flexors from the beginning to the end of 

pregnancy, and an increase of respectively 0.208 N.m.kg-1 and 0.285 N.m.kg-1 from the 

second and third trimesters to postpartum, similar to what happens at the beginning of 

the stance phase. No changes were found in knee moments of force during pregnancy

and postpartum period. The ankle plantarflexors participation shows a significant 

decreasing of 0.082 N.m.kg-1 from first to third trimester, in right ankle, and an increase 

of 0.075 N.m.kg-1 on their participation from late pregnancy to postpartum period, for 

left ankle. 

 Frontal Plane 

The longitudinal effect of pregnancy was not observed in the frontal plane, and 

therefore no significant changes were found in any of the analysed variables (Figure 8).

moments of the hip, and ankle, for right and left lower limbs. The curve peaks are Indicated by numbers: 1st and 2nd, and 
(*) points the significant differences. 

One possible reason for the lack of statistical changes, may be revealed by the 

descriptive statistics of these variables, and relates to the fact that they present the 

highest variability (standard deviation) between the analyses of the planes of motion. 



Chapter 4 – 3D kinetic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum 

 

 
56 

 Transverse Plane 

In the transverse plane, the effect of pregnancy was only observable in hip joint 

for the mid-stance phase (Wilks’ ?=0.201, F(3,8)=10.573, p=0.004) (Figure 9). 

 

Figure 9. Joints moments in the transverse plane during gait (in N.m.kg-1. Each line represent the later stages of first

moments of the hip, and ankle, for right and left lower limbs. The curve peaks are indicated by numbers: 1st and 2nd and 

(*) points the significant differences. 

During this phase, there is an increase in the participation of the external 

rotators of the right hip throughout pregnancy, most pronounced between the first and 

second trimester and less pronounced between the first and third trimester, with 

increases in 0.204 N.m.kg-1 and 0.106 N.m.kg-1, respectively. From the second 

trimester to the postpartum period, the participation of external rotators of the hip 

decreased significantly to values close to those found in early pregnancy.

 Joint Power 

 Sagittal Plane 

A longitudinal effect of pregnancy in joint power was observed for some peaks 

of hip and knee joints (Figure 10).

values of early pregnancy, when compared to the values observed during late 

pregnancy.

The second peak of hip joint power shows a significant increase of 0.372 W.kg-1 

and 0.257 W.kg-1, respectively for right and left lower limb, from third trimester to

flexors during terminal stance phase in late pregnancy. The influence of pregnancy on

knee joint was verified in the second and third peak, however, it was found a significant 

increase of 0.145 W.kg-1, only in the second peak between first trimester and 

postpartum period, which means that during mid-stance phase, pregnant women in 

early pregnancy did a minor concentric contraction of the knee extensors. In the power 

of ankle joint there was found no significant changes between collection phases. 

 Frontal Plane 

The longitudinal effect of pregnancy was not observed in the frontal plane, 

except for the first peak power of the left hip joint (Figure 11).

 Transverse Plane 

A longitudinal effect of pregnancy in the joint power of the transverse plane was 

observed for some peaks of hip and ankle joints (Figure 12).

In right hip joint, was observed an increase of 0.365 W.kg-1 in eccentric 

contraction of the external rotators of the hip between first and second trimester of 

pregnancy, during loading response phase. The left ankle joint, shows a significant 

decrease of around 0.06 W.kg-1 in the ankle abductors, from the first and second 

trimesters to late pregnancy, which represents a lower eccentric contraction of these 

muscles during terminal stance phase. 

 Discussion 

This study aimed to analyse the biomechanics of gait during pregnancy and 

postpartum period in a longitudinal perspective, in order to understand if there are any 

changes in the kinetic parameters of gait between collection phases. While other 



Chapter 4 – Kinetic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum

studies did not  found any changes in the vertical or anterior components of GRF (Abu 

Osman &amp;amp; Mat Ghazali, 2002; Lymbery &amp;amp; Gilleard, 2005; McCrory et al., 2011), in this 

study the quantification of vertical GRF has shown a decrease in the braking and 

propulsive peaks from late pregnancy to postpartum period where it has values similar 

to those found in the first two trimesters of pregnancy. This results suggests that 

downward acceleration for the advancement of the body of the pregnant women and 

respective force production in the transmission of weight are smaller in late pregnancy 

(Perry, 1992). In the medial-lateral component, it was found that in late pregnancy 

women have more medial reaction for left lower limb, similarly to the results also found 

by Takeda, Junji, Aya, Sigeko, and Yosie (2009) and our previous study [5] particularly 

during the loading response phase, which means that participants maintain the medial 

force during most of the stance phase. Few studies have found significant changes in 

the medial reaction forces, but many authors make reference to a greater instability in 

the frontal plane of the pregnant woman (e.g., Branco et al., In press; Lymbery &amp;amp; 

Gilleard, 2005; McCrory et al., 2011), for which these results indicate the motor 

response to this instability, thereby promoting greater body stability. The fact that the 

changes only happen in one of the lower limbs shows that the compensations derived 

from imbalances can happen only in one of the limbs to maintain balance, and 

reinforces the need to make analyses of the two sides. 

In the sagittal plane, the kinetics of the hip joint has a significant reduction in the 

participation of the hip extensors during the loading response phase, which is highly 

associated with pregnancy. The participation of the hip extensors is related with the 

acceptance and support of the weight, which may be adversely affected by the reduced 

contribution of these muscles as the pregnancy progresses. At the terminal stance 

phase a reduction in the participation of the right hip flexors were established, also 

accompanied by a decrease in eccentric contraction of these muscles. In this phase, 

the extension of the thigh is promoted by inertia and gravity (Whittle, 2007), and these 

results suggest less control in this motor action by pregnant women. In fact, the main 

objective of the hip joint muscles during the stance phase is the stabilization of the 

trunk (Perry, 1992), function that is affected, taking into account the majority of the 

results found. 

In our previous study (Branco et al., In press) there was a significant decrease 

in knee joint moments between the group of pregnant women and the group of non-

pregnant, showing that changes in the knee joint moments happen until the end of the 

first trimester. This is not observed in the present study, where the participation of the 

knee joint flexor and extensor remain similar throughout pregnancy. However, the 



Chapter 4 – 3D kinetic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum 

 

 
62 

variation of mechanical energy in these muscle groups has been influenced by 

pregnancy, with a significant reduction in the production of mechanical energy of the 

right knee extensors during mid-stance phase. The main function of the kinetics of the 

knee during this phase is to stabilize lower limbs when the total body weight is 

transferred for a single limb support, which in this case might be compromised. The 

kinetics of the ankle is influenced by pregnancy in participation of the plantarflexors 

during the pre-swing phase, with a decrease throughout pregnancy and a recovery of 

that participation in postpartum period. Two indications can be drawn from these 

results: the first is that the acceleration of the limb forward will be lower in late 

pregnancy; and the second is that this participation is fully recovered after delivery. 

Other studies reported some changes in the joint moments for the frontal plane, 

particularly an increase of the hip joint moments (tested only between third trimester 

and postpartum) the knee joint moments (Huang et al., 2002), and a decrease of ankle 

joint moments (Branco et al., In press). In this study no changes were found throughout 

pregnancy or postpartum. However, we found the influence of pregnancy on the 

absorption of mechanical energy in the hip abductors during late loading response 

phase, without a specific change between collected phases. One possible reason for 

the absence of any changes in the frontal plane may be revealed by the descriptive 

statistics of these variables, which relates to the fact that they present the highest 

variability (standard deviation) between the analyses of the planes of motion. 

Only our previous study (Branco et al., In press) reports changes during 

pregnancy in the transverse plane kinetics. In this study, during the loading response 

phase, significant increases were found in the participation of the right hip external 

rotators, and eccentric contraction of these muscles, particularly in the second half of 

the pregnancy. This action is responsible for deceleration of the pelvis rotation, which 

aids in the advancement of the contralateral thigh (Perry, 1992), indicating that during 

pregnancy there is an increased control in advance of the contralateral limb. During the 

terminal stance phase, a decrease in eccentric contraction of the left ankle abductors 

along the pregnancy was observed, which indicates less control in the position of the 

left foot during the first moments of heel rise. The hypothesis of this study, that 

pregnancy is associated with kinetic adaptations, is partially confirmed by many of the 

kinetic parameters, for the three planes of motion. Only partially because were found 

changes in many kinetic variables, but only in few of them the changes happen 

bilaterally and the recovery of these parameters were not confirmed in all cases, 

especially in the transverse plane. This result indicates that some situations of body 

instability might be maintained in the postpartum, suggesting the importance of 



Chapter 4 – Kinetic adaptations throughout pregnancy and postpartum 

 

 
63 

 

physical activity, in order to promote the full recovery of the body stability. In the sagittal 

plane, for the vast majority of the parameters with significant changes, a recovery to 

values similar to those found in early pregnancy was observed, confirming the 

hypothesis raised.  

According to Forczek and Staszkiewicz (2012), the pregnant woman has two 

main strategies for adjustment of biomechanical parameters: first to increase the body 

stability, and; second, to reduce the energy expenditure. Based on our results, the 

second approach seems to be adopted in respect to the kinetic parameters. However, 

most studies on kinematic parameters of pregnant women during walking, point to 

findings related to the first strategy. This suggests that, on the one hand, the woman 

increases her body stability in detriment of cost energy (based on kinematics), and on 

the other hand, reduces the mechanical load in order to reduce the energy cost (based 

on kinetics). This reflection shows a balance between strategies, which require further 

analysis. This is in line with some theories of motor behaviour that indicate that when 

the body is faced with constraints of the organism (and possibly other constraints) it 

self-organizes in order to have greater efficiency (Goldfield, 1995; Kugler &amp;amp; Turvey, 

1988).  

With regard to changes during pregnancy, the morphological and body 

composition parameters are those that are widely known. However, it is not known how 

these variables influence the biomechanical parameters, or which of them give further 

explanation to mechanical changes in the musculoskeletal system of the pregnant 

woman. Thus, we suggest that future studies quantify the morphological and body 

composition changes, and analyse how these changes influence the biomechanical 

parameters of women throughout pregnancy and in the postpartum period. 

 Conclusions 

A descriptive longitudinal type design was performed, in which pregnant women 

were assessed in the first, second and third trimesters of pregnancy and in the sixth 

month of the postpartum period. The biomechanical analysis of the lower limb during 

gait showed that pregnancy is a factor that influences the kinetic variables of the ankle, 

knee and hip joints. The joint that undergoes the most evident changes is by far the 

hip. This fact may be justified by being closer to the body region with greater 

anatomical and morphological changes. The overall results point to biomechanical 

adjustments that show a decrease of the mechanical load of women throughout 

pregnancy, possibly in order to avoid strong interaction between women and the

ground, confirmed by the decrease of GRF, the joint moments and joint powers in the 

sagittal plane, whose parameters are primarily responsible for the progression of the 

body in space. These results point to some applications to this population, namely the 

need to perform physical activities for the development of body stability, particularly the 

stability of the joints of the lower limbs

 Abstract 

Pregnancy is a special phase of women's lives, which process leads to several 

changes in body composition and morphology. With these changes, it is not clear 

whether the biomechanical changes occurring in this period are due exclusively to body 

composition and body size, or due to other physiological factors. The purpose of this 

study was to quantify the anthropometry and body composition of women throughout 

pregnancy and in the postpartum period, and identify the contribution of these 

parameters on the lower limb joints kinetic during gait. Eleven healthy Caucasian 

women (33.2±1.6years old) were assessed longitudinally, during pregnancy and in 

postpartum, regarding several anthropometric measurements to determine body 

composition and kinetic parameters of gait. Most of the variables associated with body 

composition and body dimensions showed a significant increase during pregnancy and 

a decrease in the postpartum. Maternal’s body composition in the postpartum was 

similar to those found in the 1st trimester, except for triceps skinfold, calf total area, and 

body mass index, with higher results than at the beginning of pregnancy. The 

application of the linear regression technique for predicting women's internal loading 

during pregnancy and in the postpartum period through anthropometric variables, 

developed four models that include variables associated with the amount of fat, four 

models that include variables related to overall body weight, three models that include 

fat-free mass, and one model that includes the shape of the trunk as a predictor 

variable. The study showed significant changes during pregnancy, regarding the 

variables associated with global body composition. The absolute amount of fat 

increases significantly to the end of pregnancy, especially by the contribution of the 

adipose tissue accumulated in skinfolds of upper limbs and the upper trunk. All models 

had an adjusted R squared between 29.6 and 66.9, indicating that changes in 

maternal’s body composition and morphology, largely determine kinetic dynamics of 

the female joints in this particular stage of life

 Introduction 

During pregnancy and in the postpartum period, the woman’s body experiences 

large changes in morphology, physiology and consequently, in body composition. The 

association between body composition, particularly the increase of maternal weight and 

health related problems are known for mother and child well-being (Leddy, Power, &amp;amp; 

Schulkin, 2008; Tenenbaum-Gavish &amp;amp; Hod, 2013). According to Institute of Medicine 

and National Research Council of the National Academies (2009), women with a body 

mass index (BMI) lower than 19.8kg/m2 (underweight) should increase their weight 

between 12.5kg and 18kg; women with BMI between 19.8kg/m2 and 26.0kg/m2 (normal 

weight) must have an increase in body weight between 11.5kg and 16kg; women with 

BMI between 26kg/m2 and 29.0kg/m2 (overweight) must have an increase in weight of 

7kg to 11.5kg; women with BMI equal or greater than 29kg/m2 (obese) should gain at 

least 6.8kg. For women carrying twins, the recommended target total weight gain at 

term is 16.0 to 20.5kg (Institute of Medicine and National Research Council of the 

National Academies, 2009; Silva &amp;amp; Bellotto, 2015). 

Weight gain during pregnancy has been widely studied and is reported in 

several studies as described below. In general, during pregnancy the weight gain 

stands at around 11kg (Kopp-Hoolihan, Van Loan, Wong, &amp;amp; King, 1999; Larciprete et 

al., 2003; Soltani &amp;amp; Fraser, 2000) although it has been increasing in recent years from 

9kg (Thame, Trotman, Osmond, Fletcher, &amp;amp; Antoine, 2007) to 14.5kg (Straughen, 

Trudeau, &amp;amp; Misra, 2013) in non-obese women, with much of these gains occurring 

during the 2nd trimester. However, in late pregnancy, women accumulate an average of 

4kg of body fat (Kopp-Hoolihan et al., 1999; Larciprete et al., 2003; Thame et al., 

2007). The prevalence of women with normal weight significantly decreased between 

the 2nd and the 3rd trimesters from 63.2% to 39.5%, respectively (Perez, Murillo, 

Hernandez, &amp;amp; Herrera, 2010). After delivery, the woman's weight remains above her 

pre-pregnancy body weight (Kopp-Hoolihan et al., 1999) or in early pregnancy (Soltani 

&amp;amp; Fraser, 2000). 

Women classified as obese in early pregnancy have significantly higher sum of 

skinfolds thickness and higher fat mass gains compared to normal weight women 

(Soltani &amp;amp; Fraser, 2000). Although different studies showed an increase of the skinfolds 

thickness throughout pregnancy, changes were not always significant. Thus, the 

skinfolds that showed significant increases were: subscapular, suprailiac and thigh 

(Piperata, Dufour, Reina, &amp;amp; Spurr, 2002); triceps, biceps and subscapular (Lopez, 

Calvo, Poy, Balmaceda, &amp;amp; Camera, 2011); and mid-thigh and calf skinfolds (Perez et 

al., 2010).

Body dimensions of pregnant women measured by the segmental girths show 

that thigh (Perez et al., 2010; Piperata et al., 2002), hip and calf girths (Piperata et al., 

2002) significantly increase during pregnancy. Also between the 2nd and the 3rd 

trimesters there are an increase of body fat areas of the mid-thigh and calf and of the 

total fat mass (Perez et al., 2010). 

The influence of body segment parameters in the estimation of inverse 

dynamics solutions have been investigated by some studies conducted in the last 

decade (Ganley &amp;amp; Powers, 2004; Rao, Amarantini, Berton, &amp;amp; Favier, 2006; Silva &amp;amp; 

Ambrósio, 2004). However, it is not known the influence of body composition and 

morphologic changes on woman’s biomechanical parameters of gait during pregnancy 

and in postpartum period.  

 Objectives  

The purpose of this study was to quantify maternal anthropometric and body 

composition changes throughout pregnancy and in the postpartum period, and to 

identify the contribution of these parameters on the lower limb joints kinetic during gait.

 Data Collection and Processing  

Data were collected at the Laboratory of Biomechanics and Functional 

Morphology of the Faculty of Human Kinetics in four periods: at gestational age of 

14.2±2.4weeks, at 27.3±1.0weeks, and at 36.3±0.9weeks and in the postpartum period 

at 20.6±5.2 weeks. 

The anthropometric variables collected were body weight, height, six skinfolds 

(subscapular, triceps, biceps, iliac crest, front thigh and medial calf); four girths 

(abdominal, gluteal, mid-thigh and calf) and; three breaths (biiliocristale, thoracic and 

biacromial). All anthropometric data were measured according to the International 

Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK) standardized measurement 

protocol (Stewart et al., 2011), with exception for abdominal girth, which was measured 

2cm below belly button (navel), and the thoracic breadth, which was measured at the 

level of the last rib. Data were collected by ISAK certified anthropometrists. Based on 

these measurements, other variables were calculated, including body weight gain in 

each trimester by reference to pre-pregnancy body weight (self-reported by pregnant in 

a specific questionnaire form); the body density and the percentage of fat mass (Durnin 

&amp;amp; Womersley, 1974), muscle and fat areas of the thigh and lower leg (Frisancho, 

2011); the body fat and fat-free mass; the biiliocristale-acromiale and abdominal-gluteal 

ratio and BMI. 

Kinematic and kinetic parameters were collected through 12 infrared high-speed 

cameras (Oqus-300, Qualisys, Sweden) at a rate of 200Hz, and 3 force platforms (2 

Kistlers - Kistler AG, Winterthur, Switzerland; and 1 AMTI force plate - Advanced 

Mechanical Technology, Inc., Watertown), at a rate of 1000Hz. Spherical reflective 

markers were placed on the skin in lower limb segments with double-sided adhesive 

tape at predefined locations according to recent recommendations (Hamill et al., 2014). 

Kinetic and kinematic data were synchronized to the same file through software 

Qualisys Track Manager (QTM; Qualisys AB, Gothenburg, Sweden). Data were 

collected during 3 non-consecutive minutes walking at a comfortable speed and were 

considered the last 4 cycles performed by each participant. The procedures were fully 

described in a previous paper (Branco et al., 2013; Branco et al., In press). 

 Statistical Analysis 

The statistical procedures were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics 22

repeated measures analysis, was performed the Friedman test. To development the 

prediction models was used the linear regression with the enter method. Only one 

predictor variable can enter this technique because of the sample size (Stevens, 2009). 

 Results 

 Anthropometric and body composition profile 

The anthropometric and body composition profile of the women during 

pregnancy and in postpartum is described in Table 12 and Table 13.  

All anthropometric variables were significantly influenced by pregnancy, with 

exception for mid-thigh girth and biiliocristal-biacromial ratio. 

Although the bioacromial breath was significantly different between the 1st and 

the 3rd trimester and from the 1st trimester and postpartum, the biiliocristal breath was 

only significantly different from the 1st trimester and the 3rd trimester (an increase of 

1.5cm, P?0.001); thus, no significant differences (P&gt;0.05) were observed for 

biiliocristal-biacromial ratio (Table 12). 

The thoracic breadth shows changes between all pairs of collection phases, 

with exception for the 1st trimester and postpartum, increasing 2.6cm from the 1st to the 

3rd trimester, and decreasing the same value from late pregnancy to postpartum. 

The abdominal girth shows a mean increase throughout pregnancy of 16.5cm 

and a significant decrease of 14.7cm from 3rd trimester to postpartum. The gluteal girth 

also shows significant increases of 3.1cm and 4.3cm from 1st to 2nd and 3rd trimesters, 

and a significant decrease of 3.2cm from late pregnancy to postpartum. The calf girth 

only shows a significant increase of 1.1cm from early to late pregnancy. Only mid-thigh 

girth has no changes in any of the phases observed. 

The subscapular and biceps skinfolds shows a significant increase of 

respectively 1.9mm and 0.3mm from 1st to 3rd trimester, without changes from 3rd 

trimester to postpartum. The triceps skinfold increases its size from 1st, 2nd and 3rd 

trimester to postpartum, respectively 3.8mm, 2.5mm and 3.7mm. The Iliac crest, front 

thigh and calf skinfolds have no changes throughout pregnancy and postpartum. The 

sum of the skinfolds shows a significant increase of 6.0mm from 1st to 3rd trimester, 

without other changes throughout pregnancy and for postpartum period, and the 

relative value of fat mass shows no changes during pregnancy and in the postpartum 

period.

Body mass (p?0.01) and weight gain (p?0.02) showed a significant increase 

throughout pregnancy and a significant decrease from the 3rd trimester to postpartum 

period (p?0.01 and p?0.02, respectively; Table 3). In accordance with the 

recommendations of the Subcommittee on Nutritional Status and Weight Gain During 

Pregnancy of the Committee on Nutritional Status During Pregnancy and Lactation, 

Institute of Medicine, our participants demonstrated a normal BMI (BMI ?19.8 to 

26.0kg/m2) during the first two trimesters and in the postpartum period, and overweight 

in the last trimester (BMI&gt;26.0 to 29.0kg/m2). On the other hand, during pregnancy 

average weight gain was within the mean values, increasing the recommended values 

between each trimester, specifically 2kg by the end of the 1st trimester, plus 5kg 

between 1st and 2nd trimester, and plus 5kg between the 2nd and 3rd trimester (Institute 

of Medicine and National Research Council of the National Academies, 2009).  

Only the segmental areas of the calf were affected by pregnancy. The muscular 

area of the calf had a significant increase of 4.2cm2 from the 1st to the 3rd trimester and 

a significant decrease of 3.9cm2 from the 3rd trimester to the postpartum period. The fat 

area of the calf also increased significantly from the 1st to the 3rd trimester and for the 

postpartum, respectively of 2.4cm2 and 2.6cm2. The paired comparisons of the total 

area of the thigh increased significantly 14.5cm2 and 16.4cm2, respectively from the 1st 

to the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. The muscular and fat areas of the thigh did not show any 

changes throughout pregnancy and postpartum.

As expected, women’s fat mass and free-fat mass weight were influenced by 

the stage of pregnancy or postpartum. Body fat increased between the 1st to the 2nd 

and the 3rd trimesters, respectively 2.9kg and 3.7kg, decreasing for the end of 

pregnancy to postpartum in 2.1kg. The free-fat mass was significantly increased in 

6.1kg between the 1st and the 2nd trimester and in 3.5kg through the end of the 

pregnancy. After delivery this variable showed a significant decrease, when compared 

to the values of the 2nd and 3rd trimesters, in 3kg and 6.6kg respectively.  

The abdominal-gluteal ratio shows changes throughout pregnancy and in 

postpartum period. No changes were found between the 1st trimester and the 

postpartum. No significant changes were observed in the biiliocristal-biacromial ratio 

during this study. In every collection phases, acromial-iliac index showed greater 

values than 0.76, which means that during pregnancy and for postpartum period,

women keeps a trunk with a rectangular shape (Guedes &amp;amp; Guedes, 2006). BMI 

increased 3.7kg/m2 from the 1st to the 3rd trimester and decreased 3.1kg/m2 from the 

late pregnancy to the postpartum period. 

The joints moment and power used for the calculation of the regression models 

are shown in Table 14.

The kinetic variables under study are described more deeply in the previous 

chapter, however were considered for this study, those whose changes were identified 

as affected by the stage of pregnancy. Regarding GRF only the vertical component of 

the 3rd peak showed the influence of the stage of pregnancy or postpartum. In the joint 

moments were considered the 2nd peak of the ankle and the 1st and 2nd peak of the hip 

in the sagittal plane, and the 1st peak of the hip joint in the transverse plane. For the 

joint powers were considered the 2nd peak of the knee and hip joints in the sagittal 

plane, and the 1st peak of the hip joint in the transverse plane. 

 

 Regression models for joint moments 

The building of predictive models for the kinetic parameters through 

anthropometric variables can provide additional information about the dynamics of the 

internal load in pregnant women. The relationships between anthropometric variables, 

and the knee and hip joints moment in the sagittal plane were found in three cases, 

which are given in Table 15.

peak of the hip joint moment in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, and explains 38% of its 

variability.

In the 3rd trimester, 53.4% of the variability of the 2nd peak of hip joint moment 

can be significantly explained by the free-fat mass weight (p&lt;0.01). In the postpartum 

period, the body weight loss is a significant predictor (p&lt;0.05) of the 2nd peak of the hip 

joint moment and explains 29.6% of its variability.

In Table 16 are presented the regression models to predict joint moments in the 

transverse plane. The hip joint moments in 2nd trimester are significantly predicted by 

percentage of body fat (p&lt;0.05). This model explains 33.3% of the variability of the hip 

joint moment.

The hip joint moments for 3rd trimester, are significantly predicted by body mass 

index (p&lt;0.05), by calf fat area (p&lt;0.05), and by thigh fat area (p&lt;0.05). These models 

explain respectively 29.6%, 31.6% and 32.4% of the variability of the hip joint moments 

in transverse plane. 

 Regression models for joint powers 

The performed analysis found several regression models that allow predicting 

the joint powers for the four phases from body composition variables. In the sagittal 

plane only the knee and hip present prediction models regarding the four phases 

studied (Table 17). The relation between anthropometric variables and the joint power 

peaks are represented in Figure 14.

In the 1st trimester, the power of the knee joint is significantly predicted in 65% 

of its variability by body weight gain (p?0.01).  

 

Figure 14. Scatter plots and regression lines of joint power predictive models. 

In the 2nd trimester, thigh fat area is a significant predictor of the hip joint 

power, which explains 32.8% of the total variability. The free-fat mass weight is a 

significant predictor of the hip joint power in the 3rd trimester and in the postpartum 

period, explaining respectively 46.8% and 66.9% of the total variability of the hip joint 

power. 

In the transverse plane, the analysis has found regression models only for the 

hip joint, for the 3rd trimester of pregnancy (Table 18).

 Discussion 

This study first objective was to assess and quantify women’s anthropometric 

and body composition changes during pregnancy and in the postpartum period. In spite 

of the small size of the sample, this was a longitudinal study that is in consensus with 

others longitudinal studies conducted during pregnancy (Berggren, Presley, Amini, 

Hauguel-de Mouzon, &amp;amp; Catalano, 2015; Widen et al., 2015). In general, body 

composition variables showed an increase throughout pregnancy and a reduction from 

late pregnancy to the postpartum period. Nevertheless, most of these variables did not 

differ between the 1st trimester and postpartum, with exception for body weight loss, 

which is significantly lower after delivery than in the 1st trimester (p=0.012).  



Chapter 5 – Influence of body composition changes on kinetics

During pregnancy several physiological modifications occur in the pregnant 

woman’s body in order to guarantee mother’s energy needs and health and to support 

foetus growth and development (Andres et al., 2015; Berggren et al., 2015; Silva &amp;amp; 

Bellotto, In press). In fact, maternal body composition has been one of the most studied 

parameters, but there is a lack of studies that relate it to the kinetic parameters of gait 

during pregnancy. 

In our study, both weight gain and the body mass index were affected by 

pregnancy with significant increases during pregnancy (Widen et al., 2015) and 

significant decreases to postpartum period, as in recent studies (Gunderson et al., 

2015). The variation of the mean weight gain, and weight gain between trimesters 

remained within the ranges indicated for the BMI of the participants before pregnancy 

(Institute of Medicine and National Research Council of the National Academies, 2009; 

Silva &amp;amp; Bellotto, In press; Widen et al., 2015). It has been highlighted that maternal fat 

gains are associated with important implications for maternal and offspring health and 

with a greater postpartum fat retention in the mother (Widen et al., 2015). In addition, 

the maternal body weight gain may also interfere with important kinetics parameters of 

gait, as observed in our results of gait’s kinetics parameters. 

In another recent study (Berggren et al., 2015) to determine women’s metabolic 

profile, 21 healthy women were evaluated: 11 at preconception, during pregnancy and 

one year postpartum, and 10 had no interval pregnancy, so were assessed at baseline 

and a one year after. Weight, fat-free mass (kg), fat mass (kg) and the percentage of 

body fat were assessed by hydrodensitometry. Significant differences (p&lt;0.05) were 

observed for weight and fat-free mass from preconception [59.7 (53.5–85.6)kg and 

42.5 (39.0–49.2)kg, respectively] to pregnancy [77.2 (62.9–94.3)kg and 54.7 (46.7–

57.5)kg, respectively]. In contrast, no significant differences were observed in 

preconception versus postpartum for these two variables, as well as no significant 

differences (p&gt;0.05) were observed in body fat according to body size and in the 

percentage of body fat between preconception [20.7 (13.7–37.4)kg and 30.0 (24.1–

43.8)%] and pregnancy [24.2 (14.9–38.7)kg and 30.6 (24.8–40.2)%] and between 

pregnancy and postpartum [18.4 (13.8–41.3)kg and 29.3(25.2–46.2)%]. Similar results 

with ours in the postpartum period were observed for fat-free mass [44.3 (38.8–

49.6)kg], body fat according to body size [18.4 (13.8–41.3)kg] and the percentage of 

body fat [29.3 (25.2–46.2)%]. 

The biiliocristal breadth has a significant increase of 1.5cm between the 1st and 

the 3rd trimester and, although there is a reduction in late pregnancy to the postpartum

period, this is not significant, which may suggest that the distance between the iliac 

bones remains after pregnancy. 

As expected, abdominal and the gluteal girths suffered major changes 

throughout pregnancy; however these variables recovered in the postpartum to values 

similar to those found in early pregnancy. The calf girth increased 1.1cm from the 1st to 

the 3rd trimester as Perez et al. (2010) found. These authors also found changes in the 

mid-thigh girth, which was not demonstrated in this study. 

Although the sum of skinfolds showed a significant increase between the 1st and 

3rd trimester of pregnancy, mainly caused by subscapular, triceps and biceps skinfolds, 

only the triceps skinfold presented a significant increase of almost 4mm throughout 

pregnancy to the postpartum period. In spite of no significant changes were observed 

in the fat mass percentage, the accumulation of fat mass seems to happen mostly at 

the upper region of the trunk and upper limbs, keeping or increasing their thickness in 

the postpartum period. In addition, relatively to fat mass weight, significantly increases 

from the 1st to the 2nd trimester and from the 2nd to the 3rd trimester of pregnancy were 

showed. After delivery, the fat mass weight decreases, showing a recovery to levels 

similar to the first stage of pregnancy. In the same way, the free-fat mass weight 

increases during pregnancy, which may be related to the increase of the tissues and 

fluids associated with pregnancy itself and also for the weight of the foetus, and 

decrease again in the postpartum period. 

The bi-compartmental assessment of body composition of the lower limbs can 

be observed by the total, muscle and fat areas of the thigh and calf. Perez et al. (2010) 

have found increases in the thigh fat area and further in calf fat area, between the 2nd 

and the 3rd trimester. In this study, only the total area of the thigh showed significant 

changes, increasing 14.5cm2 and 16.4cm2 respectively from the 1st to the 2nd and from 

the 2nd to the 3rd trimesters of pregnancy. In the calf segment, significant increases 

were found throughout pregnancy, both for fat and muscle areas, but only the last 

variable decreases in postpartum period. 

The abdominal-gluteal ratio, shows the volume distribution between the lower 

torso and the pelvic region. Throughout pregnancy it changes so that in late pregnancy 

the distribution of the volume of the abdomen (mainly anterior) and the volume of the 

hips (mainly posterior) is the same. The biiliocristal-biacromial ratio do not shows 

significant changes, meaning that during pregnancy the woman keep a rectangular 

trunk shape (Guedes &amp;amp; Guedes, 2006).

In the 3rd trimester, the regression models to predict relative GRF of women 

shows that higher ratio between iliocristal and acromial breadth have an increased 

magnitude in the 3rd peak of vertical GRF. 

After application of the linear regression technique for predicting women's 

internal loading during pregnancy and in the postpartum period through anthropometric 

variables, twelve models were developed, of which four models include independent 

variables associated with the amount of fat; four models include independent variables 

related to overall body weight; three models include fat-free mass as a predictor 

variable and; a model includes the shape of the trunk as a predictor variable. A 

summary of the interaction between the anthropometric variables and the joint kinetic 

variables of the lower limb, in the four studied stages, are represented in Figure 13 and 

Figure 14. 

In the 1st trimester of pregnancy, a higher body weight gain lead to an increased 

production of mechanical energy of the knee extensors during the mid-stance phase. In 

the 2nd trimester the regression models allow to predict that a greater abdominal-gluteal 

ratio and a higher percentage of body fat have respectively an increased participation 

of the extensors and external rotators of the hip, during the loading response phase. 

Also in this stage of pregnancy, a larger thigh fat area lead to less absorption of 

mechanical energy of the hip flexors during terminal stance phase. In the 3rd trimester, 

a higher body mass index and larger areas of fat of the calf and the thigh increased the 

participation of the hip external rotators during the loading response phase. In addition, 

a higher body weight gain, until this trimester, induce to a greater eccentric contraction 

of the hip external rotators also in this phase of walking cycle. A higher free-fat mass 

weight lead to a lower eccentric contraction of the hip flexors during the terminal 

stance, and a lower participation of the hip flexors during pre-swing phase. A higher 

weight of free-fat mass and a greater loss of body mass, in the postpartum period, 

leads respectively to a lower absorption of mechanical energy of the hip flexors during 

terminal stance phase, and to a lower participation of the same muscles during the pre-

swing phase. 

Considering the limitations on the use of simple linear regression techniques, it 

should be appreciated that the variability in the explanation of the models have 

relatively high levels in five of them, whose values are very close to or above 50%. The 

highest levels of explanation in the models variability occurred in the 1st trimester and in 

the postpartum period, during the phases of gait cycle, in which there is an increased 

support of the body in one lower limb. The reason to happen in the early period of 

pregnancy and in the postpartum may show that the neuromuscular system of the

woman is not prepared for morphological changes happening on her body. This 

information is relevant not only for the pregnant women, but also for Health and 

Physical Exercise Professionals  

 Conclusions 

The study about the influence of the anthropometry and body composition in 

internal loading of women during pregnancy and postpartum, had not been studied yet. 

This study showed significant changes during pregnancy, regarding the variables 

associated with global body composition. The absolute amount of fat increased 

significantly to the end of pregnancy, especially by the contribution of the adipose 

tissue accumulated in the upper limbs and upper trunk. Regarding to the relative values 

of fat, there were no changes during pregnancy and to the postpartum period. 

The shape of the trunk in a frontal perspective, the free-fat mass and the weight 

gain/loss appeared as major predictors of the joint kinetics of women throughout 

pregnancy and in the postpartum. Most of the variables related to the amount of fat are 

predictors of the muscles involved in motor actions of the transverse plane. Most of the 

developed models were used to predict muscle participation involving the hip joint in 

the sagittal and transverse planes of motion, emphasizing that this joint is the one that 

is under greater influence of anthropometric variables. 

The body weight gain/loss was the variable that most explained the mechanical 

energy of the lower limb joints, showing that had the most important role in the muscle 

contractions’ dynamics, especially in the 1st and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy. 

The morphological changes that occur during pregnancy had greater influence 

in internal load involving the hip. 

Although, due to the sample size, regression models had only one predictor 

variable; the explanation indices of the models (adjusted r squared) were quite high, 

indicating that body composition and pregnant morphology changes during pregnancy, 

largely determining the kinetic dynamics of the female joints in this particular stage of 

life.  

Monitoring maternal’s body composition during pregnancy and kinetic 

parameters of gait is difficulty, but of great importance, especially in the 3rd trimester. 

It is recommended for further studies the increase of the sample to allow 

regression models with more variables, not only including the anthropometric and body 

composition parameters, but also physical activity before and during pregnancy.

 General Discussion and Conclusions 

Biomechanics has its major intervention not only in the description and analysis 

of human movement, but also in the quantitative assessment through technologically 

advanced instruments (in order to enable reliable data) and methods that use models 

of the biological systems under analysis. These models involve the development of a 

mathematical representation of the biomechanical system (Knudson, 2007), and have 

the objective to increase knowledge and insight about reality (Nigg &amp;amp; Herzog, 2007). In 

the studies included in the present thesis, the biomechanical evaluation aimed at the 

analysis of the musculoskeletal system and see if there were changes in the internal 

load of the structures of the lower limbs, during a walking task of women throughout 

pregnancy and in the postpartum period. 

Walking is a fundamental motor skill, whose maturity happens during childhood 

(Gabbard, 2004). Throughout life, the variations and the different situations where this 

skill is used allow to sustain that the biomechanical changes found during pregnancy 

are due to this condition and not for the possible inadequacies of the evaluated motor 

task. Problems related to locomotion constitute a major area of focus for many 

biomechanists (Robertson et al., 2014), especially in special populations, such as 

pregnancy, where the quantification of biomechanical parameters constitute a source 

of information for different purposes, whether for clinical or exercise professionals. 

The anthropometric assessment of women is usually performed, especially 

when there is a possibility of becoming pregnant. During the reproductive period of the 

woman, the anthropometric assessment allows to evaluate the ability to deal with the 

physiological stress of pregnancy, and during pregnancy it allows to identify the 

nutritional status of women and, indirectly, the growth of the fetus (WHO, 1995). Of the 

main changes experienced by pregnant, the morphological adaptations are those that 

are more visible, and since these are changes that take place in an individualized 

manner for each woman, it is considered as organismic constraints (Bartlett, 2007; 

Newell, 1986). The organismic constraints are mainly biomechanical because they are 

related to a given individual’s body characteristics, which affects movement responses 

to the task and environmental constraints (Bartlett, 2007). The visible changes that 

happen in a woman's body during pregnancy and returning to happen in the 

postpartum period, have been the reason to investigate the body mechanics of women, 

especially the load dynamics, and respective movement responses that these changes 

trigger (e.g., Branco et al., In press; Foti et al., 2000). In order to increase the

89 

knowledge in these fields of study, which arises from changes caused since the 

beginning of pregnancy to the postpartum period, several objectives have been 

established (chapter 1).  

To have a better overview of the available evidence on the biomechanical 

adaptations of gait that occur throughout pregnancy and in postpartum, a systematic 

review was performed (chapter 2). The research conducted showed that there is a 

scarcity of studies covering a longitudinal experimental design, and the biomechanical 

changes arising from pregnancy are few, considering all the variables under study. 

Most studies are focused in the comparisons between the 2nd and 3rd trimester, or 

between 3rd trimester and postpartum. 

Regarding the kinematical analysis of gait during pregnancy and postpartum a 

descriptive and inferential analysis of the temporal and spatial parameters of gait, and 

of the angular kinematics were performed (chapter 3). According to previous  studies, 

most results of temporal and spatial parameters point that the pregnant woman has a 

greater need to promote their body stabilization, while performing shorter and wider 

steps, and have a longer time in double support phase (Branco et al., 2013; Carpes et 

al., 2008; Forczek &amp;amp; Staszkiewicz, 2012; W. Gilleard, 2013; Hagan &amp;amp; Wong, 2010; 

Lymbery &amp;amp; Gilleard, 2005). Even the results of our temporal and spatial data do not 

corroborate that, because we did not obtain any significant changes, this is a subject 

which has been repeatedly approached by other authors (W. Gilleard, 2013; Lymbery &amp;amp; 

Gilleard, 2005), and probably requires an individualized analysis in the future. Based 

on these results we answer to part of the first experimental question and fulfill the first 

objective outlined. 

Based on the kinematic results found in chapter 3, the pelvis is one of the 

segments which features change since the early stages of pregnancy. This was not 

found in any of the previous studies, for two main reasons: the first reason is because 

most studies did not analyze the pregnancy period since its beginning, and the second 

reason is because the studies that included the beginning of pregnancy, did not 

consider this variable. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that the anterior tilt and 

the right lateral elevation of the pelvis, take place during the second and third 

trimesters of pregnancy. Moreover, it seems that these changes are derived from the 

increase in abdominal volume and an increase of the fetal weight, which achieves 40% 

of his final weight until the end of the second trimester, and the remaining during the 

third trimester (Whitcome et al., 2007). Although in the literature is found a reduction in 

anterior tilt of the pelvis between the third trimester and the postpartum (Foti et al., 

2000), or between the group of non-pregnant women (Branco et al., 2013), this was not 



Chapter 6 – General discussion and conclusions

 

 
90 

seen in our results, which allows us to state that is after the sixth month postpartum 

that the woman diminishes the anterior tilt. In addition to these variables, in late 

pregnancy the women show a decrease of the right lateral fall of the pelvis, when 

compared with the postpartum period. The changes of lateral elevation and fall of the 

pelvis between trimesters may show an attempt to control the angular momentum of 

the trunk caused by the increase of its moment of inertia (W. Gilleard, 2013). These 

results show that the pelvis experiences a change in their mobility, without thereby 

influence the range of motion of this segment. 

The hip is the joint that suffers more changes, in the angular displacement 

(chapter 3), and also in regard to load dynamics (chapter 4) (Branco et al., 2013; 

Branco et al., In press; Foti et al., 2000). Considering the gait cycle, during the weight 

acceptance, the main changes are related to the dynamics of hip internal loading. 

Specifically, during the loading response phase between the first and second trimester 

women increases the absorption of mechanical energy of the hip external rotators, and 

in the third trimester decreases the hip extension moment, increasing again in the 

postpartum period to higher values than those found in early pregnancy. These 

changes may put into question the stability of the hip, as the weight of transition from 

one support to another needs to have well-established all possible points of instability, 

like segments and joints (Los Amigos Research Education Institute Inc et al., 2001), 

especially those in kinetic path (pelvic girdle and lower limbs). Evidence for an attempt 

to improve the stabilization of the hip, is visible during the acceptance of the woman's 

weight in the second trimester by increasing absorption of mechanical energy of the 

external rotators. However, by the end of pregnancy this does not happen, not only 

because previous result does not occur, but also because there is a decrease in 

moment extension, which could indicate an increased instability of the hip. This 

instability during the transition of the weight from one foot to the other, will make that in 

the beginning of the single support (mid-stance phase) there is an increase of the hip 

extension moment, from the first to the second and third trimesters, allowing us to state 

that this phase and joint are the ones with a mechanical overload during pregnancy. 

The significant changes found in the hip during terminal stance phase are mainly 

kinematics, where among all collection stages, continuously occurs an increased 

internal rotation of the hip. These results may point to an attempt to stabilize the knee 

due to a weakness of the quadriceps, which can be evidenced by a decrease in the 

absorption of mechanical energy of the hip flexors in late pregnancy, or may be a result 

of hypertonicity of the muscles responsible for this motor action, affecting the 

progression of body and limb clearance (Los Amigos Research Education Institute Inc 



Chapter 6 – General discussion and conclusions 

 

 
91 

et al., 2001). Also in single limb support, but in the pre-swing phase, there is a 

progressive decrease of the hip extension throughout the pregnancy. This effect is 

surpassed in the postpartum period, where the hip extension returns to values similar 

to those found in the first trimester. Another consequence, of pregnancy in this gait 

phase, is the significant reduction of hip flexors moment, without thereby affecting the 

flexion of the hip in the stages of the swing limb advancement. In fact, there were no 

changes in the kinematics during initial swing phase, and during the mid-swing phase 

the woman performs a greater hip flexion as the pregnancy advances.  

Throughout the gait cycle, the only change in the knee during the stance is an 

increased production of mechanical energy of the knee extensors, seen in the first 

trimester compared to postpartum. In swing phase, there are two kinematic changes. 

The first change happens in the initial swing phase, where the magnitude of the 

maximum flexion peak is higher in the second trimester than at the beginning of 

pregnancy, explaining the greater flexion of the hip in mid-swing phase; and the second 

change, on which the magnitude of the knee flexion is lower in the second trimester, 

probably in an attempt to decrease the time in single support of contralateral limb. This 

was not verified in our results, but it was reported in the studies of Carpes et al. (2008) 

and Foti et al. (2000).  

Most of the changes in the ankle joint occur during the single limb support, 

especially at kinetic level, pointing to a lower mechanical load around this joint. This 

lower mechanical load is reflected by a decrease in the plantarflexors moment at the 

end of pregnancy, indicating a greater care in the advancement of pregnant body, and 

in the postpartum an increase of this variable to values similar at early pregnancy 

highlight the influence that pregnancy has on joint kinetics. The greater care in body 

advancement seems to be associated with a lower ability to stabilize the ankle joint, 

revealed by a significant a decrease of mechanical energy absorption of the ankle 

abductors from early pregnancy to the second and third trimester. The kinematic 

changes take place in the pre-swing and initial swing, with a decrease in ankle 

inversion in late pregnancy, which further increases in the postpartum period. This 

inversion of the ankle is usually associated with lower ankle stabilization, confirmed in 

another level by kinetic results. However, according to Los Amigos Research 

Education Institute Inc et al. (2001), the likely cause to increase this motor action is a 

lack of selective control of pretibials and a plantarflexion contracture, especially during 

single limb support, a fact that our kinetic results also shows.

92 

Based on these results we can state that there are changes taking place 

specifically during pregnancy, thus responding to the first two experimental questions 

and fulfilling the second, third, fourth and fifth objectives outlined. 

The quantification of anthropometric, morphological and body composition 

changes of women throughout pregnancy, and the recovery of these parameters in the 

postpartum period have been mainly studied with the objective of quantifying the 

nutritional habits of pregnant (Berggren et al., 2015; Kopp-Hoolihan et al., 1999; 

Larciprete et al., 2003; Lopez et al., 2011; Perez et al., 2010; Soltani &amp;amp; Fraser, 2000), 

and has served as a health indicator both for the woman and fetus during pregnancy 

(Leddy et al., 2008; Silva &amp;amp; Bellotto, In press; Straughen et al., 2013; Tenenbaum-

Gavish &amp;amp; Hod, 2013), and both for the woman and the child after birth (Andres et al., 

2015; Gunderson et al., 2015; Piperata et al., 2002; Thame et al., 2007; Widen et al., 

2015). In chapter 5, the changes in women body composition are described. Much of 

the body size changes occur with significant increases between the first and third 

trimester, revealing the impact that pregnancy has on the woman's body during this 

event. Although the relative amount of fat do not show significant changes between any 

of the collection phases, the absolute values show significant increases of fat in late 

pregnancy, especially by the accumulated fat contribution of the skinfolds of the upper 

limbs, upper torso and in the amount of fat of the lower leg. These results are curious, 

considering that the proximal regions to pelvic girdle are the main zones for fat 

accumulation associated with the human female. However, during pregnancy these 

results suggest that the woman uses the fat stored in this region, to provide energy for 

the growth and development of the fetus. As we would expect throughout pregnancy 

the body mass gains and body mass index (BMI) increases significantly, and even 

when considering the end of pregnancy, the classification of these increases as within 

the normal range, in a detailed analysis we found that the BMG increases are lower 

than the recommendations in the first and second trimester, and in the last trimester 

these gains are higher than recommended (Institute of Medicine and National 

Research Council of the National Academies, 2009). This may point out the need of a 

careful control of the women's weight, maintaining the nutrient intake balanced during 

pregnancy and also a balance of caloric expenditure, in which the appropriate physical 

exercise may help. Overall, the morphology and body composition of the woman that 

had changes, happen consistently since the beginning of pregnancy. This answers to 

our third experimental question and meets the sixth objective.  

In addition to this quantification, was also traced the objective of evaluate the 

influence that these parameters have on the joint kinetics of woman in the different

93 

stages of pregnancy. With this intent, twelve models were developed, comprising four 

groups of independent variables: the amount of fat, the overall body weight, fat free 

mass and the shape of the trunk. 

From these models we can infer that higher body mass increased during the 

first trimester leads to an increased mechanical energy production of the knee 

extensors, showing that an excessive weight gain increase may lead to an increased 

mechanical loading of the knee. Similarly in the second trimester, higher values of the 

relative amount of fat and of the abdominal-hips girth ratio, point to an increased 

internal load of the hip, specifically in the hip joint extensor and hip external rotators 

moments. However, still at this stage of pregnancy, women with a higher thigh fat area 

tend to have a lower absorption of mechanical energy of the hip flexors. In the third 

trimester, increases of the body mass index, of the thigh and shank fat areas, and of 

the body weight gain leads to increases of the mechanical load of the hip joint. In 

contrast, increases of the free fat mass weight leads to decreases of the hip internal 

load. The two models developed in the postpartum period, show that with the increase 

in free fat mass weight and a greater body weight loss, there is a smaller hip flexors 

moment and a lower absorption of mechanical energy of the same muscles. Three 

major conclusions can be drawn from these results: first is that these models show that 

body composition induces changes mainly in the sagittal plane and transverse plane, 

however the models concerning the late pregnancy, mostly record changes in the 

transverse plane, showing that the measured body changes cause disruptions in the 

stability of the hip joint; the second conclusion is that most models show that with the 

increases of body composition there is an increase in internal load of hip joint; and the 

third conclusion is that the increase in internal load only occurs during pregnancy, while 

the models developed for the postpartum period show a decrease in mechanical load. 

These findings lead us to answer the fourth and final experimental question and to fulfill 

the seventh goal. 

 Recommendations for practice 

Based on information drawn from the results, some recommendations for 

exercise prescription can be developed in order to improve the wellbeing of women 

throughout pregnancy and allow better recovery after childbirth. The first 

recommendation is the development of joint stability. With the decrease in magnitude 

of several peaks of joint moments and powers in the three-dimensional perspective, the 

stability in the joints of the lower limb is threatened. Thus, the workout in instability is 

one of the practical recommendations that professionals of exercise and health should

take into account when they intervene with this population, in order to ensure the 

respective strengthening of musculotendinous structures in the different planes of 

motion.  

The second recommendation is to privilege calisthenics exercises in order to 

promote better adaptation to the growing increase in weight, and to improve whole 

body kinetic chains during movement.  

The third and final recommendation is to use exercises with simple limb support 

for development of unipedal balance, this is because most of the changes that occur in 

pregnant women are during the single limb support phase. Not forgetting that it also 

brings a decrease in the risk of falling, whose importance is evident for women. 

 Recommendations for Future Research 

This work brought new information to the scientific community, especially 

because it is a longitudinal study that comprehensively describes the joint 

biomechanics of women during pregnancy and postpartum, their anthropometric 

changes, and the relationship between these two matters.  

However, it is necessary to conduct new developments in the research with this 

special population. In the continuity of this work will be explored the introduction of 

different variabilities of walking, particularly with the addition of a light load which 

pregnant woman has to carry, and walking with transposition of obstacles, in order to 

better understand the changes that pregnancy will promote in the mechanics of lower 

limb joints. 

Other very important concern is the need to find new regression equations in 

order to determine with higher reliability the location of the right and left hip joint 

centers. Although the models of Bell et al. (1989; 1990) are widely used for this 

purpose with this population, the anterior tilt of the pelvis and the increased abdominal 

volume, certainly bring bias in the construction of biomechanical models of the 

pregnant woman. In the same line of study and with equal importance, is the 

measurement of body density of women, not only in late pregnancy but also to 

understand how this variable evolves throughout pregnancy in order to allow better 

prediction of biomechanical calculations. It should be remembered that the instruments 

normally used for this purpose raise ethical problems in its use with pregnant because 

there is some radiation involved, or be somewhat invasive. Also worthy of note for 

future research is the need to increase the sample size in longitudinal studies covering

95 

the participants before, during and after the pregnancy, so that it is possible to verify 

some results that are not common among studies. 

Besides the type of biomechanical analysis included in this study, the inclusion 

of new tools can bring other relevant information, such as electromyography and the 

measurement of the feet center of pressure, which can address issues that continue to 

be raised by the scientific community, especially in reference to muscle participation, 

and as regards of the limb support as pregnancy progresses and its influence on 

stability of their body. 

Another aspect that needs further investigation is how the physical exercise 

programs and the effect of physical activity levels of pregnant women have in their 

biomechanical load as the pregnancy progresses.

Introduction. During pregnancy women experience several changes in the body’s physiology, morphology, and hormonal system.
These changes may affect the balance and body stability and can cause discomfort and pain. The adaptations of the musculoskeletal
system due to morphological changes during pregnancy are not fully understood. Few studies clarify the biomechanical changes
of gait that occur during pregnancy and in postpartum period. Purposes. The purpose of this review was to analyze the available
evidence on the biomechanical adaptations of gait that occur throughout pregnancy and in postpartum period, specifically with
regard to the temporal, spatial, kinematic, and kinetic parameters of gait. Methods. Three databases were searched and 9 studies with
a follow-up design were retrieved for analysis. Results. Most studies performed temporal, spatial, and kinematic analysis. Only three
studies performed kinetic analysis. Conclusion. The adaptation strategies to the anatomical and physiological changes throughout
pregnancy are still unclear, particularly in a longitudinal perspective and regarding kinetic parameters.

1. Introduction

Pregnancy is a unique time in the life of women with many
changes that affect the musculoskeletal system [1]. Over
38 to 42 weeks, women experience several changes in the
body’s physiology, morphology, and hormonal system. These
changes are visible especially in increased weight and skeletal
alignment. Other less visible changes are the increased joint
laxity and change in the center of gravity. Altogether, these
changes affect the balance and body stability and can cause
discomfort and pain [2]. The displacement of the center
of gravity has been discussed over the years with different
statements. Some studies indicate that the center of gravity
(CG) moves upward and anteriorly, for example, Foti et al. [3]
and Rodacki et al. [4]. Other studies state that the CG shifts on
the upper and posterior direction (e.g., Fries and Hellebrandt
[5]). Whitcome et al. [6] evaluated the evolution of lumbar
lordosis in bipedal hominids, and the results elucidate that
the CG moves anteriorly until the fetus reaches 40% of
the expected final weight. From that moment, the woman

increases the lordotic adjustment which in turn enables the
control of the CG, but with greater biomechanical costs [3].

Hormonal changes in women are quite variable through-
out pregnancy. However, the hormone relaxin may have a
more decisive role in the mechanics of movement, as it
provides greater ligament laxity in the pelvis and on the
peripheral joints [2, 7, 8]. The concentration peak of relaxin
occurs around the 12th week of gestation, which means that
there is enough time to act in osteoarticular structures until
the end of pregnancy.

One of the aspects that most influences the musculoskele-
tal system is the increase in maternal weight. When weight is
in excess it may cause several adverse maternal effects, includ-
ing gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, difficulties
during labor, weight retention in postpartum, and subsequent
maternal obesity with the risk for unsuccessful breastfeeding
[9]. The ideal weight gain during pregnancy is related to the
women’s weight or body mass index (BMI) before pregnancy.
The weight gain may range between 12.5 Kg and 18 Kg for
women under weight (BMI&amp;lt;18.5); between 11.5 Kg and 16 Kg
for women with normal weight (18.5 ?BMI &amp;lt;25); between

7 Kg and 11.5 Kg for women who are overweight (25?BMI&lt;
30); and between 5 Kg and 9 Kg for obese women [9]. The
weight gain during pregnancy is related to several factors,
such as the amount of blood, the increased volume of the
breasts, and the increased fat mass and extracellular fluid
[6]. The fetal tissues, the placenta, and the amniotic fluid are
related to the weight gain of the fetus [9].

A strategy to control weight gain during pregnancy is by
performing structured or recreational physical activity. The
guidelines for exercise prescription of the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend aerobic exer-
cise consisting of activities that use large muscle groups in
a continuous, rhythmic manner [1]. Walking emerges as a
highly recommended physical activity for pregnant women.
Walking is one of the movements most commonly performed
by people in the day-to-day tasks and it is easy to control
exercise intensity.

When performing motor tasks such as walking, the adap-
tations of the musculoskeletal system due to morphological
changes during pregnancy are not fully known. Few studies
clarify the biomechanical changes of gait that occur during
pregnancy and in postpartum.

The purpose of this review was to analyze the available
evidence on the biomechanical adaptations of gait that
occur throughout pregnancy and in postpartum, specifically
with regard to the temporal, spatial, kinematic, and kinetic
parameters of gait.

2.1. Eligibility Criteria. The review was limited to studies
meeting the following eligibility criteria: (1) healthy pregnant
women with no history of foot, ankle, knee, musculoskele-
tal or neuromuscular trauma, or disease; (2) women aged
between 20 and 40 years; (3) studies performed in the last
14 years; (4) studies performed by means of optoelectronic
systems, image analysis, force platforms, and others; (5)
outcome measures related to biomechanical variables of
gait, including spatial (stride length, step length, and stride
width), temporal (single and double support time), kinematic
(velocity and cadence), and kinetic (ground reaction forces,
joint moment, and joint power) parameters; (6) study design
including cross-sectional, follow-up, quasi-experimental tri-
als, and randomized controlled trials.

2.2. Information Sources. The studies were identified by
searching three databases—ScienceDirect, PubMed, and
SciELO—from January 2000 to August 2014. In addition,
reference lists of identified studies were also scanned. Studies
published in English, Portuguese, Spanish, or French were
scanned. Only published full papers were included. Unpub-
lished data, books, conference proceedings, or academic
theses were not included.

2.3. Search Strategy and Study Selection. The search was
performed using the following keywords in English: (1)
gait/walking; (2) pregnancy/pregnant; and (3) biomechan-
ics/kinetics/kinematics. These keywords were in first place
identified in the titles and in the abstracts. The study selection

was conducted in two stages. The first stage was the screening
of the titles and abstracts against the inclusion criteria to
identify relevant papers. The second stage was the screening
of the full papers to identify whether they met the eligibility
criteria.

2.4. Data Collection Process and Analysis. After screening
each paper, the following data were extracted: (1) study
design; (2) sample size; (3) age of the women; (4) gestational
phase of data collection; (5) outcome variables: spatial vari-
ables, temporal variables, kinematic variables, and kinetic
variables; (6) biomechanical instruments. The studies were,
therefore, described according to these characteristics and
outcome measures.

3. Results

3.1. Study Selection and Characteristics. The search yielded
741 articles from the three databases: ScienceDirect (711),
PubMed (28), and SciELO (2). After removing duplicate
articles 21 articles were considered for analysis. Articles were
then screened on the basis of title and abstract, with 16
excluded. After searching the reference lists of the selected
articles, 4 more articles were included. The remaining 9 full
papers were examined in detail, found to meet the inclusion
criteria, and then included in the review.

The characteristics of the studies included in the review
are presented in Table 1. All studies have follow-up design.
The sample sizes across the studies ranged from 2 [9] to
124 [7]. All studies reported the mean age and standard
deviation, except one [10]. Different studies used video-
based systems for kinematic analysis, except for two studies
that use optoelectronic systems [11, 12] and one that only
uses pedometers [7] to analyze the temporal and spatial
parameters. Only three studies report a kinetic analysis [10,
12, 13] and most studies provide an analysis of the kinematic,
spatial, and temporal parameters.

3.2. Outcome Measures: Spatial and Temporal Parameters.
The variables of stride length, step length, stride width,
base of support, and single and double support time are
the spatial and temporal parameters analyzed by the papers
reviewed. Most papers reviewed showed changes in spatial
and temporal parameters in late pregnancy, specifically, a
significant decrease in the length of the gait cycle [11, 13–
15], and in step length [11–14], and a significant increase of
the double support time [3, 11, 14]. Other studies showed a
significant reduction in the single support time [3, 14] and
a significant increase in step width [10, 15]. Forczek and
Staszkiewicz [12] also found a significant increase of the base
of support. Nevertheless, the remaining studies suggest that
pregnant women have the need to increase the body stability
and use the parameters listed above to meet those demands.

3.3. Outcome Measures: Joint Kinematics. The variables of
velocity (or speed) and cadence are the kinematic parameters
analyzed by the studies included in the review. Most papers
reviewed showed changes in kinematic parameters in late

pregnancy, specifically, a significant decrease in speed [12, 13,
16] and a significant reduction in the gait cadence [12, 16].

The joint kinematics of the lower limb shows few changes
throughout pregnancy. The angular displacement of the
pelvis increases in the anterior tilt of approximately 5 degrees
[3, 13]. The joints of the lower limb in the sagittal plane show
an increase in hip flexion during stance phase [3, 11, 13], an
increase of knee flexion during the terminal stance phase
[14], a decrease of knee extension [11], and a decrease of
ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion [11, 13]. In the frontal
plane, Gilleard [15] found a reduction in the amplitude of the
unilateral elevation of the pelvis. The hip joint had different
results considering the two studies performed: Foti et al. [3]
found a peak with greater magnitude in the hip adduction;
Branco et al. [11] found a decrease of this peak.

3.4. Outcome Measures: Joint Kinetics. Few studies have
evaluated the kinetic parameters of gait during pregnancy

[10, 12, 13]. Foti et al. [3] analyzed the joint moments and
joint powers with and without normalizing the weight of
the women in late pregnancy. Although they found several
changes in these parameters without normalization, the
authors recommend the analysis with normalization [13]. The
analyses performed with normalized data found a significant
increase in the hip extensors moment [17] and a significant
decrease in the knee extensors moment [17] and in the ankle
plantarflexors moment [3, 17] in the sagittal plane. In the
frontal plane, there was an increase of the hip abductors
moment [3] and in the knee adductors moment [17].

4. Discussion

The purpose of this review was to analyze the available
evidence on the biomechanical adaptations of gait that occur
throughout pregnancy and in postpartum. Data from 9
follow-up studies were included in the analysis.



4 The Scientific World Journal

Women are subjected to various anatomical and physio-
logical changes throughout pregnancy. However, the adapta-
tion strategies that are pursued are still unclear [12]. Two of
the situations they face are, on the one hand, the reduction
of energy costs associated with gait and, on the other hand,
maximizing safety during the motor task. The later strategy
seems to be dominant because the increase in step width
is associated with a greater energy cost during walking
[18]. This parameter has great consistency between studies.
In addition, the development of pregnancy is associated
with a reduction in stride length, which together allow the
woman to have a larger base of support [12]. Another way
found by pregnant women to ensure greater body stability
is keeping their feet on the ground for a longer time during
the gait cycle and decreasing the single support time, which
seems to be also a strategy to support the increased weight
[3]. In fact, the medial-lateral instability of the women as
the pregnancy progresses is one result that seems to have
great importance among different types of biomechanical
parameters. However, so far the medial-lateral component of
the ground reaction forces shows no significant changes but
tends to be higher in late pregnancy [10]. This observation
requires further research.

Many of the biomechanical changes occur in the pelvis or
in adjacent joints. Although there are few kinematic changes
in late pregnancy, most of them are related to the angular
motion of the pelvis and the hip joint. The result with greater
emphasis between studies is the anterior tilt of the pelvis.
The position taken by the pelvis in late pregnancy seems to
be a consequence of the weight of the uterus, placenta, and
fetus placed on the anterior zone of the body and the weaker
capacity to produce force by the rectus abdominis. However,
the function of this anterior tilt and the increase of the lumbar
lordosis are related to the maintenance of the trunk in an
upright position [3]. The decrease in the range of motion
of the pelvis in the frontal and transverse planes suggests
that this may be a way to control the angular momentum
caused by the increase of the moment of inertia of the trunk
in late pregnancy [15]. These changes bring consequences
for the muscles attached to the pelvis, particularly a greater
participation of the abductors and extensors muscles of the
hip, which, combined with a higher stretch derived from
the anterior tilt of the pelvis, will contribute to lower back,
pelvis, hip, and sacroiliac pain [3, 17]. These types of pain
are also associated with a decrease in the participation of
the knee extensors and ankle plantarflexors [17]. The changes
in angular motion of the ankle may also be associated with
other issues of pregnant women, including a decrease of
dorsiflexion that is related to pain and higher probability to
trip and fall [13].

Limitations. The strength of this review is that a systematic
methodology was adopted to identify relevant studies on
the biomechanics of gait during pregnancy. However, the
review has some limitations. Articles published in languages
other than those mentioned above may have been excluded.
The search was performed only in peer-reviewed published
articles since 2000. There is a possibility of missing data
published previously or other unpublished data that were

not included in the analysis. The small sample sizes and
the different periods of data collection may have introduced
some bias in the analysis performed. The lack of studies
about this subject as well as the consistency of the outcome
measures is a major limitation to perform a meta-analysis.
Cautions should be taken when drawing conclusions about
gait adaptions throughout pregnancy, due to the limitations
mentioned above.

5. Conclusions

The evidence from this review suggests biomechanical adap-
tations of gait throughout pregnancy. Further research is
required using common outcome measures and standard
follow-up periods of data collection (weeks of gestation and
postpartum period). Most of the results presented in this
review are consistent between studies. However, there is a
great scarcity of studies addressing the gait biomechanics of
pregnant women in a longitudinal perspective. There is a
need to examine closely the kinematics of the woman while
walking considering the beginning of pregnancy, in order
to confirm the influence of morphological changes in the
angular motion of the lower limb segments during the course
of pregnancy.

Very few studies analyzed the kinetics of gait of pregnant
women. Nevertheless, these data are seen as essential to
understand the magnitude and implications of changes in
the welfare of women. In future research, there must be a
special focus on the analysis of moments and joint powers to
understand the changes in muscle participation and if there
are changes in the type of contraction during motor tasks.

It is not possible to understand the influence of mor-
phological changes, if body composition and anthropometric
variables are not quantified throughout pregnancy. Further
research is required to understand to which extent do these
variables influence the biomechanical parameters.

No studies were found addressing the effects of physical
activity, low back, and pelvic pain or maternal weight control
on the gait biomechanical adaptations of gait throughout
pregnancy and postpartum.

Three-dimensional kinematic adaptations of gait throughout
pregnancy and post-partum

Abstract:

Purpose
The kinematic analysis of gait during pregnancy provides more information about the anatomical changes and
contributes for exercise and rehabilitation prescription. The purposes were to describe and quantify the spatial,
temporal and kinematic parameters in the joints of the lower limb during gait at the end of the first, second and
third trimesters of pregnancy and in the postpartum period.

Methods
A three-dimensional analysis was performed in eleven pregnant women. Repeated measures ANOVA were
performed for comparisons between periods.

Results
The longitudinal effect of pregnancy was not observed in spatial and temporal parameters. In joint kinematics
the effect of pregnancy was observed in all joints for the three planes of motion. The hip joint and pelvis are the
structures with more changes, and the results point to an increase in the anterior tilt of the pelvis as the
pregnancy progresses, as well as a decrease of the amplitudes of the hip joint. The results suggested that
pregnant women need to maintain the stability of the body, and become more efficient in locomotion.

Conclusions
In general the results retrieve the values from the beginning of pregnancy, indicating that the body was self-
organized in order to overcome the morphological and physiological changes which women suffer during
pregnancy, indicating that they have the ability to adapt depending on the demands, and after the effect of
pregnancy is over, they return to values similar to those found in early pregnancy.

Introduction 

Pregnant women undergo various changes during pregnancy, including hormonal and 

morphological changes [1]. Although, these changes may lead to many complaints, discomfort 

and pain in lower limbs, it is unclear whether the biological, hormonal and morphologic a l 

changes lead to the modification of gait pattern. Few studies describe the temporal, spatial and 

kinematic motion on the lower limb of the pregnant women, particularly in a longitud ina l 

perspective. 

Foti, Davids [7] analyzed a set of gait three-dimensional (3D) kinematic parameter in 

15 women, from the 3t h trimester of pregnancy until one year postpartum. The overall results 

showed changes in the gait pattern of those women, comparing with a non-pregnant group. In 

the pregnant group gait pattern the amplitude of hip extension is decreased while the anterior 

pelvic tilt, hip flexion and hip adduction are increased. Regarding temporal parameters 

significant increases were found in double support time and significant decreases in single 

support time. In spatial parameters they found a significant increase for pelvic width and ankle 

separation. Lymbery and Gilleard [12] investigated the temporospatial and ground reaction 

forces (GRF) variables in the stance phase of walking on 13 women at 38 weeks’ gestation and 

8 weeks after birth. They concluded that in late pregnancy, there was a wider step width, and 

mediolateral GRF increasing in a medial direction. They suggested that women may adapt their 

gait to maximize stability in the stance phase of walking and to control mediolateral motion. 

Huang, Lin [10] compared the natural pattern of walking, tested once, in 10 pregnant women, 

divided into three groups (12, 13-28 and 29-40 weeks of gestation) with of control group of 10 

nulliparous. They reported significant differences between the pregnant and non-pregnant 

women, especially in knee abduction angle, knee and hip internal rotation angles. Also, as 

gestational age progress, the pregnant women showed increased in hip extension moment and 

knee adduction moment, and decreased in knee extension moment, and ankle plantar flexio n 

moment. According to these authors the hip is the main work-loading area, associated with an 

over stretch of the hip extensors, which are highly related with sacroiliac pain, caused by an 

easily fatigue of these muscles. 

Few studies analyzed gait kinematic changes throughout pregnancy, in each trimester 

of gestation, or associated the kinematic and kinetic variables for each phase of the gait cycle. 

In a previous study Branco, Santos-Rocha [4] found that the gait pattern of pregnant women

showed changes between second and third trimesters in such a way that the stride and right and  

left step lengths decreased, while double limb support time increased. Joint kinematics showed 

a significant decrease of right-hip extension and adduction during stance phase between 

trimesters. Also, an increase in left knee flexion and a decrease in right-ankle plantarfle xio n 

were found between trimesters. 

No studies were found performing a longitudinal analysis encompassing the three 

trimesters of pregnancy and the postpartum period, so that the changes that arising from 

pregnancy are not fully quantified. These leads us to wonder whether there are changes in 

kinematic parameters during pregnancy, and if so, are women able to recover to values close to 

those found in early pregnancy? 

The main objective of this study was to analyze the kinematic changes of gait as the 

pregnancy progresses. If these changes were confirmed, the second objective was to ascertain 

whether women can recover to the initial kinematic patterns in the postpartum period. The 

hypothesis tested is that the gait of pregnant women has changes in the kinematic parameters 

throughout their pregnancy, and women in postpartum period recover these parameters to 

values similar to those of early pregnancy. To achieve the main objective, it is necessary to 

describe the kinematic variables in the joints of the lower limb during gait at the end of the first, 

second and third trimesters of pregnancy and in the postpartum period.

Pregnant participants were recruited via direct contact and flyers placed in gym and 

health centers and have volunteered to participate in the study. None of the participants had 

contraindications to physical exercise. The study was approved by the ethical committee of the 

Faculty of Human Kinetics, University of Lisbon (FMH-UL) and all subjects gave written 

informed consent prior to the participation in the study. 

 

Data Collection and Processing 

Data were collected at the Laboratory of Biomechanics and Functional Morphology 

(FMH-UL) during the later stages of each trimester of pregnancy and once between the 4t h and 

the 6t h month after delivery. In each data collection session anthropometric and biomechanic a l 

data were recorded. The weight and height were measured according to the Internatio na l 

Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK) standardized measurement protocol 

[15] by ISAK certified anthropometrists. These anthropometric data were used to calculate the 

body segments mass and inertia moments.  

The biomechanical data were recorded while the subject walked barefoot a distance of 

10 m, between two points, in a straight line in both directions at a natural and comfortable 

speed, during 3 min. Participants were allowed to get familiar with the laboratory system and 

no fatigue occurrence was reported. The last four gait cycles performed by each participant 

were considered for the analysis. 

Markers setup were in agreement with the suggestion of Cappozzo, Cappello [5], for 

lower limb segments, and CODA (Charnwood Dynamics Ltd, Leicestershire, United Kingdom) 

protocols for model of the pelvis segment (Fig. 1). Pelvis model allows the estimation of the 

right and left hip joint center using the regression equation proposed by Bell, Brand [2] and 

Bell, Pedersen [3]. Planar motion of the hip, knee and ankle joint was calculated with Visual 

3D (V3D) software (C-Motion Inc., Germantown, USA) by a computational procedure 

implementing the dot product between the skeletal segments articulated by these joints.

lateral view with marker setup used in motion capture. 

 

Kinematic and kinetic data were collected by means of twelve infrared high-speed 

cameras (Oqus-300, Qualisys, Sweden; FR: 500 Hz), two Kistler force platforms (Kistler AG, 

Winterthur, Switzerland) and one AMTI platform (Advanced Mechanical Technology, Inc, 

Watertown), at a rate of 1000 Hz. The capture hardware was connected to Qualisys USB Analog 

Acquisition interface in order to synchronize kinetic and kinematic data with software Qualisys 

Track Manager (QTM; Qualisys AB, Gothenburg, Sweden). Both data sequences were 

recorded in the same file. The system was calibrated by wand type, with an exact wand length 

of 751.4 mm moved randomly across the recorded field, before the data collection of each 

participant. Calibration was accepted if the standard deviation of the wands length measures 

was below 0.5 mm. The cameras were positioned statically to minimize light reflection artifacts 

and to allow recording of at least two consecutive walking cycles, defined as the time between 

two consecutive initial ground contacts of the heel strike for each side.  

A three-dimensional analysis was performed including both sides of the body. The 

trajectory of the reflective markers was smoothed using a Butterworth low-pass filter with a 10 

Hz cut-off. Collected data were interpolated using a Cubic Spline Interpolation as suggested by 

Robertson, Caldwell [14], for a maximum of 10 frames gap, and filtered with a Butterworth 

digital low-pass filter, at 10 Hz cutoff frequency for kinematic and kinetic data, as suggested 

by Robertson and Dowling [13]. All data were normalized in time. 

Considering the four phases in analysis, kinematic pattern curves were estimated 

relative to the walking stride cycle. The gait cycles were selected based on both feet GRF data 

and the heel markers pattern recognition followed by correction when needed. The data curves 

and the peak angles values were estimated, for left and right sides, with Visual 3D software 

(V3D). Lower-extremity joint angles and spatial and temporal parameters during the walking 

gait cycle were calculated with use of V3D. 

In each trimester of pregnancy and in the postpartum period were considered a set of kinemat ic 

variables, which analyzed peaks are described in our previous study [4].

Statistical Analysis 

All statistical procedures were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics 22 software for 

Windows. Shapiro-Wilk normality tests were conducted and not assumed for all cases. The 

Mauchly’s test of sphericity was performed before Repeated Measures (RM) ANOVA analys is 

and sphericity was not assumed in all tests. For post-hoc tests, the Bonferroni test was used 

based on Student's t statistic, adjusting the observed significance level for the fact that multip le 

comparisons were made. When the data set did not commit the assumptions for the RM 

analysis, the Friedman test was performed, and for pairwise analysis the Wilcoxon test was 

performed. In this case, Bonferroni confidence interval adjustment was applied to allow an 

adjustment to the confidence intervals and significance values for multiple comparisons.  

 

Results 

Spatial and Temporal parameters 

The longitudinal effect of pregnancy was not observed in any spatial or temporal 

parameter (Table 2), regarding the results of the statistical tests.

hip joint have a significant increase of hip flexion from first to second and to third trimester s, 

and also from second and third trimesters to postpartum period, with values of flexion which 

are increased above five degrees at the end of pregnancy. In the segment of the pelvis, 

significant changes were verified between the first trimester, and the second and third 

trimesters, with an increase of 2.97 deg, 3.68 deg, 4.6 deg and 5.31 deg, respectively for first 

peak, and above 5 deg for second peak. Between the second and the third trimesters with 

postpartum period was seen a significant decrease in pelvic tilt of 4.6 deg and 5.31 deg, 

respectively, for the first peak. 

Frontal Plane 

In the frontal plane, it was found that pregnancy influences the angular values of the 

joints of the lower limbs (Fig. 3).

Difference units between trimesters are in degrees.  Bold values rep resent statistical differences. 

Changes between the first and third trimesters of pregnancy in the second and third peak 

of the ankle are subtle but significant, with an increase of 3 deg in ankle inversion for late 

pregnancy, and 2.45 deg between first trimester and postpartum period. The hip joint shows a 

slight decrease of 2 deg in hip adduction between first and third trimesters, and the segment of 

the pelvis are even more subtle, verifying a slight decrease of 0.61 deg of elevation on the right 

side between the first and second trimesters, and a slight increase of 0.22 deg between the first 

and third trimesters. 

Transverse Plane 

The statistical analysis of angular data, in the transverse plane, show that these are 

influenced by the stage of pregnancy in which the women are (Fig. 4).

Difference units between trimesters are in degrees.  Bold values rep resent statistical differences. 

The first peak of the hip joint in the transverse plane has a slight but significant increase 

in internal rotation of the thigh from the first to the second and third trimesters. However, from 

the second and third trimesters to postpartum, continues to be a significant increase, both 

increases are between two and three degrees of internal rotation of the hip. 

Discussion 

The main goal of this longitudinal study was to describe the changes on the gait 

biomechanical parameters throughout pregnancy and in postpartum period. The 3D analysis of 

kinematic parameters as well as of spatial and temporal parameters was performed. The 

hypothesis that these parameters are influenced by the course of pregnancy is rejected for the 

spatial and temporal variables during walking, and accepted for the kinematic variables in the 

three planes of motion. In our previous study [4] and in Foti, Davids [7] found higher values in 

the stride width and in the double support time for third trimester, when compared to the values 

found in the postpartum or in control group, respectively, and are largely influenced by the 

stage of pregnancy. However, even without significant changes in this study, the stride width 

was 1.4 cm larger in the third trimester than in early pregnancy, and decreases in postpartum, 

and the double support time also features the inverted U-shaped, with an increase of 0.17 

seconds between the first and the third trimesters and a decrease from the third trimester to 

postpartum of 0.20 seconds, which seems to point to the same behavior as the literature. A

possible explanation for discrepancies in the results between our study and literature may be 

due to sample size. 

The kinematic parameters in the three planes of motion are influenced by the 

progression of pregnancy, checking for deviations in several angular data of the lower limb 

joints. In the sagittal plane, the knee, hip, and the segment of the pelvis present the major 

changes during pregnancy. There are few studies in the literature that referred knee changes 

during pregnancy and postpartum. Our results are in line with Carpes, Griebeler [6] that found 

a significant increase in knee flexion in the terminal stance phase, and with our previous study 

[4]. We also found a decrease in knee extension during the end of swing phase, which may be 

the result of a lower participation of the knee extensors. This may be associated to back pain, 

specifically with sacroiliac pain, referred by pregnant women [10].  

The hip joint has been referenced in the literature as the joint where major changes occur 

in late pregnancy. In our study an increase of flexion of the hip during stance phase was found 

which is supported by previous studies [4, 7, 9], leaving effectively no peak of hip extension 

during pre-swing phase.  

The published results about the pelvis are consistent across the studies, showing an 

increased anterior tilt of five degrees throughout the gait cycle [7, 9]. In this study, in addition 

to assessing the significant increase in this anterior tilt, we discriminate that this increase occurs, 

between the first and second trimesters and remained similar between the second and third 

trimesters, as previously observed [4]. This pelvis position, seems to agree with the 

morphological changes already undertaken by pregnant women in the end of the second 

trimester, where there are an increase in abdominal volume and weight of the fetus that affects 

about 40% of its final weight [16], combined with a lower capacity for force production by 

rectus abdominis. However, Foti, Davids [7] states that the function of the anterior pelvic tilt, 

combined with an increase of lumbar lordosis is to keep the body in an upright position. After 

delivery, between the fourth and sixth months, there is a significant reduction in the pelvic 

anterior tilt angle similar to those found in the first trimester which seems to be an indicator of 

the recovery of the pelvis position in postpartum, also observed in the literature between 

pregnancy and the postpartum [4, 7, 9]. Regarding the sagittal plane, the results confirmed that 

the angular data show deviations associated with pregnancy and are recovered in the postpartum 

period.

In the frontal plane, there are influences of the stage of pregnancy on the angular data, 

revealing significant changes in the ankle, hip and pelvis segment. Few studies have examined 

the frontal plane changes. Gilleard [8] found a reduction in the amplitude of the unilater a l 

elevation of the pelvis. In this study, during the mid-stance, there was an increase of the 

magnitude of the fall of the pelvis from the third trimester to the postpartum period. During the 

toe-off, the pelvis shows a slight decrease in elevation between the first and second trimester s, 

and an increased elevation of the pelvis between the first and the third trimesters. Both results 

suggest that, in late pregnancy, the dynamic of the two angular peaks of the pelvis is related to 

the attempt to control the angular momentum of the trunk caused by the increase of its moment 

of inertia [8]. In the hip joint, this study showed a decrease in the hip adduction during the mid -

stance phase, between the first and third trimesters. In a previous study, [4] we found a similar 

results between the second and third trimesters and between pregnant and non-pregnant women. 

However, Foti, Davids [7] points to a contradictory result, showing an increase in hip adduction 

between participants at the end of pregnancy and one year after delivery. The ankle joint showed 

no changes in the frontal plane in the literature [4]. In this study, however, there are signific a nt 

changes in the pre-swing phase, with an increase of ankle inversion from the first to the third 

trimester and to the postpartum period, showing that this parameter does not recover and 

remains at least up to six months after delivery. The ankle inversion between the first and third 

trimesters keeps significantly increased until the mid-swing phase, showing that both stance as 

the swing phases of the pregnant woman are with an increased inversion of the foot during 

pregnancy. Since the changes only occur between the first and third trimester, and remain in 

the postpartum, justifies the fact that it has not been found in previous studies, which only 

studied women since the end of the second trimester. In the frontal plane, the hypothesis that 

the data show angular deviations associated with pregnancy, is accepted for the above variables. 

However, the hypothesis that these variables retake the values of early pregnancy is not 

accepted only for the inversion of the ankle, which keeps increased up to the postpartum period.  

The kinematic parameters in transverse plane remains largely unchanged during 

pregnancy and postpartum, however there is an increase in the hip internal rotation from the 

first to the second and to the third trimester. In the postpartum period there is a continuo us 

increase in internal rotation during the terminal stance phase. According to Los Amigos 

Research Education Institute Inc, Service [11], the internal rotation of the hip during the single 

support, is associated with an internal rotation contracture, femoral anteversion or an intent io n

to increase knee stability, leading to a toe-in position, hindering the forward advancement and 

may increase pressure on the lateral side of the knee joint. Regarding transverse plane, the 

hypothesis that the data show angular deviations associated with pregnancy, is rejected for most 

variables except for internal rotation of the hip. This variable, however, does not return the 

values of early pregnancy, rejecting that hypothesis, by remaining increased until the last 

moment of collection. 

 

Conclusions 

This study followed a descriptive longitudinal type design, in which pregnant women 

were assessed in the first, second and third trimesters of pregnancy and also in postpartum 

period. The gait analysis showed that pregnancy is a factor which influences the kinemat ic 

variables of the lower limb joints. The pelvis and hip joint are the segments that experience 

greater changes throughout pregnancy. Changes in the sagittal plane indicate that there is 

greater care in the anterior progression of the body. However the temporal and spatial data 

reveal no significant changes over the gait cycle. In the remaining planes of motion, there is 

less amplitude of motor actions, which seem to indicate greater constraints on movement. In 

general the results retrieve the values from the beginning of pregnancy, indicating that the body 

was self-organized in order to overcome the morphological and physiological changes which 

women suffer during pregnancy and that has the ability to adapt depending on the demands. 

Other questions are raised by these results, in particular if these kinematic changes bring an 

overload to the musculoskeletal system of the pregnant woman and its association with 

lumbopelvic pain.

Biomechanical adaptations that occur during pregnancy can lead to changes on gait pattern. Nevertheless, these adaptations of
gait are still not fully understood. The purpose was to determine the effect of pregnancy on the biomechanical pattern of walking,
regarding the kinetic parameters. A three-dimensional analysis was performed in eleven participants. The kinetic parameters in
the joints of the lower limb during gait were compared at the end of the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy and in the
postpartum period, in healthy pregnant women. The main results showed a reduction in the normalized vertical reaction forces,
throughout pregnancy, particularly the third peak. Pregnant women showed, during most of the stance phase, medial reaction forces
as a motor response to promote the body stability. Bilateral changes were observed in hip joint, with a decrease in the participation
of the hip extensors and in the eccentric contraction of hip flexors. In ankle joint a decrease in the participation of ankle plantar
flexors was found. In conclusion, the overall results point to biomechanical adjustments that showed a decrease of the mechanical
load of women throughout pregnancy, with exception for few unilateral changes of hip joint moments.

1. Introduction

During the normal development of pregnancy, women expe-
rience a variety of morphological and physiological changes,
as well as a continuous increase in body weight [1, 2].
However, the dynamics of the load that women experience
and how this weight gain influence everyday tasks, such as
walking, are not fully described. Walking is widely used not
only as a mean of locomotion, but also as a mode of exercise,
especially recommended throughout pregnancy and without
contraindications for pregnant women [3].

The ground reaction forces (GRF) have been widely
studied in the characterization of walking; however, only
in the last two decades these parameters were studied in
pregnant women. The importance of these parameters to
investigate the stability and possible causes of falls in pregnant
women has been the focus of recent studies. Lymbery and

Gilleard [4] concluded that in late pregnancy the mediolateral
GRF tended to be increased in a medial direction along with
a wider step width, suggesting that women may adapt their
gait to maximize stability in the stance phase of walking
and to control mediolateral motion. Branco et al. [5], in a
previous study, analyzed the tridimensional adaptations of
kinetic parameters between the second and third trimesters
of twenty-four pregnant women and with a control group.
Most of the results reveal significant changes between preg-
nancy stages and nonpregnant group, reporting a decrease of
the mechanical load of pregnant women, specifically with a
lower magnitude in the third peak of vertical GRF and in
the second peak of anterior component of GRF, and most
of the stance phase has a medial GRF. According to Abu
Osman and Ghazali [6] and McCrory et al. [7] no changes
were found for GRF in the collected groups. However, in
most studies only the last stages of pregnancy were considered

(with the exception of Abu Osman and Ghazali [6] and Inanir
et al. [8]), not getting clearly defined if there is any influence
of pregnancy condition on these variables, and if these
changes happen gradually from the beginning of pregnancy.
Such as the GRF, the joint kinetics is mostly studied in
the last two trimesters of pregnancy or between the end
of pregnancy and postpartum (with exception for the study
of Huang et al. [9]). Foti et al. [10] regarding this analysis,
which reported significant increases in hip and ankle kinetics
during pregnancy). Their findings show that during preg-
nancy there may be an increased demand placed on the hip
abductors, hip extensors, and ankle plantarflexors muscles
during walking. Branco et al. [5] analyze the tridimensional
adaptations of kinetic parameters between the second and
third trimesters of twenty-four pregnant women and with a
control group. Most of the changes reveal significant changes
between pregnancy stages and nonpregnant group. In the
joint moments they found a decrease in hip flexors, knee
extensors, ankle dorsiflexors, and ankle evertors’ moment and
an increase in the participation of hip external rotators during
loading response phase of pregnant women. In the joint
powers they found significant decreases in the absorption of
mechanical energy of hip flexors and significant decreases in
the production of mechanical energy of the hip abductors
and in the ankle plantarflexors. An increase in the production
of mechanical energy was found for hip extensors and hip
external rotators. Huang et al. [9] compared the gait pattern
of nonpregnant and pregnant women divided into three
groups, respectively: 12 weeks, 13–28 weeks, and 29–40 weeks
of gestation, which were tested only once. They reported
significant differences between the pregnant and nonpreg-
nant women, especially in knee abduction angle, knee and
hip internal rotation angles, hip extension moment, and hip
power. Also, as gestational age increased, the pregnant group
increased hip extension moment, decreased knee extension
moment, increased knee adduction moment, and decreased
ankle plantar flexion moment. It is not clear however, in the
different studies (with the exception of Branco et al. [5]),
if these changes occur bilaterally, occur only unilaterally, or
correspond to average values between sides.

Thus, the main purpose of this study was to assess the
gait kinetics, in order to check if there are any changes in
the dynamics of the load of women from the beginning of
pregnancy until the postpartum period. To achieve the main
objective, it was necessary to describe and quantify the kinetic
variables, regarding GRF, joints moment of force, and joints
power, of ankle, knee, and hip, during gait, at the end of the
first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy and in the
postpartum period.

We tested the hypothesis that the GRF, joints moment,
and joints power parameters exhibit deviations along the
pregnancy and are associated with this special phase of life,
which are recovered in the postpartum period.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Subjects. Eleven pregnant women, aged between 32 and
37 years (33.20 ± 1.62 years), with height between 1.60 and

1.73 meters (1.64 ± 0.04 m), with no history of foot, ankle,
knee, musculoskeletal, and neuromuscular trauma or disease,
participated in this study. The participants have the following
characteristics of weight and weeks of gestation (wk) in the
four periods of data collection: (1) first trimester: 61.1±6.6 kg
and 14.2 ± 2.4 wk; (2) second trimester: 66.6 ± 8.5 kg and
27.3 ± 1.0 wk; (3) third trimester: 71.0 ± 8.0 kg and 36.3 ±
0.9 wk; and (4) postpartum period: 62.4± 7.4 kg and 20.6±
5.2 weeks after birth.

The participants were recruited via direct contact and
flyers placed in gym and health centres and have volunteered
to participate in the study. None of the participants had con-
traindication to physical exercise. All subjects gave written
informed consent prior to the participation in the study.

2.2. Data Collection and Processing. The study was approved
by the ethical committee of the Faculty of Human Kinet-
ics (University of Lisbon) and data were collected at the
Laboratory of Biomechanics and Functional Morphology, in
four periods: during the later stages of the first, second, and
third trimesters of gestation and in the postpartum period.
Before performing the motor task, anthropometric data was
measured (weight and height), according to the International
Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK)
standardized measurement protocol [11] by ISAK certified
anthropometrists, to calculate the body segment masses and
inertia moments.

In order to collect static and dynamic data trials, spherical
reflective markers were placed on the skin on both sides of the
lower body with double-sided adhesive tape. Markers setup
is in agreement with the suggestion of Cappozzo et al. [12],
for lower limb segments, and CODA (Charnwood Dynamics
Ltd., Leicestershire, UK) protocols for model of the pelvis
segment.

The motor task was to walk barefoot a distance of 10
meters between two points, in a straight line in both direc-
tions at a natural and comfortable speed, during 3 minutes,
stopping and starting the path in the opposite direction.
The floor had no specific patterns or irregularities, and the
participants had no knowledge about the location of force
platforms, which were placed in the middle of the defined
distance. Participants were allowed to get familiar with the
laboratory system and no fatigue occurrence was reported.

Planar motion of the hip, knee, and ankle joints was
calculated with Visual 3D (V3D) software (C-Motion Inc.,
Germantown, USA) by a computational procedure imple-
menting the dot product between the skeletal segments
articulated by these joints.

Kinematic data were collected through twelve infrared
high-speed cameras (Oqus-300, Qualisys, Sweden) at a rate of
200 Hz, and kinetic data were collected with two Kistler force
platforms (Kistler AG, Winterthur, Switzerland) of 0.60 m×
0.40 m and one AMTI platform (Advanced Mechanical
Technology, Inc., Watertown) of 0.90 m × 0.60 m, at a rate
of 1000 Hz. The capture hardware was connected to Qualisys
USB Analog Acquisition interface in order to synchronize
kinetic and kinematic data with software Qualisys Track
Manager (QTM; Qualisys AB, Gothenburg, Sweden). Both
data sequences were recorded in the same file. The system

was calibrated by wand type, with an exact wand length
of 751.4 mm moved randomly across the recorded field,
before the data collection of each participant. Calibration was
accepted if the standard deviation of the wand’s length mea-
sures was below 0.5 mm. Cameras were positioned statically
to minimize light reflection artefacts and to allow recording
of at least two consecutive walking cycles, defined as the time
between two consecutive initial ground contacts of the heel
strike with each foot. The last four cycles within the period of
three minutes performed by each participant were considered
for the analysis.

A three-dimensional (3D) analysis was performed inclu-
ding both sides of the body. The trajectory of the reflective
markers was smoothed using a Butterworth low-pass filter
with a 10 Hz cutoff. Collected data were interpolated using
a Cubic Spline Interpolation as suggested by Robertson et
al. [13], for a maximum of 10 frames gap, and filtered with a
Butterworth digital low-pass filter, at 10 Hz cutoff frequency
for kinematic and kinetic data, as suggested by Robertson and
Dowling [14]. All data were normalized in time. The setup of
markers used is described in our previous study [15].

Considering the four time phases in analysis, kinetic
pattern curves of the three components of the GRF were
normalized to units of bodyweight and were estimated
relative to the total time of contact of the foot on the ground.
These data curves and peak values were estimated for left
and right sides, with Visual 3D software (C-Motion, Inc.,
Germantown, USA).

The net joint moments and powers of the ankle, knee,
and hip were calculated using an inverse dynamics approach,
considering an???Cardan sequence for joint angles, and
resolved for the proximal segment’s coordinate system [16]
in Visual 3D software. For kinetic parameters, initial foot
contact was collected at the time corresponding to first
contact of the foot on the floor, while final contact was
collected with the last contact of the foot on the floor.

In the four periods under analysis, the following variables
of the GRF curves were analyzed: three peaks characterize
the vertical component, two peaks characterize the anterior-
posterior component, and two peaks characterize the medial-
lateral component.

The joints’ moments’ patterns were the following: the hip
moment is characterized by two peaks in the sagittal plane,
two peaks in the frontal plane, and one peak in the transverse
plane. The knee moment is characterized by three peaks in
the sagittal plane. The ankle moment is characterized by two
peaks in the sagittal plane, one peak in the frontal plane, and
two peaks in the transverse plane.

The joints’ power patterns were the following: the hip
power is characterized by two peaks in the sagittal plane, three
peaks in the frontal plane, and two peaks in the transverse
plane. The knee power is characterized by three peaks in the
sagittal plane. The ankle power is characterized by two peaks
in the sagittal plane, two peaks in the frontal plane, and two
peaks in the transverse plane.

2.3. Statistical Analysis. All statistical procedures were con-
ducted using IBM SPSS Statistics 22 software for Win-
dows. Shapiro-Wilk normality tests were conducted and not

assumed for all cases. The Mauchly’s test of sphericity was
performed before Repeated Measures (RM) analysis and
sphericity was not assumed in all tests. For post hoc tests,
the Bonferroni test was used based on Student’s ? statistic,
adjusting the observed significance level for the fact that
multiple comparisons were made. For variables and groups
which did not commit all assumptions of RM analysis, the
Friedman test was performed, as well as the Wilcoxon test
in the case of pairwise analysis. In this case, Bonferroni
confidence interval adjustment was applied to allow an
adjustment to the confidence intervals and significance values
for multiple comparisons.

3. Results

3.1. Ground Reaction Forces. Most of the components of the
GRF are influenced by the stage of pregnancy, particularly in
the three peaks of the vertical component, in the two peaks of
the anterior-posterior component, and at the first peak of the
medial-lateral component of GRF (Figure 1).

The descriptive statistics of the GRF can be found in
Table 1. Our results suggest a decrease of GRF in late preg-
nancy.

The first and second peaks of vertical GRF show signifi-
cant changes from third trimester to the postpartum period,
emphasizing an increase of 4% in the braking peak and a
decrease of 5% of bodyweight (BW) in the inverted peak for
right lower limb. In both stances, a significant decrease of 5%
BW in the third peak from the first to the third trimesters
and an increase of about 7% BW from the end of pregnancy
to postpartum period were observed, which correspond to a
recovery to values above those recorded in early pregnancy.
Also in propulsive peak, to the right stance, there is a decrease
of 4% BW from second to third trimesters. In the anterior-
posterior component of GRF, an increase of 2% BW from
first trimester to postpartum period in the posterior direction
(first peak) of the right lower limb and a decrease of 2% BW
in the anterior direction (second peak) of the left lower limb
were found which represent that at the end of pregnancy the
participants apply less of their bodyweight of force against the
floor in the loading response phase and in the preswing phase.
The medial-lateral component of GRF decreases in the first
peak, moving from a medial reaction to a lateral reaction in
the third trimester to the postpartum period.

3.2. Joint Moments of Force

3.2.1. Sagittal Plane. A longitudinal effect of pregnancy in
joint moments of force, in sagittal plane, was observed for
some peaks of hip and ankle joints (Figure 2).

Descriptive statistics of the joints moment, and the
significance levels of the pairs of collections with significant
changes for sagittal, frontal, and transverse planes, are pre-
sented in Table 2.

The moment of force in hip joint shows a significant
decrease of 0.128 N?m?kg?1 in the action of hip extensors,

third trimesters (both sides) to postpartum period, indicating
that there is an opposite trend to what happens during
pregnancy even from the beginning. In terminal stance
phase, only for right side, there is a significant decrease of
0.156 N?m?kg?1 in the action of the hip flexors from the begin-
ning to the end of pregnancy, and an increase of, respectively,
0.208 N?m?kg?1 and 0.285 N?m?kg?1 from the second and
third trimesters to postpartum, similar to what happens at the
beginning of the stance phase. No changes were found in knee
moments of force during pregnancy and postpartum period.
The ankle plantarflexors participation shows a significant
decreasing of 0.082 N?m?kg?1 from first to third trimesters,
in right ankle, and an increase of 0.075 N?m?kg?1 on their
participation from late pregnancy to postpartum period, for
left ankle.

3.2.2. Frontal Plane. The longitudinal effect of pregnancy
was not observed in frontal plane, and therefore no signif-
icant changes were found in any of the analyzed variables
(Figure 3).

3.2.3. Transverse Plane. In transverse plane, the effect of
pregnancy is only observable in hip joint for midstance phase
(Wilks’?= 0.201,?(3,8) = 10.573,?= 0.004) (Figure 4).

During this phase, there is an increase in the participation
of the external rotators of the right hip throughout pregnancy,
most pronounced between the first and second trimesters
and less pronounced between the first and third trimesters,
with increases in 0.204 N?m?kg?1 and 0.106 N?m?kg?1, respec-
tively. From the second trimester to the postpartum period,

the share of external rotators of the hip decreased significantly
to values close to those found in early pregnancy.

3.3. Joint Power

3.3.1. Sagittal Plane. A longitudinal effect of pregnancy in
joints power was observed for some peaks of hip and knee
joints (Figure 5).

Table 3 shows the descriptive statistics of the joints power,
and the significance levels of the pairs of collections with
significant changes for sagittal, frontal, and transverse planes.
In general, joints power in the postpartum period has similar
values of early pregnancy, when compared to the values
observed during late pregnancy.

The second peak of hip joint power shows a significant
increase of 0.372 W?kg?1 and 0.257 W?kg?1, respectively, for
right and left lower limbs, from third trimester to postpar-
tum period, which indicates a lower execution of eccentric
contraction of hip flexors during terminal stance phase in
late pregnancy. The influence of pregnancy on knee joint
was verified in the second and third peaks; however, a
significant increase of 0.145 W?kg?1 was found only in the
second peak between first trimester and postpartum period,
which means that during midstance phase, pregnant women
in early pregnancy did a minor concentric contraction of the
knee extensors. In the power of ankle joint there were no
significant changes found between collection phases.

3.3.2. Frontal Plane. The longitudinal effect of pregnancy was
not observed in the frontal plane, except for the first peak
power of the left hip joint (Figure 6).

However, the post hoc tests show that this influence does
not cause significant changes between pairs of collections.

3.3.3. Transverse Plane. A longitudinal effect of pregnancy in
joints power of transverse plane was observed for some peaks
of hip and ankle joints (Figure 7).

In right hip joint, an increase of 0.365 W?kg?1 in eccentric
contraction of the external rotators of the hip was observed
between first and second trimesters of pregnancy, during
loading response phase. The left ankle joint shows a signifi-
cant decrease of around 0.06 W?kg?1 in the ankle abductors,
from the first and second trimesters to late pregnancy, which

represents a lower eccentric contraction of these muscles
during terminal stance phase.

4. Discussion

This study aimed to analyze the biomechanics of gait during
pregnancy and postpartum period in a longitudinal perspec-
tive, in order to understand if there are any changes in the
kinetic parameters of gait between collection phases. While
other studies did not found any changes in the vertical or
anterior components of GRF [4, 6, 7], in this study the quan-
tification of vertical GRF has shown a decrease in the braking
propulsive peaks from late pregnancy to postpartum period

where it has values similar to those found in the first two
trimesters of pregnancy. This result suggests that downward
acceleration for the advancement of the body of the pregnant
women and respective force production in the transmission
of weight are smaller in late pregnancy [17]. In the medial-
lateral component, it was found that in late pregnancy women
have more medial reaction for left lower limb, similarly to
the results also found by Takeda et al. [18] and our previous
study [5] particularly during the loading response phase,
which means that participants maintain the medial force
during most of the stance phase. Few studies have found
significant changes in the medial reaction forces, but many
authors make reference to a greater instability in the frontal
plane of the pregnant woman (e.g., [4, 5, 7]), for which these
results indicate the motor response to this instability, thereby
promoting greater body stability. The fact that the changes

only happen in one of the lower limbs shows that the com-
pensations derived from imbalances can happen only in one
of the limbs to maintain balance and reinforces the need to
make analyzes of the two sides.

In the sagittal plane, the kinetics of the hip joint has a
significant reduction in the participation of the hip extensors
during the loading response phase, which is highly associated
with pregnancy. The participation of the hip extensors is
related with the acceptance and support of the weight, which
may be adversely affected by the reduced contribution of
these muscles as the pregnancy progresses. At the terminal
stance phase a reduction in the participation of the right
hip flexors was established, also accompanied by a decrease
in eccentric contraction of these muscles. In this phase, the
extension of the thigh is promoted by inertia and gravity [19],
and these results suggest less control in this motor action by

pregnant women. In fact, the main objective of the hip joint
muscles during the stance phase is the stabilization of the
trunk [17], function that is affected, taking into account the
majority of the results found.

In our previous study [5] there was a significant decrease
in knee joint moments between the group of pregnant women
and the group of nonpregnant women, showing that changes
in the knee joint moments happen until the end of the
first trimester. This is not observed in the present study,
where the participation of the knee joint flexor and extensor
remain similar throughout pregnancy. However, the variation
of mechanical energy in these muscle groups has been
influenced by pregnancy, with a significant reduction in the
production of mechanical energy of the right knee extensors
during midstance phase. The main function of the kinetics of
the knee during this phase is to stabilize lower limbs when

the total body weight is transferred for a single limb support,
which in this case might be compromised. The kinetics of
the ankle is influenced by pregnancy in participation of the
plantar flexors during the preswing phase, with a decrease
throughout pregnancy and a recovery of that participation in
postpartum period. Two indications can be drawn from these
results: the first is that the acceleration of the limb forward
will be lower in late pregnancy and the second is that this
participation is fully recovered after delivery.

Other studies reported some changes in the joint
moments for the frontal plane, particularly an increase of the
hip joint moments [10] (tested only between third trimester
and postpartum) and the knee joint moments [9] and a
decrease of ankle joint moments [5]. In this study no changes
were found throughout pregnancy or postpartum. However,
we found the influence of pregnancy on the absorption of

mechanical energy in the hip abductors during late loading
response phase, without a specific change between collected
phases. One possible reason for the absence of any changes
in the frontal plane may be revealed by the descriptive
statistics of these variables, which relates to the fact that they
present the highest variability (standard deviation) between
the analyses of the planes of motion.

Only our previous study [5] reports changes during
pregnancy in the transverse plane kinetics. In this study,
during the loading response phase, significant increases were
found in the participation of the right hip external rotators

and eccentric contraction of these muscles, particularly in
the second half of the pregnancy. This action is responsible
for deceleration of the pelvis rotation, which aids in the
advancement of the contralateral thigh [17], indicating that
during pregnancy there is an increased control in advance of
the contralateral limb. During the terminal stance phase, a
decrease in eccentric contraction of the left ankle abductors
along the pregnancy was observed, which indicates less con-
trol in the position of the left foot during the first moments
of heel rise. The hypothesis of this study, where pregnancy
is associated with kinetic adaptations, is partially confirmed

by many of the kinetic parameters, for the three planes of
motion, only partially because changes were found in many
kinetic variables, but only in few of them the changes happen
bilaterally and the recovery of these parameters was not
confirmed in all cases, especially in the transverse plane. This
result indicates that some situations of body instability might
be maintained in the postpartum, suggesting the importance
of physical activity, in order to promote the full recovery of
the body stability. In the sagittal plane, for the vast majority of
the parameters with significant changes, a recovery to values
similar to those found in early pregnancy was observed,
confirming the hypothesis raised.

According to Forczek and Staszkiewicz [20], the pregnant
woman has two main strategies for adjustment of biomechan-
ical parameters: first to increase the body stability, and second
to reduce the energy expenditure. Based on our results, the
second approach seems to be adopted in respect to the kinetic

parameters. However, most studies on kinematic parameters
of pregnant women during walking point to findings related
to the first strategy. This suggests that, on the one hand,
the woman increases her body stability in detriment of cost
energy (based on kinematics) and, on the other hand, reduces
the mechanical load in order to reduce the energy cost
(based on kinetics). This reflection shows a balance between
strategies, which require further analysis. This is in line with
some theories of motor behavior that indicate that when the
body is faced with constraints of the organism (and possibly
other constraints) it self-organizes in order to have greater
efficiency [21, 22].

With regard to changes during pregnancy, the morpho-
logical and body composition parameters are those that
are widely known. However, it is not known how these
variables influence the biomechanical parameters, or which
of them give further explanation to mechanical changes in

the musculoskeletal system of the pregnant woman. Thus, we
suggest that future studies quantify the morphological and
body composition changes and analyze how these changes
influence the biomechanical parameters of women through-
out pregnancy and in the postpartum period.

5. Conclusions

A descriptive longitudinal type design was performed, in
which pregnant women were assessed in the first, second,
and third trimesters of pregnancy and in the sixth month
of the postpartum period. The biomechanical analysis of the
lower limb during gait showed that pregnancy is a factor that
influences the kinetic variables of the ankle, knee, and hip
joints. The joint that undergoes the most evident changes is
by far the hip. This fact may be justified by being closer to
the body region with greater anatomical and morphological

changes. The overall results point to biomechanical adjust-
ments that show a decrease of the mechanical load of women
throughout pregnancy, possibly in order to avoid strong
interaction between women and the ground, confirmed by
the decrease of GRF, the joint moments, and joint powers in
the sagittal plane, whose parameters are primarily responsible
for the progression of the body in space. These results point
to some applications to this population, namely, the need
to perform physical activities for the development of body
stability, particularly the stability of the joints of the lower
limbs.

Abstract 

Pregnancy is a special phase of women's lives, which process leads to several changes 

in body composition and morphology. It is not clear whether the biomechanical changes 

occurring in this period are due exclusively to body composition and body size, or due to other 

physiological factors. The purpose of this study was to quantify the morphology and body 

composition of women throughout pregnancy and in the postpartum, and identify the 

contribution of these parameters on the lower limb joints kinetic during gait. Eleven healthy 

women were assessed longitudinally, during pregnancy and in postpartum, regarding several 

anthropometric measurements to determine body composition and kinetic parameters of gait. 

Most of the variables associated with body composition and body dimensions showed a 

significant increase during pregnancy and a decrease in the postpartum. Maternal’s body 

composition in the postpartum was similar to those found in the 1
st
 trimester, except for 

triceps skinfold, calf total area, and body mass index, with higher results than at the beginning 

of pregnancy. Some models were developed to predict women's internal loading through 

anthropometric variables. Four models include variables associated with the amount of fat, 

four models that include variables related to overall body weight, three models that include 

fat-free mass, and one model that includes the shape of the trunk as a predictor variable. All 

models had an adjusted R squared between 29.6 and 66.9, indicating that changes in 

maternal’s body composition and morphology, largely determine kinetic dynamics of the 

female joints in this particular stage of life.

INTRODUCTION 

During pregnancy and in the postpartum period, the woman’s body experiences large 

changes in morphology, physiology and consequently, in body composition. The association 

between body composition, particularly the increase of maternal weight and health related 

problems are known for mother and child well-being.[1 ,2] According to Institute of Medicine 

and National Research Council of the National Academies [3] women with a body mass index 

(BMI) lower than 19.8kg/m
2
 (underweight) should increase their weight between 12.5kg and 

18kg; women with BMI between 19.8kg/m
2
 and 26.0kg/m

2
 (normal weight) must have an 

increase in body weight between 11.5kg and 16kg; women with BMI between 26kg/m
2
 and 

29.0kg/m
2
 (overweight) must have an increase in weight of 7kg to 11.5kg; women with BMI

 (obese) should gain at least 6.8kg. For women carrying twins, 

the recommended target total weight gain at term is 16.0 to 20.5kg.[3 ,4] 

Weight gain during pregnancy has been widely studied and is reported in several 

studies as described below. In general, during pregnancy the weight gain stands at around 

11kg[5-7] although it has been increasing in recent years from 9kg[8] to 14.5kg[9] in non-obese 

women, with much of these gains occurring during the 2
nd

 trimester. However, in late 

pregnancy, women accumulate an average of 4kg of body fat[5 ,7 ,8]. The prevalence of 

women with normal weight significantly decreased between the 2
nd

 and the 3
rd

 trimesters 

from 63.2% to 39.5%, respectively.[10] After delivery, the woman's weight remains above her 

pre-pregnancy body weight[5] or in early pregnancy.[6] 

Women classified as obese in early pregnancy have significantly higher sum of 

skinfolds thickness and higher fat mass gains compared to normal weight women.[6] Although 

different studies showed an increase of the skinfolds thickness throughout pregnancy, changes 

were not always significant. Thus, the skinfolds that showed significant increases were: 

subscapular, suprailiac and thigh;[11] triceps, biceps and subscapular;[12] and mid-thigh and 

calf skinfolds.[10]

Body dimensions of pregnant women measured by the segmental girths show that 

thigh,[10 ,11] hip and calf girths[11] significantly increase during pregnancy. Also between the 

2
nd

 and the 3
rd

 trimesters there are an increase of body fat areas of the mid-thigh and calf and 

of the total fat mass.[10] 

The influence of body segment parameters in the estimation of inverse dynamics 

solutions have been investigated by some studies conducted in the last decade. [13-15] 

However, it is not known the influence of body composition and morphologic changes on 

woman’s biomechanical parameters of gait during pregnancy and in postpartum period.  

Thus, the purpose of this study was to quantify maternal anthropometric and body 

composition changes throughout pregnancy and in the postpartum period, and to identify the 

contribution of these parameters on the lower limb joints kinetic during gait. 

 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Subjects 

The sample was composed of 11 healthy Caucasian women (33.2±1.6years, range 32-

37) without musculoskeletal problems, neuromuscular disorders or other diseases. 

Participants’ characteristics are described in Table 1.

Ethical Council of the Faculty of Human Kinetics, University of Lisbon, Portugal. 

Data Collection and Processing 

Data were collected at the Laboratory of Biomechanics and Functional Morphology of 

the Faculty of Human Kinetics in 4 periods: at gestational age of 14.2±2.4weeks, at 

27.3±1.0weeks, and at 36.3±0.9weeks and in the postpartum period at 20.6±5.2 weeks. 

The anthropometric variables collected were weight, height, 6 skinfolds (subscapular, 

triceps, biceps, iliac crest, front thigh and medial calf); 4 girths (abdominal, gluteal, mid-thigh 

and calf) and; 3 breaths (biiliocristale, thoracic and biacromiale). All anthropometric data were 

measured according to the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry 

(ISAK) standardized measurement protocol,[16] with exception for abdominal girth, which was 

measured 2cm below belly button (navel), and the thoracic breadth, which was measured at 

the level of the last rib. Data were collected by ISAK certified anthropometrists. Based on these 

measurements, other variables were calculated, including body weight gain in each trimester 

by reference to pre-pregnancy body weight (self-reported by pregnant in a specific 

questionnaire form); the body density and the percentage of fat mass,[17] muscle and fat 

areas of the thigh and lower leg;[18] the body fat and fat-free mass; the biiliocristale-acromiale 

and abdominal-gluteal ratio and BMI. 

Kinematic and kinetic parameters were collected through 12 infrared high-speed 

cameras (Oqus-300, Qualisys, Sweden) at a rate of 200Hz, and 3 force platforms (2 Kistlers - 

Kistler AG, Winterthur, Switzerland; and 1 AMTI force plate - Advanced Mechanical 

Technology, Inc., Watertown), at a rate of 1000Hz. Spherical reflective markers were placed on 

the skin in lower limb segments with double-sided adhesive tape at predefined locations 

according to recent recommendations.[19] Kinetic and kinematic data were synchronized to 

the same file through software Qualisys Track Manager (QTM; Qualisys AB, Gothenburg, 

Sweden). Data were collected during 3 non-consecutive minutes walking at a comfortable

speed and were considered the last 4 cycles performed by each participant. The procedures 

were fully described in a previous paper.[20 ,21] 

Statistical Analysis 

The statistical procedures were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics 22 software for 

Windows. Shapiro-Wilk normality tests were conducted and not assumed for all cases. 

Repeated Measures ANOVA analysis was used to verify differences of body composition 

variables between groups. For variables and groups which not commit all assumptions for 

repeated measures analysis, it was performed the Friedman test. To development the 

prediction models was used the linear regression with the enter method. Only one predictor 

variable can enter this technique because of the sample size.[22]

All anthropometric variables were significantly influenced by pregnancy, with 

exception for mid-thigh girth and biiliocristale-biacromiale ratio. 

Although the bioacromial breath was significantly different between the 1
st

 and the 3
rd

 

trimester and from the 1
st

 trimester and postpartum, the biliocristal breath was only 

significantly different from the 1
st
 trimester and the 3

rd
 trimester (an increase of 1.5cm, 

P?0.001); thus, no significant differences (P&gt;0.05) were observed for biiliocristale-biacromiale 

ratio (Table 2). 

The thoracic breadth shows changes between all pairs of collection phases, with 

exception for the 1
st
 trimester and postpartum, increasing 2.6cm from the 1

st
 to the 3

rd
 

trimester, and decreasing the same value from late pregnancy to postpartum. 

The abdominal girth shows a mean increase throughout pregnancy of 16.5cm and a 

significant decrease of 14.7cm from 3
rd

 trimester to postpartum. The gluteal girth also shows 

significant increases of 3.1cm and 4.3cm from 1
st

 to 2
nd

 and 3
rd

 trimesters, and a significant 

decrease of 3.2cm from late pregnancy to postpartum. The calf girth only shows a significant 

increase of 1.1cm from early to late pregnancy. Only mid-thigh girth has no changes in any of 

the phases observed. 

The subscapular and biceps skinfolds shows a significant increase of respectively 

1.9mm and 0.3mm from 1
st

 to 3
rd

 trimester, without changes from 3

 trimester to postpartum. 

The tricipital skinfold increases its size from 1
st

, 2

 and 3

 trimester to postpartum, 

respectively 3.8mm, 2.5mm and 3.7mm. The Iliac crest, front thigh and calf skinfolds have no 

changes throughout pregnancy and postpartum. The sum of the skinfolds shows a significant 

increase of 6.0cm from 1
st

 to 3

 trimester, without other changes throughout pregnancy and

In accordance with the recommendations of the Subcommittee on Nutritional Status 

and Weight Gain During Pregnancy of the Committee on Nutritional Status During Pregnancy 

and Lactation, Institute of Medicine, our participants demonstrated a normal weight (BMI 

?19.8 to 26.0kg/m
2
) during the first two trimesters and in the postpartum period, and 

overweight in the last trimester (BMI&gt;26.0 to 29.0kg/m
2
). On the other hand, pregnancy 

weight gain was lower than the recommendations during the first two trimesters, since 

participants weight gain should had varied from 11.5 to 16kg as their BMI was normal in the 1
st

 

and the 2
nd

 trimesters. In contrast, during the 3
rd

 trimester, the mean body weight gain above 

the recommendations [3]. 

Only the segmental areas of the calf were affected by pregnancy. The muscular area of 

the calf had a significant increase of 4.2cm
2
 from the 1

st
 to the 3

rd
 trimester and a significant 

decrease of 3.9cm
2
 from the 3

rd
 trimester to the postpartum period. The fat area of the calf 

also increased significantly from the 1
st
 to the 3

rd
 trimester and for the postpartum, 

respectively of 2.4cm
2
 and 2.6cm

2
. The paired comparisons of the total area of the thigh 

increased significantly 14.5cm
2
 and 16.4cm

2
, respectively from the 1

st
 to the 2

nd
 and 3

rd
 

trimesters. The muscular and fat areas of the thigh did not show any changes throughout 

pregnancy and postpartum. 

As excepted, women’s fat mass and free-fat mass weight were influenced by the stage 

of pregnancy or postpartum. Body fat increased between the 1
st
 to the 2

nd
 and the 3

rd
 

trimesters, respectively 2.9kg and 3.7kg, decreasing for the end of pregnancy to postpartum in 

2.1kg. The free-fat mass was significantly increased in 6.1kg between the 1
st

 and the 2
nd

 

trimester and in 3.5kg through the end of the pregnancy. After delivery this variable showed a 

significant decrease, when compared to the values of the 2
nd

 and 3
rd

 trimesters, in 3kg and 

6.6kg respectively.  

The abdominal-gluteal ratio shows changes throughout pregnancy and in postpartum 

period. No changes were found between the 1
st
 trimester and the postpartum. No significant

changes were observed in the biiliocristale-biacromiale ratio during this study; however, this 

variable was used in calculating women’s acromio-iliac ratio. In every collection phases, 

acromio-iliac ratio showed greater values than 0.76, which means that during pregnancy and 

for postpartum period, women keeps a trunk with a rectangular shape [23]. BMI increased

however were considered for this study, those whose changes were identified as affected by 

the stage of pregnancy. Regarding GRF only the vertical component of the 3

influence of the stage of pregnancy or postpartum. In the joint moments were considered the 

2

 peak of the hip in the sagittal plane, and the 1

 peak 

of the hip joint in the transverse plane. For the joint powers were considered the 2

 peak of 

the knee and hip joints in the sagittal plane, and the 1

 peak of the hip joint in the transverse 

plane. 

Regression models for joint moments 

The building of predictive models for the kinetic parameters through anthropometric 

variables can provide additional information about the dynamics of the internal load in 

pregnant women. The relationships between anthropometric variables, and the knee and hip 

joints moment in the sagittal plane were found in three cases, which are given in Table 5.

Body weight gain is a significant predictor (p&lt;.05) of hip joint power in the transverse

Although the ground reaction forces (GRF) are the loading response of the body mass 

in the ground, it has not been defined how much of this response is due to the anthropometric 

or body composition variables. In Table 9 are presented the regression model for GRF with an

DISCUSSION 

This study’s first objective was to assess and quantify women’s anthropometric and 

body composition changes during pregnancy and in the postpartum period. In spite of the 

small size of the sample, this was a longitudinal study that is in consensus with others 

longitudinal studies conducted during pregnancy.[25 ,26] In general, body composition 

variables showed an increase throughout pregnancy and a reduction from late pregnancy to 

the postpartum period. Nevertheless, most of these variables did not differ between the 1
st

 

trimester and postpartum, with exception for body weight loss, which is significantly lower 

after delivery than in the 1
st

 trimester (p=0.012).

During pregnancy several physiological modifications occur in the pregnant woman’s 

body in order to guarantee mother’s energy needs and health and to support fetus growth and 

development.[25 ,27 ,28] In fact, maternal body composition has been one of the most 

studied, but there is a lack of it in relation to kinetics parameters of gait during pregnancy. 

In our study, both weight gain and the body mass index were affected by pregnancy 

with significant increases during pregnancy[26] and significant decreases to postpartum 

period, as in recent studies.[29] However, that variation in weight gain was lower than the 

recommendations during the first two trimesters and higher in the 3
rd

 trimester.[3 ,26 ,28] It 

has been highlighted that maternal fat gains are associated with important implications for 

maternal and offspring health and with a greater postpartum fat retention in the mother.[26] 

In addition, the maternal body weight gain may also interfere with important kinetics 

parameters of gait, as observed in our results of gait’s kinetics parameters. 

In another recent study[25] to determine women’s metabolic profile, 21 healthy 

women were evaluated: 11 at preconception, during pregnancy and 1 year postpartum, and 10 

had no interval pregnancy, so were assessed at baseline and a 1 year interval. Weight, fat-free 

mass (kg), fat mass (kg) and the percentage of body fat were assessed by hydrodensitometry. 

Significant differences (p&lt;0.05) were observed for weight and fat-free mass from 

preconception [59.7 (53.5–85.6)kg and 42.5 (39.0–49.2)kg, respectively] to pregnancy [77.2 

(62.9–94.3)kg and 54.7 (46.7–57.5)kg, respectively]. In contrast, no significant differences were 

observed in preconception versus postpartum for these two variables, as well as no significant 

differences (P&gt;0.05) were observed in body fat according to body size and in the percentage of 

body fat between preconception [20.7 (13.7–37.4)kg and 30.0 (24.1–43.8)%] and pregnancy 

[24.2 (14.9–38.7)kg and 30.6 (24.8–40.2)%] and between pregnancy and postpartum [18.4 

(13.8–41.3)kg and 29.3(25.2–46.2)%]. Similar results with ours in the postpartum period were 

observed for fat-free mass [44.3 (38.8–49.6)kg], body fat according to body size [18.4 (13.8–

41.3)kg] and the percentage of body fat [29.3 (25.2–46.2)%].

The biiliocristale breadth has a significant increase of 1.5cm between the 1

st
 and the 3

rd
 

trimester and, although there is a reduction in late pregnancy to the postpartum period, this is 

not significant, which may suggest that the distance between the iliac bones remains after 

pregnancy. 

As expected, abdominal and the gluteal girths suffered major changes throughout 

pregnancy; however these variables recovered in the postpartum to values similar to those 

found in early pregnancy. The calf girth increased 1.1cm from the 1
st
 to the 3

rd
 trimester as 

Perez, et al. [10] found. These authors also found changes in the mid-thigh girth, which was 

not demonstrated in this study. 

Although the sum of skinfolds showed a significant increase between the 1
st

 and 3
rd

 

trimester of pregnancy, mainly caused by subscapular, triceps and biceps skinfolds, only the 

triceps skinfold presented a significant increase of almost 4mm throughout pregnancy to the 

postpartum period. In spite of no significant changes were observed in the fat mass 

percentage, the accumulation of fat mass seems to happen mostly at the upper region of the 

trunk and upper limbs, keeping or increasing their thickness in the postpartum period. In 

addition, relatively to fat mass weight, significantly increases from the 1
st

 to the 2
nd

 trimester 

and from the 2
nd

 to the 3
rd

 trimester of pregnancy were showed. After delivery, the fat mass 

weight decreases, showing a recovery to levels similar to the first stage of pregnancy. In the 

same way, the free-fat mass weight increases during pregnancy, which may be related to the 

increase of the tissues and fluids associated with pregnancy itself and also for the weight of 

the fetus, and decrease again in the postpartum period. 

The bi-compartmental assessment of body composition of the lower limbs can be 

observed by the total, muscle and fat areas of the thigh and calf. Perez, et al. [10] have found 

increases in the thigh fat area and further in calf fat area, between the 2
nd

 and the 3
rd

 

trimester. In this study, only the total area of the thigh showed significant changes, increasing 

14.5cm
2 

and 16.4cm
2
 respectively from the 1

st
 to the 2

nd
 and from the 2

nd
 to the 3

of pregnancy. In the calf segment, significant increases were found throughout pregnancy, 

both for fat and muscle areas, but only the last variable decreases in postpartum period. 

The abdominal-gluteal ratio, shows the volume distribution between the lower torso 

and the pelvic region. Throughout pregnancy it changes so that in late pregnancy the 

distribution of the volume of the abdomen (mainly anterior) and the volume of the hips 

(mainly posterior) is the same. The biiliocristale-biacromiale ratio do not shows significant 

changes, meaning that during pregnancy the woman keep a rectangular trunk shape.[23] 

In the 3
rd

 trimester, the regression models to predict relative GRF of women shows 

that higher ratio between iliocristal and acromial breadth have an increased magnitude in the 

3
rd

 peak of vertical GRF (Figure 3). 

After application of the linear regression technique for predicting women's internal 

loading during pregnancy and in the postpartum period through anthropometric variables, 

twelve models were developed, of which four models include independent variables 

associated with the amount of fat; four models include independent variables related to 

overall body weight; three models include fat-free mass as a predictor variable and; a model 

includes the shape of the trunk as a predictor variable. A summary of the interaction between 

the anthropometric variables and the joint kinetic variables of the lower limb, in the four 

studied stages, are represented in Figures 1 and 2. 

In the 1
st

 trimester of pregnancy, a higher body weight gain lead to an increased 

production of mechanical energy of the knee extensors during the mid-stance phase. In the 2
nd

 

trimester the regression models allow to predict that a greater abdominal-gluteal ratio and a 

higher percentage of body fat have respectively an increased participation of the extensors 

and external rotators of the hip, during the loading response phase. Also in this stage of 

pregnancy, a larger thigh fat area lead to less absorption of mechanical energy of the hip 

flexors during terminal stance phase. In the 3
rd

 trimester, a higher body mass index and larger 

areas of fat of the calf and the thigh increased the participation of the hip external rotators

during the loading response phase. In addition, a higher body weight gain, until this trimester, 

induce to a greater eccentric contraction of the hip external rotators also in this phase of 

walking cycle. A higher free-fat mass weight lead to a lower eccentric contraction of the hip 

flexors during the terminal stance, and a lower participation of the hip flexors during pre-swing 

phase. A higher weight of free-fat mass and a greater loss of body mass, in the postpartum 

period, leads respectively to a lower absorption of mechanical energy of the hip flexors during 

terminal stance phase, and to a lower participation of the same muscles during the pre-swing 

phase. 

Considering the limitations on the use of simple linear regression techniques, it should 

be appreciated that the variability in the explanation of the models have relatively high levels 

in five of them, whose values are very close to or above 50%. The highest levels of explanation 

in the models variability occurred in the 1
st
 trimester and in the postpartum period, during the 

phases of gait cycle, in which there is an increased support of the body in one lower limb. The 

reason to happen in the early period of pregnancy and in the postpartum may show that the 

neuromuscular system of the woman is not prepared for morphological changes happening on 

her body. This information is relevant not only for the pregnant women, but also for Health 

and Physical Exercise Professionals.[28] 

 

CONCLUSIONS 

The study of the influence of morphology on the internal load of women during 

pregnancy and in the postpartum has not been studied. This study showed significant changes 

during pregnancy, regarding the variables associated with global body composition. The 

absolute amount of fat increased significantly to the end of pregnancy, especially by the 

contribution of the adipose tissue accumulated in the skinfolds of the upper limbs and upper 

trunk. Regarding to the relative values of fat, there were no changes during pregnancy and to 

the postpartum period.

gain/loss appeared as major predictors of the joint kinetics of women throughout pregnancy 

and in the postpartum. Most of the variables related to the amount of fat are predictors of the 

muscles involved in motor actions of the transverse plane. Most of the developed models were 

used to predict muscle participation involving the hip joint in the sagittal and transverse planes 

of motion, emphasizing that this joint is the one that is under greater influence of 

anthropometric variables. 

The body weight gain/loss was the variable that most explained the mechanical energy 

of the lower limb joints, showing that had the most important role in the muscle contractions’ 

dynamics, especially in the 1
st
 and 3

rd
 trimesters of pregnancy. 

The morphological changes that occur during pregnancy had greater influence in 

internal load involving the hip. 

Although, due to the sample size, regression models had only one predictor variable; 

the explanation indices of the models (adjusted r squared) were quite high, indicating that 

body composition and pregnant morphology changes during pregnancy, largely determining 

the kinetic dynamics of the female joints in this particular stage of life.  

Monitoring maternal’s body composition during pregnancy and kinetic parameters of 

gait is difficulty, but of great importance, especially in the 3
rd

 trimester. 

It is recommended for further studies the increase of the sample to allow regression 

models with more variables, not only including the body composition parameters, but also 

physical activity before and during pregnancy.
