acknowledgments Firstly, my appreciation goes to FCT (Fundação para a Ciência e a 

Tecnologia) for supporting this thesis.  
In addition, I owe gratitude to many people for their support and encouragement 
as I have been completing this PhD thesis.   

First of all, I would like to thank my advisors, Professor Celeste Coelho and 
Professor Carlos Costa, who have provided me with this wonderful opportunity 
to study at the University of Aveiro and I appreciate their help and guidance in 
this way. It has been a great pleasure working with them!  

Thanks to the juries who kindly accepted to review my thesis! 

Secondly, many thanks go to my husband for sharing all those days with me 
surveying the local communities of Qeshm and others geoparks. I love you 
Rasool! 

Particular thanks go to my kind parents for always supporting my crazy pursuits 
with their prayers, finances, encouragement and time. I love you both! 

Reza and Negar thanks for your kinds.  

I am thankful for all my friends (Fillipa, Joana, Susana, Zelia, Marília, etc.)! 

This geotourism study could not have been implemented without the help of 
Margarete Patzak – the Programme Specialist from Global Earth Observation 
Section, Division of Ecological and Earth Sciences UNESCO – special thanks 
for her contribution in collecting questionnaires. I also appreciate the help of 
managers and officials of the Global Geoparks Network for providing the 
requested information.   

Next I would like to thank Carlos Neto de Carvalho and Joana Rodrigues 
(officials of Naturtejo Geopark), who opened my vision about geopark activities. 

I also want to thank Qeshm Geopark authorities and I am truly grateful for their 
help. 

Finally, thank you to everyone who helped me on the way, including those that I 
may have forgotten to mention here.

resumo   
                                                          Esta tese analisa o papel desempenhado pelos geoparques e pelo geoturismo 

para a sustentabilidade socio-económica e sociocultural das áreas rurais e de 
que forma estes contribuem para o turismo sustentável. Para esse efeito, o 
estudo é baseado numa extensa revisão da literatura sobre geoparques, 
geoturismo e turismo sustentável, bem como a atividade em rede e inovação 
aplicada aos geoparques registados na Rede Global de Geoparques. 
Com base na revisão da literatura, uma série de hipóteses são formuladas 
para serem depois testadas na parte empírica da tese. A população estudada 
constou dos geoparques registados na Rede Global de Geoparques (N = 64), 
em 2009, a nível internacional. O primeiro questionário investigou o papel dos 
geoparques no desenvolvimento rural e O segundo questionário analisou a 
atividade em rede entre geoparques e avaliar a taxa de conectividade da Rede 
Global de Geoparques e da Rede Europeia de Geoparques. 

                                                           A realização de entrevistas a nível local permitiram revelar os efeitos 
significativos e tangíveis da criação de geoparques no desenvolvimento local. 
Assim, foi selecionado o Qeshm Geopark (Irão) como estudo de caso, e as 
comunidades locais que vivem nas aldeias vizinhas do geoparque foram 
entrevistados.  

                                                                 Os dados foram analisados através de softwares de apoio à análise 
quantitativa, qualitativa e de redes, tais como o SPSS, NVivo e Pajek, 
respetivamente. Este último foi utilizado para produzir uma imagem da rede de 
relacionamento social entre os geoparques entrevistados. 
Com base nesses resultados uma série de implicações são sugeridas, bem 
como algumas recomendações para futuras pesquisas. 
Para além disso, a fim de investigar o papel do estabelecimento do Qeshm 
Geopark para o desenvolvimento rural, o trabalho de campo envolveu ainda 
entrevistas face a face com as comunidades locais e três matrizes SWOT 
foram projetadas para uma melhor gestão dos geoparques. 
Utilizando ambas as abordagens qualitativa e quantitativa, esta tese visa 
contribuir para uma melhor compreensão do novo nicho de mercado que 
constitui o geoturismo, bem como dos novos destinos desenvolvidos em torno 
dos geoparque.

CHAPTER 1- Introduction 



Chapter 1- Introduction 

    1 

1.1. General Introduction  
The tourism sector is a ‘market’ that uses cultural and natural heritage as a support for its 

backbone activities, such as promotion of destinations, accommodation, transportation, 

and catering. Hence, the new concept of geotourism as a new niche market with special 

interest in the geo – geology, geomorphology, and geodiversity– can add opportunities to 

cultural sustainability and rural development. Geotourism as a branch of sustainable tour-

ism allows tourists and visitors to travel in a territory in order to experience, learn from, 

and enjoy earth heritage. 

At present, geotourism is a new movement helping travellers to increase their knowledge 

about natural resources, the cultural identity of host communities, and ways of preserving 

them. The ‘emerging tourism’ niche of geotourism is still at an early stage of commercial 

development in most countries, and geoparks as a sustainable development model for 

protected areas are pioneers in the development of geotourism marketing. Likewise, the 

rapidly increasing numbers of United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organi-

zation (UNESCO) registered geoparks, up to 87 at the end of 2011 ( Newsome et al., 

2011), is good news for promoting geotourism and sustainable socioeconomic activities in 

rural areas. 

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) intro-

duced the geopark as a nationally protected area including a number of geological heri-

tage sites of particular importance (geosites), rarity or aesthetic appeal. A geopark attains 

its goals through conservation, education, and geotourism (UNESCO, 2006a). It is worth 

mentioning that in many cases, geoparks are not nationally protected areas which depend 

on the national laws for those territories.  

According to the European Geoparks Network (EGN) charter and Global Geoparks Net-

work regulations, geoparks should be established in rural areas (Zouros and Martini, 

2003); thus, geoparks and geotourism can be opportunities for rural development, as they 

can effectively reduce the rate of unemployment and migration in rural areas by creating 

innovative strategies for local development. UNESCO and National Geographic Traveler’s 

declaration illustrated that geotourism has opened a new gateway to rural development 

(Zouros, 2010; Farsani et al., 2011a). It may be said that geotourism encompasses rural 

tourism and sustains or even enhances the geological characteristics of a place. Further-

more, geotourism follows sustainability principles, and thus it can be said that geotourism 

is under the umbrella of sustainable tourism. Sustainability as a general concept for tour-

ism has three interconnected aspects: environmental, sociocultural, and economic 

(Cottrell et al., 2007). 

Geotourism and geoparks claim to promote the local economy by sustainable tourism 

(McKeever and Zouros, 2005). Geoparks, by increasing the number of tourists visiting 

well-structured geological attractions, play an important role in the development of the  

local economy. When geotourists move to geoparks, the money moves in the same direc-

tion, as if geoparks were in fact exporting something such as agricultural and local prod-

ucts to other places. Geoparks have to support the local commercial production. Thus, 

visitors to geoparks can actually take with them, together with emotions, experiences and 

knowledge, manufactured goods (Frey et al., 2006). Moreover, geoparks strive to involve 

local communities in new job opportunities and geo-marketing, such as geotours, geo-

products, geo-museums, geo-sports, geo-lodging, geo-restaurants and geo-bakeries.  

Geoparks aim to promote the local economy and public awareness about geology.  

Regarding this, development of geotours guided by local people can be a strategy towards 

entrepreneurship. Geotour guides visit natural scenic landforms and explain the surface 

and inner earth processes that have shaped them (Robinson, 2008). 

A geopark, besides tourism marketing, can successfully perform educational tasks for 

children including schoolchildren, and for local communities. The last but not the least of 

geopark targets is conservation. There is a direct relationship between geotourism and 

geoconservation; this relation directly influences the popularization of the geologic knowl-

edge, didactics and scientific studies in this domain, as well as recreation (Alexandrowicz, 

2006). 

Furthermore, geopark conservation indirectly influences the socioeconomic prosperity of 

local people in the countryside of the geopark. Indigenous knowledge of local people and 

their work force are two key components in implementation of conservation methods in 

geoparks.  

The major objective of this study is to investigate how geoparks and geotourism can  

contribute to sustainable tourism.  

This thesis aims to evaluate the role played by geoparks in the development of the local 

economy, and minimization of negative sociocultural and environmental impacts of tour-

ism. This is achieved by creating a positive upgrade in land management and planning for 

geoconservation and sustainable development of geological heritage.

Consequently, this thesis strives to identify geotourism and geoparks as a gateway and 

novel strategy for sociocultural, socio-environmental, and socioeconomic sustainability in 

rural areas. Moreover, this study has two more major purposes: 1) to determine the  

collaboration areas in Global Geoparks Network (GGN) and European Geoparks Network 

(EGN), and 2) to measure the degree of collaboration and cooperation among geoparks 

as geotourism destinations.  

Additionally, the author focuses on innovative strategies in geoparks around the world in 

order to introduce geotourism as a market that can provide unique experiences for visitors 

through initiatives. It is evident that geoparks offer different facilities to tourists that are 

never experienced in other tourist destinations. Therefore, geoparks are new tourism des-

tinations for geotravelers who want to know more about the earth where they live.  

 

1.2. Objectives and Methodology 

The research methodology for this study includes both primary and secondary research. A 

Combined method (qualitative and quantitative) was selected in this thesis. The first phase 

consists of an extensive literature review of existing reports on concepts of sustainable 

tourism, geotourism and geoparks. 

The main objective of the study presented in this survey is to seek how geoparks and 

geotourism can contribute to sustainable tourism (Figure 1.1).  

As illustrated in Figure 1.1, the objectives 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 and the hypotheses 3 and 7 

evaluate the socio-economical impacts of establishment of geoparks on rural development 

and development of geopark territories. Furthermore, objectives 1 and 4 and the hypothe-

ses 4, 6, and 9 strive to identify the innovative and novel strategies in geoparks for pro-

moting geotourism and attracting more tourists to these new destinations. The hypotheses 

5, 6 and 8 and the objective 4 inquiry the role of geoparks in cultural sustainability and 

also investigate the strategies which highlight rural identities. Moreover, the Objective 5 

and the hypotheses 1 and 2 examine the socio-environmental impacts of geoparks as  

another dimension of sustainable development.  Lastly, the objective 6 and the hypothe-

ses 1 and 2 evaluate the role played by tourism, especially geotourism, in achieving a bet-

ter quality of life and education for local population and in stimulating economic growth in 

geoparks territories.  

Observation was a technique used by author. Organizing field trips around the Naturtejo 

Geopark (Portugal), Arouca Geopark (Portugal) and Qeshm Geopark (Iran) helped the

researcher to gain more understanding of the terms geopark and geotourism and to 

achieve a new vision of geopark activities.  

It is noteworthy that travelling to all geoparks was expensive and time consuming, hence 

questionnaires were designed for data gathering. Data for this research were collected at 

two levels (international level and local level). Firstly, an electronic questionnaire sent to 

geoparks registered in UNESCO Global Geopark Networks; this questionnaire investi-

gated the new strategies, policy and activities of geoparks. Gathering international data 

was conducted in two phases, the first phase was from March 2009 to January 2010 and 

the second – which related to collaboration between geoparks – from October to Novem-

ber 2010. These phases can be a way to get experiences from different strategies in 

geoparks to find the best solution for amelioration of the case study.  

In the next phase the Qeshm Geopark (Iran) was selected as a case study and a ques-

tionnaire was designed for the local communities who live in the surrounding villages of 

Qeshm Geopark.  Interviews in face-to face format at local level were conducted from July 

to August 2009. The questionnaires aim at evaluating the economic problems in rural  

areas and the role played by Qeshm Geopark in the development of the local economy 

and minimization of negative sociocultural and environmental impacts of tourism in local 

communities.  

In this research the data was analysed using SPSS tools, NVivo, and Pajek software. 

Apart from quantitative and qualitative methods, SWOT analysis was applied to examine 

the strengths, opportunities, weaknesses and threats in the Qeshm Geopark territory.   

At the end I am expected to create a methodology concerning different stages to promote 

sustainable tourism in geopark.

1.3. Interest and Scope of the Thesis 

Nowadays tourists want to find out more about the outside world. They want to try out new 

experiences and increase their knowledge (Poon, 1993). It can be said that new frame-

work conditions such as airline deregulation, economic restructuring, environmental 

awareness, consumer protection, and the increased spread and flexibility of vacation 

days, are giving rise to a new tourism (Poon, 1993). 

In the last decade, geotourism has been introduced as a new niche market that shows 

travellers how to increase their awareness about natural resources and ways of preserv-

ing them by outdoor and recreational activities. In geoparks, tourists can see something 

different from other tourism activities. According to the National Geographic definition, 

“Geotourism is a market of about 55.1 million travelers who seek authentic experiences, 

care about the protection and preservation of the places they visit, and are willing to spend 

more money to achieve these goals. Average ages range from 43-55 years, average 

household incomes are high with 38-46% earning more than $75,000 annually, average 

number of leisure trips taken each year is 4 or more, and education levels are also high1”. 

Regarding their high education, geotourists require the opportunity to take advantage of 

educational and interpretative facilities provided by tourism organizations. Nowadays 

geoparks are ideal destinations for tourists, since, as a living outdoor museum and mes-

sengers of geotourism, they apply innovative strategies, which not only improve the local 

economy but also develop tourists’ knowledge. Moreover, involving indigenous people in 

local geotourism marketing helps to increase cultural communication between geotourists 

and local communities. This study introduces geoparks as new tourism destinations for 

those who are interested in local culture and natural sciences, in particular geosciences, 

and for those willing to learn more about their place in our dynamic earth.

1.4. Organization of the Thesis  
The thesis is divided into six chapters. The first chapter identifies the main objectives of 

the thesis; the methodology adopted to reach them; and the thesis’ organization. Chapter 

two begins with a description of sustainable tourism in order to identify principles and  

objectives of sustainable tourism. Section 2.4 focuses on emergence of geotourism mar-

keting. Section 2.5 discusses geopark concepts, theories and paradigms and their targets. 

The next section presents the comparison between geoparks and protected natural areas. 

Section 2.7 can provide a guideline for the proposed geoparks which want to become a 

Global Geoparks Member. And the eighth section discusses geo-products and branding in 

geotourism destinations such as geoparks. In this section through introduction of geo-

products in geoparks and various definitions of geo-products the author place emphasizes 

on her definition for geo-products. 

Sections 2.9, 2.10 and 2.11 provide an overview of the effect of establishment of geoparks 

on the local economy, cultural sustainability and socio-environmental sustainability. The 

last sections are a review of innovative strategies in geoparks and the importance of  

network activity as an innovative approach for rural development.  

Chapter three discusses methodology and techniques applied in the research. Chapter 

four, part one draws attention to geographical areas where the empirical study was con-

ducted. Innovative strategies, activities and geological characteristics of 29 geoparks that 

replied to the questionnaires are explained in this chapter. Moreover, chapter four, part 

two consists of analysis and discussion of findings of the empirical study. This chapter  

explores the effect of establishment of geoparks on cultural, socio- environmental and  

socio-economical sustainability. 

Chapter five deals with the characterization of the geographical area of the Qeshm Geo-

park as a case study. Detail description of the geological, ecological and cultural heritage 

of the case study is also organized in this chapter. It is noteworthy that experiences 

gained from two previous chapters and thoroughness of the case study helped us to  

design the SWOT matrices for Qeshm Geopark in section 5.1. 9. Furthermore, chapter 

five, part two investigates the effect of establishment of Qeshm Geopark on cultural,  

socio- environmental and socio-economical sustainability.  Lastly, chapter six focuses on a 

conclusion, and strives to recommend some guidelines for aspiring geoparks and better 

management of the case study. Moreover, chapter six introduces some future issues in 

geopark research.

2.1.  Introduction 

This chapter explains how the methodology of the literature review evolved. It provides an 

overview of sustainable tourism in order to identify principles and objectives of sustainable 

tourism; this chapter also describes the emergence of geotourism as a branch of sustain-

able tourism to discover the relationship between geotourism and the local economy in 

geoparks. Section 2.5 discusses the geopark concepts, theories and paradigms. The next 

section presents the comparison between geoparks and protected natural areas. Section 

2.7 highlights guidelines and criteria for proposed and aspiring geoparks which want to 

become a GGN (Global Geoparks Network) Member. Section 2.8 introduces geo-products 

as an innovation in geoparks. The next three sections summarize the effect of the  

establishment of geoparks on cultural sustainability, socioeconomic and socio-

environmental development in rural areas. Section 2.12 focuses on innovation in geoparks 

and section 2.13 indicates network activities as innovative approach in rural areas.  

 

2.2.  Methodology for Literature Review 

The first phase of this thesis consists of an extensive literature review of existing reports 

on geotourism and geopark activities.  

Open Innovation (i.e. innovation inside and outside the firm’s frontiers, with external part-

nerships or outsourcing) is a recent topic in academic studies.  At the end of 2010, with a 

view to doing literature review, first, the author performed an in-depth review of Open  

Innovation (OI) papers published in quoted scientific journals in the last ten years. The  

author used as search parameters keywords such as geopark, geotourism, rural tourism, 

sustainable tourism, socioeconomic development, sociocultural development. She started 

by performing the literature review as follows:   

• Individual search in scientific databases, e.g. Elsevier (Science Direct) and ISI Web 

of knowledge 

• Search on Google Scholar  

Results for ISI Web of Knowledge (by end of 2010) obtained 33 papers for geoparks and 

21 papers for geotourism (Table 2.1).

Moreover, the author used the analysis function available in ISI Current Contents to per-

form descriptive statistics on the papers. The results present information on years of pub-

lications (Tables 2.2 and 2.3). The results indicated that the majority of the papers about 

geoparks or geotourism were published in 2009.  

The results demonstrate that the topic is new and geoparks and geotourism are new  

subjects recently; so geopark activities have not been studied thoroughly yet.  

Following web sites, publications, and centres (UNESCO Global Geopark Network, Euro-

pean Geopark Network, UNESCO, National Geography, Online library of  universities, the 

web sites of geoparks, library of University of Aveiro, monthly newsletter of Naturtejo

played an important role in contributing to the collection of information for this thesis. The

2.3.  Sustainable Tourism Concept   

A rapid increase in per capita income and leisure time, and advances in technology have 

led to increased demands for recreation and holidays for a considerable number of people 

all over the world. Inevitably, such large-scale tourism activity has both positive and nega-

tive consequences for the economy, environment, and the society of the host destinations. 

Therefore, tourism has been referred to as a ‘revolution’. On the positive side, tourism is 

considered a tool of economic regeneration, a means for heritage and environment  

preservation and citizens’ awareness, the creation of infrastructure and equipment, cul-

tural communication, and political stability. On the other hand, since the tourism product is 

consumed in the same place as its production, tourism development has come under  

criticism for various social and environmental strains experienced by host destinations and 

populations, such as environmental degradation, cultural pollution, commercialization of 

human relations and negative demonstration effects (Andriotis, 2000). In this regard, the 

term ‘sustainable tourism’ originated from the general concept of ‘sustainable develop-

ment’ which ‘meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future 

generations to meet their own needs’ introduced by Brundtland in 1987 (Beeton et al., 

2007).  

Sustainability as a general concept for tourism, as for other industries, has three intercon-

nected aspects: environmental, sociocultural, and economic. Sustainability implies perma-

nence, so sustainable tourism includes the optimum use of resources, including  

biological diversity, minimization of ecological, cultural, and social impacts, and maximiza-

tion of benefits for the conservation of natural and cultural heritage and local communities. 

It also refers to the management structures that are needed to achieve this.  

Following the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 and the growing realization of the importance of a 

sustainable approach to tourism development, a number of international organizations  

began efforts to develop principles to guide the development of sustainable tourism. In 

1995, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the United Nations Educa-

tional Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the European Union (EU) and the 

World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) organized a world conference on sustainable  

tourism in Lanzarote, Canary Islands (Spain). The conference produced the first agree-

ment on how sustainable tourism should be developed. The Lanzarote Charter for  

Sustainable Tourism (1995) defined 18 principles, which in turn define how tourism should 

be developed and it has been the basis for much work that has been done since then. The 

18 principles and objectives of the Declaration are as follows: (UNEP, 1995). 



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

13 

1. Tourism development shall be based on criteria of sustainability, which means it 

must be ecologically bearable in the long term, economically viable, as well as 

ethically and socially equitable for local communities. Sustainable development is 

a guided process, which envisages global management of resources so as to  

ensure their viability, thus enabling our natural and cultural capital to be preserved. 

As a powerful instrument of development, tourism can and should participate  

actively in the sustainable development strategy. A requirement of sound man-

agement of tourism is that the sustainability of the resources on which it depends 

must be guaranteed. 

2. The sustainable nature of tourism should integrate the natural, cultural and human 

environment; it must respect the fragile balances in many tourist destinations, in 

particular many small islands and environmentally sensitive areas. Tourism should  

ensure an acceptable evolution as regards the influence of the activity on natural 

resources, biodiversity and the capacity for assimilation of any impacts and  

residues produced. 

3. Tourism must consider its effects on the cultural heritage and traditional elements, 

activities and dynamics of each local community. Recognition of the traditional 

elements and activities of each local community and support for its identity, culture 

and interests must at all times play a central role in the formulation of tourism 

strategies, particularly in developing countries. 

4. The active contribution of tourism to sustainable development necessarily presup-

poses the solidarity, mutual respect, and participation of all the actors implicated in 

the process, especially those indigenous to the locality. Solidarity, mutual respect 

and participation must be based on efficient cooperation mechanisms at all levels: 

local, national, regional, and international. 

5. The conservation, protection, and appreciation of the worth of our natural and cul-

tural resources afford a privileged area for cooperation. This approach implies that 

all those responsible must take upon themselves a true challenge, that of cultural 

and professional innovation, and must also undertake a major effort  

to create integrated planning and management instruments. This approach must 

ensure that all responsible actors have instruments of cooperation and manage-

ment integrated, including technological innovation. 

6. In consultation with interested and affected parties, the preservation of both the 

quality of the tourist destination, and the capacity to satisfy tourists should be  



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

14 

determined by local communities and should represent priority objectives in the 

formulation of tourism strategies and projects. 

7. To be compatible with sustainable development, tourism must be based on the  

diversity of opportunities offered by its local economy. It should be fully integrated 

into and contribute positively to the local economic development. 

8. All options for tourism development must serve effectively to improve the quality of 

life of all people and must entail a positive effect and inter-relation. 

9. Governments and authorities shall promote actions for integrating the planning of 

tourism with environmental NGOs and local communities to achieve sustainable 

development. 

10.  In recognition of the objective of economic and social cohesion among the people 

of the world as a fundamental principle of sustainable development, it is urgent that 

measures be developed to permit a more equitable distribution of the benefits and  

burdens of tourism. This implies a change of consumption patterns and the intro-

duction of ecologically honest pricing. Governments and multilateral organizations 

are called upon to abandon subsidies that have negative effects on the environ-

ment, and they are furthermore called upon to explore the application of interna-

tionally harmonized economic instruments to ensure the sustainable use of all  

resources. 

11. Environmentally and culturally vulnerable spaces, both now and in the future, shall 

be given special priority in the matter of technical cooperation and financial aid for 

sustainable tourism development. Similarly, special treatment should be given to 

spaces that have been degraded by obsolete and high impact tourism models. 

Tourism should be spread over a greater part of the calendar year. There is also a 

need to explore further the usefulness of economic instruments at the  

regional/local levels, with a view to ensuring the sustainable use of all resources. 

The importance of legal instruments must be developed. 

12. The promotion of alternative forms of tourism compatible with the principles of sus-

tainable development and the encouragement of diversification help guarantee 

medium- and long-term sustainability. In this respect, there is a need, for many 

small islands and environmentally sensitive areas in particular, to actively pursue 

and strengthen regional cooperation. 

  



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

15 

13. Governments, authorities, and NGOs with responsibility for tourism and the envi-

ronment shall promote and participate in the creation of open networks for informa-

tion, research, dissemination, and transfer of appropriate tourism and environ-

mental knowledge on tourism and environmentally sustainable technologies. 

14. There is a need to support and promote feasibility studies, vigorously applied  

scientific field work, the implementation of tourism demonstration projects within 

the framework of sustainable development, the development of programs in the 

field of international cooperation, and the introduction of environmental manage-

ment systems. 

15. Authorities and associations with responsibility for tourism development, and envi-

ronmental NGOs shall draw up frameworks for sustainable tourism development 

and will establish programs to support the implementation of such practice. They 

shall monitor achievements, report on results, and exchange their experiences. 

16. Attention should be given to the role and environmental effects of transportation in 

tourism, and economic instruments should be developed and implemented in order 

to reduce the use of non-renewable energy. 

17. The adoption of, adherence to, and implementation of codes of conduct conducive 

in the context of sustainable development by the principal actors, particularly  

industry members, involved in tourism are fundamental for tourism to be sustain-

able. Such codes constitute efficient instruments for the development of  

responsible tourist activities. 

18. All necessary measures should be implemented in order to sensitize and inform all 

the parties involved in the tourism industry.  

To support the integration of sustainability into tourism policies, UNEP (United Nations 

Environment Programme) and the World Tourism Organization (WTO) conducted  

research on approaches and tools for the development and implementation of sustainable 

tourism policies, which have shown them to be effective in practice. Sustainable tourism is 

often equated with nature tourism or ecotourism; but sustainable tourism development 

means more than protecting the natural environment. It means proper consideration of 

host people, communities, cultures, customs, lifestyles, and social and economic systems. 

It is tourism that enhances the material life of local communities, without causing a loss of 

traditional employment systems, acculturation, or social disruption.  

 



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

16 

Drost (1996) discussed how sustainable tourism development would entail the adoption of 

planning strategies to mitigate the negative impact of tourism without sacrificing its bene-

fits. He believes that educating and raising people’s awareness of the physical and  

sociocultural environment are fundamental for achieving sustainable development. It is 

noteworthy that education is equally necessary for the host population and governments, 

and if it is to be effective, it should include periodic educational workshops and sharing of  

experiences and knowledge among countries regarding their respective approaches to 

controlling the negative impact of tourism. Sustainable tourism should not be regarded as 

a rigid framework, but rather as an adaptive paradigm, which legitimizes a variety of  

approaches according to specific circumstances.  

Moreover, sustainable tourism is not achievable in the absence of strong local authority 

planning and development control, and without the involvement of local communities in 

the planning process (Hunter, 1997). Godfrey (1998) noted that to achieve sustainability, 

local government requires less emphasis on short-term economics, with greater recogni-

tion of the social and environmental implications of the industry, and that local government 

should support the integration of tourism interests within the context of all local socioeco-

nomic development, rather than as a unique or isolated activity.     

The World Tourism Organization (1998) defined ‘sustainable tourism’, as the tourism  

development that meets the needs of present tourists and host regions, while protecting 

and enhancing opportunities for the future leading to management of all resources, in 

such a way that economic, social, and aesthetic needs can be fulfilled while maintaining 

cultural integrity, essential ecological processes, biological diversity, and life support  

systems (Byrd, 2007: 9). The evolution of the sustainable tourism concept is illustrated in 

Figure 2.1.

Figure 2.1- The evolution of the sustainable tourism concept  

(Source: Hunter, 2006) 

It must be mentioned that the appearance of a journal (Journal of Sustainable Tourism) 

devoted to sustainable tourism topics is a sizeable body of literature which publishes the 

recent definitions and state-of-the-art reviews related to sustainable tourism (Butler, 1999). 

Many authors and practitioners promote ecotourism, alternative tourism, responsible  

tourism, soft tourism, low-impact tourism, community tourism, and so on, as the path to 

sustainable tourism development (Liu, 2003). Jafari’s ‘platform’ model named 4 key  

platforms (advocacy, cautionary, adaptancy and knowledge-based) to provide a useful 

framework for understanding the emergence and development of sustainable tourism 

(Jafari, 1989; 2001). There are seven steps towards tourism sustainability: understanding 

complex adaptive systems; learning from natural ecosystems; co-evolution of human and 

natural systems; extending tourism systems; integration; adding post-normal science; and 

facilitating a transition (Farrell, 2005).   

Byrd (2007) argued for several indicators (stakeholder knowledge, perceived impacts of 

tourism development, support for tourism development, resident population demograph-

ics, attendance numbers at attractions, occupancy rate, host community attitudes toward 

tourism development, resident involvement in tourism development, local resident partici-

pation in planning, and availability of a resident advisory board) which can be used for 

stakeholder participation in a community. Governments must communicate with the local 

population and involve them in planning and management decisions while offering a fair 

distribution of the benefits and cost among the full range of stakeholders (Yasarata et al., 



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

18 

2010). Local communities must be engaged in each stage of the development process: 

planning, implementing and monitoring (Choi and Murray, 2010; Whitford and Ruhanen, 

2010).  

In addition, Liu (2003) noted that there are interrelationships between tourism, the envi-

ronment, and the local community. The traditional sustainable development paradigm  

contains economic, ecological, and sociocultural dimensions. The economic dimension 

satisfies the primary needs of humans and implies that the economy supports employment 

and livelihoods on a competitive and stable macroeconomic scale. The ecological dimen-

sion characterizes the need to utilize the environment within ecological limits. The  

social-cultural dimension (i.e., individuals’ skills, dedication, and experiences) meets indi-

viduals’ needs to live a dignified and healthy life.  

These three dimensions cannot be disassociated from a fourth institutional dimension that 

emphasizes participatory decision-making processes and public involvement (Figure 2.2). 

This dimension refers to the level of public participation in political governance.

Successful sustainable tourism requires an integrated vision of policy, planning, and man-

agement within the institutional context. Although the institutional component has received 

the least attention of the three classic dimensions, Cottrell et al. (2007) have found that all 

four dimensions contribute to attracting residents’ satisfaction, with the institutional dimen-

sion explaining the greatest percentage of variance for residents’ satisfaction with tourism. 

Moreover, the participation of a community in local tourism stimulates locals through 

arousing a feeling of belonging to that place and making them feel responsible for main-

taining their cultural heritage (Botelho da Costa and Nascimento, 2008). 

Recently, network activity as an innovation in sustainable tourism planning has been 

shown to bring certain benefits to all stakeholders. The experiences of Jennings and 

Zandbergen (1995) illustrated that individual stakeholders contribute less to environmental 

sustainability than networks of agents. According to Bramwell and Sharman (1999) coop-

eration and collaboration are recognized as major aspects in tourism planning and are 

linked to the idea of sustainable tourism development. Policy networks include two forms 

(vertical or horizontal). Agencies organized at the same level are classified into horizontal 

networks, while, relationships between different levels of government (local, regional, and 

national) are formed in vertical networks (Hall, 1999). Networks of collaboration are key 

components in environmental management (Robert and Simpsone, 1999). The experi-

ences of Dredge (2006) in Lake Macquarie (Australia) illustrated that in network activities, 

stakeholders can have membership of more than one network and stakeholder powers, 

roles, interactions and functions may become stronger. Moreover, collaboration in the 

form of a network creates opportunities for communication, for dialogue, for the develop-

ment of new ideas, and for the translation of ideas into practice. Erku?-Öztürk and Eraydin 

(2010) noted that collaborative work in the form of networking and local collaboration in 

Antalya (Turkey) has provided more protection than individual organizations (Figure 2.3).

Figure 2.3- Governance networks observed in environmentally sustainable tourism  

(Source: Erku?-Öztürk and Eraydin, 2010: 115) 

Each type of network has strengths and weaknesses in promoting sustainable tourism. 

The experiences of Beaumont and Dredge (2010) in Redland City Council (Australia) illus-

trated that different types of networks can be more or less effective in achieving good local 

tourism governance. 

Recently, the gap between local communities and tourists has decreased; many commu-

nities in tourism destinations have organized themselves in defence of their cultural and 

natural heritage. At the head of these, the EUROPARC Federation defined the European 

Charter for Sustainable Tourism in Protected Areas (1994). This charter provided an  

opportunity for network activity, making new ideas, conservation of the environment and 

heritage, economic and social development, preservation and improvement of the quality 

of life of local residents and visitor management, and enhancement of the quality of  

tourism offered (EUROPARC Federation, 2007). 

According to Woodley (1993:94), sustainable tourism in parks must primarily be defined in 

terms of sustainable ecosystems. Complexity of the protected area system (local-to-global 

impacts), structure and forms of partnerships/collaboration, with particular focus on sus-

tainability and stakeholders and the issue of representing nature in planning and negotia-



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

21 

tion, are three aspects which are important for the development of tourism in protected 

areas (Jamal and Stronza, 2009). 

Subsequent to the European Charter, the European Geoparks Network (EGN) and the 

United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), through  

creating a worldwide network of geoparks, take advantage of networks of collaboration in  

environmental management. The geopark as a new form of sustainable development and 

as a new model of protected area not only strives to popularize geological and geomor-

phological heritage, but also stimulates local socioeconomic development through the  

promotion of geotourism as a branch of sustainable tourism.  

Nowadays, geoparks as an innovation try to connect conservation, education, and geot-

ourism. Regarding this, a geopark, besides tourism marketing, can successfully perform 

educational tasks. There is a direct relation between geotourism and geoconservation; this 

relation directly influences the popularization of geological knowledge, didactics and scien-

tific studies in this domain, as well as recreation (Alexandrowicz, 2006). It is worth  

mentioning that education on nature in geoparks, especially for schoolchildren, is very  

important for the development of the supportive local and regional community in the  

future.  

 

2.4.  The Emergence of Geotourism  

Geotourism, which was introduced publicly in 2002 by the Travel Industry Association of 

America and National Geographic Traveller Magazine, incorporates sustainability princi-

ples (Alan, 2002). They introduced geotourism as tourism that sustains, or even  

enhances, the geographical character of a place, such as its culture, environment,  

heritage, and the well-being of its residents (Tourtellot, 2000: 2). 

In 1997, National Geographic senior editor Jonathan B. Tourtellot and his wife, Sally  

Bensusen, coined the term geotourism in response to requests for a term and concept 

more encompassing than ecotourism and sustainable tourism (Figure 2.4). Like ecotour-

ism, geotourism promotes a virtuous circle, whereby tourism revenues provide a local  

incentive to protect what tourists are coming to see, but extends the principle beyond  

nature and ecology to incorporate all characteristics that contribute to a sense of place, 

such as historic structures, traditional culture, landscapes, cuisine, arts and artistry, as 

well as local flora and fauna.

22 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

Figure 2.4- Geotourism model (Source: National Geographic, 2005) 

 

Therefore, geotourism manages to protect all aspects of a tourist destination such as: flora 

and fauna, history, archaeology, geology, traditional architecture, local music, cuisine,  

local crafts, and arts (National Geographic, 2005 and 2009). 

Tourtellot’s definition of geotourism is not entirely original, but evolved from the previous 

concept of sustainable development, sustainable tourism, and ecotourism. Geotourism 

differentiates itself from ecotourism through focusing on the geological and geomor-

phological character of a region while many of ecotourism’s definitions limit ecotourism to 

only occurring in protected or natural areas and are mainly related to biodiversity.  

Since geotourism is a niche market, it tends to be small and specialized; this market  

includes less impact, and interests visitors who seek a specific experience, activity and 

place. Therefore geotourism is less likely to negatively impact the area (Gorman, 2007).   

National Geographic (2009) noted that geotourism adds to sustainability principles, its 

"sense of place", to emphasize the distinctiveness of its locale and benefit visitor and  

resident alike:  

• Geotourism is synergistic: all the elements of geographical character work  
together to create a tourist experience that is richer than the sum of its parts,  

appealing to visitors with diverse interests.

• It involves the community: local businesses and civic groups join to provide a 
distinctive, authentic visitor experience. 

• It informs both visitors and hosts: residents discover their own heritage by 
learning that things they take for granted may be interesting to outsiders. As local 

people develop pride and skills in showing off their locale, tourists get more out of 

their visit. 

• It benefits residents economically: geotourism benefits travel businesses, local 
workers, local services, products, and supplies. When community members under-

stand the benefits of geotourism, they take responsibility for destination steward-

ship. 

• It supports integrity of place: destination-savvy travellers seek out businesses 

that emphasize the character of the locale. In return, local stakeholders who  

receive economic benefits appreciate and protect the value of those assets. 

• It means great trips: enthusiastic visitors bring home new knowledge. Their  
stories encourage friends and relatives to experience the same thing, which brings 

continuing business for the destination. 

The first definition of geotourism as ‘geological tourism’ was published by Hose (1995, 

2000). According to S?omka and Kicinska- ?widerska (2004), in Poland geotourism is a 

branch of cognitive tourism or adventure tourism which emphasize geological objects 

(geosites) and recognition of geological process. Some new terms in geotourism such as 

geotouristic objects (geosites); geotouristic events; and geotouristic attractions were also 

introduced (S?omka et al., 2006; S?omka and Mayer, 2010). Rybár (2006) recommended 

geotourism with accent on mining tourism. He believes that mining tourism has positive 

social and economic impacts on the former and old European mining regions. Subse-

quently, the first definition of geotourism was refined by Dowling and Newsome (2006), 

and Newsome and Dowling (2010).  

Hose (2008) noted that the term geotourism passed into general usage in the early 1990s, 

although its past history dates back to the seventeenth century. Its resource base includes 

geosites, museums, library and archive collections and artistic outputs. 

According to Dowling and Newsome (2006) geotourism encompasses wider geographical, 

socioeconomic and cultural contexts which sit under the umbrella of geographical tourism.  

It is evident that geographic tourism involves geotourism as a target of geoparks (Figure 

2.5). It is worth mentioning that the conceptualization of geotourism was improved in the 



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

24 

book titled: “Geotourism: sustainability, impacts and management” (Dowling and 

Newsome, 2006). In this book geotourism was conceptualized into a three-sided box: geo-

logical form, process, and tourism. Moreover, geotourism involves visits to geosites for the 

purpose of recreation, engaging a sense of wonder and learning. 

After that, Newsome and Dowling (2010) discussed the relation between geotourism and 

other forms of tourism. Figure 2.6 illustrates a particularly strong relationship between 

ecotourism and geotourism (dotted and thick line). This definition, like the National Geo-

graphic definition, includes ecotourism and cultural tourism, but the emphasis of Newsome 

and Dowling’s (2010) definition is on geology.  

A list of different geotourism definitions is presented in Table 2.4. The lack of a common 

unifying definition for geotourism signifies only that geotourism is an interdisciplinary 

knowledge still at the very beginning.

Table 2.4 - Definitions of geotourism from 2000 

Geotourism is “tourism that sustains, or even enhances, the geographical character of a place, 
such as its culture, environment, heritage, and the wellbeing of its residents. The concept was in-
troduced publicly in a 2002 report by the Travel Industry Association of America and National Geo-
graphic Traveler magazine (Tourtellot, 2000: 2). 

Geotourism is an emerging niche market within sustainable tourism and is centered on sustaining 
and enhancing the geographical character of a place (Stokes et al., 2003:1). 

Geotourism may constitute a segment of ecotourism, which is “a sustainable form of natural re-
source-based tourism that focuses primarily on experiencing and learning about nature, and which 
is ethically managed to be low-impact, non-consumptive, and locally oriented (control, benefits and 
scale). It typically occurs in natural areas, and should contribute to the conservation or preservation 
of such areas (Fennell 2003: 32). 

Geotourism is not a new definition, but simply a way of combining developing concepts of sustain-
ability accounting with developing concepts of tourism market segmentation (Buckley, 2003: 76-
82).   

Geotourism will be identified as a branch of geology, important for the development of the national 
economy (Hose, 2000; S?omka, and Kici?ska-?widerska, 2004). 

 



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism

Table 2.4 - Definitions of geotourism from 2000 (cont.) 

Geotourism is a multi-interest kind of tourism exploiting natural sites and landscapes containing 
interesting earth-science features in a didactic and entertaining way (Pralong, 2006:20-25). 

According to Frey 1998, geotourism means interdisciplinary cooperation within an economic, suc-
cess-oriented and fast-moving discipline that speaks its own language (Frey et al., 2006: 97). 

Geotourism is a new occupational and business sector. The main tasks of geotourism are the 
transfer and communication of geo-scientific knowledge and ideas to the general public (Frey et al., 
2006: 97). 

Geotourism is sustainable tourism with a primary focus on experiencing the Earth’s geological fea-
tures in a way that fosters environmental and cultural understanding, appreciation and conserva-
tion, and is locally beneficial (Dowling and Newsome, 2006: 3-25). 

Geotourism comprises the geological elements of ‘form and process’ combined with the compo-
nents of tourism such as attractions, accommodation, tours, activities, interpretation and planning 
and management (James and Hose, 2008: 199-208). 

In 2008, the Travel Industry Association declared that Geotourism celebrates sense of place while 
supporting principals of conservation related to a destination’s natural resources, culture, heritage 
and traditions. It incorporates travel sectors such as lodging, shopping, entertainment, dining, and 
touring when they provide and promote authentic experiences distinctive to the character of the 
locale, and do so in a way that benefits the local community (Miller and Washington, 2009: 170-
172). 

Geotourism is a form of natural area tourism that specifically focuses on geology and landscape. It 
promotes tourism to geosites and the conservation of geodiversity and an understanding of Earth 
sciences through appreciation and learning. This is achieved through independent visits to geologi-
cal features, use of geo-trails and view points, guided tours, geo-activities and patronage of geosite 
visitor centres (Newsome and Dowling, 2010: 4-5). 

 

This study employs the last four definitions of geotourism to discover the innovative 

strategies and novel trends in travel to geoparks and rural development. 

Aside from geoparks, which are under the umbrella of UNESCO, National Geographic 

also introduces some geotourism destinations around the world. In July 2008, five U.S. 

government agencies joined the National Geographic Society to formally adopt the princi-

ples of geotourism (Moffet and Moody, 2008). In December 2005, the states of Arizona in 

the United States and Sonora, Mexico, signed a National Geographic Geotourism Charter 

in order to promote sustainable tourism and destination stewardship in the Sonoran  

Desert region. This project included preparing a Geotourism map guide and an associated 

website for two geotourism products that encompassed both cultural and environmental 

concerns in order to introduce the natural phenomena to tourists. This was the fourth 

Geotourism Charter issued worldwide and the first transnational effort undertaken by the 

National Geographic Society. In The First Transnational Geotourism Project, they decided 



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

27 

to establish a Geotourism Council. The Council would lead a bi-national grassroots effort 

to develop a regional map guide, promote the tenets of geotourism, and encourage desti-

nation stewardship in the region (Murrieta et al., 2005). 

National Geographic’s ambition is to protect distinctive travel regions of the world through 

a type of tourism that focuses on destination stewardship. Their tools for preserving these 

regions are geotourism map guides. These geotourism map guides are a hybrid cross  

between guidebooks and road maps. Instead of reading a guidebook and map separately, 

the map guides spatially represent the unique tourism destinations of a region by overlay-

ing destination information on top of a relief map of the region. These maps  

provide tourists with information on historic sites, cultural sites, accommodation, hikes, 

and many other types of information, allowing the tourist an opportunity to experience 

what makes the region special (Boley, 2009). Bosak et al. (2010) noted that geotourism 

map guides, such as the Crown of the Continent, constitute a useful tool to promote a 

more responsible form of tourism and allow visitors to have easier access to the distinctive 

features of the region. 

Other existing charters include Norway, Honduras, Romania, the Cook Islands, Califor-

nia's Redwood Coast, Portugal's Douro Valley, Montreal, Greater Yellowstone, Baja Cali-

fornia, Sierra Nevada, and Guatemala (Claude Joly, 2009; Dion et al., 2009;  

National Geographic, 2010; Sejvar et al., 2010). Honduras was the first country to make 

geotourism its national tourism strategy (National Geographic, 2005). 

Nowadays, the Center for Sustainable Destinations (CSD) seeks to help individual places 

to use the geotourism approach to improve stewardship and attract the most beneficial 

and least disruptive forms of tourism. Regarding this, CSD works with a community-based  

local geotourism alliance to create a co-branded National Geographic map (geotourism 

map guides) that highlights the natural, historical, and cultural assets unique to a destina-

tion. Until 2010, CSD prepared the geotourism map guides for the North California Coast, 

Central Cascades, Montreal, Arizona/Sonora, Baja California, Crown of the Continent, 

Greater Yellowstone, Guatemala, Peru and Vermont.  

Moreover, CSD launched geotourism projects in Romania, Norway, Rhode Island and 

Honduras to introduce geotourism opportunities in these territories.  

Brozinski (2009) discussed the main difference between Popularization of Geology (PoG) 

and geotourism. Basically, the data in PoG and geotourism is the same, but PoG only 

goes as far as educating people about geology, while geotourism has an effect on the  

local economy.

Boley (2009) suggested a Geotourism Survey Instrument (GSI) to study the presence of 

geotravellers’ behaviour in geotourism destinations such as the Crown of the Continent 

region of Montana, United States of America, and Canada. He focused on four measured 

dimensions of geotourism (culture-heritage, environment, aesthetics, and well-being of 

locals). It is worth mentioning that these dimensions were derived from the introduction to 

geotourism by National Geographic. A six-point scale was used to evaluate the geotravel-

lers’ behaviour in these territories. In this survey the mean scores ranged from 5.4 to 4.2, 

indicating a high agreement with the overall values of geotourism.  

Nickerson (2010) used quantitative research methods for the study of tourist behaviour in 

Montana as a geotourism destination in the United States of America, to introduce geot-

ourism as a basis for infrastructure planning in this territory. 

In addition, Boyle and Nickerson (2010) used the Geotourism Survey Instrument (GSI) 

method in order to study demographics, geotraveller scores, and travel behaviour  

comparisons. Moreover, this study aimed to identify the important attributes for geotravel-

lers, segmenting the geotravellers, and travel expenditures for geotravellers in Montana. 

284 questionnaire forms filled in by vacation visitors were collected from 40 survey sites. 

On the basis of the results of this research, daily expenditures for the three distinct groups 

–strong geotraveller, moderate geotraveller and non-geotraveller – are differentiated. 

Strong geotravellers spent an average of 141.79 dollars more per day while the moderate 

geotraveller spent almost 134.10 dollars per day, and the non-geotraveler spent 109.15 

dollars.  

The geotourism definition by National Geographic and several studies related to this defi-

nition demonstrate the difference between the National Geographic Society definition and 

that of geoparks. The definition adopted by the National Geographic Society is now under 

discussion by the European Geoparks Network. In a geopark, geotourism must have a 

strong emphasis on geological heritage.  

The following definition (Newsome and Dowling, 2010) is the most recent definition of 

geotourism which includes the wider aspects of tourist activity: “Geotourism is a form of 

natural area tourism that specifically focuses on geology and landscape. It promotes tour-

ism to geosites and the conservation of geodiversity and an understanding of earth  

sciences through appreciation and learning. This is achieved through independent visits to 

geological features, use of geo-trails and view points, guided tours, geo-activities and  

patronage of geosite visitor centres”. 



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

29 

According to Carvalho and Rodrigues (2010a), geotourism is not just organizing tourism in 

geoparks (Figure 2.7); it involves seven elements that must be always in close connection 

in a geopark, such as geological heritage, other heritage, tourist facilities, education,  

interpretation, geoconservation and local development, for tourism diversification of the 

territory.   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 2.7- Geotourism-related elements for tourism diversification 

(Source: Carvalho and Rodrigues, 2010a) 

 

Gray (2008) believes that one of the most popular geotourism locations in the world is the 

Grand Canyon. The Grand Canyon applies to the diversity of the strata in the walls of the 

canyon in terms of rock colours and resistance to erosion, and the diversity of the slope 

morphologies and processes, besides the comprehensive geological history of the last 

2000 million years that is enclosed in the rocks and landscape. Besides, many sports and 

leisure pursuits such as rock climbing also depend on geodiversity in this area.   

Heggie (2009) pointed out that volcano tourism and travel to geothermal destinations are 

prominently under the umbrella of geotourism. In 2008, 2.3 million tourists visited the  

active volcanic features in the Hawaii, 4.2 million visited the geysers and hot springs of 

Yellowstone National Park and National Park in Arkansas, and 415,000  

visited Oregon’s Crater Lake National Park. The geothermal and volcanic activity at  

Rotorua, New Zealand, Mount Etna in Italy, Japan’s Mount Fuji, Mount Tungurahua in  

Ecuador, Villarrica Volcano in Chile, the volcanic island of Sicily, like Stromboli, and  



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

30 

Iceland’s active volcanoes are other popular destinations for volcano tourists. In addition,  

local houses for rent to tourists in the Azores, “Volcano watching” for tourists visiting  

Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Teide Volcanoes National Park and tourists visiting 

Mammoth Mountain, a dormant volcano and popular recreation destination in the United 

States, are further names in geotourism marketing. 

Furthermore, Erfurt-Cooper and Cooper (2010) introduced volcano geothermal systems 

as sustainable geo-resources for leisure and recreation. They noted that active lava flows, 

Strombolian eruptions, geysers and hot springs, lava lakes, crater lakes, boiling ponds, 

fumaroles and vents, boiling mud pools, hot rivers and streams, and sinter terraces are 

ten top attractions in volcanic and geothermal destinations.  

Thus, geological heritage sites can generate employment and new economic activities, 

especially in rural regions in need of new or additional sources of income (El Wartiti et al., 

2009). In this regard, geological landscapes that draw visitors to Ireland and Britain  

support a thriving tourist industry. For instance, the Dinosaur Coast Project has marketed 

geology directly to tourists (McKeever et al., 2006). Moreover, Ireland ran a project sup-

ported by the local authorities, the Geological Survey of Ireland, the Geological Survey of 

Northern Ireland, and the University of Ulster, to discover the role of geotourism in sup-

porting regeneration in disadvantaged rural communities in Ireland (O'Connor, 2008). 

Tourism marketing in the Lake Constance region, which is situated in Germany, Switzer-

land, and Austria near the Alps, is in need of innovation to fulfil the increasing demand of 

tourists and consumers or customers in the long run. To this end, they have  

introduced geotourism as a successful marketing policy for developing the Lake  

Constance area (Gerner et al., 2009). 

The development of the European Geoparks Network and the UNESCO Geoparks  

Program are providing models for engaging the public in the appreciation of geology that 

links sustainable economic development with the preservation and interpretation of geol-

ogy (Miller, 2008). The geopark concept has been developed in recent years with the  

intention of promoting economic development through geotourism based on the geological  

resources of the territory (Gray, 2004, 2008). Fassoulas and Zouros (2010) noted that  

geoparks especially act for the benefit of local communities through the development of 

geotourism and educational activities in rural areas.  

 

 



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

31 

2.5.  Geoparks: Concepts, Theories and Paradigms 

Patzak and Eder (1998: 33-34) argued for the definition of a geopark as a territory com-

prising a number of protected geological heritage sites of special geological significance, 

rarity or beauty. These geological features are representative of a region and its geologi-

cal history, events and processes. Comparable to a natural park, a geopark falls under the 

authority of the government in the country where it is situated. Geoparks are of particular 

value for education, science, culture and socioeconomic development (mainly through 

tourism). According to the EGN and UNESCO’s recommendations, the criteria for the  

development of a geopark include (UNESCO, 2006b):   

• Size and setting: a geopark candidate seeking network membership must have 
enough surface area in order to serve local economic and cultural development 

(mainly through tourism), including sites of ecological, archaeological, historical or 

cultural value. 

• Management and local involvement: success in geopark management can only 
be achieved through strong local involvement. The initiative to create a geopark 

must come from local communities/authorities with a strong commitment to de-

velop and implement a management plan that meets the economic needs of the 

local population, whilst protecting the (geological) landscape in which they live. 

• Economic development: one of the main strategic objectives of a geopark is to 
stimulate economic activity and sustainable development. A geopark seeking 

UNESCO's assistance serves to foster socioeconomic development that is cultur-

ally and environmentally sustainable. This has a direct impact on the area involved 

by improving human living conditions and the rural environment. 

• Education: a geopark must provide and organize support, tools and activities to 

communicate geo-scientific knowledge and environmental concepts to the public; 

all educational activities should reflect the ethical considerations around holistic 

environmental protection. 

• Protection and conservation: a geopark contributes to the conservation of  
significant geological features. 

• Global Network: The Global Network of National Geoparks provides a platform of 
cooperation and exchange between experts and practitioners in geological  

heritage matters. 



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

32 

The aforementioned criteria indicate that geoparks have three main targets: conservation, 

education and promoting local economy through geotourism. In order to achieve these 

goals, geoparks try to take advantage of network activities, the knowledge and workforce 

of locals. 

Jones (2008) argued that the philosophy behind the geopark concept was first introduced 

at the Digne Convention in 1991.  

The planned name “reserve” was changed to “geopark” based on the Decision of Earth 

Sciences of UNESCO in 1997. After that, the European Geoparks Network was estab-

lished in 2000 as an international LEADER Program activity (Zouros and Martini, 2003). 

The European Geopark Network was set up by four regions of different European Coun-

tries — France, Germany, Spain and Greece — with similar natural and socioeconomic 

characteristics. These four regions are rural areas, with a particular geological heritage, 

natural beauty, and high cultural potential, all facing problems of slow economic develop-

ment, unemployment, and a high level of emigration. Faced with these problems, the 

managing authorities of the geological parks and museums in these regions decided to 

strengthen their collaboration, and as a result the European Geoparks Network was estab-

lished, although UNESCO gave no financial backing to the four countries (Zouros, 2004; 

Zouros, and Mckeever, 2009). 

The main characteristic of the European Geoparks Network is that it works as a network of 

collaborating areas, rather than a list of members, as in UNESCO Programs. The network 

operates primarily by continuous electronic communication, frequent coordination meet-

ings, and the establishment of common promotion tools and projects through which territo-

ries can exchange ideas, experiences, and best practices, thereby supporting each other 

to fulfil their common goals. 

In 2001, the European Geoparks Network signed a formal agreement with the UNESCO 

Division of Earth Sciences whereby UNESCO gave the network its endorsement. During 

The First International Conference of Geoparks in Beijing (China, 27-29 June 2004), held 

by UNESCO, two main streams of activities were combined, and the UNESCO-assisted 

Global Geoparks Network was set up (EGN, 2007). The aim of this network is to provide a 

platform of cooperation and exchange between experts and practitioners in geological 

heritage matters under the umbrella of UNESCO. 

The objective of the World Heritage Convention is to recognize natural and cultural sites of 

"outstanding universal value” (Eder and Patzak, 2004). The geopark as a “Geological heri-

tage scenic spot of special geoscientific significance, rare natural attributes and aestheti-

cally ornamental value and with given scale and distribution scope, which integrates other 

natural scenes and sights and that of cultural interest into a unique natural area. It is not 

only a site for travel and sightseeing, vacationing and health recuperation as well as  

cultural recreation at a relatively high scientific level, but also a key protected area of geo-

logical heritage and base for geoscientific research and popularization” (Chen and Jiang, 

2003). A geopark contains a number of geological heritage sites of particular importance, 

rarity, or aesthetic appeal. These earth heritage sites are part of an integrated concept of 

protection, education, and sustainable development. A geopark achieves its goals through 

a three-pronged approach: conservation, education, and geotourism (UNESCO, 2006a). 

UNESCO introduced the geopark as a geographical area, but geoparks should include not 

only sites of geological significance, but also sites of ecological, archaeological, historical, 

or cultural value. In many societies, natural, cultural, and social heritage are inextricably 

linked and, thus, cannot be separated (UNESCO, 2007).  

In 2004, the agreement between the UNESCO Division of Earth Sciences and the EGN 

was confirmed by the Madonie Declaration (Italy, October 2004). A presentation of the 

declaration is necessary as it uses European geoparks as a model for the rest of the con-

tinental networks to develop and form the GGN supported by UNESCO (UNESCO, 2006a; 

Frey et al., 2006). Aside from EGN and GGN, there is also IAGT (the International Asso-

ciation for Geotourism) established in Krakow, Poland in 2007, in order to facilitate infor-

mation exchange, business, research and teaching partnerships and other collaborative 

activities among its members (http://www.iageotour.com/; Newsome et al., 2011). 

UNESCO supports national geoparks which are potential candidates for incorporation into 

the gradually expanding world network (Alexandrowicz, 2006). Since the establishment of 

the European Geoparks Network the protection of geological heritage and the promotion 

of sustainable development have been the main objectives of each geopark (EGN, 2007). 

The UNESCO geopark list shows that the numbers of geoparks are increasing very fast 

(Table 2.5 and Figure 2.8). At the end of 2011, there were 87 geoparks in 27 countries, 

which had been registered with the GGN, and China with 26 geoparks is the world’s  

leading country (Newsome et al., 2012).  

Nowadays, at the European level, the LEADER and INTERREG IV projects support initia-

tives in the field of the development of geotourism, particularly within geoparks.

For exchange of knowledge, the Global Geoparks Network held international conferences 

with geopark and geotourism themes. The First International Geoparks Conference took 

place in June 2004 in Beijing with over 300 people from 40 countries. The Second Global 

Geoparks Conference was held in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in September 2006, with 320 

participants from 40 countries and 6 continents. The Third Global Geoparks Conference 

was in Osnabruck (Germany) in June 2008, with around 500 participants from 60 coun-

tries. The 4th International UNESCO Conference on Geoparks was held in Southeast 

Asia, Langkawi Global Geopark (Malaysia) in 2010. The conference was attended by 427 

people from 27 countries, with the biggest contingent from China.

The idea of a geopark is originally closely related to the pedagogical, tourism, and geo-

logical scientific interest of sites (Figure 2.9). However, the term “GEO” is more than  

geology; it involves geographical (both physical and human) and geomorphological earth 

systems.

Figure 2.9- Relation between geopark and geography (Source: IGU, 2008) 

With regard to this, at the end of 2007, the International Geographical Union Executive 

Committee decided to launch the Commission on geoparks and continue the work of the 

geopark task force. 

The commission took two years (2008–2009) to develop its research programs and estab-

lish a methodological framework to analyse issues of geoparks, including relationships 

with associated institutions and International Geographical Union (IGU) Commissions; 

from 2010 to 2012 it is focusing on the development of comparative studies on geoparks, 

tourism, and corresponding social, economic, environmental, and political change (IGU, 

2008). 

The general goal of geoparks is to integrate the preservation of geological heritage into a 

strategy for regional sustainable economic and cultural development (Eder, 2008). There-

fore, geoparks stimulate the creation of innovative local enterprises – small business,  

cottage industries, and new jobs – and generate new sources of revenue stemming from 

geotourism and geo-products. When geotourists move to geoparks, the money follows the 

same path, as if geoparks were exporting something such as agricultural and local prod-

ucts to other places. Geoparks have to support the establishment of local crafts and repli-

cas, as well as supporting local products. Thus, visitors to geoparks can actually take 

away with them, together with emotions and knowledge, manufactured goods (Frey, et al. 

2006). 

Geotourism has created opportunities for new initiatives in Forest Fawr Geopark (Wales). 

Forest Fawr opened the door of geoparks to geotourism activities such as walking,  

cycling, introducing courses on geology, organizing research projects and exhibitions, and 



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism

providing educational packages for schools, to attract more lucrative European funding for 

the geopark territory (Penn, 2006). Furthermore, Partin et al. (2006) illustrated that the 

park managers of the Stone Forest Geopark (China) reported that the villagers in areas 

bordering the park and those involved in tourism have three times the income of other  

regional villagers. The quality of housing in villages adjacent to the park was notably 

higher than that in villages where tourism did not constitute a large proportion of the local 

economy. Moreover, national geoparks in China brought favourable social, cultural, eco-

nomical and environmental benefits (Xun and Ting, 2003). Another example in this regard 

is the Jinhu National Geopark in Taining County, Fujian Province (China) established in 

2000. The related tourism projects attract a great number of visitors. In 2001, the total 

revenues from tourism reached 202 million Yuan, 35.7% over the previous year, account-

ing for 13.5% of the county’s GDP (Xun and Ting 2003). Revenues from tourism-related 

tertiary industry increased to 450 million Yuan, up 12.3% compared with the previous year 

and accounting for nearly 30% of the county’s GDP. Thus, tourism has become a pillar 

industry of the county. It has brought such trades as catering, transportation and cultural 

recreation, providing employment for about 2,800 people (Xun and Ting, 2003).  

Furthermore, in collaboration with nine agro-tourist women’s cooperatives, the Museum of 

Lesvos Petrified Forest European Geopark (Greece) has established an agro-tourist festi-

val during the summer period in order to promote the quality of local products, food and 

drinks prepared using old recipes by the women of the villages in the geopark area 

(Zouros, 2004).   

McKeever et al. (2010: 225) described the creation of the Petrified Forest of Lesvos Euro-

pean Geopark as having transformed western Lesvos, attracting 90,000 visitors annually 

and employing 35 directly and hundreds of new jobs having been created indirectly. The 

geopark is now the island’s main visitor attraction and is an excellent example of how the 

holistic approach to conservation used in geoparks can be successful from the perspec-

tive of the local community. 

Since the geopark is a new concept, geopark activities have not been deeply studied yet. 

Based on the literature review, Fang et al. (2007) analysed and discussed the spatial hier-

archy structure and system conception model of geoparks, and classified geopark infor-

mation systems into subsystems, such as geological relic survey and appraisal subsys-

tem, geological relic protection, tourism exploitation, science popularization and teaching, 

geopark planning, geological environment, multimedia, map editing subsystem, and so on.

With the rapid development of geoparks and e-tourism,  the internet plays a significant 

role in promoting and distributing geopark services. Regarding this, Yan et al. (2008)  

examined the performance of the e-business system of geoparks in China and  

provided a comprehensive assessment of e-business functions of geoparks in China. 

 

2.6.  Comparison between Geoparks and Protected Natural Areas 
 
Farsani et al., (2011a) discussed the comparison between geoparks and protected natural 

areas.  

The concept of protected area dates back to 1872 when the first modern protected area 

(Yellowstone National Park) was established in the USA. This accompanied the formal 

laws which forced indigenous Indians to leave their territory. This management structure 

of protected areas was followed by many countries (Langton et al., 2005).  

It is noteworthy that attention to the rights of local communities in management of pro-

tected areas is relatively recent. In the 19th and 20th centuries, many protected areas 

were established on land and resources held as common property by communities, but 

perceived as terra nullius (no man’s land) when it came to seeking permission and offering 

compensation. The resident people were often expelled or severely restricted in terms of 

permissible uses of natural resources, often without compensation. Today, few people  

argue against the need to engage resident or neighbouring communities positively in the 

management of protected areas, and probably no one would defend the proposition that 

human rights are less important in relation to protected areas than elsewhere. Moreover, 

around the world, conservation agencies and communities are also “learning by doing” in 

an enormous variety of specific situations, trying to understand and apply an evolving 

body of international and national laws and regulations on the rights of indigenous people 

and local communities. The specific concerns about the rights of indigenous people have 

emerged as part of this evolving body of human rights. Thus the ILO Convention No. 169 

Concerning Indigenous and Tribal People in Independent Countries, adopted in 1989  

defines indigenous people and recognizes their right to have their social, cultural, reli-

gious, and spiritual values and practices recognized and protected, and the right to define 

their development priorities (Borrini-Feyerabend et al., 2004). According to Agenda 21, the 

knowledge and traditional way of life of the local, rural communities play a vital role in  

environmental management. States are encouraged to support the identity and culture of 

communities and to enable their effective participation in the achievement of sustainable 

development (Brecon Beacons National Park Authority, 2007). 



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

39 

At present, UNESCO’s declaration on geoparks as a model of sustainable development 

and protection of nature has highly developed the strategy of local communities’ participa-

tion in protected and natural areas. The UNESCO definition demonstrates that geoparks 

embrace some registered National Parks and protected areas with unique geological and 

cultural heritage sites. For instance, Cabo de Gata Natural Park (Spain) had been a  

protected area since 1987 and classified by UNESCO as a Biosphere Reserve, when in 

2006 it was accepted as a member of the European and Global Geoparks Network (EGN). 

Nowlan (2010) noted that a geopark is not a new form of land ownership. The designation 

of the land area as a geopark does not affect the legal status of a property and the federal, 

provincial, territorial, municipal and first nation laws remain applicable to ownership and 

management of the sites. UNESCO has no legal rights over local, provincial, territorial, 

federal, aboriginal, or private ownership or management of geopark territory. On the other 

hand all geoparks are under the umbrella of UNESCO which supports and internationally 

unifies the Global Geoparks Network (GGN); for example UNESCO organizes and coordi-

nates the conferences, and supervises application procedures and standards, and  

produces publications on geoparks and geotourism topics.  

The natural heritage and monuments which include the criteria of UNESCO can be  

applied to Global Geoparks Network membership (Table 2.6).  

It is stated that a geopark should aim for the development of the local territory and support 

local communities and products. Local communities should not be removed from the lands 

where they live, since the locals’ knowledge, traditional arts and traditional style of life can 

play a vital role in geopark management. Geoparks are established at an international 

level but are managed at a local level; a geopark encourages the local communities to fol-

low cultural interchange and identity preservation. It also motivates local people to effec-

tively participate in achieving sustainable development and sustainable tourism. Moreover, 

a geopark leads to the stimulation of the local economy through geotourism and conserva-

tion activities. Sustainable socioeconomic development is encouraged in geoparks and is 

considered in the way the park is developed (Nowlan et al., 2004). Managers of geoparks 

try to improve the welfare of indigenous communities through innovative activities and 

consulting with local businesses, artists, tour operators, private sectors, accommodation 

facilities, restaurants, and producers. Besides this, they involve locals in conservation and 

educational activities and imparting of indigenous knowledge and art.

Transferring geoparks from the regional to a European and Global scale gives the 

geopark a special value (Frey et al., 2006). 

The Global Network of National Geoparks operates in close synergy with UNESCO’s 

World Heritage Centre, the Man and the Biosphere (MAB), World Network of Biosphere 

Reserves, national and international undertakings and non-governmental organizations 

active in geological heritage conservation. For some national geoparks in Europe, a  

privileged partnership has been established with the European Geoparks Network.  

National parks have been defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature 

(IUCN), and World Commission on Protected Areas.  

McKeever and Zouros (2010) discussed that the structure of the European Geoparks 

Network comprises an Advisory Committee (11 members including representatives of 

UNESCO, the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS), and the IUCN) and a 

Coordination Committee (comprising two representatives from each geopark member). 

Decisions concerning the network are only taken by the Coordination Committee. 

However, some countries, such as China, Germany and Japan, have developed national 

geopark networks to create close collaboration between geoparks, NGOs (non-

governmental organizations), tourism sectors, schools, universities, and businesses. 

Thus, the domestic network or forum not only provides an opportunity for the exchange of 

knowledge but also encourages local communities and local private sectors in geopark 

activities. 



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

41 

It can be said that the geopark is a fully-fledged protected area that, on the one hand,  

involves local communities in conservation activities of natural heritage and takes advan-

tage of their indigenous knowledge and, on the other hand, strives to improve the local 

economy through geotourism. The core difference is actually that in a protected natural 

area in most countries and, at least in certain zones, no human and/or development activi-

ties are allowed to take place due to a very strict protection status.  

Another difference between geoparks and protected areas is that geoparks are commonly 

created and managed by local communities while protected areas are usually part of  

national organizations of natural heritage conservation. The last but not the least differ-

ence between geoparks and protected natural areas is the emphasis of the geopark on 

geological heritage and its introduction as tourist attractions in addition to ecological, cul-

tural, historical, and archaeological aspects. 

 

2.7.  Steps and Guidelines for Becoming a Global Geopark Network Member 

According to UNESCO Global Geoparks Network Guidelines (2010), size and setting is 

the first criterion for becoming a geopark. A geopark should include an area with clearly 

defined boundaries and a large enough area for it to develop the local economy and cul-

tural sustainability, particularly through tourism in the form of geotourism. Usually, geopark 

territory encompasses geosites and eco-sites with international, national and regional  

importance.  

Since education and public awareness is a target of geopark establishment, the geosites 

and eco-sites located in the geopark should be important from the point of view of science, 

rarity, education and aesthetics.  

A geopark involves ecological, archaeological, historical and cultural values. Both tangible 

and non-tangible heritage are important parameters for the establishment of geoparks. 

Spiritual culture includes components such as: languages, food, music, dance, traditional 

practices and ways of living, etc., and these are examples of non-tangible heritage.  

It is noteworthy that a geopark may be situated in the territory of more than one country. 

Novohrad-Nogad Geopark – a member of European Geoparks Network and Global  

Geoparks Network – is located in the territory of two countries (Hungary and Slovakia). 

The second criterion for becoming a geopark is contribution in management and local  

involvement. Establishment of an effective management system and program of imple-

mentation is a prerequisite for geopark creation. It is evident that geosites and eco-sites 



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

42 

should be accessible to visitors and should provide tourists with satisfaction. Moreover, for 

better management of the geopark, the authorities should involve local communities, the 

private sector and both researchers and educational bodies in the design and running of 

the geopark. Thus a geopark must encourage partnerships in its territory.   

Development of the local economy is the third criterion for becoming a geopark. The main 

objective of a geopark is to stimulate the local economy within the framework of sustain-

able development. Stimulating the local economy through tourism marketing is an  

important goal of a geopark. Examples can include: wine tours related to geology, soil, 

and topography; historic mining operations (even active mines) – such as the Geological 

and Mining Park of Sardinia (Italy) – or sightseeing and photography tours. Regardless of 

the development of the local economy, a geopark should play an important role in  

sociocultural sustainability; often cultural heritage is linked to geological heritage through 

innovative strategies in geoparks. Making geo-products – local products which are sym-

bols and communication disclosers of geoheritage – constitute a good example.     

In many cases, local communities have a special cultural connection to specific features in 

the landscape of the geopark. One remarkable example is the architecture of the houses 

in the Monsanto village in Naturtejo Geopark (Portugal) integrated between granite boul-

ders which are the symbol of this secular culture.  

The creation of innovative local enterprises, such as opening geo-bakeries and geo-

restaurants, small businesses, cottage industries, the organization of high quality training 

courses, and the appearance of new job opportunities and new sources of revenue  

through geotourism, geo-products and geoconservation (encouraging casting instead of 

the sale of fossils, for example) are benefits which emerge through the establishment of 

geoparks. These activities can provide supplementary incomes for local communities and 

can engage locals in geotourism marketing as a new business sector involving strong  

multidisciplinary cooperation. 

The fourth criterion for becoming a geopark is organizing educational activities. A geopark 

should transfer knowledge and information within the community. Regarding this, it must 

provide and support tools and activities to communicate geo-scientific knowledge and  

environmental and cultural concepts to the public (e.g. through geopark museums, theme 

museums, geotourist maps, interpretative panels, educational centres, geo and cultural 

trails, guided geotours, and modern communication media). A geopark should run educa-

tional programs for universities and schools. 



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

43 

Protection and conservation activity is another criterion for becoming a geopark: it should 

try to explore and demonstrate methods and best practice in conservation of geological 

heritage. Likewise, a geopark must not participate in the direct sale of rocks and geologi-

cal objects (Nowlan, 2010). A geopark not only preserves natural heritage but also strives 

to preserve the cultural heritage; holding regional festivals and organizing exhibitions for 

local products and handicrafts are strategies for reviving traditional culture.  

Finally, if a geopark has the above-mentioned criteria, and a fully operational and dedi-

cated body, it can apply for membership of the Global Geoparks Network. The steps for 

registration in UNESCO Global Geoparks Network are summarized in Figure 2.10.  

In the first step, the geopark authorities should submit an application dossier of the  

proposed geopark to the Geoparks Secretariat at UNESCO; the application should be 

submitted electronically.  

After that, the Geoparks Secretariat shall verify the documents. Applications must be 

submitted between 1 October and 1 December every year and they will be verified  

between 1 January and 30 April. Subsequently, in order to carry out the evaluation,  

experts who will compile a report for submission to the GGN Bureau contact the proposed 

geopark and agree on a mission program. According to Global Geoparks Network guide-

lines, the costs of travel, accommodation and transportation of the experts should nor-

mally be paid for by the country or territory where the geopark is located. 

Obviously, if there is a National Network or Forum for geoparks in a country such as 

China, Japan, Germany, Italy, Ireland or Greece, the applicant must first become a certi-

fied member of that national network, or ask for advice, before submitting its dossier for 

membership to the GGN. Similarly, European geoparks should first become a member of 

the European Geoparks Network.  

When a geopark is registered in the UNESCO Global Geoparks Network, membership is 

limited to a period of 4 years, after which time it can be renewed following the same pro-

cedure. The authorities should fill in the revalidation form and a visit by two evaluators will 

be organized.  

After revalidation one of three results will be announced. A Green Card certifies continuing 

membership of the geopark in the network for a further 4 years. A Yellow Card will be  

issued if the geopark activities and documents are not sufficient, and if the geopark is  

inactive it will be removed from the Network and a Red Card will be issued (Zouros and 

Mckeever, 2009). Any geopark that loses Global Geoparks Network membership can 



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

44 

submit a new application dossier after solving the major deficiencies that led to the Red 

Card. 

Clearly, The UNESCO Global Geoparks Network (GGN) members can take advantage of 

GGN Logo and exchange of knowledge in Network activity.

2.8.  Geo-products in Geotourism Destinations such as Geoparks 

Middleton (1989) stated that the tourism product includes all the service elements a visitor 

consumes from the time that he leaves home to the time of return. This product can be an 

idea, an expectation, or a mental construct in the customer's mind, at the point of sale. 

Middleton (1989) believes that the concept of a tourist product is relevant both to destina-

tion interests, such as National Tourist Offices and Regional Tourist Offices, and to the 

suppliers of individual component services, such as accommodation and attractions. 

With the emergence of geotourism as a new branch of sustainable tourism, tourism prod-

ucts have entered a new phase. Since geotourism is a new niche market, on one hand, it 

should introduce its attractions and its targets to visitors and on the other hand it should 

set up novel strategies to meet the challenge of attracting more tourists to geotourism

destinations. In this regard geotourism destinations such as geoparks strive to apply inno-

vation in tourist products.  

These tourist products should not only follow sustainability principles, but should also 

promote and develop geotourism as a new branch of tourism.  

As geosites (geological and geomorphological heritage sites) are the main attractions of 

geotourism destinations (such as geoparks), demonstration of pedagogical tools for geot-

ourism and educational activities can be a strategy for the preservation of geoheritage 

sites and minimizing negative impacts of tourism on these sites.  

According to Reynard (2008), geotourism offer or geotourism products/services can be 

classified into two categories: original offer and derived offer (Figure 2.11). The original 

offer consists of the set of geosites (e.g., an occurrence of dinosaur tracks, paleontological 

sites, landforms, mineral water springs etc.), while the equipment developed for the  

accommodation and transportation of tourists, the specific derived scientific goods (books 

and other written documents, digital documents, games and souvenirs) that facilitate the 

comprehension of the geoheritage by the tourists, the interpretation services at the  

disposal of tourists in the area (museums, visitor centers, exhibitions, guided tours,  

interpretative panels), as well as outside the region (websites) are categorized as derived 

geotourism offer or products/services. 



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

46 

Figure 2.11- Conceptual model of geotourism and its relationships with geo-heritage  

(Source: Pralong and Reynard, 2005) 

This section focuses on the introduction of derived geotourism products named geo-

products. According to UNESCO (1999), geo-products are “the sustainable manufacturing 

of innovative handicrafts which have a geological connotation”. Geo-products are new  

orientations in trades and crafts (Xun and Milly, 2002). Eder and Patzak (2004) introduced 

geotourism and geo-products as new sources of revenue which can provide supplemen-

tary income for the local population and attract private capital. Frey et al. (2006) noted that 

geo-products are pedagogical tools for environmental education, training, and interdisci-

plinary research related to geoscientific disciplines, broader environmental issues, and 

sustainable development. According to UNESCO Global Geoparks Network Guidelines 

(2010) geo-products are tools for protecting the geo-resources of the geopark (e.g.  

encouraging locals to make casts of the fossils instead of selling them). Geo-products try 

to integrate traditional products with new concepts and interpretations; they also raise 

awareness of geodiversity. Geo-products provide new experiences for geotourists and 

strive to develop the local economy (Rodrigues and Carvalho, 2009). Comp?ová (2010) 

identified geo-products as geological attractions such as geosites, geoheritage, etc. He 

indicated that geo-products can involve human products related to the cultural patterns 

and architecture of the geotourism destinations. 



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

47 

Making geo-products can be a solution to promote the local economy and local products 

in geotourism destinations, especially geopark territories (Farsani et al., 2011a).  

The above definitions illustrate that each geotourism destination, when making geo-

products should pay particular attention to the following principles (Farsani et al., 2012a):  

• geo-products should be made of local or regional products; 

• geo-products should be a symbol of the geological or geomorphological heritage of 

that territory; 

• geo-products should be commercial and pedagogical tools; 

• geo-products should integrate local and traditional products with concepts and in-

terpretations in geosciences;   

• geo-products should be earth friendly (sustainable) products;  

Making geo-products is an innovative strategy, and has been applied by some geoparks, 

family businesses, restaurants, bakeries, and local businesses for education and devel-

opment of the local economy through geotourism. 

The Junior Geo company can be seen as a good example for making geo-products.  

Junior Geo is a family-run business based in Dorset (UK), which was set up in August 

2005. The Junior Geo company tries to organize field trips (fossil hunting trips on the SW 

Coast of England) for schoolchildren, as well as working hard on combining the wonders 

of the natural world and modern design to create something that looks really fabulous. The 

Junior Geo company created the Rock Shop for school fairs in 2005, and established an 

online store that provides all things fossil and mineral for kids (Verkaik et al., 2005).  

Customers can buy online milk chocolate ammonites, milk chocolate trilobites, chocolate 

dinosaur shapes, chocolate fossil shells, etc. 

As mentioned before, geoparks are pioneers in the promotion of geotourism, and authori-

ties of geoparks through consulting with local businesspeople, restaurants, bakeries,  

museums, outdoor companies, rural hotels, and family guest houses attempt to develop 

geo-products in these territories. It is worth mentioning that geo-products which are made 

based on geological elements of geoparks not only introduce local products and local 

handicrafts to visitors, but increase public awareness and knowledge of visitors about the 

geology and geomorphology of that territory. Therefore it can be said that geo-products 

are pedagogic tools in geoparks.  



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

48 

Apart from the above, there are geotourism maps, geotours, geo-museums, thematic  

museums, interpretative panels, publications, geotourism handbooks, geotourism guide 

books, and geotourism calendars. Geoparks applied innovation in decorative or ornamen-

tal products, and edible products for introducing geoheritage sites. Therefore, geo-

products in geoparks can be classified into two categories: decorative or ornamental geo-

products, and edible geo-products.  

Decorative, ornamental and commemorative goods made from stone or wood, furniture, 

children's toys, and clothes which are symbols of the geopark can be a geo-product. In 

geopark territory local handicrafts can be converted to decorative or ornamental geo-

products. These kinds of geo-products can not only preserve handicrafts as a cultural 

component and develop the local economy, but also present the geological heritage of the 

geopark to visitors, local communities, and children including schoolchildren. 

Making trilobite clocks, trilobite lamp shades, printed glass with trilobite pictures, trilobite 

necklaces, etc. in Arouca Geopark (Portugal) can be a good example of decorative or  

ornamental geo-products (Farsani et al., 2012a). It is noteworthy that one of the most  

important geosites in Arouca Geopark is an outstanding fossil locality of the Darriwilian 

(Middle Ordovician) age, where giant trilobites and trilobite clusters (from several to thou-

sands of specimens) occur in large slabs of shale (GTGA, 2006; Coelho, et al., 2010). 

Pedras Parideiras is another geo-product in the Arouca Geopark. Pedras Parideiras are 

cookies which have the shape of biotite nodules from local granites. Visitors can find these 

cookies in one of the famous pastry shops of Arouca (Casa do Pão de Ló de Arouca). 

Pedras Parideiras is a symbol of the Castanheira Nodular Granite, with a phenomenon 

popularly known as Pedras Parideiras (rocks that give birth) (Farsani et al., 2012a).   

Naturtejo Geopark (Portugal) is another active geopark in making geo-products. The  

establishment of a geo-restaurant and geo-bakery in Naturtejo Geopark were strategies to 

create geo-products. They draw inspiration from the landscape and have revived past  

civilizations and ancient traditions as well (Rodrigues and Carvalho 2009; Naturtejo 

Geopark Authorities, 2010a)  

The geo-bakery (Casa do Forno) is managed by a geologist couple. Geology stimulates 

the couple participating in management; for instance they make trilobite and granulite 

cookies in the geo-bakery, and they serve them in tours, conferences, and for the local 

guests.  



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

49 

Besides this, the geo-bakery has designed a geo-menu and serves geo-food. Each pizza 

in this restaurant has a geographic name, for example Nazca Pizza (an example of a  

tectonic earth plate). Aside from tectonic pizza, the geo-bakery makes Orogenic Toasties 

(Cadomian, Variscan and Alpine, representing the major mountain belt events from 

Naturtejo Geopark) (Geraldes and Ferreira, 2009). 

Serving ‘Boulder Soup’ or ‘Marble Cake’ in the Petiscos &amp;amp; Granitos geo-restaurant which 

is located in the Monsanto village, Naturtejo Geopark (Portugal) constitutes another good 

example for making geo-products. Petiscos &amp;amp; Granitos is the first geological restaurant 

which is located in the Naturtejo Geopark territory. The food is served on tables set among 

boulders (the geological architecture of the restaurant) (Rodrigues and Carvalho 2009; 

Farsani et al, 2010).  

Furthermore, Carlos Santos, a businessman from Idanha-a-Nova has inaugurated the 

second geo-restaurant in Naturtejo Geopark. The Carlos Santos Sabores da Terra (Earth 

Flavours) geo-restaurant serves traditional recipes combined with local products such as 

local mushrooms, cheese and olive oil. In addition, geo-food such as Cantchais Lamb 

(Cantchais is the local name for granite boulders) is served in this geo-restaurant. The 

menu of the restaurant is related to local geological landscapes (Naturtejo Geopark  

Authorities, 2010a).  

Vulkaneifel Geopark (Germany) became economically famous for its mineral water  

resources. Today, many volcanologists and geologists as well as environmental scientists 

and biologists do research here because of the large open pits which give a new dimen-

sion to look into volcanological processes and perspectives for sustainable development 

ideas. Creating geo-cocktails such as Vulkaneifel Mineral Water Cocktails is an innovation 

for promoting regional and local products in this geopark (Farsani et al., 2010).  

As for geology, Hateg Country Dinosaurs Geopark (Romania) is known worldwide for its 

"dwarf dinosaurs" from the end of the Cretaceous, 65 million years ago, and this special 

paleontological heritage has inspired the name of the geopark. The authorities of this  

geopark, through making geo-products such as dinosaur bread, promote geosciences as 

well as the local economy (Farsani et al., 2012a).  

Furthermore, Réserve Géologique de Haute Provence (France) offers ammonite choco-

late, ammonite bread, and pastries, as some of the attractions in Digne les Bains (Unjah, 

2008).  



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

50 

Consequently, it can be said that geo-products as pedagogic tools are sustainable and 

earth friendly products which can integrate geoheritage (geological, geomorphological and 

geographical) with cultural components. Thus, making geo-products is an innovative strat-

egy to identify geoheritage as a new tourist attraction. Promoting geo-products can be a 

way to develop the local economy (Farsani et al., 2012a; 2011b)  

It should be noted that a geopark is an area for introducing and protecting the geological 

and geomorphological heritage, such as its cultural, ecological, archaeological and natural 

resources, as tourist attractions; the establishment of a geopark can be a strategy for  

sustainable economical development. Therefore, marketing in geoparks should not only 

pay particular care and attention to geo-products and geotourism marketing, but also help 

to draw attention to local marketing such as local products, agricultural products, handi-

crafts based on natural heritage (fauna and flora), regional festivals, national festivals,  

cultural festivals, etc.   

As mentioned before, local companies, bakeries, restaurants, outdoor companies, and 

family businesses are active in creating geo-products.    

It is noteworthy that the private sector or family businesses only undertake innovation 

such as creating new products when an organization promises them to be profitable.  

Branding (certification) of local products will support the local producer. Local producers 

and customers will benefit from branding advantages which are higher-quality, environ-

mentally friendly and so on.  

Regarding this, the UNESCO Global Geoparks Network provides opportunities and possi-

bilities, through a common logo, for small firms which are the members of the Geopark 

Network to boost their creativity and initiatives (Zouros and Mckeever, 2009). These logos 

must only be used on products produced directly by geoparks and related to geopark  

activities (such as geo-products, publications, fairs, regional festivals, exhibitions, etc.). 

 

2.9.  Socio-Cultural Sustainability in Geoparks 

The New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy (Hirsch et al., 2005) defines culture as “the sum of 

attitudes, customs, and beliefs that distinguishes one group of people from another. Cul-

ture is transmitted through language, material objects, ritual, institutions, and art, from one 

generation to the next” (Hirsch et al., 2005). According to Barbic (1998), cultural identity 

and its components are changing over time even though, when these components are 

known as traditions, it persists for a longer time.  



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

51 

Cultural identity is classified into two groups: material culture and spiritual culture. Accord-

ing to Le Ha (2008) material culture is always changing, while spiritual culture is more  

stable. Spiritual culture includes components such as languages, handicrafts, food, music, 

dance, etc., and material culture involves landscapes such as architecture and urbanism, 

crops, etc. (Figure 2.12).  

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

Figure 2.12 - Cultural identities (Source: Barbic, 1998) 

 

The aim of this section is to identify the role played by geoparks and geotourism in cultural 

sustainability. For this purpose, a brief literature review addresses the negative and posi-

tive impacts of tourists on the sociocultural identity of host communities. Furthermore, a 

literature review was conducted to find out which activities are applied by geoparks in or-

der to preserve cultural components of local communities who live in geopark territories.    

Discussion of tourism’s social and cultural impacts on host communities was presented in 

America with the publication of Hosts and Guests in 1977 (Smith, 1989a). Running 

throughout the book is the theme that tourism has consequences for the host society, 

sometimes good and sometimes bad. 

Mansperger (1995) found that tourism in Kenya has encouraged undesirable behaviours 

among residents such as begging and prostitution. Importantly, he noted that this behav-

iour is reduced in communities with strong native institutions. Brunt and Courtney (1999)  

offered an excellent review of this literature. The literature mentioned identified the key 

social impacts of tourism development, such as: the concentration of power among elites; 

the loss of local decision-making power; the erosion of gender segregation and  



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

52 

increased opportunities for women; and a shift in demographics bringing young transients 

looking for jobs, dependency, and over-crowding. They also found that the key social im-

pacts of tourist-host interaction have been identified as: changes in perceived safety and 

security; a worsening attitude towards tourists; the imitation of perceived tourist lifestyles; 

introduction of new languages; the demise of local languages; conflict; avoidance of tourist 

areas, resentment due to economic inequality; and resentment over inflated prices.   

Lastly, it was found that the key cultural impacts of tourism are: commoditization of  

culture; revitalization of culture; acculturation; destruction of culture; and temporary 

change in host behaviour. These impacts are quite varied and reported from studies all 

over the world.  

It is worth mentioning that sustainable tourism tries to decrease the negative impacts of 

tourism. Smith’s (1989b) study of Eskimo tourism in Alaska illustrated that the tourists  

discovered Northern Alaska and Eskimo culture vanished.     

Similarly, McKean (1989) suggested that tourism in Bali, Indonesia, is conserving tradi-

tional culture, while simultaneously contributing to its inevitable change. By commoditizing 

folk dances and crafts, tourism has provided an incentive for their conservation and  

appreciation. Meanwhile, Bali culture is becoming modernized, partly as a result of new 

ideas and technologies introduced by tourism. 

To this end, tourists should be informed about local customs, dress codes, acceptable  

social behaviours, etc. By means of advertisement visitors can be educated through intro-

ducing local cultural values, providing cultural guidelines, and presenting briefings about  

appropriate behaviour. 

As McKercher (2003) noted, cultural sustainability increases people's control over their 

lives and strengthens community identity; it is also compatible with the locals’ culture and 

values. The following guidelines are principals for cultural sustainability planning and 

management:  

• Initiate tourism with the help of broad-based community input;  

• Support educational and training programs to improve and manage heritage and 

natural resources; 

• Conserve cultural diversity; 

• Respect land and property rights of traditional inhabitants; 



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

53 

• Guarantee the protection of nature, the local and indigenous cultures and  

especially traditional knowledge; 

• Work actively with indigenous leaders and minority groups to ensure that indige-

nous cultures and communities are depicted accurately and with respect; 

• Strengthen, nurture, and encourage the community's ability to maintain and use 

traditional skills; 

• Educate tourists about desirable and acceptable behaviour; 

• Educate the tourism industry about desirable and acceptable behaviour; 

 Duxbury et al. (2007) indicated ten key themes of cultural sustainability: the culture of 

sustainability; globalization; heritage conservation; sense of place; indigenous knowledge 

and traditional practices; community cultural development; arts, education, and youth; sus-

tainable design; planning; and cultural policy and local government. 

Furthermore, Eraqi (2007) claims that tourism development in Egypt has not only contrib-

uted to economic benefits in terms of job creation and has not only increased investment 

and development of projects to local Egyptian tourist destinations, but has also resulted in 

sociocultural benefits such as an increase in national income, more positive cultural  

exchange, and has yielded positive economic impacts on local businesses. Soini and 

Kangas (2009) also argued for the promotion of cultural sustainability in rural areas, as 

communities preserve their cultural identities more than in urban areas. Tourism strategy 

should concentrate on activities that help improve the skills of local people, create positive 

attitudes towards work, and encourage investment in the state’s infrastructure such as 

media, fairs, regional festivals, cultural museums, etc. It is necessary to facilitate direct 

contact between tourists and local people by encouraging rural families to invite tourists 

into their homes. 

According to National Geographic’s definition “Geotourism is tourism that sustains, or 

even enhances, the geographical character of a place, such as its culture, environment, 

heritage, and the well-being of its residents”. Geotourism should strive for cultural sustain-

ability and sustainable development (Figure 2.13).

Figure 2.13- Geo-heritage’s contribution to sustainable development and geotourism  

(Source: Rodrigues, 2009)      

Andr??anu and Grigorescu (2008) argued that any geopark territory is not a sum of sepa-

rate elements, but rather an organic context of spatial and non-spatial realities, shaped by 

its physical structure (geodiversity and biodiversity), human landscape and its historic  

evolution. The major role of the geopark is to help local communities to re-appropriate 

these values and to revive and strengthen the local and cultural identity in respect to sus-

tainable development principles. Regarding this they suggested four basic ideas for  

approaching geopark development: 

• Developing interdisciplinary detailed research studies to identify the territorial  

system components, their relationships, social and economical needs and assign a 

role and relative priority for each one related to local identity valorization; 

• Use of the research results and multi-stakeholder approach to develop social, eco-

nomic and cultural projects and to support active participation and involvement of 

local communities; 

• Creating local, national and international partnerships for formal and informal edu-

cation, public awareness, project development and to promote the area and its 

values; 

• That due attention be given to activities from projects dealing with public aware-

ness, cultural events, promotion, informal education, the potential of cultural goods 

for local or regional development, and the needs and the willingness of the local 

community concerned.

Recently, geoparks – through promoting geotourism in their territory – strive to achieve 

key themes of cultural sustainability and revive traditional culture while decreasing the 

negative cultural impacts of tourism. 

For sociocultural sustainable development, geoparks hold workshops, festivals, fairs, and 

educational programs. Moreover, geoparks, through innovative strategies, try to introduce 

the traditional skills of locals to tourists. In this regard, Langkawi Global Geopark (Malay-

sia) exposed Malay herbal treatments and ancient health rituals to tourists. A geopark 

song sung in the local language is one strategy to prevent the demise of the local  

language in the area (Azman et al., 2010). Presenting local handicrafts, souvenirs, local 

products, and organizing exhibitions, fairs, festivals, and workshops together with the es-

tablishment of cultural museums can be not only a solution for local economic rehabilita-

tion, but can also recover the traditional style of life and local customs. 

For instance, in the Stone Forest National Geopark located in southwest China’s Yunnan 

Province, visitors can observe the folk customs and local culture while enjoying the beauty 

of science and Karst landscapes (Xun and Milly, 2002). Geologically, Tower Hill is an in-

ternational site of significance and the main site for Australia’s first Global Geopark, Ka-

nawinka. Tower Hill, by balancing modern artwork, nature-based cultural tourism, envi-

ronmental management and bush-food enterprises with traditional aboriginal knowledge, 

has revitalized culture and strengthened sustainability objectives (Collyer, 2007).  

Organizing regional festivals, fairs and exhibitions is the first strategy which geopark  

authorities apply to cultural sustainability. Regarding this, the Mongols in Hexigten Global 

Geopark (China) hold a grassland Nadam fair during the summer and autumn to celebrate 

their harvest (Tingshan, 2004); it is worth mentioning that the Nadam fair is a historic festi-

val in this territory which the geopark has tried to revive.  

Organizing a project regarding making homemade maize bread in Arouca Geopark,  

Portugal, which was attended by 120 people, mostly women, was a strategy to revive the 

traditional gastronomy in this territory. This project was an important opportunity to involve 

local communities with Arouca Geopark and to promote knowledge about geosites, espe-

cially the maize bread rocks geosite and cultural sustainability (Sousa et al., 2011).   

In order to attract people to visit the Lesvos Petrified Forest European Geopark (Greece), 

the local governors organize several scientific and cultural events during the year. These 

include natural history exhibitions, lectures, book presentations, exhibitions of sculpture, 

painting and photography, music concerts, theatre performances and several other  

cultural happenings (Zouros, 2004).   



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

56 

Réserve Géologique of Haute Provence (France) and Hateg Country (Romania) European 

geoparks, through holding exhibitions, and inter-cultural dialogue (dialogue between Man 

and Earth) among researchers, artists, teachers, and peasants strive for cultural sustain-

ability in their territories (Andr??anu and Giraud, 2009).   

Puay Liu and Abd Halim (2008) according to a pilot survey in villages in Padang Mat Sirat 

and Kilim of Langkawi Geopark noted that most local communities agreed that Radio 

Langkawi FM was a major source of information on Langkawi Geopark, particularly when 

it played Geopark local song during the morning airtime show. The local community said 

that the geopark song helped to remind them that Langkawi is a geopark.   

According to Ramsay et al. (2010a), the presentation of traditional dances, music and  

stories during the Geoparks week is another strategy for cultural sustainability in Hateg 

Country Dinosaurs Geopark (Romania).  

Providing geo-trails (a geo-trail is a service that promotes hiking and outdoor education) 

passing through the villages and the surrounding cultural landscapes (Rodrigues and  

Carvalho, 2009) is another strategy for cultural sustainability in geoparks. These geo-trails 

are opportunities for visitors to observe and to experience the lifestyle, architecture,  

customs and cuisine of local people who live in the geopark territory.   

The Global Geopark Bergstrasse-Odenwald, situated in the southwest of the State of 

Hesse (Germany), designed a geo-trail with two sections through the cultural landscape of 

Michelstadt’s graben structure. The geo-trail of Michelstadt offers geological features, cul-

tural highlights and mining history to visitors. Moreover, an annual program for guided 

tours is available for tourists (McKeever et al., 2010). Another important tool to communi-

cate the vivid relationship between man and nature is the implementation of geo-points in 

the Bergstrasse–Odenwald Geopark. These geo-points contain earth history and connect 

it with local history and tradition (Weber, 2009).  

Aside from the above activities, reconstruction of architectural elements in geoparks can 

be a solution to achieve cultural sustainability. Regarding this, Cabo de Gata European 

Geopark (Spain) runs a project of rehabilitation and consolidation of the water-wheels as 

the most numerous and important architectural elements in the landscape of the Cabo de 

Gata region (Mendoza and Navarro, 2007).  

With the purpose of understanding the folklore and the character of Sobrarbe European 

Geopark (Spain) various public and private initiatives have emerged to recover and man-

age the mining heritage in this territory. The Sobrarbe Geopark supports these projects 



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

57 

and works to unite them, so they can be effectively managed. In order to achieve this goal, 

there are currently three infrastructures distributed throughout the area: the Geopark  

Interpretation Centre, the Bielsa Museum and the Geo-mining circuit. The Interpretation 

Centre (Aínsa Castle) presents the mining heritage, especially the geology related to min-

eral deposit formation. The community’s way of life is highlighted at the Bielsa Museum. 

Lastly, the Geo-mining circuit summarizes, in five panels, the role of mining technology 

across the landscape (Poch, 2007). 

Examples also illustrate that geoparks aim to revive traditional food, local arts, and tradi-

tional culture through exposing them to tourists; thereby geoparks, by promoting geotour-

ism and innovative strategies, reduce the negative sociocultural impacts of tourism in their 

territory.  

Naturtejo European Geopark, for the purposes of cultural preservation, tries to improve 

local products and a service related to nature and cultural tourism, and strives to increase 

the level of use of equipment and services and cultural tours to both the resident popula-

tion and tourists. Authorities of Naturtejo European Geopark also develop network activi-

ties, tourism marketing and cultural programming in this territory (Marques, 2009). 

The establishment of a brand new geo-restaurant in Naturtejo European Geopark not only 

looked for inspiration in the local landscape but also revived past civilizations and ancient 

culture thousands of years old. This geo-restaurant was opened in 2010 by Carlos Santos, 

a businessman from Idanha-a-Nova. He tries to stimulate traditional flavours (Naturtejo 

Geopark Authorities, 2010a). 

Using the brand or logo of geoparks for promoting quality of local products as cultural 

components can be another strategy for rehabilitation of at least some of them. In order to 

evaluate agro-tourism enterprises, the Psiloritis Natural Park and European Geopark 

(Greece) organized a project titled ”Land of Psiloritis” in the geopark territory. Regarding 

this, members which use the geopark logo as the brand name for a network of cooperat-

ing enterprises have to fulfil certain quality standards that have been set in collaboration 

with the geopark and are evaluated every year by a common group of specialists (Fassou-

las and Zouros, 2010).   

The last but not the least strategy as an innovation for cultural sustainability in geoparks is 

the integration of handicrafts or local products as cultural components with geopark char-

acteristics (e.g. geo-products). 



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

58 

Geo-products are local products related to geopark activities and are symbols of geologi-

cal and geomorphological heritage of the geopark (Rodrigues and Carvalho, 2009;  

Farsani et al., 2010).  

Geo-products which are made based on geological elements of geoparks not only intro-

duce the local products and the local handicrafts as cultural components to tourists, but 

also increase the public knowledge of tourists about geology.  

Pursuant to geopark activities, it is evident that geoparks can play a role in the cultural 

sustainability of their territories.  

According to Nickerson (2010) geotourism strives to sustain the region’s landscape 

through perpetuation of local values and attracting visitors who actively promote local  

values through their travel behaviour. The responsibility of geotourism is to keep things ‘as 

they are’ for the resident or develop things ‘their way’ rather than change for visitors.  

Geotourism as a target of geoparks increases value of the local business, local landscape 

and culture connected to the geopark. As mentioned before, there are cultural trails in 

geoparks in which tourists observe cultural panorama and are educated about the relation 

between geological heritage and cultural heritage. 

 

2.10.  Socioeconomical Impacts of the Establishment of Geoparks 

The purpose of this section is to investigate the effects of geopark creation on the devel-

opment of the local economy through geotourism. Since tourism marketing is a key factor 

in the development of the local economy, the section starts by reviewing the literature on 

tourism and economy. After that the literature provides an overview of issues relating to 

geoparks, geotourism and the local economy.  

Horn and Simmons (2002) noted that the economic importance of tourism plays a role in 

determining residents’ attitudes. As economic benefits increase, residents’ attitudes  

become more favourable. In general, tourism is favoured by developing economies  

because it is a so-called invisible export (Brohman, 1996). This means it brings foreign 

exchange into the country without shipping any resource or product abroad.   

The money that tourists spend remains typically in local hands. Research by Hampton 

(1998) and Scheyvens (2002) validates this point. Both researchers found that back-

packers, typically explorers or drifters by nature, make significant contributions to local 

economies without triggering significant leakage. The money that backpackers spend 



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

59 

goes directly to local people who themselves are supported by a network of local produc-

ers ranging from farmers to labourers and artisans. Therefore, small-scale local invest-

ment in tourism has positive impacts on the local economy.  

The experience of Paul Lepp (2004) in Uganda, East Africa, illustrated that the involve-

ment of local communities would best describe the present state of tourism development. 

In this regard, the government should encourage local people to promote tourism in rural 

areas.  

In view of the fact that it provides economic and other benefits to local residents, such as 

creating job opportunities and generating income, as well as some other services, prod-

ucts and supplies, geotourism has, nowadays, been introduced as  a best form of sustain-

able rural tourism marketing. 

Since all abiotic natural objects are located in rural areas, development of geotourism in 

these areas can be a chance for rural development (B?benek, 2006). Geotourism devel-

opment also represents a partnership between the government, local people, and private 

sectors: local businesses, active tourism companies, tour agencies, restaurants and  

accommodation among others. This partnership is welcomed because it makes good eco-

nomic sense and can benefit all partners (Dowling, 2009). For instance, geoparks and 

geotourism development may have a great potential for local sustainable socioeconomic 

development. In China, the focus is the enhancement of employment and new economic 

activities linked to the specialties of each geopark. The establishment of individual 

geoparks should favour new orientations in tourism (geotourism), and in trades and crafts 

(geo-products), such as the sustainable manufacturing of innovative handicrafts which 

have a geological connotation, for example fossil casting and souvenirs (Xun and Milly, 

2002).  

Local governments of Yuntai Geopark in Henan (China), introduced geotourism as a new 

economic growth point which can improve the expense of geoheritage preservation,  

increase local revenue and enhance employment. In 2001, the number of visitors reached 

600,000, and the income from admission fees amounted to 14 million Yuan, twice the  

average of the previous years. In 2002, the number of visitors soared to 940,000 and the 

income from admission fees increased to 27.2 million Yuan, up 68% and 97%, respec-

tively, compared with the previous year. More than 60 hotels were newly built in the 

county, and about 4,000 jobs were provided by tourism development (Xun and Ting, 

2003). 



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

60 

Another example in China is Jinhu Geopark in Taining County, Fujian Province, estab-

lished in 2000. Tourism marketing attracts a great number of visitors to this territory. In 

2001, the total revenues from tourism reached 202 million Yuan, 35.7% over the previous 

year, accounting for 13.5% of the county’s GDP. Revenues from tourism increased to 450 

million Yuan, up 123% compared with the previous year and accounting for nearly 30% of 

the county’s GDP. Thus, tourism has become a pillar industry of the county. It has brought 

along such trades as catering, transportation and cultural recreation, providing employ-

ment for about 2,800 people (Xun and Ting, 2003). 

Zouros (2004) noted that the Petrified Forest of Lesvos (Greece) is in collaboration with 

nine agro-tourist cooperatives, and during the summer period the Petrified Forest Natural 

History Museum organizes an agro-tourist festival. In order to promote the quality of local 

products, food and drinks made using old recipes from the women of the surrounding  

villages of geopark are used. In addition, the Petrified Forest of Lesvos European Geopark 

has created links with local tourist enterprises, restaurants and small hotels in order to  

increase the number of park visitors. Pursuant to geopark establishment and local gover-

nors’ activities, the amount of “Bed and Breakfast” accommodation has doubled in the  

village of Sigri. What’s more, the visitors have increased the duration of their visit to the 

geopark. McKeever et al., (2010,p.225) described the creation of the Lesvos Petrified  

Forest European Geopark (Greece) as transforming western Lesvos, attracting 90,000 

visitors annually and employing 35 locals directly and with hundreds of new jobs having 

been created indirectly. The geopark is now the island’s main visitor attraction and is an 

excellent example of how the holistic approach to conservation used in geoparks can be 

successful from the perspective of the local community.  

Nowlan et al. (2004) explained that the decline of the rural economy in recent years has 

meant the depopulation of many small towns in North America. Such areas, by converting 

to geoparks, can take enormous advantage from geopark-related activities. Examples in-

clude places with exceptional fossils, rocks or minerals, areas with a rich history of mining 

or energy development that is now finished, and remote communities in northern regions. 

Thus, establishment of geoparks in North America can increase tourism to these areas 

and help to reverse a declining economy. 

According to Dusar (2004), the application of the geopark concept to the mountain karst 

areas in Vietnam may be the best way to guarantee preservation of the unique karst land-

scape, offering at the same time sustainable development and an acceptable share of the 

national improvement of standards of life to its inhabitants.

Establishing family guest houses (Bed and Breakfast) in Naturtejo European Geopark 

(Portugal) can be a strategy to promote the local economy. An example for this is Casa de 

Forno, an ancient community oven that was turned in to cosy accommodation and a geo-

bakery. Casa de Forno is managed by a geologist couple and their family. They also or-

ganize some outdoor and geo-tour activities for visitors (Geraldes and Ferreira, 2009), 

such as TTransGeopark 4x4.  

Naturtejo Geopark organizes a project of promotion of geological heritage, and local eco-

nomic development through geotourism. Collaborating with active tourism company Incen-

tivos Outdoor (which runs the boat trips to the Porta de Rodão Natural monument and the 

Neolithic Tejo Rock Art), organizing geo-sports (geo-kayaking in Portas de Rodão and 

Tagus River), consulting with local businesses to produce geo-products (geo-pizza, trilo-

bite and geo-cakes), establishing geo-restaurants, etc., are new activities which the local 

management of the geopark applied to promote the local economy (Rodrigues and Car-

valho, 2009).  

The European Geopark Bergstrasse-Odenwald (Germany), in order to promote geotour-

ism, invited local groups to join the geopark on-site network and to participate in training 

for geopark administration. By the end of 2009, more than 150 active geopark guides, as 

part of the geopark’s visitor service, were trained. This activity is not only a step towards 

sustainable development, but also creates job opportunities for local communities (Eck-

hardt, 2009).  

Furthermore, Turner (2006) urged that establishing geoparks in Australian-Pacific regions 

can bring benefits for farmers in rural areas and small businesses.   

The geopark also supports the marketing of local handicrafts such as production of fossil 

casts and souvenirs by local enterprises. The local products are supplied in agro-tourist 

festivals or are also sold in the Museum snack-bar (Zouros, 2009).  

The Quinta da Vila’s service is family accommodation located in Alvarenga village (Arouca 

municipality) which is certified by the Arouca Geopark Association. Quinta da Vila offers 

geopark adventure sport programs (geopark experience packages). It is noteworthy  

that 41% of the 2010 Quinta da Vila's sales were made through the experience packages 

(Peres, 2011).   

Moreover, S. Pedro Hotel located in Arouca Geopark promotes programs and experience 

packages of nature, adventure and cultural tourism of the geopark.  At the end of 2011, 



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

62 

the occupancy rate of 33.45% means a positive trend, being higher than the 24.80% of the 

previous years (Brito, 2011).  

Consequently, geotourism as a niche market is still at an early stage of commercial devel-

opment, but experiences and examples illustrate that the creation of geoparks and the  

development of geotourism as a branch of sustainable tourism can be an innovative solu-

tion for the development of rural economies. 

 

2.11.  Socio-Environmental Impacts of the Establishment of Geoparks 

Aside from the development of the local economy, preservation of natural heritage and 

popularization of the environment, science, especially geo-sciences, is the main target of 

the establishment of geoparks.  

In order to achieve these goals, each geopark should take advantage of local knowledge 

and should try to ascertain the best means of knowledge transfer in its territory.  

This section looks at the strategies applied by geoparks for education, conservation of the 

natural heritage and minimization of negative impacts of tourism upon the environment.  

 

2.11. 1. Geoconservation in Geoparks 

Environmental values refer to individual and shared community or society beliefs about 

the significance, importance, and well-being of the natural environment, and how the natu-

ral world should be viewed and treated by humans (Reser and Bentrupperbäumer, 2005). 

Tourism has consequences for the environment, sometimes positive and not uncommonly 

negative. For instance, mass tourism has a negative impact on natural resources; that is 

why local communities are usually not interested in it (Fennell, 2003). Tourism for Nature 

(ecotourism), the creation of national parks and wildlife parks (e.g., Yellowstone Park in 

USA and the Amboseli National Park, Kenya), protection of reefs and beaches in the 

Great Barrier Reef (Australia), and maintenance of forests such as the New Forest (UK) 

are positive direct environmental impacts associated with tourism (Cooper et al., 2005). 

Geoheritage, which draws attention to the geological and geomorphological elements of 

nature worthy of conservation, has for years been considered less vulnerable than other 

environmental values. Therefore, it has not received the same amount of attention from 

the conservationist movement as cultural and ecological heritage (Reynard and Coratza, 

2007). 



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

63 

Reimold (1999) argued the importance of geoconservation. His study has some major 

purposes. Firstly, geoheritage is a part of general environmental protection; secondly, 

education relies on well-preserved natural instruction sites; thirdly, scientific use demands 

protection of this heritage, for future examination, for comparison with new discoveries, 

and for renewed scrutiny of previous hypotheses.   

Geodiversity (Gray, 2004) is currently used in parallel with the term ‘biodiversity’ to indi-

cate the natural diversity of the abiotical part of nature and its influence on both biodiver-

sity and cultural diversity.  

According to Burek and Prosser (2008) geoconservation is a growing activity, with more 

participants and a greater profile now than ever before. They noted that geoconservation 

is very well established in the United Kingdom and increasingly across Europe and Aus-

tralia, and with the World Heritage List and especially the rapid growth of geoparks; it is 

now coming to importance in many other parts of the world.  

Geological Societies (lUGS) and UNESCO have been sponsoring a project called GEO-

SITES, which aims at the preservation of unique and typical sites, representing geology, 

geomorphology, stratigraphy, paleontology, archaeology, hydrology, etc., on a global level 

(Wimbledon, 1996; Wimbledon et al., 1996). To this end, Reimold (1999) suggested that 

geoconservation on the African continent has not featured very prominently to date and 

unique and typical geosites need to be identified. In Switzerland, for example, a working 

group on geotopes was founded by the Swiss Academy of Sciences in 1994 (Heitzmann 

et al., 2006); a strategic report on geotopes was published in 1995 (Strasser et al., 1995) 

to be followed by a similar report on geoparks (Reynard and Coratza, 2007), and the first 

list of geosites of national significance was published in 1998 (Working Group for the Pro-

tection of Geotopes in Switzerland, 1999). 

Johnson et al. (2010) noted that converting a geological site to a geosite, and, if the size 

and relevance are applicable, to a geopark may be not only the best way to promote tour-

ism marketing in these areas, but also a strategy to preserve geological heritage. For  

example, the island of Mauritius, located in the Indian Ocean, where geology, scenery and 

climate are closely similar to those of Hawaii, can be converted to a geopark in order to 

attain a sustainable development model.   

Moreover, Pereira et al. (2007) presented the various steps involved in the compilation of 

the inventory, selection, and assessment of sites of geomorphological interest for promo-

tion by the Montesinho Natural Park Board (Portugal), especially with regards to their edu-

cational value.

Since education can be a means of conservation of natural heritage (both biological and 

geological), Anderson and Brown (2010) demonstrated that activities such as creating 

teaching resources, using the latest technologies, supporting field trips, building up a web-

site presence, promoting school visits, conferences, exhibitions, supporting museums, and 

disseminating information through major teaching associations can be good examples of 

how to popularize and preserve the Quaternary of the British Isles. 

Besides, geoconservation can contribute to the objectives of Agenda 21, highlighting the 

potential for interaction between socioeconomic development and conservation of the 

natural environment. This approach allows consideration of other issues like geodiversity, 

geological heritage, geotourism, geoparks, and geoeducation as concepts of geoconser-

vation (Andr??anu, 2007a and 2007b) (Figure 2.14). 

 

Figure 2.14 - Basic concepts in geoconservation and their relationships 

( Source: Andr??anu, 2007) 

In the last decade, the UNESCO declaration on geoparks as a new model of sustainable 

development has highly strengthened the strategies such as local communities’ participa-

tion in protecting natural heritage, organizing educational programs, and promoting geot-

ourism. It is stated that indigenous people should not be removed from the lands where 

they live, since the locals’ knowledge, traditional arts, and traditional style of life play a  

vital role in geopark management.   



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

65 

As mentioned before, geoparks are set up at an international level but managed at a local 

level. Hence, geopark authorities encourage local communities to follow cultural inter-

change and identity preservation. They also motivate local people to participate effectively 

in achieving sustainable development and sustainable tourism in geoparks.  

Managers of geoparks try to improve the welfare of indigenous communities through inno-

vative activities and consulting with local business people, artists, tour operators, private 

sectors, accommodation facilities, restaurants, and producers. In addition, they involve 

locals in conservation and educational activities, and imparting of local knowledge.  

The officials employ network activities for the implementation of geopark targets (Figure 

2.15). The network illustrates the close relation between geotourism and geoparks and 

local communities, private sectors, local government, schools, universities, environment, 

businesspeople, NGOs (non-governmental organizations), and tourism sectors. A regional 

network can provide the most appropriate and practical mechanism for sharing informa-

tion, education, and training resources. Also, establishing related organizations can help in 

information management, communication links, training and advisory services, sharing 

experiences, research, and development. 

Whereas conservation is a target of geoparks, environment organization has close col-

laboration with the geopark. However, in the geopark the conservation activities have a 

specific form, since the geopark tries to involve locals in preserving their territory. Geopark 

officials believe that no one knows the area better than the local people; therefore they 

stimulate locals to conserve the geopark through economic incentives and education.  

Each geopark, in order to be preserved, utilizes innovative strategies.

2.11.1.1.  Involving Local Communities in Geopark Activities 
As mentioned in the last section, preparing an inventory of geological heritage, introducing 

geotopes and establishing geosites and geoparks can be a way to conserve geological 

heritage sites. However, for this purpose geoparks utilize innovative strategies in order to 

promote conservation of natural heritage. The first strategy is local communities’ involve-

ment in geopark conservation. In most geoparks, officials take advantage of indigenous 

knowledge for geopark conservation and management, and in this case, the geopark  

directly develops the local economy through the creation of supplementary income for  

locals and improves their natural and geological knowledge.    

According to Azman et al. (2010), one of the key factors for sustainable conservation in 

geoparks is the level of awareness of stakeholders, particularly the local communities. 

Regarding this Langkawi Geopark (Malaysia) prepared a special brochure explaining 

Langkawi Geopark and distributed it to local villagers, organized a regional conference, 

involved local women in geopark activities, encouraged locals to diversify their traditional 

activities to commercial activities and made a short announcement about geoparks in the 

mosques.

Sustainable development in recycling the hawksbill turtle hatchery with the help of indige-

nous people was a strategy in Qeshm Global Geopark, Iran. This movement not only pre-

served marine turtles but also created seasonal job opportunities for locals (UNDP, 

2003a). In this project which is supported by UNDP (United Nations Development  

Programme), local people are paid by the government for their contribution in collecting 

the turtle eggs and then transferring them to the protected coast in Shibderaz which is 

managed by local people. This successful experience saved 27000 turtle eggs and 16000 

turtles in 2003. 

At present, preservation of marine turtles continues under the support of Qeshm Geopark 

and local Environmental Department.  

A pilot project in Salakh village was another strategy in Qeshm Geopark territory. It was 

developed for the rehabilitation of natural marine resources through an indigenous method 

of artificial reefing. The process of artificial reefing is completed, secured, and guarded by 

local fishermen (UNDP, 2001). 

Aquaculture of pearls by the local community, especially women of the Berkeh Khalaf  

village, was the third strategy for preserving natural resources and entrepreneurship for 

local women in Qeshm Geopark (UNDP, 2003b). 

Moreover, the Copper Coast European Geopark (Ireland) collaborated in the construction 

of a wetland project for preserving a bog, and the eco-park used the development of this 

integrated constructed wetland to organically treat their waste water whilst supporting a 

diverse range of flora and fauna, and improving the beautiful environmental features. It 

has the added benefit of maintaining the character of the surrounding landscape. This  

project created 350 job opportunities for locals (Richardson and Shakespeare, 2009). 

Aside from local communities’ involvement, integrating national and international events 

with geopark activities is another strategy for earth conservation. For instance, on World 

Forest Day, Casa do Forno outdoor company and geobakery with Naturtejo Geopark  

invited media and the local people from the village of Orvalho to know more about cultiva-

tion of native plants, touching the soil to plant a Viburnum or a Prunus lusitanica, two of 

the endangered tree species to be found at Fraga da Água d’Alta geosite. This natural 

monument presents one of the last natural refuges in Europe for the evergreen forest that 

existed more than 2 million years ago.  

Moreover, On Clean Portugal Day (20th March) Naturtejo Geopark, Castelo Branco, 

Oleiros, Proença-a-Nova and Idanha-a-Nova municipalities supported the initiative and 



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

68 

invited about 550 volunteers to clean the geopark territory. Despite the rain, they cleaned 

83 tons of garbage (Naturtejo Geopark Authorities, 2010b). 

In addition, geoparks have an important role in landscape preservation. Therefore, the  

officials of geoparks rebuild historic and old places instead of modernizing them. Regard-

ing this the Réserve Géologique de Haute-Provence European Geopark (France) has  

rebuilt an old house for the art installment in Veil Esclangon (Unjah,2008), and the 

Naturtejo European Geopark (Portugal), at Portas de Almourão geomonument, and 

Penha Garcia Ichnological Park, has changed the use of four dilapidated historical build-

ings; they have been converted to popular tourism facilities like a conference hall, tourism 

office, and museum to follow the tenets of sustainable tourism in the geopark. It is  

noteworthy that Casa de Forno which is located in Naturtejo Geopark (Portugal) territory 

was an ancient community oven that was almost in ruins in 2007, and was saved by a  

local couple of geologists and their family; it has been turned into cosy accommodation 

and a geobakery (Geraldes and Ferreira, 2009).  

Moreover, Naturtejo Geopark (Portugal), in order to protect the geological heritage of  

Portas de Almourão geosite from flooding, contributed to the project of building the Alvito 

Reservoir 1 km upstream. The implementation of this project caused less environmental 

impact on the geomonument. In the project there were several environmental issues such 

as: following up the project in order to minimize impact on the geological heritage; devel-

oping heritage and valuing the region; and eliminating barriers for the ichthyofauna. These 

were controlled by the Naturtejo Geopark (Carvalho and Rodrigues, 2010b).  

Since education and involvement of locals in conservation projects can be ways for  

conservation of natural heritage (ecological-geological), the next section will focus on the 

educational activities and programs, as a strategy for conservation of natural heritage in 

geoparks around the world.  

 

2.11.1.2.  Educational Activities in Geoparks 

In fact, since long ago people have come to visit "geological wonders” like mountains, 

caves, and canyons. However, only in recent times has there been a real challenge in this 

sector and geological heritage has been developed into a market (geotourism) with very 

specific and novel characteristics. 

Nature Tourism is supported by sustainable use of natural heritage and promoting nature 

awareness, through interpretation. Nature Tourism as a niche market has grown world 



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

69 

wide in recent years and looks for certified destinations, as the authors want to develop it 

in geoparks under the auspices of UNESCO. 

Geotourism is an emerging segment of Nature Tourism in which the objective focuses on 

geodiversity. A new niche market was created for business with new specificities and new 

contingencies that not only accompanies the general trends of tourism but also imposes 

its own trends. Geoparks are pioneers in geotourism and an example of sustainable local 

development. A geopark acts as a partnership of people and land managers working to 

promote earth heritage through education and sustainable tourism (Bailey and Hill, 2010).  

Dias and Brilha (2004) noted that in order to increase public awareness about geological 

heritage, some initiatives should be implemented for each protected area, like geological 

and geomorphological maps, as well as a geosite map, a geological guidebook, web 

pages, geological trails, and interpretative panels. These are all examples of innovation 

(Figure 2.16).   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 2.16 - Proposed initiatives in order to increase public awareness of geological  

heritage (Source: Dias and Brilha, 2004) 

Geological processes with high scientific interest can be associated with aesthetics and 

become geosites, with tourism potential. The intention is to stimulate knowledge of geodi-

versity, geoconservation, and sustainable development. 



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism

Beside geodiversity, geotourism has some other benefits; a site with rich geological heri-

tage should have cultural, historical, and natural (bio and geo) approaches. But it is impor-

tant to present a good interpretation and supportive structure.  

A geopark organizes activities and provides logistic support to communicate geoscientific 

knowledge and environmental concepts to the public. This is accomplished through  

protected and interpreted geosites. 

Museums, information centres, geo-trails, guided tours, school class excursions, popular 

publications, maps, educational materials and displays, seminars, and so on are strate-

gies applied by geoparks to educate locals and tourists. A plan for sustainable develop-

ment in a geopark territory needs interdisciplinary studies and cooperation among univer-

sities, local authorities, and different stakeholders (Andr??anu, 2005). A geopark also fos-

ters scientific research and cooperation with universities and research institutes, stimulat-

ing the dialogue between the geosciences and the local population. Moreover, a geopark 

can create the framework, motivation, and support for integrated research, education and 

training.  

Education, as a lifelong process, is widely accepted as a fundamental prerequisite for the 

achievement of sustainable development. It is also recognized as a means of changing 

consumption and production patterns to a more sustainable path (DiSano, 1995).  

Since education is a target of geopark creation and local schoolchildren’s education can 

have serious consequences for sustainable development, most of the geoparks, as  

spectacular outdoor classrooms, have set up educational work programmes to re-orient 

education towards sustainable development.  

Geoeducation, formal or informal, is a part of the conservation purposes of geological heri-

tage sites that have worth for scientific, educational, and aesthetic reasons. Inventory, da-

tabases, and maps of sites are not enough for geopark conservation; it is necessary to set 

up educational strategy in partnership with local schools, universities, and local councils. 

The aim of the Global Geoparks Network is to provide a platform of cooperation and  

exchange of knowledge between experts and practitioners in geological heritage matters 

under the umbrella of UNESCO. Establishing geopark museums and interpretive centres, 

holding annual conferences of the European Geoparks Network and the Global Geoparks 

Network, holding annual meetings, organizing workshops for tourists and locals, publish-

ing books, newspapers, and magazines, interviewing on TV and organizing radio training 



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

71 

for tour guides, and investing in educational programs for schoolchildren and universities 

are geopark enterprises in this regard.  

For instance, officials of Naturtejo European Geopark (Portugal) believe that educational 

programs can be a means of conservation of geomonuments and natural heritage.  

Accordingly, they implement an educational program for schools and universities. 

Naturtejo Geopark started the educational programs in 2007 and by the end of 2009 they 

had succeeded in educating 3813 students and teachers between the ages of 4 to more 

than 70 years old. This program embraces two educational activities including ‘School 

Meets the Geopark’ and ‘The Geopark Goes to School’. In this regard, the geopark has 

employed local geologists and former teachers, since no one knows the geopark territory 

better than locals (Catana and Rocha, 2009).  

Apart from the educational program for schoolchildren, Naturtejo Geopark established a 

dinosaur exhibition in 2010. This exhibition received 22041 visitors, over the course of 7 

months, in many educational programs (Naturtejo Geopark Authorities, 2010c).   

Furthermore, officials of Arouca European Geopark (Portugal) play a vital role in educa-

tional programs and at the end of 2009 they succeeded in educating 3956 pupils and 331 

teachers who came from all over the country (Catana and Rocha, 2009). Likewise, the 

geopark runs an educational project called “Geoteca”. This project was initially developed 

for local school libraries and the main goal of the project was to improve the knowledge of 

students and teachers about Arouca Geopark (Rocha et al., 2009). In this regard, the 

geopark held a workshop entitled “Make your own Trilobite”. This workshop reinforced the 

knowledge of the students about trilobites and geopark activities; the children painted  

trilobites and dressed up as trilobites, raft boats and hikers at Carnival 2009.  

Moreover, the Réserve Géologique de Haute-Provence European Geopark (France), with 

a view to geo-education, established the so-called “Georium” in the Museum Premonade, 

as a part of an interactive tool for schoolchildren from 6 to 13 years old. 

Besides, in order to maintain the standard of scientific information and quality of guides, all 

guides are encouraged to take the course with the Réserve. At present, 23 active nature 

guides have joined the Réserve domestic network. Guides and their partners, through 

educational programs, have attracted much more tourist attention to this area. Training 

geotourism guides is another educational innovative activity in this territory (Unjah, 2008).  

Holding workshops for children on minerals, water, and volcanoes and organizing work-

shops for adults on volcanology, minerals, and fossils are educational activities in  



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

72 

Vulkaneifel European Geopark (Germany). Moreover, Vulkaneifel European Geopark  

organizes the Willi Basalt tour for schoolchildren (Frey et al., 2006). 

Establishing an educational centre in the noble castle that looks over the medieval town of 

Aínsa in the heart of the Sobrarbe Geopark (Spain) is another strategy, which not only  

increases the locals’ and tourists’ knowledge but also preserves the castle as historical 

heritage. The noble castle has discarded its defensive role and become a vacationing, 

educational, and cultural complex; some of its recently created spaces are related to the 

geopark. The three new facilities, the Sobrarbe Geopark visitor centre “Space of the  

Sobrarbe Geopark”, the “Technical Office”, and the “Geovision Room” were considered in 

the Master Plan (2004-2007) and spread out among the northeast and southeast towers 

of the Aínsa Castle (EGN, 2009a) 

The Landscape Model of Water Erosion is a place (11 × 9 m in size) which represents the 

geological approach to water activities. This model is an innovative educational model for 

kids to know more about the water erosion process in the Eisenwurzen European 

Geopark, Austria (Kollmann et al., 2009). Tourists and kids feel like Gulliver in Lilliput Land 

when they visit the landscape model of water erosion in Gallen Park (Kollmann and  

Mitterbäck, 2009) 

The GeoBox project and Geo-workshops are other educational programs for schoolchil-

dren in Nature Park Eisenwurzen (Austria); these activities are concentrated on erosion, 

rivers, fossils and rocks (Ramsay et al., 2010b).  

Zouros (2010) urged the Lesvos Petrified Forest European Geopark (Greece) to organize 

environmental education programs for elementary and high school. In addition, activities 

such as geosite recognition, fossil excavation and conservation, nature observation, and 

bird watching are other educational programs in Lesvos Geopark. Normally, schools visit 

the geopark during the spring and autumn, outside the main tourist period. A variety of 

educational tools have been created for the needs of environmental education programs 

(such as museum kits, an educational CD, booklets, student booklets) for all levels of 

education. The two museum kits focus on plant fossils and volcanic rocks. Besides, the 

geopark supports university field camps dedicated to various scientific disciplines.  

Moreover, Lesvos Petrified Forest Geopark offers pupils knowledge about earthquakes; in 

this regard it installed a seismic table simulator at the Natural History Museum of the  

Lesvos Petrified Forest to create an opportunity for schoolchildren to experience an earth-

quake simulation (Zouros et al., 2010).   



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

73 

Furthermore, the visitor information centre (The Lady Nelson) in Australian Global 

Geopark, Kanawinka, gives visitors both professional and recreational overview of the  

region, and this place helps in employing local and other scientists, writers, photogra-

phers, and artists to produce dedicated geopark literature. In addition, the visitors can en-

joy seeing and hearing the erupting neon volcano in the geology room of the visitor centre 

and they can have a walking tour in a glass floor cave (The Lady Nelson Centre, 2009). 

In 2008, English Riviera European Geopark (UK) ran a project titled “Rock It!” This is a 

two-year community development and education project that is focusing entirely on work-

ing with local people to enhance awareness and enjoyment of the geopark. Schools and 

other youth groups are being given the opportunity to experience various geological sites 

with local schools. Curriculum linked resources, educational support materials and  

programs of study are being developed in partnership with local teachers through new and 

existing networks. In addition, the project is providing information and interpretation mate-

rials to the public and educational groups. The project improved educational tools such as 

signposting, providing maps and information in the form of leaflets and developing the 

geopark website (Acland, 2009). 

Gea Norvegica European Geopark (Norway) has designed a site for students and teach-

ers of secondary schools (Figure 3.20). Also, Gea Norvegica Geopark has developed 

some fundamental educational packages to be used in primary and secondary schools. 

Consequently, in March 2007, with the geopark’s collaboration, geology became defined 

in the curriculum of secondary schools (Geo1 and Geo2) (Annual Report, 2007). 

It is worth mentioning that Adamello Brenta Geopark (Italy) organizes educational activity 

under the brand of “Park Quality” and until 2011, 19 schools among 59 schools located in  

geopark territory were awarded “Park Quality” (Mase and Maestranzi, 2011).  

Regarding educational activity the Sobrarbe Geopark (Spain) established several trails, 

such as: karst trail, fluvial terraces trail and glacial landscapes trail, for pupils aged 12-16 

(Ribas, 2011).  

Consequently, apart from Global Geopark conferences, European Geopark conferences 

and meetings, which play an important role in the exchange of knowledge, each geopark 

offers a wide range of environmental education programs (related to culture, ecology and 

geology) and field trips to find approaches to conservation, development, and public 

awareness.  



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism

Regarding educational activity, each geopark tries to apply new strategies, by establishing 

themed museums, establishing theme networks and trails, providing educational tools for 

visitors, schoolchildren and kids (geotourism maps, signposts, interpretative panels, work-

shops, geotour guides, etc.), organizing meetings between geopark authorities and local 

communities and holding conferences that constitute good examples.   

Thus, educational activities in geoparks can not only be a solution for achieving sustain-

able development but they also increase the awareness of local communities and visitors 

about their environment and the earth where they live. It is noteworthy that the idea of 

education in geoparks includes non-formal education for people who are not at school 

anymore as well.  

 

2.12.  Innovation in Geoparks 

There are various definitions of the term “innovation”, which derives from the Latin  

“innovatio” meaning the creation of something new (Table 2.7). Innovation includes both 

major and minor changes; major change being called radical innovation (Urabe, 1988). 

Innovation creates different (and hopefully better) approaches and thus innovation is a key 

that may unlock growth (Sundbo, 2009). For the innovative enterprise to create pure profit, 

the innovation should generate and maintain a unique competitive advantage in relation to 

competitors in the domestic market as well as in international trade. 

All of the following introductions indicate that innovation is a new idea or brainwave, which 

ends up creating new products, structure, technology, and so on, but this new idea, should 

be profitable for business or industry.

Table 2.7 - Innovation definitions from 1995 – 2009 

 

Innovation definitions

Innovation is the core of competition and the dynamic efficiency of firms and industries 
(Schummpeter, 1934).  

Innovation refers to the process of bringing any new, problem solving idea into use. Ideas for re-
organizing, cutting costs, putting in new budgetary systems, improving communication or assem-
bling products in terms are also innovation. Innovation is the generation, acceptance, and imple-
mentation of new ideas, processes, products, or services (Kanter, 1983). 

Innovation consists of the generation of a new idea and its implementation into a new product, 
process, or service, leading to the dynamic growth of the national economy and the increase of 
employment as well as to a creation of pure profit for the innovative business enterprise (Urabe, 
1988). 

Innovation is the search for, and the discovery of, development, improvement, adoption, and 
commercialization of new processes, new products, and new organizational structures and proce-
dures (Shy, 1995). 

Innovation is generation of new or improved products, introduction of new production processes, 
development of new sales markets; development of new supply markets, and reorganisation and 
/or restructuring of the company; this definition has distinguished the five areas (Schumpeter, 
1997). 

An innovative community is therefore able to bring in new methods and ideas that can improve its 
environment and initiate changes through the imaginative ideas or artistic ability of its people 
(Velasquez et al., 2005). 

Successful innovation, e.g. innovation that is also profitable to the tourism firm in a competitive 
market must increase the value of the product or tourism experience (Weiermair, 2006). 

Innovation has to do with doing things differently (and hopefully better) and thus, innovation is a 
key that unlocks growth (Sundbo, 2009) 

 

Innovation systems are both social and dynamic. It is dynamic due to the ‘financial flows 

between government and private organizations, human flows between universities, firms, 

and government laboratories, regulation flows originating from government agencies  

towards innovation organizations, and knowledge flows among these institutions’ (McLean 

and Pillia, 2005). The complexity of linkages in a system of innovation is well summarized 

by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) diagram  

illustrated in Figure 2.17.

Figure 2.17- Actors and linkages in the innovation system (Source: OECD, 1999) 

 

The tourism industry is often said to be less innovative than other industries (Hjalager, 

2002, 2010; Tetzschner and Herlau, 2003). Successful innovation is that which is also 

profitable to the tourism firm in a competitive market and increases the value of the prod-

uct or tourism experience (Weiermair, 2006). Nowadays, the globalization of cultures and 

food both encourage social innovation in response to tourism. For example, where power-

ful destination influencers encourage the ‘freezing’ of cultural characteristics and manifes-

tations in order to show tourists lifestyles and culture as visitor attractions, then technology 

and innovation are used to reinforce images of the past, in effect, establishing museums in 

order to exhibit spaces and the local culture of people for the sake of tourism. However, 

tourists’ interest in local culture may reassert or reawaken local interest leading to cultural 

pride and revival (Burns, 2006). 

Hjalager (2002) argued an appropriate sub-division of innovation into five categories: 

product, process, management, logistic and institutional innovation. In recent decades, 

geotourism, as a new marketing niche, needs innovative strategies to attract more tourists 

to geotourism destinations such as geoparks.   



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

77 

Geoparks through promoting geotourism and applying initiatives under the umbrella of 

Networks (Global Geoparks Network, European Geoparks Network, Asia-Pacific 

Geoparks Network, National and Local Geoparks Networks) try to popularize geological 

sciences, revive traditional culture, and promote local development (Farsani et al., 2010).    

In 2007, Jonathan B. Tourtellot noted that the enemy of geotourism is sameness (Miller 

and Washington, 2009). Thus, innovative strategies have an axial role in attracting tourists 

toward geotourism destinations.  

However, geoparks as ideal destinations for alternative tourism in rural areas are not an 

exception to that rule. In the following, some innovative activities in geoparks are summa-

rized.   

TERRAGAZE mobile, which is a portable multimedia system directed at geotourism and 

geosciences education, is an innovative technology in geoparks. This electronic geological 

guide was recently improved by GPS support. In some geoparks a multimedia guide is 

available for rent, while some bicycles in geoparks are equipped with TERRAGAZE  

(Baucon, 2009). 

Providing a 3D virtual tour around the Adamello Brenta European Geopark (Italy) is  

another example of innovative technology in geoparks. The film has been made by means 

of the software 3D Real Time Exploration. This simulates a virtual flight over the protected 

area and visitors can visit the geosites. In addition, an MP3 audio guide is available for 

free download, and the visitors can transfer the file to their MP3 player or mobile phone 

(Ferrari and Mase, 2009).  

Psiloritis European Geopark in Greece invited the artists and craftsmen from Germany, 

France, and Psiloritis area to exchange ideas and to increase the bonds between the 

management bodies of the Park and the local artists and craftsmen in order to create  

innovative strategies and products (Skoula and Fassoulas, 2006). 

Casa do Forno, as a family-rural accommodation and geo-bakery, joined the local network 

of partners from Naturtejo European Geopark (Portugal). They also have a close collabo-

ration with geopark authorities. Casa do Forno has created some geo-products (local 

products which are symbols of, and provide information on geological heritage such as 

trilobite cakes and Orogenic toasts) as innovative products. Naturtejo Geopark has permit-

ted them to use the geopark logo for their geo-products (Geraldes and Ferreira, 2009).   

The establishment of the geo-restaurant Petiscos &amp;amp; Granitos in Monsanto historical village 

is an innovative activity in Naturtejo European Geopark territory (Portugal). This village is

78 

situated on the slopes of a granite inselberg, where the houses were built in the  

middle of giant boulders. It is worth mentioning that the restaurant includes a granite cave 

and serves a Geo-Dinner during events (Rodrigues and Carvalho, 2009). 

Development of thematic visits in Naturtejo Geopark is one more innovative strategy in 

this territory. Concerning this, a mine trail was built in this geopark. This walking trail is the 

starting point for the development of a centre of geo-mining interpretation for the region of 

Idanha-a-Nova (Rodrigues et al., 2010).  

Developing a geopark trails network which is also equipped for disabled visitors is another 

innovative strategy in Beigua Geopark (Italy). Horse riding can be done in some parts of 

trails, and a facility for learning “orienteering” has been created. Establishing a small geo-

logical laboratory for children and an audio-visual hall are other strategies in order to 

transform natural heritage into sustainable development. In addition, the geopark, with the 

aim of enhancing the touristic success of the geopark, is organizing a new project called 

“Beigua Card”. The owner of this card can take advantage of a series of special offers and 

discounts in different commercial activities of the geopark (Burlando, et al., 2011).    

Establishment of brine swimming pools and salt baths in Subbetica Geopark (Spain) is 

another geo-innovation offered to inhabitants and visitors of this geopark (Arroyo and 

Barquero, 2010).  

Furthermore, a twinning agreement between geoparks is another innovative approach for 

better management of geoparks. 

Organizing twinning projects, twinning exhibitions in rural areas of two geopark territories 

and twinning thematic courses for universities of two geoparks can be strategies for  

promoting geotourism, culture, commerce and sharing knowledge. Twinning agreements 

and sister partnerships between geoparks are starting points for close cooperation  

between geoparks.  

For instance, Stone Forest Global Geopark (China) and Xingwen Global Geopark (China) 

have many similarities in some aspects, including geological formation and structure, so 

signing the twinning agreement was quite beneficial to their mutual learning and common 

development (GGN, 2009). 

Sa et al., (2010) provide an overview of a twinning agreement of cooperation between 

Arouca Geopark (Portugal) and Araripe Geopark (Brazil). This collaboration allowed the 

Brazilian team to improve their knowledge about the management of a geopark as project 

of sustainable development.  



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

79 

Owing to the establishment of transboundary geoparks – such as Novohrad-Nógrád 

Geopark, located in the border of Slovakia and Hungary – the authorities of the geopark 

launched a project title “ how to organize a transboundary geopark”  which can be a new 

model of geopark management ( Loska, 2011).  

In addition, in 2007 Lushan Geopark (China) and Bergstrasse-Odenwald (Germany)  

implemented a partnership in a wide range of topics like the development of geotouristic 

products, management, visitor services, infrastructure, geo-education and public informa-

tion. Regarding this, they prepared panels with information about both geoparks in three 

languages (Chinese, German and English), and established a common geopark booth in 

fairs (Weber et al., 2010).   

Kanawinka Geopark includes landscapes according to the period and type of eruption, 

including Australia’s youngest volcanoes, highly accessible volcanic cave systems, off-

shore volcanic islands, remains of coastal volcanoes, and extensive systems of craters, 

lakes, and wetlands. In order to educate visitors a geology room is designed for them in 

the geopark visitor centre where the visitors can enjoy seeing and hearing the erupting 

neon volcano. Moreover, organizing a walking tour in glass floor cave is another innova-

tive activity in Kanawinka Geopark (The Lady Nelson Centre, 2009). 

Using sustainable energy to reduce air pollution is a sustainable innovative strategy  

applied by Naturepark TERRA.vita (Germany). E-bikes are equipped with an electric  

motor to ease biking in hilly areas. About 25 to 30 recharging stations are installed along 

the trails. The stations are equipped with a solar panel to provide carbon-free energy for 

the bike batteries (Escher, 2010).  

Regarding conservation and sustainable use of mushrooms and truffles in Andalucía, a 

mycological garden was established in Sierras Subbeticas Geopark (Spain). This centre 

includes exhibition rooms, a microclimatic room of living mushrooms, audio-visual room, 

laboratory, library and mycological herbarium; the garden opened to the public in January 

2011 (Arroyo and Barquero, 2011).   

Establishment of the Beja garden geological time trail, focussing on the geological forma-

tion of south Portugal, from Precambrian to Quaternary, is a further innovative strategy for 

promoting geotourism, which developed by LNEG and Beja Municipality (Matos et al., 

2011).  

Furthermore, mud therapy, pelotherapy, geo-wine – “like Terras de Lava, Magma, Ba-

salto, Lajido, Pedras Brancas” – labelled from volcanic products, geo-cooking – “ Cozido

das Furnas” – volcanic taste, and geo-poems are production innovations in the aspiring 

Azores Geopark, Portugal ( Rocha et al., 2011; Nunes, et al., 2011).   

With the purpose of highlighting innovative activities in geoparks, chapter 4 will focus on 

geopark introduction, one by one, and will explain about innovative strategies which are 

applied by geoparks and in chapter 4, part 2, on the basis of Hjalager’s (2002) definition of 

innovation, the innovative strategies in geoparks will be described in the frame of the five 

categories (production innovation, process innovation, management innovation, logistic 

innovation, and institutional innovation). 

 

2.13.  Geopark Networks: An Innovative Approach  

According to Hjalager’s definition (2002) collaborative structures and authority systems 

belong to the category of management innovation; thus, nowadays, collaboration in the 

form of Clusters or Networks (horizontal or vertical) is recognized as innovation in  

management, especially in rural development.  

Knoke and Kuklinski (1983:12) explain networks as “a specific type of relation linking a set 

of persons, objects or events”. Porter (1998:78) describes clusters as “geographic concen-

trations of interconnected companies and institutions in a particular field, linked by com-

monalities and complementarities”.    

Novelli et al. (2005) noted that networks and clusters as a framework can provide small 

and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with innovative opportunities to operate in a com-

petitive tourism environment. Most countries such as Italy, Belgium, France, United King-

dom, Denmark, The Netherlands, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Spain, and Australia 

apply network and cluster projects as management innovation. It is worth mentioning that 

Italy’s clusters are widely spread and are part of the traditional economic process with no 

legislation in place.  

Berda et al. (2006) argued that tourism in Europe is dominated by small and medium-

sized enterprises (SMEs) and most of them are in the form of family-owned businesses. 

She supposed that these kinds of businesses can stimulate competition and play an  

important role in creating job opportunities and the development of the local economy; 

however, globalization has led to a growing pressure on them. From the other point of 

view globalization provides an opportunity to benefit from the open world market. The 

emergence of tourism clusters, the establishment of networks and strong partnerships 

among private sectors, and between public and private sectors are examples of benefits. 



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

81 

Lowe et al. (1995) described that interconnection between areas and networks as an  

important factor in rural development.  

Network activity in rural areas of Wales (United Kingdom) increased economic activities 

and sustainability at a local level (Day, 1998). Murdoch (2000) noted that the network  

approach in rural areas as a new paradigm of rural development is useful because it links 

together the development issues which are internal to rural areas with problems and  

opportunities that are external.  

Australia’s rural areas, with the intention of solving challenges in social, economic and  

environmental terms (irrigation and dryland salinity, soil erosion, soil acidity, water quality, 

and pest animals and plants), established local networks named the Landcare Network, 

Holbrook Network and Woady-Yaloak Network. For the purpose of improving network  

activity each network tries to apply a strategy. For instance, the Landcare Network fosters 

new ways of communicating across the area. Moreover, the Holbrook Network opened a 

tourist information centre in the main street to facilitate the exchange of information about 

Landcare issues in the district. The Woady-Yaloak Network also organizes bus tours for 

visiting groups such as schools, universities, agency staff, sponsors and politicians. In  

addition, the networks increased the effectiveness of volunteers in rural areas (Sobels et 

al., 2001).  

The Schist Villages Program (Portugal) was implemented in 2001 by the Commission for 

Coordination and Regional Development Centre (CCDRC). This program involved twenty 

four villages and was aimed at rural development. Regarding this, they established a local 

network, rural accommodation, and designed a logo for use with local products. Organiz-

ing tours, preparing a calendar and opening a shop “Loja do Xisto” (for supplying local 

products) were other activities for local development through tourism (Agência Desen-

volvimento Turístico, 2008).   

According to Lee et al. (2005) the results of a European pilot project in rural areas of six 

different countries: Finland, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Scotland and Sweden, illustrated that 

fostering networks can have long-term beneficial results. Indeed, networks create oppor-

tunities for learning and local development (High et al., 2005).  

High et al. (2005) believed that an informal structure in terms of networks and communi-

ties can be a strategy in rural development.    

It can be said that the creation of networks is an important factor in rural tourism develop-

ment. Engaging local communities in network activities can develop new products and 



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

82 

service innovation as well as the generation of new social economic and intangible capital 

that can lead to a regional competitive advantage (Hall, 2005).  

Based on the results of Romeiro and Costa (2010) in the Valle del Jerte (Spain) a rural 

tourism network helps to maximize the sustainability of employment and stimulate proc-

esses of social innovation. Furthermore, local networks contribute to the development of 

rural areas.  

In the last decade, the establishment of three formal social-scientific networks (the Global 

Geoparks Network, the European Geoparks Network, and the Asia Pacific Geoparks  

Network) are a novel paradigm for rural development.  

According to Zouros (2004) and Zouros and McKeever (2009) the European Geoparks 

Network was set up by four regions located in rural areas of different European Countries 

– France, Germany, Spain, and Greece – to reduce problems such as slow economic  

development, unemployment, and a high level of emigration. After that in 2004, the Global 

Geoparks Network was set up.  

Both networks aim at popularizing geology, developing the local economy, exchanging 

information, sustaining cultural identity and preserving geological and biological heritage.  

Apart from the UNESCO Global Geoparks Network (GGN), European Geoparks Network 

(EGN), and Asia Pacific Geoparks Network (A.P.G.N) activities, some countries such as 

Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and China have developed national and 

local geopark networks to create close collaboration between geoparks and tourism  

sectors, schools, universities, and businesses. The establishment of the German 

Geoparks Network, Italian National Geoparks Forum, Ireland Geoparks Forum and 

Greece National Geoparks Forum are examples of network activities in geopark territories 

on a smaller scale – country scale – which follow the rules of, and provide assistance to, 

the continental networks that nowadays constitute the Global Geoparks Network.  

Recently, the Taiwan Geopark Network was set up to promote the concept of geoparks, to 

exchange the experience of management of the sites and to educate visitors to protect the 

landscape for the purpose of sustainable development and promoting economic activities 

(Lin, 2011).   

Thus, it can be said that the European Geopark Network and the UNESCO Global 

Geoparks Network introduced the network concept to geo-sciences and geotourism. The 

establishment of geopark networks enables the exchange of ideas, experiences, and best 

practices, thereby helping each other to fulfil their common goals: conservation of natural, 



Chapter 2- Literature Review of Concepts related to Geopark and Geotourism 

83 

geological and cultural heritage, education, and development of the local economy 

through geotourism. 

Moreover, national and local networks not only provide an opportunity for exchange of 

knowledge, but also encourage the locals and private sectors to participate in geopark  

activities. 

Whereas the private sector and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in villages 

such as family businesses only undertake innovation if it promises to be profitable, 

Geopark Networks provide opportunities and possibilities for rural small and medium-sized 

enterprises (SMEs) to apply innovation. For instance, if a local businessperson or  

producer joins the geopark local network as an open economy model, she/he can take 

advantage of the recommendation of geopark authorities for creative innovation, together 

with the usage of the geopark brand for local products which are related to geopark activi-

ties, besides the possibility of being introduced to other geopark markets, at a national and 

international level. Furthermore, under the umbrella of the network, local businesspeople 

become stronger and more profitable. They also become eager to apply innovation. 

Geoparks as new tourism destinations, through promoting geotourism and applying initia-

tives under the umbrella of Networks (Global Geoparks Network, European Geoparks 

Network, National and Local Geoparks Networks) try to popularize geological sciences, 

revive traditional culture, and promote local development (Farsani et al., 2010).     

 

2.14.  Summary and Conclusions 

Based on the results of literature review, geoparks and geotourism are new recent  

subjects, so geopark activities have not been studied thoroughly yet. This study tries to  

introduce geoparks as new tourism destinations.  

According to the literature reviews geoparks follow three targets (education, conservation 

and geotourism) and innovative strategies are key factors to attain these goals (Figure 

2.18).    

As Figure 2.18 illustrates geomorphological and geological assets can also have a socio-

economic value if they can be used for geotourism purposes. Nowadays, creation of 

geoparks not only preserves geo-heritage but promotes the local economy through geot-

ourism as a niche market.

Geotourism is one of the core activities of geoparks which are under the umbrella of geo-

graphic tourism. It is obvious that development of the local economy would occur as a  

result of tourism activities. Moreover, geoparks are pioneers in the development of geot-

ourism; they strive to stimulate socioeconomic activities and sustainable development by 

attracting an increasing number of visitors. Regarding this, geoparks have applied innova-

tive strategies and facilities such as making geo-products, organizing geo-sports, estab-

lishing rural accommodation, providing geotourism maps, establishing geopark museums, 

and geo-sightseeing (Figure  2.19). 

Consequently, geoparks are key factors in geotourism development and they maximize 

geotourism to the benefit of the local economy and educate people about the evolution of 

their local landscape. Geoparks encourage local enterprises and cottage industries to get 

involved in geotourism and geo-marketing.

3.1.  Introduction  

While previous chapter consist of a literature review dealing with relevant concepts, the 

present chapter discusses and summarises the way in which the research process was 

carried out. The combined methods were used in this study. Using local and international 

data, this study was designed to investigate the role played by geoparks for rural devel-

opment. The aim of the research is to assess innovative strategies of geoparks to improve 

geotourism as a gateway for the local development in rural areas. 

This chapter starts with the hypotheses, followed by the specification of methodological 

procedures suggested for testing them (Figure 3.1). Moreover, this chapter presents some 

considerations on selecting international data (section 3.5.1), followed by the local data 

collection and analysis (section 3.5.2).

3.2.  Research Methods for Leisure and Tourism 

There are essentially three main styles of research in the social sciences that researchers 

in leisure and tourism can call upon and use (Finn et al., 2000). 

The survey method depends on a sample of respondents replying to a number of ques-

tions that have been previously determined as related to the research. By using the same 

questions for the selected sample of respondents, individuals in the sample may be com-

pared. Data can be collected through an interviewer-administered questionnaire or a self-

completion questionnaire. Surveys have the most important advantage of collecting a lot 

of information in a relatively short period of time. The survey can be used deductively by 

testing hypotheses, or inductively by looking for patterns in the data. It is the most  

common type of research style used by researchers in leisure and tourism.  

The experimental method is less common in leisure and tourism research. Ethnographic 

research involves a method of investigation where a culture is observed in its natural  

setting. Ethnographers study the complexity of social interaction as indicated in daily life 

(Finnet al., 2000).  

This study focuses on the survey method in the format of a case study. The case study 

method is one of several ways of doing social science research. The type of research 

questions posed plays an important role in selecting a method. In general, case studies 

are the preferred strategy when “how” or “why” questions are being posed. It is noteworthy 

that a basic categorization scheme for the types of questions is the familiar series: “who”, 

“what”, “where”, “how”, and “why” (Yin, 2003).  The main question of the study presented 

in this survey is how geoparks and geotourism can contribute in sustainable tourism. As 

“how” questions were designed in research questions, the case study method was  

selected for this thesis. This survey tries to explore the policies and new strategies (inno-

vation) pursued by the local government of geoparks in achieving the goals of sustainable 

tourism for locals in rural areas. 

 

3.3.  Theoretical Framework and Hypotheses Development  

3.3.1.  Theory Justification and Applicability 

Theory is applied as a guiding framework to help make clear and explain the research 

findings, and indicate the types of conditions under which the research has occurred. 

Thus, theory is a conceptual framework to help make sense of the research findings (Finn 

et al., 2000).

Based on the literature review in previous chapter, the UNESCO declaration on geoparks 

as a new model of sustainable development and protection of nature has highly evolved 

the strategy of local communities’ participation in protected and natural areas. It is stated 

that a geopark should aim for the development of the local territory and support local 

communities and products. Local communities should not be removed from the lands 

where they live, since the locals’ knowledge, traditional arts and traditional style of life play 

a vital role in geopark management. 

Geoparks and geotourism aim to develop the local economy in rural areas. According to 

McKeever and Zouros (2005) geotourism and geoparks claim to promote the local econ-

omy by sustainable tourism. Moreover, Zouros (2004) noted that the European Geoparks 

Network was established for solving problems such as slow economic development,  

unemployment, and a high level of emigration in rural areas of four countries (France, 

Germany, Spain, and Greece). Since local communities in rural areas are compatible with 

local custom and natural resources, for developing tourism, officials should pay particular 

attention to sociocultural and socio-environmental impacts of tourism on local communi-

ties. Regarding this, the author built a research question–How can geoparks and  

geotourism contribute in sustainable tourism?–to find out the policies and innovative 

strategies pursued by local government of geoparks in achieving goals of sustainable tour-

ism for locals in rural areas. The empirical study–through sending electronic question-

naires to all geoparks around the world–strives to highlight the role played by geoparks for 

the conservation of natural heritage, development of the local economy and sociocultural 

sustainability in surrounding villages of geoparks. In addition, interviewing local communi-

ties in Qeshm Geopark (Iran) reveals the local communities’ ideas about geotourism  

expansion and establishment of a geopark in their territory.  

 

3.3. 2.  Motivation and Objectives 

Arising from a personal interest in geology and geomorphology, this study was conducted 

after a realisation of the potential of geoparks as new geotourism destinations. 

Indeed, very few people know or show interest in our geological heritage, and the fact that 

before establishing geoparks these potentials were not being developed or optimally  

utilised. This research tries to discover and to introduce innovative strategies which 

geoparks, as a model of sustainable development in protected areas, have applied for 

promoting geotourism, reducing the negative impacts of tourism on sociocultural compo-

nents of local communities, conserving natural heritage, and developing the local econ-



Chapter 3 -Methodology of Empirical Study

omy in geopark territories. Lastly, the author would like to introduce geoparks and geo-

logical heritage as sustainable tourism destinations. The aims of the research and the key  

research questions are illustrated in Figure 3.2.

3.3.3. Hypotheses 

A hypothesis is an unsure statement that proposes a possible explanation for some  

phenomenon or event and a useful hypothesis can include a forecast. Pizam (2005) noted 

that hypotheses are important, indispensable and powerful tools of scientific research. 

However, there are many things in the research that are not fully understood; hypotheses 

try to make them clear. For example the literature reviews in previous chapter  

illustrated that the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization

(UNESCO) introduced geoparks as a sustainable development model for participating  

local communities in geopark activities. Thus, the following hypotheses (Table 3.1) were 

built to highlight the role played by geoparks for the local development in rural areas and 

geopark territories.   

Table 3.1 – Hypotheses (Source: own construction) 

  

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In order to test hypotheses two techniques were used. Firstly, two questionnaires were 

designed, one for local authorities of geoparks around the world and another for local 

communities of the surrounding villages of the Qeshm Geopark as a case study.  

According to Almeida (2010) existence of a clear connection between hypotheses, ques-

tions and corresponding sections in the literature review can be a good strategy for mate-

rialization of research investigation.  

Thus, the second technique (Table 3.2) was designed for creating a connection between 

hypotheses, sections and questions. 

Hypotheses 

H1: Geoparks involve local communities in conservation activities 

H2: Geoparks have positive socio- environmental impacts on local communities   

H4: Using geotourism can be a useful strategy for developing tourism in geoparks 

H5: Geoparks contribute to promoting regional geotourism products and local products 

H6: Geoparks promote geotourism through innovative strategies  

H3: Geotourism activities in geoparks create opportunities for local development  

H7: Geoparks contribute towards increasing geological knowledge and employment of 
local communities in rural areas and geopark territories 

H8: Geoparks contribute to minimizing the negative sociocultural impacts of tourism 
perceived by local communities  

H9: Geoparks do not function similarly in terms of management  

H10: Network activity in the EGN is stronger than in the GGN 

H11: The majority of collaboration in GGN and EGN is concentrated in the field of 
exchange of knowledge and knowledge transfer

3.4. Description of the Techniques for Leisure and Tourism 

3.4.1.  Quantitative and Qualitative Research  

At one level it is very easy to make a distinction between quantitative and qualitative  

research. Denzin and Lincoln (1994) noted that qualitative researchers believe that rich 



Chapter 3 -Methodology of Empirical Study 

95 

descriptions of the social world are valuable, whereas quantitative researchers are less 

concerned with such detail. The quantitative paradigm has been the main and accepted 

research tradition in many fields of leisure and tourism.  

According to Finn et al., (2000) quantitative research is classified as an empirical research 

where the data are in the form of numbers, and qualitative research where the data are 

not in the form of numbers. The quantitative technique is a rigorous scientific method and 

the qualitative research is less rigorous and employs more flexible tools of investigation.  

In addition, quantitative researchers can reach large numbers of people by clarifying real-

ity, whereas qualitative researchers deal with the complexity of reality but with more  

limited numbers. The difference between qualitative and quantitative research is demon-

strated in Table 3.3.

Hasse (2001) focused on community participation and stakeholder collaboration in tourism 

planning. In his study, data analysis was used by combining methods, firstly the qualitative 

analysis computer software package NVivo was utilised to systematize the grounded  

theory. Secondly, the quantitative method was applied to analyse the questionnaires of 

the community and visitor survey by means of software program Excel. The third part of 

the analysis was the design of PAGIS to represent the spatial data collected.  

In the present thesis in order to increase the validity of the research, the data analysis was 

also carried out by means of the NVivo software. The qualitative software NVivo is a  

useful tool for performing qualitative researches. It is used in this study to analyse the 

open questions. These open questions introduce the strategies for the conservation of 

geoparks.  



Chapter 3 -Methodology of Empirical Study 

96 

Stone (2002) through qualitative analysis sought to assess the current status of ecotour-

ism at two destinations where it is being promoted as a regional development strategy. 

Two National Parks (Jianfengling and Diaoluoshan National Forest Parks, in Hainan Prov-

ince, China) were selected for his investigation. Finally, ecotourism has been identified as 

an important provincial strategy for balancing economic growth and conservation in two 

case studies.   

Lepp (2004) by using a qualitative method in his thesis attempted to determine the impact 

of tourism in Bigodi (East Africa); Bigodi village is located next to Kibale National Park. 

Residents identified several benefits of tourism: money, improved agricultural markets, 

communal benefits and the idea that tourism benefits can arrive by chance. 

As mentioned in Figure 3.2 one of the aims of the present study is to identify the role of 

geoparks in socioeconomical sustainability in rural areas.   

The thesis of Saule (2004) is based on in-depth interviews with representatives of tourism 

service suppliers and local tourism and development agents. The goal of the aforemen-

tioned research is to find out how tourism can be used as a tool for local  

development. Aside from qualitative analysis, the SWOT method was used to determine 

the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the territory that can have an  

influence on tourism in Haute-Corrèze (France).  

With SWOT analysis, experiences gained from different geoparks, and the results of  

descriptive analysis helped the present thesis to recommend new strategies which  

reduce the negative impacts of tourism in the Qeshm Geopark territory, Iran.  

After gaining experiences from geoparks around the world by means of a literature review 

and questionnaires, in order to promote better management of the Qeshm Geopark (Iran), 

as a case study, the SWOT analysis method used.  

A Yellow Card was issued for the Qeshm Geopark activities illustrating that the Qeshm 

Geopark activities are not sufficient. SWOT analysis method was used to investigate the 

Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats of the Qeshm Geopark. Lastly, 

SWOT matrices were designed for geosites, ecological-sites, and cultural and archaeo-

logical heritage sites of the Qeshm Geopark.  

Hunter (2006) used a qualitative-interpretive paradigm to investigate the transference of 

sustainable tourism theory to practice by examining the extent to which the sustainable 

tourism planning philosophy is utilised in the planning practices of local tourism destina-

tions in Queensland (Australia). Moreover, the study developed a theoretical framework to 



Chapter 3 -Methodology of Empirical Study 

97 

facilitate the application of sustainability principles to local tourism destination planning. 

The findings illustrated in all cases investigated that the local government was also the 

driver of the planning process, and as such responsible for the fact that sustainability prin-

ciples did not support the process. While studies have discussed the fact that sustainabil-

ity depends on the agendas of stakeholders, particularly the local government, this study 

has added the idea that due to local governments’ considerable influence, the adoption of 

sustainability principles is also linked to the concept of power. The study therefore adds a 

further dimension to the sustainable tourism debate, that stakeholder influence and power 

can be the determining factor in the adoption of a sustainable approach to tourism  

planning. 

With regard to the role of the local government as a determining factor in implementation 

of principles of sustainable tourism, in this study a questionnaire was designed for local 

governments of geoparks to seek geopark strategies for sustainable tourism.  

Schellhorn (2007) by using combined methods (qualitative and quantitative) examined the 

effectiveness of tourism as an agent of rural development, focusing on culture and nature-

based destinations in the ‘developing world’. The study was carried out in the village of 

Desa Senaru at Gunung Rinjani National Park in Lombok Island, Indonesia. Based on the 

results, an increased quality of life the village of Desa Senaru depends on a healthy envi-

ronment, and hence requires a light ecological footprint. By reducing dependency on 

scarce resources, integrated development supports bio-diversity conservation. 

It is worth mentioning that some questions in this study strive to draw attention to the role 

played by geoparks for minimization of negative environmental impacts of tourism in the 

surrounding villages of geoparks.  

Jiang (2008) chose a qualitative method for collecting data; the study was conducted in 

Tengtou village, China, and she attempted to investigate the role of active involvement of 

local people at different levels of ecotourism. Her findings illustrated that involvement of 

local people is an important factor in sustainable development.  

Furthermore, Schweinsberg (2009) applied combined methods (qualitative and quantita-

tive) to assess the role of tourism as an agent of sustainable change in rural Australia. 

Based on the findings of his thesis, tourism sustainability in forest regions of Australia  

depends on the appreciation of local participation.  



Chapter 3 -Methodology of Empirical Study 

98 

Regarding the key role of the local involvement, this thesis is specifically concerned with 

the effect of establishment of geoparks on the participation of local communities in 

geopark activities.  

Boley (2009) by using Geographic Information System (GIS) and reviewing the quantita-

tive methods utilized in designing the survey instrument, pilot testing the instrument, col-

lecting the data, and analysing the results strived to introduce a geotourism map guide as 

a new educational tool for guiding geotravellers in the region of northwest Montana, 

southwest Alberta, and southeast British Columbia. The purpose of this study was to take 

the definition of geotourism provided by National Geographic and create a reliable and 

valid instrument capable of measuring geotouristic tendencies. 

 

3.4.2. Combined Methods 

Quantitative research is related with the hypothetico-deductive method of theory testing, 

and the qualitative method tries to find models in the data to inductively generate theory; 

but this is not set in stone. Methods using quantitative data can be used to generate  

hypotheses and develop theory, and qualitative research can be used to test hypotheses. 

Therefore, some research questions may demand qualitative data, others quantitative or a 

combination of the two.  

Finn et al., (2000) argued that combining qualitative and quantitative technique can maxi-

mise the strengths and minimise the weaknesses of each method.  

Thus, in this study a combined method was used to determine the role of the establish-

ment of geoparks for local development. Apart from the qualitative and quantitative meth-

ods, the SWOT method was used to evaluate the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, 

and Threats involved in the Qeshm Geoprak as a case study.  

The social network analysis technique is another method used to examine the connection 

between members of UNESCO Global Geoparks Network (GGN) and European 

Geoparks Network (EGN).  For visualisation relationships and clusters, the Pajek program 

was used.  

Batagelj and Mrvar (1998) developed Pajek (http://pajek.imfm.si/doku.php?id=pajek) as a 

program for large network analysis. They addressed that supporting abstraction by factori-

zation of a large network into several smaller networks. Providing the user with some 

powerful visualisation tools and implementing a selection of efficient algorithms for  

analysis of large networks are the main goals in the design of Pajek.   



Chapter 3 -Methodology of Empirical Study 

99 

Scott and Cooper (2007) by using network analysis in the Pajek program succeeded in 

understanding the structure of the Australian tourism industry in two states and five  

regions; also they identified product clusters in the network. 

In addition, Baggio et al. (2007) ran a project on the Island of Fiji and the Island of Elba in 

Italy to find out how network thinking can inform our understanding of interactions between 

tourism operators within a destination. In addition, the research discussed the use of the 

science and tools of network thinking to examine the structural properties of the network of 

hyperlinks between the websites of tourism operators in two destinations. In this regard 

the World Wide Web (WWW) is used to follow links from one page to another. Network 

analysis was applied in this study, and the results revealed the poor connectivity among 

the elements of the network.    

Costa and Baggio (2009) reported a complex network- based systematic analysis of Elba 

(Italy) as a tourism destination. The Network Analysis method was used to calculate 

measurements. The results illustrated that the Elba network could benefit from increased 

integration.   

Piao et al. (2010) used Pajek to visualise the agent relationships in the e-commerce 

transaction network as well. 

 

3.5.  Data Collection  

The research methodology includes both primary and secondary research. The first phase 

consists of an extensive literature review of existing reports on geotourism and geoparks.  

Excluding the book of Newsome and Dowling (2010) titled “geotourism: the tourism of 

geology and landscape” the other books paid more attention to geological features in 

geoparks. But the aforementioned book brings together a range of geotourism case  

studies from a number of countries and highlights the geopark activities and the role of 

geotourism for local development.  

The results of literature reviews and searching in scientific databases and Google Scholar 

demonstrate that the topic is new and geoparks and geotourism are a new subject  

recently, so geopark activities have not been studied thoroughly yet. Hence, data for this 

research was obtained from questionnaires.   

Quantitative research as a hypothetico-deductive method testing is the main technique in 

this survey. A questionnaire-based survey in face-to-face format at the local level in order 

to interview local communities of the Qeshm Geopark and an e-survey at international

level for the purpose of data gathering from the authorities of geoparks registered in 

UNESCO Global Geoparks Network were used.  

An e-survey as a new category of questionnaire-based surveys (mail) emerged via the 

internet (Veal, 2006). In a second phase, the author focused on geoparks registered in 

UNESCO and on comprehensive collected information about geoparks and their strate-

gies to improve geotourism and the development of the local communities, by sending 

electronic questionnaires to all geoparks. The questionnaire was completed using a 

WORD-processor and e-mailed back to the researcher. The empirical part of the second 

phase was conducted from March 2009 to January 2010.  

Since network activity is an innovation in geopark management, another electronic ques-

tionnaire was sent to geoparks to find out fields of collaboration between geoparks. The 

data for this part of research were gathered from October to November 2010.   

A questionnaire-based survey in face-to-face format (household survey and street survey) 

at local level was the third step for considering the role of geoparks for promotion of geot-

ourism and the local economy. Data for the third part were collected from July to August 

2009.  

The statistical results in both levels were analysed by statistical survey in SPSS tool.   

Beside SPSS, some of the open questions were analysed by means of the qualitative 

software NVivo. Moreover, Pajek software was used for visualization of collaboration  

between geoparks. 

It is worth mentioning that, beside the primary data, visitor numbers of geoparks as sec-

ondary data was used in this research.  

 

3.5.1. Selection of the International Data 

Observation was the first technique applied to gather information about the role of creation 

of geoparks for local development. Regarding this, three field trips were organized around 

the Qeshm, Arouca, and Naturtejo Geoparks.   

In addition, interviews provide an opportunity for detailed investigation of each individual’s 

personal perspective and for an in-depth understanding of the personal context within 

which the research phenomenon is found (Creswell, 2003). For better management of the 

case study the authors needed to get experiences from all geoparks around the world, 

since, as geopark and geotourism are new concepts, there were not enough related refer-

ences. Also travelling to all geoparks was time consuming. Therefore two questionnaires 

were designed using a word-processor to attain the innovative strategies in geoparks to 

promote geotourism, cultural sustainability, natural conservation and socioeconomic  

activities.  

To reach these goals in the first step the author will focus on geoparks registered in 

UNESCO and comprehensive collected information (by sending electronic questionnaires 

to all geoparks around the world (64) in 2009) (Appendix1) (Figure 3.3, and 3.4).

lishing a local network for collaboration of geoparks, the author believes that the result of 

sampling can be generalized to all geoparks.  

Attention should be drawn to the fact that all countries except China filled in the first ques-

tionnaires. Thus, if from a statistical point of view we exclude the Chinese geoparks (n=22) 

from the population (N=64), we end up with 42 geoparks registered in UNESCO. Bearing 

in mind that 25 questionnaires were sent back to us, it means, therefore, that the final  

response rate is increased to 59.5%.

Questions 1 to 5 inquire into the awareness of management function in geoparks and also 

try to ascertain whether geoparks take advantage of local communities in their team work 

or not. Besides this, this part reveals the role of cooperation in geopark activities.  

Perales (2002) noted that El Alto Palancia, within the Valencian region, using two brands, 

not only promotes environmental quality but also searches for the authentic in  

order to develop modern rural tourism. Moreover, Cai (2002) introduced privileges and 

immunities of cooperative branding, and illustrated that cooperative branding removes the 

limitation of geographic names related to individual cities and towns. Likewise, rural com-

munities can especially benefit from cooperative branding. Rural tourism marketing 

through cooperative branding tries to promote individual rural communities and to increase 

the use of tourism resources and synergizing drawing power of their attractions. Conse-

quently, brand marketing is indispensable in rural tourism (Yu-quan, 2007).  

The European Geoparks Network and the Global Geoparks Network adapted a common 

logo. The members of networks can use the logos for their activities, publications or prod-

ucts related to geopark activities (Zouros and Mckeever, 2009).    

It is evident from the literature review that rural tourism benefits from brand and logo  

promotion. Since, the majority of geoparks are located in the rural areas; questions 6 to 8 

investigate the role of a geopark brand for development of the local economy and geotour-

ism marketing.  

Questions 9 to 12 aim at evaluating the role of geoparks for developing the local economy. 

These questions have three major purposes. Firstly, they want to demonstrate the effects 

of the creation of geoparks on promoting local crafts and products. It is worth mentioning 

that regional products and handicrafts are cultural identities and promoting them can be a 

strategy for sociocultural sustainability.  

Secondly, these questions attempt to ascertain the role of geotourism marketing in the 

local economy in geoparks. Lastly, question 12 deals with entrepreneurship, in the form of 

seasonal and second job opportunities for local communities in geoparks.  

Questions 13 to 15 investigate the participation of local communities in geoparks conser-

vation activities. Questions 16 to 20 evaluate whether geotourism can be a useful strategy 

for developing tourism in geoparks?  

As education and exchange of knowledge are targets of establishment of geoparks, ques-

tions 21 to 23 were designed to evaluate how geoparks, through organizing workshops, 

improve the local economy and increase public awareness of tourists and local communi-

ties about cultural identities and geological knowledge. It goes without saying that each 

educational activity follows the local development.  

To give a more detailed description of the connection between questions and the main 

text of the thesis, table 3.5 was designed.

The data (close questions in questionnaires) were analysed using a statistical survey 

through SPSS tools. In addition, in order to increase the validity of the  

research, the data analysis was also carried out by means of the NVivo software. The 

qualitative software NVivo is a useful tool for performing qualitative researches. For this 

reason, NVivo was used in this study to analyse the open question (What are the conser-

vation activities in the geopark?) of the international questionnaires. This open question  

introduces strategies for conservation of geoparks. Appling NVivo software is a method to 

identify the key concepts in conservation of geological heritage.  

Since network activity is an innovation management in geoparks, in the next step, another 

questionnaire (Appendix 2) was designed to investigate the network analysis in geoparks. 

Regarding this, the questionnaire was mailed to all geoparks around the world in 2010; 

data collection was conducted from October to December. This questionnaire has two 

major purposes: 1) to determine the collaboration areas in the GGN and EGN as two  

social scientific networks, and 2) to measure the degree of collaboration and cooperation 

among geoparks as geotourism destinations. 

The number of geoparks registered in GGN was 66 until October 2010.  According to the 

9th European Geoparks Network conference in Lesvos Island (Greece) the number of 

geoparks increased to 77 in 24 countries.   

Since data for this part of study was collected over three months (from October to Decem-

ber 2010), it is obvious that the former geoparks had no collaboration with the 11 new 

geoparks for these 3 months. Thus we exclude the new geoparks (n=11) from the popula-

tion (N=77), including, however, an aspiring geopark located in China (Hong Kong). This 

exception is justified due to the existing collaboration between this geopark and Itoigawa 

Geopark in Japan, and Yandangshan Geopark in China. Therefore, we end up with 67 

geoparks (Figure 3). Nineteen questionnaire responses were received (28%). The majority 

of responses were collected in Europe (68%), and the others were from China, Australia, 

Iran, Malaysia, and Japan (Table 3.6).

(2010) 

 

In this part, a social network analysis technique also was used to examine the relationship 

between members of GGN. Analysis of the coded data file was made using the network 

relationship program (Pajek). According to Hu and Racherla (2008), actors or nodes can 

be persons, organizations, or groups, or any other set of related entities. In this research, 

those geoparks registered in GGN are nodes, and relations between actors are depicted 

as links between the corresponding nodes.  

Regarding analysis of data in Pajek for numbers of N geoparks, a coded matrix (N× N) 

was created in Microsoft Excel, in which the value of 1 indicates collaboration and the 

value of 0 points to no relationship, and the coded matrix was then imported to a text

document and the file was imported to Pajek software. Finally, the Pajek program pro-

duced a picture of the social relationship network between the interviewed geoparks.  

Pajek software was used to visualise the network, and the collaboration situation of each 

geopark was derived from the numbers of links.  

In addition, the usage of quantitative network parameters is applied to measure the  

degree of collaboration and cooperation among geoparks as geotourism destinations.   

Besides the coded matrix, another matrix was designed to illustrate the fields of collabora-

tion between geoparks. In this matrix symbols are used to indicate the collaboration areas.  

 

3.5.2.  Selection of the Local Data 

As mentioned in the literature review, some authors (Smith, 1989a; Smith, 1989b; 

McKean, 1989; Mansperger, 1995; Brunt and Courtney, 1999; Duxbury et al., 2007; Eraqi, 

2007) demonstrated that tourism has consequences for residents, sometimes good and 

sometimes bad.  

Nowadays geoparks as a new model of sustainable development and protection of nature 

strive to minimize the negative impacts of tourism. Moreover, according to several authors 

(Xun and Milly,2002; Xun and Ting, 2003; Zouros, 2004; Nowlan et al., 2004; Turner, 

2006; Rodriguse and Carvalho, 2009; Eckhardt, 2009; McKeever et al., 2010) geotourism 

as a new economic growth point and new branch of sustainable tourism can improve the  

expense of geo-heritage preservation, increase local revenues and enhance employment 

in geopark territories.  

Interviews at the local level allow us to reveal the significant and tangible effects of the 

establishment of a geopark for the local development.  Regarding this, Qeshm Geopark 

was selected as a case study, and the local communities living in the surrounding villages 

of geopark were interviewed. Respondents as host communities indicated their preference 

for tourism expansion and pointed out the role of creation of Qeshm Geopark on the 

minimization of negative sociocultural and socio-environmental impacts of tourism in their 

territory. In addition, they draw attention to the role of establishment of Qeshm Geopark 

for development of the local economy.  

The aim of this part of the study is to identify policies and new strategies (innovation) pur-

sued by the local government of Qeshm Geopark in achieving the goals of local develop-

ment. For this purpose, questionnaires with random samples were administered in this 

step. Interviews in face-to-face format at the local level were conducted from July to  



Chapter 3 -Methodology of Empirical Study 

112 

August 2009, and different ways of data gathering were used; regarding this, we travelled 

to villages located near the geopark, geosites, handicrafts workrooms, rental houses, and 

museums; we also distributed 29% of questionnaires in the summer festival annually held 

in Qeshm.   

Residents of Qeshm Geopark were interviewed regarding (the affect or the role of) tourism 

on their community and geopark. According to the Statistical Centre of Iran (2006) the 

total population of the Qeshm Geopark area is about 17355 people who live in 19 villages. 

In this study locals more than 20 years old were interviewed and finally 720 (8%) ques-

tionnaires were collected (Table 3.7).

In the designed questionnaires (Figure 3.8 and Appendix 3) questions 1 to 3 evaluate 

economic problems such as unemployment which the local communities face, questions 4 

and 5 ask the local communities to express their opinion on the development of tourism 

and geotourism –as a branch of sustainable tourism– in their territory. Furthermore, ques-

tions 6 and 7 aim at evaluating the negative social and environmental impacts of tourism 

on the local communities of Qeshm Geopark. Question 8 inquires into the role played by 

local government in the preservation of natural heritage. Besides this, questions 9 and 10 

seek to ascertain public awareness of the local communities about geoparks and their 

activities.  

Question 11 to 13 include an evolution of environmental, sociocultural and socioeconomic 

impacts of geopark establishment on local communities. Question 13 and 14 were  

designed to give a more detailed description of socioeconomic impacts. For instance 

these questions reveal the job opportunities and the rural income generation from local 

involvement in Qeshm Geopark activities.

The data (closed questions in questionnaires) was analysed using a statistical survey 

through SPSS tools. In this phase, descriptive statistics are used to describe the basic 

features of the collection of data quantitatively. They provide simple summaries about the 

samples. Additionally, two sub–hypotheses were designed to investigate the role played 

by geoparks in employment of the local communities in rural areas, and the third sub–

hypothesis examines whether the opinion of the local men about the negative social  

impacts of tourism is the same as the local women of Qeshm Geopark or not (Table 3.8)?

It is worth mentioning that, for the purpose of testing sub-hypotheses different statistical 

tests were used. For example, a one-sample t-test was used to test the first  

sub-hypothesis.  A one-sample t-test is a statistical procedure that is applied to know the 

mean difference between the sample and the known mean value of the population.  

In this sub-hypothesis we want to calculate the mean difference between the monthly 

salary of the local communities who are involved in Qeshm Geopark activities and the  

National Minimum Wage rate per month in Iran.  

The second sub-hypothesis was tested by an independent samples t-test procedure. The 

independent samples (or two-sample) t-test is used to compare the means of two  

independent groups. In the above mentioned sub-hypothesis the mean revenue of local 

men–from engagement in geopark activities in the form of part time, second or seasonal 

jobs –was compared with the mean revenue of local women.  

Pearson's Chi-square test, which is the best-known of several chi-square tests, was  

applied to test the third sub-hypothesis. This Chi-square test enables us to compare  

observed and expected frequencies objectively. 

Sub- Hypotheses

H7: Geoparks contribute to employment of local communities in rural areas and 
geopark territories  

HNull= Salary of local communities who are involved in geopark activities is equivalent to National 

Minimum Wage (NMW) rate (per month):  M1=207 euro 

First sub-hypothesis for H7: Salary of local communities who are involved in geopark activities is 

not equivalent to National Minimum Wage (NMW) rate (per month):  M1?207 euro 

H7: Geoparks contribute towards increasing geological knowledge and employment of local 
communities in rural areas and geopark territories 

HNull= Men and women earn equal revenue from geopark activities: M Men = M Women 

Second sub-hypothesis for H7: Men earn more revenue from geopark activities: M Men ? M Women 

H8: Geoparks contribute to minimizing the negative socio- cultural impacts of tourism 

perceived by the local communities  

First sub-hypothesis for H8: The men more than the women, who live in the surrounding villages 

of Qeshm Geopark, think that tourism has a negative social impact on their community

Irrespective of quantitative analysis, the SWOT analysis method is used to determine the 

potentials and weaknesses of the Qeshm Geopark.  

The SWOT analysis method, with experiences gained from different geoparks, and the 

results of descriptive analysis, helped us to design three SWOT matrices for the natural 

(geo and bio) and cultural heritage of the Qeshm Geopark. These matrices recommend 

new strategies which reduce the negative impacts of tourism in the Qeshm territory. Fig-

ure 3.9 illustrates the systematic steps for phase three.

3.6.  Summary and Conclusions 

The topic of this thesis is interdisciplinary; therefore the academic readings drew primarily 

on concepts developed within the disciplines of sociology, human geography, tourism and 

natural sciences (geology and ecology). It is noteworthy that, quantitative research  

methods were originally developed in the natural sciences to study natural phenomena.

Identification policies and new strategies (innovation) pursued by the local government of Qeshm 
Geopark in achieving goals of rural development 



Chapter 3 -Methodology of Empirical Study 

117 

However examples of quantitative and qualitative methods are now well accepted in the 

social sciences and leisure and tourism research. Therefore, the combined method (quan-

titative and qualitative) was used in this thesis.  

The major objective of this study is to investigate how geoparks and geotourism can con-

tribute in sustainable tourism. 

In order to highlight the role of geoparks in rural development and achieve the abovemen-

tioned objective, both primary and secondary research was used. In other words, the ba-

sic method is comparison of different geoparks registered in the UNESCO Global 

Geoparks Network, to ascertain policies and new strategies (innovation) pursued by the 

local governments of geoparks in achieving the goals of sustainable tourism for rural de-

velopment. 

Regarding this, three questionnaires were designed: the first and second were filled in by 

authorities of geoparks and the third one was filled in by local communities of the case 

study (locals who live in the surrounding villages of the Qeshm Geopark).  

According to the literature review the thesis topic is new and geoparks and geotourism are 

a new subject recently; so geopark activities have not been studied thoroughly yet. Hence 

sending electronic questionnaires to geoparks around the world can help us to collect 

more information about geopark activities and innovative strategies.  

Moreover, interviews with the local communities of Qeshm Geopark territory create an 

opportunity to investigate thoroughly the effect of the establishment of a geopark and  

development of geotourism on minimization of negative impacts of tourism in rural areas.  

The local and international data was analysed using SPSS tools, NVivo, and Pajek  

software. 

After discussing and justifying the methodological choices for this research, the next two 

chapters present the results of the empirical studies. 



 

 

 

 

 

CHAPTER 4- Sustainable Tourism in 
UNESCO Global Geoparks Network  

 
Part 1- Geographical Areas where the 

Empirical Study was conducted 



Chapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted 

119 

4.1.1.  Introduction 

Chapter 4, part 1 explains how geoparks attain their targets. It begins with a glimpse into 

the characterisation of geoparks, where the empirical study is conducted. This part also 

covers the geographical characterizations, innovative strategies, and main activities of the 

geoparks that replied to questionnaires. 

  

4.1. 2.  Characterization of the Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted 

As mentioned in chapter 3, two questionnaires were sent to all geoparks around the world. 

Firstly, twenty-five questionnaire forms were collected after having been filled in by the 

chosen respondents. The majority of responses were from Europe (80%) and the others 

from Australia, Iran, Malaysia, Japan, and Brazil. This questionnaire evaluated the role of 

geoparks in socioeconomic, socio-environmental and sociocultural sustainability. The 

empirical study was conducted from March 2009 to January 2010. 

The second questionnaire, which investigated the area of collaboration between geoparks, 

was conducted from October to November 2010. In this phase nineteen geoparks replied 

to the second questionnaire. Once again the majority of responses were from Europe (13 

geoparks from 10 countries – France, Portugal, Germany, Greece, Spain, Norway, North 

Ireland, UK, Romania, and Croatia – and the others from Australia, Iran, Malaysia, China, 

and Japan.     

This part takes a look at the geoparks where the empirical study was carried out. The 

information of this part was gathered from a literature review, and the questionnaire filled 

in by geopark authorities.   

 

4.1. 2.1.  Réserve Géologique de Haute-Provence (France)   

Réserve Géologique de Haute-Provence (RGHP) geopark is located in the southeast of 

France and covers 2100 km2 from Montagne de Chine to the Gorges of Verdon River. The 

main activities are centred on agriculture (sheep-raising, in particular, plays an important 

part in landscape conservation) and tourism. The tourism focuses on leisure, nature, and 

culture. Moreover, the mineral springs and spa play an important role in Digne-les-Bains 

tourist attractions. These two pillars (agriculture and tourism) also support services and 

crafts; but there is no industry in the territory. 



Chapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted 

120 

Visitors can experience 300 million years of the earth’s history in this geopark. Fossils, 

tectonic and sedimentary outcrops are geological heritage sites in this area (Unjah, 2008). 

It is notable that France was a member of the 4 countries which announced the geopark 

term as an innovation to improve socioeconomic activities of locals, conservation of geo-

heritage, and popularization of the geosciences. Regarding this, the geopark team 

believes that the approach to sustainable management can be directed into two paths: 

network and initiative. Hence, managers of the geopark try to develop them by 

establishing a good partnership with business entities, libraries, student facilities, farms, 

camping and caravanning sites, hotels, hostels, restaurants, bars, tourism offices, and 

nature tour guides. Nature guides are a group of professional local guides that have the 

ability to describe the rich geological heritage of the area in addition to other heritage.  

Their vigorously conducted tours range from school children, families, group, associations, 

club, and enterprises to individuals who are interested in the geological heritage. In order 

to maintain the standard of scientific information and quality of guides, all guides are 

encouraged to take the course with the Réserve. Recently, 23 active nature guides have 

joined the Réserve Network. The guides and their partners, through an awareness 

program, have attracted much more tourist attention to this area.  

Several initiatives created by their partners, such as creating geo-products (ammonite 

chocolate, ammonite bread, and pastries, are among the attractions in Digne les Bains). 

Geotourism guide is another innovative activity in this territory (Unjah, 2008).   

At present, the RGHP geopark is supported by the Ministry of Environment and the local 

municipality.  

 

4.1. 2.2.  Naturtejo Geopark (Portugal) 

Geopark Naturtejo was the first Portuguese geopark integrated into the European and 

Global Geopark Networks. It was registered in the Global Geopark Network (GGN) in 

2006. Geopark Naturtejo is a vast territory, 4616 km2, covering 6 municipalities (Castelo 

Branco, Idanha-a-Nova, Oleiros, Proença-a-Nova, Nisa and Vila Velha de Ródão) which, 

to a great degree, financially support it. 

According to Carvalho and Rodrigues (2010a) the Naturtejo Geopark comprises more 

than 170 geosites identified in the Naturtejo Geopark Geosites Inventory; 1 Natural 

Monument (Portas de Ródão); 2 Thermal Springs (Monfortinho and Fadagosa de Nisa), 3 

Natura 2000 Sites (Serra da Gardunha, Nisa/Laje de Prata and S. Mamede), 



Chapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted 

121 

internationally recognized important Bird Areas, 1 Natural Park (Tejo Internacional), 5 

Schist Villages (Figueira, Álvaro, Martim Branco, Foz do Cobrão and Sarzedas), 2 

Historical Villages (Monsanto and Idanha-a-Velha), several fortified villages (such as 

Penha Garcia, Salvaterra do Extremo, Segura, Montalvão, Rosmaninhal, Nisa or Amieira 

do Tejo), more than 30 local to national-importance protected monuments, and several 

geosites already classified as municipal interest. 

The geomorphological, geological, paleontological and mining heritage sites are 

monuments with regional and international geological significance in this area. An 

example is the wonderful exposure of trilobite trace fossils in the Penha Garcia 

Ichnological Park. Visitors, going to the fossils trail, will directly look at past time windows 

opening on the sea bottom of 480 million years ago (Carvalho and Martin, 2007). Portas 

do Ródão and Vale Mourão gorges, the Roman gold mine of Conhal do Arneiro, and the 

granite morphologies from Serra da Gardunha and Monsanto are the other geological 

trails in this geopark. There are also granite outcrops such as the inselberg archipelago 

and demi-horst with outstanding landforms. 

The geopark is a partnership of municipalities and the local entrepreneurs for developing 

innovative strategies for sustainable development. Geopark officials play a vital role in 

consulting with locals and suggesting innovative ideas to them with the goal of economy 

improvement in geopark territory. Naturtejo Geopark cooperates with private sectors such 

as natural spa health centres, foreign and domestic outdoor companies, NGOs (Non-

Governmental Organization), hotels, restaurants, and family guest houses.  

An educational program in schools and universities is the next initiative in the geopark. 

Naturtejo Geopark started an educational program in 2007 and at the end of 2009 

succeeded in educating 3813 students and teachers (Catana and Rocha, 2009). In this 

program age ranges are from 4 to 10 years; this program embraces two educational 

activities including: “School Meets the Geopark” and “Geopark Goes to School”. The 

geopark employed local geologists as teachers, regarding the fact that no one knows the 

geopark territory better than locals.  

Apart from educational programs, geopark officials attempt to improve socioeconomic 

activities of the local communities by geotourism and new job opportunities such as the 

establishment of a geo-bakery, geo-restaurant, geo-museum, and family guest house and 

organization of geo-sports and geotours. 

Establishment of a geo-restaurant and geo-bakery in Naturtejo Geopark is not only 

inspired by the landscape but also revived the past civilizations and ancient traditions.  



Chapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted 

122 

The geo-bakery1 is managed by a geologist couple. Geology stimulates the couple’s 

participation in management, for instance they make trilobite and granulite cookies in the 

geo-bakery, and serve them on tours and at conferences as geo-products. Moreover, they 

have close collaboration with authorities of Naturtejo Geopark and they use the brand of 

geopark for their geo-products. Besides this, the geo-bakery has designed a geo-menu 

and serves geo-food. Each pizza in this restaurant has a geographic name, for example 

Nazca Pizza (an example of a tectonic earth plate). Aside from tectonic pizza, the geo-

bakery make Orogenic Toasts (Cadomian, Variscan and Alpine, representing the major 

mountain belt events from Naturtejo Geopark) (Geraldes and Ferreira, 2009) (Appendix 

4).  

Casa do Forno is not just a geo-bakery alone; it is a family guest house as well. It is 

noteworthy that every room has a geologic name and is decorated with geological 

landscape pictures. Additionally, in the corridors and yards the visitors can see the 

collection of stones and local handicrafts.   

The establishment of a geo-restaurant2 is another innovation of the geopark. Petiscos e 

Granitos restaurant is located in Monsanto village. The restaurant “Petiscos e Granitos” 

offers various traditional dishes from the region with a special architecture feature: granite. 

Petiscos e Granitos is the first geological restaurant with traditional architecture using big 

granite stones weighing thousands of tons as walls and ceiling. This single area 

celebrates the “kitchen of the Earth” with a geo-menu. This restaurant is a new concept in 

catering, and an educational strategy that promotes the geological Portuguese heritage. 

Serving Boulder soup or Marble cake in the Petiscos e Granitos geo-restaurant constitutes 

other good examples for making geoproducts. Petiscos &amp;amp; Granitos is the first geological 

restaurant which is located in the Naturtejo Geopark territory. The food is served among 

boulders of granite caves (the geological architecture of the restaurant) (Appendix 5) 

(Rodrigues, 2009). 

Furthermore, Carlos Santos, a businessman from Idanha-a-Nova has inaugurated the 

second geo-restaurant in Naturtejo Geopark. The Carlos Santos Sabores da Terra (Earth 

Flavours) geo-restaurant serves traditional recipes combined with local products such as 

local mushrooms, cheese and olive oil. In addition, geo-food such as Cantchais Lamb 

(Cantchais is the local name for granite boulders) is served in this geo-restaurant. The

123 

menu of this geo-restaurant is related to local geological landscapes (Naturtejo Geopark 

Authorities, 2010a).  

The last but not the least innovation in the geopark territory, is the establishment of a 

family guest house which improves the economy of the local communities, especially 

retired people who are alone. There are some family guest houses in Geopark Naturtejo 

territory. S. Torcato-Moradal guest house3 is a famous one which used schist (The Stone 

in the area) in its walls and its logo refers to its architecture. This house is managed by a 

local old couple; they serve traditional food and manage tours for tourists. This family 

guest house opened in 2006 and it has 4 rooms. By the end of 2009 this guest house had 

served 500 tourists (Appendix 6). 

 

4.1. 2.3. Arouca Geopark (Portugal)  

Arouca Geopark was the second Portuguese geopark integrated into the European and 

Global Geopark Networks in 2009. The area of the geopark is around 328 km2 and 

corresponds exactly to the administrative borders of the Arouca municipality with about 

25000 inhabitants (Abreu SÁ, 2009).  

There are 41 geosites in Arouca Geopark and the geopark is known for its outstanding 

geological heritage of international significance, with particular emphasis on the largest 

trilobite fossils (Abreu SÁ et al., 2009).  

Arouca is officially managed and financially supported by the municipality. Arouca 

Geopark cooperates with universities, hotels, museums, restaurants, bungalows, and rural 

hotels. In addition to geological heritage, there are natural, architectural, cultural, and 

historical heritage sites in the geopark. The cultural heritage of Arouca goes back to the 

prehistoric times. In this territory, there is mining heritage remaining from the Romans.   

Geopark officials play a vital role in the educational program; at the end of 2009, they had 

succeeded in educating 3956 local pupils and 331 local teachers (Catana and Rocha, 

2009). Likewise, the geopark runs an educational project called “Geoteca”; this project, 

was initially developed by the school libraries and the main goal of the project was to 

improve the knowledge of students and teachers about Arouca Geopark (Rocha et al., 

2009). In this regard, the geopark held an innovative workshop titled “Make your own

124 

Trilobite”; this workshop reinforced the knowledge of the students about trilobite and 

geopark activities; the children painted the trilobites and dressed up as trilobites, and raft 

boats in Carnival 2009 (Appendix 7).   

Furthermore, the Arouca Geopark was already well known for its nature sports activities 

such as rafting, cycling, climbing, and hiking.   

The Centre for Geological Interpretation of Canelas4 is an innovative local business in 

Arouca Geopark. This private fossil museum was built by the company Ardósias Valério 

and Figueiredo, Lda with financial support of the LEADER program. The fossil museum 

opened to the public on 1st July 2006, and it offers tours of the interior of rocks formed on 

the sea about 500 million years ago, watching the enigmatic creatures that inhabited it, 

which include some of the largest and rarest trilobites of the world (Appendix 8). It is 

noteworthy that the fossil museum was a factory in the past, but when the Arouca 

Geopark established, it became part of the geopark geo-trail, and now it has a close 

collaboration with geopark. The fossil museum generates income through selling tickets 

and holding educational programs for schools. By August 2009, more than 27000 visitors 

visited this site. Indeed, this centre is a private museum and educational centre.  

The museum has cooperation with local artists; regarding this, they sell and exhibit local 

handicrafts in their museum. Decorative geo-products based on geological elements such 

as trilobite clocks, trilobite glasses, trilobite lamp covers, etc. are good examples of geo-

products (Appendix 9).   

The last but not the least innovation in Arouca Geopark is creation of geo-products. 

Pedras Parideiras (Appendix 10) is a geo-product in Arouca Geopark. Pedras Parideiras 

are cookies which have the shape of biotite nodules from local granites. Visitors can find 

these cookies in one of the famous cake shops of Arouca (casa do pão de ló de Arouca). 

Pedras Parideiras is a symbol of the Castanheira Nodular Granite, with a phenomenon 

popularly known as Pedras Parideiras (rocks that give birth).   

 

4.1. 2.4.  Vulkaneifel Geopark (Germany) 

Vulkaneifel Geopark with 1250 km2 area is located in the Eifel, Rhenania-Palatinate 

region. This geopark has a fascinating landscape which provides an insight into more than 

350 million years of history including the youngest volcanic activity in Germany. Volcanoes

are conspicuous; 350 eruption centres have been known up to now, from which this 

landscape received its dominant morphological shaping and the name Vulkaneifel 

(Schueller and Bauer, 2004).   

This geopark was registered in the European Geoparks Network in 2000 and became a 

member of the Global Geoparks Networks in 2004. The local government and private 

administration manage the geopark and 7 municipalities and the business development 

agency of county Vulkaneifel financially support it. The geopark cooperates with some 

other organizations such as: Eifel tourism GmbH, Tourism agencies at municipalities, and 

regional forest administration.  

Vulkaneifel Geopark became economically famous for its mineral water resources. Today, 

many volcanologists and geologists as well as environmental scientists and biologists do 

research here because of the large open pits which give a new dimension to looking into 

volcanological processes and in finding perspectives for sustainable developments ideas.  

Vulcaneifel Geopark currently comprises a network of 12 geo-units. Four of them are 

museums like the Vulcan-museum Daun, the Maar-museum Manderscheid, the Iron-

museum Juenkerath, and the Natural-history Museum of Gerolstein.  

The park includes three existing geo-trails: Geo-Pfad Hillesheim, Geo-Route 

Manderscheid, and Geopark Gerolstein, each with marked geological outcrops and 

locations on routes around small towns with a large amount of geological information on 

interpretation panels. There is a pool of outdoor information which enables groups to do 

tours on their own (EGN, 2005). 

In addition, the Eifel region is a natural area with a unique character, known as an 

attractive landscape and region of origin as high-quality products with the new regional 

brand “e” which can be recognized directly by consumers for the special quality of the 

Eifel.  

Its symbol is the brand logo with a yellow “e”; this brand is a multipurpose brand and is 

used for agriculture, forestry, trade, tourism activities, and the local products. Moreover, 

geo-products such as Vulkaneifel mineral water cocktails are innovations for promoting 

regional and local products in this geopark.

4.1. 2.5.  Geo and Naturepark TERRA.vita (Germany)  

TERRA vita geopark is located in North-Western Germany in the transitional zone 

between the northern German lowlands and the north-western hill country, about 100 

kilometres from the North Sea coast and some 35 km east of the Dutch border. With an 

area of 1220 km2, the Nature Park is one of the cross-border Parks of the Federal 

Republic of Germany (GGN, 2008a).  

This park with an area of 901km2 is located in Lower Saxony, in the district of Osnabrueck. 

The rest of the territory, 319 km2, is located in North-Rhine Westfalia in the districts of 

Minden-Luebbecke, Herford, Guetersloh, and the city of Bielefeld.  

70% of the Natural Park is covered with forest; the other 30% is mostly used for 

agriculture activities (GGN, 2008a). TERRA vita was registered in EGN in 2001, and it is 

the government and private administration who manage the geopark, but 45 local 

municipalities financially support it. The geopark cooperates with organizations such as: 

the tourism sector, schools, environmental foundations, and diverse institutions of 

environmental education.  

TERRA vita geopark is the documentation of the earth's history from the carboniferous 

age about 300 million years ago up to today, nearly without gaps, in a narrow area in this 

region. One example for an impressive opening in carboniferous rock is the quartzite-

quarry of the "Piesberg" north of Osnabruck, housing an industrial-historical museum with 

an accessible black coal pit from the 19th century.  

The dinosaur footprints of Barkhausen in the "Wiehengebirge" left by altogether eleven 

dinosaurs of two different species appear in the upper Jurassic age and are unique in 

Europe. The footprint quarry is the most important geo-site of the nature park (Appendix 

11).  

The Rocks of Dorenthe, which are an outcrop of lower cretaceous sandstone, are another 

geopark geosite; this geosite is a tourist attraction in the western part of the Nature-park. 

The "Sea of Rocks" on the "Gattberg", including the huge erratic block gives a sense of 

the enormous power of the glaciers that once moved through the Nature-park area. 

TERRA vita geopark has an exhibition and facility of two hectares, where visitors are 

given a geological overall view by the Nature-park team and where educational programs 

for schools are offered. It is a popular excursion destination for scientists from all over 

Germany and the Netherlands. A current registration of geotopes completes the scientific 

list of existing geological objects. The main target of the geopark activities is further

protection measures for geotopes together with enlarged public relation activities, allowing 

visitors and also inhabitants a better understanding of the connections of earth history in 

different ways. The 1999 extension and development of the Geosite "Dinosaur Footprints" 

into an open air museum, was an important step in this direction.  

Touristic offers like thematic bicycle routes, action tours for groups, and thematic maps 

are being worked out by the Nature-park administration. In 2004, a set of 17 cycling-routes 

called "TERRA. Trails" was published and a printed guide map for each route provides 

public information for visitors.   

 

4.1. 2. 6. Geopark Harz . Braunschweiger Land Ostfalen (Germany)  

Harz Braunschweiger Land Ostfalen is located in Northern Germany and encloses the 

Harz Mountains and the northern situated "Braunschweiger Land" up to the Flechtingen 

Ridge. This geopark was registered in EGN in 2002. The whole geopark area is about 

10000 km2 and it contains 18 districts in three German federal states. Due to the very 

large area, the geopark is managed by a committee of two associations (George and 

Zellmer, 2002): 

- The “Regional verb and Harz" in Quedlinburg is an organisation essentially formed 

by the rural districts of the Harz Mountains.  

- The registered society called "Femo" (a part of “Braunschweiger Land / Ostfalen). 

The geopark is under the supervision of government and private administration; it is  

financially supported by the local municipalities and environment department.  

The Harz Mountains are composed of Palaeozoic sediments and magmatic rocks. They 

have been extensively documented over the past 1,000 years in historical accounts of 

mining and research in the area. And the Harz Mountains are characterized by a 

geographically small-scale occurrence of sedimentary rocks (sandstone, slate, chert, 

greywacke, and reef limestone) as well as igneous rocks (meta-basalts, keratophyre, and 

tuffites) (George and Zellmer, 2002). 

‘The Classic Square Mile of Geology’ is the theme of geopark Harz. Sedimentary, volcanic 

and plutonic rocks as well as a complete sequence of Mesozoic sedimentary rocks, which 

are packed with fossils, can be viewed in this small area (Appendix 12). The above 

mentioned name was given to a small area near Goslar town which is visited by 

professors and students from Germany and all over Europe (George and Zellmer, 2009).  



Chapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted 

128 

In this area visitors can experience geopark attractions either independently or under the 

guidance of trained personnel. For this purpose, information booklets and leaflets are 

available, for example the "Landmarks", which give an overview of the geology of the Harz 

region. In cooperation with museums and schools, special educational activities are 

continuously being developed.  

In the geopark museum there are graphs to explain the geological events that led to the 

sensational formations at the northern edge of the Harz Mountains. Rocks as well as ores 

and minerals from all eras of the classical square mile are exhibited (EGN, 2009b).  

 

4.1. 2.7. Swabian Alb Geopark (Germany)  

The geopark Swabian Alb which is situated in southwest Germany was registered in EGN 

in 2001. The geological structure of this region was shaped by the uplifting of the 

mountains of the Black Forest. Consequently, the Mesozoic sediments to the east of these 

mountains dip towards the southeast and the Triassic and the Jurassic rocks from 

escarpments are directed to the northwest. Swabian Alb Geopark is sparsely populated 

and is still a rural area. The Alb is a karst topography area and for this reason has the 

highest density of caves in Germany, with many of caves open to the public. Important 

wells are also attractive karst features. Volcanic activities during the Tertiary left traces as 

Maars or cones of eroded vents and a thermal limestone travertine including plant and 

animal fossils exit in this area (Heizmann, 2009).  

Due to its rich geological heritage the Swabian Alb is a traditional geotouristic destination 

with a high density of different attractions like 15 show caves, several museums, 

interpretive trails and sites to fossick, etc. Guided landscape adventure tours by trained 

rangers are offered in different parts of the Alb. Moreover, the hot waters, rich in minerals, 

which well up from the depths of the earth provide a source of health which can be 

enjoyed in the pleasant resorts; spas and mineral baths of the region are another tourist 

attraction in this region.   

The geopark is organisationally incorporated into the Swabian Alb Tourist Board. It is a 

cooperation platform for different institutions such as ministries, universities, associations, 

and authorities, involved in geosciences, tourism, and nature conservation. The geopark is 

under the supervision of the government; the local municipalities and tourism sector 

financially support the geopark. Their aim is to develop the geopark as a strong contributor 

to the sustainable development of the Swabian Alb.

4.1. 2.8.  Psiloritis Natural Park (Greece)  

Psiioritis Natural Park is located on the Greek Island of Crete, in the southern Aegean 

Sea. It has an area of 1200 Km2, with 157 settlements and towns and a population of 

about 42234 inhabitants.  

It is the government and private administration who manage the geopark and 11 local 

municipalities financially support it. Moreover the geopark cooperates with other 

organizations such as Natural History Museum, university of Crete, AKOMM Psiloritis 

(Development Tourism Agency), local development S.A, Anogia Environmental Education 

Center, Ministry of Education and   Psiloritis Land Network.   

Aside from management structure, Psiloritis geopark is known because of its big faults 

with excellent and imposing fault surfaces, fossil sites (such as the Permian corals), 

caves, impressive gorges, and plateaus that host many native species of the island, and 

unique fold associations. Geomorphologic structures have sustained the culture, tradition 

and customs of the inhabitants for thousands of years. In the Psiloritis mountains 

mythology, folklore, tradition, and natural environment meet together (Fassoulas et al., 

2009).   

Moreover, many herbs and endemic plant and animal species flourish in this territory. 

These include the aromatic (such as Origanum dictamnus) and rare plants and 

endangered animals (such as vultures: Gypaetus barbatus and wild cats: Felis silvestris 

creticus) (Fassoulas et al., 2009).    

Consequently, in this geopark, visitors have an extensive choice of activities ranging from 

geo-sports, like swimming, hiking, mountain biking, and rock climbing to getting 

acquainted with the breathtaking science of geology, to observe birds, animals and plants, 

and to savour the traditional Cretan cuisine. Geo-products such as decorative or utilitarian 

ornaments, commemorative goods from stone or wood, furniture, children's toys and 

clothes which are symbols of geopark other initiatives in this geopark (Skoula and 

Fassoulas, 2006). 

 

4.1. 2.9.  Sobrarbe Geopark (Spain)  

Sobrarbe Geopark with a surface area of 2200 km2 (Poch, 2009) was registered in GGN in 

2006 and became a member of UNESCO Global Geopark Network. The geopark 

encompasses the entire Sobrarbe, and this area is located in the Alto Aragón region, 

Spain, and is bordered by France along the north. The management structure of the 



Chapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted 

130 

geopark is public administration and the geopark is financially supported by the local 

municipality. Moreover, the geopark cooperates with other organizations such as  

Association of Tourism Enterprises of Sobrarbe, Ordesa and Monte Perdido National 

Park, Natural Park Posets Maladeta, Natural Park Sierra y Cañones de Guara, Research 

Centre of Sobrarbe, Environmental Education organizations, the Tourism Department of 

the Regional Government of Aragon, the Environment Department of the Regional 

Government of Aragon, the Education Department of the Regional Government of Aragon, 

the University of Zaragoza, and University Autónoma de Barcelona.  

Furthermore, old mining activities of metal ores are located in the high Palaeozoic 

Mountains in the northern part of the region, where glacial activities took place during the 

Quaternary (moraine deposits or glacial lakes). Further south, younger rock units from the 

Mesozoic to Paleocene age forms the mountains of the Ordesa and Monte Perdido 

National Park. As a result of the subterranean circulation of water, the region has one of 

the most visited karstic systems of Europe. The southern area comprises Tertiary 

sedimentary rocks from the Eocene to Oligocene age. A large variety of fossils, from 

Nummulite beaches to salt water crocodiles can be found in these rocks. In order to 

guarantee the conservation of this heritage, 50% of the surface area of Sobrarbe has 

been declared a protected area.  

In addition, the geopark authorities, in order to promote geotourism and education, rebuilt 

an ancient castle and  provided three new facilities, such as  the Sobrarbe Geopark visitor 

centre “Space of the Sobrarbe Geopark”, the “Technical Office” and the “Geo-vision 

Room”. Furthermore, five bicycle routes, brochures, interpretative panels and guide-

notebooks are other tourist facilities in this geopark (Poch, 2009).   

 

4.1. 2.10.  Parque Cultural del Maestrazgo (Spain)  

The Maestrazgo Cultural Park with an area of 2700 km2 is situated in the heart of the 

Iberian Mountains and was registered in UNESCO Global Geopark Network in 2004. The 

structure of the geopark is not private and 43 local municipalities and the Cultural 

department of regional government financially support the geopark. Moreover, the 

geopark cooperates with other organizations and companies such as the local council of 

Comarca Cuencas Mineras, Zaragoza University, Dinopolis, and Europe direct CAIRE.  

As for geology, this is an area where Mesozoic materials are predominant, being the 

biggest part of the geological structure (Simon and Abril, 2009). The Maestrazgo geopark 



Chapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted 

131 

is a lovely natural area, as well as an exceptional laboratory for exploring the Mesozoic 

and Tertiary evolution of the Iberian Plate.  

Tertiary materials are in several depressed areas, such as Val de Jarque, valleys of Mas 

de las Matas and Alcorisa, areas of Crivillén, and Upper Guadalopillo; at the same time, 

tertiary materials are present in Sierra de Borden. 

Regarding lithology, strongly carbonated materials such as limestone dolomite rocks and 

marl appear in the higher and middle areas in Maestrazgo.  

The strong folding undergone by Mesozoic levels in central Maestrazgo, as well as 

erosion by a river network, have produced steep areas, where canyons, crests, and 

hillocks are the main image: this produces large geomorphological diversity and 

outstanding landscape beauty.  

Besides, calcareous rocks are favourable for endo-karstic processes; that is why caves 

and chasms are common in Maestrazgo.  

The Mining Interpretation Centre is located in Aliaga. It has created a whole lifestyle that 

continues alive in people, landscape, and facilities. Additionally, fossil richness (such as 

dinosaur fossils and footprints) in Maestrazgo Cultural Park is seen in the paleontological 

park in the village of Galve (Appendix 13).  

Irrespective of geological heritage, there are 13 historical villages labelled as "National 

Monument", castles coming from the Middle Age, and old country houses known as  

"masadas” in this territory.  

The Park can be admired and understood by means of signposts, pathways, guides, 

museums, a complete scientific guidebook for academic people, a short guidebook for 

tourists, pedagogic tools for primary and secondary schools (including field notebooks and 

an interactive CD published in 2004 and widely circulated among teachers), and a comic 

for children. 

 

 4.1. 2.11.   Copper Coast Geopark (Ireland) 

The Copper Coast Global Geopark is located on the South East coast of Ireland, between 

Tramore and Dungarvan in County Waterford. The Copper Coast Geopark with 50 km2 

was registered in EGN in 2001. It is managed officially and the local municipality 

financially supports it. The geopark cooperates with other organizations and companies 

such as Geotourism Survey Instrument (GSI), Fáilte Ireland and Dunhill Ecoparks, 



Chapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted 

132 

Waterford County Council (WCC), University College Cork (UCC), and Copper Coast 

Tourism (CCT).  

With regard to geology, the Copper Coast is an outdoor geology museum with geological 

heritage sites that reflect a variety of environments within which the area has evolved over 

the last 460 million years. Sedimentary and volcanic rocks illustrate the subsequent 

volcanism. Copper was mined extensively in the area during the 19th century. The 

geopark name is derived from this activity (Morris, 2009).   

Beside the geological heritage sites, the geopark provided a range of educational 

services. Provision of signs (road &amp;amp; interpretation), a team of local guides trained by the 

geopark, walking cards and paths, a geological garden, picnic tables, art and craft 

workshops, the encouragement of growth of local businesses, an educational program 

(geology course), and fieldtrips for schools are instructional tools which were offered by 

the geopark to tourists and students (McCarthy and Sweeney, 2008).  

 

4.1. 2.12.   Marble Arch Caves Global Geopark (North Ireland)  

The Marble Arch Caves Geopark is located in County Fermanagh in Northern Ireland; this 

geopark with 180 km2 was registered in the European Geopark Network in 2001 and 

became the first European geopark in the United Kingdom. It is the government which 

manages the geopark and 2 County Councils, Fermanagh District Council and Cavan 

County financially support it. The geopark cooperates with other organizations and 

companies such as the Forest Service (Northern Ireland), the Northern Ireland 

Environment Agency, Colitte (Irish Forest Service), Fermanagh Lakeland Tourism, and 

Cavan Tourism.   

Concerning geography, Marble Arch Caves are one of the most significant caves in Britain 

and Ireland (Appendix 14). These caves were first explored in 1895 and were developed 

as a tourist cave in 1985 and they are now world famous as one of Ireland’s leading tourist 

attractions.   

The geopark offers a wide range of environmental education and field studies to schools, 

universities, and adult groups. Besides, trained tour guides of the caves, a cave tour book, 

hill walking, and motor-touring routes are the services which are offered to geopark 

tourists (Watson and McKeever, 2009).

4.1. 2.13.   Lochaber Geopark (Scotland)  

Lochaber Geopark, located in the highlands of Scotland, was registered in UNESCO 

Global Geopark Network in 2007. The geopark is under the supervision of private sector 

and the geopark cooperates with other organizations and companies such as Scottish 

Natural Heritage, The Highland Council, Heritage Lottery Fund, Highlands and Island 

Enterprise, LEADER, and outdoor companies.  

Lochaber is famous for its spectacular scenery, which includes Britain’s highest mountain 

and the prominent landmark called An Sgurr on Eigg which is built of a rock called 

pitchstone: at 55 million years old it is the youngest volcanic rock preserved in Scotland.  

Lochaber geopark is unique among its European counterparts because it has a geological 

record that includes not only the creation of a huge mountain chain by the collision of giant 

plates, but also the dramatic volcanic activity associated with the much later tectonic plate 

rifting when Greenland and Europe drifted apart (House et al., 2009).  

Lochaber is also a popular visitor destination. It has good travel links as well as a range of 

accommodation to suit every budget. There is also the opportunity to take part in 

numerous outdoor activities. This makes it an ideal location to discover more about the 

local landscape and enjoy a relaxing break. 

 

4.1. 2.14.  Geopark Shetland (Scotland - UK)  

Shetland is a group of Islands lying 140 km north of the Scottish mainland. The Geopark 

Shetland includes a unique landscape and its rocks are hard and acidic (Swale, 2009).  

The geopark is coordinated by the Geopark Shetland Working Group (GSWG). The lead 

partner is the Shetland Amenity Trust, which employs a full-time Geology Project Officer to 

coordinate the various geological activities and liaise with the European Geoparks 

Network.  

The GSWG includes representatives from several partners including the Shetland Islands 

Council, Scottish Natural Heritage, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, Visit Shetland, the 

Shetland Tourism Association, the Association of Shetland Community Councils and 

various community groups. 

It is noteworthy that the Shetland Geopark is member in thematic networks such as the 

volcanic thematic network and coastal thematic network.  



Chapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted 

134 

Swale (2009) noted that visitors are attracted by the wildlife, particularly the birds, 

archaeology and historical connections and the unique landscape. A recent establishment 

in the geopark has provided a journey through billions of years of fascinating geological 

heritage sites. The geology of Shetland is recognised as a fundamental factor for 

understanding of the islands’ natural and cultural heritage.  

 

4.1. 2.15.  Geological, Mining Park of Sardinia (Italy) 

The Mining geopark covers an area of 3500 km2 and for the rich deposits of lead, zinc, 

copper, tin, silver, and iron it has been acknowledged as one of the most important metal 

districts of Western Europe. Today all that remains of those areas is a rich heritage of 

mining archaeology as part of the Sardinian culture and past life (Manca and Pireddu, 

2003). In 2007, the Sardinia geopark became a member of the European and Global 

Geoparks Network. The geopark is financially supported by the Administration and 

Environment department. Sardinia cooperates with other organizations such as 

universities.   

In addition, the present economy of the geopark reflects the economy of Sardinia which is 

characterized by a weak structure; the sectors of tourism represent a strategy for 

rehabilitating this economy through geotourism. Tourists can visit a historic and 

environmental geo-mineral museum, where they can trace 8000 years of mining history 

(Agus and Atzei, 2009). And a lot enterprise is being done to offer its visitors a new and 

interesting aspect of this wonderful island.  

Porto Flavia, Henry gallery and other numerous tunnels that today have been transformed 

into a museum are unique and particular examples of mining engineering in the past; and 

they have revived the Italian Centre of Coal Culture and Saint Barbara’s Cave.  

The Coal Museum is located in the Great Coal Mine of Serbariu in Carbonia, in the South 

West of Sardinia. The mining site operated from 1937 to 1964 as the most important 

Italian energy resource.  

In early 2000 it was restored with educational and touristic purposes, leading to the 

inauguration of the Coal Museum in November 2006. The Museum tells the story of the 

mining site and of the miners who worked hard there (in the lamp room, the winding 

engine room, the mine shaft, and the underground gallery) (EGN, 2009c).  

Furthermore, the geopark is characterized by an extended stretch of coast and variety of 

interesting landscapes and environment.

 4.1. 2.16.  Parco Naturale Adamello Brenta (Italy)  

The Adamello Brenta Natural Park with 1146.5 km2 is located in the west side of the 

Trento Province in north-eastern Italy. In 2008 it was recognized as an international 

“geopark” inside the European Geoparks Network and the UNESCO Global Geopark 

Network. The geopark is managed officially and Autonomous Province of Trient financially 

supports it. The geopark includes 39 municipalities and has a close cooperation with the 

local tourism sectors, schools, and a group of locals who involved in tourism 

accommodation activities.    

In the west, the protected area encompasses Adamello- Presanella Massif, with its 55 

lakes and several glaciers; among them; the Mandron glacier is the widest glacier in the 

Alps. The eastern area of the park contains the Brenta Group, the western most extension 

of the Dolomites (Ferrari, 2009).  

Beside geological heritage, Adamello Brenta Geopark has diverse ecological heritage, for 

instance the bear and endemic flora. As the bears are endangered species, the geopark 

authorities believe that future of the bears is in fact strongly linked to the development of 

coexistence culture between people and the bears. 

Among geoparks, Parco Naturale Adamello Brenta (Italy) is the first geopark in Europe 

which obtained ISO 14001 certification; the park can also boast EMAS registration 

(Moranduzzo, 2008). 

Concerning geopark activities, geopark officials try to promote the local economy through 

the geopark brand. The Adamello Brenta European Geopark launched a project titled as 

“Qualità Parco”. This project uses the logo as a local environmental/marketing certification 

for hotels and local products. Moreover, the brand is used for agro-alimentary products as 

well (Ilaria, 2011). By the end of 2009, the geopark brand was used for the "Qualità Parco" 

hotels and 35 hotels have been certified out of a total of 335 hotels which are located in 

protected area. Moreover, the local tourism boards and other companies are allowed to 

use the geopark brand for their brochures and leaflets when they carry out projects in 

cooperation or partnership with the park.  

Furthermore, the geopark becomes an ideal place for educational activities; it is also a 

well-suited place to spend a relaxing and healthy holiday and to practise outdoor sport 

activities.   

The geopark also offers sports based on earth topography such as skiing, rock climbing, 

and geo-biking (Appendix 15).  



Chapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted 

136 

An online shop on the geopark website is another tourist facility; the online shop offers 

geopark T-shirts, geopark posters, hats, umbrellas, rucksacks, soft toys, canvas bags, 

gadgets, geopark DVDs and geopark publications to tourists.  

It is worth mentioning that Museum della Malga, ancient shepherd’s huts, and other 

buildings that maintain the characteristics of the traditional architecture are testimony to 

the Alpine culture in this geopark.   

 

  4.1. 2.17.  Nature Park Eisenwurzen (Austria)  

The Nature Park Eisenwurzen is located in the Austrian province of Styria. It is under the 

supervision of government and private sector and 7 municipalities and environment 

department financially support it. Moreover, Eisenwurzen geopark cooperates with other 

organizations and companies such as 12 Nature Park Partners, 13 Nature Park Speciality 

Partners, 7 Nature Parks of Styria, 17 GeoLine Partners, the Museum of Natural History, 

Vienna, Landes museum Joanneum, Graz, Wasserleitungsmuseum Wildalpen; Geology 

exhibition of the National Park Gesäuse, Collections of the monastery Stift Admont, 

Geological Survey of Austria, Universities of Vienna and Graz, Mining University of 

Leoben, Academy of Tourism, Krems; Tourism Agency Alpine Region National Park 

Gesäuse, Tourism Agency of Styria, the local tourism offices of the communities, and is in 

partnership with the tourism agencies of each of the 7 Styrian Nature Parks.  

Geologically, Eisenwurzen is a part of the Northern Calcareous Alps. Its rocks, consisting 

primarily of limestone and dolomite, were deposited over a time interval of 250 million 

years, from the Late Permian to the present (Kollmann and Mitterbäck, 2009). They were 

faulted, folded, and uplifted during Alpine Orogeny. Glaciers of the Great Ice Age and 

rivers provided the unique landscape out of the rocks. Important geosites include the type 

section of the Anisian stage of the Triassic and the Cretaceous / Palaeogene rocks of the 

Gams area.  

Furthermore, geotouristic activities are the domain of GeoLine, the geological branch of 

the Nature Park. These comprise two permanent exhibitions: the museum of the Second 

Vienna Water Supply Line, which benefits from karstic springs in the area, and the Geo-

centre of Gams, which provides an overview of the regional geology. Geo-trails and geo-

biking provide in-situ evidence of geological phenomena: rocks, fossils as well as 

formations reflecting the incredible forces at work during the building of the Alps. 



Chapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted 

137 

The most powerful of all geological agents may be explored in the Water Park of  

St. Gallen and with geo-rafting, which combines science with adventure (Appendix 16). 

Geo-rafting for kids combines sports and the fun of water with explanation of the 

geological features along the river by especially trained raft-guides (Appendix 17). 

A landscape water model in the Water Park of St. Gallen is a place (11 × 9 m) which 

represents the geological approach to water activities. A thunderstorm is triggered by 

pushing a button. The rising of a water table in the mountains can be observed through 

peep-holes and a spring begins to release water from the hill-sides. Streams merge into 

rivers which finally open out into the sea (Kollmann et al., 2009). Tourists and kids feel like 

Gulliver in Lilliput when they visit this landscape model of water erosion in Gallen Park 

(Kollmann and Weiskopf, 2009). This model is an educational instrument where kids 

experience water erosion.  

Besides, the festival of geology which presents the volcanic eruption in the geopark is 

another educational activity.  

In addition, a geo-workshop serves all activities related to the preparation of geological 

items. Fossils found during guided field trips are prepared under supervision and then 

investigated under the microscope. Even ordinary pebbles from the close-by stream 

provide unique souvenirs when they are cut and polished.  

The last but not the least innovative activity is an annual exhibition in the geopark, which 

presents an exhibition of silicified wood from the Petrified Forest of Lesvos and the 

Bohemian Paradise, both members of the European Geoparks Network. Silica dyed by 

iron, copper, or manganese has replaced the wood in silicified tree-trunks. Even after 

millions of years, the characteristic wood structures of conifers, deciduous trees, or ferns 

can be recognized. This is demonstrated by slices of modern wood provided by the 

Austrian Forestry Museum of Großreifling.  

It is noteworthy that the Eisenwurzen geopark strives to involve the local communities and 

volunteers in conservation activities of geopark and create seasonal jobs for them. 

Accordingly, this geopark improves the local economy as well as education in this territory.  

 

4.1. 2.18.  Hateg Country Dinosaurs Geopark (Romania) 

The Hateg Country Dinosaurs Geopark with 1000 km2 in area is located in the central part 

of Romania, in a very fertile region, surrounded by mountains in all directions. This 

geopark registered in GGN in 2005 and became a member of the UNESCO Global 



Chapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted 

138 

Geopark Network. The management structure of geopark is official and the University of 

Bucharest financially supports it. Moreover, the Hateg Country Dinosaurs Geopark 

cooperates with other organizations and companies such as the local administration, 

universities, country administration, and ministry of the environment.  

As for geology, the region is known world-wide for its "dwarf dinosaurs" from the end of 

the Cretaceous, 65 million years ago and this special paleontological heritage has inspired 

the name of the geopark. 

Another geologic event that is well documented in the geopark is the volcanic rock-tuffs, 

lavas, and volcanic bombs marking the volcanic eruptions that took place in the region 

during the dinosaurs’ existence. 

Furthermore, the muddy volcanoes are a very rare phenomenon in continental Europe; 

these sites are one of the most visited and photographed landmarks in the Romanian 

geopark.  

Besides, glacial lakes on the top of the mountains, at more than 2000m high, deep 

gorges, caves, alpine forests, meadows, orchards, and crops are the regional hosts of 

human history from the Paleolithic to Roman Antiquity and from the Middle-Ages to the 

Modern time. 

It is notable that the Hateg Country Dinosaurs Geopark plays an active role in the 

economic development of its territory. Activities are financed through the projects and 

contribution of the local mayoralties. 

Regarding this the geopark project aims to offer a general framework for development in 

this region in an attempt to revive the local traditions and to identity a coherent direction 

for economic development. According to this, there are two main axes to be followed: 

- To promote activities and projects in order to help local initiatives, to assure the increase 

of local incomes, and to create structures able to attract investments.  

- To revive and strengthen the local and cultural identity which is very strong and in 

danger of being lost through migration, poverty, external influences, and imports. 

In addition, making geo-products in geopark such as dinosaur bread promotes education 

as well as the local economy.  

The revitalization of the folkloric and handicraft traditions in this region that was mostly 

inhabited in the past by farmers and shepherds represents another task of the geopark. 

The “Hateg Country” is renowned for the specificity of the peasants’ costumes, in only two 



Chapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted 

139 

colors - black and white, for the villagers’ music and dances as well as handicrafts, 

especially woollen tissues and wooden sculptures. 

The well preserved ruins, amphitheatre, and temples of the capital of the Roman province 

of Dacia, medieval fortresses, castles, churches, and monasteries, Dinosaurs valley trail, 

and butterfly discovery trails are geotourism sites of the geopark which were announced 

by UNESCO.  

It is worth mentioning that hiking, mountain biking, rock climbing, and bird watching are 

offered to visitors by the geopark (Andr??anu and Grigorescu, 2008).  

The last but not the least geopark activities are geo-educational programs for secondary 

schools and universities of Romania (Andr??anu, 2009). 

 

4.1. 2.19.  Bohemian Paradise (Czech Republic)    

The Bohemian Paradise with 700 km2 in area is situated nearly one hundred kilometres to 

the northeast of Prague. The geopark, registered in GGN in 2005, became a member of 

the UNESCO Global Geopark Network. It is under the supervision of government and 

private administrations; the geopark is financially supported by the local municipality. 

Moreover, the Bohemian Paradise geopark cooperates with other organizations such as 

environment department and tourism sectors.  

Apart from the management structure in the geopark, there are spectacular landscapes 

built on a foundation of diverse rock types. Volcanic landscapes (including cinder cones 

and columnar jointed lavas) and Rock Cities (such as caves and rock shelters) are 

geotourist attractions in this territory (?ídkošil et al., 2009).  

Geopark authorities offer tourist facilities including ponds, outdoor swimming-pools, tennis 

courts, golf, fitness centres, and skittles, saunas, solaria, squash and volleyball courts. 

Furthermore, the Bohemian Paradise region also offers suitable conditions for winter 

sports such as downhill skiing courses with ski lifts, cross-country tracks, and winter 

stadiums. 

In addition, rafting, diving, boating, fishing, hiking, cycling, climbing, and bird watching are 

other recreation activities in this territory.

 4.1. 2.20.  Gea Norvegica Geopark (Norway) 

Gea Norvegica Geopark became a member of the UNESCO Global Geopark Network 

(GGN) in 2006 and became Scandinavia’s first global geopark. Gea Norvegica Geopark is 

located in the south-eastern part of Norway. The total land area of geopark is 3000 km2. 

The geopark is managed officially and 8 local municipalities and 2 counties financially 

support the geopark. The geopark cooperates with other organisations and companies 

such as tourism offices, the local food producers, schools, accommodations, and 

museums.  

As regards geology, the geopark is located where the old Scandinavian geology meets the 

younger geology of continental Europe. Furthermore, the geopark is an international 

reference area for Carbonatites (limestone volcanism) (Dalhgren, 2009).  

The oldest rocks of Gea Norvegica geopark formed more than 15000 million years ago. 

They were metamorphosed and deformed within the deep crust during the 

Sveconorwegian Orogeny about 1 billion years ago. In this territory there are a large 

variety of rocks which are famous for their minerals.  

Besides this, two spectacular geopark localities (Mølen and Jomfruland) are situated 

along the largest deposits which formed 10,000 years ago.  

Geopark authorities try to achieve three targets of the geopark (education, geotourism, 

and conservation); in this regard, they have designed a site for students and teachers of 

secondary schools (Appendix 18), also, Gea Norvegica Geopark has developed some 

fundamental educational packages to be used in primary and secondary schools. 

Consequently, in March 2007 with the geopark’s collaboration, geology was defined in the 

curriculum of secondary schools (Geo1 and Geo2) (Annual Report, 2007).   

It is noteworthy that the geopark strives to train guides; the geopark guides are important 

ambassadors for natural geological heritage and the local environment of the area. They 

are qualified and experienced communicators with a good knowledge about the geopark 

localities. With the local geology as the starting point, they show the interrelationships 

between the geology and the surrounding nature, historical and social development.  

The geopark guides must complete a training program in order to get their certification as 

"Certified Geopark Guides”. Likewise, geopark officials offer tourist facilities such as 

interpretive panels which are compatible with the landscape.  

  



Chapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted 

141 

4.1. 2.21.  Magma Geopark (Norway) 

Magma Geopark is situated in southwest Norway and extends over 2329 km2. Magma 

Geopark is under the supervision of five municipalities (Bjerkreim, Eigersund, Lund, 

Sokndal and Flekkefjord) which are located in the counties Rogaland and Vest-Agder.  

The landscapes of Magma geopark are unique. The landscape was strongly influenced by 

the Ice Age and many glacial features are well preserved. 

Mining history can be studied at several locations, including Blåfjell (titanium), Gursli 

(molybdenum) and Ørsdalen (tungsten and molybdenum) (Richard Wilson et al., 2008).  

Geology has played an important role in the cultural and industrial development of the 

region. Local mining activity started during the Iron Age when bog-iron deposits were 

exploited. Modern mining started in the mid-18th century.  

Fishing, sightseeing, day cruises, spas, skiing, cycling, boating and hiking are sports and 

adventure activities which the geopark offers to visitors.  

Designing a geopark calendar on the geopark website is an innovative strategy for 

advertising regional festivals of Magma Geopark. Establishment of museums and galleries 

(e.g. an art gallery for paintings, ceramics, glass art, wooden art and so on) are another 

activity of the geopark (Magma Geopark website, 2010).     

 

4.1. 2.22.  Papuk Geopark (Croatia)  

The Papuk Geopark is situated in the eastern part of Croatia, in the Slavonia region. The 

lowland area of Slavonia is mostly flat agricultural landscape and Papuk as a part of 

Slavonian Mountains is a fairly distinctive feature in such a landscape. Papuk Geopark 

covers an area with altitudes ranging from 200 to 953 meters and comprises the area of 

the whole Papuk Nature Park (336 km2) that was protected by Croatian government in 

1999 (Radoniç and Paviç, 2007). Papuk was registered in the UNESCO Global Geopark 

Network in 2007; the geopark is under the supervision of government and the ministry of 

culture and tourism department financially support it. The geopark also earns some money 

from organizing walking tours, selling tickets or souvenirs. The Papuk Geopark is a 

famous geopark in making souvenirs related to geopark elements such as Bat badges, 

Papuk Nature Park T-shirts, Papuk Nature Park logo badges, and so on (Appendix 19). 

Moreover, the geopark cooperates with all national parks and nature parks of Croatia.  



Chapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted 

142 

Forest vegetation covers more than 96% of Papuk Nature Park and bats are famous 

forest inhabitants; they also live underground in Papuk.  

Beside the ecological diversity, there is geological and cultural heritage in this territory. 

Papuk is made of rocks whose ages presumably vary about 400 million years, from the 

Paleozoic through Cenozoic sediments reaching the youngest geological features as tuff 

barriers on Papuk waterfalls, whose creation process is present even today (Radoniç and 

Paviç, 2007). 

One of the results of complex geological relations in Papuk is the hydro-geological 

phenomenon of warm springs in several stream valleys.  

Furthermore, there are significant remains of cultural heritage in the Papuk Geopark 

associated with the pre-historic period and the middle ages (Radoniç and Paviç, 2009).  

Geopark officials provide some tourist facilities including an educational centre, 

multimedia hall and visitor centre which are placed in Velika. In addition, numerous hiking 

trails enable visitors to stroll around the geopark. For sport enthusiasts there are free-

climbing sites and paragliding lifts off-site. There are 104 kilometres of marked bicycle 

trails in Papuk and three educational paths with educational panels introduce the natural 

and cultural heritage of area to visitors. The public institution is offering interpretative 

guides through the natural and cultural heritage of the Nature Park for organized groups of 

visitors, and for schoolchildren, authorities have prepared several educational programs in 

nature. 

 

4.1. 2.23.  Kanawinka Geopark (Australia) 

The Kanawinka Geopark with 26910 km2 area is located in Southern Australia (Limestone 

Coast), Western District of Victoria, and has become recognised as Australia's first 

National Geopark and the first Australian UNESCO Global Geopark in 2008. The geopark 

is managed by the local government and private administrations; 7 local municipalities 

financially support it. The geopark has close collaboration with Park Victoria, tourism 

sectors, and the geological society.  

One of the most important aspects of the geopark is the link between the geology and the 

people, their stories, culture, and history that builds a sustainable source of geotourism, 

brings jobs to rural and indigenous people and in turn helps to protect sites of importance 

and promote geo-heritage.   



Chapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted 

143 

Kanawinka is the aboriginal meaning for "the land of tomorrow", but this area of Australia 

is considered as an important part of understanding the history of the earth's development 

(GGN, 2008b). 

Geopark authorities also place emphasis on volunteers working in the area, not only to 

conserve the natural environment but also to provide services for tourists. 

Besides this, interpretive signs, trail maps, workshops (such as basket weaving and 

volcanic), helicopter tours around the coast, and a visitor information centre are facilities 

which are offered to tourists.   

Furthermore, the visitor information centre (The Lady Nelson) gives visitors both 

professional and recreational overview of the region, and this place helps in employment 

of local and other scientists, writers, photographers, and artists to produce dedicated 

geopark literature.   

In addition, the visitors can enjoy seeing and hearing the erupting neon volcano in the 

geology room of the visitor centre and they can have a walking tour in the glass bottom 

cave (Appendix 20). Within the lava areas, there are four main precincts all with varying 

landscapes according to the period and type of eruption, including Australia’s youngest 

volcanoes, highly accessible volcanic cave systems, off-shore volcanic islands, remains of 

coastal volcanoes, and extensive systems of craters, lakes, and wetlands (The Lady 

Nelson Centre, 2009). 

Victoria’s Western District is Australia’s most extensive volcanic province, recognised as 

being one of the most significant and the third largest in the world, encompassing more 

than 56 sites. The Blue Lake and the Crater Lakes area are important sites in the 

Kanawinka Geopark.  

 

4.1. 2.24.  Langkawi Geopark (Malaysia) 

Langkawi Island, one of the well-known Malaysian tourism island destinations and the 

whole of its 99 islands covering a total area of 478 km2, has been designated a Malaysian 

heritage and a global geopark by UNESCO in 2007. 

The management structure of the geopark is officially and financially supported by the 

Federal Government. The Langkawi Geopark has a close collaboration with the Malaysian 

Hotel Association, Malaysia Travel and Tour Association, Langkawi Tour Guide 

Association, Mineral and Geoscience Department, Forestry Department, Wildlife 



Chapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted 

144 

Department, Langkawil District Council, Education Department, Environmental 

Department, local universities, and Tourism Malaysia.  

In 1987 Langkawi Island was declared a tax-free island as a strategy to draw more visitors 

not only to appreciate the exotic beauty of the island but also to shop and spend money. It 

is the only geopark in the world with the same duty-free status as Qeshm Geopark in Iran.  

As regards geology, the island possesses a long geological history that dates back to the 

early Cambrian period. Among  the  main  attractions  of  Langkawi  Geopark are  its  

oldest  rock  formation,  high geological  value,  pristine  beaches,  and  education-based  

tourism (Abdul Aziz, 2009).  

Moreover, within  the  Langkawi Geopark  there are  three  geo-forest  parks:  the  

Machinchang  Cambarian  Geoforest  Park, Dayang Bunting Marble Geoforest Park, and 

Kilim Karst Geoforest Park ( Appendix 21 ) . 

Geopark authorities provide some tourist facilities and services such as sailing, 

snorkelling, mangrove tours, jet skiing, diving, kayaking, abseiling, climbing, jungle 

trekking, gliding and biking. Besides, Langkawi Geopark cable car tour, as an innovative 

strategy, gives visitors an excellent view of the island and surrounding islands.  

Elephant riding which is available in Langkawi Island is another innovative geopark 

activity. Visitors can take short, 5-20-minutes rides on an elephant at the Oriental Village 

in Burau Bay. The last but not the least innovative strategies of geopark are spa therapies, 

traditional Malay body massage and traditional herbal and plant treatment. 

 

4.1. 2.25.  Itoigawa Geopark (Japan)  

In 2007, ‘Japan Geopark Network’ was established by 13 regions. This network aims to 

promote high quality standards in park services, sharing of common strategies, and the 

exchange of knowledge. In 2009, Global Geopark Network approved 3 geoparks in Japan; 

geoparks registered in the UNESCO network were the Itoigawa geopark, the Toya Usu 

Volcano geopark, and the Unzen Volcanic geopark (Sasazawa, 2009).  

The Itoigawa Geopark with 746.24 km2 area is located on the Itoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic 

Line; a fault zone that runs through central Japan. The geopark has many geological 

heritage sites, with rocks, minerals, and fossils ranging from the Paleozoic to Cenozoic 

Era, related to the processes of plate boundary areas.   



Chapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted 

145 

In addition, people living near the local geoparks make efforts to raise local awareness of 

economic development and to encourage healthy living in the area. For example, they 

organize field excursions visiting the natural heritage sites. Furthermore, they invite 

schools from urban areas such as Tokyo to the local geopark and offer the experience of 

agriculture and fishing to students (Appendix 22). Itoigawa Geopark encourages their 

activities partly through the service by the Fossa Maguna Museum and partly through 

financial and logistic supports. The geopark is under the supervision of the local 

government and private sector, but the local municipality financially supports the geopark 

(Takenouchi et al., 2008). 

 

4.1. 2.26.  Araripe Geopark (Brazil) 

Araripe Geopark is located in the South of the State of Ceará, in the region of the 

sedimentary complex of Araripe. Araripe is the name of a rare bird found in this area.  

The Geopark territory extends over approximately 3520.52 km2 and covers 6 

municipalities (Juazeiro do Norte, Crato, Barbalha, Missão Velha, Nova Olinda, and 

Santana do Cariri).  

Araripe Geopark is an initiative of the State of Ceará represented by the Secretariat of 

Science and Technology and Higher Education, coordinated by the Regional University of 

Cariri-URCA. In December 2005, the Ceará State Government requested UNESCO’s 

Division of Earth Sciences to acknowledge and accept Araripe Geopark as an effective 

member of the world network of geoparks under the auspices of UNESCO (Herzog et al., 

2008).  

Finally, in 2006 the Araripe became a member of the Global Geopark Network and the 

first geopark in the American continent (Slater, 2009).  

The management structure of the geopark is official and the Ceará State Government 

financially supports the geopark.  

Araripe Geopark is made up of nine sites of interest defined by their geological and 

paleontological relevance, which were named geotopes and are distributed throughout 

Cariri. They are the most representative sites of their geological strata and of their 

fossiliferous formations (Herzog et al., 2008).  

The geopark territory belongs to a geologic fault bounded interior basin with sediment 

from the Devonian, Jurassic and mainly Lower Cretaceous periods with fossiliferous 



Chapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted 

146 

sediments which are set on a metamorphic and igneous crystalline basement. It is 

noteworthy that the first flowering plants and pollinating insects developed during the 

Lower Cretaceous time in the Araripe (Herzog et al., 2008).  

The geopark authorities strive to develop educational programs for universities and 

schoolchildren (Appendix 23).  

Moreover, they encourage locals to participate in conservation activities; in this regard, a 

group of students and volunteers are working on a conservation project titled “Geopark 

nas escolas”.  

Furthermore, during seasonal events, geopark officials involve locals in workshops and 

fairs to help create supplementary income for local communities. In addition, authorities try 

to introduce the geopark as a tool for developing adventure and nature tourism; therefore 

they have provided some tourism facilities such as sign posts, interpretative panels, 

artificial swimming pools and waterfalls for leisure-time activities, and hikes on trails in this 

area.  

It is worth mentioning that there are some nature tourism potentials such as crocodile 

watching and scuba diving in Araripe Geopark (César Boggiani, 2009). Organizing a folk 

music festival (festival de Repentistas de Araripe) is another innovative activity in this area 

which is a strategy for cultural sustainability. 

 

4.1. 2.27.  Leiqiong Geopark (China)  

Leiqiong Geopark with an area of 405.88 km2 is located in the southern margin of the 

Chinese Mainland, straddling the Qiongzhou Strait. This geopark was registered in the 

UNESCO Global Geopark Network in 2006 (Huguangyan, 2008). Leiqiong Geopark 

consists of three parts: Haikou-Shishan Volcanic National Geopark, Hainan Province, 

Zhanjiang- Huguangyan National Geopark, Guangdong Province, and Beihai-Weizhou 

Island Volcano National Geopark, Guangxi.  

Leiqiong Geopark is a geopark with the subject of Quaternary Volcanoes. There are more 

than 100 volcanic cones, lava tunnels, maar and maar lakes. It can be said that Leiqiong 

Geopark is a natural exhibition garden of Quaternary volcanoes. 

The geopark has concentrated on maar clusters, and become the place where Maar Lake 

was first studied in China. Moreover, Leiqiong Geopark organizes the cooperative study of 

Chinese and German scientists (Kuiyuan et al., 2008). 



Chapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted 

147 

Turtle rock is another geological heritage in this geopark. This site is unique among the 

volcanic geological heritage of Leiqiong Global Geopark and of much scientific research 

value. Geological scientists or researchers need to study the formation characteristics of 

the turtle rock to trace back the local geological environment during volcanic eruption. 

 

4.1. 2.28.  Yandangshan Geopark (China) 

Yandangshan Geopark is located in Zhejiang Province in China, which covers an area of 

294.6 km2. This geopark was registered in the UNESCO Global Geoparks Network in 

2005.   

Yandangshan Geopark is a geopark with the subject of the geomorphology of Mesozoic 

rhyolite. The rock landform of the park is graceful, and the park in terms of geology is a 

large-scale Cretaceous caldera with abundant various rhyolites (GGN, 2008c).  

Yandangshan Geopark established a sister relationship with Hong Kong National 

Geopark.  

The landscapes of the geopark inspired many poets, painters and writers of China. An art 

geological painting show of Yandangshan Geopark organized by local painters is an 

innovation for introducing the geopark in this territory.  

 

4.1. 2.29.  Qeshm Geopark (Iran) 

Qeshm Island is one of the Iranian communities in which traditional culture and lifestyle 

are interwoven, and this was a key component for UNESCO to establish the first Iranian 

geopark in this area. The Qeshm Geopark with an area of 32,000 ha is located in the 

Persian Gulf, Iran.  

According to the Statistical Centre of Iran (2006), the total population of the Qeshm 

Geopark area is about 17,355 people who live in 19 villages. Pursuant to sustainable 

tourist attraction, the creation of Qeshm Geopark was important for geotourism 

development and the improvement of local socio-economic activities. Therefore, 

Darehshoori and Dakhteh launched the initial research activities of geopark, created in 

Qeshm Island. Accordingly, the primary geological report of Qeshm Geopark was written 

by Haghipour et al. in 2005 (Turner 2008). After that, the S. Turner UNESCO advisory 

group of geopark experts travelled to Qeshm Geopark and prepared a report for UNESCO 



Chapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted 

148 

(Ziari, Rostam Gorani, &amp;amp; Beirand, 2008). Finally, Qeshm Geopark was registered in the 

GGN in 2006 and became the first geopark in the Middle East.  

There are eight major sites in Qeshm geopark, including: Chah-Kuh valley, the valley of 

Stars, A’li Channel, Tandis ha valley, Shour valley, Namakdan caves and dome, Doulab 

and Koorkoora kuh. Furthermore, Kase salkh desert and the Roof of Qeshm are important 

geological monuments in this territory (Amrikazemi &amp;amp; Mehrpooya, 2005). Besides the 

geological heritage, there is ecological and archaeological heritage in Qeshm Geopark. 

Since, the Qeshm Geopark selected as a case study at local level; chapter 5, part 1 will 

discuss the geographical area of the case study (Qeshm Geopark) in detail. In addition, by 

applying a comparison model and SWOT (Strengths, Weakness, Opportunities and 

Threats) analysis, new ideas for geotourism promotion and better management of the 

geopark will be suggested.  

 

4.1. 3.  Summary and Conclusions 

All geoparks have the same targets (conservation of natural heritage, popularization of 

geological sciences through education and geotourism development, development of local 

economy through promoting geotourism and development of cultural sustainability). 

Network activities, collaboration with national parks and other organisations, innovative 

strategies, and the local involvements are key components in leading geoparks toward 

their targets.  

Developing local marketing under the geopark brand is a strategy which Naturtejo 

Geopark, Vulkaneifel Geopark, Nature Park Eisenwurzen, Naturepark TERRA.vita 

European Geopark and Parco Naturale Adamello Brenta have applied to improve rural 

development in their territories. 

It is noteworthy that all geoparks try to organize educational programs for schoolchildren 

and kids because they are not only the future generation of their territories but the 

communication bridge between schools and homes.  

Combining fun and recreational activities with geo-knowledge is another new strategy in 

all geoparks appearing in geo-sports such as climbing, geo-biking, geo-kayaking, and so 

on.  

Development of thematic geotourism can not only be a way for better management of 

geoparks and exchange of geo-knowledge but can also increase the knowledge of 



Chapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted 

149 

geotravellers, researchers, students, and locals who are interested in the specific branch 

of earth sciences. According to natural landscape and geological heritage, geoparks which 

were introduced in this study are classified in 6 categories:  

• Group A (volcano tourist attractions) is famous for its volcanic landscapes. The 

tourists who travel to these geoparks can enjoy volcanic landscapes such as 

volcanic rocks, volcanic bombs, cinder cones, columnar lavas, and so on. 

Vulkaneifel Geopark, Kanawinka Geopark, Bohemian Paradise, Geopark 

Shetland, Papuk Geopark, Leiqiong Geopark, Yandangshan Geopark, and 

Lochaber Geopark are categorized in this group.  

 

• Group B (tourist attractions in the tectonic area) is famous for its tectonic 

landscapes such as faulting and folding. Itoigawa Geopark, Psiloritis Natural Park, 

and Gea Norvegica Geopark are classified in this group.  

  

• Group C (Fossil tourism) is famous for its fossil tracks such as Naturtejo Geopark, 

Arouca Geopark, Réserve Géologique de Haute-Provence, Hateg Country 

Dinosaurs Geopark, Geo and Naturepark TERRA.vita, Swabian Alb Geopark, 

Parque Cultural del Maestrazgo , and Araripe Geopark   

 

• Group D (tourism and mining) is famous for its mining activities such as Sobrarbe 

Geopark, Copper Coast Geopark, Geological, Mining Park of Sardinia, and 

Geopark Harz Braunschweiger Land Ostfalen,  

 

• Group E (Cave or karst tourism) is famous for its Cave and karst tourism; as a 

branch of geotourism, it has gained popularity in geoparks such as Marble Arch 

Caves Global Geopark, Nature Park Eisenwurzen (the first caves with electric 

lights), Qeshm Geopark and Langkawi Geopark.   

 

• Group F (glacier tourism) is famous for the development and conservation of 

glacier tourist resources in geoparks such as Magma Geopark and Parco Naturale 

Adamello Brenta.   



Chapter 4-1- Geographical Areas where the Empirical Study was conducted 

150 

It is worth mentioning that all geoparks include various kinds of geological heritage sites, 

but the aforementioned category is based on the unique geological patrimony in each 

geopark. 

Regarding the development of thematic geotourism, educational activities and 

popularization of geo-sciences, most geoparks belonging to group C (fossil tourism) try to 

make geo-products – products based on geological heritage – such as local cookies 

shaped like fossils. Thus geo-products not only offer local flavours to tourists and 

schoolchildren but promote their geo-knowledge and the local economy as well.  

In addition, establishing theme museums and geo-rooms in geoparks classified in group A 

(volcano tourist attractions) and D (tourism and mining) are other innovations for the 

development of thematic geotourism; for instance, Vulkaneifel Geopark established maar, 

volcano, and iron museums in its territory. Moreover, Mining Park of Sardinia with 

inaugurating a geomineral and coal museum offers geological sciences to visitors. The 

visitors can see the erupting neon volcano in the geology room of the visitor centre of 

Kanawinka Geopark.  

Besides theme museums, the establishment of seven thematic networks in European 

Geoparks is another innovative strategy regarding the exchange of geo-knowledge and 

development of thematic geotourism.   

Furthermore, cave tour books, cave tours, cave tour guides, cave virtual tours, and so on 

which are the geotourist facilities supported by geoparks are categorized in group E (cave 

or karst tourism).  

Consequently, acquiring experience through the comparison of geoparks can present a 

supportive method and a brainstorm tool to discover new strategies for geotourism 

development and better management of geoparks.  

Experiences gained from geoparks around the world can be a guideline for proposed and 

aspiring geoparks which want to become a member of UNESCO Global Geopark 

Network.

151 

4.2.1.  Profile of UNESCO Global Geoparks  

4.2.1.1.   Introduction 

Sustainability as a general concept for tourism has three inter-connected aspects: 

environmental, sociocultural, and socioeconomic; furthermore, geotourism follows 

sustainability principles. This part focuses on three dimensions of sustainable tourism in 

geoparks. The purpose of this chapter is to test the hypotheses stated in chapter three.   

In this chapter the main objective is to introduce geoparks and geotourism as a gateway to 

rural development and sociocultural sustainability.  

Regarding this, samples from 25 geoparks were compared. Data were analyzed using the 

SPSS software, and results profiled by frequencies.  

The European Geopark Network and the UNESCO Global Geoparks Network have 

introduced geotourism as one of the main targets for geoparks in parallel with 

conservation and education. For that purpose it is crucial to apply the network concept to 

geotourism activities, therefore, section 4.2.1.5, is aimed at analysing the network activity 

between geoparks and evaluating the connectivity rate of the Global Geoparks Network 

and the European Geoparks Network 

This chapter starts with sociocultural sustainability in geoparks, followed by examining the 

role of establishment of geoparks in socioeconomical and socio-environmental impacts on 

rural areas, and concludes by introducing innovative strategies and innovation in geoparks 

for the development of geotourism and rural development.   

 

4.2.1.2.   Sociocultural Sustainability in Geoparks 

The aim of this section is testing the following hypotheses: 

• H5: Geoparks contribute to promoting regional geotourism products and local 

products 

• H6: Geoparks promote geotourism through innovative strategies  

• H8: Geoparks contribute to minimizing the negative sociocultural impacts of 

tourism perceived by the local communities  

This section raises the issue of whether the establishment of geoparks is a gateway for 

cultural sustainability and local identity preservation in rural areas or not. 



Chapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level 

152 

According to some authors: Xun and Milly, 2002; Tingshan, 2004; Zouros, 2004; Collyer, 

2007; Mendoza and Navarro, 2007; Poch, 2007; Andr??anu and Giraud, 2009; Marques, 

2009; Fassoulas and Zouros, 2010; McKeever et al., 2010, and Weber, 2009, geoparks 

can play a role for cultural sustainability in rural areas.  

Organizing regional fairs and festivals, establishing cultural trails and museums, rebuilding 

historical places, creating geo-products and promoting local products and handicrafts are 

examples regarding cultural preservation in geopark territories.  

Since creation of geoparks plays a role in promoting local cuisine, products, and 

handicrafts as cultural components, the questions were designed around local marketing. 

The questionnaires sent to all geoparks around the world address several topics related to 

regional food, products, agricultural products, souvenirs, and craft products which are 

illustrated in Table 4.2.1.   

The first question inquires into the awareness of the role of geoparks in promoting regional 

food and craft products. The second question evaluates the methods which are applied by 

geoparks to promote regional products.

Based on the result of this descriptive analysis, geopark activities help to promote regional 

food and craft business. It is noteworthy that for the majority of respondents (80.0%), 

geopark creation plays a role in promoting local cuisine, local products, and handicrafts as 

cultural components.  

Regarding the promotion of regional geotourism products in geopark territory, each 

geopark applies a method (Figure 4.2.1): some of them serve local food and products on 

tours (19%) or restaurants (16%) and some geoparks create local businesses under the 

geopark brand or using a local label for products (10%). Furthermore, 9% of geoparks 

organize regional, agricultural product marketing, and 21% establish souvenir shops in 

geopark villages. 18% of the respondents’ activities are all innovation such as producing 

geo-products – local products which are related to the geopark activities or are the symbol 

of the geopark – certifying agricultural products by use of the local logo, holding 

workshops on local products, exhibiting local products, providing handicrafts and folk 

music during regional festivals and fairs, serving local products in conferences, promoting 

regional and international media, and publishing books and booklets.

The following examples were supplied by respondents to the open question about the 

cultural sustainability strategies of geoparks in their territory.     

The Langkawi Geopark (Malaysia) exposes Malay herbal treatments and ancient health 

rituals to tourists. Moreover, in order to prevent the demise of the local language in the 

geopark territory, a geopark song has been sung in the local language which is available 

on the Langkawi Geopark website.   

The Naturtejo Geopark (Portugal) holds regional and national festivals featuring such  

aspects as traditional soup, local cheeses, olive oil, pottery, bread, and green beans to 

revive the local products and traditional culture. Designing a geopark calendar is another 

strategy for rural cultural sustainability in Naturtejo Geopark. The geopark calendar not 

only conserves the local culture and events in geopark but also is a way to reduce mass 

tourism. For instance one of the festivals in Naturtejo Geopark is the chestnut festival 

which is held in November, and normally autumn is not a high tourist season.  

The Qeshm Geopark (Iran) holds a seafood festival several times a year to improve the 

local economy and introduce local food. In the Qeshm Island, the sea and fishing play a 

major role in people’s livelihood. The other festival titled Nowruz Sayyad as a traditional 

celebration is organised by the geopark at the beginning of the main fishing season in late 

July. At this time local fishermen stop fishing, because they believe that the fish should 

have a chance to reproduce.  

As Halloween is an annual holiday observed on October 31 – primarily in Ireland, 

Scotland, Canada and the United States – Copper Coast Geopark located in Ireland 

attempts to preserve this national festival in its territory through holding workshops such 

as Pumpkin Carving during Halloween. Waterford Harvest Festival is another festival that 

this geopark tries to preserve. Meanwhile, Copper Coast Geopark (Ireland) attempts to 

revive the Copper Coast women's initiative with items such as food, beverages, and crafts.  

In addition, officials of Romania’s geopark (Hateg Country Dinosaurs) established a small 

centre for promoting local products, handicrafts, and souvenirs. They arrange meetings 

with local producers in order to exchange of knowledge for development of local business. 

Furthermore, Hateg Country Dinosaurs Geopark has published a book about local cuisine.  

In another European geopark, Parco Naturale Adamello Brenta (Italy), a project has been 

extended titled “Qualita Parco” for agro-alimentary products and to certify agricultural 

products under the local park quality logo. A basket of park products that includes 14 

typical products from protected area has been created (Ilaria, 2011).  



Chapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level 

155 

With the aim of reviving local handicrafts, Arouca Geopark (Portugal) organizes handicraft 

competitions with geopark themes (appendix 34).  

The findings also illustrate that geoparks attempt to boost cultural pride and to revive 

traditional food, local arts, and traditional culture through exposing them to tourists; 

thereby geoparks, by promoting geotourism marketing and innovative strategies, can help 

to reduce the negative sociocultural impacts of tourism in their territory.  

To give a more detailed description of the role of geoparks on cultural sustainability and 

minimization of negative sociocultural impacts of tourism, the cultural activities of 25 

geoparks are summarized in Table 4.2.2.

4.2.1. 3.    Socioeconomic Impacts of the Establishment of Geoparks 

Since geoparks are pioneers in geotourism and are examples of sustainable local 

development, in this study we try to discover strategies that are applied in geoparks to 

improve the local economy and local business. This section is specifically concerned with 

the effect of the establishment of geoparks on development of the local economy through 

geotourism and creating new job opportunities. Regarding this, this section aims at testing 

the following hypotheses:  

• H3: Geotourism activities in geoparks create opportunity for local development  

• H4: Using geotourism can be a useful strategy for developing tourism in geoparks 

• H7: Geoparks contribute towards increasing geological knowledge and 
employment of local communities in rural areas and geopark territories 

• H9: Geoparks do not function similarly in terms of management  

By comparing twenty-five different geoparks as geotourism destinations in Europe, Asia, 

Australia and South America we accessed various strategies of tourism development and 

development of the local economy in geoparks. Furthermore, in this section we follow the 

specific objectives that are mentioned below: 

• To improve the local economy 

• To identify the role played by geoparks in improving the living conditions of the 

local population 

• To engage the local communities in geotourism and geopark activities 

• To evaluate the role played by tourism in achieving better quality of life and 

education for local population and stimulating economic growth 

 

4.2.1.3.1.  Strategies Applied for Development of the Local Economy in Geopark 
Territories 

Since geoparks are new model of sustainable development and protection of nature, 

some questions were designed to investigate which geoparks are under the supervision of 

which organisations (Table 4.2.3). According to results of descriptive analyses in Table 

4.2.3, the majority of geoparks (52%) are managed officially, and in most countries 

geoparks (52%) are financially supported by local municipalities. Thus, geoparks are 

established at an international level but managed at a local level.   



Chapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level 

160 

In view of the fact that geopark activities are interdisciplinary, the observations illustrate 

that all geoparks cooperate with other organizations such as tourism sectors, universities, 

schools, environmental organizations, national parks, geological and geographical 

organizations, NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations), private sectors, museums, etc.  

It can be said that the establishment of geoparks created some direct job opportunities. It 

is evident that the numbers of indirect job opportunities which appeared through 

development of geotourism and geopark activities is more than the direct jobs in geopark 

territories.

Pursuant to some authors such as:  Xun and Milly, 2002; Xun and Ting, 2003; Zouros,

Dowling, 2009; Turner, 2008; McKeever et al., 2010, and Zouros, 2009; the establishment 

of geoparks in rural areas can play an important role in the development of the local 

economy. Promoting geotourism and ecotourism to attract more tourists, creating new job 

opportunities such as establishment of geo-restaurants, geo-bakeries, family guest 

houses and geotours, promoting local products and geo-marketing under the geopark 



Chapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level 

161 

brand, creating job opportunities in the form of second job, part time and seasonal job, 

and involving local communities in geopark activities are good examples for the 

development of the local economy in geoparks territory.  

In order to gain experiences from geopark authorities’ knowledge, we designed some 

questions (Table 4.2.4) that reflect the role of geopark establishment in the development 

of the local economy.  

The first question inquires into the awareness of geopark activities in the prosperity of the 

local economy. The second question evaluates whether geoparks provide second jobs or 

seasonal job opportunities for local communities. The third, fourth, and fifth questions ask 

whether geoparks involve locals in conservation activities, workshops, and geopark team 

work.

Based on the result of descriptive analysis (Table 4.2.4 and Figure 4.2.2) the majority 

(80%) of respondents believe that in geopark territories, involving local businessmen in 

tourism marketing such as tours, is the best way to promote the local economy; moreover, 



Chapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level 

162 

68% of geoparks try to link their activities with other local tourism activities such as 

boating, bird watching and cultural activities, for example. Aside from tourism marketing, 

geoparks, with a view to local economic development, strive to support local products and 

services through a label (36%) or direct marketing of regional products (36%).  

 

 

Figure 4.2.2 - Percentage of replies to the different economic strategies in order to promote 

links between geoparks and the local economy (Farsani et al., 2011a) 

 

Observations (Figure 4.2.3) demonstrate that by the end of 2009, geoparks in each 

territory employed an average of about 18 local persons in the geopark structure (mean = 

18.32, standard deviation [SD] = 27.68). Obviously, the average numbers of local people 

who are involved in all geopark activities is more than 18 persons since geoparks, through 

conservation activities, educational programmes, festivals, fairs, workshops, tourism and 

geotourism, engage large numbers of locals and volunteer workers in geopark actions in 

the form of part- or full-time work, seasonal and second jobs. It is noteworthy that 48% of 

geoparks, through providing second or seasonal job opportunities for local communities, 

attempt to generate supplementary income for them (Table 4.2.4). 

According to questionnaires filled in by authorities, during the summer time (from May to 

October), Parco Naturale Adamello Brenta (Italy) authorities employ 40 temporary staff 



Chapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level 

163 

who usually work in the ‘Visitor Centre’, ‘Environmental Educational Office’ and on dates 

when the park carries out the sustainable mobility projects. 

The Marble Arch Cave Geopark (UK) authorities also employed 35 seasonal tour guides 

around the geopark. Moreover, the Naturtejo Geopark (Portugal) strives to create summer 

business in river beaches, jobs in coffee shops near the geo-monuments, summer 

occupation for students working in the Paleozoic Museum and jobs maintaining the 

Iconological Park of Penha Garcia.  

In addition, around 12 people work in the Eisenwurzen Geopark (Austria) on contract for 

seasonal jobs. The Réserve Géologique de Haute-Provence (France) provides seasonal 

jobs in the geopark for tour agencies, and the Langkawi Geopark (Malaysia) provides jobs 

ranging from catering services to food for tour packages as well. 

Furthermore, officials of the Araripe Geopark (Brazil) try to involve local artists and 

producers in workshops and also, during seasonal events such as ‘romarias’ at the 

Cultural Geotope of Juazeiro do Norte, officials attempt to provide some new jobs for local 

communities such as fossil replica workers. 

Results (Table 4.2.4) indicate that the majority of geopark authorities (83%) believe that 

conservation activities improve the local economy in their territory. The last but not the 

least geopark activity is holding workshops by local geologists, local artists, etc. 

Workshops as an educational programme are known as a conservation method in 

geology, and it is not only a way to preserve geoparks but also involves locals in 

workshops and promotes the local economy. Results demonstrate that the majority of 

geoparks (68%) emphasize holding workshops by local communities. 

The next sections will discuss details about conservation and educational activities in 

geoparks.   

Consequently, geoparks play an innovative role for entrepreneurship, the creation of new 

jobs, and reducing the unemployment rate, especially in rural areas.

4.2.1.3.2.  Geotourism Marketing in Geoparks 

According to the National Geography definition, “geotourism is a market of about 55.1 

million travelers who seek authentic experiences, care about the protection and 

preservation of the places they visit, and are willing to spend more money to achieve 

these goals. Average ages range from 43-55 years, average household incomes are high 

Araripe Geopark

Chapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level 

165 

with 38-46% earning more than $75,000 annually, average number of leisure trips taken 

each year is 4 or more, and education levels are also high”.  

Moreover, some authors such as Gledhill (2008) and Boley (2009) noted that geoparks 

are an ideal destination for sustainable tourism and educational activities in rural areas in 

the world, especially in Europe. Pursuant to geopark activities and the literature review, it 

is evident that geoparks play an important role in the development of the local economy of 

their territories through increasing the number of visitors and promoting geotourism. 

Regarding this, some questions were designed to reflect the relation between tourism 

marketing and geoparks.  

The first question is an initial attempt to investigate the relationship between geoparks and 

the tourism sector. The second one evaluates the role of geoparks in the development of 

the local economy in the tourism sector. The third question assesses demand indicators 

for tourists in geoparks, and the fourth and last questions inquire whether the local 

communities are stakeholders in geopark activities in the form of geotourism or not.

Chapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level 

166 

The European Geoparks Network and The Global Geoparks Network hope that this 

cooperation promotes geoparks as a premiere tourist destination, and at the same time 

paves the way to build a better and greater understanding in protecting the natural 

environment. 

It is evident that in geoparks, visitors benefit local economy (through rural 

accommodations, shops, souvenirs, restaurants, handicrafts, recreation activities, 

educational programmes, etc.).  

By the end of 2009, samples indicate that just 40% of geoparks count visitors, and among 

geoparks only 13 geoparks replied to the question (Do you count the visitors?). The 

results of the descriptive analysis of secondary data (Table 4.2.6) illustrate that annually 

an average of 7.8 million geotourists visits geoparks around the world; this number of 

geotourists in the European geoparks is about an average of 4.3 million per year. 

Moreover, the average of the maximum duration of stay of geotourists is estimated at 4.7 

days in geoparks; the number of overnight stays is one measure for the economic 

importance of tourism for a region.  

Among geoparks, Langkawi Geopark (Malaysia) with 2,000,000 visitors per year is above 

all in the samples.  

Therefore, geoparks are known as the geotourist destination in the recent decade. 

Regarding tourism asset attraction, each geopark applies a method to promote the local 

businesses by visitors (Table 4.2.5). Some geoparks generate income by selling entrance 

tickets (44%); some of them try to involve visitors in geopark tours (80%), and some 

encourage tourists to buy souvenirs (80%). Furthermore, 48% of geoparks strive to 

engage visitors in workshops and conferences; these educational activities represent the 

key elements for a successful implementation of the geopark conservation and geoparks’ 

strategy at the local community level.  

20% of respondents selected the option “other” and they mentioned museums, 

educational field trips, local restaurants, local accommodation, shops, pubs, food, coffee 

shops, bars, and outdoor activities as tourism activities which can improve the local 

economy in geoparks.   

Besides this, 88% of geoparks engage locals as guides, park guards, or other posts 

related to the tourism sector. Respondents believe that geoparks employ an average of 27 

(SD= 45.387) persons as guides or park guards. It is noteworthy that, by the end of 2009, 



Chapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level 

167 

84% of geopark authorities declared that locals are stakeholders in the tourism sector of 

geoparks.

4.2.1.3.3.  Geotourism Marketing under the Geopark Brand and Eco-labels 
The last but not the smallest strategy for development of geotourism and the local 

economy is applying the geopark brand or eco-labels in geotourism marketing (in festivals, 

publications, research projects, common marketing, higher prestige, accommodations, 

restaurants, educational programs, and local businesses).  

According to Table 4.2.7 the majority (84%) of geopark authorities noted that geotourism 

markets take advantage of the geopark brand, and 68% of respondents filled in on the 

form that the geopark brand can play a role in the development of the local economy.

Among geoparks, Vulkaneifel Geopark (Germany), Nature Park Eisenwurzen (Austria), 

Naturtejo Geopark (Portugal), Psiloritis Natural Park (Greece) Cabo de Gata - Nijar 

Natural Park (Spain), Naturepark TERRA.vita European Geopark (Germany),and Parco 

Naturale Adamello Brenta (Italy) more than other geoparks emphasize the use of the 

geopark logo or eco-labels for promoting local businesses and geotourism; for example, 

the Parco Naturale Adamello Brenta launched a project titled as “Qualità Parco”. This 

project tries to use the logo as a local environmental / marketing certification for hotels and 

local products. Moreover, the brand is used for agro-alimentary products as well.  

Among the geoparks, Parco Naturale Adamello Brenta (Italy) is the first geopark in Europe 

which obtained ISO 14001 certification; the park can also boast EMAS registration 

(Moranduzzo, 2008). Furthermore, currently, Geo-Naturpark Bergstraße-Odenwald 

(Germany) is implementing ISO EN 9001 standards for the development of the 

management framework and regional development (Eckhardt, 2011).  

Cabo de Gata-Nijar Geopark (Spain) implemented the European Charter for Sustainable 

Tourism (ECST) in its territory and it uses accordingly the logo of the ECST for its 

activities (Elviro et al., 2011).  



Chapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level 

169 

Besides, Naturtejo Geopark has close collaboration with a geo-bakery located in the 

geopark, and has permitted them to use geopark brand on their geo-products as 

souvenirs. Moreover, this geopark established a shop of the Earth (Loja Da Terra) in order 

to supply the geopark products. This shop can benefit from the geopark logo for its 

products.   

Also, in the Nature Park Eisenwurzen, geotourism markets and producers have common 

marketing under Geo Line brand (local geopark brand).  

In addition, Psiloritis Natural Park (Greece) runs a project titled “Land of Psiloritis”; it is 

carried out in cooperation with local stakeholders (taverns, accommodation places, 

agritouristic enterprises etc.) who apply the geopark logo as the brand name for a network 

of cooperating enterprises. Members have to fulfil certain quality standards that have been 

set in collaboration with the geopark and are evaluated every year by a common group of 

specialists.   

Some geoparks such as Vulkaneifel Geopark (Germany) and Cabo de Gata - Nijar Natural 

Park (Spain) use regional eco-labels as a badge of quality and environmental 

management. Vulkaneifel Geopark (Germany) applied to the Eifel brand as a regional 

brand for its activities. The Eifel region (Vulkaneifel Geopark) is a natural area with a 

unique character, known for its attractive landscape and as a region of origin of high-

quality products with the new regional brand “e” which can be recognized directly by 

consumers at the special quality of the Eifel. The brand logo is symbolized with a yellow 

“e”; this brand is a multipurpose brand and is used for agriculture, forestry, trade, tourism 

activities, and local products.  

Moreover, Cabo de Gata - Nijar Natural Park (Spain), in order to have sustainable 

economic activities in the geoparks, applied the Nature Park of Andalucía brand. The 

brand can be used for handicrafts, nature tourism services and natural products (Villalba, 

2010).  The Nature Park of Andalucía brand was promoted by the regional environmental 

government of Andalucía. 

Viabono is a National tourism brand in Germany. Geo and Naturepark TERRA.vita 

European Geopark (Germany) has been qualified by this brand, and the Viabono brand 

guarantees the special experience of travel around the geopark.  

Furthermore, North Pennines European Geopark (UK) has used The Green Tourism 

Business Scheme (GTBS) as an environmental accreditation for the geopark (North 

Pennines Geopark Authorities, 2007). This eco-label is been designed to guide visitors in 



Chapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level 

170 

tourism destinations and help them to select promoters of ecotourism products and the 

new experiences which are offered by destinations. It is also designed to act as a 

framework for operators to adapt existing products to ecotourism or create new 

ecotourism products. 

It is worth mentioning that some geoparks such as the Papuk Geopark (Croatia) believe 

that the geotourism market has still not been developed in the country as it should be and 

the authorities should try to introduce a geopark brand as a sustainable tourism brand. On 

the basis of the results of this research, it can be concluded that geotourism marketing 

and the local economy can take advantage of geopark brands as well as eco-labels.   

 

4.2.1.4.  Socio-Environmental Impacts of the Establishment of Geoparks 

According to some authors Strasser et al., 1995; Wimbledon, 1996; Reimold, 1999; 

Heitzmann et al., 2006; Reynard and Coratza, 2007; establishing geosites and geoparks 

are key components in geoconservation.  

In addition, some authors such as: Catana and Rocha, (2009), and Anderson and Brown, 

2010 argued that educational activities are the best means of preservation of geological 

heritage.  

Moreover, Richardson and Shakespeare, 2009; and Geraldes and Ferreira, 2009; believe 

that involving local communities in geopark conservation projects can be a strategy for the 

preservation of geological and geomorphological heritage.  

The goal of this section is to determine the role of the establishment of geoparks on socio-  

environmental sustainability. This section tries to test the following hypotheses: 

• H1: Geoparks involve local communities in conservation activities 

• H2: Geoparks have positive socio-environmental impacts on local communities   

• H7:Geoparks contribute towards increasing geological knowledge and employment 

of local communities in rural areas and geopark territories 

Regarding this, three open questions were designed for geoparks authorities, the first 

question designed to investigate the conservation activities in geoparks, the second 

question ask how geopark conservation improves the local economy and the third 

question evaluates the number of people involved in geopark conservation activities.   



Chapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level 

171 

Organizing workshops managed by local communities is another strategy of geoparks for 

conservation and educational activities. Concerning this strategy, three closed questions 

were designed: the first question evaluates whether geoparks organize workshops or not; 

the second and third questions ask whether organizing workshops in geopark territories 

promotes the local economy.   

 

4.2.1.4. 1.  Novel Strategies for the Conservation of Natural Heritage in Geoparks 

As mentioned in the methodology section, the NVivo software was used in this study to 

analyse the open question (Q1: what are the conservation activities) and the question two 

investigates how conservation of geoparks improves the local economy. These open 

questions introduced strategies for conservation of geoparks. Applying NVivo software 

identified the terms “local, geosite, educational and project” as key concepts in 

conservation of geological heritage.  

Figure 4.2.4 illustrates the percentage of coverage of the aforementioned terms in the 

analysed record; and illustrates the most frequent terms in the analysed record. The term  

‘local’ shows the most frequency of usage and after that is “geosite” with more frequency 

of strategies. Thus, locals play an important role in the conservation of geoparks, because 

no one knows the territory better than the local community. Moreover, finding, introducing, 

and establishing geosites are other strategies for the conservation of geoparks and unique 

geological heritage. The word “educational” has the third highest frequency, so an 

educational program is known as a way to conserve the geological or geomorphological 

heritage. 

It is noteworthy that results of survey by means of NVivo software supported the 

expectations of the literature review.

Figure 4.2.4 - Results of qualitative analysis of open questions regarding conservation  

strategies for geoparks by using NVivo software 

It is obvious that every geopark includes some geosites; and finding, introducing, and 

establishing geosites are the first steps for geopark creation. Thus, according to the 

results obtained by NVivo software, involving local communities in the conservation of 

geoparks and providing educational projects are key factors in the preservation of 

geoparks which are explained in detail below.        

 

4.2.1.4. 2.  Involving Local Communities in Geopark Activities 

On the basis of the results of NVivo software analysis and the literature review, geoparks, 

in order to conserve natural and geological heritage sites, utilizes the workforce and the 

knowledge of local communities in geopark territories.  

According to the section 4.2.1.3.1, involvement of local communities in the conservation of 

geoparks can be a strategy to improve the local economy; the majority (83%) of geoparks 

authorities argued that the conservation of geoparks can create part time and second job 

opportunities for local communities (Figure 4.1.5).  

Among respondents only 15 geoparks replied to the question (How many people are 

involved in conservation activities?) results illustrated that the establishment of a geopark 

in each territory engages an average of about 11 persons in geopark conservation 



Chapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level 

173 

activities in the form of volunteering, supplementary income, part-time, full-time ,seasonal, 

and second job opportunities (Mean= 10.53, SD= 14.78). 

 

Figure 4.2.5- Percentage of geoparks which believe that the conservation of geoparks 

improves the local economy  

 

In addition to examples mentioned in chapter two, respondents indicated their 

conservation activities as follows: Langkawi Geopark (Malaysia) has organised 

cleanliness programs for schoolchildren and local communities, with the collaboration of 

environment related NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations) such as the WWF. 

Kanawinka Geopark (Australia) is another geopark which takes advantage of the local 

human workforce in conservation activities such as controlling weeds and pests in their 

territory. And Vulkaneifel Geopark (Germany) involves the locals in preventing sheep 

overgrazing. For instance the geopark encourages farmers to carry out special land 

cultivation in protected areas. It is noteworthy that most geoparks employ locals in 

preservation activities such as park guard and site surveillance. 

Meanwhile, some geoparks such as Naturtejo Geopark, Araripe Geopark, Sardinia, etc. 

believe that educational programs play an important role in geopark conservation and they 

try to involve locals in educational activities and workshops.  

Thus, the next section will focus on educational activities and workshops in geoparks.

  4.2.1.4. 3.  Educational Activities in Geoparks 

As mentioned in the literature review, education as a fundamental prerequisite for the 

achievement of sustainable development is known as a conservation method in geology; 

thus holding workshops, establishing museums, thematic museums, thematic networks, 

information centres, geo-trails, providing geotourism maps, organizing geotours, guided 

tours, school class excursions, and outdoor laboratories, preparing maps, educational 

materials and displays, seminars, the annual conference of the European Geoparks 

Network and Global Geoparks Network and so on are strategies applied by geoparks to 

educate locals, children including schoolchildren, and tourists.  

Holding workshops is not only a way to preserve the natural (geo and bio) and cultural 

heritage in geoparks, but also promotes the local economy through involving local 

communities in workshops. Regarding this, some questions (Table 4.2.8) were designed 

to inquire into the awareness of the role of workshops, which are being held in geoparks, 

in the local economy.  

Results indicate that the majority of geoparks (72%) have been equipped with workshop 

facilities and 56% of geopark authorities believe that workshops improve the local 

economy through involving locals, artists, geologists, etc.

A geopark organizes activities and provides logistic support to convey geoscientific 

knowledge and environmental and cultural concepts to the public. This is accomplished 

through protected and interpreted geosites, museums, information centres, trails, guided 

tours, school class excursions, popular literature, maps, educational materials and 

displays, seminars, and so on. A geopark also fosters scientific research and cooperation 



Chapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level 

175 

with universities and research institutes, stimulating negotiation between the geosciences 

and the local population. 

A plan for sustainable development in a geopark territory needs interdisciplinary studies 

and cooperation among universities, schools, kindergartens, museums, local authorities, 

and different stakeholders.   

Consequently, educational activities exist in the core of geoparks' interests and 

operations; geoparks are open-air geological museums and can contribute significantly to 

environmental and cultural education programmes, offering excellent examples for the 

interaction between the abiotic elements and biotic parameters in natural ecosystems. 

They constitute natural outdoor laboratories where children can investigate earth 

sciences. Moreover, geoparks, by having locals participate in geopark conservation 

activities and workshops attempt to improve the local economy of rural areas located near 

geoparks.   

It is obvious that preserving geological and natural heritage is not possible without tourists’ 

and local communities’ awareness. Aside from examples mentioned in chapter 2 (section: 

2.10.1.2), each geopark has applied various educational activities and innovative 

educational tools which respondents mentioned in the questionnaires (Table 4.2.9).

Psiloritis Natural Park that serve for environmental educational both indoor and outdoor. These 
“Educational Suitcases” have been offered to all schools existing in the Park’s territory, and are 
also available for special groups of the Park in Anogia). 

- Developing Educational Suitcases: Based on certain species like the Cretan Wildcat or the 
Psiloritis’ butterfly, the program discusses the great variety of life and the peculiar ecosystems of 
the plateaus. Field activities, educational games, observations, and data collection are amongst 
the various activities supported. 

- Providing facilities to understand the groundwater process: This “Educational suitcase” is related 
to the surface and underground water routes in the carbonate rocks of the Park. It focuses on 
plateaus, caves, and springs, and discusses the individual ecosystems that are formed by water 
activity. Part of the program is also held in English.

  4.2.1.5.  Innovation and New Strategies in Geoparks 

According to Miller and Washington, 2009; innovation is an important factor in the 

development of geotourism. Geoparks, as the best paradigm in promoting geotourism, 

should offer different facilities to visitors which they have never experienced in other 



Chapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level 

180 

tourist destinations. This section attempts to discover policies and new strategies 

(innovation) pursued by the local government of geoparks in achieving goals of 

sustainable tourism for locals in rural areas. The following hypothesis was built to 

investigate innovation in geoparks: 

• H6: Geoparks promote geotourism through innovative strategies  

Designing a question in the questionnaire (Q = Are there some initiatives in promoting 

regional food and / or ecological products?) helped us to find out the innovation applied in 

geoparks.  

This section focuses on innovative strategies of geoparks to achieve three targets 

(education, conservation and geotourism development) in five innovation categories 

mentioned by Hjalager (2002).  

Since management innovation is one of the five categories of innovation and network 

activity is a form of management and collaboration in recent decades, another 

questionnaire was distributed to all geoparks registered (N=66) in UNESCO Global 

Geoparks Network to investigate the relationship between members of GGN and EGN.  

This phase was conducted from October to November 2010 and nineteen geopark 

authorities filled in a form. The Social Network Analysis technique was used, and the 

network was designed by means of Pajek as a visualisation program.   

 

4.2.1.5.1.  Production Innovation 

Production innovation consists of new products or services developed to the stage of 

commercialization. Their novelty should be evident to producers, suppliers, consumers or 

competitors. Loyalty programs, events based on local traditions, and environmentally 

sustainable accommodation facilities are examples of production innovation in recent 

years. The tourism product is a complete experience, encompassing everything from the 

time a tourist leaves his home to the time he returns back (Weiermair, 2006). 

Regarding this definition, traditional festivals, regional fairs, geopark themed competitions 

(Appendix 35), geo-products, geo-sports, rural accommodation, geo-restaurants, geo-

bakeries, georiums, geopark calendars, geopark flags (e.g. Stonehammer geopark flag, 

Canada), geological gardens, stone forests, print media (publications and books), and 

educational programs are new products in geoparks.  



Chapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level 

181 

However, geoparks can participate in socioeconomic and sociocultural developments of 

their territory and surroundings through collaborating with locally-based small and 

medium-sized enterprises. Geoparks include new products and services, ranging from 

interpretative provision to souvenir manufacture and leisure-related activities (geo-sports, 

like cycling and climbing) (Hose, 2007).  

Currently, most of the local productions are linked to the geopark activities to introduce 

geological elements. Taking as examples: the Geococktail (Vulkaneifel Mineral Water 

Cocktails) in Vulkaneifel European Geopark (Germany); the dinosaur bread in Hateg 

Country Dinosaurs European Geopark, (Romania); the ammonite chocolate and the 

ammonite bread in Réserve Géologique de Haute-Provence European Geopark (France) 

(Appendix 36); the trilobite cookies (Appendix 37) in Naturtejo European Geopark 

(Portugal), and the Pedras Parideiras in Arouca European Geopark (Portugal).  

These innovative products not only improve the local economy and present the local 

products but also educate tourists and popularize geological science. For instance, 

Pedras Parideiras cakes existed well before the establishment of the Arouca Geopark. 

This geopark is very important because of Pedras Parideiras rocks.  Although it shows the 

importance of the area, before the establishment of Arouca Geopark, visitors and local 

people learned almost nothing about this geological heritage besides curiosity about their 

existence. Therefore it can be said that geo-products must be more communicational and 

pedagogic tools. 

In geoparks, local products and handicrafts should become close to trade marking and 

should be designed based on geoparks’ environmental and cultural elements. These 

products may be used in decorative or utilitarian ornaments, commemorative goods made 

of stone or wood, furniture, toys for children, and clothes. Trilobite clocks as a decorative 

geo-product in Arouca Geopark (Portugal) can be a good example in this regard.   

The geo-products would certainly stimulate locals for new economic activities in the region 

of the parks.  

Geo-menus and geo-food such as boulder soup and Orogenic toasts, earth slices (plate 

tectonic pizzas) served in the geo-restaurant (Petiscos e Granitos) and geo-bakery (Casa 

do Forno) of Naturtejo Geopark are also innovative products in geoparks.  

Signposts, which refer to geotourism maps, interpretative panels, leaflets, and so on, are 

other tourism facilities (products) which geoparks offer to their visitors.  

The establishment of a geological garden is another innovation in some geoparks such as  

Copper Coast European Geopark. It is noteworthy that botanic gardens offer various kinds 



Chapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level 

182 

of plant species to visitors, and a geological garden located in the Copper Coast Geopark 

exhibit various kinds of the rocks in this territory.  

As Gray (2008) argued, some sports and leisure activities are based on topography, and 

are named as geo-sports or geo-leisure activities. Geoparks also supply some 

recreational facilities such as geo-sports and fun and adventurous activities. In geoparks, 

most sports, (geo-kayaking, geo-bike cycling tour to discover the geological heritage – 

geo-hiking, and geo-rafting) are related to earth topography and geology. Regarding geo-

recreational activities, the Naturtejo European Geopark (Portugal) has designed a trilobite 

swimming board (Appendix 38) for tourists who desire to swim in the pool with a long-

extinct animal.  

All the above mentioned innovative strategies demonstrate that this is the art of geoparks 

that, through innovation, offers knowledge and recreation to tourists. These innovative 

strategies in geoparks are key factors in rural development through involving locals in 

geotourism marketing and geopark activities.  

 

4.2.1.5.2.  Process Innovation 

Process innovation involves a way of raising the performance of existing operations with 

new or improved technology or through redesigning the entire production line (Hjalager, 

2002). These kinds of innovation can be combined with or result in product innovation. 

New technologies have resulted in development of new skills, new materials, new 

services, and new forms of organization. This has been especially true in the last two 

decades, in which technological innovation has played a crucial role. In tourism, 

technology has created a new form of business called “e-tourism” which is today the most 

successful form of “e-commerce”. For instance geoparks use new means of promotion of 

their products (conferences, events, fairs, workshops, etc.) in social networks such as 

Facebook.  Naturtejo Geopark (Portugal), Arouca Geopark (Portugal), Langkawi Geopark 

(Malaysia), English Riviera Geopark, Hateg Country Dinosaurs Geopark (Romania) and 

so on designed a page on Facebook. Through Facebook they invite many members to 

join their groups and introduce and supply their products to members. 

Supplying and selling products through online shops are other new technologies which 

geoparks such as Papuk Geopark (Croatia), Naturtejo Geopark (Portugal), Arouca 

Geopark (Portugal), and so on, have applied for promoting their products.  



Chapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level 

183 

Since the media can play an important role in tourist attractions, the Global Geoparks 

Network and European Geoparks Network have set up a corporative channel TV 

(Geopark online TV). Geopark TV was established in 2008 with 6 partners - ADRIMAG - 

LAG (Portugal), Lesvos Local Development Company S.A. - LAG (Etal S.A.) (Greece), 

Mercury Mine in Closed Idrija (Slovenia), Natural History Museum of Lesvos' Petrified 

Forest (Greece) and North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) (United 

Kingdom). The main objective of Geopark TV, as an innovation, can be promoting 

geoparks and geotourism and fostering the establishment of networks and technology 

innovation. Geopark TV will allow partners to the exhibit natural and cultural heritage of 

their territories and share their knowledge for a better management of geoparks. Providing 

the Marble Arch Caves Virtual Tour (UK) is another example of process innovation in 

geoparks.    

Besides this, geoparks provide new and innovative facilities for education and tourist 

guides. TERRAGAZE mobile (Appendix 39), which was mentioned before, will be a new 

facility in Naturtejo Geopark (Portugal). Naturtejo Geopark is applying TERRAGAZE 

mobile as a field guide which is supported by GPS. It is a portable multimedia system 

directed specifically at geotourism and geoscience education. When the visitor is passing 

through a geosite, specific information is automatically displayed.   

Moreover, Lochaber Geopark (Scotland) is working on mobile phone interpretation 

material for the geopark.  

A text message system is used in Geo and Naturepark TERRA.vita the system is based 

on short texts and dialogues that are read out to visitors regarding geology, earth history, 

and culture (Lehmkuhl and Kluttig, 2011).  

Using a 4D simulator and a series of facilities (satellites) scattered around Teruel province 

are other innovative strategies for the popularization of geology in the palaeontological 

museum of Maestrazgo Geopark, Spain (Alcala, 2011).  

In addition to new technologies, geoparks strive to redesign the entire production line as a 

way to reach sustainable development. It is noteworthy that Casa de Forno (geo-refuge) 

which is located in Naturtejo European Geopark (Portugal) territory was an ancient 

community oven (Geraldes and Ferreira, 2009). In 2007, Casa de Forno was turned in to 

rural accommodation and a geo-bakery. In this rural accommodation, every room has a 

name related to local geological or cultural heritage and it has been decorated with 

geological landscape pictures; furthermore, in the corridors and yard visitors can see a 



Chapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level 

184 

collection of stones and local handicrafts. The manager of the geo-refuge uses information 

technology systems to manage room availability by an e-booking system.  

Also, Bohemian Paradise European Geopark (Czech Republic) has provided traditional 

transportation (steam locomotive) to facilitate travelling throughout the geopark territory.  

Consequently, the above mentioned activities illustrate that geoparks, through producing 

geo-products, applying new technology and redesigning the entire production line, find 

ways to introduce geoparks as new tourism destinations by reinforcing images of the past 

(traditional culture, geological processes, and so on).  

 

4.2.1.5.3.  Management Innovation 

New job profiles, collaborative structures, and authority systems belong to this category of 

management innovation, often in combination with introduction of new products, services, 

and production technologies. “Innovation requires entrepreneurship through which 

somebody struggles to realize the idea as a business idea”. Entrepreneurs are often 

described as people who ‘do something new’ and thus create new value (Wickham, 2004) 

and growth (Ioannides and Petersen, 2003).  

Results of research indicate that developing geotourism in geoparks can generate new job 

opportunities, new economic activities, and additional sources of income, especially in 

rural regions. Moreover, a geopark stimulates local socioeconomic activities by attracting 

an increasing numbers of visitors. It encourages production of local products and local 

handicrafts involved in geotourism and geo-marketing such as geo-products. 

Establishing geo-restaurants, geo-bakeries, family guest houses and rural 

accommodation, organizing geological education programs (for children including 

schoolchildren) and geotours, holding workshops, regional fairs, and festivals, involving 

locals in conservation activities, engaging locals in surveillance of geosites or leadership 

in geopark museums are new job opportunities which directly emerge through geotourism 

and geopark activities.  

Aside from new job profiles, management innovation gives emphasis to collaborative 

structures such as network activity.   

It is worth mentioning that geoparks are established at an international level but managed 

at a local level and network activities (Figure 4.2.6) play an important role in geopark 

management. All experts believe that the most promising vehicles for innovation are 



Chapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level 

185 

cooperation, alliances, and/or networking in various fields such as technology, marketing, 

distribution, and human resource sharing. 

Creating a national or local network or forum is the best way that some geoparks have 

applied to reach their goals (education, conservation, and geotourism). 

Besides the UNESCO Global Geoparks Network, Asia-Pacific Geoparks Network, and 

European Geoparks Network activities, some countries such as Japan, France, Germany 

and China have developed the National Geoparks Network and new National Geoparks 

Fora. These networks are appearing to create close collaboration between geoparks, 

tourism sectors, schools, universities, and businesses. Thus, the national network and 

fora not only provide an opportunity for exchange of knowledge but also encourage locals 

and private sectors to participate in geopark activities. 

Themed networks among European Geoparks, such as the Volcanic Group, the Fossils 

Group or the Coastal Group are scientific networks and have a vital role for better 

management of geoparks and exchange of knowledge.   

Consequently, geoparks through geotourism – “as a niche marketing (special interest 

groups) with geological interest” – encourage innovative firms to achieve economies of 

scope, innovating on the basis of cooperative alliances and other forms of networking.

4.2.1.5.3.1.  Network Analysis in UNESCO Global Geoparks Network  

According to some authors (Lowe et al., 1995; Day, 1998; Murdoch, 2000; Sobels et al. 

2001; Agência Desenvolvimento Turístico, 2008; Lee et al., 2005; Chris et al., 2005; Hall, 

2005; Romeiro and Costa, 2010) network activity can help to maximize the sustainability 

of employment, stimulate processes of social innovation and provide an opportunity for 

exchange of knowledge.  

Since network activities are a management innovation in geoparks and the European 

Geopark Network and the UNESCO Global Geoparks Network introduced the network 

concept to geo-sciences and geotourism, this part of the study tries to discover the areas 

of collaboration between geoparks by comparing nineteen different geoparks as 

geotourism destinations in Europe, Asia, and Australia.  

Regarding this, an e-survey as a new category of questionnaire-based surveys (mail) was 

used. Besides the e-survey, a social network analysis technique was applied, and the 

networks were designed by means of Pajek as a network analysis tool and a visualisation 

program. An electronic questionnaire was designed for sending to authorities of geoparks 

around the world and data was gathered from October to December 2010. Questions 1 

and 2 - With which geoparks does your geopark collaborate? And in which area? – 

investigated the collaboration between geoparks in the areas of: tourism marketing; 

educational activities; conservation programs; production of new products; exchange of 

knowledge; conferences; meetings, and others. 

Bear in mind that the number of geoparks registered in GGN was 66 until October 2010. 

According to the 9th European Geoparks Network conference in Lesvos Island (Greece) 

the number of geoparks increased to 77 in 24 countries.   

Since data for this part of study was collected over three months (from October to 

December 2010), it is obvious that the former geoparks had no collaboration with the 11 

new geoparks for these 3 months. Thus we exclude the new geoparks (n=11) from the 

population (N=77), including, however, an aspiring geopark (Hong Kong) located in China. 

This exception is justified due to the existing collaboration between this geopark and 

Itoigawa Geopark in Japan, and Yandangshan Geopark in China. Therefore, we end up 

with 67 geoparks (Figure 4.2.7). Nineteen questionnaire responses were received (28%). 

The majority of responses were collected in Europe (68%), and the others were from 

China, Australia, Iran, Malaysia, and Japan (Table 4.2.11, Figure 4.2.7).  



Chapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level 

187 

Our network illustrates that the number of links are 501 and nodes (geoparks) are 67. The 

number of disconnected nodes is 13 (Table 4.2.10 and 4.2.11).  

For N number of nodes, Maximum Connectivity of the Network (MCN), Network 

Connection Rate (CN), and the number of connections (IC) are obtained by:  

MCN= =           (1) 

CN=                        (2)  

IC=                           (3)  

Where, ni and n1 denote the number of links and the existing nodes respectively. Based 

on the obtained measurements of network analysis (Network Connection Rate (CN = 0.2) 

and Maximum Connectivity of the Network (MCN = 2211)); network activity in the GGN is 

weak, and the Global Geoparks Network should try to expand network activities between 

geoparks, especially those located in Asia and Asia-Pacific (Figure 4.2.7).

All of the geoparks participate in activities such as holding GGN conferences, and/or EGN 

conferences every year. In addition, all of the geoparks are involved in writing chapters for 

books related to geoparks and geotourism activities. 

Our results also investigated the areas of collaboration between geoparks (Table 4.2.12). 

Further analysis demonstrates that among geoparks, Marble Arch Caves Global Geopark 

(UK) with 103 links (Table 4.2.11) is the leading geopark in network activity. As well as 

collaboration in the areas of tourism marketing, educational activities, conservation 

programs, the production of new products, exchange of knowledge, conferences, and 

meetings, Marble Arch Caves Global Geopark joined EU projects with Nature Park Terra 

Vita (Germany), Vulkaneifel Geopark (Germany) and Geopark Bergstrasse-Odenwald 

(Germany). Moreover, Marble Arch Caves Global Geopark has collaboration with 

Langkawi Geopark (Malaysia) in the field of exchange of knowledge in schools. 

Furthermore, Marble Arch Caves Global Geopark works with aspiring geoparks and gives 

them advice and information. This Geopark has acted as host for future geoparks; for 

instance, some new or proposed geoparks such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, Canada and 

Ireland visited this geopark in order to gain experience and information. This geopark is a 

member in advisory missions and gives practical advice to aspiring geoparks.  

Vulkaneifel Geopark (Germany) with 85 links is the second most active geopark in the 

network. Vulkaneifel Geopark (Germany) has collaboration with 42 geoparks, and the 

majority of collaborations are in the fields of meetings and tourism marketing (Table 

4.2.12). Creating a print media for cross-marketing of participating geoparks by 

Vulkaneifel Geopark and geoparks of Ireland and Britain is the first collaborative activity.  

Providing a brochure for the target group of teachers containing information on Vulkaneifel 

Geopark together with other geoparks aiming to recommend those as destinations for 

school trips, is another collaborative activity in this geopark. The production of common 

material and common presentation for fairs, and participation with European geoparks in 

writing a common coffee table book are enterprises of Vulkaneifel Geopark in Network 

activities.  

Aside from meetings and tourism marketing, Vulkaneifel Geopark (Germany) is in 

cooperation with Papuk Geopark (Croatia), Petrified Forest of Lesvos Geopark (Greece), 

Hateg Country Dinosaurs Geopark (Romania), and Cabo de Gata Natural Park (Spain) in 

the field of the production of new products.  



Chapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level 

190 

Swabian Alb Geopark (Germany) with 69 links is the third most active geopark in the 

network. The majority of its activities are focused on conferences and meetings. Geopark 

Shetland (UK) with 36 links is the fourth most active geopark in the network.  

It is important to distinguish two kinds of clusters in geoparks: thematic clusters and 

geographic clusters. A.P.G.G.N and EGN, which are under the umbrella of GGN, are 

examples of geographic clusters. Moreover, there are seven thematic clusters in 

European Geoparks such as: Volcanic, Karstic, Fossils, Glacial, Mining, Coastal, and 

Tectonic cluster. For instance, the volcanic thematic network includes Geopark Shetland, 

Papuk Geopark, Bohemian Paradise, Vulkaneifel Geopark, the Petrified Forest of Lesvos, 

Cabo de Gata Natural Park, and Lochaber Geopark; the Coastal thematic network 

includes Geopark Shetland, the Petrified Forest of Lesvos, Gea-Norvegica Geopark, 

Copper Coast Geopark, Geo Mon Geopark, and English Riviera Geopark. These are 

cases in point of thematic clusters.  

According to Table 4.2.12, the majority of collaboration in GGN is concentrated in the 

fields of meetings (Link=132), exchange of knowledge and conferences (both include 80 

links). Consequently, it can be said that at present, exchange of knowledge is an 

important target in GGN activity. Moreover, development of tourism marketing (Links=65) 

is the fourth target of Network activities in GGN.

4.2.1.5.3.2.   Network Analysis in the European Geoparks Network  

This section focuses on network analysis in European Geoparks by using the above-

mentioned formulas and Pajek program tools.  

According to the 9th European Geoparks Network conference in Lesvos Island, Greece, 

the number of European Geoparks increased to 42.   

Data for this part of study was gathered from October 2010 to December 2010. The 

former geoparks which had no collaboration with the 5 new European geoparks (n=5) for 

these 3 months were excluded from the population (N=42). Therefore, we end up with 37 

European Geoparks (Figure 4.2.8). Thirteen questionnaire responses were received 

(35%) (Table 4.2.13).

members 

 

Based on the results of the formula related to Network analysis (Network Connection Rate 

(CN= 0.65) and Maximum Connectivity of the Network (MCN= 666)), Network activity in 

EGN is stronger than in the GGN. There are no disconnected nodes in the EGN, and all of 

the nodes are involved in network activities (Figure 4.2.8, Table 4.2.14).

On the basis of the results, it can be concluded that the EGN has concentrated its network 

activity on the fields of meetings (links=122), conferences (links=68), and exchange of 

knowledge (links=65). In addition, the development of tourism marketing (links=56) is the 

fourth target of the establishment of the EGN (Table 4.2.15). 

Among the European Geoparks, Vulkaneifel Geopark (links= 35), Marble Arch Caves 

Global Geopark (Links= 7), and Naturtejo Geopark (Links= 6) are more active than the 

other geoparks in the field of tourism marketing (Table 4.2.15). 

Production of new products is an innovation in geoparks and the results of Table 4.2.15 

indicate that Naturtejo Geopark (Links=7) and Marble Arch Caves Global Geopark 

(Links=7) are pioneers in collaboration in the field of the production of new products.  

There are 44 links regarding other kinds of collaboration. According to the questionnaires 

filled in by respondents, these links refer to activities such as organizing European 

projects, writing book chapters, organizing common presentations, holding common fairs 

and exhibitions, organizing field trips, and cultural projects. Figure 4.2.9 indicates that the 

collaboration degree pattern of members in GGN is similar to EGN members and the 

majority of network activities are devoted to EGN members.

Consequently, the above results can confirm the tenth and the eleventh hypotheses (H10: 

Network activity in EGN is stronger than in the GGN and H11: The majority of 

collaboration in GGN and EGN is concentrated in the field of exchange of knowledge and 

Knowledge transfer).  

 

4.2.1.5.4.  Logistics Innovation 

The development of internet marketing is classified as logistics innovation (Hjalager, 

2002). In most geoparks rural accommodations are equipped with an e-booking system; in 

addition, some geoparks supply their products to visitors through online shopping and 

virtual tours on their web sites.  

For instance Kents Cavern is a famous and important Quaternary geosite in English 

Riviera Geopark (UK). This site is significant for studies in palaeontology. It is possible for 

visitors to buy the ticket and find out more information easily online.

4.2.1.5.5.  Institutional Innovation 

Institutional innovation deals with collaborative and regulatory structures in communities in 

which public and private sectors cooperate together with new rules and regulations 

(Hjalager, 2002).  

Geoparks stimulate development of the local economy through involving local 

communities and local private sectors in geopark activities. As a result, geopark takes 

advantage of local knowledge for a better management of geoparks.  

Local communities and local business people benefit from the common logo of the 

geopark, local environmental/marketing certification, and innovative ideas of geopark 

authorities. For instance, officials of Naturtejo European Geopark (Portugal) play a vital 

role in consulting with locals and suggesting innovative ideas to them with the goal of 

improvement of the economy in geopark territory. Naturtejo Geopark cooperates with 

private sectors such as health centres of natural spa, foreign and domestic active tourism 

companies, NGOs, hotels, restaurants, and rural hostels. 

In addition, Psiloritis Geopark (Greece) runs a project titled “Land of Psiloritis”; it is carried 

out in cooperation with local stakeholders (taverns, accommodation places, agritouristic 

enterprises etc.) who apply the logo of geopark as the brand name for a network of 

cooperating enterprises. Members have to fulfil certain quality standards that have been 

set in collaboration with the geopark and are evaluated every year by a common group of 

specialists.   

The Eifel region (Vulkaneifel Geopark) is a natural area with unique character, known for 

it’s an attractive landscape and as a region of origin as high-quality products with the new 

regional brand “e” which can be directly recognized by consumers as the special quality of 

the Eifel. It is symbolized with a brand logo with a yellow “e”; this brand is a multipurpose 

brand and is used for agriculture, forestry, trade, tourism activities, and local products.  

It is evident from the five innovation categories that learning from the past can be a way 

for building a sustainable future in geopark territories.  

It is obvious that geoparks require innovation in order to achieve sustainable development.  

Moreover, creative ideas in geoparks could lead to improved quality, development of new 

computational paradigms, extension of some current frameworks, local socioeconomic 

development, local sociocultural development, environmental impact, etc. 



Chapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level

It was already clear in 19921 that innovation and change for the creation of a sustainable 

society cannot be achieved without active involvement at the local community level 

(Velasquez et al., 2005). There is widespread acceptance that sustainable development 

requires participation of the community in practice as well as in principle. This is reflected 

in the text of Agenda 21, where the importance of local community action is mentioned in 

almost all 40 chapters (Velasquez et al., 2005). Geotourism as an important marketing 

strategy in geoparks requires innovation and it should not be viewed as an ordinary 

business: some of the necessary innovations involve reforming internal management 

approaches to achieve constructive alterations: some concern new technologies; others 

are related to the nature of monitoring, regulation, and enforcement processes through 

globally agreed standards and reporting mechanisms. Central to all these necessary 

changes is the participation of stakeholders, especially local artists and local communities. 

Meanwhile, Schiller (2002) indicates that many clients in tourism marketing want to 

interact with the local culture and wildlife of a destination.  

Thus, innovation and participation of local communities are two key components in 

geopark management planning and geopark activities (Figure 4.2.10).

Earth Summit.

Accordingly, geoparks as new tourism destinations, through promoting geotourism and 

applying initiatives, find ways to popularize geological sciences, revive traditional culture, 

and promote local development. We have summarized the innovation of geoparks 

adapted from Hjalager’s (2002) definition in the following Table (4.2.16).

Reynard (2008) noted that geotourists need different infrastructures, goods, and services 

to facilitate their visit (Figure 4.2.11). For example, cableways for accessing a remote 

geosite (crater), interpretative panels, or guided tours are elements offered to geotourism. 

Results of the literature review of geoparks and questionnaires filled in by geopark 

authorities indicated that providing facilities for geotourists are mostly an extension of the 

Reynard model (Figure 4.2.12). Geoparks offer different facilities to tourists which they 

have never experienced in other tourist destinations. Geotourism is a market that strives 

to provide unique experiences for visitors through initiatives. For instance, boat tours in 

geoparks have added the geological story of the earth to their traditional interpretation. 



Chapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level 

210 

Moreover, kayak tour guides are seeking information about geology to enhance their 

stories of the natural and cultural landscape. Trail designers are looking for geological 

information to develop interpretive signs along walkways. Tour operators working in the 

cruise ship market have considered tours of geological sites for ship passengers. Besides, 

geo-products not only make an opportunity for tourists to experience new and local 

products, but increase their knowledge about geology as well.   

Lastly, providing new job opportunities, new accommodation, new facilities, and new 

products are initiatives of geoparks to attract more tourists to their territories.

Chapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level 

212 

4.2.1. 6.   Summary and Conclusions 

Geoparks as open museums are established at International level but managed at local 

level; the clearest results of the investigation indicate that the majority of geoparks (52%) 

are managed officially, and in most countries geoparks (52%) are financially supported by 

local municipalities, therefore, geoparks do not function similarly in terms of management 

(H9).  

Since the majority of geoparks are located in rural areas, geopark and geotourism are 

opportunities for cultural sustainability and rural development; they also reduce the rate of 

unemployment and emigration through engaging the local communities in geopark 

activities.  

Geoparks authorities try to improve the local economy through geotourism, education, and 

conservation activities. Geopark authorities have taken some positive policies toward 

stimulating locals in participating in activities leading to local economy prosperity, cultural 

sustainability and preservation of natural resources: 

Firstly, geopark authorities involve locals in conservation activities; creating a geopark in 

each territory engages an average of about 11 persons in geopark conservation activities 

in the form of voluntary, supplementary income, part-time, full-time ,seasonal, and second 

jobs (Mean= 10.53, SD= 14.78). 

Moreover, the results indicate that the majority of geoparks authorities (83%) believe that 

conservation activities improve the local economy in their territory; for instance, geoparks 

employ and involve locals in preservation activities such as conservation projects, park 

guards and site surveillance.  

The above results can confirm the first hypothesis (H1: Geoparks involve local 

communities in conservation activities). Accordingly, there is an interaction between 

socioeconomic development and conservation of the natural environment of the geopark.  

Since organizing educational activities is a means for preservation of natural heritage, a 

geopark also fosters scientific research and cooperation with universities and research 

institutes, stimulating the negotiation between the geosciences and the local population. 

The results also indicate that the majority of geoparks (72%) have been equipped with 

workshop facilities and 56% of geopark authorities believe that workshops improve the 

local economy through involving locals, artists, geologists, etc. in workshops.  



Chapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level 

213 

Accordingly, findings confirmed the seventh hypothesis (H7: Geoparks contribute to 

increasing the geological knowledge and employment of local communities in rural areas 

and geopark territories).  

In the second strategy, geoparks encourage locals to participate in tourism activities; the 

results illustrate that the majority (80%) of respondents believe that involving local 

business people in tourism marketing is the best way to promote the local economy; 

moreover 68% of geoparks try to link their activities to other local tourism activities such 

as boating, bird watching, cultural activities, etc.   

Besides this, geoparks with a view to the development of local economy strive to support 

the local products and services through a label (36%) or direct marketing of regional 

products (36%).  

It is noteworthy that 48% of geoparks through creating second job or seasonal job for local 

communities attempt to generate supplementary income for them.  

Moreover, the majority (84%) of geopark authorities noted that geotourism markets take 

advantage of the geopark brand; for instance geoparks apply geopark logos as a local 

environmental/marketing certification for hotels, local products and souvenirs. Geoparks 

use the logo for publications (geotourism maps, books, newsletters, monthly reports, etc.) 

and promoting geo-products. Thus, geotourism activities under the geopark brand create 

opportunities for local development.   

The geotourism an ‘emerging tourism’ niche is still at an early stage of commercial 

development, but in the near future geoparks will be known as geotourism destinations for 

those who want to know more, and will be more active in the development of the local 

economy.  

In the fourth strategy, geoparks – through promoting geotourism in their territory – strive to 

revive traditional culture and decrease the negative cultural impacts of tourism.  

For sociocultural sustainable development, geoparks try to organize local markets for 

regional and agricultural products, to make souvenirs, to serve local food on tours, to hold 

workshops, festivals, fairs, local dances, local music, and educational programs. 

Moreover, geoparks through innovative strategies strive to introduce the locals’ traditional 

skills to tourists. For example, geo-products which are made based on geological 

elements of geoparks not only introduce the local products and the local handicrafts to 

tourists, but increase the public knowledge of tourists about geology. Thus, geotourism 



Chapter 4-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at International Level 

214 

allows tourists and visitors to travel in their territory in order to get experience, learn from 

and enjoy our earth heritage.  

Based on the results of the descriptive analysis, geopark activities promote regional food 

and craft businesses; the majority of the responders (80.0%) mentioned that geopark 

creation plays a role in promoting local cuisine, products, and handicrafts as cultural 

components.  

According to the findings, geoparks attempt to revive traditional food, local arts, and 

traditional culture through exposing them to tourists; thereby, geoparks, by promoting 

geotourism and innovative strategies reduce negative sociocultural impacts of tourism in 

their territory. Consequently, geotourism can also contribute significantly to local cultural 

preservation, and the finding allows us to confirm H5 (Geoparks contribute to promoting 

regional geotourism products and local products) and H8 (Geoparks contribute to 

minimizing the negative sociocultural impacts of tourism perceived by the local 

communities). This indicates that geoparks as pioneers in geotourism development can be 

considered as a sustainable base for the development of tourism.   

Further analysis illustrates that annually an average of 7.8 million geotourists visit 

geoparks around the world. These numbers of geotourists in European Geoparks are 

about average of 4.3 million per year. According to network analyses, among geoparks, 

Vulkaneifel Geopark (links=35), Marble Arch Caves Global Geopark (Links=7), and 

Naturtejo Geopark (Links=6) are more active than the other geoparks in the field of 

tourism marketing.  On the basis of the results of network analysis of this research, it can 

be concluded that Network activity in the EGN is stronger than in the GGN, and the GGN 

and EGN have concentrated their network activity on collaboration areas of meetings, 

conferences, and exchange of knowledge. In addition, geopark authorities attempt to 

develop tourism marketing in their territory. It can be said that the geoparks not only try to 

popularize the geological and geomorphological heritage and sciences, but also introduce 

geoparks and geosites as new tourism destinations.  

The results can also provide some support for introducing geoparks as new geotourism 

destinations in the near future. On the basis of the results of this research, it can be 

concluded that geoparks, through promoting network activity, innovation and novel 

strategies, try to offer new geotourism facilities to visitors and can increase visitors’ 

knowledge especially in the field of geology, geography, geodiversity, and culture.  

 



 

 

 

 

 

CHAPTER 5- Sustainable Tourism in 
Qeshm Geopark (Iran)  

 
Part 1- Characterization of the Geographical 

Area of the Case Study 



Chapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study  

215 

5.1.1.  Introduction 

Experiences gained from the literature review and chapter 4 are gateways and guidelines 

for better management of the Qeshm Geopark. Innovative strategies and policies in 

geoparks around the world can help us to discover strengths, weakness, opportunities and 

threats in the Qeshm Geopark.  

This chapter explains the characterization of the geographical area of Qeshm Geopark as 

a case study. It begins with a description of natural (geological, ecological) and cultural 

heritage in the geopark.   

Since sustainable development indicators can lead to better decisions and more effective 

actions, indicators of Sustainable Development for Qeshm Geopark were collected in sec-

tion 5.1.8. At the end, according to sustainable development indicators and experiences 

gained from geoparks around the world three SWOT matrices were designed for devel-

opment of geosites, eco-sites and cultural activities in Qeshm Geopark.   

 

5.1.2.  Qeshm Geopark (Iran)  

Qeshm Geopark with an area of 32000 hectares is located in the west of the Qeshm  

Island between the axes 26°, 44´, 62"N‚ and 26°, 35´, 00"N‚ and the meridian axes 55°, 

44´, 28"E ‚ and 55°, 44´‚44" E in the Persian Gulf, Iran (Amrikazemi and Mehrpooya, 2005) 

(Figure 5.1.1).

Chapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study 

216 

The average of annual precipitation in Qeshm is very low (163.4 mm) and the average 

daily temperature is about 27°C. According to the Statistical Centre of Iran (2006) the total 

population of the Qeshm Geopark is about 17355 people who live in 19 villages. The 

economy of the Qeshm Island is heavily dependent on fisheries, aquaculture, transporta-

tion, and trade. The rural population who live in the surrounding villages of geopark earn 

their living by fishing, trade, and tourism.   

Qeshm Island Free Zone Organization was established in 1990 with the purpose of eco-

nomic development, attraction of national and international tourists and entrepreneurship, 

implementation of public services, and accomplishment of infrastructures enterprises in 

the Island (Turner, 2008). Since the Qeshm Island Free Zone Organization was estab-

lished, the structure of Qeshm Island transformed to duty-free status.  

Pursuant to sustainable tourist attraction, the establishment of Qeshm Geopark was an 

important step for the development of geotourism and improvement of local socioeco-

nomic activities. Therefore, for the establishment of Qeshm Geopark, Darehshoori and 

Dakhteh launched the initial research activities. Meanwhile, the primary geological report 

of Qeshm Geopark had been written by Haghipour et al, 2005 (Turner, 2008). After that, 

S. Turner as UNESCO advisory group of geoparks experts travelled to the Qeshm 

Geopark and prepared a report for UNESCO (Ziari et al., 2008). Finally, the Qeshm 

Geopark was registered in GGN (Global Geopark Network) in 2006 and became the first 

geopark in the Middle East.  

There are eight major sites in Qeshm Geopark including: Chah-Kuh valley, the valley of 

Stars, A'li Channel, Tandis ha valley, Shour valley, Namakdan caves and dome, Doulab 

and Koorkoora kuh. Furthermore, Kase salkh desert and the Roof of Qeshm are important 

geological monuments in this territory. 

Beside the geological heritage sites, there is ecological and archaeological heritage in the 

Qeshm Geopark.  

The management structure of Qeshm Geopark is semi-public administration and Qeshm 

Island Free Zone Organisation supports it financially. The geopark has close collaboration 

with UNDP (United Nations Development Programme) office in Tehran, Environment  

department, NGOs, and tourism sector.  

As the Qeshm Geopark was selected as a case study in this thesis, geology formations 

and geosites of the geopark were discussed in detail, after that the ecological heritage 

(fauna and flora) of the area were considered. Lastly, in order to investigate the Strengths, 



Chapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study  

217 

Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats of the Qeshm Geopark, SWOT analysis method 

was used; SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) provides 

information in matching a firm's resources and capabilities to the competitive environment 

in which it operates.  

 

5.1.3.  The Geological and Tectonic History of the Qeshm Geopark 

Qeshm Island is located on the earthquake belt of the world. The north of the Persian Gulf 

includes a part of the southeast of Zagros structural zone which has been deformed and 

folded as the result of the last phase of Alpine Orogeny in Plio-Pleistocene. The geological 

formations of this belt may belong to the Late Precambrian to Cambrian and include 

diapirs attributed to the Precambrian called the Hormoz Series, which has been active till 

now with a trend toward upper formations at the earth level. According to the majority of 

geologists, this region – from the tectonic point of view – has been active since the Late 

Tertiary as the tectonic zone in the south part of the deformed forehead or the convergent 

belt –Mesopotamia and Persian Gulf region – along with the margins of the compression 

and collision plates of Iranian-Arabic plate. The region located in the southeast stretch of 

the Persian Gulf along with Hormoz and Qeshm Islands can be identified by the structural, 

sediment logical and geological features such as the mainland – which is distant from it – 

with 2.5 km width in the narrowest parts.  

Sea terraces of Tertiary sediments in Qeshm Island are partially accompanied by Quater-

nary deposits; therefore, they have resulted from the compressive tectonic forces related 

to Alpine Orogeny. Quaternary sea terraces are often horizontally stretched, while having 

a slight slope toward the sea. The older terraces, particularly those located on the anti-

cline, have a steeper slope and some mild folding. The terraces are made of corals,  

zoomorphic shells, and deposited marine settlements in the old coastal regions whose 

thickness varies from a few to 10 metres. As for the composition, they contain coral  

deposits, limestone, and sandstone which often cover the formation of the thicker yet 

weaker bedrock with a Duricrust surface (Amrikazemi and Mehrpooya, 2005). 

 

5.1.4.  Geosites in Qeshm Geopark 

5.1.4.1.  The Valley of Stars 

Berkeh Khalaf village is located 5 kilometres from the island’s south coast. In north of the 

village one of the masterpieces of hydro-aeolian erosion (caused by water and wind) can 



Chapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study 

218 

be seen. This site is outside the geopark area, but UNESCO has identified this site as one 

of the major sites, because of the existence of most beautiful geological and geomor-

phological phenomena in this valley (Appendix 24).  

The geological formation is made by soft layers (Maren) which are very sensitive to  

erosion. The initial plateau which still remains more or less intact is located at an altitude 

between 7 and 15 metres from the bottom of the valley and it is made of limy sand stone 

and fossil limestone.  

The valley is an ideal place for the study of different types of erosion. Meanwhile, this site 

is the best strolling and walking tour for tourists. The locals’ income is generated by park 

guards on this site. Moreover, the valley of stars is a suitable place for astronomy, obser-

vation of stars, night photography, and night camping. 

It is noteworthy that the geological formation of the valley of stars is made by soft layers 

(Maren), which are very sensitive and brittle; one can expect some tangible changes to 

occur in its morphology after each rainstorm. In future the tourist’s visits and mass tourism 

may endanger this place, so controlling the number of visitors, selecting a path for tourist’s 

walking and hanging sign posts in this path are the best ways to prevent erosion of this 

site caused by humans (Farsani et al., 2009).  

 

5.1.4.2.  The Roof of Qeshm 

The Roof of Qeshm is a quite high plateau dominating the island's north margin, which 

begins from the central parts and stretches along westward. This plateau is named "The 

Roof of Qeshm" since it is the most extensive highland on the island and one can view 

matchless landscapes from top of this viewing roof. The high-altitude parts of The Roof of 

Qeshm are mainly made of hard limestone that includes many shells, and on its slopes 

and margins one can see high lands of brittle sandstone containing marl and silt which 

have been intensely eroded. One of the best ways to the Roof of Qeshm passes by the 

Tabl village through which – at the end of the road after a 15 minute walk and climbing up 

the slopes – one can mount the plateau's surface.  

Here one can find remnants of a ruined village which is called "Kalat Koshtar". In the ruins 

of "Kalat Koshtar ", one can see traces of very regular ancient walls, residential areas,  

polished rocky pieces, and some quite intact closed spaces, which are similar to animal 

pens or barns and have a structure resembling those of drainage and sewerage systems.  



Chapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study  

219 

In addition, there are some pieces of pottery and baked mud bricks in the ruins which 

probably date back to the Islamic period. The interesting point there is the use of hard 

limestone in the region's constructions, which have been supplied by the upper limy layers 

of the plateau.  

The existence of a water reservoir there suggests that in the past the natives of the two 

villages of Tabl (on the north coast) and Salakh (on the south coast) used to use Qeshm 

Roof as summer and winter resorts during hot and humid months.  

The view of the Mangrove Sea Forest from above Qeshm Roof including the north coasts 

of Persian Gulf and the novel erosion scenes in south of the plateau is among the land-

scapes which can keep people watching and contemplating for long hours; and maybe 

one could proceed to put up a tent to stay overnight there looking at the stars (Amrikazemi 

and Mehrpooya, 2005). 

 

5.1.4.3.  Chahkooh Valley (Tectonic – Erosion Phenomenon) 

The ChahKooh valley situated in the southeast of the East Chahoo village is approxi-

mately 85 km from the town of Qeshm. 

In the vicinity of the Chahoo Village, at the north border of the west of the Island, one can 

see two crossed valleys with tall walls, which show quasi-karst morphology. On the bottom 

of one of the valleys extending from North to South, the south entrance is wider than the 

north side and shows a more or less U-shaped form. The valley gets less wide as it moves 

south, and at the end it becomes V-shaped so that one can hardly pass through it and 

there is also little light (Amrikazemi and Mehrpooya, 2006). These specifications are  

suggestive of the fact that the valley is the result of flooding. The valley walls show  

numerous trenches and erosion lines. Some of its trenches appear to be deeper and take 

spoon-shaped or funnel-shaped forms. The walls are mainly made of limy sandstone and 

due to the existence of red marl, silt, and limy inter-layers one can see intense dissolution 

and erosion so that many small and big holes appear all along the valley wall (Amrikazemi 

and Mehrpooya, 2005).  

This strait, due to having quite high vertical walls, the existence of trenches, and parallel 

and deep erosion lines along with the various kinds of hemispherical and oval holes,  

enjoys a very special beauty (Appendix 25).  

Besides the tourism potential, there are very deep well-like pits where flowing waters, after 

each rainfall, gathers in the valleys and is used by region's dwellers. It seems the digging 



Chapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study 

220 

of water wells, which are used by the natives, has followed the formation of the deep  

dissolution holes and in fact the work of nature has been completed by man. In addition, 

along the main valley and the crossed ones, we can see a narrow stream-like channel, 

which has been dug to lead the valley's waters into the well. So this valley is a traditional 

rain water harvesting system. This rain water harvesting system is one of the targets of 

sustainable development. Moreover, Chahkooh is a wonderful place for the study of  

different types of erosion.  

Unfortunately, in some parts of the valley there are some mementos, which have been 

inscribed on walls by tourists that detrimentally affect the landscape. Moreover, in future 

the tourist’s visits and mass tourism may endanger this place; therefore a control of the 

number of visitors is the best way to prevent erosion of this site caused by humans.  

Because of high visiting demands on Nowruz holidays, Qeshm Island Free Zone Organi-

zation has invested on some basic infrastructures including: rubbish bins, asphalt roads, 

toilets, parking areas, guard kiosks, and signposts (Khademi, 2008). 

 

5.1.4.4.  Three Namakdan Salt Cave  

Caves in some parts of the world are formed in a very soluble material: salt. The most sig-

nificant of these caves are found in arid regions, such as the Atacama Desert in Chile,  

Israel, and Iran. Several expeditions of the Czech cavers have discovered the longest salt 

cave on Qeshm Island in the Southern coast of Iran, the 3N Cave, 6580 metres in length 

(Filippi, 2007). The 3N salt cave has developed in the SE part of Namakdan salt diapir in 

the western part of Qeshm Island (Figure 5.2).  

Salt Diapirs and salt caves, which are rare and unique phenomena in the world, have a 

high degree of importance in the creation of Qeshm Geopark and development of geotour-

ism in this region (Asadi et al., 2008). There are some unique and aesthetic underground 

phenomena in 3N cave including: micro climate, alluvial fan, meandering, salt speleo-

thems, curved stalactites, shafts, waterfalls, chimneys, and a salt lake (Appendix 26). 

 



Chapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study  

221 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 5.1.2 - The geographic location of 3N salt cave, Qeshm Geopark, Iran,  

(Source: Asadi, et al., 2008) 

 

Beside their tourism potential, salt caves are used for relaxation and treatment of respira-

tory tract diseases, allergies, and chronic bronchitis (Mahmoodi and Ramezani, 2008). 

The unique microclimate in salt caves treats skin diseases such as psoriasis or acne. The 

air in the salt caves is enriched by particles of iodine, potassium, sodium, calcium, mag-

nesium, selenium, bromine, and many other elements that are essential for the proper  

activity of the human organism.  

Nowadays, there are many artificial salt caves in the Czech Republic and Poland where 

walls of these relaxation rooms are made of massive salt blocks and the floor is covered 

with a 20 cm thick layer of salt. There is also a salt pillar, a waterfall, and air moisteners in 

the cave. For children, there is a salt pit where they can play. Annually countless visitors 

spend their leisure-time in these artificial caves.  

Consequently, after implementation of infrastructure and conservation methods in Qeshm 

Geopark these natural salt caves can be visited by tourists.  

In addition to tourism development, Namakdan diapir is a salt mine which can help locals 

in generation of income through salt extraction. Salt extraction is forbidden in 3N salt cave 



Chapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study 

222 

since it is one of the major sites of geopark, but local companies and people extract salt 

from other caves around the Namakdan diapir. 

Furthermore, salt caves and salt diapirs are unique geological phenomena; therefore  

geologists, speleologists, cave explorers, students, and researchers are the major visitors 

of this geopark site. However, at present there are not enough infrastructures for public 

tourists (asphalt path, interpretative panels, signs, etc.). In recent years as a result of  

encountering tourist’s visits and mass tourism, one Namakdan salt cave was damaged 

and many beautiful cubic crystals and stalactites were devastated. Moreover, entering the 

salt dome surface as well as caves is extremely hazardous and can easily result in serious 

injuries or even death of visitors. Hence, the local administration decided not to advertise 

this geopark site before implementation of the infrastructures. 

Recently, the planning management is in the execution phase and a 3N salt cave hall was 

selected for visitors. For the attraction of tourists to this sensitive site, consulting with the 

caver specialists who have researched on conservation methods and tourist facilities is 

very important because salt domes, or salt caves, are an extremely dynamic environment 

that changes very rapidly and needs control management.  

 

5.1.4.5.  Tang-e-Ali Gorge 

Tang-e-Ali gorge is located in the west part of the island – south of East Chahoo village – 

and generally extends along the north-south line. The gorge north entrance is about 2 km 

from the north coast via East Chahoo village, and while its mouth is initially wide, after  

travelling for less than 50m, it immediately becomes narrower.  

Also the thin layer of clay and marl on the gorge floor – in which so many cracks are ob-

servable and show high viscosity – is a reason for the high rate of moisture in this gorge.  

Many holes and trenches can be seen in the walls of the gorge which are hemispherical, 

spoon-like and niche-like shapes and are among the main elements of beauty in this 

gorge. The linear and niche-like trenches and furrows can be seen parallel at many points 

and the reason behind this is the dissolution and erosion which has occurred in the clay 

and marl inter-layers that are more susceptible to erosion than limy sandstone (the main 

part of the walls).  

In addition, the existence of clay and marl in these layers and their being spoilt by erosion 

has created these hemispherical shapes. The rapid and whirling movement of water in 



Chapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study  

223 

times of torrent is another factor, which led to erode the layers and created blade-like and 

wedge-like forms with sharp edges.  

In the walls of the gorge, one can see numerous small and big joints as well as a few 

faults, which most probably are the result of the movements in the neighbouring salt 

dome. In the middle of the gorge, the course gets very rough and narrow and walls come 

tightly toward each other so that in some parts one should use one’s hands to be able to 

pass through. The gorge at its south end meets the southeast walls of the Namakdan salt 

dome and its course toward the south coast is completely different from the northward 

course; here the manifestations resulting from the outcropped salt dome are observable 

(Amrikazemi and Mehrpooya, 2005). 

 

5.1.4.6.  Tandis ha Valley  

Almost throughout the island, one can find a wide array of beautiful phenomena created 

by water and wind erosion. This site is similar to the valley of Stars, but more extensive 

and the density of the phenomena congestion is lower but with more frequency. The Tan-

dis ha valley, which is located approximately 75 km southeastern of Tabl village, is a typi-

cal site for observation of erosion features (Amrikazemi and Mehrpooya, 2005). Among 

the numerous forms of erosion we can name the column erosion such as chimney rocks, 

mushroom-shaped, arched, global, kidney-shaped forms, small and big cones and pyra-

mids, as well as the shapes similar to human profiles and different animals (Appendix 27).   

Beside the Tandis ha valley there are many erosion features in other geopark geosites, for 

instance the Koorkoora Kuh site, which is located near the Giyahdan village, encom-

passes beautiful landforms with hills in the shape of pyramids. At this geosite, which is 

situated adjacent to date palms and the ancient dam (Sasani dam), appears an attractive 

path for taking tours for a stroll.  

In addition, the Doulab geosite which is situated near the Doulab village with badlands on 

sedimentary foothills has created an attractive place for adventure tourism. The last but 

not the least geosite is the Shour valley which is located near the Salakh village. This site 

has a high potential for rural tourism; there are different scale erosion landscapes in the 

Shour Valley. The sulphurous spring and traditional treatments by local people in this site 

are other tourist attractions in this territory.  



Chapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study 

224 

It is worth mentioning that springs of the Qeshm Island are salty and they have no fresh 

water. Kargah is known as an important sulphurous spring and Goori as a salt spring in 

this geopark.  

 

5.1.5.  Qeshm's Coasts 

Apart from Simin Beach, which provides suitable entertainment facilities by a calm sea as 

well as a beautiful less steep coast, Qeshm has various intact coasts, which may welcome 

people with a variety of tastes. Namakdan mount which near the coast, due to being rich 

in shiny particles of Oligist, which have been accumulated on the very cream bed of fine 

grains of sand, has become a shiny and silvery coast.  

Various ripple marks in some parts have covered a distance about 50m without any  

disruption and diversion, which is itself suggestive of the sea’s peacefulness, lesser 

steepness, and homogeneity in the kind and size of the coastal sands.  

The coastal terraces can also be seen in different regions. Because of the terraces walls 

being so hard, the erosion factor has affected them less, therefore one can see a rocky 

face full of jagged edges. The crashing of waves on these walls and the rocks' firmness 

and steadiness are associated with the everlasting fight between the sea and the coast.  

The crustacean accumulation of various species of bivalves, gastropods, and particularly 

crabs in these regions show the untouched of coasts whose natural visage is a point of 

interest. Generally, the south coasts of Qeshm Island can be considered as the most 

beautiful and most intact coasts in the Persian Gulf. 

Furthermore, watching the droves of camels near coasts of the Persian Gulf and roads of 

geopark is another tourist attraction which is unique among the other geoparks.   

 

5.1.6.  Ecological Resources  

Beside the geological sites, the Qeshm Geopark has variety in ecological sites. There are 

four major ecological sites in the Qeshm Geopark including: Harra sea forest, coastal 

coral, coastal Hawksbill turtles, the natural aquarium, and dolphin settlement. 

 

 

 



Chapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study  

225 

5.1.6.1.  Noteworthy Fauna  

Various insects, reptiles, birds, and mammals live in Qeshm. Among the mammals,  

gazelles, camels, and dog-foxes are famous in this area. More than 50 species of bivalve 

molluscs, gastropods, cephalopods, echinoids, and corals can be found on the Qeshm 

coasts. There are different kinds of shrimps, shells, sea urchins, sea porcupines, and sea 

cucumbers in the Qeshm waters. Moreover, a type of amphibian known as Gel-Khorak 

(Boleophthalmus dussumieri Valenciennes) can be found in the mangrove sea forest.   

The number of migratory bird species in the island reaches 70. The mangrove sea forest 

is an important breeding site for herons and numerous species of plover (Charadriidae) 

pass through the area on migration. During the winter the mangrove sea forest is an  

important feeding site for herons, plovers, and sandpipers (Scolopacidae) including the 

grey heron (Ardea cinera), redshank (Tringa totanus), Terek sandpiper (Xenus cinereus), 

bar-tailed godwit (Limosa lapponica), and curlew (Numenius arquata). This site is even 

more important for the wintering flocks of Dalmatian pelicans (Pelecanus crispus), spoon-

bills (Platalea leucorodia), and greater flamingos (Phoenicopterus ruber). Marine turtles 

such as green turtles (Chelonia mydas) and Hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata), 

the finless porpoise (Neophocaena phocaenoides), the humpback dolphin (Sousa chinen-

sis), and the common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) are regularly seen in the area.  

The green turtle, the Dalmatian pelican, the cab plover, and the curlew are endangered 

species (UNESCO, 2008). The variety of fishes in the waters surrounding the Island is 

very wide and different kinds of commercial, aquarium fishes and ornamental fishes as 

well as sharks and whales can be found in the Persian Gulf. During the summer they lay 

eggs on the coasts neighbouring the Shibderaz or Namakdan mounts (Amrikazemi and 

Mehrpooya, 2005).   

Moreover, ecotourists can watch the Qeshm eagle in this geopark. The biodiversity of 

Qeshm illustrates that this geopark has high potential for recreational activities such as 

bird watching, wildlife watching, scuba diving, and snorkelling.  

 

  5.1.6.1.1.  Hawksbill Turtles  

For thousands of years, marine turtles have been a source of food and sustenance for 

coastal communities in tropical and subtropical regions. Human activities, overexploitation, 

fisheries by catch, and habitat destruction have been identified as the main reasons for 

marine turtle decline (Spotila et al., 2000).   



Chapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study 

226 

Today, six of the world’s seven species of marine turtle are classified as endangered 

(Troëng, and Drews, 2004). Hawksbill turtles as endangered species are most commonly 

found in hard-bottomed and reef habitats containing sponges (Edelman, 2004). 

The Shibderaz village which is located in the centrally- southern coastline of Qeshm  

Island, is currently the only stretch used  in the entire Island by Hawksbill Turtles (Eretmo-

chelys imbricata) for nesting and laying eggs. This site has been selected as a major  

ecological geopark site.  

The sea turtles of Iran are all mentioned in the CITES list (Convention on International 

Trade in Endangered Species), and their hunting and sale is legally forbidden. The Envi-

ronmental Protection Organization is responsible for protecting regions where turtles lay 

their eggs. Fortunately, studies related to the egg-laying zones and the identification of the 

species have been completed in recent years (Daanehkaar, 1998). 

It is worth mentioning that consumptive use of marine turtles for meat, oil, leather and 

shell, is unusual in peripheral areas of the Qeshm Geopark but the eggs are endangered 

by dog-foxes and illegal human activities.  

The Shibderaz Village coastline is an important  and strategic Hawksbill hotspot, and in 

2002, the Bureau of Environment and Qeshm Free Zone Area (QFA) received reports  of 

Hawksbill Turtles laying eggs near Shiebderaz Village; hence, Bijan Darehshoori, director 

of Qeshm department of Environment (2001), with the help of indigenous people and 

UNDP, changed Qeshm into an environmentally sustainable Island (Turner, 2008). He  

encouraged and engaged locals in collecting and protecting the eggs (Appendix 28). His 

enterprises brought sustainable use and recycling for the turtle hatchery (UNDP 2003a).  

At present, the environment department has an important role in the management struc-

ture of the Qeshm Geopark. It tries to encourage locals to participate in conservation  

activities of this geopark site and take advantage of indigenous knowledge. Aside from 

local involvement in conservation of turtles, the Qeshm Geopark authorities try to train  

locals as tour guides for turtle watching tours, which is a strategy for the development of 

ecotourism and geotourism in this area.   

It is evident that, local economic development and conservation issues are therefore  

complex; conservation strategies to recover marine turtles must embrace local economic 

benefits, so engaging stakeholder groups in tourism and involving local people in conser-

vation projects are important strategies in local economic development. In recent decades, 

regarding the economic potentials of marine turtles, their non-consumptive use in the form 



Chapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study  

227 

of tourism to observe marine turtles in-water and on nesting beaches has gained popular-

ity throughout the world.  

With reference to Dodds (2006), tourists were travelling to Rantau Abang in Malaysia to 

watch nesting leatherback turtles as early as in the 1960s. In the 1980s, tourism to  

observe marine turtle nesting began in the Turtle Islands Park in Sabah, Malaysia, and in 

Tortuguero National Park, Costa Rica. Recently, 8,450 and 32,854 tourists, respectively, 

visited these sites each year to observe marine turtles nesting.  

In the 1990s and during the first years of this century, marine turtle tourism has become 

popular at many sites in Africa, the Americas and Asia. Each year, more than 175,000 

tourists participate in marine turtle tours. The St. Lucia Heritage Tourism Programme  

announced a 100% increase in one year for turtle watching tours. The operator declared a 

gain of US$27,000 in 2005 up from US$13,500 in 2004.   

In addition, gross revenue for non-consumptive use can be estimated, by multiplying tour-

ist expenditure by the number of tourists participating in sea turtle watching. For locations 

where marine turtles represent a major generator of revenue, the estimate includes all  

expenditure (food, souvenirs, accommodation, transport and other costs) incurred by  

tourists during their time at the turtle-watching sites.  

Theoretically, marine turtle tourism can stimulate people to travel abroad and hence cause 

an increase in international travel and augment resource use.  

It is noteworthy that tourism development can have both positive and negative impacts on 

turtles. In Rantau Abang, uncontrolled tourism in Malaysia affected the behaviour of nest-

ing leatherback turtles. On Zakynthos Island, Greece, lights from hotels, restaurants, and 

compacting of sand by cars and tourists have changed the distribution of loggerhead 

nests on Laganas Bay beaches.  

The economic benefits from tourism can only be sustainable in the long term if appropriate 

control measures are taken. On one hand, tourism can result in decreased marine turtle 

mortality and in supporting positive population trends if it creates economic incentives for 

stakeholder groups to stop overexploitation; and on the other hand, tourism has a large 

ecological footprint because it stimulates air travel, direct use and non-consuming uses of 

marine turtles such as the souvenir market with tortoiseshell.  

Therefore, encouraging tourists not to buy any marine turtle products is another strategy 

to prevent illegal use and overexploitation; furthermore, the presence of scientists, tour 



Chapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study 

228 

operators, and tourists on nesting beaches is a deterrent against the illegal taking of  

turtles and eggs (Troëng and Drews, 2004). 

Regarding this, the Qeshm Geopark authorities hold a workshop for local people of Shib-

deraz village and train some turtle watching tour guides, turtle night guards, turtle day 

guards, and some guards to collect turtle eggs in the night and day. These strategies have 

not only preserved the marine turtles but have created some new job opportunities (in the 

form of seasonal and part time work) for local communities of Shibderaz village.   

Moreover, officials of geopark with the help of UNDP have established rental rooms and 

souvenir workrooms in this village which offer facilities to tourists together with promoting 

local economy. 

 

5.1.6.1.2.   Coral Reef 

Coral reefs are vital ecosystems providing a source of income, food, and coastal protec-

tion for millions of people. Coral reefs are composed mainly of reef-building corals:  

colonial animals that live symbiotically with single-celled microalgae (zooxanthellae) in 

their body tissue and a calcium carbonate skeleton. Coral reefs are found in warm,  

shallow, clear, low-nutrient tropical and sub-tropical waters, with optimum temperatures of 

25-29ºC, although they exist in temperature ranges from 18ºC (Florida) to 33ºC (Persian 

Gulf) (Grimsditch and Salm, 2006). They are incredibly diverse, covering only 0.2% of the 

ocean’s floor and they are often dubbed the tropical rainforests of the oceans (Roberts, 

2003).  

Unfortunately, coral reefs are also one of the most vulnerable ecosystems in the world. 

Disturbances such as bleaching, fishing, pollution, waste, and climate change endanger 

this ecosystem.  

The Persian Gulf is a semi-enclosed marginal sea surrounded by landmasses and is  

located in the subtropical northwest of the Indian Ocean. The Persian Gulf has imposed a 

harsh condition on the marine organisms, especially coral reef communities with regard to 

salinity, temperature, and extreme low tides. This is a very shallow sea with an average 

depth of about 35 meters, and was above sea level 10-15 thousand years ago. Present 

climatic conditions force extreme rates of evaporation, which exceed precipitation and 

fresh water inputs, thus driving the average salinity above 40 ppt. (Fatemi and Shokri, 

2001). In addition, the natural environment of the Persian Gulf is very rich with good fish-

ing grounds, extensive coral reefs, and rich pearl oysters, but its ecology has come  



Chapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study  

229 

increasingly under pressure from heavy industrialization and in particular, the repeated 

major petroleum spillages most of which are associated with recent wars such as Iraq and  

Kuwait which occurred in the region. Coral reefs are located among Qeshm, Larak, and 

Hengam Islands. These sites are outside the geopark area, but announced as one of the 

sensitive ecological sites.  

It is worth mentioning that goods of coral reefs in general are sub-divided into renewable 

resources (fish, seaweed, etc.) and non-renewable goods such as mining of reefs (sand, 

etc.). The services of coral reefs in general are categorized into: physical structure  

services, such as coastal protection; biotic services, both within ecosystems (e.g. habitat 

maintenance) and between ecosystems (e.g. biological support through mobile links);  

bio-geo-chemical services, such as nitrogen fixation CO2 / Ca budget control, waste  

assimilation.  

Moreover, sea food products, ornamental fishes, medicines, raw materials (e.g. seaweed), 

curios and jewels, live fish and coral collected for aquarium trade, sand for buildings and 

roads, physical structure services, biodiversity and a genetic library together with promot-

ing growth of mangroves and sea grass beds and generation of coral sand biotic services 

are other economic potentials in this ecosystem (Cesar et al., 2002).   

The coral reefs of Larak, Hengam, and Qeshm Islands are unique ecosystems for involv-

ing locals in conservation projects and recreational activities such as scuba diving and 

snorkelling.  

Unfortunately, reefs are broadly recognized as being limited to warm, shallow, and fully 

saline waters. Even a small amount of pollution brings significant impact on the lives of the 

marine creatures in the Persian Gulf. Corals in the region live in relatively warm tempera-

tures that average up to about 36ºC in summer. In addition to pollution from the oil tankers 

which is considered as the major threat to the region's ecosystem, industrialization, the 

building of numerous piers and docks as well as the increase in the water salinity resulting 

from global warming all inflict serious damage to the existence of the marine life in one of 

the world's unique locations.  

Due to the uncontrolled and hasty urban development and emergence of the urban and 

industrial sewages in the sea especially in the southern parts of the Persian Gulf by the 

United Arab Emirates and other littoral states, the coral reefs of the region, in particular 

those around the Iran’s Islands like Qeshm, are being silently and gradually suffocated 

(Maghsoodloo and Eghtesadi, 2002). 



Chapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study 

230 

Climate change is a natural hazard for coral reefs, and in 1996 and 1998 El-Nino endan-

gered this ecosystem in Persian Gulf and increased coral bleaching (whitening)  

(Wilkinson, 1998).  

Moreover, these days Cochlokinium (harmful alga) decreases the coral reefs in this region 

(Ansari nasab, 2009). The last but not the least problem is illegal human activities such as 

thievery of coral reefs for the aquarium trade (Zohoori, 2008). But, the coral reefs of 

Qeshm, Larak, and Hengam are under the protection of geopark and Environmental  

Protection Office of Hormozgan province; so coral thievery and sale is legally forbidden. 

The Marine Environmental Bureau started the study of the vulnerable marine zones of Iran 

in 1994 with a project entitled "A Survey of the Vulnerable Marine Zones of the Persian 

Gulf and the Oman Sea". It focused on the study of the mangrove thickets, marshes, coral 

reefs, sea turtles and marine mammals, the waterfowl, the mud flats, the sandy beaches, 

the rocky shores, estuaries, and bays and creeks in this area. 

In addition, officials of the geopark encourage locals to participate in conservation  

projects. In this regard, a pilot project in Salakh village was developed for the rehabilitation 

of the natural marine resources through an indigenous method of artificial reefing. This 

project was supported by the United Nations Development Program Regional centre in 

Iran (UNDP, 2001). 

Moreover, coral reefs are among the world’s most spectacular ecosystems, and snorkel-

ling and scuba diving are excellent ways to explore them. As coral reefs face an increas-

ingly uncertain future, snorkelers and other coral reef visitors can play an important role in 

helping protect these fragile habitats; hence a company with the help of officials of the 

geopark established a scuba diving school in this region.    

Recreational activities can in fact harm coral reefs by breakage of coral skeletons and  

tissue as a result of direct human contact such as walking, touching, or dragging gear; 

breakage of coral skeletons and tissue from boat anchors and also water pollution are 

other negative impacts of marine tourism (Kerr et al., 2004). Thus, for sustainable marine 

tourism, the manager of the geopark and diving school should observe the following 

guidelines in tourism management planning: (Huse and Wilson, 2007).    

• Recreational scuba diving trips should not be organized in sites prohibited by 

national or local authorities 

• Recreational scuba diving is limited to diving no deeper than 40 meters (130 

feet)  



Chapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study  

231 

• Training, educating, or information sharing on scuba diving services should be 

provided by the diving excursion guide 

• Environmental education should be organized prior to or during guided diving 

excursions 

• Marine recreation providers should employ dive leaders who can communicate 

with at least 80 percent of the clients in their language and have facility in the 

local language. All staff training and education should be in the local language 

used by dive leaders 

• A guided scuba diving group should not exceed 8 divers. All groups must be 

under the overall control of the dive leader who will assign a dive leader assis-

tant to each group. The dive leader accompanies one of the groups. A dive 

leader assistant aids the dive leaders in enforcing the safety and environmental 

practices 

• A dive leader should oversee all guided scuba diving activities. If the groups 

are large, the dive leader should have additional dive leader assistants. Dive 

leaders and assistants should share information and provide leadership to  

clients both above and under water by enforcing all provisions of the preferred 

practices for environmental behaviour 

• Water entry points from boats, in waters less than 3 meters (9 feet) deep, 

should lie over sand or rubble, not coral, or in water of sufficient depth that  

divers can make adjustments and become acclimated with minimal impact on 

corals or sea grass beds 

• Coral parks and other conservation projects should be supported 

• Purchasing souvenirs made from coral or other marine life by tourists should 

be avoided 

• Tourists should avoid touching corals; even a slight contact can harm them  

• Tourists should avoid using gloves and kneepads in coral environments 

• Guides and managers should make sure garbage is well stowed, especially 

light plastic items and cigarette butts

  5.1.6.2.  Noteworthy Flora 

The Floristic list of Qeshm Island illustrates that there are 314 species and subspecies of 

vascular plants in 202 genera. The Island’s major vegetations are as follows: mangrove 

forests, halophyte vegetation, psammophyte-halophyte vegetation, vegetation on the 

eroding terraces, and arid woodlands (Attar et al., 2004).     

The first and most important plant community in the Island is mangrove sea forest that 

contains a grey mangrove (Avicennia marina) locally named Harra. The Harra tree, whose 

scientific name is attributed to the Iranian physician and philosopher Avicenna, is a small 

tree – from 3 to 6 meters – with bright green leaves and twigs.  

Besides the mangrove, on the sandy beaches one can see some scattered Acacia and 

Prosopis, and in the shallow coastal waters red and brown algae (Rhodophyceae and 

Phaeophyceae) (Attar et al., 2004). 

The holy fig tree with aerial roots (Ficus Religiosa) is another tourist attraction in the 

Qeshm Geopark.   

 

5.1.6.2.1.  Mangrove Sea Forest 

One of the most unique environments found in nature is the mangrove forest. The  

mangroves forests are the halophyte forests which are distributed alongside the coastal 

zone in tropical and subtropical regions. They are the forests that appear homogeneous 

on the surface, with few land species but enormous aquatic and marine wealth. This eco-

system is found at the junction between land and sea. The principal characteristics of 

mangrove tree species are their high tolerance to salinity. 

Between Qeshm Island Geopark and a part of the coast of Hormozgan Province, there is 

an ecosystem that contains a grey mangrove (Avicennia marina) locally named Harra.  

The mangrove forest of the Qeshm Geopark was designated on the Raamsar conven-

tion's list of international lagoons in 1975 as well as a Biosphere Reserve in 1976 

(UNESCO, 2008). This natural ecosystem is unique amongst mangrove habitats in West 

Asia because of its vast area, and its adaptation to very hot weather and more saline sea 

water (over 40 ppt.).The mangrove zones provide a suitable habitat for invertebrates. The 

Harra sea forest is an important breeding site for migratory birds. 

About the economic potential of the Mangrove Sea forests, this ecosystem performs sev-

eral functions, such as absorbing pollutants; they are places for juvenile stages of  



Chapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study  

233 

organisms to live, soil reclamation forest, forest flood control, and shelter for wildlife.  

Mangrove forests are very important for coastal environments and ecosystems, since they 

can protect the coastline from erosion and rises in sea level. There is a high sedimentation 

rate in these forests so they can build land. Indeed, mangrove forests serve as a buffer 

zones between marine and land ecosystems.  

Beside the ecological aspects, mangrove forest has direct socioeconomic functions such 

as fuel harvesting, timber industry, fish catching, paper materials, and pharmacology, and 

indirect functions such as aquaculture projects like shrimp farming pools (Hossainipour 

Kooveei et al., 2005).  

The sea forest of mangrove of Qeshm Island has great economic potential for fish catch-

ing, charcoal production, cattle fodder, and bee-keeping, among others. Nevertheless, this 

ecosystem is endangered and ought to be legally controlled as an economic activity.  

Besides non-renewable resources, the mangrove forests of Qeshm play an important role 

in ecotourism and recreational activities. For attracting more tourists to Harra forest, forest 

leadership is necessary and the geopark is the key actor to provide some basic infrastruc-

ture.  

Experiences in Togean Islands, Indonesia, have shown that the money spent on these 

infrastructures was compensated by the additional income generated by the tourism  

industry in the area (UNU, 2005). In this regard, the local government of the Qeshm 

Geopark tries to develop infrastructures in the geopark. These enterprises promote socio-

economic activities and well-being of indigenous people with the help of tourism marketing 

and conservation methods in the geopark.  

Qeshm Island Free Zone Organization and geopark have planned to cruise the tourists 

around Harra Sea Forest in local small boats (Farsani et al., 2008). Piers of Tabl and  

Soheili villages were equipped and developed by local administration, receiving passen-

gers and tourists to visit these sites. This project has created some job opportunities for 

locals.  

It is noteworthy that the mangrove sea forest of Qeshm is endangered. The restoration of 

mangrove trees takes a long time. The mangroves take more than 20-30 years to recover 

from severe oil spill impacts (Hoff et al., 2002). Additional impacts such as hurricanes, 

natural or man-made impacts such as harbour infrastructure and industrial development 

like oil refineries, ports, airfields, and shrimp farming pools damage this ecosystem signifi-

cantly.  



Chapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study 

234 

Nowadays, the mangrove forest of Qeshm Geopark is threatened. The first problem is the 

increase of building industry of heavy harbour in Khouran region which is a great menace 

for the survival of Harra forest (Yousefi Azar, 2008). In addition, 80% of the Qeshm 

Geopark population are rural people and suffer from desertification phenomena in this  

region. They enter illegally into the Harra protected area in boats, and break the branches 

of Avicennia marina for charcoal production and use the leaves of Harra for cattle fodder. 

They are not aware that this leads in desertification (Yousefi Azar, 2008).  

The shrimp farming pools established in the mangrove, near the Khouran region, are  

another threat to Harra forest.  

The last but not the least problem is oil pollution from shipping and oil tankers that threat-

ens Khouran Strait mangroves and also diffuses water pollution coming from the nearby 

coastal city of Bandar Abbas (Sebastian Lassen, 2008). 

For the sake of the Harra Sea forest protection, mangroves in Qeshm are under the  

protection of Environmental Protection Office of Hurmozgan province.  

Since 1992 desertification has threatened the Qeshm Island, thus the Natural Recourses 

Department of Hurmozgan province has launched a plant propagation of Avicennia  

marina. Annually many of these species are planted in Harra region especially on 5th 

March - the day of afforestation in Iranian culture. Regarding this, officials of the geopark, 

through encouraging locals in plant propagation of Avicennia marina in mangrove Sea  

forest ecosystem, create supplementary income for locals.   

Furthermore, environmental agencies located in the Qeshm Geopark have agreed on  

preventing the establishing of heavy harbours and traffic of heavy ships near the Harra 

forest, because these transportation activities have undeniable impacts on this ecosystem 

(Hossainipour kooveei et al., 2005).  

In Harra Sea forest, ecotourism can play a role, as a low risk economic activity, in generat-

ing income for the local communities. Hence, officials of the geopark should encourage 

tourists and guides to observe sustainable tourism guidelines in this endangered ecosys-

tem.   

For instance, the boatmen should avoid wake speed; “wake” is a path of disturbed water 

left behind a moving boat; “no wake speed” means there is no “white” water in track or 

path of the boat or the white water created in waves immediately by the boat and in no 

case greater than 10 kilometres per hour. 



Chapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study  

235 

In addition, servicing engines to minimize discharge of pollutants into the environment and 

maximize performance and fuel efficiency is an important sustainable strategy. The last 

but not the least solution is environmental education prior to or during recreational boating 

activities directed by guides or boatmen.  

  

5.1.7.  Cultural Heritage and Sites in Qeshm Geopark 

Qeshm Island in the south of Iran is a very strict traditional region; local people wear tradi-

tional clothes and the local women use henna tattoo designs in marriage ceremonies. The 

local communities also hold traditional annual festivals such as Nowruz Sayyad Festival; 

Nowruz in Persian means new day, and typically refers to the Persian New Year Festival, 

and Sayyad means fisherman.  

In Qeshm Island, the sea and fishing play a major role in people’s livelihood. Nowruz Say-

yad Festival is celebrated at the beginning of the main fishing season in late July; one of 

the most extensive celebrations is held in the Salkh village in south of Qeshm Geopark. At 

this time local fishermen stop fishing, because they believe that the fish should have a 

chance to reproduce.  

Therefore, everyone goes to the sea to bathe and start the new fishing year. Then, they 

wear new clothes and prepare various dishes, which should not contain any fish or  

seafood.  

Other traditions in this festival are the playing of drums by a group of men dressed in 

white, accompanied by another group singing joyful songs whilst moving in harmony with 

the rhythm of the drums. There are also various contests such as rowing and tug-of-war. 

Besides this, two men wear black clothes and play out an interesting theatre (Jadidonline, 

2009).  

It is noteworthy that the Nowruz Festival (the traditional Iranian New Year in the first of 

spring) and religious festivals are other ceremonies held in this Island.  

Aside from traditional festivals, there are many archaeological heritage sites in Qeshm  

Island some of which are located in the geopark territory and some others are out of that.  

As for Qeshm history, since Qeshm has strategic importance, the Portuguese, English, 

and Dutch competed for influence in the region (Potts, 2004).      

Hence, there are some archaeological heritage sites from them such as English and  

Portuguese cemeteries in Qeshm. Portuguese fortresses in Qeshm and Hormuz Islands, 



Chapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study 

236 

which were built during domination of Portuguese on Persian Gulf, are another tourist  

attraction in these islands. Recently, Gulbenkian has set up a project for rebuilding castles 

in Iran, so they are trying to negotiate with Iranian governors (Lucas Coelho, 2009). 

Naderi castle, water reservoirs, pilgrimage sites, and mosques, are other historical sites in 

Qeshm Geopark territory. Moreover, the Giyahdan village with its wind towers and 

mosques is recognized as a historical site for tourists.  

A series of both natural and manmade caves in the heights of a mountain of Qeshm 

Geopark, named “Kharbas Caves”, is another item of cultural heritage in this territory and 

is a symbol of the ancient settlements.   

Furthermore, the architectural facets of the dwellings in the Loft village can be another cul-

tural tourist attraction in this rural area. The main architectural features are the traditional 

air vents or ventilators in various sizes (Appendix 29). The buildings or houses in this  

village are constructed close together and streets are extremely narrow (Nouroozi et al., 

2001). There are 366 well-known wells in the Loft village near the port which are known as 

Tala. It is noteworthy that the numbers of wells are more or less the symbol of the number 

of days in a year (365); in the past the local communities of this village got water from one 

well each day (Appendix 30).  

Regarding cultural sustainability, Qeshm Geopark authorities try not only to organize  

regional festivals and fairs but also, in order to revival local handicrafts, they established 

two handicrafts workrooms in rural areas. Chapter five, part 2 will explain in more detail 

about the role of the establishment of Qeshm Geopark in cultural sustainability.   

 

5.1.8.  Indicators of Sustainable Development for Qeshm Geopark 

Sustainable development indicators can lead to better decisions and more effective  

actions by simplifying, clarifying, and making aggregated information available to policy 

makers. They can help to incorporate physical and social science knowledge into deci-

sion-making; they can also help to measure and to calibrate progress toward sustainable 

development goals. Sustainable development indicators can provide an early warning to 

prevent economic, social, and environmental setbacks. These indicators are important for 

implementation tourism management planning.  

In this study, we used the third edition of the Commission on Sustainable Development 

(CSD) indicators table. The newly revised CSD indicators contain a core set of 50 indica-



Chapter 5-1- Characterization of the Geographical Area of the Case Study  

237 

tors (United Nations, 2007). These core indicators are part of a larger set of 96 indicators 

of sustainable development. 

Some of indicators were not easily available for the Qeshm Geopark; therefore, we  

selected the indicators which were related to tourism and the geopark. Consequently, we 

selected 25 indicators focusing on social, environmental, and economical indexes (Table 

5.1.1).

5.1.9.  SWOT Analysis of Qeshm Geopark Sites 
SWOT analysis describes current conditions and tries to comprise the regional situations 

in terms of Strengths (internal, should be stabilized) Weaknesses (internal, should be  

reduced), Opportunities (external, should be used), and Threats (external, should be 

fought against).  

Based on experienced gained from the literature review of geoparks around the world and 

fieldwork in Qeshm Geopark, SWOT analysis was carried out for geosites, eco-sites and 

cultural sites of  Qeshm Geopark (Figure 5.1. 3).  

A SWOT Analysis is an effective way of analysing a project’s potential by identifying 

Strengths and Weaknesses, and examining Opportunities and Threats which may affect it. 

The SWOT matrices for geological, ecological, cultural, and archaeological heritage are 

presented in Tables (5.1.2 to 5.1.4). 

In this section, the above mentioned analysis was applied to provide key guidelines for 

implementing a sustainable development model in Qeshm Geopark.

5.1.10.  Summary and Conclusions 

Bearing in mind that in the previous chapter geoparks were classified into six categories, 

therefore, in view of the fact that salt diapirs and salt caves, which are rare and unique 

phenomena in the world, had a high degree of importance in creation of Qeshm Geopark 

and development of geotourism in this region, Qeshm Geopark, can be classified in group 

E (cave or karst tourism).  

It is worth mentioning that the longest salt cave in the world is located in Qeshm Geopark 

territory but the results of field trips around the geopark and SWOT matrices as a  

comparison model indicate that there are not enough tourist facilities in 3 Namakdan Salt 

Cave.   

Furthermore, the results of the Sustainable Development (CSD) indicators table illustrate 

that Qeshm Geopark is a sensitive environmental ecosystem with critically endangered 

species; moreover, natural hazards such as earthquake, drought, and Red Tide threaten 

this area.   

Apart from environmental indicators, water supply and unemployment are social problems 

in the villages located in surrounding of the Qeshm Geopark.  It is worth mentioning that 

there is enough bottled water for tourists and visitors in hotels, restaurants and supermar-

kets.  

Besides, the statistical references indicate that crime rate is low in this area and Qeshm 

Geopark is a safe tourism destination.  

In addition, the SWOT matrices make it clear that there are some weaknesses and threats 

that affect the geopark. In 2010, UNESCO issued a Yellow card for Qeshm Geopark; the 

management plan of the Qeshm Geopark was recently submitted to UNESCO and when 

the plan is implemented some weaknesses tend to be overcome. The suggestions which 

are illustrated in the opportunities section of SWOT matrices can be supportive strategies 

for a better management of Qeshm Geopark.  

The next part will focus on findings and results of questionnaires at local level. Since the 

topic is new and the geopark activities haven't been thoroughly studied yet, results of  

analysing questionnaires from geoparks around the world and the local communities of 

Qeshm Geopark can not only discover innovative strategies in geoparks but also can 

evaluate the role of geoparks in rural development.

    249 

5.2.1.  Profile of the Qeshm Geopark  

5.2.1.1.  Introduction 

In this study, Qeshm Geopark, which is located in the south of Iran, in the Persian Gulf, 

was selected as the case study. As mentioned in Chapter 5 part 1, UNESCO has issued a 

yellow card for Qeshm Geopark in 2010; therefore, this geopark has limited time to 

change the future of the geopark. If the geopark authorities can succeed in solving Qeshm 

Geopark’s weakness problems, the geopark will stay as a GGN member.  

The aim of this section is to identify policies and new strategies (innovation) pursued by 

the local government of Qeshm Geopark in achieving the goals of local development.  

Regarding this, two specific objectives were designed as follow:  

• To engage local communities in geotourism and geopark activities 

• To evaluate the role played by tourism in achieving better quality of life for local 

populations and stimulating economic growth 

Data for this part of study were obtained from a questionnaire which was designed for the 

local communities of Qeshm Geopark (19 villages). Interviews in face-to-face format were 

conducted from July to August 2009. 720 (8% of population) questionnaire forms were  

collected after they had been filled in by the chosen respondents (local people) living in 19 

surrounding villages of Qeshm Geopark. Data were analysed using the SPSS software 

and profiled by frequencies, Pearson Chi-Square test, Mean-One Sample T test, and  

Independent Samples Test.  

This chapter starts with sociocultural impacts of tourism in Qeshm Geopark, followed by  

socioeconomic impacts of the creation of Qeshm Geopark, socio-environmental impacts 

of Qeshm Geopark in rural areas, educational activities in this territory, and ends with  

innovative activities in Qeshm Geopark and a conclusion.  

 

5.2.1.2.  Socio-Demographic Characteristics of the Local Communities 

Questionnaires were administered in nineteen villages located in the Qeshm Geopark  

territory. As shown in Table 5.2.1, the majority of responses were obtained in Tabl village 

(18.1%), many were also collected in other villages (like Giyahdan (13.5 %), Shibderaz, 

and Salakh (both 8.2%), Sar Rig (7.9 %) and Berke Khalaf (7.6%).

The sample shows that the majority of local communities are involved in activities such as 

fishing (29%) and business (16%). Our results also illustrated that unemployment is a  

socioeconomic problem in the local communities of the surrounding villages of the Qeshm 

Geopark. It is worth mentioning that the unemployment rate of females (n= 112) in rural 

areas of the geopark territory is much higher than the males.   

 

5.2.1. 3.  Sociocultural Impacts of Tourism in the Qeshm Geopark 

Nowadays, the urbanization rate has increased and in urban communities, traditional  

patterns are not efficient within this lifestyle. In Iran, as in other countries, urbanization has 

increased, while Qeshm Island is one of the Iranian societies where its traditional culture 

and lifestyle are interweaved and it was a key component for UNESCO to establish the 

first Iranian and Middle East Geopark in this Island.   



Chapter 5-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at Local Level (Case Study) 

252 

Zamani-Farahani and Henderson (2010) noted that in societies such as Iran and Saudi 

Arabia where religion and politics are interweaved; development of tourism is not the 

same as other countries. In these countries Islam is all pervasive in societies and Sharia 

law may govern much of what is considered acceptable (Halal) regarding leisure. Laws 

prohibit public displays of affection, shaking hands or any physical contact between  

members of the opposite sex, unmarried couples sharing rooms, gambling, breaking fast 

in daylight during Ramadan, consumption of pork and other forbidden food, selling or 

drinking liquor and dressing inappropriately. Both sexes must cover their torso and upper 

legs at all times and only women’s faces may be exposed (Deng et al., 1994). Frequenting  

discotheques and bars and miscellaneous other entertainments are deemed unlawful. 

Men and women may be segregated at events and sites such as pools and beach.  

It seems that a state religion can be a serious barrier for the development of tourism  

marketing, but the verses of the Quran cited below from the chapters named in brackets  

endorse travelling with a view to achieving spiritual, physical and social goals. Al-Imran 

(The Amramites): 137; Al-An’am (Livestock): 11; Al-Nahl (The Bee): 36; Al-Naml (The 

Ant): 69; Al-’Ankaboot (The Spider): 20; Al-Room (The Romans): 42/9; Saba’ (Sheba): 18; 

Yousuf (Joseph): 109; Al-Hajj (The Pilgrimage): 46; Faater (Initiator): 44; Ghafer (For-

giver): 82/21; Muhammad: 10; Younus (Jonah): 22; and Al-Mulk (Kingship): 15’ (Pickthall, 

1976; Yusuf Ali, 2005). The lessons are that more complete submission to God is possible 

through seeing the beauty and bounty of His creation. Travel can enhance health and well 

being, reducing stress and enabling Muslims to know God better (Zamani-Farahani and 

Henderson, 2010). Moreover, Hajj to Mecca is one of the principles of Islam, requiring 

Muslims to make the journey at least once in their lifetime unless prevented by physical 

incapacity (Rowley, 1997).  

To have sustainable tourism development in Iran, it is crucial that the local socio-political 

and cultural context is never underestimated. Iran as a Muslim country has strict codes of 

social contact and some traditional and religious prohibitions that should be respected 

(Faghri, 2008).  

To this end, tourists should be informed about local customs, acceptable social behav-

iours, etc. by means of advertisement. Visitors can be educated through introducing local 

cultural values, providing cultural guidelines, and presenting briefings about appropriate 

behaviour.   



Chapter 5-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at Local Level (Case Study) 

    253 

Moreover, in Iran there are many local accents, local dialects and languages (Persian, 

Turkey, Kurdish, Armenian, and Arabic etc.) and the people who live in those territories 

have particular traditional clothes and folk music.  

Thus, for development of tourism marketing in Iran not only the international tourists 

should not violate to the host customs but also the domestic tourists should respect tradi-

tional culture. Since, geotourism can be the best practice tourism that sustains, or even 

enhances, the geographical character of a place, such as its culture, environment,  

heritage, and the well-being of its residents and owing to religious and cultural barriers, 

Iran should pay particular attention to the development and promotion of geotourism as a 

branch of sustainable tourism in its tourism strategy.  

This section emphasises the role of the establishment of the Qeshm Geopark on the 

minimization of the negative sociocultural impacts of tourism in rural areas. Accordingly, 

the following hypothesis was built to examine this role of the Qeshm Geopark.  

• H8: Geoparks contribute to minimizing the negative sociocultural impacts of  

tourism perceived by local communities  

o sub-hypothesis: Men more than the women, who live in the surrounding  

villages of the Qeshm Geopark, think that tourism has a negative social  

impact on their community 

 

A brief description of cultural components in the surrounding villages of the Qeshm 

Geopark helps us to gain a better understanding of local customs and traditions in this  

territory. The official language in Qeshm is Persian but the local people speak the Pahlavi 

dialect, as a branch of the primary Persian language. Qeshm is a free trade Island and its 

economy is heavily dependent on trade and such economic activities between local  

communities of the island, Arabic countries and India are aided by the local people of 

Qeshm learning Arabic and Indian languages.   

The majority of people who live in Qeshm are Muslims but they are Sunni, so they are 

classified as a religious minority in Iran. Very few Christians and Zoroastrians live in this 

area as well.  

Qeshm Island is a very strict traditional region; local people wear traditional clothes and 

the local women use henna tattoo designs in marriage celebrations. Traditional clothing is 

a tourist attraction in this Island; the women of Qeshm wear beautiful and colourful tradi-

tional clothes. When they venture out into public, they use a special cover, which is called 

“Bourke”, designed in different sizes. Some are big and wide enough to cover the whole 



Chapter 5-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at Local Level (Case Study) 

254 

face and have only two holes over the eyes. Others are narrow and they only cover part of 

the eyes and eyebrows. In addition, ladies cover their heads with a thin cloth, called 

“Jelopol”, on which they wear a chador or veil. Their blouses are also special. Trousers 

are interesting as well; they are made of thick cloth. The upper parts of the pants are loose 

and the bottom part is tight.  

The men, like other southern parts of the country, wear a long, white or colourful shirt,  

locally called “Jimeh”. The long shirt covers them from shoulder to ankle. They are free to 

let you move around and it is suitable for the southern parts because the weather in the 

south of Iran is warm and humid. Some people wear a hat with holes in it called “Aragh-

chin”. 

The local ladies of Qeshm cook a variety of food with fish, shrimp, crab, oyster, meat, 

dates, flour, oil, sugar, cereal, and rice. We can name fish kebab, Kolomba, Zebon, 

Moflak, Haware, Ankas, Dishow, Poodane, Motabak, Katog-hala, Malook, Palshk,  

Matoota, Momaga, and Singow as local food on the island.  

The above mentioned factors indicate which people are compatible with local customs in 

this territory; therefore, for developing tourism, officials should pay particular attention to 

sociocultural impacts of tourism on the local community. 

In this regard, a questionnaire was designed for the purpose of achieving the research  

objectives. The questions in the questionnaire were chosen according to the main criteria 

that should be considered when one tries to measure the impact of the development of 

tourism and its effect on the standard of living of local people as it is extracted from tour-

ism studies and leisure literature. There were 720 questionnaire forms that were recol-

lected after they had been filled in by the chosen respondents in the Qeshm Geopark. 

Descriptive statistic analysis was used to measure the sociocultural impact of the devel-

opment of tourism on the local community of the geopark. 

Based on the results, local people have positive attitudes towards the development of 

tourism in the geopark, and 91.9% of respondents were open to accepting an expansion 

of tourist marketing in their area. But they (54.9%) believe that there are some negative 

sociocultural impacts of the development of tourism on local communities in Qeshm 

Geopark (Table 5.2.3). Respondents mentioned the following negative sociocultural  

impacts on Qeshm Geopark though the development of tourism:  

• Demise of the local language  

• Increase in inflation rate 



Chapter 5-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at Local Level (Case Study) 

    255 

• Vanishing local customs and traditional way of life, with local clothes taken as an 

example (Appendix 40) 

• Increased tendency towards urban lifestyle 

• Propagation of unveiling 

• Vanishing religious customs

The result of the chi-square test (Sig. (2-sided) = .000) illustrates that there is a relation 

between two variables (gender and negative impact of tourism on the town/village  

socially). These results indicate that the majority of men (62.9%), more than women, who 

live in the surrounding villages of the Qeshm Geopark, think that tourism has a negative 

impact on their community (Table 5.2.4, 5.2.5). 

Aside from the negative sociocultural impacts of tourism in this area, locals of the geopark 

introduced some positive socioeconomic impacts of tourism which appeared through 

geopark activities in this area such as local festivals, seafood festivals, supplementary in-

come, cultural exchange, establishing two handicraft workrooms for women (needlework), 

seasonal and part time job opportunities and entrepreneurship, especially for women.   

According to the field observation around the rural areas of Qeshm Geopark, plus results 

from questionnaires filled by officials and interviews with the manager of the geopark, 

there are strategies which Qeshm Geopark, under the supervision of Qeshm Island Free 

Zone organization with the help of UNDP (United Nations Development Programme) office 

in Tehran, Avaye Tabiat Company and Environment Department, have applied for cultural 

sustainability: establishing the Geopark museums, which include a collection of local 

clothes, artefacts and local musical instruments; publishing books about architecture  of 



Chapter 5-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at Local Level (Case Study) 

256 

Qeshm (especially Laft village), and some photograph albums about local culture 

in  Qeshm; organizing workshops to design henna tattoos for tourists in villages of Qeshm 

Geopark; holding summer festivals and regional festivals (such as Nowruz Sayyad and 

sea food as explained in chapter 5 part 1); and participation of local women in National 

and International handicrafts exhibitions and fairs.  

It is worth mentioning that designing a geopark calendar for events of Qeshm Geopark by 

the author of this thesis was another strategy for the preservation of cultural components 

in this territory (Appendix 41).  

Consequently, the establishment of Qeshm Geopark can be a gateway for cultural  

sustainability in rural areas of Qeshm Geopark.

5.2.1.4.  Socioeconomic Impacts of the Establishment of Qeshm Geopark 

The purpose of this section is to investigate the effects of the establishment of Qeshm 

Geopark on development of the local economy through geotourism and involvement of 

local communities in geopark activities. This part also presents a summary of work being 

carried out in Qeshm Geopark for entrepreneurship, creation of new supplementary  

income and job opportunities in rural areas.   

Regarding this, the following hypotheses were built and tested:   

• H3: Geotourism activities in geoparks create opportunities for local development  

• H4: Using geotourism can be a useful strategy for developing tourism in geoparks 

• H7: Geoparks contribute towards increasing geological knowledge and employ-

ment of local communities in rural areas and geopark territories 

 H Null= Salary of local communities involved in geopark activities is equiva-

lent to National Minimum Wage (NMW) rate (per month):  M1=207 € (2009) 

 First sub-hypothesis for H7: Salary of local communities involved in 
geopark activities is not equivalent to National Minimum Wage (NMW) rate 

(per month):  M1?207 € (2009) 

 H Null= Men and women earn equal revenue from geopark activities:   

M Men = M Women 

 Second sub-hypothesis for H7: Men earn more revenue from geopark 
activities: M Men ? M Women

258 

Results of statistical analyses of questionnaires are shown in Table 5.2.6.; Results  

indicate that unemployment is a socioeconomic problem in the surrounding villages of 

Qeshm Geopark. As Qeshm is a free trade Island and is located in Persian Gulf, the local 

economy of this area is heavily dependent on fishery and business activity. Therefore, 

many passengers with a view to trade travel to this island annually. It is evident that,  

because of the climate limitations tourists prefer to travel to Qeshm from October to April. 

Thus, seasonal unemployment and mass tourism are consequences of the climatic condi-

tions on this Island.    

The majority (82.8%) of responders (local communities living in the surrounding villages of 

Qeshm Geopark) believe that geotourism has a positive impact on the local economy and 

91.9% of them desire to see an expansion of tourism marketing in Qeshm Geopark. Thus, 

most respondents welcomed the Qeshm Geopark concept and were happy to be part of 

the geopark. 

Since 2001, officials of the environment department and Qeshm Island free zone organi-

zation with the help of UNDP (United Nations Development Programme) have tried to  

involve local communities in conservation activities and tourism marketing. This strategy 

has not only reduced unemployment and provided supplementary income for locals but 

has also helped the local government impart indigenous knowledge.  

Beside this, Qeshm free zone organization, with the purpose of sustainable development, 

has proceeded to identify, register, and maintain the natural, geological, historical, and 

cultural heritage on Qeshm Island. Finally, Qeshm Geopark was registered in the United 

Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 2006; establishing 

Qeshm Geopark was expedient in attracting tourists to this area.

It is noteworthy that the geopark is a new concept in Iran and most of the people living in 

Qeshm Geopark territory are not familiar with term geopark or its targets. However, the 

majority (50.6%) of responders recognize the geopark as an opportunity for socioeco-

nomic development in their area, particularly those involved in tourism-based activities, i.e. 

boatmen, family guest houses owners, tour guides and souvenir shop owners.  

Samples illustrate that Qeshm Geopark only benefits locals in 5 villages among 19  

villages located in the geopark territory. Qeshm Geopark authorities attempt to create new 

job opportunities and up to now they have succeeded in providing some seasonal and 

part-time jobs for the local people of these villages (Berke khalaf, Shibderaz, Tabl, Salakh, 

and Chahu Sharghi) (Figure 5.2.1).

Shibderaz with 38% (Table 5.2.7) of locals involved in tourism and conservation activities 

is a pioneer in local development. Managing family guest houses, organizing tour leaders 

for wildlife watching (especially marine turtles), providing turtle watching tours, acting as 

guards, and selling souvenirs are job opportunities and jobs associated with tourism which 

appeared through creation of the geopark and development of geotourism in this village.  

Moreover, in spring which is the season of nesting and laying eggs of Hawksbill Turtles 

locals of Shibderaz cooperate in collecting and protecting eggs and finally, they return the 

baby turtles to their natural habitat into the Persian Gulf. Meanwhile, this conservation

    261 

activity not only preserves the marine turtles, but also provides supplementary income and 

seasonal jobs for local people of the Shibderaz.  

Creating part time jobs for women is another geopark enterprise in Shibderaz and Berke 

khalaf village. Geopark officials with the help of UNDP/SGP established two handicraft 

workrooms (needlework) in these villages but the local women of Shibderaz requested the 

establishment of a fixed souvenir shop in the village.  

Organizing mangrove tours around the mangrove sea forest in small boats in Tabl village 

and establishing a family guest house in this village are other geopark enterprises. The 

statistical analyses of samples indicate that these activities create 5% of job opportunities 

in this site of Qeshm Geopark (Table 5.2.7).  

In addition, holding regional festivals and seafood festivals in rural areas such as Salakh 

village is another strategy to attract tourists to these rural areas.  

It is worth mentioning that working as guards for geological sites and guides in the 

geopark museum are other full time jobs which directly emerge through geopark activities. 

Aside from direct job opportunities, geopark and geotourism development embrace  

indirect activities associated with tourism such as accommodation, local transportation, 

local restaurants, and services.

Question number thirteen (Q13: How much is your salary from involvement in geopark  

activities? - Per month) was designed to test the following sub- hypothesis.  

 H Null= Salary of local communities involved in geopark activities is  

equivalent to National Minimum Wage (NMW) rate (per month):  M1=207 € 

(2009) 



Chapter 5-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at Local Level (Case Study) 

    263 

 First sub-hypothesis for H7: Salary of local communities involved in 
geopark activities is not equivalent to National Minimum Wage (NMW) rate 

(per month):  M1?207 € (2009) 

228 respondents replied to this question (Table 5.2.8). Since the government determined 

National Minimum Wage rate in rural areas as equivalent to 207 € per month in 2009, the 

test value is therefore 207 €. The data was analysed using a one-sample t-test which 

compares the mean score of a sample to a known value.  

Based on the result of the test, the monthly revenue of local communities involved in 

Qeshm Geopark activities is less than  207 €  (Table 5.2.9) Thus, it can be said that the 

null hypothesis is rejected and the first sub-hypothesis is confirmed.

Bear in mind that 228 respondents (N= 228 persons) replied to this question. We draw 

attention to the fact that the majority of local communities are involved in geopark activities 

in the form of seasonal (n=127 persons) or part-time (n= 86 persons) work.  

According to field trip observation around Qeshm Geopark, some local women in rural ar-

eas of Qeshm Geopark are engaged in handicraft workrooms, room rentals, and activities 

such as designing henna tattoos for visitors, and doing aquaculture of pearls, while the 

local men are employed as boatman around the Harra sea forest, marine turtle watching 

guides, marine turtle guards, geosite surveillance, etc.  

The independent samples t-test (Table 5.2.10) was used to test the second  

sub-hypothesis of the seventh hypothesis.  

 H Null= Men and women earn equal revenue from the geopark activities:   

M Men = M Women (2009) 

 Second sub-hypothesis for H7: Men earn more revenue from geopark 
activities: M Men ? M Women  (2009) 

 



Chapter 5-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at Local Level (Case Study) 

    265 

The results indicated that the wages of the local men from geopark activity is more than 

the local women. Therefore, the null hypothesis is rejected and the results of the inde-

pendent samples t- test can help to confirm the second sub- hypothesis.  

Consequently, authorities of Qeshm Geopark try to encourage local communities to  

participate in geopark activities, particularly conservation activities and tourism in the form 

of geotourism and ecotourism. Involving local in these kinds of activities can create some 

job opportunities for them. But results illustrated that the majority of these job opportunities 

are in the form of part-time and seasonal work. Thus, it can be said that the establishment 

of Qeshm Geopark can help to create supplementary income for locals who live in rural 

areas of Qeshm Geopark. However, Qeshm Geopark is an early stage of its activity and 

they concentrate only on 5 villages among 19 villages located in the geopark territory. It is 

worth mentioning that some villages such as Shibderaz village and Berke khalaf village 

which are active in development of geotourism, are known as geopark sites but are  

located outside the Qeshm Geopark border and we suggest that for submitting a new  

application dossier to UNESCO, authorities should change the border of the geopark  

territory.

5.2.1. 5.  Socio-Environmental Impacts of the Establishment of Qeshm Geopark  

As mentioned in the literature review chapter, conservation of geological and natural  

heritage is one of the triple targets of the establishment of geosites and geoparks.  

The primary purpose of this section is to identify the effect of the establishment of Qeshm 

Geopark on preservation of natural resources and landscapes. Regarding this I present a 

summary of work being carried out in geopark territory. We also designed three questions 

in order to test the following hypotheses:  

• H1: Geoparks involve local communities in conservation activities 

• H2: Geoparks have positive socio-environmental impacts on local communities   

The development of tourism marketing may have a negative impact on the local environ-

ment and landscape of rural areas located in Qeshm Geopark territory. As illustrated in 

Table 5.2.11, the first question investigates whether the local community believe that tour-

ism marketing has a negative impact on their environment or not. The second question 

inquires which local organisation or community encourages local communities to protect 

natural (geo and bio) heritage. In addition, the third question evaluates the environmental 

benefits resulting from the establishment of Qeshm Geopark in rural areas. The samples 

(720 questionnaires) were analysed by the descriptive analysis method via SPSS tool.

Results illustrate that the majority of local people (51%) believe that tourism has a nega-

tive impacts on their local environment. Respondents mentioned the following negative  

impacts affected the Qeshm Geopark though development of tourism:  

• Producing solid waste in coastal areas 

• A negative impact on the landscape especially in Spring (tourism season picks up) 

such as camping  

• Producing noise pollution 

• Moving lights (torch lights and other illumination used by tourists) scares nesting 

turtles  

• Breaking off stalactites by tourists as souvenirs in Namakdan Salt Caves 

• Writing mementos on the stones of Chahkooh site  

• Reducing fresh water  

• Using camera flash by tourists in turtle sites (flash photography of nesting turtles is 

illegal in some places)  

It is noteworthy that the majority of respondents (54.4%) introduced some environmental 

benefits in their territory that appeared through establishment of Qeshm Geopark. For  

instance, installing rubbish-bins and signposts in villages, involving locals in conservation 

activities and tourism marketing (local guardians for preserving turtles, collecting rubbish 

in coastal areas, local tour guides for turtle watching and plant propagation) are enter-

prises which not only create  seasonal job opportunities and supplementary income for 

indigenous people but also preserve the landscape and environment.   

Consequently, it is evident that the establishment of Qeshm Geopark can help to minimize 

the negative environmental impacts. And also the results can help to confirm the first and 

the second hypotheses.   

According to responses and field trip observations, the Qeshm free zone organization, the 

environment department, the office of tourism deputy, geopark, the UNDP office in  

Tehran, NGOs, and private sectors such as the Avaye Tabiat Company try to involve local 

communities in geopark conservation activities. But results indicate that significant num-

bers (45%) of locals have no information about the above mentioned activities such as the 

new terms of ‘geopark’ and ‘geotourism’; a lack of comprehensive educational programs 



Chapter 5-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at Local Level (Case Study) 

    269 

has also made the local people of Qeshm Geopark unaware of geopark activities and its 

targets.  

Thereby, education as a geopark target plays an important role in awareness of locals. In 

the next section I concentrate on educational activities in the Qeshm Geopark.  

 

5.2.1.6.  Educational Activities in Qeshm Geopark 

Existing geoparks organize a whole spectrum of educational activities for both visitors and 

local adults and schoolchildren. This section discusses the educational activities in the 

Qeshm Geopark, and also tries to test the following hypothesis:  

• H7: Geoparks contribute to increasing the geological knowledge and employment 

of local communities in rural areas and geopark territories 

The purpose of this section is to explore local community understanding of Qeshm 

Geopark and its meaning to their everyday lives. 67% of respondents said they had no 

understanding of the geopark concept and its activities (Figure 5.2.2). These local respon-

dents could not relate the geopark concept to their everyday lives. 

 

Figure 5.2.2: Percentage of respondents to the question  

(Do you know what a geopark is?) 

 



Chapter 5-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at Local Level (Case Study) 

270 

Based on the results of analyses, the majority (75%) of the local respondents know that 

Qeshm is a geopark (Figure 5.2.3). But when asked what first came to their mind about 

the meaning of geopark, most of the respondents answered ‘rocks and rock formations’. 

When asked to identify where the Qeshm Geopark is, most of them identified the valley of 

Stars – located near the Berkeh khalaf village – placed on the face of the rock landscape.  

 

Figure 5.2.3 - Percentage of respondents to the question 

(Do you know that Qeshm is a geopark?) 

 

The results of questionnaires and literature indicate that the Qeshm Geopark (Iran) is the 

only geopark which has a weak operation on educational programs for local schoolchil-

dren and local communities. Qeshm has centred all its educational activities on geopark 

museums and publications.  

It is worth mentioning that recently authorities of Qeshm Geopark organized some meet-

ings about cooperation between Qeshm Global Geopark and schools of Shahab region 

located in the geopark territory. Furthermore, they organized field trips and a festival titled 

“School Bell Ringing for Geopark” for schoolchildren.  

Regarding educational activity, Qeshm Geopark Museum opened in 2005. The purpose of 

the museum and archives is to collect, preserve, make available for research, and exhibit 

documents and artefacts that will serve to illustrate the local history and culture. This  

includes a collection of taxidermy of native and migratory birds, creepers, mammals, 

fishes, and insects of Qeshm Geopark. Also fossils of corals and bivalves of the geopark 



Chapter 5-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at Local Level (Case Study) 

    271 

are exhibited in the museum.  Unfortunately, the Geopark Museum is located outside the 

border of the geopark.   

In addition, interpretation packages are available for visitors, tourists, and researchers 

such as the geotourism Atlas of Qeshm, Birds Atlas of Qeshm, handbook of Harra  

community, map of Qeshm, and Qeshm geology books.  

Moreover, toys based on geopark elements such as a turtle puzzle (the symbol of  

Shibderaz village), allocating parts of geopark museum to educational activities for kids 

and students, a geopark landscape painting exhibition for students and kids, fieldtrips to 

the geopark, sand sculpture festivals with a geopark theme in coastal areas, educational  

programs and field trips for teachers and earthquake manoeuvres for students and kids 

can be useful enterprises to increase local public knowledge about geology and the 

geopark.  

Furthermore, adding a chapter about Qeshm Geopark and its targets in geology and  

geography books of primary, secondary and high schools can be a good strategy for  

introducing the Qeshm Geopark and its targets.  

Recently, Qeshm Geopark authorities attempted to organize workshops on geopark activi-

ties for local business people and government. Moreover, authorities of Qeshm Geopark 

support master and PhD theses related to geopark activities.    

At present workshops are not managed by local communities of geopark territory and only 

a few persons are involved in Qeshm Geopark museum as leaders. Thus, it can be said 

that Qeshm Geopark does not have the dynamic as other geoparks in the contribution to 

increase the geological knowledge and employment of local communities in workshops 

and schools.  

 

5.2.2.  Summary and Conclusions 

On the basis of the results of data analyses, field trip observation and literature review in 

chapter 5 part 1 and chapter 2, it can be concluded that Qeshm Geopark, as the first 

geopark in the Middle East, can play a role in the development of geotourism marketing 

and local economy in rural areas of its territory. And the results support the expectations 

of the establishment of a geopark in rural areas.  

Besides, the results of descriptive analysis in the Qeshm Geopark as a case study illus-

trate that the majority of local people (51%) believe that tourism has a negative impact on 



Chapter 5-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at Local Level (Case Study) 

272 

the local environment, but 54.4% of local respondents mentioned that creation of the 

geopark has some environmental benefits in their territory. For instance, installing rubbish-

bins, and signposts in villages, involving locals in conservation activities, and tourism  

(local guardians for preserving turtles, garbage collectors in  coastal areas, local tour 

guides for turtle watching and plant propagation are enterprises which not only provide 

seasonal and part-time job opportunities and supplementary income for indigenous people 

but also preserve the landscapes and the environment).  

Responses indicate that local communities of Qeshm Geopark have positive attitudes  

towards development of tourism in their territory; 91.9% of respondents mentioned that 

they are interested in expanding the tourist industry in their area. But they believe that 

there are some negative sociocultural impacts of tourism development on local communi-

ties in the Qeshm Geopark such as the demise of the local language; vanishing local cus-

toms, and traditional way of life, taking as example local clothes.  

Apart from negative sociocultural impacts of tourism in this area, locals of the Qeshm 

Geopark introduced some positive tourism socioeconomic impacts which appeared 

through geopark activities in this area such as regional festivals, a seafood festival, sup-

plementary income, cultural exchange, seasonal and part-time jobs, and entrepreneurship 

for women. Consequently, geotourism can also contribute significantly to cultural preser-

vation. This indicates that geoparks as pioneers in geotourism development can be  

considered as a sustainable base for the development of tourism.   

Engaging local communities in tourism sectors such as mangrove tours, turtle sites, 

handicraft workrooms (needle work), and local accommodation, officials of Qeshm 

Geopark created second job opportunities or supplementary income for locals.   

Unfortunately, Qeshm Geopark has a weak operation in educational programs for the  

local schoolchildren, and has concentrated its educational activities just on the geopark 

museum, publications, some schools and graduate student theses. 

As mentioned before, in 2010, UNESCO issued a yellow card for Qeshm Geopark; there-

fore, authorities should solve the weakness problems of geopark. According to interviews 

with geopark authorities and field trips around the Qeshm Geopark territories, some of the 

weakness problems are pointed out as follows:  

1. Weakness problem in neighbourhood boundary of Qeshm Geopark. Since the 

Qeshm Geopark was established in 2006, and at that time the geopark and geot-

ourism were not studied thoroughly yet and geopark authorities were not familiar 



Chapter 5-2- Findings of the Empirical Study at Local Level (Case Study) 

    273 

with these new concepts, the neighbourhood boundary of Qeshm Geopark has 

some weaknesses. For instance, some important sites such as the Valley of Stars 

and the Laft village are located outside the geopark territory.  

2. A weakness problem in the dossier of Qeshm Geopark. Geopark authorities 

should rewrite a new dossier with emphasis on geopark activities regarding the  

local development, conservation and education, beside the aesthetic appeals.    

3. Determinants of a budget deficit in Qeshm Geopark for implementation of the 

geopark plan. As mentioned before, the geopark is under the supervision of 

Qeshm Free Zone Organization. Unfortunately the managers of this organization 

misunderstood geopark activity and they think that the geopark concept only  

includes geological heritage. Therefore, they did not support the geopark in the  

financial cases appropriately.  

4. Lack of network activities in management of the geopark. 

5. Management of Qeshm Free Zone Organization is weak from the nature conserva-

tion viewpoint. Allocation of some unique coasts and islands to petroleum  

companies is an example in this regard.  

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

CHAPTER 6- Conclusions and 
Implications 



Chapter 6 - Conclusions and Implications 

275 

6.1.  Introduction 

This thesis aims to understand the role of the establishment of geoparks in rural 

development. Moreover, this thesis tries to propose new tourism destination choices which 

would improve understanding of earth sciences such as geology, geomorphology 

geodiversity, and geography.   

This chapter presents the major conclusions of the thesis, discusses limitations, 

contributions and managerial implications of the study. Specific suggestions for Qeshm 

Geopark are also discussed for the development and marketing of geotourism in this area.  

It proceeds with recommendations that may provide suggestions for future research.  

 

6.2.  Main Conclusion 

According to National geographic (2005), geotourism is a sustainable strategy. Moreover, 

the Lanzarote Charter for Sustainable Tourism (1995) defined 18 principles for 

sustainability. In recent decades, geoparks as new model of sustainable development in 

protected areas through geotourism strive to promote local economy especially in rural 

areas (UNESCO, 2006b; Zouros, 2004; Zouros, and Mckeever, 2009). Nevertheless, none 

of the research works have considered the novel and innovative strategies applied in 

geoparks for sustainable development. Innovation plays an important role for sustainable 

competitiveness and idea generation in research; and development is an essential part of 

it. However, in the present study the idea of building hypotheses and objectives raised 

from literature reviews.  

In this study I try to introduce geoparks as an innovation in tourist destination and consider 

innovative strategies to improve the local economy of geoparks as environmentally 

sensitive areas. The main objective of the study presented in this thesis is a contribution to 

sustainable tourism in geoparks. Since development of local economy is a target of 

sustainable tourism, I attempt to ascertain the effects of creation of geoparks on 

sustainable tourism and local economy. Moreover, this thesis explores the effect of 

establishment of geoparks on participation of local communities in geotourism marketing 

and geopark activities. The research at international level was conducted with electronic 

questionnaires which were sent to all geoparks, along with the questionnaires filled by 

geoparks officials who participated in the 8th European Geoparks Conference, Naturtejo 

Geopark, Portugal 2009. As there are countries with more than one geopark such as 



Chapter 6 - Conclusions and implications 

276 

Japan (it has established a network of national geoparks), just one or two geoparks 

replied to us as a representative of all the others.  

Results substantiate the importance of geoparks in employing locals in the management 

structure and in promoting local businesses such as geotourism marketing and production 

local products.  

Since we selected Qeshm Geopark as a case study at local level, another questionnaire 

was designed for the local communities of Qeshm Geopark villages. 

The literature review was an essential step to progress in the research. It focused mainly 

on geotourism, geoparks and the concepts related to them. The literature review (chapter 

2) introduced a geopark as an area with interesting geological features or phenomena to 

be protected and to be used for educational, scientific, or touristic purposes. Besides, 

geoparks create opportunities for local economic development. It is noteworthy that in 

comparison with protected areas a geopark has more subtle connections with the local 

social and cultural life, offering a wider range of activities such as local festivals, fairs, 

local art workshops, conferences, and educational programs.  

Since, the majority of geoparks are located in rural areas, geoparks and geotourism can 

be opportunities for cultural sustainability and rural development; they also try to reduce 

the rate of unemployment and emigration through engaging local communities in geopark 

activities.  

Geopark authorities attempt to improve the local economy through geotourism, education, 

conservation activities, and innovative strategies.  

Chapter 3 examined the methodology used for research study. Chapter 4, part 1 reviewed 

characterization of areas where the empirical study were conducted and addressed the 

unique geological heritage sites in each geopark as geotourism destinations. In addition, 

chapter 4, part 1 provided an overview of innovative strategies in geoparks.  

Chapter 5, part 1 refers to the characterization of the geographical area of the Qeshm 

Geopark as a case study. This chapter summarized the geological, ecological, and 

cultural heritage sites in the Qeshm Geopark. Moreover, indicators of sustainable 

development for Qeshm Geopark were determined. Since, after the first revalidation a 

yellow card was issued for Qeshm Geopark by UNESCO, section 5.1.6 in chapter 5 

focused on designing three SWOT matrices regarding better management of geosites, 

ecological sites and cultural and archaeological heritage sites in Qeshm Geopark.  



Chapter 6 - Conclusions and Implications 

277 

It’s worth mentioning that comments mentioned in the SWOT matrices were suggested 

according to experiences derived from innovation and novel strategies in other geoparks 

around the world registered in UNESCO Global Geoparks Network.   

Chapter 4, part 2 and Chapter 5, part 2 deal with findings of the empirical study at 

international level (geoparks registered in UNESCO Global Geoparks Network), and at 

local level (Qeshm Geopark).  

On the basis of the results of descriptive analyses of questionnaires, geopark authorities 

have taken some positive policies stimulating locals in participating in activities leading to 

prosperity of the local economy and preservation of natural resources: 

Firstly, geopark authorities try to involve locals in conservation activities; results illustrate 

that the creation of a geopark in each territory engages an average of about 11 persons in 

geopark conservation activities in form of voluntary, supplementary income, part-time, full-

time ,seasonal, and second jobs (Mean= 10.53, SD= 14.78). 

Moreover, results indicate that the majority (83%) of geopark authorities believe that 

conservation activities improve the local economy in their territory; for instance, geoparks 

employ the local communities in preservation activities such as park guards, site 

surveillance, and projects. 

Besides, results of descriptive analysis in the case study, the Qeshm Geopark, illustrate 

that the majority of local people (51%) believe that tourism has negative impact on the 

local environment; however, 54.4% of local respondents mentioned that the creation of 

geopark has some environmental benefits in their territory. For instance, installing rubbish 

bins, and signposts in villages, involving locals in conservation activities, and tourism 

(local guardians for preserving turtles, garbage collectors in coastal areas, local tour 

guides for turtle watching and plant propagation are enterprises which not only provide 

seasonal job opportunities and supplementary income for indigenous people but also 

preserve the landscapes and the environment). The above results can confirm these 

hypotheses (H1: Geoparks involve local communities in conservation activities, H2: 

Geoparks have positive socio-environmental impacts on local communities, and H7: 

Geoparks contribute towards increasing geological knowledge and employment of local 

communities in rural areas and geopark territories).  

Accordingly, there is an interaction between local socioeconomic development and 

conservation of the natural environment of the geopark.  



Chapter 6 - Conclusions and implications 

278 

Aside from conservation activities, in the second strategy, geoparks – through promoting 

geotourism in their territory – strive to revive traditional culture and minimize the negative 

cultural impacts of tourism.  

For sociocultural sustainable development, geoparks hold local workshops, festivals, fairs, 

and educational programs. Moreover, geoparks through innovative strategies try to 

introduce the locals’ traditional skills to tourists. For example, geo-products which are 

made based on geological elements of the geoparks not only introduce the local products 

and the local handicrafts to visitors, but increase the public knowledge of visitors about 

geology and geomorphology. Thus, geotourism allows tourists and visitors to travel in their 

territory in order to get experience, learn from and enjoy earth heritage.  

Based on the results of the descriptive analysis, the establishment of a geopark can be a 

way to promote regional food and craft businesses as cultural components in rural areas; 

the majority of respondents (80.0%) mentioned that the creation of geoparks can play a 

role in promoting local cuisine, products, and handicrafts as cultural components.  

Findings also demonstrate that geoparks attempt to revive traditional food, local arts, and 

traditional culture through exposing them to tourists; thereby, geoparks, by promoting 

geotourism and innovative strategies can reduce the negative sociocultural impacts of 

tourism in their territory.  

Responses indicate that the local people of Qeshm Geopark have positive attitudes 

towards tourism development in their territory, and 91.9% of respondents illustrated 

interest in expanding the tourist industry in their area. But they believe that there are some 

negative sociocultural impacts of tourism development on local communities in the Qeshm 

Geopark such as the demise of the local language, vanishing of local customs and 

traditional way of life, taking as an example the local clothes.  

Apart from negative sociocultural impacts of tourism in this area, locals of the Qeshm 

Geopark introduced some positive socioeconomic impacts of tourism which appeared 

through geopark activities in this area such as regional festivals, seafood festivals, 

supplementary income, cultural exchange, seasonal and part-time jobs, and 

entrepreneurship for women. Consequently, geotourism can also contribute significantly to 

cultural preservation. This shows that geoparks as pioneers in geotourism development 

can be considered as a sustainable base for tourism development. It is evident that the 

results mentioned above can confirm the following hypotheses:  



Chapter 6 - Conclusions and Implications 

279 

• H5: Geoparks contribute to promoting regional geotourism products and local 

products 

• H6: Geoparks promote geotourism through innovative strategies  

• H8: Geoparks contribute to minimizing the negative sociocultural impacts of 

tourism perceived by the local communities  

A geopark should represent a topography (a landscape), which has a sufficient size to 

generate economic activities, especially through tourism. In the third strategy, geoparks 

encourage the local communities to participate in tourism activities; results of 

questionnaires illustrate that the majority (80%) of responders believe that involving the 

local businessmen in tourism marketing such as tours, is the best way to promote the local 

economy; moreover 68% of geoparks try to link their activities to other local tourism 

activities such as boating, bird watching, cultural activities, etc.   

Besides, geoparks with a view to the development of the local economy strive to support 

local products and services through a label (36%) or direct marketing of regional products 

(36%).  

48% of geoparks through creating second or seasonal jobs for the local communities 

attempt to generate supplementary income for them.  

Engaging locals in tourism sectors such as mangrove tours, handicraft workrooms (needle 

work), local accommodation, and turtle sites, officials of Qeshm Geopark created second 

job opportunities or supplementary income for the local communities.   

Developing human resources in the tourism industry faces unique challenges, because 

customers’ preferences, travel patterns, information technology, and the conditions at 

destinations are changing rapidly. As a result, some strong and flexible human resources 

development strategies are needed. Strategies for human resources development in the 

tourism sector should highlight the role of the private sector, with the government acting 

as a catalyst to provide situations and guidelines.  

In this regard, establishing a Local or National Geopark Network is the fourth strategy in 

geoparks. A local and/or national geopark network achieves a great partnership with 

business entities, libraries, student facilities, farms, camping and caravanning sites, 

hotels, hostels, restaurants, bars, tourism offices, NGOs, and nature tour guides. 

Furthermore, geoparks can train local geotour guides and local outdoor companies under 

the umbrella of the national geopark network.  



Chapter 6 - Conclusions and implications 

280 

It is evident that geopark are established at international levels but managed at local 

levels, the majority of geoparks (52%) are managed officially, and in the most countries 

geoparks (52%) are financially supported by local municipalities (H9: Geoparks do not 

function similarly in terms of management).  

The members of the European Geopark Network and Global Geoparks Network entitled 

geoparks to use the logos on their promotional material. These logos must be used only 

on products related to geopark activities.  

Subsequently, using the geopark brand in local businesses is the fifth strategy in the 

development of local economy and geotourism markets. Results of responses illustrate 

that the majority of geoparks (84%) take advantage of the geopark brand in geotourism 

marketing (in festivals, publications, research projects, common marketing, higher 

prestige, accommodation, restaurants, educational programs, and local business); 

moreover, some local producers use the geopark brand for their products. The 

aforementioned results can confirm the third and the fourth hypotheses (H3:  Geotourism 

activities in geoparks create opportunities for local development, and H4: Using 

geotourism can be a useful strategy for developing tourism in geoparks).   

An education program is another strategy in geoparks. A geopark can create a framework, 

motivation, and support to integrate research, education, and training.  

Based on the results of formula related to Network analysis (Network Connection Rate 

(CN= 0.65) and Maximum Connectivity of the Network (MCN= 666)), Network activity in 

EGN is stronger than in the GGN. There are no disconnected nodes in the EGN, and all of 

the geoparks are involved in network activities.  

The EGN and GGN have concentrated their network activity in collaboration areas of 

meetings, conferences, and exchange of knowledge. In addition, the authorities of 

geoparks attempt to develop tourism marketing in their territory as well. Therefore, the 

results can also confirm the tenth and the eleventh hypotheses (H10: Network activity in 

the EGN is stronger than in the GGN, and H11: The majority of collaboration in the GGN 

and EGN is concentrated in the field of exchange of knowledge and knowledge transfer).  

A geopark organizes activities and provides logistic support to convey geo-scientific 

knowledge and environmental concepts to the public. This is accomplished through 

protected and interpreted geosites, museums, information centres, trails, guided tours, 

school class excursions, popular literature, maps, educational materials and displays, 

seminars, workshops, meetings and so on.  



Chapter 6 - Conclusions and Implications 

281 

A geopark also fosters scientific research and cooperation with universities and the 

research institutes, stimulating the negotiation between the geosciences and the local 

population. Results also indicate that the majority of geoparks (72%) have been equipped 

with workshop facilities and 56% of geoparks authorities believe that workshops improve 

the local economy through involving locals, artists, geologists, etc. in workshops. 

Unfortunately, Qeshm Geopark is the only geopark which has a weak operation in 

educational programs for local schoolchildren. Qeshm has concentrated its educational 

activities just on geopark museums, some workshops, graduate students’ theses, and 

publications. It is worth mentioning that recently they organized an educational program 

and field trips for some schoolchildren of the geopark.  

The last but not the least geopark strategy is innovative activities; a new vision of 

geotourism and geoparks can create new products (geo-products, geo-menu in 

restaurants, etc.), new jobs (geotours, geo-restaurants, geo-bakeries, and rural hotels), 

and new recreational activities (geo-sports, geo-monuments, geosites, geopark museums, 

geological gardens, etc.) for local communities and visitors.  

It is worth mentioning that these recreational activities that are in some way related to 

topography and geology are pedagogic tools for geotourists, who want to know more 

about the earth which they are living on.    

Lastly, results of the descriptive analysis illustrate that annually an average of 7.8 million 

geotourists visit geoparks around the world. These numbers of geotourists in European 

geoparks are about average of 4.3 million per year. Obviously, the creation of a geopark 

and development of geotourism marketing as a branch of sustainable tourism can be a 

solution for local development.  

Implementation of a geopark and geotourism plan in geopark territories can contribute to 

raising standards of living of local people who otherwise would not have access to them, 

especially because most geoparks are located in less favoured areas.  

The geotourism ‘emerging tourism’ niche is still in an early stage of commercial 

development, and geoparks located in rural areas experience slow economic 

development, but we trust that in the near future geoparks will be known as new 

geotourism destinations for those who want to know more.  

Consequently, sustainable employment at the local level may be achieved by supporting 

and developing small and medium sized businesses for instance those involved in tourism 

in the form of ecotourism and geotourism, conservation, education, gastronomy, and the 



Chapter 6 - Conclusions and implications 

282 

production of new products such as geo-products or production and sale of local products. 

The development of outdoor companies, outdoor educational activities and facilities for 

geo-sports can generate new and sustainable jobs. The establishment of information 

centres in geosites, geoparks and themed museums, fairs, and exhibitions can help to 

generate temporary employment for designers and provide permanent employment for 

local people. In addition, the creation of new geopark souvenirs and handicrafts can be a 

means for sociocultural sustainability in rural areas and geoparks territories.  

 

6.3.  Contributions and Managerial Implications  

The present study certainly benefits from previous works, especially the ones concerning 

geopark and geotourism concepts and current issues in innovation and novel strategies in 

geoparks.  

Tourism marketing is diverse, and dynamic, and it can be studied at a number of levels 

and from many perspectives. This study focuses on the new branch of nature tourism 

marketing named geotourism which follows sustainability principles. This branch is a niche 

market with an emphasis on the ‘geo’ (geology, geomorphology, geodiversity, and 

geography).  

In the academic sphere, this study can serve as a reference to enrich the field of tourism 

study named geotourism. It makes a contribution to the body of knowledge both in 

geography and tourism fields.  

Our knowledge is pioneering in the method of comparison between geoparks and social 

network methods in geoparks. Moreover, this thesis tries to ascertain the novel strategies 

and innovation in geoparks for achieving targets of the creation of geopark (development 

of local economy through geotourism, education, and conservation of natural, geological, 

and cultural heritage).  

The theoretical framework of the expansion strategy of geoparks was supported by 

empirical results at international level (geoparks registered in the UNESCO Global 

Geoparks Network) and at the local level (local communities of the Qeshm Geopark).  

Findings have practical value for researchers in the tourism field especially those who are 

interested in new tourism destinations.  

Another contribution of the thesis was introducing a new means for development of local 

economy and natural and cultural sustainability in rural areas.   



Chapter 6 - Conclusions and Implications 

283 

According to the social network method in this study, the majority of collaboration in the 

UNESCO Global Geoparks Network concentrated on the fields of meetings, exchange of 

knowledge and conferences. Consequently, it can be said that at present, exchange of 

knowledge is an important target in UNESCO Global Geoparks Network activity. 

Moreover, development of tourism marketing is the fourth target of network activities in 

UNESCO Global Geoparks.  

It is evident that in order to encourage rural development, the members of UNESCO 

Global Geoparks Network should pay more attention to tourism marketing in the form of 

ecotourism and geotourism.   

Regarding development of the local economy, rural accommodations, Small and Medium-

Sized Enterprises (SMEs), local companies, producers, and artists located in geoparks 

can benefit from a better understanding of the impact of a local network in their territory.  

Consequently, this thesis contributes to the body of knowledge on introducing new tourism 

destinations and a new tourism product (geotourism).  

 

6.4.  Limitations and Suggestions for Future Research 

6.4.1.  Limitations 

The research encountered some limitations that caused some difficulties in collecting the 

required data; firstly, since geopark and geotourism are relatively new concepts, it 

appears that there are a few scientific studies in this regard on which the researcher could 

count on.   

There were some other limitations which reduced the rate of data collection.  One of these 

was that the questionnaires were only available in three languages (English, Persian, and 

Portuguese). Since, in most geoparks, these languages are not the mother tongues, 

collecting the data took a long time for just 25 responses (from March 2009 to January 

2010).    

Furthermore, we not only sent the electronic questionnaires to geoparks, but also called 

geoparks offices several times to remind them to fill out the questionnaire and distributed 

the questionnaire at the 8th European Geoparks Network conference, Portugal. It is 

noteworthy that geoparks from China did not fill in the first questionnaires.

Aside from international questionnaires, we designed a questionnaire for local 

communities of Qeshm Geopark (Iran). We travelled to Qeshm Geopark during two 

summers (2008-2009).   

The other problem was that the terms of geopark and geotourism were new terms for 

locals, so I had to first explain those new terms to them.  

We overcame all the aforementioned limitations, and we hope that the result of this thesis 

opens a new gateway to introduce geoparks as a tourism destination and tools for rural 

development.       

   

6.4.2.  Suggestions for Future Research 

Geoparks and Geotourism are new approaches of sustainability. Nowadays, the earth is 

faced with problems such as global warming, air pollution, acid rain, depletion of the 

ozone layer, loss of forests, desertification, waste disposal toxic chemicals in waters, soil 

erosion, mass extinction and pollution of beaches, oceans, reservoirs and waterways. 

Regarding this the government in each sector should try to minimize the negative impacts 

of economic sectors on environment.  

In the tourism sector, the appearance of sustainable tourism, ecotourism, and geotourism 

were positive steps for preventing mass tourism and land destruction.  

Geoparks – as pioneers in development of geotourism – are a novel strategy for earth 

preservation together with the promotion of sustainable tourism in rural areas.  

The study of tourism demand, tourism demography, tourism satisfaction, evaluation of the 

Tourism Carrying Capacity, the Climate Index for Tourism (CIT) and Tourism Climate 

Index (TCI), determination of Indicators for sustainable tourism development in geoparks 

territory, special attention to financial slacks, policy and management, innovation, 

competition marketing, open marketing opportunities such as network activities and niche 

marketing are key issues for future tourism management in geoparks.   

In the near future, pursuant to the increase of the population, different kinds of stress will 

be generated, and so tourists in 21st century need relaxation more than in years past. 

Since the majority of geoparks are located in the rural areas, geopark territories can be 

good tourism destinations for relaxation.     

According to the information filled in on forms by geopark authorities some geoparks 

attempt to create some facilities for relaxation of tourists in their territory: establishing spa 



Chapter 6 - Conclusions and Implications 

285 

therapy centres in Naturtejo Geopark (Portugal), Nature park Terra.Vita (Germany), 

Bohemian Paradise (Czech Republic) and Itoigawa Geopark (Japan); promoting Malay 

herbal treatments in Langkawi Geopark (Malaysia); organizing medicinal herb tours in 

Eisenwurzen Geopark (Austria) and promoting geo-therapy such as mud therapy, hydro 

therapy, peat therapy, ice therapy, and paraffin wax therapy in Swabian Alb Geopark 

(Germany) are good examples in this regard.  

In the 21st century the tourism sector should pay particular attention to the accessible 

tourism market and senior tourism market.  

It is evident that seniors are retired and have more time and money for travelling. As a 

result, creating facilities and opportunities for the senior tourism market in geoparks can 

move money to geopark territories.  

The accessible tourism market as niche marketing which involved disabilities, seniors and 

those with temporary incapacities are also part of the tourism market dynamics. Disabled 

visitors need new services and facilities.  

The Greenwalk Company in Portugal which opened a geo-accessible tour in July 2011 

with 8 blind visitors can be good example for development of accessible geotourism.  Geo 

Accessible has been integrating four-wheel-drive (4WD) trails as well (Tavares, 2011).  

Creating educational tools for disabled students and visitors can help to promote 

educational activities as a main target of geoparks for attracting new visitors.  

Publishing Braille handbooks, tourism guidebooks for blind students and visitors, 

preparing video clips and organizing workshops about geoparks for deaf/mute visitors and 

schoolchildren with the help of the persons who are familiar with the deaf-and-dumb 

alphabet, training geo-tour guides for deaf/mute visitors, preparing geo-trails and 

exhibitions, interpretative centres for disabled and senior visitors are examples of 

integrating geotourism marketing with the accessible tourism market in the future through 

geoparks.  

As mentioned before the study of tourism demand and tourism demography in each 

geopark territory is a prerequisite for tourism development in the future. Todd (2001) noted 

that the arrival numbers of visitors can be a reliable economic indicator in tourism 

destinations. Thus organizing some projects regarding tourism demand in geoparks is a 

fundamental study for the development of tourism in the future. The numbers of domestic 

and international visitor arrivals in each geopark, and the level of their education and 



Chapter 6 - Conclusions and implications 

286 

expenditure, the duration of stay of visitors, tourism profile and the level of their 

satisfaction are key components for tourism management in geoparks territory. 

Through these tourism studies, decision-making about the type of tourism facilities and 

services in geoparks will become easier. It is obvious that the evaluation of tourism 

marketing through the needs of customers enables better management of tourism 

destinations for governors.   

For instance, if the majority of visitors in the geopark are categorized as young, geopark 

authorities should focus more on recreational activities such as geo-sports, adventure and 

fun activities (geo-rafting, climbing, geo-kayaking, etc.); and, if their education level is high 

officials should pay particular attention to the preparation of geotourism maps, 

interpretative panels, thematic museums and workshops, etc.  

Another main external new trend that will strongly affect the tourism industry is climate 

change (Costa and Buhalis, 2006). Climate is a key component for many types of tourism, 

especially ecotourism and geotourism. Evaluating the Climate Index for Tourism (CIT) and 

Tourism Climate Index (TCI) for each geopark and preparing the TCI map for geoparks 

territory can be a strategy for tourism satisfaction.  

According to some authors (Freitas et al., 2008; Farajzadeha and Matzarakis, 2009; 

Karimi , 2010) , weather/climate and tourism/recreation are interconnected, and tourists, 

tour organizers, travel agencies, tourism planners and stakeholders need to be reliably 

informed about the role of weather and climate.  

The Tourism Climate Index (TCI) was proposed by Mieczkowski (1985), in order to use 

climate data for tourist destinations worldwide. This index computes the best months for 

travelling to a territory in the future.  

It is noteworthy that these climate indexes can help to design geopark calendars and 

programs. For example during the months with excellent, very good and good TCI ratings, 

geopark authorities should organize the geotours, cruises, and some geo-sports such as 

rafting, organizing tours for seniors, etc. and during the good and acceptable TCI periods, 

officials can concentrate on educational activities in universities, schools, kindergartens, 

museums and interpretive centres. 

Freitas et al. (2008) illustrated that evaluation of the rates of Climate Index for Tourism 

(CIT) can play an important role in activities that are highly climate/weather sensitive, 

specifically, beach “sun, sea and sand”.  



Chapter 6 - Conclusions and Implications 

287 

Therefore, computing this parameter can be a useful strategy for the development of 

tourism in geoparks located in coastal areas and that are members of the coastal thematic 

group (e.g. Shetland, Petrified Forest of Lesvos, Gea-Norvegica, Copper Coast, Geo Mon, 

and English Riviera geoparks).  

Since conservation is one of the targets for geoparks, determining Tourism Carrying 

Capacity in geopark territories is an important factor in the preservation of natural heritage 

and development of sustainable tourism. Tourism Carrying Capacity is defined by the 

World Tourism Organization as “The maximum number of people that may visit a tourist 

destination at the same time, without causing destruction of the physical, economic, 

sociocultural environment and an unacceptable decrease in the quality of visitors' 

satisfaction”.  

In addition to Tourism Carrying Capacity, sustainable development indicators can lead to 

better decisions and more effective actions by simplifying, clarifying, and making 

aggregated information available to policy makers (United Nations, 2007). Determining 

sustainable development indicators can help to integrate social science and physical 

knowledge into decision-making; they can also be important components to measure 

progress towards sustainable development goals. They can provide an early warning to 

prevent negative economic, social, and environmental impacts. These indicators are 

important for implementation of tourism management planning.  

It is worth mentioning that in geopark management authorities should pay particular 

attention to sustainable tourism principles as well. In view of the fact that the tourists in the 

21st century are different from the past, they want to gain more experiences from travel 

and sightseeing together with the experience of unique facilities and attractions. In recent 

decades, the numbers of educated tourists have increased, so they need a new leisure 

market, niche products and services. Creating this kind of products requires searching 

about the scope of the local economy, professionalism and innovation. New markets 

require different products and services, thus innovation and innovative strategies can play 

a role in promoting new markets.  

Nowadays, geoparks as open museums for the development of geotourism strive to offer 

new geotourism facilities to visitors. Since geotravelers are interested in knowing more 

about the earth where they live, geotourism as niche marketing, which emphasizes the 

‘geo’ (geology, geomorphology, geodiversity, and geography) should pay particular 

attention to educational activities, and should try to achieve educational goals through 

recreational activities. Geoparks, as pioneers for the development of geotourism, for 



Chapter 6 - Conclusions and implications 

288 

creating geo-products and geo-services as leisure and pedagogic tools need innovation 

and professionals in geology, geomorphology and geography. Moreover, the 

establishment of geo-restaurants, geo-museums, preparation facilities for geo-sports and 

organization of geotours demonstrate that geopark authorities are searching for a new 

leisure market and are trying to combine the earth sciences with recreational activities in 

geopark territories.  

Nevertheless, study of geoparks and geotourism is classified in interdisciplinary sciences 

as well as tourism marketing, so collaboration and network activities between specialists 

in related sciences such as geology, geography, ecology, tourism, biology, agriculture, 

environment, etc., can be a useful strategy for better management of geoparks in the 

present and future.   

Perhaps the most important element in the future of geotourism is innovation and 

competition. Geoparks as messengers of geotourism should strengthen their 

competitiveness activities. At local level geoparks can hold thematic competitions for 

schoolchildren and local communities (e.g. painting, sand festivals, making thematic 

cakes, taking photographs, and producing geo-products). However, at an international 

level competition should concentrate on international projects. 

Regarding this, National Geographic held a global competition entitled “Geotourism 

Challenge 2010: Places on the Edge – Saving Coastal &amp;amp; Freshwater Destinations”. 

Entrants can submit their ideas and proposals in the competition. This kind of competition 

is not only a strategy for collecting innovative ideas and brainstorms, but also the winner’s 

prize can cover some part of the necessary financial budget for implementation of 

projects.  

Geotourism and geoparks should pay more attention to applying new technology in the 

21st century. As geopark and geotourism are new terms and they are still in an early 

stage of development, so virtual tours which are provided by the Geographic Information 

System (GIS), improving interactivity of geopark websites, expanding local TV channels, 

and Geopark online TV channels can play an important role in tourist attraction to these 

territories. Therefore, expanding multimedia guides and self-guiding tours for geotourism 

such as TERRAGAZE mobile and geological multimedia kiosk in each geopark are other 

areas for further research.   

Establishment of thematic museums in geoparks, in accordance with the geological and 

geomorphological phenomena in each geopark can be strategic to educate visitors.  

Mineral galleries and geothermal interpretive centres (in European Geoparks), desert (in 



Chapter 6 - Conclusions and Implications 

289 

Middle East or African Geoparks), or petroleum museums (in Middle East Geoparks) are 

examples in this regard. Thus, the thematic study of geoparks, thematic networks and 

geo-museums are other subjects of future researches.  

According to methodology, in this thesis the Social Network Analysis (SNA) method was 

used for visualizing UNESCO Global Geoparks Network and European Geoparks Network 

to ascertain the fields of their collaboration. Hence, it can be said that the use of Social 

Network Analysis (SNA) method in each geopark for better understanding of the impact of 

local networks on rural development is another area for future research.  

The last but not the least suggestion for future research is focusing on sustainable energy 

and geo-energy (coal, petroleum and geothermal, nuclear energy). Holding workshops on 

geo-energy in related geoparks and providing infrastructures and facilities for the 

establishment of eco-campsites and geo-campsites in geopark territories can help to 

develop sustainable tourism.    

Using the renewable resource of geothermal energy for cooling and heating of geo-

campsites and eco-campsites in geopark territories in the near future can be a positive 

step toward sustainable development and sustainable tourism.   

Figure 6.1 illustrates the topics for research in geotourism. Furthermore, future issues in 

geopark research are summarized in Figure 6.2.
