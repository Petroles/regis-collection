ABSTRACT

The aim of this study was to examine the endothelial
surface morphology and perform a morphometric analysis of
the corneal endothelial cells of ostrich (Struthio camelus) using
scanning electron microscopy. Polygonality, mean cell area,
cell density and coefficient of variation of mean cell area were
analyzed. The normal corneal endothelium consisted of
polygonal cells of uniform size and shape with few
interdigitations of the cell borders. Microvilli appeared as
protusions on the cellular surface. The average cell area was
269±18?m2 and the endothelial cell density was 3717±240cells
mm-2. The coefficient of variation of the cell area was 0.06, and
the percentage of hexagonal cells was 75%. The parameters
evaluated did not differ significantly between the right and the
left eye from the same ostrich. The results of this study showed
that the ostrich corneal endothelial cells appear quite similar
to those of the other vertebrates. 

Key words: corneal, endothelium, ostrich, Struthio camelus.

RESUMO

Objetivou-se examinar a superfície posterior do
endotélio corneano e realizar análise morfométrica das células
endoteliais da córnea de avestruz (Struthio camelus) valendo-
se da microscopia eletrônica de varredura. Avaliaram-se o
número de lados, a área celular média, a densidade celular e
o coeficiente de variação da área celular. O endotélio corneano
de avestruz constitui-se de células poligonais uniformes em
tamanho e forma, e com poucas interdigitações das bordas
celulares. Visibilizaram-se microvilosidades na superfície celular.

A área celular média foi de 269±18?m2 e a densidade celular
foi de 3717±240 células mm-2. O coeficiente de variação foi de
0,06 e o percentual de células hexagonais de 75%. Não foram
observadas diferenças significativas entre os parâmetros
avaliados entre os olhos esquerdo e direito. Este estudo
demonstrou que o endotélio corneano de avestruz é semelhante
ao descrito em outros vertebrados.

Palavras-chave: endotélio, córnea, avestruz, Struthio camelus.

The corneal endothelium is a single layer of
polygonal cells covering the posterior surface of the
cornea (TUFT &amp;amp; COSTER, 1990). The structure of the
normal corneal endothelium has been documented in
humans (ABIB &amp;amp; BARRETO, 2001), dogs (GWIN et
al., 1982; PIGATTO et al., 2006; RODRIGUES et al., 2006),
horses (ANDREW et al., 2001) and other animal species
(YEE et al., 1987; COLLIN &amp;amp; COLLIN, 1998; PIGATTO
et al., 2004; PIGATTO et al., 2005a; PIGATTO et al.,
2005b).   The ostrich (Struthio camelus) is the world’s
largest living bird. Native of Africa, these flightless
bird are important animals in many livestock industries.
However, studies about the corneal endothelium of the
ostrich (Struthio camelus) have not been reported
previously, in the referred literature. The aim of this
study was to examine the surface morphology and to

perform a morphometric analysis of the normal corneal
endothelial cells of ostrich by using scanning electron
microscopy (SEM).

These findings help to establish the normal
appearance of ostrich corneal endothelial and can be
used for comparison with other animal species.

Twenty-four normal eyes from 12 Ostriches
(Struthio camelus), males, with 1 year old and about
100kg of body weight, were studied. These eyes were
obtained from a licensed Brazilian commercial company
that breeds ostriches for meat production.  All
procedures were performed in compliance with the
Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology
statement regarding the use of animals in ophthalmic
and vision research. Ostriches were killed in a
commercial abattoir, using a standard slaughter
protocol. After 1 hour of death, eyes were enucleated
and those one that showed evidence of ocular disease
were excluded. The posterior endothelial surfaces were
examined and photographed using a scanning electron
microscope operated at 15kV.  Ten photomicrographs
were taken from each cornea with magnifications of X
750, X 1,000, and X 1,500. The photomicrographs were
scanned into the computer, and polygonality was
determined. With image analyzer software, the cell area
of 100 endothelial cells from each cornea was measured,
and mean endothelial cell density was obtained. The
coefficient of variation of mean cell area was calculated
by dividing the standard deviation of the cell area by
mean cell area. Statistical data analysis was conducted
using the Tukey test. Values of P&lt;0.05 were considered
significant.  

The posterior corneal endothelium surface
of the ostriches observed on SEM revealed a
continuous layer of polygonal cells of uniform size and
shape (Figure 1). The cell borders showed few
interdigitations. Microvilosities appeared as multiple
protusions on cell surface . Cilia were not observed.
Small pits were observed scattered over the cell surface.
Regarding the polygonality of the endothelium, the
majority of cells were six-sided (75%), with five- (14%),
and seven-sided (11%) cells constituting the remaining
corneal endothelium. The mean cell area of corneal
endothelium was 269±18?m2 and the endothelial cell
density was 3717±240cells mm-2. The coefficient of
variation of mean cell area was 0.06. The parameters
evaluated did not differ significantly between the right
and the left eye from the same Ostrich.   

Despite of their considerable use, the effects
of preparation of cornea for SEM on corneal
endothelium have been described (VIRTANEN et al.,
1984). SEM, with appropriate consideration of the
effects of fixation, allows the evaluation of morphology

and morphometric analysis of endothelial cells of
ostrich.

In most vertebrates the shape of normal
corneal endothelial cells shows a mosaic-like pattern
of polygonal cells (YEE et al., 1987; COLLIN &amp;amp; COLLIN,
1998; ANDREW et al., 2001; PIGATTO et al., 2004;
PIGATTO et al., 2005a; PIGATTO et al., 2006). The
pleomorphic characteristics of ostrich corneal
endothelium are similar to those of man, cat, dog, and
other vertebrates, where 65-80% of corneal endothelial
cells area hexagonal (DOUGHTY, 1989; PIGATTO et
al., 2005a). This study shows endothelial cells with
minimal variation in size and shape, probably because
all animals were of the same age, and only healthy
corneas were studied. In other species, endothelial
morphologic features and cell densities are dependent
on age, with a decrease in endothelial cell density and
corresponding increases in cell size and variation in
shape with age (GWIN et al., 1982).  The coefficient of
variation in cell area observed in this study was similar
to those described in normal corneal endothelium of
other avians (YEE et al., 1987; PIGATTO et al., 2005). 

Our results regarding the ultrastructure of
the corneal endothelium of ostrich agree with those
reported by other authors (YEE et al., 1987; DOUGHTY,
1989; COLLIN &amp;amp; COLLIN, 1998; PIGATTO et al., 2004;
PIGATTO et al., 2005a; PIGATTO et al., 2006). Our study
confirmed the presence of microvilli distributed over
the surface of each endothelial cell. The small microvilli
projected from all the endothelial cells have been
described in other vertebrates (COLLIN &amp;amp; COLLIN,
1998). In the current investigation, we did not detect
cilia in the corneal endothelium. However, this structure,
protruding into the anterior chamber, was occasionally
found in the endothelial cells of humans as well as in
other animals (GALLAGHER, 1980). The small pits
observed scattered over the cell surface probably
represent pinocytotic vesicles, previously documented
(SVEDBERGH &amp;amp; BILL, 1972). Density of corneal
endothelial cells using SEM has previously been
reported in other species (COLLIN &amp;amp; COLLIN, 1998;
PIGATTO et al., 2004; PIGATTO et al., 2005a;
RODRIGUES et al., 2006). The cell densities of the
representative species of birds ranged from
4.413±766cells mm-2 to 11.734±1.687cells mm-2 (COLLIN
&amp;amp; COLLIN, 1998). Our results showed that cell density
is similar to that found by COLLIN and COLLIN (1998).
This study showed that the parameters evaluated did
not differ significantly between both eyes from the same
ostrich. Such findings are in agreement with previous
studies (TUFT &amp;amp; COSTER, 1990; ANDREW et al., 2001;
PIGATTO et al., 2004; PIGATTO et al., 2005b).  The
ultrastructure and the morphometric parameters of the

Ostrich corneal endothelium are similar to those
described in other vertebrates. Furthermore, these data
will increase our understanding about the environmental
constraints placed on the non mammalian cornea and
the evolutionary development of this tissue.
