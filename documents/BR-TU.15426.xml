Why Auctions?

• Conceptually, auction is the recommended 
mechanism employed to allocate resources when 
dealing with assymmetric information on the value 
of the object, considering both the regulator and 
the potential players;

• In Brazil, oil and gas exploration and production 
contracts are auctioned since the Constitutional 
Ammendment 9/1995 and the Law 9478/1997.



Contributions of Auction Theory

? The important issues in auction design are the 
same as the ones in competition policy: to avoid 
collusion, predation, entry-deterring behaviour, 
excessive concentration of market power 
(Klemperer, 2001);

? Hence, from the public policy perspective, to 
identify the auction design that mitigate these 
problems is a crucial objective.



The Revenue Equivalence Theorem

• Starting point of Auction Design Theory: how violations of the 
Revenue Equivalence Theorem matter;

• This theorem states that there is no sistematic advantage in any 
mechanism design (the set of rules that governs the interaction 
among the parts);

• According to the basic model (independent private values), any 
single-stage or multi-stage game for allocating the unit among 
the n bidders will yeld the same expected payment by each 
bidder and the same expected revenue for the auctioneer;

• For an important set of auctions and environments, the average  
revenues and pays-offs of the bidders are exactly the same 
(Milgrom, 2004)



When the Irrelevancy Theorem is violated by reality

• In the real world, different auction models, depending on 
the specific situatios seem to generate different incentive 
structures and hence yield different results;

• There’s no such a thing as “one size fits all” in auction 
design – with empirical studies we realize that design 
matters (“Good auction design is not one size fits all and 
must be sensitive to the details of the context” Kemperer, 
202);

• Even when there is a good understanding of the economic 
environment before the auction, the behaviour of the 
players cannot be treated as perfectly predictable (Milgrom, 
2004)



The auction objectives

• The trade-off between objectives – eficiencies or revenue –
is conceptually solved by Auction Theory, as both objectives 
tend to converge:

– Players that atribute higher value to the auctioned object 
tend to be the most capable of generating value;

– However, when market power is incorporated into the 
analysis, the coincidence of the goals of 
increased revenue generation and efficiency is 
compromised: higher bids for a player with market 
power may reflect its ability to raise prices, and not its 
productive efficiency.



Still the auction objectives

• Private values vs common values

– The first depends on the parties’ individual information and 
valuation over the object; the former depends on the real value of the 
object being the same to all the players (real world auctions mix 
private and common values);

• Oil and Gas auctions are typical examples of auctions of common 
values

– The quantity and the international price will be the same 
independent of the winner;

– In this environment, with few and big players, there is high risk of 
collusion;

– When assimetry of information is introduced in this environment, we 
face the risk of winner’s curse.



Still the auction objectives

• Some questions should be raised, but are frequently 
ommited:

– The auctionned object has been alocated  in an efficient 
way?

– Do the auction rules promote competition?

– Does the auction promote dynamic competition, in the 
sense that it promotes the entry of new players, or at least 
do not generate entry barriers?

– Does the auction promote small firms? 

• (Kemperer, 2000)



Empirical evidence of winner’s curse: the US case

? Hendricks and Porter (1988), Hendricks, Porter and Wilson 
(1994) exploits the availability of ex post values to test equilibrium 
bidding models in common value environments with asymmetric 
information using drainage tract data;

? Drainage tracts are adjacent to tracts where oil and gas deposits have 
been found. The firms owning the adjacent tracts, called “neighbour” 
firms, have superior information to non-neighbours about tract value;

? The key feature of competitive bidding between informed and 
uninformed firms in first-price, common value auctions is that the 
latter participate, but their number is essentially irrelevant to the 
informed firm;

? Since neighbour firms could be identified, and because they behaved as 
a consortium, it was possible to test the theory by comparing the 
bidding behaviour and the ex post profits of neighbour firms and non-
neighbours. 



Empirical evidence of winner’s curse: the US case

? Hendrick, Pinkse and Porter (2003) conclude that the 
“winner’s curse” is evident in the data and that the bidders are 
aware of its presence and bid accordingly;

? Bidding behaviour appears to be largely consistent with a 
symmetric CV environment, given our measure of potential 
competition and our measure of ex post returns;

? Hendrick, Pinkse and Porter (2008) show that the trading 
inefficiency caused by the “winner’s curse” can be an 
important obstacle to collusion in auctions of common value 
assets with a binding reserve price or ex post investment.



Experimental research on common value 
auctions

? Experimental research on CVAs has focused on the 
winner's curse: Kagel (1995), Avery and Kagel (1997), 
Kagel and Levin (2008), Levin, Kagel, and Richard 
(1996), Rose and Levin (in press), Rose and Kagel (in 
press);

? The bottom line of these studies is that they confirm 
the problem of Winer’s Curse, but put in evidence the 
difference in magnitude, depending on the auction 
design.



Experimental research in colusion

Increasingly large experimental literature on the 
subject: Goswami, Noe and Rebello (1996), 
Sherstyuck (2002), Phillips, Menkhaus, and Coatney 
(2003), Sade, Schnitzlein, and Zender (2005) Li and 
Plott (2005), Offerman and Potters (2006), Brown, 
Kamp, and Plott (2007) and Kwasnica and Sherstyuk 
(in press).



Experimental research in colusion

? All of the auctions considered here involved the same set of 
subjects competing in a series of auctions, usually with an 
unannounced end point;

? Repetition with the same cohort appears to be a key 
(collusion) facilitating factor, a factor likely to be at play in 
field settings as well;

? Communication between bidders reliably facilitates 
collusion (hardly surprising). As Whinston (2006) notes 
there is little in formal economic theory about the way in 
which prohibitions on (nonbinding) price agreements 
prevent anticompetitive prices, with the published 
empirical work offering surprisingly little evidence that 
preventing oligopolists from talking has a substantial effect 
on the prices they charge.



Experimental research in colusion

? Sealed-bid, pay what you bid type auctions are more 
collusion-proof than ascending price auctions, which 
provide easier opportunities to detect and punish 
non-cooperators; Competitive pressures seem to play 
a role as well as suggested by the role played in 
breaking up collusion in LP and the role played (in 
the form of the support from which values were 
drawn) in Sherstyuk (2002).



What we have learned with our experience with oil and 
gas auctions so far in Brazil?

• Rules for the eight rounds of auctions that already took 
place:
– First-price, sealed bid auction with multiple goals (blocks);

– A mix of simultaneous and sequential auctions – bids of one 
player to a set of blocks belonging to the same sector are gathered 
in one sealed bid auction;

– Only after the results of the auctions for one sector is known, the 
process of the following block begins (sequential auction) 

– Bidding in packs are not allowed (for different blocks)

– The process is public and transparent, allowing for 
the organization of consortia, with or without the participation 
of the incumbent company(Petrobras).

– In the 8th round a restriction rule was introduced to the maximum 
number of blocks won by participants.



What we have learned with our experience with oil 
and gas auctions so far?

• In all the rounds, Petrobras’ participation was very expressive, 
varying between 38 and 84,1% of the auctioned areas. The firm’s 
success rate varied between 71,4% and 98,8% (rate tended to 
increase with each round);

• How to explain that success rate? “The predominance 
of offshore activity, the expertise of Petrobras and the relatively short 
time of opening” (Costa, Pastoriza e Prates, 2005) explains a great 
part of it.



What Theory of Auction would say otherwise?

• Refer to one factor: the winner's curse.

• When competing for the right to explore a field with an 
incumbent, under the rule of a sealed auction price, the 
players are subject to an extreme asymmetry 
of information;

• Petrobras has dealt with prospective research in Brazil for 
over 50 years. Winning an auction against it is almost 
certainly a bad deal (i.e. it means you the winner evaluated 
wrongly);

• Add to that the incumbent's market power: the 
participants have every reason to be cautious in their bids.



Recalling why the auction design matters

• The design of a first price sealed auction prevents 
participants from obtaining signals on the true value of the 
fields, when they are not able to observe the bids of other 
participants;

• If, on the one hand, the design minimized the risk of 
collusion, it maximized the problem of the winner's curse, 
making all other participants, other than the incumbent, 
overly cautious;

• Thus, sub-optimal result: although aiming at more 
competition we end up with less competition (and 
efficiency and revenues to the auctioneer) as one might 
expect from the theory.



What to expect of auction in the new regime?

? In June 2010, the Brazilian Government waived Petrobras’ need for 
bidding for 5 billion barrels of oil of the pre-salt layers, that will be 
obtained instead through a bilateral contract called “onerous 
assignment”; 

? Moreover, with the enactment of Law No. 12,351 of December 22, 2010, 
it was determined that the pre-salt oil and gas fields will be explored 
according to a Production Sharing Agreement (PSA); 
? In the PSA, the government retains ownership of production, and grants oil 

companies a stipulated share as compensation for risks taken, services 
rendered, initial investment, and operation and maintenance costs. 

? The PSA, under the aforementioned law, can be signed: 
? entirely by Petrobras, without the need of auctions; 

? or by a consortium that wins the auction for the area to be explored, that 
consortium being formed by Petrobras (at least 30% of it) and the winning 
company(ies). 



What to expect of auction in the new regime?

? The auction design becomes a main object of study.

? The minimum guarantee of 30% for Petrobras will affect the incentives 
for consortia formation and bidding performance; 

? This can generate new outcomes, impacting not only bids and winners, but 
also the return for the government (as  the auctioneer and also as a bidder 
through Petrobras).

? Because of the specificities of Brazilian PSAs, concessions and onerous 
assignment, the asymmetries between the entities participating in a 
unitization agreement – when reservoir holders have boundaries other 
than those outlined in the contract, and have to operate the field jointly 
– also becomes a sensitive issue that requires further research.



What to expect of auction in the new regime?

? It is necessary to evaluate the available auction design 
and even propose new ones – or combinations of 
existing ones;

? It is not possible to advance by fine tune, building on 
previous mistakes. A well-defined framework is 
necessary to provide legal certainty to 
investors/bidders. Lab experiments will be crucial to 
test different designs;

? It must be pointed that the model adopted so far 
facilitates detection and punishment (the two elements 
necessary to make a cartel work): simultaneity in a 
given block and sequenciality across blocks. Plus, 
increased winner’s curse due to 1st price sealed bid.  



Possible solutions

? The collusion’s problem in sequential auctions could 
be mitigated:

? Lots’ designs which hamper the market’s division;

? Rules imposition(including imposition of costs) which prohibit 
withdrawal of bids and their values;

? Imposition of anonymity to the participants and/or to the bids.

? The problem of the winner’s curse could be mitigated 
by the design of a hybrid auction, which enables 
learning (reduction of information asymmetry) 

? Sequential, ascending and open auction.



The winner´s curse is worse under the new rules

? the problem of winner's curse is getting worse in the new regulatory 
framework for the pre-salt, since the share of the incumbent will be 
established politically (for strategic reasons);

? If Petrobras had fixed 30% share, the collective information would be 
greater, which would decrease the uncertainty of the agents and 
possibly the winner's curse;

? However, assuming that Petrobras is the agent most well informed, 
with great certainty of high profitability, the government starts to want 
to ensure wide participation in income from the block;

? It is presumed that Petrobras will enter only between wells with 
minimum participation is very risky and uncertain. The rest knowing 
that a certain victory at auction may be due to a miscalculation 
(considering that would be more uninformed) may decide on 
participation / bid below the optimum.



Possible solutions

? As we do not have empirical knowledge on outcomes 
of auction under this institucional environment, 
experimental economics may be crucial;

? Which designs will be able to mitigate the winner’s 
curse problem.
