ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to define the photographic patterns that represent the use 

and occupation of the landcover of the "spring" of the Rico Stream subbasin, located at Monte Alto, 

state of São Paulo (SP), Brazil, for environmental adaptation regarding the Brazilian Forest Law. 

The mapping was performed using remote sensing techniques and visual interpretation of the World 

View image, followed by the digitalization of the net of drainage and vegetation (natural and 

agricultural) at the AutoCad software with documents and field work. The study area has 

2141.53 ha and the results demonstrated that the main crop is sugarcane with 546.34 ha, followed 

by 251.22 ha of pastures, 191.71 ha of perennial crops, 57.31 ha of Eucalyptus and 49.52 ha of 

onion, confirming the advance of sugarcane culture in the region. The region has 375.04 ha of areas 

of permanent preservation (APPs), and of this area it was found that only 72.17 ha (19.24%) has 

arboreal vegetation or natural forest, and 302.87 ha of these areas need to be enriched and reforested 

with native vegetation from the region, according to the current legislation. The data of the area 

enable future proposals of models for environmental adaptation to the microbasin according to the 

current environmental legislation. 

 

KEYWORDS: mapping, land use and occupation, vegetal coverage.

INTRODUCTION 

The environmental adaptation in hydrographic basins is important to comply with federal 

legislation of the Brazilian Constitution (BRAZIL, 1988). In Article nº 225, this Constitution report 

that "Everyone has the right to an ecologically balanced environment and of common use and 

essential to a healthy quality of life, belonging to the Government and society the duty to defend 

and preserve it for present and future generations. " 

The Forest Code, Federal Law nº 4,771/65 (BRAZIL, 1965), defines that the area of 

permanent preservation (APP) is the area covered or not by native vegetation, with the 

environmental function of preserving water resources, landscape, geological stability, biodiversity, 

gene flow of fauna and flora, to protect soil and ensure the well being of human populations. This 

code also includes riparian forests in the category of areas of permanent preservation. Thus, all the 

natural vegetation, arboreal or not, present along the river banks and around sources and reservoirs 

should be preserved. 

CONAMA Resolution nº 303/02 (BRAZIL, 2002), which also discuss about parameters, 

definitions and boundaries of APP, in the 3
rd

 Article, says that the APP consists in the area located: 

I - in marginal strip, measured from the highest level in horizontal projection, with a 

minimum width of: thirty meters to the watercourse with less than ten feet wide; 

II - around the source or waterhole, even if intermittent, with minimum radius of fifty meters 

in such a way that protects, in each case, the contributory hydrographic basin. 

Thus, denoting the importance of the APPs, with the function of protecting the natural 

environment, this means that they are not appropriate areas for land use, and should be covered with 

native vegetation. The vegetal coverage in these areas will mitigate the effects of erosion and 

leaching of soils, contributing to regulation of water flow, reducing sedimentation of watercourse 

and reservoirs, bringing benefits to the fauna and flora. 

For reforestation and recovery of degraded areas we have the Resolutions SMA 21 of 2001 

and SMA 47 of 2003, and the most current, Resolution SMA 08 of 2008 (SMA, 2001, 2003, 2008), 

which fix the orientation for heterogeneous reforestation of degraded areas. In Resolution SMA of 

2008, there is an attachment that contains a list of the arboreal species and an indication of its 

natural biomes / ecosystems and ecological regions of the state of São Paulo (SMA, 2008). 

The analysis of the land use and occupation in an area is the first step to guide an effective 

management regarding the means for the development of conservation practices, in common with 

farming practices, and economic development with less impact to the environment. OLIVEIRA et 

al. (2008); DELALIBERA et al. (2008) and NASCIMENTO et al. (2006), conducted studies aiming 

to develop maps of land use based on satellite images to identify conflicts of uses, having as 

reference the Brazilian Forest Law. The surveys were developed around the National Park of 

Caparaó in the state of Minas Gerais, in Ponta Grossa - in the state of Paraná and the hydrographic 

basin of the Alegre River, located in the southern of the state of Espírito Santo. The geoprocessing 

resources were the basis for mapping classes of land use, to contemplate the requirements of Areas 

of Permanent Preservation, regarding to the occurrence of sources and riparian vegetation. 

VALLE JUNIOR et al. (2010) report that a hydrographic basin is geographically a system 

defined with great diversity of environments where they develop different economic activities, 

which have a direct effect on vegetation, soils, topography, water bodies and biodiversity in general. 

This study aimed to set photographic standards representing the evaluation of the use and 

occupation of the source of Rico Stream, located in Monte Alto - São Paulo (SP), Brazil. The 

information obtained will be the basis for a database on territorial unit of hydrographic basin, for 

purposes of environmental adaptation regarding the Brazilian Forest Law.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

The study was performed at the spring drainage of the Rico Stream subbasin, and it was 

considered as the territorial unit of work, the main set of sources of the stream or region of higher 

altitude. The area has an extension of 2,141.53 ha, corresponding to 3.95% of the hydrographic 

basin of Rico Stream and located between the geographical coordinates of latitude 21°16'04''S and 

21°20'49''S and longitude 48°27'42''W Gr. and 48°31'19''W Gr., whose source begins at the Rico 

Stream including its route until the junction with the Glória Farm Stream, in Monte Alto - SP.  

The main soil types found in the studied area are the Red-Yellow Argisols (PVA3), the Red-

Yellow Argisols (PVA4) and Litholic Neosols (EMBRAPA, 1999). The climate, according to 

Köeppen, is classified as humid mesothermal of hot summer and dry winter (Cwa type), and the 

annual rainfall ranges from 1,100 mm to 1,700 mm. The average annual relative humidity is 

approximately 71%, occurring concentration of rainfall during the period of October to March and 

the dryer season extends from April to September. The predominant forest formation type consists 

of the semi-deciduous forest. 

The study was based on visual analysis of images taken by the Panchromatic Sensor, installed 

aboard the Satellite WorldView 1, dated in October 2005, at scales of approximately 1:15,000 in 

Panchromatic band and quadrants P001, P002 and P003 on the current area. The topographic maps 

published by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e 

Estatística - IBGE, 1971), at scale 1:50,000, vertical equidistance between curves of 20m level were 

used as auxiliary in the delimitation of various characteristics of the study area and mainly as a 

point of planialtimetric support of drainage net and the location of the hydrographic microbasin. 

The sheets used were IBGE topographical maps, at scale 1:50,000, the areas surrounding the maps 

in question are: Taiúva (SF-22-X-III-1), Pirangi (SF-22-X-D-II-2) Jaboticabal (SF-22-X-D-III-3) 

and Taquaritinga (SF-22-X-D-II-4). 

As equipments, it was used computer system compatible for image analysis. The maps were 

drawn with georeferenced control points for mobile and fixed receivers TRIMBLE GPS and tuned 

to American NAVSTAR artificial satellites. The Mark of Reference (base station) for data 

collection with GPS receivers was the geodesic mark of the Department of Rural Engineering of 

FCAV/UNESP. 

For the digitalization, junction of the maps and graphical representation of the area it was 

used the AutoCad2008 program, which is a graphic design software, having vector files. For 

processing the data collected in the field for georeferencing it was used the Program GPSurvey. The 

details of this study were transferred to the base map, establishing the geographical distribution and 

general representation of the area. 

For the preparation of the map of use/occupation of the area with remote sensing data visually 

interpreted and to extract the information of the image was determine the elements of the image 

recognition. The methodology was based on the analysis of visual patterns identified on aerial 

photographs, which were: shape, size, shadow, tone/color, pattern, texture, location and aspects 

relation, adapted from the studies by AMARAL (1998) and ENDRES (2006). These characteristics 

are summarized in Table 1.

Adapted data from the studies developed by AMARAL (1998) and ENDRES (2006). 

 

As a result of visual interpretation done on aerial photographs and cartographic documents, it 

was identified the following geoindicators: hydrographic net, topographic dividers and plant 

communities (natural and agricultural), and later it was elaborated the maps regarding the land 

use/occupation, drainage net and environmental dynamics. 

The map of the land use/occupation was drawn by the division of plant formations in the 

collection of images obtained, dated in 2005, based and adapted on the map legend of use and 

occupation of the Book of Basic Information for Environmental Planning: City of Jaboticabal 

(PISSARRA et al., 2009), obtained at the Photointerpretation Laboratory of the Department of 

Rural Engineering of the FCAV/UNESP. 

By counting the cells belonging to each category were measured the areas for each type of 

use, establishing the percentage of occupation. The measurements of the areas were performed 

using the AutoCad program, where the areas of each polygon of different uses and occupations 

were measured, being adopted as unit of measure the hectare (ha). 

 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

As a result of the analysis of images in cartographic documents was identified the 

hydrographic net and the natural and agricultural plant communities (Figures 1 and 2).

In Figure 1 we can observe that the area presents a net of drainage branched with minor 

extensions, forming a region with a number of about 70 sources. This fact proves that the region of 

the city of Monte Alto - SP, present an interesting geological region of topographic divide, and have 

an immeasurable wealth of water, which supplies a large portion of the population and various 

cities, reinforcing the importance of preserving these water sources in the area and the city as a 

whole, supporting the study of PISSARRA et al. (2009). 

The grazing areas (Figure 2) comprises the areas of clean pasture-field, whose primary 

difference from other analyzed coverage is the identification of the creeping appearance of the plant 

community installed, even when conditions of drained cultivated plain without identification of 

channel. In dirty field, the presence of irregular and sparse herbaceous vegetation is intercepted as 

abandonment of pasture area. The areas of clean field match with the presence of pasture in the 

form of culture, introducing granular texture much thinner and uniform than the areas of dirty field. 

These areas are predominantly located along the drainage net. 

The cultures present defined geometric shapes, in strips and variable aspect according to the 

age. Perennial cultures found in the hydrographic basin, such as orchards of guava, mango and 

citrus have regular geometric shape and highlighted contour. The structure of plants is arranged in 

defined, regular and individualized alignments, and rough to medium texture and dark green 

tonality (Figure 2). 

The other cultures have geometric shape with expression of varied contour, with low 

occurrence of carriers, having disordered structure and varied tonalities depending on the time of 

development. Regarding to the aspects, it was identified lines of level and terrace and the presence 

of geometric shapes that characterize the circular central pivot usually present in the onion culture, 

as noted in the field (Figure 2). The culture of sugarcane is predominant. This culture is distributed 

in relatively large areas, cut by carriers, with at least two stages of development, regular geometric 

shapes, flat, continuous and homogeneous roof. The grown sugarcane presented rougher texture 

than the new sugarcane with tonality of medium to light green, respectively. The structure was 

formed by the set of plots delimited by carriers which stand out to the associated aspects (Figure 2).  

The areas with infrastructure called rural buildings correspond to houses, sheds, barns and 

other farm buildings, with their surroundings with trees or clean. The dam areas correspond to the 

limits of the water surface along the drainage net, where there was the extremity with dam or in 

pond form (Figure 2).

FIGURE 3. Map of the environmental dynamic of the spring of drainage of the hydrographic 

microbasin of Rico Stream - SP/2005. 

 

When preparing the legend of Figure 2 and 3 it was used information from the visual 

interpretation of the images, the areas of arborous vegetation or forest comprise the areas of 

reminiscent forest, characterized by irregular borders and variable aspect with formation dominated 

by arboreal elements, composed of three layers of vegetation, with rough texture and dark green 

color. 

Generally, these formations were found near watercourses or near rivers and in areas with 

more accentuated slopes, in areas where the topography and soil type limit the use of agricultural 

cultures. 

The global set of data presented (Table 2 and Figure 2) confirms that the cultivation of 

sugarcane is the main form of land use in the spring of the hydrographic microbasin, with 26% of 

the total area, over the citrus, guava and mango orchards, with 9%, and onion with only 2%, 

cultures that previously occupied the largest area of the subbasin. 

The permanent crops presented higher expression in more irregular areas, associated with the 

presence of Argisols, and the onion and sugarcane plantations were concentrated in flatter areas. In 

the analyzed period, we denote the advantage presented by the economic culture of sugarcane. With 

the proximity of some sugar and alcohol mills, the sugarcane culture is occupying the space that 

was once occupied by other crops, especially perennial cultures such as citrus, guava and mango 

and annual traditional culture of the region, the onion. 

Another important fact is the low percentage of reforestation observed in the area, which is of 

1.46 ha. It is noteworthy that there is 375.04 ha of areas of permanent preservation and 302.87 ha of 

these are not preserved, i.e. it was analyzed only 72.17 ha (19.24% of the areas of permanent 

preservation) is composed of arborous vegetation or forest.

The predominantly more irregular relief occurs in Argisols PVA3 and PVA4 (wavy to strong 

wavy relief) and the same was observed by PISSARRA (2006). The spring microbasins have a 

higher degree of evolution of the hydrographic basin. In the region of the springs of drainage are all 

the microbasins of 2nd order of magnitude likely to transport material on a larger scale, tending to 

lower resistance to removal of the surface mantle, with more intense erosion process. The 

complexity is exacerbated in the subbasins of the sources of the Tijuco and Gambá Streams near the 

city of Monte Alto and source of Rico Stream. These data reinforce the importance of preserving 

the APP and the need for environmental adaptation of the spring of drainage, avoiding negative 

effects of human disturbance, such as erosion, siltation of rivers and other problems on water and 

soil quality of the area. 

Although they are areas of permanent preservation, protected by State and Federal legislation 

(OLIVEIRA et al., 2008; DELALIBERA et al., 2008 and NASCIMENTO et al., 2006), the riparian 

forests, cultivated plain areas and forest fragments of slope are suffering significant changes. The 

intense and disordered devastations are leading to the disappearance of several species of ecological 

and commercial importance, with serious impairment of their genetic potential. 

As noted, the panorama of areas of forests is critical, including forests, cerrados and fields. 

When there is change in this scenario and there is an environmental analysis of previously degraded 

area recovery, it is necessary to highlight and ennoble this fact (VALLE JUNIOR et al., 2010). 

The manual survey and mapping has high accuracy due to the rigorous detailing adopted in 

the data survey of land use and occupation, drainage net and arboreal vegetation in APPs, providing 

maximum approximation of the reality of the area, and therefore it is perfectly suited for small areas 

and regions with predominantly small farmers because it allows proposed models of adaptation 

economically viable. 

The data concerning the land use and occupation, drainage net and environmental dynamics 

of the hydrographic microbasin of the Rico Stream enable to conclude that there is a real need to 

preserve the area in question not only for its rich water resources, but also because of the 

aggravating factors as: strongly marked relief, soil type susceptible to erosion and low percentage of 

vegetation in areas of permanent preservation. Thus, the study and analysis of the spring area of the 

microbasin have the data for future models of proposed environmental adaptation in accordance 

with the current environmental legislation. 

 

CONCLUSIONS 

The study area present a surface of 2,141.53 ha and the results allowed to prove that the main 

culture is of sugarcane with 546.34 ha, followed by pastures with 251.22 ha, perennial cultures with 

191.71 ha, Eucalyptus with 57.31 ha and onion with 49.52 ha of the total area. There are 375.04 ha 

of areas of permanent preservation. Only 72.17 ha (19.24% of the areas of permanent preservation) 

are composed by arborous vegetation or forest, and of those, 302.87 ha need to be enriched and 

reforested with native vegetation of the region, according to the current legislation.
