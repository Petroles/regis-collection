ACKNOWLEDGMENT 

 

 

First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor Prof. Dr. Isabela Curado for 

sharing her knowledge on leadership and organizations and guiding me through the 

methodology. 

I would like to thank also Sciences Po Paris for giving me the opportunity to study two 

years at business schools in the USA and Brazil, while providing me a broad vision on 

social sciences, art and economy. My willingness to curiously explore the best of human 

behaviors across the world is the direct result of such a mix of international and 

interdisciplinary studies. 

I am also thankful to Thibaut Cournarie from Kea &amp;amp; Partners who helped me define the 

subject, to Alison Caille (Airbus), Jeremy Pauliat (Decathlon), Benoît Chéhère 

(Michelin), Ségolène Guitton (Imfusio), Alexandre Gerard (Inov’on), and Elias 

Buchwald (Cycloid) who took the time to send me extensive details about their fantastic 

work. 

When it comes to the ideas themselves, the book of Frédéric Laloux impacted me in a 

powerful way. On a personal basis, it led me to undertake a 10-day meditation retreat, 

made me discover non-violent communication, and gave me strong new convictions 

about leadership. It might seem trivial, but I am also grateful to him for allowing readers 

to pay “what feels right” for his book, I would not have accessed this significant book 

otherwise. 

Finally, I would like to express all my gratitude to my family and friends for their 

support and interest. 



 

 

 

 

 

 ABSTRACT 

 

This study addresses the current debate about the existence of an organizational model 

in liberated companies, which impacts its generalization and its transmission over time. 

Our purpose is to determine whether there is any consistency across the various 

organizational patterns in liberated companies. To reach this goal, 114 liberated 

organizations and twenty-five of their primary organizational patterns were identified 

in the literature. Then, a survey was sent to these 114 organizations to see how 

consistent these twenty-five patterns were across the universe. Data was collected from 

thirty-nine answers out of these 114 targeted companies. This data led to identifying 

eleven features that were present in most of the thirty-nine liberated companies who 

completed the questionnaire. Ten other patterns were found in the majority of the 

sample, while four patterns were identified as scarce. It was also determined that larger 

corporations operate differently. The analysis that was conducted will help leaders to 

understand the features of liberated companies. 

Keywords: Organizational structure, Organizational change, Self-management, 

Decision-making. 

  



 

 

 

 

 

RESUMO 

 

Esta dissertação aborda o debate sobre a existência de um modelo organizacional em 

empresas inovadoras ("liberated companies"). O objetivo é determinar se há qualquer 

consistência entre os vários padrões organizacionais de empresas inovadoras. Para 

responder essa questão, primeiro foi identificado na literatura 114 empresas inovadoras 

(liberated companies) e listado vinte e cinco características organizacionais presentes 

nessas empresas. Foi enviada uma pesquisa para as 114 empresas identificadas, para 

verificar a consistência (ou não) dos vinte e cinco características organizacionais. 

Foram coletados dados de 39 das 114 empresas. A análise dos resultados indicou que 

onze características estavam presentes na maioria das 39 empresas que completaram o 

questionário. Dez outros padrões foram encontrados na maioria da amostra, enquanto 

quatro padrões foram identificados como raros. Também foi identificado uma maneira 

diferente de funcionamento para empresas maiores. A análise realizada será útil para 

empresários que queiram compreender melhor quais são as características 

organizacionais presentes nas "liberated company.”

Introduction 

Liberated companies have received an increasing amount of attention in the past 

decade. A liberated company is defined by Isaac Getz (2009) as “an organizational form 

that allows employees complete freedom and responsibility to take actions they decide 

are best.” The concept is far from being new: William L. McKnight, the CEO of 3M in 

1924, was already claiming that “If you put fences around people, you get sheep. Give 

people the room they need” (GETZ, 2009, p. 6). Likewise, in the 1950s’ the American 

company WL Gore was already organized according to the principles of a liberated 

company. In France in the last ten years, the concept has been growing exponentially. 

This topic was made the subject of multiple conferences, press articles, a televised 

documentary and even a comic book published in 2016. I. Getz said in a conversation 

with Ricardo Semler, leader of the Brazilian liberated company Semco, that “right now, 

in France and French-speaking countries, I personally know probably about 250 

companies that we would call “liberated corporations”” (SEMLER, 2017, podcast). On 

what basis has this movement developed itself? 

This movement can be rather surprising since Geert Hofstede’s research on cross-

cultural management attributed to France a score on power distance of sixty-eight, 

which is higher than the world’s average of fifty-seven. People in societies with a large 

degree of power distance are indeed supposed to “accept a hierarchical order in which 

everybody has a place and which needs no further justification” (HOFSTEDE, 1984). 

Isaac Getz (2016) explains the spread of the liberated companies’ movement by the 

existence of an ecosystem supporting the development of liberated organizations in 

France and the willingness to overcome hierarchy precisely because it is strong. 

Jean-François Zobrist, who “liberated” Favi in the 1980s’, explains that the 

liberated companies model also provides “what the youth is looking for: knowing why, 

and be free about the how”. Frédéric Laloux, the author of the book Reinventing 

Organizations, also believes that this organizational form fits the Millennials, the 

generation that “has grown up in the disruptive world of the Internet, where people’s 

influence is based on contribution and reputation, not position” (LALOUX, 2014, p. 

139).

Gary Hamel adds that “managers today face a new set of problems, products of a 

volatile and unforgiving environment” (HAMEL, 2009, online), which is often 

designed by the acronym VUCA (Volatility, Uncertainty, 

Complexity, and Ambiguity). This vastly more complex environment calls for a new 

governance in organizations that would be more “adaptive, flexible, self-renewing, 

resilient, learning, and intelligent” (WHEATLEY &amp;amp; KELLNER-ROGERS, 1996, p. 1). 

These three elements seem to explain the recent exponential development of 

liberated organizations. In the opinion of I. Getz (2017), this movement will eventually 

spread to other companies, since “every couple of days” he hears “about a new company 

that’s become liberated”. In his opinion, based on research on social movements, if 

seven percent of the 2000 companies of more than 500 employees in France become 

liberated, that is to say about 140 companies, “the whole French economy will collapse 

into liberation.” 

However, the question of how to reach this point is at the center of a debate in the 

literature. I. Getz (2009) believes that there is no model and that it all depends on how 

the liberating leader will articulate the liberating philosophy in the cultural context of 

his company. Adopting a more prescriptive point of view, other authors like Tom Peters 

(1992) and Frédéric Laloux (2014) conceptualized an organizational system of liberated 

companies stating that the companies they studied had some patterns in common. 

Holacracy goes even further by claiming to have found an operating model of self-

management and to have started implementing it in more than 500 companies through 

a network of coaches. 

Regrettably, every study on the subject is empirical and based on qualitative 

research methods, which does not help to compare companies objectively. A 

quantitative research would therefore allow to compare companies in an unbiased 

manner and on a larger scale. Moreover, as it can be seen in the table below, the 

literature often uses the same examples. In three books selected for the literature review 

on liberating companies, many examples are common. Many academic case studies also 

cover the same examples.

From these examples studied, the authors withdraw different theories, fueling a debate 

within the literature on whether there is a model of liberated companies or not. This 

debate will be further explained in section 1.5. The current debate on the 

conceptualization of an organizational model, and can be summed up in the chart 

below: 



14 

 

 

 

 

 

To give insights to this debate, and to wider the span of companies researched, a 

quantitative study was conducted to answer the following research question: 

Is there a consistency of patterns in the organizational systems of liberated 

companies?  

To answer this question, 114 liberated organizations were identified, listed in 

Appendix 1. Based on this list, twenty-five main features within these enterprises were 

identified. Then a survey was sent to the organizations, to discover to what extent these 

features were consistent across the universe. From the thirty-nine answers collected 

from the survey, some consistent features within these companies were found. Among 

these thirty-nine companies, only four have already been studied in the literature. 

This study attempts to contribute to a better understanding of the growing 

movement of liberated companies, by displaying some regular patterns in the 

organizational structures implemented by the liberating leaders. Many entrepreneurs 

and intrapreneurs found inspiration in the well-documented testimonies of these 

liberating leaders, but they still believe its implementation is risky and complicated. 

They are therefore in need of more elements to start designing their organizations. 

To articulate this understanding, this dissertation progresses as follows: first, the 

existing literature was explored, focusing on the actual structures that may lead to 

disengagement and some processes to dismantle traditional organizations. Then the 

consequences that different worldviews on human nature have on organizations were 

addressed. Finally, the current debate on the idea of a model and its stakes for long-



15 

 

 

 

 

lasting organizations was explained. In the second chapter, the Methodology, is covered 

how this literature review was conducted, how the research was designed and how the 

results were analyzed. In the fourth chapter, the findings of our research are presented: 

which patterns were consistent, which patterns were less uniform and how larger 

companies deal differently with the liberation process. Finally, the last chapter 

concluded this study by expressing the main contributions, the limitations of this 

research and the opportunities for future work.

1. Structure and people 

To answer the research question, it is necessary to begin by identifying and 

exploring the concepts and existing theories directly related to the topic of this study. 

This chapter will first review what structures disengage employees, then how some 

authors presented the ideas of decentralization and delayering as a solution to this lack 

of engagement. Then, it will address how different theories on human nature, needs, 

and trust transition to different organizational systems. The last part of the chapter will 

explain the current debate in the literature on the conceptualization of an organizational 

model. 

1.1. Organizational models that disengage employees 

Some structures like Bureaucracy, Taylorism, and Hierarchy lead to the 

disengagement of employees, which in turn disadvantage organizations.  

1.1.1. Bureaucracy, Taylorism, and hierarchy 

Most organizations today are operating on the base of top-down, hierarchical, 

command and control mechanisms. To better understand the origins of these 

mechanisms, the concepts of Bureaucracy, Taylorism, and Hierarchy were reviewed. 

The Bureaucracy has been theorized by the German sociologist Max Weber as 

an organization based on procedures, policies, and hierarchy. The objective of 

bureaucracies is to show a “technical superiority” by forcing individuals into specified 

patterns of interaction. To achieve such a goal, organizations have to eliminate from the 

workplace “love, hatred, and all purely personal, irrational, and emotional elements 

which escape calculation.” In a word, it “develops the more perfectly the more it is 

dehumanized” (WEBER, 1978, p. 975). Clegg and Courpasson (2004) also 

demonstrated how the process of rationalization inherent in bureaucratization resulted 

in a diminution of freedom, by expecting employees to become obedient and by 

withdrawing any of their initiatives. Consequently, they assert that bureaucracy was 

unable to handle contemporary markets’ demand for constant innovation. 

Taylorism is another form of command and control organization that appeared 

during the industrial revolution. Its objective was to facilitate a shift from a crafting 



17 

 

 

 

 

system where artisans used to have control over the entire production process to a mass 

production model where employee perform scientifically segmented tasks, thus being 

more productive. This organization strongly limited the initiatives of employees, 

substituting it by the expertise of the design department and the white collars. In his 

book “The Principles of Scientific Management,” Frederick Winslow Taylor claims 

indeed that “in our scheme, we do not ask for the initiative of our men. All we want 

them is to obey orders we give them, do what we say, and do it quickly” (TAYLOR, 

1911, p. 11). Every manufacturing process is fragmented into simple elements, 

measured, standardized, and the management should seek to limit an individual job to 

a single task as far as possible, without any false movement. The part of the worker's 

activity which consists of preparing and organizing the work in his own way is also 

suppressed (LITTLER, 1978). I. Getz (2009, p. 143) described well the relation worker-

managers that resulted: “in this arrangement, the need for a “relationship” between 

company and employee is limited: Workers are given orders and told what to do and 

how to do it. They are measured—and controlled— according to whether they follow 

them.” Therefore, Taylor contributed significantly to the spread of mass production that 

Ford already started with its moving assembly line. 

More recently, Ronay, Greenaway, Anicich, &amp;amp; Galinsky (2012) wrote an article 

named "The path to glory is paved with hierarchy.” They start their article by an 

analogy with nature: studies have found indeed that in a group of chicken, the best egg 

producers are also very competitive birds. Therefore, chicken fight over food, space, 

and territory, which in turn drive egg production down. The authors intend to prove in 

their study that for humans as well, having too many high-status individuals in an equal 

group can create status contests, people competing for greater control, which in turn 

would increase discord and decrease the team productivity. 

To prove this hypothesis, the researchers conducted experiments with different 

groups of high-power, low-power, and baseline participants. The authors found that the 

group with a mix of the three groups, identified as hierarchically differentiated groups, 

were more productive than groups of all high-power individuals and groups of all low-

power individuals, especially in environments characterized by high levels of 

procedural interdependence. 



18 

 

 

 

 

They conclude that unequal distribution of power within groups, i.e., 

hierarchical differentiation, facilitates the coordination of individuals’ efforts and 

ultimately benefits the productivity of the group. Therefore, they argue that “despite the 

overt appeal of egalitarian social structures, humans have an enduring implicit 

preference for hierarchy,” which they define as “a universal default for human social 

organization.” 

Bureaucracy, Taylorism, and hierarchy may have led to significant increase in 

productivity. For example, Taylor doubled the production of the company Bethlehem 

Steel after introducing its methods. However, as the founder and former CEO of Visa 

Dee Hock puts it, “hierarchical command and control pyramids of power, whether 

political, social, educational or commercial were aberrations of the Industrial Age, 

antithetical to the human spirit, destructive of the biosphere and structurally contrary to 

the whole history and methods of physical and biological evolution” (HOCK, 1994, p. 

5).  

There is indeed a consensus to point out these methods as outdated. F. Laloux 

(2014) explains that humans evolve in stages, where everything changes at once, 

including organizational models. He describes in his book the evolution of different 

organizational stages: First, “amber” organizations, like the military or the church, were 

characterized by highly formal roles and top-down command and control. Then 

appeared “orange” organizations: they managed through objectives, valorized 

innovation, accountability, and meritocracy. Later on, “green” organizations were 

designed, where “within the classic pyramid structure,” managers “focus on culture and 

empowerment to achieve extraordinary employee motivation.” The liberated 

companies that he calls “Teal” organizations, would be part of the next stage of 

evolution. However, today most organizations are still at the amber, orange or green 

stage, and therefore create many pathologies in the workplace. 

The problem is that these drawbacks are difficult to measure. F. Laloux admits 

that “economies of scale” do arise when a support department take into account more 

responsibilities, which “can easily be estimated in hard dollar figures.” However, on 

the other side of the coin, he asserts that “it is virtually impossible to peg a number to 

the diseconomies of motivation” (LALOUX, 2014, p. 73). I. Getz (2009, p. 36) is 

referring to these diseconomies as “the costs that your accountant is not telling you 



19 

 

 

 

 

about.” G. Hamel, a professor at the London Business School, claims as well that the 

“cost of tyranny” is very costly when the management narrows an individual’s scope 

of authority. However, he also describes these costs in vague and unmeasurable terms: 

“you shrink the incentive to dream, imagine, and contribute” (2011, p. 1). Nonetheless, 

these descriptions are all pointing out the lack of engagement of employees, which 

could be the major consequences of these organizational models. 

1.1.2. Lack of engagement around the globe 

Schaufeli et al. (2002, p. 74) defined the engagement of employees as a positive, 

fulfilling, work-related state of mind that is characterized by vigor, dedication, and 

absorption. Vigor is characterized by “high levels of energy and mental resilience while 

working” and “persistence even in the presence of difficulties.” Dedication refers to 

experiencing “a sense of significance, enthusiasm, inspiration, pride, and challenge.” 

Finally, absorption is characterized by “being fully concentrated and engrossed in one’s 

work, whereby time passes quickly, and one has difficulties with detaching oneself from 

work.” In this section, we will analyze the proven lack of engagement of employees 

and how it affects their productivity. 

Two books quoted in this study are both referring to what the scholar Gary 

Hamel calls ‘the shame of management”: the proven lack of engagement among 

employees, in every part of the world. The first book, written in 2009 by the French 

professor Isaac Getz and the Wall Street Journal journalist Brian Carney, Freedom Inc., 

quotes a study from Gallup called “Gallup Study: Feeling Good Matters in the 

Workplace” (GALLUP, 2006). This study is regularly conducted in 142 countries and 

surveys 230,000 full-time and part-time employees. In an updated version of 2013, it 

reveals that worldwide, only thirteen percent working for an organization are engaged 

in their work and “work with passion and feel a profound connection to their company.” 

Among the remaining eighty-seven percent, sixty-three percent are not engaged, which 

means they “put time –but not energy or passion- into their work,” and twenty-four 

percent are actively disengaged. These twenty-four percent are particularly 

preoccupying since they are not just unhappy at work: they “try to undo” “whatever the 

engaged do” (GALLUP, 2013, p. 17). 



20 

 

 

 

 

In 2006, the results appeared to be better, since twenty-seven percent of 

employees were engaged, fifty-nine percent were not engaged, and fourteen percent 

were actively disengaged (GALLUP, 2006, apud GETZ, 2009, p. 33). 

The second book, Reinventing Organization, was written in 2014 by a former 

Belgian consultant, Frédéric Laloux. He quotes a survey conducted by Tower Watson 

in 2012, questioning 32,000 workers in 29 countries. The updated version of this survey 

from 2014 is more optimistic than Gallup results, finding that four employees out of ten 

are “highly engaged”. The other sixty percent are either “detached” (seventeen percent), 

“unsupported” (nineteen percent), or as Gallup found out, “disengaged” (twenty-four 

percent) (WATSON, 2014). 

Unlike the Gallup Survey, the results became slightly better over time: In 2012, 

thirty-five percent of employees were engaged, forty-three percent were detached or 

disengaged, and twenty-two percent were feeling unsupported (WATSON, 2012, apud 

LALOUX, 2014, p. 62). 

Another interesting insight of this book is to explain that such lack of 

engagement does not concern only employees at the bottom of the pyramid. Indeed, 

based on his work as a consultant and coach, the author asserts that “life at the top of 

the pyramids isn’t much more fulfilling” since top managers also suffer from “the 

power games, the politics, and the infighting” (LALOUX, 2014, p. 4). 

1.1.3. The negative consequences of lacking engagement 

Whether it reaches sixty or eighty-three percent, lack of engagement is proven 

to be high in the workplace and is also proven to have substantial negative consequences 

on various dimensions. The Gallup studies from 2013 shows that the “median 

differences between top-quartile and bottom quartile units” in terms of engagement is 

“twenty-five percent in turnover (high-turnover organizations), sixty-five percent in 

turnover (low-turnover organizations), forty-eight percent in safety incidents, twenty-

eight percent in shrinkage, thirty-seven percent in absenteeism, forty-one percent in 

patient safety incidents, and forty-one percent in quality (defects)”. 

Turnover, absenteeism, safety, quality, all these dimensions eventually impact 

the productivity. And this link between the productivity and the engagement of the 

workforce has also been directly studied. At the scale of a company, G. H. Seijts and 



21 

 

 

 

 

D. Crim (2006) studied the example of the “New Century Financial Corporation”, a US 

company that found that “account executives in the wholesale division who were 

actively disengaged produced twenty-eight percent less revenue than their colleagues 

who were engaged”. On a larger scale, a study conducted by Towers Perrin-ISR (2007) 

using data from over 360,000 employees from forty-one companies in the world’s ten 

largest economies, found that over three years, companies with highly engaged 

employees increased their operating margin by 3.74 percent and net profit by 2.06 

percent on average. On the other side, low engagement companies decreased their 

operating margin by 2 percent and their net profit by 1.38 percent. 

Once one acknowledges that a large part of organizations is comprised of 

unengaged employees and that they underperform compared to engaged employees, 

managers try to re-engage these employees. For example, the CEO of the liberated 

Indian company HCL, Vineet Nayar, implemented the program “Employees First”. He 

explained in an article in the journal Forbes in 2010: “What we want at HCL is passion. 

We want people to be burning up with a desire to pursue their interests. Fascinated by 

their assignments. Jumping out of their skins with excitement about what’s next. 

Eagerly pursuing better solutions and new initiatives.” Nevertheless, the question 

remains on how to achieve the goal of re-engaging employees. 

1.2. Deconstructing these outdated organizational models 

One way managers have found to achieve this target is to deconstruct the 

existing organizational structures like “standardization, specialization, hierarchy, and 

so on” that are “inadequate for the challenges that lie ahead” (Barsh, 2008, p. 9). This 

deconstruction has been done through processes called decentralization or delayering 

(also known as flattening). 

1.2.1. Decentralizing the hierarchy  

Peter Drucker published in 1954 his book “The Practice of Management,” in 

which he explains that “so much of what we call management consists in making it 

difficult for people to work.” In this book, he presents an alternative, based on the 

consulting project he implemented with Alfred P. Sloan at General Motors in 1943. In 

this project, they decentralized the hierarchy, by letting the Direction Committee define 

the general strategy and giving each Business Unit substantial operational autonomy. 



22 

 

 

 

 

From this experience, he conceptualized a theory of management by objectives. 

In this theory, objectives are derived from the goal of the company. Then, the objectives 

for the managers are defined by “the contributions he has to make to the success of the 

larger unit of which he is part.” At the level of his unit, each manager set the objectives 

for its unit himself. However, these objectives can be approved or not by higher 

managers. The “greatest advantage” of such a management by objectives is “that it 

makes it possible for a manager to control his own performance” (DRUCKER, 1974, 

p. 439). Indeed, once managers know their goals, they are able to measure themselves 

their results toward these goals. Such a process allows therefore to “substitute 

management by self-control for management by domination.” (DRUCKER, 1954, p. 

113). 

Such a management by self-control implies that measurements, i.e., “reports and 

procedures”, are not seen as “an instrument of control from above” and are considered 

instead as “the tools of the man that fills them out” (DRUCKER, 1954, p. 117). Thus, 

superiors should not have access to the information collected. Peter Drucker gives the 

example of General Electrics, where auditors study every business unit at least once a 

year, but where the reports go only to the managers of the unit and not to their boss.  

These principles, claims Peter Drucker, lead “to a stronger motivation,” a 

“desire to do the best, and better performance,” along with “tremendous advance in 

effectiveness and performance of management” (DRUCKER, 1954, p. 113). The author 

Mc Gregor also praised in 1960 the virtuous circle of a decentralization process. He 

stated that “a decentralized organization provides an environment in which the 

individual, through taking greater responsibility for his own behavior, obtains intrinsic 

rewards in the form of ego and self-actualization satisfactions, which in turn encourage 

him to take still more responsibility and thus to grow” (Mc GREGOR, 1960, p. 194). 

In 1970, Robert Townsend published “Up the organization”, a book that has 

been for fifty years in the first position of the must-read book list at Wharton business 

school. In this book, the former CEO of Avis argues that “most people in big companies 

today are administered, not led”, and have been “slaves to the rules of private and public 

hierarchies” (TOWNSEND, 1970, p. 27). He came to a conclusion similar to Peter 

Drucker’s management by objectives, arguing that people “don't have to be forced or 

threatened. If they commit themselves to mutual objectives, they'll drive themselves 



23 

 

 

 

 

more effectively than you can drive them” (TOWNSEND, 1970, p. 93). In his view a 

real leader “delegates as many important matters as he can,” because “that creates a 

climate in which people grow” (TOWNSEND, 1970, p. 23).  

1.2.2. Delayering the hierarchy  

In this view, managers still have an active role to play in the organization. Tom 

Peters (1992) writes in his book Liberation Management: “it’s not enough to 

decentralize and create business units on paper.” The management guru argues instead 

that “the middle management layers and functional staffs must be virtually destroyed if 

autonomy is to get much beyond lip service.” The literature presented in this section 

suggest therefore to remove layers of hierarchy between the highest and lowest levels 

of organizations, a process known as delayering or flattening.  

R. Townsend (1970) already advised firing the Personnel Department, a 

department he saw as an abdication of responsibility. Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a Harvard 

professor that developed the concept of empowerment, was also in favor of some 

delayering. Tom Peters, recalls in his book a conversation he had with her in 1989, 

when “she flatly declared that tomorrow’s winning firms will have almost no middle 

managers” (PETERS, 1992, p. 145). Gary Hamel published in 2011 an article 

evocatively named “First, Let’s Fire All Managers.” He explains in this paper that as 

they grow, companies need “managers to manage the managers” and therefore multiply 

the layers of management. The author asserts that having more layers means slower 

responses and “increase the risk of large, calamitous decisions” (HAMEL, 2009, p. 11). 

As an answer to these hierarchical levels multiplications, he advocates to “limit the 

fallout from top-down authority structures” (HAMEL, 2009, online) and claims that 

“increasingly, the work of management won’t be done by managers. It will be pushed 

out to the periphery. It will be embedded in systems” (BARSH, 2008, p. 3). 

1.2.3. The persistence of a controlling hierarchy 

Decentralizing and delayering appear therefore as two effective solutions to 

deconstruct the structures that demotivate employees. However, a recent paper from 

Julie Wulf (2012) is withdrawing mitigated conclusions on these two movements, 

arguing that delayering does not necessarily mean decentralization and delegation of 

authority and that it can have the opposite effect from their intention. 



24 

 

 

 

 

First, the author shows that companies delayered over the period 1986 to 1998. 

This delayering concern mostly the middle management, through the suppression of 

“key senior management positions that served as intermediaries” (WULF, 2012, p. 8). 

For example, the Chief Operating Officer (COO) has become increasingly rare: 

companies with a COO decreased by twenty percent during this period of 1986-1998. 

More generally, the number of positions between division heads and CEOs declined by 

about twenty-five percent from 1986 to 1999. The number of positions reporting 

directly to the CEO increased from 4.5 in 1986 to almost 7 in 1999. 

One could think that such reduction of the middle management would have led 

to subordinates having more autonomy since the CEO is time constrained and therefore 

has less time to allocate to each subordinate. If CEOs pushed less their decisions down, 

this would be a form of decentralization. However, Wulf inferred from this delayering 

that CEOs had consequently a greater span of control. Delayering could also mean that 

CEOs have more direct connections deeper in the organization, and are thus more 

involved in the decision-making. In that scenario, a “hands-on CEO” would “exercises 

more control and pushes decisions up” (WULF, 2012, p. 11), which would be a form 

of centralization. 

To prove her point, the author examined the salaries of functional managers. It 

appeared that as they move to the top, they get paid more. Suggesting that a higher paid 

is correlated with more decision rights, Wulf concludes that “functional managers made 

more decisions as they moved closer to the CEO, while division managers made less”. 

This means that functional managers make decisions previously taken by the division 

managers. 

To gain even more insight on this idea of centralizing or decentralizing, Julie 

Wulf went to interview seven CEOs of large U.S. Fortune 500 firms. She found out that 

“flattening is not about delegation of decision-making to subordinates and a hands-off 

role for the CEO. In fact, the most consistent message from the CEOs was that they had 

changed the structure of their executive team and broadened their span of control to get 

closer to the businesses.” 

Therefore, this article showed that flattening actually transferred some decision 

rights from lower-level division managers to functional managers at the top. With CEOs 



25 

 

 

 

 

and functional managers becoming more involved in internal operations and 

subordinate activities, companies actually became more centralized, with corporate-

wide decisions and control being made at the top. So if delayering is not enough, more 

exploration is needed to examine how to re-engage employees in the decision process. 

1.3. The need for values to re-engage employees 

In addition to deconstructing existing structures, which does not suppress 

centralization as Wulf (2012) demonstrated, Mc Gregor (1960, p. 18) claims that the 

“real need is for a new theory, change assumptions, more understanding of the nature 

of human behavior.” Indeed, the beliefs of managers regarding human nature strongly 

influence the way they involve employees in the decision-making process, give them 

autonomy and liberty.  

1.3.1. The importance of the managers’ worldview 

Douglas McGregor was the first to link the vision managers have of their 

employees and the organizational structure of a company. He developed these ideas 

first in his article “The Human Side of Enterprise” (McGregor, 1957) and then in his 

book with the same title (McGregor, 1960). According to this MIT professor, the 

question is not how to motivate people, but rather how to build an environment where 

people self-motivate themselves. And the way managers make such environment, such 

leadership style, and such organizational model, is based on assumptions, 

generalizations, and hypotheses about human nature and human behavior, that is to say, 

on a theory. McGregor distinguishes two main theories that he called theory X and 

theory Y. 

On the one hand, theory X assumes that employees work as little as possible, 

have no ambition and are indifferent to organization needs. Therefore, they need to be 

managed with “carrots” that is to say incentives like pay and bonuses and with “sticks”, 

which are controls, threats, and discipline. This view assumes that employees prefer to 

be led so that they can avoid responsibility. Frederick Winslow Taylor was indeed 

asserting that “the natural instinct and tendency of men is to take it easy” (TAYLOR, 

1911, p. 19). 

On the other hand, theory Y assumes that people find work enjoyable, and want 

to achieve higher-order needs through meaningful work. Having a meaningful work 



26 

 

 

 

 

involves taking decisions, providing inputs, making significant intellectual 

contributions, having responsibilities. Employees’ potentialities as human beings are 

therefore partially utilized, and manager should further tape in their capacities of 

imagination and creativity. Then, explains McGregor, every employee “will exercise 

self-direction and self-control in the service of objectives to which he is committed” 

(Mc GREGOR, 1960, p. 227) and “the individual will grow into what he is capable of 

becoming” (Mc GREGOR, 1960, p. 197). 

These two very different worldviews can explain the conclusion of Wulf (2012) 

that controlling hierarchies persists. Mc Gregor (1960) states indeed that “the needed 

changes simply cannot occur as long as the underlying assumptions are those of Theory 

X”. Therefore, “even fruitful concepts like those of delegation and decentralization are 

warped completely out of shape when they are applied within this theoretical 

framework” of theory X (Mc GREGOR, 1960, p. 156). 

1.3.2. From the managers’ worldview to employees’ needs and decision-

making 

On the other hand, how are operating the managers that have a Theory Y in 

mind? For Mc Gregor, such managers focus less on “manufacturing techniques” and 

more on “controlling the climate and the fertility of the soil, and on methods of 

cultivation” (Mc GREGOR, 1960, p. 192). Robert Townsend (1970, p. 96) has a similar 

metaphorical recommendation: “Provide the climate and proper nourishment and let the 

people grow themselves. They’ll amaze you.” The reasoning of an employee is that 

“unless I perceive that you can somehow affect my ability to satisfy my needs, you 

cannot influence my behavior” (Mc GREGOR, 1960, p. 20). The remaining question is 

how is the soil going to be fertile, what is a proper nourishment, what are the needs of 

employees? 

According to Maslow (1943), the Hierarchy of Needs suggests that people are 

motivated by physiological (food and water), safety (physical and economic), 

belongingness (friendship, love, social interaction), esteem (achievement and 

recognition), and self-actualization (realizing your full potential) needs. However, 

explains I. Getz (2009), this view sees the human being as motivated to eliminate the 

tension of unsatisfied psychological needs. 



27 

 

 

 

 

I. Getz (2009) explains that Deci &amp;amp; Ryan had a different view: they pictured 

people as programmed for mastery and happiness. They developed a theory called the 

self-determination theory, which focuses on the needs of employees. It states that 

employees have three intrinsic needs: competence (“succeeding at optimally 

challenging tasks and being able to attain desired outcomes”), autonomy (“experiencing 

choice and feeling like the initiator of one’s own actions”) and relatedness on the job 

(which concerns “establishing a sense of mutual respect and reliance with others”) 

(BAARD, DECI, RYAN, 2004, p. 2). Therefore, in addition to the organizational 

structures, a way to get employees engaged and “self-motivated” is to give them these 

three “nutriments.” 

Baard, Deci &amp;amp; Ryan (2004) found out that the satisfaction of these three intrinsic 

needs is also strongly related (r= 0.58) to the perception of the degree of autonomy 

supportiveness of the managers. Therefore, the best way to give employees these three 

needs is to involve them in the decision process. 

A recent study by Travis L. Russ (2011) demonstrated that one of the outcomes 

of managers having a theory X or a theory Y view is how they involve employees in 

decisions typically made by managers. On a study of 144 managers, he compared the 

“propensity for participative decision-making scale” designed by Parnell and Bell 

(1994) with the “Theory X and Y inventory” designed by Sager (2008). The results 

revealed that “theory Y managers perceive a positive consequence of soliciting 

employee participation on their supervisory power and organizational effectiveness”. 

On the other hand, theory X managers consider that involving others in making 

organizational decisions “negatively impacts their power” (RUSS, 2011, p. 1). 

1.3.3. The ideas behind empowerment, autonomy, and liberty 

So, the ideas of Theory Y and decision-making are inherently interrelated. The 

authors who theorized the notions of empowerment, autonomy and liberated 

organizations indeed have in mind strong assumptions about human nature. 

In the 1990s’, Rosabeth Moss Kanter constructed her theory of empowerment. 

Considering the need for meaningful work described by the theory Y, she explained 

how organizations could empower employees. Such empowerment implies a change in 

management, insofar as Kanter acknowledges that “giving up control is threatening.” 



28 

 

 

 

 

She proposed two solutions to face this challenge. The first is for managers to trust their 

employees and have less skepticism about their abilities. The second is to believe that 

“by empowering others, a leader does not decrease his power; instead he may increase 

it” (KANTER, 1979, online).  

Indeed, liberated companies see employees as “reasonable people that can be 

trusted to do the right thing” (LALOUX, 2014, p. 97). Ricardo Semler built his 

company on this idea of trust. He explains that “most companies suffer from what I call 

boarding school syndrome. They treat their employees like children” (SEMLER, 1999, 

p. 7), whereas in their private lives, “at the bank, at their children’s schools, with family 

and among friends”, people are considered as adults (SEMLER, 2004, p. 9). So, at 

Semco, they hire and treat people as trustworthy and responsible adults (SEMLER, 

1989). G. Hamel (2011) deplores as well how people as consumers have the freedom 

to pay $20,000 or more on a new car but have to ask many permissions to spend 

amounts like a $500 office chair as employees. 

As for the second idea of Kanter that empowering the bottom increases the 

power of the top managers, it is also a point view broadly shared. F. Laloux thus invites 

managers to “acknowledge that we are all interconnected,” which will lead to 

empowering employees since “the more powerful you are, the more powerful I can 

become” (LALOUX, 2014, p. 135). The founder of Holacracy, Brian Robertson, also 

expresses this idea clearly: “Now I get to be a hero just like I did before, but now 

everybody else gets to be a hero too” (LALOUX, 2014, p. 245). This notion of 

empowerment was also well expressed by David Marquet, the Captain of a US nuclear 

submarine he liberated: “I don’t care how smart you are, on my submarine, I’ve got 135 

thinking, active, passionate, creative, proactive, taking initiative people. It’s a tidal 

wave!” (Inno-Versity, 2013, video). 

In addition to sharing this idea of trust and believing that empowering others 

will increase managers’ power, liberated companies go further by giving liberty to their 

employees. Indeed, I. Getz asserts that giving only a bit of autonomy is a form of limited 

trust (BYS, 2016). Likewise, Frédéric Laloux quotes Albert Einstein who said that 

“everything that is really great and inspiring is created by the individual who can labor 

in freedom” (LALOUX, 2014, p. 86). 

  



29 

 

 

 

 

The leaders of liberated companies also stress this idea of freedom in their 

enterprises. Chris Rufer, the founder of Morning Star, states that “if people are free, 

they will be drawn to what they really like as opposed to being pushed toward what 

they have been told to like” (HAMEL, 2011, p. 4). Freedom is also one of the four 

values of WL Gore. The company highlights that they allow to employees “the freedom 

to grow beyond” what they are doing, expecting employees to actually use this freedom 

(HARDER, TOWNSEND, 2017, p. 6). Ricardo Semler, the leader of Semco, also said 

about his employees that “they can do whatever the hell they want. It's up to them to 

see the connection between productivity and profit and to act on it” (SEMLER, 1989, 

p. 9). 

1.4. The new organizational structures emerging from these 

values 

Once traditional hierarchies are dismantled, and managers have a strong trust in 

employees’ capacities (having the theory Y in mind), they create an adequate 

organizational structure. First, we will see that different type of hierarchies naturally 

emerge, and then we will analyze how companies built structures around these natural 

hierarchies. We will explore the case studies of organizations like WL Gore, Semco, 

Sun Hydraulics or Morning Star, before analyzing how authors like Tom Peters, Isaac 

Getz, and Frederic Laloux conceptualized such organizational structures. 

1.4.1. The emergence of natural hierarchies 

Decentralizing, delayering, empowering, giving employees autonomy or even 

liberty, all these ideas do not mean the end of any hierarchy. Therefore, they are not 

necessarily against the view of the article previously analyzed from Ronay, Greenaway, 

Anicich, &amp;amp; Galinsky (2012) which claims that “the path to glory is paved with 

hierarchy.” 

In liberated companies, having no hierarchy of bosses over subordinate leave 

space for “other natural and spontaneous hierarchies to spring up” (LALOUX, 2014, p. 

68). The case study about WL Gore explains how such a process happen: “If an 

associate could convince co-workers a project was worth pursuing and gain individual 

commitments, the associates formed a team, began experimenting and created new 

products for the company” (HARDER, TOWNSEND, 2017, p. 5/6). Ricardo Semler 



30 

 

 

 

 

also believed that if one “put ten people together” and “don’t appoint a leader,” “you 

can be sure that one will emerge” (SEMLER, 1989, online), based on competencies and 

natural leadership. 

Fréderic Laloux describes such processes as “fluid” and “actualization” 

hierarchies where what matters is recognition, influence, and skills. However, even if 

such natural hierarchies emerge, some other structures are still needed in liberated 

organizations. 

1.4.2. The structure of pioneers’ organizations  

The story of Semco, a Brazilian success story, has been depicted in many papers 

and case studies, often by its former CEO himself, Ricardo Semler (1989, 1994, and 

1999). When Semco reached 3 000 employees, it had deconstructed the traditional 

hierarchical structure as described in section 1.2: They had no organization charts, no 

five-year plans, no dress code, no fixed workplace, no human resources department and 

only three levels of management (one corporate level and two operating levels at the 

manufacturing units). It also organized itself according to three main principles: 

democracy, profit sharing, and information sharing.  

At WL Gore, an American company of 8 600 associates, the structure is called 

the lattice. The Cambridge dictionary defines a lattice as “a structure made from strips 

of wood or other material that cross over each other.” Harder and Townsend described 

in a case study from 2017 how the company also deconstructed the traditional rigid 

hierarchy, by having no fixed or assigned authority, no organizational structure, no job 

titles, and by having sponsors instead of bosses. The way they organize themselves is 

therefore through natural leadership, person-to-person communication and by having 

tasks and functions organized through commitments. 

Sun Hydraulics Corporation implemented a liberated structure under the 

management of Bob Koski (KAFTAN, BARNES, 1991). In one of his first meeting at 

Sun Hydraulics, he told the employees: “I do not know what to do, but I sure know 

what not to do” (GETZ, 2009, p. 67). Therefore, Sun Hydraulics does not have a proper 

hierarchy, no titles, no formal job descriptions, no special benefits, no reporting 

relationships, no close supervision, and no "intimidation functions" like purchasing 

agent or quality inspectors. Instead, they implemented open communications, what they 



31 

 

 

 

 

called group self-management and the idea of having joint decision-making including 

the person(s) most affected by the decision. They also have a written explicit philosophy 

and open offices, even for the CEO. 

Gary Hamel describes the organization implemented by Morning Star as “the 

opposite of anarchy” (HAMEL, 2011, p. 4). This American company was able to 

construct an efficient organization through various principles. The first one is to go 

further the management by objective designed by Peter Drucker. Instead of having a 

unit manager defining his goals, every employee is setting his own goals, by “drawing 

up a personal mission statement that outlines how he or she will contribute to the 

company’s goal of “producing tomato products and services which consistently achieve 

the quality and service expectations of our customers”.” (HAMEL, 2011, p. 3). With 

such a personal mission statement, named the CLOU, Colleague Letter of 

Understanding, every employee has “an operating plan for fulfilling one’s mission” 

(HAMEL, 2011, p. 4). Morning Star also operates with transparent data across the 

company, the consultation of colleagues for decisions, a conflict resolution processes, 

peer review, and elected compensation committee to ensure that pay aligns with value 

added. 

1.4.3. The academic conceptualization of these new structures 

I. Getz describes liberated organizations as being “highly disciplined—actually, 

self-disciplined” (GETZ, 2009, p. 53). These are some of the features he encountered 

within the organizations he studied: 

• No organizational charts 

• No reserved parking or corner offices for executives 

• No assigned executive offices 

• No fixed seating arrangement  

• No managers 

• No time clocks 

• No titles or ranks 

• No Human Resources department 

• No budgets 

• No Finance department 

• No long-term planning processes. 

• Allow employees to pick their leaders 

• Allow employees to choose their own job descriptions 



32 

 

 

 

 

• Allow employees to set their own work times 

• Allow employees to set their own salaries 

 

Tom Peters also analyzed the work of employees in companies without 

pyramidal hierarchies. He compares the job of a “corner grocer”, who is a 

“businessperson”, with the job of a “line worker”, who is “fill[ing] a job slot”. 

According to the author, “emerging organizational forms will permit – and the market 

will demand- that each employee be […] turned into a business person” (PETERS, 

1992, p. 227). He also uses examples to describe these emerging organizational forms: 

In the company Titeflex, a global leader in fluid management products, teams are 

comprised of six to ten persons, with “most all the company’s old staff functions in its 

midst”, like accounting and quality control. Each team is a “genuine profit and loss 

center” and “goes out to visit customers and vendors on its own initiative”, handling 

“orders from start to finish.” “That’s liberation” concludes T. Peters. He also takes the 

example of Johnsonville Sausage, where workgroups are comprised of about a dozen 

people, and they “recruit, hire, evaluate and fire on their own,” “regularly acquire new 

skills as they see fit,” “formulate, then track and amend, their own budget”, “handle 

quality control”, “make capital investment proposals as needed,” and “take on the task 

of constantly improving every process and product”. Also, “performance evaluations 

are done by the employees,” then discussed with their “coach” to eventually help 

calculating profit sharing (PETERS, 1992, p. 238). 

He then extracts from these examples a target organization and describes some 

features that lead to what he calls “Businessing”: 

• Extensive cross-training 

• Budget responsibility 

• Ownership of assets 

• Substantial spending authority 

• “The power to act on your own initiative and involve other functions without 

prior approval or second-guessing” (PETERS, 1992, p. 235) 

• “Responsibility for performing 80 or 90 percent of tasks that used to require 

numerous steps, numerous department, and authority from several levels of 

management” (PETERS, 1992, p. 235) 

• Access to all financial information, access to extensive nonfinancial info 

• Access to expert systems, membership in a knowledge management structure 

• Global university (access to electronic bulletin boards, external databases) 



33 

 

 

 

 

Frédéric Laloux also draws from examples studied an organizational model. He 

presents in his book what he calls “Teal Organizations”, organizations based on three 

principles: self-management (a “system based on peer relationships, without the need 

for either hierarchy or consensus”), wholeness (“practices that invite us to reclaim our 

inner wholeness and bring all of who we are to work”, instead of a narrow 

“professional” self”), and evolutionary purpose (“instead of trying to predict and 

control the future, members of the organization are invited to listen in and understand 

what the organization wants to become, what purpose it wants to serve.”) (LALOUX, 

2014, p. 56). Within this model, he explains that “self-organization is the life force of 

the world, thriving on the edge of chaos with just enough order to funnel its energy, but 

not so much as to slow down adaptation and learning” (LALOUX, 2014, p. 134). The 

self-management depicted organizes itself through the following features: 

• Self-organizing teams  

• Coaches w/o P&amp;amp;L responsibility when needed  

• Almost no staff functions 

• Coordination and meetings ad hoc when needs arise  

• Radically simplified project management, minimum plans &amp;amp; budgets  

• Fluid and granular roles 

• Decision-making fully decentralized (advice process)  

• Transparent real-time information sharing including financials  

• Anybody can spend any amount of money provided advice process is respected  

• Formal multi-step conflict resolution process  

• Focus on Team performance, peer-based process for individual appraisals  

• Self-set salaries with peer calibration, no bonus, profit sharing 

 

Holacracy is another model of self-management. It is the most operating one, 

ready to be adopted and fully documented. The concept was developed by Brian 

Robertson at Ternary Software in the 1990s’, and is now spread through certified 

coaches, the “network of Holacracy Providers.” They claim that now 500+ 

organizations are using this model. Holacracy is based on a minimum set of practices, 

described in a constitution. F. Laloux describes in his book this model based on roles, 

circles, and a specific governance: 

• People do not have a job, but fill a number of granular roles 



34 

 

 

 

 

• On the company’s intranet is a file where colleagues can “rate” every role they 

currently fill 

• Each individual’s commitments are visible to everybody at the company 

• Governance meetings are specific meetings where only questions related to 

roles and collaboration are to be discussed 

• A group of roles constitutes a “circle”.  

• “Circles” are fully autonomous to discuss and decide on how roles will be 

allocated within the team, what commitment team members make to each other, 

and so on. 

• Circle and sub-circle are bound together by a double link, not by a boss-

subordinate relationship. 

1.5. The current debate on the conceptualization of an 

organizational model 

As we have just seen, scholars conceptualized a typical organizational structure 

from examples of liberated companies. However, they withdraw very different 

conclusions on how prescriptive this model should be. We will see in this section why 

such conceptualizations raise concerns regarding generalization and perpetuation of the 

concept of liberated companies. 

1.5.1. A conceptualized model contributes to the transmission of leadership 

over time 

At the end of his book, I. Getz (2009) asks a question without actually answering 

it: "If it takes a leader with extraordinary qualities to build a free company, is it possible 

for that environment to outlive its creator?" The same question appears at the end of the 

Harvard Business School case study about the liberated company Sun Hydraulics 

Corporation (1991): the authors of the case wonder whether “Sun's organizational 

practices” are an “exportable method of management” or “simply a reflection of one 

person's […] management style?” 

It appeared that at least six companies that once were liberated companies went 

back to stronger hierarchy after a change of ownership or the departure of the CEO. 

Two of the companies studied in the book of F. Laloux, “AES” and “BSO/Origin” both 

“achieved spectacular results during the two decades when they operated with a number 

of Teal practices and structures; however, under new leadership, they have reverted to 

more conventional management approaches” (LALOUX, 2014, p. 59). F. Laloux tells 



35 

 

 

 

 

the story of the buy-out of BSO/Origin by Phillips, which resulted according to its 

former CEO Eckart Wintzen in the collision of two world, “one of strict financial 

procedures combined with “check, check, double check” with one of “have trust, have 

trust”” (LALOUX, 2014, p. 252). 

Likewise, in his book I. Getz studies GSI, a liberated French company at the time. 

However, in 1995 ADP bought the company which then became part of a group of 

56 000 employees. They replied in our survey that they do not consider themselves as 

fitting the definition of a “liberated company” anymore. Bob Davids, the former CEO 

of the 8 000 employees liberated company Radica Games, also recalls that this liberated 

culture was “killed […] within six months” after his departure. At another studied 

company, USAA, “things had changed for the worse since Robert McDermott retired 

in the early 1990s” confessed an employee to I. Getz. (GETZ, 2009, p. 196). 

The Dutch author Ben Kuiken, author of the book “The last manager” also visited 

in 2010 the famous Brazilian liberated company Semco, which reached 3 000 

employees under the management of Ricardo Semler. From this visit, he writes that 

“Semler himself hardly interferes with the business” and that “basically we are talking 

about a real-Semco company with eighty people and that's pretty much it” (KUIKEN, 

2016, online). 

1.5.2. A conceptualized model is a prescriptive model 

In I. Getz vision, the “liberated” organization is more seen as a philosophy and 

therefore depends more on the impulsion of a liberating leader and its values than on 

the organizational model and what practices are implemented. Indeed, as he explains, 

“as researchers, we began by seeking an organizational model of the liberated company. 

Yet, we haven’t found any” (GETZ, 2017, online). The definition of a liberated 

company is merely based “on its function, giving liberty and responsibility to 

employees, rather than by a set of structural features” (GETZ, 2009, p. 35). It is the role 

of the leader to articulate this idea of liberty within the cultural context of his company 

and co-construct it with its employees. Moreover, “unless one understands what 

triggered people to engage in their lengthy efforts [...], reading about what they 

accomplished will be of little help for anyone wishing to replicate the feat” (GETZ, 

2009, p. 61). 



36 

 

 

 

 

In an interview for the French magazine “Usine Nouvelle” given in 2016, he even 

expressed concerns about some misunderstanding about the concept of liberated 

companies: “Today, a lot of people are saying that they started to liberate their 

companies”, “I receive a lot of emails from CEO asking for methods, recipes, 

solutions”; “I almost find it worrisome. They stay in a simple organizational 

conception: reducing layers of hierarchy, suppressing some functional departments, the 

timer. They didn’t see what is from my point of view essential: the role of the liberating 

leader, who has to co-construct a unique organizational structure” (BYS, 2016, online). 

He also expressed similar concerns about Holacracy in an interview to the Dutch 

website neworganising.eu, where he said that this model has two problems: “First, that 

it’s a model. As I explained you: there isn’t a model. You have to find your own 

approach. But second, and even worse: I don’t believe it will work. Some consultants 

take the concept of holacracy, approach business leaders and promise them: four 

months, then it will be finished. Which is nonsense. […] It depends on the people. Let 

them lead the change. Because that’s the whole idea of the liberated company: that they 

are free, and can decide for themselves how they want to work together.” (KUIKEN, 

2016, online) 

Finally, he also expressed in an article in the newspaper “Le Monde” in 2016 his 

regrets that Tom Peters focused fifty percent of his book on organizational structures, 

without mentioning the word “liberty” other than in the title and the conclusion. 

Two liberating leaders share a similar opinion. Alexandre Gerard, a French leader 

who liberated the group Inov’On, wrote on his blog a similar concern, starting his article 

by saying “I am very worried”. His concerns are also about entrepreneurs who tell him 

“I will do this, then that…” In his opinion, the question is not about “what will I do” 

but about “what will I let other people do?” Jean-François Zobrist, the former CEO of 

FAVI, also wrote a similar point of view: “I strongly believe that there are no universal 

models […] What can be done is to listen to testimonies and get inspiration from them.” 

(ZOBRIST, 2006, p. 4) 

The authors of the paper “Self-organization: The irresistible future of organizing” 

also believe that “the path of self-organization can never be known ahead of time” and 

that “there are no prescribed stages or models.” To implement self-organization, leaders 



37 

 

 

 

 

must begin “with a strong intention, not a set of action plans” and have “confidence in 

the organization's intelligence” (WHEATLEY, KELLNER-ROGERS, 1996, p. 8).  

F. Laloux has a slightly different point of view. He wonders whether “pioneers [can] 

provide not just inspiration, but a template for those aspiring to create more soulful 

types of organizations?” He agrees that liberating leaders play a very crucial role to 

initiate the liberation process, which is a consensus within the existing literature. This 

idea was clearly expressed by Ralph Stayer, former CEO of Johnsonville Sausage: “No 

one had asked for more responsibility; I forced it down their throats” (STAYER, 1990, 

p. 4). However, in F. Laloux’s opinion, this condition is necessary but not sufficient, 

since “enlightened leaders don’t automatically make for enlightened organizations 

unless they also embrace structures, practices, and culture”. He also argues that such 

structures, practices, and cultures are “consciously or unconsciously” put in place by 

the leader, in coherence with their beliefs (LALOUX, 2014). The liberating leader R. 

Stayer corroborate this idea: “I had come to realize […] that as a manager I didn’t really 

manage people. They managed themselves. But I did manage the context. I provided 

and allocated the resources. I designed and implemented the systems. I drew up and 

executed the organizational structure” (STAYER, 1990, p. 6). 

A dialogue that F. Laloux had in 2017 with R. Semler helps understanding how he 

analyzed such organizational structures. He considers that “any framework can be very 

helpful because it gives us the language to see patterns that we didn’t see before” 

(Laloux, 2017, podcast). However, even if he goes one step further than I. Getz by 

describing a framework, he still believes that his concept of Teal Organization "isn’t 

meant to be read in a prescriptive way, as a list of structures and practices that must be 

rigidly implemented” (LALOUX, 2014, p. 304). Therefore, Laloux’s framework is “not 

a list of fifteen things that will make your organization better” (SEMLER, 2017, 

podcast). 

Holacracy, with its network of coaches trained to implement a minimum set of 

practices, seems to be the most prescriptive model. However, even such practices are 

seen as a minimal “operating system”, and different “apps” can be added according to 

the various needs of each organization.

2. Methodology 

This chapter explains the methodology for this research: how the literature review was 

conducted, how the research was designed and how the data was collected and then 

analyzed. 

The following chart from Kothari (2004) gives an excellent summary of the 

methodological steps followed to conduct the research: 

Figure 2: Research process in flow chart 

  

2.1. Literature review  

To better understand the liberated companies and its characteristics, a literature 

review was conducted. Kothari defines two types of literature, “the conceptual literature 

concerning the concepts and theories, and the empirical literature consisting of studies 

made earlier” (KOTHARI, 2005, p. 12). In the literature review conducted, both 

conceptual and empirical kind of literature were accessed. 

We presented conceptual research to explain the concepts of Bureaucracy, 

Taylorism, hierarchy, decentralization, delayering, and to express the ideas behind 



39 

 

 

 

 

liberated companies. We analyzed surveys conducted by consulting companies to 

present the subject of engagement.  

 In the following section, 1.4. The new organizational structures emerging from 

these values, the research papers, books and case studies used to present the existing 

knowledge on organizational design of liberated companies were mainly empirical and 

qualitative. Indeed, I. Getz, F. Laloux, and T. Peters all observed and described about 

ten companies each, helped by the interviews they conducted with the management. 

The existing case studies on Semco (Semler, 1984, 1990, 1994, 1999), Johnsonville 

Sausages (STAYER, 1990), WL Gore (Harder and Townsend, 2017), Sun Hydraulics 

Corporation (Kaftan and Barnes, 1991) are also empirical qualitative studies. We 

haven’t found any quantitative research on the subject of liberated companies. 

Finally, the deficiencies that can result from having only empirical qualitative 

studies and the resulting debate in the literature on the existence of an organizational 

model were presented. 

2.2. Research Design 

Once the literature review conducted, the research was designed. As Kothari 

explains, “defining a problem involves the task of laying down boundaries within which 

a researcher shall study the problem with a pre-determined objective in view” 

(KOTHARI, 2004, p. 40). In this thesis, we had to define a universe within which we 

would study our research question, define which organizational features we would test 

as hypotheses, and then design our survey.  

2.2.1. Definition of the universe 

Insofar as the movement of liberated companies is growing in France, with Getz 

(2017) claiming that about 250 organizations are currently liberated, this study was able 

to use a quantitative method to answer our research question and test if there is a 

consistency of patterns in the organizational systems of liberated companies. 

Quantitative methods, according to Sale, Lohfeld and Brazil (2002), seek to reduce 

phenomena into empirical indicators and variables. Creswell (2013) defines a variable 

as the attributes of organizations that can be measured and that varies among the 

organizations being studied. These variables can then be analyzed using statistical 

procedures. 



40 

 

 

 

 

Kothari (2004, p. 18) then sub-classify the quantitative approach into inferential, 

experimental and simulation approaches. Inferential studies aim at forming “a database 

from which to infer characteristics or relationships of a population,” which is exactly 

the purpose of this study. 

To design the universe that would be studied, two main sources were used. First, 

I. Getz implemented a Google group to debate and share information about liberated 

organizations. In this group, companies can on a voluntary basis apply to be recognized 

as a “Liberated organizations.” If the community considers that they fit the criteria, they 

are added to a map. On the 2nd of May 2017, the community was comprised of 1407 

people and the map listed sixty-one companies. Then, mostly from press articles, fifty-

three more organizations were also identified as liberated organizations. It is important 

to note that this identification was based on the features rather than on how these 

companies describe themselves. Indeed, behind different names like Teal 

Organizations, Holacracy, Inverted Organizational Pyramid (HCL Technologies), Self-

management (Morning Star), Self-directed Teams (WL Gore) or Trust-based 

Management (Semco) the same organizational principles were often found. A list of 

114 organizations was therefore established, which can be found in appendix 1. 

Out of these 114 organizations, 107 are private companies, four are public 

organizations, two are non-profit organizations, and one is a hospital. Eighty-seven are 

French (seventy-six percent), sixteen are American (fourteen percent), five are Dutch, 

two are Belgian, and four others are from India, Finland, Croatia and Brazil. This 

repartition can be seen in appendix 2 and 3.  

2.2.2. Organizational features of the universe 

Two different types of research approaches coexist: the inductive and the 

deductive approach. According to Babbie (2010), induction begins with observations 

and seeks to find a pattern within them. On the other hand, Wilson (2010) describes the 

process of a deductive approach as developing a hypothesis based on the existing theory 

and then designing a research strategy to test it.  

This study combined these two approaches. First, we inducted from secondary 

data (books, case studies, papers, websites and interviews that mentioned these 114 

companies of the universe) the existing organizational patterns of liberated 



41 

 

 

 

 

organizations. This process led to the identification of thirty-nine different 

organizational features. 

Then, if five or more out of these 114 organizations were identified as sharing 

one feature, such feature was considered significantly spread and therefore kept as a 

hypothesis to be tested. This process led to the selection of twenty-one different features 

out of the thirty-nine initial ones. Moreover, four other features that were shared by 

only three or four companies but were emphasized in I. Getz and F. Laloux’s books 

were considered significant enough in the literature to be kept as hypotheses. Fourteen 

features were dismissed. After this process the final number of features to be tested 

added up to twenty-five.  

In the survey, seven other questions were added: two questions had the objective 

of identifying the model that best fitted the organization surveyed (Liberated 

organization, Teal organization, Holacracy or “other”). Lastly, five questions were 

asked to clarify some of the twenty-five features. The survey had thirty-two questions 

in total. The detail of this selection process can be seen in the table below: 



42 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 3 Features selection process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We used a deductive approach by testing the hypothesis that at least some of these 

twenty-five features were consistent in liberated organizations.

2.2.3. Survey design 

To test this hypothesis, a survey was sent to the 114 companies identified in the 

universe, by the internet, through the website SurveyMonkey. One version was made 

in English, another one in French.  

This website allowed to track the emails sent, send a reminder to the organizations 

and quickly export the responses, thus being time and cost-effective.  

For each of the twenty-five patterns, the respondents had to state if these practices 

exist or not in their organizations.  

2.3. Data process and analysis  

The data was processed using Excel. Out the 114 organizations who received the 

questionnaire, forty-three responded (thirty-eight percent). Four company that provided 

incomplete answers were taken out of the sample. The final sample resulted in 39 

companies to be analyzed, i.e., one-third of the universe (thirty-four percent). The 

answers in French were translated into English.  

The respondents were classified according to their attributes (by type of 

organization: NGO, public organization or company, and by countries of origin) and by 

class intervals (the number of employees).  

Based on the literature review was then constructed a “percentage of 

liberalization.” We assigned to each of the twenty-five features an answer that a 

company described as liberated in the literature would have given. If a company that 

we studied was matching the answer assigned, a score of 1 was given, and if not, a score 

of 0 was given. This resulted in a score on 25, which was then translated into a score 

on 10 for clarity reasons. The following table displays the answers assigned in the 

beginning.

Once these elements were collected, statistic methods were used to analyze the 

sample. We analyzed the repartition of the sample in terms of liberalization score. We 

ran a correlation analysis to see the influence of the size of the company on the 

liberalization score. The subsample attribute “country of origin” and “type of 

organization” were too small to run a correlation analysis with the liberalization score. 

Average, maximum and minimum functions were used to study the distribution of each 

twenty-five pattern. 

The results indicate that some features are common to the liberated organizations; 

as it can be seen in the table below.

The result interpretation will be presented in the next chapter. 

Last but not least, three big companies (Airbus, Michelin and Decathlon) reached 

out to us after the survey was sent, to clarify that their response only concerned a few 

experimentations and not the entire group. Therefore, a more qualitative method was 

conducted on the side to understand the articulation of these pilots with the headquarters 

better. Interviews were conducted: for Airbus, a Skype interview of two hours was 

carried out with a researcher in charge of assessing the empowerment within the 

company, and for Decathlon and Michelin, emails were exchanged with a manager of 

the enterprise.

3. Findings 

In this chapter, we will present the results of the study. First, we will explain through 

the literature the patterns consistent among liberated companies. Then, we will analyze 

the patterns that are non-consistent. Finally, we are going to explain to what extent 

models are spread differently in larger corporations. 

3.1. The consistency of pattern among liberated companies 

The main finding of our study is that even if it is the role of the leader to articulate 

the idea of liberty within the cultural context of his company, as expressed by I. Getz, 

these leaders end up putting in place some organizational structures and practices that 

are consistent among liberated organizations. 

3.1.1. A liberalization score fairly high among the sample 

The thirty-nine organizations studied had a high liberalization score on average, 

especially the thirty-two that defined themselves as liberated companies. 

3.1.1.1. Most organizations have at least half of the patterns previously 

identified 

As explained in the methodology part, we assigned to each feature a score of one or 

zero, and therefore each company ended up with a liberalization score from zero to 

twenty-five, which was translated into a score from zero to ten. In general, the scores 

were quite high, with an average of 6.7, meaning that on average two thirds of the 

patterns identified in the universe of 114 liberated organizations studied were also found 

across the thirty-nine organizations which took part in the survey. This finding gives 

some credits to our hypothesis that there is a consistency of patterns in the 

organizational systems of liberated companies. 

Indeed, eighty-seven percent of the thirty-nine companies of the universe had a 

liberalization score of five or more, meaning that most organizations had at least half 

of the twenty-five patterns identified in other liberated companies. Eighty-two percent 

of the universe had a liberalization score of six or above. The company with the higher 

score reached a score of 9.6, and the lowest score was 1.7.

3.1.1.2. Correlation with the type of organization 

Among the thirty-nine companies that completed our questionnaire, thirty-two 

labeled themselves as liberated companies, when seven others had other ways to 

describe their organization. Among these seven others, two companies considered 

themselves as Teal Organizations, two considered themselves as Holacracy, one as an 

“inverted pyramid”, and two others didn’t write down a proper definition. 

Companies which labeled themselves as “liberated organizations” had on average a 

liberalization score of seven, whereas those who did label themselves in another way 

had on average a liberalization score of 5.3. 

This finding gives even more credit to our hypothesis of having consistent pattern 

among liberated companies. 

3.1.2. Very consistent patterns linked to the culture 

Through the liberalization score, we found that eighty-seven percent of the 

companies in the sample implemented at least half of the features tested, giving some 

credits to our hypothesis. In this section, we are going to break down this liberalization 

score which aggregates twenty-five features, to find the most consistent features, and 

elaborate on them. Three features related to the culture of the company were present in 

seventy-four to one hundred percent of the sample, giving credits to the thesis of I. Getz 

that liberated organizations are above all a matter of philosophy. These three features 



49 

 

 

 

 

imply the suppression of signs of privileges, the importance of values and a different 

role for the CEOs. 

3.1.2.1. Suppressing signs of privileges 

Out of the thirty-nine companies surveyed, twenty-seven had a parking lot. Out of 

these twenty-seven, one hundred percent did not have parking spots reserved for the 

senior management. In organizations where the pyramidal hierarchy is suppressed, 

every symbol must show employees that they are treated as equals. 

This example is recurrent in the literature studied. Tom Peters (1992) illustrates in 

his book “Liberation Management” the importance of getting rid of symbols of 

hierarchy through the story of Renn Zaphiropoulos. In 1984, this manager from Xerox 

came to a more senior position. Consequently, he went to buy “two one-gallon cans of 

black paint and a paintbrush” and “began to paint out the labels on the executive parking 

spots”. Robert Townsend also advised managers to show through non-symbolic 

manners that they deserve their leadership positions: “If you’re so bloody important 

you better be the first one in the office. Besides, you’ll meet a nice class of people in 

the employee’s parking lot" (TOWNSEND, 1970, p. 83). 

More generally, I. Getz mentions the importance of suppressing “all the symbols 

and practices that prevent your people from feeling intrinsically equal” (GETZ, 2009, 

p. 8). These symbols include “mahogany executive floors and big corner offices with 

expensive furniture, company limousines” or as mentioned, “personalized reserved 

parking spaces” (GETZ, 2009, p. 75). Stayer, the CEO of Johnsonville Sausage 

understood as well the power of symbols, advising other top managers to “start by 

changing the most visible system you directly control.” In his case, this symbolic 

decision was to give his employees the control over the quality control and the tasting 

of sausages. This “highly visible action” lead every employee to believe that he was 

actually “serious about spreading responsibility” (STAYER, 1990, p. 8). 

3.1.2.2. The importance of values 

Ninety-five percent of the companies surveyed have written shared values. 

However, the literature makes it somehow unclear what to infer from this second most 

recurrent feature.  



50 

 

 

 

 

On the one hand, liberated companies claim that written shared values help them 

evaluating the work of their employees, the values serving as a metric for guiding the 

employees conduct in the absence of hierarchical orders. For example, Tony Hsieh, 

leader of Zappos, the largest Holocracy company, estimated in an interview with R. 

Semler that “as long as it’s in line with our core values, then we want our employees to 

go for it” (SEMLER, 2017, podcast). 

Having written shared values also help to conduct interviews, onboarding new 

employees and passing the culture along. For example, each new employee at FAVI is 

given on his first day the written shared values towards other employees (Good Faith, 

Common Sense, Good Will, Cheerfulness), and below these values is written: “I will 

be judged on those values” (ZOBRIST, 2006). 

Nonetheless, others have considered that having its values written is either useless 

or not satisfactory enough. Ricardo Semler, for example, has reportedly asked some 

CEOs to write their values down on a piece of paper, before shuffling them and 

redistributing them, to show how these values are often “identical” (FISHER, 2005). I. 

Getz and F. Laloux also both believe that having written shared values is not enough to 

create an efficient liberated organization. For the former, “liberating leaders must live 

the values they want to instill in their businesses” (GETZ, 2009, p. 60) when for the 

latter, it also “takes more than a document to bring values to life” (LALOUX, 2014, p. 

153). Thus, companies need to translate the values into “explicit ground rules” and have 

ongoing value discussions through for example values days, values meeting, and annual 

surveys. 

If we can consider this feature as consistent, further research is needed to 

demonstrate how the use of these values helps the liberalization of organizations. 

3.1.2.3. The role of the CEO 

We found in our study that in seventy-four percent of the companies studied, the 

CEO was away from the office more than two days per week. 

According to a survey conducted in France, executives spend on average five weeks 

per year on meetings (WISEMBLY/IFOP, 2016). Once self-management is 

implemented, then the CEO does not need to go to all these meetings to “do the hard 

work of integrating conflicting perspectives into a decision” (LALOUX, 2014, p. 102). 



51 

 

 

 

 

“Much of what gobbles up the agenda of company founders or CEOs falls away in Teal 

Organizations. There are no more executive meetings, no steering committees … there 

are hardly any fixed meetings at all” (LALOUX, 2014, p. 248). F. Laloux proves his 

point with the example of the CEO of Sun Hydraulics, a publicly listed company, which 

only had four meetings the week he met him, and two of these meetings were with the 

author himself. Ralph Stayer, the former CEO of Johnsonville Sausage also explains 

how he began scheduling himself “out of many meetings, forcing others to make their 

decisions without [him]” (STAYER, 1990, p. 9).  

There are many other examples of CEOs of liberated companies showing how much 

time they have for themselves. Ralph Stayer, the former CEO of Johnsonville Sausage, 

explains that “for the last five years, [his] ambition has been to eliminate [his] job”, by 

having other people owning his problems (STAYER, 1990, p. 11). Jean-François 

Zobrist, the former CEO of FAVI, also explains that as a CEO, his goal was “to do as 

little as possible” (GETZ, 2009, p. 25). Having more time allows these leaders to pursue 

other projects. Bob Davids, the former CEO of Sea Smoke Cellars, once said to his 

employees: “I’m gone for eight months”, and told them that if they had any problem, 

they should just solve it and send him an email with the solution (GETZ, 2009, p. 51). 

Alexandre Gerard, the CEO of Inov’On, also undertook a round-the-world tour of seven 

months after having liberated his company. 

The roles that undertake the CEO once his command and control mission no longer 

prevail can be diverse: He can become the “culture keeper” (GETZ, 2009, p. 8), “hold 

the space for Teal structures and practices” (LALOUX, 2014, p. 240) or role modeling 

“virtues such as humility, trust, courage, candor, vulnerability, and authenticity” 

(LALOUX, 2014, p. 246). 

3.1.3. Very consistent patterns linked to the organizational structure 

In addition to these three patterns that we linked to the culture of the companies, 

eight other patterns widely spread are related to the organizational structures, giving 

credit to Laloux’s theory. These eight patterns are present in from seventy-four to 

ninety-two percent of the companies in the sample. They relate to self-organizing teams, 

the end of control, information and profit sharing. 



52 

 

 

 

 

3.1.3.1. Self-organizing teams  

Ninety-two percent of companies in the sample, i.e., thirty-six companies, have self-

organizing teams. Parker, Holesgrove &amp;amp; Pathak defined of a self-organized team as a 

“self-regulated, semi-autonomous small group of employees whose members 

determine, plan and manage their day-to-day activities and duties under reduced or no 

supervision” (PARKER, HOLESGROVE &amp;amp; PATHAK, 2015, p. 3). 

I. Getz studied the “ecosystem of ideas and models that influenced the construction 

of liberated companies” (GETZ, 2012, p. 9). According to his research, it first started 

in the 1940s’ with the Task Force implemented at Dupont. Bill Gore, the founder of 

WL Gore, worked at Dupont and would say later that “the task force was exciting, 

challenging and loads of fun. […] I began to wonder why entire companies couldn’t be 

run the same way” (HARDER, TOWNSEND, 2017, p. 2). 

Zobrist from Favi explains well how such self-organizing teams have been 

implemented. They “broke up the plant into some twenty self-directed, single-product, 

client-focused “miniplants,” each of which was responsible for every aspect of its own 

business, from hiring and training to purchasing, budgeting, and, of course, production” 

(GETZ, 2009, p. 91). At Johnsonville as well, “line workers assumed most of the 

traditional personnel functions” (STAYER, 1990, p6). 

However, as Tom Peters (1992) puts it, “the expert work must be done”. “The issue 

is how – and where – to do it.” Indeed, at Favi “most of the support functions had been 

pared back or integrated into the miniplants themselves” (GETZ, 2009, p. 91). But how 

is this “most” defined? 

According to the Teal model by F. Laloux, when a problem or an opportunity arises 

that requires some expertise, an ad hoc meeting is convened across teams. And “when 

a more permanent form of coordination is needed, a staff function might emerge from 

the teams in a process of reverse delegation” (LALOUX, 2014, p. 79). In a word, the 

model of liberated companies is that the frontline teams do everything, except for the 

things they choose to push upward. 

3.1.3.2. Ending control to implement trust 

Rules and policies are only giving managers a “sense of control” which make them 

safe, while it is, in fact, just an illusion of control which can in reality harm the 



53 

 

 

 

 

organization (LALOUX, 2014). I. Getz (2009), quoting the former CEO of Chaparral 

Steel, explains how top executives usually implement control for the three percent of 

employees who specifically outwit controls. He gives the example of a secretary who 

was stealing office supplies; as a response, the top manager forbade the ordering of 

office supplies during the summer, which certainly contributed to the disengagement of 

the ninety-seven other percent of employees who did not steal. Ricardo Semler from 

Semco had a similar philosophy: “I would rather have a few thefts once in a while than 

condemn everyone to a system based on mistrust.” (SEMLER, 1993). 

The damages of control can also be explained through the literature on self-fulfilling 

prophecies. Rosenthal and Jacobsen (1968) demonstrated indeed how teacher 

expectations influence student performance: having negative expectations influence 

performance negatively. Thus, expecting employees to behave against the organization 

could actually lead to such outcomes. Reversely, Rosenthal and Jacobsen have also 

proven that a positive expectation influence performance positively. 

Last but not least, controlling employees can also have the effect of taking 

responsibility away from them. As the CEO of Johnsonville Sausages explains: “one 

day it struck me that by checking the product, top management had assumed 

responsibility for its quality. We were not encouraging people to be responsible for their 

own performance” (STAYER, 1990, p. 6). As a result, they asked the top management 

to stop tasting sausage, and the people who made sausage started assuming the quality 

control. As a result, rejects fell from five percent to less than 0.5 percent. 

These ideas of ending control are very consistent with the ideas expressed in section 

1.3.3. The ideas behind empowerment, autonomy, and liberty. In our study we found 

therefore that ninety percent of the companies surveyed let their employees set their 

own work schedule, eighty-nine percent do not have a control department, and eighty-

seven percent allow their employees to work remotely. 

3.1.3.3. The importance of sharing information 

F. Laloux outlines three main reasons for liberated companies to share information, 

including financial information. First, it allows the self-managed teams to “make the 

best decisions” (LALOUX, 2014, p. 113). Ricardo Semler (1989) understood well that 

information would help workers figure out what is working and what is not. For this 



54 

 

 

 

 

purpose, each month employees received a balance sheet, an income statement and a 

cash flow statement. Moreover, they also received training to read and understand these 

documents. Thus, employees knew “how much bronze is costing us, how much 

overtime we paid, all of it” (SEMLER, 1989, online). Later on, the company went even 

further by letting everybody know how much everyone was making and by leaving any 

meeting open to anyone. Wheatley and Kellner-Rogers also adds the idea that “there is 

a need for many more eyes and ears”, because “when information is available 

everywhere, different people see different things”, for example, “those with a more 

strategic focus will see opportunities that others can't discern” (WHEATLEY AND 

KELLNER-ROGERS, 1996, p. 6). This explains partly why Semco entered businesses 

that were not in its core business after some employees expressed an opportunity in it, 

such as managing cooling-tower maintenance (SEMLER, 1999). 

The second reason given by F. Laloux is that “any information that isn’t public will 

cause suspicion, […] and suspicion is toxic for organizational trust” (LALOUX, 2014, 

p. 113). Stan Richard, the leader of the liberated company the Richards Group, believed 

in the same principle: “The only way to defeat paranoia is by not keeping secrets, and 

so everyone is allowed to know everything” (GETZ, 2009, p. 157). 

Finally, F. Laloux’s third argument is that “informal hierarchies reemerge when 

some people are in the know while others are not” (LALOUX, 2014, p. 113). Stan 

Richard also understood this concept, revealing that in his company “there are no 

unimportant people here and therefore, information should go to everyone at exactly 

the same moment” (GETZ, 2009, p. 157). 

These three arguments explain well one main result of our study: eighty-seven 

percent of the companies studied are giving their employees access to all information, 

including financial one. 

F. Laloux emphasizes as well how “information technology tools such as internal 

social networks and knowledge repositories can play a critical role in steering clear of 

unnecessary structures” (LALOUX, 2014, p. 79). We indeed found that eighty-seven 

percent of the liberated companies studied use digital tools for sharing information or 

consult colleagues. This very last principle of consulting colleagues is also quite 

specific in liberated companies, as we are going to see now. 



55 

 

 

 

 

3.1.3.4. The consultation process 

In the absence of hierarchy, our literature review displayed a unique process of 

decision-making. Indeed, having employees deciding for themselves does not mean that 

they decide by themselves. F. Laloux depicts this process as follows: “any person can 

make any decision but must seek advice from affected parties and people with 

expertise” (LALOUX, 2014, p. 100). This process relates to the decision-making 

process “CI” expressed by Vroom and Yetton (1973) in their Normative Decision 

Theory, where “the leader shares the problem and gets ideas and suggestions from 

relevant employees on an individual basis. Then the leader makes the decision, which 

may or may not reflects their input” (WILLIAMS, 2017, p. 302). However, in the case 

of liberated companies, every employee gets to be a leader.  

I. Getz encountered similar decision processes, existing under different names in 

the companies he studied. For example at GSI, such practice was called the “duty to 

consult”, and at IDEO exists the “principle of consulting on decisions that may affect 

others” (GETZ, 2009, p. 176). At Gore also, people were expected to “consult with 

other associates before undertaking actions that could impact the reputation and 

profitability of the company” (HARDER AND TOWNSEND, 2017, p. 6). 

Thus, we found in our study that seventy-six percent of the thirty-nine companies 

studied implemented a rule where employees must consult people affected by their 

decision before taking it. 

3.1.3.5. Profit sharing 

In the literature studied, profit sharing is not mentioned very often as a characteristic 

of a liberated company, besides by Ricardo Semler and Frédéric Laloux. The former, 

who introduced a distribution of twenty-three percent of the after-tax profit, explains 

that profit sharing gives the employees a reason to do their job better. The latter also 

briefly mention “equal profit sharing” as a practice of Teal Organizations (LALOUX, 

2014, p. 328) without giving further examples. 

From our study, it seems however that this is quite a common practice among 

liberated companies, with seventy-four percent of companies surveyed sharing their 

profits with their employees (twenty-eight of the thirty-eight companies that answered 

this question). 



56 

 

 

 

 

As explained in the Methodology chapter, we included in our survey questions to 

clarify the answers of the respondents. In the case of profit sharing, we asked companies 

to detail how they were sharing these profits (what percentage was shared, and 

following what scheme). Among the twenty-eight companies that share profits, twenty-

four accepted to display their sharing pattern. And it appears that thirteen of them (fifty-

four percent) share more than twenty percent of their profits with their employees. As 

it can be seen in the chart below, surveyed companies usually extensively share their 

profits. 

Figure 7: Percentage of profit that is shared with employees, among companies that share 

profits and communicated their sharing pattern 

 

It is also worth noting that out of the twenty-eight businesses that share their profits, 

twenty-six indicated how they share it among their employees. The majority (fifteen) 

are sharing it equally among employees. Four make the profit sharing depend on the 

salary, and make it depend on the job function. Two other companies announced that 

they shared it equally among employees and that it depended on the salary, and three 

indicated that it was shared equally and depended on the job function. 

3.2. Inconsistent patterns 

In addition to these eleven patterns we identified as widely spread, fourteen other 

features were considered not entirely consistent, giving credit to the theory of I. Getz 

that liberated companies articulate the idea of liberty within a specific context. Ten 

features were present in the majority of the organizations, and four were rarely spread.

3.2.1. Patterns present in the majority of organizations 

This section will briefly analyze the ten patterns that were found in the majority of 

organizations, on a range from forty-two to sixty-nine percent of the companies. They 

concern either the way employees evolve in the company or some general human 

resources practices. 

3.2.1.1. The evolution of an employee in the company 

As T. Peters (1992) explained, “the ladder that managers aspired to climb is being 

turned to kindling in the liberated, horizontal, beyond hierarchy environment.” 

Likewise, Ricardo Semler stated that “the idea that I will hire you, I will train you, I 

will want to know where you want to be in five years, and then I will give you that 

better job is totally out of the question” (SEMLER, 2004, p. 2). Thus, how is the career 

path of an employee in a liberated company differently paved? 

First, hiring is considered very important in liberated organizations. For example, 

at Morning Star, the majority of applicants’ interview is focused “on assessing the fit 

between Morning Star’s philosophy and the applicant’s expectations” (HAMEL, 2011, 

p. 6). Many liberated companies go further by making the hiring dependent on the future 

team acceptance. For example, at Semco applicants are not hired “until they've been 

interviewed and accepted by all their future subordinates” (SEMLER, 1989). The 

findings show that two-thirds (sixty-six percent) of the companies surveyed 

implemented this practice. 

Once hired, since “the first days and weeks are critical to making someone feel that 

she has come into a new and different workplace” (LALOUX, 2014, p. 176), the 

onboarding process usually integrates some training about self-management. This is the 

case with fifty-four percent of the organizations surveyed. 

Besides, once the employees are fully part of the organizations, to access leadership 

positions, in forty-four percent of the liberated companies surveyed, managers have to 

be co-opted by their teams, which means that each team has to appoint its leader. WL 

Gore went even further this idea by letting a board of pooled employees pick their next 

leader as a company. The board was able to name any worker and chose in 2005 Terri 

Kelly, an employee who worked twenty-two years at WL Gore to be the next CEO. She 



58 

 

 

 

 

reported being “as shocked as the next person” by this decision. (STERN, MARSH, 

2008, p. 2). 

Two other working practices are linked to explicit processes for formal interactions 

among employees: The first one is a process to resolve conflicts, which is viewed by 

Laloux as “fundamental to collaboration without hierarchy”. Indeed, in the absence of 

formal hierarchies, it can feel uncomfortable to step up and hold a colleague 

accountable for its previous commitments. In such scenarios, “a clearly outlined 

conflict resolution process helps people confront each other” (LALOUX, 2014, p. 112 

and p. 114). At Morning Star, the resolution process works as follow when two 

employees cannot agree: They first pick a mediator. If this mediation fails, they convene 

a jury of six colleagues to settle the disagreement. If the conflict is still unresolved after 

that, “the company's president holds the determining gave” (LIBERMAN, 2013, p. 8). 

A similar specific conflict resolution process was found present in forty-seven percent 

of the surveyed companies. This percentage can be considered significant since F. 

Laloux, a former consultant, recalls in his book to had “never encountered a company 

with an explicit conflict resolution mechanism” before (LALOUX, 2014, p. 114). 

The second process concerns meetings. As previously mentioned, executives spend 

five weeks per year in meetings, and thirty-five percent of them consider that half of 

these meetings are unproductive (WISEMBLY/IFOP, 2016). According to F. Laloux, 

this unproductivity happens because “more often than not, meetings in companies turn 

into playfields for the egos”. This is why almost all the organizations he studied “have 

instituted specific meeting practices to help participants keep their egos in check” 

(LALOUX, 2014, p. 162). They ensure “that every voice is heard, that the collective 

intelligence informs decision-making, and that no one person can derail the process and 

hold others hostage trying to impose her personal preferences” (LALOUX, 2014, p. 

68). Forty-two percent of the companies which completed our survey indeed reported 

having an explicit meeting process. 

3.2.1.2. Human resources common practices 

Forty-three percent of the companies surveyed did not have a Human Resources 

department. However, they did implement some relevant practices in terms of human 

resources. 



59 

 

 

 

 

For example, sixty-nine percent of them did not have an organization chart. Robert 

Townsend compared these charts to pigeonholes where people are trapped. Therefore, 

he advised to not “print and circulate organizational charts”, because “every man-and 

woman-is a human being, not a rectangle” (TOWNSEND, 1970, p. 144). At Sun 

Hydraulics, leaders also believe that such organizational charts “force individuals into 

defensive, unproductive and damaging behavior patterns” (KAFTAN AND BARNES, 

1991, p. 2). One of these behavior patterns expresses itself through the process of 

promotion. The CEO of Sun Hydraulics, Bob Koski, warns indeed against situations 

where “it becomes more important that a person knows how the business works 

internally than anything about the external activities of the company” and where 

“people only look at sideways to see who is above whom” (KAFTAN AND BARNES, 

1991, p. 2). 

Following a similar principle, sixty-eight percent of the organizations studied also 

decided to change the names of titles (for example: managers to leaders, employees to 

colleagues). This practice is also aligned with the idea of suppressing every sign of 

hierarchy. Bill Gore believed indeed “that the way we talk about one another and about 

our jobs affects the way we think and the way we act” (GETZ, 2009, p. 13). Therefore, 

at WL Gore, every employee has the same job title of Associate.  

Likewise, fifty-six percent of the survey respondents do not have job descriptions. 

Many organizations view job descriptions as rigid ways to tell people how to do their 

work. Semler (1999) condemned this practice of hiring people for specific jobs and 

keeping them in one career track, without taking into account what they desire are. On 

the contrary, in a system like Holacracy for example, people are not considered as 

having a rigid job; they simply fill a number of roles that evolve with the company 

needs. 

Lastly, another recurrent idea in the literature is the change of spatial configuration 

of the working place, to allow better communication between employees. For example, 

Tom Peters (1992) described in his book how the building of the company 3M has been 

designed “to foster waves, to increase the probability that a useful particle [person] will 

come into contact with another useful particle”. In addition to designing the workplace 

to increase interactions among different functions, there are various examples in the 

literature of equality of working conditions, with managers going from corner offices 



60 

 

 

 

 

to cubicles in the center of the open space, or even next to the factory machines. In our 

preliminary study to select patterns among the 114 organizations, the change of spatial 

configuration was the most commonly implemented feature, with nineteen occurrences 

in the universe of 114 organizations. Among the companies which answered our survey, 

two-thirds (sixty-seven percent) took this initiative of changing the configuration of the 

workplace. 

3.2.2. Some patterns rarely spread 

Then four patterns were not significantly spread, with only nine to thirty-two 

percent of the companies implementing them. 

Even if it is quite common for liberated companies to make the hiring process 

dependent on the future team acceptance and allow teams to co-opt their managers, it 

seems however that the evaluation of the managers by their own teams is present in 

only about one-third of the surveyed companies (thirty-two percent). This type of 

assessment by a subordinate is, for example, happening at Semco twice a year. 

The process of letting the employees set their own salaries is presented by F. Laloux 

as a common pattern of Teal Organizations. This practice was noticeably established 

by Semco, where the 3 000 employees could choose their salaries individually, after a 

benchmark with their colleagues and the industry competitors. However, only twenty-

eight percent of the companies which answered the survey adopted such a practice. 

Since liberated companies are trying to “sense and respond” rather than “predict 

and control” (LALOUX, 2014, p. 209), and since the budget embodies this idea of 

prediction, Laloux asserts that “many of these companies don’t create any budget at all” 

(LALOUX, 2014, p. 213). However, only nine percent of the businesses that answered 

our questionnaire did not have a budget. 

F. Laloux goes further by stating that “if a budget is established, there is no tweaking 

from above. Whatever numbers the teams forecast become the budget” (LALOUX, 

2014, p. 213). Amongst the ninety-one percent of organizations which do have a budget, 

only twenty-five percent do not allow the top management to modify it. 

The findings on the features found in the sample are summarized in the table below:

3.3. Spreading a model in larger corporations 

Frédéric Laloux in his book claims that “the principles and practices” of liberated 

companies “can be adopted by small and large organizations alike” (LALOUX, 2014, 

p. 238). The way these practices are implemented in major companies is peculiar and 

will be presented in the next section. 

3.3.1. The degree of liberalization is correlated with the size of the companies 

Since the company with the lowest liberalization score (1,7 out of 10) is the 

company with the most employees (56 000), and the company with the highest 

liberalization score (9.6) is a company with only nine employees, the comparison of the 

liberalization score with the size of the companies studied was undertaken. As it can be 

clearly seen in the table below, in the sample the more employees a company has, the 

less liberated the company is.

I. Getz (2015) in an interview considered indeed that a liberation process could take 

up to three years for a small and medium-sized enterprise and up to ten years for larger 

organizations, suggesting stronger barriers for large companies.  

3.3.2. Limiting the size of teams 

F. Laloux asserts in his book that “when organizations grow larger, say beyond 

twenty employees, running the show as a single team becomes unpractical” (LALOUX, 

2014, p. 323). Therefore, to tackle this issue of the size, large corporations have divided 

their facilities into self-managed teams of limited numbers of employees. Such modest 

size units have the advantage of being “adaptable enough and responsive enough” 

(PETERS, 1992, p. 383), and are considered “essential for putting employees in touch 

with one another so they can coordinate their work” (SEMLER, 1989, p. 3). However, 

scholars are quite divided on the optimal size of such “modest size” units. 

For the anthropologist R. Dunbar, "the figure of 150 seems to represent the 

maximum number of individuals with whom we can have a genuinely social 

relationship, the kind of relationship that goes with knowing who they are and how they 

relate to us” (DUNBAR, 1998, p. 77). And as Bill Gore (1985) puts it, “a precipitous 

drop in cooperation appears as the group size becomes large enough so that everyone 

no longer “knows” everyone else”. This is why in his company Gore, and also at Semco, 

the number of associate per team/facilities/factory could not exceed 150. 

At Sun Hydraulics, the teams are even larger, kept under “200 to 250 employees in 

any location” (Kaftan and Barnes, 1991, p. 1). 

However, T. Peters (1992) found most often teams comprised of fifty or sixty 

employees, with some exceptions comprised of thirty-five or 200 people. This number 

is more consistent with our findings. Out of the thirty-six companies studied that have 

self-organizing teams, twenty-eight have indicated of how many people maximum 

these teams were comprised. For all of them but one (twenty-seven), the teams did not 



63 

 

 

 

 

go above fifty people. The twenty-eighth company said that all of its employees (300 

people) were actually a self-organizing team. Five other companies of less than fifty 

employees also declared that all of their employees were a self-organizing team. The 

average team was comprised of twenty-three people and the median team of eleven. 

3.3.3. The importance of experimentation 

Larger corporations are on average less liberated. Some large companies decided to 

split every facility into smaller groups. However, this logic applies mostly to large 

companies that are already liberated (Semco, WL Gore, Sun Hydraulics, Favi). For 

companies that are not liberated yet but want to engage on the path of liberalization 

(Auchan, Michelin, Decathlon, Airbus) the process often starts with experimentations. 

In his book, Fréderic Laloux compares the development of Teal Organizations with 

the process of evolution in nature. He explains that “evolution is a formidable process 

that brings forth unfathomable beauty and complexity not through a grand design, but 

by means of relentless, small-scale, parallel experimentation” (LALOUX, 2014, p. 

291). 

This can indeed be seen in large French corporations that recently decided to 

implement some liberation principles. At Airbus, for example, the top management 

showed a willingness to empower its employees. The CEO of Airbus Commercial, 

Fabrice Brégier expressed in 2012 an eagerness to “give more empowerment and on-

the-spot decision-making to our local teams to scrap bureaucracy and shorten lines of 

command.” Therefore, in 2015 the director of the Saint Nazaire factory, Gerald Lignon 

started to innovate in terms of management within his factory of 2 800 employees. 

When Jean Luc Morfouace, head of operations for the A380 within this plant, came to 

him to implement a pilot of “empowerment” on 600 employees, he responded: “if you 

believe in it, go for it”. In an interview in 2015, Gerald Lignon claimed to be “the pilot 

project for the group Airbus” on this concept of liberated companies. 

As it can be seen in the table below, several large companies in France where the 

top management shared a similar goodwill started implementing similar 

experimentations on the base of volunteering.  

Figure 10 Process of experimentation in large companies

Decathlon 78 000 Two shops involved 

Airbus 55 000 A factory of 2 800 employees, and within 

this facility, 600 workers 

 

Frédéric Laloux continues his comparison with the evolution process to express the 

generalization of these prototypes: “Solutions are quickly iterated; what doesn’t work 

is quickly discarded, and what works spreads quickly throughout the system” 

(LALOUX, 2014, p. 292). What is interesting for the objective of this study is how 

these companies then define a “model” of organization by identifying what works and 

what does not, before partially or totally replicating this model within the entire group. 

Airbus, to answer these questions, hired a work psychologist, Alison Caille. As 

explained in the methodology, an interview with her was conducted, to better 

understand the challenges of defining a model in larger corporations. Her role is to 

objectively evaluate what is working and what is not, through established scientific 

methods. At the level of the factory of Gerald Lignon, feedback sessions on the success 

and drawbacks of the A380 experimentation on empowerment have already been 

conducted and inspired other initiatives within the factory. At the level of the group, it 

is still too early to say how the feedback and a potential generalization will happen.

4. Conclusion 

By looking at the organizational structure of thirty-nine companies, the primary 

objective of this research was to find consistencies in the organizational features of 

these enterprises. This approach can help the liberating leaders who believe in the 

philosophy of the liberated companies but believe its implementation is risky and 

complex, and are therefore in need of more elements to start designing their 

organizations. 

The study contributed to this objective. It has led to the conclusion that some 

patterns are consistent in the organizational systems of liberated companies. Thirty-four 

out of the thirty-nine organization surveyed have at least half of the twenty-five patterns 

identified, and with eleven patterns found in a range from seventy-four to one hundred 

percent of organizations surveyed, there is substantial evidence supporting the 

hypothesis. 

Therefore, if these patterns are not meant to be prescriptive, as Frédéric Laloux 

explains, “some practices stand out as natural candidates that any founding team should 

at least consider” (LALOUX, 2014, p. 261). Fourteen other features were classified as 

inconsistent, giving credit to the theory of I. Getz that each company has to construct 

its own organizational structure within a cultural context. 

This study is a quantitative study based on a sample of 39 answers, among which 

only four companies have been investigated before, when we have seen in the 

introduction that the case studies were often overlapping in the existing literature. This 

novelty allowed some findings that are quite different from the existing literature, 

paving the road for further research. For example, the feature of “not having a budget,” 

was not retained in our preliminary research as a primary characteristic of the 114 

liberated companies of the universe. But since it was considered by F. Laloux as one of 

the features of Teal organizations, we included this characteristic in our study, as 

explained in the methodology section. However, this feature was rarely encountered, 

with only 9% of the sample mentioning it. Reversely, profit-sharing, a feature not 

widely commented in the literature, has been found in three-fourths of the companies 

of the sample. 



66 

 

 

 

 

This research has, however, some limitations. The main one is that there is no 

control group. For example, eighty-nine percent of the companies of the sample don’t 

have a control department. However, fifty-nine percent of the sample is comprised of 

companies with fifty or less than fifty employees. It would be interesting to see what 

percentage of businesses of this size have a control department to infer insightful results 

from our sample. Likewise, forty-seven percent of companies in the sample have an 

explicit conflict resolution process, and twenty-eight percent are letting their employees 

set their own salaries. Even if these figures are relatively small compared to other 

features, they might be high in comparison to a more traditional organization. 

As for future research, Isaac Getz and Frederic Laloux already investigated the 

necessary conditions of a liberated company: The CEO must have adopted a worldview 

consistent with the philosophy of a liberated company, and the owners must also 

understand and embrace these practices. These authors have also studied the importance 

of having a clear and inspiring purpose. 

The risk of such organization is also described in the literature, both for employees 

and managers. For employees, F. Laloux explains that “some people have been so 

scarred by years of command and control that they cannot seem to adjust to life without 

a boss” (LALOUX, 2014, p. 269). Bob Koski of Sun Hydraulics said that a liberated 

corporate culture is for “adults only”, and Liisa Joronen of the liberated company SOL 

agreed that it is not for everyone and very tough on some people (GETZ, 2009). G. 

Hamel also admits that “not everyone is suited to Morning Star’s model” and that “an 

individual who has spent years working in a highly stratified organization often has 

difficulty adjusting” (HAMEL, 2011, p. 6). 

Furthermore, as Tom Peters (1992) noticed, “it is managers who are having the 

toughest time making the shift.” The risk is for them to perceive changes as a loss of 

power. In 2008 the CEO of WL Gore, Terri Kelly, expressed that “for many folks, 

giving up power and actually tapping into the knowledge, and not being a person that’s 

in control and ultimately the decision maker, is scary” (STERN, 2008, p. 2). 

The research could, therefore, focus on the prevention of such risks, on the process 

of implementation of liberated practices (experimentation, feedback, risk-taking 



67 

 

 

 

 

environment), and on the results of such practices regarding engagement and financial 

performance.
