resumo 
 

 

As espécies persistem ao longo do tempo devido à troca de indivíduos entre 
subpopulações. No ambiente marinho, a maioria dos organismos bentónicos 
têm ciclos de vida complexos, envolvendo larvas pelágicas que são 
transportadas por correntes oceânicas contribuindo para dispersão das 
espécies. A dispersão larvar estabelece conectividade entre populações 
geograficamente separadas e afeta a estrutura da população. O conhecimento 
deste processo biológico promove informações importantes para a conservação 
de populações marinhas. Este estudo investiga a estrutura genética e 
conectividade de populações de mexilhão de profundidade entre habitats 
fragmentados no NE Atlântico e Mediterrânico. O gene mitocondrial, Citocromo 
Oxidase I (mtCOI), foi utilizado para analisar diversidade genética por local e a 
estrutura populacional de duas espécies de mexilhão, Idas modiolaeformis e 
"Idas" simpsoni. As populações de cada uma das espécies não se encontram 
geograficamente isoladas. A presença de um haplótipo dominante para cada 
espécie sugere a partilha de polimorfismos ancestrais entre populações do 
Mediterrâneo e do NE Atlântico. As populações de I. modiolaeformis 
demonstraram uma elevada diferenciação genética, indicando estruturação da 
metapopulação. Populações distantes umas das outras, localizadas no Atlântico 
e E Mediterrâneo, revelaram baixas distâncias genéticas, sugerindo fluxo 
genético entre as duas regiões. Distâncias genéticas e geográficas suportam o 
modelo de ilha como o modelo para a estrutura populacional de I. 
modiolaeformis. Uma grande desvantagem deste estudo está relacionada com 
o número discrepante de indivíduos entre populações. Para investigar os 
padrões de conectividade em diferentes escalas espaciais serão necessários 
mais estudos, utilizando mais espécimes e outros marcadores genéticos.

abstract 

 
Species persist over time, due to exchange of individuals between 
subpopulations. In the marine environment, most benthic organisms have 
complex life cycles including pelagic larvae that are transported by ocean 
currents promoting species dispersal. Larval dispersal connects geographically 
distant populations and determines population structure. The knowledge about 
this biologic process provides relevant information for conservation of marine 
populations. This study investigates the genetic structure and connectivity of 
deep-sea mussel populations between fragmented habitats in the NE Atlantic 
and Mediterranean. The mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase I (mtCOI) gene was 
used to analyze site-specific genetic diversity and the population structure of two 
mussel species, Idas modiolaeformis and “Idas” simpsoni. Populations of each 
species are not geographically isolated. The presence of one dominant 
haplotype for each species suggests shared ancestral polymorphisms between 
Mediterranean and NE Atlantic populations. The overall high genetic 
differentiation observed in I. modiolaeformis indicates that the metapopulation is 
structured. Distant populations, located in Atlantic and E Mediterranean, 
revealed low genetic distances, suggesting gene flow between the two regions. 
Genetic and geographical distances support an island model of I. modiolaeformis 
population structure. A major drawback of this study is concerned with the 
discrepant number of individuals among populations. Further research will be 
needed, using more specimens and other gene markers, to investigate 
connectivity patterns at different spatial scales.

Introduction

INTRODUCTION 

 

The term biological conservation emerged in the 80s, responding to threats and losses 

of biodiversity. The goal of this discipline is to understand, protect and perpetuate biological 

diversity among all scales and levels of biological organization, so present and future 

generations can sustainably explore and use them. Nowadays, conservation brings 

together ecological, environmental, social, economic and political fields, among other 

disciplines (Meine, 2010). Prevention measures require the study of species distribution, 

abundance and ecological functions, and evaluation of risks and threats for species 

conservation (reviewed in Goodsell and Underwood, 2009).  

Regarding the marine environment, conservation of species or habitats is achieved 

through establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs) and legislation (restriction, 

regulation or prohibition of habitats destruction or modification). MPAs range from totally 

closed to any anthropogenic activity, to limited catches or temporary closures to human 

actions. The implementation of marine reserves restores biodiversity of endangered species 

or important habitats and increases fisheries, creating long-term economic benefits. 

However, in a short term, measures of conservation generate conflict with economic 

interests. Thus, design and management of MPAs should integrate not only ecological 

concerns, but also economic, political and social issues (reviewed in Goodsell and 

Underwood, 2009). 

Corridors between reserves were proved to be extremely important, once they allow 

exchange of individuals/genes preventing extinction of populations due to inbreeding 

depression. For many marine populations, ocean currents serve as corridors for organisms 

dispersal (reviewed in Goodsell and Underwood, 2009). Genetic connectivity between 

MPAs is an important factor to the maintenance of MPA networks (Bell, 2008). For this 

reason, knowledge about hydrodynamics, dispersal and connectivity between populations 

is important to the management of MPAs. 

Dispersal, settlement and recruitment are biological processes extremely important to 

the ecology (geographical distribution, abundance) and evolution of marine populations 

(reviewed in Jenkins et al., 2009; Marshall et al., 2009). Larval dispersal is inferred from 

gene flow between populations and population structure. Recently, molecular genetic 

markers (indirect approaches) have been used to estimate gene/larval exchange between 

populations (Marshall et al., 2009). 

Population structure and connectivity research provides important data, for example 

inferences about source-sink dynamics, habitat’s ability for recolonization, among other

relevant information (Boschen et al., 2015; Marshall et al., 2009), which is crucial to 

conservation of marine populations (Thaler et al., 2014; Marshall et al., 2009).  

This dissertation intends to increase the knowledge about population structure and 

connectivity that will be useful to advice on legislation and management strategies for 

marine habitats. In this study, I used a genetic approach to investigate the population 

structure of two deep-sea chemosymbiotic mussels (Idas spp.), providing new insights into 

population connectivity among fragmented habitats in the NE Atlantic and Mediterranean 

area. Following is a description of the chapters’ content: 

 

Chapter 1 reviews concepts of population structure and connectivity, which in organisms 

with a larval stage is maintained by larval supply into the environment, larval dispersal to 

other populations, and also settlement and recruitment in new habitats. This study 

addresses deep-sea populations, thus deep-water ecosystems were briefly characterized, 

with a particular focus on reduced habitats, inhabited by chemosymbiotic mussels, followed 

by an overview of the main threats to these habitats and examples of deep-ocean MPAs. 

Finally, knowledge about deep-sea mussels was reviewed, specifically the Bathymodiolinae 

subfamily, indicating reproductive adaptations to reduced habitats.  

Chapter 2 presents the framework of this project, including recent studies on population 

genetic structure and connectivity, and a brief mention to the CHEMECO project that 

provided samples for this study. The objectives of this work are defined. 

Chapter 3 describes the geology and hydrodynamics of the study region and 

characterizes the habitats where species were found. Methods used in sampling collection, 

DNA sequencing and data analyses are described. The dataset (including available 

GenBank sequences) used in this investigation is provided. 

Chapter 4 presents the results, namely the success rate of DNA extractions, 

amplifications, and sequencing, followed by the phylogenetic reconstruction and population 

structure analyses, including haplotype network, AMOVA, SAMOVA, pairwise genetic 

distances, and lastly, correlation analysis between geographic and genetic distances. 

Chapter 5 discusses the data obtained in this study in comparison with other studies, 

and its interpretation. 

Chapter 6 refers the main conclusions and limitations of this study, and some 

improvements are suggested for future research, as well as further methods for 

investigating population structure and connectivity in the deep sea.

Chapter 1. LITERATURE REVIEW  

 

1.1. Population structure and connectivity 

 

The exchange of individuals between populations is crucial for the persistence of 

populations. Over time, a population prevails when the number of births and immigration 

are superior or equal to the number of deaths and emigration (Cowen and Sponaugle, 2009; 

Lowe and Allendorf, 2010). If the population does not have migrants neither entering nor 

leaving the population, yet births are superior to deaths, this population is considered as 

closed. In this case, problems deriving from inbreeding may occur, such as infertility or loss 

of viability, due to matting between genetically closely-related individuals (Allendorf and 

Luikart, 2007; Cowen and Sponaugle, 2009; Gillespie, 1998). If the population exchanges 

(receive and export) individuals with other populations, it is considered as an open 

population. The random exchange between open populations is known as panmixia (Cowen 

and Sponaugle, 2009; Hellberg et al., 2002). 

Most natural populations cannot behave as a single randomly mating population, 

because species can occupy vast geographical areas or have barriers to migration 

(Gillespie, 1998). Natural populations are generally subdivided or structured in smaller units, 

where local random matting may occur (Allendorf and Luikart, 2007). The largest population 

can be referred as metapopulation and the units can be named populations or 

subpopulations. Hence, metapopulation is defined as an “assemblage of discrete local 

populations with some measure of shared migration among them” (Cowen and Sponaugle, 

2009; pg 444). 

The metapopulation structure is expected to reflect genetic variation within and between 

local populations (Allendorf and Luikart, 2007). The study of population genetic structure 

investigates which evolutionary forces (migration, genetic drift or natural selection) are 

responsible for the genetic variation across a geographic area (Allendorf and Luikart, 2007; 

Gillespie, 1998). According to the Hardy-Weinberg principle, the transmission of genetic 

information over generations occurs without mutation (locus equilibrium) in a randomly 

mating population without evolutionary forcing, such as genetic drift, natural selection and 

migration. Thus, genetic differentiation between populations indicates deviations to the 

Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (Gillespie, 1998).  

Empirical models of metapopulation structure vary according to population size and 

isolation (Aycrigg and Garton, 2014). Considering the complete isolation of the populations, 

one can make two assumptions: random mating and genetic drift in each isolated

subpopulation. Over time, each subpopulation will fix one or more alleles. However, 

migration usually occurs which implies gene flow among populations. The most simplified 

case is to consider two equal sized populations with bidirectional exchange of individuals. 

We can consider gene flow with or without genetic drift. When isolated populations are 

subject to gene flow and genetic drift, populations will be genetically distinct (Allendorf and 

Luikart, 2007). 

Gene flow tends to genetically homogenize the individuals of geographically separated 

populations but, on the other hand, genetic drift and natural selection cause divergence 

within a metapopulation. Neutral evolution attributes the genetic variation within a 

population to migration and genetic drift, excluding natural selection. Therefore, neutral 

gene divergence between populations will be a balance of gene flow (due to dispersal) and 

genetic drift (Allendorf and Luikart, 2007; Hartl and Clark, 1997). 

Based on different patterns of gene flow, several models are used to describe the 

structuring of populations (Figure 1).

 The island model has two versions. In the first version, populations have equal size and 

equal rate of gene exchange (classical). All populations contribute to a common gene pool 



Chapter 1. Literature review

where mating occurs randomly. In the second version (mainland-island), one largest 

panmictic population exists as well as few smaller populations (islands) that receive genes 

from the mainland. Isolation-by-distance model suggests that genetic distances depend on 

the distance between neighboring populations and on the size of the population (Altukhov, 

2006). The stepping-stone model represents one intermediate situation between the island 

model and the isolation-by-distance model. The stepping-stone structure assumes that the 

exchange of genes only occurs between the neighbor populations, considering equal size 

of populations and equal migration rates (Altukhov, 2006).  

The interchange among geographically distant (sub)populations contributes to 

metapopulation connectivity (Cowen and Sponaugle, 2009). In this way, studies about 

population structure allow inferences about connectivity. Population connectivity can be 

viewed from two perspectives: demographic connectivity and genetic connectivity. 

Demographic connectivity can be defined as the degree to which population growth and 

vital rates (birth and survival) are affected by dispersal (immigration or emigration rates) 

(Lowe and Allendorf, 2010). Genetic connectivity depends on the absolute number of 

dispersers (emigration) among populations and can be defined as the “degree to which 

gene flow affects evolutionary processes within subpopulations” (Lowe and Allendorf, 

2010). Genetic methods are most useful to infer genetic connectivity, but provide little 

information on demographic connectivity. 

Most marine benthic species have complex life cycles including sessile/sedentary adults 

and a pelagic larval phase that is the main responsible for species dispersal (Thorson, 

1950). Marine population connectivity includes the dispersal phase from reproduction to 

habitat selection, metamorphosis and complete settlement processes (Figure 2) (reviewed 

in Cowen and Sponaugle, 2009).

1.1.1. Larval supply and dispersal  

 

The exchange of individuals, and therefore genes, is related with the rates of dispersal 

between populations (Allendorf and Luikart, 2007). Supply of larvae is highly variable, 

influencing strongly both ecology and evolution of marine taxa (reviewed in Marshall et al., 

2009). Self-recruitment (reproduction inside a subpopulation) also occurs, mainly in species 

from patchy habitats, due to the low probability of finding suitable habitats to settle (Cowen 

and Sponaugle, 2009; Swearer et al., 2002). 

The production of larvae depends on fecundity (ability of gametes production) and 

fertilization success (zygotes production). Fecundity is influenced by intrinsic and extrinsic 

factors. On one hand, nutritional history, maternal size and age are intrinsic factors that 

restrict gametes production. On the other hand, environmental stress, intra- and inter-

competition can represent some extrinsic factors that regulate fecundity (Ramirez-Llodra, 

2002). Variation of fecundity results from egg quantity and quality, for instance, the eggs’ 

dimensions, which affect fertilization success (larger female gametes have better chances 

of being fertilized) (Gaudron et al., 2012). 

 In the majority of marine animals fertilization is external, meaning that larval production 

is not reflected by fecundity (Gaudron et al., 2012). Fertilization success has great 

fluctuations, rarely reaching 100%. The probability of female and male gamete encounters, 

gametes quality, local hydrodynamics, density population and intra-specific competition are 

some factors that affect fertilization success (reviewed in Marshall et al., 2009). 



Chapter 1. Literature review

Dispersal processes depend on physical and biological factors. Physical factors consist 

of currents and turbulence that mix larvae, allowing the expansion or limiting their spatial 

distribution. Biological factors include larval behaviour (vertical migration, swimming) and 

predator/prey interactions (Cowen and Sponaugle, 2009; Marshall et al., 2009). Some 

environmental features may influence larval behaviour (Cowen and Sponaugle, 2009). 

Sameoto and Metaxas (2008) showed that larval physiological tolerance to temperature 

and salinity influence vertical distribution, affecting adult population distributions, genetic 

flow and dispersal movements. 

Mortality of dispersing larvae results from physical, environmental and biological factors, 

for example ocean currents, pollution, salinity changes, availability of suitable settlement 

habitat, predation and post-settlement survivorship. The mortality during the planktonic 

period affects the dispersal distance and the quantity of recruited larvae into a population 

(Cowen and Sponaugle, 2009; Marshall et al., 2009). 

Pelagic Larval Duration (PLD) is the time that larvae spend dispersing in water column 

(Shanks et al., 2003). Species phylogeny and environmental features determine PLD. Thus, 

PLD can be season-, species- and location-specific (Cowen and Sponaugle, 2009; Hilário 

et al., 2015). Hilário and other authors (2015) reviewed the knowledge about PLD, 

concluding that PLD vary with bathymetric range of benthic organisms. Shallow organisms 

(depth&lt;200 m) have a shorter and less variable PLD (25-30.35 days), whereas deep-sea 

organisms (depth&gt;200 m) have a larger and more variable PLD (73.40-96.63 days). This 

measure may be used to estimate dispersal distances, when it is coupled with advection 

velocity. Dispersal distances estimated for several taxa range from a few meters to 1000 

kilometres (Cowen and Sponaugle, 2009). However, this approach is limited, since 

dispersal processes relate not only with the larvae pelagic time, but also involve larval 

behaviour and hydrodynamic processes. Therefore, the use of biophysical models, 

incorporating physical features (temperature, salinity, velocity of oceanic currents, etc) with 

biological features (larva’s feeding regime, larval behaviour, PLD, etc), are crucial to 

estimate dispersal distance (reviewed in Hilário et al., 2015). 

 

1.1.2. Settlement and recruitment  

 

The free-swimming larval stage (dispersal) culminates on the settlement of competent 

individuals (reviewed in Cowen and Sponaugle, 2009). Settlement processes involve the 

contact of larvae with substrate, the exploration and inspection, and also the acceptance or 

rejection of the site. Thus, settlement usually represents the end of the pelagic period and 



Chapter 1. Literature review 

8 

the initiation of the sedentary life. Larval behaviour, regulated by physical and biological 

cues, allows larvae to choose between accepting and rejecting the settlement site. When 

larvae reject the settlement site, they are released from the substrate returning to the water 

column. When larvae accept the site, settlers attach to the substrate and then 

metamorphosis occurs. To ensure that settlement occurs in an appropriate environment 

(that allow larval survival, growth and reproduction) larvae respond to a set of cues that 

stimulates settlement behaviour. Some examples of biological cues are food supply, 

microbial film and presence of conspecifics (potential mates), competitors and predators. 

Physical cues include availability of space, rock type and mineral composition, micro-

topography, temperature, salinity, hydrostatic flow and pressure, among others. Settlement 

processes lead to a high mortality rate, since the larvae suffer considerable morphological 

changes at the metamorphosis (reviewed in Jenkins et al., 2009).  

The term recruitment lies ill-defined, however it is considered a combination of settlement 

and post-settlement period, when growth and reproduction occur. Recruitment pattern can 

be influenced by density-dependent interactions or by the nutritional requirements at the 

benthic stage. Recruitment shows spatial and temporal variability due to environmental 

conditions and intraspecific competition (for food and space) (reviewed in Jenkins et al., 

2009). 

 

1.2. Deep-sea ecosystems 

 

Oceans cover approximately 70% of the earth’s surface and a large portion (~ 50%) is 
below 3000 m depth (Tyler, 2003). The deep sea is defined from the beginning of the shelf 

break at approximately 200 m depth and comprises 95% of the volume of the biosphere 

(Danovaro et al., 2014; Thistle, 2003). Its exploration began in the late 19th century, 

revealing over the past decades several new geological features (e.g. hydrothermal vents 

and cold seeps) and highly abundant biological communities (Tyler, 2003). 

The vast deep-sea habitat is found in an environment considered relatively stable, 

characterized by high pressures, low food input and oxygen concentration, and generally 

low temperatures. The temperature decreases with increasing depth, except at 

hydrothermal vents, where high temperatures (260-400ºC) can be reached (Fisher et al., 

2007; Thistle, 2003). On the abyssal plain the temperature reaches -2ºC to 2ºC (Thistle, 

2003). Erosional and depositional processes lead terrigenous, intertidal and subtidal 

organic material to become coastal particulate organic matter (POM). Small particles (e.g. 

remains of plankton, fecal pellets, etc), large animal carcasses and plant detritus sink until 



Chapter 1. Literature review 

9 

reaching the deep-sea floor, turning into POM. Also, dissolved organic matter represents 

an organic input into the deep sea. Contrasting with usually slow near-bottom water 

currents, occasional periods of fast flow (e.g. benthic storms and dense shelf water 

cascades) increase the horizontal food flux and consequently benefit some species (Gage, 

2003).  

In addition to temperature drop, increasing depth causes an abrupt light intensity 

decrease. Below ~250 m depth, light penetration can no longer support photosynthesis. An 

alternative process of primary production is through chemosynthesis. This is one of the 

particular features that differentiates some deep sea habitats (reviewed in Thistle, 2003). 

 

1.2.1. Reducing habitats 

 

Hydrothermal vents, cold seeps, whale and wood falls are chemosynthesis-based 

ecosystems with primary production being guaranteed by chemoautotrophic bacteria (Distel 

et al., 2000; Duperron et al., 2008; Fisher et al., 2007; Smith and Baco, 2003). These 

chemoautotrophs produce organic compounds using geochemical energy generated from 

the oxidation of reduced compounds, such us sulphate and nitrate (Duperron et al., 2008; 

Fisher et al., 2007). The chemosynthetic bacteria support the microbial ecosystem and the 

animal communities establishing symbiotic associations (Fisher et al., 1994 in Fisher et al., 

2007; Duperron, 2010). The term symbiosis used in this context refers to the “close 

association between a metazoan host and bacteria allowing the host to gain novel metabolic 

capabilities” (Douglas, 1994 in Duperron, 2010; pg 138).  

In hydrothermal vents that are usually located on active tectonic plate boundaries (Figure 

3), the water is heated and enriched in reduced compounds such us sulphide and metals. 

The interactions between the geo-thermally heated fluids and cold seawater precipitate the 

dissolved minerals and metals forming chimneys (Duperron, 2010). Hydrothermal vent 

communities include a great diversity of invertebrate phyla, such as Annelida, Mollusca, 

Crustacea, among others. Octopuses and fishes also occur near this habitat (Fisher et al., 

2007; Tunnicliffe et al., 1998). In contrast, cold seeps occur mostly along continental 

margins (Figure 3). In cold seeps, the organic matter is reduced by thermogenesis and 

biogenesis, producing hydrocarbon and methane-rich fluids that are released to the water 

column (Duperron, 2010). At these habitats, small bivalves are abundant (particularly 

families: Mytilidae, Vesicomyidae, Thyasiridae), and siboglinid polychaetes are also present 

(Cunha et al., 2013a; Hilário et al., 2011; Hilário et al., 2010; Olu-Le Roy et al., 2004; 

Rodrigues et al., 2008).  



Chapter 1. Literature review 

10 

Figure 3 – Distribution of hydrothermal vents (violet) and cold seeps (green) (Danovaro et al., 2014). 
 

In addition to vent and seep habitats, organic falls are also reduced habitats. Submerged 

mammal skeletons, wood, kelp, seagrass and other organic deposits are ephemeral (short-

lived) and fragmented (because organic flux is intermittent in space) habitats (Smith and 

Baco, 2003; Tunnicliffe et al., 2003). Sunken bones have sulphide-reducing bacteria that 

reduce lipids into hydrogen sulphide (Smith and Baco, 2003). The product of bacterial 

decomposition in sunken wood is also sulphide (Distel et al., 2000). The organic 

decomposition produces reduced compounds (reviewed in Tunicliffe et al., 2003), enabling 

chemosymbiotic and other species to settle (Smith and Baco, 2003; Tunnicliffe et al., 1998). 

Indeed, deep-sea organisms have a rapid and vigorous response to the sunken wood input. 

For instance, wood is colonised mainly by specialized molluscs, polychaetes and 

occasionally vestimentiferan tube worms (Turner, 1973; Gage, 2003; Tunnicliffe et al., 

2003).  

The availability of habitat for settlement, such as organic falls, can reduce dispersal 

distances of organisms. Owing to this fact, organic falls have an important role in deep-sea 

ecology and in biogeographic distribution of chemosymbiotic species (Génio et al., 2014). 

Interestingly, some taxa may occur in vents, seeps, whales and wood falls (Tunnicliffe et 

al., 1998). The taxonomic overlap between these habitats suggested that organic falls can 

serve as “dispersal stepping stones” for seep and vent habitats (Smith and Baco, 2003; 

Tunnicliffe et al., 1998).

1.2.2. Threats to deep-sea habitats 

 

Deep-sea habitats as well as other marine ecosystems are threatened. Climate change, 

pollutant contamination (Figure 4A and AB), debris, over-harvesting and habitat loss are 

some examples of such threats. In some cases, the impact on the habitats are more 

intensive, in others are more extensive, leading to different consequences for biota 

(reviewed in Goodsell and Underwood, 2009). 

 

 

Figure 4 – Example of anthropogenic impacts in deep sea: litter collected from Mediterranean at 
1200 m (A) and at 3000 m in Pacific Ocean (B); oil discharge in water column in Gulf of Mexico (C) 
and deep-sea coral covered with oil in Gulf de Mexico (D). Images from Ramirez-Llodra et al. (2011). 

 

Metals and minerals are widely extracted from land and onshore reserves. However, as 

these resources are being depleted, exploration is moving to deeper, offshore areas. 

Manganese nodules, cobalt crusts and massive sulphides are important deposits of metals 

in the deep-sea (depths&gt;4000 m) and have great economic relevance. Nowadays, sea-floor 

mining is still very expensive, but underwater mining equipment is being developed, and 

environment impact of this activity is still uncertain (Lange et al., 2014). Some ecological 

studies have been conducted in order to minimize the exploration impacts (Vanreusel et al., 

2016). 

Similar to mineral exploration, the great oil and gas consumption lead to depletion of 

shallow-water reserves, driving the exploration of these resources at deeper depths (Lange 

et al., 2014). The exploration of oil and gas has enormous consequences to the marine 

environment (Figure 4C and 4D), resulting from routine activity or accidental contamination 

from extraction stations. Some of the routine activity impacts include: excess of 

sedimentation, chemical contamination of the water, damage of hard substratum (such as 

coral reefs), as well as light and sound pollution. Accidental impacts resulting from oil and 



Chapter 1. Literature review 

12 

gas release are: contamination of water, fauna mortality and disturbance of marine 

community (reviewed in Cordes et al., 2016). 

Marine protected areas (MPAs) have been implemented to preserve biodiversity and 

habitats (reviewed in Goodsell and Underwood, 2009). In the last decades, concerns about 

deep-sea habitats and biodiversity are increasing, and a few MPA have already been 

established in deep water. The first deep-sea habitats protected were hydrothermal vents, 

the Lucky Stricke and Menez Gwen vent fields (Azores) in 2002 and Endeavour Segment 

(Canada) in 2003 (Leary, 2006; Vrijenhoek, 2010). 

Aiming to the management of the manganese nodules mining at Clarion-Clipperton Zone 

(Pacific Ocean), the International Seabed Authorithy (ISA) assigned in 2012 areas of 

particular environmental interest (APEI’s), prohibiting mineral extraction in a total area of 

160000 km2 (Lange et al., 2014). 

Recently, July of 2015, the Portuguese government declared the seamounts of the 

Gorringe Bank as marine protected area, with depths ranging from 25 to 5000 m. The area 

proposed to conservation has 2 288 782.11 hectares - Resolução do Conselho de Ministros 

n.º 59/2015 (Diário da República, 2015). 

 

1.3. Deep-sea mussels – close look to Bathymodiolins (Bivalvia: Mytilidae) 
 

Over the years, several species of mussels have been reported worldwide from 200 to 

3600 m depth. About 37 species have been found associated to reduced environments 

including vents, seeps and organic falls (e.g. whale carcasses or sunken wood) (Baco and 

Smith, 2003; Distel et al., 2000; Duperron, 2010; Smith and Baco, 2003). However, more 

hidden diversity have recently been found based on molecular research (Faure et al., 2015; 

Génio et al., 2014; Lorion et al., 2009).  

The remarkable difference between deep-sea mussels and their coastal relatives is the 

occurrence of chemosynthetic bacterial endosymbionts (Duperron et al., 2008; Duperron, 

2010). Regarding the Mytilidae family, all subfamilies are assymbiotic except for the 

Bathymodiolinae subfamily, containing chemosymbiotic species (Taylor and Glover, 2010). 

Moreover, mytilids have an important role in the deep-sea ecosystem, providing hard 

substratum (ecosystem engineers), available food sources such as feacal pellets (for 

detritus feeders) and dead remains (for scavengers) (Turner, 1973). 

The origin of the Bathymodiolinae subfamily was registered between the Cenozoic and 

the late Mesozoic. Bathymodiolins have a pattern of evolution from shallow (&lt;1000 m) to 

deep habitats, with multiple re-radiations in deeper waters (Jones et al., 2006; Lorion et al., 



Chapter 1. Literature review 

13 

2013). These authors suggested that shallow-water cold seeps, hydrothermal seamounts 

and hydrocarbon deposits may have served as a refuge during extinction events 

(anoxic/dysoxic events) in deep-sea environments. Hence, these refuges provided 

opportunities to new evolutionary radiation into deep waters. Furthermore, it was proposed 

that seep and vent mussels derived from ancestors associated with wood and other organic-

falls habitats, proving that deep-sea mussels took “wooden steps to deep-sea vents” (Distel 

et al., 2000; Lorion et al., 2013). This supports the hypothesis of multiple events of vent and 

seep colonization across geological time (Distel et al., 2000; Duperron, 2010; Lorion et al., 

2013).  

Over time, this evolution from organic-enriched habitats to vent/seep habitats was 

unidirectional, indicating an irreversible specialization mainly due to anatomical and 

physiological adaptations (Lorion et al., 2013). It is possible to distinguish two main groups 

within bathymodiolins: mussels with larger shells living in hydrothermal vents and cold 

seeps (genus Bathymodiolus, Gigantidas and Vulcanidas) and smaller mussels that exist 

predominantly in sunken organic substrates (genus Idas, Adipicola and Benthomodiolus) 

(Lorion et al., 2013; Smith et al., 1998; Smith and Baco, 2003; Taylor and Glover, 2010; 

Turner, 1973). 

The main adaptations of mussels to chemosynthetic habitats are related with feeding 

and reproductive strategies (Le Pennec and Beninger, 2000). Most bathymodiolins harbor 

sulphur-oxidizing and/or methane-oxidizing symbionts in their gill epithelial cells (Duperron 

et al., 2008; Duperron, 2010; Fisher et al., 1987; Laming et al., 2015a). This relationship 

between bacteria and mussels are probably the key for the success of mussels in 

chemosynthetic environments (Duperron, 2010). Sulphur-oxidizing symbionts occur in 

various species, opposed to methane-oxidizing symbionts that are extremely rare among 

bivalves (Duperron, 2010; Taylor and Glover, 2010). The host-symbiont relationship is not 

only characterized by the symbiont type (sulphur or methane-oxidizing), but also by the 

symbiont abundance and diversity (Duperron et al., 2008; Laming et al., 2015a; Laming et 

al., 2015b; Rodrigues et al., 2012). All these features strongly influence the species 

ecological strategies. For instance, high symbiont flexibility (ability of harbor high symbiont 

diversity) indicates the use of diverse energetic sources (Gaudron et al., 2012). 

Chemosymbiotic mussels did not lose the capability of filter feeding, however they need 

reduced compounds to survive, so they have a mixotrophic feeding strategy (Duperron, 

2010). 

Furthermore, reproductive strategies including reproductive cyclicity, larval stage, trophic 

strategy and rate of larval development, growth rate, maturation period, among other 



Chapter 1. Literature review 

14 

features, also contribute to the ecological success of this subfamily in deep-sea 

chemosynthetic habitats (Le Pennec and Beninger, 2000; Turner, 1973; Tyler et al., 2007; 

Tyler et al., 2009). 

 

1.3.1. Reproductive adaptations 

 

The majority of bathymodiolins are dioecious or successive hermaphrodites (Le Pennec 

and Beninger, 2000; Tyler et al., 2009). For instance, the species Idas modiolaeformis, a 

small bathymodiolin is a protandric hermaphrodite, which means that in the early adult life 

the individual is male, then becomes hermaphroditic and in late adulthood the individual 

turns into female (Gaudron et al., 2012; Laming et al., 2014; Tyler et al., 2009).  

Reproductive cyclicity appears to depend on the degree of endosymbiosis and presence 

of environmental cues, such as organic matter flux and temperatures (Le Pennec and 

Beninger, 2000; Tyler et al., 2007). In habitats with few or without environmental cues 

species can have a discontinuous reproductive activity (mixotrophic species) or continuous 

reproductive activity (species with obligate symbionts). In habitats where environmental 

cues exist, discontinuous reproductive activity is detected (reviewed in Le Pennec and 

Beninger, 2000). For example, the cold-seep species “Bathymodiolus” childressi has 

periodic gametogenic cycles (Arellano and Young, 2009). 

The acquisition of larval pelagic stage was another relevant adaptation to colonization of 

patchy habitats (Tyler et al., 2007). The trophic strategy of larvae and the larval development 

rate can be inferred from the oocyte size. Deep-sea bivalves with small oocytes are 

planktotrophic or exotrophic (feeding larvae) and bivalves with larger oocytes are 

lecithotrophic or endotrophic (Arellano and Young, 2011; Danovaro et al., 2014; Le Pennec 

and Beninger, 2000). Larval development rate depends on food availability and once again 

oocyte dimensions. Usually, larger oocytes have faster rates and vice-versa. The trophic 

strategy of larvae influences larval duration and dispersal strategy (reviewed in Le Pennec 

and Beninger, 2000). Gaudron et al. (2012) suggested a pelagic larvae duration of 4-5 

months for the mussel I. modiolaeformis and also inferred that the larval development is 

likely planktotrophic. “Idas” simpsoni has also planktotrophic larvae (Laming et al., 2015a). 

“Bathymodiolus” childressi has a longer PLD compared to smaller bathymodiolins, as they 

are able to remain more than 13 months in the plankton. The occurrence of a planktotrophic 

larva was also demonstrated for this genus (Arellano et al., 2014; Arellano and Young, 

2009).  



Chapter 1. Literature review 

15 

Lastly, growth and maturation rates relate with reproductive strategies. The rapid 

development to achieve reproductive maturity may indicate the species adaptation to patchy 

and ephemeral habitats (Gaudron et al., 2012). Bathymodiolus species have an estimated 

growth rate of 0.048 mm per day (Arellano and Young, 2009). “Bathymodiolus” childressi is 

considered mature with shell sizes ranging between 50-120 mm (Arellano and Young, 

2009), corresponding to a maturation age of about 3 years (shell length: 50 mm) (Rhoads 

et al.,1981). Idas growth rate ranges between 0.017 and 0.029 mm per day, with the first 

maturation being reached at 2-4 months of age (shell length: 2-2.35 mm) (Génio et al., 

2014; Laming et al., 2015a; Laming et al., 2015b).

Chapter 2. FRAMEWORK AND OBJECTIVES  

 

Population genetic structure is based on the study of DNA variation in natural 

populations. Several methods are used to detect variation in DNA, from mitochondrial DNA 

to nuclear DNA, including single base polymorphisms (SNPs), microsatellites, and others. 

In the current study, mitochondrial DNA was chosen due to a number of characteristics 

that allow assessing patterns of genetic variation: 1) it is haploid; 2) in most species, it is 

maternally inherited; 3) it does not undergo recombination and 4) for most metazoan taxa it 

evolves rapidly, showing recent divergence events (Allendorf and Luikart, 2007; Cowen and 

Sponaugle, 2009; Hartl and Clark, 1997). For deep-sea mytilids, the mitochondrial DNA 

Cytochrome Oxidase subunit I (mtCOI) gene is assumed to diverge at a rate of ? 1-2% per 

Myr (Lorion et al., 2012; Won et al., 2003). 

Several studies to assess deep-sea population connectivity and population structure 

have been conducted recently using the mtCOI gene. For instance, population structure 

and connectivity of the shrimp (Chorocaris sp. 2) and the squat lobster (Munidopsis 

lauensis) (Thaler et al., 2014); interpopulational relationships of Bathymodiolus 

septemdierum complex in Indo-Pacific deep-sea vents (Breusing et al., 2015); distribution 

and population connectivity of several Bathymodiolus species occurring in the Gulf of 

Mexico cold seeps (Faure et al., 2015). Few genetic connectivity studies have integrated 

both Atlantic and Mediterranean areas (Affinito et al., 2015; Andreakis et al., 2009; Correia 

et al., 2012; Griffiths et al., 2011). Most studies were focused on either the Atlantic (Bradbury 

et al., 2014; Cuveliers et al., 2012; Pita et al., 2016; Ribeiro et al., 2010) or the 

Mediterranean basins (Calò et al., 2016; Casado-Amezúa et al., 2012; Félix-Hackradt et al., 

2013; Garofalo et al., 2009; Maggi and González-Wangüemert, 2015; Pilczynska et al., 

2016; Schiavina et al., 2014). In general, the most commonly studied organisms are fishes, 

whereas genetic connectivity of deep-sea chemosynthesis-based populations has not been 

investigated in this region. 

The deep-sea mussel species found in the Gulf of Cadiz hold a great research potential 

for speciation and divergence over the Atlantic and connectivity in the Eastern 

Mediterranean seeps (Rodrigues et al., 2012). In this work, two deep-sea mussel species 

were used as study organisms: Idas modiolaeformis (Sturany, 1896) and “Idas” simpsoni 

(Marshall, 1900) (Figure 5). Idas modiolaeformis (also named Idas sp. Med) has only been 

recorded in cold seep habitats in the Eastern Mediterranean (Duperron et al., 2008), 

western Mediterranean and Atlantic Ocean (Laming, et al., 2015b; Rodrigues et al., 2012). 

Unlike the usual dense mussel aggregation, Idas modiolaeformis occurs in low densities of 



Chapter 2. Framework and objectives 

18 

individuals and rarely conspecifics have direct contact  (Gaudron et al., 2012; Laming et al., 

2015a). “Idas” simpsoni occurs on carbonates nearby seeps and bone-fall substrata, 

forming several small clumps (Génio et al., 2014; Laming et al., 2014). The taxonomy of 

this last species is under discussion, Thubaut and other authors (2013) proposed that “Idas” 

simpsoni sould be included in the genus Nypamodiolus. Because this name has not been 

formally accepted, I continue to use the generic name Idas but with quotation marks. 

 

 
Figure 5 – Idas modiolaeformis (A), 11 mm (Génio, 2009) and “Idas” simpsoni (B), scale bar: 1 mm 
(Génio et al., 2014).  

 

Samples of I. modiolaeformis were obtained within CHEMECO project. This project 

investigated the process of colonization in reduced deep-sea habitats along the NE Atlantic 

and Mediterranean. The sampling design consisted on deployment and later recovery of 

colonization devices with different types of substrates (wood, alfafa grass and carbonates) 

named CHEMECOLI - CHEMosynthetic Ecosystem COlonization by Larval Invertebrates 

(Cunha et al., 2013b; Gaudron et al., 2010). Idas modiolaeformis mussels were found in 

abundance in the wood and alfafa substrates deployed in Meknès and Darwin mud 

vulcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz. Further specimens of this species were later collected during 

a research cruise in Gorringe Bank on a wood log (Rodrigues et al., 2012). MtCOI 

sequences of Idas modiolaeformis from Mediterranean sites are available in GenBank, 

allowing to expand my NE Atlantic dataset and investigate population structure in a larger 

geographic area. 

After molecular analyses I found “Idas” simpsoni specimens that have been mistakenly 

identified as I. modiolaeformis based on morphological traits. The two species have nearly 

identical shells, particularly the younger specimens, which makes it very hard to distinguish 

them (L. Génio personnal communication). Therefore, sequences of “I.” simpsoni from 

Atlantic and Mediterranean were also obtained from GenBank and added to the my data 

analysis. 

My dissertation aims to study the genetic structure of Idas populations among deep-sea 

chemosynthetic habitats of North East Atlantic and Mediterranean. I expect to clarify the 



Chapter 2. Framework and objectives 

19 

genetic link between deep-sea populations of Idas species, contributing to the 

understanding of molecular mechanisms that regulate biogeographic distributions and 

biodiversity dynamics of deep-sea fragmented habitats (Breusing et al., 2015). 

 

The main goals of this dissertation are: 

I. To characterize the population structure of Idas modiolaeformis and “I.” simpsoni 

found at several deep-sea reduced habitats in the NE Atlantic and in the 

Mediterranean Sea. 

II. To investigate connectivity among the deep-sea reduced and patchy habitats.  

To achieve these goals, I conducted a number of genetic analyses, including: 

- Species molecular identification; 

- Phylogenetic reconstruction; 

- Neutrality test of sequences from each species/population;  

- Estimates of site-specific genetic-diversity per species; 

- Analysis of mitochondrial COI haplotypes (haplotype distribution, frequencies and 

diversity); 

- Estimates of population differentiation and partitioning.

Chapter 3. MATERIAL AND METHODS 

 

3.1. Study area 

 

The dataset analyzed in this study includes specimens collected from three locations in 

the Atlantic Ocean (Gorringe Bank, Darwin and Meknès mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz) 

and GenBank sequences obtained from these three sites and four additional locations (one 

in the Atlantic and three in the Mediterranean Sea). A brief description of geological and 

biological features of the seven collection sites (Figure 6), as well as hydrodynamic 

characteristics of the study region, and estimated linear distances between locations (Table 

1) are presented below. 

 

3.1.1. Biogeographic features 

 

Setúbal submarine canyon is located in the Portuguese West margin (Figure 6). Rapid 

and episodic flushing occurring at submarine canyons are pathways for transport of 

sediment and organic carbon from shelf to deep-sea depths, enhancing local biodiversity. 

Gorgonians, sponges, hydroids, anemones, sea urchins, sea stars, oysters and 

brachiopods are some of the deep-sea fauna found on Setúbal canyon (Weaver et al., 

2007). GenBank sequences were obtained from mussels collected after 18 and 28 months 

on mammal bones there were experimentally deployed at 1000 m depth (Génio et al., 2014). 

The Gorringe Bank (Gor), located South West of Portugal (Figure 6), is a vast undersea 

mountain (length: ~ 180 km; ridge’s width: ~ 70 km) raising up 5000 m above seafloor 
(Banda et al., 1995; Karson et al., 2012; Sallarès et al., 2013; Tortella et al., 1997). The 

Gettysburg and Ormonde seamounts represent the Gorringe Bank highest points, about 50 

m below the sea surface (Karson et al., 2012). These elevated structures act as 

oceanographic barriers inducing local currents, which cause ocean mixing and tidal energy 

dissipation (Pitcher et al., 2007; Wessel et al., 2010). As a result of these particular local 

currents, upwelling can occur around the seamounts, providing nutrients to the deep ocean 

(Pitcher et al., 2007). Thus, primary production is increased, enhancing the occurrence of 

important ecological communities and a high biodiversity (Wessel et al., 2010). At the 

Gorringe Bank it is possible to find sponges, corals, fish, small sessile species in 

abundance, algae, kelp beds, loggerhead turtle and the bottlenose dolphin (Diário da 

República, 2015; Karson et al., 2012; OCEANA, 2005). Samples used in this study came 



Chapter 3. Material and methods 

22 

from a wood log opportunistically collected near the Gettysburg seamount (Laming et al., 

2015b; Rodrigues et al., 2012). 

The Gulf of Cadiz (GoC), located in the North East Atlantic Ocean, was originated by the 

collision between the European and African plates and the migration of the Betic-Rifean Arc 

(Hensen et al., 2007; Medialdea et al., 2004; Tortella et al, 1997). The GoC region contains 

many geological structures associated with fluid escape, such as mud volcanoes, mud-

carbonate mounds, pockmarks, faults and diapirs (Medialdea et al., 2009). In the GoC, over 

40 mud volcanoes (MV’s) exist from the continental shelf to about 3500 m depth (Banda et 

al., 1995; Hensen et al., 2007; Medialdea et al., 2009; OCEANA, 2005). Biologic 

communities at GoC comprise the phyla Annelida, Arthropoda, Mollusca, Echinodermata, 

including some symbiont-hosting species (Cunha et al., 2013a). At the Darwin mud volcano 

(Figure 6) shells of Bathymodiolus (“Bathymodiolus” mauritanicus), Neptunea contraria 

(Linné) and less abundant Leptaxinus minutus were registered by Rodrigues et al. (2013; 

2008). The Meknès MV (Figure 6) has extensive fields of coral mounds, where Rodrigues 

et al. (2008) reported the existence of thyasirids (e.g. Thyasira granulosa), empty shells of 

N. contraria and some megafauna. Individuals here studied were collected from 

CHEMOCOLI colonization devices with pinewood cubes and packed alfafa substrate 

(Cunha et al., 2013b; Laming et al., 2015b; Rodrigues et al., 2012).  

Lacaze-Duthiers (LD) canyon is located in the North West Mediterranean Sea (Figure 

6). This canyon belongs to the Gulf of Lions, where several submarine canyons incise the 

continental slope at depths superior to 1000 meters. At LD canyon, coral community holds 

a rich fauna of invertebrates, such as sponges, echinoderms, oysters, ascidians, 

brachiopods and bryozoans. Cephalopods and fishes also occur in LD canyon (Fiala-

Medioni et al., 2012). Mussels were recovered from an experimental deployment of palm 

trunk and pinewood substrate with CHEMOCOLI (Laming et al., 2015b). 

Amsterdam mud volcano (Ams) is situated in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea at the 

Anaximander Mountains, South of Turkey (Figure 6). The Anaximander Mountains are 

associated to high tectonic deformation and fluids release. Amsterdam MV is characterized 

by high methane concentrations and extensive turbid fluid expulsion (Charlou et al., 2003). 

Amsterdam mussel samples were collected from carbonate crusts (Laming et al., 2015b). 

The Nile Deep Sea Fan (NDSF) is a sedimentary edifice, located at Eastern 

Mediterranean Sea (Figure 6). NDSF comprise numerous sub-circular pockmarks (central 

zone) and several gas-emitting mud volcanoes, with high methane and salinity levels 

(Dupré et al., 2007, 2014; Foucher et al., 2009). The pockmarks host urchins, bivalves, 

tubeworms and crustaceans. At NDSF mud volcanoes, chemosynthetic and other deep-sea 



Chapter 3. Material and methods 

23 

fauna was observed, such as polychaetes, bivalves, shrimps, copepods, amphipods, 

Chaceon crab and fishes (Duperron et al., 2008; Dupré et al., 2007). Individuals DNA 

sequences used in this study were obtained from mussels found in different substrates: 

wood, carbonate and alfafa (CHEMOCOLI) (Laming et al., 2015b), authigenic carbonate 

crusts (Duperron et al., 2008; Lorion et al., 2012), tubes of the siboglinid tubeworms and 

wood chips (Lorion et al., 2012).

3.1.2. Hydrodynamic features 

 

The location of the GoC, between the Atlantic and the Mediterrenean, its morphology 

and also biogeochemical features lead to a peculiar hydrology in this area (Macias et al., 

2014; Villanueva and Gutiérrez-Mas, 1994). The exchange of water between the Atlantic 

and the Mediterranean take place at the Gibraltar Strait. The Mediterranean water has 

elevated levels of salinity, being denser than the Atlantic water. These differences in water 

salinity and temperature, favour the superficial inflow of Atlantic water and the deep outflow 

of Mediterranean water (Villanueva and Gutiérrez-Mas, 1994). The water that comes from 

the Mediterranean forms meddies on the Iberian slope and on the Gorringe Bank (Quentel 

et al., 2011; Serra and Ambar, 2002). 

The Mediterranean outflow water has three layers: the superficial, the central and the 

deeper. The superficial flow (500-600 m of depth), after passing by Cape San Vicente, takes 

direction to North, running along the Portugal continental margin. The central flow (700 and 

900 m of depth) departs from the continental margin towards the NNW. The deeper flow 

(1200 and 1500 m of depth) runs to the NW Atlantic, passing between Cape San Vicente 

and Gettysburg seamount (Villanueva and Gutiérrez-Mas, 1994).  



Chapter 3. Material and methods 

24 

The Gulf of Cadiz slope current and offshore flow are the two main inflows to 

Mediterranean Sea. The Gulf of Cadiz slope current (inshore flow) comes from Cape S. 

Vicente to Gibraltar Strait, while the offshore flow comes more southern (Peliz et al., 2009; 

Villanueva and Gutiérrez-Mas, 1994). 

 

3.2. Sampling collection 

 

Samples of small mussels were collected from wood blocks deployed at Darwin and 

Meknès mud-volcanoes (Gulf of Cadiz) within the scope of CHEMECO project. Additional 

mussel samples were obtained from a wood log opportunistically found near the Gettysburg 

seamount (Gorringe Bank) (Cunha et al., 2013b; Rodrigues et al., 2012). Sampling 

information is detailed in Table 2. On board, artificial substrates with attached macrofauna 

were preserved in 96% ethanol. Later, samples were sorted and mussel shells and tissue 

were separated and placed in new vials (new ethanol solution).

3.3. Molecular analyses 

 

DNA extraction was performed using three different extraction kits: DNeasy Blood &amp;amp; 

Tissues kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), QIAamp DNA Micro kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and 

ISOLATE II Genomic DNA kit (Bioline, Taunton, MA).  

Most of the extracted DNA was 1% diluted for amplification of the mitochondrial DNA 

Cytochrome Oxidase subunit I (mtCOI). PCR temperature profile was equal for all samples: 

94-4’ - [95-1’- 47-1’ - 72-1’] - 72-10’ (x35) (Rodrigues et al., 2012). The primers used were 

LCO-1560F (5'-ATRCTDATTCGWATTGA-3') and HCO-2148R (5'-

CCYCTAGGRTCATAAAAAGA-3') (Jones et al., 2006). Two different PCR protocols were 

used:  



Chapter 3. Material and methods 

25 

Protocol A - In a total volume of 20.0 ?L, 2.0 ?L of DNA template (1/100 dilution) and 
13.8 ?L MilliQ water, 0.5 ?L of 10 ?M both forward and reverse primers, 0.4 ?L of 10 mM 
dNTP mix (Bioline, UK), 2.0 ?L of 10x NH4 reaction buffer (Bioline, UK), 0.7 ?L of 50 mM 
MgCl2 solution (Bioline, UK), 0.1 ?L of 5 u/?L BIOTAQTM DNA polymerase (Bioline, UK);  

Protocol B - In a total volume of 20 ?L, 1.0 ?L of DNA template (not diluted), 14.7 ?L 
MilliQ water, 4.0 ?L of 5x MyTaqTM reaction Buffer (Bioline, UK), 0.1 ?L of 100 ?M both 
primers and 0.1 ?L of 5 u/?L MyTaqTM DNA polymerase (Bioline, UK). 

Most of the times, a nested PCR was carried out using the product of the first PCR as 

DNA template. Thermocyclers used were TProfessional basic or Biometra TRIO (Biometra, 

Analitik Jena). For more detailed information about molecular methods for each sample see 

Appendix I – Supplementary Table I.  

PCR products were visualized through gel electrophoresis, using the molecular ladder 

Hyperladder™ 50bp (Bioline, UK). Agarose gel was prepared with 0.8 g agarose, 80 mL 1x 

TAE buffer (Thermo Scientific) and 5 ?L Sybersafe (Thermofisher Scientific) or SyberGreen 
(NZYTech). Electrophoresis images were obtained using BIO-RAD Molecular Imager® 

ChemiDocTM XRS+. 

PCR products were purified with QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Valencia CA) 

and sent for bidirectional sequencing at the Macrogen laboratory (Amsterdam).   

 

3.4. GenBank sequences 

 

The accession number, reference and collection site of the sequences retrieved from 

GenBank are shown in Table 3. Sequences from additional mussel species were added as 

outgroups for the phylogenetic reconstruction, based on the more recent phylogeny of 

Bathymodiolins (Lorion et al., 2013). Sequences added were: ESU M (accession number: 

FJ937202.1), ESU J (FJ937190.1), ESU I (FJ937187.1), Idas washingtonia (AY275546.1), 

Idas macdonaldi (AY649804.1), Adipicola iwaotakii (EU702322.1), Adipicola longissima 

(FJ937059.1), Idas japonica (FJ937078.1), Benthomodiolus lignicola (AY275545.1) and 

Modiolus modiolus (U56848.1).

3.5. Data analyses 

 

A total of 93 sequences were analysed, corresponding to 15 sequences obtained in this 

study and 78 sequences acquired in GenBank (Benson et al., 2005).  

All 15 sequences obtained in this study were trimmed, paired and clipped using BioEdit 

Sequence Alignment Editor version 7.2.5 (Hall, 1999). Gaps were filled manually, as well 

as conservative sites to increase sequence length. The total length of all the sequences 

(obtained in this study and from the GenBank) obtained was 437bp. To ensure the correct 

translation of the sequence from nucleotide to protein, sequences were evaluated using 

EMBOSS online tool Transeq (Goujon et al., 2010; Rice et al., 2000) (available from 

www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/st/emboss_transeq). All sequences were aligned using ClustalW 

Multiple alignment with 1000 bootstraps (NJ tree) run in BioEdit software. After the 

alignment, smaller sequences were excluded (4), obtaining a total of 89 sequences (14 

sequences of this study and 75 sequences of GenBank). 

Best Fit Model was run in MEGA 6.0 (Tamura et al., 2013). Phylogenetic maximum 

likelihood (ML) tree was performed using MEGA 6.0 software, selecting 1000 bootstraps, 

Tamura and Nei (1993) nucleotide substitutions model (determined by Best Fit Model), 

gamma distribution for rate variation among polymorphic sites (5 discrete gamma 

categories), first and second codon positions and Nearest-Neighbour-Interchange (NNI) for 

inference options of ML heuristic method. 

DnaSP software v. 5.10.01 (Rozas, 2009) was used to calculate several genetic diversity 

indices: number of sequences; number of polymorphic/segregating sites (S); total number 

of mutations (Eta); number of haplotypes (h); haplotype diversity (Hd) with respective 

variation and standard deviation and nucleotide diversity (?). Tajima’s and Fu and Li tests 
were performed with DnaSP to validate data neutrality. 

Haplotype network was obtained with Network 4.6.1.4 (Fluxus Technology Ltd, 1999-

2016), using a median-joining method (Bandelt et al, 1999). ARLEQUIN software v. 3.5.2.2 

(Excoffier and Lischer, 2010) was used to assess genetic structure through AMOVA (k=1). 

Significance tests were calculated with 1023 permutations. Spatial Analysis of Molecular 

Variance (SAMOVA) is an AMOVA that correlates geographical and genetic distances 

among populations. This analysis was performed for different numbers of groups (k=2, 3, 4 

and 5) with SAMOVA 1.0 (Dupanloup et al., 2002). Pairwise genetic distances were 

calculated in ARLEQUIN and plotted against geographical distances showed in Table 1 

(Microsoft Excel 2016). Mantel test for matrix correlation between genetic (Fst) and 

geographic (km) distances was performed with 1000 permutations using the online Isolation

Chapter 4. RESULTS 

 

4.1. Sequencing success rate 

 

DNA was extracted from a total of 77 mussel individuals (Table 2), but it was only 

possible to amplify and sequence the mtCOI gene of 15 specimens (Appendix I). Less than 

half of the extracted samples were successfully amplified (43%), and the number of 

successful sequences obtained was then reduced to 42%, giving a final success rate of 

18% (excluding one partial sequence) (Figure 7).  

 

 
Figure 7 – Number of samples obtained after each laboratory step. 

 
Out of the 14 sequences obtained, 12 sequences belong to the species Idas 

modiolaeformis and two belong to “Idas” simpsoni. Overall, it was possible to sequence 

eight specimens of I. modiolaeformis from Gorringe Bank, three individuals from Meknès 

MV (one I. modiolaeformis and two “I.” simpsoni) and three individuals of I. modiolaeformis 

from Darwin MV (Table 4).

4.2. Phylogenetic reconstruction 

 

Overall, sequences from this study and from GenBank comprise 52 sequences of Idas 

modiolaeformis and 37 sequences of “Idas” simpsoni, from 7 locations in the North East 

Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea.  



Chapter 4. Results 

32 

The phylogenetic tree clearly reveals two main groups that separate each studied 

species into one of two different clades (Figure 8). Within each species, no segregation was 

observed for the different geographic locations.  

Tajima’s D test did not show statistical significance for each singular population and for 

all populations of Idas modiolaeformis (Table 5), meaning that these sequences follow a 

neutral evolution model. The Lacaze-Duthiers canyon (LD) population is not shown in Table 

5, because Tajima’s D test requires a minimum of 4 sequences to perform calculations.  

The Tajima’s D value obtained for “Idas” simpsoni showed statistical significance for 

Setúbal population and for all populations (Table 5), which means that mtCOI gene of this 

species is not in accordance with neutral evolution. The number of sequences from Meknès 

(N=2) and LD (N=3) was too low to perform Tajima’s D test. 

Fu and Li tests for neutrality were performed too, revealing the same results as Tajima’s 

D test (see in Appendix II – Supplementary Table II).

A summary of site-specific genetic diversity for each species is shown in Table 6. All 

sequences of Atlantic populations had the highest number of polymorphic sites, mutations 

and haplotypes. Excluding populations with low number of sequences (N&lt;5), haplotype 

diversity for both species is higher for Atlantic populations.  

The Idas modiolaeformis NDSF population was best represented, with 25 sequences. 

The remaining populations had less than 15 sequences. LD population for I. modiolaeformis 

had no polymorphic sites, corresponding to a single haplotype. Due to the low number of 

sequences (two) analysed, corresponding to two different haplotypes, Amsterdam MV had

the highest haplotype diversity, but this value is not meaningful. The second highest 

haplotype diversity value was found in Darwin MV, with seven sequences analysed. The 

NDSF population had the smallest haplotype diversity, with 25 sequences analysed. 

Meknès sequences had the highest nucleotide diversity, once the number of mutations per 

sequence was higher. NDSF sequences had the lowest nucleotide diversity. All 52 

sequences of I. modiolaeformis revealed 11 haplotypes, generated by 26 mutations. 

The most represented population of “I.” simpsoni was Setúbal canyon (32 sequences). 

The remaining populations had less than five sequences, preventing further statistical 

analysis. Setúbal canyon had the highest number of segregating sites and mutations. 

Meknès MV sequences only had one mutation. Haplotype diversity reached the maximum 

for Meknès and LD, but again these values are not meaningful because of a low number of  

sequences per population. Nevertheless, Setúbal canyon had a high haplotype diversity, 

with 32 sequences analysed. The nucleotide diversity was higher for LD sequences and 

smaller for Meknès sequences. From the total of 37 sequences of “I.” simpsoni, 18 

mutations (in 17 polymorphic sites) originated 16 haplotypes.

4.4. Population structure 

 

Idas modiolaeformis and “I.” simpsoni were clearly segregated by 71 mutations. Idas 

modiolaeformis sequences were distributed by 11 haplotypes (six from Atlantic, three from 

Mediterranean, two shared between the two regions), and “I.” simpsoni had 16 haplotypes 

(13 from Atlantic, two from Mediterranean, one shared) (Table 7 and Figure 9). 

Haplotype 1 was the most frequent haplotype within I. modiolaeformis species (N=28 – 

Table 7), shared by individuals from Atlantic (Gorringe and Darwin) and Mediterranean 

(NDSF and Amsterdam). Haplotype 2 gathered individuals from NDSF and Amsterdam 

populations that are both in the Mediterranean. Meknès and LD populations that are 

geographically separated by Gibraltar Strait shared Haplotype 7. Haplotypes 9, 10 and 11 

revealed higher divergences from the remaining haplotypes and were found only in Atlantic 

populations (Gorringe, Darwin and Meknès).

All populations of “Idas” simpsoni had one haplotype in common, Hap19 (n=17–Table 

7). Populations from Setúbal and LD canyons had two very close haplotypes, with only one 

mutation segregating them (Hap21 and Hap22 – Figure 9). 

In both species Meknès and LD populations shared one haplotype (Hap7 and Hap19, 

respectively in I. modiolaeformis e “I.” simpsoni).

A very great genetic differentiation (Fst=0.35&gt;0.25, p-value=0) was observed among all 

I. modiolaeformis populations in the Atlantic and Mediterranean, indicating that these 

populations are structured. Most of the variation (64.5%) is explained by differences within 

populations (Table 8).

According to SAMOVA results (Table 9), it was possible to consider two hypotheses for 

population structure partitioning, namely in 3 or 4 groups (k=3; k=4). In both scenarios, Fct 

values indicated great genetic differentiation (Fct&gt;0.25) among groups and the respective 

p-value had statistical significance. The three-group scenario aggregates 1) LD, Amsterdam 

and NDSF; 2) Darwin and 3) Gorringe and Meknès. Four-group scenario corresponds to 1) 

Amsterdam and NDSF; 2) Darwin; 3) Gorringe and 4) Meknès and LD.

Among I. modiolaeformis populations (Table 10), a significant p-value for the estimated 

pairwise genetic distance (Fst) was detected between all Atlantic populations (Gorringe and 

Darwin, Gorringe and Meknès, Darwin and Meknès), and also between Atlantic and some 

Mediterranean populations (Gorringe and LD, Darwin and LD, Darwin and NDSF, Meknès 

and NDSF), and finally between two populations in either side of Mediterranean (LD and

NDSF). Significant p-values indicate significant distances between two populations. All 

remaining pairs of populations showed no significant p-values, meaning that no significant 

genetic divergences were detect between them.

In order to find the best-fit genetic structure model for I. modiolaeformis populations, 

geographical distances (km) were plotted against genetic distances (pairwise Fst values) 

(Figure 10). Negative Fst values were excluded. Trendline R-square is very low, indicating 

that geographic and genetic distances are not correlated, as also confirmed by Mantel test 

(r&lt;0, p=0.45 and r&gt;0, p=0.55).

Chapter 5. DISCUSSION 

 

5.1. Sequencing success rate 

 

In this study, the success of molecular sequencing was very low (18%). Other studies 

revealed unsuccessful amplification of mitochondrial genes, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 

4 in mussels (Boschen et al., 2015; Faure et al., 2015) and mtCOI in crustaceans (Asmyhr 

and Cooper, 2012). The amplification success rate of Asmyhr and Cooper (2012) was  less 

than 20%, a lower value than the present study amplification rate (43%). 

One possible explanation for the low success rate is related to the preservation of 

specimens. Recommendations indicate any fixative to have larger volume (5x-10x) than the 

specimen volume (Geiger et al., 2007). Because the specimens were preserved still 

attached to the wood cubes (CHEMOCOLI samples) and wood log (Gorringe samples) the 

volume of ethanol should have been much higher than the one used. It is also possible that 

ethanol did not reach the tissue inside the shells. Concerning fixation of small mussels for 

molecular work, it is recommended to drill or break the shell, so that the ethanol reaches 

the tissue. In order to preserve the shell for taxonomic identifications and other envisioned 

approaches, shell drilling was not performed. Regarding the storage of the tissue it is 

advised to replace the ethanol solution in the first days, due to tissue dehydration (Geiger 

et al., 2007; Prendini et al., 2002). The shell and tissue of most samples were later (&gt; one 

year) separated and kept in 96% ethanol, with replacement of the solution, although some 

tissue dehydration could have happened during specimen dissection. 

 

5.2. Phylogenetic reconstruction 

 
The phylogenetic tree showed a clear separation of I. modiolaeformis and “I.” simpsoni, 

and no segregation of individuals within each species per geographic location. The tree 

branches had low support because only the mitochondrial gene was used, and a 

combination of this and more conservative genes (e.g. nuclear markers) is needed to 

resolve phylogenetic relationships (Hartl and Clark, 1997).  

Regarding neutral evolution of the mtCOI gene, results revealed neutrality for I. 

modiolaeformis, but not for “I.” simpsoni. Thus, divergence results for I. modiolaeformis can 

be interpreted as a balance of gene flow (when divergence is reduced) and genetic drift 

(when divergence is increased). In the case of “I.” simpsoni neutrality test was probably 

biased due to the low number of sequences per population (Mek: N=2; LD: N=3 – Table 7). 

Nevertheless, Setúbal population had a good representation (N=32) and still Tajima’s D test 



Chapter 5. Discussion 

42 

did not support neutrality for mtCOI gene, suggesting that this gene might be under 

selection. Therefore, gene flow and genetic drift cannot be considered the only factors 

responsible for the genetic differences, as natural selection has to be considered as well 

(Allendorf and Luikart, 2007; Hartl and Clark, 1997). For these reasons, genetic 

differentiation analyses (AMOVA, SAMOVA, Fst pairwise distances) were not performed for 

“I.” simpsoni. 

 

5.3. Site-specific genetic-diversity per species 

 
A great discrepancy of the number of sequences analyzed per population in each 

species was translated also in great differences in estimated genetic indices. A low number 

of individuals per site (&lt;10-20) can either underestimate or overestimate indices, thus all 

interpretations have to be made with caution. For instance, maximum haplotype diversity 

(Hd=1) was found when the number of sequences was low (2-3) and each one represented 

a different haplotype (e.g. Amsterdam population of I. modiolaeformis; Meknès and LD 

populations of “I.” simpsoni).  

Nevertheless, genetic diversity values reported in this study (Table 6) are within the 

range of observed values in other bathymodiolin species. The values of polymorphic sites 

(S) in I. modiolaeformis and “I.” simpsoni were 26 and 17, respectively. Faure et al. (2015) 

reported 21 polymorphic sites in Bathymodiolus brooksi, while in B. thermophilus varied 

between 8 and 27 (Plouviez et al., 2013). I found a haplotype diversity of 0.689 for I. 

modiolaeformis and 0.782 for “I.” simpsoni, fitting the values already observed in other 

deep-sea mussels. Haplotype diversity ranged between 0.292 (B. nov. sp. GoM) to 0.909 

(B. childressi) in Faure et al. (2015) study. 

Comparing Atlantic and Mediterranean populations for both species, Atlantic populations 

showed higher values of polymorphic sites, mutations and haplotypes indicating a higher 

genetic diversity. It is interesting to note that Darwin population for I. modiolaeformis, with 

only seven individuals, showed a high value of polymorphic sites (S=21) and haplotype 

diversity (Hd=0.714) compared to NDSF population that showed a lower number of 

polymorphic sites and genetic diversity (S=3; Hd=0.410) within 25 individuals sampled. 

Although sampling limitations can influence haplotype diversity, these results may suggest 

that NDSF population is more isolated. Overall, “I.” simpsoni exhibited 16 haplotypes out of 

37 individuals, while I. modiolaeformis with more individuals (52) showed only 11 

haplotypes. Numerous haplotypes further support the rejection of gene neutrality, 

suggesting that “I.” simpsoni population is under selection. 

 



Chapter 5. Discussion

5.4. Population structure 

 

Idas modiolaeformis and “I.” simpsoni are separated by 71 mutations, as shown in the 

haplotype network (Figure 9). The occurrence of one dominant haplotype for each species 

(Hap1 in I. modiolaeformis, and Hap19 in “I.” simpsoni) suggests ancestral polymorphisms 

shared between most sampled populations: Dar, Gor, Ams, NDSF for I. modiolaeformis, 

and Set, Mek, LD for “I.” simpsoni. High genetic differentiation (Fst=0.35, Table 8) among I. 

modiolaeformis populations across the entire geographic region provides evidence for 

segregation of populations. Differentiation within populations is responsible for 64.5% of the 

variation found, in accordance with the highly discrepant site-specific genetic diversity. 

Haplotype distribution provides evidence to explain two possible population-partitioning 

scenarios of Idas modiolaeformis. On one hand (scenario k=3), the Mediterranean 

populations (NDSF, Ams and LD) are separated from the Atlantic populations, which are 

split in two clusters: 1) Gor + Mek and 2) Dar. Darwin population holds two unique 

haplotypes (Hap3 and Hap8) in 5 out of 7 individuals and shares one more divergent 

haplotype (Hap10) with the other two Atlantic populations. On the other hand (scenario 

k=4), the two Eastern Mediterranean populations (NDSF and Ams) are segregated from a 

central group of two populations on both sides of the Gibraltar Strait (LD and Mek), and two 

other Atlantic populations, Darwin MV and Gorringe Bank. LD unique haplotype (Hap7) is 

only shared with Meknès, while Gorringe holds three unique haplotypes (Hap5, Hap9 and 

Hap11). 

Although the first partitioning scenario (k=3) suggested an apparent segregation 

between Atlantic and Mediterranean populations, the present data does not allow us to 

exclude the occurrence of gene flow across the Gibraltar Strait. Connectivity between 

Atlantic and Mediterranean populations has previously been studied. Affinito et al. (2015) 

showed high genetic connectivity and bidirectional migration of tunicates between Atlantic 

and Mediterranean. Correia et al. (2012) also showed genetic connectivity of conger ell 

between the two areas.  

Despite the shorter geographic distances (47-448 km) among Atlantic populations, these 

sites showed significant (p-value&lt;0.05) pairwise genetic distances (Fst: Dar-Gor=0.26, Dar-

Mek=0.35 and Mek-Gor=0.41) just slightly lower than populations that are separated by 

more than 1000 km (Fst: Dar-LD=0.51, Gor-LD=0.54 and LD-NDSF=0.66) or even farther 

away (&gt;3000 km, Fst: Dar-NDSF=0.42 and Mek-NDSF=0.57). The lowest (non-significant) 

pairwise genetic distances were found between populations of two very distant geographic 

sites (&gt;3300 m), suggesting that sufficient gene flow may be occurring between them. Gene 

flow between Dar-Ams (Fst=0.15&lt;0.20) is sufficient to avoid harmful effects of local 



Chapter 5. Discussion 

44 

inbreeding, whereas higher gene flow between Gor-NDSF (Fst=0.016&lt;0.020) is sufficient 

to maintain similar allele frequencies (Lowe and Allendorf, 2010).  

The lack of correlation (R2=0.024, p&gt;0.05) between geographic and genetic distances 

(Figure 10) provides evidence for an island model of population structure. The low genetic 

distances could result from the mixing of larvae by ocean currents and their transport over 

long distances, that may form one large and common gene pool contributing to gene input 

in smaller populations (Altukhov, 2006). A low genetic differentiation across large 

geographic regions was previously reported in mussel populations in the East and West 

Pacific hydrothermal vents (Breusing et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2013). Moreover, the 

connection between populations can also be guaranteed by multiple and patchy 

intermediate habitats that allow gene exchange between closer populations, linking 

populations that are farther apart (stepping-stone model) (Allendorf and Luikart, 2007; 

Breusing et al., 2015). 

Connectivity between Atlantic and Mediterranean mussel populations may be explained 

by their long-distance dispersal capabilities and ocean currents in this geographic region. 

Idas modiolaeformis larvae are likely planktotrophic and have an estimated pelagic duration 

of 4-5 months (Gaudron et al., 2012). Similar to other bathymodiolin mussels, it is likely that 

these larvae perform vertical migration, moving up hundreds of meters to use faster currents 

at the surface allowing them colonize distant habitats (Arellano et al., 2014). This dispersal 

strategy can explain the low genetic distances among geographical distant populations 

(Carney et al., 2006). Superficial inflow of Atlantic water at ~100 m depth (Villanueva and 

Gutiérrez-Mas, 1994) may transport larvae between regions in the Atlantic to the 

Mediterranean. However, larval transport may also occur in Mediterranean-Atlantic 

direction, through Mediterranean outflow water (Villanueva and Gutiérrez-Mas, 1994), 

considering that larvae would stay in deeper water layers (approx. 500-1500 m of depth). 

Other examples in literature support the idea that Atlantic populations may serve as larval 

sources to Mediterranean populations (Bouchet and Taviani, 1992). The higher genetic 

diversity found in the Atlantic mussel populations suggested that larval transport is more 

likely to occur from Atlantic to Mediterranean.  

Panmictic populations are generally assumed for long-distance dispersal larvae 

(Arellano and Young, 2009). However, the present data does not support the occurrence of 

panmixia across the entire geographic region. Yet, sampling gaps can influence the power 

of differentiation analyses. Our Fst values might be overestimated, due to the low number 

of sequences and a single gene marker (Vrijenhoek, 2010). Further investigations with 

increased number of sequences (individuals) and populations, and additional genetic data 



Chapter 5. Discussion 

45 

(e.g., nuclear SNPs and allozyme) are needed to confirm these results. This information will 

be crucial to understand source-sink dynamics that are useful to conservation management, 

particularly regarding the inter-MPA connectivity (Bell, 2008). The implementation of the 

Gorringe Bank MPA demands further connectivity studies in the Atlantic and Mediterranean 

region for its sustainable management. For instance, it is important to investigate whether 

deep-sea mussel populations from Atlantic and Mediterranean are connected by 

contemporary dispersal, or if historic connectivity has persisted to present day and 

populations did not have enough time to become isolated.

Chapter 6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH 

 
The low number of individuals per population as well the discrepant number of 

sequences among populations limited the interpretation of the results. Nevertheless, the 

present data indicated that “Idas” simpsoni and Idas modiolaeformis populations from 

Mediterranean and North East Atlantic are not geographically isolated. The two studied 

species showed one dominant haplotype suggesting shared ancestral polymorphisms 

between populations across entire geographic region. In the case of I. modiolaeformis, the 

overall high genetic differentiation indicates that metapopulation is structured, particularly 

through differences within populations. The low genetic distances found between Atlantic 

and East Mediterranean populations indicate gene flow over &gt;3000 km distance. Genetic 

and geographic distances are not correlated, supporting an island model of population 

structure. Additional samples and other genetic markers are needed to clarify the genetic 

structure of Idas metapopulations in the studied region. 

This study provided insights into gene exchange between deep-sea habitats in the 

Mediterranean, Gulf of Cadiz and the Gorringe Bank, which was recently established as a 

Marine Protected Area. Further studies are necessary to understand the recolonization 

potencial and source-sink dynamics among these areas (Boschen et al., 2015; Marshall et 

al., 2009), in order to comprehend resilience of populations to natural and human impacts, 

enabling a sustainable management of deep-sea ecosystems.  

In addition to genetic data, demographic studies (size of population, number of self-

recruits and migrants, mortality and birth rates) may allow to infer more realistic estimates 

of population structure. Considering connectivity of organisms with pelagic larvae stage, 

larval dispersal and hydrology play a relevant role. Studies about timing and location of 

larval release, larval behavior, mortality rate, PLD estimates and transport distances, are 

important to better understand dispersal process. Artificial markers (for example, 

fluorescent dyes) have been used to follow the movement of larvae, nevertheless dilution 

of larvae in natural environment is very high, making this method unfeasible (revewied in 

Levin, 2006). However, natural makers such stable isotope signatures of tissues and 

geochemical fingerprinting can also be informative about larval dispersal (Cowen and 

Sponaugle, 2009; Génio et al., 2015; Levin, 2006). Biophysical models incorporating 

hydrology, three-dimension reality and more realistic estimates of larval biology (behavior, 

mortality, PLD, etc) are another powerful method to obtain comprehensive information 

about larval dispersal at various spatial and temporal scales.  



Chapter 6. Conclusions and future research 

48 

Studying deep-sea ecology has financial and technical limitations, so is important gather 

as much information from the data already collected and share the information to the 

scientific community, not only through scientific publications but also in online databases. 

Thus, perspectives of several study areas help to provide more realistic approaches. In this 

scientific field, multidisciplinary cooperative work can result in quite significant discoveries.
