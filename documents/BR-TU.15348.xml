Abstract 

 

Skin is the largest organ of the human body, and it is involved in the preservation of homeostasis 

of the body fluids, temperature and protection against infectious agents. When skin is injured, 

a complex process of regeneration begins. To promote skin regeneration it may be coated with 

proper biomaterials that contribute for the restoration of skin structure and functions, by 

reducing the risk of infection, avoiding dehydration, pain and reducing the formation of scar. 

Herein, a new sponges (S) aimed to promote skin regeneration ware developed. The materials 

used of the production this sponge were: Chitosan and Gelatin. 

Sponges were coated with a membrane (M), the materials used were deacetylated Chitosan, 

Poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) and Poly (?-caprolactone) (PCL), mimicking the natural anatomy 

and physiology of skin. The coated sponge (CS) produced is biocompatible, biodegradable, anti-

inflammatory and antimicrobial porous structure that allow the difusion of nutrients and waste 

products. Furthermore, Ibuprofen was also loaded at sponges to improve the skin regenenation, 

by decreasing wound edema and decreased production of inflammatory mediators. 

The structure of the biomaterials developed here (S, M and CS) were initially characterized by 

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Ther morphology was characterized by scanning 

electron microscopy (SEM). Cellular adhesion and internalization into the porous structures of 

the biomaterials were visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The cytotoxicity 

profile of the biomaterials were characterized through 3-(4,5-Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-

2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays and the results obtained confirmed their biocompatibility. 

The antimicrobial activity of the sponges were also evaluated and the results showed that they 

were able to inhibit the growth, at the surface, of the most common microorganism in skin 

infection (Staphylococcus aureus). In conclusion, the produced porous sponges has suitable 

properties for improving the healing process of cutaneous wounds.

Resumo 

 

A pele é o maior órgão do corpo humano e este órgão está envolvido na preservação da 

homeostase dos fluidos corporais, manutenção da temperatura e protecção contra agentes 

infecciosos. Quando a estrutura da pele é comprometida inicia-se um complexo processo de 

regeneração. Para promover este processo a pele pode ser revestida com biomateriais com o 

objectivo de reduzir o risco de infecção, desidratação, dor e a formação de cicatriz. 

No presente estudo foram desenvolvidas novas esponjas (S) para a regeneração da pele. Os 

materiais utilizados na sua produção foram: O Quitosano e a Gelatina.  

Por outro lado as esponjas também foram revestidas com uma membrana (M), em que os 

materiais usados foram o Quitosano desacetilado, Óxido de polietileno (PEO) e policaprolactona 

(PCL), imitando a anatomia e fisiologia natural da pele. A esponja revestida (CS) é 

biocompatível, biodegradável, possi uma estrutura porosa com propriedades antimicrobianas, 

que permite a difusão de nutrientes e produtos residuais. Além disso, no interior do CS as 

células permacem viáveis e ocorre a proliferação. O Ibuprofeno foi também incorporado nas 

esponjas para acelarar a regeneração da pele, ao diminuir o edema da ferida por diminuição 

da produção de mediadores inflamatórios. 

A estrutura dos biomateriais produzidos, foram analisadas por espectroscopia de infravermelho 

com transformada de Fourier (FTIR). A morfologia da superfície e do interior das esponjas foi 

caracterizada por microscopia eletrónica de varrimento (SEM). A adesão celular e 

internalização das células nas estruturas porosas foram visualizadas através de imagens de 

microscopia confocal. Os perfis citotoxidos dos biomateriais foram caracterizados por meio de 

ensaios de viabilidade celular, e os resultados obtidos confirmaram a sua biocompatibilidade. 

A actividade antimicrobiana dos biomateriais foi também avaliada e os resultados mostraram 

que as esponjas inibem o crescimento na sua superfície, do microrganismo mais comum das 

infecções de pele (Staphylococcus aureus). As estruturas porosas têm propriedades adequadas 

para melhorar o processo de cicatrização de feridas cutâneas.

Resumo alargado 

 

A pele é o maior órgão do corpo humano, representando cerca de 7 % da massa corporal, 

chegando a atingir uma extensão de 2m2 num adulto. Este tecido tem como principal função 

servir de barreira protetora do organismo, protegendo contra infeções. Por outro lado, este 

orgão também preserva a hemóstase dos fluidos do corpo humano e ajuda na regulação da 

temperatura corporal. A pele é constituída por três diferentes camadas: Epiderme (camada 

externa), Derme (camada intermédia) e Hipoderme (camada interna). 

Diariamente a pele está sujeita a lesões, que podem ser causadas por queimaduras, cirurgias, 

traumas, contusões e hematomas. Estas lesões levam à disrupção do tecido quer a nível 

anatómico quer a nível funcional.  

Após ocorrer uma lesão de pele, inicia-se um processo de cicatrização que tem por objectivo 

restabelecer as propriedades e funções nativas da pele. Este processo é complexo e envolve 

fases que incluem: Hemostase, Inflamação, Migração celular, Proliferação e Maturação. Com o 

intuito de restabelecer o mais rapidamente possível a estrutura e função da pele têm sido 

usados auto-, alo- e xeno- enxertos. Até ao presente foram desenvolvidos um grande número 

de substitutos de pele. No entanto, estas abordagens terapêuticas apresentam algumas 

limitações tais como, a rejeição por parte do paciente, risco de transmissão de doenças e, 

ainda uma disponibilidade limitada. Devido a este facto tem-se procurado desenvolver novos 

substitutos de pele que permitam acelerar o processo de cicatrização. 

No presente estudo foi desenvolvido um novo substituto de pele, que consiste numa esponja 

revestida. A esponja foi produzida por um processo de congelação/descongelação. 

Posteriormente, esta foi revestida pelo método de electrospinning com uma membrana fibrosa, 

contendo um agente anti-inflamatório (Ibuprofeno). Os biomateriais escolhidos na produção da 

esponja revestida foram o Quitosano, Gelatina, PEO e PCL, que são conhecidos por possuírem 

as propriedades requeridas para serem aplicados na regeneração do tecido, como sejam, a 

biocompatibilidade, a actividade antimicrobiana, degradabilidade, e ainda uma porosidade que 

permite a internalização e a proliferação das células dentro da sua estrutura e ainda permitem 

a difusão de gases, nutrientes e produtos residuais. O Ibuprofeno foi ainda incorporado nas 

esponjas para reduzir a inflamação associada à lesão. 

A estrutura dos biomateriais produzidos, foram analisadas por espectroscopia de infravermelho 

com transformada de Fourier (FTIR). A morfologia da superfície e do interior das esponjas foi 

caracterizada por microscopia eletrónica de varrimento (SEM). A adesão celular e 

internalização das células nas estruturas porosas foram visualizadas através de imagens de 

microscopia confocal. Os perfis citotoxidos dos biomateriais foram caracterizados por meio de 

ensaios de viabilidade celular, e os resultados obtidos confirmaram a sua biocompatibilidade. 

A actividade antimicrobiana dos biomateriais foi também avaliada e os resultados mostraram 

que as esponjas inibem o crescimento na sua superfície, do microrganismo mais comum das

1. Introduction 

 

Skin is the largest organ of the human body and it plays highly specialized functions like at as 

a protective barrier against external insults that comprise ultraviolet light radiation (1), 

chemicals and microorganisms. Skin is also involved in fluid homeostasis maintenance, 

thermoregulation, immune surveillance, sensory detection and self-healing (2). 

Skin injuries have a high impact on the life quality of patients. Skin injuries are caused by burns, 

accidents, diseases, surgery, trauma and bruises. Due to the various functions of the skin, any 

loss of skin integrity may result in organism disorders and ultimately in a significant patient 

disability or even death (2, 3). Skin disruption often leads to an increase in fluid loss, infection, 

scarring, compromised immunity and change in body image (4). For a complete restoring of 

both skin structure and function, successful wound healing must occur. The healing process of 

adult skin is complex, requiring the collaborative efforts of cells as well as both extracellular 

and intracellular signals (5, 6). With the objective to solve the problems associated with re-

establishment of the native structure of skin and also the mechanisms responsible for healing, 

different wound dressings have been developed so for to protect the wound from bacterial 

infection, dehydration and allow wound exudate absorption (6). Nowadays, skin substitutes 

have a high demand for clinical uses. Actually, they represent approximately 50 % of Tissue 

Engineering (TE) and regenerative medicine market revenues.  

TE is emerging as an interdisciplinary field in biomedical engineering that integrates many 

concepts of science and engineering in order to design and develop biological substitutes that 

restore, maintain or improve organs functions and damaged tissues regeneration (2, 7). It has 

appeared as a solution to the a number of clinical problems that were not properly treated by 

the conventional therapeutics in which wound healing of chronic wounds is include (8). In a 

near future, TE purposes to produce a biodegradable wound dressing that promotes the re-

establishment of skin’s native structure (Epidermis, Dermis and skin appendages). Furthermore, 

these skin substitutes are expected to reduce costs and pain associated with wound healing 

(Lanza et al., 2007). 

 

1.1 Skin 

1.1.1 Functions and structure 

 

Skin provides an essential protective barrier against external environment avoiding pathogens 

invasion. Morever, this organ is also responsible for several hemostatic/sensory functions that 

are vital to health, namely the regulation of temperature and the hydration state for the human 

body (9-11). In detail, the skin functions are: 

 

? Hydratation: Avoids patient dehydration; 



 

3 
 

? Protection: Confers protection against harmful external agents (ultraviolet light, 

mechanical, chemical and thermal insults), and also disables microorganisms 

penetration; 

? Sensativity: Skin has various sensory receptors, that allow to monitoring of body 

temperature, touch, pressure, vibration and pain; 

? Metabolic: Subcutaneous adipose tissue constitutes a major energy reserve, mainly in 

the form of triglycerides. Epidermis is synthesizes vitamin D, which is responsible for 

the maintenance of calcium and phosphorus concentration in the blood; 

? Thermoregulation: Body temperature regulation, in which hair and pores are present 

at the surface of the skin. 

 

Skin is organized in three anatomical distinct layers known as Epidermis, Dermis and 

Hypodermis (Figure 1). Between Epidermis and Dermis is a Dermal–epidermal junction (DEJ) 

that provides mechanical support for the Epidermis and acts as a partial barrier against larger 

molecules (10). 

 

Figure 1: Structure of the human skin. Adapted from (12). 

 

In the three layers of skin there are skin appendages such as, nails, hair follicles, sweat and 

sebaceous glands, nerves, lymphatic and blood vessels (13, 14). 

 

1.1.1.1 Epidermis  



 

4 
 

 

Epidermis is the outermost layer of the skin, acting as a physical barrier against the external 

environment, preventing the water loss and infections (13). This layer is mainly constituted by 

keratinocytes (80 % of cellular elements), pigment-producing cells (melanocytes) and 

specialized dendritic Langerhans cells that have an essential role in the skin immune defense 

system (15, 16). 

The Epidermis comprises 4-5 sublayers (17): stratum basale (SB), spinosum (SS), granulosum 

(SG), lucidum (SL) and corneum (SC), as can be observed Figure 2. 

 

 

 

Figure 2: Representation of skin layered organization. Skin is composed of three layers: Epidermis, Dermis 

and Hypodermis. Epidermis is a stratified squamous epithelium that is divided into four layers, starting 

with the outermost layer: stratum corneum (SC), stratum granulosum (SG), stratum spinosum (SS), and 

stratum basale (SB). Adapted from (18). 

 



 

5 
 

The SB is comprised mostly by keratinocytes that are in constant division. They are responsible 

for the continuous self-renewel of Epidermis. The SS also contains keratinocytes that are 

involved in the process of growth and early keratin synthesis (13, 14). The SG is characterized 

by the presence of intracellular granules that are involved in the process of keratinization (19-

21). The SL represents 3–4 layers of dead and flat cells. This sub-layer is only found in the skin 

of palms and soles (13, 14). The final result of keratinocyte maturation is found in the SC (Figure 

2), which is formed by completely differentiated dead keratinocytes (corneocytes). The 

resulting structure provides the physical barrier and prevent water loss of the human skin (13, 

14, 22). 

The Epidermis is bound tightly to the underlying Dermis through the basement membrane at 

the DEJ. The basement membrane can be divided into lamina lucida (the layer closer to the 

Epidermis that is made of laminin, entactins and dystroglycans) and lamina densa (a sheet-like 

structure composed mainly by collagen type IV). The whole basement membrane is involved in 

the mechanical stabilization of the Epidermis (14, 23, 24). Moreover, the basement membrane 

determines the polarity of the Epidermis and provides a barrier against Epidermal migration, 

which prevents the direct contact of Epidermal cells with the Dermis (23, 24)  

 

1.1.1.2 Dermis 

 

Dermis lies below the Epidermis and constitutes the main part of the skin (13). Dermis is 

composed by a high number of fibroblast cells that produce collagen type I and III, elastin and 

glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). These proteins are the main constituents of the extracellular 

matrix (ECM) and are responsible for the support and elasticity of the skin (14). Additionally, 

Dermis confers support to the vascular and lymphatic vessels and nerve bundles (Figure 2) (17, 

25). 

Dermis is divided in papillary and reticular layers. The superficial papillary Dermis is composed 

by thin fibers that are loosely arranged and contains blood vessels that supply the Epidermis 

with nutrients, remove waste products and help in body temperature regulation. The deeper 

reticular Dermis accounts for 80 % of Dermis and is composed by dense collagen and elastic 

fiber matrix, conferring strength and flexibility to the skin (17, 24) 

 

1.1.1.3 Hypodermis 

 

The Hypodermis, located below the Dermis, is also known by subcutaneous tissue, is mainly 

composed by fat and connective tissue (15, 16). This layer is highly vascularized, providing 

blood vessels and nerves to the skin and also allowing its connection to the underlying bones 

and muscles. Furthermore, it also contribute for the thermoregulatory and mechanical 

properties of the skin (12, 16). 

 

1.1.1.4 Skin appendages 



 

6 
 

 

Skin has a variety of appendages, like, sweat and sebaceous glands, hairs folicules, nails and 

nerves. The sweat glands, secrete a watery fluid onto the skin surface, by the process of 

exocrine secretion. These glands play on important role in the thermoregulatory mechanism in 

humans (26). The main function of the sebaceous glands is to secrete sebum to moisturize the 

skin and hair and even the hair follicles, which are a source of proliferation of keratinocytes 

during epithelialization. Hair follicles also play an important role in the wound healing, once 

the Epidermal basal layer constitutes the outer cell layer of these structures and it has been 

shown that such basal cells, present in hair follicles, can move out and repopulate the Epidermis 

after healing. Nails confer protection to the distal phalanx and the fingertip (14). Moreover, 

skin contains a variety of nerve endings that sense heat and cold, touch, pressure, vibration 

and tissue injury. All cutaneous nerves have their cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia, and 

both myelinated and non-myelinated fibers are found. Free sensory nerve endings lie in the 

Dermis where they detect pain, itch and temperature. Specialised corpuscular receptors also 

lie in the Dermis allowing sensations of touch (perceived by Meissner’s corpuscles) pressure and 

vibration (by Pacinian corpuscles).  

 

1.2 Skin wounds 

 

Skin wounds affect millions of people worldwide, being one of the major issues of modern 

health care (5, 27). According to the Wound Healing Society (WHS), a skin wound can be 

described as a “disruption of normal anatomic structure and function” of skin, resulting from 

physical or thermal damage, medical procedures or physiological conditions (28). 

Skin wounds can be classified in acute or cronic: 

 

Acute wounds: 

Acute wounds are usually characterized by a complete healing, with a minimal scar 

formation. The primary causes of acute wounds include mechanical injuries due to external 

factors, such as abrasions and tears that are caused by frictional contact between the skin and 

hard surfaces. Other examples of mechanical injuries include penetrating wounds caused by 

knives, gun shots or surgical procedures. Burns and chemical injuries (caused by radiation, 

electricity, corrosive chemicals and thermal sources) are another category of acute wounds 

(28). Acute wounds heal through a normal, orderly, and timely reparative process that results 

in a sustained restoration of the anatomic and functional integrity of this organ (28, 29). 

 

Chronic wounds: 

Chronic wounds are characterized by their slow healing (28). These type of wounds are 

commonly affected by several factors, such as the absence of clot formation (which reduce the 

levels of active/vital growth factors in the wound environment) and bacterial colonization that 

triggers a high immune response for removing the debris, leading to healing time (30, 31). 



 

7 
 

Chronic wounds usually occur in individuals who have underlying comorbidities, including 

peripheral blood vascular disease, obesity, diabetes, chronic steroid use, or other chronic 

diseases that impair tissue healing (30, 32). These wounds involve a large surface area and have 

a high incidence in general population, featuring an enormous medical and economic impact 

(33). Pressure, venous insufficiency, diabetic foot ulcers and ischemic wounds are the most 

prevalent types of chronic wounds (28, 33). 

 

Additionally, skin wound can also be classified accordingly for the with the depth of injury and 

the number of layers affected: superficial, superficial partial-thickness, deep partial-thickness 

and full-thickness wound (28, 34): 

 

Superficial wound: 

Results from sunburns, light scalds and abrasions. In this type of wounds only the 

Epidermis is affected and they are characterized by erythema and minor pain. Such injuries do 

not require specific surgical treatment, since it regenerates without scaring occurs (34). 

 

Superficial partial-thickness wound:  

Affects Epidermis and superficial parts of the Dermis. Epidermal blistering and severe 

pain characterizes this type of injury, especially in the case of thermal trauma. The blood 

vessel, sweat glands and hair follicles are affected. The cells (keratinocytes) migrate towards 

each other from the basal layer to surround the wound. The healing occurs purely by 

epithelialization (28, 34). 

 

Deep partial-thickness wound:  

Injuries that involve great Dermal damage take long period to heal. Scaring is more 

pronounced for depth injuries, as well as the fibroplasia that is more intense, when compared 

with superficial partial-thickness wounds (5, 34, 35). 

 

Full-thickness wound:  

This type of wounds are characterized by a complete destruction of the skin 

appendages. The healing process involves contraction, and the epithelialization process occurs 

only from the edge of the wound. All full-thickness skin wounds are more than 1 cm in diameter 

and require skin grafting, as they cannot epithelialize on their own and may lead to extensive 

scarring, leading to limitations in joint mobility and severe cosmetic deformities for the patient 

(5, 34, 35). 

 

1.2.1 Skin burns 

 

Skin burns result from physical, chemical or thermal damages. The severity of the burn is 

determined by the patient condition (age and health) and it is usualy classified in degrees 



 

8 
 

depending on depth, position and size of the burned area (36, 37). Burns are usually divided in 

four degrees (Figure 3) (38, 39): 

 

 

Figure 3: Representation of the different degrees (first, second, third and fourth) of skin burn severity. 

Adapted from (40). 

 

First-degree (or superficial):  

Burns affect only the top layer of the skin and are the least severe burns. It involves 

pain and edema formation. The skin usually takes several days to restore its structure, however 

the formation of scar does not occur. The superficial burns are healed in a period of 2 weeks 

(34, 40). 

 

Second-degree (or partial-thickness):  

Involves the Epidermis and part of the underlying Dermis destruction. Blisters are 

characteristic of in this type of burns (34, 40). 

 

Third-degree (or full-thickness):  

Affect all layers of skin, including the nerves. In these type of burns, skin is restored 

from the periphery involving the formation of granulation tissue and also scarring. Usually, in 

this type of burn the necrotic tissue resulting from the burn must be removed (34, 40). 

 

Fourth-degree:  

Burns extend into the muscle below the skin, including fat tissue, tendons, muscles and 

bones (40).  

 

1.3 Wound healing 

 

After, a lesion, skin integrity and function must be restored. The main goals of healing is to 

achieve a rapid wound closure and a functional and aesthetic scar (41). Although, if skin 

regeneration does not occurs properly significant disability or even death may occur (2, 3). 



 

9 
 

Skin wound healing is a complex process with an orchestrated cascade of events (e.g. 

coagulation, inflammation, phagocytosis, chemotaxis, mitogenesis, epithelialization and ECM 

proteins production) (4, 42), where different cellular elements (e.g. platelets, neutrophils, 

macrophages, keratinocytes and fibroblasts) and soluble factors (e.g. cytokines and growth 

factors) are involved.  

Skin healing process can be divided into four overlapping phases: (i) haemostasis, (ii) 

inflammation, (iii) cell migration and proliferation and (iv) remodeling (43) as displayed in 

Figure 4. 

 
Figure 4: Representation of the phases of the wound healing. This process involves diferente types of cells 

and various phases. Phase I - Haemostasis which is characterized by coagulation and platelet activation; 

Phase II - Inflammatory phase where the cells of the immune system are recruited to injury site; Phase III 

- Proliferation phase occur the formation of ECM, granulation tissue and also angiogenesis; Phase IV - 

Remodeling, where the formation and maturation of the scar occurs. 

 

1.3.1 Phases of wound healing 

1.3.1.1 Haemostasis 

 

After a tissue injury, the disruption of blood vessels is responsible for the extravasation of blood 

constituents (5, 35, 44). Bleeding typically occurs when the skin is injured and it allows the 

removal of bacteria and/or antigens from the wound. In addition, bleeding triggers platelet 

aggregation, fibrin clot formation and activates the coagulation cascade in order to prevent 

ongoing fluid losses. Haemostasis is achieved initially by the formation of a platelet plug, 



 

10 
 

followed by the formation of a fibrin matrix that allows cells infiltration. The clot dries to form 

a scab and provides strength and support to the injured tissue (Figure 5) (28, 45). 

 

 

Figure 5: Representation of first phase of wound healing process: Haemostasis. The red balls represent 

the platelets releasing several factors, including platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming 

growth factor ? (TGF-?). 

 

The cytoplasm of platelets contains ?-granules filled with growth factors and cytokines, such 

as PDGF, TGF-?, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin-like growth factors. They also 

contain dense bodies that store vasoactive amines, like serotonin, which increase the 

microvascular permeability (35). There is an invasion of inflammatory cells such as leukocytes, 

macrophages and neutrophils of the wound site. These cells and platelets release cytokines and 

growth factors in order to activate the inflammatory process (35). 

 

1.3.1.2 Inflammation 

 

The inflammatory phase begins almost simultaneously with haemostasis, sometimes from within 

a few minutes of injury to 24 hours, and lasts for about 3 days. This phase can be divided into 

two stages (early and late inflammatory phases) depending either on the time and duration of 

the response and the type of inflammatory cells involved (35). 

 



 

11 
 

 

Figure 6: Representation of early inflammatory phase. The red balls represent the platelets that release 

several factors, including PDGF and TGF-?, which attract PMNs to the wound, signalling the beginning of 

inflammation. The blue traces represents fibrin. 

 

In the early inflammatory phase the activation of coagulation and complement system leads to 

the release of chemoattractants that recruit neutrophils into the wound site (Figure 6) (46). 

Then, the degranulation of platelets occurs. Moreover, once at the wound site, neutrophils 

perform their function of killing and phagocyte bacteria and damaged matrix proteins within 

the wound bed. The role that neutrophils play is crucial within the first days after injury, due 

to their ability to perform phagocytosis and also secrete proteases, that are involved in killing 

bacteria and also on degrade the necrotic tissue (42). 

 

 

Figure 7: Representation of late inflammatory phase. The yellow clots represents the aggregate of 

macrophages with the PMNs, which are responsible for removing the debris from the wound, release 

growth factors and begin to reorganize the ECM. The red balls represent the platelets releasing several 

factors, including PDGF and TGF-? and traces of fibrin. 

 

After 2-3 days in the late inflammatory phase, monocytes appear in the wound area and 

differentiate into macrophages (5). These macrophages are the most essential inflammatory 

cells involved in the normal healing response, as can be observed in Figure 7. Once activated 



 

12 
 

they perform phagocytosis of pathogens and of cell debris as well as the secretion of 

chemokines, inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor (TNF-?) that 

stimulate the re-epithelialization) and growth factors such as: EGF (that stimulates the re-

epithelialization), TGF-?, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), PDGF (which promote cell 

proliferation and the synthesis of ECM molecules by resident skin cells) and vascular endothelial 

growth factor (VEGF) (that stimulates the angiogenesis and granulation) (5). Macrophages act 

as phagocytic cells and secrete growth factors that are responsible for the proliferation of 

endothelial and smooth muscle cells and also for the production of ECM components by 

fibroblasts. They also involved in the release of enzymes that help to debride the wound (42). 

The presence of macrophages at the wound site is a marker that the inflammatory phase is 

finishing and the proliferative phase is beginning. 

 

1.3.1.3 Cell migration and proliferation 

 

The migration phase is the final stage of visible wound healing process (Figure 8). This phase 

involves the migration of keratinocytes, fibroblasts and endothelial cells to the wound site in 

order to replace the damaged tissue (47). In this phase, the wound is filled with granulation 

tissue. The endothelial cells of the adjacent venules initiate the angiogenesis process. These 

cells also synthesize remodelling enzymes that perform the breakdown of the ECM and thus 

create defects into which new capillary vessels will form a network and restore the vasculature 

(5, 28, 35, 39, 44). 

The proliferative phase starts three days after injury and lasts for about 2 weeks (35, 47). It is 

characterized by fibroblasts cells migration and by the deposition of newly synthesized ECM 

and formation of granulation tissue (35, 48). With progression of the proliferative phase, the 

provisional fibrin/fibronectin matrix is replaced by the newly formed granulation tissue (48). 

Epithelialization of the wound represents the final stage of the proliferative phase (35). 

 

 

Figure 8: Representation of migration and proliferation phase. The proliferation phase begins when 

fibroblasts are recruited to the wound site through the release of growth factors by inflammatory cells. 

Then fibroblasts start the synthesis of collagen. 



 

13 
 

 

Migration of fibroblasts:  

Fibroblasts appear at the wound site after 2–4 days and endothelial cells come about 

one day later (5). Following injury, fibroblasts are attracted to the wound by a several growth 

factors, including PDGF and TGF- ?. After that, fibroblasts proliferate and produce the matrix 

proteins: fibronectin, hyaluronan, collagen and proteoglycans. These components are involved 

in the production of a new ECM, which supports the migration and proliferation of cells (35, 

47). 

 

Production of the new ECM:  

The ECM is composed by a network of structural proteins (collagens and elastin) and by 

an interstitial matrix composed by the adhesive glycoproteins (fibronectin, laminin and 

thrombospodin) embedded in a proteoglycan and GAGs (5, 49). In wound healing, PDGF, FGF, 

TGF-?, interleukin-1 (IL-1), TNF induce collagen synthesis during the proliferative and 

remodeling phases (35, 50). 

 

Formation of the granulation tissue:  

After 3–5 days, the development of the granulation tissue occurs, which is characterized 

by a high density of fibroblasts, granulocytes, macrophages, capillaries and loosely organized  

collagen bundles (5, 35). Angiogenesis and neovascularization are also processes that occur in 

to this phase. (5, 35, 42, 49).  

 

Epithelialization:  

Within a few hours often skin injury, a single layer of Epidermal cells migrate, from the 

wound edges, to form a covering over the damaged area. Along this process, a new basement 

membrane is produced and, thereafter, the growth and differentiation of epithelial cells allows 

the re-establishment of the stratified epithelium. At the end of this phase the myofibroblasts 

are responsible for wound contraction, bringing the edges together. The appearance of 

myofibroblasts corresponds to the initiation of connective-tissue compaction and the 

contraction of wound (5, 35). 

 

1.3.4 Remodelling (maturation) 

 

Remodelling is the last phase (Figure 9) of the wound healing and occurs from day 21 to up to 

1 year after injury. At this stage, the majority of endothelial cells, macrophages and 

myofibroblasts undergo apoptosis or exit from the wound, leaving a mass that contains few 

cells and consists mainly of collagen and other ECM proteins (5). 

 



 

14 
 

 

Figure 9: Representation of the remodeling phase. The green represents collagen and the purple 

fibroblasts. 

 

This stage involves the formation of cellular connective tissue and strengthening of the new 

epithelium. There is a continuous synthesis and breakdown of collagen as well as the remodeling 

of ECM. Such determines the nature of the final scar (Enoch and Leaper, 2008). Most of the 

endothelial cells, macrophages and myofibroblasts undergo apoptosis or exit from the wound, 

leaving a mass that contains few cells and mostly collagen and other ECM proteins (42).  

Probably, the interactions between the epithelial mesenchymal cells will remain to support the 

skin integrity and homeostasis. In addition, over 6–12 months, the collagen type III that was 

produced in the proliferative phase is now replaced by collagen type I. This process is performed 

by matrix metalloproteinases secreted by fibroblasts, macrophages and endothelial cells (5). 

Finally, the angiogenic response decreases, the wound blood flow decreases and the acute 

wound metabolic activity slow down and stop. Subepidermal appendages such as hair follicles 

or sweat glands are not re-established after a serious injury (5, 42, 51). 

 

1.3.2 Types of wound healing 

 

In each healing process there are several mechanisms involved. The severity of the wound, 

number of skin layers affected and the occurrence or absence of bacterial infection allows us 

to classify the wound healing in different categories (5, 35): 

 

Primary healing:  

Occurs when a wound, created by laceration or surgical incision, causes only focal 

disruption of the continuity of the epithelial basement membrane and death of some cells of 

the underlying connective tissue. The wound is closed within 12-24 hours of its occurrence; In 

this type of healing, epithelial regeneration predominates over fibrosis (35, 44). 

 

Delayed primary healing:  



 

15 
 

Occurs in a contaminated or poorly delineated wound. The closure is performed after 

the host defenses have helped to debride. After 3-4 days, phagocytic and inflammatory cells 

are recruited to the wound site to remove the contaminating bacteria. Collagen metabolism is 

usually unaffected and the wound retains its tensile strength (35, 44). 

 

Secondary healing:  

Occurs when the wound edges cannot be approximated, due to the extensive loss of 

soft tissue, caused by a major trauma like severe burns and some surgical procedures. This type 

of wound healing is common in patients with underlying co-morbidities such as vascular, 

diabetic and pressure ulcers. The wound is left open and thus more susceptible to infections. 

The epithelial cells are not capable to restore the skin original architecture, so there is ingrowth 

of granulation tissue from the wound margins, followed by accumulation of ECM with the laying 

down of collagen. Myofibroblasts, which have structural properties similar to that of fibroblast 

and smooth muscle cells, are thought to play a crucial role in the healing of this type of injuries. 

The secondary healing is slower and may lead to functional defects (35, 44). 

 

Superficial healing:  

It is observed in injuries such as superficial burns, split-thickness donor graft sites, and 

abrasions where the injury involves the epithelium and the superficial (papillary) part of the 

dermis. The basal layer of cells remains uninjured and the epithelial cells within the Dermal 

appendages, hair follicles, and sebaceous glands replicate to cover the exposed Dermis; the 

cells migrate towards each other from the basal layer to surround the wound. Healing occurs 

purely by epithelialization (35). 

 

1.4 Tissue engineering 

 

TE is a field that applies the principles of biology, engineering and medicine in order to develop 

the biological substitutes that restore, maintain or improve damaged tissues or organs functions 

(2). It appeared as a solution for a number of clinical problems that were not properly treated 

with the use of permanent replacement devices (8).  

The underlying concept of TE is to isolate cells from a patient and then produced to their 

expansion and incorporation in a 3D matrix. The resulting TE construct is then grafted back into 

the same patient to function as a replacement tissue. In this approach, a highly porous artificial 

ECM, or scaffold, is required to accommodate mammalian cells and guide their growth in three 

dimensions. 

Major advances in materials science and engineering have contributed for the continuous 

development of TE and regenerative medicine (7, 52, 53). Nowadays, the tissue engennering is 

a discipline already applied in a significant number of medical procedures for skin (54), liver 

(55), pancreas (56), intestines (57), esophagus (58), nerves (59), cartilage (60), bone (61), and 

tendon (62) replacement. 



 

16 
 

 

1.4.1 Tissue engineering applied to wound healing 

 

Autografts, allografts and xenografts are the most used therapeutic approachs for skin 

regeneration. Autografts are obtained from the patient and present a higher healing success 

rate. However, they have a limited supply and its obtention is associated to morbidity in the 

donor site (63, 64). Allograft skin is harvested from organisms of the same specie. The use of 

allograft skin is limited since there is a great risk of disease transmission, eventual immune 

rejection and other limitatiors associated with its storage (65). The demand for tissues and 

organs seriously exceeds the supply, creating a substantial waiting list. Moreover, the immune 

system tends to reject the foreign tissue or organ (14). Xenograft skin is harvested from a 

different species and the majority of xenograft tissues are rejected by the immune response of 

the host, that may be caused upon the implantation process, thus leading to a high failure rate 

(66-68). 

In order to overcome the drawbacks associated with the use autografts, allografts and 

xenografts, different studies have been performed in the area of TE to developed new skin 

substitutes that can contribute to reduce the mortality and morbidity caused by scarring, 

changes in pigmentation, reduce the number of surgical procedures and hospitalization period 

(69).  

In the development of materials aimed to produce new skin substitutes it is necessary to take 

into account three major requirements: the safety of the patient, the clinical efficacy and the 

convenience of handling and application. Nowadays, skin substitutes are highly porous and some 

of them can accommodate skin cells and guide their growth in three dimensions (70). 

 

1.4.1.1 Comercial available skin substitutes  

 

Different skin substitutes are already applied in the clinic. Skin substitutes are a heterogeneous 

group of wound coverage materials that aid in wound closure and help in the reestablishment 

of the functions of the skin (28, 71, 72). Most of the bioengineered skin devices currently 

available consist on a combination of sheets of biomaterial matrix (e.g. collagen, hyaluronic 

acid) containing cultured cells (73-75). Several types of temporary dressings have been designed 

to provide a bacterial barrier to decrease pain and contribute to an adequate environment for 

epithelial regeneration.  

Wound dressings have been widely used due to their relative low cost, ease use, and 

effectiveness to clean and protect the wound from the external environment. They act as 

physical barriers that protect the wound from microorganism invasion and promote moisture 

environment and allow gases exchanges. 

The commercial bioengineered skin equivalent products are classified accordingly to the 

following parameters (2, 74-76):  

 



 

17 
 

A. Type of the biomaterial used for their production:  

a. Biological – e.g. Epicel; 

b. Synthetic – e.g. MySkin. 

 

B. Composition regarding the cellular components:  

a. Cellular – e.g. Dermagraft; 

b. Acellular – e.g. Integra Dermal regeneration. 

 

C. Duration: 

a. Temporary – e.g. Dermagraft; 

b. Semi-permanent – e.g. Integra Dermal regeneration; 

c. Permanent – e.g. Epicel. 

 

D. Layer of skin that skin substitutes are able to replace: 

Epidermal substitutes - keratinocytes are isolated from a donor and then are cultured 

in vitro in order to obtain the necessary number of keratinocytes for therapeutic 

purposes. Several Epidermal skin substitutes are already commercially available: 

 

a) Epicel ™: is a permanent substitute, which is composed by the in vitro culture 

of autologous keratinocytes (confluent cellular sheets) (34, 77). 

 

b) EpiDex ™: in vitro cultured autologous keratinocytes collected from hair bulbs 

(confluent cellular sheets). It is a permanent substitute (17, 77). 

 

c) MySkin ™: in vitro cultured autologous keratinocytes (subconfluent cellular 

sheets) which are grown on a silicone support layer with a specially formulated 

surface coating (34, 77). 

 

Dermal substitutes - Dermal substitutes are usually acellular, based on allogeneic, 

xenogeneic or synthetic materials (78). Dermal skin replacements present advantages, 

such as reduced costs, easier manufacture and rigorous quality control. They also add 

mechanical stability and prevent the wound from contracting (2, 34). However, they 

can be rejected by the host and be involved in diseases transmission (15). The Dermal 

substitutes available in include: 

 

a) Dermagraft ™: is composed of polyglactin mesh seeded with living cultured 

neonatal fibroblasts. It is a temporary substitute (79). 

 



 

18 
 

b) Alloderm is a freeze-dried human acellular dermal matrix. This type of matrix 

is ready to be incorporated into the wound, and it does not any immunogenic 

response from the host due to absence of a cellular component (80); 

 

c) Integra®: is composed by two layers: a porous layer of the skin made of bovine 

collagen type I and shark chondroitin-6-sulphate GAG that is bonded to a 

silicone pseudo-epidermis Integra®. It is indicated for the treatment of full 

thickness or deep partial thickness burns (17, 81). 

 

Dermo-epidermal substitutes - These substitutes mimic the Epidermal and Dermal 

layers. These substitutes are more advanced than the Epidermal and Dermal ones, 

although they are the most expensive (82).  

 

a) Apligraf ™: is composed by viable allogeneic neonatal fibroblasts grown in a 

bovine collagen type I gel matrix, combined with  viable allogeneic neonatal 

keratinocytes. It supplies ECM components to the wound, as well as cytokines 

and growth factors (77, 81). 

 

b) PermaDerm ™: is composed by an Allogenic matrix with bovine collagen. It is a 

permanent substitute (77). 

 

c) OrCell ™: is a TE skin construct that includes cultured allogenic fibroblasts and 

keratinocytes from the same neonatal foreskin. Fibroblasts are seeded into a 

bovine type I collagen sponge (77).  

 

1.5 Polymeric sponges for skin regeneration 

 

Despite the existence of various skin substitutes, none of them is capable of completely 

replicate the anatomy, physiology, biological stability or aesthetic nature of native skin (15).  

In addition, they are expensive, require frequent replacement, making the patient susceptible 

to subsequent secondary bacterial infections. Having this knowledge in mind, there is a huge 

demand for developing alternative strategies for treating burns or other skin lesions. 

Researchers from the area of TE have develop new Dermis and Epidermis substitutes using 

natural or synthetic matrices (83), in order to promote a more rapid and improved healing as 

well as a reduced scarring (2). 

Based on the properties that skin substitutes must have, porous scaffolds emerged as a 

promising alternative to be used as skin substitutes.  

Sponges are three-dimensional (3D) matrices that act as temporary templates for cell adhesion 

and proliferation, while providing mechanical support, until the new skin tissue is formed at 



 

19 
 

the affected area. Polymeric sponges are potential scaffolds for skin regeneration since they 

satisfy several requirements (84, 85): 

a) Protect the wound from fluid and proteins loss; 

b) Easy to handle and apply at the wound site; 

c) Present controlled degradation; 

d) Enable exudates absorption; 

e) Minimize scar formation; 

f) Large surface area that enables cell adhesion, growth and differenciation; 

g) Great porosity that allows cell infiltration, diffusion of nutirents and gases exchange; 

h) A surface can be easily modified (e.g. with the use of coatings); 

i) Can be produced using various techniques; 

j) Biocompatible: ability of a biomaterial to perform its desired function, without eliciting 

any undesirable local or systemic effects in the recipient or beneficiary of that therapy 

(10); 

k) Biodegradable: The by-products of their degradation must be non-toxic and able to exit 

from the body without interference with other organs. In order to allow degradation at 

a rate compatible with tissue formation, an inflammatory response combined with 

controlled infusion of cells such as macrophages is required; 

l) Active biomoluces (e.g. growth factors, cell-surface interactive peptides, drugs) can 

be easily incorporated to the sponge matrix that will facilitate skin regeneration, to 

stimulate cellular attachment, migration and proliferation. 

Based on these properties the development of sponges for skin regeneration may have a huge 

potential for skin healing. 

 

1.5.1 Methods and techniques used for sponge production 

 

Differents methods have been used for the development of sponges for TE, including the 

supercritical fluid technology, porogen leaching, freeze drying, scaffold templating (see Table 

1, for further details). 

 

Supercritical fluid technology: 

In this process, high pressures are used to dissolve the polymeric solution with or 

without a porogen. When a supercritical fluid such as carbon dioxide is used as a nonsolvent, 

the simple tuning of the processing conditions (pressure and temperature) can tailor the final 

structure of the sponges. Also, any subsequent drying step is avoided, as the obtained porous 

structure is a dry product free of any residual solvent (86, 87).  

 

Porogen leaching: 



 

20 
 

Porogen leaching allows the control of pore size and porosity of sponges, allowing the 

obtention of scaffolds with a more homogeneous pore morphology (86). Porous structures from 

polymers such as PCL has been produced using this method (88). 

 

Freeze drying: 

The method is based on the formation of ice crystals that induce porosity through ice 

sublimation and desorption. The kinetics of the freezing stage controls the porosity and the 

interconnectivity of the foams (89). 3D structures with values of porosity up to 200 % (86) with 

different interconnectivities are commonly obtained by freeze-drying. The main difficulty 

associated with this process is to ensure structural stability and adequate mechanical properties 

of the porous constructs after subsequent hydration. This limitation hinders its use when the 

application involves conditions with mechanical stress, even at low-to-moderate levels. 

 

Scaffold templating techniques: 

Polymeric solutions may be injected into moulds to fabricate scaffolds with various 

shapes and sizes. Also, the mould template can be design to fabricate a macroporous scaffold 

(86).

1.5.2 Coating of sponges 

 

Electrospinning has been recognized as the simplest technique to produce continuous 

nanofibers from diverse materials, including polymers (90).  

Electrospinning is a process that comprise the application of a needle attached to a syringe 

filled with polymer solution, a grounded collector plate and a high voltage power supply 

connected between the capillary and the collector. The feeding rate of the polymer solution is 

usually controlled using a syringe pump. A charged polymer solution flowing out of the needle 

is accelerated towards the grounded collector by a strong electrostatic field (91, 92). This field 

causes the droplet to emerge from the needle to undergo deformation into a conical shape, 

known as the “Taylor cone”. When a critical value is attained (the repulsive electrostatic force 

overcomes the surface tension) a fine jet of the solution emerges from the Taylor cone. The 

jet undergoes twisting instability and a characteristic whipping motion due to the charge-

charge repulsion that occurs between the excess charges presented in the jet (Figure 10), and 

during this phase, the jet is drawn by at least two orders of magnitude, the solvent evaporates, 

and the dry fibers deposit onto the collector (91, 92). 

The properties of the nanofiber mesh depending on fiber diameter, porosity characteristics of 

the solution and electrospinning equipment processing parameters. The smaller size of the 

individual fibers, the higher the surface area to volume ratios, which leads to an increase cell 

proliferation (93). The size, shape, individual fibers, the porosity of the web of fibers obtained 

and chemical compositions can be easily manipulated (94).

In biomedical applications the ultrafine fibrous scaffolds produced by electrospinning have been 

demonstrated to have suitable properties to promote the adhesion, proliferation and 

differentiation of several types of cells (94). 

Moreover, electrospun fibers can be used to coat scaffolds aimed for tissue regeneration, 

namely skin regeneration. Several electrospun nanofibrous membranes a contribution of 

natural/synthetic materials have been already tested for skin regeneration, produced with 

natural materials or polymers. Electrospun nanofibers reproduce the native topographical 

features of the natural ECM, promoting the cell’s natural functions (95, 96). 

Most of the work performed in this field uses biodegradable synthetic polymers (such as PCL) 

to produce non-woven membranes for various TE or drug delivery applications (97). 

Currently, a variety of natural polymeric-based membranes obtained from Chitin (98), Chitosan 

(99, 100), Alginate (100), Cellulose (101, 102), Hyaluronic acid (103), Gelatin (104, 105), 

Collagen (106) and their derivatives have been developed in order to satisfy the hight demand 

for new materials for the treatment of different wounds. These types of membranes may be 

composed of dense top layer and underlying porous sponge-like layer. The external layer 

protects the wound and serves as an artificial Epidermis, while the inner layer is designed for 

the drainage of wound exudates and attachment of wound tissues (107, 108). 

 

1.5.3 Biomaterials used for sponges production 

 

The first issue with regard to the development of a scaffold for skin TE is the choice of suitable 

material. Natural polymers can mimic many features of ECM and thus can guide the migration, 

growth and organization of cells during the wound healing process (109, 110).  

These natural polymers include polysaccharides, like Chitosan or proteins-based polymers 

(Collagen, Fibrin gels, Silk, and Gelatin). Despite their low mechanical strength, these natural 



 

23 
 

polymers have high hydrophilicity, low immune reaction and promote cell adhesion and 

proliferation (111).  

 

1.5.3.1 Chitosan 

 

Chitosan is a cationic polysaccharide composed of copolymers of ? (1?4)-glucosamine and N-

acetyl-D-glucosamine (Figure 11). It presents important characteristics for biomedical 

applications, such as, biocompatibility, biodegradability, hydrophilicity, hemostatic activity, 

nonantigenicity, anti-microbial activity and promote wound healing (108, 112). In addition, 

Chitosan is very abundant, has a low production cost and is environmental friendly. 

Chitosan has been applied in the area of TE for a wide variety of applications, like skin 

regeneration. It induces a faster wound healing and produce smoother scarring possibly due to 

an enhanced vascularization (113).  

Another important property of Chitosan is its antibacterial activity for different strains, such 

as Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonellas Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia 

coli (84, 114, 115). Due to this bactericidal activity Chitosan has been blended with other 

polymers (71, 116). Its antimicrobial activity may result from the electrostatic interactions 

between the positively charged Chitosan with negatively charged molecules at the cell surface, 

which affects cell permeability (71). This electrostatic attraction promotes cells’ adhesion, 

proliferation and differentiation (116, 117). 

Different studies reported the use of Chitosan for the production of skin substitutes, due to its 

properties that stimulate haemostasis and fibroblast to synthetize collagen, improving the 

tissue regeneration (118, 119). In vivo, this polymer stimulates the adhesion of fibroblasts, 

promoting keratinocytes proliferation and modulate the migration of neutrophils and 

macrophages, which in turn, modifies the repairing processes such as fibroplasias and 

reepithelialisation (66, 71).

Figure 11: Chemical structure of Chitosan. Adapted from (120, 121). 

 

The deacetylation degree (DD) of commercial available Chitosan is usually between 70 % and 

95 %. The different DD are defined in terms of the percentage of primary amino groups in the 

polymeric matrix (122). Chitosan with higher DD presents a greater number of free amino groups 

(71). Chitosan is degraded in vivo, through enzymatic hydrolysis. Lysozyme is the primary 

enzyme responsible for the in vivo degradation of Chitosan. 

 

1.5.3.2 Gelatin 

 

Gelatin is produced by partial hydrolysis of collagen extracted from the boiled bones, 

connective tissues, organs and some intestines of animals. Gelatin is colorless, brittle (when 

dry) and a flavorless solid substance. It is commonly used as a gelling agent in food and 

pharmaceuticals. Gelatin is biodegradable, biocompatible and has low antigenicity (122). 

Although, it obtained from collagen, it still retains some its properties, such as tripeptide Arg-

Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence, that promote cell adhesion, differentiation and proliferation (123). 

Furthermor it also has a low cost and low immunogenicity. It is soluble at physiological pH and 

at 40 °C. The large number of amino, carboxyl and hydroxyl groups, allows Gelatin chemical 

modification, increasing its versatility (Figure 12). Gelatin has been investigated for the 

production of matrices for skin regeneration (sponge or film) that can promote the 

epithelialization and granulation tissue formation (124).

1.5.3.3 Poly (ethylene oxide) 

 

PEO is a unique class of water-soluble biodegradable biopolymer (Figure 13). Due to its 

excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability and potential to be used in biomedical applications 

has attracted a great attention from both the industrial and scientific areas (113, 126). PEO is 

also used to reduce the viscosity of Chitosan solution, so that the solution is extruded at high 

polymer concentrations. 

 

 

Figure 13: Structure chemical of PEO. 

 

1.5.3.4 Poly (?-caprolactone) 

 

PCL (Figure 14) is a polyester that exhibits good mechanical properties. It a semi-crystalline 

material. However, due to its hydrophobic character, contains very few cell recognition sites 

and has a slow degradation rate. This polymer is used for various biomedical applications such 

as sutures, drug delivery systems and scaffolds in TE, due to its soft- and hard-tissue compatible 

properties (72).

1.5.4. Incorporation of anti-inflammatory drugs in sponges for skin 

regeneration 

 

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most commonly used drugs to treat 

inflammatory diseases, since they are effective in the management of pain, fever, redness, 

edema that occur as a consequence of inflammatory mediator release (127, 128). Different 

studies have shown that both therapeutic and side effects of NSAIDs are dependent of 

cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition. COX isoforms have been named constitutive cyclooxygenase-

1 (COX-1) and inducible cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). COX-1 (such as indomethacin, naproxen, 

Ibuprofen) catalyzes the formation of cytoprotective prostaglandins in thrombocytes, vascular 

endothelium, stomach mucosa, kidneys, pancreas, langerhans islets, seminal vesicles and brain 

(128, 129). Induction of COX-2 by various growth factors, proinflammatory agents, endotoxins, 

mitogens and tumor agentes (130, 131) indicates that this isoform may have a role in occurence 

of pathological processes, such as inflammation (132, 133). As a result of studies focused on 

reduction of the adverse effects of NSAIDs, selective COX-2 inhibitors, such as celecoxib and 

rofecoxib, have been developed. Today, it is a well-known hypothesis in medicine that COX-1 

is constitutive and cytoprotective, while COX-2 is an inducible enzyme in the inflamed tissues 

(Figure 15). 



 

27 
 

 
Figure 15: Mechanism of action of the COX-1 and COX-2 in the human body. 

 

NSAID in general in particular Ibuprofen, have been shown to have benefic effects on various 

acute conditions ranging from sepsis, traumatic induced pulmonary damage and wound healing.  

 

1.5.4.1 Action of Ibuprofen in the wound healing process 

 

Ibuprofen has been shown to have benefic effects on acute episodes of a wide range of tissues. 

Ibuprofen was the first phenylpropionate to be marketed in the United States. It has analgesic, 

antipyretic and anti-inflammatory activity and it is well absorbed and well tolerated (134, 135). 

Ibuprofen has also been shown to improve several aspects of the wound healing ranging from 

wound edema. As previously described in literature the second degree burn wounds treated 

with Ibuprofen 5 % from two and five hours after burn showed a significantly reduced lymph 

drainage and no variation in the wound water content (136).

from Liofilchem (Via Scozia, Italy). Propidium Iodide (PI) was purchased from Invitrogen 

(Carlsbad, USA). 

 

2.2 Methods 

2.2.1 Sponge production 

 

S were produced through freeze-drying, as preiously described elsewhere (137). First, MMW 

Chitosan 2 % (w/v) was dissolved in a solution of 1 % (v/v) acetic acid and 4 % (w/v) Gelatin was 

solubilized a Mili-Q water. The samples were stirred for 24 hours at 50 ºC to obtain a 

homogenized solution. Following this, the solution was placed in cylindrical mold and taken to 

-80 ºC, for 14 hours and then lyophilized (Scanvac CoolSafe™, ScanLaf A/S, Denmark) for 24 

hours. The lyophilized structures were recovered from the molds and crosslinked with TPP 2 % 

(w/v) for 4 hours at room temperature (RT). After that, the cycle of freezing and freeze-drying 

was repeated. 

 

2.2.2 Production of membrane and coated sponge 

2.2.2.1 Deacetylation of Chitosan 

 

The LMW Chitosan was deacetylated and further purified in order to improve the surface 

charges to increase its possible the interaction with cells (113). Subsequently, Chitosan was 

dissolved in a NaOH solution. 500 mg of Chitosan was mixed with 10 mL of NaOH (1 M). After 

that, the mixture was heated at 50°C, under magnetic stirring for 4 hours and then filtered 



 

31 
 

through a 0.44 ?m filter in a Buchner funnel. The remaining material was washed extensively 

until the pH was equal to that of ultrapure water. Finally, the samples were dried at 40°C 

overnight (138). 

In order to determine the DD, the recovered deacetylated Chitosan was dissolved in acetic acid 

(1 M). The solution was then filtered with a 0.22 ?m filter to remove any solid particles. 

Subsequently, the pH was adjusted to 7 with NaOH (1 M). The product was then centrifuged 

three times at 4500 rpm (Sigma 3K18C centrifuge) and finally the recovered pellet was freeze-

dried for 24 hours. The DD was measured by determining the first derivative of UV-vis spectrum 

(139). 

 

2.2.2.2 Electrospinning setup 

 

The system used to produce the M and CS was composed by a high power voltage supply 

(Spellman CZE1000R, 0–30 kV), a syringe pump (KDS-100), a syringe fitted with a stainless steel 

blunt end needle and an aluminum plate connected to a conductive collector. The needle was 

positively charged by the power supply and the metal collector was grounded. The charged tip 

and grounded collector form a static electric field between them, to provide the driving force 

that enables fiber formation (91, 140). 

 

2.2.2.3 Production of Chitosan/PEO/PCL/Ibuprofen electrospun membrane 

 

Two solutions were prepared separately: (i) 1.2 g of deacetylated Chitosan (obtained as 

previously described in section 2.2.2.1) was dissolved in 90 % acetic acid and 0.25 g of PEO; and 

(ii) 1 g of PCL and 0.16 mg/mL of Ibuprofen was dissolved in pure acetone. Then these to 

solutions (Chitosan/PEO and PCL/Ibuprofen) were mixed at a ratio of 1:1 (v/v) under stirring 

until a homogenized solution was obtained. Then Ibuprofen at a final concentration of 0.8 

mg/ml was added to the mixture. 

The previously prepared solutions were placed in a 10 ml plastic syringe. The solution flow rate 

was set to 1-2 ml/hour. The electric voltage applied was 20-25 kV and the ground collector was 

at 10 cm from tip of the syringe needle. All experiments were conducted at ambient pressure 

and relative humidity of 15-20 % (141). 

 

2.2.3 Characterization of the physicochemicals properties of sponge, 

membrane and coated sponge 

2.2.3.1 Scanning electron microscopic analysis 

 

The morphologies of S, M and CS were characterized by SEM. The samples were frozen using 

liquid nitrogen and freeze-dried for 3 hours. Subsequently, they were mounted on aluminum 

stumps, coated with gold using a Quorum Q150R ES sputter coater. Then, samples were 



 

32 
 

analyzed using a Hitachi S-3400N scanning electron microscope operated at an accelerating 

voltage of 20 kV and at different magnifications. 

 

2.2.3.2 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic spectroscopy analysis 

 

FTIR analysis is extensively applied for identify the chemical structure of samples (S, M and CS) 

by comparing their spectra with the spectra of the materials used for their production (Quitosan 

LMW and MMW, Gelatin, TPP, PEO, PCL and Ibuprofen). In this technique, the radiation crosses 

the sample and some of it is absorbed, while other part is transmitted. The resulting spectra 

represent the frequency of vibration between the atoms linkage from the sample, creating 

therefore, a specific spectra for those interactions (142). The FTIR spectra of the samples were 

acquired with a spectrophotometer Nicoletis 20 (64 scans, at a range of 4000 to 1000cm?1) from 

Thermo Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with a Smart Itr auxiliary. 

 

2.2.3.3 Contact angle determination 

 

Contact angles of the surface of S, M and CS were determined using a data physics contact 

angle system OCAH 200 apparatus, operating in static mode. For each sample, water drops were 

placed at various locations of the materials surface at RT. The reported contact angles are the 

average of at least three measurements (143). 

 

2.2.3.4 Swelling studies 

 

The water uptake capacity of the samples (S, M, CS) were determined using a sample 

gravimetric method (144). Samples were weighted and incubated in falcons with 5 mL of 

solution phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) at 37 ºC, and at pH 5.5 and pH 7.4. At 

predetermined intervals, the samples were recovered from PBS solution and weighed. Then 

they were re-immersed into the swelling medium. After, the swelling ratio percentages were 

determined using the following equation: 

 

Swelling ratio (%) =
weight ? initial weight

initial weight
× 100     (1) 

 

2.2.3.5 Porosity evaluation 

 

The total porosity of the samples (S, M and CS) was determined by adapting a displacement 

method (145). The total amount of ethanol (100 %) that the samples were able to absorb in 4 

hours, was used to determine the porosity of the samples using the following equation: 

 

Porosity (%) =
weight swollen sponge ? initial weight

density etanol ? volume sponge
× 100     (2) 

 



 

33 
 

2.2.4 Characterization of sponges and coated sponges through in vitro 

assays 

2.2.4.1 In vitro degradation assays 

 

S and CS samples (n=3) were incubated in 10 mL of PBS with or without lysozyme (10 mg/L). 

Samples were maintained at 37 ºC for 21 days (144). After 1, 4, 7, 14 and 21 days samples were 

removed, rinsed twice with distilled water and dried on the lyophilizer. After, samples were 

weighted in order to determine the percentage of weight loss, through equation: 

 

Weight loss (%) =
inicial weight ? final weight

initial weight
× 100       (3) 

 

For complementar analysis, SEM images were also acquired to characterize the morphology and 

porosity of the samples for each degradation period. 

 

2.2.4.2 Proliferation analysis of NHDF cells in contact with samples 

 

NHDF cells were seeded in T-flasks of 25 cm2 with 6 mL of DMEM-F12 supplemented with heat-

inactivated 10 % FBS (v/v) and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution. Hereafter, cells were kept 

in culture at 37 °C in a 5 % dioxide carbon (CO2) humidified atmosphere, inside an incubator 

(146). When cell confluence was achieved, cells were sub cultivated by 3-5 minutes incubation 

in 0.18 % trypsin (1:250) and 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Then, cells were 

centrifuged, resuspended in culture medium and then seeded in T-flasks of 75 cm2 and 

maintained in culture using the same conditions.  

To evaluate cell viability in the presence of the samples (S, M and CS) herein produced, each 

sample were added (n=5) into a 96-well cell culture plates. Previously to cell seeding samples 

were sterilized by UV exposure for at least 30 min. 

NHDF cells were seeded at a density of 2x104 cells per well in 96-well plates containing the 

samples (S, M and CS). Cells where maintained in DMEM-F12 supplemented with heat-

inactivated 10 % FBS (v/v). Hereafter, cells were kept in culture at 37 °C, in a 5 % CO2 

humidified atmosphere, inside an incubator (146). After 24, 48 and 72 hours of cells being in 

contact with samples (S, M and CS) were monitored by Olympus CX41 inverted light microscope 

(Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an Olympus SP-500 UZ digital camera (143, 146) was used to 

monitor cellular growth. 

The biocompatibility of the samples was also evaluated, after cells being in contact with the 

samples during for 24, 48 and 72 hours, through an MTT assay was performed. Briefly, the 

culture medium of each well was removed and replaced with a mixture of 100 ?L of fresh 

medium and 20 ?L of MTT reagent solution. After a period of 4 hours of MTT incubation at 37 

°C, under a 5 % CO2 humidified atmosphere, the medium was aspirate leaving just the formazan 

crystals. These crystals were dissolved with 200 µL Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) using on orbital 



 

34 
 

shaker. After, the absorbance of the produced formazan was measured at 570 nm using a 

microplate reader (BIO-RAD xMark TM Microplate Spectrophotometer) (147). Wells containing 

cells in the culture medium without any sample were used as negative control. 70% EtOH was 

added to other wells containing cells which and were used as positive control (66). 

 

2.2.4.3 Scanning electron microscopic analysis of cells adhesion 

 

Cells adhesion of the S, M and CS were analysed by SEM. After 24, 48 and 72 hours of culture, 

samples with cells were recovered and washed in PBS. Then, samples were emerged in 2.5 % 

(v/v) glutaraldehyde at 4ºC to fix cells (144). Samples were then frozen using liquid nitrogen 

and freeze-dried for 3 hours. Subsequently, samples were mounted on aluminum stumps, 

coated with gold using an Quorum Q150R ES sputter coater (137). Lastly, samples were analyzed 

using a Hitachi S-3400N scanning electron microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 

20 kV and at different magnifications. 

 

2.2.4.4 Confocal microscopic analysis of the sponge and coated sponge 

 

CLSM was used to evaluate the ability of cells to become internalize in the samples. For the 

visualization of NHDF cells within samples (S and CS), 1×104 cells/well were seeded in ?-Slide 8 

well Ibidi imaging plates (Ibidi GmbH, Germany) in contact with samples. After 24 hours, cells 

were fixed with 4 % PFA for 20 min. After, cells were stained with 1 ?L of PI (1 mg/mL) during 

15 min, at 37 ºC. Then, the PI solution was washed and the samples were washed three times 

with PBS. Imaging experiments were performed in a Zeiss LSM 710 CLSM (Carl Zeiss SMT Inc., 

USA), where consecutive z-stacks were acquired. 3D reconstruction and image analysis was 

performed in Zeiss Zen 2010 (143). 

 

2.2.5. Incorporation of Ibuprofen in sponges 

2.2.5.1 IC50 determination of the Ibuprofen in NHDF cells  

 

To determine IC50 of Ibuprofen for NHDF cells, cells were initially seeded at a density of 2x104 

cells/well in a 96-well cell culure plates, containing DMEM-F12 supplemented with 10 % FBS 

(v/v). Adherent cells were grown at 37 °C, in an incubator with a humidified atmosphere 

containing 5 % CO2. In the following day, culture medium was replaced and cells were incubated 

with crescent concentrations of Ibuprofen (0.25, 0.50, 0.70, 0.75, 0.80 and 0.90 mg/mL). Wells 

containing cells in the culture medium without Ibuprofen were used as negative control. EtOH 

70 % was added to wells containing cells that were used as positive control.  

 

2.2.5.2 Characterization of the Ibuprofen release profile 

 



 

35 
 

The release studies were performed in order to evaluate the rate of drug release from the 

samples. First, 10 mL of PBS was added to a falcon, at 37º C, pH=7.4. Afterwards, 1 mL of the 

samples were periodically taken along 50 hours and substituted by equal amount of PBS. Spectra 

of the recovered samples were acquired using a UV-1700 PharmaSpec spectrophotometer from 

Shimadzu (Kyoto, Japan) and analyzed with an UVProbe Shimadzu 2.0 software. The absorbance 

of various samples concentrations of Ibuprofen in PBS was determined at 264 nm. A drug 

calibration curve was performed usind various concentrations of Ibuprofen (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 

0.5 mg/mL), and determining their absorvance at 264 nm.  

 

2.2.5.3 Characterization of the cytotoxic profile of the samples loaded with 

Ibuprofen 

 

The Ibuprofen cytotoxic profile was characterized by means of in vitro assays. The MTT assay 

(described in detail in topic 2.2.4.2) was performed to further evaluate the cytotoxicity of this 

drug. The absorbance of the produced formazan was measured at 570 nm using a microplate 

reader (BIO-RAD xMark TM Microplate Spectrophotometer) (147). Wells containing cells in the 

culture medium without any sample were used as negative control. 70 % EtOH was added to 

wells containing cells, that were used as positive control. 

 

2.2.6 Sponge and coated sponge antimicrobial activity 

 

To evaluate the antimicrobial effect of the S and CS, Staphyloccocus aureus was used as a 

model of Gram-positive bacteria usually present in skin injuries. The bacterial culture medium 

(LB Broth) was inoculated with Staphyloccocus aureus at a concentration of 1x108 colony-

forming units (CFU)/ml. A negative control was prepared without samples and a positive control 

was prepared with addition of the Kanamycin antibiotic (2µL). Then, 2 ml of inoculum were 

added to an agar petri dish using scattering method. Samples (S and CS) were previously 

sterilized with UV for 30 minutes, and then placed on the plates. The plate was incubated 24 

hours at 37 ºC. After incubation, the halos that resulted from the inhibitory effect of S and CS 

were observed macroscopicaly. After the bacterial assay, materials were removed from the 

agar plate and fixed in glutaraldehyde overnight. They were subsequently frozen in liquid 

nitrogen (-180 °C), lyophilized and analysed by SEM. The inhibitory halo was measured using an 

image analysis software—ImageJ (148) . 

 

2.2.7 Statistical analysis of the results 

 

Statistical analysis of the obteined results were performed, using one-way ANOVA with the 

Dunnet’s post hoc test and Newman- Keuls multiple comparison test. Each result is the mean ± 

standard error of the mean of at least three independent experiments (82)

3. Results and Discussion 

3.1 Characterization of the properties of sponge, membrane and 

coated sponge 

 

The Chitosan is known by its antitumoral, antifungal and antimicrobial activity (149). 

Furthermore, Chitosan and its derivatives are also known by their capacity to improve the 

wound healing process by enhancing the functions of inflammatory cells such as macrophages. 

Chitosan can also increase the tensile strength of wounds (150).  

For skin regeneration, the antimicrobial activity of Chitosan against different microorganisms 

is very important. There are two main mechanisms associated with inhibition of microbial cells 

by Chitosan (151). The interaction of Chitosan with the anionic groups on the cell surface that 

causes the formation of an impermeable layer around the cell that prevents the transport of 

essential solutes. 

Chitosan degree of deacetylation (DD) and Molecular weight (MW), have also influence on its 

antimicrobial activity, hydrophilicity, degradation and cell response (152). The number of free 

amino groups increases with the DD and these groups are able to interact with the membrane. 

It was reported that Chitosan with relatively high DD 89 % strongly stimulated fibroblast 

proliferation, while samples with lower DD showed a lower cellular growth. 

Taking these facts into account it is fundamental that 3D constructs be built with Chitosan with 

LMW and a high DD. In this work LMW Chitosan was further deacetylated. The DD of the 

commercial LMW Chitosan is defined as the percentage of primary amine groups in the Chitosan 

structure. Chitosan DD can be controlled by processing the polymer with an alkaline treatment 

(e.g. NaOH) (153). This allows the interaction between Chitosan and cells, stimulating their 

adhesion and proliferation and also improving its antimicrobial and haemostatic activities, thus 

enhancing Tissue Regeneration (71, 122). The results obtained herein demonstrate that the 

percentage of DD Chitosan obtained was around 96 % (Table 2), which is higher than that of the 

commercial one (153).

3.2 Morphologic characterization of the samples 

3.2.1 Membrane morphology 

 

The M consisting of Chitosan, PEO and PCL was produced by electrospinning. Macroscopically it 

is possible to observe that the M is formed by a homogenous and dense structure of fibers 

(Figure 16 A1). A more detailed analysis through SEM image of the M reveals its dense 3D 

nanofiber network comprised by randomly arranged fibers, which results in an interconnected 

porous structure (Figure 16 A2). This 3D organization creates a large contact area with 

anchoring points for cell-nanofiber interactions enhancing cell adhesion, migration and 

proliferation (154). The porous nature is beneficial for cellular infiltration and proliferation 

(155). Additionally, porosity also ensures a correct gas, nutrient and fluids exchanges, processes 

that are fundamental for obtaining hemostasis and proper wound healing (155). 

 

 
Figure 16: Macroscopic (A1) and SEM images (A2) of the M. Graphical representation of fiber diameter 

ranges (B) from 142 measures by using Image J. 

 



 

39 
 

The distribution of the fibers diameter was measured using the image processing program Image 

J (148). The most common fiber diameter was around 0.3 and 0.4 µm (Figure 16 B). Although 

it is important to achieve M mostly constituted by nanofibers with few hundred nanomaters of 

diameter, once it is described that the reduction of the diameter of the fibers leads to an 

increased cell adhesion and proliferation (156). The fiber diameter is also an importante feature 

that influence the release of bioactive molecules (93) through diffusion (93). 

 

3.2.2 Sponges and coated sponges morphology 

 

The sponges produced in this work were obtained by a freeze-drying method, where the 

formation of ice crystals improved the porosity of the samples (Liapis et al., 1996). In Figure 

17 it is possible to observe that the design S and CS have a porous and interconnected 3D 

structure. In SEM images, demonstrate that the CS is perfectly covered by the nanofibers (Figure 

17 B c), and d)). The S and CS possess continuous interconnected pores up to 400-500 µm of 

diameter. Pore size is an important condition for skin regeneration. If pores are too small, cells 

will cover the pores, influencing cell migration and inhibiting neovascularization. On the other 

hand, if they are too large a decrease in cellular adhesion can occur. 

 

 

Figure 17: (A) Macroscopic and microscopic images of S. (B) Macroscopic images and microscopic images 

of CS. 

 

For better characterize the porosity of the samples, liquid displacement method using ethanol 

was also performed (Figure 18).

Figure 18: Determination of the porosity of S, M and CS. Where ** represents p&lt;0.001 and **** p&lt;0.0001. 

 

Accordingly to SEM images, S presented the highest value of porosity 51.60 % ± 2.45, when 

compared with the CS 39.00 % ± 0.37 and M 1.50 % ± 0.17. However even CS has a good 

percentage porosity for cell migration, adhesion, proliferation and also the diffusion of 

nutrients, oxygen and waste products, leading to an improved wound healing (143). 

The Chitosan/Gelatin sponges obtained by the freeze-drying method are highly porous, allowing 

the unhindered diffusion of solutes and nutrients. Also, the interconnectivity between the pores 

provides more space and surface area-to-volume ratio for cell growth and local angiogenesis 

(146). Pores also promote fluids drainage, which is fundamental to prevent the build-up of 

exudates (66). 

 

3.3 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic analysis of the sponge, 

membrane and coated sponge 

 

In infrared spectroscopy the radiation crosses the sample and some of it is absorbed, while 

other part is transmitted. The resulting spectra represent the frequency of vibration between 

the atoms linkage from the sample, creating therefore, a specific spectra for those interactions 

(142). The FTIR analysis of the freeze-dryed sponges was performed to characterize the 

chemical composition of the different samples (Figure 19).  

 



 

41 
 

 
Figure 19: FTIR spectra of the produced S (A), M (B) and CS (C) and respective constituents: Quitosan 

MMW, Quitosan deacetylated LMW, Gelatin, TPP (Tripolyphosphate), poly (ethylene oxide (PEO)), poly (?-

caprolactone) (PCL) and Ibuprofen. 

 

The characteristic peaks of TPP, Gelatin and MMW Chitosan are observed in the S (Figure 19 A). 

In previous studies it was reported that the MMW Chitosan present characteristics peak at 1640 

cm-1 (C=O stretch in primary amide) and 1546 cm-1 (N-H stretch in primary amine) (157). The 

other characteristic peak is observed at 3266 cm-1, that confirms the presence of Chitosan 

owing to the N-H group stretching in the polysaccharide, as referred by Bhat and collaborators 

(158). Gelatin present bands at 3284 cm-1 (N-H in amines), 1633 cm-1 (C=O stretch in primary 

amide) and 1531 cm-1 (N-H deformation in secondary amides).  

The spectrum of the LMW deacetylated Chitosan (Figure 19 B) shows a variation in the 

wavelength of the peak from 1546 to 1433 cm-1, indicating that the secondary amide (—NH—R) 

has been further changed to primary amide (—NH2) by alkaline deacetylation (157). The process 

of deacetylation of Chitosan was achieved, leading to and increase in the number of amine 

groups at its surface. The electrostatic interaction between the positive charges of the amine 

groups of Chitosan and negative charges of phospholipids of cell membrane is more efficient.  

The nanofiber present in M (Figure 19 B), show characteristic PCL peak at 1723 cm-1, and the 

C-H stretching region of FTIR spectrum, the higher intensity peak at 2936 cm-1. PEO presents 

the characteristics peaks at 2875 cm-1 in the C-H stretching. 

In relation to CS, all its characteristic peaks are present in the spectrum (Figure 19 C). Also, it 

is possible to observe the representative peaks of the Ibuprofen, being the most characteristic 

the ones present at 2870 and 2727 cm-1 highlighted by the C-H stretching vibrations peaks that 



 

42 
 

correspond to the alkyl groups of Ibuprofen. The sharp peak at 1702 cm-1 belongs to a carboxyl 

vibration, that is characteristic of Ibuprofen (159). 

 

3.4 Contact angle of the sponge, membrane and coated sponge 

 

The determination of contact angle is important to verify the hydrophobicity of the samples, 

since it interferes with cellular behaviour and then influence the tissue regeneration. It is 

known that hydrophilicity improves Tissue Regeneration by allowing cell migration, adhesion, 

proliferation and also the diffusion of nutrients (143). 

The contact angle is defined as the angle formed by the intersection of the liquid-solid interface 

and the liquid-vapor interface (geometrically acquired by applying a tangent line from the 

contact point along the liquid-vapor interface in the droplet profile). Small contact angles 90° 

correspond to high wettability, while large contact angles correspond to low wettability i.e. 

hydrophobic character. Since PCL is a hydrophobic compound, its application will confer a 

hydrophobic character to M, that showed, contact angle 96.24º ± 4.70. The S and CS are both 

hydrophilic, having contact angles of 71.14 º ± 2.55 and 45.64 º ± 6.08, respectively (Table 3).  

 

Table 3: Contact angles determined for the produced samples. 

Materials Water contact angle 

S 71.14º ± 2.55 º 

M 96.24º ± 4.70º 

CS 45.64º ± 6.08º 

 

The sponge coating confers a more hydrophilic character to CS and improved cell adhesion and 

proliferation, wich are fundamental for skin regeneration. 

 

3.6 Characterization of swelling profile of the sponge, membrane and coated 

sponge 

 

Polimeric biomaterials tend to absorb fluids due to osmotic pressure in order to fill the void 

regions of the polymeric network and within the beads that remained dehydrated, until they 

reach the equilibrium state. The water uptake causes an increase in the pore diameters 

allowing a subsequent diffusion of cells, nutrients, bioactive molecules and waste products 

through the biomaterials, which is for essential in skin regeneration. Also, the swelling profile 

of the samples are fundamental for the wound cleaning and allowing exudates removal. 

The swelling studies are important to notice that the solvent used for the assay must have 

similar properties to that the fluids present in skin wounds. Therefore, the swelling test was 

conducted by immersing materials in PBS at pH 7.4 and 5.5. 



 

43 
 

The swelling degree is dependent on the pore size of samples and on the polymer-solvent 

interactions (160-162). S and CS have a very porous structure, as a consequence, these sponges 

had higher percentages of sweeling ratio, between 800-1000 % in both the CS (Figure 22) and 

in S (Figure 20). It is noteworthy that at pH 7.4 the swelling was always higher whereof pH 5.5. 

Such swelling behaviour can be explained by the presence of hydrophilic groups in Chitosan and 

Gelatin, such as hydroxyl, amino and carboxyl groups that can be easily hydrated (31, 163). 

 

 

Figure 20: Swelling profile of the produced S (A) and close-up of the first 250 minutes (B). The swelling 

studies were carried out at pH 7.4 (shown in blue) and pH 5.5 (shown in orange). 



 

44 
 

 

Figure 21: Swelling profile of the produced M (A) and a close-up of the first 400 minutes (B). The swelling 

studies were carried out at pH 7.4 (shown in blue) and pH 5.5 (shown in orange). 



 

45 
 

 
Figure 22: Swelling profile of the produced CS (A) and a close-up of the first 250 minutes (B). The swelling 

studies were carried out at pH 7.4 (shown in blue) and pH 5.5 (shown in orange). 

 

The M swelling profile percentage is very low (Figure 21) in accordance with its hydrophobic 

constituition (PCL) and low degree of porosity. Such may be responsible for the lower swelling 

ratio percentage of CS in relation to S. The swelling percentage of CS is approximately 800 % 

(86, 164). Such result may be explained through the lower porosity of CS, since it is coated with 

PCL. 

 

3.7 In vitro degradation of the sponge and coated sponge 

 

While occurs the formation of a new tissue it is also important to ensure that materials are 

degradaded in order to allow cell growth.  

To study the degradability of the biomaterials produced, their degradation studies. In these 

profile was studied in vitro, sponges were immersed in a saline solution with enzymes that are 

involved in the degradation of the biomaterials that constitute the 3D construct. The 

determination of weight loss allow to characterize materials degradation profile. The 

degradation study was performed with PBS and PBS plus Lysozyme (enzyme present in human 



 

46 
 

body that is responsible for Chitosan degradation). In Figure 23 A and 24 A are represented the 

degradation over time of the S and CS in solution of PBS and PBS plus Lysozyme.

(B). The tests were performed during 1, 4, 7, 14 and 21 days, in PBS and PBS plus Lysozyme. The pH of 

the solutions was set to 7.4.

Figure 24: Characterization of the degradation profile of CS. SEM images (A), and graph representation 

(B). The tests were performed during 1, 4, 7, 14 and 21 days in solutions of PBS and PBS plus Lysozyme. 

The pH was set to 7.4. 

 

In Figure 23 B and 24 B, it was noticed that after 24 hours both samples (S and CS) had a weight 

loss of about 50 % in PBS and Lysozyme. Nevertheless, as expected in the presence of Lysozyme 

the degradation degree was higher (Figure 23 B and 24 B). In conclusion, it can be concluded 

that sponges, suffer a high degree of degradation when immersed in the lysozyme solution.  

 

3.8 Evaluation of cellular viability and cell proliferation in contact with 

sponge, membrane and coated sponge 

 

As already previous described above it is very important to produce biocompatible materials. 

The biocompatibility of a biomaterial is important since it should be capable of elicit an 

appropriate response for a specific application, and also do not trigger on, inflammatory or 

toxic reaction when in contact with a live tissue or body fluids. The cellular viability of NHDF 

in contact with the produced sponges was quantitatively measured at 24, 48 and 72 hours using 

an MTT assay. The values of absorbances obtained for formazan are directly proportional the 

number of viable cells. 

Fibroblasts cells were chosen, due to their potential for skin regeneration, since they 

synthetized ECM proteins (e.g. collagen and fibronectin), cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-?) and 

growths factors that are essential for the wound healing process (42).  



 

48 
 

The results of the MTT assay (Figure 25) show that the produced sponges are biocompatible, 

displaying a higher cell viability than the positive control (k+), however lower than negative 

control (k-). The cellular viability is higher than 70 % wich is in accordance with the during 

requirements of ISO 10993 (165).

49 
 

 

3.9. Characterization of cells adhesion and penetration within produced 

samples 

 

SEM analysis was also performed, to further characterize the cell adhesion and proliferation at 

the surface of the S, M and CS (Figure 26). Filopoidia was observed at 48 and 72 hours in the 

surface of the produced materials (Figure 26).  

 

 

Figure 26: SEM images of NHDF in contact with S, M, and CS after 24, 48 and 72 hours. Arrows indicate 

cells at the surface of the materials. 

 

The interaction between cells and sponges is mediated by integrins, which recognize specific 

motifs at materials surface like RGD sequences of Gelatin.

Chitosan because it emits fluorescence and the red points are represent cells that were labeled with PI. 

Scale bar: 200 µm. 

 

CLSM allows the acquisition of high-resolution optical images. The principle behind CLSM is to 

use a focused laser beam through a sample and then collect the reflected or emitted light from 

the sample, while removing any light originated from the outside of the focal point of the laser 

beam. The CLSM can collect images of individual slices using fluorescence or reflection from a 

sample in the xy, xz and yz planes (166). Through the analysis of CLSM images obtained (Figure 

27) it was concluded that cells penetrate into sponges, as described in the topic 2.2.4.4.  

 

3.10 Determination of the concentration of Ibuprofen that must be used to 

improve wound healing 

 

The IC50 of a drug is the minimum concentration that is able to kill half of the population of 

cells (167). Therefore, the IC50 of Ibuprofen was determined in order to know the concentration 

of drug that could be used without killing 50 % the cells. Figure 28 A shows that the 50 % viable 

cells is around 0.75 to 0.80 mg/mL of the Ibuprofen. Therefore the IC50 of Ibuprofen was 

determined (Figure 28 B). Experimental IC50 was calculated through the fitting a the 

experimental data and a value of 819.58 ± 2.42 µg/mL, was determined by Origin software. 

Should be noted that R2 0.99 and Chi2 0.5 values obtained in this IC50 curve fit provide a high 

confidence in the obtained results.

Ibuprofen in contact with NHDF. Blue curve represents the mathematical fitting performed for IC50 

calculation. n=5. 

 

3.11 Determination of the release profile of Ibuprofen from coated sponge 

 

The porous sponges produced herein can be used as a drug delivery system from which drugs 

are released by diffusion along time (168). In order to verify if the amount of drug released is 

toxic for cells, the release profile of Ibuprofen was studied. The assay involved the collecting 

of dipping solutions that were in contact with CS and maintained at 37 ° C, pH 7.4, at 5, 10, 

24, 28, 30, 46 and 50 hours. Its absorbance was determined at 264 nm in order to characterize 

the release profile of Ibuprofen (169). The calibration curve of Ibuprofen was performed using 

different concentrations (Figure 29). During the 50 hours only about 20 % of Ibuprofen loaded 

in sponges was released, suggesting that the drug remained trapped in the fibers (Figure 30).

drug were used. Absorbance was determined at 264 nm.

3.12 Determination of the cellular viability in contact with coated sponges 

loaded with Ibuprofen 

 

Figure 31: Determination of the cellular viability in contact with Ibuprofen loaded on S, M and CS. The 

negative control (K-)(live cells); positive control (K+) (dead cells). 

 

The results obtained revealed that 65-75 % of cells remaned viable after 72 hours, when they 

were in contact with materials loaded with Ibuprofen (Figure 31). Taking into account the IC50 

of Ibuprofen that was previously determined (Figure 28 B), a concentration of 0.8 mg/mL of 

Ibuprofen was incorporated in each of the sponges. However, due to the obtained results, it is 

necessary to use a lower Ibuprofen concentration to increase cellular viability when cells are 

in contact with sponges. 

 



 

53 
 

3.13 Evaluation of antimicrobial activity of the sponge and coated sponge 

 

The antibacterial properties of the materials produced here were evaluated using, 

Staphylococcus aureus as model bacteria (Figure 32). This bacteria is considered appropriate 

to test the antibacterial properties of the sponges, since it is the most common pathogen found 

in skin infections. 

 

Figure 32: Evaluation of the antimicrobial properties of the produced sponges. Macroscopic images of the 

S and CS show the formation of an inhibitory halo (A and B); SEM images show that nobiofilm was formed 

on sponge surface (C and D); The negative control (Staphylococcus aureus grown in agar plate)) in present 

in (E).  

 

In order to assess biofilm formation on the surface of the material, SEM images were also 

acquired (Figure 32 C and 32 D). In the case of the S it can be observed that the formation of 

an inhibition zone (Figure 32 A). Regarding CS can also observe the formation of an inhibitory 

halo was also observed (Figure 32 B), however the diameter of the halo is relatively greater 

then that of S. For both materials no biofilm formation was observed on their surface on the 

surface. The S and CS produced here showed in skin regeneration.

4. Conclusion 

 

Wound healing is a major worldwide health problem that particularly affects the elderly and 

diabetic population. In recent years, different therapeutic approaches have been proposed for 

improving the wound healing process. Among the different dressings developed so far, sponges 

that mimic the ECM have emerged as platforms that can trigger specific cellular responses at 

the molecular level. These wound dressings not only provide a favourable 3D microenvironment 

for cell adhesion and proliferation, but also allows gas, nutrients and waste products diffusion. 

Furthermore, these 3D matrices also confer protection to the wound from possible secondary 

bacterial infection. 

In this study, non-toxic, highly porous and with antibactericidal activity sponges were produced 

using a mixture of two biocompatible natural polysaccharides (Chitosan (MMW) and Gelatin). 

Sponges were also coated with a nanofibrous membrane. This coating was intended to increase 

contact surfaces of the material in order to increase cell interaction with sponges and also 

reproduce layers of skin. 

The obtained results revealed that S and CS promote the formation of a consistent 3D structure 

that supports cell adhesion and proliferation. In addition, SEM and CLSM analysis of sponges 

seeded with NHDF cells showed that cells were able to adhere and proliferate which is 

fundamental for a more rapid healing process be obtained. 

Cell viability was evaluated through a MTT assay and the results confirm that the cells remain 

viable in contact with the sponges. Moreover, their antimicrobial activity was also assessed by 

the formation of inhibitory halos and of biofilm on the surface of the sponges. Thus, it can be 

concluded that, based on our in vitro studies, the sponges are biocompatible and that they have 

properties that are compatible with their application as a wound dressings.
