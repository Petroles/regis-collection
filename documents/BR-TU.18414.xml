SUMMARY 
 

Clinical and radiographic findings after intra -
articular replacement of cranial cruciate ligament with a 
polyester prosthesis using a modified over-the-top technique were 
evaluated in six dogs. Seven surgeries were done due to bilateral 
involvement of the cranial cruciate ligament in one dog. Clinical 
evaluation was performed on postoperative days 3, 10 and 40, 
and radiographic evaluation was done at 5 and 24 months after 
surgery in five dogs, where signs of progressive degenerative 
joint disease were confirmed. Resolution of clinical signs was 
observed from 25 to 68 days after surgery as evaluated by dog 
owners. Overall function of joint movement after surgery was 
classified as good. Two dogs presented fraying of the implant 
after surgery. It was concluded that the polyester prosthesis, as 
implanted in these dogs, was not a satisfactory replacement for 
the injured ligament, as better results may be obtained with less 
invasive and simpler techniques.  
 
Key words : polyester prosthesis, cranial cruciate ligament, dog. 
 
RESUMO  
 
 Os achados clínicos e radiográficos após reparo 
intra -articular do ligamento cruzado cranial com prótese de 
poliéster, utilizando a técnica over-the-top modificada, foram 
avaliada em seis cães. Sete cirurgias foram realizadas devido ao 
acometimento bilateral em um dos animais. A avaliação clínica 
foi realizada ao 3o, 10o e 40o dias de pós-operatório, e a 
avaliação radiográfica realiza da ao 5o e 24o meses após a 

cirurgia em cinco cães, por meio da qual se confirmou a 
progressão da doença articular degenerativa. A resolução dos 
sinais clínicos foi observada entre o 25o e 68o dias após a 
cirurgia, segundo avaliação realizada pelos proprietários. A 
função do membro operado foi considerada boa. Dois cães 
apresentaram desgaste e ruptura da prótese após a cirurgia. 
Concluiu -se que a prótese de poliéster, da forma como foi 
implantada neste estudo, não pode ser considerada como 
substituto satisfatório, uma vez que resultados superiores podem 
ser obtidos com ténicas menos invasivas e mais simples.

INTRODUCTION 
 
 Rupture of the cranial cruciate ligament 
(CCL) is among the most common causes of 
hindlimb lameness in the dog (AIKEN et al., 1992; 
VASSEUR 1993; MOORE &amp;amp; READ 1996a; 
VASSEUR et al., 1996), and contralateral rupture of 
the CCl may affect 30% of dogs presented initially 
(DOVERSPIKE et al., 1993; HARASEN, 1995).  

Clinical signs vary among dogs but 
hindlimb lameness is a frequent finding. Older dogs 
may present an insidious episode of lameness

probably associated with degenerative changes 
within the joint prior to CCL rupture (DENNY, 
1993). Pain is normally observed during palpation 
after a traumatic rupture (MOORE &amp;amp; READ, 1996b) 
and dogs will start to use the limb again within two 
to three weeks; however, as degenerative joint 
disease (DJD) progresses, hindlimb lamenes will 
become evident. DJD may be present at the time of 
rupture (MOORE &amp;amp; READ, 1996b) or result from 
instability caused by primary incompetence of the 
CCL (ELKINS et al., 1991; VASSEUR &amp;amp; BERRY, 
1992; FITCH et al., 1995; METELMAN et al., 
1995).  

Cranial drawer sign is normally present in 
a CCL-deficient stifle and diagnosis of a ruptured 
ligament is confirmed after arthrotomy (HULSE, 
1995; MOORE &amp;amp; READ, 1996b; PIERMATTEI &amp;amp; 
FLO, 1997). Recent studies have shown that 
radiographic evaluation of affected joints does not 
consistently assess joint instability (ROOSTER &amp;amp; 
VAN BREE, 1999), but it may be indicated to 
evaluate secondary degenerative changes within the 
joint (HULSE, 1995; RACKARD, 1996). 

Non-surgical treatment of CCL ruptures 
may be effective in dogs weighing less than 15kg 
(VASSEUR, 1984), however, heavier or active dogs 
will benefit from surgical stabilization of the 
affected joint (HULSE, 1995; MOORE &amp;amp; READ, 
1996a; PIERMATTEI &amp;amp; FLO, 1997). Described 
surgical techniques are divided into two major 
groups: intra or extra -articular procedures. Extra-
articular techniques rely on placement of a lateral 
band of biological tissue or synthetic material for 
limiting cranial translation and internal rotation of 
the tibia, resulting in periarticular fibrosis (AIKEN 
et al., 1992; RACKARD, 1996; VASSEUR et al., 
1996), whereas intra -articular repair is theoretically 
preferable as it provides a more accurate function of 
the created neoligament (A RNOCSKY, 1996; 
VASSEUR et al., 1996). 

Materials used as substitutes for the 
ruptured CCl include autogenous fascia lata 
(ELKINS et al., 1991; ARNOCSKY, 1993; 
COETZEE &amp;amp; LUBBE, 1995; METELMAN et al., 
1995; MOORE &amp;amp; READ, 1996a) and synthetic 
replacements (MOORE &amp;amp; READ, 1996a, 
VASSEUR et al., 1996; CAMARGO et al., 2001). 
Synthetic materials are advantageous in comparison 
with biological materials because they can be made 
to meet requirements of intra -articular placement 
and surgery is less traumatic as it is related to 
collection of biological grafts (VASSEUR et al., 
1996). The Leeds-Keio implant was experimentally 
used in dogs (FUJIKAWA &amp;amp; ISEKI, 1991; 
VASSEUR et al., 1996) and sheep (SCHINDHELM 

et al., 1991) with the purpose of serving as a 
scaffold for ingrowth of pre -placed autogenous 
tissue resulting in formation of a biological 
ligament.  

The purpose of this study was to evaluate 
t h e  clinical and radiographic results after repairing 
of the CCL-deficient stifle in dogs using a polyester 
prostheses. 
 
MATERIALS AND METHOD 
 
Case details and evaluation 
 This study was conducted in six 
consecutive dogs suspected of having cranial 
cruciate ligament rupture presented to the Veterinary 
Teaching Hospital of the Universidade Estadual 
Paulista at Jaboticabal, state of São Paulo, Brazil. 
Data obtained from clinical files included breed, sex, 
body weight, age at presentation, clinical signs, 
duration of symptoms and previous treatments. 
Clinical diagnosis was based in the presence of 
hindlimb lameness associated with a positive cranial 
drawer sign. Rupture of the cranial cruciate ligament 
was confirmed during exploratory arthrotomy. 

The degree of lameness was recorded and 
classified as: grade 0 (free of lameness), grade 1 
(lameness only after exercise), grade 2 (weight-
bearing with intermitent lameness), grade 3 
(continuous weight-bearing lameness) and grade 4 
(non-weight-bearing lameness). Radiographs taken 
in cranio-caudal and medio -lateral projections were 
used to assess any secondary osteoarthritic changes 
at the time of presentation and after surgery. 
Degenerative changes were classified according to 
COETZEE &amp;amp; LUBBE (1995) as: absent (no 
osteophytes ), mild (osteophytes visible on the patella 
only), moderate (osteophytes on the patella and 
trochlear ridges of the femur) and severe (severe 
osteophyte formation, sclerosis and irregularities on 
the fabelllae). 

 
Surgical procedure 

Dogs were anesthetized and the affected 
limb prepared for asseptic surgery. Amoxicilin -
clavulanatea was given subcutaneously and flunixin 
meglumineb was given intravenously at the time of 
induction. A lateral parapatellar approach to the joint 
was used. After incision of the join t capsule, the 
patella was luxated medially for exploration of the 
joint. Remnants of the cranial cruciate ligaments 
were excised and the joint flushed with 0,9% saline. 
A tibial tunnel was prepared by drilling a hole in the 
cranio-medial portion of the tibial insertion of the 
CCL so that the distal portion of the hole emerged in 
the medial aspect of the proximal tibial metaphysis.

A drill hole was then made in the lateral aspect of 
the lateral femoral condyle and one of the 
extremities of the prosthesis c was secured in place 
with a washer and screw. The free end of the 
prosthesis was directed from caudal to cranial, over 
the top of the lateral femoral condyle, emerging in 
the intercondylar fossa, passing through the tibial 
tunnel, pulled snugly from within the joint, and fixed 
in place with a washer and a screw with the limb in 
external rotation and slight flexion, while the tibia 
was pushed caudally. 

After thorough lavage of the joint with 
0.9% saline, the joint capsule was closed using 
polyglactin d in a simple continuous pattern. The 
retinaculum was sutured in a similar manner using a 
polydioxanonee suture. Subcutaneous and skin were 
sutured in a routine manner. Limbs were not 
bandaged after the surgery and dogs were dismissed 
from hospital immediately after recovery from 
anesthesia. Owners started passive range of motion 
at postoperative day 1. Exercise was limited to leash 
walks for 6 weeks after surgery. 

Dogs were evaluated clinically on 
postoperative days 3, 10 and 40. In four animals, 
clinical and radiographic evaluations were 
performed at 5 and 24 months after surgery. 

 
RESULTS 
 
 All dogs had a complete rupture of the 
CCL as observed intra -operatively. In this study, 
seven joints were operated, as dog # 2 presented a 
contralateral rupture 4 months after initial 
presentation. The mean age of dogs was 4.8 ± 0.48 
years with a mean body weight of 40 ± 16.5kg. 
Equal distribution of males and females was 
observed. Dogs did not present 
a meniscus lesion at time of 
surgery. Dog # 1 was presented 
seven months after initial 
surgery with ipsilateral 
hindlimb lameness and was 
submitted to an exploratory 
stifle arthrotomy. Rupture of 
the polyester prostheses was 
observed and a lateral fabello -
tibial suture was used to 
stabilize the joint. Dog # 5 died 
18 months after initial surgery 
from unrelated causes and at 
necropsy, severe osteophytosis 
and complete rupture of the 
prostheses was observed. In 
both cases where rupture of the 
prosthesis was observed, it 

occurred proximal to the insertion at the tibial 
tunnel. 
 On presentation, one dog presented grade 
1 lameness, two had grade 2 lameness and three had 
grade 3 lameness (Table 1). A positive cranial 
drawer sign was observed in all affected stifles in 
both extension and flexion, indicating complete 
rupture of the CCL. 

Dogs were bearing weight on the operated 
limbs 3 to 10 days after surgery. Cranial drawer sign 
was not observed at this time interval, however, by 
day 40 postoperatively, it increased in all of the 
stifles as compared to immediate postoperative 
evaluation. Limb use was consistently poorer on 
postoperative day 3, but it progressively improved 
after 10 to 40 days when lameness was absent in 
three dogs and had diminished by at least one grade 
in the others (Table 1). Continuous weight-bearing 
was observed starting from day 25 to 68 as reported 
by owners. Dogs # 1, 2, and 3 were clinically and 
radiographically assessed at 5 and 24 months after 
surgery. Dogs # 4 and 6 were not evaluated at 5 
months but were at 24 months postoperatively. Dog 
# 1 was also evaluated seven months after initial 
surgery. All dogs were classified as having good 
limb function according to their owners, however, 
joint laxity accompanied by crepitation and 
diminished range of motion was observed in all 
dogs. Pain was not elicited on manipulation of the 
operated joints. Thickening of medial aspect of the 
joint was observed in all dogs. Dog # 1 was 
clinically normal 19 months after the extra-articular 
fabello-tibial suture.  
 Signs of degenerative joint disease were 
present in different degrees but in one dog (dog #1) 
at initial presentation. Three dogs had a mild

DISCUSSION 
 
 This study suggests that the use of a 
polyester prosthesis is not a satisfactory replacement 
for the cruciate ligament, as observed by VASSEUR 
et al. (1996) using similar prostheses in a canine 
model. CAMARGO et al. (2001) recently described 
lack of satisfactory results using the same prostheses 
in human patients. 

Succesful management of a ruptured cranial 
cruciate ligament depends upon the re -establishment of 
joint stability. Factors as mechanical properties of the 
graft, the type of graft -bone fixation, isometricity, 
tension applied to the autograft during fixation and 
filling of the intercondylar fossa with osteophytes may 
influence the outcome (COETZEE &amp;amp; LUBBE, 1995; 
FITCH et al., 1995; VASSEUR et al., 1996). Ideally, 
the initial mechanical strenght of the synthetic graft 
should be great enough to maintain an adequate degree 
of stability as peri-articular fibrosis may ultimately 
provide the final stabilization of surgically treated 
stifles. 

Considering the fact that a similar implant 
known as the Leeds-Keio prostheses was not intended to 
be a permanent replacement for the CCL (FUJIKAWA 
&amp;amp; ISEKI, 1991; VASSEUR et al., 1996), it is important 
that the stifle is returned to a relatively stable condition 
while fibrosis of the joint capsule occurs. 

Complete rupture of the Leeds-Keio 
implant in dogs has been attributed to excessive strain 
during joint flexion as a result of incorrect isometric 
placement (VASSEUR et al., 1996). Cruciate 
ligaments have a multi-bundle design so each fiber 
bundle is stressed or relaxed during a particular joint 
movement (ARNOCSKY, 1996). Correct isometric 
placement of the grafts may not be possible because 
the cruciate ligament has a multi-bundle design, 
therefore a ligament substitute would need to have a 
similar design in which each bundle would work 
independently. Also, isometric placement of implants 
implicates that the graft would be under even tension 
at all degrees of joint movement, however, the 
prosthesis used in this study is not constructed as an 
independent collection of bundles, therefore, some 
portion of the implant would be subjected to 
excessive strain during joint motion. 

Other causes for implant failure are 
abrasion of the implants at the margin of the drill 
holes (VASSEUR et al., 1996; CAMARGO et al., 
2001) or filling of the intercondylar fossa with 
osteophytes (FITCH et al., 1995). Notchplasty is 
performed commonly in human patients to minimize 
impingement of the graft during extremes of joint 
motion (VASSEUR &amp;amp; BERRY, 1992). By using an 
over-the-top procedure and not drilling a femoral 
tunnel, as described by VASSEUR et al. (1996), less 
contact of the prosthesis and bone was achieved. 
According to ARNOCSKY (1996) this approach 
would also place the graft as close to the isometric 
condition as possible. In this clinical study, despite 
the fact that neither rounding of the edges of the 
tibial drill holes nor notchplasty were performed, 
results were similar to that described by VASSEUR 
et al. (1996) and CAMARGO et al. (2001) who 
observed complete rupture or fraying of the 
implants. In the two cases where rupture of the 
prostheses was observed, it occurred just proximal to 
the tibial tunnel. Abrasion at the tibial drill holes 
could be implied as the cause for this complication. 
However, excessive cyclic deformation compressing 
the caudal portion of the prosthesis against the tibial 
plateau during flexion could explain the mode of 
failure observed in this study. Beveling of the tibial 
tunnel could have been beneficial in preventing this 
complication. In spite of the small number of clinical 
cases in this study, or experimental situations, at 
what point notchplasties would be beneficial in 
preventing implant failure in the dog is still unclear. 

Signs of progression of degenerative joint 
disease are commom in radiographic studies 
concerning the postoperative evaluation of stifle 
surgery (ELKINS et al., 1991; VASSEUR &amp;amp; BERRY, 
1992; DOVERSPIKE et al., 1993; CHAUVET et al., 
1996; VASSEUR et al., 1996; ROOSTER &amp;amp; Van 
BREE, 1999). Progression of osteophytosis following 
implantation of the polyester prosthesis in dogs 
therefore demonstrates that the technique is not 
adequate in preventing joint instability as observed by 
VASSEUR et al. (1996) and CAMARGO et al. (2001) 
when using a similar prosthesis. 

A positive cranial drawer sign is the most 
important finding in a dog with a ruptured cranial 
cruciate ligament, and immediate evaluation 
following surgery usually reveals a stable joint. 
However, as limb use improves, more weight is put 
on it and the implant becomes more prone to 
deformation, which usually is observed as joint 
laxity at subsequent evaluations following surgical 
treatment. Unsufficiently secure methods of fixation 
of the graft, stretching, fraying or deformation as 
well as complete rupture have been implicated as

causes of increased joint instability in the long-term 
evaluation (AIKEN et al., 1992; COETZEE &amp;amp; 
LUBBE, 1995; VASSEUR et al., 1996).  

Clinical evaluation of gait in dogs might 
present errors, as the mood of the dog, location of 
testing, weather and many other factors can affect 
arthritic pain besides being a subjective evaluation 
of lameness (CHAUVET et al., 1996). Thus, 
improvement in gait, as observed in this study, 
simply demonstrates adaptation from individual 
dogs to the condition where shifting the weight 
could result in a better clinical evaluation, or it 
could represent stability after joint capsule 
tickening, or both. Although dogs in this study 
presented mild cranial drawer instability, crepitus 
and reduced range of motion following surgery, 
limb usage and degree of lameness were considered 
satisfactory, which is consistent with other study 
that showed poor correlation between pre sence of 
degenerative changes and clinical lameness 
(AIKEN et al., 1992). 

Ingrowth of autogenous tissue around the 
synthetic replacement for the cranial cruciate 
ligament has been observed (FUJIKAWA&amp;amp; ISEKI, 
1991; SCHINDHELM et al., 1991). Evaluation of 
tis sue ingrowth was not intended in this clinical 
study, however, as observed by CAMARGO et al. 
(2001) formation of a neoligament around the 
implant was not observed in the two cases that were 
available for macroscopic examination. 

Dog # 1 was treated after rupture of the 
polyester prosthesis by means of a lateral fabello -
tibial suture and did not show any complication after 
the second surgery; however, conclusions cannot be 
made due to the limited number of dogs that 
required a second surgery in the same limb , and 
variability of the care after surgery. 

In conclusion, the polyester prosthesis 
used in this study did not prevent joint instability 
and progression of DJD, and could not be considered 
a satisfactory replacement for the cranial cruciate 
ligament in dogs as simpler techniques present 
comparable results.
