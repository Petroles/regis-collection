ABSTRACT

Mountain rivers are situated in a large portion of  the terrestrial surface, especially in headwaters regions, and have been used for various 
purposes such as recreation, sporting activities, water resources and hydroelectric power generation. However, hydrogeomorphic 
characteristics of  mountain rivers are not fully understood. In this context, the present paper aimed to identify relevant parameters 
for characterizing rivers in these environments based on bibliographical review. It was identified which parameters have been used and 
how they have been used to characterize mountain rivers in distinct classifications. The most cited parameters were channel gradient, 
relation between river width and depth, entrenchment ratio, discharge, sediment transport and grain-size distribution. Also, the current 
situation related to researches in fluvial geomorphology in mountain rivers in Brazil was evaluated, and the strong need of  field survey 
as basis for the best understanding of  mountain fluvial dynamics and characterization was verified.

Keywords: Fluvial characterization; Mountain environment; Hydrogeomorphology.

RESUMO

Rios montanhosos estão presentes em uma grande porção dos territórios do planeta, especialmente nas regiões de cabeceiras, e vêm 
sendo utilizados para diversos fins, tais como recreação e atividades desportivas, mananciais de água e geração de energia hidrelétrica. 
Entretanto, suas características hidrogeomorfológicas ainda não são plenamente conhecidas. Neste contexto, o presente trabalho abordou 
os parâmetros relevantes necessários para caracterização de rios nestes ambientes a partir de revisão bibliográfica, em que se buscou 
avaliar o modo como os rios estavam sendo caracterizados e quais parâmetros hidrogeomorfológicos estavam sendo analisados em 
diferentes classificações. Os parâmetros mais comumente utilizados na caracterização de rios montanhosos são a declividade do canal, 
a relação entre largura e profundidade do rio, o grau de entrincheiramento do canal, a vazão, a carga de sedimentos e a granulometria 
dos sedimentos. Ainda, avaliou-se o cenário brasileiro no que tange a pesquisa em hidrogeomorfologia fluvial em rios montanhosos, 
constatando-se a necessidade de realizar mais atividades em campo para melhor entendimento da dinâmica fluvial montanhosa e 
caracterização fluvial.

Relevant parameters for characterizing mountain rivers: a review

2/13

INTRODUCTION

Mountain environments are presented in a large portion 
of  continents and oceanic islands, being that in South America 
they represent up to 22% of  its territory (BRIDGES, 1990). 
Although there are several classifications to define what is a 
mountain (FAIRBRIGDE, 1968; KING, 1967; BATES; JACKSON, 
1984; PRICE, 1991), it is not yet a consensus if  they should be 
classified by esthetic standards or by morphological parameters 
such as height, altitude or shape. According to Faria (2005), it is 
convenient to classify the mountains by its height which can be 
defined as the vertical distance between their basis and summit, 
and to consider the mountains as the environments whose height 
is more than 300 m.

As reported by Wohl (2010), mountain rivers show typical 
characteristics such as high slope, high oscillation between minimum 
and maximum discharges, high mobility of  bedload sediments, 
countless transitions between sub and supercritical flow, limited 
supply of  fine sediments, large variation in channel geometry 
associated to sediment supply, debris flow occurrences and high 
channel entrenchment ratio. Fryirs et al. (2007) commented that 
in mountain rivers the water and sediment move quickly in the 
catchment, accomplishing hydrogeomorphic processes more 
extremely.

In Brazil, although mountain rivers have been used for 
different purposes (tourism, recreation, hydroelectric energy, etc.), 
there are still a few studies about them and theirs characteristics 
(for example, FARIA; MARQUES, 1998; FARIA, 2000, 2005, 
2014). According to Kobiyama et al. (2006, 2018), the occupation 
and use of  mountain catchments have been intensified. Such 
requests occur exactly where the hydrogeomorphic processes are 
more intense and still less studied.

Therefore, the objective of  the present study was to evaluate 
the relevant parameters for characterizing mountain rivers, as well 
as dealing with their measurement, limitation, difficulties and 
problems. Thus, it was sought to discuss the characterization of  
mountain rivers to the Brazilian community which is still lacking 
in these studies.

RIVER CLASSIFICATIONS

Several authors have been proposing different approaches 
for classifying rivers: (i) channel orders; (ii) process domains, 
where the physical processes occurring in rivers are considered; 
(iii) fluvial channel patterns; (iv) interactions between channel 
and floodplain; (v) mobility and bed material; (vi) channel units; 
(vii) hierarchical classifications; and (viii) statistical classifications. 
The use of  distinct classifications is conditioned basically with 
the analysis purpose, i.e., the degree of  detail and the objective.

Classifications based on channel order (HORTON, 1945; 
STRAHLER, 1957) or on its magnitude (SHREVE, 1966) offer 
few information about channel morphology. However, they 
emphasize the structure of  the drainage network, and describe 
the size and the relative location of  channels in a catchment. 
Wohl (2000) commented that the majority of  mountain rivers do 
not have or have a few tributaries, being normally up to second 
order. However, some rivers in mountain environments in Brazil 

could be up to fourth order, in regions as Serra do Mar, Serra da 
Mantiqueira, Serra do Caparaó and some regions of  Atlantic Forest.

Classifications based on physical processes that occur in 
rivers (SCHUMM, 1977; ROSGEN, 1994; MONTGOMERY; 
BUFFINGTON, 1997, and so on) used to divide them into 
sediments’ production or source, transfer or transport, deposition 
or river response to sediment zones. Montgomery (1999) developed 
the concept of  process domains, i.e., portions of  the fluvial 
network characterized by specific interrelated set of  processes 
and disturbances, channel morphologies and aquatic habitats that 
correspond approximately to sediment production, transport and 
deposition zones. In addition, the rivers classification based on 
the process domains identifies fundamental geomorphic units in 
the landscape that structures the river behavior.

Another way is from pattern analysis of  fluvial channels 
(LANE, 1957; ROSGEN, 1994; BRIERLEY; FRYIRS, 2005) where 
the studies are based on continuity of  determined pattern and deal 
with the factors (sediment size, bedload transport, roughness, width 
and depth of  channels) that change these patterns. The factors 
can be also slope, specific energy, relation between width and 
depth, capacity and competence of  bedload material. Approaches 
derived from Schumm (1977) provide good conceptual models 
that assist to recognize also the channel morphology and their 
responses to disturbances in discharge and sediment supply, and 
include morphologies that are presented in mountain rivers, for 
example, Church (1992, 2006).

The interactions between channels and floodplains 
(STEVENS; SIMONS; RICHARDSON, 1975) aimed to identify 
the controls of  the physical and morphological processes both for 
rivers and plain. They are not associated to mountain rivers once 
their analyses focus on plains. This kind of  classification aims to 
describe long-term process in channels, especially the plain rivers.

When classifying rivers due to sediment mobility and 
bed material (BUFFINGTON, 2012; CHURCH, 2006), they are 
divided according its substrate, if  they are alluvial fans or gravel 
bedload channels. Montgomery et al. (1996) proposed that gravel 
bedload channels occur where the sediments transport capacity 
exceeds their supply, meanwhile alluvial rivers occur where the 
sediment supply corresponds or exceeds the transport capacity. 
Benda (1990) commented that gravel bedload rivers also can 
occur in reaches which had a debris flow occurrence and which 
do not necessarily have fluvial characteristics. Church (2002, 2006) 
presented a refined scale for classifying bedload mobility defined 
in terms of  Shields critical stress, where sediment size, transport 
regime, channel morphology and stability are related. Whiting and 
Bradley (1993) proposed a classification for mobility of  headwaters 
rivers from mechanics equations, considering the potential loss 
of  mass in the adjacent hillslope, the mode of  transport and the 
channel competence for moving the deposited material and if  the 
sediment pulse is deposited in the river or not. This classification 
is particularly attractive, because it is strongly based on processes 
and allows quantifying the disturbance risk to the fluvial system 
and their potential to response to it.

Classifications based on channel units (BISSON et al., 1982; 
MONTGOMERY; BUFFINGTON, 1997; ZIMMERMANN; 
CHURCH, 2001; BUFFINGTON et al., 2002, 2009) evaluate the 
morphological units encountered in reaches such as pools, bars,

steps and riffles. These units also form structures in blocks of  large 
morphological reaches as step-pools, riffle-pools and cascades.

Several studies tried to understand the hydraulics in these 
types of  units as well as their physical and biological characteristics 
in steep channels (e.g., GRANT; SWANSON; WOLMAN, 1990; 
ZIMMERMANN; CHURCH, 2001; HALWAS; CHURCH; 
RICHARDSON, 2005). Since they are characteristics observed in 
small reaches of  the rivers, Montgomery and Buffington (1997) 
commented that these classifications are over detailed for major 
applications in catchment scale and that it causes some difficulties 
to investigate the mechanics of  pluvial processes. However, they 
are extremely important concerning steep rivers (MOIR et al., 
2009), i.e., mountain rivers.

Considering hierarchical classifications (FRISSELL et al., 
1986; BUFFINGTON et al., 2003; CHURCH, 2006), the river 
network can be divided into homogeneous reaches based on 
channel patterns, so that the morphology and channel conditions 
are evaluated in detail at different scales. The analysis is performed 
in catchment level, acting in successive scales of  physical and 
biological conditions, which allows a holistic approach. Historically, 
hierarchical classifications have been developed emphasizing 
mountain rivers (BUFFINGTON; MONTGOMERY, 2013). 
However, the process domains are still not well explained. Figure 1 
shows a scheme of  hierarchical classifications.

Further more, there is a statistical classification 
(THOMPSON et al., 2006) whose main objective is to predict 
morphological channel characteristics from spatial statistics 
for classifying reaches based on distinct bedload topographies. 
In this case it is important to identify spatial patterns that could 
be replicated in channels with similar architectures.

According to Buffington and Montgomery (2013), the use 
of  one classification to the detriment of  another can be related to 

advances in science and regional needs, as well as the purpose or 
philosophy behind classification. Currently, hierarchical classifications 
are in vogue because they approach the need in holistic studies 
covering the whole catchment and also physical and biological 
processes on different scales besides being developed for mountain 
rivers. However, a common mistake that river classifiers take is 
the indiscriminate use of  some processes described by an author 
without appropriate field survey that corroborate these arguments. 
As these hierarchical classifications were established specifically 
for mountain rivers, the present study adopted them.

MOUNTAIN RIVERS

In her book entitled “Mountain Rivers Revisited”, 
Wohl (2010) commented that the most consistent characteristics 
of  mountain rivers may be their high slope. However, the author 
confirmed that this characteristic is strongly related to others such 
as limitation of  channels resistant to erosion and hydraulically 
roughness associated to gravel bedload sediments, highly-turbulent 
flow with large variations between critical and supercritical 
flow, high spatio-temporal variability of  bedload material, high 
longitudinal variation in channel geometry, high entrenchment 
ratio, among others.

Mountain rivers that are present in headwaters regions are 
subject to geomorphic alterations in time and space. According  to 
Sklar and Dietrich (1998), these alterations include process transition 
from hillslope to channel as well as transitions from bedrock to 
gravel bedload or from gravel bedload to sand bedload.

Due to the facts that the river characteristics are not 
continuous in its extension and also that the river shows geomorphic 
alterations in time and space, it is very important to identify the 
places where these characteristics suffer from changes. In other

words, a part of  the river can be considered as mountainous 
meanwhile another as alluvial.

Lin and Oguchi (2009) evaluated longitudinal and 
transversal profiles in rivers over one mountainous catchment, and 
demonstrated that topographic characteristics present different 
levels of  organization between steeper and flatter regions. According 
to them, meanwhile the global gradient of  the catchment is 
determined by the longitudinal inclination, the transversal slope 
plays an important role in less steep areas, which evidences the 
need to evaluate the channel steepness in field.

Ohmori and Shimazu (1994) analyzed different hazard 
types (debris flow, turbidity flow and floods) in mountain rivers 
and their relations with geomorphic parameters. The authors 
reported that these different types can occur in distinct locations 
of  channels, depending upon the channel steepness in a reach.

Buffington and Montgomery (2013) commented that, due 
to the fact that river classifications are extremely qualitative, the 
characterization of  fluvial environments is still quite empirical 
and, thus, measuring mountain rivers remain still a hard task.

Based on an analysis of  different classifications, the most 
commonly used and most useful parameters related to rivers in 
mountain environments are identified (Table 1). The channel 
gradient, width, depth, entrenchment ratio, discharge, sediment 
load and grain size are commonly used regardless of  the type 
of  river classification. Next, these relevant parameters will be 
discussed by considering mountain environments.

RELEVANT PARAMETERS

Channel gradient

As mentioned above, the channel gradient is, probably, 
the most consistent parameter in the mountain rivers analysis 
(WOHL, 2010). It affects hydraulic process of  discharge and 
sediment transport, and is related with other characteristics such 
as occurrence of  channel units and alteration in flow regime.

Moreover, the utilization of  the unique value for channel 
gradient causes to subestimate hydrogeomorphic processes that

occur in headwaters regions and to superstimate the processes 
that occur in floodplains. Therefore, the utilization of  hierarchical 
classifications in different scales for characterizing mountain 
rivers is suggested.

Mountain rivers englobe transitions in channel patterns, i.e., 
the transitions between bedrock and gravel or between gravel and 
sand bed (SKLAR; DIETRICH, 1998). As a sediment transport is 
related to channel gradient, one of  the main proposals is to verify 
its condition where the patterns´ changes occur. Wohl, Vincent and 
Merritts (1993) described in detail channel units characteristics, and 
verified that in the gradients over 0.002 m/m it can be possible 
to observe this kind of  change in morphology. Several studies 
about channel gradient in mountain areas (LENZI, 2001; MAO; 
COMITI; LENZI, 2010; BUCKRELL, 2015) demonstrated that 
the gradient in mountains is usually with magnitude of  cm/m 
meanwhile floodplain environments with magnitude of  cm/km 
(LEFAVOUR; ALSDORF, 2005).

The ways to measure channel gradient depend on the scale 
required in the analysis: river, segment, reach of  channel units 
which are all demonstrated in Figure 1. For a river scale, remote 
sensing and geoprocessing from Digital Elevation Model (DEM) 
with good resolution (for example, 1:50,000) can be used. For a 
segment scale which has its magnitude of  102 m (FRISSELL et al., 
1986), both DEM with appropriated resolution and topographic 
and topobathymetric data can be used.

An analysis of  reach (101 m) and channel units (100 m) requires 
field survey with total station, differential GPS topographical level 
and/or drones in order to obtain topographic and topobathymetric 

data (Figure 2a). According to Arroyo et al. (2010), the utilization 
of  LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) allows obtaining 
information from the terrain with 50-cm resolution. In the case 
of  the step-pool morphology analysis, the gradient value depends 
on the step approach. In other words, different ways to measure 
in field generate different values of  gradient. For example, the 
measurement can be performed from the beginning of  the 
upstream pool to the end of  the downstream pool (?

AD
) or from 

the upstream step to the downstream step (?
BC

) (Figure 3).

Relation between river width and depth

Morphometric parameters as width and depth are 
commonly required for characterizing mountain rivers, especially its 
width/depth relation. According to Rosgen (1994) Classification, 
the value of  this relation must be lower than 12 for river types 
Aa+, A, B, F and G which indicate the mountain rivers in his 
Classification due to channel slope and geometric plain view 
criteria. It should be here mentioned that Rosgen Classification 
does not refers directly to mountain rivers, although the proposal 
index shows similarities that allow them to be classified in the 
previous mentioned classifications.

In general, these parameters are not easily obtained with 
remote sensing techniques. The river width, however, can be 
measured with images from a reasonable number of  pixels, once 
the pixel resolution may cause measurement errors. In mountain 
environments, the grid resolution from an image is very commonly

larger than river’s dimensions, which makes the obtention of  
morphometric parameters from remote sensing techniques 
impossible. In this case, field survey becomes indispensable.

Thus, the obtention of  parameters as width and depth in 
reach scale should be performed by using a total station and a 
measuring tape. In this way, these parameters can be measured 
together with the channel gradient. Hence, the importance of  
hydrometry and topo-bathymetry in field survey increases.

Entrenchment ratio

Entrenchment ratio of  a river indicates how it is excavated 
in the landscape (ROSGEN, 1994), i.e., how the river is limited 
laterally by banks and hillslopes. It is related to vertical contention 
of  rivers, and allows making some inferences about the channel’s 
adjacent area. The entrenchment ratio is determined by the relation 
between flood prone areas and channel width. The flood prone 
area is estimated as the width measured for the river elevation 
corresponding to the double of  maximum river depth for a 
specific cross section.

Therefore, obtaining the entrenchment ratio requires 
knowing the river depth and the flood prone area in the study 
site. These data come from detailed field survey by using total 
station and measuring tapes. In case the mean depth is known and 
a DEM with good resolution is available, the measurement of  the 
flood prone area could be estimated by Geographical Information 
System (GIS) techniques.

Rosgen (1994) showed various examples of  the typical 
entrenchment ratio. Thereby, this parameter can be estimated from 
comparison between typical values showed in Rosgen analysis and 
study site, emphasizing that mountain rivers should be classified 
as Aa+, A, B, F or G. On the other hand, non-mountain rivers 
present high values of  this parameter. It means that they do not 
have significant lateral control of  the margins and banks, allowing 
the large spread of  channel and the connection among rivers, lakes 
and meanders during flood events.

Discharge

It is almost impossible to perform traditional methods 
for measuring discharge in mountain rivers during flood events 
due to its high velocity and sediment mobility (CHEN, 2013). 
In  addition, discharges during floods could change very quickly 
in short time, making it indispensable to perform the measure as 
fast as possible. This temporal variation must be a characteristic 
of  mountain rivers.

In mountain rivers the time of  concentration used to be very 
short, of  magnitude from a few minutes to one hour, which still 
makes it difficult to perform systematical discharge measurements 
for covering all the flood events. Because of  its short time of  
concentration, the floods in mountain rivers are considered as 
flash floods (KOBIYAMA; GOERL, 2007). Furthermore, as the 
response time is very short, the field surveys have been frequently 
combined with extreme rainfalls. This fact also increases difficulty 
in measurements.

Therefore, the use of  ADCP (Acoustic Doppler Current 
Profiler) (Figure 2b) is strongly recommended to measure discharges 
in mountain rivers. This use allows obtaining the relation between 
velocities and areas in a more reliable way than traditional methods 
during flood events. In addition, the use of  ADCP allows performing 
the measurement quickly than traditional methods (GAMARRO, 
2012). However, mountain rivers used to present low depths, 
which can cause some difficulties to perform the measurement. 
Therefore, it is necessary to look for an appropriated transect 
that at least has the minimum depth for the ADCP use and also 
provides a security for the field workers.

It is important to highlight that for non-mountain rivers 
it is not difficult to apply the traditional methods with a propeller 
current meter or ADCP, as described in the technical report of  
large rivers discharge measurements (ANA, 2014). Also, the 
utilization of  satellites images can be used for estimating discharges 
at a cross section of  an alluvial river. LeFavour and Alsdorf  
(2005) demonstrated the possibility to estimate discharges in a 
river belonging to the Amazon region with the remote sensing. 
The authors commented that bathymetry was the unique parameter 

Figure 3. Step-pool sequences with different gradients that can be obtained from the same channel unit.

that could not be obtained by image, however, due to a very large 
river whose other parameters could be estimated, the bathymetry 
could be neglected since the calibration process used a well-known 
river gauge station.

In this way, it is highlighted that water discharge measurements 
in mountain and alluvial rivers are obtained by different ways. 
The present study, therefore, emphasizes that both methods and 
temporal changes are important items in river classification, once 
mountain and alluvial rivers differs consistently in these subjects.

Sediment load

The sediment transport in mountain rivers is one of  the 
parameters that have the most uncertainty in their values. According 
to Brardinoni et al. (2015), the sediment dynamics in mountain 
rivers depends on a series of  complex interactions among river 
discharge, activation of  sediment sources from different types, 
and river morphodynamics.

Sediment load has large uncertainty associated to its 
estimative (BUFFINGTON; MONTGOMERY, 2013), once there 
is a lack of  direct observations in field with appropriate quality 
and quantity that could allow the development of  physically-based 
sediment models (BRARDINONI et al., 2015)

Montgomery et al. (1996) followed the hypothesis of  Gilbert 
(1917) in which gravel bedload rivers occur where the transport 
capacity exceeds the sediment supply, meanwhile alluvial rivers 
occur where the sediment supply corresponds to or exceeds the 
transport capacity. Schumm (1977) commented that the channel 
patterns and their stability are influenced by sediment size and 
transport mode (of  suspension, mixed with bedload, or bedload). 
In  case of  the suspended sediment load, there are several attempts 
to estimate their quantity by using turbidity sensors (SARI; 
CASTRO; KOBIYAMA, 2015; SARI et al., 2016).

In mountain rivers which used to present low suspension 
sediment load, bedload discharge is the main way of  sediment 
transport (MONTGOMERY et al., 1996). According to Merten 
and Minella (2015), in case without a measurement of  bedload 
sediment discharge, it is recommended to use Einsten or Colby 
equations or also a supposition that a certain percentage of  the 
suspension represents the bedload discharge. In Brazil, it is very 
common to consider 10% of  the total sediment transport as 
bedload (CARVALHO et al., 2000). By monitoring a river in 
semi-arid region in Brazil, Cantalice et al. (2013) showed that the 
percentage of  bedload to suspended sediment load varied from 
4 to 12.72%. Although Macedo et al. (2017) investigated the 
bedload transport, their study area was a floodplain area without 
mountain environments.

To understand the sediment dynamics and sediment 
load transport is a fundamental task for classifying rivers as 
mountain rivers or not. However, it is quite difficult to observe the 
transformation from mountain to alluvial river, which needs the 
improvement of  field surveys in mountain environments. Even it 
could be hard and time-consuming, it is necessary to estimate the 
amount of  sediment load. Thus, further the need for the field 
hydrometry just increases.

Sediment size

The spatial and temporal distribution of  the sediments 
can strongly affect the water discharges conditions, the turbulence 
structures and the sediment transport rates (BATHURST, 1987; 
RICKENMANN, 2001; DEY et al., 2011; TSAKIRIS et al., 
2014). Large sediments strongly increases the spatial variability of  
discharge and turbulence intensities in a reach scale (DEY et al., 
2011; OZGOREN et al., 2013).

Due to its great importance in the water flow dynamics 
in rivers, the sediments size distribution should be described in 
order to demonstrate its characteristics as accurately as possible. 
The  sediment size is used, for example, to estimate hydraulic 
characteristics for incipient sediment movement (MAO; LENZI, 
2007). There are some parameters of  interest, as D

, D

50
, D

 and D

90
.

Although exists a diversity in sediment measurement methods 
in rivers (CHURCH; MCLEAN; WOLCOTT, 1987; ISO, 1992; 
RAMOS, 1996), a few papers provide information on bedload 
material sampling in small mountain catchments (BUNTE; ABT, 
2001). In order to describe such size distribution in mountain 
rivers, Bevenger and King (1995) proposed a counting sediment 
procedure, in which the grains are sampled since a cross section 
from bank to bank.

Fang, Liu and Stoesser (2017) commented that large 
sediments are capable to promote changes in the field of  discharges 
and that they may cause flow deacceleration, corridor and vortex 
formation, internal and external turbulence and redistribution of  
shear stress. When large sediments are neglected, these alterations 
as well as sediment transport ratio may be subestimated. In this 
way, the importance of  spatial distribution of  large sediments, 
i.e., the maximum sediment sizes, or D

100
 must be emphasized.

Hence, it is very clear to say the need to perform field 
survey to describe appropriately the sediment size in rivers. Mao, 
Comiti and Lenzi (2010) verified sediment size distribution through 
field survey and evaluated the river competence in an Italian Alps 
catchment. They utilized markers in a widely range of  sediment size 
that allowed them to infer possible discharges capable to transport 
these sediments. Buckrell (2015) evaluated differences in sediment 
size distribution for pools and riffles sequences, and reported that 
they are considerable distinct in sediment size, which requires further 
investigation in situ. In addition, distinct technologies could be 
used for estimating the sediment size, such as the drone images 
processing (MU et al., 2018) or satellite images (CASADO et al., 
2015). Mu et al. (2018) performed machine learning to identify 
morphological characteristics of  the sediments. Although this 
technology has been advancing very rapidly, field survey, i.e., field 
hydrometry, is still necessary for obtaining basic data.

BRAZILIAN SCENARIO

The development and occupation have been increasing 
significantly in Brazilian mountain regions (KOBIYAMA et al., 
2018). According to Hewitt (2004), the growing use of  mountain 
areas has been rising the hazard for hydrologically-extreme events 
due to pressure for development and environmental changes.

Mountain environments have been served as alternative for 
water supply from large rivers that water quality are now deteriorated

8/13

on its quality (PAIXÃO; KOBIYAMA; CAMPAGNOLO, 2017). 
Such situation stimulates public agencies to build up capitation, 
treatment and feed water infrastructure in these regions.

In addition, mountain regions have been increasingly sought 
after and exploited for recreation and ecotourism activities. Data 
from National Parks and Conservation Units Visitors showed 
that, in Federal areas, the total number of  visitors grew from 
3 million in 2007 to more than 8 million in 2016 (IBAMA, 2016). 
An expressive number of  federal conservation areas are located in 
mountain regions, for examples, Aparados da Serra, Serra Geral, 
Chapada dos Guimarães and Itatiaia National Parks.

As exploitation and occupation of  mountain environments 
have been rising in Brazil and the studies referred to these areas 
still are scarce, it is important to incentivize basic studies about 
mountain rivers characterization. Such studies will subsidize the 
comprehension of  the water and sediment dynamics in these 
environments.

Faria (2000) evaluated the influence of  vegetation on 
fluvial processes in first order catchments, highlighted that woody 
debris (tree trunks, branches and leaves) interfere in water flow by 
diverse ways, and commented that the sediment delivery in these 
catchments occurs in pulses when such structures are destroyed. 
Assessing geomorphic responses in fluvial first order channels, 
Faria (2014) reported that sediment transport presents a very 
differentiated dynamics when compared with larger rivers and, 
therefore, the first order channels demand more studies.

By using principal component analysis and cluster analysis, 
Sodré et al. (2007) performed a multivariate analysis for describing 
and classifying morphometric parameters in catchments in Alto 
Jequitaí-MG. The analyzed parameters were altimetry, terrain slope, 
hillslope curvature, contribution area and catchment perimeter. 
The authors segmented catchments according to their similarity 
patterns, evidencing that spatial patterns reflect the similar 
dynamics among them.

Silveira and Ramos (2007) carried out a spatial analysis 
of  environmental parameters and hydrological behavior of  a 
mountain catchment at Serra dos Órgãos-RJ. For this analysis, 
the authors used the Ground Penetration Radar (GPR) to 
evaluate the distribution and transition of  soil horizons in field, 
investigated the sediment size distribution at distinct locations 
in the catchment and used fluviometric data with 30 minutes of  
temporal resolution. The  field survey allowed the determination 
of  landscape development patterns for different lithological units 
in the catchment, indicating factors that act as controllers in the 
relation between rainfall and discharge in this mountain region.

Olszevski et al. (2011) evaluated the morphology and 
the hydrological aspects by using morphometric characteristics 
of  the terrain and the drainage network in order to predict the 
hydrological behavior. Lopes (2012) used topographic attributes 
for trying to establish the relation between topography and 
discharge in the Altíssimo Rio Negro catchment (PR/SC). Such 
attributes were obtained from GIS processing and field survey 
for discharge measurements.

Telles, Rodrigues and Silva Neto (2016) carried out 
automatic calibration of  hydrodynamic simulator by using direct 
and reverse problems, whose objective was to minimize the 
difference between experimental data referred to river level and 

simulated values obtained in the direct problem. The authors utilized 
data with 15 minutes of  temporal resolution, and obtained the 
satisfactory results. However, the authors stated that the results 
could be better in case they had more parameters in the analysis, 
i.e., if  they had more detailed description of  hydrogeomorphic 
processes that occur in mountain environments. One of  the main 
propositions of  Telles, Rodrigues and Silva Neto (2016) was to 
consider the roughness variability along the channel so as to make 
the prediction more realistic to physical characteristics observed 
in terrain. It  indirectly means that reach scale needs to be better 
described for a good representation of  its processes.

Studies related to modeling and water quality have been 
increasing in Brazil. For exemple, Von Sperling (2007) recommended 
the use of  nine parameters (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, 
BOD, thermotolerant coliforms, total nitrogen, total phosphor, 
total solids and turbidity) for evaluating the water quality index.

Girardi et al. (2016) evaluated the changes in water quality 
during rainfall events in the Cubatão do Sul river catchment, in Santa 
Catarina state. In the study were evaluated two sub-catchments, 
being one of  them predominantly mountain environment. 
The temperature, electrical conductivity, turbidity, pH, ammonium 
ion and dissolved oxygen were treated. The authors observed 
that the catchment is influenced by discharges with short return 
periods and the water quality keeps a uniform behavior during 
dry and rainy periods in the mountain sub-catchment which is 
mostly preserved.

Rodrigues et al. (2012) tried to estimate dispersion pollutant 
parameters in mountain rivers by using the Luus-Jaakola algorithm. 
They commented that the dispersion of  pollutants in natural 
streams have been based on classical experiments that consider a 
Gaussian distribution of  one substance concentration, however, 
it is not verified in mountain environments. Thus, when using 
advection-dispersion model, they had good estimative to calculate 
transport of  a conservative substance.

Hence, it is observed that studies on mountain rivers are 
still a few when compared with alluvial rivers and floodplains in 
Brazil. Such situation probably implies that researchers are more 
interested in larger catchments and large rivers because of  the 
hydroelectric energy generation and also because of  the fact that the 
large portions facilitate studies using remote sensing. That is why, 
in order to better understand mountain rivers, Brazilian researches 
should add efforts on field surveys activities, carrying out in situ 
measurements, since mountain rivers have been increasingly used 
by the Brazilian society.

CONCLUSIONS

Due to increasing use of  mountain environments in Brazil, 
it is suggested that river classifications must be performed by 
considering their uses for different purposes.

For characterizing mountain rivers, it is proposed to use 
hierarchical classifications where rivers are evaluated on different 
scales of  analysis (river, segment, reach, channel units, etc.) in order 
to analyze the relevant parameters for its characterization. According 
to Wohl (2010), the most permanent parameter in the analysis of  
mountain rivers is the channel gradient. Thus, in the impossibility 
of  a complete characterization of  a river, channel gradient may

offer subside for preliminary characterization of  mountain rivers. 
It is emphasized that for a complete estimative field observations 
are necessary, which requires financial expenditure and time.

The identification of  the minimum relevant parameters 
needed for characterizing mountain rivers is a demand both for 
scientific community and for Brazil, once this country has been 
intensifying the use and occupation of  mountain environments 
and there is a lack of  studies in such environments. Thus, based 
on the literature review, it was observed that the most utilized 
parameters for characterizing mountain rivers are: channel gradient, 
discharge, relation between river width and depth, entrenchment 
ratio, sediment load, and sediment size.

Although some parameters can be measured with geoprocessing 
techniques, most of  them should be measured in situ. It strongly 
indicates the importance of  performing hydrometry, topography 
and topobathymetry in field survey.
