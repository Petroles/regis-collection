resumo 
 

 

Propõe-se o desenvolvimento de um novo instrumento para medição de fluxos 
de calor convectivos e radiativos, baseado na operação de um radiómetro de 
transpiração em regime transitório. Os radiómetros de transpiração atuais 
baseiam-se em medições de temperatura em regime estacionário num 
elemento poroso atravessado por um caudal mássico gasoso conhecido. 
Como consequência da inércia térmica intrinsecamente elevada do elemento 
sensível poroso, a constante de tempo do instrumento é da ordem dos 
segundos. O instrumento proposto preservará as vantagens estabelecidas dos 
radiómetros de transpiração incorporando características adicionais que 
alargarão a gama de aplicabilidade. As novas características mais importantes 
serão uma redução significativa do tempo de resposta do instrumento e a 
possibilidade de medir separadamente as componentes radiativa e convectiva 
do fluxo de calor. Estes objetivos serão conseguidos através da análise da 
resposta transitória do instrumento, utilizando-se um caudal pulsado de gás 
para induzir o comportamento transitório.

abstract 

 
The development of a new instrument for the measurement of convective and 
radiative is proposed, based on the transient operation of a transpiration 
radiometer. Current transpiration radiometers rely on steady state temperature 
measurements in a porous element crossed by a know gas mass flow. As a 
consequence of the porous sensing element’s intrinsically high thermal inertia, 
the instrument’s time constant is in the order of several seconds. The proposed 
instrument preserves established advantages of transpiration radiometers while 
incorporating additional features that broaden its applicability range. The most 
important developments are a significant reduction of the instrument’s response 
time and the possibility of separating and measuring the convective and 
radiative components of the heat flux. These objectives are achieved through 
the analysis of the instrument’s transient response, a pulsed gas flow being 
used to induce the transient behavior.

CHAPTER 1 

INTRODUCTION 

 

An introduction to the dissertation is provided, stressing its intended 

contribution to the field of heat flux measurement, namely the 

proposition of a new heat flux measurement principle based on a 

transpiration radiometer’s transient response analysis. The relevance of 

heat flux as a thermodynamic design parameter is discussed. The 

thesis’s contribution, objectives and structure are also discussed and its 

integration in a continuous line of development is addressed in order to 

adequately explain the framework in which this work took place. A 

review of the available methods to measure heat flux, along with a 

discussion of their relative merits and major advantages and 

disadvantages, is presented. The contribution of the present work is 

established and discussed by comparison. 

 

1.1 Introduction 

The standard interpretation of heat flux defines it as the energy in transit owing to a 

temperature difference per unit cross-sectional area, normal to the flux direction. 

Although there are no devices that can measure energy and hence heat or heat flux 

directly, the effects of energy in transit can be monitored and the heat flux inferred. 

Heat flux in a thermodynamic system typically varies in both space and time, reflecting 

the state of the system. Knowledge of heat flux properties in a thermodynamic system 

enables its assessment in terms of efficiency, safety and availability, embodying an 

important design, control and diagnostic parameter for most operational thermal 

systems. 

 Heat transfer can occur by means of conduction, convection and radiation, 

either as independent or as combined phenomena. The objective of measuring heat 

transfer is the quantification of the heat flux. In a solid, heat flux will occur due to 

conduction alone, but at a solid/fluid interface (a case of practical significance to 

engineers), the resulting heat transfer will occur owing to at least two of these three 

modes. Most heat flux sensors measure the total heat flux at the interface or surface, 

with important consequences when comparisons are made between experimental results 

and theory or computational fluid dynamics, or correlations of experimental results are 



2 

 

for example used to calibrate a heat flux sensor. The separation of the relative 

contributions of convection and radiation to the total heat flux, often referred to as 

heat flux partitioning, is generally the most troublesome issue. A radiation correction 

can in most cases be easily applied to an experimental configuration, providing the 

surface temperature and radiative properties of the experimental domain are known 

[Childs et al. 1999]. Extensive studies are available regarding applications where heat 

flux partitioning must be carried out [Blanchat et al. 2009]. 

 Radiation heat flux is an especially important parameter as far as high 

temperature applications are concerned, namely in systems such as boilers, furnaces or 

combustion chambers. These systems place severe constraints upon instrumentation 

due to the harsh physical conditions, in the form of high temperatures and various 

aggressive processes that include dust, soot or highly reactive chemical species. Such 

systems are also usually characterized by the occurrence of fouling processes which can 

severely, if not completely, restrict the application of most types of sensors. As much as 

possible, they must therefore be robust, reliable and able to avoid or minimize the 

fouling problem on the sensors themselves. 

Physical methods available for the purpose of heat flux measurement are usually 

based on the monitoring of temperatures. However, while temperature measurements 

are common and well accepted, heat flux measurements are often given lesser 

consideration because they are less intuitive: temperature is one of the fundamental 

properties of a substance and can be determined by human senses, whereas heat flux is 

a derived quantity that is not easily sensed. How and where the thermal energy goes is 

often equally (or more) important than temperature levels. Optimizing the thermal 

energy transfer in many systems is crucial to their performance, rendering sensors that 

can be used to directly sense heat flux extremely important and fully justifying the line 

of work that eventually led to the present work. 

Most methods for measuring heat flux are based on temperature measurements 

on or close to the surface of a solid material, usually involving the insertion of a device 

either onto or into the surface, which can cause both physical and thermal disruptions. 

As a result, good measurements must aim at minimizing the disruption caused by the 

presence of the sensor. It is particularly important to understand the thermal 

disruption caused by the sensor because it cannot be readily visualized and because all 

heat flux sensors have a temperature change associated to the measurement. 

Consequently, a wise selection of the sensor type and operating range is important for 

good heat flux measurements. Of no lesser importance are the reliability and the 

robustness of the sensor, so these factors should also be considered when selecting a 



3 

 

particular instrument, and must guide the development of any new sensor, as described 

here. 

1.2 Framework and Relevance 

The desirability for heat flux measurement techniques and instruments as good as 

possible is rather self evident and is undoubtedly the driving force behind the 

continuing development both in this field and in others related to it, by taking 

advantage of the existing instruments, namely diagnostic and control systems. 

However, in this particular case, another reason was at least as important and 

justifies to some extent some of the approaches and decisions that shaped the overall 

developed work. The present thesis can obviously be taken solely at face value, but it 

takes a somewhat broader significance when looked upon from the wider point of view 

of the whole line of work that eventually led to the present transpiration radiometer 

and that came about through a continuous line of development that can be said to 

have begun in the early 1990s, as detailed below, and that relies on some principles 

proposed in the 1970s. 

 In most studies involving radiometers the output of the instrument has to be 

obtained in steady-state conditions, for which a variety of theoretical models are 

available. However, reliable or accurate steady-state data are usually not enough within 

the framework of advanced diagnostic systems, since for certain measurement 

applications it is also very important to record dynamic characteristics, such as the 

transient response of the instrument. If the results are to be obtained in transient 

conditions, its response time must be considerably shorter. This is one of the main 

driving forces behind the present work. 

The blow-off effect that the transpiration principle implies is central to the desired 

performance of such an instrument. Indeed, besides having a cooling effect on the 

sensing element, the transpiration gas is intended both to keep the sensing element 

clean during operation by deflecting incoming particles and also, just as importantly, to 

enable the separation of the radiative and convective components of the total heat flux. 

This can be achieved bearing in mind that the transpiration gas mass flow rate will 

dictate conditions on the sensing element’s surface exposed to the incoming heat flux. A 

critical transpiration gas mass flow rate will define the following two operating modes: 

• For a transpiration gas mass flow greater than the critical value the external 

stream boundary layer is destroyed and only the radiative component of the 

total heat flux is received by the sensing element; 



4 

 

• For a transpiration gas mass flow smaller than the critical value the boundary 

layer is not destroyed and the sensing element receives both to the radiative 

and the convective components of the total heat flux. This feature enables the 

separate measurement of the convective and radiative components since the 

total heat flux is:  
 

 
tot rad convq q q= + , (1.1) 

 

the radiative heat flux being measured directly and the convective heat flux 

being calculated from the relationship above. 

Even from a purely operational point of view, radiation heat flux measurement 

is arguably the most important part of the problem, since the high temperature levels 

often found in industrial furnaces dramatically reduce the relative importance of 

convective heat flux in overall energy balance analyses. Nevertheless, it cannot be 

ignored since a variety of advanced diagnostic systems rely on total, radiative and 

convective heat fluxes as input parameters [Calisto et al. 2008], although the 

development of radiometers and total heat flux meters has always been stronger than 

the development of selective heat flux sensors for industrial applications. 

As will be discussed further below, transpiration radiometers are interesting for 

situations where other techniques are too complex and expensive to be transferred to 

current industrial applications, mainly due to the high temperature, aggressive 

environments involved. Previous work along these principles was undertaken in the 

early 1970s [Moffat et al. 1971]. The basic principle already was to blow air through a 

porous plug (essentially a porous disk mounted on a cylindrical water-cooled copper 

body) which composed the exposed surface of the gauge.  

The air flow had several purposes, the most important of which was to literally 

blow-off any fluid boundary layer from the surface of the gauge if the flow was 

sufficiently high, resulting in the elimination of convection. Secondly, the flow provided 

the temperature difference measured by the gauge, the output signal being proportional 

to the difference between porous disk and inlet air temperatures. The output signal was 

monitored by a differential thermocouple, one of the junctions being attached to the 

back face of the porous disk (on its axis) and the junction set in the transpiration gas 

stream just behind the disk. The thermal radiation flux was proportional to the signal 

obtained with the differential thermocouple, i.e., to the temperature difference between 

the porous medium and the transpiration stream. The porous disk temperature was 

itself a function of the flow rate and specific heat of the air, as well as of the net 

radiation heat flux to the disk. The balance between gas cooling and radiation heating 



5 

 

determined the disk temperature, although a calibration procedure was necessary to 

establish the efficiency of the heat transfer process between the gas and the disk. A 

second thermocouple could be attached to the disk edge, allowing the use of the 

instrument as a Gardon gauge if the gas stream was switched off.  

Gardon or circular foil gauges were among the first heat flux gauges originally 

developed to measure thermal radiation flux [Gardon 1953], with their applicability 

later extended to convection measurements [Gardon 1960]. The Gardon gauge (also 

known as the asymptotic calorimeter) consists of a hollow cylinder of one material 

(which acts as a heat sink) with a thin foil of a second material attached to one end. 

The radial temperature difference between the centre of the disc and its edge is a 

function of the heat flux to the disk and of the radial temperature profile. 

More closely related to the work discussed here was a similar but slightly 

different radiometer for operation in high-ash boilers [Brajuskovic and Afgan 1991, 

Brajuskovic et al. 1991]. Basic differences were the fact that instead of going through 

the plug, the air was directed through slots around a solid plug, and the sensing 

element was replaced by a Gardon-type heat flux sensor. Indeed, the air flow kept the 

ash particles from reaching the heat flux gauge and took away the thermal energy as in 

other transpiration gauges, and heat transfer was radial trough the plug as in a circular 

foil gauge. The heat flux was proportional to the temperature difference measured 

between the centre and the edge of the plug. Due to their theoretical ability to perform 

heat flux partitioning and to evaluate deposit thicknesses, these radiometers had the 

potential to serve as a basis of online furnace and boiler diagnostic systems. 

Besides these developments albeit not entirely separate from them, a particular 

line of development led directly to the work described here. It relied on the same 

principle of blowing off the convective component of the total heat flux, reverting to 

the option of having gas crossing the sensitive element [Afgan and Leontiev 1995]. This 

instrument used a thick (namely when compared with Gardon foils) porous disk as 

sensing element, replacing the thin net used in earlier instruments. The thicker porous 

disc had the advantage of collecting the totality of the thermal radiation incident on 

the surface, no thermal radiation escaping to the inner side of the gauge body due to 

the non-existent transmissivity of the porous element. In addition, the temperature 

measurements were made at the front and back surfaces of the porous disk, enabling 

the determination of the incoming radiation by an energy balance to the porous disk.  

The work described here can be said to be in direct continuity from further 

development of this configuration, namely by the supervisor of this thesis as part of his 

own PhD, during the course of which a fully operational transpiration heat flux meter 



6 

 

was developed, built and tested in industrial conditions [Martins 1998], its formulation, 

specifications and performance being discussed in associated publications [Martins et al. 

1998, Martins et al. 2000]. Any of these references makes clear that a rugged and 

reliable radiometer was obtained, these qualities being extensively proved in full-scale 

tests carried out in a thermoelectric coal-burning facility. Fouling was indeed shown to 

be avoided thanks to the transpiration air flow. However, somewhat large response 

times (up to 5 s) were observed.  

While being perfectly adequate for a wide range of applications, namely those in 

which the instrument was tested, the integration of such an instrument in equipment or 

systems that exhibit strongly time-dependant behaviours could be hindered by such 

comparatively high response times. The instrument was also rather bulky, especially 

due to the necessary water refrigeration system, which could also render it less 

attractive for some applications. Hardware such as gas turbines (especially for 

propulsion applications) readily comes to mind as examples of systems that require 

fast-response instruments, due to the sheer speed at which it operates and which in 

turn renders slow-responding sensors inappropriate while having restrictions regarding 

the bulk and weight of all subsystems, including sensors. 

The application range of that version of the instrument was subsequently shown 

to be potentially extended in order to effectively perform heat flux partitioning (which 

other work suggested by failed to effectively implement) and to obtain a faster response 

version using a transient operational mode. The path towards these conclusions was 

similar, since a MSc dissertation was first presented [Hit 2004], having the same 

supervisor as the one presented here, followed by subsequent publications [Martins et 

al. 2006a, Martins et al. 2006b], potential applications in diagnostic systems also being 

discussed [Calisto et al. 2008]. 

1.3 Heat Flux Measurement: Literature Review 

As mentioned earlier, temperature measurements are common and well accepted but 

heat flux measurements are often given lesser consideration because they are less 

intuitive. Consequently, sensors that can be used to directly sense heat flux can be 

extremely important and the present chapter is essentially devoted to the review and 

discussion of available techniques for thermal radiation and convection flux 

measurements.  If radiation and convection are to be measured separately in situations 

where both occur simultaneously (arguably the majority of applications), some form of 

heat flux partitioning must be performed. 



7 

 

There is a large variety of available heat flux measurement techniques, which can be 

arranged into several categories. One such possible classification broadly divides these 

techniques into the following four categories: 

• Spatial temperature gradient techniques – the heat flux across a spatial 

distance can be determined by measuring temperatures at discrete locations and 

relating to the temperature gradient and the material properties; 

• Temporal temperature change techniques – a heat balance is applied to a 

particular region of the sensor and the temporal measurement of a temperature 

is related to the heat flux; 

• Energy supply or removal techniques – a heater or cooler is used to supply or 

remove energy from a system and a heat balance used to relate the temperature 

measured to the heat flux; 

• Mass transfer analogy techniques – measuring mass transfer instead of heat 

transfer and using an analogy to infer heat transfer. 

Due to the often conflicting requirements for sensitivity, robustness, size and cost, 

any given single heat flux measurement technique is hardly suitable for all applications, 

the trend being indeed for increased diversity. 

As mentioned above, temperature measurements are paramount in most heat flux 

measurement techniques. A large number of journal articles and chapters in 

instrumentation books have been written over the years reviewing available heat flux 

measurement techniques. Some well-established references (in the sense that they have 

been widely cited) cover general principles [Goldstein 1970, Kostkowski and Burns 

1970, Baker and Ryder 1975, Eckert and Goldstein 1976, Thompson and Emrich 1981, 

Atkinson et al. 1983, Goldstein and Chiang 1985, Childs et al. 1999] while others focus 

on specific methods or specific applications, ranging from radiation measurements 

[Edwards 1970], transient techniques [Scott 1970], high-temperature measurements in 

gases [Grey 1970], high-speed aerodynamics [Grey 1970, Neumann et al. 1988, Neumann 

1989], combustion applications [Butler et al. 1994, Arai et al. 1996, Chander and Ray 

2005] to fluidised bed reactors [Saxena et al. 1989] and power engineering machines and 

installations [Jaremkiewicz et al. 2009]. An extensive review covering a wide spectrum 

of methods, with particular emphasis to those oriented to convective heat flux 

measurement, is available [Diller et al. 1993], along with more recent and equally wide-

ranging references to which the present review is also indebted [Moffat 1988, Moffat 

1990, Moffat 1998, Childs et al. 1999]. 



8 

 

One unifying factor is that most methods require accurate temperature 

measurements to be made somewhere as the key to good heat transfer measurements. 

Many well-established and often cited books and articles have been written covering 

different aspects of temperature measurement [Baker and Ryder 1975, Eckert and 

Goldstein 1976, McGee 1988, Childs et al. 2000], while others cover specific aspects 

such as very high temperature measurements [Neuer et al. 2001]. 

1.3.1 Spatial Temperature Gradient Techniques 

Differential Layer and Planar Thermal Gradient Devices 

The simplest heat flux sensor is the so-called layered gauge, consisting of a layer of a 

material with known thermal conductivity and well-defined thickness, together with 

two temperature measurement devices located on two opposite faces of the gauge. The 

gauge is designed so that the heat flux is one-dimensional in the direction defined by 

the two thermocouples. By measuring the temperature difference under these 

conditions, all the data required to determine the heat flux are available. Actually, 

under these specific conditions, Fourier’s law can be written as follows, where all the 

quantities are known with the exception of the heat flux and the temperature 

distribution is linear:

where T1 and T2 are measured temperatures, x1 and x2 are measurement locations 

resulting in sensor thickness L, which along with thermal conductivity k are not usually 

known with sufficient accuracy for any particular sensor to avoid direct calibration of 

each sensor. The heat transfer rate (in W) is 
''

x x
q Aq=  is and A is the heat transfer 

area. An adhesive layer may also be required between the sensor and surface to 

securely attach the sensor, which adds an additional thermal resistance and increases 

the thermal disruption. Temperature measurements on the sensor and on the 

surrounding undisturbed material are recommended to quantify this disruption. A 

detailed analysis of the performance of this gauge was presented by [Hager 1965]. 

Similar gauges were later proposed taking advantage from the development of materials 

science and new production technologies [Godefroy et al. 1990, Hager et al. 1991]. 

The selection of a temperature-measuring technique for determining the 

difference in temperature depends on the need to provide reasonable sensitivity and 

signal output for the range of heat flux under consideration. The temperature difference 

can be measured by a variety of methods, most commonly by means of thermocouples. 



9 

 

These have the advantage of generating their own voltage output, which is a function 

of the temperature difference between their two junctions. They can thus be connected 

in series to form a thermopile that amplifies the output from a given temperature 

difference, the voltage output E being: 

 

 
T

E NS T= ? , (1.3) 
 

where N is the number of thermocouple junction pairs and ST is the Seebeck coefficient 

or thermoelectric sensitivity of the junction, calculated as the absolute value of the 

difference between the Seebeck coefficient of each metal and usually expressed in volts 

per degree centigrade. The corresponding sensitivity of the heat flux sensor is: 

 

 T

Although sensitivity is determined in practice from a direct calibration, the last 

member of the previous equation can be used to determine the effects of different 

parameters for design purposes. The transient response is a function of the separation 

distance and the material’s thermal diffusivity ?. A one-dimensional analysis gave the 

time required for a 98% response as [Hager 1965]: 

 

 
21.5L

t
?

= .  (1.5) 

 

From the equations above it can be seen that while sensitivity increases with 

junction separation L, the time response increases proportionally to the square of this 

distance. The use of a thicker layer and/or a lower thermal conductivity material 

increases the gauge sensitivity since a relatively large temperature difference is 

obtained, leading to lower heat flux levels. However, these design options also increase 

the thermal inertia of the gauge and consequently its time response, one of the major 

drawbacks in the design of these gauges. It should be noted that the temperature 

difference can be determined by means of thermometers, thermistors, or resistance 

temperature devices (RTDs), as well as by thermal radiation-based devices and optical 

methods, besides thermocouples and thermopiles. Thermocouple-based measurement is 

well known [Heitor and Moreira 1993], but research continues regarding better signal 

processing procedures, especially in transient measurements [Frankel et al. 2008]. The 

possibility of using intrinsic thermocouples rather than standard soldered ones [Genix et 



10 

 

al. 2009] or the use of non-standard semiconductor thermoelectric modules, as opposed 

to conventional thermocouples [Ploteau et al. 2007], is also being pursued. 

One of the first reported heat flux sensors made use of this technique, with 

thermometers placed on either side of a cork floor to determine the heat loss in a food 

processing plant [Hencky 1915]. Some forms of thermopile sensors have found 

widespread application, leading to commercial production, and several are listed below 

as examples. There is a variety of gauge configurations, with the basic configuration 

illustrated in Figure 1.1. The most simple is merely a thermal resistance layer, to which 

a thermopile with several hundred junctions is fitted over areas in the range of some 

hundred square centimetres, with the possibility of using flexible material, such as 

mylar or kapton in order to allow for some surface conformability. Gauges made with 

these materials lead to uses at relatively low temperatures (around 500°C) and 

convection heat transfer studies [van Dorth et al. 1983], although applications such as 

fluidised bed combustion chambers [Kumada et al. 1990] and fouling in combustion 

chambers [Marner et al. 1989] have been reported. The major limitations of this 

technique, when thermal radiation has to be measured in high temperature harsh 

environments, are the problems related with the control of the gauge temperature, the 

cleanness of the sensing element and the separation of the convection component of the 

total heat flux. 

 

 

 

Figure 1.1 - Basic layered gauge principle and thermopile for differential temperature 

measurement [Diller et al. 1993]. 

 

Another successful, widespread and commercially available design using a 

thermopile consists of thin pieces of two types of metal foil, alternately wrapped around 

a thin plastic (once again kapton) sheet and welded on either side to form 

thermocouple junctions, as illustrated in Figure 1.2 [Ortolano and Hines 1983], with a 

separate thermocouple included to provide a measure of the sensor temperature. Such 



11 

 

sensors are typically limited to measuring temperatures below 250°C and heat fluxes 

lower than 100 kWm-2, with response times of approximately 20 ms. Sensors with 

higher sensitivity are made with semiconductor thermocouple materials for geothermal 

applications, with operating temperatures of up to 1250°C. 

 

 

Figure 1.2 - Thermopile heat flux sensor [Ortolano and Hines 1983]. 

 

Different manufacturing techniques (namely thin-film sputtering techniques) 

result in very thin sensors with low physical and thermal disruption, which when used 

together with (and for which the use of) high-temperature thermocouples, allow 

operating temperatures to exceed 800°C, being best suited for heat flux values above   

1 kWm-2, with no practical upper limit. The sensor’s thinness allows the thermal 

response time to be less than 10 µs, giving a good frequency response, often well above 

1 kHz [Hager et al. 1993, Holmberg and Diller 1995]. A similar sensor design makes use 

of screen printing techniques of conductive inks and a large number of thermocouple 

pairs (up to 10,000), yielding sufficiently high sensitivities to measure heat fluxes as low 

as 0.1 Wm-2, thermal time constants of about 1 s and upper temperature limits of 

approximately 150°C [Terrel 1996]. Sensitivities better than 40 mVW-1cm-2 have been 

obtained with similar sensors [Langley et al. 1999], the trend being towards more 

sensitive sensors with micromachined components [Escriba et al. 2005]. 

Another common technique for measuring the temperature difference across the 

thermal resistance layer is to wrap wire and then plate one side of it with a different 

metal (usually wire with copper plating), resulting in a wire-wound sensor looking 

similar to the sensor shown in Figure 1.2. The difference is that the constantan wire is 

continuous all around the sensor, so it does not form discrete thermocouple junctions. 



12 

 

Nonetheless, a high sensitivity can be achieved because of the hundreds of windings on 

the sensors, although at the expense of limited temperatures (up to about 150°C) and 

large time constants of around 1 s [van der Graaf 1989]. Plated sensors using ceramic 

units are available for operation temperatures above 1000°C. 

A very popular version of plated wire sensors uses a small anodized piece of 

aluminium inserted into a water-cooled circular housing, commonly known as the 

Schmidt-Boelter gauge, illustrated in Figure 1.3 [Kidd and Nelson 1995], available in 

sizes as small as 1.5 mm diameter which render them highly attractive for aerodynamic 

testing applications [Neumann 1989]. There is also some ability to contour the surface 

of the sensor to match a curved model surface for complex shapes. Care must be taken 

when measuring low heat fluxes with Schmidt-Boelter gauges, although limitations and 

error avoidance methodologies are well understood [Robertson and Ohlemiller 1995]. 

A variation on the differential thermopile heat flux sensor concept relies on the 

thermal gradient being artificially created by a temperature differential on the surface 

plane of the component. This can be achieved, for example, by using alternate layers of 

materials of different thermal conductivities or different thicknesses, or by exposing one 

half of the thermopile junctions to the convective boundary condition fluid [Godefroy et 

al. 1990]. Typically using several hundred thermocouple pairs and aluminium 

nitride/silicon monoxide vacuum-deposited differential layers, the substantial difference 

in the thermal conductivity of the two thermal resistance layers generates a sufficiently 

large thermal gradient in the plane of the thermopile for sensitive measurements. 

 

Figure 1.3 – Schmidt-Boelter gauge [Hukseflux 2009].

Gardon gauges 

The circular foil gauge was one of the first heat flux gauges originally developed to 

measure thermal radiation fluxes [Gardon 1953], with its applicability later extended to 

convection measurements [Gardon 1960]. The Gardon gauge (also known as the 

asymptotic calorimeter) consists of a hollow cylinder of one material (which acts as a 

heat sink) with a thin foil of a second material attached to one end. The radial 

temperature difference between the centre of the disc and its edge is a function of the 

heat flux to the disk and of the radial temperature profile, measured by means of a 

thermocouple formed by the junction of a thermoelectrically dissimilar wire connected 

to the centre of the disc, usually a copper wire connected to a Constantan disc, itself 

resting on a copper cylinder as illustrated in Figure 1.4. Each gauge must thus be 

calibrated in order to take into account all the parameters influencing the temperature 

profile, e.g., heat losses through the thermocouple wires and variable thermal properties 

of the disk. 

For a uniform heat flux, typical of incoming radiation, the centre to edge 

temperature difference is proportional to the heat flux (neglecting heat losses down the 

centre wire and assuming that thermal conductivity is constant with temperature), that 

is:

where L is the foil thickness and r the active radius of the foil. The output voltage is 

proportional to the product of the temperature and the thermoelectric sensitivity of the 

differential thermocouple. The gauge’s time response was demonstrated to be [Gardon 

1953, Gardon 1960]:

where ? is the material’s thermal diffusivity. 



14 

 

 

Figure 1.4 – Basic Gardon gauge configuration [Diller, James et al. 1993]. 

 

Particular care is required when convection heat fluxes are measured. It has 

been shown both analytically and experimentally that the output is incorrect for 

convective heat transfer because of the distortion of the foil’s temperature profile from 

the assumed radially symmetric, parabolic profile of radiation [Kuo and Kulkarni 1991]. 

Since the amount of error is a function of the gauge geometry, the fluid flow and the 

heat transfer coefficient, it is difficult to reliably correct. This renders the calibration 

curves, obtained by means of a thermal radiation heat source, inadequate for 

convection heat flux measurements, so that correction factors must be considered 

[Diller et al. 1993]. Consequently, great care must be taken to keep the temperature 

difference across the gauge small if Gardon gauges are used to measure convective heat 

transfer. The basic Gardon-type gauges have been widely used over time, namely with 

improved calibration procedures [Ballestrín et al. 2006], with recent versions making 

use of micromachining technologies [Oh et al. 2006]. 

For high temperature and high heat flux operation, some problems have also 

been reported [Young et al. 1984, Englund and Seasholtz 1988, Neumann et al. 1988]. 

In situations such as combustors, water cooling is usually supplied through the body of 

the sensor to keep the temperature from exceeding material limits. Due to the resulting 

temperature mismatch between the gauge and surrounding material in which it is 

mounted, a water-cooled gauge is not recommended for convection heat transfer 

measurements. It is also important for a water-cooled gauge to ensure that 

condensation does not occur on the sensor face. Despite the aforementioned limitations, 

successful high-temperature measurements have been reported using circular foil gauges 

[Thibault and Hoffman 1979, Shepherd 1985].  

Although most heat flux sensors are designed to measure the total heat flux, 

sensors have been developed to separate convection from radiation (as discussed in 

further detail below). The most common method is to put a transparent window over 



15 

 

the sensor to eliminate convection to the sensor face. Once the resulting sensor only 

measures radiation, it is termed a radiometer. The field of view can however be limited 

in these radiometers and must be included in the interpretation of results. In a dirty 

environment where the transmission of the window could be degraded, air is usually 

blown across the face of the window to keep particles away from the sensor. 

Gardon gauges have been reported in use for fire spread experiments in the 

field, measuring both total and radiant heat fluxes emitted from the flame front, a 

sapphire window attachment being added to the radiant heat flux transducer to 

eliminate convective heat transfer [Silvani and Morandini 2009], with the usual caveats 

regarding mixed convective-radiative experiments, which have been widely studied 

[Kuo and Kulkarni 1991], still applying. As with Schmidt-Boelter gauges, care must be 

taken when measuring low heat fluxes [Robertson and Ohlemiller 1995]. Both types of 

gauges are also used as components in hybrid heat flux measurement systems such as 

the so-called plate thermometer [Ingason and Wickström 2007]. 

Refractive index methods 

A temperature gradient across a transparent medium will cause a local variation in its 

refractive index. This physical phenomenon can be measured by a number of optical 

techniques such as schlieren photography, shadowgraph and interferometry. The 

sensitivity of each method is different, with the schlieren and shadowgraph techniques 

being appropriate for large thermal gradient applications and interferometry for 

applications where the thermal gradient is less severe as in, for example, natural 

convection [Goldstein 1970]. 

1.3.2 Temporal Temperature Change Techniques 

The basic heat transfer equations can describe the relationship between temperature 

gradients and surface heat transfer. If the wall material thermal properties are known 

along with sufficient detail about the temperature history and distribution, heat 

transfer can be determined as a function of time, after some manipulation, at a location 

near to or on the surface of interest. Two general types of solutions are used to reduce 

the temperature history to heat flux. These are commonly designated as the semi-

infinite solution and calorimeter methods. Usually involved are surface temperature 

measurements using thermocouples or RTDs and optical methods that allow for 

simultaneous measurement of temperatures over the entire surface. All require 

substantial effort from the user to initiate the test procedure and reduce the data to 

find heat flux.  



16 

 

A number of techniques are based on these principles, including slug 

calorimeters, plug gauges, null point calorimeters, coaxial thermocouple gauges, thin-

skin and thin-film sensors, and surface temperature monitoring of the whole 

component. 

An important technique for short-duration heat flux tests is to measure the 

surface temperature history on a test object with a fast-response temperature sensor. 

For sufficiently short times and a sufficiently thick material, heat transfer can be 

assumed to be one-dimensional and thermal effects considered not to reach the back 

surface of the material. The temporal temperature variation

where Ti is the uniform initial temperature of the substrate and Ts is the surface

can be performed by several methods, the simplest of which makes use of the analytical 

solution with each sampled data point to recreate the heat flux signal. The most 

popular equation for this conversion for uniformly sampled data (i.e. uniform time 

steps) for any time tn is [Cook and Felderman 1966]:

Modifications are also available to provide higher solution stability [Diller and 

Kidd 1997], as well as numerical solutions to account for changes in property values 

with varying temperatures [George et al. 1991]. Due to the noise amplification inherent 

in the conversion from temperature to heat flux, analogue methods have been 



17 

 

developed to electronically convert the temperature signal before digitizing the signal 

[Schultz and Jones 1973]. 

Slug calorimeters, plug gauges and null point calorimeters 

A typical slug calorimeter comprises a quantity or ‘slug’ of material, thermally 

insulated from its surroundings, as illustrated in Figure 1.5. A single temperature 

measurement at the base of the slug is made and is assumed to represent the 

temperature of the entire slug mass m, this assumption being valid within a few per 

cent if the Biot number, Bi = hL/k, is lower than 0.1, with k and h being the 

conduction and convection heat transfer coefficients, respectively, and L the depth of 

the slug. This condition is essentially a classic lumped mass approximation in which the 

temperature throughout the sensor is assumed to be uniform while changing with time. 

 

 

Figure 1.5 – Slug calorimeter [Diller et al. 1993]. 

 

When exposed to a fluid at a temperature Tf and heat transfer coefficient h over 

an active area A, the solution for the temperature change is the following exponential

The time constant can be derived from the temperature response of the system, 

which can then be used to quantify the heat transfer coefficient h. Although these 

calorimeters are simple in principle, it is often difficult to obtain reliable results because 

of heat losses and non-uniform temperatures. If more accurate results are required, the 

losses through the insulation layer should be modelled and accounted for by a 

correction term [Diller et al. 1993]:

where ?T is the temperature difference between the slug calorimeter and the 

surrounding material. This can be taken as the rise in temperature of the slug, 

assuming that the surrounding material temperature remains constant for the duration 

of the data acquisition. The constant Kloss for a given sensor can be determined by 

calibration and supplied by a laboratory or manufacturer. Slug calorimeters are 

normally used when the energy input to the surface is fairly constant. They can only 

produce useful data for short exposures; the duration of use is limited because T will 

approach T? and they must be restored to an initial condition before reuse. It is 

recommended that a period defined by t = L2/2? be allowed prior to logging of data 

[ASTM 1988a]. Severe disadvantages of this form of device, particularly when 

measuring large heat fluxes, are the disruption to the thermal boundary layer owing to 

the thermal discontinuities introduced by the sensor material boundaries and the 

difficulty of quantifying the heat losses through the insulation layer. It is recommended 

that the slug itself is manufactured with the same material as the surroundings in order 

to ensure minimization of non-uniform temperature effects. Despite the aforementioned 

limitations in terms of experiment time limitations the development of slug calorimeter-

based system continues, including as part of calibration facilities and flammability and 

fire safety studies [Filipczak and Lyon 2002, Filipczak et al. 2005]. 

The plug gauge is a development of the slug calorimeter [Liebert 1994], 

comprising a slug instrumented with multiple thermocouples to provide the 

temperature distribution. An annulus is created on the backside of the surface, four 

thermocouples being attached along the remaining plug to estimate both the 

temperature gradient and the change in thermal energy content in the plug. This setup 

gives a better estimate of the heat flux than the slug calorimeter. An additional 

advantage is that the measurement surface is physically undisturbed. 



19 

 

Null-point calorimeters are a further extension of the slug calorimeter principle, 

developed to improve plug gauge response times [ASTM 1988b]. They are designed for 

the measurement of extremely high heat flux levels (over 1000 kWm-2). In order to 

protect the thermocouple and wires, these are mounted in a cavity behind the surface, 

the temperature measurement location being placed closer to the surface. The heat flux 

measurement is based on a one-dimensional transient conduction solution and is given, 

as for a semi-infinite geometry, by Equation 1.10. In order to eliminate the effects of 

the initial temperature transient on the indicated heat flux, a value of 1.375 is 

recommended for the ratio of hole diameter to the thermocouple distance from the 

surface, b [Kidd 1990b]. Measurements can be taken until the thermal transient reaches 

the back of the sensor at depth L, the useful period of measurement being bounded by: 

 

 
2 23 0.3b L

t
? ?

&amp;lt;&amp;lt;.  (1.14) 

 

The term on the right-hand side of the above inequality is associated with an 

error in the semi-infinite approximation of less than 1% [Kidd 1990b]. 

Coaxial thermocouple gauges 

The principle of the coaxial gauge is to measure the variation in surface temperature 

directly as a function of time. A thermocouple is formed by a concentric arrangement 

consisting of a central thermocouple material which is electrically isolated from the 

outer thermocouple material by an insulating sheath. The thermocouple circuit is 

completed at the surface by applying a thin layer of one of the thermocouple materials 

by, for example, vacuum deposition. Alternatively, the thermocouple circuit can be 

completed by removing the insulation at the tip and soldering or merging the two 

metals together. The heat flux can be determined from the temporal temperature 

measurement as for null-point calorimeters. Average coaxial thermocouple material 

properties can be used for the material properties product, ?cpk [Garcia and de Schor 

1990, Kidd 1990a]. Response times are typically 1 ms or less which, although slower 

than the thin-film sensors, are sufficient for a wide range of applications [Neumann 

1989]. 

 



20 

 

Thin-skin and thin-film devices 

This method has been used to study heat transfer in, for example, spacecraft or nuclear 

warhead re-entry vehicles. In these studies, part of the surface of a model or component 

is removed and replaced with a thin layer or ‘skin’ of a highly conductive material such 

as copper, which forms the slug calorimeter [Schultz and Jones 1973]. 

The assumption in the analysis is that the rate of temperature rise at the rear 

surface, which can be monitored with thermocouples, is equal to the rate of rise in the 

mean temperature. Lateral conduction along the skin is ignored. Heat loss from the rear 

of the skin is assumed to be negligible due to the presence of insulation. Air, which has 

a relatively low thermal conductivity, can be used for this purpose. Because of advances 

in thin-film and optical surface temperature measurement, the thin-skin method is 

considered outdated for most modern aerodynamic testing [Neumann 1989], but is in 

much use for thermal conductivity measurements [Lourenço et al. 2000]. 

Thin-film sensors are physically small devices applied to the surface of interest 

and exhibit fast response to thermal conditions because of their small size, as illustrated 

in Figure 1.6. 

 

Figure 1.6 - Basic thin film sensor configuration [Diller et al. 1993]. 

 

A metallic resistance layer is sputtered, painted and baked, or plated onto the 

surface. Because the resulting thickness of the sensor is less than 0.1 µm the response 

time is a fraction of 1 µs and there should be no physical or thermal disruption of the 

measured temperature due to the sensor. The method is used for basic measurements 

applicable to gas turbine engines, rockets, internal combustion engines and high-speed 

aerodynamics [Diller et al. 1993]. In addition to surface temperature measurement 



21 

 

(single-layer sensors), thin-film sensors can also be used to measure heat flux in layered 

or composite assemblies. 

Sensors of this type were traditionally obtained by vacuum depositing or 

painting, and sintering on to platinum resistance thermometers an electrically 

insulating surface, with lead wires obtained in similar fashion. It is not always 

practicable to manufacture components of an insulating material that will allow the 

application of thin-film surface sensors for heat transfer studies. One technique to 

overcome this limitation involves the application of sensors to a polyamide film. An 

alternative development for use in aggressive environments, such as turbomachinery 

research, involves the application of vitreous enamel to a component for electrical 

isolation of the surface sensors [Doorly 1988]. 

Most thin films produced by a wide variety of methods, either physical or 

chemical (PVD, CVD, sputtering, etc.) for temperature sensor applications, can be used 

only in very narrow ranges of temperatures, where their components are not subjected 

to differential thermal expansions, recrystallizations, and grain size modifications 

[Lourenço et al. 1998]. 

Thin-film sensors have also been combined in a hybrid instrument for solar 

radiation measurements which relies on them for direct heat flux measurements, which 

are compared and satisfactorily corroborated by an indirect system, consisting of a 

CCD camera that uses a water-cooled heat flux sensor as a reference for converting 

gray-scale levels into heat flux values [Ballestrín and Monterreal 2004]. 

Optical surface monitoring 

Optical methods allow the measurement of the entire temperature field over a section 

of the surface, with a large amount of data being collected but requiring a more 

challenging interpretation of data to obtain quantitative heat flux values than with 

measurements systems that use point sensors.  

The most widespread optical temperature measurement method is the use of 

liquid crystals to record colour change. Of particular relevance to heat transfer studies 

are the cholesteric (or chiral-nematic) liquid crystals which react to changes in 

temperature and shear stress by changing colour. These are popularly named 



22 

 

thermochromic liquid crystals. The thermal response of crystals, which is dependent on 

their viscosity, ranges from 5 ms to a few seconds [Ireland and Jones 1987]. They 

degrade when exposed to ultraviolet light and are prone to chemical contamination. As 

a consequence, crystals are encapsulated in polymer spheres, forming a water-based 

slurry that can be painted or applied with an airbrush to the surface of interest for use 

over temperature ranges from 5 to 150°C. Setting the lighting for reproducible colour, 

temperature calibration, image acquisition, and accurately establishing the starting 

temperature are crucial steps, detailed procedures for accurate measurements having 

been established [Baughn 1995, Camci 1996, Alekseev 1997]. A complete system 

typically includes a high-quality video camera, lighting system, calibration system, 

computer hardware and software for image processing and a liquid crystal kit. 

Although the basic materials are cheap, the associated equipment is expensive. 

The colours can be recorded by means of a video camera and can be stored in 

terms of the primary colours: red, green and blue. The frames can later be digitally 

analysed via a computer and frame grabber and the data converted from the RGB 

system to a hue, saturation and intensity system. Comparison of the hue values with 

calibration results gives the surface temperature for each pixel location. A video 

recording of the surface temperature variation in response to a fluid temperature 

change can be used to determine the surface heat flux and corresponding surface heat 

transfer coefficient. For semi-infinite conditions, the optically measured variation in 

temperature with time can be related to the heat transfer coefficient (assumed 

constant) by solving the following equation:

Thermographic phosphors emit radiation in the visible spectrum when 

illuminated with ultraviolet light. The intensity of emission at specific wavelengths can 

be related to the temperature over a wide range of surface temperatures. A CCD 

camera is required to record the transient optical images and calibration is challenging, 

but high-temperature applications are particularly appealing [Bizzak and Chyu 1995]. 

Infrared thermography is also in widespread use, with a variety of recent references 

available [Hakenesch 1999, Astarita et al. 2000, Astarita et al. 2006]. 

Thermal Radiation Methods 

All materials continuously absorb and emit electromagnetic waves or photons by 

raising or lowering their molecular energy levels. The intensity and wavelengths 

distribution of emission can be related to the absolute temperature of the material. 

According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, radiated heat transfer is proportional to the 

fourth power of the difference in temperature. Detectors of thermal radiation or 

radiometers can broadly be grouped according to how the incoming radiation interacts 

with the detector material. Generally, thermal detectors convert incident radiation into 

a temperature rise and photon detectors absorb the energy of the incident radiation. 

Photon detectors were initially more laboratory-bound due to the fact that they were 

usually more fragile than thermal detectors but they are nevertheless in continuous 

development because they are inherently adequate to high temperature applications 

[Bhattacharya et al. 2007]. Not all photomultiplication-based instruments are fragile, 

however, since heavy-duty, rugged versions exist for radiation measurements in 

industrial burners [Sanz et al. 2008]. 

The advantage of thermal radiation methods is that they are non-contact or 

non-disruptive. Sensing surfaces are often treated with appropriate coatings in order to 

establish known, high surface absorptivities/emissivities, enabling thermal radiation 

measurements. However, some problems arise if these measurements are to be carried 

out in high temperature, aggressive environments such as those usually found in heavy-

duty industrial equipment.  Basic problems to be solved are the need to avoid sensing 

element surface fouling, corrosion problems and contamination of the measurements by 

the convective component of the total heat flux, not to mention the simple survival of 

the instrument in such a hostile environment. 



24 

 

In situations where convection and radiation coexist, gauges generally measure 

the total heat flux. In order to perform heat flux partitioning, gauges are usually 

designed to measure either radiation or convection, but not both. Arguably the easiest 

way to measure only radiation is to place a transparent window or lens between the 

radiation source and the heat flux gauge. A number of devices are based on this 

approach [McGee 1988], such as pyrometers, bolometers and infrared cameras, 

representing a well-developed and specialized field. The purpose of this review is not, 

however, to detail these devices. Incident heat fluxes are typically measured either with 

gauges using RTDs or thermocouples, or by directly measuring the radiation with 

photoconductive detectors [Baker and Ryder 1975]. In a different approach, the total 

heat flux and the convection component can be measured by using two heat flux 

gauges, one with a high-emissivity coating and the other with a low-emissivity coating, 

the radiation component being the difference between the measurements of the two 

gauges. Illustrated in Figure 1.7 is an example of such a sensor [Hukseflux 2009], with 

one gauge coated with gold and the other with a black absorbent. 

 

 

    

Figure 1.7 – Convective and radiative heat flux sensor with two sensing elements of different 

emissivities [Hukseflux 2009]. 

 

Other variations on the layered gauge principle for high temperature 

measurements rely on water-cooled configurations, many of which were developed from 

the latter half of the 1960s to the early 1970s [Anson and Godridge 1967, Schulte and 

Kohl 1970]. Illustrated in Figure 1.8 is the Anson-Godridge sensor, used to measure the 

heat flux within an oil-burning boiler. Other similar systems were reported for use as a 

total heat flux meter in power plant boilers, with an interesting contribution regarding 

the proposed engineering solutions to permanently install the gauges inside the boiler. 



25 

 

Since the meters are directly installed on the heat exchanger tubes, the heat sink and 

gauge cooling system are the tubes themselves. A portable version was also proposed, 

where a heat pipe took the role of the boiler tubes [Neal et al. 1980]. 

 

 

Figure 1.8 – Anson-Godridge sensor [Anson and Godridge 1967]. 

 

Problems arise with the radiation-only devices when the environment of the 

measurement is dirty enough to leave deposits on the window, which degrades its 

transmission. The hollow ellipsoidal total radiation flux meter uses a thermopile as the 

sensing element where all the radiation entering through an inlet small orifice is focused 

by an ellipsoidal mirror [Chedaille and Braud 1972], the basic sensing element being the 

layered gauge described above. The ellipsoidal mirror, with a near-unitary reflectivity 

regardless of wavelength and incident angle, is added in order to focus all the radiation 

falling on the frontal orifice of the heat flux sensor. A flow of dry nitrogen is injected 

through small holes placed at the mirror walls in order to avoid the condensation of 

vapours and the deposition of particles. The sensitivity and response time of this gauge 

depend essentially on the thermopile used as sensing element. The most important 

advantage of the ellipsoidal radiometer is its high efficiency in converting thermal 

radiation into sensible heat (once again regardless of wavelength and direction of 

incidence), its major drawbacks being the influence of the nitrogen stream on readings, 

its fragility and the need for periodic calibration which limits its use to laboratory 

applications. The cleanliness (or lack thereof) of the ellipsoidal mirror and the location 

of the thermopile give the gauge its high sensitivity and are main factors contributing 

to its fragility. Any degradation in mirror reflectivity strongly affects the gauge 

performance and the validity of its calibration curve. 



26 

 

The basic ellipsoidal radiometer has been continuously developed over time, 

involving improved versions of the instrument itself, its applications in full-scale 

industrial studies [Hayes et al. 2001] and its calibration procedures [Murthy et al. 2000, 

Hayes et al. 2001, Murthy et al. 2003], with further refinements still taking place and 

yielding higher sensitivities [Oliveira and Yanagihara 2004, Oliveira and Yanagihara 

2008]. This improved version, designated as a semi-ellipsoidal radiometer due to its 

modified cavity geometry, is illustrated in Figure 1.9. 

 

 
    

Figure 1.9 – Semi-ellipsoidal radiometer [Oliveira and Yanagihara 2008]. 

 

Other radiometers adequate for application in thermal radiation measurements 

in full-scale furnaces were proposed. One of them is also a variation of the layered 

gauge, but in this case the gas screen around the sensing element is present mainly in 

order to eliminate the convective component of the total heat flux [Ballintijn and 

Ginsel 1968]. Considering the sensing element type and the described design, relatively 

good sensitivities can be obtained at the expense of large response times. However, this 

gauge can distinguish between radiative and total heat flux just by switching the gas 

screen on or off, thereby performing heat flux partitioning. It also comprises a rugged 

and simple design, which is an important consideration when industrial uses are 

foreseen. Its principal problems are the limited ability of the gas screen to avoid fouling 

and the convective heat flux component, with adverse effects on the gauge accuracy 

and reliability, and the possible cooling effect of the sensing element due to the gas 

screen. Despite these limitations, the gauge was successfully used for heat flux studies 

in industrial furnaces [Hoogendoorn et al. 1970]. 

Another solution developed for measuring radiation heat flux in combusting 

environments is the transpiration radiometer, this technique having been successfully 

applied to the measurement of radiative heat loads in gas turbine engines [Atkinson et 



27 

 

al. 1988] and to the characterization of pool fires [Matthews and Longenbaugh 1989]. 

The basic principle is to blow air through a porous plug (essentially a thin porous disk 

mounted on a cylindrical water-cooled copper body) which composes the exposed 

surface of the gauge, rather than around the sensing element. The air flow has several 

purposes, the first of which is to literally blow-off any fluid boundary layer from the 

surface of the gauge if the flow is sufficiently high, resulting in the elimination of 

convection. Secondly, the flow provides the temperature difference measured by the 

gauge, the output signal being proportional to the difference between the porous disk 

and inlet air temperatures. The output signal is monitored by a differential 

thermocouple, one of the junctions being attached to the back face of the porous disk 

(on its axis line) and the junction set in the transpiration gas stream just behind the 

disk. The thermal radiation flux is proportional to the signal obtained with the 

differential thermocouple, i.e., to the temperature difference between the porous 

medium and the transpiration stream. The porous disk temperature is itself a function 

of the flow rate and specific heat of the air, as well as of the net radiation heat flux to 

the disk. The balance between gas cooling and radiation heating determines the disk 

temperature, although a calibration procedure is necessary to establish the efficiency of 

the heat transfer process between the gas and the disk. A second thermocouple can be 

attached to the disk edge, allowing the use of the instrument as a Gardon gauge if the 

gas stream is switched off [Moffat et al. 1971]. 

The instrument requires two calibration steps. The first is the determination of 

the transpiration gas mass flow rate required to eliminate the convective heat flux. The 

second step is required in order to obtain a correlation between the incident radiation 

flux and the corresponding output signal, the whole calibration procedure being 

performed under the same conditions (pressure and external cooling) found during 

actual measurements. This complex calibration procedure is the gauge’s main 

disadvantage, which is offset by significant advantages such as the possibility of 

measuring radiation heat fluxes even in the presence of convection or other thermal 

fluxes governed by external flow aerodynamics. In addition, the gauge is naturally not 

affected by fouling, since particles are deflected by the transpiration stream and the 

sensing element has a view angle of virtually 180°.  

A similar but slightly different radiometer for operation in high-ash boilers was 

proposed and studied in detail [Moffat et al. 1971, Brajuskovic and Afgan 1991, 

Brajuskovic et al. 1991]. Basic differences are the fact that instead of going through the 

plug, the air is directed through slots around a solid plug, and the sensing element is 

replaced by a Gardon-type heat flux sensor. Indeed, the air flow keeps the ash particles 

from reaching the heat flux gauge and it takes away the thermal energy as in other 



28 

 

transpiration gauges, and heat transfer is radial trough the plug as in a circular foil 

gauge. The heat flux is proportional to the temperature difference measured between 

the centre and the edge of the plug. This “clean” heat flux gauge can be used with a 

second gauge that has no air flow, to form a system to measure particle deposition in 

combustors. As deposition occurs in the “dirty” gauge surface, the heat transfer 

resistance increases and the measured heat flux drops [Marner et al. 1989]. The 

thickness of the deposit can then be related to the difference in heat transfer between 

the two gauges. Another fundamental difference is a significantly more powerful 

screening jet (with a maximum velocity at least twice as high), when compared with 

the previous solutions. The effect of the screening-gas flow rate level on the calibration 

curve and response time was investigated, and time constants between 2.3 and 4.6 

seconds and an accuracy of plus or minus 10% or better were reported in detailed 

studies of this gauge [Brajuskovic and Afgan 1991]. Due to their ability to perform heat 

flux partitioning and to evaluate deposit thicknesses, these radiometers are the basis of 

online furnace and boiler diagnostic systems [Calisto et al. 2008]. 

The same principle of blowing off the convective component of the total heat 

flux is used in another heat flux meter (which reverts to the option of having gas 

crossing the sensitive element) that allows the separate measurement of the convection 

and radiation components of the total heat flux. Once again, if the transpiration gas 

flow rate is above a critical flow rate, sufficient for blowing off the boundary layer on 

the sensing element surface, the sensing element is exposed to the total heat flux, i.e., 

convection plus radiation heat fluxes. If the transpiration gas mass flow rate is higher 

that the critical flow rate, the convection heat flux to the sensing element is eliminated 

and the sensing element only receives the radiation heat flux. With two independent 

successive measurements, there is the possibility of assessing both the radiation and the 

convection components of the received heat flux, effectively performing radiation 

partitioning [Afgan and Leontiev 1995]. This instrument uses a thick (namely when 

compared with Gardon foils) porous disk as sensing element, replacing the thin net 

used in earlier instruments [Moffat et al. 1971].  

The thicker porous disc has the advantage of collecting the totality of the 

thermal radiation incident on the surface, no thermal radiation escaping to the inner 

side of the gauge body due to the non-existent transmissivity of the porous element. In 

addition, temperature measurements are made at the front and back surfaces of the 

porous disk, enabling the determination of the incoming radiation by an energy balance 

to the porous disk. This configuration was pursued further, first by obtaining and 

testing an operational version of the instrument [Martins et al. 1998, Martins et al. 

2000], then by extending its application range in order to effectively perform heat flux 



 

partitioning and to obtain a faster response version using a transient operational mode

[Martins et al. 2006a, Martins

The usual energy exchange method is by means of an electric circuit heater or 

by dissipation of a pulsed radiation source from a laser, namely because the power is 

easily measured and controlled. Cooling can be achieved with convective passageways 

within the device or by means of the Peltier effect [Shewan et al. 1989]. Owing to the 

response time of a typical active heat flux sensor arrangement and of power limitations 

associated to the electrical heating, these methods are not recommended for either high 

heat fluxes or for high temperature applications, limiting its applicability in high-

temperature industrial furnaces. Active heating methods have also been incorporated 

on low boundary condition-disruption devices [Saidi and Kim 2004]. 

A typical sensor design for the measurement of heat transfer into a surface is 

the use of heater strips exposed to the convective boundary condition but well insulated 

on the back and sides of the sensor. Electric current is passed through the heater strip 

material until equilibrium is achieved, monitored by a surface temperature device such 

as a thermocouple or RTD. A wide variety of such devices has been developed and 

analysed [Poloniecki et al. 1995]. A sandwich construction can be applied to a surface, 

comprising an insulating layer, a heater, a black background and a liquid crystal layer, 

in order to obtain local steady state heat transfer values. Commonly used heaters have 

included thermistors, thin layers of gold, nichrome wires and carbon fibres. The 

difficulty in applying a uniform layer to a complex geometry can be overcome by means 

of producing a flexible sandwich which can be stuck to the component of interest. One 

embodiment of this technique is to use carbon fibres as the heater within an epoxy 

resin. Thermochromic liquid crystals are applied to the surface to measure the 

temperature.  

Energy supply methods can also be used in a transient mode by applying a 

known quantity of heat to a surface and by measuring the thermal response. The use of 

a laser to supply a discrete local heat flux, along with an infrared camera system, has 

also been employed to determine the local surface temperature distribution due to 

heating [Porro et al. 1991]. A conduction solution using this measured temperature 

distribution can be used to calculate the heat transfer coefficient.

Mass transfer analogy techniques 

Well-known mathematical similarities between the partial differential equations that 

govern heat and mass transfer are embodied in the boundary layer relations that rely 

on the Nusselt, Reynolds, Prandtl, Sherwood and Schmidt adimensional numbers. 

These can be practically exploited in order to obtain heat transfer measurements from 

the observations of mass transfer experiments, which have the advantage of being 

generally much easier to carry out (especially on complex or difficult geometries) than 

heat transfer experiments and are less prone to experimental error and uncertainty. 

Additionally, it is much easier to model the equivalent of adiabatic and isothermal 

boundary conditions.  

One of the best-known mass transfer methods is the naphthalene sublimation 

technique [Goldstein and Cho 1995]. At atmospheric pressure and temperatures, 

naphthalene (C10H8) sublimates from solid to vapour, i.e. without any intermediate 

liquid phase. This, together with the fact that naphthalene is easily cast and machined, 

and that its relevant thermophysical properties are well documented, make it an ideal 

choice. Naphthalene is applied to the surface using casting, machining, spraying or 

dipping (or a combination of these), the local mass distribution being measured by 

either weighing or using a surface profile gauge. In order to obtain local rather than 

surface-average information, the surface is divided into a number of individual 

segments which are weighed separately. The experiment is run for a long enough period 

in order to create a reasonable loss of the solid naphthalene, the transferred mass being 

measured by either weighing or using a surface profile gauge at the completion of the 

experimental run. Using the appropriate heat and mass transfer relations, the Nusselt 

number, and hence the convective heat transfer coefficient, can be computed. Albeit 

useful, the technique does have a number of drawbacks, namely excessive experimental 

times at low flow velocities and the difficulty of adequately controlling ambient 

temperature over long periods. The vapour pressure of naphthalene is very sensitive to 

ambient temperature, so that long experimental times can produce significant 

experimental errors.  

 Vapour pressure sensitivity to temperature is also important at high velocities 

where viscous heating occurs. In high shear flows, naphthalene can be worn-off the

surface by erosion. Long experimental times may cause significant changes in shape in 

the mass transfer model. The results are by definition time-average values. For wind 

tunnels, a naphthalene-free air stream should be maintained and variations in air 

supply temperature minimized. The latent heat of vaporization of naphthalene will 

cause a drop in the actual surface temperature compared with that of the free stream. 

It is therefore advisable to measure the temperature of the naphthalene model by 

thermocouples on the surface. This technique has nonetheless been used to provide 

accurate and valuable data for applications where conventional heat transfer 

instrumentation would be more difficult, in particular: external and internal flows, 

natural convection, fins and heat exchanger geometries, turbulence promoters, 

impinging jets, rotating surfaces and the cooling of electronic devices [Souza Mendes 

1991]. 

1.3.4 Conclusions 

An analysis of the main features, advantages and disadvantages of the various methods 

makes relevant some comparisons with those of the instrument developed and described 

herein. 

Instruments with short response times are typically laboratory-bound and 

comparatively fragile devices, since their fast responses are often achieved with low 

thermal inertia components at the expense of robustness. At the opposite side of the 

spectrum, so to speak, are rugged industrial-grade instruments meant for operation in 

high-temperature, aggressive environments were fouling may be an issue. These tend to 

have much larger response times and are usually bulky and require subsystems such as 

water cooling circuits or must incorporate features such as windows for convection 

contamination avoidance in the case of radiometers which, in any case, tend to increase 

overall dimensions, complexity and unit cost. Air-blowing cleaning systems can also be 

used both for fouling avoidance and for boundary layer blow-off, thus avoiding 

convection contamination. Furthermore, the implementation of heat flux partitioning 

requires instruments that are usually more complex, typically having two separate 

sensing elements, or even two separate instruments for measuring each component of 

the incident heat flux. 



33 

 

The proposed instrument, while somewhat less robust than earlier transpiration 

radiometers, was proven to withstand environments with high temperatures and the 

presence of soot and dust particles. Thanks to its low thermal inertia microperforated 

sensing element, the designed and proposed instrument allows faster responses than 

conventional radiometers without significantly compromising its robustness and 

especially without losing the ability to avoid fouling thanks to its transpiration airflow. 

Furthermore, faster temperature responses allow a transient operational mode that 

potentially enables heat flux partitioning implementation, which is aided by the precise 

airflow control allowed by the instruments precisely defined and comparatively simple 

geometry. Comparatively diminished dimensions and complexity are achieved using air 

rather than water refrigeration. This instrument was the subject of a patent 

application, and the fact that this patent was granted indicates that the issuing 

organization’s own services did not find any instruments with quite the same features 

as the one under discussion, which validates the intended novelty and contribution of 

the present document. 

1.4 Objectives and Thesis Contribution 

The literature review carried out beforehand shows that most of the established 

methods were developed to be used in clean, well-controlled laboratory environments. 

In many cases, the proposed techniques are too complex and expensive to be 

transferred to current industrial applications and have significant limitations when used 

in high temperature, aggressive environments, leading to a lack of heat flux gauges able 

to be used in high temperature, aggressive industrial equipment. 

From the discussion in the paragraphs above, a clear development line towards 

a rugged and reliable radiometer becomes apparent, from the basic principle of using a 

transpiration gas both to eliminate convection by blowing off the boundary layer and 

to deflect incoming soot particles in order to diminish fouling. A robust operational 

version had been obtained in earlier work, with adequate performance but much 

potential for further enhancements, especially as far as bulk and response times were 

concerned. Its potential for heat flux partitioning was indentified and discussed but not 

achieved, while other instruments that enable that partition are not suitable for 

aggressive environments. The next logical step to be taken was thus to attempt: 



34 

 

• A diminution of the sensor’s overall dimensions; 

• A reduction of the sensor’s response time; 

• The implementation of heat flux partitioning. 

These objectives and contributions of the work described here had however to 

be achieved without compromising earlier instrument’s demonstrated capabilities and 

advantages.  

The problems of the large time constant and of the implementation of a 

transient operation that would enable an effective heat flux partitioning are related 

because of the control of allowable thermal levels in the system and of the impact of 

the transpiration airflow in the temperature fields within the sensing element. The 

latter’s features, notably its morphology and thermal inertia, were also variables to be 

considered. 

Previous instruments were unable to implement heat flux partitioning because 

of the need to keep temperatures below certain values, especially in order to keep its 

radiative emission low when compared to incident radiation from the surroundings. 

This meant that the transpiration airflow could not be switched off for enough time to 

implement a transient operation mode where the instrument’s steady response was 

anticipated by measuring the slope of the temperature variation curve, which was 

shown to be proportional to the incident heat flux. 

Rather than using the thick (4 mm) porous steel cylinder used in previous 

instruments, a low thickness (0.1 mm) microperforated plate was used. The 

microperforated pattern allows a preservation of the transpiration airflow, albeit 

inducing a transmissivity component in the overall radiative flux balance that must be 

taken into account. Besides intrinsically lowering the instrument’s response time, the 

new element’s much lower thermal inertia leads to much faster temperature curve 

responses, which in turn allow the switching off of the transpiration airflow for very 

brief times that nevertheless allow a sufficient temperature increase for curve slope 

calculation and total heat flux determination. 

This means that from an operational point of view the instrument can be 

thought of mainly as a radiometer, since the default airflow that crosses the sensing 

element is supercritical, i.e. with a mass flux high enough to blow-off the boundary 



35 

 

layer on its outer surface and eliminate convection. That airflow can however be set to 

subcritical values (or even totally shut-off) several times per second in order to enable 

total heat flux determination without exceeding maximum allowable temperatures, 

provided the data acquisition system has enough time resolution for the purpose. If 

these on-off cycles are short enough, it can be assumed that conditions in the 

surroundings have not changed significantly and heat flux partitioning is achieved 

because both components of the total heat flux are measured, radiation directly and 

convection by difference between successive total flux and radiation measurements. 

This means that the instrument’s basic operation mode makes use of the protection 

afforded by the transpiration gas while still inducing pulses of calculation-enabling 

temperature transients. 

Overall dimensions are made smaller in part due to the use of the 

aforementioned low-thickness microperforated plate, but especially by the use of air 

rather than water refrigeration, enabled by the sensing element’s lower thermal inertia. 

An instrument embodying all the principles above was designed, after adequate 

analytical and numerical models were developed and compared, along with further 

dimensioning procedures and numerical simulations. Several prototypes were built and 

tested with a data acquisition and processing system designed for the purpose. Detailed 

calibration procedures were also developed and proposed. 

A patent application was prepared and submitted during the development and 

design process, the issuing organisation (Instituto Nacional de Propriedade Industial – 

Portuguese National Institute of Industrial Property) having approved the preliminary 

report, having found no impediments to patentability, and issued a provisional patent 

application that must be converted into a definitive patent application,  pending a 

decision to carry on by the administration of the University of Aveiro, as patent co-

proprietor, to be taken until August 1st, 2013 [Calisto and Martins 2012]. 

1.5 Thesis Structure 

Chapter 1 provides a brief introduction to the problem of heat flux measurement and 

the relevance of heat flux as a thermodynamic variable and design parameter. The 

thesis’s contribution, objectives and structure are also discussed and its integration in a 



36 

 

continuous line of research and development is addressed in order to adequately explain 

the framework in which this work took place. A review of the available methods to 

measure heat flux, along with a discussion of their relative merits and major 

advantages and disadvantages, is presented. The contribution of the present work is 

established and discussed by comparison. 

Chapter 2 provides a review of the relevant physical phenomena that must be 

taken into account during the instrument’s development, namely in the definition of 

both the analytical formulation of its theoretical model and its operational 

specifications. The integration of the analytical treatment of a large number of small 

holes with variable physical conditions into a model for heat conduction within the 

cylindrical element and its interaction with boundary and initial conditions is not 

straightforward, but is discussed and achieved by treating the cooling effect of the 

airflow as a heat sink term. Green’s functions and finite differences are used with the 

purpose of obtaining a solution to the boundary value problem resulting from the 

physical conditions of the sensor, including the system’s transient behaviour, its 

response under various situations being discussed, namely in the simultaneous 

occurrence of non-uniform initial temperature fields, the presence of heat sink terms 

and non-homogeneous boundary conditions. Solutions are compared with 

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software solutions and the usefulness of the 

developed models is discussed. 

Chapter 3 is a study of dimensional and operational parameters that influence 

the sensor’s performance. Assumptions and simplifications made in the process of 

developing the analytical model are discussed, along with the instrument’s 

dimensioning and design procedures, taking into account conclusions from the previous 

chapter and establishing the procedures necessary for carrying out various analytical 

and numerical parametric studies, namely as far as relevant mass flow values, boundary 

layer control, compressibility and transmissivity in the microperforated plate, transient 

effects or the external cooling system are concerned.  

Chapter 4 is a detailed discussion of the experimental setup and of equipment 

selection procedures, along with the presentation and discussion of data acquisition and 

control setups. The specifications of the various components that were used in the 

course of the experimental work are presented, while their integration into the data 



37 

 

acquisition and control system are detailed along with implemented methodologies and 

procedures. Special relevance is given to the data processing flow and operations. 

Measurements carried out with the discussed setup are described and relevant 

comparisons with previously developed analytical and numerical models are made 

against experimental data. Instrument calibration procedures are also proposed, 

described and discussed. 

Chapter 5 lists and discusses the thesis’s main conclusions while also presenting 

proposed developments to be carried-out in the future.

CHAPTER 2 

ANALYTICAL MODEL FORMULATION AND 

NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS 

 

An analytical formulation for the proposed instrument is developed 

from basic principles and assumptions. A low thickness sensing element 

perforated steel plate is proposed instead of earlier sinterized metal 

components. The analytical description of small holes with variable 

physical conditions and their interaction with boundary and initial 

conditions into a model for heat conduction is not straightforward, 

rendering necessary simplifications in order to yield a compact and 

readily understandable model without loss of detail and accuracy. 

Possible approaches are presented and compared with numerical 

simulations performed using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) 

methods, with emphasis on the element’s transient behaviour in 

situations such as the simultaneous occurrence of non-uniform initial 

temperature fields, heat sink terms and non-homogeneous boundary 

conditions. The merits of the proposed approaches are discussed, 

namely in terms of potentially reduced computational effort when 

compared to CFD. 

 

2.1 Introduction 

Underlying the present dissertation is the problem of adequately measuring radiative 

and convective heat fluxes, either on their own or in combination. Such measurements 

must in some practical cases be performed in relatively short times, both in order to 

obtain a fast response for its own sake and to adequately capture possible fast, time-

dependant behaviours.  

The relative importance of both heat transfer modes may differ, depending on 

particular conditions of each application, but each mode reflects different 

characteristics of the respective thermodynamic system, regardless of their relative 

contribution. 



40 

 

By definition, convective heat transfer depends on the existence of a fluid 

stream on the heat transfer surface to be considered, its intensity being directly related 

to local parameters such as boundary layer characteristics, fluid properties or local 

temperature differences between fluid and wall. Radiative heat transfer not only does 

not require a physical medium to take place but also has an integral nature (in the 

sense that it takes into account exchanges with the global system), depending on the 

radiative properties of the participating surfaces and on the temperature difference 

between them. Any enclosed fluid may also participate in the radiative transfer balance 

depending on its radiative properties and temperature. For these reasons, the 

convective and the radiative heat fluxes may be considered as two different diagnostic 

parameters, the first reflecting local conditions while the second reflects global or 

integral conditions.  

In order to determine the associated heat flux, a total heat flux measurement 

problem can thus be divided in two parts, the first one being the identification of the 

relevant heat transfer modes and the second the analysis of the sensing element 

response to an energy load. One of the purposes of the instrument to be developed was 

precisely the differentiation between radiative and convective components of the total 

heat flux, i.e. performing heat flux partitioning.  

The study of the relationship between the received heat load and the 

temperature field in the sensing element under known conditions can then be carried 

out, the sensor’s thermal behaviour depending on the total heat load and not on the 

associated transfer modes, allowing a separate study of both parts of the overall 

problem. Radiation heat flux measurement is however the most important part of the 

problem from an operational point of view, since the high temperature levels usually 

found in industrial furnaces reduce the relative importance of convective heat flux in 

the overall energy balance analysis. Nevertheless, convective heat flux cannot be 

ignored since a variety of diagnostic systems rely on total (rather than merely 

radiative) heat fluxes as input parameters [Calisto et al. 2008]. 

Broadly speaking, any of the radiative flux measurement techniques and 

approaches discussed in Chapter 1 could be used. If the environment is clean and 

convection free, the only additional parameter to account for is typically surface 

emissivity, since the surface temperature can be known most of the times. The sensing 



41 

 

element surface should therefore be a grey surface with a known emissivity, which must 

be as high as possible in order to increase the instrument sensitivity.  

Obviously, if measurements are carried out in the presence of convective heat 

fluxes, some precautions are required in order to prevent the radiative component from 

being contaminated by convective contributions. If the environment is not clean, 

typically if there is particulate matter in suspension, fouling on the sensing element 

surface must be prevented since it will affect its radiative properties and render its 

calibration curves useless.  

As mentioned in Chapter 1, a usual technique for the avoidance of the 

convective component of the total heat flux is the addition of a special transparent 

window to the gauge, protecting the sensing element from contact with the gas stream. 

This procedure effectively eliminates the convection component of the total heat flux 

and an appropriate selection of the window material renders the attenuation of the 

radiative component negligible, but the instrument view angle is typically reduced.  

This is the main reason for the use of a gas screen around the sensing element 

to avoid fouling on the sensor surface, with air or nitrogen being blown through specific 

slots around the sensing element or through the element itself if it is porous or 

perforated. The gas screen’s cooling effect on the sensing element not only also affects 

the sensor’s output but can be made a central feature of its operation mode, as 

discussed below in further detail.  

In most studies involving radiometers the output of the instrument has to be 

obtained in steady state conditions, for which a variety of theoretical models are 

available. However, reliable steady-state data are usually not enough within the 

framework of advanced diagnostic systems, since for certain measurement applications 

it is also very important to record dynamic characteristics such as the transient 

response of the instrument. If the results are to be obtained in transient conditions, this 

response time must be considerably shorter.  

As explained in Chapter 1, this was one of the main driving forces behind the 

present work and a suitable theoretical formulation is necessary. Such a formulation 

was developed by Martins [Martins 1998] in his PhD thesis, leading to an operational 

heat flux meter, tested in industrial conditions, its formulation, specifications and 



42 

 

performance being discussed in subsequent publications that are evidence of a rugged 

and reliable radiometer [Martins et al. 1998, Martins et al. 2000].  

Fouling was shown to be avoided thanks to the transpiration air flow, although 

large response times (up to 5 s) were observed. While adequate for a wide range of 

applications, the integration of such an instrument in systems that exhibit strongly 

time-dependant and fast behaviours could be hindered by high response times. The 

instrument was also bulky due to its refrigeration system. Gas turbines come to mind 

as examples of systems that require fast-response instruments due to the speed at 

which they operate and which render slow-responding sensors inappropriate and have 

restrictions regarding the bulkiness and weight of any subsystem. 

Relevant differences exist between the aforementioned instrument and the one 

developed, designed and discussed here, especially as far as the sensing element is 

concerned. A relatively thick porous steel cylinder was used in the older version, its 

high thermal inertia compensated to some extent by the advantage of collecting the 

totality of the thermal radiation incident on the surface, no thermal radiation escaping 

to the inner side of the gauge body due to the non-existent transmissivity of the porous 

element. 

The low thickness microperforated (in order to preserve the transpiration 

airflow) plate proposed in the version discussed here does induce a transmissivity 

component in the overall radiative flux balance that must be taken into account, but  

lowers the instrument’s response time and makes for much faster temperature curve 

responses, which in turn allow the switching off of the transpiration airflow for very 

brief times that nevertheless allow a sufficient temperature increase for curve slope 

calculation and total heat flux determination. 

Differences also exist in terms of the interaction of the sensing element with the 

transpiration gas, rendering the model based on energy balances inadequate to describe 

the microperforated plates’ behaviour. The presence of a large number of small holes 

with variable physical conditions (i.e. temperatures) must be accounted for in a model 

for heat conduction within the cylindrical element and its interaction with boundary 

and initial conditions. This is not straightforward but can be achieved by treating the 

cooling effect of the airflow as a heat sink term, as described below. 



43 

 

Further refinements were discussed in subsequent articles [Martins et al. 1998, 

Martins et al. 2000], namely a fully transient formulation [Martins 1998] that allowed 

for an extension of the instrument’s application range by opening the way to achieving 

a faster response and eventually heat flux partitioning.  

In the first subsequent experimental approaches, necessary transient behaviours 

were induced by varying the incident heat flux, exposing and masking the sensing 

element with a shutter. The transpiration airflow was kept at a steady value while 

several furnace set points were considered. The exposition of the sensing element to the 

hot furnace would lead to an increase in temperature and a direct proportionality 

between the slope of the line tangent to the temperature response curve and the 

incident heat flux was established, with the same slope being observed in the linear 

portion of the curve for the same heat fluxes regardless of the initial temperature [Hit 

2004]. This meant that it is unnecessary to “wait” for steady-state values and that the 

transient output of the radiometer can be used to determine the incident heat flux 

[Martins et al. 2006a, Martins et al. 2006b]. These conclusions led directly to the work 

presented in the present document. 

A noteworthy difference between the aforementioned experimental studies and 

the proposed operational mode has to do with how the transient behaviours are 

induced, since in the present case a pulsed transpiration gas mass flow is to be used, 

this option holding more promise since on/off control through the use of fast-response 

electrovalves is easier and faster to implement than the use of a front shutter. The 

electrovalve typically controls two distinct transpiration mass flow levels: a maximum 

value that ensures boundary layer blow-off and allows sufficient cooling for the sensing 

element, and a much lower value that lets some hot gases reach the sensor and that 

can even be set to a zero value if instrument protection (both in terms of fouling and 

thermal levels) is not compromised. This does introduce significant differences with the 

aforementioned earlier studies. In those cases the lower temperature level was reached 

with the transpiration airflow switched-on but without instrument exposure to the hot 

source (effectively reproducing a cold experiment, as discussed in Chapter 4), and 

temperatures only rose when the instrument was placed in the furnace, without 

variation in the transpiration airflow. This meant that the temperature increase was 

solely due to the incoming heat flux, no discussion being made in terms of heat flux 



44 

 

partitioning, although the magnitude of the transpiration airflows used and that were 

also necessary for sensing element thermal protection/refrigeration purposes would 

correspond to situations where the boundary layer would be blown-off and only 

radiative heat fluxes would be measured. This would also explain the fact that the 

slopes of the transient temperature curves were the same in the heating and cooling 

processes, since the driving force behind them would be the presence or absence of the 

incoming heat flux, given the constant transpiration airflow [Hit 2004]. 

The pulsed transpiration mass flow principle means that when the airflow is 

turned on above a critical value the instrument will behave like a conventional 

transpiration radiometer. In such conditions the temperature measured by the 

thermocouple attached to the perforated plate will be a steady-state equilibrium value 

dictated by the incoming radiation heat flux and the cooling provided by the 

transpiration airflow. The situation where the airflow is switched-off and the boundary 

layer will no longer be blown-off, however, will present a dramatic increase in measured 

temperature that is driven not only by the presence of a convective component in 

addition to the radiative component that was already present, but also by the absence 

of transpiration cooling in the sensing element. This process would lead to a steady-

state value that would be reached if temperatures were allowed to increase and 

stabilize, and would indeed be proportional to the total received heat flux. 

Nevertheless, the slope of the transient temperature curve at the start of the pulse 

(hence the zero value for time) would still be proportional to the incoming heat flux:

The analysis of the transient response is intended precisely to avoid reaching 

such high temperatures, which would not enable the convenient assumption of a 

comparatively insignificant plate emission term and most importantly could severely 

damage components and their weldings and attachments. If the process is carried out in 

a sufficiently rapid fashion, the radiative component of the heat flux can be treated as 

constant and the convective component can be estimated. A calibration of the transient 



45 

 

transpiration radiometer would thus involve the determination of the proportionality 

constant ? for various incident heat fluxes. 

When the transpiration airflow is reset at its initial mass flux, the transient 

temperature curve will decrease back towards its initial value dictated by the incident 

radiative flux but especially by the transpiration airflow, at a rate (i.e. slope) that will 

be a function of the magnitude of both factors and that can also be quantified. 

2.2 Model Requirements and Analytical Approach 

2.2.1 Problem Statement 

The problem of obtaining a formulation for an instrument sensitive element is 

essentially one of conduction within the element’s solid material, which can be assumed 

to be homogeneous in terms of composition and properties, with temperature fields 

resulting from convective, radiative and imposed temperature boundary conditions.  

In a solid body in which temperature differences occur, heat flow can be thought 

of as the rate of energy transfer (in Js-1) associated with the vibrational energy of atoms 

and molecules in the body, and heat flux is the heat flow per unit area at any point of 

the body. As mentioned earlier it cannot be measured directly but its effects can be 

observed on the surroundings, as in the melting of ice or the vaporization of water. 

Inside a solid body, the heat flux can be determined from the temperature distribution 

only if the relationship between temperature and heat flux is thoroughly understood. In 

a solid body with a steady temperature gradient, heat flux has a magnitude and a 

direction and is usually denoted as q
?
. The component of heat flux (in Wm-2) for 

direction x is for example:

where k is the thermal conductivity in Wm-1K-1 and the negative sign implies that heat

embodying Fourier’s law of heat conduction, which applies to bodies that are 

homogeneous (i.e. with the same substance overall), isotropic (heat flow with equal 

ease in any direction) and of macroscale size. 

For a three-dimensional cylindrical system such as the sensor element, the heat 

diffusion equation is readily available in most of the heat transfer literature references, 

including the most widespread [Holman 1986, Incropera and DeWitt 1996]. This is 

adequate for any given solid with heat conduction, and where surface phenomena (i.e. 

convection and radiation) are boundary conditions for the differential equation to be 

obtained. The form of the heat diffusion equation, when transient conduction and heat 

generation/sink terms (denoted as g, in Wm-3) are considered, can be given as:

Spatial coordinates are r in the radial direction, ? in the angular or azimuthal 

direction and z along the cylindrical axis or cylinder thickness. Density ? (kgm-3) and 

specific heat cp (Jkg
-1K-1) can be grouped as the material’s thermal diffusivity ?. The 

aforementioned references do not usually present any form of deduction for this 

equation, typically restricting themselves to the deduction of the cartesian case and 

leaving the cylindrical coordinates problem as a mere exercise. The deduction of the 

appropriate form of the heat equation is nevertheless rather straightforward and useful 

in the definition of an adequate mathematical model for the sensor, given its cylindrical 

shape. Some simplifications must be made at this point in order to obtain a viable 

model for the sensor, as discussed below. 



47 

 

The differential equation of heat conduction does not describe the temperature 

distribution in a region and will have numerous solutions unless a set of boundary 

conditions and an initial condition for a time-dependant problem are prescribed. The 

mathematical form of the solutions to heat conduction equations is determined by the 

boundary conditions, i.e. the value of the temperature (or its derivative) at the 

boundaries of the heat conducting body. The combination of an energy equation, 

specific boundary conditions and an initial condition is called a boundary value 

problem. In this particular case the body has an orthogonal geometry, which means 

that its boundaries are located where one coordinate is a constant, such as the outer 

radius of the cylinder. 

Initial conditions usually specify a temperature distribution in a medium at the 

origin of the time coordinate, that is, t = 0, while boundary conditions describe what 

physically takes place at the boundaries of the region. The number of boundary 

conditions for a boundary value problem depends on the form of the energy equation 

and the geometry of the system under consideration. On a given surface, temperature 

or heat flux distributions can be specified, or there may be exchanges by convection 

and/or radiation, the boundary condition being derived by performing an energy 

balance on the surface. The non-linear radiation term can be troublesome to obtain in 

some analytical approaches. Boundary conditions are often defined by specifying either 

temperature or heat flux distributions on surface S in the well-know forms of: 

• Dirichlet (or first kind boundary conditions) in which a temperature 

distribution is prescribed at the boundary surface, that is: 
 

 ( ),  on T f r t S= ?   
 

where the prescribed surface temperature ( ),f r t?  is in general a function 
of position and time, and the special case: 

 

 0 on T S=   



48 

 

is called the homogenous boundary condition of the first kind, r
?
 being a 

generic position vector, defined as adequate for each particular 

application. 

• Neumann (or second kind boundary conditions) in which a heat flux 

distribution is prescribed at the boundary surface, i.e.: 
 

 ( ),  on Tk f r t S

where T n? ?  is the derivative along the outward drawn normal of the 

surface and ( ),f r t?  is the prescribed heat flux in Wm-2, the special case

 being called the homogenous boundary condition of the second kind. 

• Robin/Fourier (or third kind boundary conditions) in which a heat 

transfer coefficient is specified and can be obtained by setting radiation 

and heat supply terms to zero, that is: 
 

 ( ),  on Tk hT hT r t S

k hT S
n

is called the homogenous boundary condition of the third kind. 

Additional boundary conditions (fourth and fifth kinds) can be defined for 

various physical situations such as interfaces and convection or radiation fluxes, but 



49 

 

these are not always practical to use for analytical purposes since they require the 

specification of surroundings’ (either fluids or surfaces) temperatures. 

As mentioned earlier, one of the features of previous versions of the sensor that 

was felt to be the most perfectible was its response time, which in turn led to the 

requirement of lowering its thermal inertia. The idea of using a metallic foil much 

thinner than the original porous steel disc came about naturally as a means of 

obtaining a much lower thermal inertia, while the option for a microperforated pattern 

enables a much more precise control of element geometry and physical properties when 

compared to the porous steel disc, without compromising the transpiration gas flow. 

This is essential since the transpiration gas pulses are central to the envisioned 

operational principle, for two main reasons.  

On the one hand, various changes in intensity of these pulses’ mass flow rate 

will provide transient temperature variations with varying slopes that can be related to 

the incident heat fluxes. On the other hand, sufficiently high mass flows will be 

responsible for enabling the instrument to operate purely as a radiometer, by blowing 

off the boundary layer on the sensing element’s exposed face and thus eliminating the 

convection heat flux component. As mentioned earlier, this would be done in a periodic 

fashion in order to allow for the separation of the components of the total heat flux.  

It is therefore essential to take into account the effects of the air flow pulse 

when developing any analytical description of the sensing element being exposed to 

incident heat fluxes and crossed by a comparatively cold mass flow. It is however 

obvious that a detailed accounting of a large number of small perforated holes 

distributed across the metallic element would be rather difficult to implement in purely 

analytical terms. The cooling effect of the transpiration mass flow and transient effects 

due to variations in that flow can be more sensibly described through the definition of a 

heat sink term (i.e. a negative generation component) in the basic differential equation. 

Assuming that azimuthal symmetry can be considered and that the temperature 

gradient across the element’s thickness must be considered, a more versatile model is 

obtained and can be readily simplified if this gradient can be ignored, depending on 

which particular thicknesses are to be considered. In this case, the heat equation:

since azimuthal (i.e. angular) variations are not to be considered. This is a first-order 

partial differential equation with respect to time and second-order partial differential 

equation with respect to the spatial coordinates r and z. An initial condition is 

therefore required for the temporal variation, which can be as simple as a constant 

initial temperature when time equals zero, or: 

 

 ( ), , 0 iT r z t T= = .  (2.8) 
 

This condition would correspond to a situation where the sensor was not 

exposed to any incident heat fluxes or transpiration gas flows, and the temperature 

over the whole element would be either that of the surroundings or one imposed by an 

external refrigeration system. Other situations would involve situations where a more 

complex (in the sense that it would not be constant in space) initial temperature field 

would be in existence at the moment where any given effect must be evaluated. This 

could be a situation where an initial equilibrium resulting from incident heat fluxes and 

the imposed temperature would be disturbed by a variation in the transpiration gas 

flow. 

Boundary conditions must then be specified in spatial terms in order to allow 

for the solution of the spatial component of the problem. A cylindrical element with 

radius b and thickness c is considered to be exposed to an incident heat flux qinc at       

z = c. The precise nature of this flux is not known beforehand so it can, as a first 

approximation, be considered merely as an imposed heat flux rather than being 

specified as either convection, radiation or combined boundary conditions. At z = 0 the 

element being heated by heat flux qinc will lose heat by an undetermined proportion of 



51 

 

convection and radiation to the tube that supplies the airflow and is assumed to be at a 

lower temperature. This heat flux is designated qem. The outer radial surface at r = b is 

maintained at a temperature T = Text. 

For generality it can be assumed that both the sink term g(r,z,t) and the flux 

boundary conditions qem(r) and qinc(r) vary with position and time. This spatial 

variation will be the case to be considered in some situations, while several 

simplifications can be introduced in other situations, namely time-independent heat 

fluxes.  

The literature states that non-homogenous boundary conditions may give rise to 

convergence difficulties when the solution is evaluated near the boundary. Thus, 

whenever possible, it is desirable to transform non-homogenous boundary conditions 

into homogenous ones [Özisik 1993]. This could be achieved by performing a variable 

change in the form ? = T - Text and solving the heat equation for the new variable, the 

non-homogenous boundary condition T - Text at r = b being rendered homogeneous in 

the form ? = 0 at r = b and with all remaining boundary conditions and the heat 

equation adjusted accordingly. This could however render performing surface radiation 

balances more complicated. In these conditions, the differential conduction equation 

can be written as:

The imposition of an incoming heat flux may be debatable in purely physical 

terms, since the heat flux at that boundary is the result of the balance between 

surroundings and gas temperatures on the one hand and the surface temperature on the 

other, especially when radiation is to be considered.  

The assumption of a fixed incoming, radiation-dominated heat flux can be 

considered reasonable if the contribution of the emission component of the surface 

balance is kept low when compared to the incident radiation component, which can be 

achieved if surface temperatures are likewise kept as low as possible. This assumption 

of an imposed incoming radiation heat flux is furthermore justified by the use of the 

transpiration principle, which implies that for sufficiently high transpiration mass flows 

the convective heat transfer is eliminated which, as mentioned in detail later, will 

correspond to a situation to be encountered for most of the instrument’s operation time 

and will result in a purely radiative boundary condition. 

For any given set of conditions in the high-temperature environment, high 

transpiration gas flows are required in order to lower surface temperatures, diminishing 

the magnitude of radial flows within the sensing element (overall temperatures being 

closer to the temperature imposed on the outer radius) and rendering the emission term 

much less significant. This principle was already applied to nullify these terms in 

energy balances for sensing elements of previous versions of the instrument [Martins 

1998]. High gas flows also have other advantages such as a more effective deflection of 

incoming soot particles, with the lower temperatures placing less severe thermal 



53 

 

constraints on the outer refrigeration system, and the welding between the 

thermocouples and the microperforated plate. 

It should be noted that the incident heat flux to be considered is not necessarily 

the overall flux due to the conditions surrounding the outer surface of the element, 

because of its microperforated pattern and its non-specular surface. While convective 

exchanges are not significantly altered compared with those for a non-perforated 

surface, other than by the difference in surface area, radiative exchanges can be 

substantially different due to transmission and reflection phenomena. 

The spectral irradiation G
?
 (typically in Wm-2µm-1) that strikes a 

semitransparent medium surface can be reflected, absorbed or transmitted in diverse 

proportions, following from a radiation balance that: 

 

 
,ref ,abs ,tr

G G G G
? ? ? ?
= + + .  (2.11) 

 

The determination of these components is in general complex, depending on the 

upper and lower surface conditions, the wavelength of the radiation and the 

composition and thickness of the medium, where volumetric effects can strongly 

influence conditions. If total rather than spectral (i.e. integrated over the whole 

spectrum), hemispherical components are assumed, reflectivity ?rad, absortivity ?rad and 

transmissivity ?rad yield: 

 

 
rad rad rad

1? ? ?+ + =   (2.12) 

 

the subscript “rad” being present to avoid confusions with density ? and thermal 

diffusivity ?. 

While most solids are opaque and have zero transmissivity, the microperforated 

plate has a non-zero value which must be taken into account. From Kirchhoff’s law, it 

will also be assumed that the total, hemispherical absortivity of the surface is equal to 

its total hemispherical emissivity ?.  



54 

 

If the temperature of the sensing element surface exposed to the hot 

surroundings responsible for the incoming radiation is kept low enough to make 

considering its radiative emission negligible, this means that the qinc heat flux 

considered as a boundary condition can be regarded as the incident radiative (and if 

present, convective) heat fluxes minus the transmitted and reflected radiative 

components. 

The achievement of low surface temperatures on the sensing element, which 

given the element’s low thickness and consequent lack of thermal gradients along its 

symmetry axis is the same as keeping the element’s temperature low over its whole 

volume, is therefore important in terms of simplicity of analysis: low surface 

temperatures ensure that the emission term is negligible when the difference to the 

surroundings is large, as is typical in boilers and furnaces. 

Addressing once more the formulation, in this case the transient heat 

conduction problem is non-homogenous because of the non-homogeneity of the 

differential equation (due to the generation term) and/or the boundary conditions.  

Heat conduction problems described by non-homogenous partial differential 

equations and boundary conditions can be handled with more or less difficulty by a 

variety of techniques, from orthogonal expansion to Laplace transforms or Green’s 

functions (GF) [Carslaw and Jaeger 1959, Arpaci 1966, Özisik 1993]. A homogeneous 

differential equation is a linear equation where all terms include either the dependent 

function or one of its derivatives, while a non-homogeneous equation includes a term 

that is a function of only the independent variable. Similarly, a boundary condition is 

homogeneous when the dependent variable or its derivatives, or any linear combination 

of the dependent variable or its derivatives, vanishes at the boundary. 

The orthogonal expansion and separation of variables technique is arguably the 

most common, having extensively been presented and discussed in most of the standard 

references on heat conduction, with some claiming that it is the proper way of solving 

this type of heat conduction problems [Arpaci 1966, Özisik 1968]. Its application can be 

difficult to handle when non-homogenous boundary conditions are present because this 

presence gives rise to convergence difficulties when the solution is evaluated near the 



55 

 

boundary. So, whenever possible, it is desirable to transform non-homogenous into 

homogenous boundary conditions.  

The non-homogeneous generation term is also typically handled if the problem 

is split into a set of simpler problems, which can be done if the generation term and the 

non-homogenous part of the boundary condition do not depend on time [Özisik 1993].  

This is usually achieved by splitting the overall problem for the T(r,z,t) temperature 

distribution into a steady-state problem that contains the non-homogenous components 

and is solved for TST(r,z), and a homogenous transient problem solved for THM(r,z t), 

with the T(r,z,t) solution for the original problem being given by: 

 

 ( ) ST HM, , ( , , )T r z t T T r z t= +   (2.13) 
 

This formulation becomes increasingly complex for two- or three-dimensional 

geometries and with increasing numbers of non-homogeneous boundary conditions. 

Laplace transforms are also commonly used but present the problem of the existence of 

an inverse transform not always being guarantied [Özisik 1993]. 

An immense number of analytical solutions for conduction heat transfer 

problems have been accumulated over the years. Even so, in many practical situations 

the geometry or boundary conditions are such that an analytical solution has not been 

obtained at all or else involves such a complex solution procedure that numerical 

evaluation becomes too cumbersome or difficult. As discussed below, in these situations 

other approaches may be more fruitful, finite-difference methods readily coming to 

mind as the most common and widespread example, with the basics of the method 

being readily available even in the most basic heat transfer manuals [Holman 1986, 

Incropera and DeWitt 1996]. 

In any case, the difficulty of treating the microperforated patterns as heat sink 

terms and integrating the presence of this non-homogeneous term must be dealt with, 

dictating to a large extent the most reasonable options in terms of analytical approach 

and complexity. The procedure implemented for calculation of the temperature fields 

using both the GF and finite differences methods nevertheless has some similarities, 

both approaches being highly structured and methodical processes. 



56 

 

2.2.2 Green’s Functions Formulation 

Methods based on the use of Green’s Functions (GF) are viable alternatives, being 

flexible, powerful, and especially well-suited for these particular applications given the 

fact that the same GF for a given geometry is a building block for determining the 

temperature distribution for situations such as a space-variable initial temperature 

distribution and time- and space-variable boundary conditions or volume energy 

generation/removal [Carslaw and Jaeger 1959, Stakgold 1967, Özisik 1993, Cole et al. 

2010]. This method can be viewed as a restatement of a boundary value problem into 

integral form and is useful if the GF is known (or can be found), and if the integral 

expressions can be evaluated. If these two limitations can be overcome, the GF method 

offers several other advantages such as systematic solution procedure due to GF 

libraries being available, saving time and reducing the possibility of error, which is 

particularly important for two- and three-dimensional geometries. For complex 

problems in which the heat conduction is caused by several non-homogeneous terms, 

the effect of each term can be considered separately. The GF method leads to 

analytical solutions in the form of integrals, the solution taking the form of a 

superposition (sum) of several integrals, one for each non-homogeneous term in the 

problem. 

Two- and three-dimensional transient GF can be found by simple multiplication 

of one-dimensional transient GF for the rectangular coordinate system for most 

boundary conditions, provided that the body is homogeneous and orthogonal. This 

multiplicative property can result in great simplification in the derivation of the 

temperature, as well as providing a very compact means of cataloguing the GF in these 

cases. For cylindrical coordinates, the multiplicative property of the GF applies to 

certain two-dimensional geometries, which is a further factor of attraction in the 

particular case under discussion. 

Several books give a good overview of the GF method [Carslaw and Jaeger 

1959, Stakgold 1967, Özisik 1993, Duffy 2001]. Of special interest is another reference 

(that has recently been updated in its second edition), presenting an overview of the 

GF method and giving extensive tables of GF for heat conduction and diffusion. These 

are organized with a number system for the number of spatial dimensions, the type of 

coordinate system and the type of boundary conditions, most of the book being devoted 



57 

 

to transient heat conduction and convergence improvement procedures [Cole et al. 

2010]. 

Other references have similar objectives to the work presented here, applying 

GF to heat conduction applications in the context of sensor development applications 

[Beck and Keltner 1987, Cole 2004], including in full cylindrical geometries, or the 

behaviour and temperature fields of structures in very high temperature environments, 

such as fires [Beck and Keltner 1987, Cole 2004, Wang et al. 2005, Wang and Tan 

2007a, Wang and Tan 2007b]. 

Most references focus their analyses on very particular applications in which 

some convenient simplifications can be made, either by considering uniform initial 

temperature fields, the lack of generation/heat sink terms, homogeneous boundary 

conditions or steady-state situations. The ultimate aim of the work described here is to 

establish the formalism necessary to study an azimuthally symmetrical cylindrical 

geometry in which all these matters must be considered simultaneously, which leads to 

the matter of establishing the requirements of the model to be developed. 

The aforementioned pulsed operation principle dictates that the model must 

describe the effect of the various mass flows to be considered, especially as far as 

temperature fields within the disk and its time response are concerned. The latter is 

fundamental since received heat fluxes were, as mentioned earlier, proven to be directly 

proportional to the slope of the tangent to the temperature response curve which, in 

turn, allows an anticipation of the instrument’s steady-state values. 

Arguably the main conceptual difficulty in the passage from the actual physical 

system to its analytical description is, in this case, taking into account the 

microperforated pattern that underlies the transpiration radiometer principle, in order 

to evaluate the effect of the various mass flows that will cross the plate. As mentioned 

earlier, the presence of a large number of small holes with variable physical conditions 

is not straightforward but can be achieved by treating the cooling effect of the airflow 

as a heat sink term. 

The usefulness of GF lies in the fact that once one such function is known the 

temperature distribution ( ),T r t?  in the medium is readily computed by the Green’s 



58 

 

Function Solution Equation (GFSE). In the case of the original three-dimensional 

transient, non-homogeneous heat conduction and for constant material thermal 

properties, the solution for ( ),T r t?  is expressed in terms of the three-dimensional GF

where Reg refers to the entire volume of the region considered, Si refers to the 

boundary surfaces of the region Reg, i = 1, 2, ..., N where boundary conditions of the 

second through fifth kinds are applied, Sj refers to the boundary surfaces of the region

the number of continuous boundary surfaces. Differential volume and surface elements

various terms in second member of the equation above is: 

• The first term is for the contribution of the initial condition function 

( )'F r?  on the temperature distribution; that is, GF '( , | , )G r t r ?? ?

evaluated for ? = 0 is multiplied by ( )'F r? and integrated over the whole 
region Reg; 

• The second term is for the contribution of energy generation ( ),g r t? on 
temperature ( ),T r t? , that is, GF '( , | , )G r t r ?? ? multiplied by ( ),g r t?  and 
integrated over the whole region Reg and over the time from ? = 0 to t; 

• The third term represents the contribution of the non-homogeneous 

terms ( ),i if r ?
?

 of the boundary conditions on the temperature, for 



59 

 

boundary conditions of the second through the fifth kinds. It consists of 

the GF evaluated at the boundary, multiplied by ( ),i if r ?

 and integrated 

over the whole boundary surface and over the time from ? = 0 to t; 

• The last term represents the contribution of the non-homogeneous terms 

( ),j jf r ?
?

of the boundary conditions on the temperature, for boundary 

conditions of the first kind. The benefit of rendering homogeneous the 

imposed temperature condition at r = a becomes apparent, since this 

last term would vanish and possible convergence issues near the 

boundary would be addressed. 

As mentioned above, once the GF is known, the temperature distribution 

( ),T r t?  in the medium is readily computed. Therefore, the establishment of the proper 
GF for any given situation is an integral part of the solution methodology using this 

approach. GF can be obtained by various techniques such as Laplace transforms or the 

method of images, but the simplest, straightforward and general approach uses the 

classic separation of variables technique for determining GF [Carslaw and Jaeger 1959, 

Özisik 1993, Cole et al. 2010]. 

The number of exact solutions in transient heat conduction and diffusion is 

extremely large and growing. Thus, numbering systems were devised in order to 

organize them while the numbers themselves can convey explicit meaning and contain a 

great deal of information. Arguably the most handy system was proposed in 1985 

([Beck and Litkouhi 1985], with further discussion [Beck 1984, Beck 1986]) allowing for 

a less tedious solution location procedure and a lesser effort in developing new solutions 

and simplifying the construction of a computer database in the form of the Green’s 

Functions Library [Cole 2000]. 

The numbering system makes it easier to keep track of the different possible 

combinations of boundary conditions and the GF associated with them. In cylindrical 

coordinates with azimuthal symmetry a specific GF is identified by a “number” of the 

form R0JZKL, in which R and Z represent the coordinate axes, and the letters 

following each axis name take on values 1 (Dirichlet condition, prescribed 

temperature), 2 (Neumann condition, prescribed heat flux), or 3 (Robin convective 

condition) to represent the type of boundary conditions present at the body faces 



60 

 

normal to that axis. Some references also list type 4 (Carslaw condition, thin film with 

no convection) and 5 (Jaeger condition, thin film with convection) boundary conditions 

[Cole et al. 2010]. 

Number 0 is also used to denote the lack of a physical boundary: designation 

R02 represents a solid cylinder (no physical boundary at r = 0) with a boundary 

condition of type 2 at r = a. Number R01Z13 describes a GF for a solid cylinder with 

the following boundary information: no physical boundary at r = 0, the curved face at 

r = a has a type 1 boundary (G = 0), the face at z = 0 has a type 1 boundary and the 

z = L face has a type 3 boundary (convection) [Cole 2004, Cole et al. 2010]. The 

numbering system is also able to account for time- and space-variable boundary 

conditions, initial temperature distributions, interfaces and generation/sink terms [Cole 

et al. 2010]. 

For the case under discussion the solid cylinder will have a R01 numbering in 

the radial direction, illustrating the facts that no physical boundary needs to be 

specified at the centre of the cylinder (which corresponds to a symmetry situation) and 

that the external refrigeration system imposes a fixed temperature on the outer radius. 

Perpendicular to the cylinder’s axis are two circular surfaces where heat fluxes occur, 

leading to a Z22 designation in the z direction if the temperature gradient across the 

cylinder thickness is to be considered. 

Of special interest is the fact that multidimensional GFs can be obtained from 

the multiplication of one-dimensional GF in all cartesian cases and in some cases for 

cylindrical coordinates, namely if the problem involves only the (r, z, t) variables (i.e. if 

the problem has azimuthal symmetry), as is the case in the problem under study:

Both GF expressions above involve infinite series, raising numerical issues 

associated with the solution of infinite series solutions, which can have slow 

convergence that render obtaining accurate numerical values difficult and can lead to 

lengthy computer evaluation time due to the large number of terms to be evaluated. 

The latter are an issue in heat conduction, especially if many temperature values (in 

space or time) or high numerical accuracy are needed. 

Every infinite series must be truncated to a finite number of terms when 

evaluated numerically on a computer. The number of terms determines the accuracy of 

the numerical result but the number of terms required for accurate evaluation can vary 

with time and location within the body and this non-uniform convergence makes 

difficult a beforehand estimate of how many terms of the series are necessary. The use 

of a fixed number of terms, for example for the purpose of evaluating temperature 

variations over time in several locations, risks poor accuracy in some locations and a 

waste of computer time in others. Thus, a convergence criterion is needed to choose the 

number of terms, at any location and time, to provide a predetermined accuracy 

without wasting computer cycles. 

When the series contains an exponential factor the most usual convergence 

criterion is to specify the maximum allowable absolute value of the time-exponential 

argument, which decreases monotonically and dominates the convergence behaviour in 

the aforementioned series. Tracking the value of the argument is a conservative way of 



62 

 

controlling convergence but is possible to apply ahead of time in order to specify the 

number of necessary series terms. The convergence criterion is to continue to add terms 

to the series until the argument of the exponential factor exceeds a maximum set value.  

Expressions for both GR01 and GZ22 include time-exponential arguments in the 

form e-A where A is either ?2?(t - ?)/a2 or j2?2?(t - ?)/b2. Their presence multiplying by 

all other terms in each series causes rapid numerical convergence of the series for large 

Fourier numbers (or dimensionless times) Fo = ?(t - ?)/a2 and ?(t - ?)/b2. The 

convergence criterion can be used to determine the number of series terms needed for 

accurate evaluation of temperatures, terms being added until A &gt; Kmax, where Kmax is 

the maximum allowable absolute value of the exponential argument. This determines 

the size of the exponential factor and controls the convergence speed.  

Consider the example of GZ22, dimensionless times are usually considered large if 

?t/b2 &gt; 0.025 for this type of GF [Cole et al. 2010]. The exponential term will be 

smaller than 0.001 when the absolute value of the argument is greater than Kmax = 6.9, 

i.e.: 

 

 
2

m
2

6.9
t

b

??
&gt; .  (2.18) 

 

In this case ?m = j?, so the above relation yields Nmax= 9 for Fo = 0.001, meaning that 

only eight terms of the infinite series are necessary to make the exponential factor 

smaller than 0.001. If ?t/b2 = 0.025 only five terms are necessary, and for “large” 

values of ?t/b2 (such as 0.17 or larger) only the first term is necessary [Cole et al. 

2010]. 

It should be noted that the GF method, as discussed above, yields analytical 

expressions for temperatures over times and locations for a given set of initial 

conditions, sink terms and boundary conditions, that can be expressed in numerical 

terms if necessary values such as temperatures, coordinates or times are supplied. In 

order to perform the computations required by the Green’s Function Solution Equation 

(GFSE), analytical forms of the initial temperature field, the sink term and the 



63 

 

boundary conditions in terms of time and spatial coordinates are necessary so that they 

can be used as input in the GFSE for performing integrations.  

While the GF formulation is potentially extremely useful, it does have some 

limitations that must be kept in mind, namely when variable boundary conditions or 

source/sink terms are to be considered. Such a situation would lead to the use of 

analytical functions of time and spatial variables that would require updating as 

necessary, since in the case under discussion the sink term will be constant neither in 

time nor in location. Its magnitude is a function of the difference between local and 

transpiration flow temperatures (even if the latter is assumed to be constant). This 

means that for arbitrarily short times solutions will probably be fairly accurate. 

Nonetheless, their accuracy will diminish if the sink term is not updated. This difficulty 

can be overcome by applying GFSE in an incremental approach, implementing an 

iterative calculation procedure that can be described as follows: 

1. Adequate GFs are selected; 

2. A grid of points is defined for calculation purposes in spatial coordinates; 

3. Boundary conditions are specified; 

4. An initial temperature field is specified as an analytical function of space 

coordinates and time t; 

5. The grid and the initial temperature field are used for computing an 

initial sink term, based on the temperature difference between the solid 

and the transpiration airflow and features such as hole diameter and plate 

thickness. Once again an analytical function of space coordinates and time 

t is sought; 

6. A number of summation terms is specified; 

7. A timestep is selected; 

8. Temperatures as a function of initial temperature fields and sink terms are 

computed for t = timestep; 

9. Updated analytical temperature fields and sink term functions, or if 

necessary/applicable boundary conditions, are obtained from calculated 

point temperature and coordinates. 



64 

 

The process is repeated until either a maximum number of iterations (i.e. a 

total time) are performed or some other termination criterion is met, such as minimum 

temperature variations between iterations, as shown in Figure 2.1. 

This iterative process and updating of boundary and sink terms is not 

encountered in most literature references given the fact that those applications deal 

with constant boundary and source/sink terms, the case of successive heating and 

cooling cycles being the only notable exception [Talati and Jalalifar 2009]. The 

reasonability of such an approach must therefore be carefully considered, especially 

when intrinsically iterative methods such as transient finite differences can be 

considered as alternatives, as discussed below.

2.2.3 Finite Difference Formulation 

A typical finite difference formulation typically involves the approximation of 

differential increments in temperature and space coordinates, once an adequate element 

grid of nodes has been defined. This numerical approach replaces the continuous

temperature distribution by fictitious heat conducting rods connecting nodal points 

where heat flux balances are established and where heat generation terms can be 

considered. 

 For multidimensional transient problems approaches such as Heisler charts or 

products solutions are adequate in some cases, especially for regular-shaped solids. 

Unfortunately many geometric shapes of interest do not fall into these categories, and 

boundary conditions may vary with time, rendering a mathematical solution potentially 

impossible and a computational numerical technique necessary. Such problems can be 

set up using the resistance concept for describing heat transfer between nodes.  

 The thermal resistance concept is widely used and can be thought of as the 

ratio between a driving potential and the corresponding heat transfer rate. The thermal 

resistance for conduction is usually given as: 

 

 
t,cond

L
R

kA
= ,  (2.19) 

 

where L is the spatial distance, A the area and k the thermal conductivity, while for 

convection the following expression is used: 

 

 
t,conv

1
R

hA
= ,  (2.20) 

 

where h is the convection heat transfer coefficient. 

 Radiation is a somewhat more complex matter. While the radiation heat flux 

from hot surroundings to a colder surface is usually written as: 

 

 ( )4 4rad sur sq A T T??= ? ,  (2.21) 
 

where ? is the surface emissivity and ? is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, it can also be 

expressed as: 

 



66 

 

 ( )rad sur srq h A T T= ? ,  (2.22) 
 

with a radiation heat transfer coefficient in the form: 

 

 ( )( )2 2r sur s sur sh T T T T?? ? ?= + +? ?? ? .  (2.23) 
 

Here the radiative transfer is modelled in a manner similar to convection in the sense 

that it is linearized, making the heat exchange proportional to a temperature difference 

rather than to the difference between two temperatures to the fourth power. It should 

however be noted that hr strongly depends on temperature while the temperature 

dependence of the convection heat transfer coefficient h is generally weak. A thermal 

resistance for radiation can nevertheless be written as: 

 

 
t,rad

r

Designating a node of interest with the subscript i and adjoining nodes with 

subscript j, the steady-state input to node i will be zero, that is:

where qi is the heat delivered to node i by heat generation, radiation, etc., while Rij can 

take the form of convection boundaries, internal conduction, etc.  

The specification of volume element ?V and internal nodal resistances is 

straightforward for cartesian coordinates, especially when the grid consists of equally-

spaced increments ?x, ?y and ?z. For the case under consideration, with its 

cylindrical coordinate system, internal nodal resistances and volume element ?V can be 

summarized as listed in Table 2.1:

Once steady-state problems are set up, a system of equations is constructed and 

can be solved for nodal temperatures using matrix inversion techniques or, more 

typically when the number of nodes becomes larger, Gauss-Seidel iterations applied by 

solving for temperature Ti in terms of the resistances and temperatures of adjoining 

nodes Tj as:

The procedure usually involves the specification of an initial set of values for Ti 

obtained by any adequate method, which are then used to recalculate nodal 

temperatures. The process continues until temperature variations between iterations 

are arbitrarily small.  

When the problem of interest is transient, the net energy transfer into the node 

must be evidenced as an increase in internal energy of the node, which when expressed 



68 

 

in terms of specific heat and temperature leads to an approximation for its rate of 

change in time from instant t to t+1 as:

Such formulations can be developed on the basis of a forward-difference 

technique, in that the temperature of a node at a future time increment is expressed in 

terms of the surrounding nodal temperatures at the beginning of the time increment. In 

this case the expressions are called explicit formulations because it is possible to write 

nodal temperatures explicitly in terms of the previous nodal temperatures. In this 

formulation, the calculation proceeds directly from one time increment to the next until 

the temperature distribution is calculated at the desired final state. 

The difference equation may also be formulated by computing the space 

derivatives in terms of the temperatures at the t+1 increment. Such an arrangement is 

called a backward-difference formulation because the time derivative moves backward 

from the times for heat conduction into the node. This backward-difference formulation 

does not permit the explicit calculation of Tt+1 in terms of Tt. Rather, a whole set of 

equations must be written for the entire nodal system and solved simultaneously to 

determine temperatures Tt+1, so the backward-difference method produces an implicit 

formulation for the future temperatures in the transient analysis. 



69 

 

The advantage of an explicit forward-difference procedure is the direct 

calculation of future nodal temperatures. However, the stability of this calculation is 

governed by the selection of the values of space and time increments. On the one hand, 

a selection of a small value of space increment automatically forces the selection of 

some maximum value of time increment. On the other hand, no such restriction is 

imposed on the solution of the equations which are obtained from the implicit 

formulation. This means that larger time increments can be selected to speed up the 

calculation. The obvious disadvantage of the implicit method is the larger number of 

calculations for each time step. For problems involving a large number of nodes, 

however, the implicit method may result in less total computer time expended for the 

final solution because very small time increments may have to be imposed in the 

explicit method from stability requirements. Much larger time increments can be 

employed with the implicit method to speed the solution. 

The time increment necessary to ensure stability is usually given as [Holman

As mentioned above, heat generation (or heat sinks, as needed in the present 

case) and radiation phenomena can be accounted for with term qi, while convection 

boundaries are treated in the same way as internal conduction. Given the method’s 

iterative approach, it is always possible to update sink terms, convection and radiation 

between iterations, adjusting their magnitude with the nodal temperatures calculated in 



70 

 

all iterations. This is especially relevant concerning radiation, given its strongly non-

linear nature. 

Regarding the implementation of finite differences, the iterative calculation 

procedure that can be described as follows: 

1. A grid of points is defined for calculation purposes in spatial coordinates; 

2. Nodal resistances, element volumes, sink terms and thermal capacities are 

calculated; 

3. An initial temperature field is specified as nodal temperatures; 

4. The stability criterion is applied in order to determine the minimum time 

increment; 

5. New nodal temperatures are computed for t = ?tmin; 

6. Updated sink terms and radiation resistances obtained if necessary; 

7. The process is repeated until either a maximum number of iterations (i.e. 

a total time) are performed or some other termination criterion is met, 

such as minimum temperature variations between iterations. 

This process can be summarized as illustrated in Figure 2.2. 

When the transpiration airflow is reset at its initial mass flow, the transient 

temperature curve will decrease back towards its initial value dictated by the incident 

radiative flux but especially by the transpiration airflow, at a rate (i.e. slope) that will 

be a function of the magnitude of both factors and that can also be quantified. 

2.3 Assumptions and Simplifications 

A proper methodology needed to be established in order to implement both the GF 

method and the finite difference approach. Despite the fact that the GF library lists a 

number of readily available analytical formulations, these must nevertheless be 

adequately used by setting up a solution to the conduction problem under study, and 

all necessary operations must be performed in order to obtain temperature values for all 

locations and times of interest. 



71 

 

 

Figure 2.2 – Iterative finite difference calculation methodology. 

 

In order to use both the GF method and finite differences as a basis for the 

study and development of a heat flux meter, it was felt necessary to gain more precise 

insight into their results in an incremental fashion. This was done by comparing results 

of both approaches with those obtained with equivalent CFD simulations of the same 

physical problem, including heat sink terms, radiation and convection. 

At this point the question of whether a one-dimensional approach was adequate 

in describing the problem needed to be addressed, in order to proceed with parametric 

studies. As mentioned earlier an assumption of azimuthal symmetry is reasonable for 

the case under discussion, given its geometry and boundary conditions. Thus, a fully 

three-dimensional approach would be unnecessary, but more importantly the sensing 

element’s small thickness (much smaller than its diameter) could render conduction 

one-dimensional in radial direction and lead to a much simpler approach by ignoring 

temperature gradients along the element’s thickness. 

This was exactly the basis for the analytical model developed for Gardon gauges 

[Gardon 1953]. Their sensing elements typically have thicknesses ranging from as low as 

0.05 to 0.2 mm (hence the frequently used designation of “thin foil”). Given the fact

that some of the robustness of earlier transpiration radiometers was to be retained, and 

besides dimensioning considerations discussed in some detail in Chapter 3, a thickness 

value of around 0.1 mm was considered adequate. Other applications of 

microperforated steel plates were found (including, oddly enough, espresso machine 

filters) with thicknesses around the same value that exhibited satisfactory mechanical 

resistance.  

As discussed below in Chapter 3, common manufacturing processes such as 

photoetching place a limitation on the range of hole diameter to plate thickness ratio, 

rendering impractical holes with diameters smaller than the plate thickness. For the 

intended range of sensing element diameters (around 10 mm), hundreds of 0.1 mm 

holes can nevertheless be fitted in order to preserve the transpiration principle, and the 

question of whether a one-dimensional approximation to the behaviour of the sensing 

element can be settled by examining the plate’s Biot number. Biot numbers are usually 

calculated as: 

 

 cBi
hL

k
=   (2.32) 

 

where h is the convection heat transfer coefficient, k is the thermal conductivity and Lc 

is a characteristic length that is often indicated as a solid’s volume to surface area ratio 

but can also be, for simple geometries, a radius or a thickness. For lumped analysis 

validity purposes the criterion is usually to regard it as valid when Bi &amp;lt;0.1. 

While thermal conductivity is at most dependent on temperature, the 

convection heat transfer coefficient is strongly dependent on the airflow velocity on the 

surface. In order to roughly evaluate which Biot numbers are to be expected, thermal 

conductivity is assumed to be on the lower side of the range of values for stainless steel 

(typically ranging between 13 and 19 WK-1m-1), while for simplicity in a rough 

approach convection coefficients can be assumed to be those of air in forced convection 

found in standard textbook tables (up to 200 WK-1m-2), although as discussed in detail 

below the determination of convection coefficients is a much more complicated matter 

and will be performed with adequate care later on. Suffice to say for the moment that 



73 

 

actual convection coefficients for the application under discussion will be typically 

higher than those used for these Biot number calculations. 

If a Biot number is calculated based on plate thickness (0.1 mm) and radius 

(4.75 mm, as will be explained in Chapter 3) as characteristic lengths, Biot numbers 

would be Bi = 0.0015 and Bi = 0.076 respectively. An Lc characteristic length can more 

properly be defined and used to calculate a solid’s volume to surface area ratio. If a 9.5 

mm total diameter, 0.1 mm hole diameters and 0.1 mm plate thickness are used, the 

following Biot numbers are obtained as a function of the number of holes: 

Table 2.2 – Plate Biot number as a function of the number of holes. 

Number of Holes 250 500 750 1000 

Biot Number 0.00071 0.00067 0.00064 0.00061 

 

These are hardly surprising considering the plate’s very low thickness and can 

arguably be even lower if effects that have to do with convection enhancing phenomena 

are considered, as will be discussed in further detail below. 

All Biot numbers in Table 2.2 are below the conventional Bi &amp;lt;0.1 limit where 

lumped analysis is deemed reasonable but values for the radial direction are without 

surprise larger than those for thickness, where the very low Biot number values 

indicate negligible temperature gradients, make a one-dimensional approximation 

reasonable and greatly simplify obtaining accurate models for describing the sensing 

element’s behaviour and testing and verifying results for both approaches. 

The selection of an adequate value for the convection coefficient is of the utmost 

importance while being somewhat more complicated than apparent at first sight and 

certainly not as simple as used values tabulated in textbooks. 

Standard heat transfer references often list relationships meant to be used for 

developing or fully developed flows. If heating is occurring at the surface of a tube 

through which a fluid is flowing, Nusselt numbers and heat transfer coefficients are 

highest at the inlet, where boundary layer thicknesses are smallest, and decrease 

gradually towards fully developed values. These effects are usually described by 



74 

 

defining an entry length, defined as the distance from the entrance where relevant 

variables reach within 2% of their fully developed values. Laminar flows show strong 

dependency on the Reynolds number and lead to entry length values as high as 115 

times the diameter, while turbulent flows entry lengths’ are much shorter and less 

dependent on Reynolds numbers. However, in many flows of practical interest entrance 

effects only become insignificant beyond lengths higher than 10 diameters. 

Furthermore, Nusselt numbers for uniform surface temperatures and uniform heat flux 

conditions are nearly identical in the entrance regions [Çengel 2006].  

Given the plate’s very low thickness, the lateral areas of individual holes are 

very low, so that the relationships for entry regions have a limited applicability even if 

several hundreds of holes are to be considered. These small lateral areas also raise the 

question of determining the precise nature of the convection interaction of the 

transpiration airflow with the perforated plate. Since the transpiration airflow is 

expected to be colder than the surroundings and the plate, heat will be removed by 

convection not only in the microperforated pattern but also (and potentially mostly) on 

the windward face of the perforated plate, on which the incoming transpiration airflow 

impinges. The magnitude of this heat transfer will be a function of the surface areas 

and the local temperature difference between the air and each surface, besides the local 

convective heat transfer coefficient that can be influenced by geometry and flow 

conditions.  

While single hole relationships are useful and important in understanding the 

nature of the convective interaction between the airflow impinging on a perforated 

surface and the holes themselves [Sparrow and Gurdal 1981, Cho et al. 1997], other 

parameters have greater importance as far as perforated patterns are concerned. The 

matter of considering a repetitive pattern is nevertheless fundamental since this regular 

geometry gives rise to a symmetry pattern whereby each hole is surrounded by a region 

where symmetry surfaces exist as its boundaries. Within each such unit cell, the heat 

transfer and fluid flow characteristics are identical to those of all the other cells that 

blanket the surface, so that measurements for a single cell yield information for the 

entire surface [Sparrow and Ortiz 1982], as can be seen from the illustration in Figure 

2.3. 

 



75 

 

 

Figure 2.3 – Fluid flow passing from the upstream surface into the perforated pattern [Sparrow 

and Ortiz 1982]. 

 

Although it was found that the influence of the hole length-to-diameter ratio 

has significance, it was shown that the appropriate heat transfer area for the 

determination of the heat-transfer coefficient is essentially that of the hole-approach 

flow [Andrews et al. 1991]. Various studies showed that correlations for Nusselt and 

Reynolds numbers using a convection coefficient based solely on the hole internal 

surface area did not adequately correlate the experimental results, indicating that 

internal hole heat transfer was not the dominant physical process. The use of the hole 

approach surface area to define convective heat transfer coefficient resulted in a good 

correlation of the results, indicating that the hole approach convective heat transfer 

was the dominant heat transfer process [Andrews et al. 1988]. 

The importance of the hole spacing-to-diameter ratio is therefore fundamental in 

the determination of heat transfer coefficients since it influences the acceleration of the 

airflow when transitioning from its incoming bulk velocity to the faster flowing airflow 

towards and inside the holes. Correlations for a variety of situations and geometries 

have been developed, typically relying on experimental results and considering a large 

variety of Reynolds numbers, up to 20,000 [Sparrow and Ortiz 1982, Dorignac et al. 

2005, Fenot et al. 2005].  

As discussed in further detail in Chapter 3, a 2.5 spacing-to-diameter ratio was 

eventually selected due to boundary layer control and radiation transmissivity 

considerations. This led to a perforated pattern with 0.1 mm holes with a 0.25 mm 



76 

 

spacing, and interestingly some of the correlations mentioned above are available for 

the exact 2.5 spacing-to-diameter ratios of interest in the present work [Sparrow and 

Ortiz 1982], although this was actually only realised after the dimensioning procedures 

discussed in Chapter 3 were carried out and components had been manufactured 

according to those specifications.   

While these correlations were admittedly obtained with somewhat larger holes 

than those under discussion (with diameters ranging from 1 to 10 mm), the fact that 

the diameters to be considered here are smaller is not expected to significantly 

invalidate such relationships since recent experimental results show that airflow 

characteristics in microtubes (i.e. for somewhat lower diameters than those considered 

here), namely heat transfer correlations for laminar and turbulent flows, are the same 

as for larger tubes if the higher velocities related to smaller diameter and possible 

compressibility phenomena are duly taken into account [Yang et al. 2012]. 

The aforementioned correlations propose Nusselt numbers based on different 

assumptions regarding characteristic lengths. An earlier study proposes that the Nusselt 

number can be determined as [Sparrow and Ortiz 1982]: 

 

 
1 30.486Nu 0.881Re Pr=   (2.33) 

 

with Pr being the Prandtl number (which for air is approximately 0.7) and defining the 

Reynolds number Re as a function of density ?, air velocity v, hole diameter d and 

dynamic viscosity µ: 

 

 Re
vd?

µ
=   (2.34) 

 

and writing the Nusselt number as: 

 

 Nu
hA

ek
=   (2.35) 

 



77 

 

where h is the convection coefficient, k is the thermal conductivity of air, A is the area 

of the surface that participates in the heat transfer process (i.e. the unit cell area minus 

that of the holes) and e is the hole spacing. This means that this Nusselt number is 

based on a characteristic length that is the ratio of geometric features rather than an 

individual constant of the pattern, and that different characteristic lengths are used in 

the Reynolds and Nusselt numbers. 

 Other studies extended the work presented in the earlier reference mainly by 

using a larger variety of spacing-to-diameter ratios (from 1.7 up to 9.6), using an 

alternative formulation for the Nusselt and Reynolds numbers based on the same 

characteristic length A/e and expressing the Nusselt number as a function of the 

Reynolds number and unit cell parameters, yielding in each hole:

with results within 10% of all experimental measurements [Dorignac et al. 2005]. The 

earlier formulation was used mainly for compactness. 

These formulations allow the calculation of a convection heat transfer coefficient 

to be used both in a volumetric heat sink term and in the convective boundary 

encountered on the windward side of the plate, in terms of an incoming air mass flow. 

This in turn enables the study of the effect of varying mass flows passing through the 

perforated pattern, of which the convection coefficient will be a function. 

It is therefore necessary to obtain a relationship between the incoming 

transpiration mass flows, which can be characterized in terms of their pressures, 

densities, temperatures and velocities, and the velocities in the holes and resulting 

Reynolds and Nusselt numbers and therefore convection coefficients. All this for any 



78 

 

given perforated pattern, especially as far as its hole diameter-to-spacing ratio is 

concerned since it dictates heat transfer areas. 

At this point it is a reasonable to assume that all the incoming compressed air 

passes through the holes in the perforated pattern, although in practice some leakage is 

expected at the fringe of the plate if some less than perfect welding is present. 

Nevertheless, this assumed mass continuity can be expressed as: 

 

 
1 2

m m=? ? ,  (2.38) 

 

where 
1

m?  is the mass flow in the compressed air feed tube and 
2

m?  is the sum of mass 

flows in the N holes of the pattern, i.e.: 

 

 
2 2

1 2
1 1 2 24 4

d d
v N v
? ?

? ?=   (2.39) 

 

where ?, v and d are densities, velocities and diameters, respectively. This equation can 

be simplified and rearranged by multiplying and dividing each side of the equation by 

the relevant dynamic viscosity, obtaining the following relationship where Reynolds 

numbers are made to appear: 

 

 
1 1 1 2 2 2

Re Red N dµ µ= .  (2.40) 

 

Given the fact that the plate is a rather poor heat exchanger due to its low 

thickness and relatively low surface area, and that relatively high mass flows are to be 

used in order to ensure boundary layer blow-off, the bulk of the transpiration airflow is 

not expected to heat up significantly, even when considering a temperature increase 

due to compression in the holes. This means that viscosity variations due to 

temperature differences are assumed to not be significant and allow writing the 

Reynolds number in the holes as: 

 

 1 1
h 2

2

Re
Re Re

d

Nd
= = .  (2.41) 



79 

 

Once Reynolds numbers for the holes are known, the Nusselt number 

correlations above can be used to compute various convection coefficients, as intended. 

A certain incoming mass flow is a function of the tube area, the airflow velocity and its 

pressure, and it is always possible to obtain a desired mass flow by any combination of 

such parameters. In practice, constraints are usually posed in terms of a fixed feed line 

diameter (and therefore flow area) and a compressed air supply pressure. Operational 

parameters are described in detail in Chapter 3, when the dimensioning of the 

perforated plate and the setting of operation conditions are discussed. Within the 

framework of developing an adequate formulation for the sensing element such detail is 

unnecessary and some parameters were fixed, namely the compressed airflow cross 

section and the supply pressure. 

Given the plate’s very low thickness, the question of whether to consider the 

lateral area of the holes in the perforated pattern for convective heat transfer purposes 

could be thought of as secondary, but that assumption does require some careful 

consideration. The plate’s effective frontal area can be calculated as the difference 

between its actual frontal area and the area of each hole multiplied by the number of 

holes, while the total hole lateral area is the perimeter of each hole multiplied by the 

number of holes and the plate thickness. If a plate diameter of 9.5 mm and a 0.1 mm 

hole diameter equal to the plate thickness, the area ratio can be calculated as shown in 

Table 2.3. 

Table 2.3 – Plate areas as a function of the number of holes. 

Number of holes 250 500 750 1000 

Effective frontal area [m2] 6.89×10-5 6.70×10-5 6.50×10-5 6.30×10-5 

Hole lateral area [m2] 7.85×10-6 1.57×10-5 2.36×10-5 3.14×10-5 

Area ratio 8.77 4.26 2.76 2.00 

Total area [m2] 7.68×10-5 8.27×10-5 8.86×10-5 9.44×10-5 

 

While the frontal area of the plate is obviously higher than the sum of the 

lateral areas of the holes, the contribution of the latter naturally rises as their number 

increases. When the number of holes is in the order of a thousand, as will happen in 



80 

 

the prototype, the frontal area of the plate is still double that of the holes, but it was 

felt necessary to take the hole area into account by adding it to the frontal area when 

used in the aforementioned relationships for the determination of the convective 

coefficient. 

As the diameter of the compressed air supply, the same value as earlier was 

used, i.e. 9.5 mm, while a supply pressure of 5 bar was specified since it is the standard 

supply pressure at the laboratory where the experimental work was to be conducted, 

and a supply temperature of 25ºC was also assumed. Likewise, using the 

aforementioned assumption that the bulk of the airflow will not heat up significantly in 

contact with the plate, Prandtl numbers and air thermal conductivities were taken to 

be those at 25ºC. 

Convective heat transfer coefficients could thus be calculated as a function of 

incoming air mass flows, representing the actual physical situation to be encountered 

by the prototype when in operation. It should be noted that the aforementioned 

correlations for Nusselt numbers use the full area of the unit cell rather than a value 

that subtracts the frontal area of the holes. However, this correction was considered 

relevant when using the correlation, so that the total area values in Table 2.3 were 

used in the calculations. The fact that the correlations were obtained for a range of 

spacing-to-diameter ratios (2.0 and 2.5 for the version used) means that for a given 

plate frontal area a large number of holes is necessary to fulfil the ratio requirement, 

meaning that the areas for small numbers of holes were not used because they would 

potentially translate a situation outside the bounds of the correlations’ validity. 

Furthermore, as discussed in Chapter 3, a low number of holes in the pattern would 

lead to poor flow uniformity and low transmissivity that could have detrimental effects 

on the sensing element’s intended performance. Values for 1000 holes are for the 

moment sufficiently representative for model development purposes. 

Illustrated in Figure 2.4 is the Nusselt number as a function of the Reynolds 

number, using both of the aforementioned relationships, i.e. the earlier one embodied in 

the upper curve of black circles [Sparrow and Ortiz 1982] compared to values resulting 

from the application of the latter work [Dorignac et al. 2005], for hole diameter between 

1 and 15 mm and hole spacing/diameter ratios ranging from 1.7 to 9.6.

The plot in Figure 2.5 illustrates the same numbers calculated using the values 

and assumptions discussed above. The graphic in Figure 2.6 illustrates the relationship 

between incoming mass airflow and the convection heat transfer coefficient on the 

plate, where as expected the power function adjusted from calculated values, i.e.: 

 

 0.48645654h m= ? .  (2.42) 

 

The same 0.486 exponent as in Equation 2.33 is displayed.

Although different criteria where used in the definition of which particular area 

should be used, Nusselt numbers are approximately the same for the same Reynolds 

numbers, although the calculated values lie mostly outside the range of Reynolds 

numbers shown from the references. This is not necessarily surprising given the fact 

that somewhat a smaller perforated pattern is considered here, so that the Reynolds 

number will be higher for similar total mass flows. 

Within the framework under discussion and for the same reason encountered in 

the field of mechanics of materials, a 60º staggered pattern (also known as an 

hexagonal pattern given the fact that any node is surrounded by six others in an 

hexagonal arrangement) was used in preference to a square pattern since it guarantees 

an isotropic distribution in the plane of the plate, while for instance a square pattern 

would lead to an orthotropic behaviour [Dowling 1999]. While the earlier of the 

references cited when calculating convection coefficients relied on the 60º staggered 

pattern [Sparrow and Ortiz 1982], the other also studied the square pattern [Dorignac 

et al. 2005]. Illustrated in Figure 2.7 is the hexagonal pattern of unit cells considered in 

the earlier study, showing the unit cell’s pitch (the same as spacing e considered in the 

present work) and diameter.

The same pattern was used in the remainder of the work described here but in a 

different fashion for plate transmissivity calculations. The pattern can also be thought 

of as an equilateral triangle with a hole at each vertex, and area calculations using 

triangular elements are slightly more simple than for hexagons, while the holes merely 

dictate a need to divide their perimeter, each hole having only one sixth of its 

perimeter and area within a particular cell, the same as saying that a single hole in the 

pattern belongs to six different units. 

 

Figure 2.7 – Hexagonal unit cell pattern [Sparrow and Ortiz 1982]. 

 

Such considerations are relevant in terms of finite differences in order to 

compute element surface areas sink terms for heat transfer. The thermal resistance 

formulations in Equations 2.29 to 2.34 require element areas for conductive, convective 

and radiative heat transfer, and plate thickness L, hole diameters d and their spacing e 

dictate unit cell volumes and heat transfer areas, as summarized in Table 2.4. 

Regarding the specification of element areas in the resistance formulations, it is 

proposed to consider the upper surface of the element for radiative heat transfer, while 

for convective transfer, given the plate’s very low thickness, the area to be considered 

will be that of the lower surface of the element plus the lateral area of the holes. This 

effectively means that the volumetric heat sink term is converted into a superficial 

resistance term that no longer needs to be taken into account in term qi of Equations 

2.35, 2.36, 2.39 and 2.41. This only occurs for this very particular situation where a 



84 

 

thin plate is being considered and a convection coefficient was determined for the whole 

of the perforated pattern.

If the assumption of the same convection coefficient for the windward face of 

the elements and for the interior of the holes was not considered reasonable, as could be 

the case for a much thicker plate, a volumetric sink term (in Wm-3) could nevertheless 

be readily calculated from a properly calculated convection coefficient by specifying an 

interfacial area density Dsink (in m
-1) for each particular unit cell, as the ratio between 

the area for convective heat transfer within the holes in that cell (m2) and the unit cell 

volume (m3). This density parameter would be constant for each particular unit cell 

and the same throughout the total volume of the component, unless specified otherwise. 

Once a thickness and the unit cell parameters were selected, the interfacial area density 

could be defined and allow the calculation of the area over which the convective heat 

sink would take effect using relationship: 

 

 
sink sink

A D V= ?   (2.43) 

 



85 

 

where ?V is the element volume. The volumetric convective heat sink can be defined 

using Newton’s law of cooling in the form: 

 

 ( )sink node air sinkg h T T D? = ?   (2.44) 
 

where is h is the convection coefficient for the airflow through the holes, Tnode is the 

nodal temperature and Tair is the temperature of the airflow. 

It should be kept in mind that the sink term above merely describes the amount 

of heat that is removed from the plate by convection due to the temperature difference 

between the transpiration airflow and the perforated pattern, but that the magnitude 

of the temperatures in the plate is ultimately dictated not only by convection but also 

by the radiative interaction between the sensing element’s surface and its hot 

surroundings, via the radiative source’s area and emissivity and the element’s own 

reflectivity, emissivity and transmissivity. 

Rather than introducing the relevant element areas explicitly in the resistance 

formulations using the cumbersome relationships listed in Table 2.5, these can be used 

to specify element area and volume correction factors to the frontal area A. This is 

done both for the element radiative heat transfer areas in the form: 

 

 
corr rad

A A? = ,  (2.45) 

 

where A the element frontal area. Likewise, a correction factor can be defined for the 

convective exchange in the form: 

 

 
corr conv

A A? = ,  (2.46) 

 

while a corrected volume for element heat capacity correction can also be defined as: 

 

 
corr corr

V V? ? = ? ,  (2.47) 

 



86 

 

where ?V is the element volume. This value is expected to be the same as for the 

radiative heat transfer area correction factor given the fact that the corrected volume is 

merely the effective (i.e. corrected) area multiplied by the plate thickness. 

Once the unit cell parameters are set, the correction factors can be determined 

from the relationships in Table 2.4. Using the aforementioned values of 0.1 mm for the 

hole diameter and plate thickness and of 0.25 mm for the hole spacing, the correction 

factors become:

As expected the correction factors for the radiation area and the volume are the 

same and take into account the diminution in frontal area and volume due to the holes, 

yielding values lower than unity, while the correction factor for convection is higher 

because of the sum of the lateral area of the holes to the effective frontal area, as was 

previously discussed and is shown in Table 2.4. 

It should be noted that this definition of a radiative transfer area where a 

difference between blockage and opening areas is implied is essentially the same as 

taking into account a transmissivity term, which means that the application of this 

radiative area correction factor inherently takes into account this radiative property of 

the element that is extended to the total area of the plate. 

The discussion above is furthermore useful in another situation, which has to do 

with the boundary layer blow-off phenomenon. If the transpiration mass flows are 

insufficient to eliminate the boundary layer on the side of the plate exposed to the high 

temperature surroundings, some convection heat transfer will take place and the same 

area considered for radiative heat exchange must be considered for this convective 

transfer, effectively introducing another resistance at each computational node. This 



87 

 

effect was duly taken into account when comparing situations where relatively low 

transpiration mass flows were used. 

2.4 Implementation and Results 

Calculations with the GF and finite differences methods were implemented using 

Wolfram Mathematica 8, while CFD simulations were performed using ANSYS, namely 

its CFX module. 

The purpose of such comparisons warrants some further discussion as far as 

their motivation is concerned. It could be argued that the commercial CFD software 

could be used with confidence given its established reputation in a wide range of 

applications and previous experience, even as far as the author and supervisor of the 

present document are concerned, and that the complexities related to the development 

of the aforementioned analytical and numerical approaches would thus be rendered 

unnecessary. Operational prototypes could thus be designed and built, their 

performance and output being subsequently compared with the CFD model and its 

results, without bothering with complex analytical formulations. 

The use of the CFD software was always intended for design purposes, not only 

regarding the sensing element itself but especially when considering the overall 

instrument as a system consisting of various components, rather than merely as a 

sensing element. 

This does not mean that proper analytical and numerical methodologies would 

not be useful, going beyond a mere unwillingness to use a commercial tool without a 

more detailed theoretical understanding of the underlying phenomena. 

While undoubtedly more detailed in terms of the range of phenomena and 

models than can be implemented and studied, CFD software does require the 

specification of particular geometric features of the systems to be studied, as for 

instance the diameter and pitch of a particular perforated plate. This is typically done 

either directly in a CAD module of the CFD package or by importing the necessary 

files from dedicated CAD software, after which the finite element mesh is created for 

computation purposes. 



88 

 

Parametric studies of geometry changes can thus be rendered somewhat 

cumbersome in terms of methodology due to this need for creating new geometry files. 

Furthermore, precisely because CFD software typically implements a variety of 

physical models in great detail, simulations can take significant amounts of time to run. 

 The methodologies proposed and discussed above can potentially reduce the 

computational effort involved, at least for the type of geometry of interest, since 

parametric tests regarding various perforation parameters can be conducted merely by 

adjusting the unit cell parameters listed in Table 2.4, while various operational 

conditions can be simulated by specifying relevant temperatures in the boundary 

conditions and airflows or calculating convection coefficients using the correlation of 

Equation 2.42, rather than creating new CAD geometries to be imported and meshed 

into the CFD software. Relevant information about the behaviour of the sensing 

element such as temperature spatial distributions, transient variations or time 

constants ?, can thus be obtained at a fraction of the computational effort. 

The choice for Mathematica came naturally since it is the foremost 

computational software program used in scientific and engineering technical computing, 

including relevant features such as mathematical function libraries (such as the Bessel 

functions and their zeros for GR01 calculation), support for symbolic computation and 

numeric and symbolic tools for calculus, two- and three-dimensional data and function 

visualization tools, solvers for various differential equation types and a programming 

language supporting procedural, functional and object oriented constructs. 

On the other hand, the choice for ANSYS  is equally self-evident, given its pre-

eminence as a numerical simulation and analysis tool, namely in terms of CFD and 

especially now that CFX and Fluent are both available within a common package. All 

relevant phenomena within the framework of the present discussion, such as fluid flow, 

heat sink terms, convection and radiation heat transfer between hot gases and solid 

surfaces or conduction heat transfer within a solid, could thus be studied. 

Besides the conduction equations within the solids and the fundamental single-

phase fluid flow Navier-Stokes equations employed in standard computational fluid 

dynamics software, the other models implemented in CFX are radiation and turbulence 

models. 



89 

 

Given the low optical thickness of the envisaged application, the selected 

radiation simulation technique was the Discrete Transfer model [Shah 1979]. This 

model is based on tracing the domain by multiple rays leaving from the bounding 

surfaces and depends upon the discretization of the equation of transfer along rays. The 

path along a ray is discretized by using the sections formed from breaking the path at 

element boundaries and the physical quantities in each element are assumed to be 

uniform. These rays have to be traced through the domain in the same way that the 

photons would be tracked in the Monte Carlo model, rendering the model description 

for both Monte Carlo and Discrete Transfer models more or less identical. For the 

results to be accurate the elements must be chosen so that the radiation field is 

reasonably homogeneous inside them. This means, for example, that they must be small 

enough that the scattering optical depth is less than unity across each element. The 

Discrete Transfer model was found to be more computationally efficient than the 

Monte Carlo technique and was thus used. 

Regarding turbulence, one of the most prominent turbulence models, the k-? (k-

epsilon) model, has been implemented in most general purpose CFD codes and is 

considered to be the industry standard model. It uses Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes 

equations and has proven to be stable and numerically robust and has a well 

established regime of predictive capability. For general purpose simulations, the k-? 

model offers a good compromise in terms of accuracy and robustness. 

Within CFX, the k-? turbulence model uses the scalable wall-function approach 

to improve robustness and accuracy when the near-wall mesh is very fine. The scalable 

wall functions allow solution on arbitrarily fine near wall grids, which is a significant 

improvement over standard wall functions. 

The wall function method uses empirical formulas that impose suitable 

conditions near to the wall without resolving the boundary layer, thus saving 

computational resources. All turbulence models in CFX are suitable for a wall function 

method. Scalable wall functions overcome one of the major drawbacks of the standard 

wall function approach in that they can be applied on arbitrarily fine meshes. If the 

boundary layer is not fully resolved, the logarithmic wall function approximation to 

model the boundary layer is relied upon without affecting the validity of the scalable 



90 

 

wall function approach. If the details of the boundary layer are not sought then it may 

not be worth fully resolving it. 

All simulations and calculations were carried out on a computer equipped with 

an Intel Core i7 processor at 2.93 GHz clock frequency and 4 MB of RAM, on a 

Windows 7 64-bit operating system. 

Once possible approaches to the problem at hand are identified and reasonable 

assumptions and simplifications are made, the various options can be put to the test 

through an incrementally more detailed procedure. 

The analysis of the various possible Biot numbers indicates that a radial one-

dimensional approach is reasonable given the plate’s low thermal gradients along its 

thickness, greatly simplifying the formulation of the problem both for Green’s functions 

and finite differences. 

As mentioned earlier, a comparison of results with equivalent CFD simulations 

was always intended as means of validating their accuracy. Implied is also the 

comparison between both of the approaches discussed before, if only to rule out the use 

of one in detriment of the other if large discrepancies are verified or if significant 

differences in computational effort become apparent. 

A one-dimensional finite differences approach to the problem takes the form of a 

radial problem where a single element is considered along the plate thickness (i.e. the z 

direction) and with the same height as the plate itself. The one-dimensional, radial 

nature of the problem leads to thinking of the elements as a succession of annular 

regions and setting ?? = 2?, which leads to an isotropic behaviour as far as the 

angular coordinate is concerned, the question of how many elements to consider in the 

radial direction remaining.  

Convective and radiative boundaries are treated as thermal resistances, with the 

temperature imposed by an external refrigeration system specified on the outermost 

node. Generation/sink terms are considered into the qi term of the finite difference 

formulation but, as discussed earlier, the plate’s low thickness enables the treatment of 

heat removed from the element in the holes of the perforated pattern in a convective 

resistance term where it is considered along with the convection on the element’s (and 



91 

 

thus the plate’s) windward face. The discussion above retains the possibility of using a 

volumetric sink term and the finite difference code developed for simulation purposes 

(see Appendix A) can be readily adapted to take into account a variable sink term, 

which indeed remains built into the formulation (albeit as a constant) and will be used 

in the first simple simulations, where various heat sink terms will be considered for 

comparison with the GF and CFD approaches. 

These initial simulations are intended to gain confidence in the approaches in 

situations where anomalous results would be sufficiently clear to stand out and simple 

to analyze. The relative merits of the possible approaches can also be compared with 

ease and decisions regarding their implementation taken with more confidence. 

Regarding the use of the GF approach in a one-dimensional radial approach 

with an imposed temperature Text on the outer radius a, the aforementioned one-

dimensional GR01 function is necessary, that is:

As mentioned before, the implementation of the GFSE in this form can be 

problematic due to numerical convergence issues arising from the non-homogeneous Text 

boundary condition imposed on the outer diameter, so as suggested in references. Thus, 

an alternative solution was tested, where the contribution of the non-homogeneous 

boundary, i.e. the third term on the second member of Equation 2.56, is given as [Cole 

et al. 2010]:

A converged solution employing fewer than 50 terms in the series was found 

using the alternative solution, while for 1000 terms the slower version employing the 

non-homogeneous condition still had not converged. The alternative solution was 

therefore employed in the following calculations. 

A simple one-dimensional radial case can thus be studied using both the GF 

formulation and the finite difference method, and the same study can be easily 

implemented in CFD software, with all the necessary flexibility in terms of geometry 

creation and boundary condition specification, as illustrated in Figure 2.8. 

Figure 2.9 illustrates one of the reasons of the choice of Mathematica as the 

software for implementing Green’s functions. The ease of specification of integrals, sums 

and Bessel functions necessary to the calculations is readily apparent.  

As a starting point for the comparative study, a simple radial conduction case 

was considered, with adiabatic tops as far as the thin plate is concerned, no nodal 

balances due to convection or radiation having to be performed in finite differences and 

no need to perform updating procedures discussed earlier and summarized in Figure 2.1 

needing to be considered for the GF solution. For simplicity, no variations in material 

properties were considered, although this will not be the case later. Properties were 

assumed to be those of stainless steel at ambient temperatures, in all three methods. 

From the variety of tests carried out, two are described and their conditions 

summarized in Table 2.5. As discussed earlier, the negative heat generation term can be 

thought of as heat sink that will lead to an amount of heat to be removed from the 

plate by convection due to the temperature difference between the transpiration airflow 

and the perforated pattern, but that the magnitude of the temperatures in the plate are 

ultimately dictated not only by convection but also by the radiative interaction 

between the sensing element’s surface and its hot surroundings, via the radiative 

source’s area and emissivity and the element’s own reflectivity, emissivity and 

transmissivity.

Transient temperature curves at the centre of the plate (the region where the 

thermocouple will be installed in the prototype) were determined along with radial 

temperature distributions as a function of time at several timesteps. Regarding the 

implementation of GF, this was done by plotting the T(r,t) distribution both as a 

function of radius r and time t. 

Radial temperature distributions in the plate for Case 1 (see Table 2.5) 

obtained using GFSE are shown in Figures 2.10 for times 0.2, 0.5 and 1 s, as well as for 

fully converged steady-state conditions. Shown in Figures 2.11 to 2.13 are comparisons 

of values calculated by all three methods at the same instants, while Figure 2.14 shows 

the transient temperature variation at the centre of the plate calculated by the three 

methods. Figures 2.15 to 2.19 illustrate the same phenomena for Case 2 (see Table 2.5).  

All graphs illustrate the very small differences observed between any of the 

three approaches, and these results are from simulations obtained after mesh 

refinement procedures were carried out both in CFX and for finite differences on one 

hand, and an increase in the number of terms in the sums of the GFSE was found not 

to have a significant impact on result, on the other.

summarized in Figure 2.1 need to be considered for the GF solution, the same 

happening as far as the imposition of fixed generation/sink terms is concerned. The 

question of comparing the accuracy of the GF method results with those of the finite 

differences approach makes sense and its usefulness cannot be questioned from the 

point of view of obtaining analytical insight into the problem. Its separation of effects 

caused by initial temperature fields, generation terms and boundary conditions is 

especially relevant. In these conditions, where the element’s thermal behaviour is 

entirely dictated by the initial temperature field and constant boundary temperatures 

and generation terms, the GF method can be looked upon as an exact analytical 

solution where no manipulations are necessary besides the integrations and sums 

described in Equations 2.52 to 2.57. From this point of view and only for these 

particular conditions, the GF method can be regarded as an analytical benchmark for 

the numerical CFX and finite differences methods. 

As mentioned earlier, the GF method may become inaccurate if variations in 

boundary conditions fail to be taken into account. In the absence of explicit analytical 

descriptions of these variations, some form of updating procedure is necessary. New 

analytical functions for all necessary parameters can be obtained at time intervals short 

enough to ensure that no relevant transient variations are missed, based on energy 

balances at a number of spatial points in space sufficient to ensure that spatial 

accuracy is retained. The functions obtained in this manner are used as the initial 

temperature fields, generation/sink terms and boundary conditions for the subsequent 

time iteration. 

In so doing the GF method becomes a sort of hybrid, with an analytical basis 

but requiring iterative numerical procedures to recalculate boundary conditions in order 

to maintain its accuracy. Furthermore, most practical situations, and certainly the one 

under discussion in the present document, will need to take into account variations in 

the intensity of generation/sink terms and of boundary conditions such as the radiative 

and convective exchanges with surroundings, even if the overall system is one-

dimensional along its radius, as assumed here. 

Numerical methods such as finite differences or finite elements are intrinsically 

iterative (even in steady-state formulations and, inherently more so, in transient 

approaches) and their formulation explicitly considers the diversity of heat transfer 



102 

 

modes that can take place at the boundaries as discussed earlier for finite differences, 

where various resistance terms were defined for each phenomenon. 

Although elegant in formal terms, computationally powerful in some situations 

and always useful as a fully analytical approach, the iterative procedure for GF is less 

interesting than the inherently iterative transient finite differences approach, which 

thus becomes more economical in computational terms, if less compact in the 

description of the problem when compared with an analytical approach.  

From the point of view taken in this document, GFSE is first and foremost a 

powerful analytical tool that in this particular case is less flexible and more 

cumbersome to implement than an intrinsically numerical and iterative finite 

differences approach. The latter method will therefore be used in more detailed 

comparisons with the commercial CFD software. These will consider the actual 

geometry of the components, namely its perforated pattern, by relying on the 

relationships obtained above for convection heat transfer coefficients as a function of 

transpiration airflows, as well as on the correction factors for convective and radiative 

heat transfer areas and element volumes. The variations of material properties with 

temperature will also be considered.  

The two purely numerical methods were tested for situations where radiation 

and convection are present, in order to compare results from the purpose-developed 

finite difference model with those of the commercial software. The same thin plate as 

before was used, but with air at a given temperature on one side, and surroundings 

with a predefined temperature and no convection on the other, allowing the study of 

conditions more closely akin to those of the perforated plate to be studied subsequently. 

Purely convective and radiative boundaries were first studied separately and later 

combined, and good concordance between the results obtained from CFX and finite 

differences was apparent. 

The transient transpiration principle to be used in practice was also tested by 

using results from simulations at a given transpiration airflow level as initial values for 

subsequent simulations where the airflow is diminished or eliminated. This process only 

requires the necessary adjustments in terms of boundary conditions, especially as far as 



103 

 

the convection coefficient is concerned, since no significant airflow will be considered 

and values for natural convection can be used. 

A final test was performed before moving on to the simulation of the full scale 

system, which can be thought of as a simpler version of the perforated plate 

simulations that must later be studied.  

In terms of CFX, the setup is merely a small circular section of the perforated 

plate with the same perforation patterns as the definitive plate and similar to those 

discussed above. This plate is exposed to radiation from the furnace on one side while 

being cooled by a transpiration airflow crossing it from the other, with an imposed 

temperature at the outer radius. A comparison is intended with the numerical model 

relying on finite differences that was developed and discussed above, including the 

correlations for the convection coefficient and the area correction factors. While not 

expected to be as accurate as the CFD simulation, since it does not take into account 

all the complex behaviours, such as turbulence, that occur in the interaction between 

the perforated plate and both its hot surroundings and its cooling transpiration airflow, 

the model is nevertheless expected to provide reasonable values for the transient 

temperature fields within the element. This simplified setup also allows for much faster 

simulations. Temperature results are shown in Figure 2.20. 

 

Figure 2.20 – CFX setup of the small perforated section and illustration of the resulting 

temperature field. 

 



104 

 

As before, radial temperature profiles at various timesteps were obtained, for 

various radiation source temperatures and several different mass flows. An example is 

illustrated in Figures 2.21 and 2.22 for a mass flow of 0.001 kgs-1 at 298 K, a radiative 

source at 1023 K and an imposed temperature at the outer radius of 473 K, which is 

also the plate uniform initial temperature.  

An interesting feature of the CFX curves is the slight “wobble” that occurs in 

the radial temperature profiles and that is due to the fact that the curve along the 

radial direction where values were sampled passes close to the holes, although not 

intersecting them. This effect is obviously absent from the finite differences curves. 

The curve behaviours are similar and a comparison of the scales of the graphs of 

Figures 2.21 and 2.22 shows that calculated values for the two methods differ in less 

than 10% in all cases. Figure 2.23 likewise illustrates the transient temperature curves 

at the centre of the plate, with 10% error bars placed on the finite differences results 

curve emphasizing the difference between calculated values.

The results from these studies show that the finite differences model is able to 

process the same physical problem as the commercial CFD software and that the 

correlation obtained for the convection coefficient provides accurate values. The CFD 

software does have a much greater flexibility in handling more complex geometries, and 

implements more detailed physical models that better describe the overall thermal and

fluid dynamics behaviour of the system, rendering it more attractive for subsequent 

simulations. 

Differences in temperature values calculated with each model were typically 

between 5 and 8%, no value greater than 10% being observed which, in itself, is a 

rather satisfactory value considering that the finite differences model is much less 

powerful than a full-scale commercial CFD software. 

While the pure conduction tests discussed when comparing the GF, finite 

differences and CFX did not present particular difficulties regarding the presence of 

non-linear phenomena such as radiation, differences were to be expected for the 

simulation where their occurrence might be problematic and lead to deviations in 

comparative results. The comparison of an explicit method (such as finite differences as 

implemented here) with the implicit methods on which CFX relies, compounded by 

local heterogeneities such as the microperforated pattern, was expected to lead to even 

greater differences. From this viewpoint, the obtained results are satisfactory given the 

simplicity of the approach and the assumptions and simplifications made. 

Insight about the various occurring physical phenomena was nevertheless gained 

from the development and testing of the GF and finite differences models and 

confidence in the results of the CFD software was enhanced by the comparisons that 

were carried out, building on previous experience with such software. 

2.5 Concluding Remarks 

The present chapter was devoted to the description of the instrument’s working 

principle and to possible formulations for the study of the sensing element’s behaviour.  

The problem requirements were first of all discussed and subsequent 

simplifications were implemented as necessary and once their reasonability was 

established. Among these requirements, the need to take into account a non-

homogeneous transient problem was foremost, especially given the presence of the 

interaction between a perforated plate being heated by radiation and a colder 

transpiration airflow crossing the pattern of holes, leading to the analytical treatment 

of such an interaction as a heat sink term. 



107 

 

The GF method was recognized as being well suited to the task of providing an 

analytical solution to the heat diffusion equation within the three-dimensional 

cylindrical system embodied by the sensor element, and a proper methodology was 

established in order to implement the GF method and solve the conduction problem in 

order to obtain temperature values for all locations and instants of interest, for a 

variety of cases. Concurrently, a finite differences approach was also found to be 

adequate for the same purpose, with added benefits in terms of implementation in 

conditions where boundary conditions require updating in space and time. 

In order to describe the phenomena that needed to be integrated into the model, 

relationships were obtained for convection heat transfer coefficients as a function of 

transpiration airflows, together with correction factors intended to take into account 

the perforation parameters of the sensing element. Given the latter’s low thickness and 

after studying the areas involved in convective and radiative heat transfer processes, a 

decision was taken to treat the heat transfer in the holes together with convection in 

the windward face of the plate. Nevertheless, the formulation necessary to deal with a 

volumetric generation/sink term was obtained and discussed, and remains built into the 

formulation for use in a different set of assumptions if necessary. 

A comparison of results of both approaches with those of equivalent CFD 

simulations of the same physical problems showed good approximation and 

simultaneously provided both increased confidence in the results provided by the GFSE 

and validation for the simulations to be carried out for dimensioning purposes using 

CFD software. 

The use of the CFD software was always intended for design purposes, not only 

regarding the sensing element itself but especially when considering the overall 

instrument as a system consisting of various components, rather than merely as a 

sensing element. The methodologies proposed and discussed showed reduced simulation 

times and overall computational effort for the type of geometry of interest, parametric 

tests regarding physical parameters of the sensing element and operational conditions 

such as airflows can be conducted merely by adjusting unit cell parameters or relevant 

temperatures, airflows and convection coefficients using the developed correlations. 

Relevant information about the sensing element’s behaviour regarding temperature 



108 

 

spatial distributions, transient variations or its time constant ?  for various conditions 

can thus be obtained at a fraction of the computational effort of CFD simulations. 

Likewise, relevant phenomena such as those arising from the pulsed 

transpiration airflows to be employed in practice can be implemented with reasonable 

results at a fraction of the computational effort required for CFD simulations.  

These numerical results, along with the insight gained into the physical 

processes at work within and around the sensing element, are felt to fully justify the 

effort that was put into the development of the analytical and numerical methods 

proposed, implemented and discussed in the present chapter. This is especially relevant 

regarding the finite differences approach that was extended with good results to a 

domain of application, i.e. the transient interaction between a transpiration airflow and 

a perforated plate exposed to convective and radiative boundary conditions that was 

not encountered in any bibliographical reference, although others unknown applications 

of the sort obviously cannot be ruled out.

CHAPTER 3 

DIMENSIONING PROCEDURES AND 

PARAMETRIC STUDIES 

 

The overall configuration of the system is studied, together with 

dimensional and operational parameters that influence sensor 

performance. Assumptions and simplifications made in the process of 

developing the analytical model are discussed, along with the 

instrument’s dimensioning and design procedures, taking into account 

conclusions from the previous chapter and establishing the procedures 

necessary for carrying out various analytical and numerical parametric 

studies as far as relevant mass flow values, boundary layer control, 

compressibility and transmissivity in the microperforated plate, 

transient effects or the cooling system are concerned. 

 

3.1 Introduction 

The ultimate goal of the work described here is an instrument for the measurement of 

convective and radiative heat fluxes which would overcome drawbacks noted in 

conventional heat flux meters (or at least in existing transpiration radiometers such as 

the one from which the present work originated) by having several desirable advantages 

that cannot be found in conventional instruments, namely: 

• A more compact configuration and a less complex system by the use of air 

cooling both in a microperforated low-thickness sensing element and in a porous 

holder/outer casing; 

• A significantly reduced response time obtained through a lower overall thermal 

inertia and the implementation of the transient response analysis; 

• An effective heat flux partitioning (i.e. splitting the total heat flux into the 

radiative and convective components thereof) achieved through a pulsed airflow 

operation mode. 



110 

 

The proposed sensing element is to have a much lower thermal inertia than those of 

earlier instruments and exhibit faster temperature variations in time, while being much 

more efficiently refrigerated, thus reducing cooling requirements. This makes the 

avoidance of excessive temperatures within the system much easier, renders using air 

cooling a viable option and has several interesting consequences, such as: 

• Lesser refrigeration needs allow the use of a much less complicated and more 

compact refrigeration system when compared with conventional transpiration 

radiometers, which use water refrigeration systems that require more parts in 

more complex configurations and, consequently, added manufacturing, assembly 

and maintenance complexities; 

• A faster response using an operational mode where transient behaviours are 

induced by variations in the transpiration airflow can be defined. It was proven 

earlier [Hit 2004, Martins et al. 2006a, Martins et al. 2006b] that the slope of 

the line tangent to the temperature response curve is directly proportional to 

the total heat flux received by a porous disc, making it unnecessary to “wait” 

for steady-state values and using the transient output of the radiometer to 

determine the incident heat flux. The necessary transient behaviour is induced 

by using a pulsed transpiration gas mass flow; 

• The transient behaviour induced by using a pulsed transpiration gas mass flow 

may also enable the implementation of heat flux partitioning, since the airflow 

can be made subcritical for short time periods in order to measure the total 

heat flux rather than only the radiative component, temperature levels being 

nevertheless kept within acceptable levels. This ability has not been achieved by 

earlier instruments. 

The proposed microperforated plate maintains established advantages of 

transpiration radiometers such as their protection from fouling by soot particles and 

their ability to withstand high temperature and heat flux environments, provided by 

the preservation of the air mass flow on which the transpiration radiometer principle is 

based 

The pulsed operation principle dictates that the effect of the various mass flows to 

be considered must be described, especially as far as temperature fields within the disk, 

time responses and heat flux partitioning are concerned. Received heat fluxes were 



111 

 

proven to be directly proportional to the slope of the tangent to the temperature 

response curve, which in turn allows an anticipation of the instrument’s steady-state 

values. The faster response of the proposed instrument enables its integration in 

strongly time-dependant systems, and its reduced bulk and weight are useful in systems 

where such restrictions may apply. 

The main conceptual difficulty in the passage from the actual physical system to its 

analytical or numerical description is taking into account the microperforated pattern 

that underlies the transpiration radiometer principle, in order to evaluate the effect of 

the various mass flows that will cross the plate. This difficulty is evident in any kind of 

analytical approach, so that some simplifications had to be made. As described earlier, 

a description of the cooling effect of the airflow was achieved by treating it as a heat 

sink term integrated both in a Green’s functions formulation and a finite difference 

scheme, used for the purpose of obtaining a solutions to the boundary value problem 

resulting from the physical conditions of the sensor, and comparisons with CFD 

simulations confirmed the soundness of the approach. 

Treating the presence of a large number of small holes with variable physical 

conditions is not straightforward. As far as the use of CFD tools is concerned, 

numerous small features usually involve more geometrically complex models and 

typically require additional mesh refinements for adequate accuracy, and compromises 

must be reached regarding these requirements versus computational times and 

necessary computer resources. However, previous experience with CFD tools was extant 

and the comparisons made with GFSE and finite difference calculations described in 

the Chapter 2 justified their use for more detailed simulations, especially those intended 

to study features that could not be taken into account, as the microperforated pattern, 

or parts of the system that are not central to the discussion and that for that reason 

were not considered in the analytical model, such as the external refrigeration system.  

Thus, much of the overall design relies both on standard fluid mechanics and heat 

transfer analytical tools, as well as on CFD. The selection of physical and operational 

parameters, as well as performance analysis of the proposed heat flux measurement 

instrument, also relies on CFD, along with various analytical principles described in 

detail below. 



112 

 

3.2 Proposed Configuration, Objectives and Approach 

The proposed microperforated sensing element, central to the intended instrument 

performance, was discussed above and especially in Chapter 2 but must itself be 

analysed in terms of the temperature fields developed within it, not only when 

interacting with high-temperature environments and external cooling systems, but 

especially in interaction with various transpiration mass flows and taking into account 

phenomena such as gas compressibility and transmissivity to the incident radiation. 

Decisions needed to be taken beforehand regarding the overall configuration of 

the instrument, especially concerning how necessary airflows are handled and the 

external refrigeration system’s features and dimensioning. Given the stated objective of 

using a less cumbersome (both in terms of dimensions and complexity) solution than 

water cooling (which led to more parts in more complex configurations, with added 

manufacturing, assembly and maintenance complexity), compressed air is the most 

obvious alternative. Although any suitable cooling gas can be used, air is the most 

straightforward choice, considering its availability and cost effectiveness. Nevertheless, 

the question of how to make this airflow interact with the rest of the system remained. 

This was addressed by using a refrigeration airflow (separate from the aforementioned 

transpiration airflow) that interacts with a porous steel part that serves both as a 

sensing element holder and as an outer casing for the overall system. This porous part 

makes use of the large specific area (defined as the ratio between the surface area 

available for heat transfer and the volume) of the porous parts to effectively interact 

with the stream of cooling air and render a proper design and dimensioning process 

necessary. 

Even if the airflows come from the same compressed air source or circuit, they 

must be somehow separated in order to adequately play their roles. This can be 

achieved by placing a solid component within the porous outer casing, that should be 

as thin as possible in order not to unduly increase overall thermal inertia while being 

sufficiently sturdy to withstand the pressures of the compressed air flows and the 

stresses of the welding process to which it will be subjected during prototype 

construction. This component can take the form of a hollow cone placed within the 

sensor casing, below the microperforated plate. 



113 

 

The porous holder must be placed atop and joined to a non-porous base that 

houses the refrigeration airflow tube and the conical component. The refrigeration 

airflow enters the non-porous base tangentially in order to provide it with a swirl 

component and therefore to increase its residence time in the space between the cone 

and the porous holder, when compared to a situation where its injection would be made 

along the part’s revolution axis, i.e. parallel to the transpiration airflow. All joints 

between the porous holder, the non-porous base and the cone must necessarily be 

airtight and be achieved with welding or brazing. 

 Temperature measurements in the microperforated plate are made using a 0.25 

mm diameter thermocouple that is passed inside the conical element through a sealed 

hole in its lower tube, and is then connected by laser welding to the centre of the 

microperforated plate using a slightly larger central hole for guidance. The plate is then 

attached (e.g. brazed) to the porous holder in order to guarantee air tightness around 

its rim. This assembly dispenses with moving parts. 

Once the compressed air tubes are connected to supply lines and the 

thermocouple is connected to a data acquisition system, which also controls an 

electrovalve that regulates the pulsed transpiration airflow using the associated 

software, the instrument is ready to measure heat fluxes. 

Illustrated in Figures 3.1 to 3.4 is the proposed overall configuration of the 

system (definition drawings of each of the various components). The dimensions that 

are shown were specified once the dimensioning procedures described in this chapter 

were complete and prospective providers for the parts were consulted, since some 

adjustments required by the manufacturing processes had to be made. An exploded and 

an assembly view are also provided in Figures 3.5 and 3.6 respectively.

117 

 

In order to produce viable instrument prototypes, the plate’s overall physical 

parameters, such as its diameter, thickness and material, must therefore be defined. Its 

perforated pattern must also be defined in terms of diameter, spacing and placement. 

Given the fact that the proposed instrument is essentially (despite all aforementioned 

differences with conventional versions) a transpiration heat flux meter, conditions for 

the implementation of the boundary layer blow-off principle must be ensured, as this 

requirement has a direct impact on the definition of a proper perforated pattern. This 

meant that analytical models that describe boundary layer blow-off for various 

situations were examined and used to determine necessary gas mass flows, regardless of 

particular features of the perforated plate. 

Once the necessary compressed air mass flows are determined, the matter of 

passing them through a microperforated pattern also raises the question of knowing 

whether the considerable difference in diameter between the feed line tubes and the 

plate holes, along with pressure differences between both sides of the plate, can give 

rise to compressibility and choked flow conditions that can place an upper limit to the 

passable mass flow through each hole and therefore trough the overall perforated 

pattern, that must be dimensioned accordingly. 

However, the selection of perforated pattern parameters must consider one other 

phenomenon, namely a radiation transmissivity term that was absent in the sensing 

elements of earlier instruments because of their opacity. This led to the need to 

adequately describe and calculate the transmissivity of a perforated thin plate, to 

specify a maximum acceptable value (since it cannot be avoided) and to adjust the 

perforation parameters accordingly. Care must be taken to avoid possible undesirable 

effects such as extraordinary transmission phenomena. This makes necessary some 

further caution regarding the interaction between incident radiation (namely as far as 

its wavelength is concerned) and the holes of the microperforated pattern. 

The procedures described above result in the definition of the geometric and 

dimensional features of the various system components, together with its physical 

properties. Nonetheless, other studies remain to be carried out, namely as far as 

operational parameters or transient effects are concerned. Parameters such as the 

magnitude of the transpiration and refrigeration airflows or external medium 



118 

 

temperatures, as well as their relationships with temperatures developed within the 

sensing element, must be carefully addressed. 

For any given set of conditions in the high-temperature environment, 

considerable transpiration gas flows are required in order to provide enough 

refrigeration to keep temperature fields in the sensing element within acceptable limits 

and to lower surface temperatures, diminishing the magnitude of radial flows within the 

microperforated plate (overall temperatures being closer to the temperature imposed on 

the outer radius) and rendering the emission term much less significant. This principle 

was already applied to nullify these terms in energy balances for sensing elements of 

previous instruments [Martins 1998].  

High gas flows also have other advantages such as a more effective deflection of 

incoming soot particles, while the lower temperatures place less severe constraints on 

the outer refrigeration system. In earlier transpiration instruments, large airflows were 

indispensible at all times in order to provide refrigeration, which meant that convection 

measurements were never performed because the airflow could not be interrupted, in 

order to impede the hot gases from making contact with the sensor surface. Typical 

airflows ranged from 10 to 60 SLPM (Standard Litres per Minute) while in the work 

described here significantly lower values are expected thanks to much-reduced 

refrigeration needs. In order to always be able to blow-off the boundary layer, this 

value is nevertheless strongly overdimensioned. 

What happens within the sensing element when the pulsed operation results in 

subcritical mass flow values is also of particular relevance, given the transpiration 

airflow’s refrigeration role. Care must be taken in order to ensure that excessive 

temperatures are not reached during those situations. Such transient effects must be 

studied and anticipated beforehand. This means that while the transpiration airflow 

must be known with precision in order to quantify its effect in terms of time-varying 

temperature fields in the sensing element and of boundary layer blow-off, the 

refrigeration airflow can, if necessary, be set at a maximum value, regardless of other 

considerations.

3.3 Dimensioning and Design Procedures 

3.3.1 Basic Assumptions 

The proposed changes discussed earlier in terms of overall configuration, operation 

mode and physical features do not make reasonable a direct transposition of the 

specifications of components of earlier instruments. This does not mean that some 

items do not have similar dimensions between instruments, even if these can in some 

cases be somewhat arbitrarily imposed, the most obvious example probably being the 

sensing element’s frontal area. The earlier instruments mentioned before used a sensing 

element with a diameter of 10 mm and a thickness of 4 mm [Martins 1998]. Besides 

allowing some form of comparison, this diameter results in a manageable part that 

allows for the intended reduction in both overall dimensions and thermal inertia, and 

was thus specified as a basic parameter. 

As already mentioned, an example of application of low thickness 

microperforated plates was found in espresso machine filters that were around 0.1 mm 

in thickness. These samples showed adequate thermal behaviour and good mechanical 

resistance. Thus, the idea to use similar components for the instrument’s sensing 

element was naturally considered. A survey of providers, manufacturing technologies 

and prices for obtaining the plates resulted in the selection of photo-etched rather than 

micro-machined components. This technique is very useful in obtaining the required 

components effectively but has the limitation that holes with diameters smaller than 

the plate thickness are extremely difficult to obtain, thus placing limits on hole 

diameter to plate thickness ratios. 

All other component dimensions were thus specified using the referred diameter 

and thickness values as starting points, although some had to be subsequently slightly 

adjusted due either to the dimensioning procedures and numerical studies discussed 

below, or to limitations imposed by the various manufacturing processes. Some of these 

occurred while some components were already under production but no significant 

changes were required, the only noteworthy one being the change in effective diameter 

of the microperforated pattern that came about due to a need to increase the cone wall 

thickness when it was no longer possible to adjust the porous holder’s inside diameter. 

This meant that the porous holder has an internal diameter of 10.5 mm, the cone wall 



120 

 

is 0.5 mm in thickness and thus has an internal diameter of 9.5 mm rather than the 

intended 10 mm. The microperforated pattern was extended to a diameter of 9.75 mm 

in order to ensure it covers as much area as possible by overlapping the top of the cone. 

3.3.2 Boundary Layer Control, Mass Flow Rate and Compressibility 

in the Microperforated Plate 

A central aspect of the proposed heat flux measurement method is the possibility of 

enabling an effective heat flux partitioning which, as discussed earlier, requires the 

elimination of the boundary layer on top of the sensing element. The transpiration 

cooling principle of blowing a gas stream through a porous wall is especially useful 

bearing in mind that the perforated plate is merely a particularly well-ordered porous 

medium. If the blowing gas mass flow is sufficiently high, the aerodynamic and thermal 

boundary layers developing on the porous surface are destroyed and the convective 

heat transfer from the main stream to the considered surface is eliminated. 

The effect of a transpiration cross stream on the Nusselt number for a laminar 

boundary layer developing on porous wall is well established, relationships for the 

limiting conditions of a main stream parallel and perpendicular to a flat plate [Hartnett 

and Eckert 1957], as well as for turbulent boundary layers being available [Kutateladze 

and Leontiev 1964, Leontiev 1966]. Subsequent work focused mainly on empirical and 

numerical studies, with a particular emphasis on the latter [Tedeschi et al. 1995, 

Franca et al. 1998].  

The critical transpiration gas (CTG) mass flow rate required to promote the 

destruction of the boundary layer over the porous disc is a basic parameter to be 

defined for the proposed heat flux sensor. In the definition of the CTG mass flow rate it 

is necessary to consider the laminar or turbulent nature of the mainstream flow (i.e. on 

the furnace side), its velocity and temperature, the density ? between the TG and the 

main stream gas, as well as the local geometry. The local Reynolds number Rex defines 

the boundary layer nature, while the density difference is defined mainly by 

temperature differences, the influence of the geometry being introduced through an 

appropriated choice of Nusselt number correlation.  



121 

 

A variety of expressions is available for mass flows (typically given in kgs-1) or 

mass fluxes (in kgs-1m-2) in various situations, namely laminar or turbulent flows over 

flat plates or stagnation situations. A comparative study of these various transpiration 

mass flow or flux relationships is available, with some very useful conclusions [Martins 

1998]. This comparison was conducted for the purpose of determining not only the 

critical blow-off mass flow or flux for any given situation, but also in order to study its 

sensitivity to various parameters. For the blow-off a laminar boundary layer, the 

following relationship is valid for 0.7 &amp;lt;Pr &amp;lt;1 [Hartnett and Eckert 1957]:

It was found that the sensitivity of the critical mass flux relatively to the 

density ratio is higher for the laminar boundary layer. This is important information 

given the fact that the main stream temperature is not necessarily known. Another 

conclusion was that for Rex &gt; 10
5 the limiting critical mass flux is always given by the 

law for a turbulent boundary layer, regardless of the value of the density ratio.  



122 

 

For Rex &amp;lt;10
5 the value of the limiting flux is not so clear and actually depends 

on the effective transition Rex, that is the laminar or turbulent nature of the boundary 

layer, the density ratio ? and the main stream flow direction relatively to the sensor 

surface (parallel or stagnation flow). The mass flux values necessary for boundary layer 

blow-off are also higher than for Rex &gt; 10
5, as illustrated in Fig. 3.7, where the CTG 

mass flux as a function of Rex and ? is plotted. Once it is not possible to predict the 

Reynolds number for which transition occurs, the relations for the turbulent boundary 

layer were plotted for the whole Reynolds number range [Martins 1998]: 

 

Figure 3.7 – Critical transpiration gas (CTG) mass flux as a function of Rex and ? for turbulent 

boundary layers, a laminar boundary layer in a stagnation flow and a laminar boundary layer 

developing along a flat plate [Martins 1998]. 

 

It can be observed that the critical mass flux is given in an adimensional form 

where mass flux j, with units in kilograms per second per square meter, is divided by 

the main stream velocity and density. Results in Figure 3.7 mean that in order to 

always guarantee an effective blow-off, the relationship valid for laminar boundary 

layer on a stagnation plane flow valid for  0.7 &amp;lt;Pr &amp;lt;1.0 can be used for CTG 

calculation, that is:

The Reynolds number for the main stream must also be specified for the 

stagnation flow situation:

The characteristic length L was considered to be the same as the perforated 

plate’s diameter which, in effect, corresponds to a situation where a nozzle would be 

blowing straight at the perforated plate. Although arguably unrealistic, this assumption 

is helpful in the specification of an assuredly critical transpiration flow. The density can 

be calculated as before, while the dynamic viscosity of the fluid can be found from the 

standard power law:

where n = 0.7 for air and µ0 is a known dynamic viscosity at temperature 0T , usually 

1.71×10-5  Nsm-2 at 273 K [White 1998]. It should also be noted that the fluid density 

and velocity used in the calculation of the main stream Reynolds number are the same 

used in the determination of the critical transpiration mass flow. 

 The calculation of the CTG does not take into account any parameters related 

to the porous medium being crossed by the transpiration airflow. Previous transpiration 

radiometers used large mass flows in order to ensure boundary layer blow-off while 

providing additional refrigeration to keep temperature fields in the sensing element 

within acceptable bounds and to minimize the surface radiation emission [Martins 

1998]. This means that a sensing element with a much lower thermal inertia could fulfil 

such requirements while relying on either smaller transpiration airflows or less bulky 

refrigeration systems than previous instruments. In any case, once a CTG value is 



124 

 

obtained, the question remains about how it will interact with the porous element it is 

crossing in thermal and dynamic terms.   

The fact that the sensing element being studied is a thin plate with a 

microperforated array of small holes also raises questions about the behaviour of the 

transpiration airflow when transitioning from the feed tube to the plate itself, since the 

large difference in flow areas raises possible compressibility issues that may result in 

choked flow conditions and inhibit mass flow increases that could be necessary in order 

to ensure boundary layer blow-off. Furthermore, given the fact that the transpiration 

and refrigeration airflows are provided by compressed air at several times the 

atmospheric pressure, sonic flow is likely to occur since pressure ratios as low as 2:1 

may be sufficient for its occurrence.  

For given stagnation conditions, the maximum possible mass flow passes 

through a duct when its throat is at the critical or sonic condition. The duct is said to 

be choked and can carry no additional mass flow unless the throat is widened. 

Compressible flow theory available in any of the standard textbooks states that for 

isentropic flow through a duct (a common and convenient assumption) the maximum 

mass flow possible is proportional to the throat area and stagnation pressure, and 

inversely proportional to the square root of the stagnation temperature, which for air  

(? = cp/cv = 1.4) reduces to [White 1998]:

with subscript 1 indicating a point immediately upstream from the perforated plate.  

The calculation of the Mach number of the incoming compressed air is obviously 

dependent on its velocity, which is a function of the gas mass flow that circulates in the 

feed line. While the velocity is merely the ratio of the mass flow rate and the flow area, 

the Mach number must be determined in order to compute the stagnation pressure, 

and can be calculated as the ratio between this velocity and the local speed of sound a: 

 

 Ma
v

a

which in turn can be calculated as: 

 

 a RT?= ,  (3.11) 

 

where, as mentioned earlier, ? is the specific-heat ratio for air, R is the ideal gas 

constant and T the temperature. 

At this point the calculations to be performed are dimensioning procedures for 

the perforated plate that must enable it to perform as intended for most foreseeable 

situations. As far as its function is concerned, as the sensing element of an instrument 

that is first and foremost a radiometer regardless of other possible features such as heat 

flux partitioning, this means that boundary layer blow-off must be ensured over a wide 

range of conditions, including the less favourable.  

Given the instrument’s intended function as a radiometer, care must be taken 

to ensure some certainty that the blow-off process is effective, and this can be achieved 

in several ways. The use of the relationship valid for laminar boundary layer on a 

stagnation plane flow provides the highest critical flow estimate for a given Reynolds 

number, while considering the density ?w at the porous wall to that of the compressed 

air flow that crosses the plate, although the actual value is smaller and could readily be 

estimated using well-established relationships for the pressure loss trough the 

perforated pattern and the related density variations [Kolodzie and Van Winkle 1957, 

Fried and Idelchik 1989, Ishizuka et al. 2005]. 



126 

 

Considering the density ?w at the porous wall as being equal to that of the 

compressed air flow that crosses the plate will lead to overestimated transpiration 

airflows and will actually increase the calculated critical mass flow for higher supply 

pressures, which is obviously counterintuitive. This assumption is merely intended to 

ensure boundary layer blow-off for any conditions and does not mean that such 

overestimated airflows will necessarily be used in normal operational conditions, where 

the mass flow to be used will probably be considerably smaller.  

Moreover, the nature of the airflow on the furnace side must also be taken into 

account, since stagnation flows are not necessarily the most common in normal 

conditions, nor is their magnitude similar in terms of velocity to those used to compute 

the maximum values to be handled by the perforated plate. Nevertheless, the capability 

to work in extreme conditions remains built into the system. 

The critical transpiration mass flow will thus be a function of conditions on the 

side of the compressed air fed to the system, namely its pressure, temperature and 

geometry (i.e. tubing diameters that influence mass flow), and conditions in the main 

stream such as the flow direction, velocity, temperature and pressure. While in some 

applications it may be assumed that the main stream is at atmospheric pressure, in 

others, such as gas turbines, that assumption may not be valid. In this particular case, 

given the fact that the experimental work to be carried out would take place in a 

furnace open to the atmosphere, the pressure was set at 1,013×105 Pa (i.e. 1 atm)  for 

all calculations and simulations, air density in the main stream being a function of 

temperature. 

In the case under discussion the flow will not be passed through a single duct 

but rather though a pattern of small holes. This means that the microperforated plate 

must be dimensioned in such a way that it enables the passage of the required mass 

flow even if conditions become sonic at the level of the small holes. The calculation of 

the maximum mass flow permissible in the small holes can then be compared with the 

critical transpiration gas mass flow in order to determine the minimum number of holes 

necessary to accommodate the necessary gas flow, bearing in mind that a greater 

number of holes of the same diameter will diminish the mass flow through each of them 

by dividing the incoming total flow, so that a greater total flow can be circulated. 



127 

 

In terms of transpiration airflow handling, the perforated plate will thus be 

considered adequately dimensioned when the number of holes of a certain diameter is 

sufficient to accommodate the largest considered mass flow, which is in turn dictated 

by boundary layer blow-off requirements, and this maximum mass flow is ensured even 

if choked flow conditions are present in the perforated pattern. Other considerations 

that have to do with the interaction between the perforated pattern and incoming 

radiation are addressed in detail later on. 

Under the aforementioned assumptions, the critical transpiration mass flow    

(in kgs-1) will increase with increasing density ?w at the porous wall, and will obviously 

be higher for increasing main stream stagnation flow velocities, Equation 3.4 showing a 

direct proportionality between the critical mass flow value and the stream velocity, 

that is tempered by the inverse proportionality between the critical mass flow and the 

square root of the Reynolds number.  

It should be remembered that stagnation flows on the perforated plate are 

assumed and that reasonable velocities must be specified for these flows, which likewise 

require the definition of representative furnace temperatures, namely in order to 

calculate air densities, viscosities and Reynolds numbers on the “hot” side of the plate, 

assumed to be at one atmosphere in pressure as mentioned above. Conversely, while 

the temperature of the incoming transpiration airflow can safely be assumed to be 

constant at 25ºC, possible variations in pressure must be taken into account because 

they do occur in practice and influence the density of the compressed air flow which, as 

discussed, will be considered equal to that of the air near the porous wall.   

With all these values, density ratios ? and critical mass fluxes and flows can be 

calculated as described by Equations 3.2 and 3.4. Assumed furnace temperatures were 

considered in increments of 250ºC from 500 to 1500ºC, stagnation flow velocities were 

set at 1, 2, 5, 10 ms-1 and then in increments of 10 up to  50 ms-1, while the range of 

values considered for the compressed air pressure ranged from 2 to 8 bar, at 0.5 bar 

increments. 

Considering the aforementioned formulae and the assumptions listed above, the 

highest critical mass fluxes naturally occur for the highest value of density ?w at the 

porous wall for each considered temperature, for the highest values of stagnation flow 



128 

 

velocities and for the highest temperatures considered in the furnaces, since these 

minimize the density ratio ? for any fixed supply pressure and therefore maximize the 

critical mass flow, as illustrated in Figures 3.8 and 3.9. One of the interesting results 

from the numerical simulations of the perforated plate being crossed by varying gas 

mass flows, described in further detail below, is the conclusion that densities at the 

plate wall, averaged over its entire area since local variations result from the holes, can 

be thirty times or more smaller than the density of the incoming compressed air flow, 

illustrating the large degree of overdimensioning present in these considerations.  

These critical mass flows are processed and fed from the compressed air system 

but given the large pressure differences with the atmospheric pressure in the furnace 

the possibility of choked flow in the holes of the microperforated pattern must be taken 

into account. Equations 3.7 to 3.11 allow the calculation of the maximum mass flow 

that can be accommodated by a hole of a certain diameter. The calculation of the 

choked mass flows allows an analysis of the number of necessary holes of a certain 

diameter, but other factors must be kept in mind, namely the need to ensure as 

uniform a flow as possible on the outer surface of the plate and the fact that the 

radiation transmissivity of the plate is a direct function of the perforated and non-

perforated areas of the plate, as discussed below.  

For small hole diameters the choked flow value will naturally be very low, so 

the criterion selected for dimensioning the perforated plate was to study the number of 

holes of a certain diameter necessary to accommodate the highest critical mass flow 

rate encountered in the previous step of the process, this value occurring for a 

stagnation velocity of 50 ms-1 and for the maximum density considered at the porous 

wall, that is the density corresponding to the compressed air flow at 8 bar for each of 

the temperatures of interest. As mentioned earlier, the assumption of such values does 

not mean that such overestimated airflows will necessarily be used in normal 

operational conditions, where the mass flow to be used will probably be considerably 

smaller and relatively small mass flows will ensure boundary layer blow-off. 

Once values for both the critical transpiration mass flows necessary to ensure 

boundary layer blow-off and the mass flow that can be passed in a given hole at choked 

flow conditions are available, the number of necessary holes can be thought of as 



129 

 

merely the ratio between the critical mass flow and the choked flow in each hole of the 

pattern, since it is assumed that all the incoming compressed air is passed through the 

perforated pattern, although this may not be the case if a faulty welding process is 

applied to the edge of the plates when they are attached to the porous holder. These 

areas are obviously not only a function of the number of holes and their number but 

also of their spacing, so that the numbers of holes obtained here must be considered 

along with the intended values for plate transmissivity. Furthermore, the ability to 

accommodate the necessary number of holes with a specified spacing on a plate with a 

pre-determined diameter and therefore frontal area must obviously checked, ensured 

and adjusted if necessary.

Choked flows in the holes are determined from Equation 3.7, which requires a 

knowledge of conditions upstream of the plate in terms of temperature, pressure and 

flow velocity, so that Mach number and stagnation temperatures and pressures, can be 

calculated using Equations 3.8 to 3.11. Pressures and temperatures are the same as 

considered before, while flow velocities and Mach numbers upstream of the plate are 

calculated considering the feed line diameter and from the maximum critical mass flow 

at each temperature, that is the critical value occurring for the highest density at the 

porous plate and highest stagnation external flow, as mentioned above. 

Once these values are available, the necessary number of holes in the pattern 

can be calculated as the ratio between the maximum critical mass flow to be 

accommodated at a given temperature and the choked mass flow for a specified hole 

diameter, as listed in Table 3.1.

From the values in Table 3.1 it is visible that a single 1 mm hole would be able to 

accommodate almost any possible critical mass flow under discussion, while for the 

intended hole diameter of 0.1 mm the number of necessary holes to handle the 

maximum critical mass flow is merely 138. If all 138 holes were placed tangent to each 

other along the diameter of the plate, a total diameter of 13.8 mm would be obtained, 

which proves that it is a simple matter to place the necessary number of holes in the 

specified plate diameter. Additionally, other considerations regarding the specification 

of the perforation pattern parameters have more to do with plate transmissivity and 

flow uniformity issues rather than with boundary layer blow-off and compressibility 

problems in the holes leading to insufficient transpiration mass flows. This also means 

that the number of holes calculated from plate transmissivity and flow uniformity 

criteria will lead to a safely overdimensioned number of holes as far as transpiration 

requirements as concerned. 

As mentioned earlier mass flows are heavily overestimated merely for 

dimensioning purposes, and actual operational mass flows are expected to be much 

smaller, but another related matter should be kept in mind. 

 The use of comparatively high transpiration mass flows is fundamental from the 

point of view of the measurement principle and the analytical approaches discussed in 

the previous chapter, since these large airflows are the only way of achieving the low 

surface temperatures that enable the assumption of a negligible emission component in 

the radiative balance between the plate’s surface and the hot surroundings encountered, 

for instance, in furnaces.  



132 

 

Given the fact that the aforementioned CTG airflows are largely 

overdimensioned, the operational use of similar values will ensure both the intended 

boundary layer blow-off and the low surface temperatures. As discussed in Chapter 4, 

the maximum mass flows achievable in a measurable manner (i.e. using mass flow 

meters rather than simply connecting compressed air lines at the maximum pressure 

setting) in the laboratories where the experimental studies took place are indeed similar 

in magnitude to the maximum values discussed above, although slightly smaller but 

certainly sufficient to ensure both intended objectives.  

Another interesting effect to be considered is a lessening of the importance of 

the external refrigeration system. The contact area between the porous medium and the 

rim of the plate was maximized to a reasonable extent without leading to unduly large 

diameters atop the instrument, nevertheless remaining rather small. The bulk of the 

plate’s refrigeration needs, if only for radiative emission minimization, will undoubtedly 

be met by the transpiration airflow given its magnitude and its direct contact with a 

massive portion of the plate’s mass and volume. This also means that the fail-safe 

position of the valves controlling the transpiration airflow must be such that the 

airflow is on in the absence of control signal in the valve, which must thus be a 

normally-open valve. 

3.3.3 Plate Transmissivity 

Besides boundary layer control and compressibility issues, other considerations must be 

made regarding the use of the microperforated plate, since the presence of the pattern 

of holes has other implications.  

While the option of using a thin perforated plate rather than a comparatively 

thick sinterized porous cylinder as the sensing element is rather naturally intuitive from 

the strict point of view of its thermal inertia, it does entail a need to carefully consider 

some factors that could otherwise be ignored. Especially relevant is the issue of the 

element’s transmissivity, since the combination of the low thickness and the perforated 

pattern renders it non-opaque, such an effect being visible (although at a different 

wavelength than the ones at which the element is expected to perform) even when such 

the plate is held at arm’s length. 



133 

 

The behaviour of a solid element exposed to incident radiation is a complex 

phenomenon even in cases when no perforation is present, since solids can exhibit 

various degrees of emissivity, reflectivity and transmittance that can be characterized 

with varying levels of accuracy and complexity. The problem is compounded by the 

presence of any degree of porosity that implies some convection and alters the radiative 

and conductive behaviours. This additional complexity should be taken into account 

even in cases when no perforation is apparent through the whole thickness of the 

element, since phenomena such as internal reflection, reemission and scattering can 

occur within the cavities of the porous medium and the interfaces between phases. 

There are numerous references that deal with various aspects of porous media, 

including their thermal behaviour, and increasingly with media with very small (i.e. 

nanoscale) and ordered porosities [Wehrspohn 2005]. Of interest within the framework 

of the present work is also the existence of transient effects of radiative transfer in 

semitransparent materials [Siegel 1998]. 

An accurate evaluation of the medium’s thermal behaviour is of critical 

importance for its use as a sensing element but such an analysis is potentially difficult 

due to the aforementioned internal reflection, reemission and scattering phenomena. 

These are potentially very difficult to analyse. Thus, a variety of techniques are 

available in order to simplify the task, often involving the determination of a single 

effective thermal conductivity for the simpler case of a single solid material and only 

one gas. Some involve detailed calculations of radiative balances within the cavities 

[Tsai and Strieder 1986] but most are based on averaging techniques that treat the 

highly heterogeneous phases (each of which can be either opaque, transparent or semi-

transparent) as one or several homogeneous materials [Travkin and Catton 2001], 

relying on known morphology data and yielding average values for the various 

materials, that enable much simpler heat transfer calculations. 

 The thin perforated plate is a very particular case of porous medium, for several 

reasons, and is fortunately a much simpler situation than those mentioned above. In all 

relevant situations but especially given the plate’s low thickness and the related small 

diameter and spacing of the microperforated patterns, special care must be applied 

when studying periodic structures exposed to electromagnetic radiation, due to the 

possible occurrence of unforeseen and usually unfamiliar phenomena, such as the 



134 

 

phenomenon of greatly enhanced transmission of light through a subwavelength 

aperture in an otherwise opaque metallic film patterned with a regularly repeating 

periodic structure, such as the microperforation under discussion.  

This phenomenon is designated as Extraordinary Optical Transmission (EOT). 

When light of a certain wavelength falls on a subwavelength aperture, it is diffracted 

isotropically and evenly in all directions, with minimal far-field transmission. This is 

the understanding from classical aperture theory as first described [Bethe 1944] and 

later corrected [Bouwkamp 1950]. In EOT however, the regularly repeating structure 

enables a much higher transmission efficiency to occur, up to several orders of 

magnitude higher than that predicted by classical aperture theory [Ebbesen et al. 1998, 

Martín-Moreno et al. 2001], this effect being widely studied and exploited when such 

amplifications are sought [Chao-Chun 1973, Letrou and Gheudin 1992, Green and Yi 

2004, Canpean and Astilean 2009]. 

It is therefore necessary to make sure that no such effects are to be expected 

when defining the microperforated pattern that is intended to interact with incoming 

thermal radiation. The latter is usually defined as the emission of electromagnetic 

waves from all matter that has a temperature greater than absolute zero. Moreover, in 

the scope of this document it is conventionally defined as ranging from about 0.1 µm to 

several hundred microns, covering the infrared, visible and near-ultraviolet portions of 

the electromagnetic spectrum. 

The sensor prototype will be tested in a blackbody furnace which can be set to 

temperatures up to 1500°C. Thus, in order to verify whether EOT phenomena can be 

expected, the wavelength range of the radiation produced in the furnace must be 

determined. 

According to Wien’s displacement law, there is an inverse relationship between 

the wavelength of the peak of the emission of a black body and its temperature when 

expressed as a function of the wavelength, that is: 

 

 
max 3

T C? = ,  (3.12) 

 



135 

 

where C3 = 2897.8  Kµm. This means that if furnace temperatures from 750 to 1500°C 

are considered, emission maxima will range from 2.83 to 1.63 µm, while spectral 

emissive power as a function of temperature and wavelength can be calculated using 

Planck’s distribution:

4 Kµm, as 

illustrated in Figure 3.10. 

As discussed earlier the envisaged plate thickness values for the present 

application were around 0.1 mm, with limitations on hole diameter to plate thickness 

ratios imposed by the manufacturing processes. Given the results in Table 3.1, it is 

visible that the avoidance of EOT phenomena in subwavelength apertures is 

straightforward, since hole diameters are significantly larger than incoming radiation 

wavelengths. The wavelength band where 80% of emitted radiation at the considered 

temperatures occurs (i.e. excluding the lower and upper 10% of the total range) can 

also be calculated using the blackbody radiation functions, as summarized in Table 3.2. 

The hole diameter-to-plate thickness ratio limitation must be combined with the 

geometric analysis of the transmissivity in order to establish proper dimensions for the 

microperforated pattern to be obtained, bearing in mind the fact that transmissivity 

should be kept as low as possible when other radiative heat exchange parameters such 

as absorption and reflection are constant, in order to maximize the amount of heat 

absorbed by the plate and transformed into a measurable temperature increase for 

transient analysis.

Transmission phenomena through solids with periodic apertures can be of very 

complex description and are especially studied in the range of frequencies relevant for 

radio and microwave applications. So, most of the applications encountered in the 

literature had to do precisely with the optimization of these phenomena in components 

where comparatively long wavelengths can interact with component features of similar 

dimensions according to fairly complex formulations. Given the fact that thermal 

radiation has a higher frequency (and shorter wavelength) that radio or microwaves, 

such interactions are not to be expected in the present case, as mentioned above. 

However, references for microwave applications do state that the transmission through

a perforated plate can be approximated by a geometrical consideration for the high 

frequency end of this range, as is the case for thermal radiation. For normal incidence 

the power transmittance is the geometrical ratio of opening to blockage, that is 

[Winnewisser et al. 1998]:

?
?

Opening and blockage areas will depend upon which particular unit cells are 

considered and these, in turn, are a function of the perforation parameters, the most 

usual perforated pattern using circular holes being the 60º staggered pattern used here. 

Unit cell parameters, namely hole diameters and their spacings that dictate opening 

and blockage areas are summarized in Table 3.3.

where e is the distance between holes and d is their diameter. The selection of a 60º 

staggered pattern over a square pattern was already discussed in Chapter 2 and has to 

do with guaranteeing an isotropic distribution in the plane of the plate, as opposed to 

the orthotropic behaviour of a square pattern [Dowling 1999]. 

A variety of perforated patterns is thus defined in terms of hole diameter and 

spacing, and the resulting transmissivity can then be plotted as summarized in     

Table 3.4 and illustrated in Figure 3.11. The aforementioned limitations in the hole 

diameter-to-plate thickness must be remembered at this point, along with the selection 



138 

 

of a 0.1 mm thickness for the plate. This means that the hole diameter was set at the 

same value so that the transmissivity plot only takes into account this diameter and 

various hole spacings e. 

 

Figure 3.11 – Plate transmissivity as a function of the hole diameter to spacing ratio of the 

perforated pattern. 

 

A maximum acceptable transmissivity value was arbitrarily set at 20%. If a hole 

0.1 mm in diameter is considered, a spacing of 0.233 mm between holes ensures the 

intended transmissivity, so that the final spacing was specified as 0.25 mm for a 

transmissivity of 17%, leading to the configuration illustrated in Fig. 3.1. 

3.3.4 Cooling System 

As mentioned earlier the relative importance of the external refrigeration system is 

lessened by the magnitude of the transpiration airflow and its cooling effect on the 

plate, given the airflow’s direct contact with the bulk of the material of which the plate 

is made of and the admittedly rather small contact area between the porous medium 

and the rim of the plate. 

The porous component is nevertheless important, if only as a means of 

containing, directing and ultimately handling the transpiration airflow. This function 

could arguably have been performed by a solid component. Temperatures could be 

minimized if the metal mass exposed to high heat fluxes was kept low by using small

outer tubing diameters, but this could be problematic from the strict point of view of 

system robustness. As mentioned earlier, the minimization of dimensions and the 

lessening of the thermal inertia of the overall system were never intended to be 

obtained at the expense of robustness, which meant that wall thicknesses of at least     

1 mm had to be used for safety. 

The idea of rendering the plate holder porous can be thought of merely as an 

additional benefit in terms of component safety in avoiding excessive temperatures by 

making use of this comparatively large wall thickness, and therefore volume, as a heat 

transfer surface. 

The porous steel casing is thus intended to serve as a holder for the 

microperforated plate with some refrigeration around its outer diameter, the plate being 

welded to the top of the porous holder. The intention is to make use of the large 

specific area (defined as the ratio between the surface area available for heat transfer 

and the volume) of the porous parts to interact with a stream of cooling air. 

An analytical description of heat transfer within a porous medium can be 

difficult to describe if some assumptions are not made in order to simplify the 

approach. It is indeed a field of study in its own right, with large numbers of articles 

being published every year and relevant studies being continuously carried out, so 

much that even well-established academic manuals have been in need of constant 

updating to take into account new analytical approaches, new porous medium 

morphologies such as metal foams (rather than the more conventional packed solid 

spheres) or the large number of empirical correlation for relevant parameters such as 

Nusselt numbers or convection coefficients that have been emerging [Kaviany 1995, 

Vafai 2005]. 

The one-equation equilibrium or the two-equation non-equilibrium models are 

commonly used. The first model assumes that there is no temperature difference 

between the local fluid and solid phase while the second model treats the fluid and solid 

separately, considering the local temperature difference between them. The latter is 

more difficult to apply because it requires information on the interfacial heat transfer 

coefficient, which is usually determined through a large number of experimental 

investigations [Kim 1993]. Owing to this difficulty, some investigators have used the 



140 

 

one-equation model for the analysis of convection heat transfer in a general porous 

medium. However, the one-equation model is only valid when the local temperature 

difference between fluid and solid is negligibly small. This will not be the case in heat 

exchanger applications where the difference in the thermal conductivities of the fluid 

and solid is significant and certainly not the case as far as the microperforated plate 

and the transpiration airflow are concerned, since no significant heating of the air 

flowing through the microperforated pattern is to be expected. 

The most widely available models are for spherical media, that is materials 

where the porosity consists of the empty spaces between packed solid spheres. Other 

configurations are somewhat less well established and a large part of current work in 

the field focuses on other morphologies, such as spherical pores or open-cell metal foams 

[Boomsma et al. 2003]. 

 Given the fact that the cooling system is a somewhat secondary component of 

the system in terms of the measurement process itself and that a proper analytical 

approach would for that reason be outside the main focus of the work described here, 

the emphasis was put merely on an adequate determination of its performance rather 

than on a comprehensive analytical formulation, commercial CFD software being used 

for the purpose, namely the CFX module of ANSYS 13. 

As discussed in Chapter 4, the porous components that were eventually ordered 

consisted of porous steel with spherical pores. This required the definition of several 

parameters necessary to the simulation, especially as far as the porous medium 

morphology was concerned, namely its volume porosity and its interfacial area density. 

It was assumed that different porosity grades represented equally sized spherical voids 

of diameter dp, the other important parameter being porosity, which can change for 

different types of packing and is a sufficient parameter to characterize the “packing” of 

the hollow spheres. The free volume Vvoid can be found from the number of pores and 

the volume of a single pore, Vvoid=NVp. Defining porosity ? as the ratio of free to total 

volumes: 

 

 void

and the volume of a single spherical void Vp, the number of voids per volume can be 

calculated as: 

 

 p

? = .  (3.16) 

 

The number of voids per unit volume nV is expressed as:

The specific interfacial surface area between the voids and the air can be defined

with Ap being the surface area of a single spherical void, the SI unit of the specific area

where Ap/Vp is the specific surface area of a single void. The surface area-to-volume 

ratio can be calculated for every object and this ratio is the smallest for a sphere. This 

means that the interfacial area calculation used here is underestimating the real area of 

non-ideal voids:

As mentioned when the construction of prototypes is discussed, the parts were 

made using sintered steel with 25% porosity consisting of interconnected pores 

averaging 7 µm in diameter dispersed throughout the material, thermal conductivity 

being similar to a 400-Series stainless steel for the solid matrix. These pore diameters, 

volume porosities and part total volumes led to an interfacial area density of about 

2.14×105 m-1, but it should be noted that the aforementioned grossly underestimates 

interfacial area due to the fact that the assumption of uniform and spherical pores is 

overly simplified. A look at the SEM (Scanning Electronic Microscopy) image 

illustrated in Figure 3.12 clearly shows that the voids are very irregular and have a 

large variation in volume in any such materials.

their volume (image courtesy of Applied Porous Technologies AB). 

 

Another parameter was necessary in order to run the simulations, namely the 

heat transfer coefficient between the fluid and solid phases. Setting this value is 

notoriously difficult given the complexity of the matter, and the large number of 

numerical and experimental studies published in recent years on this specific topic has 



143 

 

to do with the determination of adequate correlations for particular porous 

morphologies, materials, fluids and component geometries, in this context especially as 

far as Nusselt numbers or Reynolds numbers based on Darcian flow velocities that are 

strongly dependant of the listed variables [Boomsma et al. 2003]. Given the relative 

importance of the porous medium in the overall performance of the system, at least 

when compared with the behaviour of the transpiration airflow interacting with the 

perforated plate, temperatures at the interface between the plate and the porous 

medium were evaluated by carrying out parametric studies in order to evaluate the 

variations that this parameter can have, rather than developing an approach with the 

same level of analytical detail as used for instance in the evaluation of critical 

transpiration flows or the interaction between incoming radiation and the perforated 

pattern. The CFD simulations where the relationships above were put into used will be 

described in the next section 

Once the design principles stated above are used to determine some of the most 

important geometrical and dimensional features of the sensing element and to evaluate 

such important operational parameters as the transpiration airflows, the performance of 

the system as a whole must be studied, especially as far as the temperatures reached 

within the system for different incident radiation and transpiration airflow levels, as 

well as their variations in time, are concerned. 

3.4 Parametric Studies 

The main parametric studies conducted using ANSYS CFX have to do with the central 

principle underlying the instrument under discussion, namely the correlation between 

the temperature measured by a thermocouple attached to the centre of the 

microperforated plate that serves as a sensing element, and the various incident heat 

fluxes and transpiration airflows to which the element is exposed, the latter being 

either a radiative heat flux if the transpiration mass flow is supercritical or otherwise a 

convective and radiative total heat flux. The various dimensioning procedures were 

discussed above, and the parametric studies to be conducted using CFX allow to some 

extent an evaluation of their adequacy as far as the instrument’s overall thermal 

performance is concerned, especially regarding magnitude and time variation of the 

temperatures to be measured by the thermocouple. The reasonability of various 



144 

 

assumptions made in the development of the analytical model, for example ignoring the 

surface radiative emission term in the heat flux balance with hot surroundings, can also 

be validated in the numerical studies, since this emission term can be discounted if 

surface temperatures are comparatively low, as can be verified form the simulation 

results. 

Besides the validation of design options and dimensioning procedures, the 

question of determining which operational conditions are most adequate must be kept 

in mind and discussed in terms of transpiration and refrigeration airflows and their 

impact on measurements. The fact that measured temperatures result from the balance 

between incident radiation and the cooling effect of various transpiration mass flows is 

especially relevant both in the context of operational conditions and in the verification 

of the assumption that the radiative emission from the plate is to be discounted.  

The transient behaviour implied by the pulsed operation principle must also be 

adequately described for the various expected changes in incident heat fluxes and 

transpiration airflow. Of critical importance is the determination of acceptable limits to 

the thermocouple temperature when the transpiration airflow is significantly reduced or 

even switched off, in order to define adequate times for the induced pulsed behaviour. 

Central to characterizing the instrument’s performance is the relationship 

between the measured temperature (or the slope of its time variation curve), the 

incident heat flux and the various transpiration airflows. In order to proceed with such 

studies, some preparation is necessary in setting up the simulations. 

The basic configuration of the system has already been established and 

discussed, and the process of obtaining adequate CAD models for importation onto 

CFX was straightforward. However, the large difference in size between features of the 

models could be troublesome because of implications in terms of specifying an adequate 

computational mesh. An example is the transition from the very fine mesh necessary to 

adequately represent each hole in the perforated pattern, which requires several 

elements on the perimeter of hundreds of holes 0.1 mm in diameter, to the mesh 

located in the air of fluid domains located on either side of the plate and that extend 

for several centimetres.  



145 

 

As mentioned in Chapter 2, all simulations and calculations were carried out on 

a computer equipped with an Intel Core i7 processor at 2.93 GHz clock frequency and  

4 MB of RAM, on a Windows 7 64-bit operating system. As usual in applications of the 

kind, potential computational limitations arising from stringent mesh requirements can 

be alleviated by the possibility of making use of symmetries occurring in the system. In 

this particular case the overall geometry of the system consists of components with 

cylindrical components symmetrical in the angular direction, while at the level of the 

microperforated plate the pattern has an angular periodicity of 60º, as discussed above. 

This led to the specification of a geometry consisting of an angular sector of 60º with 

rotational symmetry boundary conditions specified on either side, as illustrated in 

Figure 3.13. 

As a standard procedure in numerical studies, mesh independence was 

attempted by evaluating changes in the temperature at the centre of the sensing 

element between successive refinements and stopping the refinement process when no 

significant changes occurred. Although differences in the monitored variable were 

already low (&amp;lt;5%), this process could not be continued due to a lack of memory in the 

system that caused the meshing program to exceed its limits in terms of memory 

allocation handling. Thus, the meshes used were the most refined usable ones resulting 

from this refinement process.  

Figure 3.13a illustrates the solid component of the computational domain (in 

blue), with the limits of the fluid domain shown in wireframe. The rotational symmetry 

about the z-axis is readily apparent and the 60º section of the perforated plate is shown 

placed on top of the cone, with its outer section overhanging it. This surface will be set 

as an imposed temperature boundary condition, since it corresponds to the surface of 

the porous holder where the plate will be attached. 

Symmetry and mass continuity require the specification of only one-sixth of the 

intended overall mass flow entering the inlet at the bottom at a specified pressure and 

temperature, while the upper part of the fluid domain is defined as an opening at 

atmospheric pressure and a set value of external blackbody temperature. The latter is 

defined as the effective blackbody temperature of any bodies beyond the boundary, 

which is exactly how the calibration furnace surfaces are intended to be represented. 



146 

 

Besides this external blackbody temperature the software also requires a local fluid 

temperature to be defined at the location of the boundary.  

Simulations were conducted in order to find out if the earlier assumption of 

small values of heating for the overall airflow crossing the perforated plate under 

typical furnace temperatures and transpiration mass flows was valid, as was found to 

be the case. This meant that the airflow was considered to be entering the domain at 

298 K (i.e. 25ºC) and the local fluid temperature at the opening was set at 300 K for 

most simulated situations. The only exception was the simulation of situations where 

the transpiration airflow is cut and the steady-state response of the sensor to 

convection and radiation was sought, in which case the local fluid temperature was 

conservatively set at the same value as the external blackbody temperature. The 

intended transient operation mode means that such situations will not be encountered 

in practice but temperatures potentially reached in those cases were nevertheless 

studied as an indication of extreme bounds for thermal levels although, as will be 

discussed in the following chapter, the situation of gas temperatures reaching the same 

values as those of the furnace surfaces is unrealistic. 

In this chapter the opening temperatures were set assuming a unitary 

emissivity, which is obviously not the case in the situations encountered in the 

experimental studies. Necessary adjustments to this parameter for comparison purposes 

will be discussed later in this text. 

Figure 3.13b shows the type of imposed boundary conditions, while Figure 3.14 

is a close-up view of the mesh at the level of the perforated pattern. Note that this 

configuration does not model the interaction of the refrigeration airflow with the porous 

medium. The integration of this factor into the simulation would require a less refined 

mesh to run due to system limitations encountered in the aforementioned refinement 

process.

Furthermore, the presence of a swirling component in the refrigeration airflow, 

injected tangentially in the non-porous casing base and intended to augment its 

residence time in the space between the solid cone and the porous holder, invalidates 

the use of the 60º symmetry. So, the refrigeration airflow and its interaction with the 

porous medium needs to be addressed in a different model. Moreover, this other model 

 

Figure 3.14 – Close-up view of the perforated pattern mesh. 



148 

 

will provide simulated values for the temperatures achieved at the surface where the 

perforated plate will be attached to the porous holder, which only emphasises its 

importance even if, as discussed below, the essential contribution in terms of system 

refrigeration comes without surprise from the transpiration airflow. 

The basic configuration of the model for studying the interaction of the 

refrigeration airflow with the porous medium is illustrated in Figure 3.15, where the 

tangential injection of the refrigeration airflow that provides the swirl component is 

visible. Both the transpiration and the refrigeration airflows can be seen in the form of 

streamlines, together with a plane showing the temperature distribution in the cone, 

the non-porous base and the porous holder. It should be noted how some of the 

streamlines actually cross the porous component. Results and implementation details of 

this model will be discussed further below.

refrigeration airflow. 

 

 



149 

 

Note that the microperforated pattern is not simulated in this model and 

understandably so considering the limitations encountered in simulating even one sixth 

of the perforated plate, as discussed above. This does not mean that this model does 

not consider the presence of the plate, but merely that the component was modelled as 

a porous medium for which an interfacial contact area between solid and fluid phases 

was calculated. This is a very straightforward process given the very well-ordered 

geometry of the perforated plate, where areas and volumes are easily calculated as 

discussed in the previous chapter, and heat transfer coefficients can likewise be 

calculated. 

3.4.1 Variations of Plate Temperatures with Incident Heat Fluxes 

The basic configuration illustrated in Figures 3.13 and 3.14 allows the simulation of a 

variety of situations. Of central interest within the framework under discussion is 

obviously the thermal response at the location where the thermocouple will be attached 

to the plate, that is, at its centre. This response must be evaluated as a function of a 

combination of incident heat fluxes and transpiration mass flows, but in order to 

understand the underlying influence of each of these factors their influence was studied 

separately, starting with a parametric study of the effect of incident heat fluxes. 

These heat fluxes are ultimately the result of placing the system in a furnace 

that for the moment will be assumed to have a unitary emissivity, although this is not 

necessarily the case in practice, as will be discussed later. This means that heat flux 

coming from the cavity defined by the surrounding furnace walls is assumed to 

correspond to the emissive behaviour of a blackbody, where the spectral emissive power 

of Equation 3.13 is integrated over the entire wavelength spectrum to give the 

blackbody total emissive power: 

 

 4
b

E T?= ,  (3.22) 

 

where ? is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. This means that the system must be able to 

cope with thermal conditions that become comparatively more stringent as the 

temperature of the surroundings increases, leading to a need for strong refrigeration 



150 

 

requirements in order to keep superficial plate temperatures sufficiently low to allow a 

discounting of the emission component.  

Since a significant amount of the plate refrigeration is provided by the 

transpiration airflow, this will lead to the use of comparatively high mass flows, as 

discussed below, but requires a study of the behaviour of plate temperatures under 

different incident heat fluxes for any given transpiration mass flow. 

A variety of simulations was carried out by setting increasing values of furnace 

temperature for a range of transpiration mass flows, but in order to study the influence 

of the received radiation on the plate temperatures, a given mass flow must be set. A 

fixed outer refrigeration temperature was assumed for the moment at 200ºC, although a 

more detailed study of this parameter will be performed and discussed later in the 

chapter when simulations or the porous medium are analyzed. 

Some of the assumptions made during the discussion of the analytical models in 

the previous chapter and the dimensioning procedures discussed above were verified, 

namely the very small temperature gradients across the plate’s thickness and the 

avoidance of choked flow conditions in the range of transpiration mass flows used in the 

simulations. The fact that these temperatures are also influenced by the sensing 

element’s emissivity must also be kept in mind, so a parametric study for this variable 

is also desirable. Shown in Figure 3.16 are the results of simulations at a fixed 

transpiration mass flow (1×10-3 kgs-1) for increasing radiation source temperatures, with 

three different plate emissivities. 

For the higher furnace temperatures, large differences in measured plate 

temperatures are apparent, which renders a precise determination of this parameter 

especially important.

Figure 3.16 – Plate temperatures as a function of furnace temperature and plate emissivity. 

 

The aforementioned plate temperatures are also especially relevant regarding 

the underlying assumption that the emission component of the radiative balance 

between the plate and its hot surroundings can de ignored. Surface temperatures must 

be kept to low values (e.g. smaller than 100ºC) in order not to invalidate this 

assumption. This in turn requires adequate plate cooling if the instrument is to work at 

high furnace temperatures, and most of the cooling will be provided by the 

transpiration airflow, as discussed in the next section. In any case, for low surroundings 

temperatures the radiative balance may not allow the convenient assumption of a non-

significant emissive component for the plate. Consequently, if a model that relies on 

such an assumption is to be comfortably used, high surroundings temperatures must be 

assumed. 

3.4.2 Variations of Plate Temperatures with Transpiration Mass 

Flows 

In a similar fashion to the simulations discussed before for the variations of plate 

temperatures with various incoming heat fluxes caused by blackbodies at various 

temperatures, simulations of the thermal behaviour of the plates can also be set up in 

order to study the influence of increasing mass flows, for a given heat source 

temperature. Such a study is especially relevant in order to evaluate the mass flows

necessary to enable neglecting the radiative emission of the plate, by studying the 

temperature distribution over it.  

Illustrated in Figure 3.17 is the variation of plate temperatures for the 

maximum furnace temperature of 1773 K and various transpiration mass flows and 

plate emissivities. Another less evident but nevertheless intuitive parameter must also 

be taken into account, and that is the temperature of the compressed air supply. While 

values measured in the laboratory in the months of August and September were 

typically between 20 and 25ºC and most of the time closer to the latter value (which 

for that motive was used as a reference in simulations), values measured in December 

could be as low as 10ºC, which rendered relevant a study of the influence of air supply 

temperature, since some differences are expected for lower heat flux levels and higher 

mass flows. This effect must be taken into account in practice for calibration and 

operation purposes, by specifying a correction coefficient for the airflow temperature 

that can take the form of the deviation percentage shown in Figure 3.18, where 

temperatures obtained at 10ºC are divided by those obtained at 25ºC.

These results emphasize the need of using relatively high transpiration mass 

flows for emission component minimization purposes. It should be kept in mind that 

higher mass flows could possibly lead to compressibility issues in the perforated plate. 

There is therefore a need to balance the sensitivity of the system with the assumption 

of insignificant emission values and the guarantee of boundary layer blow off. 

Besides boundary layer blow-off and refrigeration considerations requirements 

that tend to dictate that mass flows be kept as high as possible in most situations, the 

effect of increasingly high mass flows, obviously bounded by the onset of 

compressibility and choked flow, is to diminish the dependence of the instrument 

output on the mass flow, and this effect is visible in the asymptotic behaviour of the 

sensor temperature curves, that flatten for increasing mass flows.  

Attaining a temperature reading value independent of the mass flow may not be 

possible for the reasons mentioned above, but another effect of the high mass flows is to 

diminish the instrument’s sensitivity for a given furnace temperature range, since the 

relative magnitude of values measured by the thermocouple will be compressed, so to 

speak, to a narrower temperature range.

Illustrated in Table 3.4 are the maximum admissible temperatures that satisfy 

the 2% requirement, listed for various plate emissivities and furnace temperatures, 

assuming blackbody behaviour for the furnace cavity. A comparison between the values 

in the table and the graphs in Figures 3.16 and 3.18 shows that the fulfilment of the 

requirement is not particularly troublesome, even for blackbody furnaces and 

expectably even less so for sources with smaller emissivities. 

Likewise, a maximum value for the transpiration airflow can be defined for 

accuracy and sensitivity reasons, but while earlier transpiration radiometers relied on 

the measurement of a temperature difference that could be rendered too small for 

accuracy by high mass flows, the present instrument only measures one temperature. 

Its sensitivity over a range of temperatures is however strongly affected by the mass 

flow as mentioned above, but a mass flow value that would render the line slopes of 

Figure 3.18 too small to be meaningfully measured would be limited by the onset of 

choked flow conditions.

A sensitivity coefficient for the instrument can be defined as the ratio between 

its output signal and the received heat flux, the measured temperature also depending 

on the transpiration mass flow in addition to the received heat flux. The sensitivity 

coefficient can thus be plotted as the ratio Tmeasured ? qrec for the range of transpiration 

mass flows [Martins 1998]. 

A linear relationship will exist between the thermocouple reading and the fourth 

power of the furnace temperature, which multiplied by the Stefan-Boltzmann constant 

and the furnace cavity emissivity becomes the radiation emitted by the source. This 

linear relationship enables the determination of the heat flux for a given temperature 

reading, and can also be expressed in an inverse fashion, with the measured 

temperature as function of the incident heat flux. This alternate version represents the 

relationship between the instrument’s output and the incident radiation and is useful 

because the linear relationship is preserved when the incident radiation is divided by 

the mass flow at which the curve was obtained. This allows a direct representation of 

the linearity of the steady-state instrument response, each instrument having its 

particular curve as an individual characteristic [Martins 1998]. These considerations 

apply for steady state conditions, while the intended pulsed transpiration mode is 

intrinsically transient. The simulation of transient conditions will be discussed later, 

but such considerations are nevertheless useful given the fact that the instrument under 

discussion can conceivably be used as a conventional, steady state transpiration 



156 

 

radiometer, although this is not its intended function and its calibration in such 

conditions was not carried-out. 

3.4.3 External Refrigeration System Temperatures 

As mentioned above the presence of a swirling component in the refrigeration airflow, 

injected tangentially in the non-porous casing base and intended to augment its 

residence time in the space between the solid cone and the porous holder, makes the 

use of the 60º symmetry more problematic, first of all because more mesh elements 

would be needed. Periodic boundary conditions could have been used in order to 

reproduce the swirling airflow but a less computationally burdensome solution was used 

instead. With the exception of the microperforated plate, the geometry of all 

components, including the porous holder, is fully modelled. The microperforated plate 

is modelled as a second porous medium for which an interfacial contact area between 

solid and fluid phases was easily calculated given the very well-ordered geometry of the 

plate. 

Despite the fact that the bulk of the system refrigeration comes from the 

transpiration airflow, simulated values for the temperatures achieved at the surface 

where the perforated plate is attached to the porous holder were obtained in two 

distinct parametric studies. In all cases a heat transfer coefficient was set in the plate, 

with the same magnitude as discussed in Chapter 2 for the convection coefficient in the 

perforated pattern, but with a low, conservative value. Furnace temperatures were set 

at their maximum value of 1500ºC. In the first, the refrigeration airflow is set to zero 

while various transpiration mass flows are simulated passing through the perforated 

plate, corresponding to a situation where all the plate refrigeration comes from 

transpiration. A conservative value for the convection coefficient in the porous medium 

was assumed, and the radiation source was set as a blackbody, which will not 

necessarily be the case in practice. Average temperatures on the interface between the 

plate and the porous medium can be determined, as illustrated in Figure 3.19. These 

temperature values are useful because they can serve as pessimistic estimates for the 

fixed outer refrigeration temperature assumed in the parametric studies of plate 

temperatures. Figure 3.19 shows that the value set at 200ºC was indeed on the high 

side and that temperatures on the rim of the plate are lower. 



157 

 

 

Figure 3.19 – Average temperatures on the interface between the plate and the porous medium 

for various transpiration mass flows. 

 

In the second study the transpiration and refrigeration airflows were both set at 

0.0005 kgs-1 and the same temperatures as above were determined and are illustrated in 

Figure 3.20. The same conclusion as above regarding the fixed outer refrigeration 

temperature applies.

3.4.4 Transient Temperature Curves 

The intended pulsed operation mode for the instrument dictates that the transient 

behaviour of its sensing element be studied, when exposed to variations in incident heat 

flux, or more particularly in this context when variations occur in the transpiration 

airflow. 

Besides the matter of ascertaining whether the default airflow is supercritical or 

not and the implications of this fact on the nature of the heat flux being measured, the 

intensity of the pulses must be adjusted to ensure that temperature levels in the plate 

are kept within reasonable limits. Besides the obvious requirement of avoiding excessive 

temperatures that could damage the components of the system, the plate emission 

component of the radiative heat balance must be must once again be considered. 

A steady-state first approach to the problem will result in temperature profiles 

such as those illustrated in Figures 3.16 and 3.17, and temperature levels for the 

instrument operating purely as a radiometer can be evaluated in this way. Once the 

transpiration airflow is reduced or even shut down, temperatures will rapidly rise to 

high values, so it is impractical to keep the airflow at low levels for significant times. 

This is nevertheless an improvement over previous transpiration radiometers, where the 

transpiration airflow had to be kept at high values at all times in order not to 

compromise the sensing element’s cooling, transient behaviours being induced using 

mechanical shutters in front of the furnace openings. 

Various transient simulations were therefore conducted in order to gain some 

insight into the sensing element’s thermal behaviour when subjected to sudden 

variations in incident heat fluxes or transpiration mass flows. Such simulations were set 

up using the results of steady-state simulations as initial values and were especially 

intended to evaluate the slopes of the transient temperature curves to be expected in 

practice.  

The effect of increased furnace temperatures starting from a moderate initial 

value were simulated first, in a process akin to that described for the transient testing 

of earlier transpiration radiometers where the transient behaviours were obtained 

through the use of a mechanical shutter placed between the sensing element and the 

furnace. Illustrated in Figure 3.21 are transient temperature curves at the centre of the 



159 

 

plate for a situation where a 0.001 kgs-1 transpiration mass flow crosses the sensing 

element, initially for a blackbody cavity temperature of 1023 K and then subjected to 

steps in furnace temperature to 1273, 1523 and 1773 K. The surface emissivity of the 

sensing element was set at 0.8.  

Simulated next were more relevant situations where the transient behaviour is 

obtained by variations in the transpiration mass flow. The same initial situation as 

above was used, and steps in the initial 1 gs-1 mass flow were specified at 0.25, 0.5, 2.5 

and 5 gs-1 and no variation in the furnace temperature, with the resulting transient 

temperature curves at the centre of the plate illustrated in Figure 3.22.

Figure 3.22 – Transient temperature curves at the centre of the plate for various steps in 

transpiration mass flow and a constant furnace temperature. 

 

In all cases differences in the slopes of the transient temperature curves are 

evident, depending of the intensity of the driving force for the temperature variation, 

i.e. higher temperatures or more or less refrigeration, and as expected the intensity of 

the rate of change, materialized in the slopes, is higher for larger steps in temperature, 

positive for lessened transpiration airflows and negative (reflecting a cooling process) 

for heightened transpiration airflows.  

Notice that in all cases the transpiration airflow was never shut off, while the 

intended pulsed transpiration operation mode will demand such conditions, or at least 

will require significantly lower transpiration mass flows in order to enable the 

measurement of the convective component of the incident heat flux. 

 As mentioned earlier, such situations where the transpiration airflow is cut are 

simulated by setting the local fluid temperature at the same value as the external 

blackbody temperature, to get a sense of the magnitude of the slopes of the resulting 

temperature curves, that would never be allowed in practice but that could conceivably 

be encountered and dictate such transient responses before the transpiration mass flow 

was reset at its initial value.

The pulsed transpiration operation mode means that the stabilized temperature 

values shown above will never be reached due to a continuous switching on and off of 

the transpiration airflow. In practical terms this means that the temperature must be 

monitored and the electrovalve that controls the transpiration airflow must open when 

temperatures above a specified value are detected. On the other hand, as mentioned 

earlier, the valve does not have to stay shut until stable readings are obtained for the 

total heat flux, since measuring the slope of the transient temperature curve allows the 

anticipation of this steady-state value because of its proportionality to the incident 

heat flux [Hit 2004, Martins et al. 2006]. 

The use of short duration pulses is also relevant because if the on/off cycles are 

short enough, it can be assumed that conditions in the surroundings have not changed 

significantly and heat flux partitioning is achieved because both components of the 

total heat flux are measured, radiation directly and convection by difference between 

successive total flux and radiation measurements. This is possible provided that the 

data acquisition system has enough time resolution for the purpose and places 

challenges in terms of temporal resolution and noise levels that must be adequately 

addressed. 

The new element’s much lower thermal inertia makes for much faster 

temperature curve responses, which in turn allow the switching off of the transpiration 

airflow for very brief times that nevertheless allow sufficient temperature increases for 

curve slope calculation and total heat flux determination, although it is conceivable 

that in some situations it may be practical to wait for steady-state values if variations 

are sufficiently rapid, as would be the case in high temperature and high transpiration 

mass flows situations. 

The software does not allow the direct specification of two different alternate 

mass flows, so a step function (set either at a zero or one value) controlled by a sine 

function using the intended period as an argument was implemented to control the 

airflow value as a function of time.  

The adjustment of the periodicity of the mass flow pulses will be dictated by 

the instrument response as a function of prevalent temperatures and mass flow 



162 

 

combinations and will require some level of adjustment and calibration in any case to 

keep temperatures within reasonable bounds, as discussed further in Chapter 4. 

Illustrated in Figure 3.23 are CFX output graphs two different furnace 

temperature-transpiration airflow combinations where the measured temperature values 

are kept roughly within the same range by adjusting the pulse period. Temperatures 

rise when the airflow is set to zero by the step function and decreases when the mass 

flow is reset at its default specified value. Mass flows and furnace temperatures were in 

these cases set to moderate values in order to illustrate curves with equally moderate 

slopes. As discussed in Chapter 4, very steep variations are encountered in practice. 

 

Figure 3.23 – Transient temperatures in the plate. 

 

The intended transient transpiration mode means that the instrument 

calibration is not to be carried out as for conventional transpiration radiometer, but 

rather by determining the variation in slope of the transient temperature curves for a 

variety of conditions.  

Since a large number of on/off cycles (within limitations imposed by a minimum 

temperature interval necessary for slope determination and by the electrovalve 



163 

 

response) is expected to occur for any given time interval, a calibration process will 

consist of the analysis of response curve slopes with the intention of establishing a 

quantitative linear relationship between furnace set points, transpiration airflows and 

transient temperature curves slopes, as discussed in detail in Chapter 4. 

3.5 Concluding Remarks 

The dimensional and operational parameters that influence sensor performance were 

determined and discussed, based both on established analytical principles and on the 

simulation software that was compared to the analytical models discussed in the 

previous chapter. 

Assumptions and simplifications made in the process of developing the 

analytical model were discussed and found to be reasonable. 

Ranges for the relevant mass flow values to be used for the intended range of 

furnace working temperatures could also be identified in order to guarantee the 

simplification of the radiative balance between the plate and its surroundings and to 

ensure proper boundary layer control while avoiding compressibility phenomena. The 

instrument’s transient behaviour was also found to be within expectations and the 

proposed external cooling system was likewise found satisfactory in theory. 

These procedures in turn led to the building of the prototypes discussed in the 

following chapter and provided the framework to evaluate their performance, by 

comparison with simulated values determined using the methodologies discussed above, 

although necessary adjustments naturally had to be made in order to accommodate 

differences dictated by laboratory conditions.

CHAPTER 4 

EXPERIMENTAL STUDY 

 

A detailed discussion of the experimental setup is presented along with 

the presentation and discussion of data acquisition and control setups. 

The specifications of the various components that were used in the 

course of the experimental work are presented and their integration 

into the data acquisition and control system are detailed along with 

implemented methodologies and procedures. Special relevance is given 

to the data processing flow and operations. Measurements carried out 

with the discussed setup are described and relevant comparisons with 

previously developed analytical and numerical models are made against 

experimental data. Instrument calibration procedures are also 

proposed, described and discussed, together with the experimental 

uncertainty analysis. 

 

4.1 Introduction 

In the previous chapter design strategies based on the use of analytical and numerical 

models for the heat and mass transfer phenomena in the sensing element were 

presented, discussed and used to build design rules in order to meet requirements, 

prototypes of the instrument being built based on those design rules. 

These prototypes are identical as far as their principal physical features are 

concerned, although small differences resulting from the various manufacturing and 

assembly processes cannot be ruled out and will addressed later in order to verify if 

significant biases are induced. In the present chapter the experimental verification of 

the instrument prototypes is presented and discussed.  

The chapter starts with a discussion of the experimental setup and of the 

equipment selection procedures, along with the presentation and discussion of data 

acquisition and control setups. The various components that were used in the course of 

the experimental work are presented, while their integration into the data acquisition 

and control system is detailed along with implemented methodologies and procedures, 



166 

 

including the data processing flow and operations. Measurements carried out with the 

discussed setup are described and relevant comparisons with previously developed 

analytical and numerical models are made against experimental data. Instrument 

calibration procedures are also discussed.  

4.2 Integrated Hardware and the Prototype 

The essential components of the experimental set-up comprise the above-described flux 

meter instrument, a radiation source and a data acquisition and processing system, as 

illustrated in Figure 4.1. Characteristics of the various components are given in detail 

in the next paragraphs. 

 

 

The transpiration gas mass flow rate control and measurement is a fundamental 

aspect in the operation the present instrument, and accurate heat flux measurements 

are dependent not only of an accurate measurement of the temperature in the 

microperforated plate but also of a precise control and measurement of the 

transpiration gas mass flow rate. 

As mentioned earlier, compressed air was chosen as the transpiration gas. A 

pressure regulator, a gas filter, a rotameter and two manometers compose the TG 

control unit. The pressure regulator has the function of uncoupling the pressure in the 

 

Figure 4.1 – Experimental System. 



167 

 

instrument air circuit from that in the air supply line. Without this regulator, any 

pressure fluctuation in the line would be transmitted to the instrument circuit resulting 

in TG mass flow fluctuations affecting the instrument readings. The filter was chosen 

so that its grade efficiency is higher to that of the porous disc material, filtering 

particles as small as 5 µm.  

The rotameter (and its associated needle valve) has the function of controlling 

and measuring the TG mass flow rate. Depending on the TG mass flow rate, different 

pressure levels are obtained downstream, so that a manometer is required to calculate 

the actual mass flow rate. Figure 4.2 shows a photograph of the TG control unity panel 

together with the corresponding diagram. A digital mass flow meter was also available 

and was tested, showing similar readings to those of the rotameter. Since the latter 

caused lesser pressure losses and was easier to control, it was used preferentially. 

The pressure regulator and the filter are standard pneumatic devices from 

Parker Hannifin Co. with a maximum input pressure of 10 bar and a maximum output 

pressure of 6 bar. The rotameter is an Omega Engineering instrument (FL-3840ST 

model) with maximum output of 40 SLPM of air at 20ºC and 1.013 bar, an accuracy of 

±2% FS and a repeatability of ±0.25% FS. The manometers are manufactured by 

VDO and have a maximum output of 4 bar and an accuracy of ±2.5% FS. Only the 

transpiration airflow is connected to this setup, the refrigeration airflow being 

connected to the same compressed air supply but without any control besides 

preliminary checks that were sufficient to ensure that the refrigeration mass flow values 

employed in the simulations discussed in Chapter 3 were actually exceeded in practice, 

although in part due to some leakage within the sensor casing, as discussed further 

below. 

The overall configuration of the instrument was discussed in Chapter 3, along 

with the dimensioning if the main features of the most important system components, 

namely the microperforated plate, the airflow separation cone, the porous outer casing 

and the non-porous base on top of which the porous holder is placed. The 

aforementioned components are illustrated and briefly discussed below. 



168 

 

 
 

Figure 4.2 – Photograph and diagram of the TG measurement and control unit, 

showing the pressure regulator (a), the rotameter (b) and the manometer (c). 

 

Each component was ordered in a total of 12 units with the available budget, 

except for the perforated plates, of which 50 were purchased.  It was at first thought to 

keep some components in reserve but the decision was eventually taken to incorporate 

all available parts into prototypes, since some level of damage to the parts was to be 

expected during testing and valuable time could be lost waiting for the assembly of new 

prototypes. 

A major concern was the robustness, or lack thereof, of the attachment of the 

thermocouple to the perforated plate. While some of the weldings eventually broke, 

mainly due to some rough handling such as being dropped, others resisted quite well, 

which indicates a need to improve both the robustness of the joint itself and the 

repeatability of the welding process, transforming it from an artisanal task into an 

industrial process. 

 The microperforated plate is arguably the most important component given its 

function as a sensing element and as fundamental in preserving the transpiration 

principle. As discussed earlier a survey of providers, manufacturing technologies and 

prices for obtaining the plates resulted in the selection of photo-etched components that 

made holes with diameters smaller than the plate thickness extremely difficult to 

obtain, thus placing limits on hole diameter to plate thickness ratios.

169 

 

The stainless steel plates were provided by a leading photoetched component 

manufacturer, Precision Micro Ltd of Birmingham, UK. As illustrated in Figure 4.3 the 

process require some adjustments but did eventually result in the intended perforated 

pattern. In order to increase their emissivity, an oxidisation procedure consisting in 

keeping their temperature at 850ºC for approximately 8 hours was performed, although 

a totally uniform matte black colour for the whole surface was not achieved. Figure 4.4 

shows an oxidized plate after it was mated to the porous holder and with the 

thermocouple laser-welded on, together with a non-oxidized sample. A difference in 

surface colour is apparent but the surface is still highly specular, so this treatment 

probably had little effect and the surface emissivity is probably close to that of the 

original non-oxidized stainless steel. 

The determination of surface emissivities is a field of its own and has given rise 

to a large number of publication, including detailed studies for relevant emissivity 

measurement methodologies in materials of interest such as different types of steel at 

comparatively low temperatures [Carpenter and Sewell 1962], or for much higher 

temperature values [Paloposki and Liedquist 2005], as well as for other metallic alloys 

[Maynard 2011]. In any case it is apparent that the emissivity values usually 

encountered in technical tables are consistent and generally accurate, and indicate that 

emissivities for polished, non-oxidized stainless steel such as the one received from the 

manufacturer typically has a surface emissivity lower than 0.2 and potentially as small 

as 0.1. 

The temperature and time of this oxidization process could have been increased, 

but given the plate’s very low thickness and small hole diameters there were some 

concerns that stronger oxidization could weaken the component and render it unable to 

withstand the air pressure from the transpiration airflow, so the matter was not 

pursued further.

Illustrated next in Figures 4.5 and 4.6 are the stainless steel non-porous base 

(including the refrigeration airflow tubing) and airflow separation cone (including the 

small hole where the thermocouple is passed). Both components were machined used 

standard turning and milling equipment, and sourced from local manufacturers. The 

cone was the more difficult of the two to obtain, given the need of long and thin 

turning cutting tools for the machining of its inner cavity. This capability was not as 

easy to find locally as expected but was nevertheless found at in injection moulds 

manufacturing company in the Aveiro region, without the need of purchasing special 

tools for the purpose.

microperforated pattern.

Illustrated next is the porous holder (Figure 4.7). This component was 

somewhat more difficult to obtain, for various reasons.  

Some companies specializing in porous components were contacted in order to 

ascertain their capabilities in terms of part specifications, both in terms of porosity 

parameters and achievable dimensional tolerances. The latter item was especially 

relevant because of the small dimensions of some parts of the components. These were 

typically obtained by building moulds which were then filled with small diameter metal 

spheres that were subsequently sintered. Given the fact that a relatively small number 

of components was to be ordered for the prototypes, delivery times and most of all 

prices were regarded as being unreasonable because they represented a significant 

portion of the available budget. Smaller unit prices could only have been obtained for 

much larger orders that would have been too costly to consider, especially as far as 

early prototypes are concerned, since lessons learned during this study could not have 

been incorporated. There was therefore a need to find a viable alternative.

Some industries rely on porous steel components that are machined from porous 

blocks rather than moulded. Plastic injection mould manufacturers, for instance, use 

porous steel in some parts of the moulds for degassing purposes, and such parts could 

be machined from commercially available porous blocks. The porosity parameters were 

not necessarily optimal regarding the porous medium performance but some 

compromise was necessary if components were to be obtained at a reasonable cost for 

an adequate performance. This less optimal solution meant that there was not as much 

freedom of choice in terms of unit cell and pore configurations as for a custom made 

porous medium. This in turn did not for instance allow the selection of better studied 

porous structures for which more analytical and empirical relationships would have 

been available for use in the numerical studies mentioned in the previous chapter. 

The parts were thus made using metal manufactured by International Mould 

Steel, Inc. of Florence, Kentucky, USA. Porcerax II comes as sintered steel blocks with 

25% porosity, consisting of interconnected pores averaging 7 microns in diameter, 

dispersed throughout the material. Thermal conductivity is similar to a 400 Series 

stainless steel. 

 

 

Several processing technologies for obtaining the final components can be used, 

although EDM (Electrical Discharge Machining) is recommended in order to maximize 

venting. This was done but in turn led to the occurrence of another potentially serious 

problem. Component specifications were provided to a local company with EDM 

 

Figure 4.7 – Porous holder. 



173 

 

equipment and manufacturing proceeded without problems until the final step, where 

an employee polished the parts in order to make them look better. This obviously led 

to concerns regarding the maintenance of the surface porosity. Another EDM passage 

was then performed and the components duly exhibited the rough surfaces typically 

obtained with EDM, but the extent to which polished could have affected porosity 

along the component’s thickness remained. 

Once the prototypes were assembled and the compressed air lines were 

connected, very little airflow was apparent by touch through the porous medium, which 

was not completely unexpected considering the results of the CFD simulations 

described in Chapter 3.  

A very simple test was nevertheless carried out in order to illustrate the passage 

of the refrigeration airflow through the porous medium, using a drop of dishwashing 

liquid detergent dissolved in water. By dipping a fingertip in that water and then 

touching the porous component, thus leaving a small amount of water on top of it, a 

foaming of the detergent could immediately be observed, proving the passage of the 

airflow, as illustrated in Figure 4.8. 

 

 

Figure 4.8 – Porosity verification. 

 

The matter of assembling the aforementioned components naturally came about 

next. One of the interesting aspects of the proposals received from the porous 

component manufacturers was the option of having all components built, assembled 

and factory-tested for airtightness. The greater part of the costs was that of the porous 



174 

 

components themselves, and as mentioned earlier was in itself sufficient to make finding 

another option necessary, but such an option would have been the most interesting 

from a strictly technical point of view, if financially unpractical. It should nevertheless 

be considered in future versions of the instrument, especially if the patenting process 

proceeds further. 

Since all components, including the central sheathed thermocouple, were 

metallic in nature, some form of welding and brazing process was envisaged for their 

assembly. Local industries and workshops with welding capabilities were contacted but 

replied that they were not up to the task of handling such small components, especially 

the thermocouple.  

Watchmakers or jewellers with the ability to carry out repairs were then sought 

but such capabilities were found to be not as widespread as they once were. Watches 

are nowadays much more reliable than several decades ago, while typically either much 

cheaper and not worth repairing, or expensive but usually sent back to the 

manufacturer for repairs. Jewellery is another matter and repairs must indeed take 

place, usually being subcontracted to specialists that recommended contacting the 

institution where most of them get their training. 

The Portuguese Professional Training Centre for the Jewelry and Watchmaking 

Industries (CINDOR - Centro de Formação Profissional da Indústria de Ourivesaria e 

Relojoaria) was therefore contracted and one of the teachers at the institution proved 

able and willing to provide the necessary assembly services for a very reasonable fee. 

The thermocouple was thus laser welded to the plate and the remaining components 

were brazed to each other. This artisanal method proved sufficient in this early 

prototype phase of development but more systematic and repeatable industrial 

processes are necessary if and when commercial instruments are to be built, this matter 

and its implications being addressed in greater detail later on. 

Temperature measurements in the microperforated plate are made using 

ungrounded 0.25 mm diameter, stainless steel sheathed, K-Type Omega thermocouples 

(KMQSS-IM025U-300) that are passed inside the conic element through a sealed hole 

in its lower tube and are then laser-welded to the centre of the microperforated plate. 

Shown in Figure 4.9 is a close-up of the thermocouple attachment to the plate, once the 



175 

 

later has been brazed into place at the top of the porous holder.  The temperature 

probes’ output was verified for 273.15ºC and 373.15ºC and a maximum relative error of 

± 0.2 % was found, both using the thermocouple calibration hardware available in the 

laboratory and the traditional boiling water/melting ice method. 

 

 

Figure 4.9 – Thermocouple attachment. 

 

As discussed earlier one of the most important objectives was to significantly 

diminish the overall dimensions of the system, when compared with earlier 

transpiration radiometers. The achievement of this objective is readily visible in      

Fig. 4.10, where the proposed instrument is compared with an earlier, water cooled 

system [Martins 1998]. Shown are the water inlet, outlet and circulation system, the 

transpiration airflow conduit and the two thermocouples required by the older 

instrument. The newer system is much smaller thanks to its lower refrigeration 

necessities, which allow the use of a much more compact air refrigeration system. The 

difference in frontal area between systems is shown, being a potential issue in the 

installation of the sensors in systems where dimensions are restrictive factors. The 

earlier system is however more robust in actual operation, but this fact was a foregone 

conclusion evident from the start and was not the central issue. 

 Visible are the transpiration and refrigeration compressed air tubes. The latter 

is wrapped in aluminium adhesive foil in order to reflect radiative heat coming from the 

calibration furnace and avoid damage to the plastic tubing, given its proximity to the 



176 

 

furnace aperture and the fact that unlike the transpiration tubing it is not shielded by 

the instrument body. A more detailed view of the prototype can be seen in Figure. 

4.11. 

 

 

Figure 4.10 – Size comparison between the proposed instrument and an earlier, water cooled 

system. 

 

 

Figure 4.11 – Assembled prototype. 



177 

 

Some other problems became apparent during testing. It was found that the 

aluminium adhesive foil intended to avoid damage to the plastic tubing by reflecting 

radiation coming from the furnace was not sufficient for the purpose. The plastic tubing 

was not affected directly, but the adhesive that was used to glue it to the metal tube 

was degraded, leading to its detachment under operation. Additional shielding was 

therefore needed and provided as illustrated in Figure 4.12. It consists of a thin metal 

plate coated with reflective material that is fitted to the front of the furnace using 

adjusting and spacing nuts. The plate has a central opening with a diameter such that 

only the instrument body can be fitted through it, leaving the refrigeration tubing on 

the outside. 

 

 

Even this shielding was not sufficient depending of the configuration of the 

radiation source, which brings us to the matter of discussing its nature. 

The primary radiation source, located in the laboratory of the Mechanical 

Engineering Department of the University of Aveiro, is a GERO RO 30-200 tubular 

furnace capable of reaching temperatures up to 1500ºC. The furnace cavity is 30 mm in 

diameter, 350 mm in length and is heated over the central 200 mm of its length. The 

heating module consists of electric resistance MoSi2 wire coiled around a ceramic tube, 

integrated in light ceramic fibre insulation with a perforated stainless steel sheet

178 

 

housing. The cavity’s aspect ratio does not, however, insure that the radiating cavity 

can be considered as a black body, given verified temperature non-uniformities along 

the tube, as summarized in Table 4.1. 

 

Table 4.1 – Furnace axial temperature profiles

If the furnace was to be reliably used for calibration purposes, its cavity’s 

emissivity needed to be determined in order to quantify the amount of thermal 

radiation that exits the cavity as a function of the furnace controller set point. A NEC 

TH-9100 infrared camera was used to measure the temperature of the cavity, averaged 

over its whole area and assuming a unitary emissivity. The apparent emissivity can be 

defined as the ratio between the measured temperature value and the furnace set point:

? =   (4.1) 

 

Measurements were carried out over 4 days with ambient temperatures ranging 

between 21 and 25ºC for furnace set points of 750, 1000, 1250 and 1500ºC. These 

measurements lead to the calculated apparent cavity emissivities shown in Figure 4.13 

along with the underlying linear relationship, plotted using the averages of the cavity 

temperatures and displaying the associated linear regression parameters. 



179 

 

 

For a 95% confidence interval, the apparent emissivity distributions yield the 

relationship shown below: 

 

 3
app

0.305 1.4 10? ?= ± ×   (4.2) 

 

This emissivity is for a situation where the end of the tubular furnace opposite 

to the instrument location is not fitted with the ceramic plug provided precisely for this 

purpose, as illustrated in Figure 4.14, where both options are shown. 

 This open-end configuration had to be used because of the interaction between 

the transpiration airflow and the furnace, especially at high set point temperatures. 

With the other end closed, the transpiration airflow heated up significantly inside the 

furnace cavity and was blown back towards the instrument, degrading the integrity of 

the compressed air tubes and their gluing to the sensor casing, and degrading the 

aluminium foil coatings of the shielding shown in Figure 4.12.  

Tests could thus not proceed in such conditions and the plug had to be removed 

to avoid the problem of the hot gas blowback. The use of the plug would have been 

beneficial from the point of view of the apparent furnace emissivity, since it would have 

reflected some radiation directly to the surface across the length of the cavity and 

certainly heated significantly and emitted a large amount of radiation, since it becomes

visibly red-hot. Apparent emissivities measured at the sensor location were shown to be 

much higher with the plug fitted. The plug can be modified by performing an oblique 

perforation that would enable the hot transpiration airflow to exit the cavity, without 

allowing radiation to directly escape the cavity. 

 

 

The absence of the plug opens a significant area to cold surroundings, causing a 

large radiative transfer due to a large temperature difference even for surfaces where 

the radiative view factor is not very large, as is the case of the central, heated portion 

of the cavity. Without surprise, the apparent emissivity for the configuration where the 

plug is fitted is: 

 

 4
app

0.88 1.82 10? ?= ± ×   (4.3) 

 

As discussed below, this must be taken into account when measurements are 

compared with the simulations discussed in Chapter 3, since those were set up using 

unitary emissivities. 

Once the emissivity can be safely dealt with, other measurements can take 

place. More particularly, some contamination of the transpiration airflow by the 

refrigeration airflow was detected, in the sense that some refrigeration compressed air

and without the ceramic plug fitted. 



181 

 

crossed the sensing element due to perfectible welded joints between the porous holder 

and the interior cone. Given the fact that the measurement of the transpiration mass 

flow is a central element in the instrument’s operation principle it was fundamental to 

quantify the magnitude of this contamination. 

This was measured, for various refrigeration mass flows, by tightly fitting each 

sensor to a tube linked to a Omega FMA 1816 digital gas mass flowmeter while 

plugging the transpiration air inlet in order to ensure that all the possible leakage flows 

through the sensing element. The flowmeter has a 0-2 SLPM range with an accuracy of 

±1.5 % FS. This setup is illustrated in Fig. 4.15. 

 

 

The instruments were connected directly to the compressed air system and 

tested at various pressures up to 5 bar. Measurements were repeated three times for 

each instrument and the mean value at each pressure was determined with the 

objective of determining the three units with the smaller contamination values, to be 

used in subsequent tests, where one of these eventually suffered damage in consequence. 

As expected beforehand, airflow contamination was found to increase linearly 

with pressure to a maximum at 5 bar. The highest contamination airflow registered was 

1.43 SLPM but even at 5 bar the selected instruments registered an average 

contamination airflow of 0.67 SLPM. This is a very small value when compared to the 

 

Figure 4.15 – Transpiration airflow contamination measurement. 



182 

 

transpiration airflows, meaning that in practice the measured transpiration mass flows 

do not require an adjustment taking this contamination into account. 

The output of the thermocouple was read using an Omega Engineering Inc. 

instruNET series INET-100b acquisition and control system. InstruNet provides 

microvolt-range absolute accuracy, using a topology where the analogue electronics are 

close to the sensor in electrically quiet boxes outside the PC, and noisy digital 

electronics are left inside the computer. The external box contains signal conditioning 

amplifiers for each channel and can be directly attached to sensors such as 

thermocouples, returning engineering units to the PC (e.g. °C or volts). The controller 

contains a 32 bit microprocessor with 256KB of RAM that manages the external 

“network” of devices and all real-time tasks are off-loaded to this processor, not 

burdening the host computer with real-time issues. The instruNet iNET-100 box 

provides 16 single-ended/8 differential analogue inputs, 8 analogue outputs and 8 

digital I/O lines. The instruNet system supports the digitizing of multiple channels at a 

maximum aggregate sample rate of 166Ks/sec, where each channel can be digitized at 

its own rate. According to specifications, K-type thermocouples connected to the 

system have accuracies (including cold junction compensation, voltage measurement 

and linearization errors) of ±0.6ºC in the temperature range of interest. 

Regarding the analysis of the instrument’s transient response, the setup only 

had to be slightly adjusted. A bifurcation in the compressed air supply before the 

manometers and the rotameter provides the non-controlled refrigeration airflow, while 

the remainder of the air supply proceed to these control units in order to allow the 

control and measurement of the transpiration airflow using an electrovalve that is 

commanded by the data acquisition system that monitors the instrument’s output. 

Upper and lower temperature limits can be defined for switching on and off the 

airflow, or varying it between upper and lower values if the option of switching it off 

completely is not retained. The easiest way of implementing a complete elimination of 

the airflow in its off position is merely disconnecting the tubing from the regulator on 

the adequate side of the valve. 

This can be implemented by feeding the transpiration airflow through two 

previously adjusted flow regulators, depending of the position of the electrovalve, 



183 

 

resulting in the configuration illustrated in Figure 4.16, while Figure 4.17 illustrated the 

electrovalve and the flow regulators themselves.

4.3 Experimental Results 

The experimental testing of the instrument included cool and hot experiments, the 

latter being carried out both in steady state and in transient conditions. Broadly 

speaking, such tests can be said to have the following objectives: 

• To confirm previously discussed mathematical and especially physical 

assumptions; 

• To test the instrument’s repeatability; 

• To establish a calibration procedure and calibrate the instruments; 

• To seek possible additional relevant and unforeseen phenomena and effects. 

For that purpose the instrument’s output as a function of various transpiration 

mass flows and incident heat fluxes was studied, especially regarding the transient 

experiments in order to establish the calibration of the instrument working as a 

transient transpiration heat flux meter. 

The aforementioned three units with lesser airflow contamination values were 

tested in order to verify the repeatability of the experimental results and establish the 

instrument calibration curve. The tested instruments will henceforth be designated as 

Sensor 1, Sensor 2 and Sensor 3. 

During cool experiments the radiation heat flux is negligible because the 

instrument is exposed to room temperature, while in for the hot experiments the 

instrument output is monitored for different known heat flux levels. These steady state 

experiments were followed by a study of the transient response of the instruments, 

namely the determination of the slopes associated with their temperature response 

curves, and their calibration. 

The cool experiments are intended to establish a reference output for a null 

input that can be used to check and correct possible bias errors. The hot experiments, 

on the other hand, are meant to verify the instrument performance in comparison with 

numerical predictions obtained earlier. Despite the fact the instrument is intended to 

have an intrinsically transient operation mode, steady-state calibration curves could be 

obtained at this point. This was not done given the intended transient operation, but 



185 

 

the instrument can always be looked upon as a steady-state instrument if the pulsed 

airflow is maintained at a constant value.   

The transient experiments are foremost in importance since they are meant to 

establish the instrument’s transient operation mode calibration curves, i.e. when the 

pulsed operation principle is used, where a linear relationship between the slope of the 

transient temperature curve at the start of the pulse and the incoming heat flux is 

anticipated, as stated in Equation 2.1. 

During the setting up of the experiment, special care was required in order to 

reduce the noise associated to the thermocouple readings. This aspect was particularly 

important due to the low temperature levels to be measured, given the fact that the 

surface temperatures of the sensing element were to be kept relatively low, as 

mentioned earlier. For that purpose, sheathed thermocouples were used and the sheaths 

were connected to a common ground. 

In the steady-state mode experiments, after each temperature or airflow level 

variation, 5 minutes were allowed in order to let readings stabilize and the temperature 

measurements where then conducted during another 5 minutes at a 10 Hz sampling 

rate. The averaged temperature value for one second was taken as representative of the 

instantaneous temperature, and the variation of this instantaneous value was then 

analyzed over the whole sampling time. No need was found to make further 

adjustments since the observed fluctuations in signal fell within the range of 

thermocouple error, obviously unlike the situation described below regarding the setup 

for transient measurements. 

For the cool experiments, the instrument output was registered for different TG 

mass flow rates similar to those later considered for the hot experiments. The cooling 

system was active but the sensing surface was not receiving any relevant incident heat 

flux, while for the hot experiments the source furnace was heated up to the various set 

points and staged at that temperature until stable temperature levels were attained. 

The transpiration and refrigeration airflows were then set to the appropriate levels and 

the heat flux meter was placed into the furnace cavity, at a position and depth where 

the temperature measured by the thermocouple stabilises at the highest level, in order 

to minimize edge effects from the furnace cavity. 



186 

 

The radiation source temperature was continuously monitored and the 

temperature readings from the flux meter thermocouples were taken after a stable 

condition in the radiation source was obtained, as explained above. For each radiation 

flux level, different transpiration gas mass flows were considered and the corresponding 

flux meter output temperatures were read. Each measurement condition, defined by the 

radiation source temperature and the TG mass flow rate was repeated five times.  

The values considered for the radiation source temperature are listed in     

Table 4.2 together with the corresponding blackbody radiation fluxes. As mentioned 

earlier, care must be taken when analyzing results given the fact that these values are 

for blackbody emission and as mentioned earlier correction factors must be introduced 

depending of the experimental setup used. In the case under discussion the furnace 

emissivity was corrected using Equation 4.2 and the emitted radiation was calculated 

accordingly, as described in Table 4.2. It is readily visible that the low apparent 

emissivity of the furnace to be employed has strongly detrimental effects as far as 

reachable heat flux levels are concerned, thereby limiting the testing range of the 

instruments under discussion.

Regarding transpiration mass flows, a rotameter was used in order to set 6 

volumetric flow levels (measured in the rotameter linear scale at 50, 70, 90, 110, 130 

and 150mm) for each run, airflow pressures and temperatures being registered and used 

to compute mass flow rates from the volumetric rates using the calibration curve 

provided by the manufacturer. 

Considering the number of set points for the radiation source temperature (5) 

and transpiration mass flows (6) above, thirty different steady-state operation 



187 

 

conditions were verified for each prototype. In addition, each working condition was 

verified five times, resulting in one hundred and twenty independent measurements for 

the experimental verification of each instrument. 

The setup for the transient experimental is the same from the point of view of 

the use of the basic hardware, except for the fundamental issue of the implementation 

of the pulsed transpiration airflow. As discussed above this requires the use of the setup 

illustrated in Figures 4.15 and 4.16 and different procedures in terms of signal 

acquisition and processing, as discussed below in the relevant section. 

The instrument output should ideally be zero for a null incident flux but there 

are a number of phenomena that may induce deviations from such an ideal scenario, 

resulting in bias errors. The output signal for a null heat flux can thus be useful in 

order to correct such errors. The same overall behaviour is apparent for all three 

instruments and the example of Sensor 1 is illustrated in Figure 4.18, showing 

measured temperatures in five runs for each instrument where mass flows were 

gradually increased.  

The temperature scale shows that differences are negligible but an underlying 

physical phenomenon is nevertheless evident. Similar effects were observed in earlier 

applications of transpiration radiometers [Martins 1998]. Different phenomena may 

contribute for the results shown but it is not possible obtain a conclusion with the 

available data. A global cooling effect due to the gas expansion after it passes through 

the perforated pattern may be present, and the slight increase in temperature observed 

for low mass flows can be due to some heating due to some amount of compression as 

the air passes through the perforated pattern that is overwhelmed by the expansion 

cooling process at higher mass flows. The relatively low velocities involved, even within 

the holes, are not expected to lead to a heat generation due to friction to play an 

important role.  



188 

 

 

Figure 4.18 – Sensor 1 cool experiment measured temperatures. 

 

The matter is somewhat irrelevant for the intended transient conditions, due to 

the large number of cycles occurring in very short times that lead to comparatively 

higher plate temperatures and especially because in the transient mode the heat flux is 

determined based on the sensing element temperature variation with time and not on 

its absolute value, as would be the case in the steady state mode. 

As mentioned earlier the hot experiments are intended to verify the 

instrument’s response to different heat flux levels, under different operating conditions 

defined by various transpiration mass flows. The results for the upper attainable 

furnace temperatures of 1500ºC must be taken with some caution due to the cooling 

load of the transpiration gas in the furnace cavity together with the latter’s power 

limitation, resulting in an effective lower temperature in the furnace cavity and 

consequently in a lower heat flux.  

When the higher mass flows where used the furnace visibly struggled to achieve 

the required set point temperature, so that the aforementioned ceramic plug was placed 

in a partially closed position to enable some of the hot gas blowback discussed above to 

allow the furnace to reach higher temperatures. This in turn led to a need to use even 

more tubing shielding on the compressed air feed lines.

This procedure was tried but the variation induced in the furnace’s apparent 

emissivity was felt to render the measured temperatures unreliable, so the values for 

the 1500ºC set point in the furnace were left out of the steady-state experimental 

analysis. 

Curves such as those illustrated in the previous chapter, where measured plate 

temperatures are shown to be a function of furnace temperatures and transpiration 

mass flows, were obtained and show the same overall behaviour with one notable 

exception: the measured temperature scale is expectedly lower than the values 

simulated for blackbody sources due to the lower apparent emissivity of the cavity of 

the furnace employed in the laboratory experiment.  

The curves obtained for blackbody sources discussed in Chapter 3 must be 

adapted for comparison purposes between the numerical model and the experimental 

values, so new curves were obtained by correcting the blackbody temperature using the 

apparent emissivity in Equation 4.3. As in Chapter 3 and for model validation 

purposes, these curves were obtained for a range of plate emissivities that allow a 

comparison with the experimental response curve, as shown in Figure 4.19, where the 

means of the values obtained in the five runs conducted for each of the 3 sensors are 

also displayed with 2% error bars on the lower simulated values. A mass flow of    

0.001 kgs-1 was considered and the corrected heat fluxes are those of Table 4.2.  

The experimental values are consistent with a sensor surface emissivity of 

around 0.25, indicating that the oxidization process did not lead to the intended high 

emissivities. This is nevertheless somewhat irrelevant given the intended transient 

operation mode where the heat flux is determined based on the sensing element 

temperature variation with time. 

The instrument’s performance over long times was evaluated by placing one of 

the tested instruments in a larger furnace than the one discussed above, made available 

for a limited time at the Department of Ceramics and Glass Engineering of the 

University of Aveiro. Two 8 hour runs at its maximum temperature of 1300ºC on two 

consecutive days were conducted in a closed furnace with a circular opening in its door, 

rendering the emissivity much higher than for the tubular furnace discussed above and 

thus exposing the sensing element to much higher radiative heat fluxes. 



190 

 

 

Figure 4.19 – Numerical temperatures for the corrected furnace emissivity, various element 

emissivities and experimentally measured values for the same operational conditions. 

 

The small diameter and large thickness of the opening in the furnace’s door 

rendered impossible the use of the refrigeration airflow tubing, so that the instrument 

was used with only the transpiration airflow switched on, with glass wool placed 

around the instrument in order to close the gap with the opening. The interior of the 

furnace had significant amounts of ceramic dust particles that were stirred by the 

transpiration airflow, thus replicating the aggressive and dirty environments where the 

instrument is expected to perform. The configuration of the furnace and the placement 

of the instrument in its door are illustrated in Figure 4.20.  

No damage was apparent after the 16 hours of these tests, indicating that the 

instrument has the potential to withstand adverse conditions over long periods of time, 

although further testing is desirable. These steady experiments provide added 

confidence for the crucial component of the work under discussion, namely the analysis 

of the transient response.

Figure 4.20 – Closed furnace for 8 hour runs. 

 

As mentioned earlier the hot experiments are intended to verify the 

instrument’s response to different heat flux levels, under different operating conditions 

defined by various transpiration mass flows. As discussed above these experiments were 

conducted both in steady-state but especially in transient conditions, in order to 

quantify the instrument’s transient response, since this will be the basis of it transient 

mode operation. 

The transient conditions were induced using the pulsed transpiration mass flow 

working principle, meaning that when the airflow is turned on at a supercritical mass 

flux level the instrument will behave like a conventional transpiration radiometer, and 

the temperature measured by the thermocouple attached to the perforated plate would 

be a steady-state equilibrium value dictated by the incoming radiation heat flux and 

the cooling provided by the transpiration airflow, if such conditions were allowed to be 

reached. This also means that although it was not the intent behind its development, 

the instrument under discussion can also be used as a traditional transpiration 

radiometer.  

The situation where the airflow is eliminated and the boundary layer is no 

longer blown off will present a dramatic increase in measured temperature driven not 

only by the presence of a convective component in addition to the radiative component 



192 

 

that was already present, but also by the absence of transpiration cooling in the sensing 

element. 

As discussed earlier such a process would eventually lead to a steady-state value 

that would be reached if temperatures were allowed to increase and stabilize, and 

would indeed be proportional to the total received heat flux, according to the 

relationship shown earlier in Equation 2.1:

where the slope of the transient temperature curve at the start of the pulse (hence the 

zero value for time) would be proportional to the incoming heat flux. 

An adequate analysis of the sensing element’s transient response is precisely 

intended to avoid reaching such high temperatures, allowing the resetting of the 

supercritical transpiration mass flow once the proportionality constant ? is established. 

This would enable the convenient assumption of a comparatively insignificant plate 

emission term and most importantly would avoid severe damage to the components 

and their welding and attachments.  

Furthermore, if the process is carried out in a sufficiently rapid way, the 

radiative component of the heat flux can be treated as constant and the convective 

component can be estimated based on the radiative heat flux measured for a 

supercritical transpiration mass flow. A calibration of the transient transpiration 

radiometer would thus involve the determination of the proportionality constant ? for 

various incident heat fluxes, with temperature curves slopes being quantified in degrees 

per second (ºCs-1 or Ks-1). 

A previous attempt to verify the proposed formulation was developed within 

this research team [Martins 1998, Martins et al. 1998, Martins et al. 2000], including 

experimental studies using a different heat flux instrument, operated at a constant 

blow off mass flow rate, and using a diaphragm between the sensor and the radiation 

source to create the transient. The performed studies showed a direct proportionality 

between the slope of the line tangent to the temperature response curve and the 



193 

 

incident heat flux, the same slope being observed in the linear portion of the curve for 

the same heat fluxes regardless of the initial temperature, establishing the soundness of 

the transient transpiration principle [Hit 2004]. 

The latter reference mentioned the difficulty of identifying the exact moment    

t = 0 mentioned in Equation 2.1, with a precision sufficient to decide the exact starting 

point for slope determination purposes, and suggested higher data acquisition 

frequencies as a remedy. This problem is compounded by the noisy nature of the 

output signal from the thermocouple, since even when the sensing element is 

experiencing heating or cooling, as discussed earlier when its transient behaviour was 

simulated, fluctuations in the temperature curve will manifest themselves and small 

variations from one instant to the next can even be contrary to the overall heating or 

cooling tendency, rendering necessary some form of filtering to account for fluctuations 

in the signal, as discussed below. 

The output of the thermocouple was read using the same data acquisition 

system, connecting its terminals to the external box that contains the signal 

conditioning amplifiers that convert millivolt readings to °C, with the ±0.6ºC 

accuracies for K-type thermocouples. The acquisition and control system was 

programmed to control the electrovalve open and close cycles based on maximum and 

minimum cycle temperatures rather than on a time period. This option was retained in 

order to ensure that a possibly less than judicious period selection does not result in 

excessive temperatures in the sensing element, due to the valve being closed for too 

long. The valve opens when the maximum cycle temperature is reached, letting the 

transpiration airflow eliminate the convection heat transfer and cool the sensing 

element until the lower cycle temperature is reached and the valve closes again. Some 

measured temperature overshoot is always to be expected at both ends of the 

temperature spectrum, due to some delay in the response of the valve and some 

controller drift. 

An acquisition frequency must also be defined, at a value sufficiently high to 

capture the transient temperature variations occurring in the element, so that care 

must be taken to ensure that the frequency is sufficiently high in order not to miss 

possible temperature curve inflexions. This parameter was duly taken into account in 

the experimental study, as discussed below. 



194 

 

The system was also programmed to register the valve position (0 for closed and 

1 for open), writing results as standard csv (comma separated values) files that can be 

open and processed in software such as Excel, Mathematica or Matlab. A real-time 

interface is available and allows a continuous monitoring of the measurements, as 

illustrated in Figure 4.21. The noisy nature of the temperature signals is evident in 

most measurement runs and the interface allows some magnification in terms both of 

time and temperature. Such an interface is always useful, if only for interrupting a 

measurement run if something is visibly wrong with the process. It also allows a 

visualisation of the signal stabilization, since some transient adjustment must always be 

considered at the start of each experiment. 

 

Figure 4.21 – Data acquisition system real-time interface. 

 

Files resulting from the described procedure contain information about the 

instant of measurement, the position of the valve and measured temperatures. When 

plotted the files show the same basic information, as illustrated in Figure 4.22, 

displaying “raw” values, before any data processing procedures are applied. Noise in 

the temperature signal is not usually perceptible unless a certain degree of 

magnification is used (which is not necessarily practical in most situations where an 

entire experimental run is to be visualized for analysis purposes), but is nevertheless 

always present and should be dealt with either by reducing its magnitude or by 

processing the obtained data. Another phenomenon can also be noticed in the lower 

values of the temperature cycles, namely a variation over time. As can be seen by the 



195 

 

time values the graph plots temperatures at the start of the run, where the instrument 

output has not stabilized. Care was therefore taken in the calibration runs, starting 

measurements only after such effects were no longer apparent, which occurred after a 

few minutes. 

 

Figure 4.22 – Raw data plots. 

 

While the data acquisition procedures should be tailored to reduce as much as 

possible the noise levels in the signal, and although the transient data found in the 

work under discussion are not particularly noisy when compared to those found in 

other applications, some form of data filtering is desirable in order to make the trends 

in the data stand out from background noise. Furthermore, when seeking a calibration 

curve for the instrument, these noisy data must be adequately processed for a correct 

calculation of transient temperature curve slopes. 

For the case under discussion, the use of the Savitzky-Golay smoothing 

algorithm for data filtering purposes was decided upon, for a variety of reasons. It is a 

well established and widely used tool that is nowadays available in most scientific 

computation software packages (such as Mathematica or Matlab) and therefore does not 

have to be specifically programmed to be used. Furthermore, Savitzky-Golay smoothing 

is very easy to apply and can be used to calculate inherently smoothed first and second 

derivatives of the signal, which is especially relevant in this context given the stated 

need to calculate the slope of the transient temperature curve.

A FIR is a filter with an impulse response (or response to any finite length 

input) is of finite duration, settling to zero in finite time in contrast to infinite impulse 

response (IIR) filters that may have internal feedback and continue to respond 

indefinitely (although usually decaying). FIR filters are inherently stable and require no 

feedback, meaning that any rounding errors are not compounded by summed iterations 

and the same relative error occurs in each calculation. This also makes implementation 

simpler, but typically comes at a higher computational cost when compared with IIR 

filters. 

The Savitzky–Golay FIR smoothing filter essentially performs a local 

polynomial regression (of degree k) on a series of values (of at least k + 1 points which 

are treated as being equally spaced in the series) to determine the smoothed value for 

each point. The main advantage of this approach is that it tends to preserve features of 

the distribution such as relative maxima, minima and width, which are usually 

'flattened' by other adjacent averaging techniques like moving averages [Savitzky and 

Golay 1964]. 

Given a set of data containing both signal and noise, the objective of the 

Savitzky-Golay method is to replace the raw data by a smoother set of data 

representing the true signal responsible for the recorded intensities. For a constant 

underlying signal, the most natural means of estimating the true signal from a set of 

measurements would be to average the values. Spectral data, such as the periodic 

temperature signals imposed by the transient transpiration operation, typically contain 

peaks superimposed on a background signal and therefore a more subtle use of 

averaging is required if the essential structure in the data set is to be retained.  

The smoothed time series is obtained by replacing each value of the series with 

a new value which is obtained from a polynomial fit to 2n+1 neighbouring points 

(including the point to be smoothed), with n being equal to, or greater than the order 

of the polynomial.  

Illustrated in Figure 4.23 are calculated first derivatives curves for a run with 

the furnace at 1500ºC, where higher slope values occur. 



197 

 

 

Figure 4.23 – Calculated first derivatives. 

 

 An important conclusion was reached in the course of this experimental and 

analytical process, and the graph above is helpful in making the point, since it readily 

indicates that a more easily measureable indication of the instrument’s transient 

response can be the maximum value of the first derivative of the temperature curve, 

rather than its value at instant t = 0 when each airflow pulse begins and ends:

The identification of this instant t = 0 is extremely difficult for the case when 

the airflow is turned off and the temperature curve rises, even at high data acquisition 

frequencies (which were tested up to 500 Hz and could conceivably have been set at 

even higher values since the hardware allowed it) and with adequate filtering. The 

uncertainty associated with the specification of a particular instant for curve slope 

calculation purposes would lead to significant variations in the calculated slope value 

and render the use of this value hazardous for calibration purposes. 

This strategy can also be justified from the point of view of the data acquisition 

systems available in practice, where the available hardware may not enable very high

acquisition frequencies. In the studies presented here, a 250 Hz acquisition frequency 

was used, although in practice frequencies as low as tens of Hz can be encountered in 

acquisition systems deployed in industrial applications. 

Parametric tests were performed at various transpiration mass flows (0.001, 

0.002 and 0.003 kgs-1) and as expected it was found that higher measured slopes are 

encountered at higher mass flows, leading to greater correlation coefficients in the 

linear relationships between heat fluxes and measured slopes. Since greater 

transpiration mass flows values not only increase the sharpness of variations but also 

provide greater protection from incoming particles as mentioned earlier, transpiration 

mass flows should be set as high as possible and the higher tested mass flow value was 

subsequently used in all tests. Furthermore, the calibration procedure was carried out 

using this constant value and the fact that different calibration curves would be 

obtained at other values must be kept in mind. 

Given the results of the 8 hour runs described above where the refrigeration 

airflow was shut down without any detrimental effect, the later was set at only 20% of 

its maximum value. 

Switching the transpiration mass flow on and off will lead to two distinct 

situations, the temperature rising when the airflow is shut down due to the absence of 

refrigeration and the addition of an admittedly small convective component (a “total” 

incident heat flux thus being present) and falling when the airflow is restored, cooling is 

present and convection is eliminated.  

Defining an operational mode where the airflow valve is controlled by setting a 

maximum temperature above which the valve opens and minimum value at which it 

closes, the temperatures measured by the thermocouple will overshoot the maximum 

set temperature due to the inherent delay introduced by the valve-opening process, and 

this overshoot will increase with increasing furnace set point temperatures. The 

restoration of the airflow, which is kept constant between experiments, will likewise 

result in higher cooling curve slopes for higher furnace set points, due to the greater 

difference in temperature between the plate and the airflow. 

In any case a linear relationship between the two aforementioned incident heat 

flux situations and the temperature curve slopes is expected. Given the fact that 



199 

 

several heating and cooling cycles occur every second (with more cycles at higher 

furnace temperatures given the proposed operational mode) due to the sensing 

element’s low thermal inertia, several slope measurements per second can be carried out 

for both heating and cooling and the correspondent incident heat fluxes will be 

determined using the following relationships: 

 

 
total heating

max,heating

d
T

q
t

?=   (4.6) 

 

 
rad cooling

max,cooling

d

?=   (4.7) 

 

Equation 4.4 embodies a proportional relationship between the incoming heat 

flux and the slope of the transient temperature curve at the start of the pulse (hence 

the zero value for time) and where the linear calibration curve has a zero intercept 

value, meaning that no slope is measured for a non-existent incoming heat flux. 

Given the aforementioned difficulty in determining instant t = 0 and the 

proposed use of the maximum slope in each cycle, it should be kept in mind that while 

for higher heat fluxes maximum slope values are expected to be reached very rapidly, 

slower responses are to be expected at lower incident heat flux values where the 

maxima are not reached at quite the same speed, meaning that a bias resulting from 

the experimental conditions can be expected to lead to non-zero intercept values. This 

in turn means that Equations 4.6 and 4.7 must be adapted in order to include non-zero 

intercepts Kheating and Kcooling:

The relationships themselves can be established by determining a large number 

of slopes at each heat flux level and performing a standard statistical analysis of the 

obtained values, especially as far as their mean values and standard deviations are 

concerned, allowing the determination of slope uncertainties at a given confidence 

interval. This is especially relevant regarding the calibration of the instrument, as 

discussed below. 

Plots of mean measured slopes (calculated with 500 samples each) versus 

furnace heat fluxes can be presented for each instrument, as shown in Figures 4.24 to 

4.29, with radiative heat fluxes corresponding to furnace set point temperatures of 1000 

to 1500ºC, with 100ºC increments, as illustrated in Table 4.3 after correction with the 

apparent emissivity described in Equation 4.2.

compared among themselves, but Figures 4.24 to 4.29 show that although the 

instruments’ response is linear, albeit with admittedly perfectible correlation 

coefficients, considerable differences remain between them. This renders an individual 

calibration for each instrument indispensable. The main justification for the verified 

differences may be the artisanal nature of the instrument’s production, namely the 

welding processes that must evolve into an automated procedure if full-scale production 

ever takes place. 

It should be noted that the linear equations displayed in Figures 4.24 to 4.29 are 

not instrument calibration curves since no measurement uncertainties and resulting 

instrument uncertainty ranges are indicated. These will be determined below where the 

instrument calibration procedures are discussed, but the expected linear relationship 

between curve slopes and incident heat fluxes is nevertheless apparent. 

Another interesting and expected effect given the temperature-controlled 

operational mode was observed regarding the magnitudes of the measured heating and 

cooling temperature curve slopes at the various furnace set points: each instrument also 

displays a linear relationship between the heating and cooling temperature curve slopes, 

as illustrated in Figures 4.30 to 4.32.

4.4 Calibration of the Transient Heat Flux Meter 

Calibration curves are experimentally obtained rules, relating the instrument output 

and the quantity to be measured as a function of the instrument operating conditions 

with a defined accuracy. 

For the present application the instrument output is the sensing element 

temperature and time, expressed as temperature curve slopes, during a transient 

condition created by pulsed air jet, while the quantity to be measured is the incident 

heat flux. 

Calibration of heat flux sensors is a complex issue because some heat flux 

sensors respond differently to different modes and conditions of heat flux. As in other 

types of measurement, the major problem with heat flux measurement is the error 

caused by the disruption due to the presence of the sensor itself.  

For sensors based on spatial temperature gradient methods, a larger signal 

implies a larger temperature difference and a larger temperature disruption. For sensors 

based on the transient temperature change, the surface temperature is changing while 

the measurement occurs. The larger the temperature change, the easier the 

determination of the sensor heat flux, but the larger the error from the sensor 

temperature disruption. The error caused by this disruption is fairly easy to estimate 

for conduction but for convection, however, the effect of the surface temperature 

disruption on the developing thermal boundary layer is much more difficult to estimate 

and the effect on the heat flux can be much larger than the percentage change of the 

temperature [Robertson and Ohlemiller 1995]. It is therefore imperative, in convection 

measurements, to keep the thermal disruption of the sensor to a minimum. This is 

somewhat less relevant in the case under discussion since radiation will clearly be 

predominant. 

Calibration of differential heat flux sensors can be achieved by conduction, 

convection or radiation methods, either on their own or in combination. One-

dimensional conduction calibration can be carried out by mounting the sensor in a good 

thermal insulator with known heat addition and removal at each end. Problems with 

this method arise from the need of knowing the thermal conductivity of the different 

materials and also the interfacial contact resistances.  



207 

 

A well-established and therefore common laboratory method is the calibration of 

sensors against a well-defined convection correlation such as for jet impingement 

[Martin 1977]. In this technique a sensor mounted flush with the surface is exposed to a 

fluid jet of known geometry, velocity and temperature; the expected value of the local 

flux is determined from an established correlation for this geometry and for given flow 

conditions. This is then used for the calibration against the electrical signal from the 

sensor.  

A variety of references exist for calibration methodologies and facilities, from 

simple layered gauges [Hager et al. 1994], to round robin studies of the calibration of 

various sensors using different methods [Pitts et al. 2006] or radiative calibration 

procedures of heat flux sensors [Murthy et al. 2000], including the determination of and 

radiative heat flux measurement uncertainty [Bryant et al. 2003]. 

Also widely discussed are fire testing situations where the convective component 

can be significant, rendering necessary proper heat flux partition experimental setups 

[Lennon and Silcock 2006]. Specific heat flux meter calibration procedures for fire 

testing laboratories are also available [Filtz et al. 2002]. 

Alternatively, the sensor can be irradiated to a known intensity by, for example, 

quartz lamps. Thermal radiation sources such as a laser are well suited for the transient 

calibration where a mechanical shutter can be used to modulate the heat flux. A 

comprehensive review of high-temperature radiation reference sources for calibration 

purposes was recently published [Hartmann 2009]. 

As mentioned earlier one of the problems encountered during the present study 

was the cooling of the furnace inner surfaces induced by the cold transpiration airflow 

and the small amount of contamination coming from the lack of airtightness with the 

refrigeration airflow. The problem had already been encountered in earlier transpiration 

radiometers’ development and to the best knowledge of the author there are no 

purpose-developed calibration furnaces that take this problem into account, requiring 

keeping it in mind when analysing results. This only compounds the problem that lies 

in the fact that the furnace cannot be taken as a primary calibration standard, which 

means that an uncertainty in the radiative heat flux at each furnace set point should 



208 

 

also be taken into account, namely by estimating it based on the uncertainties in the 

furnace emissivity and the temperature values, as explained below. 

4.4.1 Calibration Procedure 

As mentioned above, the calibration procedure of the instrument will involve the 

determination of the uncertainties associated with each calibration curve, i.e. the 

relationship between measured slope and the heat flux to be determined. 

Bearing in mind some of the discussion of results above, the calibration process 

can be broadly described as follows: 

1. Mass flow and acquisition frequency are set at constant values; 

2. Maximum and minimum temperatures for the opening and closing of the 

electrovalve controlling the transpiration mass flow are set; 

3. Once initial transient behaviours stabilize, data acquisition is performed;  

4. Transient temperature curves are processed using Savitzky-Golay filtering; 

5. Mean values for the slopes at each heat flux level are calculated, together 

with the respective uncertainty; 

6. The uncertainty in the furnace heat flux is calculated; 

7. Calibration curves, including uncertainties in slope and intercept, are 

obtained through linear regression. 

As discussed above measurements were performed at an arbitrary constant 

transpiration mass flow of 0.003 kgs-1, corresponding to the higher value considered in 

the transient tests when various mass flows were used, since it was found, as expected, 

higher measured slopes and higher correlation coefficients in the linear relationships 

between heat fluxes and measured slopes are encountered at higher mass flow rates. 

Higher transpiration mass flows values also provide more effective protection against 

incoming particles. The data acquisition frequency was likewise set at a constant value 

of 250 Hz, previously proven to be sufficient for the task at hand. 



209 

 

Maximum and minimum temperatures for the opening and closing of the 

electrovalve that controls the transpiration mass flow rate were set at 120 and 90ºC 

respectively for tests carried out at furnace temperatures ranging between 1000 and 

1500ºC, with 100ºC increments. These temperatures where kept the same for all tests 

since they have implications in terms of response times materialized in the number of 

measurement cycles per time unit. Higher heat fluxes lead to sharper temperature 

variations, enabling faster cycles, with average cycle times ranging from 1.7 s at 1000ºC 

to 0,75 s at 1500ºC, using the aforementioned maximum and minimum temperatures. 

This temperature interval was selected for two reasons, the least of which was 

producing clear maximum slope values, which might be more difficult to identify for 

smaller temperature ranges than the specified 30ºC, although smaller temperature 

intervals obviously allow faster heating and cooling cycles. 

The main reason for the specified range was however providing valve opening 

and closing temperature values that would be common to the entire operation range, in 

order to establish the expected linear variation pattern. At high heat flux levels a low 

measured temperature might not be reached even after the transpiration airflow was 

restored, while at lower heat flux levels the higher measured temperatures might not be 

reached given the fact that for temperature control safety reasons the cycle was 

programmed to always start from a situation where the transpiration airflow is on. 

Numerous transient temperature curves slopes were determined for calibration 

purposes, 500 values being used to calculate mean values and standard deviations for 

each furnace set point, after the aforementioned stabilization times. These mean values 

and respective standard deviations, together with the sample size and a specified 

confidence interval (in this case, 95%), allowed the calculation of the uncertainties in 

the heating and cooling slopes. The values used to calculate the slope mean values were 

themselves obtained after the implementation of Savitzky-Golay filtering, as described 

earlier. 

The aforementioned cooling of the furnace by the cold transpiration airflow 

means that the furnace cannot be taken as a primary calibration standard and renders 

the quantification of the uncertainty in the radiative heat flux at each furnace set point 



210 

 

necessary, based on the uncertainties in the furnace emissivity and the temperature 

values. Writing the corrected heat flux as:

its uncertainty due to uncertainties in the temperature and the apparent emissivity can 

be written as:

The uncertainty in the apparent emissivity can be found in Equation 4.2, while 

the uncertainty in temperature was set at 0.75% of each temperature, as per NIST 

reference tables [NIST 1999]. This value is for standard K-type thermocouples, rather 

than the sheathed thermocouple used here, but is nevertheless a reasonable upper 

estimate. 

Obtaining uncertainty values both for the furnace heat fluxes and the 

temperature curve slopes enables the calculation of calibration curves by performing 

linear regressions. Despite its seeming simplicity, the problem of finding the best 

straight line through an experimentally determined set of points on the x-y plane has 

triggered the publication of hundreds of papers in a host of fields since Gauss’ original 

development of the method of least-squares estimation (LSE). Although the traditional 

regression of y on x is widely used and included in most hand calculators and 

spreadsheets, only rarely are the x values actually error-free. In reality, both x and y 

errors may be significant, and may vary from point to point. Furthermore, the errors in 



211 

 

the two coordinates may be highly correlated, although in the present case the 

correlation was assumed to be nonexistent. 

The approaches to fitting straight lines to collections of x-y data pairs can be 

broadly grouped into two categories: the “standard” least-squares methods in which the 

distances between the fitted line and the data in the y-direction are minimized, and the 

“bivariate” least-squares methods in which the perpendicular distances between the 

fitted line and the data are minimized. In all of these methods, weights may be also 

applied to the data to account for the differing uncertainties in the individual points. In 

“standard” least-squares, the weighting pertains to the y-variables only, whereas in 

“bivariate” methods, weights can be assigned for the x- and y-variables independently. 

A variety of references are available listing available linear least-squares data 

fitting methods [Cantrell 2008], one of the most widespread being developed by York, 

first giving the general solutions for the LSE best straight line in terms of its slope and 

y intercept and errors in these two parameters, when both observables (Xi, Yi) are 

subject to errors which vary from point to point [York 1966]. A more general solution 

also allowed for the possible correlation between the x and y errors at each point [York 

1968]. A compact set of equations for the slope, intercept, and standard errors was 

proposed [York et al. 2004] and implemented in an iterative function available at the 

Matlab website [Wiens 2010], used here. 

This methodology enables the calculation of the same type of linear relationship 

between temperature curve slopes and heat fluxes as displayed in Figures 4.24 to 4.29, 

but taking into account the aforementioned x- and y-variables uncertainties.  

Figures 4.33 and 4.34 are examples of the plots resulting from the application of 

the Matlab function, where the calibration curves obtained using standard least-squares 

estimation are compared with the method proposed by York [York et al. 2004]. The 

function represents errors in x (slope) and y (heat flux) as error bars around the mean 

values.

purposes. Differences are slight but undeniable.

It is readily visible that taking into account errors in both temperature curve 

slopes and heat fluxes, as per the York method, increases slopes in all cases, reflecting 

the “weighting” induced by the larger “error clouds” around higher heat flux values, as 

visible for instance in Figure 4.33. Intercept values are “driven” by this increase in 

slope and decrease as expected given the higher slopes. 

The uncertainties in slopes lead to less than 5% variations of its value in all 

cases, reflecting adequate relative accuracy in the absence of reliable calibration 

references. It should be stressed that given the experimental setup the convective 

component of the heat flux is probably always too small to have a significant impact on 

measurements even for the heating situation where the total heat flux is received by 

the sensing element.

True heat flux partitioning potential is demonstrated but can only be really 

achieved once reliable test and calibration facilities are available. Given the 

aforementioned lack of calibration sources that are not affected by the transpiration 

airflow, this means that further work is necessary regarding the facilities themselves, 

besides improvements to the instruments themselves. 

Observed standard deviation were higher in the cooling cases and translate into 

absolute higher error values in this process in comparison with the heating process, 

reflecting the complex interaction encountered when the transpiration airflow meets 

plate and thermocouple. 

As mentioned above it was hoped that a precise dimensional control of the 

geometric features of the various components would result in instruments with very 



215 

 

similar behaviours when compared with each other, which could potentially make 

individual calibration for each instrument indispensable. This is clearly not the case, 

considerable differences existing between instruments as materialized in the differing 

calibration curve parameters, especially slopes and their uncertainties. 

The linearity of the transient responses of all three instruments is nevertheless 

satisfactory, as can be judged by the correlation coefficients shown in Figures 4.24 to 

4.29, and their reasonable accuracy was also established above for the transpiration 

mass flow and range of temperatures used in this particular calibration. The reason for 

that undesirable behaviour, namely in an industrial production framework, was already 

discussed in a previous section. 

Providing a plate central zone with holes placed at a slightly greater distance 

from the thermocouple attachment point should diminish the risk of disruption of the 

perforated pattern while rendering the welding itself easier to execute and more robust, 

without significantly coming to the detriment of the sensor’s thermal inertia. 

The issue of weldings quality and variability is relevant not also from the pure 

thermal point of view but also in terms of overall instrument robustness. While some 

units withstood all tests without any visible changes, including the two 8 hour runs, 

one unit broke during operation (the thermocouple coming loose from the plate but still 

being capable of temperature measurements) while two others broke due to clumsy 

handling, being dropped to the ground and breaking the thermocouple attachment. 

These facts emphasize the need to revise the thermocouple attachment method, 

which is far from being a trivial matter given its small size, and attachment location 

free space, as well as the low plate thickness. These challenging requirements led to 

some unusual options that resulted in functioning prototypes with some handicaps that 

must be addressed in future versions of the instrument.  

From the analytical point of view, the fact that the calibrations above took 

place at a single, arbitrary transpiration mass flow must be remembered. Now that the 

basic principle is established and was shown to be viable, tests at other mass flows 

would enable the establishment of a range of calibration curves for various situations 

potentially more suited to other possible working conditions, bearing in mind that in 



216 

 

terms of transient operation sensitivity higher mass flow rates were shown to lead to 

greater temperature curve slopes. 

4.5 Concluding Remarks 

The present chapter was devoted to the description of the experimental verification and 

calibration of the transient transpiration heat flux meter prototypes. 

Three flux meters were built and tested. A description of the constructed 

prototypes and of the experimental setup was presented along with a discussion of the 

experimental procedure followed in the experimental study of the instrument’s 

performance. 

A reasonable agreement was found between the steady experimental data and 

the numerical model predictions, despite the uncertainty regarding the sensing 

element’s surface emissivity. Measured steady temperatures were the same in all cases 

to a very small difference and the instrument output is linear with heat fluxes. Truly 

long terms tests could not be performed with the available equipment but runs lasting 

several hours at high temperatures indicate a basic soundness of the design and its 

potential for full scale applications, despite some concerns in terms of robustness if 

some changes are not introduced. 

A calibration procedure for the instrument’s transient behaviour was described 

and discussed. Calibrated relationships between measured maximum temperature curve 

slopes and furnace heat fluxes are discussed, namely in terms of the effect of 

uncertainties in their magnitudes on the calibration curves. Conclusions regarding 

operational aspects are also presented.

CHAPTER 5 

GLOBAL CONCLUSIONS AND PROPOSED 

DEVELOPMENTS 

 

A summary of all the work described within this thesis is provided and 

the main conclusions are listed and discussed.  Proposed developments 

to be carried out in the future are also presented. 

 

5.1 Summary 

The present document presents a new embodiment of the transpiration radiometer 

principle, intended to maintain established features of previous instruments of the same 

type while diminishing their dimensions and response time, the purpose of such 

instruments remaining the measurement of the total hemispherical radiation and its 

separation into radiative and convective heat fluxes being proposed.  

The proposed concept is particularly suitable and intended for high 

temperature, harsh environments. The transpiration principle implies the possibility of 

eliminating the convective component of the heat flux, hence the transpiration 

radiometer designation. 

A bibliographic review covering existing techniques heat flux measurements 

made clear that no instrument exists with the particular combination of features 

proposed here. This assumption was embodied in a patent request and supported by 

the fact that the relevant issuing organization (Instituto Nacional de Propriedade 

Industrial – Portuguese National Institute of Industrial Property) approved the 

preliminary report, having found no impediments to patentability, and issued a 

provisional patent application that must be converted into a definitive patent 

application,  pending a decision to carry on by the administration of the University of 

Aveiro, as patent co-proprietor, to be taken until August 1st, 2013 



218 

 

A chapter was devoted to the description of the instrument’s working principle 

and of possible formulations for the study of the sensing element’s behaviour.  

The problem requirements and subsequent simplifications were discussed and 

implemented as necessary. The need to take into account a non-homogeneous transient 

problem was foremost, especially given the presence of the interaction between a 

perforated plate being heated by radiation and a colder transpiration airflow crossing 

the pattern of holes, leading to the analytical treatment of such an interaction as a heat 

sink term. 

The GF method was recognized as being well suited to the task of providing an 

analytical solution and a proper methodology was established in order to implement it 

in order to obtain temperature values for all locations and times of interest. A 

concurrent finite differences approach was also found to be adequate for the same 

purpose, with added benefits in terms of implementation in situations where boundary 

conditions vary in space and time. Other relationships necessary to describe phenomena 

that needed to be integrated into the model were obtained and implemented. 

A comparison of results of both approaches with those of equivalent CFD 

simulations of the same physical problems showed good approximation and 

simultaneously provided both increased confidence in the results provided by the GFSE 

and validation for the simulations to be carried out for dimensioning purposes using 

CFD software. 

The dimensional and operational parameters that influence sensor performance 

were determined and discussed, based both on established analytical principles and on 

the simulation software that was compared to the analytical models discussed in the 

previous chapter. 

Ranges for the relevant mass flow values to be used for the intended range of 

furnace working temperatures were also identified in order to guarantee the 

simplification of the radiative balance between the plate and its surroundings and to 

ensure proper boundary layer control while avoiding compressibility phenomena. The 

instrument’s transient behaviour was also found to be within expectations and the 

proposed external cooling system was likewise found satisfactory in theory. 



219 

 

The procedures developed earlier led to the building of the prototypes and 

provided the framework to evaluate their performance, by comparison with simulated 

values, although necessary adjustments naturally had to be made in order to 

accommodate differences dictated by laboratory conditions. 

Three flux meters were built and tested. A description of the constructed 

prototypes and of the experimental setup was presented along with a discussion of the 

experimental procedure followed in the experimental study of the instrument’s 

performance. 

A reasonable agreement was found between the experimental data and the 

numerical model predictions, Runs lasting several hours at high temperatures indicate a 

basic soundness of the design and its potential for full scale applications. 

A calibration procedure for the instrument’s transient behaviour was described 

and discussed. Calibrated relationships between measured maximum temperature curve 

slopes and furnace heat fluxes were discussed, namely in terms of the effect of 

uncertainties in their magnitudes on the calibration curves. Conclusions regarding 

operational aspects were also presented. 

5.2 Conclusions 

The various tasks summarized above resulted in an operational heat flux meter that 

was shown to have significantly lessened dimensions, geometrical complexity and 

response times when compared with earlier transpiration radiometers. 

 The much-reduced thermal inertia and cooling needs of the sensing element 

developed for the present instrument furthermore enabled a switching off of the 

transpiration mass flow, enabling the possibility of performing heat flux partitioning 

given the small times associated with the transient measurement cycles, meaning that 

sufficiently fast consecutive measurements of total and radiative heat fluxes render the 

estimation of the convection component by difference realistic. This feature was not 

present in earlier instruments because of the refrigeration needs, which made 

transpiration airflows indispensable at all times. Given the experimental setup the 

convective component of the heat flux is probably always too small to have a 

significant impact on measurements, and the heat flux partitioning potential 



220 

 

demonstrated can only be really achieved once reliable test and calibration facilities are 

available.  

The satisfactory linearity and accuracy displayed by the instruments can be 

attributed to the precise control of dimensional parameters in the sensing elements, and 

the option of using such components is considered to be validated. However, it was 

hoped that this precise dimensional control would result in instruments with identical 

behaviours when compared with each other, potentially rendering individual calibration 

for each instrument necessary. This is not the case, considerable differences existing 

between instruments as materialized in the differing calibration curve parameters, 

especially slopes and their respective uncertainties. 

The linearity of the transient responses of all three instruments is nevertheless 

satisfactory as indicated by the correlation coefficients of their regression curves, and 

their reasonable accuracy was also established for the transpiration mass flow and 

range of temperatures used in this particular calibration, the uncertainties in slopes 

leading to less than 5% variations of their values.  

Better control and repeatability in the various welding processes would partially 

overcome verified differences and are essential if full-scale industrial is ever to take 

place, since issues regarding the quality of the weldings were identified. 

The lack of quality of some weldings was first of all visible in the existence of 

the contamination leakage between airflows and must also be present at the junction of 

the thermocouple to the plate, where the microperforated pattern can be more or less 

damaged by the welding process and change the local interaction between the 

transpiration airflow and the plate, as well as the temperature distribution in the plate 

itself, influencing the thermocouple output and potentially causing the observed 

differences, especially during the cooling process when the airflow actually crosses the 

plate and causes a somewhat more erratic observed cooling process behaviour. 

Experience in handling of the prototypes during the testing procedures also 

showed that the sensing elements are sufficiently sturdy to handle some level of 

mishandling without measurable harm and can withstand shocks and impacts greater 

than those to be expected in aggressive high temperature environments with large 



221 

 

amounts of soot and dust particles. More extensive long term tests are however 

necessary in order to conclude if these positive traits are retained over time. 

The microperforated plate was shown to be easy to refrigerate, while initial 

concerns regarding the lack of robustness both of the 0.25 mm thermocouples 

themselves and their welding to the perforated plate were not wholly verified in 

practice, so their use can be recommended for the intended purpose. Truly long terms 

tests could not be performed with the available equipment but runs lasting several 

hours at high temperatures indicate a basic soundness of the design and its potential 

for full scale applications. 

The fact that most of the sensing element refrigeration actually comes from the 

transpiration airflow was corroborated to a large extent by the 8 hour runs described 

above, where the refrigeration airflow was shut down without any detrimental effect. 

This means that the option for a porous holder can be re-examined and compared with 

the possibility of providing a thin-walled holder that could be maintained at acceptable 

temperatures purely by being refrigerated by the transpiration airflow, resulting in a 

much less complex and cheaper system.  

Cost considerations are fundamental for several reasons, both in this prototype 

stage and especially in possible later production versions where this academic discussion 

will need to move into much more practical considerations. Possible reductions in 

system complexity such as those arising from doing without a porous holder can also 

have a significant impact in terms of price and must therefore be investigated, but in 

any case the high unit prices and building/assembly costs encountered in the work 

described here would be brought down by ordering larger batches of components. These 

reduced costs would in turn increase the likelihood of an actual operational deployment 

of the proposed instruments. 

While troublesome, the artisanal and perfectible welding processes used were 

not an obstacle in establishing the potential of the type of proposed instrument but 

rather an identified area of further refinement in future improved versions. 

The fact that the relevant issuing organization (Instituto Nacional de 

Propriedade Industrial – Portuguese National Institute of Industrial Property) issued a 

provisional patent application, having found no impediments to patentability, indicates 



222 

 

the novelty of the work described here and helps putting into perspective an eventual 

commercial interest in optimized and more thoroughly tested instruments of the same 

type, given the potential demonstrated here. 

5.3 Future Developments 

The work started with the present study may proceed in different directions, especially 

since the developed instrument may be improved in various ways. Bearing in mind 

some the conclusions discussed in each chapter and above, the following research topics 

are recommended for future work:  

• Given the aforementioned lack of calibration sources that are not affected by 

the transpiration airflow, further work is necessary regarding the calibration 

heat sources, besides improvements to the instruments themselves; 

• A calibration setup capable of adequately producing measurable convective heat 

fluxes usable for calibration purposes is fundamental in fulfilling the potential 

shown here in terms of heat flux partitioning implementation; 

• Truly long term testing must be carried out in order to prove the soundness of 

the retained design options embodied in the present version of the instrument; 

• Providing a plate central zone with holes placed at a slightly greater distance 

from the thermocouple attachment point should diminish the risk of disruption 

of the perforated pattern while rendering the welding itself easier to execute and 

more robust, without significantly coming to the detriment of the sensor’s 

thermal inertia; 

• The capability to implement all necessary weldings is a reliable fashion will 

have to be developed through a combination of purpose built equipment and 

revised design. This is relevant in terms of building ease and reliability but 

especially so in terms of operational robustness and measurement accuracy; 

• Crystal growth techniques such as laser-heated pedestal growth (LHPG) could 

be used to obtain thermocouple junctions grown directly onto the intended 

emplacement on the microperforated plate [Feigelson 1985, Andreeta and 

Hernandes 2010]. Such techniques are becoming more widespread and the 

machinery necessary to their implementation is steadily decreasing in cost, 



223 

 

rendering it potentially interesting in circumventing thermocouple welding 

issues; 

• The problems encountered in the refrigeration airflow tubing due to the hot gas 

blowback from the furnace also indicate that the present solution must be 

changed, the most obvious solution being to change the inlet from its present 

tangential location to an inlet concentric (i.e. annular) with that of the 

transpiration airflow, in order to let the body of the instrument provide it with 

the same shielding from direct radiation; 

• Standard tubing dimensions and fittings should be used as much as possible, 

lessening some problem encountered in the present version; 

• The sensing element spectral sensitivity can be optimized or even tailored to 

specific wavelengths both by superficial treatments for emissivity adjustment 

and by adjusting microperforated plate parameters such as thickness or hole 

diameter and spacing; 

• The transient transpiration principle implemented here can be extended to more 

complex geometries besides the cylindrical components studied here, especially 

in systems where air cooling is already used, as is the case in the cooling of 

some gas turbine blades. 

All of the aforementioned points would be important both in the validation of the 

work described within this document but especially as contributions to an improved 

commercial version based on the design proposed herein
