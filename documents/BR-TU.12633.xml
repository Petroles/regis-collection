RECONSTRUCTING HOLOCENE EVOLUTION IN THE 
ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE OF CAMPO LAMEIRO

Abstract: The objective of this research was to evaluate the potential of sedimentary deposits to be 
used for the reconstruction of Holocene environmental changes in the Campo Lameiro area (NW 
Spain). We focused on the evolution of landforms as a key factor in the configuration of alluvial 
and colluvial sequences. The geomorphological and sedimentological studies indicate that the 
distribution of landforms is a main factor to understand the formation of colluvial soils. Granitic 
macroforms dominate the present landscape, constituted by alveolar depressions surrounded by 
crests and slabs. The thickest sedimentary deposits were found in the depressions. We identified 
two main stratigraphic units: a basal inorganic layer represented by alluvio -colluvial sediments, 
formed in a highly energetic environment, probably dating to the Younger Dryas (&gt;11000 years BP), 
and a younger unit of thick sandy, blackish, organic matter rich, colluvium. The oldest radiocarbon 
age obtained for this unit indicates that it may have started to form by 11240 -11130 cal. BP. The 
Holocene colluvial soils show discontinuities in grain size, soil reaction, elemental composition of the 
inorganic phase and molecular composition of the soil organic matter. These features are evidence of 
the occurrence of several phases of erosion/sedimentation (i.e. landscape instability), some of which 
were coeval with known periods of Holocene abrupt climate change – the 8.2 ka event, the beginning 
of the Neoglaciation (ca. 6 ka BP) or the 2.8 ka wet/cold event. But some of the most intense phases 
coincided with increased human pressure on landscape during the Neolithic, Bronze Age, Roman 
Period, and the Middle Ages. Charcoal layers, burnt soil layers and the highly aromatic nature of the 
soil organic matter point to frequent fire episodes. Pollen studies also indicated a sharp decrease in 
forest cover beginning by ca. 6000 cal BP, which seems to have been accompanied by a progressive 
soil acidification with time. Our research suggests that both climate and human activities played an 
important role in the formation of colluvial deposits in the area, confirming that they are valuable 
geoarchives of Holocene environmental change from a geoarchaeological approach.

das mudanças ambientais holocénicas, no que diz respeito à evolução do relevo como um fator 
determinante na configuração das sequências aluviais e coluviais. Os estudos geomorfológicos e 
sedimentológicos indicam que a distribuição das geoformas é um fator principal para compreender 
a formação dos solos coluviais. Na paisagem atual da área de estudo dominam as macroformas gra-
níticas, constituídas por depressões alveolares rodeadas por cristas e lajes. Os depósitos sedimentares 
mais espessos ocorrem nas depressões. Identificaram -se duas unidades estratigráficas principais: uma 
camada basal inorgânica, representada por sedimentos aluvio -coluvionares, formados em ambiente 
altamente energético, provavelmente datados do Dryas recente (&gt; 11000 anos BP) e uma unidade mais 
recente, arenosa, escura, rica em matéria orgânica, de solos coluviais. A datação mais antiga, obtida 
por radiocarbono para esta unidade, indica que ela pode ter começado a formar -se há 11240 -11130 
cal. BP. Os solos holocénicos coluviais apresentam descontinuidades na dimensão das partículas, na 
reação do solo, na composição da fase inorgânica e na composição molecular da matéria orgânica do 
solo. Estas características comprovam a ocorrência de diversas fases de erosão  /  sedimentação (ou 
seja, de instabilidade da paisagem), algumas das quais são contemporâneas dos períodos de mudança 
climática abrupta conhecidos no Holocénico – o evento a 8,2 ka, no início da Neoglaciação (ca. 6 
ka BP) ou o evento húmido  e  frio a 2,8 ka. Mas, algumas das fases mais intensas coincidiram com 
o aumento da pressão humana sobre a paisagem durante o Neolítico, a Idade do Bronze, o Período 
Romano e na Idade Média. A ocorrência de camadas de carvão, de solos queimados e a natureza 
distintamente aromática da matéria orgânica do solo apontam para episódios de incêndios frequentes. 
Os estudos polínicos também indicaram uma diminuição acentuada da cobertura florestal, com início 
a ca. 6500 cal BP, que parece ter sido acompanhada por uma progressiva acidificação do solo ao longo 
do tempo. O trabalho de investigação realizado, sugere que as mudanças climáticas e as atividades 
humanas desempenharam ambos um papel importante na formação dos depósitos coluviais na área. 
De acordo com estudos anteriores, isto indica que os referidos depósitos são geoarquivos valiosos 
para reconstruir as mudanças ambientais holocénicas, a partir de uma abordagem geoarqueológica.

1. INTRODUCTION

Geoarchaeology applies techniques and methods of the Human Sciences and 
Geosciences to reconstruct landscape evolution at different geographical scales. 
Huckleberry (2000), slightly modifying the perspective offered by Gifford &amp;amp; Rapp 
(1985), defines geoarchaeology  -as “the application of Earth Science method and 
theory to understanding the human past”, a definition broad enough to include experts 
from a range of scientific backgrounds to contribute towards the comprehension of 
human prehistory. The recent application of Earth Science techniques for the analysis 
of soils and sediments at archaeological sites has generated new levels of understanding 
of human activities and use of the landscape. Soils and sediments are composed of 
similar components, and form a continuum over the landscape. Their study can reveal 
how humans in prehistory used it and defined space through their activities. However, 
the techniques do not fully address several persistent problems associated with 
making inferences about past human activity from soils. The presence or absence of 
elements alone may be inadequate to effectively understand the relationship between 
soil properties and pedogenic, diagenetic and/or anthropogenic processes. As a 
result, multi -method approaches are becoming standard practice in pedoarchaeology 
(Walkington 2010).

Reconstructing holocene evolution in the archaeological site of Campo Lameiro (NW Spain):  
an interdisciplinary approach to geoarchaeology

Soil is an archive that can be used to interpreted archaeological deposits (Mandel &amp;amp; 
Bettis 2001). Soil processes can contribute to an understanding of archaeological sites 
because the soil can act as an archive in a variety of ways (Walkington 2010): (a) soils 
represent process -response systems through the unique interaction of the soil forming 
factors at a particular site; (b) soils reflect soil processes occurring both vertically 
and laterally; (c) soils can store palaeoecological indicators such as pollen, phytoliths, 
bones, etc, and are thus archives of environmental change (Lowe &amp;amp; Walker 2006); (d) 
soils are geoarchives, even when transport has occurred, the resulting colluvial soils 
can still store environmental information (Leopold &amp;amp; Völkel 2007); and (e) soils can 
record human use and management of a landscape.

A pedogeomorphological approach at a landscape scale (Gerrad 1992) linked 
to multiproxy indicators for dating and climate reconstruction can help to track 
past processes in detail. Surface formations contain information inherent in their 
geomorphological evolution. Climate and human activities played an important role in 
the formation of the alluvial - colluvial deposits. The geomorphological data together 
with other palaeoenvironmental proxies define them as useful geoarchives for the 
reconstruction of Holocene environmental change (Costa -Casais et al. 2008). Colluvial 
soils, given their wide distribution and the time expand covered by them, may also 
be crucial to decipher and understand human responses to climate change and the 
impact of anthropogenic activities on the environment at the local and regional scales 
(Leopold &amp;amp; Völkel 2007).

This work is part of an interdisciplinary study made in the area of the Rock Art Park 
of Campo Lameiro (Galicia, NW Spain). In this survey the Earth Science´s disciplines 
played a major role in complementing the archaeological research. Our paper focuses 
on the evolution of landforms – rocky substrate, sediments and soils – as a key 
factor for geoarchaeological analysis, with the objective to evaluate the potential of 
sedimentary deposits to be used for the reconstruction of Holocene environmental 
changes. This approach is particularly important in the studied area because of the 
scarcity of available archaeological remains. Granite landforms, soils and sediments 
are unique archives that have recorded transformations in the landscape linked to 
cultural evolution (Costa -Casais et al. 2009).

2. REGIONAL SETTING 

The study area is located within Rock Art Park of Campo Lameiro (Pontevedra-
-Galicia, NW Spain), on the upper part of the Monte Paradela hill (330 m a.s.l.) and 25 
km E of the Atlantic Ocean, in the Eurosiberian (Atlantic) phytogeographic region (Fig. 
1). The area appears as an almost isolated hill, at the centre of the watershed, defined 
by the river network, and surrounded by fractures running from N -S and E -W as well 
as by numerous joints that break the substrate running N -S, EW, NW -SE and NE -SW. 
The lithology is homogenous throughout the park. It is comprised of two mica granitic 
rocks with megacrystals of K -feldspars, with minerals showing a certain degree of

orientation towards the north of the area (IGME,1982a, 1982b). The general rolling 
topography, with tops and troughs, is the result of a combination of granitic macro 
and microforms. Granitic modelling dominates the slopes, with granitic outcrops 
separated by small thalwegs.

It is an area of transition between the coast and mountain range, with temperate humid 
climate. Present mean annual temperature is 14.5 °C, and mean annual precipitation is 
1500 mm (Martínez Cortizas &amp;amp; Pérez Alberti 1999). Current vegetation of the site is a 
mosaic of pine (Pinus pinaster), pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), heather (Calluna 
vulgaris), Erica spp. and herbaceous species. Along the valleys, the riverside vegetation is 
mainly composed of common alder (Alnus glutinosa), hazel (Corylus avellana), Quercus 
robur and birch (Betula alba). Cultivated land is located within a distance of 300 m, at 
lower elevations. 

3. MATERIAL AND METHODS 

Geoarchaeology applies techniques and methods of the Human Sciences and 
Geosciences to reconstruct landscape evolution at different geographical scales. 
These include several disciplines of the Earth Science, related to the study of the

fossil – plant and animal – record and those dedicated to the study of the material 
remains of cultures. The study on past environmental changes in the Rock Art 
Park of Campo Lameiro has been carried out using the colluvial formations to 
reconstruct changes in the landscape. The disciplines involved in the study were: 
(a) disciplines of Earth Sciences: geomorphology, sedimentology, pedology, 
geochemistry, mineralogy, as well as computer techniques applied to geographic 
studies and geographic information systems; (b) disciplines that are responsible for 
studying the fossil or subfossil record: palynology and anthracology; (c) disciplines 
that deal with the study of material culture remains: archaeology and prehistory. 
The archives showed information about past soil erosion and landscape change. 
The signals are geomorphological features, morphological soil features, physico-
-chemical properties, changes in elemental and mineral composition, information

on past vegetation, etc. Methodological point of view, the study was divided into 
four phases, following the guidelines suggested by Martínez Cortizas (2000) (Fig. 2). 

The first phase implied an inventory of all available information about the area 
(maps, climatic data, geology, hydrography, previous studies, etc.), which aided to 
the current understanding of the peculiarities of the landscape under study. This 
phase was the basis for setting the strategies to follow in the planning the work. 

In a second phase, fieldwork was carried out in order to differentiate landforms. 
The work started with the interpretation of aerial photographs, to define relief units

terrain model to conform a GIS database. Modified from Costa -Casais et al. (2009).

and how they are related to the regional geomorphologic context. This information 
was used for designing and subsequent opening of 43 ditches in ten sectors, 
with a total length of 2.5 km. Two main criteria were followed: (a) the variety of 
morphological units, their location in sectors prone to sediment/soil accumulation, 
in erosive/accumulative or erosive areas, and (b) their proximity to the rock carvings. 
Systematic descriptions of the sedimentary facies were made in order to define the 
vertical and lateral stratigraphic changes. More detailed descriptions were performed 
for a small number of sedimentary sequences in each ditch, which generally coincided 
with the deepest ones and showing the greatest diversity of facies. The location of the 
trenches, the sedimentary sequences and the rock art panels were incorporated into 
a digital terrain model, then combined with the information obtained from the other 
disciplines involved – geomorphology, archaeology and pedology – to conform a GIS 
database (Costa -Casais et al. 2009) (Fig. 3). 

In the third phase, eleven pedo -sedimentary sequences (with depths between 1.5 
and 3 m) were selected for high -resolution sampling of soils and sediments. Of these, 
five were studied in more detail. Sampling was systematic and took into account the 
variability of each sediment layer or soil cycle. 

The fourth phase concerned the analytical procedures. These included abiotic 
(physico -chemical properties: soil reaction, elemental composition of the inorganic 
phase, mineralogy, etc.) and biotic (pollen record, charcoal, molecular composition of 
the organic matter, etc.) proxies. In a relatively small area several colluvial formations 
were analysed and supported by extensive radiocarbon dating. 

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

4.1. Geomorphological context: granite landscape

The landscape of the study area is dominated by granite outcrops separated by 
small thalwegs. The tops are organized following a polygonal pattern resulting from 
long -term granite weathering that is controlled by a joint system running from N -S and 
E -W directions. This tectonic pattern defines an alignment with a series of tops and 
granitic slabs interspersed with small low -lying areas known as alveolar depressions or 
alveoli (Fig. 4). The lithological, structural and geomorphological variety corresponds 
to that of granitic landforms, classified into two groups, depending on their size. The 
megaforms or large -scale forms are divided into convex – castle -kopje, tor, block – 
located in a high topographic position, and concave forms – alveoli or weathering 
basins – at lower topographic positions. The microforms or smaller forms, consist of: 
(a) microforms without any evident relationship to the rock structure – linear forms 
(gutters) and pointed forms (gnammas, tafone); and (b) microforms with an evident 
relationship with the rock structure – linear forms (polygonal cracking, nerviate 
forms), and flat forms (broken blocks) (Godard 1977; Twidale 1986, 1989). At an 
intermediate topographic position are the granitic slabs, minor forms that are related 



5 8

Maria Isabel Caetano Alves &amp;amp; Felipe Criado -Boado

to the structure of the rock (mainly joints), flat in shape and slightly tilted down. 
Granitic macroforms dominate the landscape, constituted by alveolar depressions 
surrounded by crests and granitic slabs. The rock art panels of Os Carballos and Os 
Cogoludos are good examples, carved on slabs, in which the joints, narrow channels 
and other linear features are observed (Costa -Casais et al. 2009).

Granite morphogenesis is the result of the interaction of a number of factors: rock 
type, tectonics, climatic changes, human activities and the associated morphogenetic 
systems, which acted either directly or indirectly on the granitic substrate to form 

Fig. 4. The tops are organized following a polygonal pattern resulting from long -term granite wea-
thering that was controlled by a joint system running from N -S and E -W directions. Modified from

the present landforms seen in Campo Lameiro. Alveolar depressions are the most 
representative major landforms. Their formation, as already mentioned, has been 
controlled by the joint system that channelled both the upwards and downwards 
alteration processes (hydrothermal/thermal), and the downwards weathering and 
pedogenetical processes (Vidal Romaní 1989). Their final shape is also linked to fluvial 
and alluvial processes that gradually uncovered the megaforms. These alveoli are 
covered by alluvial -colluvial deposits and colluvial soils. They played a decisive role in 
the preservation of sedimentary sequences in Campo Lameiro.

4.2. Sedimentary sequences: alluvial deposits and colluvial soils

The thickest sedimentary deposits are located in the alveolar depressions, where 
sedimentation was favoured over erosion. The alveoli shape types have conditioned the 
evolution of the surface formation. Depending on where they are located, superficial 
formations can be classified into four main groups: (a) erosive ?cumulative alveoli: 
situated in high potential energy areas prone to both erosion and sedimentation in 
comparable intensities; (b) coalescing alveoli: located in low energy areas where 
accumulation dominated, such as the channelled depressions; (c) asymmetric alveoli: 
formations that cover alveoli found at intermediate positions, located next to the base 
of a granite slab and with their external border eroded; and (d) type alveoli: covered 
alveoli floors (Costa -Casais et al. 2008) (Fig. 5). The sedimentary sequences show two 
types of stratigraphic units: a basal inorganic sedimentary layer, covering the granitic 
substrate or the deeply weathered saprolite, with varying thickness (50 to 100 cm) and 
a younger, thicker (up to 250 cm) layer represented by colluvial, polycyclic soils, rich 
in organic matter. 

The basal inorganic sedimentary unit is the result of the erosion and transport of 
the strongly weathered saprolite mantle, generating a large amount of material. The 
mineralogical composition, shape of the clasts, degree of weathering and the type of 
fine matrix refers to a morphogenetic system controlled by water. The sedimentary 
facies are quite varied. There are heterogeneous and chaotic layers: cross -bed, linear 
structures and lenticular sand layers, related to alluvial transport, which are only 
preserved in alveoli bottoms (Costa -Casais et al. 2009) (Fig. 6). They were formed 
under an alluvial morphogenetic system, probably as small alluvial fans, with three 
main channels following the natural thalwegs in the area (Fig. 7). Fans are dynamic 
systems that can temporarily store sediments (Gómez Villar 1996) as a result of a 
sporadic yet continuous supply, in geological terms, in a highly energetic environment. 
Alluvial fans depend equally on torrential rainfall and its ability to produce large 
amounts of sediment. At PRD -I (Fig. 6) this basal unit is fossilized by a palaeosol 
that provided a radiocarbon age of 8480 -8320 cal BP (Costa -Casais et al. 2009) and 
in PRD -IV (Fig. 6) it is covered by a soil cycle dating back to ca. 11260 -10905 cal BP 
(Kaal et al. 2011), indicating that the fans are at least late Pleistocene or early Holocene 
in age. Their formation in the study area may be associated with the Younger Dryas

(11000 -10000 BP), a severe coold spell with rainy conditions, as represented in 
sedimentary levels by important alluvial -colluvial accumulations that are well defined 
in the northwestern Iberian Peninsula (Martínez Cortizas &amp;amp; Moares Domínguez 1995; 
Valcárcel Díaz 1998). This is consistent with recent research on fluvial activity in Spain 
that suggests increased activity by 11170 -10230 BP and 9630 -8785 BP (Thorndycraft 
&amp;amp; Benito 2006).

Reconstructing holocene evolution in the archaeological site of Campo Lameiro (NW Spain):  
an interdisciplinary approach to geoarchaeology

The younger unit is represented by colluvial layers that show an apparently 
homogeneous morphology: black to dark brown A horizons (mineral soil rich 
in organic matter), loamy sand to sandy loam texture, with abundant quartz and 
muscovite, acidic and with high C/N ratios. Nonetheless these soils exhibit significant 
vertical changes in grain size, charcoal layers, burnt soil layers, pH, elemental 
composition of inorganic phase (Ti, Zr, Fe, Al). Also, the highly aromatic nature of 
the soil organic matter, originating from pyrogenic material formed during palaeofires 
points towards recurrent fire episodes (Kaal et al. 2008). Sedimentary and geochemical 
features, supported by extensive radiocarbon dating, are evidence of the occurrence 
of several phases of erosion/sedimentation (i.e. landscape instability), some of which 
were coeval with known periods of Holocene abrupt climate change – the 8.2 ka 
event, the beginning of the Neoglaciation (ca. 5500 ka BP) and the 2.8 ka wet/cold 
event (Costa -Casais et al. 2009). But some of the most intense phases coincided with 
increased human pressure on the landscape during the Neolithic, Bronze Age, Roman 
Period, and the Middle Ages.

4.3. Landscape change vs induced environmental changes 

Colluvial soil dynamics
Martínez Cortizas et al. (2009a, 2012) analyzed changes in soil accumulation/

erosion rates in the Rock Art Park of Campo Lameiro – in a relatively small area (less 
than 1 km2) – using several colluvial formations and based on high -resolution sampling 
of soils and sediments and extensive radiocarbon dating. The record of average soil 
accumulation rates revealed sixteen erosion/accumulation periods, eight of them

with an equivalent accumulation rate greater than 10 tm ha -1 a1 (Fig. 8). The estimated 
duration of these phases was between 410 and 130 years, except the oldest one, which 
may have lasted for 500 years. The length of these phases seems to have decreased 
substantially in two steps: one around 6500 cal BP and other one around 2700 cal 
BP. The average duration prior to 6500 cal BP was 600 years, between 6500 and 2700 
cal BP was 310 years and after 2700 cal BP it was 160 years (Fig. 8). As a result of 
increased erosion the transport of soil and sediments caused a progressive accretion 
and infilling of the alveolar depressions. It was possibly at this time, around 6000 cal 
BP (the Neolithic), when the granite outcrops started to become exhumed together 
with the upper part of the slabs. Studies on landscape evolution in NW Spain indicate

that soil erosion began to be a widespread phenomenon at least from 6000 -5500 cal 
BP. Most of these phases were also detected by synchronous erosion episodes in other 
areas of NW Spain (Benito et al. 1991; Martínez Cortizas &amp;amp; Moares Domínguez 1995; 
Martínez Cortizas et al. 1999, 2000). 

The role of climate changes in the formation of colluvial soils was also addressed by 
Leopold and Völkel (2007), particularly related with extreme rainfall events. In Campo 
Lameiro some of the erosion phases correlate with wet periods during the last 6000 years, 
but there is not a direct relationship between the change in rainfall and the intensity of 
erosion. The erosive effect of rainfall may overlap with human -induced transformations. 
The oldest erosion phases coincided with abrupt climate changes (Younger Dryas – 
&gt;10000 cal BP or the 9000 -8000 cal BP period, including the 8.2 ka event; Mayewski 
et al. 2004). These events occurred in periods of weak environmental repercussions of 
human activities. Other phases (Neoglaciation 5500 -5000 cal BP, the 4200 -3800 or 2750-
-2450 cal BP event; Magny et al. 2006; van Geel et al. 2000; Lal et al. 2007), characterized 
by wetter and cooler conditions, occurred in periods of higher human impact, which 
probably led to higher landscape sensitivity. The results suggest that since 6800 -6500 cal 
BP, human activities seem to have been coupled to climate changes and in that period 
became a relevant force that accelerated landscape evolution. The same chronology has 
been found in other areas of NW Spain (Martínez Cortizas et al. 2009b). 

Forest dynamics and fire use
The anthracological study of the macroscopic charcoal (&gt;2 mm, obtained by wet 

sieving) in five colluvial soils from the Campo Lameiro area linked the fire history 
to vegetation change and slope processes (Fig. 8) (Kaal et al. 2011). Fires often cause 
accelerated soil erosion through elimination of the protective vegetation cover and 
litter. The direct result is the exposure of the mineral soil to wind and water erosion. 
Soils located in the upper part of the slopes (i.e. geomorphologically active areas) can 
be completely eroded. The black colour of the resulting colluvial soils seems to be, 
at least partially, associated with the abundance of vegetation fire residues (“black 
carbon”) not only as macroscopic charcoal fragments but also as fine -grained material 
incorporated into the soils’ microgranular fabric (Kaal &amp;amp; Van Mourik 2008). The 
formation of black -coloured soils rich in organic matter is often the consequence of 
pyrogenic material accumulation from long -term fire regimes: chernozemic soils of 
the lower Rhine basin (Gerlach et al. 2006), Australia (Skjemstad et al. 1996), and 
Terra Preta soils in South America (Glaser &amp;amp; Amelung 2003). 

The early phases of the Holocene in Campo Lameiro (10000 -7000 BP) were 
characterized by the expansion of forest vegetation, dominated by deciduous Quercus 
(Martínez Cortizas et al. 2009b; Kaal et al. 2011) which remained dominant up until 
ca. 6000 cal BP, when it started to be gradually replaced by shrub communities. Pollen 
studies have found a sharp decrease in forest cover beginning by ca. 6500 cal BP. The 
effect of fire on the forest in this area is clear since ca. 6000 cal BP, and the charcoal 
record shows a decline in the contribution of oak and an increase in shrub species

(Erica sp.) that seems to be a good indicator of fire -induced environmental degradation 
(Fig. 8) (Kaal et al. 2011). The episodes of accelerated deforestation (ca. 5500 -5000 cal 
BP and ca. 2000 -1500 cal BP) coincided with periods of increased human pressure and 
cultural changes reflected in many areas of Europe (6000 BP Neolithic expansion of 
agriculture and pastoralism, 3000 BP Bronze Age/Iron Age transition and the 1700-
-1500 BP Roman/Germanic shift; Tinner et al. 1999; Mighall et al. 2006) and climate 
deterioration (especially the Neolithic that coincides with the Neoglaciation; Martínez 
Cortizas et al. 2009b).

Charcoal layers identified in colluvial soils are often covered by high accumulation 
rates which confirm that fire was an important agent in the geomorphological 
evolution of Campo Lameiro landscape. Pedo -anthracological analyses by Kaal et 
al. (2011) showed that: i) the deforestation initiated on the upper part of the Monte 
Paradela hill and probably had a local character; ii) the low degree of chronological 
precision, which is inherent in fire history reconstructions from colluvial soils, made 
it impossible to distinguish climatic from human -induced fires, but the abundance of 
synanthropic pollen indicators (e.g. Plantago lanceolata and Urtica dioica) since at 
least ca. 6000 cal BP strongly suggests that humans used fire to generate and maintain 
pasture; and iii) in NW Spain, macroscopic charcoal records in colluvial soils seem to 
provide an excellent proxy for local fire -induced vegetation change.

These colluvial soils, traditionally referred to as Atlantic Rankers (Carballas et al. 
1967), should therefore be added to the list of black -coloured soils probably formed 
upon frequent anthropogenic fire starting in the Neolithic period (Martínez Cortizas 
et al. 2009a)

Soil acidification
Another possible effect of human activities since prehistoric times was soil 

acidification. The results of the study of the Campo Lameiro colluvial soils reflected 
that pH started to decrease ca. 6000 -5000 cal. BP (Fig. 8), an acidification trend that 
would continue for several Millennia. It is only in the last 1000 years that pH seems to 
have stabilized at its lowest values (Martínez Cortizas et al. 2009a). 

The beginning of acidification was synchronous with one of the most critical phases 
of forest decline, an increase in shrubs in the charcoal record, and an abrupt increase 
in total charcoal content in the colluvial soils. In soil layers generated during periods of 
high accumulation rates, pH values tend to be slightly higher than in layers formed in 
periods of low accumulation rate. The substitution of the forest by a more acidophilous 
vegetation, the disruption of the biocycling of nutrients and increased leaching may 
have been the processes leading this forced acidification of soils (Martínez Cortizas et 
al. 2009a, 2012).

A decline in forest cover and the first appearance of cereal pollen indicated 
by palynological studies (Ramil 1993; Martínez Cortizas et al. 2005), the erosive 
discontinuities, stone and charcoal lines in colluvial soils, as well as the start of a 
progressive soil acidification point to human activities as the main trigger. By 3000

BP, a critical threshold must have been crossed in NW Spain because many indicators 
show an acceleration of environmental degradation (Costa -Casais et al. 1996, 2009). 

5. CONCLUDING REMARKS

Our research suggests that both climate and human activities played an important 
role in the formation of colluvial deposits of the study area. The geomorphological 
and sedimentological analyses indicate that the distribution of present landforms is a 
primordial factor to understand the formation of the colluvial deposits. In agreement 
with previous studies, this indicates that they are valuable geoarchives to reconstruct 
Holocene environmental change from a geoarchaeological approach. Given their 
wide distribution and the time expand covered by them, they may also be crucial 
to decipher and understand human responses to climate change and the impact of 
anthropogenic activities on the environment at the local and regional scales. The lack 
of archaeological remains for the studied area makes colluvial deposits an important 
archive that allows to trace the chronology of human activity. In this sense, we can 
briefly summarize palaeoenvironmental information provided by these archives as 
follows:

Climatic changes dominated the environmental evolution until ca. 7000 years ago. 
After this date human modifications became an important driving force.

Increasing landscape instability phases since the mid -Holocene. Some of which 
were coeval with known periods of Holocene abrupt climate change – the 8.2 ka event, 
the beginning of the Neoglaciaton (ca. 5500 ka BP) or the 2.8 ka wet/cold events. But 
some of the most intense phases are coincident with increased human pressure on 
landscape during Neolithic, Bronze Age, Roman Period and Middle Ages. 

Features such as charcoal layers, burnt soil layers and the highly aromatic nature of 
the soil organic matter point to frequent fire episodes; pollen studies indicate a sharp 
decrease in forest cover beginning by ca. 6500 cal. BP, that was accompanied by a 
progressive soil acidification.

Therefore, the geomorphological evolution is controlled by climatic and 
anthropogenic causes. The anthropogenic processes manifested as an acceleration of 
an existing pedogeomorphological process. Direct effects of the geomorphological 
change in the landscape are: slope processes (erosion/sedimentation, i.e. landscape 
instability), fire use accelerated soil erosion, modification of the vegetation cover and 
redistribution of soil resources and preferential concentration of soil in the alveoli 
megaforms.
