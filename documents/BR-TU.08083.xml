SUMMARY

Establishment of the water layer in an irrigated rice crop leads to consumption

of free oxygen in the soil which enters in a chemical reduction process mediated

by anaerobic microorganisms, changing the crop environment. To maintain optimal

growth in an environment without O2, rice plants develop pore spaces (aerenchyma)

that allow O2 transport from air to the roots. Carrying capacity is determined by

the rice genome and it may vary among cultivars. Plants that have higher capacity

for formation of aerenchyma should theoretically carry more O2 to the roots.

However, part of the O2 that reaches the roots is lost due to permeability of the

roots and the O2 gradient created between the soil and roots. The O2 that is lost to

the outside medium can react with chemically reduced elements present in the

soil; one of them is iron, which reacts with oxygen and forms an iron plaque on the

outer root surface. Therefore, evaluation of the iron plaque and of the formation of

pore spaces on the root can serve as a parameter to differentiate rice cultivars in

regard to the volume of O2 transported via aerenchyma. An experiment was thus

carried out in a greenhouse with the aim of comparing aerenchyma and iron plaque

formation in 13 rice cultivars grown in flooded soils to their formation under

growing conditions similar to a normal field, without free oxygen. The results

indicated significant differences in the volume of pore spaces in the roots among

cultivars and along the root segment in each cultivar, indicating that under flooded

conditions the genetic potential of the plant is crucial in induction of cell death

and formation of aerenchyma in response to lack of O2. In addition, the amount of

Fe accumulated on the root surface was different among genotypes and along the

aerenchyma formation, oxygen release by the roots and iron plaque formation,

and that there is a direct relationship between porosity and the amount of iron

oxidized on the root surface.

RESUMO: OXIDAÇÃO DO FERRO NA SUPERFÍCIE DE RAÍZES ADVENTÍCIAS
E SUA RELAÇÃO COM A FORMAÇÃO DE AERÊNQUIMA EM
GENÓTIPOS DE ARROZ

Com o estabelecimento da lâmina de água em lavouras de arroz irrigado, o O2 livre é
consumido e o solo entra num processo de redução química mediado por microrganismos
anaeróbios, alterando o ambiente onde a cultura se desenvolve. Para manter o crescimento sem
O2, o arroz desenvolve o aerênquima, que permite o transporte de O2 do ar até as raízes. A
capacidade de formar aerênquima é genética e pode variar entre cultivares; portanto, plantas
com maior capacidade de formar aerênquima, teoricamente, transportam mais O2 para as
raízes. Entretanto, parte do O2 que chega até as raízes é perdido para o meio externo, que reage
com elementos quimicamente reduzidos no solo, entre eles o Fe2+, que se oxida e forma a
chamada placa férrica na superfície da raiz. Assim, a determinação da placa férrica e da
formação de espaços porosos na raiz pode servir como parâmetro para diferenciar cultivares
de arroz quanto ao volume de O2 transportado via aerênquima. Dessa forma, foi conduzido
um experimento em casa de vegetação, visando comparar a formação de aerênquima e da
placa férrica em 13 cultivares de arroz em solo alagado, com condições semelhantes às normais
de cultivo no campo, sem a presença de O2. Os resultados indicaram diferenças marcantes nos
volumes de espaços porosos nas raízes, entre os cultivares e ao longo do segmento da raiz em
cada cultivar, indicando que, nas condições de solo alagado, o potencial genético da planta é
determinante na indução à morte celular e na formação de aerênquima, em resposta à falta de
O2. Também, a quantidade de Fe acumulada na superfície das raízes foi diferente entre os
genótipos e ao longo da raiz. Assim, concluiu-se que os genótipos de arroz apresentam resposta
diferenciada quanto à formação de aerênquima, liberação de O2 pelas raízes e formação da
placa férrica e que existe relação direta entre porosidade e quantidade de Fe oxidado na
superfície das raizes.

INTRODUCTION

In wetland rice fields, establishment of the water
layer modifies chemical and biological conditions,
leading to consumption of free O2 and the formation
of toxic products such as organic acids and high
concentrations of chemically reduced iron (Fe2+) and
manganese (Mn2+) (Kirk, 2004). Such changes require
plants to develop mechanisms that allow them to carry
O2 to the roots to maintain breathing and normal
growth (Jackson &amp;amp; Armstrong, 1999).

The most important adaptation is the formation
of pore spaces within the root and shoot tissues, called
aerenchyma (Jackson &amp;amp; Armstrong, 1999; Evans,
2003; Kirk, 2004). Aerenchyma formation occurs in
two ways. In the first, called constitutive or
schizogenous, pore space results from separation and
expansion of cells, creating intercellular spaces that
are part of normal development of plants even at
appropriate levels of O2 (Jeffree et al., 1986). The
second type of aerenchyma, called lysigenous, is formed
by the death of cells in the stem and roots through a
biochemical process triggered by waterlogged soil

conditions, especially the lack of O2 (Jackson &amp;amp;
Armstrong, 1999; Evans, 2003). The formation of
lysigenous aerenchyma starts in the roots, mainly in
adventitious roots, and extends to the base and the
shoot (Thomson et al., 1990). This type of formation
results in empty spaces in the cortex of the stem and
roots, forming a continuum between the atmosphere-
shoots-roots (Evans, 2003; Kirk, 2004) and this makes
the largest contribution to the O2 supply to rice roots
and can represent more than 30 % of total tissue
volume (Luxmoore et al., 1970). Differences in the
volume of pore spaces occur in different types of roots
and even along the same root. For example, Armstrong
(1971) observed aerenchyma volumes of 9 % at the
root tip and 45 % in mature regions near the base of
the rice plant.

The effectiveness of internal transport of O2 by
diffusion or convection depends on the physical
resistance caused by the tortuosity of the pores, on
the distance traveled (Kirk, 2004), on the demand for
O2 as a function of root tissue respiration rates, on
soil loss and on microorganism consumption (Kludze
et al., 1993; Hosono &amp;amp; Nouchi. 1997; Kirk, 2004).



IRON OXIDATION ON THE SURFACE OF ADVENTITIOUS ROOTS AND ITS RELATION TO...          187

R. Bras. Ci. Solo, 38:185-192, 2014

These factors are determined by plant genetic
potential, suggesting differences between species, and
even among rice cultivars (Aulakh et al., 2000). In
this case, plants with high genetic capacity for
forming pore spaces can theoretically carry more
oxygen to the roots, favoring their growth and,
consequently, greater depth in the soil, which may be
desirable due to a larger volume of soil exploited in
the search for nutrients (Ponnamperuma, 1972).
However, the O2 transported to the roots is partially
lost to the soil, mainly because of the O2 gradient
created between the reduced soil and the inside of the
root. The intensity at which these losses occur is
determined by root characteristics such as type, age,
cell wall thickening, area and volume of pore spaces
(Colmer, 2003). The amount of oxygen transported
and released by rice roots can vary among cultivars
due to variation in the volume of aerenchyma (Bedford
et al., 1991), suggesting differences in the ability of
forming a hypoxic or aerobic environment in the
rhizosphere. This variation can influence the activity
of aerobic microorganisms and the intensity of
chemical and biological reactions in the rhizosphere
(Colmer, 2003).

Oxygen release in the rhizosphere also enables
oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ in the form of amorphous
iron oxyhydroxides and thereby results in its
accumulation on the root surface and cells that form
the epidermal layers (Tanaka &amp;amp; Navasero, 1966),
commonly called “iron plaque” (Chen et al., 1980).
However, oxidation of Fe corresponds to only part of
the oxygen released by the roots; it is necessary to
consider consumption by microorganisms and other
chemical reactions (Kirk, 2004). Since the reactions
that occur in the rhizosphere are numerous,
dynamic and fast, it is difficult to evaluate the total
release of O2 in situ by the roots, as well as the
intensity of the chemical reactions. Several studies
involving measurement of O2 losses by roots have
been developed in recent years. However, due to the
ease with which O2 diffuses through organic matter
and water, it is difficult to create and/or maintain
an environment free of molecular O2 when working
with a nutrient solution with rice. Some techniques
which have been used for these studies, such as
cultivation in an agar medium in containers
permeable to O2, exclusion of O2 with N2, and
reducing inorganic salts, among others, have not
been effective in excluding O2 from the root
environment, leading to conclusions that do not
always express the real environment of a rice plant
in flooded soil (Holzschuh et al., 2010).

Therefore, this study was conducted in order to
compare rice genotypes with contrasting genetic
bases in regard to their ability to form aerenchyma
and to transport and release oxygen into the
rhizosphere through the method of adventitious roots
grown in an environment lacking free oxygen, as in
flooded soil.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The experiment was carried out at the Rice
Research Station (Estação Experimental do Arroz -
EEA) of the Instituto Rio Grandense do Arroz (IRGA)
(Cachoeirinha, RS, Brazil) from November 2008 to
February 2009. The treatments compared the
following rice genotypes, representing a broad genetic
base: EPAGRI 108, EEA 406, BR-IRGA 409, IRGA 417,
IRGA 420, IRGA 423, IRGA 424, IRGA 3073, Bluebelle,
Orizica, Arize QM 1010, Avaxi and Formosa. The
genotypes were initially cultivated in the field until
the early flowering stage in a soil classified as a Typic
Haplaquents (Streck et al., 2008) with clay content
= 14 %, pH = 6.6, SOM (soil organic matter) = 1.8 %,
P = 33 mg dm-3, K = 47 mg dm-3, Al = 0.1 cmolc dm

Ca = 1.7 cmolc dm

-3 and Mg = 1.2 cmolc dm
-3.

Determination of the development of new adventitious
roots, root porosity and Fe plaque is described below,
according to the method proposed by Holzschuh et al.
(2010).

Obtaining roots of rice plants in a hypoxia
environment

The study was carried out in a greenhouse with
temperatures ranging from 20-30 oC. A hypoxic
condition was obtained by exploiting oxygen diffusion
ability through the plastic vinyl material in contact
with the soil in a chemical reduction process. For this
purpose, vinyl bags with dimensions of 30 × 40 cm
and 0.1 mm thickness were used.

To develop new adventitious roots, 50 L capacity
asbestos boxes were used. Each box received five vinyl
bags, which were placed on a 5.0 cm soil layer at the
bottom of the box, with a 10.0 cm distance between
them. An internal spacer (10 mm diameter electrical
conductor) was placed in each bag in order to maintain
an adequate space for root development without
physical resistance. The boxes were filled with Typic
Haplaquents (Streck et al., 2008) soil, leaving the bag
opening at 10.0 cm above the soil surface. Each bag
received 150 mL of nutrient solution with the following
composition in mmol L-1: 3.0 N-NO3

-, 1.5 N-NH4
+,

0.5 P, 2.0 K, 1.5 Ca, 1.0 Mg, 0.023 B, 3.0 Cl, 0.0047
Cu, 0.18 Fe, 0.047 Mn, 0.00011 Mo, 0.0015 Zn and
pH 5.5 (Silva &amp;amp; Bohnen, 2001). The soil was flooded
and maintained at a 5.0 cm water depth for two weeks,
which is long enough for the soil to be chemically
reduced.

Plants of the different genotypes initially grown
in the field until the beginning of the flowering stage
were removed whole from the soil and taken to the
laboratory, where uniform and vigorous tillers were
separated and all the roots were cut near the stem of
each plant. The plants were thoroughly washed to
avoid contamination with soil in the process of
cultivation of adventitious roots. To reduce the
transpiration rate, 1/3 of the leaf blades were removed.
These plants were placed in vinyl bags so that their

root collars were at the height of the soil surface. Each
bag received 12 plants of each genotype. After a period
of seven days, with newly formed adventitious roots,
plants were removed from the bags and immediately
taken to the laboratory. The nutrient solution was
regularly restored in the bags when the volume was
reduced by evapotranspiration. Analysis for
monitoring oxygen dissolved in the bags during root
formation indicated a concentration of less than
0.1 mg L-1 near the root collar (lower limit of detection
of the oximeter used), indicating the efficiency of the
method in removing the O2 and bringing about a
hypoxic environment.

Iron plaque

In the laboratory, seven roots of each genotype were
cut in 7.0 cm segments as of the apex. The roots were
fixed in an acrylic holder, placed in a glass box (20 ×
10 × 1.5 cm) and flooded with ultra pure nitrogen
(N2) (&lt;1 mg L

-1 O2) in order to remove the free oxygen.
The glass box was filled with soil solution of a
previously flooded Albaqualf (Streck et al., 2008) soil
with a history of Fe toxicity induction in susceptible
cultivars and a stabilized reduction process, with
pH = 6.2 and 80 mg L-1 of iron (Fe2+). The soil solution
was obtained by a system comprised of a 50 L asbestos
box filled with an Albaqualf soil in an advanced stage
of chemical reduction (Nava, 1997). The roots
remained in the soil solution for a period of four hours
so that the oxygen gradient formed between the inner
root (aerenchyma) and the soil solution would promote
the diffusion of molecular oxygen to the outside of the
roots. The contact time was established from prior
testing to keep the Fe concentration in the solution
from falling to very low levels, which would impede
diffusion of Fe along the roots. The release of oxygen
by the root and the combination with Fe2+ results in
the formation of oxidized Fe compounds with low
crystallinity, forming the Fe plaque on the root
surface. After 4 h in contact with the soil solution,
the roots were washed and cut into 2.0 cm segments
as of the apex, making up samples from each region
of the root, which included the segments of 0-2, 2-4
and 4-6 cm. The segments were individually
photographed and analyzed with the software
SIARCS v. 3.0 to calculate the surface area of the
segment. Each segment received the addition of
1.0 mL of 0.5 mol L-1 HCl and was kept at rest for
24 h to extract the Fe contained in the root,
characterizing each replication, for a total of seven
replications for each segment and genotype. The
concentrations of dissolved Fe in the samples were
determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometer
(Nava &amp;amp; Bohnen, 2002). From the digitized images,
the surface area of the segment was calculated with
the software SIARCS v. 3.0 which, together with the
Fe concentration in the sample, allows calculation
of the distribution of the chemical element in the
segment.

Root porosity

From the same plants used for determination of
Fe plaque, another group of roots was removed for
determination of porosity. Of these, 30 roots were cut
into segments of 0-2, 2-4 and 4-6 cm from the apex,
forming three replicates with 10 roots for each
segment and genotype. Each experimental unit
consisted of a group containing 10 segments (replicate).
Each group was carefully dried with tissue paper to
remove excess water from the root surface and weighed.
This determination composed the dry weight of the
roots containing the empty spaces of the aerenchyma
within. The segments were then placed in a plastic
syringe (60 mL) containing 10 mL of water. The
volume of the syringe was reduced to 10 mL and its
inlet was sealed with a silicone. The plunger was pulled
and locked to maintain a vacuum for 3 min to extract
the air from the roots. After that, the plunger was
released and maintained for another 3 min, allowing
entry of water into the vacuum created inside the roots.
This cycle was repeated until all the segments were
deposited at the bottom of the syringe, indicating that
the pore space was completely filled with water. The
roots were removed from the syringe and dried again
on the outside with tissue paper and weighed. The
fresh matter difference before and after the vacuum
and water intake treatment in the root was assumed
to correspond to root porosity, resulting in an estimate
of the magnitude of aerenchyma formed in each
segment along the root. This evaluation considers that
the ratio of the volume of water at room temperature
and the specific gravity is equal to 1 and, in this case,
can be used as an estimate of the volume of the pore
spaces in the root.

The test was conducted in a completely randomized
block statistical design with three replications. The
results of the weights of the root groups in evaluating
the porosity and the Fe content in each segment was
considered simple variables with respective
replications and were subjected to analysis of variance
(p&lt;0.05) and, when significant, comparison of mean
values of the treatments by the LSD test (p&lt;0.05) was
performed. Furthermore, the results of porosity and
total iron in each segment were correlated, and
correlation coefficients were shown for each genotype.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The volume of pore spaces varied (p&lt;0.05) among
genotypes for each of the three segments evaluated
and also among segments (Figure 1). For all genotypes,
porosity increased from the apex to the root base, as
the root became more mature (Figure 1). The
amplitude of these variations within each segment
was from 2 to 16, 22 to 56 and 45 to 89 % for 0-2, 2-4
and 4-6 cm, respectively (Figure 1), indicating that
the genotypes with a different genetic base reacted
differently to O2 limitation. Significant variations

among rice genotypes and among root regions were
also reported by Armstrong (1971) and Armstrong &amp;amp;
Armstrong (2005).

In descending order, the genotypes Bluebelle, EEA
406, Avaxi, IRGA 420, Arize QM 1010 and EPAGRI
108 developed larger diameter roots than the other
genotypes (Figure 2). According to Armstrong (1979)
and Sorrell et al. (2000), the thickness of the stem
and root structure is related to the volume of
aerenchyma formed and, hence, to the volume of O2
transported by these structures. However, the results
of this study did not show this tendency, and indicated
that the genotypes with the highest porosity were
Orizica, EPAGRI 108 and Formosa (Figure 3). When

all of the genotypes are analyzed, it is possible to
observe that there was no clear relationship between
diameter and porosity (Figures 2 and 3), which may
be related to the composition of the internal structure
of the roots and epidermal cells so as to maintain
sufficient levels of O2 within the root to maintain
respiration. An important drain of O2 in the roots is
associated with release to outside the roots due to the
lack of O2 in the flooded soil. In this case, a way of
assessing the permeability of the roots to O2 is through
determination of the iron deposited on the surface of
the roots due to oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+.

The amount of Fe accumulated on the root surface
(iron plaque) was different (p&lt;0.05) among the
genotypes and the segments (Figure 4). In general,
the amount of oxidized iron increased from the apex
(0-2 cm) to the most mature region of the root (2-4
and 4-6 cm), in accordance with the behavior of
formation of aerenchyma for all the genotypes (Figure 1).
This indicates that there is a positive relationship
between porosity, oxidized Fe and the oxygen
transported through the aerenchyma.

The correlation of porosity with Fe accumulation
in the different segments evaluated indicates that
although the increase in porosity is positively related
to the amount of oxidized Fe, this relationship is not
proportional among genotypes, as can be seen in the
slope of the straight lines (Figure 5a,b). This behavior
becomes more apparent when the formation of average
porosity and the cumulative sum of Fe along the
segments (Figures 1 and 6, respectively) is considered.
It may be observed that some genotypes that have
the highest average porosities, like EPAGRI 108,
Orizica and Formosa, did not necessarily have the
highest amounts of oxidized Fe along the roots.
Therefore, it is not possible to affirm that pore volume
per se is the determining factor of the amount of oxygen

for the genotype Orizica, which has the highest

porosity than Orizica but higher Fe plaque formation
(Figures 1 and 6, respectively). Likewise, genotypes
Arize, QM 1010, IRGA 423, Avaxi and EEA 406, which
showed intermediate average porosities, had the
highest values of total Fe (Figures 1 and 6,
respectively). This type of behavior occurs because
each genotype shows variations in root permeability,
both for oxygen and for other gases, water, nutrients
and toxic compounds, which alters the dynamics of
exchanges between the inner root and the external
environment (Colmer, 2003; Kirk, 2004; Kotula &amp;amp;
Steudle, 2009).

Accordingly, other plant adaptations to oxygen
losses may be listed in addition to aerenchyma
formation. The formation of physical barriers, for
example, reduces or prevents the outflow of oxygen in
the outermost layers of the root cells, allowing the
oxygen supply to be maintained at adequate levels
within the root tissue, especially at the apex
(Armstrong, 1979; Colmer, 2003; Kotula et al., 2009).
Formation of these barriers is determined by
characteristics of the cell walls that make up the
epidermis and exodermis of roots, such as thickness
and chemical composition (Colmer, 2003). The
accumulation of lignin and suberin polymers around
the cells of the endodermis and exodermis confers
resistance to radial oxygen loss, becoming a
determining factor in the permeability of the roots
(Armstrong et al., 2000; Armstrong &amp;amp; Armstrong,
2005).

In rice, the degree of suberization and lignification
of cell walls increases significantly as the root becomes
mature and this is indicated as the main factor for
reducing oxygen loss from the root (Armstrong &amp;amp;

IRON OXIDATION ON THE SURFACE OF ADVENTITIOUS ROOTS AND ITS RELATION TO...          191

Armstrong, 2005; Kotula &amp;amp; Steudle, 2009; Kotula et
al., 2009). On the other hand, considering that in the
region closest to the root apex the formation of these
barriers is less, due to this region being in full growth
(Kotula &amp;amp; Steudle, 2009; Armstrong &amp;amp; Armstrong,
2005; Kotula et al., 2009), the cumulative amount of
Fe is also small (Figure 4). This is because porosity
in this region is also lower (Figure 1) and, moreover,
it is in this region that the cell respiration rate is
more intense, thus consuming part of the oxygen
that reaches this location (Kirk, 2004). On the other
hand, Armstrong &amp;amp; Armstrong (2005) observed that
radial oxygen loss was higher in the zone near the
apex of adventitious rice roots grown under low O2
availability compared to plants grown in an aerated
solution.

Although the loss of oxygen to the environment
external to the root looks like a negative process, by
reducing the amount of oxygen available for cell
respiration, and the formation of barriers being agents
for reducing these losses, attention should also be given
to the fact that oxygen release has important functions
on root metabolism. Among the main functions is the
reduction of exposure to Fe2+, Mn2+, H2S, S

2-, HS- and
organic acids (Armstrong, 1971; Begg et al., 1994;
Revsbech et al., 1999). However, the barriers that
reduce the permeability of the root to oxygen also
interfere with the entry of water and nutrients in the
root (Armstrong, 1979; Kirk, 2003). According to Kirk
(2004), the most mature roots have less importance
in the process of uptake of water and nutrients
compared to the apex region, mainly due to
permeability. The greatest contribution of nutrients
and water would be associated with the development
of lateral roots, due to their greater number, increased
specific surface area, and also because they are directly
connected with the root xylem.

CONCLUSIONS

1. Rice genotypes with a contrasting genetic basis
respond differently in regard to formation of
aerenchyma and release of oxygen by the roots.

2. The porosity of adventitious roots of rice
genotypes is directly related to the formation of iron
plaque, but with different magnitudes for each
irrigated rice genotype.
