ABSTRACT 

 

The geopolymers (inorganic polymers) have attracted increasing attention from 

academia for several reasons, particularly because it is considered a 

sustainable material where industrial by-products can be used as raw material, 

and is based on a low energy cost process. Such materials find applications in 

virtually all industrial sectors, depending on the atomic ratio Si: Al, responsible 

for its properties. Currently the application of large volumes of geopolymers is 

focused on replacement of Portland cement. However, due to their similar 

properties to ceramic materials and the search ever greater of new applications, 

studies particularly on porous geopolymers has also attracted great interest 

from the academic community. But the processing routes currently used to 

obtain porous geopolymers are based on the routes applied in the civil 

construction for the production of aerated concrete with closed porosity, limiting 

its application where open porosity is required. Thus, this work had as objective 

the study and application of two new processing routes (Gelcasting Route and 

Gelcasting/Saponification/Peroxide Combined Route), to create a new class of 

porous geopolymers with predominantly open porosity. Both techniques consist 

of the adoption of the direct foaming technique used for the production of 

ceramic components, where the major difference between them is the chemical 

nature of the pore forming agent. For the "Gelcasting Route” commercial 

surfactants were used, and for the “Gelcasting/Saponification/Peroxide 

Combined Route” was explored the saponification reaction of a triglyceride in an 

alkaline medium for the in situ generation of surfactant. With the adoption of the 

suggested routes highly porous geopolymers were produced with a 

homogeneous microstructure, and open cell porosity of up to about 85vol%, 

with physical properties that suggest they may be used as a low cost 

replacement to highly porous ceramics in applications such as catalyst 

supports, filtration of hot gases, adsorption and insulating refractory furnaces.

GEOPOLÍMEROS ALTAMENTE POROSOS: EFEITO DA ROTA DE 

PROCESSAMENTO SOBRE AS PROPRIEDADES ALCANÇADAS 

 

ABSTRACT (PORTUGUESE) 

 

Os geopolímeros (polímeros inorgânicos) têm atraído a atenção da academia 

por várias razões, em particular pelo fato de ser considerado um material 

sustentável onde subprodutos industriais podem ser utilizados como matéria 

prima, além de um processo de baixo custo energético. Tais materiais 

encontram aplicações em todos os setores industriais, dependendo da razão 

atômica Si:Al, responsável por suas propriedades. Atualmente seu grande 

volume de aplicação está na substituição do cimento Portland. Entretanto, 

devido às suas propriedades similares aos materiais cerâmicos e a busca cada 

vez maior por novas aplicações, estudos sobre geopolímeros porosos tem 

despertado grande interesse da academia. Porém, as rotas usadas atualmente 

na obtenção dessa classe de materiais são baseadas nas da construção civil 

para a produção do concreto aerado, de porosidade fechada, limitando sua 

aplicação onde porosidade aberta é necessária. Neste sentido, este trabalho 

teve como objetivo o desenvolvimento de duas novas rotas de processamento 

(Gelcasting Route e Gelcasting/Saponification/Peroxide Combined Route), para 

a criação de uma nova classe de geopolímeros porosos com porosidade 

aberta. Em ambas as rotas foram adotadas a técnica de espumação direta para 

a produção de componentes cerâmicos, sendo que a maior diferença entre elas 

está na natureza química do agente porogênico. Na “Gelcasting Route” foram 

usados surfactantes comerciais, e na “Gelcasting/Saponification/Peroxide 

Combined Route” foi explorada a reação de saponificação de um triglicerídeo 

em meio alcalino para a geração in situ de surfactante. A partir das novas rotas 

foram produzidos geopolímeros altamente porosos, com microestrutura 

homogênea, células abertas e porosidade de até 85vol%, com propriedades 

físicas que sugerem sua utilização como substituto de baixo custo para 

produtos cerâmicos em aplicações tais como, suportes de catalisadores, 

filtração de gases quentes, adsorção e isolamento refratário de fornos.

GEOPOLIMERI ALTAMENTE POROSI: EFFETTO DELLA VIA DI 

TRASFORMAZIONE SULLE PROPRIETÀ RAGGIUNTI 

 

ABSTRACT (ITALIAN) 

 

I geopolimeri (polimeri inorganici) hanno attratto sempre più attenzione da parte 

del mondo accademico per diversi motivi, soprattutto perché è considerato un 

materiale sostenibile dove riffiuti industriale possono essere utilizzate come 

materia prima, e si basa su un processo a basso costo energetico. Tali materiali 

trovano applicazione in tutti i settori industriali, in funzione del rapporto atomico 

Si: Al, responsabile delle sue proprietà. Attualmente l'applicazione di grandi 

volumi è focalizzata sulla sostituzione del cemento Portland. Intanto, a causa 

delle loro proprietà simili ai materiali ceramici e la ricerca di nuove applicazioni, 

studi sui geopolimeri porosi, ha anche suscitato grande interesse da parte della 

comunità accademica. Tuttavia, i percorsi di lavorazione attualmente utilizzate 

per ottenere questi materiali sono basati sulle linee utilizzate nella costruzione 

per la produzione di calcestruzzo poroso, con porosità chiusa, limitano la sua 

applicazione dove è richiesta porosità aperta. Pertanto, questo studio hanno 

come obiettivo lo sviluppo di due nuovi percorsi di elaborazione (Gelcasting 

Route e Gelcasting/Saponification/Peroxide Combined Route), per creare una 

nuova classe di geopolimeri porosi con porosità aperta. Entrambe le tecniche 

consistono dell'adozione della tecnica di schiumatura diretta utilizzati per la 

produzione di componenti ceramici, e la differenza principale tra di loro è nella 

natura chimica dell'agente che formano i pori. Per "Gelcasting Route” sono stati 

usati tensioattivi commerciali, e per "Gelcasting/Saponification/Peroxide 

Combined Route " è stata esplorata la reazione di saponificazione di un 

trigliceride in ambiente alcalino per la generazione in situ di tensioattivi. Con 

l'adozione dei percorsi sono stati prodotti i geopolimeri con una microstruttura 

omogenea, cellule aperte e porosità fino a 85vol%, con proprietà fisiche che 

suggeriscono che possono essere usati in sostituzione per ceramiche 

altamente porosi in applicazioni come supporti catalizzatore, filtrazione di gas 

caldi, adsorbimento ed isolanti di forni refrattari.

1 INTRODUCTION 

 

The term geopolymer was created by Davidovits [1] in 1978 to define 

a class of materials of mineral nature with chemical composition similar to that 

of zeolite, but with a mixed microstructure (from amorphous to semi-crystalline). 

The silica (SiO2) and alumina (Al2O3) species present in the raw 

materials react in a highly alkaline medium, organizing themselves in a 

continuous three dimensional structure by sharing oxygen atoms, forming 

bonds such as Si-O-Al-O (sialate), Si-O-Al-O-Si-O (sialate-siloxo) or Si-O-Al-O-

Si-O-Si-O (sialate-disiloxo), also called polysialates, where the term sialate is an 

abbreviation for silicon-aluminate. 

Among the different types of geopolymers, those based on 

potassium activators show improved mechanical and thermal properties due to 

the larger size of the potassium ion compared to sodium [2].
 

These materials have found application in virtually all fields of 

industry, depending in particular on the SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio, which provides, 

among their properties, high mechanical strength, resistance to freeze-thaw, 

high chemical inertness, including acid attack, and excellent fire resistance, 

being considered as replacement for conventional cement-based applications 

as well as for ceramic components that can be used up to medium-high 

temperature (typically below 1200 °C) [1]. 

Explored applications include bricks, thermal insulation, and 

encapsulation of radioactive and toxic waste, foundry equipment and 

composites, as presented in Figure 1.1 [3].

Figure 1.1 Overall framework of the applications according to the atomic ratio 

Si:Al [3]. 

 

In addition, these materials can be considered sustainable, because 

they reach their final properties, which could be improved to some specific 

applications by heat treatment, at temperatures not exceeding 100 °C during 

the geopolymerization reaction, even considering the thermal energy employed 

for obtaining metakaolin and silicates, thereby limiting the energy required to 

produce a component.

Moreover, geopolymers could be produced using as raw materials, 

industrial waste as fly ash and furnace slag or building wastes as bricks and 

tiles, all of them rich in Al2O3 and SiO2 in a non-crystalline form. 

 

1.1 Generality on porous geopolymers 

 

Several papers describe the production of porous components based 

on geopolymers borrowing the typical approach used in the cement industry to 

procedure aerated concrete, that is the addition to an aqueous geopolymer 

slurry of components (such as silica fume or Al powder) capable of generating 

in situ gaseous H2 because of the oxidation reaction occurring with metallic Si 

or Al in a highly alkaline environment [2, 4]. Another approach that has been 

proposed is the addition of peroxides, which decompose generating gas [5]. 

These approaches provide a suitable way of fabricating highly porous 

components, but when these processing routes are used the cells are typically 

closed, i.e., no interconnecting pores are present on the cell walls, thereby 

greatly limiting properties such as the permeability to liquids or gases of the 

component. Despite all these studies, little work has been devoted to the 

production of geopolymer foams in routes where open cells could be achieved. 

Within this context, the objective proposed in this work was study and 

develop for the first time two alternative approaches: a Gelcasting Route (GCR), 

based on the presence of appropriate surfactants applied with mechanical 

stirring, and also a Gelcasting/Saponification/Peroxide combined route, using a 

triglyceride source which reacts in a basic medium to produce in situ surfactant 

and generate porosity with the stirring step. For both routes was possible the 

production of highly porous components from geopolymer precursors with 

predominantly open cells, which can extend the range of applications, including 

for example, processes where permeability and adsorption are required.

2 LITERATURE REVIEW 

 

2.1 Geopolymers 

 

A geopolymer is an inorganic binder, which is synthesized by mixing 

at ambient or slightly above temperatures (e.g. 90 °C) a reactive aluminosilicate 

powder (e.g. metakaolin, calcined clay, fly ash) with an alkaline activator that 

contains alkali hydroxide, silicates, aluminates, carbonates or sulphates, or a 

combination thereof (Figure 2.1). The reaction product consists mainly by an 

amorphous aluminosilicate phase due by interlinked SiO4
4-

 and AlO4
5-

 

tetrahedral forming a 3D-structure [6]. 

 

 

Figure 2.1 Schematic diagram for geopolymer production [6]. 

 

Even the term geopolymer, created by Davidovits [1], is commonly 

used to describe the amorphous to crystalline reaction products from synthesis 

of alkali aluminosilicates due the reaction with alkali hydroxide/alkali silicate 

solution [7], geopolymeric gels and composites are also usually applied to 

designate materials which are synthetized utilizing the same chemistry as: low-

temperature aluminosilicate glass [8], alkali-activated cement [9], geocement 

[10], alkali-bonded ceramic [11], inorganic polymer concrete [12], and 

hydroceramic [13]. 



6 

 

Generally, the alkali activation is a hydration reaction that comprises 

dissolution and precipitation of aluminosilicates (precursors) in an aqueous 

solution of alkaline or alkaline earth metal, such as: 

 

? hydroxide (ROH, R(OH)2), 

? salts of weak acids (R2CO3, R2S, RF), 

? salts of strong acids salts (Na2SO4, CaSO4.2H2O), 

? or silicate salts of type R2(n)SiO2, 

where R is an alkaline ion such as Na, K or Li, or an alkaline earth 

such as Ca [3]. 

 

Considering the zeolite chemistry, Davidovits [1, 3] suggests several 

molar ratios and parameters that should be controlled, because they affect 

substantially the geopolymer properties like durability and mechanical strength: 

? Geopolymer mixture:  0.20 &amp;lt;Na2O/SiO2 &amp;lt;0.48  

3.30 &amp;lt;SiO2 /Al2O3 &amp;lt;4.50  

0.80 &amp;lt;Na2O/Al2O3&amp;lt;1.60, 

 being possible the replacement of Na by K or Li. 

? Water content in the mixture: 10.00 &amp;lt;H2O/Na2O &amp;lt;25.00, 

also respecting the workability. 

? Curing temperature in the range 30-90 °C; 

? Curing time in the range 6-96 hours. 

 

Regardless several macroscopic characteristics of geopolymers 

obtained from different aluminosilicate sources may appear similar, their 

microstructure and physical, mechanical, chemical and thermal properties are 

distinct and depending essentially on the raw material from which they are 

produced [7]. The microstructure of metakaolin derived geopolymers, for 

example, has been investigated by systematic variation of activator composition 

and its effect on the mechanical strength [14–16]. Also, it was observed that the 

microstructure changed from containing large pores to being more homogenous 

with small pores as the Si/Al ratio was increased, which could be explained by 



7 

 

the strong correlation with the Young’s modulus and large increases in 

mechanical strength [14], however, any effect on the microstructure of changing 

the alkali cations from Na to K was not observed [15]. 

In this way, different microstructures and properties observed and 

cited in the literature may be explained by the conceptual geopolymer reaction 

proposed model presented in Figure 2.2, which shows a highly simplified 

reaction mechanism for the geopolymerization [6]. 

 

Figure 2.2 Conceptual schematic model for geopolimerization reaction [6]. 

 



8 

 

Figure 2.2 outlines the reaction mechanism that occurs during the 

transformation of a solid aluminosilicate source into a synthetic alkali 

aluminosilicate. Once in solution, the species released by dissolution are 

incorporated into the aqueous phase, which may already contain silicate 

present in the activating solution [6]. Hence, a complex mixture of silicate, 

aluminate and aluminosilicate species is thereby formed, and the equilibrium 

within these solutions have been intensively studied [17-19]. 

Even though presented linearly, these processes are largely coupled 

and occur concurrently, where dissolution of the solid aluminosilicate source by 

alkaline hydrolysis (consuming water) produces aluminate and silicate species. 

It is important to note that the dissolution of solid particles at the surface 

resulting in the liberation of aluminate and silicate into solution has always been 

assumed to be the mechanism responsible for conversion of the solid particles 

during geopolymerization [20]. 

 The geopolymerization reaction of a metakaolin in Na
+
 solution [1], is 

described, in seven steps, as follows: 

 

Step 1: alkalination and formation of tetravalent Al in the side group 

sialate -Si-O-Al-(OH)3-Na
+ 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Step 2: alkaline dissolution starts with the attachment of the base 

OH- to the silicon atom, which is thus able to extend its valence sphere to the 

penta-covalent state 

 

 

 

 

 



9 

 

Step 3: disruption of the siloxane oxygen in Si-O-Si through: transfer 

of the electron from Si to O, formation of intermediate silanol Si-OH and basic 

siloxo Si-O- 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Step 4: further formation of silanol Si-OH groups and isolation of the 

ortho-sialate molecule 

 

 

 

 

 

Step 5: reaction of the basic siloxo Si-O- with the sodium cation Na
+
 

and formation of Si-O-Na terminal bond 

 

 

 

 

 

Step 6: (if waterglass* is present): condensation between di-

siloxonate and ortho-sialate molecules and creation of ortho-sialate-disiloxo 

cyclic structure 

 

 

 

 

 

 



10 

 

Step 7: further polycondensation into Na-poly (sialate-disiloxo) albite 

framework with its typical feldspar chain structure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Despite this, the actual process of particle-to-gel conversion has 

never been confirmed in the highly alkaline and poorly solvated conditions as 

occurs during geopolymer synthesis. Thus, without of conclusive mechanistic 

understanding of solid particle conversion will be assumed the surface 

dissolution, as described in the model presented in Figure 2.2 [6]. 

 

2.1.1 Precursors 

 

 Aluminosilicates such as slag (obtained in blast furnaces), fly ash 

(obtained from the burning of coal in thermoelectric plants), volcanic ash (with 

natural thermal treatment) and powder tile or stone (passing through industrial 

furnaces) are potential starting materials for alkaline activation, because they 

have a prior heat treatment [1]. 

Thus, kaolin, a natural aluminosilicate, since undergone a suitable 

heat treatment to dehydroxylation and change of the coordination of aluminum, 

leads to metakaolin, which may also undergo alkaline activation. As a result of 



11 

 

these changes, the material loses much of its crystalline structure, getting a 

substantially amorphous state of high entropy, increasing their tendency to 

combine chemically [1, 3]. 

One important aspect to be observed in these materials is the very 

low or almost zero amount of calcium, not entering the traditional line of binders 

where calcium, as in Portland cement, has a prominent role [1, 3]. 

 

2.1.2 Activators 

 

 The most common alkaline activators used to obtain geopolymeric 

materials are sodium or potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, sodium or 

potassium silicates, and especially mixtures thereof [1]. 

 

2.1.3 Geopolymers to medium-high temperature applications 

 

In several studies, it has been observed a high degree of thermal 

stability of geopolymers, especially in K-polisialates with melting temperature in 

the range of 1400 °C [21]. However, geopolymers for application at 

temperatures between 1000 and 1200 °C were also obtained with sodium 

activators for applications such as thermal insulators [22]. 

 

2.2 Ceramic foams (filters) 

 

Ceramic filters have been used in many industrial applications, not 

only where polymeric membranes could not perform acceptably, but also where 

superior system integrity is required [23]. 



12 

 

The most commonly encountered advantages of ceramic filters, 

when compared to other membrane types used in pressure driven membrane 

processes, include the following [24, 26]: 

? long and reliable working lifetime 

? resistance to high temperatures across the entire pH range 

? excellent chemical stability  

? corrosion and abrasion resistant 

? bacteria resistant and, frequently, bio inert 

? compatibility with highly viscous fluids 

? enhanced ease of cleaning and sterilization 

 

 Ceramic filters are used, among the most mature filtration 

technologies, in the pressure-driven membrane processes for liquid 

separations, and are generally classified into four categories, according the size 

of the materials which should be retained: 

 

? Nanofiltration (0.005–0.0005 µm) 

? Ultrafiltration (0.1–0.001 µm) 

? Microfiltration (0.05–10 µm) 

 

 Regarding the materials which are made, the most common ceramic 

membranes are produced of Al, Si, Ti, or Zr oxides, but also with other materials 

including non-oxides (carbides, borides, nitrides, silicides) and with 

combinations thereof. 

 Specifically for food and pharmaceutical applications, membranes 

made of Al, Zr, and Ti oxides are suitable, since they meet the US Food and 

Drug Administration (FDA) requirements detailed in 21 Code of Federal 

Regulations (Good manufacturing practices) [24]. 

 Despite the advantages presented, the higher cost of raw materials 

and elevate temperature sintering to produce these ceramic membranes 

(oxide/non-oxide based) limits their use for some industrial application. Thus, 

various researchers have reported the study of clay-based low cost ceramic 



13 

 

membranes, using kaolin as starting material with other additives, as quartz and 

calcium carbonate, for industrial applications [27-29]. 

 

2.3 Industrial applications of ceramic filters 

 

 Initially, ceramic filters were developed for uranium enrichment and 

were also used in wastewater treatment. Over the past years, successful 

solutions and possible applications covered all industries and ceramic filters are 

increasingly being used in industries such as biotechnology and 

pharmaceutical, dairy, food and beverage, as well as chemical and 

petrochemical, microelectronics, metal finishing, and power generation [24]. 

 Figure 2.3 shows the classification of porous materials by pore size 

according IUPAC standard. 

 

Figure 2.3 Classification of porous materials by pore size according IUPAC 

standard [25]. 

 

 Besides the applications that are industry-specific, a number of 

common approaches are being used in different industries. Two examples are 

oil/water separation and the recovery of cleaning chemicals [30-32]. Many 

examples can be found in food industry, metal fabrication and allied industries, 

automotive industry, chemical manufacturing industry, and oil refinery, including 

petroleum oils from tanker washers, spills, drilling, various processing steps, 

etc. The benefits of ceramic membranes are also employed in recycling 

technology, for example, for degreasing cleaning baths, paint, coating and 

enamel, or petrochemicals recycling. The wastewater typically contains 

emulsified oils that are difficult to separate with conventional treatment 



14 

 

technologies such as coalescers and oil skimmers. Furthermore, many 

polymeric membranes are unsuitable due to their limited stability in aggressive 

chemical environments such as highly contaminated oily wastewater (e.g., lube 

oils, petroleum fractions) as previously mentioned [24]. 

 Once geopolymers can be used to replace ceramic components in 

several applications, it is possible to extend and apply this concept to the 

development of a new class of inorganic (geopolymer) membrane, with the 

same low cost clay-based presented earlier [29]. Also, specifically related to 

radioactive wastewater treatment, geopolymers behave similarly to zeolites, 

materials which are known for their abilities to adsorb toxic chemistry wastes. In 

the case of geopolymers, their three dimensional framework is responsible by 

locking the hazardous elements contained in the waste [3]. 

 As the field of application for these materials varies widely, the final 

properties of the filter in a particular application are also diverse. Consequently, 

the search for the different routes to produce these foams such as, the replica 

technique, the sacrificial template method and the direct-foaming technique, 

each having its own set of properties, has attracted interest from the academic 

world [33]. 

 

2.4 Processing routes t o macroporous ceramics 

 

 Ceramic properties can be tailored for each specific application by 

controlling the composition and microstructure of the porous ceramic. Changes 

in open and closed porosity pore size distribution, and pore morphology can 

have a major effect on a material’s properties. All of these microstructural 

features are in turn highly influenced by the processing route used for the 

production of the porous material. 

 The processing routes presented here are classified into replica, 

sacrificial template and direct foaming methods, as schematically illustrated in 

Figure 2.4. 

 



15 

 

 

Figure 2.4 Scheme of possible processing routes used for the production of 

macroporous ceramics [33]. 

 

2.4.1 Replica technique 

 

 The replica method is based on the impregnation of a cellular 

structure with a ceramic suspension or precursor solution in order to produce a 

macroporous ceramic exhibiting the same morphology as the original porous 

material. Many synthetic and natural cellular structures can be used as 

templates to fabricate macroporous ceramics through the replica technique. 

 

 



16 

 

2.4.2 Sacrificial template method 

 

 The sacrificial template technique usually consists of the preparation 

of a biphasic composite comprising a continuous matrix of ceramic particles or 

ceramic precursors and a dispersed sacrificial phase that is initially 

homogeneously distributed throughout the matrix and is ultimately extracted to 

generate pores within the microstructure. This method leads to porous materials 

displaying a negative replica of the original sacrificial template, as opposed to 

the positive morphology obtained from the replica technique described 

previously. 

 

2.4.3 Direct foaming method 

 

 In direct foaming methods, porous materials are produced by 

incorporating air into a suspension or liquid media, which is subsequently set in 

order to keep the structure of air bubbles created. In most cases, the 

consolidated foams are afterwards sintered at high temperatures to obtain high-

strength porous ceramics. 

Belonging to the direct-foaming technique, the gelcasting process is 

used to obtain foams with porosity levels up to 90% from ceramic suspensions. 

This process consists in vigorously stirring a slurry containing water-soluble 

organic monomers and a surfactant [33]. The polymerization reaction occurring 

among the monomer molecules enables the rapid stabilization of the wet foam, 

followed by drying and sintering of the ceramic particles [33-35]. Wet foams are, 

in fact, thermodynamically unstable systems in which processes such as 

drainage of the liquid phase and gas bubble coarsening lead to uncontrolled 

increase in cell size and ultimately foam collapse by rupture of the liquid film. 

Gas diffusion occurs between bubbles of different size and consequently 

different concentrations of gas, due to the difference in Laplace pressure 

between them (Ostwald ripening), leading to the degradation of the foam 

structure governed by the reduction of the Gibbs free energy of the system [33]. 



17 

 

To avoid this, surfactants can be used as surface-active agents for the 

stabilization of wet foams, because they stabilize the liquid-gas interface 

decreasing the surface tension of the system. These long-chain amphiphilic 

molecules adsorb at the gas bubble surface with their hydrophilic tail in contact 

with the aqueous phase. The foaming ability of a surfactant is related to its 

effectiveness to lower the interfacial energy or the surface tension at the gas-

liquid interface. Surfactants are classified, according to the nature of the 

hydrophilic group, as anionic, cationic, non-ionic, and amphoteric [36]. 

In the case of a slurry containing geopolymer precursors, which has 

several ions in solution (K
+
, Al

3+
, Fe

3+
, SiO4

2-
), non-ionic surfactants have a 

more pronounced effect since they possess hydrophilic groups without electric 

charges. The type of surfactant can influence the cell size, size distribution and 

degree of interconnection among adjacent cells (open/closed cell ratio). The wet 

foam can be rapidly gelled simply by exploiting the kinetic of geopolymerization 

reaction itself in a temperature higher than at room temperature, with no need 

for organic monomers or other stabilization/gelling additives. 

 

2.5 Saponification 

 

As it is well known, the hydrolysis of fat or oil in alkaline medium 

produces glycerol and fatty acid salts (soap) for cleaning purpose, for example, 

and the reaction is called saponification [37]. An example of the saponification 

of a triglyceride with KOH to form a mixture of potassium carboxylates (soap) 

and glycerol is showed in reaction 2.1. 

 

 

        

       (2.1) 

 

 
 



18 

 

As suggested in the equation, soap is a salt composed of a mixture 

of carboxylate anions, due a variety of fatty acid residues in each triglyceride 

molecule, and a univalent cation provided by the alkaline medium. 

Concerning the saponification reaction, one important analytical 

chemical parameter explored here, which should be quoted, is the 

saponification value (SV), that is linked to the average molecular weight of all 

fatty acids and represents the quantity in grams of potassium hydroxide 

required to saponify 1 g of oil [38]. 

Also, in the present work, this parameter (SV) was used to determine 

the amount of KOH which should be add with the oil to ensure the in situ 

formation of surfactant molecules by the saponification reaction. 

 

2.6 Triglycerides sources 

 

 Vegetable oils and fats are mainly constituted of triglycerides that 

consist of one molecule of glycerol combined with three molecules of fatty 

acids. These latter contain a long chain of carbon atoms, linked by single bonds 

and combined with hydrogen, ending with carboxyl group. Fatty acids are 

almost entirely straight chain aliphatic carboxylic acids. The broadest definition 

includes all chain lengths, but most natural fatty acids are C4 to C22, with C18 

most common. Besides that, fatty acids can be divided into two classes: 

saturated and unsaturated. In the latter one or more couples of two adjacent 

carbon atoms are linked by a double bond. If there is more than one double 

bond, the fatty acid is polyunsaturated, as compared to monounsaturated when 

there is only one double bond [38]. 

Biodiesel is a mixture of fatty acid alkyl esters mostly produced from 

the transesterification of fats and oils. In this process, the triglycerides contained 

in the oil react with an alcohol, commonly methanol, and a catalyst, usually 

sodium hydroxide (NaOH), to yield fatty acid methyl esters [39]. 



19 

 

Taking into account how the saponification reaction was applied 

here, there are some important attributes which represents a different aspect of 

the produced soap [40]. 

? Bubbly lather: refers to the soap’s ability to lather up and get 

bubbly. Higher values will tend to produce fluffy foam rather 

than creamy foam with little or no bubbles, usually in the range 

from 14 to 46. 

? Creamy lather: this value indicates the stability and 

creaminess of the lather. Usually, increasing bubbly will 

decrease creamy and vice versa. The higher creamy numbers 

will tend to produce a creamy lather with lesser amounts of 

bubbles or foams, usually in the range from 16 to 48.

3 MATERIALS AND METHODS 

 

This section presents all materials used to obtain the geopolymer 

composition (precursors and activators) and also the additives applied in the 

two proposed routes (GCR and GCSPCR) in order to promote the porosity 

(pore agents). 

Basically, the pore agents used were commercial non-ionic 

surfactants for the GCR and triglycerides sources for the GCSPCR which were 

responsible to generate in-situ surfactant due the saponification reaction. 

 

3.1 Materials 

 

3.1.1 Gelcasting route (GCR) 

 

Experiments were carried out using as geopolymer precursors 

metakaolin obtained from the calcination at 750 °C for 6 hours in a muffle of 

kaolin (Minasolo - Minerals and Abrasives Grains (Brazil)), metakaolin HP Ultra 

(Metacaolim do Brasil (Brazil)), fly ash class F (#200 mesh; Tractebel Energia 

(Brazil)), and as alkaline activators commercial sodium hydroxide, potassium 

hydroxide KOH pellets (85% purity, Dinâmica Química Contemporânea Ltda 

(Brazil)), sodium silicate (Si/Na = 3.30, density = 1.39, viscosity = 420 cP, and 

potassium silicate (Si/K = 2.05, density = 1.38 g/l, viscosity = 430 cP; Una Prosil 

- Usina Nova América (Brazil)). Considering the high content of iron oxide 

(Fe2O3) present in the fly ash (10.2 wt%), a maximum addition of 30 wt% of fly 

ash with respect to metakaolin was used, because, as quoted by Lloyd et al. [5], 

during alkaline activation iron dissolves from iron-rich fly ash particles and forms 

either crystalline or colloidal hydrates. 

In order to decrease the viscosity of the suspension, polyacrylic acid 

(Dolapix CE-64, Zschimmer &amp;amp; Schwarz) was used. 

For the stabilization of the wet foams, two non-ionic surfactants were 

added in different amounts: Tween 80, a Polyoxyethylene 20 sorbitan 



22 

 

monooleate - C64H124O26 (VWR BDH Prolabo) and Triton X-100, a Polyethylene 

glycol tert-octylphenyl ether - C14H22O(C2H4O)n ,n = 9-10 (Sigma-Aldrich). 

 

3.1.2 Gelcasting/Saponification/Peroxide Combined Route (GCSPCR) 

 

For this route, samples were produced using the same raw materials 

described previously (GCR), up to the surfactant addition. Other components 

were also used as sources of different triglycerides: sunflower oil, olive oil, 

babassu oil, coconut oil, castor oil, palm stearin, bovine lard, soybean biodiesel 

and hydrogen peroxide (10 vol.), to contribute to the macro-pore formation. 

With the aim to show the efficiency of the proposed technique, 

sunflower oil foams were also produced with i) the addition of oil but no 

hydrogen peroxide (saponification reaction) and ii) with the addition of hydrogen 

peroxide but no oil (peroxide reaction). To make this comparative test, hydrogen 

peroxide and sunflower oil were added always in the same amounts specified 

previously. 

 

3.2 Methods 

 

Since the experimental development proposed here was done in 

three steps as follows: 

? First step (Brazil): was done all initial characterization of raw 

materials and formulation of the geopolymer, presented in 

Appendix A; 

? Second step (Italy): studied and applied the gelcasting route 

(GCR) in order to obtain open-cell geopolymer foams; 

? Third step (Italy / Brazil): studied and applied the gelcasting / 

saponification / peroxide combined route (GCSPCR). 

 



23 

 

All methodology will be present and discussed according the two 

routes studied. 

 In the same way, always according the applied route, were evaluated 

some physical properties of the geopolymer foams, without any comparative 

intent, but to understand and set the process parameters and respective effect 

on the reached properties in each route. 

 

3.2.1 Gelcasting route (GCR) 

 

The first step in the preparation the geopolymer foams was the 

preparation of a 15 M KOH solution, which should be used after 24 hours [41]. 

Then, a solution of potassium-based activators and distilled water was prepared 

in a mixer (500 rpm, 30 minutes, Ika-Werke Ost Basic, Staufen, Germany), 

following the oxide molar ratios presented in Table A.5. To this solution, Dolapix 

CE-64 was added (0.32 wt% on the total weight). Then, MSMK and FA were 

added at room temperature to the activator solution, stirring at 1000 rpm for 30 

minutes, producing suspensions with a solid content ranging from 61 to 71 wt%. 

 The geopolymer precursor suspension was placed in an oven at 

80ºC for 20 minutes to initiate the geopolymerization reaction, which is the key 

to enabling the retention of porous morphology of the wet foam subsequently 

produced. Thereafter, the suspension was removed from the oven and stirred 

again while adding dropwise one of the surfactants. 

 Surfactant addition ranged from 2 to 4 wt% with respect to total 

weight, and the suspension was stirred at different mixing velocities (800, 1500 

and 2000 rpm for 5 minutes) in order to generate wet foams by the entrapment 

and stabilization of air bubbles. 

 Finally, the geopolymer foam was cast in a polystyrene mold, with 

dimensions of 4 cm of diameter and 1 cm of thickness to produce the specimen 

to the permeability analysis as shown Figure 3.1(a) and a parallelepiped of 

3 x 2 x 2 cm in Figure 3.1(b) to the mechanical strength test, and placed for 1h 

at 80ºC into an oven after sealing it into a plastic bag.

 The sample was then removed from the plastic bag and left at 80 °C 

for further 4 hours. It should be noted that the samples were characterized as 

prepared, and were not subjected to any heat treatment at high temperature.

 Geopolymer foams were heat treated in a tube furnace (Carbolite 

CWF1200, Derbyshire, UK) at 700 and 1200 °C in air with heating rate of 

2 °C/min, dwelling time of 2 h and cooling rate of 10 °C/min, in order to assess 

how the physical properties of the geopolymer foams were affected by the 

thermal treatment. 

 

3.2.1.1 Total and open porosity 

 

 The bulk density of the geopolymer foams was computed by dividing 

the mass of foam cut into a parallelepiped divided by its geometric volume 

measured, with a caliper. The total pore volume (?) was obtained based on the 

equation 3.1, where ?0 is the true (skeleton) density of the pore-free solid 

material [43], measured with an helium pycnometer (Accupyc 1330, 

Micromeritics, Norcross, GA), and also, the open porosity was quantified by 

“Archimedes” Principle.

3.2.1.2 Mechanical strength 

 

 The compressive strength of as prepared samples was determined 

using a Universal Testing Machine (Instron 1121, Canton, Massachusetts, 

USA), with a constant crosshead displacement of 1 mm/min. At least 5 

specimens per type were tested.

3.2.1.3 Permeability 

 

The air-permeation behavior of porous geopolymers was investigated 

at room temperature using a laboratory-made air permeator (Figure 3.2) at the 

Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare, Laboratori Nazionali di Legnaro (INFN-

LNL), Italy, which is based on an action-response device, making a correlation 

between the pressure drop applied across a porous medium and the resulting 

flow rate or velocity of the fluid output [44]. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 3.3 Laboratory-made air permeator used to measure the permeability 

of the porous geopolymers. 

 

Experiments were carried out on disk-shaped samples, which were 

tightly fixed with rubber rings inside the sample holder that provided a useful 

flow diameter of 1.99 cm with air flow, allowed to flow upward through the disk, 

at room temperature (20–24 °C) and atmospheric pressure (1 atm). Pressure 

drop (?P) across the disk was measured by either one of two digital 

manometers (Greisinger Electronic GmbH, Regenstauf, DE, model GMH 3161-

01 CE, range 0–25 mbar, resolution of 0.01 mbar and model GMH 3161-13 CE, 

range 0–2000 mbar, resolution of 1 mbar) and the resulting volumetric air flow 

rate across the disk was measured by a laboratory made soap-bubble flow 

meter with useful volume of 50 mL and resolution of 0.1 mL. At least 20 sets of 

pressure drop and flow rate curves were acquired in steady-state conditions to 

ensure an accurate fitting analysis.  



27 

 

3.2.1.4 Morphological analysis 

 

 The morphology of the foams was investigated using an optical 

stereoscope (Wild Heerbrugg, Type 376788, coupled with a digital camera) and 

a Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM, FEI Quanta 200, Hillsboro, Oregon, 

USA). 

 The pore size distribution was evaluated from the acquired images 

using the Axio Vision 4.8.2 LE image processing software (Carl Zeiss, 

Oberkochen, Germany). 

 Values obtained by image analysis were converted to 3D values 

using the stereological equation (3.2), in order to determine the effective cell-

size [45] and present these data in Figures 4.8, 4.9, 4.23, 4.25, 4.27 and 4.29.

3.2.1.5 Specific surface area 

 

 The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller specific surface area (SSA) was 

determined by multipoint BET method using the adsorption data in the relative 

pressure (P/P0) range 0.05–0.3 obtained by a Quantachrome Nova Station A 

(Quantachrome Instruments, Boynton Beach, USA). 

 All the samples were degassed at 300 °C prior to nitrogen adsorption 

measurements. 

 

3.2.1.6 Linear thermal shrinkage 

 

A dilatometer (DIL 402 PC, Netzsch, Selb, DE) was used to measure 

the shrinkage of the geopolymer up to 1250 °C in air with heating rate of 

10 °C/min. 



28 

 

3.2.1.7 TG/DTA analysis 

 

TG/DTA analysis was performed by a Simultaneous Thermal 

Analyzer (STA 409, Netzsch, Selb, DE) up to 1400 °C in air with heating rate of 

10 °C/min. 

 

3.2.2 Gelcasting/Saponification/Peroxide Combined Route (GCSPCR) 

 

When the vegetable oil is added to the highly alkaline geopolymer 

suspension (pH ~9.5), it generates in situ carboxylate surfactants (soap 

molecules) through the saponification reaction, which consists of the hydrolysis 

of the triglycerides found in oils or fats, plus glyceride, a water soluble molecule 

(glycerol) which can be extracted by water after the curing process [63]. While 

previous work exploited the formation and extraction of glycerol to create micro- 

and meso-pores increasing the specific surface area of the material, we used 

the surfactant molecules (produced in situ) to generate stable wet macrocellular 

foam with interconnected porosity, obtained by stirring (direct foaming, aided by 

the gas generated from the decomposition of the peroxide, followed by 

gelcasting to set the structure). 

For this route, samples were produced using the same raw materials 

described previously (GCR), up to the surfactant addition. Thereafter, the 

suspension was removed from the oven and then 25 wt% of triglyceride source 

(oil or fat) and respective amount of KOH solution, considering the SV, were 

added, mixing at 500 rpm for 5 minutes. Then, the combined suspension was 

placed in an oven at 80ºC for 30 minutes, being stirred again at 1500 rpm for  

5 minutes, and then 6 wt% of hydrogen peroxide was added. 

Finally, the geopolymer foam was cast in a polystyrene mold and 

placed for 1h at 80 ºC into an oven after sealing it into a plastic bag, and then 

removed from the plastic bag and left at 80 °C for further 4 hours. 

The process is illustrated in Figure 3.2.

Figure 3.4 Schematic diagram for the production of geopolymer foams by 

Gelcasting/Saponification/Peroxide Combined Route [46]. 

 

Prior to the characterization, the glycerol generated by the 

saponification reaction was extracted by hot water exchanging it every 30 

minutes until it remained clear, visually indicating complete extraction. This step 

of the extraction of glycerol can also be used to confirm the extent of the 

geopolymerization reaction, since non-fully condensed geopolymer materials 

are sensitive to water and undergo swelling or complete destruction [3]. Also, 

glycerol and others organic compounds could be extract by heat treatment. 

 To this route, the same set of physical properties evaluated in 

gelcasting route was performed, only changing the equipments, since this study 

was completed in Brazil. 

 Geopolymer foams were heat treated in box furnace (Lindberg / Blue 

M BF511732C, Asheville, USA) at 300, 600, 900 and 1200 °C in air with heating 

rate of 2 °C/min, dwelling time of 2 h and cooling rate of 10 °C/min, in order to 

assess how the physical properties were affected by the thermal treatment. 



30 

 

 3.2.2.1 Total and open porosity 

 

 To this route, total and open porosity were evaluated in the same 

manner of the GCR. 

 

3.2.2.2 Mechanical strength 

 

 The compressive strength of as prepared samples was determined 

using a Universal Testing Machine (Instron 5500R, Canton, Massachusetts, 

USA), with a constant crosshead displacement of 1 mm/min. At least 5 

specimens per type were tested. 

 

3.2.2.3 Permeability 

 

Likewise to the GCR, the air-permeation behavior was investigated at 

room temperature using a laboratory-made air permeator at University of 

Ribeirão Preto / UNAERP (Brazil). 

 

3.2.2.4 Morphological analysis 

 

 The morphology of the foams was investigated using an Olympus 

LEXT OLS4000 3D Laser Measuring Microscope, which was used also to 

evaluate the pore size distribution, and a Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM, 

FEI Quanta 200, Hillsboro, Oregon, USA). As previously mentioned, values 

obtained by image analysis were converted to 3D values using the stereological 

equation (3.2), in order to determine the effective cell-size [45]. 

 



31 

 

3.2.2.5 Specific surface area 

 

 The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller specific surface area (SSA) was 

determined by multipoint BET method using a Quantachrome Nova 1000e 

(Quantachrome Instruments, Boynton Beach, USA). 

  

3.2.2.6 Linear thermal shrinkage and TG/DTA analysis 

 

 Considering that these characteristics are intrinsically related to the 

materials and not with the processing route, and were adopted the same 

geopolymer base composition, these measures were not repeated and were 

considered results previously obtained for the GCR.

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIOIN 

 

 As presented in the Materials and Methods section, the achieved 

results will be also presented according the used route. 

 

4.1 Gelcasting route (GCR) 

 

4.1.1 Total and open porosity 

 

With the aim of producing components possessing a high amount of 

total porosity, first was evaluated the influence of the solid content (with real 

density of 2.192 g/cm
3
, measured with a helium pycnometer Accupyc 1330, 

Micromeritics) in the slurry, maintaining fixed all other parameters to a specific 

value, which was set according to preliminary optimization experiments 

(surfactant content = 2 wt%; mixing speed = 1500 rpm). 

In Figure 4.1 the presented data indicate that, as expected, with 

increasing the solid content in the suspension a reduction in total porosity 

occurred for both types of surfactant, because of the increase in viscosity in the 

slurries. We can observe that Triton X-100 appeared to be more effective in 

incorporating and maintaining a large amount of gas into the liquid, which led to 

a larger amount of total porosity after gelling and drying. This behavior is 

certainly related to the difference in the chemical structure of the two 

surfactants, but further investigations are necessary to determine the accurate 

acting mechanism and others differences among them. 

Early stability theories assumed that the foam stability was 

determined by the adsorbed surfactant which controlled the mechanical–

dynamical properties of the surface layer (surface tension gradients) [47]. Also, 

important parameters to be taken into consideration are the surface viscosity, 

surface occupancy, gravity drainage and capillary suction. 



34 

 

Considering these aspects, Gibbs and Marangoni [47] proposed two 

theories of elasticity for surfactant solutions, both dealing with the surface 

elasticity effect caused by different mechanisms. In this sense, surfactants with 

different chemical structure and foaming properties can notably influence the 

microstructure of porous scaffold prepared by the direct foaming method. 

 

Figure 4.1 Effect of solid content in the slurry on total porosity. All samples 

were produced using 2 wt% of surfactant and mixing at 1500 rpm 

mixing speed. 

 

Since it shows a good behavior of both porosity and handling, the 

solid content of the slurry was set as standard at 68 wt% to evaluate the effect 

of the mixing speed (800, 1500 and 2000 rpm) for two amounts of surfactant  

(2 and 4 wt%).The results are reported in Figure 4.2. which shows that, again, 

samples produced withTritonX-100 surfactant possessed a higher total porosity, 

in comparison to those produced using Tween 80. With increasing mixing 

speed, the total amount of porosity decreased, and no significant difference 

between the two types of surfactant used as well as their amount was observed. 

The overall change in porosity was about 8 vol% in all cases, when going from 

800 to 2000 rpm and both for 2 or 4 wt% of surfactant, and the decrease in 

porosity was particularly limited (15 vol%) when increasing mixing speed from 

800 to 1500 rpm. The reason for this could be ascribed to an increase of shear 



35 

 

stress in the suspension at higher rotational speed, which resulted in a lower 

total volume of entrapped air into the suspensions [48-50].  

As far as the amount of surfactant was concerned, the data indicate 

that, regardless of the mixing speed used, an average increase in total porosity 

was achieved when passing from 2 to 4 wt% of surfactant addition, which was 

of 10% for samples produced using Tween 80 and of 15% for those made using 

Triton X-100. Increasing the surfactant concentration favors its adsorption at the 

gas/liquid interface and decreases the surface tension, thereby promoting 

foaming. 

For a certain concentration of surfactant (Cmax), the surface tension is 

minimal and foaming is maximum. This concentration is close to the critical 

micelle concentration (CMC), which represents the minimal surfactant quantity 

to reach the minimal surface tension. For higher concentrations, the surface 

tension remains minimal, but the addition of more surfactant will generate an 

increase in the viscosity of the system, which inhibits the foaming effect [51]. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 4.2 Effect of rotation speed and surfactant content in the slurry (solid 

content set at 68 wt%); a) 2 wt% surfactant; b) 4 wt% surfactant. 

 

 Figure 4.3 reports the total and open porosity values for the samples 

investigated in this study, showing that, for a surfactant content of 2 wt%, an 

open porosity in the range of 52 vol% for Tween 80 and of 46 vol% for Triton X-

100 was generated. Similarly, for a surfactant addition of 4 wt%, the open 

porosity was in the range of 56 and 54 vol% for Tween 80 and Triton X-100, 

respectively. These results confirm that surfactants with different chemical 



36 

 

structure and foaming ability can influence the microstructure of porous 

geopolymers fabricated by gelcasting.

Archimedes Principle; surfactant content set at 2 wt% (a) and  

4 wt% (b). 

 

It is also important to observe that the processing parameters (slip 

rheology, foam volume, type of surfactant, idle time prior to polymerization, and 

other features) affect also the ratio between open and closed cells in the foams 

[56, 57]. Moreover, foams with different characteristics (total porosity, average

results in different mechanical properties. 

The heat treatment at 700 °C had no pronounced effect on the total 

porosity, as shown in Figure 4.4 for samples prepared using 2 wt% (a) and 4 

wt% (b) of surfactant, respectively. However, increasing the heat treatment 

temperature to 1200 °C led to a ~6.0 to 20.0 vol% decreases in the total 

porosity, depending on the type and content of surfactant.

foams: (a) 2 wt% of surfactant; (b) 4 wt% of surfactant.

4.1.2 Mechanical strength 

 

The correlation between compressive strength, relative density and 

total porosity of the geopolymer foams is shown in Figure 4.5. For samples 

produced using 2 wt% of Tween 80 (Figure 4.5a), an increase of ~41% in the 

compressive strength (from 2.35 to 3.32 MPa) was observed when the total 

porosity decreased ~6% (from 66 to 62%). This decrease on the total porosity 

was accompanied by a ~18% increase of the relative density (from 0.75 to 

0.85). Also, samples produced using 2 % of Triton X-100 as a surfactant had a 

similar behavior, with similar changes in property values: ~40% increase (from 

1.94 to 2.72 MPa) for the compressive strength; ~10% decrease (from 69 to 

61%) for the total porosity, and ~26% increase (from 0.69 to 0.87) for the 

relative density. 

This trend was more pronounced for samples produced using 4 wt% 

of surfactant (see Figure 4.5b). For Tween 80, a ~84% increase (from 0.97 to 

1.79 MPa) for the compressive strength was observed, when the total porosity 

decreased ~6% (from 72 to 68%), with an associate ~28% increase (from 0.47 

to 0.60) in the relative density. For Triton X-100, a ~64% increase (from 0.45 to 

0.74 MPa) of the compressive strength was observed when the total porosity 

decreased ~7% (from 77 to 72%), with an associate ~26% (from 0.49 to 0.62) 

increase in the relative density. Such behavior can be explained considering 

that the compressive strength of porous materials is depending on the amount 

of solid material present in each sample, represented by the relative density, 

and is also affected by the average pore size, with decreasing strength with 

increasing pore size [60]. The highest values of compressive strength for the 

Tween 80 surfactant could be explained by its different chemical composition 

and behavior, resulting in a higher densification of the struts (see later). We 

should also remember that the strength of porous ceramics increases with 

decreasing cell size, and therefore the effect of surfactant on cell size would 

also play a role in controlling the strength of the components. Tween 80 

surfactant was shown to produce smaller cell sizes than Triton X-100, at least 

for some processing conditions [61]. Regarding this feature, investigations on 



39 

 

the strength of samples produced with 2 wt% of Tween 80 (2000 rpm) indicate 

an increase of ~14% in the compressive strength (from 3.32 ± 0.40 to 3.97 ± 

0.40 MPa) and ~184% (from 3.32 ± 0.40 to 9.44 ± 0.30 MPa) after heat 

treatment at 700 and 1200 °C respectively.

porosity of geopolymer foams not heat treated: (a) 2 wt% of 

surfactant; (b) 4 wt% of surfactant. 

 

4.1.3 Permeability 

 

The permeability measurement results were treated according to 

Forchheimer’s equation (4.1), which describes the flow resistance through 



40 

 

porous media for a wide range of fluid velocities [58]., and the permeability 

coefficients k1 (Darcian) and k2 (non-Darcian) were evaluated according to 

Forchheimer’s equation [44, 59]:  

 

??

?
=

?

?1
?? +

?

?2

where L is the medium thickness along flow direction, vs is the superficial 

velocity, µ is the absolute viscosity, ? is the fluid density, k1 (Darcian) and k2 

(non-Darcian) the permeability coefficients. 

According to the equation 4.1 the term µvs/k1 represents the viscous 

effects of the fluid-solid interaction, whereas the term ?v
2
s/k2 represents the 

kinetic effects [59]. Fluid loses energy by friction between the molecules of the 

fluid during draining; in this case, the higher the viscosity of the fluid (µ), the 

greater the friction will be and consequently the conversion of pressure energy 

into heat. Usually, the increase in area is associated with the reduction of 

particle size for granular structures or of pore size for cellular structures [59]. 

Besides that, any change in the processing parameters, which leads to an 

increase of the interconnected porosity and pore size, or the decrease of pore 

tortuosity and roughness, will lead to higher values of k1 and k2 [44]. 

 Derived from the Kozeny–Carman or Ergun relationships [44], 

notwithstanding the limited validity for specific porous medium properties, the 

typical proportionalities between porosity P and the coefficients k1 and k2 may 

be described by the following relations (4.2 and 4.3):

       (4.3) 

 

The permeability constants of geopolymer foams produced with 

different surfactants (type and content) and different mixing speed are 



41 

 

compared in Figure 4.6, as a function of open porosity. In Figure 4.6(a), for 

samples produced using a surfactant addition of 2 wt%, we can observe that an 

8% increase in the open porosity (from 50 to 54%) led to a 2 and 3 orders of 

magnitude increase in k1 and k2 values, respectively, when using Tween 80. 

Likewise, when using Triton X-100 as a surfactant, a ~16% increase (from 43 to 

50%) in the open porosity also led to an increase of 2 and 3 orders of 

magnitude in k1 and k2 values. 

Considering a surfactant addition of 4 wt%, Figure 4.6(b), an 

increase of ~6% in the open porosity (from 54 to 57%) led to an increase of 1 

and 2 orders of magnitude in k1 and k2 values, respectively, when using Tween 

80. Similarly, an increase of ~12% in the open porosity (from 51 to 57%) led to 

an increase of 1 order of magnitude for both, k1 and k2 values, when using 

Triton X-100 as a surfactant. This increase in the k1 and k2 values can be 

attributed due to the increase of the interconnected porosity (open porosity), as 

previously mentioned [44].

 As shows Figure 4.7, these geopolymer foams present similar 

permeation behavior to those ceramic foams obtained by gelcasting, being 

suitable to replace ceramic components for use in filtration or adsorption 

applications. 

 The dispersion of the values shown in Figure 4.7 is the result of 

variations in process parameters (type and surfactant content, and mixing 

speed).

4.1.4 Morphological analysis 

 

When considering the effect of processing parameters (mixing 

speed, surfactant type and amount) on the morphology of the geopolymer 

foams, it is possible to observe that the samples possessed a different average 

cell size and size distribution depending on how they were obtained. Figures 4.8 

and 4.9 shows the optical images, taken at low magnification, illustrating the 

general morphology of the samples and report the cell size distribution 

computed by image analysis for each sample. Firstly, we can observe (see 

Figure 4.8) that when increasing the mixing speed from 1500 to 2000 rpm, the 

average cell size D50 decreased by 20% (from 345 ± 34 to 272 ± 36 µm) for 

samples produced using 2 wt% of Tween 80, and by 26% (from 463 ± 80 to 338 

± 53 µm) for samples produced using 2 wt% of Triton X-100.

1500 rpm; d) Triton X-100, 2000 rpm. In the insets are shown the 

pore size distribution for each sample. 

 



45 

 

 A similar decrease in D50 value (~25%, from 555 ± 90 to 453 ± 86 µm 

for samples made using Tween 80 and ~ 13%, from 530 ± 113 to 459 ± 90 µm 

for samples made using Triton X-100) occurred also for samples produced 

using a surfactant amount of 4 wt% (see Figure 4.9). This effect was also 

observed when producing liquid foams, and considering the stresses applied to 

the slurry by the mechanical shearing processes the Taylor model can be used 

to explain the rheological behavior and respective cell size obtained [52-54]. 

This model illustrates that, when an isolated, spherical droplet of 

radius R0 with a relatively low viscosity ?d is dispersed in a fluid of higher 

viscosity ?c, the droplets will deform into an ellipsoid or elongated cylinder. 

Ordinarily, the rupture of these elongated cylinders in smaller droplets is 

achieved when reaching the so-called Rayleigh instability, which reduces the 

high interfacial energy possessed by the elongated droplets. Deformation of the 

dispersed phase only takes place when the shear stress ?c? exceeds the 

interfacial stress ?/R0, where ? is the shear rate and ? is the interfacial tension. 

 The ratio between these two stresses is defined by the capillary 

number (Ca). When the capillary number overcomes a critical value Cacrit, the 

elongated droplet will rupture into smaller droplets of average radius R 

according to equation (4.4). In this sense, Cacrit depends on the viscosity ratio 

between the dispersed and continuous phase (?d/?c) and the type  

of flow [54, 55].

pore size distribution for each sample. 

 



47 

 

This model has also been applied for the prediction of bubble size as 

a function of suspension composition for both, particle-stabilized emulsions and 

surfactant stabilized emulsions [55]. 

Secondly, it is possible to observe an inverse relation between the 

average cell size and the relative density, as shown by Figure 4.10 for a definite 

set of processing conditions. Specifically, at the same mixing speed of 1500 

rpm, increasing the surfactant amount from 2 to 4 wt% increased the D50 nearly 

by 61% for samples produced using Tween 80, and about by 15% for samples 

produced using Triton X-100, while at the same time the relative density 

decreased by 20% and 28%, respectively. Also, the number of macropores 

increased further and the mean pore diameter also increased, causing the 

majority of pores to share pore edges and the interconnectivity to increase. 

This behavior is related to the increased foam volume obtained after 

stirring a slurry with 4 wt% of surfactant with respect to a slurry with 2 wt% of 

surfactant, processed at the same mixing speed. In this work, an increase in the 

volume of the wet foam on the order of 2 and 3 times with respectively 2 wt% 

and 4 wt% surfactant content was observed for both surfactants, regardless of 

the mixing speed. The volume of the wet foam is the first indication that the 

greater the volume obtained in the foam is, the greater the average pore size 

becomes [54]. 

Additionally, the data indicate (Figure 4.8 and 4.9) that Tween 80 

was more effective surfactant, as in all cases its use led to smaller cell sizes, 

indicating the more effective reduction in surface energy of the liquid/gas 

interfaces in the geopolymer foams, enabling to stabilize a large amount of 

bubble surfaces.

2000 rpm. (a) lowest magnification; (b) and (c) intermediate 

magnification in different regions; and (d) highest magnification. 

 

4.1.5 Specific surface area 

 

 The specific surface area of the geopolymer foams decreased with 

increasing the heat treatment temperature. Samples made with 2 wt% of Tween 

80, stirred at 1500 rpm and cured at 80 °C, had a specific surface area of 56.89 

m
2
/g, which decreased to 44.20 m

2
/g after heat treatment at 700 °C and to  

1.27 m
2
/g after heat treatment at 1200 °C, with a 98% decrease in SSA value. 

The decrease in specific surface area with an increase in calcination 

temperature was due to the loss of micro- and meso-pores present in the 

amorphous structure after geopolymerization, due to the transformation to a 



50 

 

crystalline phase with increasing temperature. Moreover, upon heating to  

1200 °C, the (partial) formation of a liquid phase occurred, when the 

geopolymer transformed into leucite (crystalline phase) embedded in fusible 

low-molecular poly(sialate) arising from the presence of non-stoichiometric 

contaminants [3]. 

 

4.1.6 Linear thermal shrinkage 

 

Figure 4.12 shows the linear shrinkage, which could be divided into 

four characteristic regions as function of the thermal treatment 

When temperature was lower than 100 °C (region I), the geopolymer 

foam kept approximately dimensionally stable as only free water from large 

pores and surfaces was lost in this stage. Shrinkage in region II (100–300 °C), 

region III (300–900 °C) and stage IV (900–1150 °C) were caused by capillary 

strain/dehydration, physical contraction during dehydroxilation/polymerization of 

Si–OH/Al-OH groups, and viscous sintering/crystallization, respectively. On 

heating to 1150 °C the shrinkage was fully completed and the overall linear 

shrinkage value was about 10.5%. 

 

 

Figure 4.12 Linear shrinkage of geopolymer foam as a function of temperature. 

 



51 

 

The effect of the thermal treatment on the open porosity of the 

geopolymer foams is shown also in Figure 4.13. We can observe that the open 

porosity decreased more significantly (maximum loss of ~24 vol% for samples 

produced using 4 wt% of surfactant) than the total porosity values, especially 

after heating at high temperature. The reduction in open porosity is related to 

the formation of a liquid phase which closes the spaces between the particles 

constituting the microstructure of the materials, as already mentioned.

4.1.7 TG/DTA analysis 

 

The TG/DTA analysis curve of the geopolymer (see Figure 4.14) 

shows that in the 25-300 °C range a weight loss associated with the loss of free 

water/dehydration [61, 62] occurred, while dehydroxilation/condensation of Si-

OH/Al-OH [61, 62] with a concurrent weight loss took place between 300 and 

500 °C. Also from Figure 4.14, it could be noted that in the 700-1000 °C range 

the phase change from amorphous to a metastable structure accompanied by 

densification occurred, and then finally, around 1180 °C, the stable crystalline 

phase formed, as suggested by the exothermic peak corresponding to the 

crystallization of leucite (predicted phase according Figure A.4) 

 

 

Figure 4.14 TG/DTA curve for a sample produced using surfactant Tween 80 

(2 wt % – 1500 rpm). 

 

Figure 4.15 shows the SEM micrographs of samples produced using 

Tween 80 (2 wt% - 1500 rpm) where it could be seen the effect of the 

temperature predicted and reported by the shrinkage and TG/DTA analysis, and 

consistent with the experimental results shown in Figures 4.12 and 4.14.

produced using Tween 80 as surfactant (2 wt% – 1500 rpm): (a) 

room temperature; (b) 700 °C; (c) 1200 °C. 

 

 Furthermore, another factor also evaluated by SEM (Figure 4.16) is 

regarding of the different surfactants and their effects on densification of struts, 

also responsible for the differences in the mechanical strength between the 

materials obtained.

different surfactants: (a) Tween 80; (b) Triton X-100, as prepared 

and dried. 

 

4.2 Gelcasting/saponification/peroxide combine route (GCSPCR) 

 

Figure 4.17 shows a comparison of the morphology of foams 

produced by: a) the saponification/peroxide/gelcasting combined route; b) the 

saponification route (stirring, only oil, no H2O2 addition), and c) the peroxide 

route (stirring, only H2O2, no oil addition). 



54 

 

 

Figure 4.17 SEM micrographs of geopolymer foams, as-prepared and dried, 

produced using different processing approaches: 

(a) saponification/peroxide/gelcasting combined route; (b) 

saponification route; (c) peroxide route.  

 

It could be noticed that the combined route (a) enabled the 

fabrication of foams with highly interconnected porosity and regular morphology 

(spherical cells), the saponification route (b) led to the formation of smaller cells, 

some with openings, while when using the peroxide route (c) larger but mainly 

closed cells were formed. Evidently, the in situ generation of a surfactant 

promoted the creation of cell windows (i.e. interconnections among cells), while 

the gas generated by the decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide allowed to 

increase the cell size. We should note that the cell size produced by a direct 

foaming process depends also on the viscosity of the slurry, which is affected 

by its composition. In particular, the introduction of oil and/or peroxide led to a 

decrease of viscosity with respect to the slurry in which only water was present. 

 Even within this context, and since this route is based on the in situ 

generation of a surfactant due the saponification reaction, the results presented 

here could be explained by the same mechanisms described when it was 

evaluated the gelcasting route. Likewise that was pointed out that different 

surfactants provides different properties to the geopolymer foams, due their 



55 

 

chemical structures, different sources of triglycerides also produce different 

surfactants, which implies in different geopolymer foams by this route. 

 

4.2.1 Total and open porosity 

 

 Figure 4.18 shows a similar range of starting total porosity but with a 

tiny change depending on type of oil, impacting on the porosity at the meso-

scale (a) and the effect of the heat treatment in (b). Differently of which was 

made for the GCR, for GCSPCR evaluation was not performed tests in samples 

not heat treated due their brittleness. 

This behavior could be explained by the effect of the temperature 

predicted and reported by the shrinkage and TG/DTA analysis, as presented 

and discussed in Figures 4.12 and 4.14. Besides that, Figure 4.18 (b) shows 

that even present a similar range of starting total porosity the effect of heat 

treatment is different among the triglyceride source, represented by the distinct 

gap between each temperature.

Figure 4.18 Effect of the type of triglyceride and temperature on the total 

porosity of the geopolymer foams. a) real values of the total 

porosity according the heat treatment of 300, 600, 900 and 

1200 °C and b) decrement values of the open porosity of each 

triglyceride source due the heat treatment in the same 

temperatures. 

 

 Figure 4.19 shows the effect of the triglyceride source and the 

temperature on the open porosity. 

 Here, it is important to note that the open porosity values at 600 °C, 

excepted for soybean biodiesel, are higher than at 300 °C, which means that 



57 

 

300 °C is a too low temperature to remove all organic compounds produced by 

this route. 

 Afresh, Figure 4.19 (b) shows the effect of the heat treatment on the 

open porosity where, as well on the total porosity, displays a different 

performance mainly at 900 and 1200 °C.

temperatures. 

 



58 

 

4.2.2 Mechanical strength 

 

 Regarding this feature, as shows Figure 4.20, could not be observed 

a major effect of the different chemical nature of surfactants, specifically at 300 

and 600 °C, which could be explained directly by the high value of total and 

open porosity of all samples, that has a more pronounced and significant effect 

than the type of triglyceride source itself (the type affect indirectly because it 

generates different porosities as seen in Figure 4.17)). The effect of the porosity 

on the strength is more evident at 1200 °C, where the sintering (densification), 

with consequent decrease of the total and open porosity, becomes responsible 

by the rise of this property. 

 For instance it could be noted that, for a heat treatment from 300 to 

1200 °C, an increase in ~ 80% for the sunflower oil (lowest) and ~ 900% for the 

soybean biodiesel (highest). 

 

Figure 4.20 Effect of the type of triglyceride and heat treatment on the 

mechanical strength of the geopolymer foams. 

 

 Besides that, another point which deserves some comments is the 

fact that the mechanical strength of soybean biodiesel is highest at 1200 °C, 

even the total porosity is of equal value at 300 °C. This behavior could be

explained by their largest cell size, which, due the effect of temperature 

increases the mechanical strength through the densification. 

 

4.2.3 Permeability 

 

 Concerning the air permeation behavior, the values of the 

permeability coefficients k1 (Darcian) and k2 (non-Darcian), in Forchheimer’s 

equation [35], fit well in a comprehensive permeability map, provided by 

Innocentini et al. [35], describing the behavior of porous components for 

filtration or adsorption applications (Figure 4.21). Foams from the peroxide route 

were the least permeable, behaving similarly to refractory bricks or porous 

ceramics produced using sacrificial fillers [46], foams from the saponification 

and gelcasting route had permeation typical for fibrous or granular filters [46] 

and foams from the combined route almost as permeable as foams produced 

from the replica technique [46]. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 4.21 Location of k1 and k2 data for geopolymer foams obtained by 

GCSPCR in a comprehensive permeability map [44]. 



60 

 

Moreover, it is worth noting that the saponification reaction reduced 

the pH of the geopolymer foam in contact with water. To obtain pH values of 

samples, geopolymers were ground and dispersed in distilled water (30 mg of 

grounded material into 150 ml of distilled water). In fact, pH measurements after 

extraction of glycerol in contact with distilled water for 12h resulted in a value of 

~8.0, which is much lower than the one obtained for a conventional geopolymer 

foam sample ~ 11.5), suggesting that, the repeated immersion in hot water to 

remove the glycol might have preferentially removed relatively water-soluble 

material when compared to the effect seen in a conventional geopolymer not 

submitted at this procedure. 

 

4.2.4 Morphological analysis 

 

 As predicted by the literature [40], and considering the type of lather 

formed (creamy, bubbly) and viscosity, this feature shows a strong influence of 

the triglyceride source. 

 Regarding this, Figure 4.22 shows pictures obtained by the different 

triglyceride sources and heat treated at 300 °C, where could be seen the effect 

of this parameter for bovine lard and palm stearin, those with the highest 

"creamy value" between the used sources (respectively 50 and 65), which 

implies in small cells and a narrow average cell size (Figure 4.23). Moreover, 

these two types of fat are solid at room temperature, which even firstly to add to 

the geopolymer slurry had melted in hot water (around 40 °C) to become liquid, 

begin to solidify again during mixing, which reduces the effect of hydrogen 

peroxide. 

 On the other hand, sources with the highest “bubbly value”, as 

coconut and castor oil, with values of 67 and 90 respectively, and even soybean 

biodiesel due its low viscosity, provides a large average cell size. It is 

noteworthy that for soybean biodiesel, a larger average cell size is favored by 

its low viscosity, which has as a consequence a more effectiveness of hydrogen 

peroxide in promote this increase in the cells size.

 Once again, these data are respectively showed in Figure 4.26 and

noted that all cell size distribution become narrower, due the shrinkage effect.

4.2.5 Specific surface area 

 

 Concerning the specific surface area, a comparative behavior 

between the triglycerides sources and also the effect of the temperature are 

shown in Figure 4.30. 

 

Figure 4.30 Effect of the type of triglyceride and temperature on the specific 

surface area of the geopolymer foams. a) real values of the 

specific surface area according the heat treatment of 300, 600, 

900 and 1200 °C and b) decrement values of the specific surface 

area of each triglyceride source due the heat treatment in the 

same temperatures. 

 



66 

 

 Analyzing Figure 4.30(a) it could be seen a different range of starting 

specific surface area, with an increase of ~ 44.0% when comparing bovine lard 

(35.5 m
2
.g

-1
) and olive oil (63.5 m

2
.g

-1
). It’s important to mention that specifically 

regarding this property, neither the features “bubbly” nor “cream” have a direct 

effect on the reached values for each triglyceride source. At this point it is worth 

noting that a possible explanation for this difference could be related to the 

amount of glycerol, among other organic soluble components, generated for 

each triglyceride source during the saponification reaction, which was 

subsequently extracted, leaving voids. However, one contrary point to this 

hypothesis is the soybean biodiesel, which during saponification does not 

generate glycerol, meanwhile appears as one of the sources which generated a 

porous geopolymer which presents the second highest initial specific surface 

area (59.7 m
2
.g

-1
). 

 Besides that, seeing Figure 4.30(b), is possible to see that up to  

900 °C, castor oil, sunflower oil and soybean biodiesel are be able to retains the 

specific surface area in ~16 m
2
.g-1, the highest values at this temperature, but 

there was not found a chemical characteristic in these triglyceride sources to 

explain this behavior. Also, taking account the chemical character of each oil, 

properties of “bubbly” and “cream” seem to not interfere directly on the develop 

of the specific surface area. 

 Already at 1200 °C the effect of sintering is preponderant in reducing 

the specific surface area, and practically there is no more adsorption, which is 

confirmed by the results. 

 

4.2.6 Linear thermal shrinkage and TG/DTA analysis 

 

As previously mentioned, for this processing route were considered 

the results obtained for gelcasting route. 

  



67 

 

5 CONCLUSIONS 

 

 Considering firstly the GCR was established that is possible to 

produce geopolymer using the geopolymerization reaction to stabilize the gas 

bubbles introduced in the liquid slurry by rotational mixing. Also, it was shown 

that the processing parameters affect the characteristics of the foams. In 

particular, with increasing mixing speed the average cell size and relative 

density decreased, while with increasing the amount of surfactant the average 

cell size and total porosity increased. The type of non-ionic surfactant affected 

the overall morphology of the foams (e.g.: total porosity and open porosity, and 

average cell size) reflecting directly in some physical properties such as 

mechanical strength and permeability. 

 The relation between some physical properties of geopolymer foams 

produced by gelcasting and their dependence of the processing parameters 

were confirmed. Concerning the permeation behavior, an increase of 1 to 3 

orders of magnitude of Darcian (k1) and non-Darcian (k2) coefficients as a result 

of the increase of open porosity with increasing amount of surfactant was 

observed. The compressive strength was inversely proportional to the total 

porosity. The addition of a higher amount of surfactant decreased the relative 

density of the foams and their strength. No statistically significant difference was 

observed for the addition of the two different surfactants for the permeability or 

the mechanical strength values. 

 By using this approach, it was possible to produce foams with a total 

pore volume as high as ~80 vol.%, with an amount of open porosity as high as 

~60 vol.%. 

 Furthermore, another new approach (GCSPCR) for the production of 

highly porous, open cell geopolymer foams with relatively high specific surface 

area (~ 65 m
2
.g

-1
) was developed. Due the saponification reaction, the in situ 

formation of surfactant molecule is able to create more cell windows, increasing 

the permeability in comparison to a simple and commonly peroxide route. By 

this route it was possible to produce foams with a total pore volume as high as 

~88 vol.%, with an amount of open porosity as high as ~80 vol.%. 



68 

 

 The variation of the source of triglycerides (type of oil) has a direct 

influence on some physical properties of porous geopolymers, expanding the 

potential application in several new fields, including filtration and adsorption 

applications. However, it was not possible to observe any influence of this 

variation on the permeation behavior. 

 For both routes, the heat treatment decreased the total porosity and 

the specific surface area, especially at the highest temperature (~1200 °C), 

because of the shrinkage, crystallization and (partial) viscous flow occurring in 

the geopolymer material. 

All results, especially for the pH analysis to the GCSPCR indicate 

that these geopolymer foams with hierarchical porosity could be employed in 

water filtration applications for human consumption. 

 These results, as well as the advantage of using a sustainable and 

low cost manufacturing process, encourages additional efforts to optimize the 

use of gelcasting and the gelcasting/saponification/peroxide combined route to 

produce open cell geopolymer foams. 

  



69 

 

6 SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE WORKS 

 

 To the Gelcasting Route evaluate the influence of different 

surfactants and the amount of them, and also the effect of curing process (time 

and temperature) and heat treatment on the physical properties of geopolymer 

foams. 

 To the Gelcasting/Saponification/Peroxide Combined Route, explore 

different additions and different triglycerides sources; evaluate the effect of heat 

treatment and the possible addition of a third component, such as a pore 

forming agent and fibers, to increase the mechanical strength. 

 Preliminary study of pore forming agent addition showed an increase 

of 35% of the specific surface area, in some cases for values of 85 m
2

APENDIX A 

 

Firstly, all raw materials were characterized, as shown below, in 

order to know its behavior when applied to the geopolimerization reaction. 

 

? X-ray fluorescence (XRF); 

? X-ray difratometry (XRD); 

? Real density (helium picnometer); 

? Specific surface area (BET). 

 

X-ray fluorescence (XRF) 

 

 The chemical analysis of the precursors was made by XRF, using a 

spectrometer PW 2404 (Philips, Netherland) at Saint-Gobain laboratory in 

Vinhedo (Brazil).

X-ray difratometry (XRD) 

 

 At this point of the work, this technique was used mainly to evaluate 

the amorphous character of precursors, since this property is relevant to 

geopolymerization reaction. For this test was used a Diffractometer D5000 

(Siemens, DE) with 40 kV and 40 mA in a sealed Cu source.

 Phases were identified by DIFFRACplus – EVA software (JCPDS 

database) and are showed as follows.

Based on the results, and respecting the molar ratios previously 

cited, were prepared different compositions changing the type and amount of 

precursors and activators. 

One example of this composition with the stoichiometry calculation is 

shown as follows. 

 

Stoichiometry calculation 

 

Considering the formulation below, and using the data previously 

reported to the precursors and activators we considered the stoichiometric 

calculation: 

 

52.50 g MSMK (70 wt%) 
    Precursors 
22.50 g FA (30 wt%) 
 

70.00 g potassium silicate  
    Activators 
20.00 g potassium hydroxide (15 M) 
 

To prepare a KOH 15M solution: 

 

MM (KOH): 56 

710 g H2O + 840 g KOH    (A.1) 

1550 g solution ? 840 g KOH    (A.2) 

20.00 g solution ? x = 10.84 g KOH   (A.3) 

20.00 g solution ? x = 9.16 g H2O   (A.4) 



83 

 

To express the amount of K2O into KOH: 

 

KOH ? K2O+H2O    (A.5) 

2*56 ? x+18    (A.6) 

  x = 47    (A.7) 

 

56.00 g KOH ? 47.00 g K2O  (A.8) 

10.84 g KOH ? x = 9.10 g K2O  (A.9) 

 

For the potassium silicate, according the technical data sheet: 

100.00 g silicate ? 26.48 g SiO2                        (A.10) 

70.00 g silicate ? x = 18.54 g SiO2                        (A.11) 

 

100.00 g silicate ? 12.75 g K2O                (A.12) 

70.00 g silicate ? x = 8.93 g K2O                (A.13) 

 

100.00 g silicate ? 60.60 g H2O                (A.14) 

70.00 g silicate ? x = 42.42 g H2O                (A.15) 

 

So, for the suggested composition, Table A.6 shows the amount of 

each oxide and also the amount of water.

Potassium silicate 18.54  8.93 42.42 

Total 58.21 23.15 19.39 51.58 

 

Using this information, it’s possible to calculate the oxide molar ratios:

Furthermore, based on the amount and respective percentage of 

oxides in the geopolymer composition, as reported in Table A.5, and using the 

phase equilibrium diagram (Figure A.4) of the these majoritarian oxides (SiO2, 

Al2O3 and K2O) is possible to predict the phase which should be formed due 

geopolymerization reaction.

geopolymer composition where the green line represents the SiO2, 

red line represents the Al2O3 and blue line represents the K2O and 

their intersection sets the composition according Table A.5 

 

Beyond that, this composition was evaluated by XRD (Figure A.5) to 

confirm the statement proposed about phase formation by the 

geopolymerization reaction.

Figure A.5 XRD pattern of the untreated geopolymer composition. 

 

This composition was taken as an example of the stoichiometry 

involved in the process due to present the best results concerning the 

mechanical strength and thermal stability, one of the goals of this work and that 

will be presented in the follow. 

Moreover, for the other compositions were also adopted the same 

concept of stoichiometric calculation. 

 

Methodology of previously investigations 

 

In order to evaluate the influence of raw materials on the mechanical 

and thermal properties of the geopolymer, always applying the same oxide 

molar ratios, were prepared different compositions, listed in Table A.6.

precursors (metakaolin: type and amount) and activators (type of 

based alkaline solution).

  Basically, the first step adopted to make the geopolymer, following 

the oxide molar ratio calculation, was the preparation of a 15 M NaOH and 

KOH, which should be used after 24 hours [32]. Then, a solution of the 

activators, comprising the hydroxide solution and respective silicate 

(NAOH/sodium silicate; KOH/potassium silicate) were prepared in a mechanical 

stirrer (500 rpm, 30 minutes). Then, metakaolin and fly ash were then added 

respectively in this sequence at room temperature to the activator solution, 

stirring at 1000 rpm for 30 minutes after each addition. 

Thereafter, the geopolymer was cast in polystyrene to form the 

samples to the mechanical strength test and in a cone-shaped paper mold to 

form the samples to the thermal stability test. Then, all molds were placed in an 

oven for 60 minutes at 80 ºC after sealing it into a plastic bag. The samples 

were then removed from the plastic bag and left at 80 °C for further 4 hours, 

being placed at room temperature for 96 hours, up to perform the tests.

Mechanical Strength 

 

 The compressive strength of the as prepared samples was 

determined using a universal testing machine Hounsfield (8746, England). At 

least 5 specimens per composition were tested. 

Results are reported in Figure A.6, where it could be noticed, as 

quoted by Davidovits [1, 3], the amorphous character of the precursors has a 

significant role in this feature, increasing their tendency to combine chemically 

in the presence of an alkaline solution, thereby conferring better results to 

MSMK compositions when compared with those made with HPMK.

and type of alkali based solution. 

 

This information could be confirmed when compared the amorphous 

character of HPMK (Figure A.1) and MSMK (Figure A.2) by the diffractograms 

analysis.

Thermal stability 

 

 Samples (cones) were heat treated in a Lindberg Blue CF56724C 

furnace, whereas similar firing curves: heating rate of 5 °C/min., landing time of 

5 min. and cooling rate of 10 °C/min. for an empirical evaluation of the thermal 

stability and how this property could be affected by different precursors and 

activators.
