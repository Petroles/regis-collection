resumo 
 
 

A presente tese resulta de um trabalho de investigação com o propósito de
aumentar o conhecimento do comportamento ao fogo de elementos metálicos
com secção transversal de Classe 4, ou seja, suscetíveis à ocorrência de
fenómenos de encurvadura local. 
Os elementos metálicos com secção transversal de Classe 4 são amplamente
utilizados na construção metálica por serem soluções bastante atrativas em
termos de eficiência e economia de material. No entanto, a verificação da
resistência ao fogo destes elementos carece de fórmulas simplificadas que se
adequem à mais-valia proporcionada por este tipo de solução. 
O principal objetivo desta dissertação foca-se no desenvolvimento de
metodologias de cálculo para verificação da resistência ao fogo de elementos
metálicos com secção transversal de Classe 4 com base em estudos
numéricos realizados com elementos finitos de casca recorrendo ao programa
SAFIR através de análises material e geometricamente não lineares (GMNIA -
geometrically and material non-linear analysis with imperfections). 
É demonstrado nesta tese que, as fórmulas atualmente propostas no
Eurocódigo 3 para verificação da resistência ao fogo de elementos de Classe 4
em situação de incêndio podem ser melhoradas. 
No que diz respeito à capacidade resistente da secção transversal, a
metodologia atual do Eurocódigo 3 subestima a resistência das secções
quando constituídas simultaneamente por placas de Classe 4 e de outras
classes. Por outro lado, mostra-se que os fenómenos de encurvadura local
afetam também as secções de Classe 3 a altas temperaturas. Neste trabalho,
ambas as classes foram tratadas como secções transversais esbeltas, tendo
sido propostas novas fórmulas para o seu cálculo em situação de incêndio. 
No caso de vigas com secção transversal esbelta, observa-se que as
formulações preconizadas no Eurocódigo 3 são também inadequadas. A
proposta para o cálculo da resistência da secção transversal desenvolvida
neste trabalho conduz a melhorias na verificação da segurança ao fogo destes
elementos mas, não obstante, propõe-se novas expressões que consideram a
interação entre a encurvadura local e o fenómeno de encurvadura lateral que
ocorre nestas vigas. Assim desenvolveu-se um parâmetro de secção efetiva
cuja utilização permite uma verificação ao fogo da encurvadura lateral mais
eficiente. 
Por fim, estudam-se as vigas-coluna com secção transversal esbelta,
concluindo-se que as fórmulas de interação do Eurocódigo 3 conduzem
simultaneamente a resultados muito conservativos ou fora da segurança.
Observou-se que este comportamento se deve essencialmente ao cálculo dos
fatores de redução para o comportamento de coluna e viga, mas por outro
lado, houve a necessidade de alterar os fatores de interação das curvas para
que a verificação da resistência ao fogo destes elementos fosse mais segura.

abstract 
 

This thesis is the result of a research work with the purpose of increasing the
knowledge on the fire behaviour of steel members with Class 4 cross-section,
that is, prone to the occurrence of local buckling phenomena. 
Steel members with Class 4 cross-section due to their advantages regarding
their lightness and efficiency are widely used in steel constructions. However,
the verification of the fire resistance of these elements lacks simplified formulas
that are in agreement with the added value provided by this type of solutions. 
The main objective of this thesis aims to develop improved structural fire design
rules for the stability check of steel members with Class 4 cross-section based
on numerical investigation with shell finite elements carried out with the
software SAFIR by performing geometrically and material non-linear analysis
with imperfections (GMNIA). 
It is demonstrated in this work that, the existing design rules preconized
proposed in Eurocode 3 for the design of steel members with Class 4 cross-
section in case of fire could be improved. 
In what concerns the cross-sectional capacity, the present methodology of
Eurocode 3 underestimates the resistance of the sections when they are built
up simultaneous of Class 4 plates and plates of other classes. Moreover, it is
demonstrated that local buckling affects also Class 3 cross-sections in case of
fire. Thus, in this work, both classes are treated as slender cross-sections and
proposals are made for new rules to calculate their capacity in fire situation. 
For beams with slender cross-sections, it is concluded that the formulae
available in Eurocode 3 are also inadequate. The new proposal for the cross-
sectional resistance calculation leads to improvements in terms of the fire
design of these members but, nonetheless, new expressions are proposed that
account for the interaction between local buckling and lateral-torsional buckling
that occurs in these beams. Accordingly, the effective section factor was
developed allowing a better design against lateral-torsional buckling of on
beams with slender cross-sections in case of fire. 
Finally, beam-columns with slender cross-sections are studied, and it is 
concluded that the present interaction formulae provided by Eurocode 3 leads 
simultaneous to very conservative or unsafe results. It was observed that this 
was mainly due to the calculation of the reduction factors for the beam and 
column behaviour, but besides that, there was the need to change the 
interaction factors so that the design rules to assess the mechanical resistance 
of beam-columns in case of fire be safer.

Chapter 1. Introduction

1.1 Background and motivation 

Steel members with H or I shape Class 4 cross-sections are widely used in steel constructions 

due to their advantages regarding their lightness and efficiency. In terms of its design in case 

of fire, the Eurocode 3 Part 1-2 [1.1] provides simple calculation rules for the determination 

of the mechanical resistance. However, according to recent numerical investigations [1.2], 

these rules for Class 4 members with H and I shape proved to be not very accurate and too 

conservative. The main reason for that lies in the fact that these rules were developed for 

Class 1 or 2 members in case of fire and its accuracy for the fire design of Class 4 members 

still needs to be checked or improvements of those rules can still be developed. 

Nevertheless, some recommendations are given for the fire design of Class 4 cross-sections 

in the informative Annex E of Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 in order to account for local buckling. 

In this annex, it is suggested that the design yield strength of steel should be taken as the 

0.2% proof strength instead of the stress at 2% total strain as for the other classes design and 

that the effective cross-section be determined as for normal temperature, that is with the 

properties at normal temperature. However, as mentioned before, it has been demonstrated 

through numerical investigations [1.2], that this methodology is conservative and leads to 

uneconomical results. Moreover, the fire regulations of certain European countries have a 

fire resistance requirement of 15 minutes under ISO fire condition for buildings with large 

spans (for example, industrial halls) where Class 4 steel members are mostly used [1.3].  

Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 suggests a default critical temperature of 350 ºC if no fire design is 

made, which means that even for a requirement of 15 minutes of fire resistance, passive fire 

protection must be used. The use of such prescriptive rules should be replaced with much 

more realistic fire design rules to allow real fire safety engineering. 

Some studies have been done previously within the scope of one research project [1.4], for 

welded or hot-rolled Class 4 steel members. This type of study is very limited and cover 

only, for example, the buckling of Class 4 steel columns [1.5–1.8] or is related to other types 

of steel, for example stainless steels [1.9], for which the constitutive laws differ from carbon 

steel. Thus, more studies must be carried out and practical and precise design rules be 

developed.

1.2 Objectives and Research Programme 

The main objective of this thesis is to study and to develop simple rules for fire design of 

steel members with Class 4 cross-sections, in particular for beams and beam-columns as 

close as possible to the principles of design rules of Eurocode 3 at room temperature. 

The influence of local buckling (see Figures 1.1-1.2) on the capacity of the members is 

investigated and addressed. For that purpose, the work has been divided according to the 

scale of the elements by its increasing dimension or complexity: thin plates, cross-sections, 

beams and finally beam-columns, which are analysed separately and constitute the subject 

of chapter’s two to five. Columns have not been incorporated in this work since this thesis 

was developed within the scope of the EU research project FIDESC4 being this particular 

subject addressed by other project partners. Albeit the author did not contribute directly to 

this study, the contributions highlighted in this thesis regarding the calculation of thin-plates 

and the cross-section capacity together with the existing formulae of the Eurocode 3  

Part 1-2 demonstrated to be sufficient to address the resistance of the columns with slender 

cross-sections in case of fire.

Figure 1.2: Local and global buckling on a beam-column tested at elevated temperatures carried 
out at University of Liège [1.3]. 

More particularly, the study of thin-plates in case of fire has the objective of studying the 

influence of local buckling on the reduction of the plate capacity at high temperature and, 

thus, to determine if the existing rules to calculate the effective width of the plates at normal 

temperature can be used under fire situation and adapt those rules as necessary to account 

for the effect of the temperature. Following, the study is directed to the cross-section 

behaviour in case of fire. The objective is to study cross-sections prone to local buckling at 

elevated temperature and establish a methodology to assess its capacity under fire situation. 

For the resistance of members with Class 4 cross-sections, this thesis addresses beams and 

beams-columns. For the first, the accuracy of existing design rules of Eurocode 3 is 

identified. The influence of local buckling in the response of laterally unrestrained steel 

beams against lateral-torsional buckling is study in order to develop more accurate design 

rules. Secondly, the determination of the accuracy of existing interaction curve of Eurocode 

3 to the fire design of steel beam-columns in case of fire is investigated so that the accuracy 

is established and more accurate design rules are developed. 

To accomplish these objectives, first a literature review is made. However, the subject of 

this thesis has not been addressed by many researchers in the past and therefore the existing 

literature is noticeably scarce. After, a numerical investigation is performed to assess the 

validity of existing design rules and to serve as the basis of the development of new rules. 

GMNIA (geometrical and material non-linear analysis with imperfections) analyses are 

carried out with the finite element software SAFIR [1.10] using shell finite elements. The 

definition of the numerical model, namely the material model, the boundary conditions, the 

geometric and material imperfections and the model for the application of the loads is made

according to the literature. The validation of the numerical model is based on reference 

results (both numerical and experimental) found in the literature and on the fire tests 

developed within the European Research Project FIDESC4 “Fire Design of Steel Members 

with Welded or Hot-Rolled Class 4 Cross-Section” as this thesis is under the scope of that 

project. Finally, new rules are developed and validated against numerical and experimental 

results available. 

1.3 Outline of the Thesis 

This thesis is organized into six chapters describing the research conducted in this PhD 

thesis. A first introductory chapter is followed by four chapters with the subject addressed 

within each of which increases in scale gradually: Chapter 2 presents a study at elevated 

temperatures on the thin plates that form slender cross-section, followed by the study of the 

capacity of slender cross-sections under fire situation (Chapter 3), and then, on a member 

level by the study of the beams (Chapter 4) and finally the study of the beam-columns 

(Chapter 5). General conclusions and final remarks are presented in the last chapter of this 

work. The organization of each chapter is presented next in more detail. 

The first chapter serves as the introduction to the thematic addressed in this work. The 

purpose, meaning and objectives are highlighted, as well as brief description of the research 

programmed that was followed in order to accomplish those objectives. In the final part, the 

outline and organization of the thesis is detailed. 

The second chapter corresponds to the study of individual thin steel plates that form the 

slender cross-sections and how local buckling influences its capacity at elevated 

temperature. A revision on the existing literature to account for the effect of local buckling 

at elevated temperature is presented and the methods to design against local buckling in fire 

are presented. This last sentence can be rewritten as stating that the design methods for Class 

4 cross-sections in fire are also presented. In this sense, the design provisions against local 

buckling of the Eurocode 3 are highlighted: firstly the cross-section classification and then 

the effective width method as given in Part 1-5 of the Eurocode 3 [1.11] both at normal and 

the respective nuances at elevated temperatures. This is followed by the description of the 

numerical model used in this chapter as well as its validation based on experimental results

available in the literature. The aim is to study at high temperature the capacity of simply 

supported internal and outstand thin-plates, that correspond respectively to the web and the 

flange of H or I shaped cross-sections and compare the results with the design provisions of 

the Eurocode 3. Outstand plates (flange) are analysed under compression while internal 

plates (web) are studied both in compression and in bending. The comparison of the results 

with Eurocode 3 philosophy uncover its inconsistencies and the need to have a better 

methodology to calculate the resistance against local buckling in case of fire. Therefore, an 

effective width method to better account with the unfavourable effect of local buckling in 

case of fire, based on a shell finite element numerical investigation, is defined and new 

expressions to calculate the plate effective width are presented following the same principles 

as the ones existing at normal temperature. The method presented in this part of the work is 

used in Chapter 3 as the basis of a methodology to calculate the resistance of slender cross-

sections. 

The third chapter is reserved for the study of H and I shaped slender cross-sections where 

local buckling has a predominant role in the ultimate capacity at elevated temperatures, 

several cross-sections submitted to compression or bending about the major-axis are 

investigated. In the begin of the chapter, the bibliography available on the subject is revisited, 

some duplication exists with the literature review made in Chapter 2, due to the scarce 

existence of studies within the scope of this thesis. Next, the Eurocode 3 design provisions 

to take local buckling into account in the cross-sectional resistance are highlighted. The new 

proposal developed in Chapter 2 is again revisited and a simplification of the initial proposal 

is also presented followed by a summary of the simplified methods to calculate the cross-

sectional resistance at elevated temperatures. The numerical model used to determine the 

capacity of the cross-sections is presented next, with the focus on the definition of material 

properties, support conditions, loading model and the geometric and material imperfections. 

The numerical study on several cross-sections with different web height and flange width 

and respective thickness is presented. The objective is to cover different groups of cross-

section classifications which are then submitted to pure compression and also to bending 

about the major-axis. The results are compared with the existing methodology of Eurocode 

3 and also with the new proposed methodology showing the inconsistencies of the Eurocode 

method and the improvements of the new proposal also supported by the statistical

investigation presented. The chapter is closed with a comparison with experimental results 

found in the literature. 

The fourth chapter presents the study on the lateral-torsional buckling of beams with 

slender cross-sections. The chapter begins with a literature review about the current design 

methods against lateral-torsional buckling in case of fire, with the focus on Part 1-2 of 

Eurocode 3. The numerical model used to perform the numerical investigation is then 

described: the mesh, the boundary conditions, the material model, the geometric and material 

imperfections (residual stresses) and some considerations on how the loads are applied to 

the model. After a comparison between the results of the numerical investigation and the 

existing beam design curve of Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 is made. The aim is to demonstrate 

that the current provisions of Eurocode 3 are unreliable for slender cross-sections mainly 

due to influence of local buckling not being satisfactorily taken into account. The 

methodology presented in Chapter 3 is then used to calculate the capacity of the cross-

sections and to analyse the accuracy of the existing beam design curve, and although 

improvements are observed, it is noticeable the need of an improved design curve against 

lateral-torsional buckling for beams with slender cross-sections in case of fire. For the 

purpose of developing new design curves against lateral-torsional buckling, a parametric 

study is presented where the influence of several parameters on the resistance of laterally 

unrestrained steel beams is investigated. Based on the results of the parametric study a 

proposal for a new design curve is made for beams with slender cross-sections in case of fire 

that allows for a better prediction of the influence of local buckling and, thus, leads to an 

improved yet safe design method when compared to the results of the finite element analysis. 

In the end of the chapter it is also demonstrated that the new proposal could be used together 

with a factor (factor “f”, but limited to f t 0.8) to account for the non-uniform bending 

diagrams. The chapter ends with a statistical investigation that support the withdrawn 

conclusions. 

A fifth chapter related to the study of beam-columns with Class 4 cross-section has been 

included. The chapter starts with a literature review on the topic of beam-columns in case of 

fire, with special attention on how the existing interaction curve of Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 

was established which was developed for Class 1 and 2 cross-sections. The interaction curve 

for the design of beam-columns with Class 4 cross-sections is then presented by making the

necessary modifications to account for the effective area and effective section modulus to 

the existing expressions on the Eurocode 3. This is followed by the description of the 

numerical study: first the numerical model is presented followed by the geometric and 

material imperfections and the definition of the cases studied. The different cross-sections 

and loading distributions cases are highlighted. Results of the numerical investigation are 

then presented for two situations, namely in-plane buckling representing the buckling about 

the major-axis of the cross-section and the out-of-plane buckling representing the buckling 

about the minor-axis of the cross-section. The aim is to establish the safety level of the 

current design formulation. The inconsistencies of the existing design formulae are pointed 

out and rely mainly on the fact that the reduction factors for the column case and for the 

beam case, on which the interaction formulae is dependent, are not accurate enough. For 

each buckling direction, the calibration of the interaction factors is also presented and the 

improvements to the original proposal of Eurocode 3 Part 1-2 are highlighted. This study is 

complemented with a statistical investigation that is performed in the final part of the chapter 

and the formulation of the interaction curve accounting to the developments of this thesis. 

The final chapter, the sixth chapter, presents the general conclusions for the present work 

as well as a critical review and thoughts on future developments.

Abstract In this chapter, the local buckling of thin steel plates exposed to fire is investigated using 

a shell finite element model. The reduction of strength and stiffness that occurs at elevated 

temperatures needs to be taken into account in the design, as it increases the susceptibility to local 

buckling of the plates thus affecting their load carrying capacity. The obtained results show that the 

current design method of Eurocode 3 to take into consideration the local buckling in the calculation 

of the ultimate strength of steel thin plates at elevated temperatures needs to be improved. These 

methods are based on the same principles as for normal temperature but using for the design yield 

strength of steel, at elevated temperatures, the 0.2% proof strength of the steel instead of its strength 

at 2% total strain as for the cases where the local buckling is not limiting the ultimate strength of the 

plates. This consideration, however, leads to an inconsistency if cross-sections are composed 

simultaneous of plates susceptible and not to local buckling. To address this issue, new expressions 

for calculating the effective width of internal compressed elements (webs) and outstand elements 

(flanges) are proposed, which have been derived from the actual expressions of the Part 1-5 of the 

Eurocode 3 and validated against numerical results. It is also demonstrated that it is not necessary to 

use for the yield stress at elevated temperatures the 0.2% proof strength of the steel instead of the 

yield stress at 2% total strain, given that the necessary allowances are considered in these new 

expressions, thus leading to a more economic design.

2.1 Introduction 

In steel construction, the engineering challenge of having the most economic structural 

elements demands the use of slender cross-sections. Moreover, cross-sections can be 

considered as an assembly of plates which are often referred as internal (webs) and outstand 

(flange) elements and if these plates are thin, with an high width-to-thickness ratio, they may 

buckle when submitted to compression preventing the attainment of the yield stress in one 

or more parts of the cross-section, thus affecting the ultimate load bearing capacity of the 

structural members. According to Eurocode 3 [2.1], this type of cross-sections where local 

buckling governs the ultimate limit state are classified as being of Class 4 and their design 

rules at normal temperature are well established. Under fire conditions, however, the recent 

investigations of Fontana and Knobloch [2.2], Renaud and Zhao [2.3] and Quiel and Garlock 

[2.4] have shown that the existing design rules are too conservative for Class 4 cross-sections 

and hence the need to have more realistic formulae to account for the local buckling at 

elevated temperatures, mainly because consistency between the rules at normal temperature 

and in fire situation has prevailed. 

At normal temperature, the Eurocode 3 gives in its Part 1-5 [2.5] two methods to account for 

the effects of local buckling in the design, namely the effective width method and the reduced 

stress method. At elevated temperatures, the same concepts are used, and in the informative 

Annex E of the Part 1-2 of the Eurocode 3 [2.6] some recommendations are given for the 

fire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-sections. In this annex, it is suggested to use 

the simple calculation methods with the design value for the steel yield strength as the 0.2% 

proof strength instead of the strength at 2% total strain as normally done in the fire design 

of the other cross-sectional classes. In addition, it is stated that the effective cross-section 

can be determined with the effective width method as for normal temperature, i.e. the 

effective widths of the different elements that constitute the cross-section are determined on 

the basis of the material properties at normal temperature. The early work of Ranby [2.7] 

has demonstrated that this methodology is safe and leads to accurate results for determining 

the ultimate load of plates susceptible to local buckling at elevated temperatures. 

Nevertheless, it must be noted that, if a cross-section is built up of plates of which some are 

with and others are without local buckling, using the 0.2% proof strength of steel as the 

design strength underestimates the cross-sectional resistance. Take, for example, an element

16 

submitted to pure bending about the major-axis with a regular I-shaped cross-section with 

Class 1 or 2 flanges and Class 4 web, and therefore the overall cross-section classification is 

Class 4. Since the cross-section is Class 4, the designer is forced to use the 0.2% proof stress 

as the design yield strength, even for the flanges that are classified as Class 1 (or 2). This is 

very much conservative because in these type of cross-sections it is usual that around 80% 

of the bending resistance is provided by the flanges that will have no local buckling 

problems, in that case. 

The limits of the width-to-thickness ratio from which the plates are susceptible to local 

buckling at normal temperature are defined in the Eurocode 3 Part 1-1. Under fire conditions 

these limits are the same as for normal temperature but the value 0.85 235 / yfH   is used 

instead of 235 / yfH  . Using a reduced value of H   in fire situation can lead to a higher 

classification but prevents that classification changes for each temperature, as it will be 

justified in the next section. It worth be mentioned that on this subject, Renaud and Zhao 

[2.3] point out that it would be more consistent to classify the cross-sections as for normal 

temperature, instead of those recommendations, since the square root of the reduction factors 

for the steel strength 0.2 ,pk T  and for the Young modulus ,Ek T  at elevated temperatures is close 

to one, in accordance with the recommendation of calculating the effective cross-section to 

be used at elevated temperatures on the basis of the material properties at normal 

temperature. On the other hand, the experimental results of Ala-Outinen and Myllymäki 

[2.8] and Yang et al. [2.9–2.11], show that local buckling occurs even for cross-sections with 

plates that are classified as Class 1 or Class 2 for temperatures above 500ºC.  

Quiel and Garlock [2.4] calculated the buckling strength of steel plates exposed to fire and 

proposed new expressions for calculating the effective widths and account for the local 

buckling, however, these expressions are codified in a more similar manner to North 

American standards than to the Eurocodes and the effect of the steel grade has not been taken 

into account. Fontana and Knobloch [2.2] have developed a strain-based approach for 

calculating ultimate strength of steel plates at elevated temperatures and expressions to 

calculate the effective cross-section, however those expressions vary for various ranges of 

strain at each increment of temperature and are only for outstand elements. Both works show 



 

 

Chapter 2. Plates

that an improved method is needed in order to obtain a more realistic cross-sectional 

resistance at elevated temperatures taking into account the local buckling. 

In this chapter, a parametric study with the help of the finite element method (FEM) software 

SAFIR [2.12] has been performed to assess the ultimate strength of steel plates with different 

support conditions and load patterns at elevated temperatures. Comparisons of the numerical 

results with the existing formulae demonstrate the need of new expressions to determine the 

effective width of the steel plates at elevated temperatures which have been derived 

accordingly and are herein presented. The necessary allowances for the local buckling is 

taken into account in the determination of the effective width of the plates and as a result 

using these new expressions it is not necessary to use the 0.2% proof strength of steel at 

elevated temperatures and therefore the yield stress at a total strain of 2% can be used to 

calculate the resistance of Class 4 cross-sections. 

2.2 Actual design provisions of Eurocode 3 to take into account local 
buckling 

2.2.1 Effective width method 

Thin plates when submitted to in-plane compressive stresses may buckle. The stress 

distribution on a plate after buckling is clearly non-linear as shown in Figure 2.1, with lower 

values on the central part and maximum stresses at the edges of the plate equal to the yield 

stress yf .

The effective width method originally developed by von Karman [2.13] and then adapted by 

Winter [2.14] to account for the influence of the geometrical imperfections and the residual 

stresses, translates this concept into a “fictitious plate” with an effective width of effb  and a 

uniform stress distribution equal to the yield stress, as shown in Figure 2.2.

2.2.2 Cross-section classification 

2.2.2.1 At normal temperature 

Albeit the scope of this work is to study the local buckling in steel plates at elevated 

temperatures, it is important to mention the limits defined in Part 1-1 of Eurocode 3 [2.1] 

regarding the four different classes of the cross-sections concerning the resistance and 

rotation capacity as a function of the local buckling resistance of their elementary plates. The 

limit width-to-thickness ratio (b/t), i.e. the plate slenderness, for a steel plate to belong to a 

certain class is shown in Table 2.1, where at normal temperature for carbon steel, substituting 

210000 MPaE   in equation (2.5), the parameter H  is defined by: 

 235 yfH   with yf  in MPa. (2.6)

In case of fire, the cross-section classification follows the same procedure and width-to-

thickness limits as for normal temperature, but as the Young’s modulus and the yield strength 

are dependent of the temperature equation (2.5) must be used instead of equation (2.6), 

resulting for carbon steel in [2.17]:

The advantage of using this simplification as opposed to the temperature dependent 

classification model is that it prevents changes of a cross-sectional classification for each 

temperature. In this work the classification of the plates is referred also in terms of the non-

dimensional slenderness limits and these values are given in Table 2.2 for normal 

temperature and elevated temperatures.

conservative and some further guidance is given in the Annex E for the fire design of this 

type of cross-sections. According to this annex, when using simple design models the same 

principles apply as for the other cross-section classes but effective cross-sections properties 

need to be determined based on the material properties at normal temperature. For Class 4 

cross-sections, it is suggested to use the simple calculation methods with the design value 

for the steel yield strength as the 0.2% proof strength instead of the stress at 2% total strain 

as for the other classes. 

In fact, at elevated temperatures, the reduction factor for plate buckling would be, according

This methodology however, has the disadvantage of underestimating the cross-sectional 

resistance if only some of the plates of the cross-section are susceptible to local buckling. In 

this case, using the 0.2% proof strength for the whole cross-section is, thus, very limiting, as 

already mentioned. 

The reduction factors for the mechanical properties of carbon steel at elevated temperatures 

according to Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 are shown in Figure 2.4. There is an inconsistency 

pointed out by Renaud and Zhao [2.3] regarding the reduction factors for the 0.2% proof 

strength at elevated temperatures, 0.2 ,pk T , since these values are not calculated according to 

the stress-strain relationship of steel at elevated temperatures, and it is unknown to the author 

where the values given in the Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 come from (see in Figure 2.4). In this 

study the values of 0.2 ,pk T  used are those calculated according to the stress-strain relationship 

of carbon steel at elevated temperatures for the case of the steel grade S355, as adopted in 

the French National Annex of the Eurocode. 

2.3 Numerical study of plates 

2.3.1 Numerical model 

To calculate the ultimate strength of rectangular plates (a × b with a&gt;b) the FEM software 

SAFIR [2.12] has been used. The plates were discretized into several quadrangular shell 

elements with four nodes and six degrees of freedom (3 translations and 3 rotations). These 

shell elements adopt the Kirchoff’s theory formulation with a total co-rotational description 

and have been previously validated by Talamona and Franssen [2.16]. The steel material law 

is a two-dimensional constitutive relation with the von Mises yield surface according to the 

non-linear stress-strain formulae of the Eurocode 3 and the respective reduction factors at 

elevated temperatures ( ,yk T , ,pk T  and ,Ek T ) as plotted in Figure 2.4. The integration on the 

shell element follows a Gauss scheme with 2 × 2 points on the surface and 4 points through 

the thickness.

24 

A mesh density study has been performed and the solution converged for rectangular plates 

with the dimensions of a=1.6 m and b=0.4 m using 80 elements along the length a and 20 

elements along the width b. These dimensions and mesh have been adopted in this study (see 

Figure 2.5). 

 
Figure 2.5: Example of the numerical model used to calculate the ultimate strength of a simply-

supported plate in 3 sides – outstand element. 

The boundary conditions taken into consideration as a restraint to the vertical displacements 

(Uz) and rotations (Ry on edge a and Rx on edge b) on the plate edges, displacements in the 

plane of the plate were also restrained (Ux and Uy). Loads were applied to the model as forces 

and a layer of shells with increased thickness was used on the edges of the plate to avoid 

numerical problems. The numerical model used to calculate the ultimate strength of a 

simply-supported plate on 3 sides is shown in Figure 2.5. 

Geometrical imperfections were introduced into the model by modifying the nodal 

coordinates. The shape for the geometrical imperfections was considered as the first 

eigenmode of a linear buckling analysis and the amplitude of the imperfections has been 

considered as 80% of b/50 for plates corresponding to the flanges and 80% of b/100 for 

plates corresponding to the webs, following the recommendations of Part 1-5 of the 

Eurocode to use 80% of the fabrication tolerances as given in [2.17]. A procedure written in 

Cast3M [2.18] has been used to obtain the eigenmodes [2.19]. Residual stresses at normal 

temperature affect the ultimate strength of the plates but at elevated temperatures have a 

negligible effect on resistance of the plates because a relaxation of initial residual stresses is 

likely to occur due to an increase of the steel temperature [2.4]. In this study, the residual

2.3.1.1 Validation of the numerical model with experimental results 

In this section, validation of the numerical model is made by comparing the predicted results 

with the experimental results by other researchers at both normal and elevated temperatures. 

At present, few studies exist on the ultimate strength of compressed thin-plate steel sections 

exposed to fire. Tests by Pauli et al. [2.23] focus on the investigation of the local buckling 

behaviour and cross-sectional resistance of heated steel members at elevated temperatures 

on stub columns of square and rectangular hollow sections (internal elements in 

compression). Yang et al. [2.10] carried out experimental investigations on the buckling 

strength of wide-flanged steel sections with local flange buckling (outstand elements in 

compression) at elevated temperatures. On the scope of the European Research Project 

FIDESC4 [2.24], Hricák et al. [2.25] tested two laterally restrained steel beams with Class 

4 cross-sections heated at two different temperatures. More recently, Wang et al. [2.26] also 

carried out experiments to investigate the local buckling behaviour of H stub columns at 

elevated temperatures. In Tables 2.3 and 2.4, the section dimensions, the steel yield strength 

at normal temperature and the results obtained in the experiments for the specimens of each 

study and predicted with numerical models are compared for different temperatures. A

Figure 2.8: Comparison between the results predicted by the Eurocode 3 and the experimental 

results of other authors [2.10, 2.23, 2.25, 2.26]. 

A total of 28 different results were analysed, both at normal temperature (5 cases) and at 

elevated temperatures (23 cases). Results show a good correlation between the experimental 

results and the results calculated with SAFIR. At normal temperature, the differences 

between the numerical model and the experimental results are small except for two test 

results where 8% and 11% difference was obtained although on the safe side. At elevated 

temperatures, the predicted results were mainly conservative. Only four of the cases show 

significant differences (more than 10% on the unsafe side) but they refer to tests where the 

specimens were heated at more than 600ºC and where it is more difficult to control the tests 

for such temperature levels. Nevertheless, the numerical model used in this study has proven 

to be capable of predicting the local buckling influence on the ultimate strength of cross-

sections at normal and elevated temperature.

the Eurocode 3 given by equation (2.3), in this figure the notation “+R” means that residual 

stresses have been considered. It is also evident the influence of the residual stresses on the

results by reducing the plate ultimate strength and therefore need to be taken into account at 

normal temperature, this aspect is highlighted in the Figure 2.10.  

 
Figure 2.10: Influence of the residual stresses in the ultimate strength of a simply supported plate 

in 3 sides (outstand element) under compression at normal temperature. 

The so-called post-buckling behaviour is also noticeable given that the numerical results are 

above the elastic buckling curve (Euler) for non-dimensional slenderness higher than 

1.25pO | . 

The ultimate strength of an internal element (web) under compression for various steel 

grades is shown in Figure 2.11 for hot-rolled and welded residual stress patterns. It worth 

mention that the discontinuity that exists in the Eurocode 3 (EC3) curve in this figure is due 

to the fact that the plate buckling resistance starts to decrease for 0.673pO    

(see Equation (2.2)) but the Class 4 limit is set at 0.739pO   (see Table 2.2).

The numerical analyses for internal elements under compression show that there is some 

difference in the results. A possible explanation for this fact is that the design curves were 

obtained on the basis of experimental results of different cross-sections and the geometrical

imperfections were not as severe as the ones considered in this study, in the Figure 2.12 it is 

exemplified the use of a less severe geometrical imperfection.  

 
Figure 2.12: Ultimate strength of a plate simply supported in 4 sides (internal element) under 

compression at normal temperature using a less severe geometrical imperfection. 

In this case the maximum displacement of the eigenmodes has been scaled to an arbitrary 

value of b/400 instead of the 80% of b/100, i.e. b/125, used in the remaining cases as 

recommend in the EN1993-1-5. From this figure it can be seen that there is a better 

agreement between the numerical results and the design curve of the Eurocode 3 when 

considering residual stresses with the pattern of the Hot-Rolled profiles of Figure 2.6 and a 

lower value for the geometrical imperfections. In this study the recommendations of 

EN1993-1-5 for the geometrical imperfections were followed. 

The influence of the residual stress pattern in the ultimate load bearing capacity of internal 

elements under compression is shown in Figure 2.13 and it can be seen that considering hot-

rolled residual stresses pattern has almost no influence in the ultimate strength of the internal 

plate, while for welded residual stresses pattern has a considerable influence.

where ,pl RdM , ,el RdM  and ,eff RdM  are the plastic bending resistance, elastic bending 

resistance and the effective bending resistance respectively for a plate, a discontinuous curve 

is presented in these figures. At 0.893pO   there is also a small discontinuity in the EC3 

curve due to the fact that in Equation (2.3) the plate buckling resistance starts to decrease at 

0.748pO  . 

From Figure 2.15 it can be seen that numerical results are close to the design curve provided 

by the Eurocode 3 for plates classified as Class 4 ( 0.893pO ! ) and that for the remaining 

classes the numerical results show that the transition from Class 1 to Class 3 is naturally 

more smoother than the design curve predicts, being the Eurocode non-conservative for a 

certain range of small values of slenderness. 

In Figure 2.16 the influence of the residual stresses is shown. It can be seen that the influence 

of the residual stresses in the ultimate strength of plates submitted to bending is small.

2.3.3 Results at elevated temperatures 

2.3.3.1 Elements under compression 

At elevated temperatures, the equations (2.2) and (2.3) to calculate the reduction factor for 

the plate buckling need to be adapted to account for the transition that occurs when passing 

from Class 3 to Class 4 elements, since at this point ( , 0.629p p TO O   for internal elements 

and , 0.639p p TO O   for outstand elements, see Table 2.2) the steel yield strength to be 

considered equals to the 0.2% proof strength instead of the strength at 2% total strain, leading 

to a discontinuity in the formulation and, additionally, to the appearance of a plateau because 

the reduction factor for the plate buckling only starts to decrease at higher values of the non-

dimensional slenderness, for instance, in compression ( 1\  ) for internal elements 

0.5 0.085 0.055 0.673pO \ ? ?   and 0.748pO   for outstand elements. Therefore, the 

reduction factor for the plate buckling at elevated temperatures can be written, for internal 

elements under compression as:

d) 700°C 

Figure 2.18: Ultimate strength of a plate simply supported in 4 sides (internal element) at elevated 

temperatures under compression. 

For outstand elements under compression, it can be observed that at elevated temperatures 

the steel grade has some influence on the ultimate strength of the plates, while at normal 

temperature this is not the case (see Figure 2.9), mainly because at elevated temperatures the 

stress-strain diagram of steel is non-linear and at normal temperature a bi-linear stress-strain 

diagram is used. It can be seen that there is a good agreement for the plates classified as 

Class 4 at elevated temperatures ( , 0.639p p TO O t ) and for steel grade S460 but the 

Eurocode 3 gives higher values for plates with lower non-dimensional slenderness and for 

different steel grades, being considerably un-conservative for the non-dimensional 

slenderness lower than , 0.639p p TO O ? . 

For internal plates under compression, it is observed that the numerical results obtained are 

below the design curve of the Eurocode 3, meaning that it is not on the safe side, as it is also 

observed at normal temperature and also justified by the more severe geometrical 

imperfections used in this study. Nevertheless the differences in this case are greater than at 

normal temperature, as expected, since the design curve adopted at elevated temperatures is 

the same as at normal temperature, where additional post-critical reserve has been taken into 

account as mentioned in section §2.3.2.1, however at elevated temperatures the reduction of 

stiffness and strength that occurs due to the thermal effects, is not accounted for, therefore 

bigger differences exist between the two situations. In both cases, it can be seen that the steel

grade has some influence in the ultimate plate strength and this has not been taken into 

account in the design curve of the Eurocode 3. It is also noticeable, from Figure 2.17 and 

Figure 2.18 that the post-critical resistance decrease at elevated temperature compared with 

the behaviour at normal temperature. 

At elevated temperatures, as mentioned before, the residual stresses have little or no 

influence in the plate ultimate strength. In Figure 2.19 this is observed with the comparison 

of the numerical results obtained with and without residual stresses. Therefore in this study 

the residual stresses have not been taken into account at elevated temperatures.

compression at elevated temperature for steel grade S355.

( , 0.759p p TO O ! ), however, this curve fails to predict the ultimate bending resistance of 

plates with non-dimensional slenderness values lower than this Class 4 limit. Being non-

non-dimensional slenderness ( 2.0)pO ! | . As mentioned before, there is also some 

influence of the steel grade on the plate ultimate strength of the plates. 

Again it is possible to see a plateau in the EC3 curve since the reduction factor for the plate 

buckling resistance only starts to decrease for internal elements in bending for 0.874pO   

(see equation (2.2)). 

2.4 New proposal 

From the results obtained in the last section it is clear that a new design method to take into 

account the ultimate plate strength at elevated temperatures is needed. A new proposal for a 

design curve that better fits the numerical results obtained has been developed. This design 

curve has been calibrated as close as possible to the existing design curve of the Eurocode 3 

by introducing the factors TD  and TE  on the expressions of Part 1-5 of Eurocode 3 (see 

equations (2.5) and (2.6)), hence the influence of the imperfections is taken into account as 

in the original formulas developed by Winter and additionally the non-linear steel 

constitutive law at elevated temperatures is also accounted for, furthermore by using the 

factor TH  (see Table 2.5) steel grade is also taken into account in this new proposal.

This proposal is intended to be used only for cross-sections with a classification of Class 3 

or Class 4. This proposal has also the advantage of taking the necessary allowances in order 

to use the strength at 2% total strain instead of the 0.2% proof strength, leading to much 

more economic cross-sections.

regarding the actual existing design curves of the Eurocode 3. For steel temperatures below 

350°C this curve is very conservative, however these are very low temperatures and elements 

with such critical temperatures are not expected to be common in fire design.

( 0.598pO ? ) the results are still non-conservative and the same behaviour is observed at 

normal temperature (see Figure 2.15). This question however has not been addressed in this 

study. 

2.5 Conclusions 

Local buckling is a major concern when designing slender cross-sections. The existing 

design rules for taking into account local buckling and calculate the ultimate strength of steel 

plates at elevated temperatures have proven to be misleading and new expressions have been 

developed. On the basis of a numerical parametric study of several steel plates at elevated 

temperatures, considering different support conditions, loading cases and steel grades, it was 

possible to compare the results with the existing design curves for the ultimate plate strength 

and to calibrate new expressions for internal and outstand elements that have a better 

correlation with the obtained results. At normal temperature, the comparison of the 

numerical results with the existing design curves for calculating the ultimate strength of the 

steel plates according to Eurocode 3 shows that there is good agreement between them. It 

was also possible to conclude that the residual stresses influence the ultimate strength 

capacity of the plates at normal temperature while at elevated temperatures their effect is 

negligible. Concerning the steel grade, it was observed that the influence at elevated 

temperatures is more meaningful than at normal temperature. Due to the considerable 

reduction of strength and stiffness that occurs in the fire exposed plates, the post-critical 

resistance is also limited, but both the Eurocode design rules and the new proposal made 

within this study have a good agreement with the results for plates with high non-

dimensional slenderness where this behaviour is more important. 

At elevated temperatures, for the plates where local buckling needs to be taken into account 

in the determination of the cross-sectional resistance, the existing design rules of  

Eurocode 3 show good agreement with the obtained numerical results. For plates with lower 

non-dimensional slenderness, especially in the range of Class 3, the Eurocode 3 however 

fails to predict the ultimate strength of these plates and may lead to overestimation of the 

cross-sectional resistance, by using the new proposal in this study this limitation is corrected. 

On the other hand, using these new expressions to calculate the effective width of the plates 

and consequently the effective cross-section properties leads to a more realistic design. 



 

 

Chapter 2. Plates 

55 

Accordingly, the necessary allowances for local buckling have been taken into account 

considering the strength at a total strain of 2% instead of using the 0.2% proof strength as 

recommended in the Annex E of Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3. This overcomes the limitation of 

Eurocode 3 that assumes that every plate will buckle, when the cross-sections is classified 

as Class 4. 

The new expressions are temperature dependant leading to a variation on the effective cross-

section properties under fire situation and although the method herein proposed can be 

implemented with relatively ease of computational effort if compared with the actual design 

rules, it was also demonstrated that a simplified proposal can be used instead by considering 

a constant steel temperature of 700ºa CT  . It worth be mentioned that this simplification 

can lead to over conservative results for steel temperatures of 250ºa CT d , however these 

are very low temperatures and elements with such critical temperatures are not commonly 

used with respect to the usual degree of utilization of the elements.

Abstract In this chapter, the resistance of slender I-shaped cross-sections, where local buckling has 

a predominant role in the ultimate capacity, is investigated at elevated temperatures. A numerical 

study considering several cross-sections submitted to compression or bending about the major-axis 

is performed using a finite element analysis software. The results are compared with the existing 

formulae available in Part 1-2 of the Eurocode 3 showing that they need to be improved. For Class 3 

cross-sections, it is observed that the existing rules lead to unsafe results because local buckling 

occurs at elevated temperatures prior to the development of the elastic bending resistance or the gross 

cross-section compression resistance. For Class 4 cross-sections, the results show that these rules are 

not adequate because it is recommended for the design yield strength of steel the use of the 0.2% 

proof strength even if the cross-section has plates not prone to local buckling. A new methodology 

to account for the local buckling in steel I-sections at elevated temperatures is presented based on the 

expressions developed in the previous chapter to calculate the effective width of thin plates at 

elevated temperatures. According to this new methodology, an effective cross-section is calculated 

for Class 3 and Class 4 cross-sections and the yield strength at 2% total strain is used for Class 4 

cross-sections as recommended by the Eurocode 3 for the other section classes. Finally, it is 

demonstrated that this methodology leads to good results when compared against numerical and 

experimental results.

3.1 Introduction 

Slender cross-sections when submitted to compression stresses are prone to local buckling 

that prevents the attainment of the yield stress in the compressed parts of the cross-section 

thus affecting their ultimate capacity. At normal temperature, according to Eurocode 3 [3.1] 

these cross-sections are classified as Class 4 – the highest class – and Part 1-5 [3.2] provides 

two methods to take local buckling into account, namely the effective width method that 

leads to a reduced cross-section and the reduced stress method. 

At elevated temperatures, Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 [3.3] suggests for Class 4 cross-sections a 

default critical temperature of 350 ºC if no fire design is made, which means that even for a 

requirement of 15 minutes of fire resistance, passive fire protection should normally be used 

for current profiles. Alternatively, the informative Annex E of Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 

suggests the use of a reduced cross-section calculated with the effective width method using 

the steel properties at normal temperature and for the design yield strength of steel the 0.2% 

proof strength (f0.2p,T, see Figure 3.1). 

 
Figure 3.1: Stress-strain relationship for carbon steel at elevated temperatures [3.4]. 

Previous investigations of Fontana and Knobloch [3.5], Renaud and Zhao [3.6] and Quiel 

and Garlock [3.7] demonstrated that this methodology is too conservative. Hence, the need 

of more realistic formulae to account for the local buckling at elevated temperatures. Studies 

have been done previously within the scope of one research project [3.8], for welded or hot-

rolled Class 4 steel members. However, these type of studies are limited and cover only, for 

example, the buckling of Class 4 steel columns [3.5, 3.9–3.11] or are related to other types 

of steel, for example stainless steels [3.12], for which the constitutive laws differ from carbon 

steel. In Figure 3.2, an example of column showing local buckling from a test performed at 

elevated temperatures at the University of Liège is shown. 

 
Figure 3.2: Example of column showing local buckling from a test performed at elevated 

temperatures at the University of Liège (taken from[3.13]). 

In this work, a parametric investigation based on the finite element analysis using the 

software SAFIR [3.14] is made to assess the resistance of several slender cross-sections in 

bending and compression. In line with previous investigations by other authors, the obtained 

results show that the existing formulae of Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 could be improved. For 

Class 3 cross-sections, it is observed that the existing rules lead to unsafe results because 

local buckling occurs at elevated temperatures prior to the development of the elastic 

bending resistance or the gross cross-section compression resistance. For Class 4 cross-

sections, the results obtained show that the use of the 0.2% proof strength as the design yield 

strength for the whole cross-section is very conservative, especially if they contain also 

plates with inferior classes, i.e. without local buckling.  



 

 

Chapter 3. Cross-sections 

63 

To overcome these inconsistencies and limitations, a new methodology to calculate the 

cross-sectional resistance of slender cross-sections at elevated temperatures is presented in 

this work. Accordingly, an effective cross-section is calculated for Class 3 and Class 4 cross-

sections based on the expressions developed in the previous chapter to calculate the effective 

width of thin plates at elevated temperatures [3.15] and the yield strength at 2% total strain 

is used for Class 4 as recommended in Eurocode 3 for the other section classes. A 

comparison of the predicted cross-sectional capacity using the proposed methodology 

against numerical and experimental results shows the considerable advantages as well as the 

validity and accuracy of this proposal. 

3.2 Design provisions to take local buckling into account in the cross-
sectional resistance according to Eurocode 3 

I-shaped cross-sections can be considered as an assembly of plates often referred as internal 

(webs) and outstand (flanges) elements. If the width-to-thickness ratios of these plates are 

high, they are normally referred to as slender and may buckle when submitted to 

compression, preventing the attainment of the yield strength in one or more parts of the 

cross-section, thus reducing the resistance of the cross-section and consequently the load 

bearing capacity of the structural members. To account for this phenomenon, the cross-

section is classified as a function of the width-to-thickness ratio of its plates and this issue is 

addressed in subsection 3.2.1. In order to consider local buckling in the design, a reduced 

cross-section can be used, this method being referred in the literature as the effective width 

method. The rules to calculate effective width of plates are indicated in Part 1-5 [3.2] and 

are described in subsection 3.2.2. The code provisions to take local buckling into account at 

elevated temperatures are presented in subsection 2.3. In the section 3.3, the expressions 

developed in Chapter 2 to calculate the effective width of thin plates at elevated 

temperatures, which are used later in this study, are presented. 

3.2.1 Cross-section classification 

In Eurocode 3, four classes (Classes 1 to 4) of cross-sections are defined in respect to how 

the local buckling affects the load bearing capacity of the members, with a higher class 

denoting a higher influence of the local buckling on resistance. According to the definition

64 

of Eurocode 3, Class 1 cross-sections are those that can form a plastic hinge with the rotation 

capacity required from plastic analysis without reduction of the resistance. Class 2 cross-

sections are those that can develop their plastic moment resistance, but have limited rotation 

capacity because of local buckling. Class 3 cross-sections are those in which the stress in the 

extreme compression fibre of the steel member assuming an elastic distribution of stresses 

can reach the yield strength, but local buckling is liable to prevent development of the plastic 

moment resistance. Finally, Class 4 cross-sections are those in which local buckling will 

occur before the attainment of yield strength in one or more parts of the cross-section. Cross-

section classification is illustrated in Figure 3.3 for a beam submitted to a point load at mid 

span. 

 
Figure 3.3: Moment-rotation curves for different cross-section classification (adapted from [3.4]). 

The limits for each class, are defined in Part 1-1 of Eurocode 3 [3.1] in terms of the width-

to-thickness ratio (b/t), also referred as the plate slenderness. For a steel plate to belong to a 

determined class, the slenderness limit is shown in Table 3. 1, where at normal temperature 

for carbon steel the parameter  is defined by: 

 235 / yfH   with yf  in MPa. (3.1) 

The cross-section overall classification is then given by the plate with higher class.

At elevated temperatures, the cross-section classification follows the same procedure and 

the same width-to-thickness limits as for normal temperature, but the Young’s modulus and 

the yield strength are dependent on the temperature. For carbon steel the parameter at 

elevated temperatures is given by [3.4] (see equation (3.6)).

The ratio , ,E yk kT T  is plotted in Figure 3.4 as a function of the temperature. Eurocode 3 

recommends that the ratio , ,E yk kT T  be replaced by a constant value of 0.85, which is a 

kind of a mean value of that ratio as shown in Figure 3.4.

With this simplification, the cross-sectional classification is independent of the temperature.  

On this subject, Renaud and Zhao [3.6] point out that it would be more consistent to classify 

the cross-sections as for normal temperature, instead of using those recommendations, since 

the square root of the reduction factors for the steel strength using the 0.2% proof strength 

0.2 ,pk T  and for the Young modulus ,Ek T  at elevated temperatures is close to one as shown in 

Figure 3.4. This would be more in accordance with the recommendation given in Annex E 

of Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 regarding Class 4 cross-sections at elevated temperatures. But, on 

the other hand, the experimental results of Ala-Outinen and Myllymäki [3.16], Yang et al. 

[3.17–3.19] and more recently of Correia and Rodrigues [3.20], show that local buckling 

occurs even for cross-sections with plates with inferior classes (Class 1 - Class 3) for elevated 

temperatures. This suggests that is advisable to use a smaller value of the parameter H , i.e. 

0.85 235 / yfH   instead of 235 / yfH  . Despite its importance, investigation on the 

classification of cross-sections at elevated temperatures is out of the scope of this study and 

the present guidelines of Eurocode 3 on this matter are followed.

3.2.2 The effective width method from Eurocode 3 

The first expressions to calculate the effective width of simply supported plates, and the 

concept itself, were originally developed by von Karman [3.21] and then adapted by Winter 

[3.22] to account for the influence of the geometrical imperfections and the residual stresses 

on the decrease of the load bearing capacity of the plates. Similar expressions, are included 

in Part 1-5 of Eurocode 3, which gives the reduction factor for the plate buckling resistance 

for internal elements under compression as [3.23]

Figure 3.5: Plate reduction factor for internal and outstand elements. 

3.2.3 Code provisions for local buckling at elevated temperatures 

As mentioned previously, to account for local buckling at elevated temperatures, Part 1-2 of 

Eurocode 3, suggests for Class 4 cross-sections a default critical temperature of 350ºC if no 

other calculation is made, which normally is conservative. Additionally some further 

guidance is given in Annex E for the fire design of this type of cross-sections. It is stated 

that i) the effective cross-section be determined with the effective width method as for 

normal temperature, i.e. using the material properties at normal temperature and (ii) to use 

the simple calculation methods with the design value for the steel yield strength as the 0.2% 

proof strength ( 0.2 p,f T ) instead of the stress at 2% total strain ( y,f T ), as normally used in the 

fire design of other cross-sectional classes. These recommendations are based essentially on 

the early work of Ranby [3.24] who has demonstrated that this methodology is safe, and 

leads to accurate results for determining the ultimate load of thin plates susceptible to local 

buckling at elevated temperatures. In fact, at elevated temperatures, the reduction factor for

The ratio 0.2 , ,/p Ek kT T  is almost equal to 1.0 as shown in Figure 3.4, and since ,p pTO O# , 

equations (3.3) and (3.4) show that it can be considered TU U . However, this is an 

inconsistent approach. If under an arbitrary loading, a cross-section has Class 4 plates 

(elements) and other plates with inferior classes, using a reduced stress to calculate the 

ultimate load capacity of every plate leads to unrealistic results. Take, for example, an 

element submitted to pure bending about the major-axis with a regular I-shaped cross-section 

with Class 1 or 2 flanges and Class 4 web. In this case using the 0.2% proof strength in the 

whole section due to the web classification is very restrictive because in these types of cross-

sections it is usual that around 80% of the bending resistance is provided by the flanges that 

will have no local buckling problems. This is exemplified further in this study, but one can 

refer to Figure 3.19 where the moment-rotation curve for a beam in bending is shown for a 

cross-section with Class 2 flanges and Class 4 web, for the different temperatures the results 

of the finite element analysis are more than 20% above the ultimate capacity predicted by 

Eurocode 3. 

On the other hand, there is an inconsistency pointed out by Renaud and Zhao in [3.6] 

regarding the reduction factors for the 0.2% proof strength at elevated temperatures, 0.2 ,pk T , 

given in the Table E.1 of Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3. These values do not correspond to the ones 

calculated according to the stress-strain relationship of steel at elevated temperatures given 

in the same norm, and it is unknown to the author where the values given in the Part 1-2 of 

Eurocode 3 come from. The values of 0.2 ,pk T  that are used in this study correspond to the 

ones that are calculated according to the stress-strain relationship of carbon steel at elevated 

temperatures for the case of the steel grade S355, as adopted in the French National Annex 

of Eurocode 3.

3.3 New proposal to calculate the effective width at elevated temperatures 

Due to the limitations aforementioned, new expressions for the plate reduction factor ( U ) 

have been developed in Chapter 2 (see also [3.15]) in order to replace the use of the design 

yield strength corresponding to the 0.2% proof strength ( 0.2 p,f T ) with the stress for 2% total 

strain ( y,f T ). The proposed design curves have been calibrated using a format as closer as 

possible to the existing design curve of Eurocode 3 by introducing the factors TD  and TE  on 

the expressions of Part 1-5 of Eurocode 3 (see equations (3.3) and (3.4)). 

According to this proposal, for internal compression elements the following expression is 

proposed in Chapter 2:

A simplified proposal is investigated in this study based on the assumption that the influence 

of the temperature on the range of the critical temperatures usually expectable for steel 

members (from 350ºC to 750ºC) are negligible (see Figure 3.6 and Figure 3.7), leading to a 

simpler yet accurate design. According to this simplified proposal for internal compression

3.4 Simple design methods to calculate the cross-sectional resistance at 
elevated temperatures 

According to Eurocode 3, the compression resistance of a cross-section can be determined 

at elevated temperatures using clause 4.2.3.2 of Part 1-2 assuming that no flexural buckling 

will occur. Additionally, if the cross-section is classified as Class 4, clause 4.2.3.6 of  

Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 applies, and an effective cross-section area ( effA ) must be calculated 

as mentioned in subsection 2.3 of this chapter. In Table 3.3, the summary of the Eurocode 3 

methodology to calculate the cross-sectional resistance is given where A  and effA  refer to 

the gross and effective cross-section areas respectively. In this table, M , fiJ  is the safety factor 

for the fire situation.

According to the new proposed methodology to assess the cross-sectional compression 

capacity at elevated temperatures (see Table 3.3), an effective cross-section is calculated for 

Class 3 and Class 4 using equations (3.8) and (3.9) for the “Full Proposal” and  

equations (3.10) and (3.11) for the “Simple Proposal”, given in section 3.3. Accordingly, the

3.5 Numerical model 

In this section, the numerical model used to investigate the accuracy of the proposed 

methodologies to calculate the ultimate capacity of slender cross-sections at elevated 

temperatures is presented. For the numerical models, geometric and material non-linear 

analyses with imperfections (GMNIA) with shell finite elements were used. The finite 

element model was implemented using the software SAFIR, which has been developed 

specifically for the analysis of structures in case of fire [3.14]. The capability of SAFIR to 

model local buckling with shell elements was validated by Talamona and Franssen [3.25]. 

The members were discretized into several quadrangular shell elements with four nodes and 

six degrees of freedom (3 translations and 3 rotations). The SAFIR shell elements adopt the 

Kirchoff’s theory formulation with a total co-rotational description. The steel material law 

is a two-dimensional constitutive relation with the von Mises yield surface according to the 

non-linear stress-strain formulae of Eurocode 3 and the respective reduction factors at 

elevated temperatures. The integration on the shell element follows a Gauss scheme  

with 2 × 2 points on the surface and 4 points through the thickness. The temperature has 

been considered uniform along the cross-section so that a comparison between the numerical 

results and the simple design equations is possible. The cross-sectional resistance at elevated 

temperatures was determined by firstly increasing the temperature to the desired value and 

then applying an increasing load until the failure is reached. A mesh sensitivity study has 

been performed and the solution converged for the members discretized into 100 divisions 

on the length, 10 divisions on the flange width and 22 divisions of the web height. 

Additionally, for the cases where the ratio between the flange width and the web height is 

close to one the divisions on the flange width were doubled. The length of the members was 

set as 10 times the web height. The numerical model has been validated against experimental 

results in a previous work [3.15] (see Chapter 2). 

3.5.1 Material properties 

S235, S355 and S460 steel grades were considered in the numerical investigations, with a 

yield strength at normal temperature of 235 MPa, 355 MPa and 460 MPa respectively, a 

modulus of elasticity of 210 GPa at normal temperature and a Poisson’s ratio of 0.3.

3.5.2 Support conditions 

Single span members were considered with the boundary conditions defined in order to 

determine the axial compression resistance and flexural bending resistance about the major-

axis. For compression members, fully-fixed supports were considered in one end and free in 

the other, the displacements were also restrained in the transversal direction (Uy) and vertical 

direction (Uz) in the intersection of the web with the flange as illustrated in Figure 3.8. For 

members in bending about the major-axis, fork-supports were considered in both ends 

restraining the transversal displacements (Uy) along the web and restraining the vertical 

displacements (Uz) in the lower flange. Additionally, the transversal displacements (Uy) 

were also restrained in the upper flange in this case.

3.5.3 Loading 

The loads were modelled by applying distributed loads (by means of nodal forces) on the 

flanges and on the web as indicated in Figure 3.9 for each loading case. To avoid numerical 

problems, an additional layer of shell elements with higher thickness was used in the 

extremities of the structural elements to apply the loads that correspond to the applied end 

moments or the axial compression force.

3.5.4 Imperfections 

In terms of geometrical imperfections, the recommendations of Part 1-5 of Eurocode 3 [3.2] 

were followed. The geometrical imperfections were introduced in the models by scaling the 

first eigenmode with an amplitude corresponding to 80 % of the geometric fabrication 

tolerances given in the EN 1090-2 [3.26]. Accordingly, the amplitude was considered as 

b/100 where b is the web height or the flange width depending on the location of the most 

displaced node of the eigenmode. Additionally, if the maximum displaced node was in the 

web, an amplitude of at least 4 mm was considered, as recommended in the norm. For both 

models, the residual stresses were not considered because their effect at elevated 

temperatures is negligible in the ultimate cross-sectional resistance [3.15]. 

3.6 Numerical study 

An extensive numerical study was conducted to investigate the ultimate capacity of several 

I-shaped cross-sections under compression and bending about the major-axis when exposed 

to fire. The numerical model described in section 3.5 was used. The cross-sections that were 

used in this numerical study are described in subsection 3.6.1. The steel grades S235, S355 

and S460 were considered. The temperatures chosen were 350, 450, 550 and 700ºC and 

considered constant in the whole cross-section to allow direct comparison with the simplified 

design methods. The results obtained are presented in subsection 3.6.2 and it is demonstrated 

that the existing methodology of Eurocode 3 to predict the ultimate capacity of cross-sections 

prone to local buckling when exposed to elevated temperatures needs to be improved. On 

the other hand, the comparison of the results with the methodologies proposed in this chapter 



 

 

Fire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section 

78 

demonstrates their validity and improvements towards a better prediction of the cross-

sectional capacity at elevated temperatures. This conclusion is also supported by the 

statistical investigation presented in subsection 3.6.3. 

3.6.1 Cross-sections 

In this section, the definition and classification of cross-sections used in the numerical study 

are indicated. The cross-sections were defined in order to have a large set of results and to 

cover different cases of cross-section classification (see Subsection 3.2.1). A total of 324 

cross-sections submitted to compression and 376 cross-sections submitted to bending about 

major-axis with different width-to-thickness ratios of their plates were investigated. The 

choice of the cross-section dimensions was based on the ones used in current practice as well 

as extreme geometries in order to cover a wider scope of application. The web height (hw) 

was defined as 450, 634, 817 and 1000 mm for the compression cases and 450, 1000 

and 2000 mm for the bending cases. The flange width (bf) was defined as 150, 157, 184, 200 

and 450 mm for the compression cases and as 150, 300 and 420 mm for the bending cases. 

For the compression cases, the thickness of the web (tw) and flanges (tf) was chosen in order 

to cover the ranges of Class 2, Class 3 and Class 4 and for the bending cases to cover  

Class 3 and Class 4 and the frontier between these two classification limits. Finally, the 

different configurations of web and flange geometries were combined in order to have cross-

sections classified as Class 3 and Class 4 with various combinations of flange and web 

classifications. Figures 3.10 – 3.11 show the different combinations of the cross-sections 

used in this parametric study.

3.6.2 Results and comparison to simple design methods 

Herein, the results obtained for the cross-section resistance with Finite Element Analysis 

(FEA) are compared with the simple design methods defined in Section 3.4 for elements in 

compression and bending about the major axis. It is demonstrated that the actual 

methodology of EN1993-1-2 needs to be improved and that the methods provided in this 

chapter lead to accurate and safer prediction of the cross-sectional resistance. 

3.6.2.1 Elements in compression 

In Figure 3.13, the results obtained with FEA are compared with the simplified design 

methods of EN1993-1-2, through the ratio between the resistance obtained with FEA  

( , ,fi Rd FEAN ) and with simplified methods of EN1993-1-2 ( , , EC 3fi RdN ) calculated according to 

Table 3.3. A value higher than 1.0 means that the resistance predicted by the EN1993-1-2 is 

higher than that obtained with FEA and therefore the results are unsafe. A value less than 

1.0 means the results are safe when compared to the numerical results.

Figure 3.13: Cross-sectional resistance of Class 3 and Class 4 members submitted to compression 

at elevated temperatures. Comparison between FEA and Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3. 

It is shown that for Class 3 profiles the current simple design methods of Part 1-2 of 

Eurocode 3 give higher resistance than the obtained numerically (results are unsafe) while 

for Class 4 the predicted capacity is less than those obtained numerically (results are 

conservative). For Class 3 members, observation of the failure mode shows that local 

buckling occurs preventing the cross-section to reach the full resistance. This is exemplified 

in Figure 3.14 for a Class 3 profile (I450×18+450×30, steel grade S460), where it can be 

seen the deformed shape at collapse where local buckling in the web and in the flanges is 

evident.

grade S460) at 450ºC. 

Although it can be argued that the classification limits could be changed at elevated 

temperatures in order to classify these cross-sections as Class 4, results obtained for Class 4 

cross-sections are also not satisfactory, therefore this possibility was not addressed in this 

study. This is supported by Figure 3.13 where it is clear that the resistance of Class 4 cross-

sections is underestimated, especially if they have plates with an inferior class (see, for 

instance, the data points of 1-4 cases, representing Class 1 flanges and Class 4 web). In these 

cases, local buckling is unlikely to happen in the non-Class 4 plates but their additional 

reserve of resistance is not considered because of the use of the 0.2% proof strength as the 

design yield stress. This is reinforced by Figure 3.15, where is shown that the deformed 

shape at collapse for a Class 4 cross-section with Class 1 flanges and in this case local 

buckling in the flanges was not observed.

Fire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section 

84 

Results show that the Full Proposal is an accurate methodology to estimate the cross-

sectional resistance since a better agreement with the FEA numerical investigation is 

obtained. 

The validity of using the Simple Proposal (see Table 3.3) was also investigated and 

compared to the FEA results. Figure 3.17 shows that, using the Simple Proposal leads also 

to safe, yet accurate results, although slightly on the safer side than the Full Proposal as 

expectable.

at elevated temperatures. Comparison between FEA and the Simple Proposal. 

3.6.2.2 Elements in bending about the major-axis 

In Figure 3.18, the results obtained with FEA are compared with the simplified design 

methods of EN1993-1-2, through the ratio between the bending resistance obtained with 

FEA ( , ,fi Rd FEAM ) and with simplified methods of EN1993-1-2 ( , , EC 3fi RdM ) calculated 

according to Table 3.4. A value higher than 1.0 means that the resistance predicted by the 

EN1993-1-2 is higher than that obtained with FEA and therefore the results are unsafe, a 

value less than 1.0 means the results are safe.

Chapter 3. Cross-sections 

85 

 
Figure 3.18: Cross-sectional resistance of Class 3 and Class 4 I-shaped profiles under bending 

about the major axis at elevated temperatures. Comparison between FEA and Part 1-2 of  

Eurocode 3. 

The results show that the prediction of the bending resistance according to Part 1-2 of  

Eurocode 3 needs to be improved. For beams with Class 4, it is observed that the resistance 

is underestimated especially for members with cross-sections with non-Class 4 flanges. See 

for example the 1-4 and 2-4 points in Figure 3.18, which represent cross-sections with  

Class 1 or Class 2 flanges and Class 4 web. As mentioned before, it is usual that, in these 

cases, around 80% of the bending resistance is provided by the flanges. If flanges are  

Class 1 or Class 2, they will not have local buckling, but since the actual simple design 

method of Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 suggests the use of 0.2p,k T  for the whole cross-section (see 

Table 3.4), a considerable amount of resistance is not taken into account. It was observed 

that for some cases this could be as much as 30% less. Figure 3.19 shows the moment-

On the other hand, beams with Class 3 cross-sections (1-3, 2-3 and 3-3 in Figure 3.18) have 

less resistance than the simple design methods predict. In the same way as for members in 

compression, these beams have local buckling problems that prevent the elastic bending 

resistance to be attained. This is shown in Figure 3.20, where the moment-rotation curve is 

depicted for a beam with Class 3 cross-section at different temperatures.

Fire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section 

90 

A better correlation between the numerical results obtained by means of FEA calculations 

and the new proposed methodologies to calculate the cross-sectional resistance is observed. 

It is concluded that adopting these approaches leads to a safer and economic design of steel 

beams with Class 3 and Class 4 cross-sections in fire conditions. This is also demonstrated 

in Figures 3.19-3.20 where the moment-rotation curves are depicted for a beam with  

Class 4 cross-section (with Class 2 flange) and for a beam with Class 3 cross-section (with 

Class 2 flange) respectively. It is also demonstrated that the Simple Proposal leads to safe 

and accurate results. 

3.6.3 Statistical investigation of the proposed methodologies

where , ,fi Rd SimplifiedM  is the value obtained with the simplified design methods according 

to Table 3.4 and , ,fi Rd FEAM  is the value obtained with SAFIR. 

The results from the simplified methods are deemed safe if they lead to values of ix  lower 

than the unity and unsafe for values higher than one. 

For compression, a total of 324 4 1296n  u   cases were studied representing the 324 

cross-sections analysed and considering the different steel grades (see Figure 3.10), for 4 

different temperatures. For bending about the major-axis, 376 4 1504n  u   cases were 

studied representing the 376 cross-sections analysed considering the different steel grades 

(see Figure 3.11) and also 4 different temperatures. 

The results of this statistical study are shown in Table 3.5 for the mean value and standard 

deviation of the results. The results for the three methodologies considered, namely i) 

Eurocode 3, the ii) Full Proposal and the iii) Simple Proposal for calculating the cross-

sectional effective properties and the corresponding resistance of the elements under 

compression and bending are shown.

iii) Simple proposal 0.997 0.067 0.955 0.038 
 

Table 3.5 shows that, the statistical investigation supports the conclusions drawn before. The 

existing design method of Eurocode 3 is the one that leads to more unsafe and scattered 

results with a mean value higher than 1.0 for the studied cases. On the other hand, both the 

Full Proposal and the Simple Proposal, in turn, lead to results with better agreement with 

those obtained with FEA investigation.

3.7 Comparison with experimental results 

In this section, the Full Proposal and the Simple Proposal described in section 3.3 are used 

to predict the cross-sectional capacity of different cases that were tested experimentally. The 

reduced number of experimental investigation on the behaviour of I-shape cross-sections at 

elevated temperatures, found in the literature is noticeable. Nonetheless, Wang et al. [3.27] 

conducted experimental investigation on steel stub columns with Class 4 cross-sections at 

elevated temperatures and within the European Research Project FIDESC4 [3.13], Hricák et 

al. [3.28], tested four laterally restrained beams to evaluate the bending resistance of  

Class 4 cross-sections at elevated temperatures. These tests were used to validate the 

proposed methodologies in this study. For the column cases, two cross-sections were tested, 

namely 234×6+250×8 (Test 1) and 300×6+200×8 (Test 2), whose flanges and webs in 

compression are classified as Class 4 at elevated temperatures. The specimens were heated 

at 450ºC and 650ºC. For the laterally restrained beams, the experiments were conducted on 

two different cross-sections also for the temperatures 450ºC and 650ºC. The first cross-

section (Test 3 - 656×4+250×12) has a Class 4 web and a Class 3 flange and the second 

cross-section (Test 4 - 830×5+300×8) has a web and flange of Class 4. A summary of the 

results obtained and the comparison to the predicted resistance using the methodologies 

proposed in this chapter are presented in Table 3.6. The provisions indicated in Table 3.3 

and Table 3.4 were used to predict the compression and bending resistance about the major-

axis respectively for the Full Proposal and Simple Proposal. The results of these calculations, 

as well as the ratio of experimentally evaluated resistance over the calculated results using 

the proposed methodologies are also summarized in Tables 3.6 and 3.7.

Figure 3.24: Comparison between Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 (EN1993-1-2) provisions and 

experimental results from other authors [3.27, 3.28]. 

It can be observed a good correlation between the experimental results and the predicted 

values using the new simplified methodologies proposed in this chapter. For most of the 

cases, the predicted results are lower than the ones obtained experimentally. For both 

proposals, three cases are on the unsafe side with a maximum of 9% and 13% difference 

respectively for the Full and Simple proposal but within the acceptable range as they refer 

to specimens heated at 650°C where it is more difficult to control the tests. Thus, it is 

demonstrated that both the Full Proposal and the Simple Proposal are methodologies that 

can be used to predict the ultimate capacity of cross-sections prone to local buckling at 

elevated temperatures, providing a reasonable method to calculate the cross-sectional 

resistance suitable for design and consistent with the current state of practice. The 

comparison of Eurocode 3 actual provisions with the experimental results also shows similar 

agreement. Unfortunately, these test results do not show the main advantages of using the 

new methodologies comparatively to the actual Eurocode 3 methodology as observed 

previously in this work.

3.8 Conclusions 

In this chapter, the resistance of several cross-sections where local buckling can occur under 

axial compression and bending was investigated at elevated temperatures. A numerical study 

with the FEA software SAFIR was conducted for a significant number of cross-sections, and 

a comparison to the actual design methodology of EN1993-1-2 was made. It was possible to 

conclude that the actual provisions of the EN1993-1-2 to calculate the cross-sectional 

resistance leads to both very conservative and unsafe results when compared to the numerical 

results obtained in FEA. Three reasons are highlighted. First, the effect of the temperature 

on the local buckling at elevated temperatures is not correctly taken into account when 

considering the effective properties determined based on the material properties at normal 

temperature. Secondly, local buckling occurs prior to what is currently assumed especially 

for Class 3 cross-sections. Third, considering the 0.2 % proof strength as the design yield 

strength, for the whole cross-section is restrictive if the cross-section has non-Class 4 

elements. Therefore, a new methodology to calculate the resistance of cross-sections with 

local buckling at elevated temperatures is provided in this study. Based on the effective width 

expressions at elevated temperatures previously developed [3.15] (see Chapter 2), which are 

presented in this study, the effects of local buckling in case of fire are better accounted for 

in the resulting effective cross-section. Using this effective cross-section, the use of the 

strength at a total 2% strain – ,yf T , as the design yield strength when calculating the 

resistance of members with Class 4 cross-section is recommended. With this, the additional 

resistance provided by the plates that do not have local buckling is taken into consideration, 

leading to an economic yet safe design. On the other hand, it was shown that for Class 3 

cross-sections at elevated temperatures, local buckling occurs prior to the attainment of the 

yield strength in one or more parts of the cross-section. Despite the possibility of considering 

these cross-sections as Class 4, and the consequent change in the width-to-thickness limits 

used in the classification, in this study, the use of an effective cross-section also for members 

with Class 3 cross-sections was proposed. 

Regarding the determination of the effective cross-section, two proposals were developed. 

A Full Proposal, for which the effective cross-section is temperature dependent, meaning 

that the designer needs to calculate an effective cross-section for each temperature, which 

represents the more rigorous approach to the issue of dealing with local buckling at elevated 



 

 

Fire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section 

96 

temperatures. A Simple Proposal was also developed, which is not temperature dependent 

allowing the designer to perform prompt calculations yet safe and accurate. The accuracy 

and validity of two proposals for calculating the effective cross-sections were confirmed and 

both approaches lead to a safer and economic design. This was also confirmed by the 

statistical investigation performed and the comparison with experimental results.

Abstract An extensive numerical study is performed to investigate the lateral-torsional buckling of 

steel beams with slender cross-sections in case of fire. The influence of local buckling is analysed 

and the numerical results are compared with the simplified design methods of Part 1-2 of  

Eurocode 3 for the case of beams with Class 1 and 2 cross-sections. It is demonstrated that the actual 

provisions of Eurocode 3 Part 1-2 are unreliable. A parametric study is carried out to investigate the 

influence of several parameters on the resistance of laterally unrestrained steel beams with slender 

cross-sections in case of fire: the effective section factor, the temperature, the steel grade, the depth 

(h)-to-width (b) ratio (h/b) and the residual stresses. Based on the parametric study a proposal for a 

new design curve is made for beams with slender cross-sections in case of fire taking into account 

the influence of local buckling by grouping the response of beams into different ranges of effective 

section factor. The capacity predicted by the simplified methods using the proposed design curve 

leads to an improved yet safe design method when compared to the results of the finite element 

analysis. Finally, it is demonstrated that factor “f” which was developed for Class 1 and 2 cross-

sections, could be used to account for non-uniform bending diagrams if it is limited to a certain value.

4.1 Introduction 

This chapter deals with the lateral-torsional buckling (LTB) behaviour of laterally 

unrestrained steel beams with slender cross-sections in case of fire. Slender cross-sections 

are comprised of plates with high width-to-thickness ratio (slenderness) and for that reason 

are prone to local buckling. Studies about the influence of local buckling in the LTB are very 

scarce under fire situation since LTB has been mainly studied for beams with cross-sections 

without local buckling instability. Bailey et al. [4.1] numerically investigated the LTB of 

unrestrained steel beams, and concluded that both British code and the Eurocode, at that 

time, overestimated the limiting temperatures for unrestrained simple beams in fire 

resistance calculations. Vila Real and Franssen [4.2] performed a numerical study, and 

proposed a design curve for LTB of steel beams. This design curve was later adopted in the 

final version of the Eurocode 3 Part 1-2 (EN 1993-1-2) [4.3]. The experimental investigation 

of Vila Real et al. [4.4] and later Mesquita et al. [4.5] carried out on the LTB of steel beams 

at elevated temperature was used to validate the proposed method by Vila Real and Franssen 

[4.2]. Vila Real et al. [4.6, 4.7] also studied the influence of the residual stresses in the LTB 

of steel beams, and they concluded that for Class 1 members is negligible, and widen his 

initial proposal to account for other loading types. An improved proposal for the lateral–

torsional buckling of unrestrained steel beams subjected to elevated temperatures was later 

presented by Vila Real et al. [4.8]. In this publication the influence of the loading type, the 

steel grade, the pattern of the residual stresses (hot-rolled or welded sections) and the ratio 

h/b, between the depth h and the width b of the cross-section on the resistance of the beam 

was addressed through an extensive numerical study. Based on this study, a proposal to 

include a factor to account for other loading cases (the factor “f”) as well as a severity factor 

for the influence of the steel grade in the current design method of Part 1-2 was presented. 

Dharma and Tan [4.9] proposed two alternatives approaches to the current design method of 

Eurocode 3 Part 1-2 based on numerical investigation to calculate the lateral-torsional 

buckling resistance in case of fire. They proposed an Alternative approach to address the 

discontinuity between the design method at high temperature and the one at room 

temperature; and an approach based on the Rankine formula that enables the failure 

temperature to be determined directly, without an iterative procedure as required in the  

EN1993-1-2 design method. In the referred studies, the beams were considered uniformly

heated and the influence of other temperature distribution was not addressed. On this subject, 

Yin and Wang [4.10] have numerically investigated the effects of several design factors on 

the lateral-torsional buckling bending moment resistance of a steel I-beams submitted to 

non-uniform temperature distributions. A proposal was made for a modification to the 

lateral-torsional buckling slenderness of the beam to account with the non-uniform 

distribution of the temperature along the cross-section, however only the variation of the 

temperature in the depth of cross-section was considered. Later, Zhang et al. [4.11] analysed 

the LTB behaviour of beams subjected to localized fires and concluded that the failure 

temperature may be considerably lower than that of uniformly heated beams. Further 

investigation on the LTB resistance on non-uniformly heated beams should be done but it is 

out of the scope of the present study. More recently, numerical investigation by Lopes and 

Vila Real [4.12] on Class 4 stainless steel beams was performed. The influence of the 

geometrical imperfections (local, global and both) and the residual stresses was analysed at 

high temperatures and it was concluded that they are relevant for the determination of the 

ultimate load and therefore should be considered according to the expected collapse mode. 

Apart from [4.12], which comprises a study for stainless steel members, none of the 

remaining studies deal with slender cross-sections prone to local buckling and its influence 

on the LTB resistance of beams. The Eurocode 3 [4.13] classifies these cross-sections, where 

local buckling prevents the yield strength of being reached in the compressed parts of the 

cross-sections, as Class 4, the highest class. Furthermore, in the establishment of the design 

rules of Eurocode 3 [4.3] in case of fire (Part 1-2), it was assumed that the simple design 

methods were adequate to design beams with Class 4 cross-sections if the recommendations 

of the Annex E of that norm were followed. In this Annex E of Part 1-2 of the Eurocode 3, 

it is suggested the use of an effective cross-section determined as for normal temperature 

and the use of 0.2% proof strength ( 0.2 ,pf T , see Figure 4.1) for the design yield strength. 

Thus, the influence of the local buckling is accounted for by reducing the cross-sectional 

capacity, by reducing the effective area and considering a small value of the yield strength.

Figure 4.1: Stress-strain relationship for carbon steel at elevated temperatures [4.14]. 

It must be noted that these recommendations of Annex E are based essentially in the early 

work of Ranby [4.15] who studied Class 4 plates at elevated temperature. On this matter, the 

same conclusions were reached in the previous chapters of this thesis [4.16–4.18] for cross-

sections built up exclusively of plates classified as Class 4 but demonstrated that for Class 4 

cross-sections with non-Class 4 plates these recommendations lead to inaccurate results. 

Additionally, it was demonstrated also that the local buckling prevents the elastic bending 

resistance of being reached even in Class 3 cross-section. Thus, the load bearing capacity of 

the members with such cross-sections is affected and needs to be investigated. 

In this chapter, an extensive numerical investigation is performed by finite element analysis 

(FEA) to study the influence of the local buckling on the LTB resistance of beams with  

Class 3 and Class 4 cross-sections under fire conditions. The effect of the temperature, 

residual stresses, steel grade and the depth-to-width (h/b) on the LTB resistance of beams 

with slender cross-sections are also detailed. It is demonstrated that using a new 

methodology to calculate the cross-section resistance developed in the previous chapters 

[4.16–4.18] together with the Eurocode 3 Part 1-2 beam design curve leads to an 

improvement on the results compared to FEA calculations. However, it is observed this 

design curve should be slightly changed for Class 3 and Class 4 cross-sections and a proposal 

for a new design curve is made. Accordingly, an effective section factor is proposed to group 

the behaviour of beams with slender cross-sections in a way that the interaction between

local and lateral-torsional buckling may be accounted for in case of fire. With this, better 

agreement between the simplified design methods and the numerical results is achieved 

leading to an improved yet safe design method. 

4.2 Lateral-torsional buckling of beams with Class 3 and 4 cross-section at 
elevated temperatures 

4.2.1 Eurocode 3 Part 1-2 

According to Part 1-2 of the Eurocode 3, the resistance of laterally unrestrained beams in 

bending at elevated temperature should be verified according to the equation (4.1) for 

members with Class 3 cross-section and according to equation (4.2) for Class 4 cross-

sections.

sections both relative to yf . yf  is the design yield strength and its respective safety factor

( 0.2 , 0.2 ,p p yf k fT T ) in equation (4.2), whereas in equation (4.1) the elastic section modulus

According to the methodology developed in Chapter 3 [4.17, 4.18] to assess the cross-

sectional resistance of Class 3 and Class 4 cross-sections, the equation (4.9) should be used 

to check the resistance of laterally unrestrained beams in bending at elevated temperature.

4.3 Numerical model 

The finite element model used in this work was implemented using the software SAFIR, 

which has been developed specifically for the analysis of structures in case of fire [4.20]. 

Geometric and material non-linear analysis with imperfections (GMNIA) using shell finite 

element models were carried out. The capability of SAFIR to model local buckling with shell 

elements was validated by Talamona and Franssen [4.21]. The beams were modelled using 

shell elements with four nodes and six degrees of freedom (3 translations and 3 rotations). 

These shell elements adopt the Kirchoff’s theory formulation with a total co-rotational 

description. A study on the mesh sensitivity was performed and the solution has converged 

for the members discretized with 100 divisions per 10.0 m on the length, 10 divisions on the 

flange width and 22 divisions of the web height. This mesh was used in this study. For the 

steel material model it was adopted a two-dimensional constitutive relation with the von 

Mises yield surface according to the non-linear stress-strain formulae of the Eurocode 3 (see 

Figure 4.1) and the respective reduction factors at elevated temperatures ( ,yk T , ,pk T  and  

,Ek T ). The integration on the shell elements is made with a Gauss scheme with 2 × 2 points 

on the surface and 4 points through the thickness were defined. The temperature has been 

considered uniform along the cross-section and along the beam so that a comparison between 

the numerical results and the simple design equations is possible. Single span members with 

fork supports as boundary conditions were modelled. Vertical displacements (Uz) were 

prevented on both extremities of the beam (see Figure 4.2) on the lower flange and lateral 

displacements (Uy) were also prevented in both extremities along the web, on one extremity, 

the displacements along the axis of the beam (Ux) were also blocked.

Figure 4.2: Illustration of the boundary conditions in the numerical model. 

The loads were modelled by applying distributed loads (by means of nodal forces) on the 

flanges and on the web. The collapse load for the beam at elevated temperatures was 

determined by firstly increasing the temperature to the desired value and then applying an 

increasing load until the failure is reached. The geometric imperfections have been 

introduced in the model by changing the node coordinates to represent the worst scenario for 

the assessment of lateral-torsional buckling resistance of the beams. This has been 

considered as the shape given by the eigenmodes of a linear buckling analysis performed 

with the software Cast3M [4.22]. In accordance with the finite element method of analysis 

recommendations given in the Annex C of EN1993-1-5 [4.19] a combination of global and 

local modes (see Figure 4.3) has been used, where the lower mode has been taken as the 

leading imperfection and the other one reduced to 70%. The amplitude of the imperfections 

was considered as 80% of the geometric fabrication tolerances given in the EN1090-2 [4.23] 

as suggested in the same annex. That is, the global mode has been scaled to 80% of L/750 

and the local mode to 80% of b/100 or 80% of hw/100, where b is the flange width and hw is 

the height of the web of the cross-section depending on which node occurred the maximum 

displacement for the local mode. The recommendation of the norm to consider at least 4 mm 

as the geometric fabrication tolerances for the web was also taken into account.

As mentioned already, the investigation on the ultimate capacity of laterally unrestrained 

beams with slender cross-sections in case of fire is very limited and experimental results are 

almost non-existent. On the scope of the European Research project FIDESC4 [4.27], three 

tests were performed on laterally unrestrained beams heated at elevated temperatures. The 

numerical model presented in this study was validated against those experimental tests and 

the results of this validation, as well as a mesh sensitivity study, are published in [4.28].

4.4 Comparison of FEA results with current beam design curve of the 
Eurocode 3 

In this section, a comparison between the numerical results obtained in SAFIR and the actual 

beam design curve from Part 1-2 of the Eurocode 3 (see section 4.2) is made. Several slender 

cross-sections with Class 3 and Class 4 classification were considered in this study. The 

geometry of the cross-sections is indicated in Table 4.1, as well as the steel grade, 

temperatures and non-dimensional slenderness considered in the numerical study. Here, the 

cross-sectional resistance was calculated according to EN1993-1-2 as given by  

equation (4.14) for Class 3 cross-sections and equation (4.15) for Class 4 cross-sections.

Figure 4.5: Comparison of actual LTB design curve of EN1993-1-2 and FEA simulations. 

From the figure, it is observed a distinct behaviour between Class 3 and Class 4 beams, more 

particularly for low slenderness range , 0.2LT TO |  where the resistance of the beam is mainly 

governed by the cross-section capacity.  

It is observed that for the beam with cross-section I450×6+150×8 (web Class 3 and flange 

Class 3), the EN1993-1-2 design curve over-predicts the beam capacity. For the cross-

section with higher flange thickness (see I450×6+150×15, web Class 3 and flange Class 1), 

better agreement is achieved between the capacity predicted numerically and with  

EN1993-1-2. For Class 4 beams, the actual design curve underestimates the beam capacity, 

especially for the Class 3 flange case (I450×4+150×10). This particular case of cross-

sections with Class 4 web and Class 3 flange, is representative of the situations from which 

the designers may benefit more from using beams with slender cross-sections. For the 

intermediate beams with , 1.0LT TO |  it is observed that for Class 3 cross-sections the curve 

is slightly unsafe. Furthermore, in Figure 4.6, the accuracy of EN1993-1-2 is compared for 

all the FEA simulations undertaken in this study as indicated in Table 4.1. 

 
Figure 4.6: Accuracy of the LTB design curve from EN1993-1-2 compared to FEA results with 

cross-sectional resistance calculated according to EN1993-1-2. 

The results obtained show the same pattern as for the cases considered in Figure 4.5 with 

distinct results attained for Class 3 and Class 4 beams. Here, for non-dimensional slenderness 

values of , 0.2LT TO | , more than 60% of load bearing capacity is not considered for Class 4 

beams while for Class 3 beams the EN1993-1-2 curve over predicts the capacity in more 

than 20%. On the subject of the resistance of slender cross-sections in case of fire, it was 

demonstrated in the previous chapter [4.16–4.18] that the cross-sectional resistance given by 

EN1993-1-2 formulae in comparison to FEA for Class 3 and Class 4 is inadequate because 

it underestimates the resistance of Class 4 cross-sections and overestimates the resistance of  

Class 3 cross-sections. 

Since the cross-sectional capacity influences the LTB resistance of the beams it worth study 

the impact of using this new formulation. Thus, in Figure 4.7, the results obtained with FEA 

and considering the cross-sectional resistance predicted by Simple proposal, i.e. using

In this case, it is observed again that the deviation of the results is less comparatively to 

Figure 4.6 where the cross-sectional resistance was calculated according to EN 1993-1-2 

provisions. For Class 3 beams the results are now mainly on the safe side with a  

maximum 10% on the unsafe side. For Class 4 beams there is less load-bearing capacity 

disregarded moving from a maximum 60% in Figure 4.6 towards 40% in Figure 4.8 for 

, 0.2LT TO | . However in the particular case of Class 4 cross-sections, it is observed that for 

, 0.5LT TO !  the use of the Simple proposal for the cross-sectional resistance developed in 

Chapter 3 increased the scatter of the results when compared to Figure 4.6, ranging  

from -20% to almost 30% for instance for , 1.0LT TO | . Although improvements are seen by 

considering the Simple proposal made in Chapter 3 for the cross-sectional resistance, the 

actual LTB design curve of EN 1993-1-2, which was developed only for Class 1 and  

Class 2 beams [4.2, 4.4], could be improved to better predict the capacity of beams with 

slender cross-sections as shown in the remaining part of this study. 

4.5 Parametric Study 

In order to develop an improved design curve for beams with slender cross-sections at 

elevated temperatures, a parametric study was performed to investigate the influence of 

various parameters using the numerical model described in section 4.3. Here, only uniform 

bending moment distribution was considered. First, the effective section factor concept is 

presented and its influence on LTB capacity is demonstrated then the influence of the 

temperature, the residual stresses, the steel grade and the depth-to-with ratio was also 

investigated. 

4.5.1 The Effective Section Factor concept and its influence 

The load bearing capacity of beams with slender cross-sections is influenced by the 

interaction between the resistance to local buckling of the cross-sectional and the overall 

resistance of the beam to lateral-torsional buckling. In order to account with this interaction, 

it is here proposed to group the behaviour of the beams by considering an effective section 

factor s for the cross-section given by 

 , ,eff y el ys W W  (4.16) 



 

 

Chapter 4. Beams 

117 

where ,eff yW  is the effective section modulus and ,el yW  is the elastic section modulus, both 

for the strong axis. From the results it were identified three different groups according to the 

interaction between the local buckling and the lateral-torsional buckling being high  

( , , 0.8eff y el yW W d ), moderate ( , ,0.8 0.9eff y el yW W? d ) or small ( , , 0.9eff y el yW W ! ). In 

Figures 4.9 – 4.11 the numerical results are plotted for these ranges of effective section factor 

ratios. For ease of comparison, in these figures it is also plotted the EN1993-1-2 design curve 

for steel grade S355 as a reference line.

Figure 4.11: LTB behaviour of beams with effective section factor of , , 0.9eff y el yW W ! . 

From these figures it can be observed different trends for the numerical results depending on 

the effective section factor and the following conclusions can be highlighted: 

x For , , 0.8eff y el yW W d , it is observed a plateau until , 0.4LT TO | , meaning that until 

this slenderness the capacity of the beams is governed by the cross-sectional 

resistance. For higher slenderness ( , 0.4LT TO ! ), the capacity of the beam is reduced 

due to the interaction between the local buckling resistance of the cross-section and 

the lateral-torsional buckling resistance of the member. However, in this effective 

section factor range, cross-sections are more prone to local buckling and therefore its 

influence in the response of the beams is higher, when compared to the remaining 

ranges. For this purpose, the reduction on the overall load bearing capacity of the 

beams is also less in relative terms. For instance, the minimum values of the reduction 

factor for a slenderness of , 1.0LT TO | , in Figure 4.9 is , 0.46LT fiF | , for Figure 4.10 

is , 0.42LT fiF | and in Figure 4.11 is , 0.37LT fiF | , this represents a difference of 

approximately 10% in relative terms for each successive range. 

x For , ,0.8 0.9eff y el yW W? d , and comparing to the previous case, the effective section 

factor of the cross-section is higher (i.e. more effective) meaning the cross-section is 

less prone to local buckling and therefore the influence of local buckling in the 

overall response of the beams is less in relative terms. For this range, the plateau is

smaller and placed at , 0.3LT TO | . After this slenderness, the reduction of resistance 

is more severe due to the greater influence of the lateral-torsional instability mode, 

when compared to local buckling, in the overall response of the beam. 

x Finally, for , , 0.9eff y el yW W ! , the influence of the local buckling is even less 

compared to previous cases, and consequently the plateau is placed at , 0.2LT TO |  

and, as expected, the reduction of the load bearing capacity is even more severe when 

compared to the previous ranges of effective section factor because it is mainly 

influenced by the lateral-torsional buckling resistance of the beam.  

4.5.2 Temperature influence 

The influence of temperature values on the lateral-torsional buckling resistance of laterally 

unrestrained beams is analysed. The results obtained for four sections described in Table 4.3 

are detailed here. The steel grade considered was the S355. The temperature distribution in 

the cross-section and along the member was considered uniform so that comparison between 

the numerical results and simple design equations is possible. The temperatures 350 - 700ºC 

(in 50ºC intervals) were used.

4.5.3 Residual stresses influence 

Here, the influence of the residual stresses on the ultimate capacity of laterally unrestrained 

beams is investigated for four different cross-sections described in Table 4.3. Welded and 

hot-rolled cases are considered with the patterns of residual stresses defined in Figure 4.4. 

Results are shown in Figure 4.16 and are presented as the ratio between the ultimate load 

obtained in FEA with and without residual stresses. Various steel grades and temperatures 

(350ºC, 450ºC, 550ºC and 700ºC) were considered.

The residual stresses have an unfavourable influence on the LTB resistance of beams. In 

case of fire, this influence is less than that at normal temperature, since in case of fire the 

temperature causes a relaxation of the residual stresses and, therefore, a maximum 15% of 

reduction of the LTB resistance due to the residual stresses on beams with slender cross-

sections is observed for both hot-rolled and welded cases. The reduction on the LTB 

resistance is higher for intermediate slenderness values ,1.0 1.4LT TOd d  for both cases and 

for slenderness values of , 0.4LT TO d  no influence is noticed of the residual stresses. Based 

on this comparison, it was decided to consider in the remaining part of this study, only the 

pattern corresponding to welded cross-sections depicted in Figure 4.4. 

4.5.4 Steel grade influence 

In this section, the influence of the steel grade is shown. Figure 4.17 a) – d) depict the 

numerical results obtained for all the profiles indicated in Table 4.1 with effective section 

factor of , , 0.8eff y el yW W d  and steel grades S235, S275, S355 and S460 respectively. These 

steel grades have a yield strength at normal temperature of 235 MPa, 275MPa, 355 MPa  

and 460 MPa. For the purpose of comparison, the EN1993-1-2 design curves for each steel 

grades are plotted in all charts.

Figure 4.17: LTB behaviour of beams with effective section factor of , , 0.8eff y el yW W d  for 

different steel grades. 

From these figures, it is observed that the reduction of the beam capacity is dependent on the 

steel grade. The better the steel grade the less is the reduction of the lateral-torsional buckling 

resistance of a beam. For instance, for slenderness of , 1.0LT TO | , the minimum value for the 

reduction factor on the steel S235 is about , 0.46LT fiF |  (see Figure 4.17 a) while for S460 

is about , 0.51LT fiF | (see Figure 4.17 d) which represents more than 10% increase of 

resistance in relative terms. This is in line with the actual provisions of the Eurocode 3 which 

take the effect of steel grade into account in the verifications of beams against lateral-

torsional buckling through the parameter D (see equation (4.4)). Although it is not here 

shown to reduce the size of this chapter, similar results was obtained for other ranges of 

effective section factor. 

4.5.5 Depth-to-width ratio influence 

The depth h to width b ratio (h/b) of a cross-section is used in Part 1-1 of Eurocode 3 to 

group the properties of the sections and take into account a variety of factors such as the 

torsional stiffness or the critical behaviour in plasticity as pointed out in [4.29]. At elevated 

temperatures, this influence was also observed for Class 1 profiles in [4.8] and a severity 

factor that takes into account the influence of the h/b ratio among other parameters was

investigated for a variety of slender cross-sections (see Table 4.1) considering different steel 

grades and temperatures (350ºC, 450ºC, 550ºC and 700ºC). Figure 4.18 shows the influence

Figure 4.18: Influence of the depth-to-width ratio on the LTB resistance of beams with different 

effective section factor. Steel grade S355. 

From this figure, it is observed that influence of the depth-to-width ratio (h/b) is negligible 

for slender cross-sections. As depicted in these figures, no distinct behaviour between 

sections with h/b &amp;lt;2 and h/b &gt; 2 is noticed. Since this parameter accounts for the critical 

behaviour in plasticity and slender cross-sections are considered here, explains the absence 

of a different behaviour. Although it is not demonstrated in this chapter, similar trends were 

observed for other steel grades. 

4.6 New design curve 

Based on the parametric study performed in section 4.5, new design curves are proposed in 

this section. The improvements of using this new proposal in comparison to the actual design 

curve given in Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 are also here demonstrated. The new design curves 

are dependent on the effective section factor (see subsection 4.5.1) and on the steel grade 

(see subsection 4.5.4), which were the main parameters influencing the lateral-torsional 

buckling behaviour of beams with slender cross-sections at elevated temperatures. As stated 

before, the influence of the steel grade was already taken into account in EN 1993-1-2 in the 

definition of the imperfection factor, using parameter 235 / yfH   (see equation (4.5)).

Fire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section

Since in practical terms the proposed design curves should be used together with the cross-

sectional resistance calculated according to Simple proposal (see section 4.2.2), in  

Figure 4.25 its accuracy is presented. 

 
Figure 4.25: Accuracy of the new design curve compared to FEA results with cross-sectional 

resistance calculated according to Simple proposal from Chapter 3. 

Figures 4.25 and 4.8 are comparable, i.e., the new proposal and the EN 1993-1-2 design 

curve respectively considering the cross-section resistance calculated with the Simple 

proposal from Chapter 3. It is observed from this comparison that results are less scattered 

when using the new proposal, especially for slenderness , 1.0LT TO d , meaning that there is 

closer agreement between the numerical results and the proposal for the simplified design 

method. On the other hand, a large number of results for slenderness around , 1.0LT TO |  lay 

on the unsafe side for the EN 1993-1-2 design curve. As observed in Figure 4.21 and  

Figure 4.22, these are mainly Class 3 and Class 4 cross-sections with an effective section 

factor tending towards the unity, i.e. are less prone to local buckling, this is corrected by 

considering curve L1 which is more conservative than that of EN 1993-1-2. With the new 

proposal, the beam capacity is better predicted and the safety of using simplified design 

methods increases (going from a minimum of -20% for EN1993-1-2 to -7% on the new 

proposal).

4.7 Non-uniform bending diagrams 

In this section, beams submitted to non-uniform bending diagrams are studied. The 

numerical model described in section 4.3 was used and cross-section 450×4+150×tf was 

considered. In this section, it was not possible to study the common case corresponding to a 

point load applied at mid-span due to web-buckling and other local phenomena that was 

observed prior to global instability. For this case, web stiffeners could have been considered 

to address this issue but such assumptions were out of the scope of this research programme. 

For the same reason, the distributed load case was modelled using nodal forces applied at 

the lower flange. Additionally, the numerical results where failure of the beams was mainly 

due to shear stresses were disregarded. 

The inclusion of the factor “f” to take into account different loading cases on the lateral-

torsional buckling response of the beams in case of fire was proposed in [4.8, 4.30] for  

Class 1 and 2 beams. The applicability of the formulae to Class 3 and 4 beams is investigated 

here. Accordingly, the factor “f” is defined as 

 ? ?1 0.5 1 cf k ? ?   (4.18) 

where ck  is a correction factor according to Table 4.5.

to a constant bending moment are not much. It is observed that using the factor “f” in this 

case leads to some improvements and therefore it is recommended.

However, for the bi-triangular case, it is noticed that the curve does not fit the numerical 

results and several results lay on the unsafe side. In this case, it is observed that for slender 

cross-sections the interaction between local buckling and lateral-torsional buckling does not 

allow reaching the beam resistance as predicted by the factor “f” that was initial developed 

for Class 1 and 2 cross-sections. For that reason, it is proposed to use a limitation on the 

factor “f” to account with this. Accordingly, this factor should be given by

to Simple proposal from Chapter 3 (case ii), the number of unsafe results decreases  

to 16.70%. In addition, for both cases the maximum unsafe result is high (1.32 and 1.23) 

which demonstrates that the current design LTB curve from EN 1993-1-2, as mentioned 

previously in this chapter, is not adequate to design beams with slender cross-sections

against lateral-torsional buckling in fire situation. The proposed design method (case iii) 

gives 6.53% cases on the unsafe side with a maximum unsafe result of 1.08, meaning that 

the capacity predicted by the simplified methods gives a maximum 8% difference on the 

unsafe side comparatively to the FEA results. 

Regarding beams submitted to non-uniform bending diagram, statistical results obtained for 

different methodologies are presented in Table 4.7.

Table 4.7 shows that the new proposal (case i) is too much conservative (average value  

of 0.76) but is always safe sided. Considering factor “f” from equation (4.18) (case ii) the 

results now yield an average value of 0.93, however, 19.21% unsafe results are obtained with 

a maximum of 1.18. As it was demonstrated in section 4.7.2, this proposal is not adequate 

for bi-triangular bending diagram ( 1\  ? ). Finally, considering a limitation on the  

factor f t 0.8 (case iii), gives an average value of 0.90 with just 4.80% unsafe results and a 

maximum of 1.07, thus it is concluded that this proposal could be used to design beams with 

slender cross-sections submitted to non-uniform bending diagram in fire situation. 

4.9 Conclusions 

In this study, the behaviour of beams with slender cross-sections subjected to uniform 

bending moment was investigated with finite element analysis software SAFIR in case of 

fire. Shell finite elements were used and several Class 3 and Class 4 cross-sections, as well 

as different temperatures and different steel grades were considered. In the first instance, it 



 

 

Chapter 4. Beams 

143 

was observed that the actual fire design rules of Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 for checking the 

lateral-torsional buckling resistance of beams with slender cross-sections could be improved. 

It was demonstrated that using the current methodology to calculate the cross-sectional 

resistance at elevated temperatures to check the LTB resistance of beams in case of fire 

according to Part 1-2 leads to inaccurate results. The comparison to FEA carried out in 

SAFIR, demonstrated that for small slenderness ranges of the beams the resistance was over 

predicted for Class 3 cross-sections and underestimated for Class 4 cross-sections. The 

methodology developed in Chapter 3 to calculate the cross-sectional capacity of Class 3 and 

Class 4 cross-sections was then used to check the accuracy of the existing beam design rule 

and improvements were noticed. Nonetheless, it was observed that the actual simplified 

methodology of EN 1993-1-2 could be improved to better account with the specific 

behaviour of beams with slender cross-sections. 

A parametric study was performed to investigate the influence of several parameters on the 

LTB resistance of beams with slender cross-sections, namely the effective cross-section ratio 

, ,eff y el yW W , the temperature, the residual stresses, the steel grade and the depth-to-width 

ratio. From the studied parameters, it was found that the beam resistance depends on the 

effective ratio of the cross-section. Therefore, an effective section factor was proposed for 

this ratio , ,eff y el ys W W  and different ranges were defined according to the influence of the 

local buckling on the lateral-torsional buckling resistance of beams: i) for , , 0.8eff y el yW W d  

it is high; ii) For , ,0.8 0.9eff y el yW W? d  it is moderate and iii) for , , 0.9eff y el yW W !  it is 

small.  

Finally, a proposal for a new design curve including the effective section factor was proposed 

and validated against numerical results. The new proposal allows for better prediction of the 

capacity of beams with slender cross-sections against lateral-torsional buckling in case of 

fire. Additionally, for non-uniform bending diagrams, it was concluded that the factor “f” 

could be used together with the new proposal to account with the effect of the loading case 

providing that this factor is limited to f t 0.8.

Abstract In this chapter, the behaviour of steel beam-columns with Class 4 cross-section is 

numerically investigated in case of fire. The accuracy of the simplified methods stated in Part 1-2 of 

Eurocode 3 is analysed and its safety level is determined. More than 6000 numerical simulations 

have been carried out, considering in-plane and out-of-plane buckling, several member lengths, 

different temperatures as well as different bending moment diagram and load ratios. Local and global 

geometrical imperfections as well as residual stresses have been considered in the numerical 

simulations. It was possible to conclude that the interaction curve of Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 is 

inconsistent for the in-plane direction giving both unsafe and very conservative results. For the out-

of-plane direction, the interaction curve demonstrated to be very conservative mainly because the 

reduction factor for the lateral-torsional buckling is too severe for bending diagrams other than that 

of uniform bending. Regarding the accuracy of the interaction factors predicted by the formulae, 

modifications are proposed in this work that lead to reduction of the number of unsafe results. Finally, 

a new proposal for the interaction curve is presented according to the developments in this thesis and 

its accuracy and validity is demonstrated by comparison to the numerical results. 

  



 

 

Chapter 5. Beam-columns 

151 

5.1 Introduction 

The structural elements subjected to axial compression and bending are normally designated 

as beam-columns. For beam-columns at normal temperature, two methods exist in Part 1-1 

of the Eurocode 3 [5.1], to evaluate the safety of the members resulting from the work of 

two different groups in the framework of the European convention for constructional 

steelwork (ECCS) Technical Committee 8 (TC8 – Stability). The two methods called the 

“Level 1” and “Level 2” beam-column interaction formulae [5.2–5.4] replaced the beam-

column interaction formulae present in the previous ENV version of the Eurocode 3  

Part 1-1 [5.5] that proven to be very conservative.  

In case of fire, Part 1-2 of the Eurocode 3 [5.6] adopts the same format as the ENV version 

making the necessary modifications to account for the yield stress and the modulus of 

elasticity values at high temperatures. The buckling reduction factors for flexural buckling 

and Lateral Torsional Buckling (LTB) in fire were also included and when LTB is prevented, 

the beam-column interaction curves are the results from the studies of Talamona  

et al. [5.7, 5.8]. Numerical studies carried out by Vila Real et al. [5.9, 5.10],  

Lopes et al. [5.11] and Knobloch et al. [5.12] evaluated the safety and accuracy of the current 

methods available in the EN1993-1-1 adapted to elevated temperatures for the fire design of 

beam-columns and concluded that additional changes had to be made in order to use them. 

Several researches were then conducted to investigate the influence of different parameters 

on the behaviour of steel beam-columns in fire. Experimental investigations of Kodur and 

Dwaikat [5.13], conducted on beams that behave as beam-columns due to the compressive 

forces originated from the thermal restraint allowed to conclude that the fire scenario, load 

level, degree of end-restraint and high-temperature creep have significant influence on the 

behaviour of beams under fire conditions. Dwaikat et al. [5.14] investigated beam-columns 

that develop a thermal gradient through their depth when exposed to fire and conclude that 

the plastic resistance to combinations of axial load and moment was also affected by the 

thermal gradients influencing the location of the most critical section. Quiel et al. [5.15] 

evaluated the adequacy of different methodologies to predict the capacity and response 

caused by non-uniform thermal gradients through the depth of beam–columns. A simplified 

approach to predict the axial and moment capacity is made by Dwaikat and Kodur in [5.16] 

for the cases where a thermal gradient is developed.

However, in these studies, local buckling was not covered. In the numerical investigations 

beam-finite elements were used which do not capture the plate instability and therefore only 

Class 1 or 2 cross-sections were analysed. In the experimental investigation, local buckling 

was out of the scope of the aforementioned studies. Consequently, the behaviour of Class 4 

members submitted to combined moment and axial loads has not yet been studied at elevated 

temperatures and the safety and accuracy of the existing rules of Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 has 

not yet been established. It is unclear how the interaction between flexural buckling and 

lateral torsional buckling together with local buckling affects the load bearing capacity of 

the members in case of fire. 

This chapter presents a numerical study of the behaviour of steel I-shaped Class 4 beam-

columns subjected to combined axial and in-plane bending moment under fire conditions. A 

parametric study at elevated temperatures was done using shell finite elements with the 

software SAFIR [5.17, 5.18] by performing geometrically and materially nonlinear analyses 

with imperfections included (GMNIA). Several member lengths, cross-section geometries 

and different axial and bending moment ratio with and without lateral displacements allowed 

(restriction to out-of-plane displacements). A comparison of the obtained numerical results 

and the interaction curves of EN1993-1-2 show that for members with Class 4 cross-sections 

the existing formulae are safe and conservative. Mainly because the existing design curves 

for beams and columns with Class 4 cross-sections need to be improved. It is demonstrated 

that new interaction curves can be used based on the numerical results leading to a safer and 

economic design of steel I-shaped profiles with Class 4 cross-section at elevated 

temperatures, on the assumption that the design curves for beams and columns are correctly 

calibrated.  

5.2 The code provisions of Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 

According to Part 1-2 of EC3 [5.6], the design buckling resistance at time t for a member 

without lateral restraints and with a Class 4 cross section subject to combined bending and 

axial compression in fire situation should be verified by satisfying the interaction curve 

defined by equations (5.1a) and (5.1b) for doubly symmetric cross-sections. These are the 

equations (4.21c) and (4.21d) respectively of Part 1-2 of EC3 adapted for Class 4, i.e., 

considering the effective cross-sectional properties.

The type of cross-sections analysed in this work are normally submitted to in-plane loading 

and therefore only bending about the major-axis were considered, thus the terms related to 

the minor-axis (z) were disregarded.  

5.3 Numerical study 

A numerical investigation on the behaviour of members submitted to combined bending and 

axial compression was performed with the finite element method using the software  

SAFIR [5.17] in case of fire. Next, the used numerical model is described. In 5.3.2 the 



 

 

Chapter 5. Beam-columns 

155 

geometric and material imperfections used are referred and in 5.3.3 the cases that have been 

studied are presented. 

5.3.1 Numeric model 

The beam-columns were discretized into several quadrangular shell elements with four 

nodes with six degrees of freedom (3 translations and 3 rotations) each. In SAFIR, these 

shell elements adopt the Kirchoff’s theory formulation with a total co-rotational description. 

The material law is a two-dimensional constitutive relation with the von Mises yield surface. 

The integration on the shell element follows a Gauss scheme with 2 × 2 points on the surface 

and 4 points through the thickness. Since shell elements are used, the root fillet of the cross-

sections has been disregarded in all the models. The shell finite element used in SAFIR and 

its ability to model local buckling has been validated by Talamona and Franssen [5.19, 5.20]. 

After a sensitivity analysis a mesh with 10 shell elements for the flange, 22 shell elements 

for the web and 100 shell elements along the length has been used. For the beam-columns 

with a span higher than 10 m the divisions on the length were doubled. The loads were 

applied to the model by means of nodal forces and to prevent numerical problems end-plates 

have been used. The so-called “fork-support” conditions have been considered in the model 

by restraining vertical displacements of the bottom flange and the out-of-the plane horizontal 

displacements of the web in the extremities of the beam as well as the rotation about the 

beam axis. 

5.3.2 Geometric and material imperfections 

The geometric imperfections have been introduced in the model by changing the node 

coordinates to represent the worst scenario for the assessment of beam-column resistance. 

This has been considered as the shape given by the eigenmodes of a linear buckling analysis 

(LBA) performed with the software Cast3M [5.21]. A tool was written in order to automate 

this process resulting in the software RUBY [5.22]. In accordance with the finite element 

method of analysis recommendations given in the Annex C of EN1993-1-5 [5.23], a 

combination of global and local modes (see Figure 5.1) has been used, where the lower mode 

has been taken as the leading imperfection and the other one reduced to 70%. The amplitude 

of the imperfections has been chosen as 80% of the fabrication tolerances given in the 



 

 

Fire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section 

156 

EN1090-2 [5.24], as suggested in the same annex [5.23]. Consequently, the global mode has 

been scaled to 80% of L/750 and the local mode has been scaled either to 80% of b/100 if 

the maximum node displacement (in respect to the local mode) occurs in the flange or  

to 80% of hw/100 if the maximum node displacement occurs in the web, whereas b is the 

flange width and hw is the height of the web of the cross-section.

At elevated temperature, the effect of the residual stresses is small [5.25, 5.26]. In this study, 

only the residual stress diagram [5.27] that corresponds to welded cross-sections has been 



 

 

Chapter 5. Beam-columns 

157 

used as depicted in Figure 4.4. The values adopted for the residual stresses are according to 

[5.27, 5.28] as used in a previous study [5.29]. 

Figure 5.2: Pattern of the residual stresses considered in this study for welded profiles. 

5.3.3 Cases studied 

Different Class 4 cross-sections, member lengths, temperatures and ratios between the 

applied axial compression and bending moment were considered as shown in Table 5.2. The 

steel grade considered was the S355. The temperature was considered constant in the cross-

section and along the member to allow direct comparison with the simplified methods of the 

Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3. Different moment distribution was also considered, with end-

moments and distributed load. Two directions of buckling have been considered, the minor-

axis buckling was considered as out-of-plane buckling and the buckling in the major-axis 

was considered as in-plane buckling. Since in the studied cases the web was slender  

(Class 4), it was not possible to study the common case corresponding to a point load applied 

at mid-span due to web-buckling and other local phenomena that was observed prior to 

global instability and being out of the scope of this research programme. The same was 

observed regarding the location of the application of the distributed load and it was only 

possible to investigate the case corresponding to the load applied in the lower flange. To 

study the other cases stiffeners to avoid local buckling would be needed and it was out of 

the scope of this study.

5.4 Results 

Comparison between the results obtained numerically and using the predicted capacity of 

the interaction curves in equations (5.1a) and (5.1b) are presented here. Throughout this 

study, the values for the axial compression resistance ,fi RdN  and the bending resistance about 

the major-axis , ,y fi RdM  were obtained numerically with SAFIR. This procedure avoids the 

error associated with the determination of the cross-sectional resistance of Class 4 sections 

using simplified methods as demonstrated in Chapter 3 [5.30]. 

5.4.1 In-plane behaviour 

The in-plane behaviour of the beam-columns is investigated numerically by considering the 

model described in 5.3.1 but restraining the out-of-plane (lateral) displacements by imposing 

the additional restraints in the flanges as depicted in Figure 5.3.

equation (5.1a) was then employed considering the ultimate axial force and uniform bending 

moment given in SAFIR as the design loads. Results are plotted in Figure 5.4 against the 

non-dimensional slenderness ,y TO  and in Figure 5.5 against the ratio between the applied 

bending moment and the cross-sectional bending resistance , , Rd/ y fiM M . In these figures, 

the line corresponding to the value 1 in the vertical axis defines the interaction curve. If the 

points, which represent the numerical results, are below the line it means the ultimate loads 

obtained numerically are below those predicted by equation (5.1a) and therefore are unsafe 

and safe otherwise.

Figure 5.5: Comparison of interaction curve and the numerical cases studied for the in-plane 

behaviour in terms of the applied bending moment. 

It is observed that the results are inconsistent with both unsafe and very conservative results 

obtained. Two reasons for this are pointed out: i) the reduction factor for the in-plane column 

buckling ,y fiF  calculated according to EN1993-1-2 demonstrates to be too severe for some 

cases and unsafe for others (see Figure 5.6) and ii) the interaction factor yk  calculated 

according to equation (5.2) depends on the factor yP  calculated with equation (5.3) that 

gives unsafe results for the bi-triangular bending diagram ( 1\  ? ) as later shown  

in section 5.4.2.

To investigate the accuracy of the interaction curve but not considering the differences

obtained numerically with SAFIR (as in Chapter 3). The interaction curve with the reduction 

factor calculated with equation (5.7) is referred as “EN 1993-1-2 calibrated” later  

in Figures 5.9 – 5.11. By doing so, this curve corresponds to a theoretically interaction curve 

without the uncertainties associated with the cross-sectional resistance (see Chapter 3) and 

also without the uncertainties associated with the reduction factor for the flexural buckling 

according to 1.2 of Eurocode 3. Following this methodology, the safety level of the existing 

interaction factors used in equation (5.1a) are investigated. Figure 5.7 shows the comparison 

of the numerical results and the interaction curve defined in equation (5.1a) and calculating 

the reduction factor according to equation (5.7) and using, as the resistance moment of the 

cross-section, the corresponding value calculated with SAFIR.

In order to reduce the number of unsafe results, the factor yP  was calibrated following the 

same methodology adopted in [5.7]. According to the procedure adopted by Talamona, the 

following expression can be used to extract from each numerical simulation the value of  

yP  , that fulfils equation (5.1a).

Fire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section 

164 

By using equation (5.9) instead of equation (5.3), a limit value of 0.2 is introduced that 

changes the response obtained especially for the beam-columns subjected to bi-triangular 

bending moment ( 1\  ? ) (see Figure 5.8c). 

In Figure 5.9, results are shown for one beam-column, for different temperatures and the 

different procedures for the interaction curve including the one using yP  given in  

equation (5.9) which is referred as “Eq. (5.1a) with newyP  ”. In Figure 5.10, the results 

for the same beam-column submitted to different moment distribution and considering a 

temperature of 450ºC.

Some improvements are observed with less unsafe results while the same level of accuracy 

was maintained for the remaining results (see Section 5.5). 

5.4.3  Out-of-plane behaviour 

The out-of-plane behaviour of the beam-columns was investigated. Equation (5.1b) was used 

considering the ultimate axial load and bending moment given by SAFIR as the design loads. 

Results are plotted in Figure 5.13 against the non-dimensional slenderness ,z TO  and in  

Figure 5.14 against the ratio between the applied bending moment and the cross-sectional 

bending resistance , , Rd/ y fiM M . In these figures, the horizontal line at the value 1 in the 

vertical axis defines the interaction curve. If the points that represent the numerical results 

are below the line it means the ultimate loads obtained numerically are below those predicted 

by equation (5.1b) and therefore are unsafe or safe otherwise.

Figure 5.14: Comparison of interaction curve and the numerical cases studied for the out-of-plane 

behaviour in terms of the applied bending moment. 

From Figures 5.13-5.14, it can be seen that the existing curve of Part 1-2 of EC3 for members 

with combined uniform bending moment and axial compression is very conservative, but 

this is mainly because the design curves for columns and beams are conservative.  

Figure 5.15 shows the comparison between the numerical results for members only 

submitted to axial compression and the column design curve of the EN 1993-1-2, where this 

is observed. Figure 5.16 shows the same comparison but for members submitted to bending 

in the major axis without any lateral restraints and the EN 1993-1-2 beam design curve. As 

shown in the previous chapter, the design curve of EN 1993-1-2 is much safe sided especially 

for triangular ( 0\  ) and bi-triangular ( 1\  ? ) cases.

Figure 5.17: Comparison of interaction curves and the numerical cases studied with reduction

It is observed that the interaction curve is slightly in the unsafe side (see the statistical 

evaluation on Section 5.5) for higher values of the non-dimensional slenderness. In the next 

section, modification to the current interaction factors is proposed in order to correct this 

deviation.

5.5 Statistical evaluation 

Table 5.3 presents the statistical results for the beam-columns in fire situation for the various 

methods and both in-plane and out-of-plane directions. More than 3000 numerical 

simulations were considered for each direction. For each methodology, the mean value P  

and the standard deviation s  of the numerical results were calculated from:

 (5.15) 

where for each methodology, ix  is given according to equations (5.1a) and (5.1b) for in-

plane or out-of-plane direction. Since in these expressions the ultimate loads obtained in 

SAFIR were considered as the design loads, a value higher than 1.0 yield a safe results. 

Accordingly, the maximum unsafe result is the maximum deviation obtained with  

equations (5.1a) and (5.1b). In this table, it is also indicated the percentage of unsafe results. 

For the EN1993-1-2 method, it can be seen that the standard deviation is high in both 

directions, with a considerable number of results unsafe for the in-plane buckling direction. 

In what concerns unsafe results in the in-plane direction, it was observed to be due to the 

EN1993-1-2 column design curve being slightly unsafe for some results (see Figure 5.6) and 

the expression for yP  not being adequate for bi-triangular bending diagram (see 5.4.2). For 

the out-of-plane direction, the column design curve (see Figure 5.15) and beam design curve 

(see Figure 5.16) are mainly over-conservative in comparison to the numerical results, 

especially for the beam cases with triangular and bi-triangular bending diagrams, this leads 

to over-conservative results for the interaction curve with an average value of 1.29. For the 

methodologies where the reduction factors were calculated numerically (denoted 

“calibrated”) it is observed that the standard deviation is reduced, but the number of unsafe 

results also increases (from 25.72% to 29.14% for the in-plane direction and from 0.56%  

to 14.82% for the out-of-plane direction). To solve this, it were proposed modifications to

5.6 New proposal according to the developments of this thesis 

According to the developments of this thesis, the design buckling resistance at time t for a 

member without lateral restraints and with a Class 4 cross section subject to combined in-

plane bending and axial compression in fire situation should be verified by satisfying the 

interaction curve defined by equations (5.13a) and (5.13b) for doubly symmetric cross-

sections.

For sake of comparison, Table 5.5 presents the results obtained using the formulae of the 

Eurocode 3 Part 1-2. In this case, the cross-sectional resistance has been calculated with the 

actual formulae of the Eurocode 3 given in Tables 3.3 and 3.4 in Chapter 3.

From the previous tables it is observed that the number of unsafe results reduced 

considerably from 23.79% to 10.14% for the in-plane direction and it is close for the out-of-

plane direction (from 0.13% to 0.89%). For the in-plane direction, the average value 

increased 4% (from 1.13 to 1.17) but the standard deviation and the maximum unsafe result 

decreased, from 15.72% to 13.94% and from 0.81 to 0.89 respectively. For the out-of-plane 

direction, the improvements obtained with the new proposal are less noticeable, with the 

average decreasing from 1.31 to 1.28 and the maximum unsafe results from 0.97 to 0.91. 

Nonetheless, the proposals made in this thesis revealed to be safe and accurate when 

compared to the numerical results for the determination of the buckling resistance of slender 

beam-columns in case of fire. 

5.7 Conclusions 

In this chapter, the behaviour of beam-columns with Class 4 cross-section is investigated 

numerically. The accuracy of the existing interaction formulae of EN 1993-1-2 was 

analysed. The methodology of EN1993-1-2 is based on an interaction curve that can be 

divided into in-plane and out-of-plane direction. According to the obtained numeric results, 

this interaction curve proved to be very conservative for the out-of-plane direction but 

inconsistent for the in-plane direction. The main reason for this, is that for both cases it 

depends on the reduction factor for the column behaviour ( ,y fiF  and ,z fiF ) with the formulae 



 

 

Chapter 5. Beam-columns 

179 

available in the EN 1993-1-2 for their calculation being conservative. However, for the 

particular case of in-plane direction with bi-triangular bending moment ( 1\  ? ) some 

unsafe results were observed for low slenderness of the member. Additionally, for the out-

of-plane direction, lateral-torsional buckling (LTB) is accounted for by the appropriate 

reduction factor, LT, fiF , which revealed to be very conservative, especially for the cases 

where the member is submitted to triangular and bi-triangular bending moment diagrams, 

0\   and 1\  ? , respectively. This has an accountable influence on the safety level of the 

interaction curve for the out-of-plane situation making it very conservative. In both cases, it 

is undeniable that the formulation of Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 to calculate the beam-columns 

in case of fire will benefit from improved design rules for columns and beams.  

In this chapter, the safety level of the interaction factors preconized in the beam-column 

formulae of EN1993-1-2 was also investigated removing the scatter associated with the 

reduction factors ,y fiF , ,z fiF  and LT, fiF  by calculating them numerically. From the results of 

numerical investigation, it was observed that for beam-columns submitted to bi-triangular 

bending moments ( 1\  ? ), the current interaction factor lead to some unsafe results for 

both directions. Based on the same methodology used for the calibration of these factors 

when they were established in Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3, a new proposal has been made. These 

modifications allowed the reduction of the number of unsafe results while maintaining the 

same level of accuracy of the interaction curve. 

Finally, it was presented the formulation of the interaction curve accounting with the 

developments in this thesis for the cross-section resistance (Chapter 3) and considering the 

LT, fiF  calculated as in Chapter 4. The formulation proved to be safe and accurate for 

determining the resistance of beam-columns with slender cross-sections submitted to 

combine axial compression and bending about the major-axis in case of fire when compared 

to numerical results.

Chapter 6. Conclusions 

185 

6.1 General description of the work developed 

The work done in this thesis aimed at the development of simplified design rules for steel 

members with H or I shape Class 4 cross-section in case of fire, with special focus on beams 

and beams-columns. 

First the accuracy of the existing fire design rules given in the informative Annex E of  

Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 [6.1] for members with Class 4 cross-sections were investigated. In 

Chapter 2, it was concluded that using the proposed methodology of Eurocode 3 to deal with 

Class 4 cross-sections, namely using the effective width method given in Part 1-5 of 

Eurocode 3 [6.2] with a reduced design value of the steel yield strength (corresponding  

to 0.2% proof strength) leads to inaccurate determination of the ultimate buckling strength 

of thin plates in case of fire. In Chapter 3, the capacity of Class 4 cross-sections was 

investigated and it was concluded that the Eurocode 3 method was underestimating the 

resistance of the cross-sections mainly because the additional reserve of resistance provided 

by non-Class 4 plates is not accounted for by the current methodology. Additionally, it was 

concluded from these two chapters that local buckling may occur prior to the full 

development of axial plastic resistance or elastic bending resistance, thus Class 3 cross-

sections were also investigated and treated as if they were prone to local buckling.  

Chapters 4 and 5 deal with the behaviour of beams and beam-columns respectively with 

slender (Class 3 and 4) cross-sections. It was concluded that the design provisions of 

Eurocode 3 for beams and beam-columns, were mainly conservative. The current simple 

design methods of Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 were developed for Class 1 and 2 cross-sections 

and, when applied to Class 3 and Class 4 cross-sections demonstrated to be inadequate and 

that it could be improved. 

The need of improved design rules for members with Class 3 and 4 cross-sections is implicit, 

and was addressed throughout this work and a contribute for better fire design of members 

with slender cross-sections was presented. In Chapter 2 analytical expressions that allow for 

a closer prediction of the ultimate strength of thin-plates were developed and then used in 

Chapter 3 to provide a methodology to calculate the cross-sectional capacity in case of fire. 

This new methodology was later used to assess the accuracy of the existing design rules for 

beam and beams-columns and also as the basis for the development of new formulae. 



 

 

Fire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section 

186 

In Chapter 4, for beams with slender cross-sections, new curves for the design against lateral-

torsional buckling were proposed, these expressions account with the influence of the 

interaction between the lateral-torsional buckling and the local buckling trough a parameter 

denominated as the effective section factor. The imperfection factor normally used in the 

lateral-torsional buckling design formulae was calibrated and defined as a function of the 

effective section factor and a plateau was also introduced into the design formulae.  

Beam-columns with slender cross-sections were studied in Chapter 5. The failure in strong-

axis (designated in this document as in-plane buckling) and the weak-axis (designated as 

out-of-plane buckling) was investigated. Although conservative results were obtained, a 

good fit between numerical results and the Eurocode 3 interaction curve was generally 

observed, the reason be that the reduction factors to account with the column behaviour 

(flexural buckling) and the beam behaviour (lateral-torsional buckling) are conservative and 

influence the accuracy of the beam-column interaction curve. If this accumulated error is 

eliminated, good correlation is obtained between the numerical results and the interaction 

formulae. Nonetheless, for the in-plane case, however, the numerical results were slightly 

unsafe for beam-columns submitted to bi-triangular bending diagram ( 1\  ? ) and so a 

modification to the interaction factors was proposed to account with this difference. 

The particular conclusions and remarks for each chapter of the thesis are addressed in the 

next sections. 

6.2 Chapter 2 – Plates 

In Chapter 2 the behaviour at elevated temperatures of individual thin steel plates that form 

the slender cross-sections was addressed. The influence of local buckling in the ultimate load 

bearing capacity of the plates in case of fire was investigated by performing several analyses 

based on shell finite elements. 

At normal temperature, it was concluded that the numerical results obtained with shell finite 

elements do fit well on the existing design expressions given in Part 1-5 of Eurocode 3 [6.2] 

to calculate the effective width of the plates and thus the ultimate resistance of the plates, 

except for the internal elements under compression. In this case, the design expressions may 

have been defined considering a less severe geometrical imperfection than that currently

187 

recommended by Part 2 of EN 1090 [6.3]. This may lead to inaccurate estimation of the 

cross-sectional capacity at normal temperature and further studies should be done to confirm 

this. 

In case of fire, as mentioned, the Eurocode 3 recommends for Class 4 plates the same 

equations as for normal temperature to calculate the effective width of the plates and  

the 0.2% proof strength as the design yield strength to assess their capacity. Good agreement 

with the numerical results was achieved with this method, however, for plates with lower 

non-dimensional slenderness, especially in the range of Class 3, the Eurocode 3 failed to 

predict the ultimate strength of these plates. Consequently, this leads to overestimation of 

the capacity of Class 3 cross-sections as observed in Chapter 3. On the other hand, 

considering a different yield stress for steel demonstrated to have impact on the cross-

sectional capacity as seen in Chapter 4: the non-Class 4 plates provide additional resistance 

to the cross-section which is not accounted for by the current methodology of Eurocode 3, 

leading to the underestimation of the cross-sectional capacity.  

In this chapter, expressions for the effective width method to account for the local buckling 

at elevated temperatures were developed. These new expressions enable for the calculation 

of the effective cross-section properties and resistance using the strength at a total strain  

of 2% as the steel design yield stress as done for the other classes. This lead to a better 

agreement between FEA results and the expressions to calculate the cross-sectional 

resistance in Chapter 3. 

The new expressions are temperature dependant resulting in a variation of the effective 

cross-section properties under fire situation and although the method herein proposed can be 

implemented with relatively ease of computational effort if compared with the actual design 

rules, it was also demonstrated that the proposal corresponding to a constant steel 

temperature of 700ºa CT   could be used as the lower bound for the effective properties In 

Chapter 3, this simplification was further developed in order to have a consistent and simple 

design methodology to calculate the cross-sectional resistance. 

Some remarks are noticed here. First it was observed that the geometric imperfections have 

a considerable influence on the ultimate resistance of the plates and in this case imperfections 

were considered according to EN 1090-2 [6.3] by following the recommendations of

Part 1-5 of Eurocode 3, thus other values of geometrical imperfection amplitude may lead to 

distinct behaviour and should be investigated. The second remark is related to the 

temperature distribution that was considered uniform. In this case, non-uniform distribution 

of temperatures may have a non-negligible influence in the ultimate capacity of the plates 

and could be addressed in the future. As a final remark on this chapter, although these 

expressions were developed for simply supported plates considered separately, other 

supports and loading conditions could have been considered, in theory, by an appropriate 

plate buckling factor. The most interesting part would have been to take into account with 

the interaction between the plates, as for instance, Seif and Schafer [6.4] have made, by 

developing expressions to calculate the plate buckling factor for several hot-rolled cross-

sections. These principles in the future could be extended as well as to consider non-uniform 

temperature distributions within the cross-section which was not covered in this thesis.  

To conclude, the expressions developed within this chapter allow for a better prediction of 

the ultimate capacity of thin-plates at elevated temperature and thus provide a better solution 

to account for local buckling in case of fire. 

6.3 Chapter 3 – Cross-sections 

In Chapter 3, the resistance of several cross-sections where local buckling can occur under 

axial compression and bending about the major-axis was investigated at elevated 

temperatures using shell finite elements. The expressions to calculate the effective width in 

case of fire developed in the previous chapter (Chapter 2) were used in the definition of a 

new methodology to calculate the cross-sectional capacity of sections prone to local buckling 

in case of fire. 

As noted in the previous section, the actual provisions of Eurocode 3 Part 1-2 to calculate 

the cross-sectional resistance leads to simultaneous to very conservative and to unsafe results 

when compared to the numerical results. Three reasons were highlighted in this chapter. 

First, the effect of the temperature on the local buckling at elevated temperatures is not 

correctly taken into account when considering the effective properties determined based on 

the material properties at normal temperature. Secondly, local buckling occurs prior to what 

is currently assumed especially for Class 3 cross-sections. Third, considering the 0.2 % proof 



 

 

Chapter 6. Conclusions 

189 

strength as the design yield strength, for the whole cross-section is restrictive if the cross-

section has non-Class 4 elements. 

To overcome these limitations, a new methodology to calculate the resistance of cross-

sections with local buckling at elevated temperatures was defined in this chapter based on 

the effective width expressions at elevated temperatures developed in Chapter 2. 

Accordingly, the influence of local buckling in the decrease of resistance in case of fire is 

better taken into account. It was concluded that using the effective cross-section determined 

with those expressions and the strength at a total 2% strain – ,yf T , as the design yield strength 

when calculating the capacity of slender cross-sections, the additional resistance provided 

by the plates that do not have local buckling is considered, leading to an economic yet safe 

design. On the other hand, it was shown that by calculating an effective cross-section for 

Class 3 cross-sections at elevated temperatures that the decrease of resistance due to local 

buckling is also accounted for in these cases. The possibility of considering these cross-

sections as Class 4, and to study the modifications to limits used in the classification of the 

cross-sections could be addressed in the future and was not covered in this work. 

In this chapter, only H and I shape cross-sections were investigated and regarding the 

bending direction only bending in strong-axis was considered. As mentioned in the previous 

section, the expressions developed in Chapter 2 to calculate the effective width are not 

limited to H and I shape cross-sections but, nonetheless, their validity should be confirmed 

and the work done in this chapter be extended to square and rectangular cross-sections. In 

terms of bending in the weak-axis, in Chapter 2 outstand plates submitted to bending were 

not investigated and that should be covered in the future.  

Finally and to conclude, for sake of simplicity, two proposals were presented in this chapter 

to calculate slender cross-section’s resistance in case of fire: a more complex yet rigorous 

approach which is temperature dependent, meaning that an effective cross-section has to be 

determined for each temperature, and a simplified proposal that does not depend on the 

temperature and enables prompt calculations yet safe and accurate.

6.4 Chapter 4 – Beams 

In this chapter, the behaviour of laterally unrestrained beams with slender cross-sections was 

investigated. The aim was to study existing design provisions of Eurocode 3 to check the 

lateral-torsional buckling in case of fire and to develop improved design methods. 

First, the actual provisions of Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 for checking the lateral-torsional 

buckling resistance of beams with slender cross-sections were analysed. It was demonstrated 

that inaccurate results were obtained mainly due to the cross-sectional capacity being 

inconsistently calculated. This was in line with the previous chapters of the thesis, and by 

using the methodology developed in Chapter 3 to calculate the cross-section capacity 

improvements were observed. 

Nonetheless, in this chapter an improved design method was developed. For that purpose, 

several parameters were investigated in order to attain their influence on the lateral-torsional 

buckling of beams with slender cross-sections in case of fire. It was found that the capacity 

of the beams was mainly influenced by the interaction between the local buckling and the 

lateral-torsional buckling and that it depended on the steel grade as well. For the first, an 

effective section factor was proposed for this ratio , ,eff y el ys W W  and different ranges were 

defined according to the influence of the local buckling on the lateral-torsional buckling 

resistance of beams: i) for , , 0.8eff y el yW W d  it is high; ii) for , ,0.8 0.9eff y el yW W? d  it is 

moderate and iii) for , , 0.9eff y el yW W !  it is small. In respect to the steel grade, the proposed 

design method accounts with this influence through the parameter H which was already the 
case in the current design formulae of Eurocode 3.  

In terms of the interaction between local buckling and lateral-torsional buckling, the 

proposed philosophy of dealing with such a complex subject by grouping the behaviour of 

beams into several ranges of effective section factor must be subject to some considerations. 

This factor is somehow analogous to the depth-to-width (h/b) ratio on the formulae at room 

temperature. In that case, The depth h/b ratio of a cross-section is used in Part 1-1 of 

Eurocode 3 to group the properties of the sections and take into account a variety of factors 

such as the torsional stiffness or the critical behaviour in plasticity as pointed out in [6.5]. In 

the future, this interaction could be further investigated and developed and at best have an

191 

effective section factor that is dependent on other variables such as the second moment of 

area in the strong-axis and weak-axis (Iy and Iz, respectively) that lead to better allowance 

for the interaction between local buckling and lateral-torsional buckling. 

In the final part of the chapter, the proposal was also compared with the use of the factor “f” 

to take into account different loading cases. This factor was originally developed for  

Class 1 and 2 beams and demonstrated to be rather accurate for beams submitted to uniform 

distributed loads and triangular bending moments ( 0\  ). For the bi-triangular case  

( 1\  ? ) it was observed that the original proposal for the factor “f” lead to some unsafe 

results and a lower bound of 0.8f t  was proposed leading to better agreement between the 

results and the simplified design methods. A remark on this subject should be made, further 

investigation should be developed in order to understand better the influence of the loading 

on the capacity of beams with slender cross-sections. The case where the shear stress is 

higher and constant on the beam ( 1\  ? ) is the one that leads to higher discrepancy between 

the original proposal for factor “f”. Since cross-sections with slender webs are considered 

here, the interaction between the shear stresses and the bending moment may not be 

negligible and needs to be analysed in more detail. Also, for the bi-triangular case, only 

1\  ?  has been considered and a limitation is proposed for 0.8f t . The 0.8 value 

corresponds to the factor “f” for 0\  . The practical implications of using this limit is that 

for bi-triangular bending moments ( 0\ ? ) the factor “f” remains unchanged and this may 

be too conservative for some situations. 

Finally it was concluded that the new proposal developed in this chapter allows for better 

prediction of the capacity of beams with slender cross-sections against lateral-torsional 

buckling in case of fire. 

6.5 Chapter 5 – Beam-Columns 

This chapter focused on the behaviour of beam-columns with slender cross-section. A 

numerical investigation using shell finite elements was performed to evaluate the accuracy 

of existing interaction formulae of Eurocode 3. 



 

 

Fire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section 

192 

The actual methodology of Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 to check the resistance of members 

submitted to combine axial compression with bending in case of fire is based on an 

interaction curve that can be separated into in-plane and out-of-plane direction. For both 

directions, this methodology proved to be unreliable: for the in-plane direction (buckling in 

the strong-axis) both very conservative and unsafe results were obtained. For the first, the 

reason for such results is that the reduction factor for the column behaviour – ,y fiF  – provided 

in Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 is already conservative in some cases and has a favourable 

influence on the interaction curve. For the latter, it was observed that the interaction factor 

when the beam-column is submitted to bi-triangular moments loading case ( 1\  ? ) was 

not adequate and lead to some unsafe results. This behaviour is in accordance with what was 

obtained in Chapter 4 for the beams: for the cases where the shear stresses are more important 

the resistance deviates more from the existing design methodologies. The interaction 

between the shear stresses and bending moments was not exploited in this thesis because it 

was out of the scope of the present research programme, however this subject should be 

addressed in the future and better formulae to take into account with this phenomenon should 

also improve the proposals made within this thesis. For the out-of-plane direction, the 

interaction curve also relies on the calculation of the reduction factor for the lateral-torsional 

buckling (LTB) which demonstrated in Chapter 4 to be very conservative especially for the 

cases where the member is submitted to triangular and bi-triangular bending moment 

diagrams, 0\   and 1\  ? . This has an accountable influence on the safety level of the 

interaction curve for the out-of-plane situation, making it very conservative. Consequently, 

it was concluded that for both directions, the formulation of Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3 to 

calculate the beam-columns in case of fire could benefit with improved design rules for 

columns and beams. 

In accordance with the last statement, in this chapter, the safety level of the current 

interaction curve was also analysed but considering the reduction factors ,y fiF , ,z fiF  and 

LT, fiF  obtained numerically. This allowed to observe that for beam-columns submitted to bi-

triangular bending moments ( 1\  ? ), that the current interaction factor lead to some unsafe 

results for both directions. Based on the same methodology used for the calibration of these 

factors [6.6] when they were established in Part 1-2 of Eurocode 3, a new proposal has been 



 

 

Chapter 6. Conclusions 

193 

made. These modifications allowed the reduction of the number of unsafe results while 

maintaining the same level of accuracy of the interaction curve. 

This chapter contains also the formulation of a proposal for the interaction curve according 

to the developments of this thesis to check the buckling resistance of slender beam-columns 

submitted to combined axial compression and bending in the major-axis at elevated 

temperatures. It was conclude that this proposal leads to conservative results for the cases 

studied. 

6.6 Future developments 

As any research study, the present work is delimited in a time period. Several questions were 

left open in the present document. Although some general remarks have been highlighted in 

the previous section of the current chapter, here some guidelines for further work are 

described. 

The subject of cross-section classification in case of fire should be further investigated. 

The developments on this thesis demonstrated that cross-sections with Class 3 were also 

prone to local buckling and it was suggested that an effective cross-section should be 

calculated also for these types of cross-sections. However, it could be studied the 

modifications for the classification limits for the cross-sections and the effective cross-

section be determined only for Class 4 cross-sections. 

The existing design provisions of Eurocode 3 recommend a critical temperature of 350°C to 

be considered if no additional calculation is performed to assess the resistance of the 

members with Class 4 cross-section. Following the research conducted in this thesis and the 

new design methods developed, investigation towards a higher prescribed temperature 

could be proposed and compared against numerical results. 

Cross-sections with different shape, the proposed methods developed in this thesis were 

based mainly on I and H shape cross-sections. Numerical investigations considering other 

shapes of cross-sections, namely rectangular and square hollow sections could be addressed 

in the future. 



 

 

Fire design of steel members with Class 4 cross-section 

194 

The interaction between shear force and bending moment may influence the response of 

members with slender cross-section. Although the proposals made within this thesis may 

account with this influence, for instance in the limitation of the “f” factor for bi-triangular 

bending diagram ( 1\  ? , see Chapter 4), further investigation should address this matter in 

the future. 

The effect of non-uniform temperature, should be seen as a future improvement on the 

current proposals. It is unclear how the non-uniform temperature distribution along the 

plates, the cross-sections and the members affect the conclusions in this work. It is assumed 

that considering a constant temperature along the cross-section is the worst scenario for 

assessing the capacity of the members in case of fire so it is foreseen that a non-uniform 

temperature distribution may have a favourable influence that could be accounted for in the 

design formulae. 

Finally, the proposed methods to design beams against lateral-torsional buckling could 

be extended to room temperature design. Following the same methodology used within 

this thesis, the development of a methodology to account with the interaction between local 

buckling and lateral-torsional buckling by means of an effective section factor at room 

temperature is possible.
