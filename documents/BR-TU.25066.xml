resumo 
 

 

Esta tese de doutoramento teve como principal objetivo a conceção de novas 
organossílicas mesoporosas periódicas (PMOs) para aplicação na separação 
de misturas gasosas de dióxido de carbono e metano. Materiais PMOs, com 
grupos fenileno e bifenileno bissililados, foram modificados por introdução de 
grupos funcionais amina, utilizando uma das seguintes metodologias: 
i) reação de co-condensação;  
ii) pós-modificação da ponte orgânica;  
iii) "grafting". 
O tamanho dos poros das PMOs funcionalizadas e não funcionalizadas foi 
definido pelo tamanho da cadeia alquilada da molécula molde (surfactante) 
utilizada na síntese do material poroso. Estudou-se o efeito do diâmetro dos 
poros na separação de CO2/CH4. Investigou-se também estratégias alternativas 
para modificar as propriedades físico-químicas dos materiais através de reações 
de superfície utilizando irradiação de micro-ondas; deposição de camada 
atómica (ALD) de óxido de alumínio; e carbonização dos materiais em atmosfera 
inerte. 
A investigação experimental foi efectuada em paralelo com estudos 
computacionais. Realizou-se um estudo de simulação molecular recorrendo ao 
método de DFT, e usando um arranjo regular de grupos fenileno-sílica, para 
determinar as características ideais dos materiais para promover a separação 
de metano do dióxido de carbono em misturas destes gases. Foi utilizado um 
modelo simples, obtido pela repetição de uma célula unitária com 3 anéis 
fenileno, para simular a parede dos materiais PMOs e desta forma selecionar e 
avaliar as interações entre os gases e os grupos funcionais presentes na 
superfície dos materiais. A tendência do rácio entre energias de interação entre 
a estrutura da parede do fenileno - PMO e as moléculas de CO2 e de CH4 foi 
concordante com os rácios das constantes de Henry obtidos pela técnica de 
adsorção. Demonstrou-se uma boa sinergia entre tarefas experimentais e 
computacionais, o que permite a otimização de recursos, evitando a síntese 
desnecessária de materiais que se antecipem serem pouco eficazes para o 
processo de separação de misturas gasosas CO2 e CH4. 
Assim, a abordagem seguida nesta tese para alcançar adsorventes eficazes foi 
baseada numa conjugação interdisciplinar envolvendo troca de informação entre 
as tarefas de síntese, modelação computacional e adsorção.

abstract 

 
The main objective of this PhD Thesis was the design of periodic mesoporous 
organosilicas (PMOs) for applications in carbon dioxide and methane separation. 
Novel PMOs were prepared by the modification of phenylene and biphenylene 
PMO materials with different amine functionalities through one of the three 
following synthetic strategies: 
i) co-condensation reaction; 
ii) organic bridge post-modification; or/and 
iii) grafting. 
The pore size of both functionalized and non-functionalized phenylene PMOs 
was regulated by the size of the alkyl-chain in the surfactant template. Materials 
with different pore sizes were used to understand the influence of the pore 
diameter on the CO2/CH4 separation. Additionally, it was aimed to explore 
alternative strategies to modify the physical-chemical properties of the materials 
such as microwave-assisted functionalization; atomic layer deposition (ALD) of 
aluminum oxide at the PMO surfaces; and carbonization of the PMO materials. 
The experimental research was performed in parallel with computational studies. 
A molecular simulation study, using the DFT method and a regular arrangement 
of phenylene-silica groups, of the ideal characteristics of the adsorbent materials, 
for CO2/CH4 separation was performed. It was used a simple model of the wall 
of the PMO materials obtained by the repetition of a unit cell with 3 phenylene 
rings, to select and evaluate interactions between gases and functional groups 
in the surface of the materials. The tendency between the ratio of the interaction 
energies between the wall structure of the phenylene-PMO and the CO2 and CH4 
molecules was in good agreement with the ratio of the Henry constants achieved 
by the adsorption technique. Therefore, a good synergy between experimental 
and computational tasks was implemented to optimize the resources, avoiding 
the synthesis of ineffective materials. 
Thus, the strategy of this PhD Thesis to achieve effective adsorbents was based 
on an interdisciplinary approach and on the ability to link and interchange 
information between synthetic, computer modeling and adsorption experiments.

1.1 Motivation and Objectives 

The global objective of this PhD project was to tune the properties of periodic mesoporous 

organosilicas (PMOs) for biogas upgrading, i.e., for CO2/CH4 separation. 

The scientific activities, grounded on synergetic experimental and computational studies, 

were divided in five tasks according to the following specific aims: 

Aim 1 – To prepare bissilylated organic precursors and novel PMOs with periodically 

ordered porous structure at the meso- and molecular-scales; 

Aim 2 – To modify the pore size of the PMOs by changing the surfactant template and to 

evaluate its influence in the CO2/CH4 separation; 

Aim 3 – To develop synthetic strategies to insert amine groups on the organic bridges of 

PMOs and to advance different methodologies to tune the properties of the PMOs. 

Aim 4 – To calculate the energy of the interaction of CO2/CH4 molecules with the PMOs 

surface and to assess, at the atomic level, which functional groups enhance the properties of 

the materials for CO2/CH4 separation. 

Aim 5 – To evaluate experimentally the developed PMOs for the adsorption of CO2 and 

CH4.

1.2 Biogas upgrading: the CH4 purification problem 

The human population is growing and at this moment we overpass the 7 billion of humans 

in the planet Earth. Several concerns have been associated to the expanding of the population 

which together with the strong economic progress leads to an increase of the world energy 

demand. Associated to the growth of the number of the humans there are also concerns 

associated with the rising production of organic waste and the intensive animal agriculture 

that all together foment the production of greenhouse gases. The emission of these gases to 

the atmosphere promotes the greenhouse effect and, consequently, leads to an increase of 

the temperature of our planet, promoting climate changes. Thus, a possible solution is to take 

advantage of these gases for energy production. Biogas is an alternative energy source, 

produced through the anaerobic digestion process of large variety of organic waste, such as 

sewage, animal byproducts, agricultural, industrial, and municipal solid wastes,  

Figure 1.1.[1–7] Biogas is mainly composed by methane (60-70%) and carbon dioxide  

(30-40%), and presents also trace gases such as H2S, CO, H2 and N2, dust and dirt particles. 

 
Figure 1.1. Biogas: a renewable energy. 
 

Since impurities may cause corrosion, deposits and damage to equipment, it is required the 

complete removal of all the contaminant species in biogas to produce biomethane. 

Additionally, if the biogas is to be upgraded for household applications (standard natural 



Chapter 1 

3 

 

gas) or car fuel, it is also critical the removal of CO2 since it reduces the energy content of 

biogas.[1–4,8,9] For example, to introduce the biogas at the natural gas pipelines, the methane 

gas needs to present a level of purification of 97%. Therefore, an energy efficient process to 

uptake CO2 from CH4 is required to spread the application of biogas, avoiding the corrosion 

of equipment and pipelines by the CO2 acidic gas.[10,11] Moreover, up-taken CO2 can be then 

used as refrigerant or at the agriculture production (through adsorption of CO2 by the green 

plants) together with the biofertilizer obtained during the anaerobic digestion of the organic 

waste.[1,12] Current methodologies to purify off-gas (the effluent gas produced from the 

anaerobic digestion process of organic matter) and to increase its caloric value[1] are 

absorption, cryogenic distillation, membrane separation, and adsorption.[12,13] The main 

commercial solutions available for CO2 uptake from biogas use absorption process through 

the use of amine based solvents able to react chemically with CO2, such as monoethanol 

amine (MEA), diethanolamine (DEA), and methyl diethanolamine (MDEA), with chemical 

structures represented in Figure 1.2. 

 
Figure 1.2. Chemical structures of MEA, DEA and MDEA. 
 

Monoethanol amines are the most common solvents used due to their low cost. The available 

commercial technologies for CO2/CH4 separation present several drawbacks associated to 

the low CO2 loading capacity of the solvent (0.40 kg CO2 / kg MEA); degradation of the 

amine solvent in contact with NOx, SOx, O2 gases; high cost of solution regeneration 

(concomitantly the CO2 absorption capacity of the regenerated amine solution decreases); 

corrosion of the equipment by the amine solution and the scale up of the process. An 

alternative technology uses sterically hindered amines for CO2 absorption. These have a low 

corrosive nature and less degradation from O2 when compared to MEA as a solvent. 

However, the capacity to adsorb CO2 is lower than the capacity observed for the MEA 

solution. Another process, aqua ammonia (NH3), has been attracting attention due to the 

assumption that it could simultaneously remove NOx and SOx along with CO2 from flue 

gases. This process presents high CO2 loading capacity when compared to other absorption 



Chapter 1 

4 

 

processes (1.20 kg CO2 / kg ammonia), and enables the control of several different pollutants 

at the same time. Additionally, it does not present equipment corrosion issues or absorbent 

degradation by oxygen. The resulting ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate 

(subproducts from the adsorption process) can be used as fertilizers. Although this process 

also presents some disadvantages, for instance i) the flue gas must be cooled to 15–27 °C 

due to volatility of ammonia, ii) additional equipment is necessary due to precipitates 

formation upon CO2 capture and iii) high ammonia vapor losses occur during stripping.[13]  

Based on the limitations associated with the absorption technologies described above, the 

development of solid adsorbents to uptake CO2 via adsorption separation has been thought 

as an alternative. The adsorption technology is a very attractive technique from small to 

medium-scale operations, but it relies on the availability of highly effective adsorbent 

materials, requiring the preparation of materials with different nature and structure.[14] 

Various mesoporous and microporous adsorbents, Figure 1.3, such as activated  

carbons[15–19], metal organic frameworks (MOFs)[15,20,21], zeolites and zeolitic imidazolate 

framework (ZIFs)[10,15,22–25], clays[26,27], and silica-based mesoporous materials[28,29] have 

been proposed for CO2 adsorption/separation from biogas. 

 

 
Figure 1.3. Development timeline of the porous material families according to the pore size. 
 

The CO2 capture capacities on several different materials, e.g. carbons, MOFs, zeolites and 

ZIFs, clays and silicas, have been reported in the literature.[30] Selected data for materials 



Chapter 1 

5 

 

used in the separation of CO2/CH4 are presented in Table 1.1. As it can be observed, all 

materials exposed adsorb more CO2 than CH4 at temperatures between 25 and 35 °C. In the 

case of the MAC (microwave activated carbon) material, the data were determined at 

different temperatures with concomitant effects on the values of the capacities. For instance, 

MAC shows a 20% reduction in the CO2 capacity upon temperature increase from 25 to 35 

°C. The CO2/CH4 adsorption capacity ratio also decreases with the increase of temperature.  

MOFs materials presenting Ni[31] or Mg[31] as metal centers adsorb higher amounts of CO2 

than MOFs prepared with Cu[32] or Al[33], but the ratio of the CO2/CH4 capacities is very low, 

when compared with the MOF with amine functionalities. 

Zeolites and ZIFs adsorbents demonstrate CO2 capacities inferior to those displayed by the 

MOFs CPO-27-Ni[31] and CPO-27-Mg[31], but the former also adsorb much smaller amounts 

of CH4, giving rise to a larger ratio between the CO2 and CH4 capacities.

In the case of clays, PILC Alw[27] and PILC AlB[27] show the smallest capacities for the 

adsorption of CO2 and CH4 from the selection of materials presented in Table 1.1, but the 

ratios between the CO2/CH4 capacities are similar to those displayed by other materials (e.g. 

zeolites).  

Interestingly, despite the silica-based mesoporous materials present low CO2 adsorption 

capacities, the ratios of the CO2/CH4 capacities of these materials are, in general, higher than 

in the case of the other adsorbents. A material showing high molar selectivity ratio is 

APTES@STMBF[38], which is an SBA-15 pore expanded silica prepared by condensation 

reaction of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) under the presence of P123 as structure directing 

agent, trimethylbenzene as swelling agent and ammonium fluoride as solubility enhancer, 

followed by grafting of aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES). Although, these adsorbents 

are still not ideal for CO2 uptake from biogas mainly due to the following reasons: the ideal 

adsorbent needs to present the optimal features as high capacity, perfect selectivity, long-

term durability, good mechanical stability, fast uptake processes, easy regeneration 

consistent with negligible capacity loss on multiple adsorption/desorption cycles and low 

toxicity.[40] 

In order to attain these aims, the aromatic bridged-PMOs incorporating some modifications 

are proposed as adsorbents for CO2/CH4 gas separation. PMOs are easy to prepare and 

exhibit crystal-like walls, high specific surface areas, high pore volumes and high thermal 

stability.[41–43] Additionally, a good diffusion of the molecules can be achieved within the 

channels of the Ph-PMOs as the organic functions are an integral part of the walls of these 

materials. The control of the porosity of the PMOs is made through the use of template-

assisted self-assembly method. Likewise on silica materials, the amine chemical 

modification of the Ph-PMO[44] can be done to improve the affinity of the materials to 

interactions with CO2 without changing that with CH4. 

The novelty of the present PhD work is the tuning of the adsorption properties of PMOs 

through functionalization of their organic groups, using new synthetic strategies. Thus, the 

inclusion of different amino groups in PMOs is investigated for creating materials with high 

?-? conjugation and different hydrophobic/hydrophilic character. To the best of our 

knowledge, only a few examples of the preparation of amine-functionalized PMOs were 

reported in the literature and none of them were tested in the proposed applications. 

Moreover, all experimental work is performed in close synergy with the theoretical

calculations. Additionally, other non-conventional approaches were also used to improve the 

CO2 adsorption properties of the PMOs and their selectivity for the CO2/CH4 separation. 

The following section starts with a brief review of the history of how PMO materials 

emerged from silica, which organic functions were introduced in these materials, and which 

textural, physical and chemical properties were expected to be obtained with such 

modifications. 

 

1.3 Ordered mesoporous silica materials 

Nanostructured porous materials have been prepared by a bottom-up approach,[45–48] such as 

template-assisted self-assembly method,[46,48] in which the nanomolecular blocks are 

arranged around surfactant micelles via weak interactions.[49] This procedure allows the 

tuning of the pore shape, size and connectivity, as well as of the chemical composition. 

In this PhD Thesis, the self-assembly methodology is extensively used to prepare organic-

inorganic hybrid nanoporous material such as PMOs. These materials combine organic and 

inorganic properties and have received much attention in the last two decades. 

PMOs, discovered in 1999[41–43], are mesoporous 2D structures formed by bissilylated 

organic bridges linked to each other by silica moieties,[50] which resemble periodic 

mesoporous silicas (PMS).[51–53] The M41S family of materials denoted as MCM (Mobil 

Composition of Matter)[54,55] and SBA (Santa Barbara amorphous)[54,55] materials are the 

most known PMSs.[50,55] PMSs and PMOs can have different shapes and pore sizes 

depending on the choice of the structured directing agent (SDA) and reaction conditions (pH, 

temperature, reaction time and precursors). Many similarities are found between the 

synthetic procedures of PMOs, SBAs and MCMs.[55] Their formation occurs through 

hydrolysis and condensation of the silica precursors around the supra-molecular assembly 

formed from a wide range of anionic and cationic surfactants, or gemini or triblock 

copolymers or oligomers under basic, acid or neutral conditions.[56,57] The porous material 

can be obtained by hydrothermal treatment or evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA),[50] 

and the free porosity is achieved through surfactant removal by solvent extraction in acidic 

media or calcination.[54] Two different mechanisms were proposed to explain the formation 

of these materials as presented in Figure 1.4. The first is a true liquid-crystal templating 

(TLCT) mechanism, which is observed in the absence of inorganic species under very high 



Chapter 1

concentrations of the surfactant (Figure 1.4a).[57–59] The second mechanism occurs at low 

concentration of template, and involves the formation of the lyotropic liquid-crystalline 

phase by self-assembly cooperation of the template and inorganic precursor. This one is 

designed as cooperative liquid crystal template (CLCT) mechanism (Figure 1.4b). The 

formation of the porous material via TLCT or CLCT is still a matter of scientific debate but 

recent computational studies support the latter (please refer to Ref. [60] and references 

therein).

Besides a narrow distribution of the pore sizes and are higly ordered, PMSs present very 

interesting properties such as large specific surface areas, and  as they possess a large number 

of free silanols, they can be easily modified to incorporate functional groups for the desired 

application. 

 
1.3.1 Introduction of functional groups into porous materials 

MCMs and SBAs have been largely applied in catalysis and adsorption, using polymeric, 

inorganic, organic and organometallic hosts into the pores.[41] The combination of inorganic 

and organic functionalities can be made through i) grafting or ii) co-condensation 

reaction.[63] In this way, the PMS materials can be tuned to obtain different polarities and/or 

new reaction centers. 

 
1.3.2 Post-grafting functionalization of parent silica materials 

The grafting[45] takes place when an organic silylated precursor (with a formula 

(R’O)3Si-R) is added to the parent silica and reacts with the free silanols, Figure 1.6. Other 

precursors can be used to modify the silica materials, such as chlorosilanes (ClSiR3), long-

chain alcohols and silazanes (HNSiR3).[57,58,63,64] Hence, a variety of organic groups, from 

acid to basic functionalities, can also be introduced inside the pores by changing the nature 

of the R groups in the material. 

 

Figure 1.6. Functionalization of the PMS materials with terminal organosilanes using the grafting 
method. R is the organic function. 
 



Chapter 1

Although, the grafting typically leads to a decrease of specific surface area depending on 

both content and size of the group introduced. A drawback of the grafting technique is related 

with the diffusion of the species inside the pores since pore blockage may occur, especially 

when bulky species are used, reacting preferentially at the extremities of the channels. 

Moreover, heterogeneous distribution of the introduced organic moieties tends to arise from 

the grafting method[57] and the thermal stability of the materials is usually affected by the 

introduction of the organic moieties. 

 
1.3.3 Co-condensation synthesis 

An alternative process for the incorporation of functional groups into PMSs is the  

co-condensation reaction. The functionalities are introduced in the material during the 

synthesis by adding to the silica precursor a terminal trialkoxysilanes (R’O)3Si-R, where R 

is the organic group. The hydrolysis and condensation of the two precursors takes place in 

the presence of SDA under basic, acid or neutral conditions.[57,58,63,64] The resulting material 

displays organic groups distributed along the pore walls, Figure 1.7. The advantages of the 

co-condensation reaction when compared to the grafting methodology are the absence of 

pore blocking and bulkier organic groups and higher loading of organics can be introduced 

in the material. As a result, functional groups are usually more homogeneously distributed 

in the framework. 

 

Figure 1.7. Co-condensation synthesis of Si(OR’’)4 with organosilanes precursors in the presence of 
SDA. R is the organic function.

However, the mesostructure order of the material is affected when the concentration of the 

organic precursors increases by more than 40 mol%. High contents of organic functions also 

can promote the reduction of the specific surface areas and originate broad pore-size 

distributions, which limit the shape, size and selectivity of these materials.[17] Moreover, a 

huge increase of the terminal organic silanes leads to different rates in the hydrolysis and 

condensations of different precursors favoring the homocondensation reaction of both 

precursors. [17] When this takes place the homogenous distribution of the precursor can be 

hardly achieved. In this synthetic approach the SDA removal must be done by extraction.[57] 

As in the case of the grafting, co-condensation method can be used to prepare organic-

inorganic hybrid silicas incorporating a vast range of organic functionalities under well-

chosen synthetic conditions. 

 

1.4 Crystal-like periodic mesoporous organosilicas (PMOs) 

As organic functionalized PMSs present several drawbacks, such as low organic content 

(less than 20%), reduced specific surface area, heterogeneity, potential leaching of organic 

species during application, PMOs appear as an interesting alternative to PMSs since the 

organic moieties are important elements of the skeleton of the material. The most dramatic 

change between the synthetic strategies of PMS and PMO materials is the use of a 

bissilylated organic precursor in the latter, instead of a pure inorganic silica source in the 

former. The organic moiety in the case of PMOs is strategically placed between the silicon 

atoms in order to directly integrate the wall of the material, keeping the pore channel free 

for potential applications.[41–43] Still, it is important to note that the distribution of functional 

groups in the walls of PMO materials is quite uniform while in the case of functionalized 

PMS materials, the functional groups essentially appear at the surface of the material.[41–43] 

Despite the high concentration of organic groups, PMOs usually present high thermal 

stability. This occurs due to the intercalation of organic/inorganic groups in the pore walls, 

enhancing the stability of the material. 

A large number of bissilylated precursors has been used to prepare PMOs with different 

textural, physical and chemical characteristics with some examples being shown in  

Figure 1.8.  

Studies in the field not only aim the synthesis of novel PMOs based on new bissilylated 

precursors, but also aspire the modification of the known precursors to improve properties 



Chapter 1

of these materials. Despite the appearance of numerous reports in the literature showing that 

PMOs bring important advantages when compared to other commercial materials, PMOs 

have not yet been introduced into the commercial market. The properties of these materials 

in some cases (for example for microelectronics) bring numerous advantages when 

compared to alternative products already under commercialization. However, the high price 

required to produce PMOs is a major drawback. 

 
 
Figure 1.8. Structures of typical bissilylated precursors used to prepare PMOs. 
 

For catalysis and adsorption applications, the properties of these materials are not yet the 

desirable ones having into account the high price when compared with those of alternative 

materials under use. Tuning the properties of PMOs for adsorption applications was the 

ultimate objective of this PhD Thesis. This was done by considering several synthetic 

procedures to introduce the desired functionalities into the materials, which were selected 

by previous analysis of the literature. A short review of the most remarkable advances in the 

field is provided below, together with suggested ways to improve the characteristics of 

PMOs, with special attention for materials prepared from nitrogen source precursors. 

 
1.4.1 Single source precursor 

Ozin et al.[41] described the synthesis of the ethene-PMO by hydrolysis and condensation of 

1,2-bis(triethoxysilyl)ethene (BTEE) in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide 

(CTAB) under aqueous basic conditions. The free pores were obtained by solvent extraction. 

The ethene-PMO displayed well-ordered hexagonal mesostructure (Table 1.2) and high 



Chapter 1 

13 

 

surface area (637 m2·g-1). Then, the ethene bridge was brominated, rendering further 

chemical transformations readily accessible. 

Inagaki et al.[42] reported the preparation of the ethane-PMO using as bissilylated precursor 

the 1,2-bis(trimethoxysilyl)ethane (BTME). The variation of the synthesis conditions 

(varying the proportion of the reagents, the ageing time and the hydrothermal time) led to 

the formation of two materials, one possessing 2D hexagonal mesophase and the other 

displaying 3D hexagonal mesophase, Table 1.2.[42]

Stein et al.[43] also synthetized the ethane-PMO material but using different reaction 

conditions, such as pH, stirring time, reagents concentrations, and in the absence of 

hydrothermal treatment. The same authors also obtained the ethylene-PMO (a.k.a. ethene-

PMO) with wormlike channels having uniform diameter.[43] Interestingly, the materials 

prepared by Stein and co-workers[43] were not as ordered as the materials prepared by 

Inagaki[42] and Ozin[41] groups, which suggests that the reaction conditions used to prepare 

these materials have huge influence in the mesostructures obtained. Ozin et al.[70] reported 

the preparation of phenylene- (Ph-), thiophene-, ferrocene-, bithiophene- and acetylene-

PMOs. Despite the attempts in changing the synthetic conditions to obtain well-ordered 

materials, these authors could only prepare the Ph- and the thiophene-PMO with 2D 

hexagonal symmetry mesophase. The ferrocene- and the bithiophene-PMOs displayed poor 



Chapter 1 

14 

 

order, while the acetylene-PMO was difficult to control under aqueous media since it 

presented labile Si–C bonds. 

In 2002, Inagaki and co-workers[51] synthetized, for the first time, a Ph-PMO showing meso- 

and molecular-scale periodicities. The Ph-PMO possesses a 2D p6mm symmetry lattice and 

a structural periodicity in the wall along the channel direction with a spacing of 7.6 Å, Table 

1.2. In addition, these authors were able to sulfonate the aromatic benzene groups, paving 

the way for further synthetic modifications in these materials. In the same year, Inagaki et 

al.[65] also reported the preparation of p-biphenylene-PMO (Bph-PMO) using a similar 

synthesis procedure. Bph-PMO also displayed meso- and molecular-scale (interlayer 

spacing of 11.9 Å) periodicities and 2D hexagonal structure. Recently, Comotti et al.[71] 

demonstrated that this material stands out for its ability to present rotation motion. Through 

nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy the authors proved the dynamic behavior 

and verified the existence of parallel and aligned molecular rotors along the mesochannel 

axes. 

Ha and co-workers[66] synthetized a non-ordered PMO with basic functionalities by 

condensation of bis[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]amine (BTMSPA) using P123 under acidic 

conditions, Table 1.2. The BTMSPA-PMO displayed hydrophilic silicate layers and it was 

tested, together with Ph-PMO and Bph-PMO materials, in the adsorption of lysozyme. They 

found that the amine moieties of the BTMSPA-PMO material did not interact with the 

lysozyme, and preferential lysozyme-PMO interaction was observed for the Ph-PMO and 

Bph-PMO, wich displayed hydrophobicity superior to BTMSPA-PMO. But, the interaction 

was suggested to be related also with the silanols groups as displayed by the different loading 

in each material. In fact, the BTMSPA-PMO only possesses 30% free silanols groups against 

about 70% of free silanols observed in the other PMOs. Therefore, in order to obtain 

additional information about the preferential interaction mechanism, the same authors[72] 

reported the use of these three materials in the adsorption of L-lysine (strong hydrophilicity), 

isoleucine (strong hydrophobicity) and glycine (intermediate character, i.e., weak 

hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties). L-lysine was mainly adsorbed by BTMSPA-PMO, 

while isoleucine adsorbed more into Bph-PMO. Although, glycine was preferentially 

adsorbed by hydrophobic Ph- and Bph-PMOs in comparison to BTMSPA-PMO. The authors 

showed the importance of electrostatic interactions between PMOs and the adsorbed amino 

acids; they observed that the maximum amount of amino acid adsorbed occurs in the 



Chapter 1 

15 

 

isoelectric point of the amino acid. Furthermore, the pore size diameter of the materials also 

had significant contribution in the adsorption of the amino acids. More recently, Ha and  

co-workers[73] explored the capability of these three PMOs to adsorb nicotine from aqueous 

solution. The nicotine exhibits hydrophobic character being strongly adsorbed by Ph-PMO 

and, as in the case of the amino acids, it was observed a strong dependence between 

adsorption properties and isoelectric point and hydrophobicity of the PMOs. 

Duan et al.[67] prepared a PMO material based on [3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]-

ethylenediamine (TMSEN) precursor in the presence of non-ionic P123 surfactant and water. 

The disordered material presented a BET surface area of 310 m2·g-1 and an average pore 

diameter of 107 Å (c.f. Table 1.2). They tested the TMSEN-PMO material in heavy metal 

ion removal from water (ultra-pure water). The adsorbent showed high adsorption capacity 

for CuII (1.2 mmol·g-1) and PbII (1.3 mmol·g-1) ions and could be reused for several times 

without minimal loss of its capacity as an adsorbent. Additionally, high selectivity for CuII 

over NiII and CoII was found, which turns this material a potential candidate for wastewater 

treatment, drinking water purification and soil remediation. 

Beretta et al.[68] prepared divinylaniline organic bridging PMO (BTEVA-PMO) with 2D 

hexagonal mesostructure, with three reflections indexed having Miller indices (100), (110) 

and (200) and with a unit cell dimension of 47.8 Å, Table 1.2. Additionally to the meso-

ordering of the pores, this PMO also presents crystal-like pore walls with a molecular-scale 

periodicity of 11.8 Å. This material has specific surface area of 900 m2·g-1 and a pore 

diameter of 28 Å. The access of the amino group in the aniline moieties of the BTEVA-PMO 

to further modifications was tested through chemical functionalization of the amine group 

with the amino-acid L-alanine by formation of an amide bond. Thus, the authors 

demonstrated that BTEVA-PMO is a good candidate for the formation of oligopeptides 

within the pores. 

In 2015, Mizoshita and Inagaki[69] prepared a new PMO (CHTC-PMO) with  

N,N',N''-tris(3-triethoxysilylpropyl) cis,cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetricarboxamide precursor 

(CHTC) in the presence of octadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (ODTMA) surfactant 

under basic conditions. The prepared functional material showed both meso- and molecular-

scale orders. The authors only observed a strong (100) reflection in powder X-ray 

diffractometer (PXRD), but using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) they observed 

some PMO areas with 2D hexagonal packing and a lattice constant of 62.0 Å (d = 53.6 Å), 



Chapter 1 

16 

 

Table 1.2. The authors also observed the molecular-scale periodicity along the channel 

direction with a lattice constant of 16.5 Å (d = 14.3 Å). Thus, the CHTC-PMO presents both 

meso- and molecular-scale orders and this was possible due to the high self-assembly 

behavior of the precursor. Additionally, the authors found that the pore walls of this material 

could bind strongly silane-free guest molecules through H-bonded intercalation. This fact is 

very interesting due to the potential combination of H-bonded intercalation with chemical 

modification of silanol groups for constructing multifunctional PMOs. 

Kuschel and Polarz[74] developed a new PMO with increased chemical versatility, containing 

brominated-phenylene moieties that can be accessible to further modification reactions. To 

prepare such material these authors started from a new precursor, 5-bis(triisopropoxysilyl)-

3-bromobenzene, in the presence of Pluronic F123 triblock copolymer in ethanol under 

acidic conditions. Beside the efforts to obtain a material with ordered pores, they could only 

obtain a bromine-phenylene-PMO with worm-like ordering. 

Bion et al.[75] considered different SDAs (alkyltrimethylammonium halides) to obtain  

Ph-PMO materials with 2D hexagonal mesostructure, but with different pore sizes. They 

observed that changing the alkyl-chain of the surfactant resulted in Ph-PMOs presenting 

different physical and textural properties. The alkyl-chain of the surfactants varied from 

fourteen to eighteen carbons. The surfactant with the biggest alkyl-chain promoted the 

formation of a Ph-PMO with large pore size, Table 1.3.

Recently, Kalantzopoulos et al.[77] prepared ordered and disordered mesoporous phenylene-

silica and tested their ability to uptake and storage hydrogen. The authors found that the 



Chapter 1 

17 

 

phenylene-PMO materials with 2D hexagonal pore order and varied pore sizes present a 

specific surface area between 640 and 782 m2·g-1, while the disordered phenylene-silica 

materials have specific surface areas between 650 and 910 m2·g-1. It was observed that the 

materials exhibit a reversible hydrogen excess surface adsorption capacity up to 2.10 wt% 

at 6 MPa and 77 K and the increase of the alkyl length of the surfactant seems to increase 

the hydrogen molecules on the adsorbent. Additionally, a direct correlation between physical 

properties of the prepared materials and the hydrogen adsorption behavior was found. For 

the case of the phenylene-PMOs, the authors observed an increase of the hydrogen capacity 

with the increase of the specific surface area, while the hydrogen capacity of the disordered 

mesoporous phenylene-silica adsorbents increases with the increase of pore volume and pore 

size. 

Fröba et al.[76] also prepared the Ph- and the thiophene-PMO with different pore sizes but 

extremely ordered. The authors promoted the hydrolysis and the condensation of the 

precursors (1,4-bis(triethoxysilyl)benzene, BTEB, or 2,5-bis(triethoxysilyl)thiophene, 

BTET) in the presence of P123 and Brij 76 copolymers as SDA under acidic conditions. 

Ordered materials with 2D hexagonal (p6mm) mesoporous structures were formed. It was 

possible to control the pore sizes by changing the SDA. The P123 promoted the formation 

of PMOs with pore sizes larger than those obtained with Brij 76. P123 led to larger pore 

sizes when the organic moiety of the bissilylated precursor is changed from thiophene to 

phenylene, Table 1.3. With Brij 76, the size of the pores remained unchanged independently 

of the precursor used. So, the consideration of different bissilylated precursors, SDAs and 

reaction conditions (e.g. pH and temperature) allows the preparation of novel PMOs with 

different chemical, physical and textural properties.  

Other developments to create PMOs with advanced functional bridges have been reported 

in the last few years.[50] These are the cases of the inclusion of heteroatoms such as N, S and 

P, or of moieties such as metal complexes, metal nanoparticles or chiral bridges for creating 

materials with high ?-? conjugation and/or different hydrophobic/hydrophilic character, for 

adsorption and catalysis applications.[50] 

There are three different methodologies to make possible the introduction of advanced 

functional groups into the channels of the PMOs: i) co-condensation, ii) organic bridge post-

synthetic modification and iii) grafting reaction. These three approaches are described 

below.

1.4.2 Co-condensation reaction 

Co-condensation synthesis allows the combination of two or more different mono- or 

bissilylated organic precursors to produce PMOs with functionalities well distributed into 

the matrix of the material, Figure 1.9. 

 

Figure 1.9. Schematic representation of functionalized-PMOs synthetized via co-condensation 
reaction. R, R’, R’’ represent different organic functions. 
 

In 2002, Inagaki et al.[78] showed for the first time the preparation of a PMO with acidic 

functionalities using the co-condensation reaction. The novel material was obtained by 

combination of BTEB and 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTMS) in the presence of 

ODTMA under basic conditions. It presented the meso- and molecular-scale observed for  

Ph-PMO material. The authors varied the proportion of the precursors and found that, as the 

MPTMS amount increased, the degree of the mesoscopic order decreased. The 2D hexagonal 

arrangement of the pores was only well observed at 0.40 mol% of MPTMS, presenting  

0.30 mmol·g-1 of H+, Table 1.4. Materials with 0.70 mmol·g-1 of H+ content were also 

obtained, but the mesostructure was perturbed. Moreover, the reduction of both surface area 

and pore diameter was observed with increasing acid content. After nitric acid treatment, the 

oxidation of the thiol group was observed with formation of the sulfonic acid group. The 

formed material, Ph-PMO_PrSO3H, possessed thermal stability up to 300 °C. The oxidation 

of the thiol group led to a decrease of surface area and pore diameter, and also to a reduction 

of the organization degree of the pores mesostructure. The final PMO conjugated the 



Chapter 1 

19 

 

molecular-scale periodicity with the flexibility of the sulfonic arms. Other bissilylated 

precursors with biphenylene[79] and ethane[80,81] bridges where reacted with MPTMS to give 

rise to materials with 2D hexagonal arrangement and different degrees of hydrophobicity, 

thermal stability and flexibility in the framework structure. These materials were tested in 

water-generating reactions. Moreover, different SDA, as for instance, cationic alkyl 

surfactant[80] and triblock copolymers,[81] were employed to obtain such acid functionalized 

ordered materials.

Recently, Bispo et al.[82] described the catalytic efficiency of Ph-PMO_PrSO3H (prepared 

with different acid loadings), Bph-PMO_PrSO3H and SO3H-Ph-PMO in the dehydration of 

fructose to HMF (5-hydroxymethylfurfural) in water. The authors found that the catalytic 

activity of these materials relies on: i) the density of the sulfonic groups; ii) the location of 

the sulfonic sites and iii) the hydrophobicity of the surface. The material that presented the 

highest activity had phenylene moieties in the pore walls, propyl sulfonic sites grafted to the 

silanols of the Ph-PMO and an acid loading of 0.36 mmol·g-1. 

Materials showing basic functionalities in the framework of the PMOs were also reported in 

the past few years. In 2006, Wahab et al.[83] reported the formation of well-defined 2D 

hexagonal order PMOs fibers when BTEE was mixed with 1-[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl] 

urea (UREDO) or (3-triethoxysilylpropyl) isocyanate (ICP) in the presence of CTAB/Brij30 

surfactant mixture under basic conditions (Table 1.5, Et-PMO_UREDO and Et-PMO_ICP). 

They showed the influence of the amount of the nitrogen containing precursor in the 

formation of the PMOs meso-scale order. Disordered materials were formed with molar 

percentages of nitrogen precursors higher than 25 mol%. The basic nature of UREDO or ICP 

precursors led to an increase of the pH during the synthesis, which hindered the organization 

of the micelles in a 2D-hexagonal arrangement. The influence of the reaction temperature 

on the formation and the internal pore architecture was also observed. The change of the 



Chapter 1

reaction temperature from 55 to 75 °C originated pore channels aligned parallel to fiber axis 

with hexagonal arrangement. Li et al.[84] synthetized the aminopropyl-functionalized ethane-

bridged PMO (Ethane-PMO_APTES) with spherical morphology and cubic Pm3n meso-

order, Table 1.5. The Ethane-PMO_APTES was achieved by co-condensation of  

1,2-bis(triethoxysilyl)ethane (BTSE) and aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) in the 

presence of ODTMA surfactant and methanol as co-solvent in basic medium. The authors 

observed that methanol was crucial in the formation of spherical morphology and that the 

particle size could be tuned through variation of the aging temperature and time. This 

material showed a good mechanical and chemical stability, a specific surface area of  

765 m2·g-1 and a pore diameter of 40.9 Å. This material was tested in liquid chromatographic 

separation and compared to a commercial APS-2 HYPERSIL NH2 column. The authors 

tested the separation of benzene derivatives (toluene, biphenyldimethylesterate and 

nitrobenzene) at different flow rates, the separation of metronidazole, fluconazole and 

isonicotinic acid under high pH mobile phase (pH 11.8), and the separation of matrine and 

oxymatrine, sophocarpine and N-oxysophocarpine, under low pH mobile phase (pH 1.6). 

They found that the Ethane-PMO_APTES has a high chemical stability in a wide pH range 

and the order of the peaks is the same as in the case of the commercial NH2 column for all 

separations.

authors concluded that the performance of this material makes it a potential candidate to 

satisfy more rigorous needs in chromatographic analysis. 

Recently, Suriyanon et al.[85] prepared three amine-functionalized PMOs via  

co-condensation reaction of BTSE and (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (APTMS), 

[3-(2-aminoethylamino)propyl]trimethoxysilane, (APAETMS) and 

3-[2-(2-aminoethylamino)ethylamino]propyltrimethoxysilane (APAEAETMS) in the 

presence of CTAB under basic conditions. Besides the number of amines in the amino-

organosilane precursor, the amount of these precursors were also varied between 10 and 40 

mol%. All prepared materials presented a hexagonal order of the pores and a high Brunauer–

Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area (between 963 and 1230 m2·g-1). Table 1.5 shows the 

physical properties of the amine modified-PMOs prepared with 40 mol% of amine-

precursor. The authors observed that the amount of nitrogen on the amine-functionalized 

PMOs augmented with the molecular size and the concentration of the amino-organosilanes 

used. The increase of the latter parameter also promoted the growth of the wall thickness 

and the contraction of the unit cell. Suriyanon and co-workers[85] indorsed the latter behavior 

to the decrease of the pore size diameter and suggested that the changes in the physical and 

textural properties were related to the hydrogen bonding ability of the amine-functional 

groups around the micelles of the surfactant. 

Coutinho et al.[86] reported the synthesis of Ph-PMOs containing propylamine, 

propylethylenediamine, and propyldihydroimidazole groups in the framework by  

co-condensation reaction in the presence of ODTMA surfactant (Table 1.5,  

Ph-PMO_APTMS, Ph-PMO_EDATMS and Ph-PMO_ImTES, respectively). These three 

amine-PMOs displayed both meso- and molecular-scale up to 10 mol% of functional groups. 

When the amine functional precursor loading increased above that value, the mesoscopic 

order was lost, while the molecular periodicity was maintained. This study showed the 

difficulty to prepare PMOs with both high amine-loadings into the framework pore wall and 

high mesopores order. 

 
1.4.3 Organic bridge post-synthetic modification 

The organic post-synthetic modification involves a transformation of the organic bridge after 

the PMO synthesis, Figure 1.10. 



Chapter 1 

22 

 

 

Figure 1.10. Schematic representation of post-synthesis modification of the organic bridges of 
PMOs. R and R’ are different organic functions. 
 

The modification of the organic bridges in the PMO materials was successfully attained 

immediately after Stein et al.,[43] Inagaki et al.[42] and Ozin et al.[41] reported the preparation 

of the first PMOs. Stein and Ozin and their co-workers showed the bromination of the 

ethylene moieties and the opportunity to tune the properties of PMOs for a given 

application.[41,43] The insertion of a bromine group into the bridge of PMOs enables the 

incorporation of many other functional groups since bromine is a very good leaving group. 

Nakai et al.[87] reported the bromine addition and successive ethylenediamine (EDA) 

substitution of the ethylene bridge in the ethylene-PMO, Table 1.6. The authors 

demonstrated that the bromination reaction had little influence on the 2D hexagonal 

mesostructure. In contrast, the reaction with EDA leads to an extensive modification of the 

mesostructure with perturbation of the pores hexagonal arrangement. The authors also 

reported the synthesis of other PMO materials by direct substitution of EDA with chloro-

propyl-ethane resulting in the Cl-Pr-Et-PMO material. The latter presented only a broad low-

angle diffraction peak in the PXRD patterns (Table 1.6) and the substitution of chloride by 

EDA did not affect the structure of this material, which was subsequently tested in the 

adsorption of arsenate from water. The authors observed that the distance between the amine 

functional group and the surface of the pore walls had influence in the adsorption of the 

arsenate. The EDA-Pr-Et-PMO displayed higher capacity in the adsorption of arsenate when 

compared with EDA-Et-PMO due to the distance between the propyl and the silanol groups, 

which prevented the interaction of those groups. 

De Canck et al.[88] reported the bromination of ethylene bridges followed by nucleophilic 

substitution of the bromide by diaminobutane (DAB), diaminohexane (DAH), 

diaminododecane (DADD), diethyltriamine (DETA) and tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA).

By varying the reaction conditions, e.g. temperature and reaction time, different nitrogen

The optimal conditions to attain maximum nitrogen content were room temperature and 

three hours of reaction time. DAB substitution reaction resulted in higher nitrogen content 

than with DADD. The difficulties obtained in the substitution of bromide by DADD were 

suggested to be due to poor diffusion of the dodecane chain within the pores of the PMO. 

Moreover, the nitrogen content of the material is lower for nucleophiles with long alkyl-

chain than for the other cases considered. All amine materials presented clear 2D hexagonal 

mesoporous ordering, with exception of the PMO prepared with the TEPA ligand, which 

exhibited just a single reflection in the PXRD patterns assigned to the (100) of the 2D 

hexagonal arrangement, Table 1.6. The materials also revealed type IV N2 isotherms 

typically observed for mesoporous materials. The authors observed a decrease on the BET 

surface area (SBET), pore volume (Vp) and pore diameter (dp) values upon functionalization, 

which indicates the anchorage of the functional groups inside the pores. These five PMOs 

were tested in the CO2 adsorption with the aim of understanding which of the following 

properties, e.g. nitrogen loading, variation in chain length and the presence of primary and 

secondary amines, was the most important to obtain a good adsorbent for this gas. When 

compared with the aminopropyl functionalized SBA-15, De Canck et al.[88] found that 

DADD-Et-PMO presented slightly higher adsorption efficiency with a CO2/N ratio of 0.42. 

DADD-Et-PMO, with the lowest nitrogen loading (0.33 mmol·g-1), the longest alkyl-chain 

and the smallest amount of secondary amines, seems to be the most interesting PMO for CO2 

adsorption. The reason for the better performance of the latter material was suggested to be 

related with the presence of amines, at optimal distances (hence, optimal amount) from each 

other, so that they could interact simultaneously with the same CO2 molecule. If very large 

amounts of amines are present in the material, hydrogen bonding between neighboring amine 

groups is more probable to occur, which deactivates the amine moieties for CO2 adsorption. 

Additionally, hydrophobic interactions between long alkyl-chains were suggested to avoid 

chain folding, preventing the formation of hydrogen bonding between amines and silanols 

groups; hence, with long alkyl-chain, amines are free to interact with CO2. 

Recently, Esquivel et al.[89] showed the ability of the ethene-PMO to be transformed into 

pyrrole bridge PMOs through Diels-Alder reaction between the former and a family of 

pyrrole derivatives (pyrrole, methylpyrrole, dimethylpyrrole, trimethylpyrrole and  

1-phenylpyrrole). The obtained pyrrole-PMOs displayed the 2D hexagonal arrangement of 

the pores, showing the preservation of the meso-order of the parent ethene-PMO. They also 



Chapter 1 

25 

 

observed reduction in the d spacing value after the chemical modification of the double bond 

of the ethene-PMO, which seems to be associated to the structural contraction as a 

consequence of the thermal conditions used during the Diels-Alder reaction. This 

functionalization process also promoted the reduction of the pore size from 71 Å to 

53-56 Å, which confirms the formation of surface adducts. Additionally, the pore wall 

thickness increased in all cases after the chemical modification of the surface as a 

consequence of the volume occupied by the organic groups introduced. The success of the 

chemical modification of the Et-PMOs was also confirmed by elemental analysis (EA), 
13C NMR and 29Si NMR spectroscopies. 

Horiuchi et al.[90] also modified the ethene-PMO with ethylenediamine (ED) basic sites by 

epoxidation of ethylene moieties of the Et-PMO followed by nucleophilic addition,  

Table 1.6. The resultant ED-Et-PMO, presenting a type IV isotherm and a pore diameter of 

62 Å, was tested as a solid base catalyst in the Knövenagel condensation reaction between 

benzaldehyde and various active methylene compounds. They also produced a material with 

bifunctional catalytic properties by introducing Au nanoparticles into the ED-Et-PMO. The 

obtained Au-ED-Et-PMO displayed a reduction of the pore size to 54 Å, which is in 

agreement with the insertion of gold nanoparticles into the PMO. This material was 

successfully tested on both alcohol oxidation and Knövenagel condensation in a one-pot 

tandem reaction. Horiuchi et al.[90] also prepared a second bifunctional PMO, using the same 

procedure, where the Et-PMO was functionalized with N,N-dimethylethylenediamine 

followed by introduction of Pd nanoparticles into the pores to catalyze the Tsuji–Trost 

reaction. 

In 2002, Inagaki’s research group demonstrated the versatility of the phenylene moieties in 

the Ph-PMO material, through the introduction of functional groups by electrophilic 

substitution attack of the phenylene bridge. They showed that chemical modification was 

possible by post-synthetic sulfonation of the phenylene bridge to offer the 

SO3H-Ph-PMO.[42] In 2008, the same group reported the amination of 28% of phenylene 

moieties of PMO, in a two-step chemical transformation process without destroying both 

meso- and molecular-scales periodicities.[44] The NH2-Ph-PMO was successfully applied in 

the Knövenagel condensation reaction of malononitrile with benzaldehyde. The possibility 

to reutilize this material for further use was also revealed. Moreover the amination of the 



Chapter 1 

26 

 

phenylene moieties provides the possibility to transform the amine group into other 

functional groups. 

In order to make the phenylene-PMO even more appellative to catalysis, sorption, 

scavenging and other applications, Smeulders et al.[91] attempted the bromination of the 

phenylene moieties of the Ph-PMO using different post-modification methodologies. The 

first method used AlCl3 as a catalyst in combination with Br2. The second approach relies in 

the use of N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) as bromine source combined with the radical initiator 

azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN). The third and last procedure pretended to generate bromine, 

in situ, by adding sulfuric acid to sodium bromate (NaBrO3). The authors observed that the 

principles of organic chemistry are not directly transported to nanoporous material science 

as occurred with the sulfonation and nitration reactions modifications of phenylene bridge 

PMOs. The bromination reaction using the NBS and AIBN reagents was not effective, while 

the methods that used Br2 and NaBrO3 as bromine sources promoted the bromination of the 

phenylene moieties of PMO. However, these two last procedures gave rise to a huge amount 

of silicon–carbon bond cleavage and this fact had a destructive effect on the PMO 

framework. 

 
1.4.4 Grafting 

The grafting procedure comprises the chemical modification of the surface free silanols after 

the PMO synthesis through addition of an organosilicate agent, Figure 1.11. 

 
Figure 1.11. Schematic representation of post-synthesis modification of the surface chemistry of 
PMOs via grafting methodology. R and R’’ are different organic functions. 
 

In 2005, Zhang et al.[92] synthetized a bifunctional material by grafting the MPTMS to free 

silanols of the methylene-bridge PMO, previously prepared in the presence of structural 

directing agent P123 under acid conditions. The grafting reaction occurred in the presence 

of toluene under reflux. The resulting material, SH@Me-PMO, preserved the 2D hexagonal 

arrangement of the pores observed in the parent material and the SBET and dp decreased

providing further evidence that the methylene-PMO was efficiently functionalized via 

grafting. It was possible to introduce into the channels 0.8 mmol·g-1 of S content, Table 1.7. 

Dubé et al.[93] prepared the PFSO3H@ethane-PMO, with a loading of 0.8 mmol H+·g-1, by 

grafting reaction of the ethane-PMO with the perfluoroalkylsulfonic acid group. This 

material revealed high catalytic activity in self-condensation of heptanal and heptanal 

acetalization by 1-butanol, but some problems of lixiviation of the organic functionalities 

from the PMO were reported by the authors upon the reutilization of the material.

In 2011, Ph-PMO was functionalized with Mac-Millan catalyst (denoted as Mac@Ph-PMO) 

through grafting of 3-azidopropyl-trimethoxysilane to the silanols of Ph-PMO followed by 

“click chemistry” post-modification with the Mac-Millan catalyst, Table 1.8.[94] This 

material conjugates the hydrophobic surface properties of Ph-PMO to the accessible 

mesopores between the inner and outer surfaces of the hollow structures, which promotes 

the acceleration of the mass-transport process. The material was tested in the Diels-Alder 

cycloaddition of 1,3-cyclopentadiene with trans-cinnamaldehyde and reused several times.

Gomes et al.[95] reported the synthesis of Ph-PMO derivatized with ferrocene to be employed 

in the catalytic oxidation of styrene. This material was obtained by grafting of trimethylsilyl 

(TMS), benzyldimethylsilyl (BzDMS) and dimethylsilyl ferrocene (DMSFc) groups to the 

Ph-PMO, Table 1.8. The insertion of these functional groups along the pore wall channels 

originated a decrease of the intensity of the (100) reflection, a contraction of the unit cell

parameter and reduction of the BET surface area and pore diameter as expected for this type 

of grafting reaction. The success of the chemical modifications was followed by Fourier 

transform infrared (FTIR) and NMR spectroscopies. The DMSFc@Ph-PMOs was tested as 

solid catalyst in the oxidation of styrene and presented moderate activity and high selectivity. 

Recently, Sim et al.[96] grafted alkyl amine functionalities (APTES, APAETMS and ImTES) 

onto the silanols of phenylene-bridged PMO and of SBA-15. Ph-PMOs based materials 

possess a unit cell parameter in the range of 116.0 and 126.7 Å, while the values determined 

for the amine-modified SBA-15 are in the range of 116.0 and 118.9 Å. All amine-

functionalized materials preserved the hexagonal order of the mesopores of the parent-

PMOs. The amine-functionalized Ph-PMO and silica were tested in the adsorption of pure 

CO2 at 25 °C in a pressure range up to 1.2 atm. The authors observed that the 

APAETMS@Ph-PMO (see physical properties in Table 1.8) adsorbs a larger amount of CO2 

at a faster adsorption rate when compared with APAETMS@SBA-15, which demonstrates 

that the functionalization of PMOs with amines is more relevant than a similar degree and 

nature of functionalization in pure silica for the adsorption of CO2. Interestingly, the 

unmodified SBA-15 silica also adsorbs a smaller amount of CO2 when compared with the 

unmodified PMO. This behavior was explained by the higher hydrophobicity of the PMO 

pore wall when compared with that of SBA-15. Hence, water adsorption is expected to be 

more acute in SBA-15 than in PMO materials, competing more with CO2 for available 

adsorption sites on the former class of materials, so, organosilica instead of pure silica 

supports were proposed for immobilization of amines groups aiming materials for CO2 

adsorption/separation. Despite the fact that PMOs are more expensive than silica, the 

superior ability of amine modified PMOs to adsorb CO2 can be transferred and should be 

explored for such applications. 

In summary, the introduction of acidic or basic groups into the PMO frameworks can be 

made using different methods. The post-functionalization methodologies have been given 

much attention due to the opportunity to introduce interesting functionalities onto the surface 

of the pores, and to create different degrees of porosity in the materials, without affecting 

significantly the arrangement of the pores. Additionally, the possibility to extend typical 

homogeneous phase reactions to functionalize hybrid materials has been successfully 

reported in the literature and opens an avenue to tune the materials properties for new 

applications. The co-condensation of different bissilylated precursors can offer novel PMOs 



Chapter 1 

29 

 

with better performances that those prepared by post-modified materials, due to the 

introduction of the functionality as part of the PMO framework, remaining the pores free for 

the desired application. The development of acid- or amine-PMO materials with optimal 

features for different applications needs to take into account several different factors, such 

as, functional group loading, surface area, pore volume and pore size, distances between 

functional groups and between functional groups and silanols, and the 

hydrophilic/hydrophobic character of the framework. 

As it is understood from Section 1.2, the presence of amines is mostly a requisite in the 

preparation of adsorbents for biogas upgrading. Thus, besides the factors described above, 

the tuning of the PMOs properties must also have into account the nature of the amino groups 

to maximize interactions with CO2. The ideal PMO adsorbent must be chemically stable and 

reused in multiple adsorption-desorption cycles. Despite the interest of PMOs for biogas 

upgrading, no literature was found for the preparation and utilization of PMOs in the 

separation of CO2 and CH4. There are only, two studies where amine modified-PMOs were 

tested in the CO2 adsorption. 

Table 1.9 summarizes the nitrogen containing PMOs previously described and their possible 

applications. The presentation of these materials is made through type of synthesis used: 

condensation, post-synthesis modification of the organic bridge, co-condensation and 

grafting reaction.

1.5 Computational studies 

In the last years, modern computational methodologies were used to support the 

interpretation of experimental data regarding the structure of PMOs and to advance the 

understanding of their adsorption and catalytic features. Most studies used approaches based 

on the density functional theory (DFT) together with small, finite size, molecular models 
[97–102] but, more recently, studies appeared in the literature relying on classical molecular 

dynamics (MD) approaches[103] or models repeated periodically in three-dimensions[103–105]. 

The computational studies also focused on the primer steps of the synthesis of PMO 

materials, i.e., the interaction between silica monomers or small oligomers and their 

condensation in order to produce organosilica. 

Shirai et al.[101] studied the cleavage of Si-C bond in various organosilane precursors  

(Figure 1.12), with general structure RSi(OH)3, by DFT calculations. Considering the 

B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) methodology the authors determined the proton affinities of the 

carbon atom at the ipso-position and of the carbanion produced after Si-C bond cleavage in 

the precursors.

b) terphenyl, c) biphenyl, d) anthranyl, e) naphthyl and f) N-methylcarbazolyl. Adapted from 
reference [101]. 
 

The selection of the proton affinities at these two sites was taken as they act as indices for 

the stability of Si-C bond in the presence of acidic and basic conditions, respectively. The 

obtained computational and experimental results were found to be in qualitative agreement. 

The authors observed that the terphenyl and N-methylcarbaxole R groups are the least stable 

under acidic conditions, and the terphenyl and anthranyl R groups are the least stable under

basic conditions. Curiously, the cleavage of Si-C bond was observed experimentally for 

these cases, while the Si-C bond in the other precursors was stronger. Accordingly, the 

computational study confirmed that the reaction giving rise to the cleavage of Si-C bond, 

under acid conditions, results via formation of ?-complex by introduction of H+ at the carbon 

atom at the ipso-position in the organosilane precursors, (Figure 1.13a). The cleavage of  

Si-C bond, under basic conditions, occurs through generation of the intermediate complex, 

where the OH– species links directly the Si atom of the organosilane precursors  

(Figure 1.13b).

Very Recently, Sánchez et al.[60] developed a theoretical model to understand the synthesis 

mechanism of PMS that is believed to be similar to that of the PMOs. This study was made 

using a multiscale simulation strategy to describe the molecular-level routes behind the 

construction of silica/cationic surfactant mesophases during the preparation of templated 

MCM-41 materials. The authors considered a new coarse-grained explicit-solvent model for 

the synthesis solution with coarse-grained parameters for silicate species tuned with 

reference to a detailed atomistic model[106,107] that was derived from quantum mechanical 

calculations.[108,109] The usage of a coarse-grained approach allowed to reach the time and 

the length scales required for the spontaneous formation of mesophase structures with a 

realism that enables direct comparison with experimental systems. Sánchez and  

co-workers[60] observed that at low-concentration surfactant solution, the silica oligomers 

present an important factor in the formation of hexagonal arrangement of the pores. The 

silica oligomers present multiple negative charges and are capable to connect to adjacent 

micelles through the head-group areas, acting as multidentate binding spots. This was found 



Chapter 1 

33 

 

to be crucial for micelle overcoming their mutual repulsion, due to the positively charged 

head-groups, to create larger surfactant aggregates. This fact promotes the separation of the 

system into a dilute solution and a concentrated silica/surfactant ordered mesophase, as 

observed experimentally. In the case of addition of silica monomers to a low-concentration 

surfactant solution, these authors observed that the small spherical micelles are fused to form 

elongated rod-like aggregates, but the presence of monomers only is not enough to form an 

HLC phase. For occurrence of phase formation it was necessary at least 15-33% of silicate 

oligomers either in the form of dimers or larger silicate species. Without changing any 

parameter in the model, they could find different mesophase structures by changing the 

charge density of the silicate oligomers, either by increasing their degree of condensation or 

their degree of deprotonation. For instance, with oligomers displaying high silica charge 

density, the curvature of the mesophase structures is reduced and a lamellar system is 

obtained. The degree of flexibility of the mesophase could also be modified by changing the 

composition of the synthesis solution; for instance, by addition/removal of a co-solvent (e.g. 

benzene) to the solution, it was possible to describe the reversibility of the hexagonal phase 

to lamellar structure as observed experimentally.[110] 

Futamura et al.[103] studied the effect of the nature of the organic linker in the early stages of 

the templated synthesis of PMO materials. They considered a classical MD approach to 

simulate the surfactant–bromide–water solutions with several different organosilicate 

precursors based on 1,4-bis(triethoxysilyl)benzene, 1,2-bis(triethoxysilyl)ethylene or  

1,2-bis(triethoxysilyl)ethane (Figure 1.8). The choice of these three precursors was made 

having into account different degrees of molecular-scale periodicity found in the materials 

synthetized experimentally: high degree, low degree, and no molecular-scale periodicity, 

respectively.[51] Futamura et al.[103] observed that the presence or absence of the molecular-

scale periodicity in the pore walls of PMOs is defined by tight interaction between the 

surfactant micelle and the organosilica and by a certain flexibility and orientation of the 

organic linker. Experimentally, it was found that the PMOs prepared using the  

1,1-bis(triethoxysilyl)methane and 1,2-bis(triethoxysilyl)ethane precursors, did not present 

molecular-scale periodicity, and this fact could be explained by the size of the organic linker 

and the strength of the interaction between the precursor molecules when compared with the 

phenylene- and ethylene-PMOs.[51] In addition, the presence of molecular-scale periodicity 

was endorsed to the surfactant mesostructure. Notice, however, that phenylene- and 



Chapter 1 

34 

 

biphenyl- PMOs with high degree of molecular scale periodicity were prepared without the 

presence of surfactants.[111] The classical MD simulations by Futamura et al.[103] considered 

systems composed of water, decyltrimethylammonium surfactants and deprotonated 

organosilicates obtained from 1,4-bis(triethoxysilyl)benzene, 1,2-bis(triethoxysilyl)ethylene 

or 1,2-bis(triethoxysilyl)ethane. The results demonstrated that the organic and inorganic 

fragments of the benzenesilicates and of the ethylenesilicates were evidently introduced 

between the cationic surfactant head-groups in the micelles, while in the case of 

ethanesilicates, only the inorganic part interacted with the surface of the micelle. 

Remarkably, this leads to the construction of micelles taking more surfactants (i.e., larger 

amount of average micelle size along the simulation) in the former cases comparatively to 

the latter. These interpretations can be associated to a more efficient screening of the 

surfactant head-group repulsion, which stimulates the reduction of the curvature of the 

surface and therefore the formation of bigger micelles.[103] Futamura et al.[103] found also 

that the ordering of the organosilicates in the solutions with benzenesilicates or 

ethylenesilicates, was much superior when comparing to the organosilicates organization of 

the solution with ethanesilicates. Such differences were related to the way how the 

organosilicates are oriented relatively to the micelles. In the cases of the solutions with 

benzenesilicates or ethylenesilicates, the silicate-organic-silicate axis approximated parallel 

to the micelle surface, while ethanesilicates prefer to orient their silicate-organic-silicate axis 

perpendicularly to the surface, which was suggested to be a possible cause for the inferior 

ordering of the synthetized materials with the ethane linker. In this way, the presence or 

absence of the periodicity of the molecular order along the channel direction was suggested 

to be highly dependent of the interactions between surfactant micelles and organosilicates 

and the relative flexibility and orientation of the organic moieties, i.e., organosilicates with 

less flexibility interacted strongly with the micelle surface of the surfactant, leading to the 

preparation of PMOs with higher degrees of molecular-scale periodicity when compared to 

PMO materials synthetized using more flexible organo-bridged silicates that interacted 

weakly with the surfactant micelles surface.[103] In summary, the studies above suggest that 

the hexagonal-order and the periodicity of the molecular-scale in the pore walls of PMOs 

are defined during the first steps of the templated synthesis process. 

The structure of PMOs can be modeled with cluster or periodic model approaches. The first 

one pretends to study a small portion of the PMO in vacuum and the second one pretends to 



Chapter 1 

35 

 

model an infinite repetition of a suitable unit cell in the three spatial dimensions. Both 

approaches present benefits and drawbacks,[112] and the choice of one or another depends on 

several factors, as for example, computational code and approach, and the property that one 

wants to calculate. 

Density functional theory (DFT) provides a very good compromise between the quality of 

calculated data and the computational resources requirements. Moreover, modern DFT 

approaches can take into account dispersion interactions which affect dramatically weakly 

bonded systems.[112] Since molecular systems like PMO materials are composed of millions 

of atoms, only small portions of the materials, e.g. isolated finite clusters or small unit cells 

repeated periodically, can be used in computer calculations. The simulation of models based 

on large clusters or large unit cells requires the reduction of the complexity of the 

computational approach, either by reducing the quality of the grids used in the calculations 

or by considering less expensive approaches, e.g. semi-empirical or classical methods.[113]  

There are few examples of works based on the application of DFT approaches to study 

PMOs. Onida et al.[97] combined Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) 

spectroscopy and DFT to study the surface properties of the Ph-PMO material, having into 

account both meso- and molecular-scale periodicities. The FTIR and computational studies 

were made in the pristine material and also in the material interacting with CO, H2CO and 

NH3 molecules. The authors used the DFT calculations (achieved at the B3LYP/6-31+G* 

level of theory) to assign the infrared (IR) modes experimentally observed. The calculations 

employing the molecular models represented in Figure 1.14 were used to compare the 

vibrational shifts in Ph-PMOs with those obtained for amorphous silica. 

The assignment of the most important bands in the Raman and IR spectra of Ph-PMO,  

Et-PMO, Bph-PMO and thiophene-PMO throughout DFT calculations was conducted by 

Hoffman et al.[98] also using the B3LYP hybrid approach. The authors found that vibrational 

spectroscopy is unable to provide conclusive observations that can be used to understand the 

integrity of the Si-C bonds in PMO or similar organosilica materials because wavenumber 

shifts change from precursors to the corresponding PMO materials. In this way the modes 

are unpredictable, making each material a single case. Thus, Hoffman and his co-workers 

proposed the use of solid-state NMR for similar studies.[98]  

Theoretical studies are also very useful to understand where functionalization in the organic 

moieties can occur and which are the preferential sites for adsorption in the functionalized- 



Chapter 1 

36 

 

or non-functionalized PMOs. This can be done by comparison of the calculated energies for 

materials having substitutions at different materials or of the calculated energies for 

adsorbates at different locations in the PMO material, respectively. 

Camarota et al.[99] studied the low-temperature adsorption of CO on Ph-PMO by FTIR 

spectroscopy and by theoretical calculations. Again, these authors considered the DFT 

hybrid B3LYP approach, but incorporating dispersion corrections based on the ideas of  

Grimme et al.[114], and the same cluster model employed by Onida et al.[97], which is 

displayed in Figure 1.14.

They observed the presence of three kinds of adsorbed CO molecules at low coverage: the 

first one corresponds to the physisorbed CO, which interacts with the benzene moieties, 

performing as Lewis bases, and with the H-bonded to the silanol group, acting as week Lewis 

acidic centers. The second and the third ones correspond to stronger interactions via carbon 

and oxygen atoms. Camarota et al.[99] verified that at low CO coverages, both C-bonded and 

O-bonded species displayed double interaction, promoting an interaction enthalpy higher 

than that of CO with the isolated silanol of amorphous silica. The enthalpies observed for 

these interactions are similar, leading to the simultaneously occurrence of the three types of 

CO adsorption processes mentioned above. 

Martinez and Pacchioni[104] studied the interaction of CO, CO2 and CH4 molecules with the 

flat areas of the nanopores of the three-dimensional periodic lattice of p-Ph-PMO through 

the use of a periodic unit cell and DFT calculations (where they applied specific corrections 

to include dispersion forces). The construction of the models had into account the 

experimental structural information available in the literature.[51,115] The authors considered 

two models of p-Ph-PMO with different amounts of Tm species of silanols in the surface of 

the material and different sequences of silica bonded to the aromatic moieties, Figure 1.15.

The three molecules presented preferential interaction with the silanol groups and displayed 

adsorption energies characteristic of physisorbed states. The authors pretended with this 

computational study to understand the possibility of the PMO material to store or to separate 

the molecules previously mentioned. Furthermore, the choice of these three molecules was 

established on their inherent features, i.e., the CO presents a small permanent dipole 

moment, the CO2 manifests a quadrupole moment and the CH4 displays an apolar nature. 

The authors observed a similar interaction of the Ph-PMO with the CO and CO2 molecules, 

which are considerably stronger than the interaction with the CH4 molecules. With this study, 

Martinez and Pacchioni[104] demonstrated that the dispersion part of the interaction is 

considerable high (about one half of the total value). In order to interpret the influence of 

dispersion in the adsorption of these molecules, they performed additional calculations 

where the walls of the PMO were changed either by doping or transforming the inorganic or 

organic parts of the framework. In the case of the introduction of Ti–OH, Si–O or Al–OH 

groups they did not observe significant changes in the adsorption energies when compared 

with the parent material. Martinez and Pacchioni[104] also reported the effect of the organic 

functionalization of the material in the adsorbate-substrate interaction. In this way, the 

organic part was modified by the authors through substitution of the C-H in the phenylene 

bridge by N, giving rise to the pyridine group and by substitution of the phenylene bridge by 

the biphenylene organic linker. The introduction of the pyridine group as linker instead of 

the phenylene group originated an increase of the interaction energies with the CO and CO2 

molecules and the opposite effect is verified for the interaction energy with CH4. In the case 

of the use of the biphenylene bridge, a reduction of the calculated interaction energies was 



Chapter 1 

38 

 

found. Despite the change of the organic bridge of the PMOs, the interaction energies of the 

molecules with the silanols  are more than twice bigger than with the organic functions, 

remaining the silanols groups the preferential adsorption sites as observed for the  

Ph-PMO.[104] 

Kalantzopoulos et al.[77] used DFT calculations (PBE functional without dispersion 

corrections) to elucidate the hydrogen adsorption on phenylene-PMO. They calculated a 

binding strength of hydrogen with the pore walls of the PMO of -0.55 kcal·mol-1, which is 

higher than the computed interaction energies for hydrogen interaction with a single benzene 

molecule or with the aromatic bridge of IRMOF-1. The same authors also performed grand 

canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations using a simplistic periodic model derived by 

Inagaki et al. and observed that no hydrogen molecules could be introduced inside the wall 

structure of the PMO materials. 

In summary, computer simulations can be very useful to find locations in the PMO materials 

where interaction with adsorbates would be enhanced. They can also be employed to predict 

which chemical groups are able to increase the adsorption capacity and to enhance the 

selectivity towards a specific adsorbate. 

 

In this PhD Thesis it is expected to find different strategies for the synthesis and modification 

of aromatic bridged-PMOs in order to tune their properties and to improve their ability for 

adsorption/separation of CO2 from CH4. Thus, the preparation of PMOs with different pore 

sizes, the inclusion of different amino groups, the introduction of aluminum oxide species 

and the carbonization of PMOs are investigated for creating materials with high ?-? 

conjugation and different hydrophobic/hydrophilic character. 

A PhD Thesis Roadmap for the synthesis, functionalization and characterization of PMO 

materials is displayed in Figure 1.16, to guide the reader in this journey, and to present the 

PMOs materials that are reported in each Chapter. In this PhD Thesis Roadmap, it is also 

possible to known which are the materials that were studied by DFT modelling and tested in 

the CO2 and CH4 adsorption.

2. Characterization of PMOs 

The PMO materials present high specific surface areas, narrow distribution of pore sizes, 

tuneable pore size and arrangement, good thermal stability, alternating hydrophobic and 

hydrophilic bits and the organic moieties are modifiable. In this way, Transmission Electron 

Microscopy[1] (TEM); Scanning Electron Microscopy[2] (SEM); Powder X-Ray 

Diffraction[3] (PXRD); -196 °C nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms[4,5] (N2 sorption 

isotherms); Nuclear Magnetic Resonance[6–8] (NMR) and Fourier Transformed Infrared[9] 

(FTIR) spectroscopies; Elemental Analysis[10,11] (EA); X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy[12] 

(XPS) and ThermoGravimetric Analysis[13] (TGA) are the common techniques necessary to 

evaluate the physical, textural and chemical properties of this kind of materials. PXRD and 

TEM provide information about the pore arrangement and the molecular-scale periodicity 

of the material, while TGA affords evidences about the thermal stability of the material and 

also about the amount of the organic groups incorporated in the PMO. FTIR, NMR 

spectroscopies and EA give information on the functional groups, local environment of the 

chemical elements and quantitative chemical elemental data of the material, respectively.

2.1 Synthesis of bissilylated precursors 

The 1,4-bis(triethoxysilyl)benzene (BTEB) and 4,4?-bis(triethoxysilyl)-1,1?-biphenyl 

(BTEBP) were prepared via the Grignard reaction which was followed by distillation in 

vacuum using a procedure described in literature.[14] 

 
Chemicals reagents 

Magnesium, (purum, Aldrich), tetraethoxysilane (TEOS, 98%, Aldrich), iodine (99.8%, 

Fluka), tetrahydrofuran (THF, 99.5%, molecular sieves, Sigma-Aldrich),  

1,4-dibromobenzene (98%, Aldrich), hexane (95%, Sigma-Aldrich) and  

4,4'-dibromobiphenyl (95%, Aldrich) were used as received. 

 
1,4-bis(triethoxysilyl)benzene synthesis 

A typical synthesis starts with the addition of 3 small crystals of iodine to a mixture of dry 

magnesium turnings (5.14 g), TEOS (60 mL) and dry THF (40 mL) under nitrogen. Then 

the temperature of the reaction mixture was increased to 50 °C and a solution of  

1,4-bromobenzene (16.45 g) in dry THF (31mL) was added dropwise over 2 h. After, the 

reaction mixture was kept under reflux overnight. The resulting grey-greenish mixture was 

cooled to room temperature and followed by removal of the THF under vacuum. Then, 

hexane (80 mL) was added to precipitate any remaining magnesium salts in solution, and 

the mixture was quickly filtered under nitrogen to afford a clear, light brown solution. 

Afterwards, the hexane and the remaining TEOS were distilled off under vacuum leading to 

a brownish oil. The oil was distilled (1.5 torr, 200-205 °C) to give a clear and colorless oil 

(BTEB, approx. 6.4 g). The characterization of BTEB was in concordance to the one 

previously described in the literature.[14] 

 
4,4'-bis(triethoxysilyl)biphenyl synthesis 

A solution of 4,4'-dibromobiphenyl (15 g) in dry THF (113 mL) and TEOS (75 mL) was 

added to dry magnesium turnings (4.5 g). The reaction mixture was kept at reflux (75 °C) 

for 5 days. The resulting turbid, grey-greenish mixture was worked up as with BTEB to 

afford a viscous brown oil. Distillation (0.3 torr, 205-210 °C) yielded a clear and colorless 

oil (BTEBP, approx. 1.5 g). The characterization of BTEBP was in concordance with the 

one previously described in the literature.[14]

2.3 Structural and morphological studies 

Transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy 

The PMOs prepared in this PhD Thesis have a 2D hexagonal symmetry lattice (so, they have 

uniform mesopores with a determined diameter arranged in a hexagonal manner), which is 

expected to be observed using high-resolution TEM with a [001] incident beam, parallel to 

the channels (Figure 2.2a).[15]  

Using high-resolution TEM with [100] incident beam, perpendicular to the channels, we 

may visualize the molecular-scale order along the channels (Figure 2.2b).[15] 

The surface, shape, topography, size and level of aggregation of the powder particles of the 

PMOs were also studied. The SEM technique was used to obtain this kind of information.[2] 

Microscopy techniques can also be used to obtain a chemical characterization of the samples, 

i.e., it is possible to observe the mapping areas of different elemental composition. This 

requires the usage of an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) detector with the TEM 

or SEM equipments.[1,2]

that is perpendicular to the lattice fringes and with a spacing of 45.5 Å (d ? ?3a/2) is not observed as 
reported previously by Inagaki and co-workers.[15] The contrast of spacings at 7.6 Å and 45.5 Å 
cannot be observed simultaneously even using the best conditions, once the contrast transfer function 
of the objective lens on focus condition is different for both. 
 

TEM images were recorded using three different equipments: a 300 kV Hitachi  

H-9000-NA instrument equipped with CCD camera, a 200 kV High Resolution (HR) and 

energy filtered (EF) TEM JEOL 2200FS instrument equipped with digital camera, Orius 

SC1000B, and a TEM JEOL 2100 UHR equipped with analysis EDX Si(Li) and camera 

CCD Gatan ultrascan (2k x 2k).  

The preparation of the samples was done as follows: first, PMO samples shown in  

Chapter 4.1 were inserted into a polymeric resin and cut by ultramicrotomy with a diamond 

knife to have a thickness between 50 nm and 70 nm; then, the sections cut were deposited 

on grids with holey carbon film. The remaining samples considered in this PhD Thesis were 

deeply crushed using mortar and pestle, dispersed in ethanol and, then, a few drops of the 

suspensions were placed on holey carbon copper microgrids. 

The SEM micrographs were acquired on a SEM-FEG Hitachi SU-70 microscope operated 

at 25 kV equipped with microanalysis system for energy dispersive spectrometry of 

X-rays/EDS from Bruker Quantax 400 EDS detector, using the same TEM copper grids. 

 
Powder X-ray diffraction 

The structural order of the samples was also studied by PXRD and N2 sorption-isotherms. 

From PXRD it can be extracted information about the lattice parameters of the materials and 



Chapter 2 

52 

 

also about the observed mesoporosity and molecular periodicity of the materials prepared. 

Despite PMO materials do no present the crystalline arrangement of the atoms, they show 

organization of the pores and the electron density contrast created by such periodicity (2D 

hexagonal symmetry in the case of the materials studied in this PhD Thesis) can be detected 

by the PXRD technique.[15] Thus, we can use the Bragg’s law equation: 

 
n?Cu = 2d sin(?) (Equation 2.1) 

 
to determine the inter-planar distance d, in which n is an integral multiple of the wavelength, 

?Cu is the wavelength of the X-ray (in the case a Cu K? signal) and ? is the incidence angle. 

The lattice constant (a0) characteristic of a two-dimensional hexagonal symmetry (p6mm) 

lattice is determined from the d spacing of the 100 reflection using the following equation: 

 
a0 = 2d100/?3 (Equation 2.2) 

 
Furthermore, the samples prepared in this study are expected to possess the molecular-scale 

periodicity, which is related to the very regular alternation of the hydrophobic and 

hydrophilic layers. These are expected to be detected using the PXRD technique, by 

observation of an additional peak at the medium-scale angle range, corresponding to the size 

of the repeating unit. This periodicity is represented in Figure 2.3 by the interplanar distance 

d001.

hexagonal symmetry. Adapted from reference [15]. 
 

Most of the PXRD data were gathered with a Rigaku Geigerflex D Max-C Series 

diffractometer using Cu-K? radiation (?Cu = 1.5406 Å). The diffractograms were acquired

with 2? from 1-40 °, with a step size of 0.02 ° and acquisition times between 3 and 60 s per

Low temperature (-196 °C) nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms 

The N2 sorption isotherms provide information about the type of isotherm (Figure 2.5) and 

of the presence or absence of hysteresis loops.[4,5] 

A brief description of each type of isotherm is provided below as this technique is important 

in the characterization of PMO materials. 

Reversible type I isotherms are observed for microporous solids with rather small external 

surface area (e.g., some activated carbons, molecular sieve zeolites and certain porous 

oxides). As can be observed in Figure 2.5, the type I isotherm presents a concave form and 

the quantity adsorbed gets close to a limit value. The approximation to this limiting uptake 

is ruled by the accessible micropore volume and not by the internal surface area. The uptake 

steep observed at very low relative pressure is related to the improved adsorbent-adsorptive 

interactions in narrow micropores (micropores of molecular dimensions). The type I 

isotherms can be divided in type Ia and Ib isotherms for -196 °C nitrogen and -186 °C argon 

adsorption. Type Ia isotherms is usually detected for microporous materials having mainly 

narrow micropores (of width &amp;lt;? 1 nm) while the type Ib isotherms are observed in materials

with wide-range pore size distributions from broader micropores and perhaps narrow 

mesopores ( &amp;lt;? 2.5 nm). 

 
Figure 2.5. Types of physisorption isotherms. Adapted from reference [5]. 
 

The reversible type II isotherms are observed in nonporous or macroporous materials that 

adsorb most gases by the physisorption mechanism. The shape is the result of unrestricted 

monolayer-multilayer adsorption up to high relative pressure. This type of curve shows a 

point B, and if the lap is loud, point B generally agrees to the achievement of monolayer 

coverage. 

Type III isotherm does not present monolayer formation because point B is absent. Materials 

presenting this kind of isotherm curve show relatively weak adsorbent-adsorbate interactions 

and the adsorbed molecules are gathered around the most promising locations on the surface 

of the materials. This type of isotherm curve is typically observed in nonporous or 

macroporous solids. 

Mesopores adsorbents show type IV isotherms. The adsorption performance in mesoporous 

materials results from the adsorbent-adsorptive interactions and also from the interactions 

among the molecules in the condensed state. In this kind of isotherm, the initial monolayer-

multilayer adsorption on the mesoporous walls is followed by pore condensation.  

A distinctive characteristic of this kind of isotherms is a final saturation plateau, of variable 

length. As type I isotherms, type IV isotherms can be divided in type IVa and type IVb 



Chapter 2 

55 

 

isotherms. The type IVa isotherm presents capillary condensation due to hysteresis.  

This happens when the pore width exceeds a determined critical size, depending on the 

adsorption system and temperature. For adsorbents presenting small mesopores, fully 

reversible type IVb isotherms are observed. Type IVb isotherms are also observed in 

materials showing conical and cylindrical mesopores that are closed at the tapered end. 

Type V isotherm form is similar to type III isotherm and this can be endorsed to quite weak 

adsorbent–adsorbate interactions. These isotherms are archetypal for water adsorption on 

hydrophobic microporous and mesoporous adsorbents. 

The reversible stepwise type VI isotherm is typically observed in highly uniform nonporous 

surface materials due to layer-by-layer adsorption. The height of step denotes the capacity 

of each layer to adsorb, but the step sharpness is dependent on the system and the 

temperature. This isotherm type is typically observed in the adsorption of argon or krypton 

in graphitized carbon blacks at low temperature. 

The -196 °C N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms technique allows also to determine specific 

surface area (SBET), size distribution of the pores and pore volume of the PMO materials.[16] 

PMO materials usually display type IV isotherms (IUPAC classification) because of the 

narrow distribution of pore sizes as typically observed for conventional mesoporous 

materials such as MCM-41. To calculate the specific surface area, the most used method is 

the Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET),[17,18] and to determine the pore size distribution the 

Kelvin equation is usually utilized.[16] For the specific case of mesoporous materials, the 

pore size distribution is determined employing also the mathematic correction method KJS 

(Kruk, Jaroniec, and Sayari).[19,20] 

Additionally, type I isotherms can be also observed in some of the PMO materials presented 

in the following chapters. The adsorption data of PMO materials displaying both mesopores 

and micropores can be treated with quenched solid classical density functional theory 

(QSDFT)[21] that is another method used to determine the pore size distribution. This method 

is better suited than the KJS one once it takes into account the effects of surface 

heterogeneity, which significantly improve the reliability of the pore size analysis of 

heterogeneous micro- and meso- porous materials.[18,22] 

N2 sorption isotherms were recorded at -196 ºC using a Gemini V 2.00 instrument model 

2380. Functionalized PMO materials were dehydrated overnight at 120 or 150 ºC to an 

ultimate pressure of 1024 mbar and then cooled to room temperature prior to adsorption.

2.4 Chemical studies 

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 

Solution and solid state NMR studies were made in order to obtain information of the 

chemical structure of the prepared bissilylated precursors and materials, respectively. 

Different chemical reactions were performed in this PhD Thesis in order to tune the 

properties of the materials. The solid state NMR spectroscopy allows to observe the chemical 

environments of the different nuclei in the materials.[6–8] The appearance of peaks at different 

chemical shifts is expected when a chemical modification is introduced in the PMOs. NMR 

spectroscopy typical resonances of the pristine and functionalized aromatic PMO materials 

prepared in this PhD Thesis are displayed in Table 2.1.

spectrometer operating at 9.4 T at 100.62, 79.49, 40.54 and 100.62 MHz, respectively. 



Chapter 2 

57 

 

13C cross-polarization (CP) magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectra were obtained with 

4  µs 1H 90° pulse, contact time (CT) of 1 ms, a spinning rate (?R) of from 7 to 15 kHz and 

a recycle delay (RD) of 4 s. 

29Si MAS NMR spectra were collected employing a 40º flip angle pulse; ?R of 5 kHz and 

RD of 60 s. Despite being a quantitative technique, the acquisition of spectra with acceptable 

signal to noise ratio, requires long time once the natural abundance of 29Si is of ? 4.7 %, 

which is quite low. 29Si CP-MAS NMR spectra were acquired with a 4 µs 1H 90° pulse, a 

CT of 8 ms, a ?R of 5 kHz and 5 s of RD. The 29Si CP-MAS NMR is just a qualitative 

technique because it involves the transference of polarization between 1H and 29Si nuclei. 

The spectra are obtained in a short period of time with improved signal to noise ratio, being 

very useful to clearly identify the chemical environments that can be quantified in the  
29Si MAS NMR spectra. 

The 13C and 29Si NMR spectra were quoted in ppm from trimethylsilane. 

15N CP-MAS NMR spectra were recorded with 4  µs 1H 90° pulse, CT of 8 ms, a ?R of 

5 kHz and a RD of 5 s. These spectra took long time to be acquired due to the really low 

natural abundance of 15N (?0.37%), resulting in a sensitive penalty. 15N NMR spectra were 

referenced against a solid sample of natural abundance L-glycine, a secondary reference 

standard with respect to nitromethane. 

27Al MAS NMR spectra were done employing a 10º flip angle pulse, a ?R of 14 kHz and RD 

of 1 s. In this case, a MAS quantitative technique was used due to the high natural abundance 

of 27Al, which is 100%, being the acquisition of the spectra much faster than in the cases 

above. 

 

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy 

The FTIR spectroscopy is a versatile tool and was used here as a complementary technique 

to NMR for confirming the introduction of new functional groups into the PMO materials. 

The FTIR generated spectra can be acquired through three different ways: 

transmission/absorption, reflection and emission modes.[9] In the transmission/absorption 

mode, radiation goes through the sample, and some part of the radiation can be absorbed 

while another part can be transmitted. In reflection mode, the incident beam penetrates the 

surface of the sample and interacts with the matrix and, after partial absorption of the 

radiation, returns to the surface. The emission mode, which is rarely used, consists in sample

heating in such a way that the functional groups of the sample can emit at characteristic 

wavelength.[9] The FTIR spectroscopy in reflectance mode was used throughout the different 

studies in this PhD Thesis. Also, the transmission/absorption mode with attenuated total 

reflectance (ATR) technique was used. The ATR technique is usually associated with the 

acquisition of spectra of unwieldy samples, but its use has been spreading, because the 

spectra generated by this technique are obtained quickly in a wide range of samples without 

minimal preparation. 

The typical FTIR spectroscopy absorption bands of the parent and of the functionalized 

aromatic-PMO materials prepared in this PhD Thesis are presented in Table 2.2.

350 cm-1 with 256 scans and 4 cm-1 resolution. The samples were dehydrated overnight at 

100 °C before analyses. 

 

Elemental analysis 

EA enables the determination of the percentage of each atom in the PMO.[10,11] In this work, 

this technique was extremely important i) for quantifying the amount of nitrogen species 

introduced in the materials during the amination reactions via distinct synthesis conditions 

and ii) for attaining the amine densities. 

Elemental analysis CHN were carried out with a TruSpec 630-200-200 CNHS Analyser.

temperature was 1075 ºC; afterburner temperature was 850 ºC. Detection method: carbon –

infrared absorption; hydrogen – infrared absorption, nitrogen – thermal conductivity.  

The samples were dried at 100 °C for 24 h before the analyses. 

 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 

XPS is a semi-quantitative spectroscopic technique that allows the determination of the 

elemental composition, empirical formula, chemical state and electronic state of the existing 

elements into the material.[12] This spectroscopy technique can be useful to observe the 

chemical modifications at the surface of the material, as it can identify the introduction of 

new elements into the surface and to elucidate changes in the chemical bonds established by 

certain elements.  

The XPS spectra were acquired by Carlos P. M. Sá at Centro de Materiais da Universidade 

do Porto (CEMUP), using a Kratos Axis Ultra HAS spectrometer, with monochromatized 

Al Eo radiation (15 eV). All the materials were compressed into pellets prior to the XPS 

studies. In order to correct possible deviations, produced by electric charge of the materials, 

the C 1s line at 285.0 eV was taken as internal standard. The percentage of each element into 

the materials was determined from the areas of the relevant bands in the survey XPS spectra. 

 

2.5 Thermal stability studies 

The thermal stability studies are important to extract information of the degradation 

temperature of the materials.[13] This information is important to understand if the expected 

chemical functionalities were inserted in the material and to define the conditions to be used 

under the different techniques to avoid material degradation. The desorption temperature 

used during the adsorption measurements took always into account the thermal stability of 

each material. To study the thermal stability of the materials, TGA analyses were performed 

on a Shimadzu TGA-50 instrument with a program rate of 5 ºC·min-1 in air. 

 

2.6 CO2/CH4 adsorption studies 

The adsorption isotherms of carbon dioxide and methane were measured using two different 

apparatuses, namely, the manometric and the volumetric one, as described below. 

 
 
 
 
 



Chapter 2 

60 

 

Manometric experimental setup 

Adsorption isotherms of carbon dioxide and methane were measured on PMO materials, at 

308 K and pressures up to 2 bar, using an in-house built manometric apparatus, Figure A1 

(c.f. Appendix A). The samples were activated, according to the heating program shown in 

Figure A2 (first at 80 °C during 5 hours and then at 160 °C during 10 hours), under vacuum 

of ca. 14 mbar. The CO2 and CH4 gases were used as provided by Air Liquide (France), with 

a purity of 99.998% and 99.95% respectively. 

The experimental adsorption measurement technique adopted was previously described in 

detail[23] and, therefore, is shortly summarized here. Before performing each adsorption 

measurement, the void volume was determined by helium picnometry. To perform an 

adsorption experiment, the gas to be adsorbed is fed into the gas tank until an initial pressure 

P is reached while the sample is kept isolated, in another tank, by a closed valve. After the 

gas feed, the pressure in the gas tank is allowed to stabilize over a given period of time.  

The adsorption process starts when the valve isolating the sample is opened, and a pressure 

decrease is observed until a plateau is reached. Pressure and temperature readings are 

constantly recorded over time, so that the adsorption uptake can be computed as a function 

of time. This procedure is repeated sequentially for different values of pressure, starting from 

the previously equilibrated pressure point. 

Each experimental pure component adsorption isotherm was fitted to a Langmuir model. 

The fitting parameters were then used to calculate the Henry’s constant of adsorption  

(KH, in mmol·g-1·bar-1) for each gas and each adsorbent by taking the slope of the isotherm 

in the limit of zero coverage. The Henry constant thus measures the affinity of each gas 

toward the solid surface. The Langmuir equation is expressed in Equation 2.3: 

 

? =  
?? × ? × ?

1 + ? × ?
 (Equation 2.3) 

 
where q is the amount adsorbed, qS is the Langmuir saturation capacity, b is the Langmuir 

surface affinity parameter and P is the pressure. 

We then estimated the low-coverage CO2 selectivity (S) of each material by taking the ratio 

of the Henry’s constants for the two gases (Equation 2.4):

The measurements made using this equipment were performed by our collaborators at the 

Laborato?rio Associado LSRE-LCM, Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto,  

Christophe Siquet, João Santos and Miguel Jorge. 

 
Volumetric experimental setup 

Adsorption isotherms of CO2 and CH4 on prepared samples were measured up to 1000 kPa 

at 25 °C, using the volumetric method. These experiments were done on a custom-made 

stainless steel volumetric apparatus, with a pressure transducer (Pfeiffer Vacuum, APR 266), 

and equipped with a vacuum system that allows a vacuum better than 10-2 Pa. The 

temperature was controlled with a stirred thermostatic water bath (Grant Instrument, 

GD-120) and before every experiment the samples were degassed for 2.5 h at 150 °C. Each 

experimental pure component adsorption isotherm was fitted using the virial model, where 

the non-ideality of the gas phase was taken into account by using the second and third virial 

coefficients, and the experimental excess adsorbed amounts were converted to the absolute 

adsorbed amounts by taking into account the porous volume of the material and the density 

of the gas phase using the virial coefficients. Selectivity values were estimated using a 

method proposed by Myers[24] and the implementation is described in detail in previous 

works.[25] The virial equation of state fitted to the adsorption data is in the form:

under supervision of Moisés Pinto and João Pires at CCB – Center of Chemistry and 

Biochemistry, Faculty of Sciences, University of Lisbon.

2.7 Computational studies 

Density functional theory (DFT) is currently one of the most effective and also most 

common quantum mechanical methodologies to matter. Its applications go from atoms to 

molecules and solids. Currently, DFT is regularly used for calculating a wide range of 

properties in chemistry (e.g. molecular structures, reaction paths, etc.) and in physics  

(e.g. band structures of solids). 

The final aim of most approaches in solid state physics and quantum chemistry is the 

resolution of the time-independent, non-relativistic Schrödinger equation,[26] toward 

obtaining relevant information about a system. However, for non hydrogenoid species, a 

precise solution of Schrödinger equation is not possible and several approximations need to 

be made. The Born-Oppenheimer approximation,[27] is the approximation most accepted, 

being centered on the fact that nuclei are several thousand times heavier than electrons, 

therefore the system wave function is allowed to be fragmented into its electronic and nuclear 

components. Then, for a system with many-electrons and assumed nuclear potential, the 

variational principle describes a procedure to obtain its estimated ground-state energy and 

wave function, besides other important properties. 

Two large classes of conventional electronic structure methods were developed to tackle 

many-body problems and can be divided into wave function-based methods and DFT 

methods. The former class comprise the often called ab initio approaches like the  

Hartree-Fock (HF), Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP), configuration interaction (CI), 

and coupled cluster (CC) methods.[28] For these methods, the system wave function with N 

electrons depends on 3N spatial variables (and the spin in case of the unrestricted 

formalisms), and so their complexities grow with the increase of number of electrons. 

Differently in the other class, DFT methods,[29] use functionals of the electron density, which 

is a function of only 3 spatial variables. 

The DFT theory relies on the Hohenberg and Kohn (H-K) theorems. The first H-K theorem 

validates that the electron density exclusively controls the Hamiltonian operator and 

consequently all the properties of the system, while the second theorem states that the 

functional relating to the ground-state energy of the system brings the lowest energy if and 

only if the input density is the true ground state density (i.e. nothing but the variational 

principle). Currently, the precision and efficacy of DFT-based approaches depend not only 



Chapter 2 

63 

 

on the basis-set for the expansion of the Kohn-Sham orbitals, but also on the quality of the 

applied exchange-correlation (XC) functionals.[30] 

The first DFT approach proposed was the local density approximation (LDA)[31], which was 

followed by the local-spin density approximation (LSDA) proposed by Slater[32]. Both, 

found vast application in physics but the consideration of an homogeneous electron density 

was demonstrated to be inadequate (and inaccurate) for most applications in chemistry. 

Then, the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) appeared, which has into account the 

non-homogeneity of the true electron density, i.e, it incorporate also the gradient of the 

electron density with the distance from the nucleus. Between the most frequently used 

combinations of XC functionals of the GGA family are the BP86 (exchange from Becke’s 

B88 functional with correlation from Perdew’s P86 functional), PW91 (exchange-

correlation from Perdew-Wang 91), PBE (exchange-correlation from Perdew, Burke, and 

Ernzerhof), RPBE (revised version of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional due to 

Hammer and Norskov), and BLYP (B88 exchange with correlation from Lee, Yang and 

Parr).[33–46] For example, the most applied functional to model metallic surfaces is the PW91, 

followed closely by PBE and RPBE.[47] GGA functionals usually provide better atomization 

energies, and structural properties, when compared to LSDA functionals. Nevertheless, 

GGA functionals give too small barrier heights and fail in describing van der Waals 

interactions. 

More flexible XC functionals, labelled meta-GGAs (e.g. TPSS)[48,49] and hybrid (or meta-

hybrid) functionals with nonlocal HF exchange[41] (e.g. hybrid B3LYP and meta hybrid 

M06) appeared to offer better accuracy, although they may present convergence problems. 

They are also more computationally costly than approaches based on the GGA. 

In order to solve the GGA limitations to describe systems where van der Waals interactions 

(vdW) assume an important role, i.e. weakly bonded systems, several different strategies 

have been introduced in the last decade. In the case of DFT-D2, that is the approach used in 

the PMO modeling studies performed in this PhD Thesis, it is considered a simple empirical 

dispersion correction, which was suggested by Grimme et al.,[50] where the dispersion 

contributions are considered by pairwise interactions from the London formula.[51] Other 

approaches with different degrees of empiricism have been proposed to introduce the effects 

of dispersion in DFT calculations and were the focus of a recent review.[52]

Based on the description above, the choice of the most suitable DFT method for a specific 

application is based on a compromise between accuracy and computational cost. Figure 2.6 

illustrates the variation of the XC functional simplicity and expected accuracy on going from 

the earth of Hartree (null exchange, null correlation) to the heaven of chemical accuracy, 

with errors in energy differences lower than 1 kcal·mol-1; the green steps illustrate that the 

inclusion of dispersion corrections to any of the DFT classes in principle leads them closer 

to the heaven of accuracy in case of weakly bonded systems.

Therefore, if a DFT user climbs the ladder will get better accuracy at the expenses of a larges 

computational resources. Thus, for very accurate calculations, the DFT studies are limited 

to structural models of up to a few tens of atoms while standard DFT calculations (c.f. those 

using approaches at the bottom of the ladder) can tackle much larger systems that can reach 

up to hundreds or a few thousands of atoms, when using standard computational systems. 

Two approaches can be considered to model extended surfaces (which is the case in this PhD 

Thesis): the so-called i) cluster model and ii) periodic slab model (c.f. sub-chapter 1.5).[55] 

The results for a cluster model are critically dependent on the choice of the cluster size, 

stoichiometry and shape. Thus, the choice of the cluster model to offer useful information

has to be explored a priori by checking the convergence of the results with the cluster.  

In the case of the periodic model approach, a small number of atoms (unit cell) is extended 

periodically, and more frequently, in the three spatial dimensions (XYZ) to simulate the 

characteristics of infinite systems (periodic boundary conditions). The infinite repetition 

eliminates the limitations affecting the cluster models, i.e., the so-called border effects.  

In the periodic model approach, the computational cost is directly dependent on the number 

(size) and the symmetry of the elements in the unit cell. Bulk crystalline systems can be 

studied with the periodical repetition of just a few atomic positions, e.g. by using their 

primitive cells. The study of alloys, contaminants, or vacancies can be made by increasing 

the model and substituting or removing one or more atoms in the periodic system. In the 

methodologies repeating periodically in the three spatial dimensions a specific unit cell, the 

surfaces of the materials can be generated by using a unit cell consisting of several layers of 

the material (slab) and a vacuum region in the direction normal to the surface (Figure 2.7).  

This strategy has been considered to model an infinite wall of the PMO materials and to 

obtain atomic level information of their surface chemistry. Note, that for studying 

adsorption, the sizes of the slabs in the X and Y directions, assuming that the vacuum section 

is in the Z direction, are dependent on the volumes of the adsorbates and on the surface 

coverage, i.e., larger unit cells have to be employed in the case of large adsorbates in order 

to avoid spurious adsorbate-adsorbate interactions with their images in the neighboring 

repeated cells. By playing with the sizes of the slabs in the X and Y directions it is possible 

to simulate easily the effects of surface coverage. Also, the vacuum region in the Z direction 

must be the smallest as possible to make the DFT computations feasible when plane-waves 

basis sets are employed since these will be filling the entire unit cell space. Vacuum regions 

of ? 10 Å were found to sufficient to study small adsorbates but larger regions are required 

to study larger adsorbates.

This Chapter describes the preparation of PMOs with different pore sizes; their modification 

with different kinds of amines (aromatic and alkyl amines); and the evaluation of the 

synthetized materials in the adsorption of pure CO2 and CH4. Additionally, DFT calculations 

were used to assess the preferential locations of the CO2 and CH4 molecules into the 

materials; to interpret some of the experimental results; and to understand which 

functionalization brings improvements in the CO2/CH4 separation.

3.1.1 Motivation 

As it was seen in Sub-chapter 1.2 the biogas is a renewable energy source that is composed 

mainly by methane but presents also a large amount of carbon dioxide as the main 

contaminant. It was also demonstrated the needs of removal CO2 from CH4 and the 

drawbacks associated to the systems that are being employed to separate these gases. 

Therefore, an energy efficient process to uptake the CO2 contaminant from CH4 is required 

for the wide application of biogas with the purpose of increasing the purity of the gaseous 

stream. It is well known that the adsorption process is a very attractive technique for small 

to medium-scale operations, but it relies on the availability of highly effective adsorbent 

materials. 

The development of adsorbents to uptake the CO2 gas from biogas via adsorptive separation 

involves the preparation of materials with different nature and structure.[1] Various 

mesoporous and microporous adsorbents (carbons[2–6], MOFs[2,7,8], zeolites[2,9–13], clays[14,15], 

and silica-based mesoporous materials[16,17]) have been proposed for CO2 

adsorption/separation from biogas as it was demonstrated in Sub-chapter 1.2. Although, 

these adsorbents are still not ideal for CO2 uptake from biogas mainly due to their 

unsatisfactory performances. Thus, the ideal adsorbent is still undiscovered and, in an 

attempt to achieve a material with better ability to uptake CO2 from biogas, it is explored the 

possibility of applying periodic mesoporous phenylene-silicas (PMOs)[18–20] as adsorbents 

for CO2/CH4 gas separation. The interest to use PMOs as adsorbents in this field relies in the 

assumption that these materials possess high specific surface areas, high pore volumes and 

are easy to be modified as it was possible to observe in Sub-chapter 1.4.[18–24] Additionally, 

PMOs also have the advantages of exhibiting meso- and molecular-scale periodicities that 

can promote a good diffusion of the molecules (adsorbates but also the reagents required to 

modify the PMOs) within the channels of the PMO because of the increased organization of 

the pores and of the presence of the organic functions (such as ethylene, phenylene, 

biphenylene, etc.) that are well integrated in the walls of this class of materials. Moreover, 

the molecular-scale periodicity resulting from the alternating organic-inorganic groups along 

the pore wall, assigns alternating hydrophobic-hydrophilic character. Furthermore, it is 

possible to control the porosity of the PMOs using the template-assisted self-assembly 

method.[18–24] All of the features above increase the attractiveness of PMOs as potential 

adsorbents for CO2/CH4 adsorption/separation. Recently, alkyl amine functionalities (more 



Chapter 3 

74 

 

specifically the N-[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]-ethylenediamine) grafted on the silanols of 

phenylene-bridged PMO and of SBA-15 were tested in the adsorption of pure CO2 at 25 °C 

in a pressure range up to 1.2 atm.[25] It was observed that the alkyl amine-PMO adsorbs a 

larger amount of CO2 at a faster adsorption rate when compared with SBA-15, which 

demonstrates that the functionalization of PMOs with amines is more relevant than a similar 

degree and nature of functionalization in silica for the adsorption of CO2. Interestingly, the 

unmodified SBA-15 silica also adsorbs a smaller amount of CO2 when compared with the 

unmodified PMO. This behavior was explained by the higher hydrophobicity of the PMO 

pore wall when compared with that of SBA-15. Hence, water adsorption is expected to be 

more acute in SBA-15 than in PMO materials, competing more with CO2 for available 

adsorption sites on the former class of materials, so, organosilica instead of pure silica 

supports were proposed for immobilization of amines groups aiming materials for CO2 

adsorption/separation.[25] Despite the fact that PMOs are more expensive than silica, the 

superior ability of amine modified PMOs to adsorb CO2 can be transferred and should be 

explored for these applications. 

Here, it is considered the phenylene-bridged PMOs as potential candidates for the CO2/CH4 

separation. In this way, phenylene-bridged PMO with different pore sizes were prepared by 

changing the alkyl chain length of the cationic surfactant[26] since the pore size and pore 

curvature may play an important role on the diffusion of the reagents or gas molecules inside 

the pores. Additionally, the amount of amine functionalities into the materials, their locations 

and the type of silanols are certainly important variables on the adsorptive properties of these 

materials. So, after the synthesis of the PMOs, the mono-nitration of the phenylene bridges 

was performed with nitric acid in the presence of sulfuric acid. Then, the nitro group was 

reduced to the amine in the presence of tin chloride and hydrochloric acid.[27] To the best of 

our knowledge, the amination of the phenylene bridge in the PhCnPMOs with n &amp;lt;18, was 

not attempted before. Hence it is described for the first time the synthesis and 

characterization of aromatic amine-funtionalized PMOs with pore sizes ranging from 2.4 

and 3.7 nm. All materials are tested on the CO2 and CH4 adsorption. The physicochemical 

characterization is performed to fully understand the potential of these materials for 

CO2/CH4 separation.

3.1.2 Experimental section 

Materials synthesis 

PhCnPMO adsorbents preparation: phenylene-bridged PMOs with different pore sizes 

(hereafter denoted PhCnPMOs, n = 12, 14, 16 or 18) were prepared following procedures 

previously described in literature,[27,28] with slight modification in the amount of NaOH and 

surfactant used (c.f. Table 3.1.1). The home-made 1,4-bis(triethoxysilyl)benzene  

(BTEB, c.f. Chapter 2.1) precursor[29] is hydrolyzed and condensed around a surfactant, the  

Cn-trimethylammonium bromide template (Cn-TMA, n =12, 14, 16 or 18), Figure 3.1.1. 

 

Figure 3.1.1. Synthesis route for PhCnPMOs, n = 12, 14, 16 and 18, prepared with C12-TMA,  

C14-TMA, C16-TMA and C18-TMA surfactants, respectively. 
 

In a typical synthesis of the PhCnPMO materials, the surfactant is dissolved in a mixture of 

distilled water and 6 M aqueous sodium hydroxide at 20 – 60 °C. BTEB was subsequently 

added dropwise under vigorous stirring, at room temperature. The molar ratio BTEB: water 

is always constant and equal to 1 : 531 (molar ratio corresponding only to the distilled water), 

with the quantities of surfactant and NaOH adjusted according to the surfactant used  

(c.f. Table 3.1.1).

The mixture was kept for 20 minutes in an ultrasonic bath (Bransonic ultrasonic cleaner 

1510E-DTH). The reaction mixture was stirred for 24 hours at room temperature, and was 

then transferred into a Teflon lined autoclave for additional 24 hours at 100 °C. The final 

precipitate was recovered by filtration, washed with warm distilled water and dried at 

60 °C. 



Chapter 3

To obtain porous PMO materials, the surfactants were removed through solvent 

extraction.[18–20,26,28] An aliquot of 0.5 g of the as-synthesized powder was stirred in a 

solution of 4.5 g of 37% HCl and 125 mL ethanol, for 8 hours at 80 °C. The powder was 

filtered off, washed with ethanol and water and dried overnight at 60 °C. The confirmation 

of the template removal was made through 13C NMR spectroscopy and TGA analysis. 

NH2PhCnPMO adsorbents preparation: the amine phenylene-modifications (to prepare 

NH2PhCnPMO, n =12, 14, 16 or 18) were made using the same two-step procedure reported 

by Inagaki et al.[27] First a strong acid treatment with HNO3/H2SO4 was used to incorporate 

the nitro groups into the phenylene moieties of PMO followed by treatment with SnCl2/HCl 

to reduce the nitro groups to the desired amine functionalities (Figure 3.1.2). 

 

Figure 3.1.2. Synthesis route for the amine functionalization of the PhCnPMOs, n=12, 14, 16 and 
18. 
 

Materials characterization 

All PMO materials were evaluated by PXRD, -196 °C N2-sorption isotherms and TEM. The 

chemical properties of the materials were evaluated by elemental analysis, 13C, 15N and 29Si 

NMR and FTIR spectroscopies. The thermal stability was evaluated by TGA. The  

N2-sorption isotherms, TEM, 13C CP-MAS NMR, FTIR, TGA, EA and CO2 and CH4 

adsorption data are available in the Appendix A. 

 
Adsorption measurement procedure 

Adsorption isotherms of carbon dioxide and methane were measured on as-synthesized and 

amine-modified PMO materials, at 308 K and pressures up to 2 bar, using an in-house built 

manometric apparatus, using the procedure described in Sub-chapter 2.6.  

Each experimental pure component adsorption isotherm was fitted to a Langmuir model. 

The fitting parameters were then used to calculate the Henry’s constant of adsorption (KH, 

in mmol·g-1·bar-1) for each gas and each adsorbent by taking the slope of the isotherm in the 

limit of zero coverage. The Henry constant thus measures the affinity of each gas toward the

3.1.3 Results and discussion  

Characterization of materials 

The structural order of the non-modified samples was studied by PXRD. Figure 3.1.3a shows 

the PXRD patterns of surfactant-free PhC12PMO, PhC14PMO, PhC16PMO and PhC18PMO 

samples. The patterns are in agreement with those reported in previous studies,[26,28] being 

compatible with a two-dimensional hexagonal symmetry (p6mm) lattice. The d spacing of 

the strong low-angle (100) reflection changes slightly from sample to sample. The lattice 

parameters, a, calculated from the 2? values of the (100) peaks for the surfactant-free 

PhC12PMO, PhC14PMO, PhC16PMO and PhC18PMO materials are 4.14; 4.32; 4.76; and  

5.36 nm, respectively (Table 3.1.2). The increase of the lattice parameters results in larger 

pore sizes (Figure 3.1.3d) as a function of the alkyl-tail lengths. The evidence for the 

hexagonal arrangement of the pores is obtained from the presence of the tiny (110) and (200) 

low-angle reflections observed in Figure 3.1.3a.[26,28] In addition to the low-angle peaks, the 

PXRD patterns display medium-range reflection at d ~ 0.76 nm, due to molecular-scale 

periodicity in the PMO pore walls along the channel direction.[28]

profiles (d) calculated from the N2 adsorption isotherm for NH2PhC12PMO (squares, black line); 
NH2PhC14PMO (rhombus, black dashed line); NH2PhC16PMO (circles, grey line); and 
NH2PhC18PMO (triangles, grey dashed line). 
 

The four different samples display these peaks at exactly the same d spacing, which is in 

agreement with Bion et al.[26] Thus, the non-modified PMOs materials exhibit molecular-

scale periodicity in the walls and, in addition, have different pore sizes. The structural order 

of the aminated samples was studied by PXRD and N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms. 

Figure 3.1.3b and c shows the PXRD patterns of NH2PhCnPMO materials. As in the simple 

PMOs, the first strong low-angle (100) reflection peak associated to the (110) and (200) 

small reflections are characteristic of a two-dimensional hexagonal symmetry (p6mm) 

lattice, Figures 3.1.3b and c. Thus, the hexagonal arrangement is maintained upon amination. 

The d spacings in the aminated samples are similar to the d spacings of the pristine PMOs. 

The lattice parameters, a, of the hexagonal array of mesopores obtained for the 

NH2PhC12PMO, NH2PhC14PMO, NH2PhC16PMO and NH2PhC18PMO materials are 4.19, 

4.37, 4.88 and 5.34 nm, respectively, which means that the presence of the amino group does 

not significantly change those values relatively to the pristine materials (Table 3.1.2). In 

addition to the low-angle peaks, the PXRD patterns of all aminated samples display medium-

range reflections at d ~ 0.760 ± 0.002 nm, which are identical to those of the initial PMO

The presence of different mesopore sizes was confirmed by low temperature (-196 °C) N2 

adsorption–desorption experiments. In Figure A1.3 (Appendix A), the samples display a 

type IV isotherm (IUPAC classification), usually observed for conventional mesoporous 

materials such as MCM-41, indicating mesopores of uniform size. The introduction of the 

amine into the mesochannels is confirmed by the reduction of the BET specific surface area 

(SBET). The NH2PhC12PMO, NH2PhC14PMO, NH2PhC16PMO and NH2PhC18PMO materials 

present SBET of 924, 778, 623 and 719 m²?g-1, respectively (Table 3.1.2).  

A comparison of the pore size distribution (PSD) curves of NH2PhC12PMO, NH2PhC14PMO, 

NH2PhC16PMO and NH2PhC18PMO materials reveals a maximum shifting from 2.4 to  

3.5 nm (Figure 3.1.3d and Table 3.1.2), respectively. 

TEM images (Figure A1.4a, Appendix A) reveal the high order along the channels for the 

NH2PhC18PMO, NH2PhC16PMO, NH2PhC14PMO and NH2PhC12PMO. Figure A1.4b 

(Appendix A) shows the TEM image in the direction parallel to the channels of the 

NH2PhC16PMO, supporting the hexagonal arrangement of the pores observed by PXRD and 

confirming the high order of these materials. 

Solid-state 13C CP-MAS NMR and 29Si CP-MAS NMR spectra of PhCnPMO and 

NH2PhCnPMO materials are shown in Figures A1.5 (Appendix A) and Figure 3.1.4, 

respectively. Solid-state 13C CP-MAS NMR spectra support the amination of PhCnPMOs 

materials. The pristine materials present a typical resonance at 133 ppm of the aromatic 

carbons as reported in the literature.[28] Tiny peaks can be detected in the region 0 to 50 ppm

in the spectra of PhC18PMO sample, which are associated to the residual presence of non-

extracted template molecules. These resonances are not observed in the spectra of the other 

PhCnPMOs. The 13C CP-MAS NMR spectra of NH2PhCnPMO materials exhibit resonances 

at ca. 122, 133 and 150 ppm assigned to the sp2 carbons of the phenylene ring. These values 

are in agreement with the results previously reported for the NH2PhC18PMO.[27]  

The 29Si CP-MAS NMR spectra of the PhCnPMO and NH2PhCnPMO exhibit peaks at ca.  

-81, -70 and -61 ppm attributed to T3, T2 and T1 organosiliceous species  

 [Tm = RSi(OSi)m(OH)3-m], respectively, which are illustrated in Figure 3.1.4. 

 

Figure 3.1.4. 29Si CP-MAS and MAS NMR spectra of PhCnPMOs and NH2PhCnPMO. The observed 
resonances are assigned to the corresponding Tm silanols species in the PMO materials. 

 

The percentages of Tm species in each material are calculated from the deconvolution of the 
29Si MAS NMR spectra, using the typical assumption of Gaussian distributions of isotropic 

chemical shifts for each type of Tm species and are presented in Table A1.1. Generally, the 

overlapping of Tm resonances is observed, giving rise to small variations between best-fit 

intensity parameters and, hence, to uncertainties related with the relative populations of the 

Tm sites. The degree of condensation varies between 66 and 71 % for the PhCnPMOs and 

between 66 and 74 % for the NH2PhCnPMO materials. No peaks assigned to

Qn [Qn = Si(OSi)n(OH)4-n] species were observed, proving that no carbon–silicon bond 

cleavage occurred during the amination of the PMO materials. 

The 15N NMR spectra of the NH2PhCnPMO materials (not shown) display in all cases only 

a single peak corresponding to the aromatic amine at -325 ppm as observed before for 

NH2PhC18PMO (Sub-chapter 5.1) and NH2PhC12PMO (Sub-chapter 3.2). The success of the 

amination of the phenylene moieties in the PMOs was also verified by Fourier infrared 

transform (FTIR) spectroscopy, Figure A1.6 (Appendix A). 

Figure A1.7 (Appendix A) presents the TGA analysis of the pristine and amine modified  

PhCnPMOs. The first weight loss observed below 100 °C is related to desorption of 

physisorbed water. No weight loss from 100 to 300 °C, which is due to the small quantity of 

remained surfactant, was detected for pure PMOs with exception of PhC18PMO (2% weight 

loss), confirming the 13C CP-MAS NMR results. The decomposition and release of the 

organic moieties from the framework takes place above 600 °C in the parent PhCnPMOs. 

The introduction of the amino groups in the PMOs leads to a reduction of thermal stability 

from 600 to 400 °C for all NH2PhCnPMOs as observed by TGA, Figure A1.7 (Appendix A). 

Table A1.2 (Appendix A) displays the density of the amino group linked to the phenylene 

moieties into the PMOs materials. The PMO with the smallest pore size presents the lowest 

density of NH2 groups. This probably occurs as a consequence of steric hindrance during the 

functionalization. 

 
Experimental pure-component adsorption isotherms 

Pure-component adsorption isotherms of CO2 and CH4 at 35 °C on the PhC12PMOs, shown 

in terms of absolute amount adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbent (q), are displayed in  

Figure 3.1.5. The introduction of the amino group into the channels of the PhC12PMO leads 

to an increase in the adsorption of CO2 (uppermost curves in Figure 3.1.5). Additionally, the 

adsorption of methane in the NH2PhC12PMO is slightly lower than in the as-synthesized 

material (lowermost curves in Figure 3.1.5).

symbols) molecules in the as-synthesized (squares) and amine functionalized (spheres) PhC12PMOs. 
Solid lines represent the fits to Langmuir model. 
 

Table 3.1.3 depicted the calculated Henry’s constants of adsorption for pure CO2 and CH4 

molecules in the pristine and amine functionalized PhCnPMOs adsorbents. Considering the 

low CH4 adsorption values obtained for all prepared PMOs, it is possible to generalize that 

these materials are weak CH4 adsorbents. Additionally, the amination in the PhC12PMO 

provides an improvement in the adsorption of the material. It should be emphasized that this 

evidence is not observed for all PhCnPMOs. The amination of the PhCnPMOs is favoring 

the adsorption of CO2 in the case of the materials with the smallest pores such as 

NH2PhC12PMO and NH2PhC14PMO (Figure 3.1.5, Figure A1.8 and Table 3.1.3), while an 

opposite effect is observed in the materials with the largest pore sizes (c.f. NH2PhC16PMO 

and NH2PhC18PMO). A systematic analysis of the features of these materials is necessary to 

understand other reasons besides pore size and BET surface area factors that may be 

influencing the adsorption profiles recorded in this work. 

The Henry’s constants of PhC18PMO, PhC16PMO, Ph C14PMO and PhC12PMO for CO2 are 

0.40, 0.48, 0.41 and 0.46 mmol·g-1·bar-1 respectively (Table 3.1.3). As it can be seen, these 

values seem to be fairly independent of the pore size. Although the size of the pores can 

influence the distance between functional groups and, consequently, the Henry’s constants, 

it is often observed that in materials with large pores, low-coverage adsorption is dominated 

by surface chemistry. As such, the variation of KH may be related with the concentration of 

silanols (T1 and T2 species, Figure 3.1.4), phenylene density and nitrogen density (in the case 

of the amine functionalized PhCnPMOs) of each material. The quantification of these

characteristics for each material considered in this work is displayed in Table 3.1.3. The 

percentages of nitrogen and carbon were taken directly from elemental analyses. The 

percentage of silanol species was calculated from 29Si MAS NMR by deconvolution of the 

T1 and T2 species in the NMR spectrum of each material (denoted as T1NMR and T2NMR, Table 

A1.1, Appendix A). As the percentages of siliceous and of oxygen species vary from sample 

to sample, the Tm siliceous species percentages were converted to the percentages of Tm 

siliceous species present in the sample (denoted here as T1SMP and T2SMP) by combining the 

NMR results with the elemental analysis data. It is hypothesized that the CO2 molecules 

interact more favorably with the T1 and T2 siliceous species in each sample. Therefore, the 

total percentage of siliceous species (denoted here as %Si-O) of each material (Table A1.2, 

Appendix A) was calculated using the following Equation 3.1.3: 

 
%Si-O = %Si + %O = 100% - (%N + %C + %H)    (Equation 3.1.3)

The %Si-O, %N, %C and %H represent the sum of the percentages of silicon and oxygen, 

nitrogen, carbon and hydrogen, respectively, of each material, and are obtained from 

elemental analyses. Then, the percentage of TmNMR species was multiplied by the percentage 

of Si-O to obtain %TmSMP. The evident correlation between the percentage of Tm species in 

each sample and the corresponding KHCO2 values supports the hypothesis raised above.  



Chapter 3 

84 

 

The analysis of the data in Table 3.1.3 shows that the presence of T2 silanol species in the 

PMO is correlated with the amount of adsorbed CO2, i.e., in general the KHCO2 augments 

with the increase of %T2SMP. 

This observation is consistent with a picture that the presence of 29Si T2 silanol species in 

the PMO brings a positive effect on the adsorption of CO2 by creating hydrogen bonds with 

the acidic CO2. Curiously, KHCO2 reduces with the increase of the percentage of the silanediol 

species, i.e., with the amount of silanols with T1 environments (c.f. Figure 3.1.4). This 

suggests that when two hydroxyl groups are linked to the same silicon atom, they are very 

probably establishing intramolecular bonds of the type O–H.…O,[31] hence, less Si–O–H 

moieties are available to interact with CO2. As the T1 species content in the different PMO 

is inversely proportional to the T2 species content (c.f. Table A1.1, 1st and 2nd column), the 

amount of adsorbed CO2 by each PMO is influenced mainly by the number of basic T2 silanol 

species. The correlation between the percentage of T2SMP silanol on each sample and the 

Henry constants is presented in Figure A1.9a. 

The CO2 molecules can also interact with the organic moieties but such interaction is 

expected to be much weaker than that with the silanol species. In fact, Martinez et al.[32] 

found through density functional theory (DFT) calculations that the adsorption energy 

between CO2 and silanols with the T2 environment was twice that occurring between CO2 

and the organic bridges. Preliminary DFT calculations (PBE-D2 level of theory) employing 

a computational recipe and a PMO model similar to those used by Martinez et al.[32] show 

that CO2 is positioned close to a T2 silanol species in the pristine PMO material, as can be 

observed in Figure 3.1.6a. Although at low pressure it is not expected interaction between 

the organic bridges and CO2 molecules, the presence of the organic moieties may contribute 

to enhance the interaction of CO2 with the T2 silanols by interrupting long range hydrogen 

bond interaction within silanols.

Figure 3.1.6. CO2 preferential location on a) PhCnPMOs and b) NH2PhCnPMOs. The CO2 is 
highlighted in yellow. 
 

Therefore, at low pressure, the CO2 molecules interact only with available silanols on the 

surface of the materials while regions close to the organic moieties will be populated only at 

high pressure. Based on these premises, it is tentatively defined a correlation equation 

(Equation 3.1.4) that may represent the number of CO2 preferential adsorption sites in the 

non-aminated PMO materials, fOH, as: 

 
fOH ? %T2SMP / %C (Equation 3.1.4) 

 
where %T2SMP and %C correspond to the percentages of T2 silanols and carbon atoms on the 

PMO material. The %C appears as uniformed weight factor of the materials. The fOH values 

for the non-aminated PMOs are compared in Table 3.1.4 with the Henry constants for the 

corresponding materials. Interestingly, the ordering of the calculated fOH values is identical 

to that of the Henry’s constants of pure CO2.

This suggests that the properties used to establish the relationship in Equation 3.1.4 are the 

most important in defining the CO2 adsorption affinities of the PhCnPMO, n = 12, 14, 16, 

and 18, materials considered in this work. 

In the case of the aminated materials, i.e., NH2PhCnPMOs, the calculation of the fOH values 

is more complicated, due to the existence of nearly 50% of phenylene moieties that could 

not be functionalized during the experimental syntheses. Moreover, the aminated phenylene 

motifs interact much more strongly with CO2 molecules than the bare phenylene moieties. 

Thus, the aminated PhCnPMOs present different degrees of hydrophobicity and different 

degrees of acidity in the same material when compared with the pristine materials. 

Additionally, different interactions between amino groups, silanol species and phenylene 

moieties can occur due to the distribution of the amino groups on the walls of the materials. 

These factors increase the degree of complexity in the determination of fOH. Still, DFT 

calculations (Sub-chapter 3.2) for the adsorption of CO2 on a periodic model of the walls of 

the aminated phenylene PMO, derived from the model developed by Martínez et al.[32] by 

substitution of a phenyl hydrogen atom with an amino group, show that the CO2 adsorbate 

interacts preferentially with the isolated T2 silanol species, in a bridging configuration where 

it also interacts with a neighboring amino group (c.f. Figure 3.1.6b). So, the main difference 

to the corresponding non-aminated PMOs is the strength of the interaction, which is slightly 

higher in the aminated materials than in the pristine PMOs. In principle, this simultaneous 

interaction of the CO2 with silanols and amino groups will have a greater probability of 

occurrence in materials having smaller pore sizes, because the pore curvature is expected to 

allow these two functional groups to be closer to each other than in the materials with larger 

pore sizes. Positively, our assumptions seem to be supported by the b affinity parameters 

(Table A1.3, Appendix A), which are found to only increase upon amination in the case of 

the C12 materials, to be similar in the case of C14 PMOs, and to decrease in the cases of the 

C16 and C18 materials. So, in the case of the materials with the largest pore sizes, the 

coefficient related to the affinity between the sorbent and the sorbate decreases upon the 

amination reaction. Thus, it can be approximated that, at low pressure, the number of sites 

for CO2 adsorption in the aminated samples is identical to the number of T2 type silanols.  

In fact, as it can be seen in Figure A1.8b, the percentage of T2SMP silanol types on the 

aminated samples is correlated with the values of the Henry constants. In this way,  

Equation 3.1.4 can also be used to calculate the number of CO2 preferential adsorption sites

in the aminated PMO materials. The calculated fOH values for the NH2PhCnPMOs materials 

are compared in Table 3.1.5 with the Henry’s constants of pure CO2.

Encouragingly, as found for the as-synthesized materials, the latter quantities are in excellent 

qualitative agreement, again suggesting that the amounts of adsorbed CO2 in these materials 

are correlated with the percentages of T2 silanols divided by the % of carbon determined by 

EA, which is a normalizing factor. As expected, the discrepancies between the two quantities 

are larger in the aminated materials than in the as-synthesized ones because of the 

heterogeneous distribution of the amino groups and of possible formation of structural 

defects upon the amination reaction. Once again, the adsorption of carbon dioxide at low 

pressure in materials displaying a large variety of organic and inorganic adsorption sites can 

be described by a very simple correlation (Equation 3.1.4). This observation is a convincing 

sign of the local nature of the adsorption mechanism, which involves a quite limited number 

of surface atoms, and it is in agreement with recent theoretical studies on these materials.[32] 

 
Comparison to other materials 

The capacity of NH2PhC12PMO to capture carbon dioxide and methane is compared in Table 

3.1.6 with the capacities reported in the literature for other classes of adsorbents, namely, 

metal organic frameworks (MOFs), zeolites, zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIFs), silicas, 

carbons and clays. Notice that data were determined at different temperatures with 

concomitant effects on the values of the capacities. For instance, in the case of the MAC 

(microwave activated carbon) material, a 20% reduction in the CO2 capacity is found on 

increasing temperature from 25 °C to 35 °C. A similar reduction (of 27%) was also found 

for the PhC18PMO when enhancing the temperature from 25 °C to 35 °C. Although, the ratio 

of adsorption capacity of CO2/CH4 is improved with this increase of temperature. The results 

obtained for the PMO materials in this work were obtained at the 35 °C and a pressure of  

1 bar.

Table 3.1.6. Capacities of different adsorbents in the CO2/CH4 separation at 1 bar. 

 

The data in Table 3.1.6 show that the capacity of the NH2PhC12PMO material to adsorb 

either CO2 or CH4 is quite low when compared to the other materials, but the ratio between 

the capacities for CO2 and CH4 is among the best. Importantly, the capacity to adsorb 

methane is very low which may be seen as very convenient for separation processes. If one 

compares the ratios of the capacities for capturing the two gases by different materials 

reported in literature with our best material (NH2PhC12PMO), measured at the same 

temperature and pressure (35 °C, 1 bar), it is possible to verify that the NH2PhC12PMO 

material presents a relatively high capacity ratio, being superior than both MAC and 

activated carbon, 5.8 versus 2.1 and 2.3, respectively. Additionally, the capacity ratio of 

NH2PhC12PMO is similar to those obtained in most of zeolites presented in Table 3.1.6 at 

the same working conditions, showing that PMO materials incorporating different 

functionalities can be good candidates for CO2/CH4 separation processes.

3.1.4 Conclusions 

To summarize, amine-modified phenylene PMOs with different pore sizes were successfully 

synthetized and characterized. All pristine and amine-modified phenylene PMO materials 

showed two-dimensional hexagonal symmetry (p6mm) lattice and molecular-scale 

periodicities observed by PXRD and TEM. It was evaluated the performance of the materials 

on adsorption of pure carbon dioxide and methane at 35 °C at low pressure. The adsorption 

of CO2 was much higher than that of CH4, anticipating high CO2 selectivity. Direct 

correlations between the amounts of CO2 adsorbed and material pore sizes or specific surface 

areas were not found. In order to understand the differences obtained for the CO2 adsorption 

within all materials, the Henry’s constants of adsorption were determined, as well as their 

chemical features. A simple expression considering the % of T2SMP silanol species was found 

to provide a good prediction of the experimental Henry’s law constants for pure CO2 

adsorption on each material. The adsorbent with the best chemical features to adsorb CO2 

was the NH2PhC12PMO, presenting a Henry constant of 0.56 mmol·g-1·bar-1 at 35 °C. 

However, the corresponding Henry constant for CH4 is extremely low (0.06 mmol·g-1·bar-1 

at 35 °C), turning it potentially interesting for the separation of this gas from CO2. 

PMOs can be used as adsorbents with improved characteristics for CO2 

adsorption/separation from CH4 at low pressure. For that, they should present high degree 

of silica condensation (high amounts of T2 silanols and small quantities of T1 silanols). In 

addition, the pore sizes and BET surfaces seem not to play a direct role on the adsorption 

capacities, our results may indicate the existence of an indirect relation. Thus, the pore size 

should affect the curvature of the pore, the degree of condensation and thus the silanol type 

content. This information may be used in the future to design more effective functionalized 

PMO materials for biogas upgrading.

3.2.1 Motivation 

Having into account the strong need for a major breakthrough in finding an optimal 

adsorbent for the CO2/CH4 separation, the chemical modification of the benzene moieties in 

the PMO framework with, for instance, basic amino groups, can be accomplished to optimize 

their features for the separation of these gases, i.e., by enhancing interactions with one of the 

gases.[25] These functional groups can additionally display interesting synergistic effects in 

materials that already exhibit high ?-? conjugation and mixed hydrophobic/hydrophilic 

character. 

Our main aim in this work is to introduce amine modifications in PhPMO in order to 

increment the interactions with CO2 without improving those with CH4 gases. This strategy 

will improve the potential of these materials to separate CO2/CH4 mixtures, i.e., making these 

materials candidates for biogas upgrading. As it was described and understood in  

Sub-chapter 3.1, the amination of the PhPMO (NH2PhPMO) is only effective on materials 

with small pore size, improving the affinity to the CO2 gas. In the present work, non-

functionalized (PhC12PMO) and amine functionalized PhC12PMOs (NH2PhC12PMO), 

having pore sizes of approximately 2.5 nm, were synthesized following the strategy reported 

in Sub-chapter 3.1. Two additional materials, i.e., APTMS@PhC12PMO and 

APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO, were obtained by post-grafting 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane 

(APTMS) into the PhC12PMO and NH2PhC12PMO materials. Thus, different kinds of amines 

were incorporated into the PhC12PMO through two different methodologies. Theoretical and 

experimental gas adsorption studies were carried out to evaluate the affinities of these 

materials towards CO2 and CH4, and to understand the interactions between the materials’ 

functional groups and these two gases. To the best of our knowledge only a single previous 

experimental study describes the grafting of the APTMS to the free silanols of the 

PhC12PMO, but the resulting material (APTMS@PhC12PMO) presented large pore sizes and 

was only tested in the adsorption of CO2.[25] Similarly, few theoretical studies of PMOs were 

published in the literature,[22] and none of them evaluate phenylene bridge or silanol 

functionalized PMO materials for gas adsorption/separation. After validation of the 

computational approach, additional calculations were performed to predict if other 

functional groups, e.g. –NO2, –SO3H, –NH(iPr) and –CH2NH2, were also effective in 

promoting selective interactions with CO2. The results of our study highlight the potential of 



Chapter 3

a synergistic approach involving theory and experiment to guide the rational design of 

materials for gas separation applications. 

 

3.2.2 Experimental and computational details 

Synthesis of PMOs. 

The syntheses of PhC12PMO and the NH2PhC12PMO are described in Sub-chapter 3.1.2. The 

materials APTMS@PhC12PMO and APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO were obtained from 

PhC12PMO and NH2PhC12PMO, respectively, as can be observed in Figure 3.2.1. To prepare 

the APTMS@PhC12PMO and APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO materials, 1 g of PhC12PMO and 

NH2PhC12PMO were dried at 80 °C under vacuum atmosphere during 3 h. After the 

activation of the pores, dry dichloromethane (10 mL) was added and 

(3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (0.439 g) was added drop wise to the suspension. The 

mixtures were vigorously stirred for 48 h. The obtained materials were filtered off and 

further washed with a large amount of distilled water and dried in an oven at 60 °C overnight. 

The APTMS post-grafting reaction was repeated for two additional cycles.

Characterization of PMOs. 

The structural order and the textural physical properties of all PMO materials were evaluated 

by PXRD, -196 °C N2-sorption isotherms and TEM. 29Si MAS NMR and 13C and  
29Si CP-MAS NMR spectra were collected to check the stability of the Si-C bonds in the 

PMOs and to verify the chemical structure of the organic bridge, respectively. FTIR 

spectroscopy was also used to verify the chemical bonds of all prepared PMOs. The nitrogen 

density was determined by EA. PXRD, N2–sorption isotherms, 29Si NMR, FTIR, TGA and 

EA and some other data is presented in Appendix A. 

 

Gas adsorption details. 

Adsorption isotherms of CO2 and CH4 on prepared samples were measured up to 1000 kPa 

at 25 °C, using the volumetric method, using the procedure described in Sub-chapter 2.6. 

Each experimental pure component adsorption isotherm was fitted using the Virial model, 

where the non-ideality of the gas phase was taken into account by using the second and third 

virial coefficients, and the experimental excess adsorbed amounts were converted to the 

absolute adsorbed amounts by taking into account the porous volume of the material and the 

density of the gas phase using the virial coefficients. Selectivity values were estimated using 

a method proposed by Myers[41] and the implementation is described in detail in previous 

works.[15] The virial equation of state fitted to the adsorption data is in the form:

where KH is the Henry constant, and C1, C2, and C3 are the constants of the virial-series

Adsorption isotherms of pure CO2 and CH4 were also measured on as-synthesized and 

amine-modified PMO materials at 35 °C and pressures up to 200 kPa using an in-house built 

manometric apparatus. The samples were activated first at 80 °C during 5 h and then at  

160 °C during 10 h, under vacuum of ca. 1.4 kPa. The CO2 and CH4 gases were used as 

provided by Air Liquide (France), with a purity of 99.998% and 99.95%, respectively. The 

experimental adsorption measurements technique adopted was also previously described.[30]

DFT calculations. 

Periodic slab calculations were performed with the VASP computer code.[42–44] DFT 

calculations considered the PBE exchange-correlation functional,[45] based on the GGA. The 

non-spin polarized DFT calculations include a correction for the van der Waals interactions 

according to the D2 method proposed by Grimme using the default parameters.[46–48] The 

suitability of the PBE-D2 approach is supported by results in a previous study where the 

calculated adsorption energy for CO with PhPMO (-14.3 kJ·mol-1)[32] was found to be in 

close agreement with the experimental adsorption enthalpy (-13.2 kJ·mol-1)[24] obtained from 

variable temperature infrared (VTIR) spectroscopy and with the range of binding energies 

calculated with the B3LYP-D approach for CO interacting with cluster models.[22,24] Valence 

electrons were described by plane-wave basis sets and core electrons with projector-

augmented wave (PAW) potentials.[49] A kinetic energy cutoff of 415 eV was used. The 

atomic positions in the supercells used to model the walls of the different PMO materials 

were fully relaxed with the quasi-Newton algorithm, and the stopping-criteria for electronic 

and ionic updates were 10-7 eV and -0.05 eV/Å, respectively. Dipole corrections in the 

direction perpendicular to the PMO wall were applied. 

The cell dimensions and the atomic coordinates for the structural model of the walls in the  

PhPMO material were kindly provided by Martínez and Pacchioni.[32] The structure is shown 

in Figure 3.2.2 and corresponds to a sequence of six and four member rings of organosilica 

tetrahedra with T3 to T2 [Tm=RSi(OH)(3-m)(OSi)m, in which R represents an organic group] 

silicon environments in a ratio of 2:1, grounded on information from solid state NMR 

obtained by Comotti et al.[50] Notice that Martínez and Pacchioni[32] considered also a 

structural model of the walls of the nanopores based on a sequence of six member rings only, 

with T3 to T2 in a ratio of 1:1, derived from the three-dimensional periodic lattice having the 

planes of the aromatic rings parallel to each other reported by Inagaki et al.[28], but found the 

former structure, with non-planar benzene moieties, to be more stable (~ 30 kJ·mol-1 per 

formula unit) than the latter. Important for the discussion below is the fact that the adsorption 

energy of CO2 – either in the model with six and four member rings or with six rings only – 

is about 50% larger than that corresponding to CH4. Thus, the information obtained with one 

or the other model is expected to be qualitatively similar.

grafting, i.e., by substitution of a silanol H atom by an R’ group (R’ = APTMS). Purple is used for 
the substituent groups and color code for remaining spheres as in Figure 3.2.2. 
 

The structures of the functionalized materials were obtained by single substitution of protons 

in the aromatic rings of the unit cell of PhPMO shown in Figure 3.2.2 by different functional 

R groups, e.g. –NH2, –NO2, –NH-i-Pr, –CH2NH2 and –SO3H (c.f. Figure 3.2.3). The 



Chapter 3 

96 

 

selection of the functional groups considered above was primarily based on their different 

polarities and on the presence of amine moieties, which in principle will be beneficial for 

improving the interactions with CO2 without changing significantly those with CH4. The 

substitution was made at several different positions and the structures of the models obtained 

were fully relaxed. Since the unit cell in Figure 3.2.2 contains three phenyl groups, this 

strategy led to the functionalization of 33% of the aromatic rings, which is similar to the 

maximum functionalization obtained experimentally (see below). The model corresponding 

to the functionalization with the APTMS group (R’) was obtained by introduction of this 

group at the free silanol (substitution of the proton by APTMS) available in the structure of 

the PhPMO model (c.f. Figure 3.2.3). The percentage of APTMS groups grafted to the PMO 

was 50%. 

The models described above were used to study separately the adsorption of CO2 and CH4 

by fully optimizing the atomic positions of the adsorbate/adsorbent complex. The adsorption 

energies were calculated as standard practice by subtracting the energies of the individual 

adsorbate and adsorbent fragments from the energy of the complex. Thus, negative values 

of the energy correspond to favorable gas/PMO interactions. 

 

3.2.3 Results and discussion 

Characterization of materials. 

The structural integrity of the prepared adsorbents was determined from the combination of 

PXRD and N2 sorption isotherms. Figure A2.1 (Appendix A) shows the PXRD diffraction 

patterns of PhC12PMO, NH2PhC12PMO, APTMS@PhC12PMO and 

APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO materials. The pristine PhC12PMO possesses a two-dimensional 

hexagonal symmetry (p6mm) lattice with a d spacing of 3.59 nm for the strong (100) 

reflection at low-angle (Table A2.1, Appendix A). In the case of the aminated samples, slight 

changes are observed in the PXRD (Figure A2.1, Appendix A) corresponding to the loss of 

definition of the 2D hexagonal arrangement, which is in agreement with the introduction of 

the amine functional groups inside the pores since some loss of regularity in the structure is 

expected during the amination reactions.[51] The lattice parameters of the hexagonal array of 

mesopores (calculated from the 2? values of the (100) peaks) obtained for the 

NH2PhC12PMO, APTMS@PhC12PMO and APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO samples are 3.63, 

3.34 and 3.50 nm, respectively (Table A2.1, Appendix A). The molecular-scale periodicity 



Chapter 3 

97 

 

in the PhC12PMO pore walls along the channel direction is observed by the presence of a 

medium-range reflection at d ~ 0.76 nm.[28] The pristine material and all amine 

functionalized materials present these peaks at the same d spacing. Thus, the preparation of 

different amine functionalized phenylene PMOs is made with the preservation of both meso- 

and molecular-order. 

The presence of different amine functional groups inside the pore was confirmed by N2 

adsorption–desorption experiments, with isotherms depicted in Figure A2.2 (Appendix A). 

The parent PhC12PMO exhibits a type IV isotherm[52], typically detected for conventional 

mesoporous materials such as MCM-41[53], indicating narrow distribution of mesopores of 

uniform size. The introduction of the amine functional groups (NH2 group in the aromatic 

moieties or/and APTMS covalently bonded to the free silanols) into the mesochannels is 

supported by the reduction of the BET surface area and pore volume (Table A2.1 and Figure 

A2.2, Appendix A). The PhC12PMO, NH2PhC12PMO, APTMS@PhC12PMO and 

APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO materials present BET surface areas of 1004, 924, 634 and 

305 m²?g-1, respectively (Table A2.1, Appendix A). The reduction in surface area and pore 

volume is much more pronounced for the APTMS-containing materials, due to the bulky 

nature of this group, which protrudes within the pore space. A comparison of the pore size 

distribution (PSD) curves of pristine PMO and amine functionalized PhC12PMO materials 

is presented in Figure A2.3 (Appendix A) and in Table A2.1, and reveals a maximum shifting 

from 2.54 to 2.23 nm, respectively. 

Solid-state 13C CP-MAS NMR, 29Si MAS and CP-MAS NMR spectra of PhC12PMO,  

NH2PhC12PMO, APTMS@C12PMO and APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO materials are displayed 

in Figures 3.2.4 and A2.4 (Appendix A), respectively. 13C CP-MAS NMR spectra support 

the different amine functionalizations of PhC12PMO materials. The parent PMO 

(Figure 3.2.4a) shows a characteristic resonance at 133 ppm that corresponds to the C of the 

phenylene bridge as reported in the literature.[28]

c) APTMS@PhC12PMO and d) APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO. The asterisks correspond to the spinning 
side bands. The number symbol denotes traces of surfactant. 
 

On the other hand, the spectra for the NH2PhC12PMO material presents resonances at ca. 

121, 133 and 151 ppm assigned to the distinct sp2 carbons associated to the amine 

functionalized phenylene group. These results are in agreement with previous reports for 

NH2PhC12PMO.[27] As expected, the spectrum for APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO also displays 

the three characteristic peaks corresponding to aminated phenyl groups, while that of 

APTMS@PhC12PMO displays the single resonance at 133 ppm. The grafting of the APTMS 

to the free silanols in both PhC12PMO and NH2PhC12PMO is verified by 

29Si NMR measurements (Figure A2.4, Appendix A). The three resonances appearing at ca. 

10, 22 and 43 ppm in the 13C CP-MAS NMR spectra correspond to the carbons of the propyl 

chain of the APTMS@PhC12PMO and APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO materials 

 (Figure 3.2.4c-d). Figure 3.2.4d shows a tiny peak at around 164 ppm that is assigned to 

amines binding CO2 from the atmosphere. 

The 29Si MAS and CP-MAS NMR spectra (Figure A2.4, Appendix A) of the pristine 

PhC12PMO display resonances at ca. -82, -71 and -61 ppm assigned to T3, T2 and T1  

(Tm = SiR(OSi)m(OH)3-m) organosiliceous species, respectively. The strong acid treatment 

used in the amination reaction of the pristine PhC12PMO material induces, in very slight

amounts, the carbon–silicon bond cleavage of the BTEB precursor; this is observed by the 

presence of a faint resonance at ca. -91 ppm (Figure A2.4, Appendix A) corresponding to 

Q2 [Qn = Si(OSi)n(OH)4-n] species. The grafting of the APTMS to the T1 and T2 silanols of 

both PhC12PMO and NH2PhC12PMO leads to the reduction in intensity of the resonances 

corresponding to these species (see Figure A2.4 and Table A2.2, Appendix A) with respect 

to T3 environments. In addition, a new resonance appears at ca. -58 ppm, labeled as T2’ in 

this work (Figure A2.4, Appendix A), corresponding to the silanol species of the APTMS 

silicon atom. It is worth mentioning that the difference between T2 and T2’ species is due, 

respectively, to the presence of an aromatic and an alkylamine carbon residue bonded to the 

Si center. 

The functionalization of the PhC12PMO material was also followed by FTIR (Figure A2.5, 

Appendix A). The presence of aromatic primary amines in the NH2PhC12PMO is confirmed 

by the C–N stretching band at 1265 cm-1 and the in plane N–H bending vibration close to 

1620 cm-1. This latter band overlaps with the band of H–O–H bending vibrations and the  

N–H stretching modes appearing at 3400 and 3352 cm-1. The amino group of the APTMS in 

APTMS@PhC12PMO and in APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO materials presents N–H stretching 

modes appearing at 3356 cm-1and at 3354 and 3402 cm-1, respectively. The aromatic C–H 

stretching bands appear in the parent PMO at 3065 cm-1, while in the NH2PhC12PMO they 

appear at 3066 cm-1 and in the APTMS grafted amine functionalized and non-functionalized 

PhC12PMOs they appear at 3064 cm-1. The APTMS@PhC12PMO and the 

APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO materials present the C–H stretching vibrations for saturated 

aliphatic species at 2862 and 2928 cm-1 and at 2867 and 2939 cm-1, respectively. 

The introduction of the amino group in the phenylene moieties of PhC12PMOs and the 

grafting of APTMS to the free silanols of PhC12PMO lead to a reduction of thermal stability 

from 600 °C to 400 °C and to 300 °C, respectively, as observed by TGA 

(Figure A2.6, Appendix A). The PhC12PMO material presenting both types of amines  

(NH2 and APTMS) is thermally stable only up to 250 °C. 

Table A2.3 (Appendix A) presents the density of amino groups in the PhC12PMO materials 

determined by EA. The NH2PhC12PMO has a nitrogen percentage of 2.58% that corresponds 

to amine density of 1.85 mmol?g-1. The grafting of APTMS into the PhC12PMO leads to a 

density of amino groups of 1.39 mmol?g-1. The APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO has a total amine 



Chapter 3 

100 

 

density of 2.60 mmol?g-1, which results from the sum of the aromatic amine density of  

1.85 mmol?g-1 and of the APTMS amine density of 0.75 mmol?g-1. 

 
Experimental pure-component adsorption isotherms. 

Pure-component adsorption isotherms of CO2 and CH4 at 25 °C are shown in Figure 3.2.5. 

The Henry’s constant (KH) was determined for each pure gas adsorbed in each material using 

the Virial model in order to evaluate the interaction of the chemical surface of our materials 

with pure CO2 and pure CH4 at low coverage. The fitting parameters for the Virial model are 

provided in Table 3.2.1. 

The adsorption isotherms in Figure 3.2.5 suggest that the introduction of the amines into the 

PhC12PMO material leads to an increase in the amount of adsorbed CO2 and in the Henry’s 

constants, increasing in the order PhC12PMO &amp;lt;NH2PhC12PMO &amp;lt;APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO 

&amp;lt;APTMS@PhC12PMO, i.e., the non-functionalized material presents less affinity for CO2 

than the aminated samples. In the case of methane adsorption, the PhC12PMO material has 

the highest adsorption affinity, manifested in the highest Henry’s constant (Table 3.2.1), 

although the differences observed for the different materials suggest that in all cases the 

adsorption is significantly lower than that observed for CO2.

The amine functionalization of the aromatic moieties of the PhC12PMO leads to, as expected, 

a reduction of the BET surface area and pore volume (Table A2.1, Appendix A) but the CO2 

adsorption affinity is slightly increased (Table 3.2.1). This is a consequence of the 

introduction of amino groups covalently bonded to the phenylene bridges of the PhC12PMO 

material, corresponding to a nitrogen content of 2.58% (Table A2.3, Appendix A). This is 

better noticed when the adsorption isotherms are normalized by the BET surface area (Figure 

3.2.5b). Therefore, the introduction of an aromatic amine into the PMO channels reveals that 

the chemical functionalization of the PMO material is more important for CO2 capture than 

the amplitude of textural properties such as the surface area and pore diameter. This is a 

consequence of the energetically more important interactions between the CO2 molecules 

and the amino groups than with other sites available in the parent PhC12PMO material. 

Table 3.2.1 demonstrates that the NH2PhC12PMO material has slightly lower affinity for 

CH4 than PhC12PMO, suggesting that the introduction of the amine moiety at the aromatic 

rings weakens the interaction of PMO with CH4. This tiny reduction in the CH4 adsorption 

is also in accordance with the decrease in the BET surface area and pore volume. Still, the 

adsorption of CH4 is small in both cases. The grafting of the APTMS onto the silanols of the 

pristine PhC12PMO to obtain the APTMS@PhC12PMO material is accompanied by a very 

pronounced decrease of its surface area and pore volume.

The nitrogen content (Table A2.3, Appendix A) of APTMS@PhC12PMO is 1.93%, which 

can be compared with that determined for NH2PhC12PMO (2.58%). Interestingly, the former 

displays higher adsorption capacity and Henry’s constant for CO2 than the latter material, 

thus revealing that the type of amine has a stronger influence on the sorption capacity for 



Chapter 3

CO2 than the amount of nitrogen introduced in the PMO channels, suggesting that alkyl 

amines interact more favorably with CO2 than the aromatic amines, because the former 

amines present higher basicity than the latter.[54] 

The APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO material shows lower adsorption capacity for CO2  

(c.f. Figure 3.2.5a) than APTMS@PhC12PMO, but when the adsorption isotherm is 

expressed taking into account the BET surface area (Figure 3.2.5b) a substantial increase in 

the adsorption of CO2 can be perceived. This is likely to be due to the larger degree of 

amination resulting from the simultaneous presence of aromatic and alkyl amines in the same 

PMO material, despite the concomitant lower BET surface area (305 m2?g-1) and pore size 

(2.23 nm) when compared with the other materials described above, c.f. Table A2.1 

(Appendix A). Note that this material only presents 0.75 mmol·g-1 of APTMS amine density, 

much lower than in APTMS@PhC12PMO (1.39 mmol·g-1), and this type of amine interacts 

more strongly with the CO2 molecule than the aromatic amine. 

The Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST)[55] was applied to the analysis of the adsorption 

data by fitting the Virial equation to the pure-component isotherms and calculating the 

selectivity of the separation and the equilibrium phase diagrams using a method proposed 

by Myers[41] with the implementation described in detail in previous works.[14,15] As can be 

seen in Figure 3.2.6, the differences in the predicted selectivities exhibited by the different 

materials for the CO2/CH4 separation can be quite large. In fact, the materials with APTMS 

groups grafted to the silanols of the PMO present much higher selectivity values than 

PhC12PMO and NH2PhC12PMO. These two latter materials present similar selectivity, but it 

can be noticed that there are a slight increase in the selectivity at low pressures for 

NH2PhC12PMO (3.6 at 100 kPa) when compared with PhC12PMO (3.2 at 100 kPa).

This indicates that the aromatic amine is not bringing the desired effect in the selectivity 

over the entire range of pressures (Table 3.2.1). Variation of selectivity with pressure is also 

seen in the case of the APTMS materials. At low pressures, APTMS@PhC12PMO presents 

higher selectivity than APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO but this ordering is reversed at higher 

pressures. This is most probably related with the kind of amines and their amount present on 

the materials. The APTMS@PhC12PMO material presents only alkyl amines that seem to 

interact more strongly with CO2 than aromatic amines. Alkyl amines are also available in 

APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO material but their amount, determined by EA, is one half of the 

amount of aminopropyl groups presented in APTMS@PhC12PMO (Table A2.3,  

Appendix A). Thus, at low pressure, APTMS@PhC12PMO shows better selectivity than  

APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO because of the more important role of the type of amine than of 

its quantity. Still, the nitrogen content in the latter PMO is larger than that in the former  

(2.60 versus 1.39 mmol?g-1). The interaction of CO2 with the aromatic amines is less 

favorable than with the alkylamines of grafted APTMS moieties but is more stable than any 

other site available in these PMOs. Hence, at high pressure, the larger amount of amines in 

APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO dictates a better selectivity for CO2. These effects are even clearer 

in the ratio of the values of the Henry constants determined for CO2 and CH4 adsorption on 

each of the materials studied experimentally in this work (Table 3.2.1), which can be also 

used as an estimate of the ability of the materials for separating these gases. As can be seen

in Table 3.2.1, the largest ratio was calculated for APTMS@PhC12PMO, which appears to 

be the most interesting adsorbent for CO2/CH4 separation. 

The impact of all of the variables on the separation is illustrated in Figure 3.2.7, where it can 

be observed that APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO shows slightly better performance than  

APTMS@PhC12PMO.

PhC12PMO (green line) and NH2PhC12PMO (purple line). yCH4 is the molar fraction of methane in 

the gas phase; xCH4 is the molar fraction of methane in the adsorbed phase. 
 

Moreover, these two materials are much better than PhC12PMO and NH2PhC12PMO. 

Considering a 0.5 molar composition of methane (yCH4), a reasonable value for biogas 

composition and some natural gas sources, the composition in the adsorbed phase (xCH4) is 

0.02 on APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO and 0.06 on APTMS@PhC12PMO, at 500 kPa and 

25 °C. Thus, the adsorbed phase is much richer in carbon dioxide than in methane for both 

materials with an adsorption of almost pure carbon dioxide (about 0.94 – 0.98 molar 

composition at 500 kPa and 25 °C) at 0.5 composition in the gas phase. Complete phase 

diagrams were also obtained (Figure A2.7, Appendix A), which confirm a similar 

performance of these two materials. 

Important for establishing the adequacy of these materials for typical adsorptive applications 

is the understanding of any structural changes upon degasification. After adsorption 

experiments, the aminated materials were reactivated using vacuum during 4 h at 100 °C.

The 15N CP-MAS NMR spectrum of reactivated NH2PhC12PMO (Figure 3.2.8a) presents a 

peak corresponding to an aromatic amine at ca. -321 ppm, which is in agreement with the 

literature.[27] The absence of additional peaks in NH2PhC12PMO confirms that no CO2 

molecules are left covalently bonded to the aromatic amines of the material. Upon grafting 

with APTMS (APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO), four peaks were observed at ca. -262, -295,  

-320, and -348 ppm (Figure 3.2.8b). The latter two resonances are assigned to the aromatic 

amine and to the propylamine groups, respectively. The remaining resonances at ca. -262 

and -295 ppm are assigned to species containing a carbonyl group resulting from the 

chemisorption of the CO2 molecules. The presence of such species is also evident in the 

 13C CP-MAS NMR showing resonances at ca. 178 and 164 ppm (Figure A2.8, Appendix 

A), confirming the observations in the 15N CP-MAS spectra, i.e., a minor quantity of CO2 

remains bonded to the amines after activation at 100 °C. The 13C resonance appearing at  

164 ppm has been assigned to carbamate species by solid-state NMR and FTIR,[56] and is 

associated to the presence of the peak at -265 ppm in the 15N CP-MAS NMR. The peak at 

178 ppm appears only when CO2 is adsorbed into the APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO material, 

which coincides with the presence of a distinct resonance at -262 ppm in the 15N CP-MAS 

NMR for this same material. Thus, it is assumed that this resonance, in a chemical shift 

region typical of carbonyl groups, is due to a chemisorbed CO2 species involving the 

simultaneous participation of the aromatic and aliphatic amines. The nature of such species 

cannot be unambiguously assigned from the data in the present study as this would require 

further experiments under well controlled conditions (pressure, temperature, moisture 

levels). The spectrum of APTMS@PhC12PMO after material activation shows the presence 

of two peaks at ca. -293 and -352 ppm (Figure 3.2.8c). The latter peak is assigned to APTMS 

attached to the surface of the material, while the former peak corresponds to carbamate 

species as observed for analogous materials also functionalized with the aminopropyl 

group.[56] The persistence of CO2 species after the degassing procedure above-mentioned is 

not surprising. Indeed, it was previously shown that higher temperature was needed (about 

150 °C) to completely remove the CO2 from amine functionalized materials, and at 100 °C 

only about 91% of bonded CO2 could be removed.[56]

All prepared materials were also tested for adsorption of pure CH4 and CO2, but measured 

in a pressure range between 0 and 200 kPa at 35 °C. Figure A2.9 and Table A2.4 (Appendix 

A) show the results obtained for the most promising material, APTMS@PhC12PMO. As 

expected, APTMS@PhC12PMO adsorbs more CO2 amount at 25 °C than at 35 °C, given that 

adsorption is an exothermic process. The CH4 pure adsorption capacities and the related 

Henry’s constant are similar for both temperatures (25 °C and 35 °C), but this is most likely 

because of the low adsorbed amounts of this gas together with the relatively small 

temperature difference between isotherms (10 °C), which makes it difficult observe the 

effect of temperature.

The APTMS (–Si(OH)2C3H5NH2) group was grafted onto the free silanols (Si-OH) of the 

most favorable structures optimized for PhPMO and NH2PhPMO to obtain models of the 

walls of the APTMS@PhPMO and APTMS@NH2PhPMO materials, respectively. Several 

different starting configurations of the APTMS moiety were considered because of the high 

number of degrees of freedom of this group. The two most favorable positions for each 

APTMS functionalized PhPMO are presented in Figure 3.2.10. The adsorption energies for 

the CO2 and CH4 molecules interacting with each of the PMO models described above are 

reported in Table 3.2.2, and views of the most favorable locations are given in Figure 3.2.11.  

The PBE-D2 energies for CO2 adsorption vary between -19.8 kJ·mol-1 in the case of the 

parent PhPMO and -29.0 kJ·mol-1 for the APTMS@PhPMO material, while for CH4 the 

adsorption energies are in the interval between -9.5 and -13.7 kJ·mol-1 for 

APTMS@NH2PhPMO and APTMS@PhPMO, respectively. Thus, the adsorption energies 

of CO2 with the different materials are much higher than the adsorption energies obtained 

for CH4 and, despite the limitations associated to the structural models used and the 

non-consideration of kinetic data, the calculated results are in line with the strength of the 

Henry’s constants calculated from experimental adsorption isotherms (Table 3.2.1). 

In particular, the adsorption energies for CO2 increase in the order PhPMO &amp;lt;NH2PhPMO &amp;lt;

APTMS@NH2PhPMO &amp;lt;APTMS@PhPMO, which is the same order obtained for the 

Henry’s constants for the CO2 gas. The ratio between the adsorption energies calculated for 

CO2 and CH4 molecules on the same material shows the highest value for

From the views of the optimized configurations shown in Figure 3.2.11 and from the values 

of selected atomic distances reported in Table A2.5 (Appendix A) it can be concluded that 

CO2 interacts preferentially with the silanol group in the case of PhPMO, with a 

SiOH···OCO nearest-neighbor distance of 2.28 Å. In the case of NH2PhPMO, the CO2 

interaction occurs with both the silanol and amino groups at nearest-neighbor distances of 

2.45 and 2.60 Å, respectively. For APTMS@PhPMO, CO2 interacts with both the amino 

group and an acidic hydrogen (H20) of the alkyl chain of the APTMS group at nearest-

neighbor distances of 2.58 and 2.75 Å, respectively. The CO2 in APTMS@NH2PhPMO 

interacts with the silanol group and an acidic hydrogen (H20) of the alkyl chain of the 

APTMS group, at nearest-neighbor distances of 2.45 and 2.62 Å, respectively. A direct 

relationship between geometric parameters and calculated adsorption energies is unclear, 

with the exception that in the case of the parent compound the CO2 molecule is interacting

with a single site on the PMO wall while in the aminated materials the most favorable 

interactions involve two sites. This is likely to be the main cause for the significantly more 

favorable adsorption energies observed in all the aminated materials with respect to the 

pristine PhPMO (Table 3.2.2).

In the case of methane, the interactions seem to be predominantly with a hydrogen atom 

from the aromatic ring in the case of the PhPMO material; with the amino group in the case 

of NH2PhPMO; in the cavity defined by the hydrogen atoms from the silanol (H29) and 

amino (H28) groups and from the alkyl chain of the APTMS (H20) group in the case of 

APTMS@PhPMO; and with the hydrogen atom (H29) of one free silanol of the aminopropil 

group (APTMS) in the case of APTMS@NH2PhPMO. The nearest-neighbor distances 

(Table A2.5, Appendix A) are 3.07, 2.36, 2.58 and 2.14 Å, respectively. 

As in the case of CO2, a direct relationship between the calculated energies and the selected 

geometrical parameters is not evident. Nevertheless, it arises that the interaction of methane 

with the models having an amino group in the aromatic ring is weaker than those calculated 

for the corresponding materials without such groups (c.f. compare adsorption energies 

reported in Table 3.2.2 for PhPMO and APTMS@PhPMO with those for NH2PhPMO and 

APTMS@NH2PhPMO). 

From the pure CO2 and CH4 experimental adsorption in the prepared PMO, it is possible to 

conclude that all these materials adsorb similar amounts of methane, in very small quantities, 

while the CO2 adsorption is much higher. Therefore, it is more relevant to examine the CO2 

adsorption energies calculated for the prepared materials than the adsorption energies 

obtained for CH4.

The correlation between the adsorption energies obtained for the CO2 molecules and the 

Henry’s constants for the CO2 adsorption in each material are in good agreement, showing

that despite the inherent limitations of the computational model (for example, consideration 

of a single lowest energy adsorption site, thus neglecting entropic factors), it can be used to 

predict the potential of other functionalized phenylene-PMOs for the adsorption of CO2 or 

for the separation of CO2 from CH4. 

 
Molecular simulation of other R functionalized PhPMO materials. 

Since the adsorption energies calculated with DFT for CO2 and CH4 in the parent and 

aminated PhPMOs compared well with the experimentally determined gas adsorption 

capacities of such materials, further DFT calculations were performed to understand how 

other functional groups (e.g. –NO2, –NH-i-Pr, –CH2NH2 and –SO3H) interact with CO2 and 

CH4, with the purpose of optimizing resources and avoiding the synthesis of ineffective 

materials. These functional groups were chosen on the basis of their different polarities and 

of the ease of preparation of PMO-functionalized materials.[27,28] To enable direct 

comparison with the results presented in the previous section, only one third of the aromatic 

phenylene moieties were functionalized with such groups. The two most favorable 

configurations for each new PMO derived from PhPMO obtained after full optimization are 

presented in Figure 3.2.12. The interaction of CO2 and CH4 molecules with the two 

configurations in Figure 3.2.12 for each RPhPMO was analyzed by DFT. The calculated 

adsorption energies are reported in Table 3.2.3 and the final configurations for the two 

adsorbates interacting with each material are depicted in Figure 3.2.13. Selected geometrical 

parameters are supplied in Table A2.6 (Appendix A). 

The comparison of the energetic data in Tables 3.2.2 and 3.2.3 shows that the introduction 

of the nitro group (–NO2) in the phenylene moieties of the PhPMOs increases slightly the 

interaction of both CO2 (-2.1 kJ?mol-1) and CH4 (-0.4 kJ?mol-1). These tiny differences seem 

to be associated to the interaction of the carbon atom of CO2 and one of the hydrogen atoms 

of CH4 with an oxygen atom of the nitro group (Table A2.6, Appendix A). The DFT results 

suggest that nitrated materials are less promising than the aminated PMOs for this separation.

The introduction of an iso-propylamine group in the phenylene bridge of PhPMO leads to 

significant increases in the adsorption energies calculated for both CO2 (-7.8 kJ?mol-1) and 

CH4 (-4.7 kJ?mol-1) when compared with the parent PhPMO value. However, relative to 

NH2PhPMO, the CO2 energy is only slightly increased, while that of methane increases more 

significantly. These changes are most likely a consequence of improved interactions of CO2 

with the amine moiety and of methane with the propyl groups. Indeed, some  

authors,[16,57] reported that propyl amines can improve the interaction with CO2. 

Nevertheless, based on the DFT adsorption energies calculated in this work, the  

i-PrNHPhPMO material is anticipated to present similar CO2 adsorption capacity but poorer 

selectivity for CO2/CH4 separations than those observed for NH2PhPMO. Since an additional 



Chapter 3

synthetic step is required to obtain i-PrNHPhPMO, the latter becomes less interesting than 

NH2PhPMO for this adsorption application.

The material with the –CH2NH2 functional group shows the strongest adsorption energy with 

the CO2 molecule of all PhPMOs studied in this work. The adsorption energy is  

-31.1 kJ?mol-1, i.e., an increase of -2.1 kJ·mol-1 when compared with APTMS@PhPMO, 

suggesting that the former material may show more interesting CO2 adsorption affinity than 

the latter without significantly changing the selectivity of the CO2/CH4 separation. 

Finally, the calculated energies for the substitution of a hydrogen atom in the phenylene ring 

by a sulfonic acid group (–SO3H) suggest that the resulting material will have adsorption 

profiles for CO2 and CH4 similar to those displayed by NH2PhPMO and  

APTMS@NH2PhPMO. Interestingly, the CO2 molecule interacts with the hydrogen atom 

from the -SiOH group but not with that from the –SO3H group. This suggests that the 

interaction with the former is more important and that the quite short distance between the  

–SiOH and the -SO3H groups hinders the formation of simultaneous contacts with these two 

groups. 

 

3.2.4 Conclusions 

PhC12PMOs functionalized with different types of amines were successfully prepared and 

characterized. The pristine and amine-functionalized PhC12PMO materials exhibit both 

meso- and molecular-scale orders observed by PXRD. These materials were tested for 

adsorption of pure CO2 and CH4 at 25 and 35 °C. All prepared materials presented much 

higher CO2 adsorption than that of CH4. The introduction of amines into the PhC12PMO 

material generally gave rise to an increase in the quantity of adsorbed CO2 over the studied 

pressure range. More importantly, it significantly increased the Henry’s constants of CO2, 

growing in the order PhC12PMO &amp;lt;NH2PhC12PMO &amp;lt;APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO &amp;lt;

APTMS@PhC12PMO, i.e., the APTMS@PhC12PMO material has more affinity for CO2 

than any other PMO material. Thus, it was observed that the type of amine presents a 

dominant effect on the CO2 sorption affinity, more so than the nitrogen content in the PMO 

channels, demonstrating that alkyl amines interact more favorably with CO2 than aromatic 

amines. Furthermore, the observed reduction in surface area and pore volume upon 

functionalization is more than compensated by the increased affinity under the conditions 

studied here. After the adsorption study, the chemical integrity of the amine modified PMOs 

was evaluated by 13C CP-MAS and 15N CP-MAS NMR, indicating that PMO materials 

release the CO2 after activation and can be reused.

Periodic DFT calculations were successfully used for the first time to evaluate the behavior 

of different kinds of amine-functionalized PhPMO on the CO2 and CH4 adsorption and 

correlated with the Henry’s constants. The same trend was found in both DFT calculations 

and gas adsorption measurements, showing that this type of theoretical studies can be used 

to predict if a chemical modification of the PMO promotes an increase in the selectivity of 

CO2 relative to CH4. Furthermore, DFT calculation were also used to studied the preferential 

adsorption sites and adsorption energies of CO2 and CH4 molecules on PMOs functionalized 

in the phenylene moieties with different groups (–NO2, –NH-i-Pr,–CH2NH2, and –SO3H), in 

order to guide the synthesis of new promising materials. It was found that the PhPMO 

functionalized with CH2NH2 is most likely to enhance CO2 adsorption without changing 

significantly the adsorption of CH4, and is thus a promising candidate for future experimental 

studies.

In this Chapter, it will be described the tuning of the chemical, textural and physical 

properties of PMOs through the use of atomic layer deposition (ALD) and pyrolysis 

methodologies for creating novel adsorbent materials. The ALD technology was used to add 

active aluminium species to the walls of different phenylene-silica materials. Phenylene- and 

biphenylene-PMOs were thermally treated in nitrogen atmosphere to create graphitized 

materials with different porosities. These two kinds of methodologies were used to generate 

different surface interfaces into the PMOs, allowing the study of their effect on the CO2 and 

CH4 pure adsorption.

My direct contribution: 

I declare that I have prepared the BTEB precursor and the starting PMO material. The ALD 

depositions were performed by Ricardo Silva under supervision of Nicola Pinna and  

Rui F. Silva. Stephane Pronier collected the TEM images. I have characterized all the 

materials prior and after the deposition of the aluminium oxide. Using a volumetric 

apparatus, I also carried out at the University of Lisbon the CO2 and CH4 pure adsorption 

experiments under the guidance of Moisés L. Pinto and João Pires.

4.1.1 Motivation 

As it was seen in Chapter 3, PMOs with phenylene-bridge (PhC18PMO) can be easily 

modified[1–3] to turn its surface prompt to adsorb selectively CO2. To date, enhancement of 

the selectivity of porous materials towards CO2 has mainly been attempted by organic 

modifications.[4–11] Zeolites and MOFs with aluminium (Al) open centres incorporated into 

their matrix structure have been shown to improve the adsorption of CO2.[12–18] Herein, it is 

described for the first time the use of atomic layer deposition (ALD) to modify the 

PhC18PMO surface with Al2O3 in order to design a novel CO2 adsorbent. ALD comprises a 

sequence of self-limiting chemical reactions between gas-phase precursor molecules and the 

solid surface. The self-limiting nature of ALD gives rise to a conformal growth and an 

additional control over the total stack thickness. The film thickness in a planar substrate can 

be determined precisely by the number of coating cycles.[19] In this work, by varying the 

number of ALD deposition cycles, the quantity of aluminium oxide deposited as well as the 

type of aluminium species on the PhC18PMO were studied. 

 

4.1.2 Experimental details 

PMO synthesis 

The mesoporous phenylene bridged PMO was synthesized according to the literature 

procedures with slight modifications.[20–22] The synthesis of PhC18PMO started with the 

hydrolysis and condensation of home-made 1,4-bis(triethoxysilyl)benzene (BTEB, c.f.  

Sub-chapter 2.1, 4.78 g) precursor[23] in the presence of octadecyltrimethylammonium 

bromide surfactant template (C18-TMA, 4.8 g) in 124 mL of distilled water with 8 mL of  

6 M NaOH solution. This solution was kept for 20 minutes in an ultrasonic vessel and stirred 

for 24 hours at room temperature. After 24 hours of ageing, the solution was transferred to 

Teflon-lined stain-steel autoclave for hydrothermal treatment. The hydrothermal treatment 

begins with a pre-heating of the autoclave in an oven at 200 °C during 40 minutes, and then 

it was transferred to another oven at 100 °C. After 24 hours, the solid was filter and washed. 

The template was extracted by an ethanol/HCl solution to obtain a free-pore PhC18PMO.

Al2O3-PMO preparation 

ALD was performed with a cross flow home-made reactor working in continuous mode, 

using water and trimethylaluminium (Sigma Aldrich, 97%) as precursors. The precursors 

were alternately introduced through ALD pneumatic valves from their reservoirs, which 

were kept at room temperature. Alumina (Al2O3) was deposited onto the PhC18PMO at 

200 °C, under 100 sccm of N2 flow, using reactant pulse times of 0.05 s and 0.10 s for water 

and trimethylaluminium, respectively, and 30 s between pulse times. The typical operating 

pressures varied from 1.6 to 2.0 Pa during the precursor pulses. The quantity of Al2O3 

deposited by ALD onto the PhC18PMO was determined by direct measurements performed 

before and after the ALD coating using an analytical balance with a precision of 0.1 mg. The 

resultant composite materials are denoted from now on as Al-PhC18PMO#x, where x 

corresponds to the number of deposition cycles. 

An additional sample, PhC18PMO+Al2O3_a was prepared by physical mixture of PhC18PMO 

and amorphous Al2O3. The amorphous alumina was synthetized according to the literature[24] 

with some experimental modifications. The aluminium isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)3, Aldrich,  

1 g) was solubilized in ethanol (EtOH, PA, Carlo Erba, 9.75 mL). Then, 0.46 g of nitric acid 

(HNO3, 65 %, Panreac) was added to the solution, and the solution was vigorous stirred 

overnight at room temperature (RT). Then, the solution was transferred to an oven for 2 days 

at 60 °C to induce the controlled evaporation of the solvent and to obtain the dry material. 

The obtained material was calcined at 400 °C during 4 h with a heating ramp of 5 °C?min-1. 

 
Materials characterization 

The physical, textural and chemical properties of the pristine PhC18PMO and Al-PhC18PMO 

composites were evaluated by SEM, scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), 

PXRD, N2 sorption isotherms, TEM, FTIR, 29Si MAS and CP-MAS NMR, 13C CP-MAS 

and 27Al MAS NMR spectroscopies. The thermal stability of materials was evaluated by 

TGA. Description of the experimental conditions is presented at Chapter 2 and some of the 

characterization data is presented in Appendix B. 

 
High pressure adsorption of CO2 and CH4 

Adsorption experiments of CO2 and CH4 on selected samples were conducted up to 1000 

kPa at 25 °C, using the volumetric method using the procedure described in Sub-chapter 2.6. 

The non-ideality of the gas phase was taken into account by using the second and third virial 



Chapter 4 

125 

 

coefficients, and the experimental excess adsorbed amounts were converted to the absolute 

adsorbed amounts by taking into account the porous volume of the material and the density 

of the gas phase using the virial coefficients. Selectivity values were estimated using a 

method proposed by Myers[25] and the implementation is described in detail in previous 

works[26]. 

 

4.1.3 Results and discussion 

The influence of ALD deposition cycles on the morphological changes of PhC18PMO was 

investigated with a particular focus on the decrease of the surface area and pore volume. A 

series of Al2O3 depositions onto the PhC18PMO were performed using different number of 

cycles (2, 10, 20, 50 and 100 cycles). Weight gain measurements were performed on 25 mg 

PhC18PMO samples after the ALD coating to establish a relation with the number of cycles 

and the quantity of Al2O3 (here denoted as Al) deposited as shown in Table 4.1.1. This Table 

shows that the weight gain increases with the number of coating cycles.

anot measured. 

 
The Si/Al ratios determined by EDS (Table 4.1.1) reveal that the Al contents in the 

PhC18PMO increase with the number of applied ALD cycles. The difference between these 

values proves that the ALD precursors modified the pristine PhC18PMO material. It is 

interesting to note that Si/Al ratio does not decrease linearly with the weight gain. 

The top surface morphology of the PhC18PMO coated with Al2O3 after 50 ALD cycles, i.e., 

Al-PhC18PMO#50 sample, was analysed from SEM and STEM bright field images  

(Figure 4.1.1a and b) and corresponding EDS elemental mapping, which show the 

homogeneous distribution at µm-scale of both aluminium and silicon on the composite 

(Figure 4.1.1c and d).

Al-PhC18PMO#50 and Al-PhC18PMO#100, c.f. Figure 4.1.2, show the two-dimensional 

hexagonal symmetry (p6mm) lattice for all materials due to the presence of the first strong 

low-angle (100) reflection with d100 = 4.82 nm and the two much less intense (110) and (200) 

peaks. It is possible to observe in Figure 4.1.2 the decrease of intensity of the peaks with the 

increase of the number of Al2O3 deposition cycles. In addition, Figure 4.1.2 and numerical 

values in Table 4.1.2 display a slight shift to higher angles in the d100 diffraction peak as the 

number of deposition cycles increase. The peak at d = 0.762 nm corresponds to the 

molecular-scale crystal-like structure. The reduction in the intensity of this peak is also 

observed upon modification by Al2O3. A slight shift to higher angles is again observed. 

Peaks associated to both meso- and molecular- scale periodicities are preserved after 

modification suggesting that the PhC18PMO structure is not affected by the ALD conditions.

For CO2 adsorption application, it is of crucial importance that the pores are still accessible 

after ALD modification. The low temperature (-196 °C) nitrogen adsorption–desorption 

isotherms and pore size distribution (PSD) curves (Table 4.1.2 and Figure B1.2, Appendix 

B) confirm the type IV isotherms (IUPAC classification) for PhC18PMO and ALD modified 

PhC18PMO with narrow distribution of pore sizes, typically observed for conventional 

mesoporous materials such as MCM-41, with a hexagonal structure. After 100 cycles of 

Al2O3 deposition, a significant decrease in the N2 adsorbed amounts is observed. This may 

indicate that some of the pores are clogged.

Table 4.1.2 reveals a sharp decrease of the surface area and pore volumes with the growth 

of the amount of ALD Al (approximately linear). The slight decrease in the pore diameter 

may indicate that just a little amount of Al2O3 is deposited inside the pores. From our results,

the Al2O3 is mostly deposited on the top surface area of the particles leading to partial 

clogging of the pores. This effect was most pronounced for the sample Al-PhC18PMO#100. 

The TEM cross-section image and corresponding EDS analyses of the pristine PhC18PMO 

and the composites Al-PhC18PMO#2, Al-PhC18PMO#50 and Al-PhC18PMO#100 are shown 

in Figures 4.1.3 and B1.3. The collected images show the hexagonal arrangement of the 

pores for all materials suggesting that the Al modification using ALD technology is not 

contributing to disrupt of the pore structure of the parent PhC18PMO (c.f. Figure 4.1.3), 

which is in agreement with the PXRD diffractograms (c.f. Figure 4.1.2). Additionally, it is 

also possible to observe the mass contrast in the images of the Al-PhC18PMO composites. 

The darker zones correspond to the Al content inserted into the pores or present at the surface 

of the materials, Figures 4.1.3 (Al-PhC18PMO#100) and B1.3 (Appendix B). TEM EDS 

analyses seem to indicate a low degree of aluminium impregnation inside the pores of the 

PhC18PMO. The aluminium oxide is mostly deposited at the external surface of the particle 

for all composite materials, Figure B1.3 (Appendix B). This behaviour is more evident for 

the composite materials obtained with larger number of deposition cycles, e.g.  

Al-PhC18PMO#50 and Al-PhC18PMO#100. The insets illustrate the FFT of hexagonal 

arrangement of the pores of the composites.

Different techniques were employed for evaluating if any change in the chemistry of the 

material occurs upon the modification of the PhC18PMO material with different amounts of 

Al2O3. The spectra (Figure B1.4a) obtained with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy 

(FTIR) show that the PhC18PMO parent material displays adsorption bands assignable to the 

phenylene ring vibrations (1300–2000 cm-1) and strong adsorption bands (900-650 cm-1),  

C–H species (2980-3060 cm-1, Figure B1.4b), and stretching modes of silanol (3632 cm-1,  

Figure B1.4b). The increase of the amount of Al2O3 deposited in the pristine PhC18PMO is 

observed in the FTIR spectra by the reduction of the intensity of the bands between 350 and 

1200 cm-1. The 29Si and 13C CP-MAS NMR spectra of Al-PhC18PMO#50 (Figure B1.5 and 

Figure B1.6) were also collected for comparison with the already described pristine PMO.[20] 
29Si CP-MAS NMR spectrum of Al-PhC18PMO#50 exhibits the typical peaks at ca. -81, -72 

and -61 ppm attributed to T3, T2 and T1 [Tm = RSi(OSi)m(OH)3-m] organosiliceous species, 

respectively, without any alteration comparing with the parent material.[2,20] The material 

obtained from deposition of Al2O3 by ALD at 200 °C does not present resonances in the 

region of the Qn species [Qn = Si(OSi)n(OH)4-n] proving that the C-Si bonds are intact.  

Table B1.1 shows the percentages of Tm species in PhC18PMO and Al-PhC18PMO#50. These 

percentages are calculated from the deconvolution of the 29Si MAS NMR spectra, using the 

common assumption of Gaussian distributions of isotropic chemical shifts for each type of  

Tm species. Usually, the overlapping of Tm resonances is noticed, leading to small variations 

between best-fit intensity parameters and, consequently, to uncertainties associated with the 

relative populations of the Tm sites. The degree of condensation is 59% for the PhC18PMO 

and 64% for the Al-PhC18PMO#50 composite. The increase of approximately 5% in the T3 

silicon species and the reduction of T2 site in the Al-PhC18PMO#50 composite are probably 

due to some condensation of alumina to the free hydroxyl group of the T2 silicon 

environment of the PhC18PMO. Furthermore, 13C CP-MAS NMR spectrum supports the 

preservation of the material chemistry displaying only one peak at ca. 133 ppm that is 

assigned to the carbons of the phenylene bridge. 27Al MAS NMR spectrum (Figure 4.1.4) 

shows the presence of three peaks at 5, 38 and 62 ppm assigned to the AlVI octahedral, AlV 

bipyramidal and AlIV tetrahedral coordinated aluminium, respectively. Note that the Al2O3 

deposited by ALD is amorphous. However, the tetrahedral and the bipyramidal Al-sites can 

promote acidity in the material. This property can allow the use of Al-PhC18PMO composites

in CO2/CH4 separation once promotes the interaction between composite and the CO2 

quadrupole and consequently improves the selectivity.

(orange line). 
 

Figure 4.1.4 also shows the 27Al MAS NMR spectrum of the Al-PhC18PMO#2 composite. 

This material presents two main distinct peaks, which are assigned to the AlVI octahedral 

and AlIV tetrahedral coordinated aluminium species. A third peak attributed to 

pentacoordinated aluminium species (AlV) grows in importance with the increase of the 

number of cycles, which is a sign of the formation of defects. 

The TGA curve of Al-PhC18PMO#50 (Figure B1.7) exhibits a first weight loss below  

100 °C due to desorption of physisorbed water. It is possible to observe a 3 % weight loss 

from 100 to 250 °C due to the presence of a small quantity of non-extracted template. At 400 

and 630 °C, it is possible to observe two weight losses of 23 % due to the decomposition and 

release of the organic moieties from the bridges of the PhC18PMO material. Note that the 

pristine PhC18PMO material presents a thermal stability up to 550 °C and above that 

temperature only one weight loss is observed.[2,20] Thus, the introduction of the Al content 

decreases the thermal stability of the material. This means that the degradation of the organic 

content is aided by the deposited Al2O3 in two steps due to the presence of different types of 

Al coordination. The first step of degradation of the phenylene bridges occurs probably due 

to the contact of infiltrated pentacoordinated alumina (AlV) with the organic moieties of the 

PhC18PMO. The other weight loss at 630 °C corresponds to the degradation and release of 

the remaining phenylene moieties. These organic moieties probably are in contact with the

octahedral alumina (AlVI). Note that this temperature of degradation is superior to the 

temperature needed to promote the degradation of phenylene bridges of the pristine 

PhC18PMO (550 °C). This picture is supported by the larger stability of the AlVI species 

which presumably protect the organic bridges in their vicinity with a concomitant increase 

in their thermal stability. 

High pressure adsorption of methane and carbon dioxide was performed on samples  

Al-PhC18PMO#50, Al-PhC18PMO#2 and parent PhC18PMO. These PMOs modified with 

ALD were chosen because they presented different properties as above discussed, but they 

still maintained a significant surface area and pore volume (Table 4.1.2). The adsorbed 

amounts on the samples modified with ALD (Al-PhC18PMO#50, Al-PhC18PMO#2) 

decreased for both carbon dioxide and methane (Figure 4.1.5). It can be noted that the 

decreasing is more pronounced on the sample treated with more ALD cycles  

 (Al-PhC18PMO#50). This is expected taking into account the significant decrease in pore 

volume comparing with that determined for the parent PhC18PMO (about 60 %, Table 4.1.2). 

However, the decrease in the adsorbed amounts is different for carbon dioxide and methane. 

Comparing the isotherms for PhC18PMO and Al-PhC18PMO#50, it becomes clear that the 

decrease is less pronounced with carbon dioxide, probably because of the specific interaction 

of this molecule with the surface of the materials. In fact, the isotherm data was fitted with 

a virial equation (lines in Figure 4.1.5; parameters in Table 4.1.3) and observed that the 

Henry constant (KH), which is sensitive to the interaction of the molecules with the surface 

of the materials, increases with the number of ALD cycles for the carbon dioxide case and 

conversely decreases for the methane case. This indicates that the surface of the PhC18PMO 

is increasing the affinity for carbon dioxide with the number of ALD cycles, while the 

contrary is observed for methane. Another way to ascertain this increase is to represent the 

adsorbed amounts per surface area of the materials (SBET) instead of mass, in order to take 

into account the decrease of the surface observed due to ALD treatment and to normalize the 

results by surface affinity. These results (Figure B1.8) clearly show a significant increase of 

about two times from PhC18PMO to Al-PhC18PMO#50 in the adsorbed amount of carbon 

dioxide per surface area when more Al2O3 is introduced in the pores of PhC18PMO. This 

change has a dramatic impact on the separation properties of the materials as it will be 

discussed below.

Using the virial equation fitted to the adsorption data and the Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory 

(IAST),[27] the selectivity of the separation and the equilibrium phase diagrams for the 

adsorbed phase can be obtained using a method proposed by Myers[25] with the 

implementation described in detail in previous works[26,28] As can be seen from Figure 4.1.6, 

the inclusion of Al2O3 on the PhC18PMO induces a very significant increase in the selectivity 

of the CO2/CH4 separation, i.e., the Al-PhC18PMO#50 case is much more pronounced than 

the Al-PhC18PMO#2. This is most probably related with the aluminium pentacoordinated 

species (AlV) that are present in large amount in the Al-PhC18PMO#50 and almost absent in  

Al-PhC18PMO#2. This type of aluminium oxide species is very acidic[29,30] and can interact 

strongly with the carbon dioxide quadrupolar moment (3.3×10-16 cm2).[31] It is worth

PhC18PMO, 0.13 on Al-PhC18PMO#2 and 0.02 at Al-PhC18PMO#50, at 500 kPa and 25 °C. 

This means that the adsorbed phase is richer in carbon dioxide than in methane and that  

Al-PhC18PMO#50 adsorbs almost pure carbon dioxide (0.98 molar composition) under these 

conditions. Complete phase diagrams can also be obtained (Figure B1.9), which confirm the 

best performance of the Al-PhC18PMO#50 sample. Thus, the small decrease in adsorption 

capacity due to the ALD treatment is largely compensated by the increase in the selectivity. 

The application of adsorbent materials on the separation of gases is only industrially viable 

if the material can be easily regenerated with minimum loss of capacity after each 

regeneration cycle. Here, it was tested the regeneration possibility on the Al-PhC18PMO#2 

and Al-PhC18PMO#50 composites using just vacuum during a half hour at ambient 

temperature. This corresponds to what happens industrially during the regeneration step of 

a vacuum swing adsorption process (VSA).[32] From the presented results (Figure 4.1.8), 

only a slight decrease in the high pressure region can be noted in both composites, although 

more significant in Al-PhC18PMO#50. This is a first good indication that these materials can 

be easily regenerated and that they are stable to be used under cyclic separation processes. 

Additional confirmation using a higher number of cycles would be needed to confirm the 

stability required for application in industry.

PhC18PMO with amorphous alumina powder regarding the CO2 and CH4 adsorption. For a 

more realistic comparison, the amorphous alumina used presents a similar chemical 

composition to that of Al-PhC18PMO#50 (see Figure B1.10). In addition, the physical 

mixture of PhC18PMO and amorphous alumina is made in the same ratio obtained for the 

Al-PhC18PMO#50 composite. This is possible having into account the weight gain presented 

in Table 4.1.1. The mixture of PhC18PMO with amorphous alumina is here denoted as 

PhC18PMO+Al2O3_a and was tested for the CH4 and CO2 adsorption at 25 °C. It is possible 

to observe that PhC18PMO+Al2O3_a adsorbs a smaller amount of CO2 and a larger quantity 

of CH4 when compared with Al-PhC18PMO#50 (Figure B1.11a). The presence of nearly  

25 % of amorphous alumina induces a negative effect in the CO2 adsorption in the 

PhC18PMO. In addition the selectivity for PhC18PMO+Al2O3_a, presented in Figure B1.11b, 

is about 1.86 at 500 kPa, while the PhC18PMO presents a selectivity of approximately 4 and 

the Al-PhC18PMO#50 presents a selectivity of 13 at the same range of pressure. Furthermore 

the PhC18PMO+Al2O3_a showed the worst separation performance among all materials 

(Figure B1.12a) and the equimolar composition in the adsorbed phase is achieved at about 

0.70 molar composition of methane in the gas phase, at 500 kPa and 25 °C (Figure B1.12b), 

which is significantly lower than those observed for the other materials tested. Having into 

account the performance of PhC18PMO+Al2O3_a material on the CO2 adsorption, the 

presence of the same alumina/PhC18PMO ratio and same chemical composition achieved for 

the Al-PhC18PMO#50, it is possible to conclude that the use of ALD to deposit alumina in 

the PhC18PMO powder brings benefits for the CO2/CH4 separation. This can be due to a 

good dispersion of nanoparticles of amorphous alumina that is achieved with the ALD 

method not only in the surface, but also inside the pores of Al-PhC18PMO#50, probably 

promoting some roughness and microporosity. The interactions of the alumina and the gas 

molecules are then increased, since the alumina particles are very small. Another 

consequence of this type of deposition is the eventual chemical reaction of some alumina 

with some of the T2 free silanols of PhC18PMO giving rise to some Si-O-Al chemical bonds. 

In this way, the ALD allows the deposition of amorphous alumina on the PhC18PMO, in 

order to produce composites with interesting physical and chemical characteristics to be 

selective in the CO2/CH4 separation.

4.1.4 Comparison to other materials 

The capacity of Al-PhC18PMO#50 to capture carbon dioxide and methane is compared in 

Table 4.1.4 with the capacities reported for other types of adsorbents. Notice that data were 

determined at different temperatures, thus, some differences on the values of the capacities 

can be due to the temperature. 

 
Table 4.1.4. Capacities of different adsorbents in the CO2/CH4 separation at 100 kPa. 

aSelectivity at 100 kPa. bThis value correspond to the CO2/CH4 capacity ratio.  
 

The Al-PhC18PMO#50 presents slightly better results in the CO2 and CH4 adsorption 

capacities than PILC-AlB and PILCw. The Al-PhC18PMO#50 presents at 100 kPa a 

selectivity of 9 which is lightly smaller than the selectivity reported for the PILCs at the 

same range of pressure. Although, the selectivity of the Al-PhC18PMO#50 increases with 

the pressure and at near of 1000 kPa these materials has a selectivity of 15 while the 

selectivity of these PILCs remains constant in the all range of pressure (100-1000 kPa). The 

Al-PhC18PMO#50 adsorbs less CO2 than PCH clay, SC700P activated carbon,  

amino-MIL-53(Al) and MIL-53(Al) pellets (Basolite® A100) MOFs and a-MCMBs Silicas, 

but it is much superior in selectivity. The ZIF-7 is the only material that presents better CO2 

adsorption and selectivity at the same temperature and pressure. Although, information of 

the behaviour of these materials at higher pressures than 100 kPa is missing.

4.1.5 Conclusions 

The phenylene-C18PMO surface was successfully modified for the first time by ALD 

deposition of amorphous Al2O3 with different content. The meso-structure order and 

molecular-scale periodicity of the pore walls of PhC18PMO are preserved after modification 

of high Al content (Al-PhC18PMO#100 with [Si/Al] = 0.94). The ALD method allows 

increasing the amount of the Al2O3 on the composite varying the number of cycles, proving 

to be a robust method for tailoring the content of Al2O3 amount on the PhC18PMO. The 

reduction of the surface area and pore volume is observed with the increase of Al content. 

In the case of a large number of ALD cycles (i.e., 50), the formation of AlV aluminium oxide 

species is observed. The acidity of these species is most probably responsible for the 

observed increase in the CO2/CH4 separation selectivity. The Al-PhC18PMO#50 sample has 

interesting properties for application into methane purification (upgrading and sweetening) 

that is essential before bio and natural gas commercialization. The regeneration of the 

modified materials was easy under vacuum and showed good stability.

My direct contribution: 

I declare that I have prepared, functionalized, pyrolysed and characterized the resulting PMO 

materials. I also carried out the experimental CO2 and CH4 pure adsorption measurements at 

the University of Lisbon using a volumetric apparatus, under guidance of Moisés L. Pinto 

and João Pires.

4.2.1 Motivation 

Periodic mesoporous organosilica (PMO) materials have been proposed as potential 

adsorbents due to their high specific surface areas, high pore volumes and good thermal 

stability.[22,39,40] These materials also allow good diffusion of the molecules through the 

channels, since the organic functions are integrated within the walls. Moreover, PMO 

characteristics can be tuned by changing the bissilylated organic bridge and the template 

molecule, which define the type of porous structure and the pore size[20] as it was seen in  

Sub-chapter 3.1. The introduction of amino groups into the organic bridge has been one of 

the ways to improve selectivity of PMOs towards CO2 adsorption[1] as we could observe in 

Sub-chapters 3.1 and 3.2. Additionally, alkyl amine groups have been grafted to the free 

silanols at the PMO hydrophilic part[41] as demonstrated in Sub-chapter 3.2. The addition of 

aluminium oxide to the PMO surface using atomic layer deposition makes the phenylene-

PMO (PhC18PMO) was effective for the CO2/CH4 separation as could be observed in the 

previous Sub-chapter 4.1. Despite all the attempts to improve efficiency of PMOs for CO2 

adsorption, thus improving its separation from CH4, significant additional work is required 

in order to make them competitive with zeolites and activated carbons in terms of capacity 

and cost efficiency. Therefore, in the present work the surface and structural properties of 

PMOs are modified through pyrolysis with the aim of improving their capabilities for gas 

adsorption and gas separation applications. PMOs with two different aromatic bridges, 

phenylene and biphenylene moieties were prepared. The carbonized PMOs were prepared 

using two different structure-directing agents (C12-TMA and C18-TMA) in order to obtain 

different pore sizes. As the alkyl chain length of the surfactant and the nature of the bridge 

of PMOs were varied, it was studied their influence on the morphology, on the surface 

properties (surface area, pore volume, pore size distribution and particle type) and on the 

thermal stability of the prepared PMOs. The pyrolysis process was made on the as-

synthetized PMOs (with surfactant within the channels) and on the surfactant-extracted 

PMOs, at two different temperatures (800 °C and 1200 °C) under inert conditions. 

Additionally, PMOs were chemically modified before pyrolysis, aiming to improve the 

capacity and selectivity for CO2/CH4 separation. 

This study is focused on the understanding of the physical and chemical modifications 

promoted in the aromatic bridged PMO materials as a consequence of the carbonization 

process and the concomitant effects in the CO2 capacity and CO2/CH4 selectivity. To the 



Chapter 4 

141 

 

best of our knowledge, only the pyrolysis of non-aromatic PMOs was reported in the  

literature[42–48] and none of such pyrolysed materials was tested for the CO2/CH4 separation. 

 

4.2.2 Experimental details 

PMO synthesis 

The phenylene[20,22] (c.f. Sub-chapter 3.1) and biphenylene[49] bridged PMOs were 

synthesized according to the literature procedures, starting by with the hydrolysis and 

condensation of bissilylated precursors in the presence of supramolecular structure agent, 

the C18-TMA or C12-TMA. After 24 hours of stirring at room temperature, the solution was 

transferred to Teflon-lined stain-steel autoclave for hydrothermal treatment at 100 °C. After 

24 hours, the solid was filtered and washed. The as-prepared materials are denoted as 

PhCnPMO_AS or BphCnPMO_AS, where n is the number of carbons of the alkyl chain of 

the selected surfactant. The templates were removed using an ethanol/HCl solution, giving 

rise to PhCnPMO and BphCnPMO materials. The introduction of the amino group into the 

phenylene moieties (to obtain NH2PhC12PMO) was made upon two-step treatment with very 

strong acid solutions of HNO3 and H2SO4 and also of SnCl2 and HCl using the procedure 

reported by Ohashi et al.[1] 

 
Carbonization of PMOs 

The prepared PMOs materials were carbonized in an alumina crucible at 800 °C or 1200 °C 

under nitrogen atmosphere. The pyrolysis was performed in two steps. Initially the 

temperature was raised up to 200 °C using a heating rate of 5 °C·min-1. The materials were 

kept at this temperature over 2 hours. Then, the temperature was increased at 5 °C·min-1 till 

it reaches the final temperature (800 or 1200 °C), at which the material was maintained for 

2 h. Natural cooling to the room temperature was made under nitrogen flow. The pyrolysed 

PMOs are denoted by the suffix PT, where P means pyrolysed material and T indicates the 

temperature of the carbonization process (T = 800 or 1200 °C). 

In the case of the PMO submitted to acid chemical treatment, the materials were previously 

heated with the H2SO4 at 160 °C during 6 h and then carbonized at 800 °C. 

 
Materials characterization 

The properties of the carbonized PMOs were assessed by PXRD, -196 °C N2 sorption, TEM, 

FTIR, 29Si MAS and CP-MAS NMR and 13C CP-MAS NMR spectroscopies and TGA 



Chapter 4 

142 

 

analysis. TEM, N2-sorption isotherms, 13C CP-MAS NMR, TGA, EA and some CO2 and 

CH4 adsorption data can be assessed in the Appendix B. 

 
High pressure CO2 and CH4 adsorption 

Adsorption experiments of CO2 and CH4 were performed at 25 °C up to 1000 kPa, using the 

volumetric method presented in the previous Chapter (Sub-chapter 2.6). The non-ideality of 

the gas phase was taken into account through the use of the second and third virial 

coefficients. Additionally, the experimental excess adsorbed amounts were converted to the 

absolute adsorbed amounts having into account the pore volume of the each sample and the 

density of the gas phase using the virial coefficients. Each experimental pure component 

adsorption isotherm was fitted using the Virial model. Selectivity values were estimated 

using a method proposed by Myers34 and the implementation is described in detail in 

previous works35. 

 

4.2.3 Results and discussion 
0 

The surfactant-extracted PMOs, PhC18PMO (c.f. Sub-chapter 3.1), PhC12PMO  

(c.f. Chapter 3) and BphC18PMO[50] possess 2D hexagonal symmetry (p6mm) lattice with d 

spacings associated to the (100) reflection (c.f. Figure 4.2.1) of 4.65, 3.59 and 4.96 nm, 

respectively (Table B2.1 in the Appendix B). These materials also present molecular-scale 

periodicity observed by the presence of a medium range reflection at d ? 0.76 nm for the  

PhCnPMOs (c.f. Sub-chapter 3.1) and at 1.19 nm for the BphC18PMO[50]. The as-prepared 

and surfactant-extracted PMO materials were pyrolysed at 800 °C. The two most promising 

materials were further pyrolysed at 1200 °C. The structural order of the carbonized samples 

were studied by PXRD, TEM and N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms. Figure 4.2.1 also 

shows the PXRD patterns of the pyrolysed samples. It is possible to observe that all materials 

preserved the (100) reflection, indicating that the meso-scale periodicity is preserved after 

the pyrolysis conditions. The materials PhC18PMO_P800, PhC12PMO_P800 and 

BphC18PMO_P800 have d spacings of 4.09, 3.27 and 4.20 nm, respectively (Table B2.1). 

The slightly reduction of the d spacing values on the pyrolysed samples is compatible with 

the reduction of the pore diameter during the pyrolysis process at 800 °C. The use of the 

surfactant, the increase of temperature to 1200 °C or even the use of H2SO4 chemical 

treatment before carbonization leads to a reduction of intensity of the (100) reflection in the 



Chapter 4 

143 

 

PRXD. This reduction is more pronounced for the materials pyrolysed at 1200 °C and may 

indicate a partial collapse of the porous structure. The medium-range reflections at d ~ 0.76 

and 1.19 nm can be observed in the PXRD pattern of phenylene- and biphenylene- PMOs, 

respectively, after pyrolysis at 800 °C. The phenylene-PMO treated at higher temperature 

(PhC12PMO_P1200) does not present this reflection, pointing to the loss of the molecular-

scale periodicity after such hard conditions. However, in the case of the biphenylene-PMO 

the molecular-scale periodicity peak is always present in the diffraction patterns even after 

treatment at 1200 °C.  

 

Figure 4.2.1. X-ray diffraction patterns of pyrolysed PMO materials: a) phenylene-PMOs; and  
b) biphenylene-PMOs. 
 

TEM images of pyrolysed PMOs are showed in Figure B2.1 in the Appendix B. TEM images 

of PhC18PMO_P800 and the PhC12PMO_P800 show high order of the pores along the 

channel direction. Additionally, both materials show the hexagonal arrangement of the pores 

and present particles with elongated form such as the parent PMOs. Interesting, the use of 

surfactant during the pyrolysis process and the use of amine linked to the phenylene moieties 

of the PhC12PMO gives rise to carbonized materials with lower mesoporous organization 

than the PhC12PMO_P800, corroborating the PXRD results. Moreover, the 

PhC12PMO_AS_P800 and NH2PhC12PMO_P800 present particles with both elongated and 

spherical shapes. The increase of the pyrolysed temperature from 800 to 1200 °C 

(PhC12PMO_P1200) leads to the appearance of smaller particles. TEM images of carbonized 

biphenylene-PMOs at different conditions are also presented in Figure B2.1 and it is possible

to notice that all biphenylene-PMOs present high order along the channels. Furthermore, the 

TEM image in the direction parallel to the channels of the BphC18PMO_P1200 supports the 

maintenance of the 2D hexagonal arrangement of the pores. Curiously, the shape of the 

particles of these materials change with the temperature. The parent biphenylene-PMO 

presents particles with helical form,[50] but during the heating process at 800 °C under inert 

atmosphere, the BphC18PMO_P800 starts showing particles with spherical shape. The 

spherical particles are more evident on biphenylene-PMOs carbonized under extreme 

conditions (pyrolysis at 1200 °C or at 800 °C in the presence of the surfactant). 

The N2 adsorption–desorption experiments of carbonized PMOs are presented in  

Figure B2.2 in the Appendix B, and the pore size distribution (PSD) curves are showed in 

Figure 4.2.2. The free surfactant parent PMOs, PhC18PMO (c.f. Sub-chapter 3.1), PhC12PMO  

(c.f. Chapter3) and BphC18PMO[50] samples display type IV isotherms (IUPAC 

classification),[51] as shown previously, typically detected on conventional mesoporous 

materials. In Figure B2.2, it is possible to observe that the PhC18PMO_P800 presents a type 

IV isotherm similar to what happens with the parent material. A slightly reduction of the 

Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET)[52,53] specific surface area (SBET) and pore volume (Vp) 

can be observed after pyrolysis, but a significant decrease of the pore diameter (dp) from 

3.70 to 3.02 nm is evident (Table B2.1). The presence of microporosity was also studied by 

applying the t-plot method to the N2 adsorption curve of the material. In the case of 

PhC18PMO_P800 signs of microporosity were not observed. Since difficulties in applying 

the t-plot method to type IV isotherms are common,[51] the quenched solid density functional 

theory (QSDFT)[54,55] was then applied to the N2 adsorption isotherm of the pyrolysed PMOs 

to evaluate both micro- and meso-pores size distribution, as represented in Figure 4.2.2. 

Figure 4.2.2a shows that the pyrolysis of PhC18PMO at 800 °C originates a material with 

different types of porosities. Two mesopore sizes are obtained at ca. 3.4 nm (in small 

amount) and at ca. 2.1 nm (in major quantity). The pore diameter around 1.1 nm is assigned 

to the presence of micropores. In the case of PhC12PMO the carbonization at 800 °C leads 

to a material with an isotherm that resembles a type Ib isotherm, typical of microporous 

materials with wide micropores and possibly narrow mesopores (Figure B2.2), which agrees 

with the pore size distribution that displays mainly pores around 1.1 nm (Figure 4.2.2a). 

Interestingly, the PhC12PMO_P800 presents a reduction of SBET, but an increase of Vp when 

compared to the parent PhC12PMO (Table B2.1) that could eventually be ascribed to the 



Chapter 4 

145 

 

decrease in the particle size. The effect of the surfactant presence within the channels of the 

PhC12PMO during the pyrolysis at 800 °C is minimal. Both PhC12PMO_P800 and 

PhC12PMO_AS_P800 display similar PSD curves (Figure 4.2.2a). Nevertheless, 

PhC12PMO_AS_P800 presents higher SBET and Vp and lower Vmicro than the 

PhC12PMO_P800 material (Table B2.1). 

 

Figure 4.2.2. Pore size distribution profiles calculated from the N2 adsorption isotherm of 
carbonized: a) phenylene-PMOs and b) biphenylene-PMOs. The PSD curves were calculated using 
the QSDFT method for carbon surfaces. 
 

The presence of amines in the phenylene moieties of PhC12PMO also produces a material 

with an isotherm similar to a type Ib isotherm[51] after pyrolysis, but with a more pronounced 

reduction of SBET, Vp and Vmicro than the sample without amine groups (please compare 

NH2PhC12PMO_P800 and PhC12PMO_P800 samples in Figure 4.2.2a and Table B2.1). The 

reduction of the specific surface area and of the pore volumes may result from the collapse 

of some pores during the pyrolysis[42] and/or may occur by the presence of amines, which 

increase the reactivity of the material upon carbonization of the phenylene moieties to form 

carbon[56] giving rise to silica/carbon framework. When the carbonization of the organic 

moieties is fast, the free carbon can be deposited on the pores leading to their blockage. Note, 

that the presence of amines during the pyrolysis process originated smaller micropores,

(PhC12PMO_P1200), it is possible to observe an isotherm that has features of type Ib + IVa 

isotherms with a small hysteresis but without the presence of a defined final plateau, usually 

observed in adsorbents with a wide distribution of pore sizes (from micro to wide 

mesopores).[51] The PhC12PMO_P1200 shows mainly micropores (Figure 4.2.2a) when 

compared to PhC12PMO_P800, but also possesses some mesopores evidenced by the broad 

peak centered at 3.3 nm. A reduction of the SBET and Vmicro is also observed when the 

temperature is increased (Table B2.1). 

The textural properties of pyrolysed phenylene-PMOs were also studied and are represented 

in Figure 4.2.2b. Similarly to the results obtained for the pyrolysed phenylene-PMOs, it is 

verified a contraction of the pore structure upon pyrolysis of biphenylene-PMOs  

(Figure 4.2.2b and Table B2.1). The pyrolysis of BphC18PMO at 800 °C gives rise to a 

material with a isotherm resembling a type Ib isotherm although with some type II character 

(Figure B2.2), and presenting higher SBET, but lower Vp and dp than the parent material  

(c.f. Table B2.1). The shrinkage of the pores is observed in Figure 4.2.2b, where the 

BphC18PMO_P800 shows mainly micropores. The observed micropores in this material 

varies between 1 and 2 nm, with maxima of pore size distributions centered at 1.0 nm and 

1.7 nm. The presence of the surfactant (BphC18PMO_P800_AS) only promotes a reduction 

of the SBET and Vp of the sample when compared to the BphC18PMO_P800 materials  

(Table B2.1). This can be related to the carbonization of the surfactant species at 800 °C 

remaining inside the pores, which eventually leads to their obstruction. Interestingly, and 

opposite to the observed for the pyrolysed phenylene-PMO samples, it is possible to perceive 

a slightly increase in the Vmicro. The increase in the microporosity when the surfactant is 

present in the BphC18PMO_P800 material (c.f. compare Vmicro of BphC18PMO_P800_AS 

and BphC18PMO_P800 in the Table B2.1) during the pyrolysis process can be associated to 

the formation of smaller micropores during the surfactant carbonization (c.f. Figure 4.2.2b, 

BphC18PMO_P800 material presents micropores with 1.0 nm while the 

BphC18PMO_P800_AS sample has micropores with 0.9 nm). Curiously, the chemical attack 

of BphC18PMO with H2SO4 before pyrolysis also stimulates a reduction of SBET and Vp and 

an increase of the Vmicro. Thus, the BphC18PMO-H2SO4_P800 has more micropores  

(Table B2.1) and they are faintly smaller than those observed in the BphC18PMO_P800,  

(Figure 4.2.2b). The increase of the temperature from 800 °C to 1200 °C has higher impact 

in the formation of a material with more micropores than the use of surfactant or the 



Chapter 4 

147 

 

consideration of chemical attack by sulfuric acid before pyrolysis. In this way, 

BphC18PMO_P1200 is the carbonized biphenylene-PMO material with the highest Vmicro 

prepared in this study (Table B2.1). The reduction verified on the micropore size  

(Figure 4.2.2b) is in agreement with the progressive contraction of structure upon increasing 

temperature treatment. These results are in line with the deviation of the d100 reflection for 

higher 2? values in the PXRD shown in Figure 4.2.1. 

Solid-state 29Si CP-MAS NMR and 13C CP-MAS NMR spectra of pyrolysed PMOs 

materials are shown in Figures 4.2.3 and Figure B2.3 in the Appendix B, respectively. The  
29Si CP-MAS NMR spectra of the PhCnPMO (Chapter 3 and Appendix A) and 

BphC18PMO[50] display resonances at ca. -81, -70 and -61 ppm which are attributed to T3, 

T2 and T1 organosiliceous species of the type Tm = RSi(OSi)m(OH)3-m, respectively. In both 

parent PMO materials no peaks endorsed to Qn [Qn = Si(OSi)n(OH)4-n] chemical 

environments were detected. After pyrolysis of the materials, the patterns of the 29Si NMR 

spectra became considerably noisy, displaying in general broader peaks. This observation 

may be related with the partial formation of graphitic carbon species known to be 

paramagnetic. Moreover, the pyrolysis treatment promotes Si-C cleavages observed by the 

appearance of Qn chemical environments. Although, different degrees of Si-C cleavage are 

observed when the pyrolysis conditions are varied. The phenylene-PMOs with different pore 

sizes originate similar ratios of Tm: Qn species after pyrolysis at 800 °C. The presence of 

amines and/or surfactant molecules, and the increase of the temperature from 800 to  

1200 °C give rise, in the phenylene-PMO, to an increase of the Qn species, which indicates 

an enhancement of the cleavage of the Si-C bonds within these conditions. The presence of 

surfactant inside the channels of the biphenylene-PMO samples does not intensify the Si-C 

bond cleavage. Contrarily, the use of sulfuric acid to promote dehydration or the increase of 

temperature from 800 to 1200 °C promote the formation of larger amount of Qn species, 

which means that these extreme conditions stimulate the cleavage of the Si-C bonds. 

Solid-state 13C CP-MAS NMR spectra of the pristine PhCnPMO materials present a typical 

resonance at 133 ppm of the aromatic carbons as reported in Chapter 3. In the case of the 

parent BphC18PMO the 13C CP-MAS NMR spectra exhibit resonances at ca. 126, 130, 135 

and 141 ppm assigned to the sp2 carbons, which are related with the biphenylene group.[50] 

Tiny peaks can be detected in the region 0 to 50 ppm. Figure B2.3 in the Appendix B shows 

that the phenylene- and biphenylene-PMOs samples carbonized at 800 °C only display one

broad resonance at ca. 132 ppm (Figure B2.3b, d and f) and at ca. 129 ppm (Figure B2.3h), 

respectively.

The thermal stability of the pyrolysed PMOs was evaluated by TGA and the results are 

presented in Figure B2.4 in the Appendix B. The parent PhCnPMOs (c.f. Chapter 3) and 

BphC18PMO[50] materials are stable up to 550 °C. After pyrolysis, all PMOs are found to be 

thermally stable up to ca. 300 °C as observed by TGA (Figure B2.4). The first weight loss, 

occurring below 100 °C in all materials, is associated to desorption of physisorbed water. 

Then, at 300 °C most of the phenylene- and biphenylene-PMOs present an increase of weight 

that is related to the oxidation of carbon in oxygen atmosphere. This effect is more 

pronounced in phenylene- and biphenylene-PMOs treated at 1200 °C. Above 300°C, the 

decomposition and release of the organic moieties from the framework take place, which 

happens at lower temperatures than in the parent PMOs. This lowering in the temperature 

for the release of organic moieties is compatible with the breakage of Si-C bonds as 

suggested above. 

Table B2.2 in the Appendix B presents the elemental analysis results of the pyrolysed PMO 

materials, demonstrating the significant reduction on C and H content comparatively to the 

parent PhCnPMOs (c.f. Chapter 3) and parent BphC18PMO[50]. This loss probably occurs due 

to some carbonization of the organic bridges and consequently volatilization of the burnt 

products. Furthermore, both NH2PhC12PMO_P800 and BphC18PMO-H2SO4_P800 have the 

major loss of C amount on the phenylene- and biphenylene-PMOs carbonized materials, 

meaning that the chemical attack of the bridges before carbonization facilitated the burnt of 

the chemical species. Comparatively to the parent NH2PhC12PMO (c.f. Chapter 3), the 

amount of N in the case of the NH2PhC12PMO_P800 material is decreased, which suggests 

occurrence of C-N bond cleavage during the carbonization. Additionally, the pyrolysis of 

both as-synthetized PMOs (PhC12PMO_AS_P800 and BphC18PMO_AS_P800) do not lead 

to materials with representative nitrogen content, meaning that the surfactant is somehow 

lost during the process. 

Figure 4.2.4 presents the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of both 

NH2PhC12PMO and NH2PhC12PMO_P800, in order to observe which kind of amines are 

into the PMO material after the pyrolysis. Signals of Si 2p, Si 2s, C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s were 

observed in the XPS spectrum of both samples (c.f. Figure 4.2.4). It can be seen in  

Figure 4.2.4a that the N 1s signal appears at 400.36 eV, which corresponds to the N atom in 

the amino groups (NH2) linked to the phenylene moieties of the NH2PhC12PMO material. 

This material also shows ?* features in the range above of ~ 405 eV, that can be related to 



Chapter 4 

150 

 

its highly conjugated character (?-?*). Note, that this signal at higher binding energies is 

frequently observed in the C 1s, O 1s and S 2p regions of materials with poor electrical 

conductivity (which is the case) and can be associated to the existence of zones of different 

conductivity resulting from X-ray irradiation and differential charge accumulation in the 

surface of the material. In the case of the NH2PhC12PMO_P800 material (c.f. Figure 4.2.4b), 

the N 1s signal appears at 400.58 eV (which is similar to the value obtained for the 

NH2PhC12PMO), indicating that the N atom remains mainly in the form of amino group.

Experimental Pure-Component Adsorption Isotherms 

The pyrolysed phenylene- and biphenylene-PMOs were tested as adsorbents on the CO2 and 

CH4 adsorption at 25 °C and the obtained results are shown in Figure 4.2.5. The evaluation 

of the surface interaction of each materials with pure CO2 and pure CH4 at low coverage was 

made through the determination of the Henry’s constant (KH) using the Virial model. The 

fitting parameters for the Virial model are presented in Table 4.2.1. 

Figure 4.2.5a shows the CO2 and CH4 adsorption isotherms of each pyrolysed  

phenylene-PMO. The PhC12PMO_P800 adsorbs more CO2 than the parent PhC12PMO  

(c.f. Chapter 3) and any other treated PMO with phenylene moieties in the framework  

(Figure 4.2.5a), presenting the highest KH (1.11 x 10-2 mmol·g-1·kPa-1) of this family of 

materials (Table 4.2.1). Interestingly, PhC12PMO_P800 is also the material of the pyrolysed

phenylene-PMOs with the highest Vmicro, suggesting the importance of these physical 

parameters on the adsorption of CO2 (Table B2.1). Thus, any modification on the pyrolysis 

conditions (increase of the pore size, use of template, incorporation of amines in the 

phenylene moieties or increase of temperature) gives rise to materials with less CO2 

adsorption capacity (Figure 4.2.5a and Table B2.2). The PhC18PMO_P800 and 

PhC12PMO_P1200 are the materials demonstrating lower CO2 adsorption in the range of 

pressure considered and present the smallest KH values ((0.36 x 10-2 and 0.34 x 10-2 mmol·g-

1·kPa-1, respectively, Table 4.2.1) for the materials considered in this work. Curiously, the 

PhC18PMO_P800 does not present Vmicro and the PhC12PMO_P1200 is the pyrolysed 

phenylene material with the lowest amount of micropores from the C12 family (Table B2.1). 

Additionally, these materials have a significant amount of mesopores, indicating that this 

type of pores is not beneficial for CO2 adsorption. 

As observed for the adsorption of CO2, the PhC12PMO_P800 is also the material which 

adsorbs more CH4 at high pressures, but presents one of the lowest KH  

(0.21 x 10-2 mmol·g-1·kPa-1) found in this study. The use of the surfactant, the introduction 

of amines in the phenylene bridge, and the increase of pyrolysis temperature promote an 

increase of KH. Thus, PhC12PMO_P1200 is the pyrolysed phenylene-PMO presenting the 

highest KH (0.30 x 10-2 mmol·g-1·kPa-1). Interestingly, a relation between the microporosity 

of the pyrolysed phenylene-PMOs and the CH4 adsorption was found: materials with the 

lowest Vmicro tend to present improved properties to adsorb more CH4 than materials with 

highest Vmicro. 

Figure 4.2.5b shows the CO2 and CH4 adsorption isotherms for carbonized  

biphenylene-PMOs. The BphC18PMO_P800 presents similar CO2 adsorptive properties and 

the same KH relatively to its phenylene counterpart (Table 4.2.1). Remarkably, the 

BphC18PMO_P1200 is the pyrolysed biphenylene-PMO with the best CO2 adsorptive 

properties and the highest KH (2.34 x 10-2 mmol·g-1·kPa-1) of this family of materials and 

also of all PMOs materials prepared in this study.  

The enhancement of the pyrolysis temperature of biphenylene-PMOs improves the CO2 

adsorption. This result is in the opposite direction to what was observed in the case of 

material PhC12PMO_P1200, c.f. Table 4.2.1. 

The increase of temperature from 800 to 1200 °C may intensify the formation of micropores 

on the structure of BphC18PMO_P1200, favouring the CO2 adsorption (Figure 4.2.1 and  



Chapter 4 

152 

 

Table B2.1). In the case of CH4 adsorption, the pyrolysed biphenylene-PMO shows a 

different behaviour. BphC18PMO_P800 is the material which adsorbs more CH4 in all 

pressure range, with a KH of 0.59 x 10-2 mmol·g-1·kPa-1. The pyrolysis of the BphC18PMO 

containing surfactant within the pores results in a material presenting inferior CH4 adsorption 

performance (Figure 4.2.5b and Table 4.2.1).

CH4 adsorption capacity especially at low pressure values. The increase of the pyrolysis

These results are remarkable, once they can be correlated to the pores structure obtained 

using different pyrolysis conditions. Thus, the increase of Vmicro on the pyrolysed 

biphenylene-PMOs reduces the CH4 adsorption performance (Table 4.2.1 and Table B2.1). 

In general, the increase of microporosity on the pyrolysed PMOs improves the CO2 

adsorption properties and diminishes the CH4 adsorption behaviour. This is in agreement 

with results found on carbon-based adsorbents where it was found that narrow micropores 

favours CO2 adsorption while large micropores are more suitable for CH4  

adsorption.[34,57–59] 

The selectivity of the separation and the equilibrium phase diagrams are also determined in 

this study from the analysis of the adsorption data using the Ideal Adsorbed Solution 

Theory[27], by fitting the Virial equation to the pure-component isotherms and also by using 

the method proposed by Myers[25,26,60]. Figure 4.2.6 shows the differences in the selectivities

displayed for the CO2/CH4 separation by pyrolysed PMO adsorbents. The differences 

between the values of selectivity can be quite large. In fact, the BphC18PMO_P1200 

adsorbent has superior selectivity (9.5 at 500 kPa) to all other pyrolysed phenylene- or 

biphenylene-PMOs. 

 

Figure 4.2.6. Average selectivity for the CO2/CH4 separation on the different pyrolysed PMOs at  
25 °C. 
 

PhC12PMO_P800 displays a selectivity of 4.6 at 500 kPa. It is noteworthy that the materials 

with the highest selectivity on the CO2/CH4 separation are the materials with highest 

microporosity of each PMO family. Curiously, the amount of micropores (Vmicro) on the 

material is not directly proportional to the CO2 and CH4 adsorption ability and also to the 

selectivity to separate these gases. This means that behind the microporosity factor there are 

other potential features influencing the CO2 and CH4 adsorption namely the pore diameter 

and the chemical nature of the moieties. 

The ability of the materials to separate CO2 and CH4 can be also estimated by the ratio of 

the KH values, determined for CO2 and CH4 adsorption on each adsorbent experimentally 

considered in this work (c.f. Table 4.2.1). The results obtained present the same trend as 

observed before. The biggest ratio was determined for BphC18PMO_P1200, which seems to 

be the most remarkable adsorbent for CO2/CH4 separation. 

Figure 4.2.7 demonstrates the influence of all variables on the separation, where the 

BphC18PMO_P1200 presents slightly improved behaviour than PhC12PMO_P800. 

Furthermore, these two adsorbents present better results than any other PMO prepared in 

this study.

Having into account a 0.5 molar composition of methane (yCH4), which is a realistic value 

for biogas composition and for some natural gas sources, the composition in the adsorbed 

phase (xCH4) is 0.08 on BphC18PMO_P1200 and 0.15 on PhC12PMO_P800, at 500 kPa and 

25 °C. 

 

Figure 4.2.7. Isothermal (25 °C), isobaric (500 kPa) xy phase diagams of the CO2/CH4 mixtures on 
pyrolysed phenylene and biphenylene PMOs. yCH4 is the molar fraction of methane in the gas phase; 

xCH4 is the molar fraction of methane in the adsorbed phase. 
 

Therefore, the most interesting material to separate CO2 from CH4 is the 

BphC18PMO_P1200, where the adsorbed phase is much richer in CO2 than in CH4, adsorbing 

carbon dioxide with a purity of around 0.92 molar composition at 500 kPa and 25 °C, for a 

0.5 composition in the gas phase. Comprehensive phase diagrams were also calculated 

(Figure B2.4 in the Appendix B), which support these results. 

 

4.2.4 Conclusions 

Phenylene- and biphenylene- PMO families were heated at two different carbonization 

temperatures under inert conditions, resulting in carbonized PMO materials with differences 

in both the chemistry and the textural properties of the materials. The reduction of pore size 

to micro-pores is the most significant difference observed when compared with the 

unpyrolysed materials, but the surface areas and the particles size are also smaller. 

Interesting, the highest carbonization temperature; the presence of the surfactant and amine 

groups; and the use of H2SO4 during the carbonization process lead to the production of 

materials with small pore size and high amount of micropores. The hexagonal arrangement

of the pores remains after the carbonization process even when the materials were pyrolysed 

at 1200 °C (observed by PXRD and TEM techniques). Furthermore, the molecular-scale 

periodicity of the carbonized materials with the exception of biphenylene-PMO was strongly 

affected by the pyrolysis treatment probably as result of Si-C bond cleavage.  

All materials were tested in the pure CO2 and pure CH4 adsorption at 25 °C. The CO2 

adsorption capacity and the selectivity for CO2/CH4 separation were enhanced for all 

pyrolysed materials. The highest selectivity on the CO2/CH4 separation was observed for 

materials with the highest microporosity. The most interesting material for CO2/CH4 

separation is the biphenylene-PMO pyrolysed at 1200 °C, presenting the highest KH for the 

CO2 (2.34 x 10-2 mmol·g-1·kPa-1) observed in this PhD study (Chapters 3 and 4), which is 

remarkable for a material without further amine functionalization.

5.1.1 Motivation 

As it was seen in Sub-chapter 1.4, the PMO materials were initially modified by changing 

the organic-bridge of bissilylated precursors used on their synthesis.[1] The chemical 

modification of the organic moieties integrating this material allows also to tune their 

applicability, which seems to be very promising but so far not many examples were 

reported.[2] Some examples of post-synthesis functionalization in phenylene PMO deal with 

the sulfonation of the aromatic ring,[3] the incorporation of arenetricarbonyl complexes of 

Mo and Cr,[4–6] and the amination of phenylene moieties of the PMO.[7] 

In this work, it is showed that is possible in a simple way to modify homogenously the 

chemistry of periodic mesoporous phenylene-silica by inclusion of interesting functional 

groups. Herein, it is reported the first example of the N-alkylation of the periodic mesoporous 

phenylene silica with an amino group at the aromatic ring. It is also a novelty the use of 

microwave irradiation in the functionalization of PMO materials. There are only few reports 

using the microwave-assisted synthesis in PMOs, most in the preparation of the PMO 

material.[8–10] Smeulders et al.[8] demonstrated that this unconventional fast heating approach 

kept unchanged the structure of this kind of hybrid materials during the hydrothermal step 

synthesis. Additionally, when compared with the conventional synthesis, the usage of 

microwave irradiation promoted narrower distribution of pore sizes, higher surface area and 

larger pore volumes.[8] 

Due to the dielectric heating, chemical reactions under microwave radiation generally occur 

much faster.[11] Molecules possessing a permanent dipole moment tend to become aligned 

with the microwave electromagnetic field and, during this motion, they suffer frictions and 

collisions, with consequent heat generation. The efficiency of microwave heating is strongly 

dependent on the dielectric properties and on the relaxation times of the reaction components 

(namely reactants, functional groups and solvents).[12–14] Additionally, as the majority of the 

microwave ovens work at 2.45 GHz, the molecules exposed to this radiation are able to 

generate a strong internal heat with a heating rate up to 10 °C per second. Using conventional 

heating, the temperature of the surface of the reaction vessel becomes higher than its internal 

temperature and the transfer of the heating is made via thermal conduction. Therefore, the 

microwave radiation is a non-contact heating source allowing a more selective and effective 

heating than the conventional sources. Reaction vessels can be chosen to permit the 

microwave energy to go through it and heat only the reactants. Specific microwave effects 



Chapter 5

can also occur during the reaction due to the presence of polar molecules in the mixture or 

if the polarity of the transition state is higher than the polarity of the ground state.[15,16] 

This work combines the know-how obtained from the organic and inorganic chemistry to 

develop the PMO materials that even after one decade of research remains largely 

underexploited. A microwave-assisted reaction used in organic synthesis for the 

monoalkylation of aniline[17] is adapted to the functionalization of NH2PhC18PMO to achieve 

the N-alkylation of the amine group as depicted in Figure 5.1.1.  

 

Figure 5.1.1. Schematic representation of the synthesis of iPrNHPhC18PMO_C2. 
 

5.1.2 Experimental details 

Materials synthesis 

The phenylene PMO (PhC18PMO) was obtained following the literature procedures[18–20] by 

hydrolysis and condensation of home-made BTEB precursor[21] in the presence of 

octadecyltrimethylammonium bromide surfactant template (C18-TMA). After synthesis the 

template was extracted by an ethanol/HCl solution. The incorporation of functional amino 

groups into the phenylene rings was achieved upon treatment with very strong acid solutions 

of HNO3–H2SO4 and SnCl2–HCl using the same procedure of Inagaki et al.[7] The final 

material is denoted NH2PhC18PMO. The N-alkylation of NH2PhC18PMO was carried out by 

two reaction cycles under microwave irradiation. To a suspension of NH2PhC18PMO  

(278 mg) in acetonitrile (3 mL), 2-bromopropane (285 mg) and KI (40 mg) were added. A 



Chapter 5 

165 

 

vial containing the previous mixture was then sealed and heated at 170 °C for 20 minutes in 

a CEM Discovery SP microwave. The reacted powder was filtered, washed successively 

with CH2Cl2 (20 mL), NaHCO3 (aqueous saturated solution), brine and dried overnight at 

60 °C. The dried powder was collected and subjected to a second reaction cycle in the same 

conditions as the first one but only with 70% of the initial 2-bromopropane quantity. The 

alkylated samples are denoted iPrNHPhC18PMO_C1 or iPrNHPhC18PMO_C2 after cycle 1 

or cycle 2, respectively. 

 
Materials characterization 

The physical, textural and chemical properties of the prepared PMO materials were 

evaluated by N2 sorption isotherms, TEM, FTIR, 29Si MAS and CP-MAS NMR,  
13C CP-MAS and 15N CP-MAS NMR spectroscopies. The thermal stability of materials was 

evaluated by TGA. Description of the experimental conditions is presented at Chapter 2 and 

the data obtained by PXRD, TEM, N2 sorption isotherms, 29Si MAS and CP-MAS NMR and 

FTIR spectroscopies and TGA and EA analyses are presented in Appendix C. 

 

5.1.3 Results and discussion 

The structural order and the textural physical properties before and after functionalization 

were evaluated by PXRD, TEM and -196 °C N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. PXRD 

patterns of PhC18PMO, NH2PhC18PMO and iPrNHPhC18PMO_C2 (Figure C1.1, Appendix 

C) reveal for all materials the first strong low-angle (100) reflection and the two much less 

intense (110) and (200) peaks, all characteristic for a two-dimensional hexagonal symmetry 

(p6mm) lattice. The characteristic low angle diffraction peaks at d = 4.48 nm (in the pristine 

PhC18PMO material) and at d = 4.53 nm (after functionalization) (Table C1.1, Appendix C) 

allowed the calculation of the lattice parameter a (a = 2d100/?3), which is 5.17 nm and  

5.23 nm for the as-synthesized and functionalized PhC18PMOs, respectively. The peaks at  

d = 7.58 nm are due to the molecular-scale crystal-like structure. Both meso- and molecular-

scale periodicities are preserved after amination and monoalkylation under microwave 

conditions and high temperatures. The TEM images (Figure C1.2, Appendix C) support the 

order along the channel for all materials. The inset in Figure C1.2d shows the hexagonal 

arrangement of pores corroborating the 1D hexagonal structure of the N-alkylated 

PhC18PMO. The -196 °C N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and PSD curves (Figure C1.3, 



Chapter 5 

166 

 

Appendix C) also confirm type IV isotherms (IUPAC classification) for all materials with 

narrow distribution of pore sizes as typically observed for conventional mesoporous 

materials such as MCM-41. The pore size profiles (Figure C1.3 and Table C1.1, Appendix 

C) suffer from a maximum shifting from 3.55 to 3.41 nm with the introduction of the 

isopropyl group into the amine. 

The 13C CP-MAS NMR spectra (Figure 5.1.2) support the amination of the PhC18PMO and 

the N-alkylation of amine moieties in NH2PhC18PMO. The pure PhC18PMO display the 

typical resonance at 134 ppm of the aromatic carbons as reported in literature  

(Figure 5.1.2a).[3,20] Small peaks can be observed in the region 0 to 50 ppm that are related 

to the presence of some non-extracted template.

chemical shift changes of the previously identified resonances in NH2PhC18PMO and the

presence of two new peaks at ca. 41 and 20 ppm (Figure 5.1.2d) corresponding, respectively, 

to the CH and CH3 carbons from the isopropyl group linked to the amine (-NHCH(CH3)2. 

The N-alkylation is also confirmed by 15N CP-MAS NMR (Figure 5.1.3). The 15N NMR 

spectrum of NH2PhC18PMO (Figure 5.1.3a) presents a single peak at ca. -325 ppm, which 

corresponds to the primary amine group (NH2).

c) iPrNHPhC18PMO_C2. 
 

After one cycle of N-alkylation, a new 15N resonance arises at ca. -292 ppm, associated to 

the partial formation of secondary amine groups (Figure 5.1.3b). In a second cycle of 

alkylation, the 15N resonance at ca. -325 ppm is almost vanished, while the peak of the 

secondary amine (-292 ppm), comparatively, increases in intensity (Figure 5.1.3c). 

The 29Si MAS and CP-MAS NMR spectra of all materials are shown in Figure C1.4 

(Appendix C). The parent PhC18PMO exhibits peaks at ca. 81, 71 and 61 ppm assigned to 

T3, T2 and T1 [Tm = RSi(OSi)m(OH)3-m] organosiliceous species, respectively, as described 

in the literature[3,20]. The assignment of the faint T1 peak observed in the 29Si MAS NMR 

spectrum was further supported by the 29Si CP-MAS NMR spectrum where it appears 

enhanced. The amination of PhC18PMO produces significant changes in the spectra. The T1 

peak almost disappears and the intensity of T2 decreases with respect to T3 sites. This means 

that the high acid treatment promotes the further condensation of the free silanol groups. 

After N-alkylation of NH2PhC18PMO, a faint resonance in the region of the Qn species  

[Qn = Si(OSi)n(OH)4-n] is observed in the 29Si spectra of N-alkylated materials, which 

indicates a small amount of carbon-silicon bond cleavage during the N-alkylation reaction

under microwave conditions. The functionalization of the PhC18PMO material was also 

followed by FTIR spectroscopy (Figure C1.5, Appendix C). The presence of amine 

functionalized PhC18PMO aromatic rings is confirmed by the C-N stretching band displayed 

at 1267 cm-1 and the in plane N-H bending vibration (“scissoring” mode) near 1633 cm-1, 

typical of an aromatic primary amine. This later band is overlapped with the band of  

H–O–H bending vibrations. The band at 1633 cm-1 decreases intensity when the amine is 

alkylated, which corroborates the partial transformation of primary to secondary amine as 

secondary amines do not show a band in this region. The N-H stretching modes of aromatic 

primary amines appear at 3408 and 3367 cm-1. The aromatic C-H stretching bands appear in 

the parent PhC18PMO at 3070 cm-1 and at ~3100 cm-1 in the NH2-PMO and N-alkylated 

materials. With the N-alkylation, the C-H stretching vibrations for saturated aliphatic species 

occur at 2980 cm-1. 

Elemental analysis results are presented in Table C1.2 (Appendix C). NH2PhC18PMO has 

an amino group density close to 2 mmol·g-1 (3.2% of NH2), indicating that 47% of phenylene 

bridges were functionalized with the amine group. Using this technique it was confirmed 

that about 87% of NH2PhC18PMO was converted into iPrNHPhC18PMO_C2. The isopropyl 

group appears with a density close to 0.52 mmol·g-1. 

The TGA curves (Figure C1.6, Appendix C) exhibit a first weight loss below 100 °C due to 

desorption of physisorbed water. From 100 to 300 °C a 2% weight loss occurs in the case of 

pure PhC18PMO due to the small quantity of non-extracted template. The parent PhC18PMO 

material has a thermal stability up to 550 °C. Above this value the decomposition and release 

of the organic moieties from the framework takes place. The introduction of the amine group 

and the alkylation of the amine led to an expected decrease of the thermal stability. For 

example, the iPrNHPhC18PMO_C2 is only stable up to 350 °C. 

 

5.1.4 Conclusion 

It was demonstrated that well-ordered amine functionalized periodic mesoporous phenylene-

silica can be modified into the monoalkylated counterpart, by a simple microwave-assisted 

reaction, maintaining its structural integrity. This work proves that it is possible to extend 

typical homogeneous phase reactions to hybrid material design with potential to open an 

avenue toward new applications.

5.2.1 Motivation 

As demonstrated in Sub-chapter 5.1, microwave-assisted synthesis is a fast and simply way 

to modify the amine-phenylene-C18PMO with preservation of both meso- and molecular-

scale periodicities. In the present Sub-chapter, it is used the microwave-assisted synthesis to 

manipulate the amine-phenylene moieties in the NH2PhC18PMO as a versatile approach to 

introduce new physical and chemical properties into PMOs. Novel functional groups may 

be added to the PhC18PMOs by this methodology, which would be unreachable by 

conventional synthetic approaches. Hence, the N,N-dialkylation of NH2PhC18PMO with two 

different alkyl agents is made in order to obtain N,N-dialkylated amine materials with 

different features: i) the (iPr)2NPhC18PMO; and ii) the (NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO 

materials. The latter material is especially interesting since there is the possibility to convert 

the CN moieties into other functional groups for creating novel PMOs with on-demand 

properties to be considered mainly in catalysis and adsorption applications. 

 

5.2.2 Experimental details 

PMO synthesis 

The PhC18PMO[3,20] and the NH2PhC18PMO[7] were prepared according to the literature 

procedures as described in Sub-chapter 5.1.2. 

The microwave-assisted N,N-dialkylation on the NH2PhC18PMO was performed in a CEM 

Discovery SP microwave. The reaction procedure starts with the addition of 1.107 g  

(9.00 × 10-3 mol) of 2-bromopropane and 0.155 g (9.34 × 10-4 mol) of KI to a suspension of 

300 mg of NH2PhC18PMO in 3 mL of acetonitrile. The vial is then closed and heated at 

175 °C for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was filtered, washed sequentially with CH2Cl2  

(20 mL), NaHCO3 (aqueous saturated solution) and brine. Finally, the obtained powder was 

dried overnight at 60 °C. The material was exposed to a second reaction cycle in the same 

conditions, being denoted hereafter as (iPr)2NPhC18PMO. The same procedure was applied 

to the N,N-dialkylation of the NH2PhC18PMO with 3-chloropropionitrile, using the same 

stoichiometry. The obtained material was denoted (NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO. 

The (HOOCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO was prepared by gentle addition of 20 mL of HCl to  

200 mg of (NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO. The reaction was stirred during 4 h at 45 °C. The 



Chapter 5 

171 

 

reaction mixture was washed with NaHCO3 (aqueous saturated solution), filtered-off and 

further washed with distilled water. The final powder was dried at 60 °C. 

An additional sample, the iPrNHPhC18PMO, was prepared to demonstrate the possibility to 

obtain this material in a single cycle only. In this way, 6.82 × 10-3 mol of 2-bromopropane 

and 5.89 × 10-4 mol of KI were added to the previous NH2PhC18PMO and acetonitrile 

suspension. The microwave-assisted reaction was performed at 165 °C during 20 min. The 

same procedure previously described was used to wash and to dry the obtained material. 

 
Materials characterization 

The samples prepared were characterized by PXRD, -196 °C N2 adsorption-desorption 

isotherms, TGA, EA, FTIR, 29Si MAS and CP-MAS NMR, 13C CP-MAS NMR and  
15N CP-MAS NMR spectroscopies. The experimental parameters used for each 

characterization technique are described in Chapter 2 and the data of -196 °C N2-sorption 

isotherms, 29Si NMR, FTIR, TGA and EA techniques are presented in Appendix C. 

 

5.2.3 Results and discussion 

N,N-dialkylated amine-PMOs can be obtained from NH2PhC18PMO by nucleophilic 

aliphatic substitution of an alkyl halide under microwave irradiation. Figure 5.2.1 shows the 

synthetic paths used in this work to prepare (iPr)2NPhC18PMO, (NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO 

and the (HOOCCH2CH2)2NPMO materials. 

The physical and textural features of the prepared PMOs were evaluated by PXRD,  

N2-sorption isotherms and TEM. Figure 5.2.2 shows the PXRD patterns of the synthetized 

PhC18PMO materials. It is possible to observe in Figure 5.2.2 that the parent PhC18PMO 

presents a 2D hexagonal symmetry (p6mm) lattice characterized by the presence of the 

strong (100) reflection at low-angle range (with a d-spacing of 4.46 nm) followed by two 

less intense (110) and (200) reflections (Figure 5.2.2a). A medium range reflection at  

d ? 0.76 nm is also detected which means that the PhC18PMO also has molecular-scale 

periodicity as reported in the literature.[7] The post-functionalization of the phenylene 

moieties of the PhC18PMO material leads to the preparation of functionalized PhC18PMOs 

with (100) reflections that can be compatible with preservation of the 2D hexagonal 

symmetry (p6mm) lattice, Figure 5.2.2. The NH2PhC18PMO is prepared by amination of the 

phenylene moieties of the PhC18PMO and presents a d-spacing of 4.41 nm (Figure 5.2.2b 



Chapter 5

and Table C2.1 Appendix C). The N,N-dialkylation with isopropyl group or with the 

propionitrile alkyl agent led to the preparation of the (iPr)2NPhC18PMO and 

(NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO materials with d-spacings of 4.55 and 4.65 nm, respectively 

(Figure 5.2.2c-d and Table C2.1). 

 
Figure 5.2.2. Schematic representation of the preparation of N,N-dialkylated  
amine-C18PMOs by microwave-assisted reaction: i) amine functionalization of the phenylene 
moieties of PMO; ii) dialkylation of the amine group with a) 2-bromopropane or  
b) 3-chloropropionitrile; and iii) hydrolysis of nitrile group. 
 

Then, the hydrolysis of the nitrile group on the (NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO was carried out 

in order to synthetize the (HOOCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO to show the possibility of 

converting the nitrile species into other functional groups. The mesopore-order of the latter 

material is maintained after acid treatment and displays a d-spacing of 4.50 nm (Figure 5.2.2e 

and Table C2.1). Additionally, it is possible to observe in Figure 5.2.2 a reduction of intensity 

of the (100) reflection of the functionalized materials. This result may be associated to the 

insertion of functional groups into the pores of the PhC18PMO, which causes a reduction of 

the X-ray scattering contrast between the organosilica walls and the added functional 

groups.[22] The prepared materials also show a reflection at d ~ 0.76, which indicates 

molecular-scale periodicity typically observed in this type of PMOs and demonstrating that

the reaction conditions used on the N,N-dialkylation of NH2PhC18PMO leave unaffected the 

periodicity along the channel direction.

The N2 adsorption-desorption measurements and the PSD curves of functionalized amine-

PhC18PMO are depicted in Figure C2.1 (Appendix C). The synthetized PMOs exhibit a type 

IV isotherm, suggesting the presence of mesopores. The PSD curves confirm a narrow 

distribution of the pore diameter. The N,N-dialkylation of the NH2PhC18PMO with the 

isopropyl group leads to a reduction of the SBET, from 658 to 552 m2·g-1. The Vp and dp were 

found to decrease from 0.65 to 0.56 cm3·g-1, and from 3.24 to 3.18 nm, respectively. These 

results prove the insertion of the bulk functional groups into the pores (Figure 5.2.2a and 

Table C2.1, Appendix C). The use of 3-chloropropionitrile as alkyl halide agent gave also 

rise to the reduction of the SBET and Vp, corroborating the successful alkylation of the amine 

functionalities of the NH2PhC18PMO (Figure C2.1b and Table C2.1, Appendix C). The 

hydrolysis of the nitrile functional group in the (NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO to obtain the 

carboxylic acid functional group promotes again a decrease on the SBET, Vp and dp, as can be 

explained by the much bulkier nature of this group relatively to that of nitrile (Figure C2.1b 

and Table C2.1). 

Solid-state 13C CP-MAS NMR spectrum (Figure 5.2.3a) of the NH2PhC18PMO shows four 

typical resonances at ca. 122, 124, 133 and 151 ppm, assigned to the sp2 aromatic carbons 

bonded to the amine group as reported in the literature.[7] The N,N-dialkylation reactions led 

either to slight changes in the chemical shifts or to the presence of additional resonances

when compared to the parent material. The N,N-dialkylation of NH2PhC18PMO with 

isopropyl groups yielded two additional peaks at ca. 21 and 44 ppm (Figure 5.2.3b), 

associated to the CH3 and CH carbons, respectively, which is in good agreement with results 

previously reported in Sub-chapter 5.1.

c) (NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO and d) (HOOCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO. The 13C CP-MAS NMR 
spectra were acquired with a MAS rate of 12, 10, 7 and 10 kHz, respectively. The * denotes spinning 
sidebands. 
 

The reaction of the NH2PhC18PMO using the 3-chloropropionitrile also promotes differences 

in the 13C CP-MAS NMR spectrum. Two resonances are observed at 17 and 21 ppm  

(Figure 5.2.3c) corresponding to the NCCH2CH2- in slightly different chemical 

environments. The resonance associated to the CH2 covalently bonded to the aromatic amine 

appears at ca. 39 ppm. The CN quaternary carbon is not observed in the 13C CP-MAS NMR 

spectra, as it resonates in the same chemical shift range of the sp2 carbons associated to the 

amine phenylene moieties. In order to prove the existence of the CN group in 

(NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO, it was performed the hydrolysis of the nitrile group into COOH, 

which yields the (HOOCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO material. The resulting carboxylic acid 

should be easily detected in the spectrum since it is expected to resonate at higher chemical 

shifts (c.f. &gt; 170 ppm). This reaction brings differences to the spectrum (Figure 5.2.3d) as 

well, i.e., the 13C resonances associated to the HOOC-CH2-, and to the -CH2-N- functions 

appear at ca. 23 and 39 ppm. The third peak associated to the presence of COOH groups is 

observed at ca. 176 ppm. An additional resonance at ca. 172 ppm is only observed in the

spectra of N,N’-dialkylated samples (Figure 5.2.3b-d) and can be related to the formation of 

bicarbonate ions into the materials. Note that tertiary amines can remove stoichiometric 

amounts of CO2 in the presence of moisture and may form bicarbonate ions as reported in 

the literature.[23,24] 

The 15N CP-MAS NMR (Figure 5.2.4) can be used to confirm if N-monoalkylation or 

complete/incomplete N,N-dialkylation occurred in NH2PhC18PMO. The spectrum of 

NH2PhC18PMO shown in Figure 5.2.4a exhibits a single peak at ca. -321 ppm, confirming 

the presence of the primary amine group (NH2). In Figure 5.2.4b, the resonance observed at 

ca. -292 ppm corresponds to the secondary amine (iPrNHPhC18PMO) obtained after  

N-monoalkylation of the NH2PhC18PMO with 2-bromopropane. This shift is in good 

agreement with the results showed in Sub-chapter 5.1. The dialkylated (iPr)2NPhC18PMO 

material presents a single resonance at -244 ppm, that corresponds to the tertiary amine. This 
15N resonance is shifted ~50 ppm towards higher chemical shifts when compared to 

secondary amines (c.f. Figures 5.2.4b and 5.2.4c) and indicates that the dialkylation reaction 

was complete.

Figures 5.2.4d and 5.2.4e show the 15N CP-MAS NMR spectra of the obtained material 

(NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO) upon reaction of 3-chloropropionitrile with NH2PhC18PMO, 

after the first and second reaction cycle, respectively. Three resonances at -320, -270 and  

-244 ppm are observed after the first reaction cycle, associated with primary amines (NH2), 

secondary amines (NCCH2CH2-NH) and tertiary amines ((NCCH2CH2)2-N), respectively 

(Figure 5.2.4d). The second reaction cycle promotes a complete conversion of the primary 

and secondary amines into tertiary amines, which is corroborated by the presence of a single 

resonance at -244 ppm (Figure 5.2.4e). The resonance related to the nitrile group is not 

observed in the 15N CP-MAS NMR spectra. This may happen due to the absence of proton, 

close enough of this quaternary nitrogen, to promote the cross polarization during the 

acquisition of the spectrum. However, the presence of this specie in the material was proved 

in the 13C CP-MAS NMR, presented before, by observation of the resonance associated to 

the carboxylic acid group whose formation occurs due to hydrolysis of the nitrile group.  

The 29Si CP-MAS NMR spectra (Figure C2.2, Appendix C) of the (iPr)2NPhC18PMO, 

(NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO, (HOOCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO show resonances at ca. -81,  

-70 and -61 ppm corresponding to T3, T2 and T1 organosiliceous species  

 [Tm = RSi(OSi)m(OH)3-m], respectively. The applied strong microwave conditions promoted 

some Si-C bond cleavages as concluded from the observed tiny peaks assigned to  

Qn [Qn = Si(OSi)n(OH)4-n] sites. 

The N,N-dialkyaltion modification of the amine group in the NH2PhC18PMO was also 

followed by FTIR spectroscopy (Figure C2.3, Appendix C). The NH2PhC18PMO shows the  

C–N stretching vibration displayed at 1298 cm-1 and the N–H bending vibration 

(“scissoring” mode) near 1625 cm-1, confirming the presence of the aromatic primary amine 

in the framework of the PhC18PMO. The N–H stretching modes of aromatic primary amines 

in the NH2PhC18PMO are observed at 3430-3367 cm-1. The C=C stretching modes of the 

aromatic groups in the framework are observed at ca. 1600 cm-1. The N,N-dialkylation of 

the amine groups promotes the disappearance of the band at 1625 cm-1, additionally, 

different C=C stretching modes are observed between 1500 and 1680 cm-1 that are due to 

non-aminated phenylene groups and N,N-dialkylated phenylene moieties in the PhC18PMO. 

The aromatic C–H stretching bands appear at 3050-3060 cm?1 in the NH2PhC18PMO and 

N,N-dialkylated materials. The N,N-dialkylation promotes the appearance of C–H stretching 

vibrations bands at 2935-3000 cm?1 attributed to saturated aliphatic species of the  



Chapter 5 

177 

 

N,N-dialkylated PhC18PMO materials. The (HOOCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO presents a C–O 

stretching peak at 1263 cm?1, a C=O stretching band at 1664 cm?1, and a O–H stretching 

band at 2963 cm?1; all these bands are consistent with carboxylic acid formation from nitrile 

group. 

The thermal stability of the N,N-dialkylated PMOs was assessed by TGA and the results are 

shown in Figure C2.4, Appendix C. The amine functionalized NH2PhC18PMO is stable up 

to 350 °C.[7] After N,N-dialkylation of the NH2PhC18PMO the thermal stability suffers a 

huge decrease, independently of the alkyl halide agent. The (iPr)2NPhC18PMO and the 

(NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO are stable up to ca. 180 °C as observed in Figure C2.4. The 

conversion of the CN group into the COOH functionality did not affect the thermal stability 

of the material. The first weight loss observed in the TGA of all materials is concomitant 

with desorption of physisorbed water, which occurs below 100 °C. Then, the cleavage and 

release of the alkyl functional groups starts above 180 °C, which is followed by the cleavage 

and release of the amine group directly linked to the phenylene moieties of PhC18PMO at 

ca. 350 °C. Finally, at about 500 °C, the decomposition and release of the phenylene bridges 

from the framework take place. 

Table C2.2 (Appendix C) displays the EA of the NH2PhC18PMO and N,N-dialkylated 

NH2PhC18PMO materials. NH2PhC18PMO displays an amino group density of  

1.68 mmol·g-1, which corresponds to about 40% of phenylene moieties that suffered 

amination. The N,N-dialkylation of NH2PhC18PMO with the isopropyl group leads to an 

increase in the carbon (%C) and hydrogen (%H) percentages and to a decrease in the nitrogen 

percentage (%N), which is in agreement with the substitution of the hydrogens of the primary 

amine by the isopropyl groups. The EA results indicate the conversion of 94% of primary 

amine groups into tertiary amines. The (iPr)2NPhC18PMO material displays an isopropyl 

density close to 1.12 mmol·g-1. The (NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO shows an increase in the C, 

H and N density as expected once the propionitrile groups are being introduced into the 

NH2PhC18PMO. This material presents a propionitrile density of 1.10 mmol·g-1, 

corresponding to an amine conversion close to 92%. The hydrolysis of the CN group of the 

(NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO to prepare the (HOOCCH2CH2)2-N-PMO material is also 

confirmed by the EA technique, by reduction of the %N. The %C and %H also suffer a 

reduction, associated to the introduction of oxygen atoms into the material.

5.2.4 Conclusions 

The N,N-dialkyaltion of NH2PhC18PMO was explored for the first time using a  

microwave-assisted modification synthesis. (iPr)2NPhC18PMO and the 

(NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO materials were achieved and fully characterized, indicating the  

di-alkylation of the aromatic amino groups of the PMOs, while maintaining integrity of the 

meso and molecular orders of the starting materials. 

The nitrile group of the (NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO material can be further modified. 

Therefore, this work provides indication of the potential of the microwave-assisted post-

synthesis modification of the organic bridges of PhC18PMO to introduce alternative 

functional groups. Hence, on-demand PMOs may be developed for a wide range of 

applications.

5.3.1 Motivation 

As it was observed in Sub-chapters 5.1. and 5.2, the amine functional group of the  

amine-phenylene PMO bridge (NH2PhC18PMO)[7] can be modified with alkyl groups 

without destroying the meso- and molecular-scale order was achieved upon consideration of 

the alternative approach. In order to make these materials (e.g. NH2PhC18PMO) more 

competitive, it would be important to reduce their synthesis time. This functionalization 

reaction consists first of a strong acid treatment to introduce the nitro group in the phenyl 

ring, which is followed by its reduction to the amine.[7] 

The effect of the temperature and time of reaction together with the microwave radiation on 

the quantity of nitro groups incorporated in the phenyl bridge of the PMO and their reduction 

to amines is an important aspect since it would make the synthesis of these materials faster 

and, consequently, PMOs would become more attractive for the several foreseen 

applications.  

In this Sub-chapter, it is presented a systematic optimization study of the nitration of 

PhC18PMO at four different temperatures and different reaction times using microwave 

heating treatment. The effects of microwave radiation, synthesis temperature and time on 

the chemical and structural stability of NO2PhC18PMOs were evaluated and correlated with 

the amount of nitro groups introduced in the phenylene moieties. The reduction reaction of 

the nitro group to the amine group was also made at four different temperatures during 15 

minutes. 

 

5.3.2 Experimental details 

PMO synthesis 

The phenylene PMO (PhC18PMO) was synthesized according to the procedure described in 

Sub-chapter 4.1. The surfactant template was extracted using an ethanol/HCl solution. The 

nitro functional groups were incorporated into the phenylene moieties of the PhC18PMO by 

treatment with a strong acid solution of HNO3–H2SO4 using a procedure from the literature[7] 

with subtle modifications. The NO2PhC18PMO was obtained by dropping a solution of 

HNO3 (0.7 mL) and H2SO4 (2.2 mL) into PhC18PMO (250 mg). Vials (10 mL) containing 

the previous mixtures were then sealed and heated at 37, 60, 75 and 90 °C for 15, 120 and 

360 min in a CEM Discovery SP-D microwave apparatus, operating at a frequency of 2.45 

GHz with continuous radiation power from 0 to 300W. By the end, the reaction mixtures 



Chapter 5 

181 

 

were transferred into cold distilled water (150 mL) and were then filtered and successively 

washed with large amounts of water. All samples were dried overnight at 60 °C. The samples 

obtained in this first step of the work are named “NO2PhC18PMO_y/T”, where y is the 

heating time expressed in minutes (min) and T is the heating temperature expressed in degree 

Celsius (°C). The reduction of the nitro to the amine group was accomplished by treatment 

of the different NO2PhC18PMO_15min/60°C with HCl/SnCl2 solution.[7] The 

NH2PhC18PMO was obtained by drop wise of a solution of HCl (3.13 mL) and SnCl2  

(0.33 g) to the NO2PhC18PMO (100 mg). Vials (10 mL) having the above mixtures were 

then closed and heated at 37, 60, 75 and 90 °C during 15 min in a CEM Discovery SP-D 

microwave apparatus. The reaction mixtures were poured into distilled water (100 mL) and 

were then filtered, washed with large amounts of water and followed by washing with a 

solution of isopropylamine (2.5 mL) in ethanol (25 mL). All samples were dried overnight 

at 60 °C. The different samples are denoted “NH2PhC18PMO_15min/T”, where T is the 

heating temperature expressed in °C. 

The conventional syntheses to obtain the NO2PhC18PMO were performed according to  

Ref. [7], at room temperature during 72 h. The syntheses required additional 72 h to attain the 

NH2PhC18PMO (total time was 8640 min). The two samples resulting from the conventional 

synthetic procedure are named NO2PhC18PMO_C and NH2PhC18PMO_C, respectively.  

In order to further check the microwave effect on the nitration of the phenylene bridge of the 

PhC18PMO, a conventional reaction was performed during 15 minutes at 37 °C. The material 

was denoted NO2PhC18PMO_15min/37°C_C. 

 
Materials characterization 

The samples prepared in this study were characterized by PXRD, TEM, SEM, -196 °C 

nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, TGA, EA, FTIR, 29Si MAS and CP-MAS NMR 

and 13C CP-MAS NMR spectroscopies. The experimental parameters used for each 

technique in this study are described in Chapter 2 and some data of 13C CP-MAS NMR,  
29Si NMR, FTIR, PXRD, -196 °C N2-sorption isotherms, TGA, SEM techniques are 

presented in Appendix C.

5.3.3 Results and Discussion 

The nitration of phenylene bridges in PhC18PMO and the subsequent nitro reduction to the 

amine groups under microwave irradiation were successfully accomplished after reaction 

during a total time of only 30 min at 60 °C as confirmed by 13C CP-MAS NMR  

(Figures 5.3.1 and C3.1, Appendix C) and FTIR (Figures 5.3.2, 5.3.6, C3.2 and C3.3) 

spectroscopies. The 13C CP-MAS NMR spectrum of the parent PhC18PMO displays one peak 

at 133.5 ppm assigned to the sp2 carbons from the phenylene bridge.

NH2PhC18PMO_15min/60°C. 

 

The nitration reaction changes the chemical environment of the carbons of the phenylene 

group. In this way, the NO2PhC18PMO_15min/60°C presents four peaks at ca. 151, 137, 133 

and 129 ppm. The reduction of the nitro group to the amine group is also accompanied by 

changes in the 13C CP-MAS NMR spectrum. Thus, the NH2PhC18PMO_15min/60°C 

exhibits five resonance peaks at 150, 133, 124, 122 and 119 ppm that are assignable to the 

carbons in the phenylene moieties with amine groups linked. Thus, when compared with the 

conventional synthesis, microwave heating opens an avenue for faster functionalization of 

the phenylene moieties of PhC18PMO materials with nitro or amine groups. Using the 

microwave procedure, with only 15 min of reaction for each step at 60 °C, it was possible to 



Chapter 5 

183 

 

achieve the same degree of amine functionalization as that obtained after six days of the 

conventional synthesis, c.f. Table 5.3.1. 

The NO2PhC18PMO_y/T materials were also characterized by FTIR spectroscopy to 

corroborate the nitro functionalization of PhC18PMO, Figures 5.3.2 and C3.2. The 

PhC18PMO presents overtones of phenyl vibrations between 1300-2000 cm-1, absorption 

modes assigned to the silanol stretching bands at 3200-3800 cm-1 and C-H aromatic 

stretching bands at 3028 and 3066 cm-1. These values are similar to those described 

previously for PhC18PMO.[7]

cm-1 was chosen to better observe the main bands of functionalization. Black curves are for the parent 
PhC18PMO material. 
 

Some changes in the FTIR spectra of PhC18PMO appear after the nitration reaction. The 

presence of nitro groups in the aromatic rings of the PhC18PMO is confirmed by the C-N 

stretching mode displayed at 1267 cm-1, and by the appearance of strong bands due to N-O 

symmetrical and asymmetrical stretchings at 1352 and 1541 cm-1, respectively. These two 

NO stretching bands are more intense in the case of nitrated PMOs with time reaction of  

360 min than in the materials functionalized during 15 min. It is seen that the spectrum for

of the NO2PhC18PMO_360min/37°C material, c.f. Figures 5.3.2a and 5.3.2b. The nitrated

Figure 5.3.2c displays the FTIR spectra of NO2PhC18PMO_15min/T materials in which it is 

possible to observe the increase of intensity of the two NO stretching bands with increasing

directly correlated with the increase of temperature and in turn it can be correlated with the 

injection of microwave irradiation power. The microwave radiation effect is observed 

through the comparison of the FTIR spectra of NO2PhC18PMO_15min/37°C and the NO2 

PhC18PMO_15min/37°C_C, Figure C3.2d. The material prepared under microwave-assisted 

heating presents much intense NO stretching bands than the material prepared using 

conventional heating at the same temperature, which corroborates the favorable effect of the 

microwave irradiation on speeding up the nitration of the bissilylated phenylene bridge of 

the PhC18PMO. 

Table 5.3.1 shows the results of the elemental analyses for the PhC18PMO parent material 

and for the materials aminated under different reaction conditions.

a% of phenylene bridges aminated is calculated based on %N and assuming single amination, i.e., one amine 
group per phenylene bridge. 
 

The NH2PhC18PMO sample from conventional synthesis holds an amino group density equal 

to 1.78 mmol·g-1 (1.78% of N). Assuming an incorporation of just one amine group per 

phenylene bridge, this density value indicates that ~42% of phenylene bridges were 

successfully functionalized. Under microwave irradiation at 37 °C, such a high value of 

functionalization (maximum was 1.16 mmol·g-1) could not be reached. It is also concluded 

that the irradiation time strongly influences the nitration reaction at 37 °C since an increase 

in the density of amine groups from 1.16 to 1.59 mmol·g-1 is obtained with the increase of 

the nitration reaction from 15 to 120 min, respectively. The increase in the density of amine 

groups obtained upon incrementing the time of reaction from 120 to 360 min is less evident, 

i.e., a slight increase of 0.20 mmol·g-1 is found in the latter. When the synthesis is carried 



Chapter 5

out at 60 °C, the density of amine groups in the PhC18PMO after 15 min of reaction reaches 

a value of 1.76 mmol·g-1, which is similar to the density in the sample obtained by 

conventional synthesis. This demonstrates that the reaction is extremely dependent on the 

temperature and heating source. Note that the microwave injected 230 W of power to achieve 

60 °C, which is 140 W higher than the value required to reach 37 °C. The higher amount of 

amine groups introduced into the phenylene moieties may be due to the faster diffusion of 

the amine contents into the PhC18PMO at 60 °C. The increase of amine groups in the 

phenylene moieties takes place when the time is raised from 15 to 120 min with a difference 

of 0.26 mmol·g-1, corresponding to a percentage of phenylene bridges nitrated close to 6%. 

The difference is even lower when the time is extended to 360 min, with a density of amine 

groups of approximately 2.11 mmol·g-1, i.e., an increase of only 0.09 mmol·g-1 when 

compared to the NO2PhC18PMO_120min/60°C material (Table 5.3.1). The use of 

microwave power to reach 60 °C leads to a higher nitro content than the use of conventional 

heating to reach the same temperature. This was observed for the synthesis of the material 

NO2PhC18PMO_C_4320min/60°C (conventional synthesis during 3 days made at 60 °C) 

which has similar amount of nitro groups than the material NO2PhC18PMO_240min/60°C. 

Moreover, the NO2PhC18PMO_C_4320m/60°C material loose the meso-scale periodicity 

(not shown) which is a huge disadvantaged comparing with the similar material made by 

using microwave heating. 

Table 5.3.1 also reveals the amount of nitro groups incorporated in the phenylene moieties 

of the PhC18PMO material with the increase of the temperature for similar reaction time  

(15 min). The consideration of high temperature is found to promote the introduction of 

higher amounts of nitro groups into the PhC18PMO channels. Since 

NH2PhC18PMO_15min/75°C presents a nitrogen density of 2.11 mmol·g-1 which is similar 

to that for NH2PhC18PMO_360min/60°C, it suggests that the temperature is very important 

to control the nitrogen density into the PhC18PMO for short times of reaction. By increasing 

the temperature reaction to 90 °C resulted in a PhC18PMO material having the highest 

content of nitro groups linked to the phenylene bridge of the PhC18PMO. The nitrogen 

density of 2.26 mmol·g-1 determined for NH2PhC18PMO_15min/90°C corresponds to a total 

of nitrated phenylene moieties of more than 50%. 

The 29Si MAS and CP-MAS NMR spectra of PhC18PMO, NO2-PMO_15min/37°C and 

NO2PhC18PMO_360min/60°C are shown in Figure 5.3.3. The pure PhC18PMO exhibits

peaks at ca. 81, 71.5 and 61.5 ppm, which correspond to T3, T2 and T1 organosiliceous 

species, respectively. As expected taking into account the literature, significant changes are 

introduced in the 29Si NMR spectra of NO2PhC18PMO_y/T materials upon the nitration 

reaction.[7] Peaks related with the presence of Qn species are absent in the 29Si spectra for all 

materials, which is a strong evidence that carbon-silicon bond cleavage is not happening 

during the nitration reaction under microwave conditions.

PXRD was used to evaluate the structural order of all materials. Figure 5.3.4 shows the 

PXRD patterns of the PhC18PMO and NO2PhC18PMO_y/T obtained at different reaction 

conditions (temperature and time). All prepared materials displayed an intense low angle 

reflection and two much less intense peaks all corresponding, respectively, to the (100), 

(110) and (200) reflections characteristic of the two-dimensional hexagonal symmetry 

(p6mm) lattice. The PhC18PMO and the two most extreme NO2PhC18PMO samples, i.e., 

NO2PhC18PMOs synthesized during 15 minutes at 37 °C or during 360 min at 60 °C, exhibit 

the first strong characteristic low angle (100) reflections at d = 4.55 nm, 4.70 nm and 4.55 

nm, respectively. From the spacing (d) of the (100) peak it can be calculated the hexagonal 

unit cell lattice parameter, a, which is equal to 2d100/?3 (Table C3.1). For the samples 

PhC18PMO, NO2PhC18PMO_15min/37°C and NO2PhC18PMO_15min/60°C, the first sharp 

diffraction at medium-range reflection can be detected at d = 0.761, 0.762  and 0.758 nm, 

respectively, which is attributed to the periodic arrangement of the organic bridge within the 

pore walls of these materials. Thus, both meso- and molecular- scale periodicities are

preserved after nitration reaction under the conditions described and this is also valid for the 

other materials obtained under different conditions. Attempts were made for fast synthesis 

(15 min) of materials with more than 50% of phenylene moieties mono-nitrated into the 

PhC18PMO channels by increasing the temperature of the nitration reaction to 75 and 90 °C.

Figure C3.4 shows PXRD patterns for the materials obtained under these conditions. The 2D 

hexagonal symmetry (p6mm) lattice is attained for all the materials as supported by the 

observation of the first strong peak corresponding to the (100) reflection and two less intense 

peaks corresponding to the (110) and (200) reflections. The PhC18PMO and the 

NO2PhC18PMOs synthesized at 37, 60, 75 and 90 °C exhibit the first strong characteristic 

low angle (100) reflection at d = 4.55 nm, 4.70 nm, 4.70 nm, 4.82 nm and 4.82 nm, 

respectively, Table C3.1. From the d100 peaks it can be calculated the hexagonal unit cell 

parameter a = (2d100/?3) = 5.25 nm for the PhC18PMO and a values between 5.20 nm and 

5.57 nm were obtained for the nitrated PhC18PMO (Table C3.1).

perpendicular to the pores where it is clear their 2D hexagonal arrangement. 
 

The -196 °C N2 sorption isotherms and PSD curves (Figure C3.5) confirm the characteristic 

type IV isotherms (IUPAC classification) and narrow distribution of pore sizes for the pure 

PhC18PMO and NO2 PhC18PMO_y/T materials commonly seen in mesoporous materials.[3] 

A decrease of the SBET and Vp upon increase of the temperature and reaction times is 

consistent with the enhancement of the degree of functionalization with nitro groups. The 

SBET of the materials synthetized at 37 °C decreases with the increase of the reaction time. 

The increase in the reaction temperature from 37 to 60 °C is also accompanied by a decrease 

of the SBET. The N2 sorption isotherms display the increase of the SBET with the increase of 

the reaction time for the nitrated materials prepared at 60 °C (Table C3.1), which is the 

opposite of what is expected. This can be attributed to the splitting of the large aggregates 

into small particles due to the microwave irradiation as observed before by Smeulders  

et al.[8] in the microwave-assisted synthesis of PhC18PMO under long reaction times. 

Figure C3.6 shows the TGA curves for PhC18PMO and NO2PhC18PMO at 37 and 60 °C for 

two different time extremes. The first weight loss for all materials corresponds to desorption 

of physisorbed water occurring below 100 °C. The PhC18PMO material presents a thermal 

stability up to 550 °C. Above this temperature, all materials suffer decomposition due to the 

degradation of the phenylene bridges from the framework. The nitro group introduction in 

the phenylene moieties decreases the thermal stability of all materials and a new weight loss,

corresponding to the cleavage of nitro group in the phenylene bridge of the material, is 

observed at approximately 400 °C. 

SEM images for NO2PhC18PMO materials obtained using different synthetic conditions are 

shown in Figure C3.7. The SEM images reveal the high order along the channels for all 

materials. The particle size of the different materials as a function of the reaction conditions 

could not be determined due to formation of ordered aggregates. 

The reduction of the nitro groups is a very important step for obtaining the aminated 

compounds and the decrease of the reaction time will have obvious implications for the 

consideration of these materials in catalysis and adsorption applications. 

The nitro to amine reduction was followed by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, Figure 5.3.6. Upon 

treatment with SnCl2–HCl, the N–O stretching vibrations disappeared completely in the case 

of reaction at 60 °C while new bands attributable to the bending and stretching modes of  

N–H appeared at 1633 and 3340–3487 cm-1, respectively. It was also possible to observe the 

importance of the microwave heating in this reaction.

The reduction of the nitro to the amine groups at 37 °C was made using microwave and 

conventional heating and the samples were labelled NH2PhC18PMO_15min/37°C and 

NH2PhC18PMO_15m/37°C_C, respectively. The use of microwave heating promotes the 

reduction of a larger content of nitro groups, which causes a significant diminution of the 

intensity of the N–O stretching vibrations bands.

The 29Si MAS and CP-MAS NMR spectra of the NH2PhC18PMO_15min/60°C sample are 

presented in Figure C3.8. The peaks at ca. -81, -71 and -61 ppm are assigned to the T3, T2 

and T1 organosiliceous species of the NH2PhC18PMO material. The 29Si NMR spectrum also 

shows that no Si-C bond cleavage is observed. 

Figure 5.3.7a shows PXRD patterns for PhC18PMO, NO2PhC18PMO_15min/60°C and 

NH2PhC18PMO_15min/T. All materials display the first strong peak corresponding to the 

(100) reflection and two less intense peaks corresponding to the (110) and (200) reflections 

corresponding to the 2D hexagonal symmetry (p6mm) lattice. The intensities of these two 

peaks decreased with the reduction of the nitro groups. The molecular periodicity is 

preserved with the increase of the reaction temperature.

The PhC18PMO and the NH2PhC18PMO_15min/T synthesized at 37, 60, 75 and 90 °C exhibit 

the first strong characteristic low angle (100) reflection at d = 4.55, 4.37, 4.41, 4.37 and 4.46 

nm, respectively, Table C3.2. 

The -196 °C N2 sorption isotherms shown in Figure C3.9 confirm the type IV isotherms for 

the synthetized NH2PhC18PMO_15min/T materials and PSD curves confirms the narrow 

distribution of pore sizes. 

The thermal stability of the amine PhC18PMO is similar to that of the PhC18PMO nitrated, 

Figure C3.10. The cleavage of the amine group in the phenylene bridge of the aminated 

material, is observed at approximately 400 °C. The thermal stability of the NH2PhC18PMO 

is not affected by the use of different reaction temperatures using the microwave heating. 

The thermal stability is similar to that of the aminated PhC18PMO material prepared 

conventionally.[7] 

 

5.3.4 Conclusions 

This study shows that the time and the temperature of reaction are essential factors in the 

nitration of phenylene moieties of PhC18PMO materials and subsequent reduction of the 

nitro groups to amines. The information gathered from different experimental techniques, 

namely elemental analysis, TGA, and 13C CP-MAS NMR, 29Si CP-MAS NMR and FTIR 

spectroscopies, shows that changing the time and temperature of the nitration reaction under 

microwave irradiation has a huge influence on the amount of nitro groups incorporated into 

the PhC18PMO without cleavage of the Si-C bond. Both meso- and molecular-scale 

periodicities are preserved after strong acid treatment under microwave heating (observed 

by PXRD patterns and TEM images).  

The temperatures used in the microwave heating (37 and 60 °C) are accompanied by 

different behaviors of the kinetic profiles. It was possible to find a clear dependence of the 

amount of nitro groups incorporated into the PhC18PMOs with the reaction time (up to 120 

min) for reactions carried out at 37 °C comparing with reactions made at 60 °C. SEM does 

not show differences on the particles of parent and functionalized materials. A significant 

reduction in the time required for the nitration of phenylene bridges in PhC18PMO was 

observed upon microwave irradiation. Characterization with several different techniques 

suggests that nitration occurs without modification of the structural properties of the parent 

PhC18PMO. Importantly, in some cases, e.g. microwave-assisted reaction at T = 60 °C and 



Chapter 5 

192 

 

y = 120 min, the nitro groups content incorporated into the PhC18PMO channels was larger 

than that achieved under conventional conditions (3 days at room temperature), while similar 

contents between microwave-assisted and conventional heating were found when the 

synthesis used microwave irradiation during 15 min at 75 °C. Furthermore, the nitration 

reaction carried out at 90 °C during 15 min resulted in a content of nitrated phenylene 

moieties above 50%. 

The microwave synthesis method presents clear advantages when compared with the 

conventional synthesis approaches, both in time and in the amount of nitro groups 

incorporated in the phenylene moieties of the PhC18PMO material. The use of the microwave 

heating promotes a high control of the nitro groups incorporated into the phenylene moieties 

of the PhC18PMO material. Additionally, the reduction of the nitro to the amine groups was 

also successfully achieved after treatment with SnCl2/HCl under microwave irradiation with 

preservation of the structural order. 

The use of microwave heating speeds up the nitration of the phenylene-C18PMO probably 

due to the presence of polar intermediate species, such as nitronium ion and water molecules. 

Moreover the transition state of the material should be more reactive under microwave 

irradiation when compared to thermal heating due to the specific microwave absorption by 

the polar reactants. In addition, it is believed that the diffusion of the reactant species through 

the mesochannels of the phenylene-C18PMO is improved using the microwave irradiation, 

allowing a fast access of the nitronium ion to the phenylene bridges for the nucleophilic 

attack, which is a determinant rate step. 

Although phenylene-C18PMO is considered an apolar substance, i.e. being a weaker 

microwave irradiation absorber, it must be considered that the silanols and the delocalization 

of the electrons by the approximation of the positive nitronium ion can play a beneficial role 

in the local heating. In the amination step, the nitro groups attached to the phenylene bridges 

are also important for the generation of local heating which will speed-up the reaction.

This final Chapter presents the general conclusions of the work developed in the 

framework of this PhD Thesis. It is proposed a list of possible research lines that may be 

followed in the future aiming the improvement of the properties of PMO materials, not 

only in adsorption and separation applications, but also in catalysis.

6.1. General Conclusions 

In this PhD Thesis, the synthesis and modification of several PMO materials were 

successfully accomplished using different synthetic approaches. Figure 6.1 summarizes the 

work performed over the last 4 years and presents the main conclusions. 

 

 

Figure 6.1. Preparation of novel PMOs using different synthetic strategies and their main physical 

or chemical characteristics for the CO2 and CH4 separation. 
 

The materials were fully characterized; they showed two-dimensional hexagonal symmetry 

(p6mm) lattice and molecular-scale periodicities as observed by PXRD and TEM. Most of 

the prepared materials were tested in the CO2 and CH4 adsorption/separation at 35 or 25 °C 

(Chapters 3 and 4). All tested materials are selective for CO2, i.e., they are able to adsorb 

much larger amounts of CO2 than of CH4 and, therefore, they can be considered as 

promising candidates for the separation of mixtures of these two gases. In fact, the amount 



Chapter 6 

197 

 

of adsorbed methane in all the materials tested was found to be very low. Additionally, 

DFT modelling was performed for the materials presenting mainly amino groups in order 

to understand how the surfaces of the pristine and modified materials interact with the CO2 

and CH4 molecules (Chapter 3). In the case of the synthetized amine-modified phenylene 

PMOs having different pore sizes, a direct correlation between the amounts of CO2 

adsorbed and the pore sizes or the specific surface areas of the PMO materials was not 

found. However, the differences in the adsorbed quantities of CO2 could be related with the 

percentage of T2SMP silanol species, providing a good prediction of the experimental 

Henry’s law constants for pure CO2 adsorption on each material (Sub-chapter 3.1). Thus, 

the best adsorbent properties are correlated with the largest degrees of silica condensation. 

The amination of the phenylene moieties of the PhCnPMO was more effective on materials 

displaying smaller pore size, which was accompanied by the concomitant increase of the 

KH for the CO2.  

The grafting of the alkyl amines to the materials with smaller pore size to offer 

APTMS@PhC12PMO and APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO adsorbents improved the adsorption 

of CO2 without increasing the adsorption of CH4 (Sub-chapter 3.2). It was observed that 

the introduction of amines into the PhC12PMO material is in general accompanied by an 

increase of the quantity of adsorbed CO2 over the studied pressure range. The Henry’s 

constants for CO2 adsorption were significantly increased, growing in the order PhC12PMO 

&amp;lt;NH2PhC12PMO &amp;lt;APTMS@NH2PhC12PMO &amp;lt;APTMS@PhC12PMO, i.e., the 

APTMS@PhC12PMO material has more affinity for CO2 than any other amine-modified 

PMO material (with a KH for CO2 of 1.83 × 10
-2 mmol·g-1·kPa-1). The results suggested 

that the type of amine presents a dominant effect on the CO2 sorption affinity, more than 

the nitrogen content in the PMO channels, demonstrating that alkyl amines interact more 

favorably with CO2 than aromatic amines. Periodic DFT calculations confirmed the 

behavior observed for the amino-functionalized PhPMO presented above on the CO2 and 

CH4 adsorption. Furthermore, the strengths of the adsorbate-adsorbent interactions were 

found to correlate well with the Henry’s constants from the experimental adsorption 

studies. 

The Al-PhC18PMO#50 material (Chapter 4) showed acidic Al
V aluminium oxide species 

that are probably responsible for the observed increase in the CO2/CH4 separation 

selectivity. 



Chapter 6

The pyrolysis of phenylene- and biphenylene- PMO families resulted in carbonized PMO 

materials with differences in both the chemistry and the textural properties of the materials 

(Chapter 4). The reduction of pore size to micro-pores was the most significant difference 

observed when compared with the starting materials, leading to an improvement of the 

CO2 adsorption capacity and the selectivity for CO2/CH4 separation. The highest selectivity 

on the CO2/CH4 separation was observed for materials with the highest microporosity. The 

most interesting material for CO2/CH4 separation is the biphenylene-PMO pyrolysed at 

1200 °C, presenting the highest KH for the CO2 (2.34 × 10
-2 mmol·g-1·kPa-1) observed in 

this PhD study (Chapters 3 and 4), which is remarkable for a material without further 

amine functionalization and showing that the relation between micro- and meso-porosity 

plays an important role in the adsorption of CO2 and CH4. 

Table 6.1 presents a comparison of the materials prepared in this PhD Thesis and tested in 

the CO2 and CH4 adsorption.

As it is possible to observe in Table 6.1, the materials with the best CO2 adsorption 

properties are the APTMS@PhC12PMO and the BphC18PMO_P1200, with CO2 adsorption 

capacities of 0.72 and 0.93 mmol·g-1, respectively, but the materials with the best 

behaviour for the CO2/CH4 separation are the APTMS@PhC12PMO and  

Al-PhC18PMO#50, showing that the relation between micro- and meso-porosity and 

surface chemistry features are the main characteristics leading to the enhancement of the 



Chapter 6 

199 

 

CO2 adsorption without affecting the adsorption of CH4. The presence of a good relation 

between micro- and meso- porosity improves the adsorption of CO2, while the presence of 

alkyl amines allows a reduction of the CH4 adsorption. Thus, the preparation of an alkyl 

amine grafted BphC12PMO material could be remarkable in the CO2/CH4 

adsorption/separation, through creation of microporosity originated by the introduction of a 

significant amount of alkyl amines. The preparation of these material it was not yet 

possible due to difficulties found in the preparation of BphC12PMO material with highly 

ordered pores. 

In order to make the PMO materials more interesting for adsorption or even catalytic 

applications, the microwave-assisted synthesis was utilized to introduce different kinds of 

amine groups into the PMOs in a fast and easy way (Chapter 5). Using this type of heating 

it was possible the modification of the amine moieties of the NH2PhC18PMO with different 

alkyl groups (iPr- and NCCH2CH2- groups), through N-monoalkylation or  

N,N-dialkylation, without destroying the structural integrity of the parent PMO  

(Sub-chapters 5.1 and 5.2) and to prepare NH2PhCnPMOs in 30 min. of microwave heating 

in a two-step amination process (Sub-chapter 5.3). Furthermore, it was proved that the 

nitrile group of the (NCCH2CH2)2NPhC18PMO material remains intact on the surface of 

the materials, which may enable additional functionalization, as for instance, by chemical 

modification into carboxylic acids, amines or even transformation into amino acids. 

Therefore, this work provides indication of the potential of the microwave-assisted post-

synthesis modification of the organic bridges of PhC18PMO to introduce alternative 

functional groups. Hence, on-demand PMOs may be developed for a wide range of 

applications. 

 

6.2. Recommendations for further research 

In terms of future work, it is suggested the improvement of the PMO features for the CO2 

and CH4 adsorption. In fact, from this PhD Thesis it becomes clear that the preparation of 

adsorbents for biogas upgrading needs to have into account several different factors, such 

as, functional group loading, surface area, pore volume and pore size, distances between 

functional groups and distances between functional groups and silanols. 

In this way, it is proposed to modify the PMO features in order to: 

 



Chapter 6 

200 

 

i) reduce even more the pore size of the aromatic-bridge PMOs (PhCnPMO and 

BphCnPMO with n &amp;lt;12); 

ii) create microporosity in the PMO using bissilylated precursor with different alkyl 

amines by grafting reaction; 

iii) prepare PMOs with amine functional groups introduced in favorable positions to 

connect with CO2 molecules, i.e., place functional groups at an adequate distance 

from each other  for enhancing the chemical characteristics for CO2 adsorption. 

Thus, the preparation of PMOs materials with amino acids (tyrosine, histidine, 

alanine, arginine, etc.), amino alcohols or pyridine and indole compounds bonded to 

the amines of the NH2PhCnPMOs is proposed, as well as, the evaluation of the 

resulting materials in the adsorption of CO2 and CH4; 

iv) impregnate a fine layer of polyethyleneimine (PEI) into the pores of PMO, in order 

to incorporate significant amounts of alkylamines and to generate microporosity into 

the PMO without clogging the pores; 

v) prepare selective nanocomposite-PMOs using the ALD technique. To accomplish 

such goal the study of surface dependency in the aluminium oxide deposition must 

be made (i.e. deposition of aluminium oxide into BphCnPMO, SBA-15, MCM-41, 

etc). Additionally, the creation of defects in the aluminium oxide layer can improve 

the CO2 adsorption; such creation of defects can be done by chemical attack of the 

Al-PhC18PMO#50 composite. Alternatively, a different metal oxide can be inserted 

into the PMO materials; 

vi) introduce nitrogen functional groups which are not easily labile in pyrolysis process 

(by preparation of pyridine- or bipyridine- PMOs or even by post-synthetic 

functionalization of PMO with N2 or NH3 cold plasma treatment);  

vii) create biocomposites-PMOs with introduction of a fine layer of chitosan or chitosan 

and melanine into the PMO materials and to proceed to the pyrolysis of the resulting 

materials. This can be an interesting approach since it has been demonstrated that the 

pyrolysed chitosan presents interesting CO2 adsorption properties. Also, this polymer 

is a cheap raw material that can be used to insert amine groups and to create 

microporosity into the PMOs. These chitosan-PMO composites may display 

electrical conductive features and can be also good candidates for the 

electroreduction of CO2.  



Chapter 6 

201 

 

In parallel with this, it is also important to continue the computer simulation using the 

same approach considered in this PhD Thesis, for screening other phenylene-PMO 

functionalizations or of other organic bridged PMOs, with the desired characteristics for 

CO2/CH4 separation. Additionally, as the computational cost is an important factor for 

screening purposes, small but appropriate cluster models centered on the organic or 

inorganic moieties are thought to study the surface of PMO materials with large organic 

bridges and their interactions with CO2 and CH4. State-of-the-art DFT functionals need to 

be tested as well as the cluster size, stoichiometry and shape of the PMO cluster model. 

As referred in Chapter 1, several PMO materials present intrinsic structural features for 

catalytic applications (Knövenagel condensation, kinetic resolution of hydrobenzoin or of 

1,2-diphenylethane-1,2-diol, etc.), and adsorption of metal ions (Hg(II), Cu(II), etc.) or 

organic compounds (naproxen, etc.) when compared with other kinds of materials (silicas, 

MOFs and zeolites). It will be interesting to test the prepared PMOs in these applications.  

As it is understood from this PhD Thesis, the preparation of different kinds of PMO 

materials, using different functionalization strategies, to change their physical, chemical 

and textural properties is an important way to find new remarkable materials for a wide 

range of applications. In this way, the search for new strategies targeting the synthesis 

and/or the modification of novel PMOs is a step to be explored in the future for obtaining 

materials with enhanced adsorptive properties.

A1.1. Experimental manometric apparatus 

The custom made manometric experimental setup shown in Figure S1 is composed of two 

gas and sample chambers allowing the analysis of two adsorbents simultaneously. Pressure 

and temperature are monitored and valves are controlled by a personal computer running a 

custom made LabVIEW program.  

All valves are from ASCO (Emerson) and are pneumatic actuated. Valves 2 and 4 are 

normally opened valves (ref. E290A794) while the remaining are normally closed (ref. 

E290A791). 

Valves 1 and 3 enable the introduction of the gas (from Gas Inlet) or evacuation of the system 

(towards the atmosphere, through valve 6, or towards the vacuum pump, through valve 7). 

Valves Val 2 and 4 allow the isolation of the samples of adsorbent in the sample tanks when 

feeding or evacuating the gas tanks.  

The oven used for adsorbents activation and temperature control is a GC 1000 from Dani 

(Dani Instruments Spa, Milan, Italy). 

Temperature sensors TS are PT-100 Resistance Temperature Detector probe (type PR-11-2-

M30-300-MI-B) from Omega (Omega Engineering Ltd, Manchester, United Kingdom). 

Stainless steel tubing, tanks and fittings are from Swagelok. 

The pressure transducers PS (Unik 5000, PMP 5013-TB-A3-CA-HO-PA, 0-2.5 bar (A) and 

0-10 bar (B), absolute) from GE are used to follow the pressure inside the tanks along the 

experiment.  

The volume of the gas tanks (volume between valves 1 and 2) is 73.4 cm3 and 71.3 cm3, and 

the volume of the sample tanks (including free volume of the tubes until valves 2 and 4) is 

of 24.8 cm3 and 26.4 cm3 for unit 1 and 2, respectively. These volumes were determined by 

two independent helium picnometry experiments.

aNote that the %C of carbon for the non-aminated samples can be theoretically calculated using the Tm function 
of % T3, % T2, and % T1 silicon species in the pure PhCnPMO material. In this way, based on the molecular 
formula of organosilicas SiO1.5-R-SiO1.5, the percentage of carbon can be calculated as %C = [3 × At.Wt.C / 
(1.5 × At.Wt.O + 1 × At.Wt.Si + 3 × At.Wt.C + 2 × At.Wt.H)] × % T3 + [3 × At.Wt.C / (2 × At.Wt.O + 1 × At.Wt.Si 
+ 3 × At.Wt.C + 3 × At.Wt.H)] × % T2 + [3 × At.Wt.C / (2.5 × At.Wt.O + 1 × At.Wt.Si + 3 × At.Wt.C + 3 × 
At.Wt.H)] × % T1, where At.Wt. stands for the atomic weights of the elements and % T3, % T2 and % T1 are 
the percentages of Tm silanol species reported in Table A1.1. For instance, in the case of the C12-PMO material, 
the formula above gives %C = [3 × 12.011 / (1.5 × 15.999 + 1 × 28.085 + 3 × 12.011 + 2 × 1.008)] × 66.58 + 
[3 × 12.011 / (2 × 15.999 + 1 × 28.085 + 3 × 12.011 + 3 × 1.008)] × 31.40 + [3 × 12.011 / (2.5 × 15.999 + 1 × 
28.085 + 3 × 12.011 + 3 × 1.008)] × 2.02 = 38.70 %. The % C for the remaining samples are 38.68 %, 38.73 
% and 38.39 %, respectively for PhC14PMO, PhC16PMO and PhC18PMO. The maximum difference observed 
between theoretical and experimental %C is 2.35 % for PhC16PMO. The good qualitative agreement supports 
the consideration of the % T3, % T2 and % T1 for providing a quantitative measurement of the Tm environments 
in each sample, which is essential to support the function described by equation 3.1.4. bThe percentage of Si-
O was determined by the equation % Si-O = 100 % - % C - % H - % N.
