Uma nova metodologia para a determinação de compostos gasosos de enxofre presentes em
atmosferas urbanas foi desenvolvida e aplicada durante três meses na região central da cidade de
Porto Alegre- RS e em uma refinaria de petróleo, localizada  próxima à essa cidade. O método se
baseia na determinação coulométrica da taxa de sulfetação da prata pura. Os resultados foram
comparados com o método da pararosanilina, que está sendo atualmente utilizado para a determinação
de SO2 em alguns dos locais aqui estudados. Os resultados obtidos mostraram que uma boa
correlação entre o método coulométrico e o método da pararosanilina é observada quando somente
SO2 está presente, como normalmente é esperado para atmosferas urbanas. Quando H2S está
também presente, como no caso das áreas industriais, a  nova metodologia tende fortemente a super
estimar derivados gasosos de enxofre.

A new procedure for the determination of atmospheric sulfur compounds was developed and
applied during three months in the central area of the City of Porto Alegre- RS, and one month near
an oil refinery located close to this city. The method is based on the coulometric determination of the
tarnishing rate of pure silver. The results were compared with the method of pararosaniline, which
is being currently used in some of the studied sites for the determination of SO2. The results obtained
showed a good correlation between the coulometric method and the pararosaniline method, when
only SO2 is present, as usually is the case of urban atmospheres. When H2S is also present, as in the
case of industrial areas, the methodology tends to strongly overestimate SO2 concentration.

Introduction

Besides suspended particles, gaseous compounds, such
as carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and sulfur
dioxide (SO2), are normally the main atmospheric pollut-
ants in urban areas1, 2. Previous studies showed that in
Porto Alegre- RS, approximatly 3.7 tons of SOx are daily
emitted. Further 3.4 tons of SOx per day are produced in the
industrial metropolitan area around the city3.

The main SO2 source in urban areas is commonly
accepted as resulting from the use of fossil fuels. In warm
regions like Southern Brazil, the main source should be
attributed to the transport activity and to the use of Diesel

oil. Due to local variations in the traffic density and in the
wind velocity in a city, a local monitoring of SO2 is more
adequate to identify critical areas, which are harmful to the
human health and are also very corrosive to metals, stones
and concrete structures.

The aim of the present study was to develop a method
for the determination of atmospheric SO2 content. The
method should be inexpensive and simple, making pos-
sible the local determination of the mean concentration in
several points in an urban area. As showed below, the tar-
nishing rate of silver shows the desired characteristics for
an indicator of the SO2 concentration.

Pure silver, when exposed to H2S or SO2, forms a tar-
nishing layer consisting only of achantite (alpha Ag2S).
This sulfide has an extremely low solubility product in
water, Kps=1 10-50 mol L-1 3,4 and is very conductive and
adherent to the silver surface, enabling its coulometric de-
termination after the atmospheric exposure of silver3, 5.

Moreover, due to the high mobility of Ag+ ions in the
Ag2S salt, the tarnishing rate is time independent for tar-
nishing layers up to several microns thick, being directly
proportional to the H2S and SO2 concentrations5. As an
example, the tarnishing rate of Ag in 1ppm H2S, which is
higher than the one in SO2, remains controlled by surface
reaction for several days6, 7.

The results presented here were measured during the
southern hemisphere summer of 1999 in three urban points
of Porto Alegre- RS, showing heavy traffic, where only
SO2 is expected, and also in two sites near an oil refinery,
with different distances from a H2S source. An increasing
SO2/H2S concentration ratio is expected here for greater
distances from the H2S source, resulting from the oxida-
tion of H2S to SO2 during its transport from the source to
the measuring site. A long-term study is now under way to
determine the influence of traffic intensity and climate
parameters in the correlation between the coulometric and
pararosaniline methods.

Experimental

For the coulometric determination of tarnishing rates,
coupons of pure silver (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99% Ag) with
geometric areas between 5 and 6 cm2 were cut and provided
with a 0.5 mm diameter hole. After vacuum annealing
(650 °C  h-110-2 atm) the coupons were polished on both
sides with emery paper up to 2400 mesh and degreased in
ethanol. For the atmospheric exposure, the coupons were
hanged by a PTFE thread in the vertical position at five “moni-
toring stations”, where a good ventilation and rain protection
were provided, and also other atmospheric data were being
collected. Three monitoring stations were located in down-
town sites, with dense traffic, Rodoviária, Borges and Azenha.
Among these sites, Rodoviária, where the Central Bus Sta-
tion is located, shows usually the highest SO2 emissions. The
other two monitoring stations were located at 19 km far from
downtown of Porto Alegre- RS, at the oil refinery “Refinaria
Alberto Pasqualine-Petrobras”, namely REFAP1 and REFAP2.
The station REFAP1 lied 750 m far from an H2S-SO2-source,
and REFAP2, respectively 1,500 m. At three of these stations,
Rodoviária, REFAP1 and REFAP2, SO2 was also collected
and the concentration determined by the pararosaniline
method as described in the appropriate norm8. The expo-
sures were proceeded from January to March 1999. The mean
relative humidity and temperature during this period were
79.4% and 24.9 ºC respectively, as determined for Porto
Alegre- RS by the local state climate station.

After exposure for different times, the Ag coupons were
rinsed with water and acetone and reduced potentiodynami-
cally in a standard three electrodes cell. The electrolyte was a

borate buffer of pH 10 (3.092 g L-1 H3BO3, 3.728 g L-1 KCl,
1.756 g L-1 NaOH), with addition of small quantities of Na2S
and purged previously for 8 h with N2. Good results were
obtained for sweep velocities in the negative direction of  0.1
mV s-1, starting from the Ag2S/Ag equilibrium potential. This
low sweeping rate was necessary to avoid the superposition
of the Ag2S reduction peak and the current related to the
hydrogen evolution reaction. The equilibrium potential
(Ag2S/Ag) was determined by a previous potentiodynamic
sulfidation and reduction of a blank Ag probe in the same
solution. The potentials were measured against an AgCl/Ag
reference electrode in 3.5 mol L-1 KCl, but are referred in the
text to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). After data ac-
quisition by computer, the mass of Ag2S per area was calcu-
lated from the charge density under the observed cathodic
peak, assuming Ag2S as the only tarnishing product and sub-
tracting the charge related to the background current density.

Results and Discussion

The voltammograms of the reduction of the exposed
Ag coupons are shown in Figures from 1 to 5. A sharp
reduction peak in the range between E(Ag2S/Ag) and –
200 mV more negative than this, i.e (from –350 to 550
mV) is always observed. The peak current density grows
with the exposure time, and it can be attributed undoubt-
edly to the reduction of the environmentally formed Ag2S.
No reduction peaks could be observed for unexposed Ag
samples. The background current density, measured on
unexposed samples, or estimated on exposed samples as
the current minimum between the Ag2S peak and the hy-
drogen evolution region, ranged between 0.2 and 1µA cm-2,
indicating the reduction of residual O2 dissolved in the elec-
trolyte. The coupons exposed at urban sites, i.e. Rodoviária,
Borges and Azenha, (Figures 1-3, respectively) showed less
pronounced reduction peaks, comparing to the ones ex-
posed at the oil refinery sites, REFAP1 and REFAP2 (Fig-
ures 4 and 5). For exposures at the less aggressive sites
Borges and Azenha, a clear identification of the reduction
peaks, at a potencial sweep rate of 0.1 mV s-1 was only pos-
sible for exposure times of ca. 10 days or longer. For the
more aggressive sites at the refinery, clear peaks were al-
ready identified after seven days of exposure.

Samples exposed for more then 20 days at the most
aggressive sites showed a second reduction peak (Figure
1, 4, 5). Its current density, subtracting the background
current, grows with time of exposure and with the
aggressivity of the atmosphere, and its current was allways
less than 3% of the main Ag2S peak. A second reduction
peak was also observed by the reduction of Ag samples tar-
nished strongly in aqueous sulfide solutions of 0.01mol L-1

1.1km apart in downtown Porto Alegre (Borges and
Rodoviária). Moreover, for a distance of 2.5 km from the
H2S-S02 source at the refinery, the atmosphere is still 4.25
times more aggressive than the most polluted site identi-
fied in downtown Porto Alegre, i.e. Rodoviária.

The comparison between the Ag tarnishing rate and the
mean SO2 concentration as determined by daily measure-
ments during the same period with the pararosaniline
method is presented in Figure 7. Using the data from the
two sites where only SO2 is expected (Rodoviária and
REFAP2) a ratio between the SO2 concentration and the
Ag tarnishing rate of 86±4g SO2 m-3/g Ag2S cm-2 day-1.
For the site REFAP1, where H2S is also present, a 4 times
smaller ratio is found. This is certainly due to a much higher
Ag tarnishing rate in H2S than in SO2. The coulometric

Na2S6,7. Only Ag2S could be detected in that case by X-
ray diffraction and thus, it is here assumed that only Ag2S
is formed atmospherically.

The mass of Ag2S formed vs. the exposure time is
shown for all sites in Figure 6. For the determination of
the respective tarnishing rates, a linear correlation was found
for the mass vs. time curves. The correlation coefficients were
normally higher then 0.93, with exception of the Borges site,
where R = 0.70 was measured. The aggressivity of the sites
and the respective Ag tarnishing rates, lie in the following
decrescent order: ?m/?tREFAP1 = 1.00, ?m/?tREFAP2 = 0.34,
?m/?tRodoviária = 0.08, ?m/?tAzenha = 0.06 and ?m/?tBorges
= 0.007µg Ag2S cm2 day-1. These results indicate that there
are differences of more than one order of magnitude in the
tarnishing rates and SO2 concentrations of sites lying only

method suffers from H2S  interference, and no quantita-
tive results can be expected in this case. Even so, it points
out that the site REFAP1 has a much more aggressive at-
mosphere than REFAP2. The pararosaniline method, cur-
rently in use, indicated a SO2 concentration 1.5 times higher
at the most distant point from the source than at a closer
one. This is probably due to the oxidation of H2S to SO2 in
the way between the source and REFAP2.

environmental chamber6, 7 containing 1 ppm H2S at T=
25ºC and the ones determined in this work at a mean rela-
tive humidity of 79.4% and temperature of 24.9°C is pre-
sented in Figure 8. Assuming that the tarnishing rate is
directly proportional to the H2S concentration, an equiva-
lent H2S concentration can be calculated. The values ob-

Conclusions

The coulometric method, based on the determination
of the tarnishing rate of Ag, can be used for the determina-
tion of SO2 concentrations in urban atmospheres. When
H2S is also present, as in industrial areas, an over estima-
tion of the SO2 concentration is expected, as the method
can not separate the effect of these two species. At least
one week is necessary till the presence of SO 2 can be de-
tected in urban sites. Due to its low cost and simplicity, the
method is more adequate for the local determination of
long term average concentrations of SO2.
