resumo 
 
 

As zonas de sapal são ambientes intertidais altamente produtivos, que servem 
como áreas de reprodução para muitas espécies com grande importância a 
nível comercial e económico. Devido à sua localização e às suas 
características físicas e biológicas, os sapais são particularmente susceptíveis 
à exposição a hidrocarbonetos com origem antropogénica. A contaminação 
dos sedimentos com hidrocarbonetos de petróleo é especialmente nociva para 
a vegetação de sapal, uma vez que os hidrocarbonetos aromáticos de baixo 
peso molecular podem afectar todos os estágios de desenvolvimento das 
plantas. No entanto, a utilização de plantas para biorremediação 
(fitorremediação) por remoção ou captura de compostos tóxicos, tem sido 
amplamente estudada. A fitorremediação é encarada como uma abordagem 
eficiente, económica e de baixo impacto ambiental para remoção de 
hidrocarbonetos aromáticos, que envolve a intervenção directa das plantas 
coadjuvada pela atividade das populações microbianas degradadoras na 
rizosfera (fitorremediação assistida por microrganismos). Nas rizosferas 
desenvolvem-se comunidades de microorganismos equipados com genes 
catabólicos relacionados com a degradação de hidrocarbonetos do petróleo 
(OH), com potencial na destoxificação do sedimento em torno destas raízes. 
Além disso, uma vez que algumas bactérias da rizosfera são também capazes 
de colonizar os tecidos das plantas (bactérias endofíticas), designadamente da 
raiz, as comunidades rizocompetentes degradadoras de OH são importantes 
para a degradação de OH ?in planta“ e contribuem para o seu papel como 
agentes de biorremediação.  
 
Este trabalho envolveu uma componente de campo e uma compoente 
laboratorial desenvolvida em microcosmos, com o objectivo de caracterizar 
interacções planta-bactéria relevantes na bioremediação de sapais 
contaminados com hidrocarbonetos e optimizar combinações planta-bactéria 
para uma melhoria da sobrevivência das plantas e aceleração da degradação 
dos poluentes. 

 
Na abordagem de campo, foram utilizadas ferramentas moleculares para 
avaliar como o tipo de espécie de planta e a contaminação com 
hidrocarbonetos afetam a composição das comunidades bacterianas do 
sedimento [sedimentos sem vegetação e sedimentos em torno das raízes 
(rizosfera) das espécies Halimione portulacoides e Sarcocornia perennis 
subsp. perennis] num estuário temperado (Ria de Aveiro, Portugal) 
cronicamente exposto à poluição por OH. 

 



 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
As sequências de genes de rRNA 16S obtidas neste estudo foram 
usadas para gerar metagenomas “in silico” e inferir tendências nos 
perfis funcionais das comunidades bacterianas em diferentes 
microhabitats. Posteriormente, uma combinação de métodos 
dependentes e independentes de cultivo foi utilizada para investigar o 
efeito de contaminação com OH sobre a estrutura e função da 
comunidade bacteriana endófitica das halófitas. Os sistemas radiculares 
de H. portulacoides e S. perennis subsp. perennis parecem exercer uma 
forte influência sobre a composição bacteriana e a análise metageomica 
“in silico” revelou um enriquecimento em genes envolvidos no processo 
de degradação de hidrocarbonetos aromáticos policíclicos (PAHs) na 
rizosfera de plantas halófitas. Na fracção cultivável de endofíticas 
degradadoras foram detetadas com particular frequência, espécies de 
Pseudomonas conhecidas como degradadoras de OH. As comunidades 
endofíticas revelaram um efeito local, relacionado com características 
do sedimento, tal como, o nível de contaminação de OH. 

 
A fim de determinar se a inoculação da H. portulacoides com bactérias
degradadoras de hidrocarbonetos podem mitigar os efeitos negativos da
exposição das plantas à contaminação por hidrocarbonetos, bem como 
avaliar as respostas em termos de estrutura e função das comunidades 
bacterianas associada à raíz de plantas (rizosfera e endosfera), foi 
desenvolvida uma experiência de microcosmos. A halófita Halimione 
portulacoides foi inoculada com uma estirpe de Pseudomonas sp., uma 
bactéria endofítica degradadora previamente isolada, e cultivada em 
sedimentos experimentalmente adicionados com 2-metilnaftaleno. 
Embora os resultados não tenham demonstrado um efeito significativo 
do contaminante sobre a condição da planta, a redução da 
concentração de 2-metilnaftaleno no sedimento no final da experiência 
sugere que H. portulacoides pode ser considerada como uma planta 
com potencial interesse para aplicação na fitorremediação de zonas de 
sapal contaminadas com hidrocarbonetos aromáticos. Apesar da
degradação do hidrocarboneto não ter sido acelerada pela inoculação 
das plantas com uma estirpe de Pseudomonas sp. degradadora, esta 
parece ter exercido um efeito positivo sobre a condição das plantas, 
independentemente da adição de 2-metilnaftaleno. Os efeitos da
inoculação sobre a estrutura da comunidade endófitica observada no 
final da experiência indicam que a estirpe pode ser uma colonizadora 
eficiente das raízes da H. portulacoides.  
Os resultados obtidos neste trabalho sugerem que a H. portulacoides 
tolera concentrações moderadas de 2-metilnaftaleno podendo assim ser 
considerada como um agente promissor para processos de 
fitoremediação em sapais contaminados com hidrocarbonetos de 
petróleo. As plantas suportam comunidades bacterianas endofíticas 
diversas e enriquecidas em fatores géneticos (genes) relacionados com 
degradação de hidrocarbonetos e as interações planta/bactéria podem 
assumir um importante papel nos processos de degradação.

abstract 
 
 

Salt marshes are highly productive intertidal habitats that serve as 
nursery grounds for many commercially and economically important 
species. Because of their location and physical and biological 
characteristics, salt marshes are considered to be particularly vulnerable 
to anthropogenic inputs of oil hydrocarbons. Sediment contamination 
with oil is especially dangerous for salt marsh vegetation, since low 
molecular weight aromatic hydrocarbons can affect plants at all stages of 
development. However, the use of vegetation for bioremediation 
(phytoremediation), by removal or sequestration of contaminants, has 
been intensively studied. Phytoremediation is an efficient, inexpensive 
and environmental friendly approach for the removal of aromatic 
hydrocarbons, through direct incorporation by the plant and by the 
intervention of degrading microbial populations in the rhizosphere 
(microbe-assisted phytoremediation). Rhizosphere microbial 
communities are enriched in important catabolic genotypes for 
degradation of oil hydrocarbons (OH) which may have a potential for 
detoxification of the sediment surrounding the roots. In addition, since 
rhizosphere bacterial populations may also internalize into plant tissues 
(endophytes), rhizocompetent AH degrading populations may be 
important for in planta AH degradation and detoxification.  
 
The present study involved field work and microcosms experiments 
aiming the characterization of relevant plant-microbe interactions in oil-
impacted salt marshes and the understanding of the effect of 
rhizosphere and endosphere bacteria in the role of salt marsh plants as 
potential phytoremediation agents. 

 
In the field approach, molecular tools were used to assess how plant 
species- and OH pollution affect sediment bacterial composition [bulk 
sediment and sediment surrounding the roots (rhizosphere) of Halimione 
portulacoides and Sarcocornia perennis subsp. perennis] in a temperate 
estuary (Ria de Aveiro, Portugal) chronically exposed to OH pollution. In 
addition, the 16S rRNA gene sequences retrieved in this study were 
used to generate in silico metagenomes and to evaluate the distribution 
of potential bacterial traits in different microhabitats. Moreover, a 
combination of culture-dependent and -independent approaches was 
used to investigate the effect of oil hydrocarbons contamination on the 
structure and function of endophytic bacterial communities of salt marsh 
plants.  
 
 
 

 
 



 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
Root systems of H. portulacoides and S. perennis subsp. perennis 
appear to be able to exert a strong influence on bacterial composition 
and in silico metagenome analysis showed enrichment of genes involved 
in the process of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) degradation in 
the rhizosphere of halophyte plants. The culturable fraction of endophytic 
degraders was essentially closely related to known OH-degrading 
Pseudomonas species and endophytic communities revealed site-
specific effects related to the level of OH contamination in the sediment.  
 

 
In order to determine the effects of oil contamination on plant condition 
and on the responses in terms of structure and function of the bacterial 
community associated with plant roots (rhizosphere, endosphere), a 
microcosms approach was set up. The salt marsh plant Halimione 
portulacoides was inoculated with a previous isolated Pseudomonas sp. 
endophytic degrader and the 2-methylnaphthalene was used as model 
PAH contaminant. The results showed that H. portulacoides health and 
growth were not affected by the contamination with the tested 
concentration. Moreover, the decrease of 2-methylnaphthalene at the 
end of experiment, can suggest that H. portulacoides can be considered 
as a potential plant for future uses in phytoremedition approaches of 
contaminated salt marsh. The acceleration of hydrocarbon degradation 
by inoculation of the plants with the hydrocarbon-degrading 
Pseudomonas sp. could not, however, be demonstrated, although the 
effects of inoculation on the structure of the endophytic community 
observed at the end of the experiment indicate that the strain may be an 
efficient colonizer of H. portulacoides roots. 
 
The results obtained in this work suggest that H. portulacoides tolerates 
moderate concentrations of 2-methylnaphthalene and can be regarded 
as a promising agent for phytoremedition approaches in salt marshes 
contaminated with oil hydrocarbons. Plant/microbe interactions may 
have an important role in the degradation process, as plants support a 
diverse endophytic bacterial community, enriched in genetic factors 
(genes and plasmids) for hydrocarbon degradation.

Thesis Outline 

Estuaries are particular environments which are subject to a wide variety of external 

sources of pressure. The anthropogenic pressure associated to human activities, namely 

navigation and industries commonly developing around estuarine areas, are often the 

cause for the rapid degradation of the estuarine environment. Hydrocarbons are a major 

contaminant in estuarine salt marsh areas and because of the ecological, commercial and 

economic importance of these wetlands, restoration approaches based on natural 

recovery processes are being intensively studied.  

Microbe-assisted phytoremediation is an inexpensive and environment-friendly 

approach based on the interactions between plants and their associated indigenous 

degrading microorganisms (rhizo- and endosphere). Although phytoremediation of a 

variety of contaminants in different environments has been reported in the last years, 

studies on phytoremediation of hydrocarbons in salt marsh sediments using halophytes 

salt marsh plants are strikingly scarce. So, studies focused on the 

rhizosphere/endosphere microorganisms, essential for salt marsh vegetation to resist 

environment contamination, could be of great value for the development of new 

approaches for the mitigation of oil contamination events.  

Similarly to what is known for terrestrial plants, the roots of salt marsh halophytes 

harbour communities of microorganisms that are enriched in important catabolic 

genotypes for oil hydrocarbon (OH) degradation which may have a potential for 

detoxification of the surrounding sediment (Geiselbrecht et al., 1996, Daane et al., 

2001, Watts et al., 2007). In addition, since rhizosphere bacterial populations may also 

internalize into plant tissues (endophytes), rhizocompetent OH degrading populations 

may be important for in planta OH degradation and detoxification. In this context, 

information on how bacterial populations colonizing salt marsh plants respond to oil 

contamination and how they can contribute to OH detoxification may significantly 

contribute to the understanding of plant-microbe interactions underlying 

phytoremediation approaches.

Chapter 2 reports on a thorough in-depth molecular characterization of bacterial 

communities in bulk sediments and rhizosphere microhabitats of salt marshes of Ria de 

Aveiro, a temperate estuary chronically exposed to oil hydrocarbon (OH) pollution.  

The barcoded pyrosequencing approach used in this study provided a comprehensive 

overview of the rhizosphere bacterial communities in salt marsh microhabitats [bulk 

sediment and sediment surrounding the roots (rhizosphere) of Halimione portulacoides 

and Sarcocornia perennis subsp. perennis] differentially affected by oil hydrocarbon 

(OH) pollution. In addition, the 16S rRNA gene sequences retrieved were used to 

generate in silico metagenomes and to evaluate the distribution of potential bacterial 

traits in different microhabitats. The results revealed that root systems of H. 

portulacoides and S. perennis subsp. perennis appear to be able to exert a strong 

influence on bacterial composition. The in silico metagenome analyses showed a 

possible higher number of genes involved in the process of PAH degradation in the 

rhizosphere of halophyte plants. These observations suggests that halophyte plant 

colonization can be an important driver of hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria community 

structure in salt marsh sediments, which can be exploited for in situ phytoremedition of 

oil hydrocarbon in salt marsh environments. This chapter is submitted for publication in

portulacoides and Sarcocornia perennis subsp. perennis). Culture-dependent and 

cultural-independent molecular approaches were used to investigate the effect of 

petroleum hydrocarbon contamination on the structure and function of endophytic 

bacterial communities of salt marsh plants. The results demonstrate that the level of

petroleum hydrocarbon contamination affects the composition of endophytic 

communities, and plant-species-specific “imprints” are confirmed by analyses of PAH 

(polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) degrading genes. These results provide a new insight 

into the plant-microbe interactions that may ultimately determine the efficiency of 

microbe-mediated phytoremediation approaches. This chapter was published in the

In Charter 4, a plant/sediment microcosm was made to assess if the inoculation of 

H. portulacoides with a hydrocarbon-degrading strain of Pseudomonas sp. would 

mitigate the negative effects of the exposure of the plants to hydrocarbon 

contamination. 2-methylnaphthalene was used as sediment contaminant source and the 

halophyte plant Halimione portulacoides was chosen as a representative salt marsh 

plant. A previously isolated PAH-degrading endophytic strain of Pseudomonas sp. 

(chapter 3) was used as plant inoculum. The effect of 2-methylnaphthalene 

contamination on plant condition was evaluated by measurement of the photosynthetic 

activity using a non-destructive technique, PAM fluorometry. The responses of 

microbial communities (rhizosphere and endosphere) in terms of structure [denaturing 

gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)] and function [polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon 

(PAH) dioxygenase genes] were assessed. The results indicate that the salt mash plant 

H. portulacoides can influence microbial communities by stimulating the development 

of hydrocarbon-degrading populations that may contribute to hydrocarbon removal and 

degradation in salt marsh sediments. The inoculation with an endophytic hydrocarbon-

degrading bacterium does not result in a significant effect on the overall hydrocarbon 

degradation potential of the salt marsh halophyte H. portulacoides. However, the effect 

of the inoculant on the structure of the indigenous endophytic community indicates that 

the strain may be a good plant colonizer. 

 

Chapter 5 integrates and discusses the main results of this work and attempts to 

extract the main findings, highlighting conclusions that can be incorporated into 

innovative and more efficient strategies of microbe-assisted phytoremediation of coastal 

areas.

Abstract: Estuaries are sinks for various anthropogenic contaminants, such as 

petroleum hydrocarbons, giving rise to significant environmental concern. The demand 

for organisms and processes capable of degrading pollutants in a clean, effective, and 

less expensive process is of great importance. Phytoremediation approaches involving 

plant/bacteria interactions have been explored as an alternative, and halophyte 

vegetation has potential for use in phytoremediation of hydrocarbon contamination. 

Studies with plant species potentially suitable for microbe-assisted phytoremediation are 

widely represented in the scientific literature. However, the in-depth understanding of 

the biological processes associated with the re-introduction of indigenous bacteria and 

plants and their performance in the degradation of hydrocarbons is still the limiting step 

for the application of these bioremediation solutions in a field context. 

The intent of the present review is to summarize the sources and effects of 

hydrocarbon contamination in estuarine environments, the strategies currently available 

for bioremediation (potential and limitations), and the perspectives of the use of 

halophyte plants in microbe-assisted phytoremediation approaches.

Introduction 

Salt marshes are complex coastal environments usually situated within estuarine 

systems. They represent dynamic habitats, developing along the coast line and inside 

estuaries and are characterized by high concentration of soluble salts (prevailing NaCl), 

relatively low diversity of species and high biomass productivity (Vernberg, 1993, 

Baptista et al., 2011). Estuarine salt marshes are among the most productive ecosystems 

on Earth (Costanza et al., 1997) promoting plant and microbial activity (Cunha et al., 



Introduction 

13 

 

2005, Santos et al., 2007, Oliveira et al., 2010), representing a preferential habitat for 

many organisms (fish, bird and other wildlife) (Mitsch &amp;amp; Gosselink, 2000, Watts et al., 

2006) and providing important ecosystem services (Barbier et al., 2011). Salt marshes 

are highly dynamic areas, influenced by the joint action of water, sediment, and 

vegetation, providing a buffer zone between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in urban 

and industrial areas. They contribute to flood control and erosion prevention and may 

act as protective filters and final repositories for runoff pollutants, pathogens and 

nutrients (Vernberg, 1993, Valiela et al., 2004, Barbier et al., 2011). 

Salt marshes are sinks for various pollutants, receiving important anthropogenic 

inputs from urban areas, industries and agricultural compounds, namely polycyclic 

aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), 

dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), 

hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) and hexachlorodimethanonaphthalene (Dieldrin), as 

summarized in Table 1.1. Due to their ecological importance, the cleanup and recovery 

of these ecosystems is an issue of public concern. 

Petroleum hydrocarbons (PHs) represent one of the most common groups of 

persistent organic pollutants in coastal and estuarine systems (Mucha et al., 2011). They 

are continuously released, persistent in the environment, toxic to many organisms, and 

hazardous to human health (Todd et al., 1999). This class of contaminants may be 

originated from industrial release products or from accidental spills (Todd et al., 1999). 

Numerous studies indicate that salt marsh sediments are capable of retaining PHs and 

that the stimulation of microbial activity in the rhizosphere of plants can accelerate their 

biodegradation (Carman et al., 1996, Daane et al., 2001). Phytoremediation is one of the 

processes of hydrocarbon bioremediation, which has been intensively studied in the last 

decade. The continuous release of hydrocarbons and their degradation products caused 

by anthropogenic activities around estuary areas leads to the necessity for efficient, 

inexpensive, and environmental friendly processes of hydrocarbon decontamination, 

such as phytoremediation. In that perspective, the interactions between halophytes, 

plants capable of growing in salt marshes, and their root-associated bacteria may play a 

relevant role in the remediation of contaminated areas. Cultivation-dependent and -

independent approaches together with molecular approaches have been used to 

characterize plant hydrocarbonclastic bacteria partnerships in the perspective of their

exploitation for microbe-assisted phytoremediation. However, particular features of salt 

marsh ecosystems may impose difficulties in the process of implementation of these 

strategies in the field, and considerable research effort has been directed to a deeper 

understanding of halophyte-microbe interactions in oil-polluted environments. 

The purpose of this paper is to summarize recent knowledge on the degradation of 

petroleum hydrocarbons in salt marsh sediments and to critically discuss the potential 

and limitations of microbe-assisted phytoremediation approaches for the recovery of oil-

impacted ecosystems.

Hydrocarbons 

Petroleum hydrocarbons (PHs) are common environmental contaminants and 

represent a serious problem in many parts of the world (Gioia et al., 2006, Iqbal et al., 

2007, Labbe et al., 2007, Vazquez et al., 2009, Yergeau et al., 2009, Santos et al., 

2011), particularly in coastal and estuarine systems which may become seriously 

affected (Castle et al., 2006, Gomes et al., 2008, Beazley et al., 2012). They are the 

principal components in a range of commercial products (e.g., gasoline, fuel oils, 



Introduction 

16 

 

lubricating oils, solvents, mineral spirits, mineral oils, and crude oil). Petroleum 

products are a complex mixture of hundreds of hydrocarbon compounds, including 

various amounts of aliphatic and aromatic molecules. They enter and spread through the 

environment in many different ways (Todd et al., 1999). Certain petroleum 

hydrocarbons are directly released in the water column, forming surface films while 

others tend to accumulate in the sediment.  

PAHs are widespread in air, soil, sediment, surface water, groundwater, and runoff 

and are also found to accumulate in plants and aquatic organisms (Simpson et al., 1996, 

Peng et al., 2008, Haritash &amp;amp; Kaushik, 2009). In estuarine environments, polycyclic 

aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are of great concern due to their potential for 

bioaccumulation, persistence, transport, toxicity, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity 

(Cerniglia, 1992, Samanta et al., 2002, Bamforth &amp;amp; Singleton, 2005, Haritash &amp;amp; 

Kaushik, 2009). These compounds are introduced into estuarine environments from 

different sources and by a variety of processes (Fig. 1.1). Although PAHs are ubiquitous 

in the environment (fossil fuels, brush fires, volcanoes, and burning natural vegetation), 

anthropogenic activities, such as petroleum refining and transport activities dependent 

on the combustion of fossil fuels, are the major contributors to their release in the 

environment (Freeman &amp;amp; Cattell, 1990, Cerniglia, 1992, Samanta et al., 2002, Bamforth 

&amp;amp; Singleton, 2005).  

PAHs are classified as low molecular weight (LMW) and high molecular weight 

(HMW) according to the number and type of rings they have in the structure (Bayoumi, 

2009). Based on their abundance and toxicity, 16 PAHs have been included in the list of 

priority pollutants of the US Soil Protection Agency (Liu et al., 2001). Because of their 

high hydrophobicity and low lability, the process of PAHs remediation, especially in 

soils and sediments, is generally slow and expensive. The fate of PAHs in the 

environment depends on abiotic and biotic processes such as stabilization, landfarming 

(stimulation of indigenous microorganisms in the soil by providing nutrients, water, and 

oxygen), steam and thermal heating, chemical oxidation, bioremediation 

(bioaugmentation and biostimulation), and phytoremediation, which have been applied 

to the restoration of groundwater and soils/sediments (Bamforth &amp;amp; Singleton, 2005, 

Wick et al., 2011).

ecosystems. 

 

Phytoremediation of hydrocarbons 

Halophytes are defined as plants capable of completing their life cycle in salt 

concentrations around 0.200M NaCl or even higher (Flowers &amp;amp; Colmer, 2008). 

Moreover, many of these plants inhabit environments subject to constant flooding (e.g 

coastal mangroves and salt marshes) (Colmer &amp;amp; Flowers, 2008). Because estuaries and 

coastal habitats are highly exposed to environmental contamination, many studies 

addressed the use of halophytes in the phytoremediation of many pollutants (e.g., heavy 

metals, xenobiotics, and PHs) (Lin &amp;amp; Mendelssohn, 2009, Couto et al., 2011, Liu et al., 

2011, Marques et al., 2011, Curado et al., 2014). The physiological mechanisms that 

these plants use to tolerate salts are partly analogous to those involved in heavy metal 

resistance. Therefore, halophyte plants can accumulate metals, being therefore regarded 

as promising candidates for the removal or stabilization of heavy metals in polluted 

soils (Manousaki &amp;amp; Kalogerakis, 2011). 

According to the fate of the contaminant or to the mechanism by which plants 

remediate contamination, these approaches are referred to as phytoextraction, 

rhizofiltration, phytostabilization, phytovolatilization, phytodegradation or 



Introduction 

18 

 

rhizodegradation (EPA, 2000, Trapp &amp;amp; Karlson, 2001). Phytoextraction refers to the 

uptake, translocation, and accumulation of contaminants in the soil by plant roots into 

above-ground components of the plants. This technique involves the introduction of 

plants referred to as hyper-accumulators in polluted sites that after grown, are harvested. 

So, phytoextraction involves the repeated cropping of plants in contaminated soil until 

contaminant concentration decreases to acceptable levels. After harvesting, 

contaminated biomass needs treatments prior to disposal that can pass to secure 

landfills, incineration, or more recently thermo-chemical conversion processes 

(combustion, gasification, and pyrolysis) (Garbisu &amp;amp; Alkorta, 2001). Rhizofiltration 

involves the absorption or adsorption of contaminants through roots or other plant parts 

(EPA, 2000, Trapp &amp;amp; Karlson, 2001). In phytostabilization, plants reduce the 

bioavailability of contaminants immobilizing them in soil/sediment, reducing the 

mobility of contaminants and preventing migration to water or air (EPA, 2000, Trapp &amp;amp; 

Karlson, 2001). For the removal of low molecular weight compounds from soil, 

phytovolatilization is used. In this technique, plants volatilize contaminants that are 

biologically converting to gaseous species and releasing them through leaves via 

evapotranspiration processes (EPA, 2000, Trapp &amp;amp; Karlson, 2001). Organic 

contaminants such as petroleum, PAHs, BTEX, TNT, chlorinated solvents, and 

pesticides are degraded only by plants (phytodegradation) or by microorganisms and 

plants, in a process denominated as rhizodegradation (Trapp &amp;amp; Karlson, 2001). 

Comparatively with application for the sequestration or removal of metals, studies 

involving halophytes for phytoremediation of PHs are still rather scarce. However, 

species of Spartina, Salicornia, Juncus, Halonemum, Halimione, and Scirpus have been 

tested for the remediation of hydrocarbons in wetlands with encouraging results (Table 

2). The ability for PAH bioaccumulation was described for Salicornia fragilis shoots by 

a process of soil-to-plant transference that is dependent of exposure duration and 

pollution degree. High molecular weight PAHs were detected in aerial parts of the plant 

(Meudec et al., 2006). In a study conducted in greenhouse conditions, the use of Juncus 

roemerianus transplanted to salt marsh sediment contaminated with different diesel oil 

dosages was tested. The results revealed the reduction of PHs in J. roemerianus 

treatments, in relation to control sediments, suggesting that these plants may 

simultaneously contribute to the restoration and remediation of diesel-contaminated

wetlands. Phytoremediation by J. roemerianus was even more effective for PAHs than 

for n-alkanes (Lin &amp;amp; Mendelssohn, 2009). In an outdoor laboratory experiment 

(microcosm-scale), the potential of the salt marsh plants Halimione portulacoides, 

Scirpus maritimus, and Juncus maritimus for the remediation of soil contaminated with 

refinery waste was tested. Two situations were tested: (i) the use of each individual 

plant species or the use of an association of two plants (S. maritimus and J. maritimus) 

and (ii) soil with old contamination (crude oil) or a mixture of the old and recent 

(turbine oil) contamination. Combined transplants of S. maritimus and H. portulacoides 

plants were efficient in removing not only all the recent and old contamination, and the 

process was faster and more efficient than natural attenuation (Couto et al., 2011).

Despite existing evidence that the halophytes can be used successfully for the 

phytoremediation of estuarine areas, such as oil- or diesel-polluted sites (Table 1.2), 

there are still some limitations to the extensive use of this bioremediation approach. The 

efficiency of halophytes, as phytoremediation agents, depends on the plant species. For 

example, a comparative study of the efficiency of the salt-marsh species H. 

portulacoides, S. maritimus, and J. maritimus for remediation of PHs revealed that the 

plant species is determinant in the rate of hydrocarbon clearance and, more importantly,

that different associations between these plants can interfere with or even inhibit the 

process (Couto et al., 2011). 

 

Microbial hydrocarbon degradation 

Contrasting with the prospective character of the use halophytes, the use of 

microorganisms for the clearance of hydrocarbons in the environment has long been 

regarded with interest. Through microbial activity, hydrocarbons are converted into 

carbon dioxide, water, and living biomass (Genouw et al., 1994). A diversity of 

bacteria, fungi and algae has been characterized as to their capacity to degrade PAHs 

(Haritash &amp;amp; Kaushik, 2009). 

Microorganisms have been found to degrade PAHs via different catabolic pathways, 

such as anaerobic or aerobic metabolism, or co-metabolism which is important for the 

degradation of mixtures of PAHs and high molecular weight PAHs (Habe &amp;amp; Omori, 

2003, Zhong et al., 2007, Peng et al., 2008). The initial step in aerobic metabolism of 

PAHs usually occurs via the incorporation of oxygen into aromatic rings followed by 

the systematic breakdown of the compound to PAHs metabolites and/or carbon dioxide. 

Anaerobic metabolism occurs via hydrogenation of aromatic rings (Bamforth &amp;amp; 

Singleton, 2005, Zhong et al., 2007). In co-metabolism, the range and extent of high 

molecular weight PAH degradation is influenced by an important interaction that 

transforms the non-growth substrate (PAHs) in the presence of growth substrates 

(Zhong et al., 2007).  

Physicochemical factors, such as soil type and structure, pH, temperature, electron 

acceptors, and nutrients, will affect microbial activity and determine the persistence of 

hydrocarbons (such PAHs) in polluted environments (Table 1.3). In estuarine areas, 

such as salt marshes, salinity fluctuations represent one of major challenges for 

hydrocarbon degradation that may even compromise the overall success of the process. 

There is an inverse relation between salinity and hydrocarbon solubility, with the 

consequent inhibitory effect of salinity on hydrocarbon bioremediation (Mille et al., 

1991). However, successful hydrocarbon degradation has been reported over a wide 

range of salinity values. A consortium of bacteria isolated from oil-contaminated 

sediments demonstrated the highest rate of hydrocarbon degradation with a salinity of 

0.4M NaCl and the degradation was attenuated below and above this limit (Bertrand et 



Introduction 

21 

 

al., 1993). In a study with two bacterial consortia isolated from crude oil and mangrove 

sediments, the highest rate of degradation of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons 

occurred in a salinity range between 0-0.171M, and decreased with increasing salinity 

(Beeson et al., 2002).  

 

Table 1.3 Factors affecting the biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons. 

 

Riis et al., (2003) reported diesel fuel degradation by microbial communities from 

saline soils in Patagonia up to a salinity of 2.997M. Although hydrocarbon 

contamination is still persistent and recalcitrant in its nature, the fact that microbes from 

vegetated saline sediments can still actively degrade hydrocarbons in the presence of 

variable and relatively high concentrations of salt opens promising perspectives for 

microbe-assisted phytoremediation in estuarine areas.

Microbe-assisted phytoremediation 

The microbial communities associated with plants and plant-microbe interactions 

established between them, have a significant role in the physiology and health of the 

plant, exerted through inhibition of phytopathogens (e.g., antibiotic and siderophore 

production or nutrient competition), release of growth-promoting molecules, 

enhancement of nutrient availability, promotion of detoxification (e.g., sequestration, 

volatilization, and degradation of pollutants), and improvement of stress tolerance by 

induction of systematic acquired host resistance (Fig. 1.2).

and endosphere bacteria. 

 

The use of plants and their associated microorganisms for the removal of 

contaminants from the environment is based on the increase of microbial population 

numbers in the rhizosphere and/or endosphere and on the stimulation of their metabolic

activity (Kuiper et al., 2004). So, microbe-assisted phytoremediation represents a 

powerful emerging approach to sequester, degrade, transform, assimilate, metabolize, or 

detoxify contaminants from soil, sediment, or groundwater (EPA, 2000, Moreira et al., 

2006). 

Numerous bacteria found in association with plants are capable of degrading 

hydrocarbons, namely PAHs, suggesting that indigenous rhizobacteria and endophytic 

bacteria may have potential for bioremediation of polluted sites (Segura et al., 2009). In 

the particular case of estuarine environments, a diversity of hydrocarbon-degrading 

microbial populations has been found in association with the rhizosphere of salt marsh 

plants, where they actively contribute to hydrocarbon removal and degradation (Daane 

et al., 2001, Ribeiro et al., 2011). The use of rhizosphere and phyllosphere (aerial 

portion of plants) of the halophyte Halonemum strobilaceum was also proposed for 

phytoremediation of oil-polluted hypersaline environments, via rhizosphere technology 

(Al-Mailem et al., 2010). 

Rhizodegradation appears to be a particularly interesting phytoremediation process 

for the removal and/or degradation of organic contaminants, such as PH. The 

rhizosphere is defined as the zone directly influenced by the plant root system. Plants 

provide root exudates rich in carbon sources, nutrients, enzymes, and sometimes 

oxygen, creating a favorable environment in which microbial activity is stimulated 

(Cunningham et al., 1996, Frick et al., 1999, Kuiper et al., 2004). However, microbial 

interactions with plants are not limited to the rhizosphere; rather, they extend to the 

interior of the plant (Lodewyckx et al., 2002). Endophytic-assisted phytoremediation, 

involving microorganisms that are capable of living within various plant tissues (roots, 

stems, and leaves), has been reported in recent years as successful in the degradation of 

some pollutants, such as explosives, herbicides, and hydrocarbons (Germaine et al., 

2006, Phillips et al., 2008, Segura et al., 2009). In fact remediation of hydrocarbons by 

combined use of plants and rhizobacteria and/or endophytic bacteria have been widely 

described (Table 1.4).  

Genetically engineered endophyte microorganisms enhance the overall health of 

theirs hosts (Barac et al., 2004) and may indirectly improve biodegradation of 

contaminants in the rhizosphere. Experiments in which pea plants were inoculated with 

the naphthalene degrader Pseudomonas putida VM1441 (pNAH7) and exposed to 



Introduction

naphthalene contamination revealed that naphthalene degradation rate (~ 40%), seed 

germination, and plant transpiration were enhanced in inoculated plants than in non-

inoculated controls. Moreover, inoculation resulted in an overall protection of the host 

plants from the phytotoxic effects of naphthalene (Germaine et al., 2009). A study 

carried out in a mangrove showed that nursery conditions and early microbial 

colonization patterns had long-term effect on the rhizosphere of transplanted 

mangroves. This phenomenon may have potential application for introducing new 

rhizocompetent bacteria carrying genes or plasmids to improve plant growth or 

bioremediation (rhizoengineering) (Gomes et al., 2010b). 

Several studies reported the enhancement of PH degradation in association with the 

presence of bacteria carrying PH degradation genes (Table 1.4). A high diversity of 

hydrocarbon degradative genes, such as alkane monooxygenase (alkB), naphthalene 

dioxygenase (ndoB), phenanthrene dioxygenase (phnAc), and cytochrome P450 alkane 

hydroxylase, has been detected in plant microhabitats (rhizosphere and endosphere) 

(Phillips et al., 2006, Phillips et al., 2008, Germaine et al., 2009). In fact, the 

monitoring of gene abundance and expression during phytoremedition of contaminated 

sites can give indications about the persistence and functional activity of inoculated 

microorganisms (Juhanson et al., 2009). A study conducted at a long-term 

phytoremediation field site revealed that both rhizosphere and endophytic communities 

showed substantial inter-species variation in hydrocarbon degradation potential and 

activity levels, with an increase in catabolic genotypes in specific plant treatments 

(Phillips et al., 2008). 

Recently, it was suggested that for certain phytoremedition approaches, it may be 

essential or at least important, that bacteria also act as plant growth promoters, in 

addition to their pollutant-degrading activity. In experiments with Italian ryegrass, plant 

biomass production and alkane degradation were significantly enhanced by inoculation 

with bacterial strains expressing hydrocarbon-degrading genes (e.g. alkB) as well as 

plant-promoting activity (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase 

activity) (Yousaf et al., 2011, Afzal et al., 2012). So, the combined use of plant and 

bacteria can be exploited to relieve plant stress, and enhance bioremediation of PH-

contaminated sites.

Current limitations to the microbe-assisted phytoremediation of hydrocarbons 

Microbe-assisted phytoremediation has been broadly tested for the degradation or 

sequestration of hydrocarbons in estuarine environments. Despite being considered an 

inexpensive, sustainable and environment-friendly technique, phytoremediation is not 

exempt of controversy, and the success of this type of approach is significantly affected 

by environmental factors and particular features of each ecosystem. One major 

limitation is time, considering that successful phytoremediation is a process that goes on 

for long periods which is partially determined by the slow growth and phenological (or 

life) cycle of plants, the limited depth of the root system, and the fact that many plant 

species are sensitive to the contaminants that are being remediated (Kuiper et al., 2004, 

Pilon-Smits, 2005).  

The bioavailability of petroleum hydrocarbons is another important factor in the 

success of bioremediation, and it can be significantly affected by soil type and organic 

matter content. Water content (affects the availability of oxygen required for aerobic 

respiration), temperature, and nutrient availability (influences the rate and extent of 

biodegradation) are relevant determinants of the efficiency of the PHs bioremediation 

process (Frick et al., 1999). The competition for nutrients between plants and 

microorganisms can be a restriction to the remediation efficiency. A reduction in 

microbial abundance and an attenuation of degradation of higher molecular weight 

PAHs in sediments was observed in H. portulacoides banks and this effect was 

associated to nutrient limitation (Mucha et al., 2011). Therefore, fertilization may be 

required for optimal rhizoremediation of hydrocarbons. 

Although a wide range of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria have been isolated from 

contaminated environments, little is known about the stability of the association with 

salt marsh plants and the success of the re-introduction of plant-bacteria systems for 

potential phytoremediation processes in saline sediments. The fact that these biotopes 

are colonized in a particular type of plants, well adapted to flooding and to salinity 

fluctuations, reinforces the need to incorporate basic knowledge on their interaction 

with sediment microbes in the design of phytoremediation approaches. The ability to 

monitor the survival and efficiency of hydrocarbon degradation of inoculated strains is 

essential for the in-depth understanding of the network of relations established between 

sediments, plants, and microbes that underlies microbe-assisted phytoremediation.

Monitoring plant-bacteria interactions involved in microbe-assisted 

phytoremediation  

The efficient colonization of plants by microbial pollutant degraders is an essential 

contribution for plant survival and hydrocarbon degradation (Andria et al., 2009, Afzal 

et al., 2012). Despite the lack of knowledge on inoculation and bacterial colonization of 

halophyte plants, the monitoring of plant-bacteria interaction in hydrocarbon-polluted 

sites has been addressed by different approaches. In bioremediation, the use of culture-

dependent methodologies, such as dilution plating on agar plates containing antibiotics, 

the most-probable-number (MPN) method, and direct counting, are insufficient for an 

accurate and sensitive monitoring of the inoculation and colonization processes 

(Schneegurt &amp;amp; Kulpa, 1998). Molecular techniques including polymerase chain reaction 

(PCR), real-time PCR, and DNA hybridization, reporter genes or genetically marker 

microorganisms (biomarkers) have been used to check on microbe survival, efficiency 

of colonization, and activity (Germaine et al., 2004, Ryan et al., 2008, Andria et al., 

2009, Juhanson et al., 2009, Segura et al., 2009). For example, antibiotic resistance and 

green fluorescent protein (gfp) genes have been proposed as useful tools for monitoring 

the colonization of bacterial endophytes, inoculated in poplar trees (Afzal et al., 2013). 

Endophyte colonization has also been monitored with the use of gusA marker gene 

encoding the enzyme ?-glucuronidase. A gus-marked strain, Burkholderia phytofirmans 

PsJN, was inoculated in seeds of ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.). B. phytofirmans 

PsJN:gusA10 revealed that this bacterium has the ability to colonize the rhizosphere and 

endosphere of ryegrass vegetation in a diesel-contaminated soil and generally improved 

plant biomass production and hydrocarbon degradation (Afzal et al., 2013). Other study, 

using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), showed that Enterobacter 

ludwigii strains were able to efficiently colonize the rhizosphere and endosphere of 

Italian ryegrass, birdsfoot trefoil, and alfalfa. Moreover, E. ludwigii strains contain a 

cytochrome P450-type alkane hydroxylase (CYP153), and the quantification and 

expression of these genes by real-time PCR indicate an active role in hydrocarbon 

degradation, in the rhizosphere and endosphere of all three plant species (Yousaf et al., 

2011). Quantitative PCR has emerged as a useful and rapid tool for monitoring 

catabolic genes during bioremediation processes. As an example, this technique was 

used for the assessment of hydrocarbon degradation activity of Nocardia sp. H17-1

during remediation of crude-contaminated soil (Baek et al., 2009). A similar approach 

was used to demonstrate that hydrocarbon degradation was associated with functional 

changes in microbial communities, in which high copy numbers of catechol 2,3- 

dioxygenase and naphthalene dioxygenase correlated with PAH mineralization (Phillips 

et al., 2012). 

Metagenomic pyrosequencing, which allows the recovery of a very large number of 

microbial sequences directly from environmental samples, has more recently emerged 

as a powerful technique to follow plant-microbe interactions during the bioremediation 

process (Roesch et al., 2007, Wang et al., 2012). The sequences obtained can be 

compared with reference libraries, and then taxa present in an environmental sample can 

be identified with high confidence. The massive data sets generated provide information 

that can be used for a variety of applications, such as the comprehensive understanding 

of within-site and between-site variability of microbial communities and the impact of 

this variability in ecosystem-scale processes in salt marshes (Bowen et al., 2012). The 

pyrosequencing analysis of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene fragments 

of different Phragmites australis rhizospheres revealed a trend in the variation of 

bacterial community structure during wetland degradation and identified sulfur and 

sulfate-reducing bacteria, nitrifying and nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and methane-oxidizing 

bacteria as crucial in the protection and ecological restoration of wetlands (Zhang et al., 

2013). Recent bioremediation studies have used pyrosequencing analysis of bacterial 

16S rRNA genes to describe microbial community dynamics in hydrocarbon-

contaminated sites thus providing basis for the development of strategies for monitoring 

remediation processes (Singleton et al., 2011, Sutton et al., 2013). For example, the 

relative abundance of Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, and Euryarchaeota was directly 

correlated with the presence of diesel (Sutton et al., 2013).  

 

Future perspectives 

Despite numerous limitations, phytoremediation and particularly, microbe-assisted 

phytoremediation have undeniable advantages, and research must now specifically 

address the aspects that can allow the scaling up from laboratory to the field for the 

practical implementation of this approach. 



Introduction 

29 

 

Each salt marsh displays particularly biological, chemical, and physical 

characteristics that will ultimately determine the success of phytoremediation. 

Therefore, field studies, combined with laboratory approaches, are required for the 

understanding of the interplay of biological and chemical processes involved in 

microbe-assisted phytoremediation of oil-impacted sites. 

Considering that plant-microbe interactions play a key role in the process of 

environment and in planta detoxification, (a) the identification of autochthonous 

hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial populations associated to salt marsh plants 

(rhizosphere and aboveground plant tissues), (b) the identification of degradative 

plasmids, and (c) the selection of petroleum-resistant plants are key issues for the 

success of environmental restoration. The detection of genes related to hydrocarbon 

degradation pathways in halophyte plants can be useful to screen for lineages of plants 

that can be used in efficient phytoremediation protocols. Moreover, these genes can be 

used for the genetic engineered design of plants for novel phytoremediation approaches 

for hydrocarbon-polluted wetlands and soils (RamanaRao et al., 2012). Recent plant 

biotechnology approaches involving the introduction of specialized bacterial 

endophytes in plants or the design of genetically engineered plants containing 

interesting bacterial genes (Barac et al., 2004, Taghavi et al., 2005) create new 

perspectives for future phytoremedition protocols. Endophytic hydrocarbon-degrading 

bacteria may have a growth-promoting effect on the wild salt marsh halophyte plants 

and may be regarded as promising when field microbe-assisted phytoremediation 

approaches are envisaged.

Abstract: In this study, two molecular techniques [denaturing gradient gel 

electrophoresis (DGGE) and barcoded pyrosequencing] were used to evaluate the 

composition of bacterial communities in salt marsh microhabitats [bulk sediment and 

sediment surrounding the roots (rhizosphere) of Halimione portulacoides and 

Sarcocornia perennis subsp. perennis] that have been differentially affected by oil 

hydrocarbon (OH) pollution. Both DGGE and pyrosequencing revealed that bacterial 

composition is structured by microhabitat. Rhizosphere sediment from both plant 

species revealed enrichment of OTUs (operational taxonomic units) closely related to 

Acidimicrobiales, Myxococcales and Sphingomonadales. The in silico metagenome 

analyses suggest that homologue genes related to OH degradation appeared to be more 

frequent in both plant rhizospheres than in bulk sediment.  

In summary, this study suggests that halophyte plant colonization is an important 

driver of hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial community composition in estuarine 

environments, which can be exploited for in situ phytoremediation of OH in salt marsh 

environments.

Introduction 

Estuarine salt marshes are ecologically, commercially and economically important 

(Barbier et al., 2011). Due to their high productivity and location, they provide valuable 

ecosystem services (Coulon et al., 2012). However, being located between aquatic and 

terrestrial systems, they are vulnerable to perturbations from both environments (Bowen 

et al., 2012). Although salt marsh conservation is generally believed to be important for 



Bacterial communities in salt marshes oil exposed 

32 

 

the maintenance of healthy coastal ecosystems, these ecosystems have been 

systematically destroyed due to urban and industrial growth (Reboreda &amp;amp; Caçador, 

2007; Martins et al., 2008). Anthropogenic inputs of hydrocarbons are one of the major 

threats to salt marsh vegetation (Carman et al., 1996; Watts et al., 2006; Martins et al., 

2008). Low molecular weight aromatic hydrocarbons are particularly deleterious and 

can affect plants during all growth stages (Gao &amp;amp; Zhu, 2004; Watts et al., 2006; Watts 

et al., 2008). 

Microbial degradation is the primary route for the breakdown of hydrocarbons; 

degradation depends largely on composition and adaptive response to the presence of 

hydrocarbons (Leahy &amp;amp; Colwell, 1990). The use of plants and their associated 

microorganisms to promote bioremediation of degraded areas has been previously 

demonstrated in several studies (Siciliano &amp;amp; Germida, 1998; Daane et al., 2001). 

Rhizosphere-associated microorganisms are currently regarded as pivotal in combating 

environmental contamination and there is growing interest in the development of new 

approaches for the mitigation of hydrocarbon contamination of coastal ecosystems 

(Daane et al., 2001; Ribeiro e et al., 2011). Although information exists regarding the 

microbial processes involved in hydrocarbon degradation (McGenity, 2014) many 

others questions, such as the organization of microbial community structure or even the 

mechanism involved in their adaptation to the presence of oil contamination, need 

additional data to implement appropriate bioremediation strategies. Molecular 

techniques provide an opportunity to understand microbial diversity and functionality in 

oil contaminated sites. 

In a previous study, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to determine 

the relationship between different halophyte species and the relative abundance of 

prokaryote groups in salt marsh sediments and a metabolomics analysis revealed that 

volatile compounds released through the roots may underlie plant-bacteria associations 

in intertidal salt marshes (Oliveira et al., 2012). Here we provide, for the first time, a 

thorough in-depth molecular characterization of bacterial communities in bulk sediment 

and rhizosphere microhabitats in a temperate estuary (Ria de Aveiro, Portugal) 

chronically exposed to oil hydrocarbon (OH) pollution. DGGE and barcoded 

pyrosequencing (16S rRNA gene amplicons) were used to assess how plant species- and 

OH pollution affect sediment bacterial composition in sampling sites exposed to

retrieved in this study were used to generate in silico metagenomes and evaluate the 

distribution of potential bacterial traits in different microhabitats. 

 

Material and methods 

Sampling sites and sample processing 

Samples were obtained from four sites of the Ria de Aveiro estuarine system 

(Aveiro, Portugal). The Ria de Aveiro is a shallow estuary, sometimes considered a 

coastal lagoon, on the northwest cost of Portugal (40.7° N, 8.7° W). It is formed by a 

complex network of channels and extensive intertidal zones (Dias et al., 1999). Plant 

and sediment samples were taken during low tide, from four different sites (site A, 

40?35´52.64´´N, 8?45´.0071´´W; site B, 40?38´27.42´´N, 8?44´15.42´´W; site C, 

40?37´32.18´´N, 8?44´09.12´´W; site D, 40?37´18.90´´N, 8?39´46.28´´W (Fig. 2.1). In 

each site, four composite samples of 

each plant species (Halimione 

portulacoides and Sarcocornia 

perennis subsp. perennis) were 

collected and stored separately in 

plastic bags for transportation. In the 

laboratory, bulk sediment and 

rhizosphere samples were separated. 

Roots were manually shaken to remove 

loosely bound sediment, which was 

discarded. The rhizosphere was 

extracted by suspending roots with 

tightly attached sediment particles in 

sterile deionized water. The mixture 

was kept in a rotary shaker for 30 

min. and the resulting sediment slurry 

was decanted into a sterile Falcon tube and centrifuged (5 min., 7600 rpm, 4ºC). The 

supernatant was rejected (Phillips et al., 2008). Bulk sediment and rhizosphere extracts 



Bacterial communities in salt marshes oil exposed 

34 

 

were stored at -20ºC for subsequent molecular analysis. For salt marsh physicochemical 

characterization, three sediment subsamples were collected in each sampling site. 

 

Sediments properties  

For pH determination (Orion Model 290A), bulk sediment was suspended in water 

[1:5 (w/v)] (Faoun, 1984). Sub-samples were analyzed for organic matter content, as 

percentage of weight loss by ignition (8 h at 450 °C), moisture (expressed in percentage 

of water per quantity of fresh sediment weight) and sediment grain size (estimated from 

wet and dry sieving), following Quintino et al. (1989).  

 

Hydrocarbon analysis  

Bulk sediment was analyzed for aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons after a Soxhlet 

extraction followed by a gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, 

conducted for three sediment sub-samples of each site that were previously 

homogenized and freeze-dried. For the standardization of the procedure, the internal 

calibration method was used in the quantification of 16 US EPA priority PAHs. 

Deuterated PAH surrogate standards were added to sediment samples in order to 

calculate the recovery efficiency during sample extraction, cleanup and analysis. For the 

aliphatic hydrocarbons fraction, two internal standards were used: undecane (C11H24) 

and tetracosane (C24H50). 

Five grams of dried, homogenized sediment were extracted for 24 h in a Soxhlet 

apparatus with 150 mL of dichloromethane. Prior to extraction, the sediment was spiked 

with 25 µ l (2 µ g ml-1) deuterated surrogate standards (naphthalene-d8, acenapthlene-d10, 

phenanthrene-d10, chrysene-d12 and perylene-d12). Activated copper (Schubert, 1998) 

was added to the collection flask to avoid sulfur interferences in gas chromatography-

mass spectrometry. The extracts were concentrated by rotary evaporation up to a 

volume of about 2-3 ml. The solvent was changed to 10 ml of hexane and the volume 

was further reduced to approximately 1-2 ml. Hydrocarbons in the concentrated hexane 

extract were separated using a 2:1 alumina/silica gel column with anhydrous sodium 

sulfate overlaying the alumina in order to remove water. The column was used to clean-

up and fractionate the extract. Elution was performed using 15 ml of hexane to obtain 

the first fraction (aliphatic hydrocarbons), followed by an elution with 30 ml of

dicloromethane/hexane (1:1). These two eluents containing the aromatic hydrocarbons 

(PAH) were combined for analysis. The sample volume was reduced to 1 ml by rotary 

vacuum evaporator and further to 0.2 ml with a gentle pure nitrogen stream. A known 

quantity (2 mg ml-1) of the internal standard, hexamethylbenzene, was added prior to 

GC-MS.  

GC-MS analyses were conducted in an Agilent Network GC system, namely an 

Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a mass selective detector (MSD 5973). 

The selective ion mode (SIM) was used for aromatic hydrocarbons and the scan mode 

was used for aliphatic hydrocarbons. The hydrocarbons were separated using a VF-5MS 

fused silica column (30 m x 0.25 mm i.d. and 0.25 µm film thickness). GC/MS 

operating conditions were as follows: injector and transfer-line temperatures were 

maintained at 300 ºC. The oven temperature program was initially isothermal at 60 ºC 

for 1 min, increased to 200 ºC at a rate of 10 ºC/min (hold for 2 min), and then increased 

at a rate of 5 ºC/min (hold 8 min) and kept isothermal at 300 ºC. Helium was used as 

carrier gas, at a flow rate of 1.3 ml min-1. Aliquots of 1 µl were manually injected in the 

splitless mode with a 7.50 min solvent delay. For aromatic hydrocarbons, mass spectra 

were acquired at the electron impact (EI) mode at 70 eV. The mass scanning ranged 

between m/? 20 and m/? 500. 

The surrogate recoveries added to sediment samples were 78 ± 18 % for 

naphthalene-d8, 91 ± 19 % for acenaphthene-d10, 114 ± 25 % for phenanthrene-d10, 109 

± 24 % for chrysene-d12 and 120 ± 20 % for perylene-d10. 

 

Total community DNA extraction 

Total community DNA (TC-DNA) was extracted from bulk sediment and 

rhizosphere samples (0.5 g) with the MoBio UltracleanTM soil DNA kit (Cambio) 

following manufacturer's instructions.  

 

PCR amplification of 16S rRNA gene fragments and denaturing gradient gel 

electrophoresis (DGGE) 

A nested PCR approach was used to amplify the 16S rRNA gene sequences from 

bulk and rhizosphere sediment (Gomes et al., 2008), which was more efficient for 

amplification of 16S rRNA gene fragments from sediment suitable for DGGE analyses.

Briefly, in the first PCR the universal bacterial primers U27 and 1492R (Weisburg et 

al., 1991) were used. Reaction mixtures (25 µ L) contained 12.5 µl DreamTaq™ PCR 

Master Mix (Fisher Scientific), 0.1 µ M of each primer, 80 µ g ml-1 bovine serum 

albumin (BSA) and 1 µ l of template DNA. The amplification conditions were as 

follows: 5 min of denaturation at 94 ºC, 25 cycles of 45 s at 94 °C, 45 s at 56 °C, and 

1.5 min at 72 °C; the PCR was finished by an extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. The 

amplicons obtained were used as template for a second PCR with the bacterial DGGE 

primers 984F-GC and 1378R (Heuer et al., 1997). The PCR reaction mixtures (25 µ l) 

consisted of 12.5 µl DreamTaq™ PCR Master Mix (Fisher Scientific), 0.1 µ M of each 

primer, 1 % (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 1 µl of template DNA. PCR 

amplification conditions: initial denaturation (94 ºC for 4 min); 30 cycles of 

denaturation (95 ºC for 1 min), annealing (53 ºC for 1 min), and extension (72 ºC for 1.5 

min) and a final extension (72 ºC for 7 min). The GC-clamped amplicons were applied 

to a double-gradient polyacrylamide gel containing 6-10% acrylamide with a gradient of 

40-58% of denaturants. The run was performed in Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer at 60 °C at 

a constant voltage of 80 V for 16 h using the DCode System (Universal Mutation 

Detection System, Bio-Rad). The DGGE gels were silver stained (Heuer et al., 2001). 

The processing of the scanned DGGE gels was carried out using Bionumerics software 

6.6 (Applied Maths). 

 

Barcoded-pyrosequencing  

A barcoded pyrosequencing approach was used for the analysis of bacterial 

communities in bulk and rhizosphere sediments. Composite samples (four subsamples) 

of bulk or rhizosphere sediments from each sampling site were used for pyrosequencing 

analysis. Fragments of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene were sequenced 

for each sample with primers V3 Forward (5?-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAG-3?) and V4 

Reverse (5?-TACNVRRGTHTCTAATYC-3?) (Wang &amp;amp; Qian, 2009), 1x Advantage 2 

Polymerase Mix (Clontech), 1x Advantage 2 PCR Buffer, 0.2 µM of each PCR primer, 

0.2 mM dNTPs (Bioron), 5% DMSO (Roche Diagnostics GmbH) and 2 µl of genomic 

DNA template in a total volume of 25 µ l. The PCR conditions were as follows: 4 min 

denaturation at 94?C, followed by 25 cycles of 94?C for 30 s, 44?C for 45 s and 68?C 

for 60 s and a final extension at 68?C for 10 min. Negative controls were included for 



Bacterial communities in salt marshes oil exposed

all amplification reactions. Electrophoresis of duplicate PCR products was undertaken 

on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel and the 470 bp amplified fragments were purified using 

AMPure XP beads (Agencourt) or, if more than the expected fragment was amplified, 

gel purified using High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH), 

according to manufacturer's instructions. The amplicons were quantified by fluorometry 

with PicoGreen dsDNA quantitation kit (Invitrogen, Life Technologies), pooled at 

equimolar concentrations and sequenced in the A direction with GS 454 FLX Titanium 

chemistry, according to manufacturer’s instructions (Roche, 454 Life Sciences) at 

Biocant (Cantanhede, Portugal). Sequences generated in this study can be downloaded 

from the NCBI Short Read Archive (Study accession: SRP035868). Analysis of the 

pyrosequencing data was performed using previously described methods (Pires et al., 

2012; Cleary et al., 2013; Polónia et al., 2014 - see supplementary methods for a 

detailed description).  

 

Data analysis 

Two square matrices were imported into R (R Core Team, 2013) using the 

read.table() function: 1) containing the presence and raw abundance of all OTUs per 

sample generated with Qiime and 2) containing band 'abundance' based on band 

intensity and position of the DGGE gel. In the OTU abundance matrix, sequences not 

classified as bacteria or classified as chloroplasts or mitochondria were removed prior to 

statistical analysis. Both matrices were log10 (x+1) transformed and a distance matrix 

was constructed using the Bray-Curtis index with the vegdist() function, in the vegan 

package (Oksanen et al., 2011) in R. The Bray-Curtis index is one of the most 

frequently applied (dis)similarity indices used in ecology (Legendre &amp;amp; Gallagher, 2001; 

Cleary, 2003; Cleary et al., 2013). Variation in OTU composition among microhabitats 

was assessed with Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCO) using the cmdscale() function 

in R with the Bray-Curtis distance matrix as input. We tested for significant variation in 

composition among microhabitats using the adonis() function in vegan. In the adonis 

analysis, the Bray-Curtis distance matrix of species composition was the response 

variable with biotope as independent variable. In DGGE Bray-Curtis distance matrix 

each biotope was the response variable with sampling sites as independent variable. The 

number of permutations was set at 999; all other arguments used the default values set

in the function. Weighted averages scores were computed for OTUs on the first two 

PCO axes using the wascores() function in the vegan package. Significant differences 

among microhabitats in the relative abundance of the most abundant bacterial phyla, 

classes and selected orders and the dominant OTU in each microhabitat were tested with 

an analysis of deviance using the glm() function in R. Because data were proportional, a 

glm with the family argument set to binomial was firstly applied. Because the ratio of 

residual deviance to residual d.f. in the models substantially exceeded 1, family was set 

to ‘quasibinomial’. In the ‘quasibinomial’ family, the dispersion parameter is not fixed 

at 1 so that it can model over-dispersion. Using the glm model, we tested for significant 

variation among microhabitats using the anova() function in R with the F test, which is 

more appropriate when dispersion is estimated by moments, as is the case of 

quasibinomial fits. 

 

Phylogenetic tree 

Selected sequences from dominant OTUs (&gt; 150) and their closest relatives 

retrieved from GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). These were aligned and a 

bootstrap consensus tree was built with 500 replicates with MEGA 5 

(http://www.megasoftware.net/). The bootstrap value represents the percentage of 

replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together. For tree inference, the 

nearest neighbor interchange (NNI) heuristic method and automatic initial tree selection 

were used. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. 

 

In silico metagenome analysis 

In the present study, PICRUSt (Langille et al., 2013) was used to predict the 

metagenome of each sample. PICRUSt is a bioinformatics tool that uses marker genes, 

in this case 16S rRNA, to predict metagenome gene functional content. These 

predictions are pre-calculated for genes in databases including KEGG (Kyoto 

Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) and COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups of 

proteins). In this study, the KEGG database and focused on KOs in the polyaromatic 

degradation pathway was used. R was used to generate bargraphs showing the relative 

abundance of total genes for each sample. Significant differences among biotopes in the 

relative abundance of total genes were tested with an analysis of deviance using the 



Bacterial communities in salt marshes oil exposed 

39 

 

glm() function in R. The glm model, was used to test for significant variation among 

biotopes using the anova() function in R with the F test, which is more appropriate 

when dispersion is estimated by moments, as is the case of quasibinomial fits. 

 

Results and Discussion 

Sediment properties and hydrocarbon contamination 

The sediments of four sites were analyzed comparatively based on their 

physicochemical properties (Table 2.1) and on the quantification and composition of 

aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons (Table 2.2). Texture sediment characterization 

classified all sediments as mud, with the exception of sediment from site B (Table 2.1). 

In terms of total hydrocarbons, the concentration calculated as the sum of partial 

concentrations (aliphatic and 16 PAHs) ranged from 5.86 to 21.39 ng g-1 dry weight 

(dw), with the highest concentrations observed in site C and the lowest in site B. Sites A 

and D presented similar levels of overall hydrocarbon contamination (11.05 and 11.47 

ng g-1 dw, respectively). Aliphatic hydrocarbons consisted mainly of C10-C32 n-alkanes 

with total concentration ranging from 3.789 to 10.253 ng g-1 dw (Table 2). The total 

concentration of 16 PAHs in sediment ranged from 1.285 (A) to 11.134 (C) ng g-1 dw 

(Table 2.3).

The localization of the sampling points may explain to some extent the differences 

in concentration of hydrocarbons obtained. Sites A and C are located in the Mira 

channel, one of the four main channels of the estuarine system, whereas sites B and D 

are located in secondary channels. Another important feature of site C, the most 



Bacterial communities in salt marshes oil exposed 

40 

 

contaminated site, is that it is located close to the Port of Aveiro and exposed to greater 

anthropogenic activity (recreational, navigation, urban runoff and shipping activity). 

Because hydrocarbons may have multiple origins, some aliphatic diagnostic indices 

were used to identify biogenic (terrestrial and marine) and/or anthropogenic sources. 

Pristane (C19) and phytane (C20) are common isoprenoids in coastal marine sediments 

and good indicators of petroleum contamination (Readman et al., 2002). The pristane to 

phytane ratios (Pr/Ph) of ? 1 reflect petroleum contamination and higher ratios indicate 

biogenic source. In this study, the Pr/Ph ratios (Table 2.2) indicate that hydrocarbons in 

sediments are most likely associated to petroleum contamination in sites A, C and D and 

are predominantly of biogenic origin at site B. Other aliphatic indicators, such as n-

C17/Pr and n-C18/Ph ratios (Table 2.2), are useful as indicators of early microbial 

degradation (Díez et al., 2007). Generally, lower n-C17/Pr ratios (&lt;1) reflect the relative 

contribution of allochthonous and autochthonous hydrocarbons to the sediment (Mille et 

al., 2007). The calculated n-C18/Ph ratios in sediments from sites A and C were low 

(0.78–1.14), which indicates that microbial biodegradation of n-alkanes is an important 

process at these sites (Díez et al., 2007).

The composition of the sediment PAH pool showed some differences between sites. 

There was a marked predominance of 5-6 ring PAHs at sites B, C and D but 2-3 ring 

PAHs were most abundant in sediment from site A (Table 2.3). This pattern may be 

related with the prevailing conditions at different estuarine sites since high-molecular-

weight PAHs tend to predominate in sediments from marine and river environments 

(Yan et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2011; Commendatore et al., 2012; Gonul &amp;amp; Kucuksezgin, 

2012). PAH molecular indices based on the ratios of selected PAH concentrations may 

help to infer the pyrogenic (originated from the combustion of fuels) or petrogenic 

(originated from petroleum) origin of the PAH pool (Budzinski et al., 1997).

According to the diagnostic criteria (Table 2.4), PAHs found in the sediments of Ria 

de Aveiro are associated to fossil fuel combustion (pyrogenic sources). The ratio of 

low-molecular-weight (LMW) to high-molecular-weight (HMW) ranged from 0.173 to 

0.669 (Table 2.4). Taken together with the Phe/Ant, Fluor/Pyr, Fluor/(Fluor+Pyr) and 

InP/(InP+BghiP) ratios (Luo et al., 2005), the results confirm that the PAH 

contamination of salt marsh sediments of Ria de Aveiro is typically related to chronic 

fossil fuel exposure. In a recent report, the effect and bioavailability of PAHs in three 

different marine sediments (muddy, sand and organic) were tested (Lindgren et al., 

2014). Their results show that muddy sediment, although containing the highest total 

PAH concentrations after 60 days, had the lowest bioavailable concentration. On the 

other hand, sandy sediment contained the lowest total PAH concentrations but the 

highest bioavailability. In this study, the sandy sediment (site B) has the lowest total 

hydrocarbon concentration, related to the higher bioavailability characteristic of this 

type of sediment.

community profiles of different

sampling sites (A, B, C and D). 

Site-related variation of the structure of microbial communities  

DGGE fingerprinting analysis revealed a significant association between 

composition of bacterial communities and sampling site, in the microhabitats 

corresponding to the rhizosphere of H. portulacoides (Adonis F3,15 = 5.07, P &amp;lt;0.001, R
2 

= 0.559), the rhizosphere of S. perennis subsp. perennis (Adonis F3,15 = 4.57, P &amp;lt;0.001, 

R2 = 0.533) and bulk sediment (Adonis F3,15 = 4.18, P &amp;lt;0.001, R
2 = 0.511). These 

differences can also be observed in the PCO ordinations present in Fig. 2.2. The first 

two PCO axes explained approximately 50 % of the variation, with samples of each 

sampling site clustering together for each microhabitat.

In salt marsh sediments, the composition of the community in terms of the dominant 

microbial taxa is structured by local factors (Bowen et al., 2009) related with 

geographical localization, environmental conditions and pollutants (Córdova-Kreylos et 

al., 2006). Studies conducted in the Ria de Aveiro have suggest that environmental 

factors structure bacterial communities (Cleary et al., 2012; Oliveira et al., 2012). In 

this study, localization of the vegetation banks in the complex estuarine system and the 

differential exposure to environmental contamination, together with different 

physicochemical characteristics and hydrodynamics of each sampling site, might have 

influenced bacterial composition. The geographical location of site C, close to Port of 

Aveiro, may explain the higher organic matter content and hydrocarbon concentration in 

the sediment, as compared with the other sites. Site B is located in a secondary channel, 

more sheltered from direct sources of contamination or intense anthropogenic activities. 

In this case, other physicochemical characteristics, and a different sediment texture 

(Table 2.1), were probably major determinants of bacterial composition.  

In this study, hydrocarbon concentrations were lower than reported in other salt 

marshes (Hwang et al., 2006; Watts et al., 2006; Ribeiro et al., 2011). Previous studies 

have, however, shown that relatively low levels of hydrocarbons in the sediment had an 

effect on the structural diversity of bacterial communities (Castle et al., 2006; Labbé et 

al., 2007). 

 

Structure of bacterial communities in salt marsh sediments 

The structure of sediment bacterial communities associated to H. portulacoides and 

S. perennis subsp. perennis roots and bulk salt marsh sediments were determined by 

16S rRNA gene amplicons. Proteobacteria represented approximately 60 % of the total 

sequences in all samples but Actinobacteria were also well represented in rhizosphere 

samples (Fig. 2.3). Bacteroidetes were the third most dominant group, accounting, on 

average, for 8.3 % of the sequences. These three phyla were the most abundant groups 

detected in a study conducted in a coastal salt marsh during and after the influx of 

petroleum hydrocarbons following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (Beazley et al., 

2012). The phylum Proteobacteria is considered a dominant group in estuarine 

sediment samples (Bowen et al., 2012; Gomes et al., 2013; Gomes et al., 2014). Within 

Proteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria were the most dominant class in rhizosphere

samples (F2,9 = 10.745 p = 0.004) whereas Gammaproteobacteria was the most 

abundant class in bulk sediment (Fig. 2.3).

phyla (a, b, c), eight most abundant classes (e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l), the eight most abundant 

orders (m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t) and the most dominant OTU (d) in bulk sediments (BS), H. 

portulacoides rhizosphere (RH) and S. perennis rhizosphere (RS).

The distribution of Alphaproteobacteria in marine and freshwater environments is 

well documented and hydrocarbonoclastic Alphaproteobacteria have been detected in 

marine environments (Kim &amp;amp; Kwon, 2010; Newton et al., 2011). On the other hand, 

Gammaproteobacteria have been reported as abundant in coastal sediment, namely 

Atlantic port sediments (Gomes et al., 2013), Eastern Mediterranean Sea sediments 

(Polymenakou et al., 2005), Northeastern Pacific (Kouridaki et al., 2010) and South 

China Sea sediments (Zhu et al., 2013). In bulk sediment, Deltaproteobacteria was the 

second most dominant class (Fig. 2.3), immediately following Gammaproteobacteria. 

The high relative abundance of the Desulfobacterales order in bulk sediment (F2,9 = 

4.585 p = 0.042) may be a result of more anaerobic conditions in bulk sediment which 

in turn could select for specific guilds such as sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB). These 

results are consistent with other studies conducted in the same estuarine system that 

revealed that the SRB order Desulfobacterales was the most abundant group in 

unvegetated sediment (Gomes et al., 2010a; Cleary et al., 2012). In these sediments, 

generally anoxic just below the surface and suboxic to oxic at the surface (Cunha et al., 

2005; Santos et al., 2007), anaerobic metabolism such as fermentation and anaerobic 

respiration, may represent the major pathways of organic matter oxidation. The high 

relative proportion of SRB in salt marsh sediments can be explained by the availability 

of fermentation-derived substrates directly utilized by SRB (Hines et al., 1999). 

Moreover, sulfate-reducing strains capable of growing and degrading hydrocarbons 

have been isolated from hydrocarbon-polluted marine sediment (Cravo-Laureau et al., 

2004), and some strains were capable of  oxidizing alkenes (Aeckersberg et al., 1991; 

Cravo-Laureau et al., 2004). SRB play critical roles in a variety of processes in coastal 

marine sediments such as, organic matter turnover, biodegradation of pollutants, 

sequestration of metals, and sulfur and carbon cycles (Zhang et al., 2008). Also, recent 

studies showed that the relative abundance of the order Desulfobacterales increases in 

marine sediments contaminated with OH (Suárez et al., 2011; Acosta?González et al., 

2013). A phylogenetic tree of selected dominant OTUs (&gt; 150 sequence reads) and their 

closest relatives was constructed (Fig. 2.4).

The phylogenetic analysis revealed bacterial phylotypes closely related with phyla 

Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria. Only one abundant OTU (18) was 

associated with bulk sediment. This OTU was classified as belonging to the 

Acidobacteria class and closely related to an uncultured bacterium (AF523900) isolated 

from forest wetland impacted by coal (Brofft et al., 2002). Most bacterial populations in 

both rhizospheres showed phylogenetic affiliation with ecotypes from a wide diversity 

of marine environments. Moreover, the majority of these ecotypes are related to 

hydrocarbon impacted sediments (Fig. 2.4).

A study performed after the Prestige oil spill revealed that members of the classes 

Alphaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria were the prevailing groups of bacteria in 

shoreline environments (Alonso-Gutiérrez et al., 2009). Also, a predominance of 

Gamma- and Deltaproteobacteria in anaerobic bacteria communities of coastal 

sediments was reported after the Prestige oil spill (Acosta?González et al., 2013). The 

phylogenetic analysis showed that some OTUs associated with S. perennis rhizosphere 

were closely related to gut bacteria (OTU 15) and uncultured Acidobacteria from 

coastal soils (OTU 45; Fig. 2.4A).  

 

Plant-related variation in the structure of bacterial communities 

Overall analysis of the barcoded pyrosequencing data, comparing all rhizosphere 

samples against bulk sediment samples, showed significant differences between 

bacterial communities from bulk sediment and rhizospheres (Adonis F2,11 = 2.09, P &amp;lt;

0.001, R2 = 0.317). Shannon indices indicate that bacterial communities of S. perennis 

subsp. perennis rhizosphere were more diverse than H. portulacoides rhizosphere and 

bulk sediment (Table 2.S1). The PCO ordination of bacterial operational taxonomic 

units (OTUs; Fig. 2.5) indicates that the two rhizospheres shared the most abundant 

OTUs (large grey circles; &gt; 150 sequences). The rhizosphere effect can explain the 

higher number of OTUs in these samples, when compared to bulk sediment, and 

underlies an apparent convergent adaptation of rhizosphere communities. Plant-bacteria 

interactions, exerted through the release of exudates that create a unique 

physicochemical environment surrounding roots, explained the different shifts in 

bacterial community composition between rhizospheres and bulk sediment. The 

halophyte exudates provide oxygen and high-quality sources of carbon and energy for 

bacterial growth (Bagwell et al., 1998). Moreover, roots provide physical support and 

distinct chemical conditions (Singh et al., 2004; Mucha et al., 2010) and the presence of 

plants differentially promotes the development of some bacterial groups (Berg &amp;amp; 

Smalla, 2009; Mucha et al., 2011; Gomes et al., 2014).

As previously mentioned, Actinobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria were more 

abundant in rhizospheres than bulk sediment and the oxic conditions around the roots 

may explain a lower relative abundance of Desulfobacterales, and consequently 

Deltaproteobacteria, in relation to bulk sediment (Fig. 2.3). The orders 

Acidimicrobiales, Rhodobacterales, Rhizobiales, Sphingobacteriales and 

Rhodospirillales were also more abundant in rhizospheres than in bulk sediment (Fig. 

2.3). The rhizosphere of H. portulacoides showed enrichment of Rhizobiales and 

Acidimicrobiales. Rhizobiales members are involved in atmospheric nitrogen fixation 

by plants and some members of this group have also been reported as degraders of 

aromatic hydrocarbon compounds (Baek et al., 2003). Acidimicrobiales members have 

been considered to be responsive to changes in soil pH (Lauber et al., 2009). Members 

of the Actinobacteria phylum capable of degrading hydrocarbons were isolated from 

Artic native plant species (Ferrera-Rodríguez et al., 2013). The rhizosphere of S. 

perennis subsp. perennis showed enrichment of Rhodobacterales, Sphingobacteriales 

and Rhodospirillales. Rhodobacterales have been associated with the degradation of 



Bacterial communities in salt marshes oil exposed 

51 

 

aliphatic and low-molecular weight aromatic hydrocarbon (Harwati et al., 2007) and the 

association of Sphingobacteriales and Rhodospirillales members with PAH and 

petroleum degradation in soil has also been previously reported (Gomes et al., 2010b; 

Mao et al., 2012).  

Phylogenetic analysis of the dominant selected OTUs (&gt; 150 sequence reads) 

showed that thirteen of these OTUs, predominant in rhizosphere samples, are closely 

related to ecotypes of OH impacted sediments (Fig. 2.4). Six OTUs (5, 14, 19, 30, 4167 

and 4435) were related to organisms assigned to the Acidimicrobiales order, which were 

previously reported from oil-polluted subtidal sediments (Acosta-González et al., 2013) 

as well as from fuel pollution-affected shoreline environments (Alonso-Gutiérrez et al., 

2009). OTUs 19 and 14 were enriched in the rhizosphere of S. perennis subsp. perennis 

in the most contaminated sampling site (C), and OTUs 5, 30, 4167 and 4435 in the 

rhizosphere of H. portulacoides in sampling site A where the aliphatic hydrocarbon 

concentration is higher (Fig. 2.4B; Table 2.2). The other seven OTUs (7, 10, 20, 21, 24, 

36 and 4104) were predominantly enriched in the rhizosphere of S. perennis subsp. 

perennis in site B, the second most polluted site (Fig. 2.4A; Table 2.3). These OTUs are 

phylogenetically closely related to proteobacterial orders that are known OH degraders. 

In this study, OTUs 10 and 24 were assigned to Myxococcales and Desulfobacteraceae, 

respectively. Both of these OTUs are affiliated to sulfate reducing groups that may play 

an important role in hydrocarbon degradation in contaminated coastal sediments (Paisse 

et al., 2008; Acosta?González et al., 2013). Members of Xanthomonadales (OTU 21), 

Rhodospirillaceae (OTU 7) and Rhizobiales (OTU 20) that were detected in this study 

were associated with organisms related to either alkane degradation or oil-polluted sites 

(Viñas et al. 2005; Alonso-Gutiérrez et al. 2009; Patel et al., 2012). According to the 

phylogenetic analysis, the OTU 2094 was clustered into family Rhodobacteraceae. 

Members of this family have highly diverse metabolism and includes 

hydrocarbonoclastic species from freshwater and marine environments (Chang et al., 

2000; Brakstad &amp;amp; Lødeng, 2005). Two dominant OTUs (38 and 4104) showed close 

phylogenetic relationship to the genus Erythrobacter. Several marine oil-hydrocarbon 

degrading stains related to Erythrobacter sp. were found to contain cytochrome P450 

CYP153 and alkB genes (Wang et al., 2010). The alk genes code for an important 

enzyme involved in n-alkanes environmental degradation, and CYP153A genes were 



Bacterial communities in salt marshes oil exposed 

52 

 

detected in petroleum-contaminated soil, groundwater and coastal seawater (Kubota et 

al., 2005). Our phylogenetic analysis also showed a dominance of OTUs closely related 

to Actinobacteria in H. portulacoides rhizosphere, members with high G+C content, are 

gram-positive and are physiologically diverse. In this study, the OTUs sequences for 

Acidimicrobiales order were mostly phylogenetic associated with uncultured 

Actinobacteria members. These observations mirrored results from uncultured (Militon 

et al., 2010) and culture-based (Pucci et al., 2000) approaches suggesting that 

Actinobacteria (Acidimicrobiales and Actinomycetales) might play a role in the 

bioremediation of alkane-contaminated sediments. Autochthonous strains with the 

capacity to degrade alkanes were isolated from crude oil polluted sites (Pucci et al., 

2000). Moreover, it was observed that during bioremediation processes the active 

actinobacterial phylotypes increase (Militon et al., 2010). The abundance of sequences 

phylogenetically related to hydrocarbon degrading organisms in the rhizosphere 

samples analyzed in this study provides evidence that halophyte plant colonization is an 

important driver of the structure of hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial communities in salt 

marshes and demonstrates the potential of plant-bacteria interactions in processes of 

microbe-assisted phytoremediation of hydrocarbons in coastal ecosystems. 

 

In silico metagenome analysis 

PICRUSt algorithm was used to predict metagenome functional content based on 

the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) classification to identify 

potential bacterial traits in different microhabitats. Figure 2.6 shows the relative gene 

count of selected KOs that might be involved in PAH degradation pathways 

(www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?ko00624). Significant differences from three 

selected KOs were observed. KOs K00449, K00517 and K00599, have a higher relative 

gene frequency in rhizosphere samples, but not KO K00492, a methyltransferase 

involved in the final pathway of phenanthrene and pyrene degradation. K00492, 

oxidoreductase, is important in the initial steps of the phenanthrene degradation 

pathway. The protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (K00449) produced by pcaH is 

important in the final steps of the metabolism of several PAHs (fluorene, anthracene 

and phenanthrene). K00517 is an oxidoreductase that acts in the initial step of 

anthracene degradation to 9,10-anthraquinone. These selected KOs are not exclusive of 



Bacterial communities in salt marshes oil exposed 

53 

 

PAH degradation pathways but are involved in other metabolic pathways especially 

related to the degradation of aromatic compounds (www.genome.jp/kegg/).  

Despite the fact that the data obtained here were derived from an in silico 

metagenome analysis, the functional genetic information obtained still represents an 

important resource for the initial evaluation of the distribution of potential bacterial 

traits in different microhabitats.

Conclusion 

Microbial communities in salt marsh sediments appear to respond to interplaying 

factors related to the physico-chemical characteristics of the environment, sediment 

properties, plant colonization and pollution. The results of this study demonstrate that 

the structure of bacterial communities is probably affected by site-related factors, such 

as sediment properties and hydrocarbon contamination, and by plant-related factors.  

The barcoded pyrosequencing approach used in this study provided a 

comprehensive overview of the rhizosphere bacterial communities associated with two 

important halophyte plants from temperate estuaries. The results indicate that root 

systems of H. portulacoides and S. perennis subsp. perennis appear to be able to exert a 

strong influence on bacterial composition. The orders Acidimicrobiales and Rhizobiales 



Bacterial communities in salt marshes oil exposed

were both associated with the rhizospheres of both halophytes whereas the order 

Desulfobacterales was associated with bulk sediment. In addition to this, the in silico 

metagenome analysis revealed a possible higher number of genes involved in the 

process of PAH degradation in the rhizosphere of halophytic plants. This indicates that 

halophyte plant colonization could be an important driver of hydrocarbonovlastic 

bacteria community structure in salt marsh sediments, which can be exploited for in situ 

phytoremediation of OH in salt marsh environments.

Abstract: Salt marsh sediments are sinks for various anthropogenic contaminants, 

giving rise to significant environmental concern. The process of salt marsh plant 

survival in such environment is very intriguing and at the same time poorly understood. 

Plant-microbe interactions may play a key role in the process of environment and in 

planta detoxification. In this study, a combination of culture-dependent and -

independent molecular approaches [enrichment cultures, polymerase chain reaction 

(PCR), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), DNA sequencing] were used to 

investigate the effect of oil hydrocarbons (OH) contamination on the structure and 

function [polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) dioxygenase genes] of endophytic 

bacterial communities of salt marsh plant species (Halimione portulacoides and 

Sarcocornia perennis subsp. perennis) in the estuarine system Ria de Aveiro (Portugal). 

Pseudomonads dominated the cultivable fraction of the endophytic communities in the 

enrichment cultures. In a set of fifty isolates tested, nine were positive for genes 

encoding for PAH dioxygenases (nahAc) and four were positive for plasmid carrying 

genes encoding PAH degradation enzymes (nahAc). Interestingly, these plasmids were 

only detected in isolates from most severely OH polluted sites. The results revealed site-

specific effects on endophytic communities, related to the level of OH contamination in 

the sediment, and plant-species-specific “imprints” in community structure and in genes 

encoding for PAH dioxygenases. These results suggest a potential ecological role of 

bacterial plant symbiosis in the process of plant colonization in urban estuarine areas 

exposed to OH contamination.

Introduction 

Salt marshes are highly productive intertidal environments that serve as nursery 

grounds for many commercially and economically important species. Because of their 

physical and biological characteristics, salt marshes are considered particularly 

susceptible to anthropogenic inputs of petroleum hydrocarbons (PH) (Carman et al., 

1996; Watts et al., 2006; Martins et al. 2008). The sediment contamination with PH, 

especially lower molecular weight aromatic hydrocarbons, can interfere with the 

development of salt marsh plants (Watts et al., 2006; Watts et al., 2008). Due to the 

constant input of different pollutants to salt marshes located in urban areas, restoration 

approaches based on natural recovery processes may take decades. However, the use of 

plants for bioremediation (phytoremediation) associated to indigenous degrading 

microorganisms for removal or sequestration of pollutants has been intensively studied 

(Phillips et al., 2008; Germaine et al., 2009; Afzal et al., 2011; Khan et al., 2013). This 

approach may accelerate the process of environmental recovery and diminish the costs 

associated with more invasive technologies. 

Several studies show that plant roots harbour a diverse microbial population in their 

rhizo- and endosphere that are enriched in important catabolic genotypes for 

hydrocarbons degradation (Gomes et al., 2010a; Yousaf et al., 2010b). These degrading 

bacteria may have a potential for detoxification of the sediment surrounding the roots 

(Geiselbrecht et al., 1996; Daane et al., 2001; Phillips et al., 2006; Watts et al., 2008; 

Yousaf et al., 2010b) or, in the case of endophytes, may be important for in planta 

hydrocarbons degradation and detoxification (Siciliano et al., 2001; Phillips et al., 2008; 

Yousaf et al., 2010b). In this scenario, endophytes may empower the plant with the 

biological detoxification resources required for enhanced survival in contaminated 

environments.  

Endophytic bacteria are described as nonpathogenic bacteria colonizing internal 

plant tissues, without causing symptoms of disease (Taghavi et al., 2005; Lodewyckx et 

al., 2002). Roots are the major entry of endophytic bacteria into the plant system, 

presenting higher bacterial densities than other parts of the plant (Lodewyckx et al., 

2002). Therefore, factors that are determinant in the structure of rhizosphere 

communities, such as soil properties (Marschner et al., 2001; Jung et al., 2008; Afzal et 

al., 2011) or plant specific factors (Grayston et al., 1996; Marschner et al., 2001; 



Endophytic with degradative hydrocarbon potential 

59 

 

Siciliano et al., 2001), are also likely to influence the diversity of endophytic 

communities. In general, endophytic bacteria are highly diverse and ubiquitous in most 

plant species (monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous) and the most common genera 

found are Pseudomonas, Burkholderia, Bacillus, and Azospirillum (Lodewyckx et al., 

2002). The capacities of endophytic bacteria to act as plant growth promoters or 

enhance plant resistance to pathogens are known (Compant et al., 2005; Zachow et al., 

2008). Recently, studies on the structural and functional diversity of endophytic 

hydrocarbon degraders from different impacted environments and different types of 

plants (essentially plants used for hay and green manure) show distinct degradative 

potential for hydrocarbon pollutants (Phillips et al., 2008; Yousaf et al., 2010b). In fact, 

the presence of bacteria carrying genes or catabolic plasmids with genes encoding PH 

metabolism in planta may contribute to the process of plant and soil (or sediment) PH 

detoxification in contaminated areas. The presence of PH degradative genes on mobile 

genetic elements, such as plasmids, has been pointed out as an important spreading 

mechanism for PH catabolic abilities among bacteria in contaminated areas. Horizontal 

gene transfer of PH degrading genes in contaminated areas has been reported, thereby 

enabling the hosts with oil hydrocarbon degrading capacities and contributing to 

microbial community acclimation to environmental pollutants (Herrick et al., 1997; Ma 

et al., 2006). A better understanding of the endophytic communities of salt marsh plants 

in contaminated coastal ecosystems may contribute fundamental information to the 

development of new approaches based on plant-microbe association for restoration of 

impacted areas.  

The rhizosphere effect in the process of PH degradation has been progressively 

recognized. However, only very few studies have focused on the rhizosphere of salt 

marsh vegetation (Daane et al., 2001; Mucha et al., 2011) and practically none on the 

associated endophytic bacterial communities. Moreover, sediment properties, such as 

hydrocarbon contamination, organic matter content, and texture, are important drivers 

of bacterial community composition in coastal environments (Langworthy et al., 1998; 

Gomes et al., 2008; Liang et al., 2011; Wang &amp;amp; Tam 2012; Gomes et al., 2013). 

However, there is a lack of studies on the influence of these parameters on the structure 

and function of the endophytic bacterial communities.

In this study, culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches were used to 

investigate the effects of PH contamination on the structure (cultivation and 16S rRNA 

gene community fingerprint analyses) and function (plasmids and PAH dioxygenase 

genes) of endophytic bacterial communities from salt marsh plant species (Halimione 

portulacoides and Sarcocornia perennis subsp. perennis) in a temperate estuarine 

system (Ria de Aveiro, Portugal). Sediment properties were also analysed to obtain 

more complete characterization of the sampling sites and evaluate their potential effect 

on the structure of the bacterial endophytic community. This work also aimed to 

provide evidences that naturally occurring endophytic bacteria may have potential to 

contribute for in planta detoxification of OH compounds and to plant colonization in 

OH polluted urban estuarine areas. 

 

Material and Methods 

Experimental site and sampling  

The salt marshes investigated in this 

study are located in Ria de Aveiro-

Portugal, a shallow estuary-coastal lagoon 

system on the northwest cost of Portugal 

(40.7° N, 8.7° W), consisting of a complex 

network of channels with extensive 

intertidal zones (Dias et al., 1999). Plant 

samples were collected at low tide in four 

salt marshes: site A, 40?35´52.64´´N, 

8?45´.0071´´W; site B, 40?38´27.42´´N, 

8?44´15.42´´W; site C, 40?37´32.18´´N, 

8?44´09.12´´W; site D, 40?37´18.90´´N, 

8?39´46.28´´W (Fig. 31). From each site, 

four composite samples of two widely 

distributed salt marsh plant species 

(Halimione portulacoides and Sarcocornia 

perennis subsp. perennis) were stored 

separately in sterile plastic bags. These two species were chosen for their wide 



Endophytic with degradative hydrocarbon potential

distribution and ecological importance and for being two of the most common species in 

the study area. The endophytic community was recovered from fresh roots. Root 

material was vigorously washed in distilled water (5 min) and root surface was 

disinfected by sequential washing with 95% ethanol and 1% sodium hypochlorite 

supplemented with one droplet Tween 80, and rinsed three times in sterile distilled 

water (Barac et al., 2004). A 100 µ L sample of final rinsing water was spread-plated on 

869 medium (Mergeay et al., 1985) to check the efficiency of disinfection.  

 

Sediment properties  

The pH value of bulk sediments was measured in a sediment: water suspension [1:5 

(w/v)] (Faoun 1984), using a pre-calibrated pH meter (Orion Model 290A). Organic 

matter (OM) content was analyzed as percentage of weight loss by ignition at 450 °C, 

for 8 h (SPAC 2000). Sediment grain size was analyzed by wet and dry sieving 

(Quintino et al., 1989).  

Freeze-dried sediment samples were homogenized and analyzed for aliphatic and 

aromatic hydrocarbons after a Soxhlet extraction followed by GC-MS analysis. For 

assessing the efficiency of recovery, 5 g sub-samples of sediment were spiked with 25 

µ L (2 µ g mL-1) deuterated surrogate standards (naphthalene-d8, acenaphthene-d10, 

phenanthrene-d10, chrysene-d12 and perylene-d12 (Supelco) and extracted for 24 h in a 

Soxhlet apparatus with 150 mL of dichloromethane. Sample extracts were concentrated 

by rotary evaporation up to a volume of about 2-3 mL, and solvent changed to 10 mL of 

hexane, which was further reduced to approximately 1-2 mL. Hydrocarbons 

concentrated in hexane extracts were separated using a deactivated 2:1 alumina/silica 

gel column. Elution was performed using 15 mL of hexane to yield the first fraction 

(aliphatic hydrocarbons), followed by 30 mL of dichloromethane:hexane (1:1). Sample 

volume was reduced to 1 mL on a rotary evaporator, evaporated under nitrogen gas to 

0.2 mL, transferred to a GC vial, and 25 µ L of the internal standard, hexamethylbenzene 

(2 mg mL-1) were added. GC-MS analyses were carried using an Agilent Network GC 

system, namely an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a mass selective 

detector (MSD 5973) with electron impact ionization (EI) operating at 70 eV (Agilent 

Technologies). A VF-5MS fused silica column (30 m x 0.25 mm i.d and 0.25 µ m film 

thickness) was used for analytes separation. The carrier gas used was helium with a 



Endophytic with degradative hydrocarbon potential 

62 

 

flow rate of 1.3 mL min-1. Injector and transfer-line temperatures were set at 300 ºC. 

The ion source was maintained at 230 ºC. A 1 µ L splitless injection volume was 

delivered with a 10 µ L Hamilton syringe. The initial column temperature was 

maintained at 60 ºC for 1 min, ramped to 200 ºC at a rate of 10 ºC min-1; a second ramp 

of 5 ºC min-1 raised the column temperature to 300 ºC, which was kept for 8 min. For 

aromatic hydrocarbons the selected ion monitoring (SIM) acquisition mode was used. 

The full scan acquisition mode (in a range between m/z 20 and m/z 500) was used to 

detect aliphatic hydrocarbons, and for quantification two internal standards were used: 

undecane (C11H24) and tetracosane (C24H50). 

 

Endophytic communities 

DNA extraction 

Extraction of total DNA from the endophytic communities (TC-DNA) was 

performed using a bead-beating protocol previously outlined in the study by Phillips et 

al., 2006. About 2 g of surface disinfected root material was macerated in liquid 

nitrogen. The cell lysis was achieved by a combination of bead-beating, proteinase K 

(20 mg mL-1) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (20%). Cellular debris and proteins were 

precipitated with aqueous 7.5 M ammonium acetate. DNA was subsequently 

precipitated with isopropanol, washed with 70% cold ethanol and re-suspended in 50 µ L 

TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA; pH 8.0). The endophytic TC-DNA was 

purified with the GeneClean Spin Kit (MP Biomedicals). 

 

DGGE analysis 

 The structural diversity of the endophytic communities was assessed by DGGE 

fingerprint analysis of TC-DNA of 16S rRNA gene fragments, after a nested-PCR 

approach (Gomes et al., 2008). First, 16S rRNA gene fragments were amplified using 

the primers U27F and 1492R (Table 1). Reaction mixtures (25 µ L) contained 12.5 µl 

DreamTaq™ PCR Master Mix (Fisher Scientific), 0.1 µM of each primer, 80 µ g mL-1 

bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 1 µ L of template DNA. The amplification conditions 

were as follows: initial denaturation (94 ºC for 5 min); 25 cycles of denaturation (94 ºC 

for 45 s), annealing (56 ºC for 45 s), and extension (72 ºC for 1.5 min), and a final 

extension (72 ºC for 10 min). The amplicons obtained from the first PCR were used as a 



Endophytic with degradative hydrocarbon potential 

63 

 

template for a second PCR with bacterial DGGE primers 984F-GC and 1378R (Table 

1). The PCR reaction mixtures (25 µ L) consisted of 12.5 µl DreamTaq™ PCR Master 

Mix (Fisher Scientific), 0.1 µ M of each primer, 1 % (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) 

and 1 µ L of template DNA. After 4 min of denaturation at 94 ºC, 30 thermal cycles of 1 

min at 95 °C, 1 min at 53 °C, and 1.5 min at 72 °C, the PCR was finished by an 

extension step at 72 °C for 7 min. Five µ L of PCR products were analyzed by 

electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel and stained with GelRed (Biotium). 

The DGGE of the amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments was performed using DCode 

System (Universal Mutation Detection System, Bio-Rad). PCR products containing 

approximately equal amounts of DNA were loaded onto 6-10 % (w/v) polyacrylamide 

gel in 1 x TAE buffer (0.04 M Tris-Acetate, 0.001 M EDTA; pH 8.0). The 6-10 % 

polyacrylamide gel was made with a denaturing gradient ranging from 40 to 58 %. 

Electrophoresis was performed for 16 h at 80 V at 60 °C in 1 x TAE buffer. Following 

electrophoresis, the gels were silver-stained according to Heuer et al., (2001). 

  

Detection of PAH degrading genes  

The presence of genes encoding the large subunit of naphthalene-1,2-dioxygenase 

(nahAc) and alpha subunit of the PAH ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases genes, both 

related to PAH degradation, was detected by PCR using the primers and reaction 

conditions described by Wilson et al., (1999) and Cébron et al., (2008), respectively 

(Table 3.1).  

 

Determination of gene copy number of PAH ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase genes of 

Gram-negative bacteria  

Quantification of PAH ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase of Gram-negative bacteria 

was carried out using the primers and probe previously described by Cébron et al., 

(2008) by real-time PCR (Applied Biosystems StepOne™ Real-Time PCR System). 

Amplification was performed in 20 µ L reaction volume containing 11 µ L SYBR® 

Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 0.2 µ M of each primer (IBA GmbH), 

0.55 µ L of DMSO, 100 µ g mL-1 of BSA and 1 µ L of template TC-DNA. The 

temperature profile was 95 ºC for 10 min followed by 45 cycles at 95 ºC for 30 s, 57 ºC 

for 30 s, 72 ºC for 30 s and a data collection step of 10 s at 80 ºC. The final step 



Endophytic with degradative hydrocarbon potential 

64 

 

consisted of 72 ºC for 7 min. A final melt curve analysis, from 6 ºC below amplification 

temperature, to 95 ºC, concluded the cycling program. Templates to generate standard 

curves were serial dilutions of amplicon of Pseudomonas putida pNF149 (108 to 102). 

The samples were 10 times diluted prior to amplification to avoid problems with 

inhibitors. DNA samples were used at a concentration of 4-11 ng µ L-1.

Endophytic isolates 

Enrichment and isolation of PH-degrading bacteria  

Endophytic extracts were obtained by root maceration (0.5 g) in 10 mL of 10 mM 

MgSO4.7H2O using a Stomacher 400 (Seward Ltd). The enrichment consisted of a 



Endophytic with degradative hydrocarbon potential 

65 

 

series of batch cultures containing two different carbon sources: 2-methylnaphthalene 

and diesel oil mixture (98 octane gasoline with 2 % engine oil). The first enrichment 

consisted of inoculation with 1 mL of endophytic extract to 50 mL of sterile mineral 

medium (MM) (Ma et al. 2006) supplemented with 10 mg of 2-methylnaphthalene 

crystals or with 1% filter-sterilized diesel oil (0.2 µm, PTFE membranes). 

Cycloheximide (100 mg/L) was added to the selective media to suppress fungal growth. 

Control flasks without root extracts were included. The flasks were covered with non-

absorbent cotton wool and incubated at room temperature in the dark with agitation 

(100 rpm) for 7 days. Two more selection rounds were conducted by sub-culturing 1 

mL from the previous culture in 50 mL of mineral medium with the corresponding 

carbon source. Aliquots of each selective culture were stored at -80 ºC in 1 mL of 

glucose broth (Fluka) with 25 % glycerol, for molecular studies.  

From each selective culture, 100 µ L replicate aliquots were spread-plated in two 

different media: R2A and King B (Merck). Isolated colonies were selected based on 

morphology and color and purified by successive streak-plating on R2A and King B 

medium. After purity confirmation, selected colonies were transferred to LB Medium 

with 15 % glycerol and frozen at - 20 °C until processing. 

 

DNA extraction  

Extraction of genomic DNA from endophytic isolates was performed after cell lysis 

with the Qiagen genomic DNA extraction kit (Qiagen), in combination with Fermentas 

DNA Extraction Kit (Fermentas). 

 

Characterization and identification of endophytic strains  

Endophytic strains were grouped by the similarity of BOX-PCR genomic 

fingerprints using the BOX_A1R primer (Martin et al., 1992). For strains with distinct 

fingerprints, the 16S rRNA gene was amplified using PCR universal bacterial primers 

U27 and 1492R (Weisburg et al., 1991) and sequenced. The partial 16S rRNA 

sequences were compared with different sequences available in the GenBank database 

using BLAST-N (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool).

Detection of genes encoding for PAH degradation  

The presence of nahAc and PAH ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase genes was 

detected by PCR using the primers and reaction conditions described by Wilson et al. 

(1999) and Cébron et al., (2008), respectively (Table 3.1), as previously described for 

community DNA. 

 

PCR-detection of broad host range (BHR) plasmids 

A PCR approach was used for detection of BHR plasmid-specific sequences in 

DNA extracted from isolated endophytic strains. The amplifications of plasmid-specific 

sequences of IncP-1 (trfA gene), IncP-7 (rep gene) and IncP-9 (oriV-rep genes) were 

performed with the primers and conditions summarized in Table 3.1. The positive PCR 

amplicons were confirmed by Southern-blot hybridization (SBH) on Hybond N nylon 

membranes (Amersham Hybond-N; GE Healthcare) according to Sambrook &amp;amp; Russell 

(2001). PCR amplicons of IncP-9 were hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled mixed 

probe generated from typical IncP-9 plasmids. Detection of hybridization with the DIG-

labeled probe was performed with a DIG luminescent detection kit (Roche Applied 

Science) as specified by the manufacturer, using an X-ray film (Roche Applied 

Science). 

 

Plasmid-DNA extraction and characterization  

Plasmids were obtained by alkaline extraction according to the adaptation of the 

procedure by Birnboim &amp;amp; Doly (1979) described by Smalla et al., (2000). For plasmid 

characterization, extracted DNA was digested for 4 h at 37 ºC with a combination of the 

restriction enzymes PstI and Bst11071 (Fisher Scientific). Restriction fragments were 

separated on a 0.8 % agarose gel for 2 h at 50 V and stained with GelRed (Biotium). 

 

Detection of genes encoding for PAH degradation enzymes in plasmidic DNA 

The presence of specific catabolic genes encoding enzymes involved in hydrocarbon 

degradation in plasmids extracted from isolated strains was assessed using specific 

primers for the nahAc and PAH ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase genes (Table 3.1). A 

touchdown PCR programme was used for the amplification of nahAc-like genes, as 



Endophytic with degradative hydrocarbon potential 

67 

 

described by Wilson et al., (1999). A 16S rDNA PCR negative control reaction was 

conducted to ensure the absence of bacterial chromosomal DNA.  

  

Sequence analysis of PAH degrading genes and phylogenetic tree 

Amplicons of PAH degrading genes were cleaned using GeneClean II Kit (MP 

Biomedicals) following the manufacturer´s instructions and sequenced at external 

facilities (StabVida). Sequenced genes were compared with sequences available in the 

GenBank® database by using the BLAST service to determine their closest relative. 

 

Statistical analysis  

The DGGE profile analysis was conducted with the software package BioNumerics 

v6.6 (Applied Maths, Belgium). The matrix containing both band position and intensity 

was processed in a spreadsheet and transformed into relative abundance. The relative 

abundance matrix was log10 (x+1) transformed, and a distance matrix was constructed 

with the Bray Curtis similarity values. Distance values were used to ordinate profiles by 

nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis using PRIMER 6 software. 

Environmental variables, namely pH, organic matter, moisture, % fines and 

hydrocarbon concentration were fit in NMDS community composition analysis using a 

Pearson correlation. The distance based linear models (DistLM) was carried out to 

identify correlations between measured sediment parameters and the composition of 

endophytic community. For the initial marginal test, the AIC (Akaike Information 

Criterion) was selected, basing the analysis on the Bray-Curtis resemblance measure 

after square root transformation of the abundance data. A two-way permutational 

analysis of variance (perMANOVA) was used to analyze the differences in endophytic 

community composition and gene copy number between plant species and sampling 

sites.  

The amino acid sequences deduced of PAH dioxygenase genes fragments were 

aligned to their closest relatives. A phylogenetic tree was then constructed using the 

Neighbor-joining algorithm applied gamma distribution to a Jones-Taylor-Thornton 

(JTT) model and bootstrapping (500 repetitions) analysis using the Molecular 

Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA5) software.

Results and Discussion 

Environmental variables and endophytic community composition  

The location of the sampling sites within the complex estuarine system of Ria de 

Aveiro influenced the physical-chemical properties of the sediment, such as organic 

matter content and OH concentration (Table 3.2). According to the total concentration 

of aromatic (16 PAHs) and aliphatic PH, site B is the least (5.86 ng gram-1 dry weight) 

and site C the most contaminated site (21.39 ng g-1 dw). Sites A and D showed similar 

levels of contamination with intermediary values (11.05 and 11.47 ng g-1 dw, 

respectively). Site C is more exposed to anthropogenic activities (recreational 

navigation, urban runoff and shipping activity), while site A is located in the same main 

channel but with lower influence of the Port of Aveiro. Site B is not exposed to direct 

contamination as it is located in a secondary channel, and finally, site D is also located 

near a secondary channel but is exposed to the influence of industrial activities.

The DistLM analysis was carried out to identify correlations between measured 

sediments parameters and the composition of endophytic bacterial assemblages (DGGE 

profiles). Strong dependence on sediment parameters was observed in the endophytic 

community composition of H. portulacoides and S. perennis subsp. perennis plants, 

explaining 63% and 71% of variation, respectively. Using AIC to find the simplest 

combination of sediment parameters which best explained the bacterial assemblage 



Endophytic with degradative hydrocarbon potential 

69 

 

patterns, pH, log (? 16PAHs) and organic matter were identified as the best fit model, 

explaining 51 % of variation in H. portulacoides plants and 58 % of variation in S. 

perennis subsp. perennis plant. In agreement with our results, Gomes et al (2007, 2008, 

2013) provided evidences that the degree of sediment contamination and especially the 

type of pollutants present can influence the structure of bacterial communities 

inhabiting estuarine sediments. Soil properties, such as pH and organic matter 

(Marschner et al., 2001; Jung et al., 2008; Afzal et al., 2011), are also important drivers 

in the process of bacterial colonization in rhizosphere microhabitats. However, there is a 

lack of information about the influence of the parameters evaluated in this study on the 

estuarine endophytic communities. 

 

Plant species effects on endophytic bacterial communities 

The endophytic bacterial assemblage patterns inferred from DGGE analyses were 

ordinated using NMDS (Fig. 3.2A and 2B). With exception of sites A and C in S. 

perennis, the NMDS ordination revealed significant changes in the composition of 

bacterial communities from different plant species [two-way perMANOVA (p &amp;lt;0.001)] 

(data not shown). Plant effects on the microbial community in surrounding sediments 

can be species specific (Berg &amp;amp; Smalla 2009). Root morphology and exudates are 

known drivers in the process of rhizosphere colonization by soil bacteria (Marschner et 

al., 2001; Berg &amp;amp; Smalla 2009; Bais et al., 2006) and may be expected to contribute for 

in planta colonization of endophytic bacteria. Root exudates, more specifically, may 

contain various molecules that are structurally related to several environmental 

pollutants (e.g. PAHs) with potential to enhance soil bacteria carrying catabolic 

pathways for aromatic compounds (Shaw &amp;amp; Burns 2003). A previous study (Oliveira et 

al., 2012) provided evidences that H. portulacoides and S. maritima root systems may 

contribute for the release of species specific volatile compounds in their root exudates.

communities from two different plants, Halimione portulacoides (A) and Sarcocornia 

perennis subsp. perennis (B), along a gradient of hydrocarbons contamination.  

 

PAH dioxygenase genes in total endophytic communities  

Genes encoding for PAH dioxygenase were present in members of the endophytic 

communities found in the roots of H. portulacoides and S. perennis subsp. perennis, 

indicating a potential metabolic capacity of endophytic bacteria for degradation of PH. 

In this study, different sets of primers for detection of genes encoding for PAH 

degrading enzymes were used. The sequence analyses showed that the majority of genes 

detected in endophytic communities were closely related to the nahAc gene. 

Interestingly, some genotypes showed plant-species-specific association (Table 3.S1). 

Although catabolic genes associated with hydrocarbon degradation are considered to be 

widespread, some genotypes can show specific associations with some plant species 

(Phillips et al., 2008). Other studies have shown that specific catabolic genotypes are 

plant species dependent, although also influenced by environmental factors (Siciliano et 

al., 2001, Cébron et al., 2009, Ding et al., 2010). The results obtained in this study 

indicate that the abundance of genes encoding for PAH ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase 

in the endophytic communities tend to show differences between plant species and 

sampling sites (Fig. 3.3). Gene copy numbers were highest in plants located in more 

contaminated sites (C and D). However, perMANOVA analysis did not confirm 

significant differences between sites. A similar plant/contaminant-dependent selection 

of different catabolic genotypes in endophytic populations was observed in Scirpus 

A B

community in a gradient of hydrocarbons contamination (mean value ± STD, n = 4). 

 

The preponderance of the factors related either to plant attributes or to sediment 

properties may be difficult to decide. However, a study about the diversity of ndo genes 

in rhizosphere of two vascular plants growing in Antarctic soils revealed that the 

selection of ndo genotypes was more related to the contamination than to the influence 

of plants (Flocco et al., 2009). Also, the effects are most likely interdependent. It has 

been demonstrated that plant growth can be affected by soil characteristics (soil type, 

particle sizes and organic matter content) which also influence microbial colonization 

and activity, and subsequently the efficiency of contaminant degradation (Afzal et al., 

2011).

Endophytic bacteria enriched in selective cultures  

Fifty putative hydrocarbonoclastic endophytic bacterial strains were isolated from 

selective cultures. After BOX-PCR typing, twenty-six isolates were selected as clone 

representatives. Their 16S rRNA gene sequences showed 98-100% similarity to known 

genes deposited in the GenBank database and closely related with organisms obtained 

from polluted sites (Table 3.3). Sequence analysis of these strains revealed a great 

predominance of Gram-negative bacteria, particularly Pseudomonas sp. Only few 

endophytic Gram-positive bacteria were isolated (Table 3.3). The predominance of 

Gammaproteobacteria, mainly Pseudomonas sp., is consistent with previous 

observations of this group associated to the degradation of hydrocarbons (Ma et al., 

2006) in rhizospheres as well as in root endophytic communities (Phillips et al. 2008; 

Taghavi et al., 2009; Yousaf et al., 2010b). Sphingobium, Acinetobacter, 

Microbacterium, Micrococcus and Ochrobactrum were also found among the isolates. 

In a similar work, twenty-one PAH degrading bacteria strains isolated from Antarctic 

soils were identified as Pseudomonas and associated to PAH degradation (Ma et al., 

2006). Sphingobium sp. is reported as a common PAH degrader in soils (Cunliffe &amp;amp; 

Kertesz 2006) and Acinetobacter sp., in association with other bacteria, is also involved 

in the degradation of a variety of PAHs (Yu et al., 2005). Crude-oil-degrading strains of 

Microbacterium are also described in the literature (Schippers et al., 2005), and two 

Micrococcus strains capable of growing on a mixture of naphthalene and phenanthrene 

were isolated from soil near an oil refinery (Ashok et al., 1995). Ochrobactrum is also 

reported as able to grow on a variety of PAHs, namely phenanthrene, pyrene, 

fluoranthene and benzo[a]pyrene (Wu et al., 2009). 

 

PAH genes and BHR plasmids in endophytic isolates  

In this work, three sets of primer were used to target genes encoding for PAH 

degradation in endophytic strains (Table 3.S2). These genes were only detected in few 

isolates and mainly in cultures obtained from naphthalene enrichments. In general, the 

isolation of microorganisms capable of growing on naphthalene is widely documented 

(Widada et al., 2002). In selective cultures containing diesel oil as carbon source, genes 

encoding for PAH degradation were only detected on three Pseudomonas isolates. This 

may be related to the fact that diesel oil represents a more diverse carbon source,

containing a small fraction of naphthalene and a range of aromatic and aliphatic 

hydrocarbons that may be used by different and specialized metabolic pathways (Ciric 

et al., 2010). 

The use of culturable fractions of the endophytic communities as retrieved from the 

selective cultures might also explain the differences in gene prevalence. In a study 

conducted in mangrove microniches, the composition of the original community of the 

microniches determined the structural and functional diversity of the PAH degrading 

enrichments (Gomes et al., 2010a).  

The phylogenetic tree of the predicted amino acid sequences of gene fragments 

encoding for PAH dioxygenase from endophytic isolates shows a close phylogenetic 

relationship with the large ?-subunit of naphthalene dioxygenase belonging to the 

nahAc genotypes described for Pseudomonas species and/or plasmids associated with 

this genus (Fig. 3.4, 3.5). In Figure 3.4, the amino acid sequence retrieved from the 

three strains (protocol 1) is closely related to archetypal nahAc gene sequences of 

Pseudomonas-associated plasmids (sequences identity within the group 73%).

aligned with related sequences retrieved from GenBank. 

 

The protocol 2 detected genes encoding for PAH degradation closely related to the 

nahAc gene previously described for Pseudomonas sp. LCY18 and Pseudomonas 

associated plasmid (Fig. 3.5). The occurrence of nah-like genotypes carried by PAH 

degrading bacteria have been reported in isolates from enrichment cultures with 

naphthalene or phenanthrene as carbon source (Ma et al., 2006) and in the rhizosphere

of two plants growing in Maritime Antarctic (Flocco et al., 2009). A succession of 

different genes encoding PAH dioxygenase was found in PAH-contaminated 

environments, and a dominance of nah-like genotypes occurred after enrichment with 

naphthalene (Chadhain et al., 2006). Moreover, our results indicate that different genes 

encoding for PAH degradation occur when exposed to different PAHs in culture 

medium. The results obtained in this work underline the potential environmental 

importance of nah genotypes in the process of PAH degradation by bacterial 

endophytes in salt marsh plants.

Horizontal gene transfer mediated by catabolic plasmids plays an important role in 

the adaptation of microbial communities to chemical stress in polluted environments 

(Dennis 2005). For this reason, in this study, the potential role of BHR plasmids (IncP-

1, IncP-7 and IncP-9) in the process of horizontal transfer of genes encoding PAH 

dioxygenase was investigated (Table 3.S2). A total of 18 isolates, all from the selective 

cultures containing naphthalene, carried IncP-9 plasmids (Table 3.S2). However, IncP-1 

and IncP-7 plasmids were not detected. IncP-9 catabolic plasmids belong to a known 

group of self-transmissible plasmids that often encode enzymes involved in the process

of PH degradation. In this study, sequence fragments obtained from genes encoding for 

PAH dioxygenase in plasmids exhibited high similarity with the nahAc gene of plasmid 

FKY4, a IncP-9 self-transmissible plasmid able to transfer the ability to degrade 

naphthalene to other bacterial cells (Ono et al., 2007) (Fig. 3.5). Our results indicate that 

this plasmid may be involved in the spread of nah genotypes between salt marsh plants 

in the estuary studied. 

 

Conclusions 

This study assessed the potential effects of petrogenic hydrocarbon contamination 

on the structural and functional diversity of endophytic bacteria in two salt marsh plant 

species. The results showed that plant species and sediment properties are likely 

interacting in the modulation of the endophytic bacterial communities and in their 

genetic determinants for OH degradation, like genes and plasmids. Furthermore, plant-

species-specific “imprints” were confirmed in the composition of genes encoding for 

PAH degradation. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, the culturable fraction of 

endophytic degraders was essentially close related to known PAH-degrading 

Pseudomonas species. The prevalence of nah genotypes and the detection of catabolic 

plasmids in salt marsh plants indicate that horizontal gene transfer can drive the spread 

of nah genes in these habitats and probably contribute to the process of bacterial 

endophytic adaptation and in planta OH decontamination. Moreover, nah genes are 

commonly associated with hydrocarbon degrading species belonging to the genus 

Pseudomonas. Overall, the results suggest that the adaptation to OH contamination goes 

beyond the rhizosphere communities and extends to endophytic bacteria tightening the 

relations established between plants and microbes in response to OH contamination.

CHAPTER 4 

Evaluation of plant-microbe interactions in 2-methylnaphthalene contaminated 

sediments 

 

Abstract: The interaction between plants and their associated indigenous degrading 

microorganisms (rhizo- and endosphere) have been explored as a process for the 

removal or sequestration of pollutants. In this study, a factorial microcosm approach 

was used to investigate the response of the salt marsh halophyte Halimione 

portulacoides to contamination with 2-methylnaphthalene. The effect of inoculation 

with indigenous endophytic hydrocarbon degrading bacterium Pseudomonas sp. was 

also assessed. During the experiments, plant photosynthetic performance was monitored 

by Pulse Amplitude Modulated (PAM) fluorometry, the structural diversity and function 

of bacterial communities were assessed by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis 

(DGGE) analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences, and the detection of polycyclic 

aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) dioxygenase genes was attempted. The clearance of the 

added hydrocarbon was evaluated by chemical analysis of the sediments.  

The endophytic and rhizosphere communities exhibited different responses to 

inoculation and/or to 2-methylnaphthalene amendment. The inoculation had a positive 

impact in plant photophysiology but it did not cause a significant change in the plant 

health responses to hydrocarbon exposure. The addition of 2-methylnaphthalene 

increased the frequency of genes encoding for the large subunit of naphthalene-1,2-

dioxygenase (nahAc) in sediment bacteria (with and without inoculation). 

These results do not demonstrate a significant effect of the inoculation with an 

endophytic hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria on the overall hydrocarbon degradation 

potential of the salt marsh halophyte Halimione portulacoides, under the moderate PAH 

concentrations of the experiment. However, the effect of the inoculant on the structure 

of the indigenous endophytic community indicates that the strain used in this study is a 

good plant colonizer and may be regarded as promising candidate for microbe-assisted 

phytoremediation approaches.

Introduction 

Estuarine areas are very susceptive to contamination by oil hydrocarbons, mainly 

because they are often located in the vicinity of urban and industrialize areas. 

Petroleum-derived, such as, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), are of particular 

importance due to their ubiquity, toxicity and persistence (Haritash &amp;amp; Kaushik, 2009). 

Removal techniques are being applied to water and sediment in the attempt to restore 

environmental quality, with a preponderance of in situ methods which are more efficient 

and cost-effective (Alkorta &amp;amp; Garbisu, 2001).  

Phytoremediation as the use of vegetation to enhance degradation and removal of 

contaminants in soil, sediments and groundwater has emerged as the best natural 

technology alternative (Escalante-Espinosa et al., 2005, Moreira et al., 2011). 

Successful application rely on a variety of factors, such as the type and quantity of 

contaminant, performance of particular plant species or physical and chemical 

characteristics of the contaminated area (EPA, 200, Alkorta &amp;amp; Garbisu, 2001). The salt 

marsh vegetation is dominated by halophytes that have the capacity to tolerate high salt 

concentration (Flowers &amp;amp; Colmer, 2008) and their potential as 

bioindicators/biomonitors of contamination (Anjum et al., 2013) or in the clean-up of 

petroleum hydrocarbon contamination have been studied (Oliveira &amp;amp; Mendelssohn, 

2009, Al-Mailem et al., 2010, Couto et al., 2011, Ribeiro et al., 2013). Plants exudates 

(e.g, sugars, organic acids and vitamins) enhance microbial activity promoting 

hydrocarbon reduction in contaminant areas. Therefore, one of the mechanisms 

responsible for phytoremedition is the increase of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria 

populations containing catabolic genes responsible for hydrocarbon degradation 

(Siciliano et al., 2002).  

The stimulation of indigenous microorganisms capable of degrading pollutants or 

the addition of engineered microorganisms to enhance biodegradation has been reported 

(Barac et al., 2004, Germaine et al., 2009, Afzal et al., 2013). Pseudomonas species 

have been shown to be capable to degrade a range of organic pollutants, including PAH, 



Plant-microbe interactions in 2-methylnaphthalene contaminated sediments

halogenated derivates and recalcitrant organic residues (Bhattacharya et al., 2003), and 

were frequently reported in PAH-impacted environments (Ma et al., 2006, Coelho et al., 

2011, Dubinsky et al., 2013, Oliveira et al., 2014).  

Halimione portulacoides (L) Allen, a low perennial shrub of the Chenopodiaceae 

family, highly abundant in salt marshes along the Atlantic coast of Europe (Waisel, 

2012), is a promising species for the application of phytoremediation in salt marsh 

sediments.  H. portulacoides has been the subject of a variety of studies due to its 

potential to accumulate several metals (Cacador et al., 2009, Valega et al., 2009, Anjum 

et al., 2011), and is also a good candidate to use in phytoremediation of hydrocarbon 

contamination areas. In this study, 2-methylnaphthalene was used as model of 

hydrocarbon sediment contamination. Naphthalene is the simplest and most widespread 

environmental pollutant member of the chemical family of polycyclic aromatic 

hydrocarbons (PAHs) and its methyl-substituted derivate is among the most toxic 

components in crude and fuel oils (Mahajan et al., 1994).  

The objective of this study was to test, under controlled microcosms conditions, if 

the inoculation of H. portulacoides with a hydrocarbon-degrading bacterium would 

mitigate the negative effects of the exposure of plants to hydrocarbon contamination. 

 

Material and Methods 

Samples of Halimione portulacoides were collected from an estuarine system (Ria 

de Aveiro, Portugal, 40º36’N, 08º45’W) during late autumn. In order to obtain grafts of 

H. portulacoides, stems with leaves were cut in small pieces (aprox. 6-8 cm) that were 

placed in bottles with ¼ Hoagland nutrient solution with the following composition: 1.5 

mM KNO3, 1 mM Ca (NO3)2, 0.5 mM NH4H2PO4, 0.25 mM MgSO4.7H2O, 50 mM 

KCl, 25 mM H3BO3, 2 mM MnSO4. H2O, 2 mM ZnSO4.7H2O, 0.5 mM CuSO4.5H2O, 

0.5 mM (NH4)6 Mo7O24.4H2O and 20 mM FeNaEDTA (Duarte et al., 2007). The plants 

were kept at room temperature under natural light for approximately five months in 

order to allow the development of new root biomass. Test-sediment was collected from 

the same site sieved through 2.00 mm. The sediment had a moisture capacity of 

22.47%, organic matter content of 4.25% and a pH 7.12. The sediment texture 

corresponds to mud with 58% of fines (Oliveira et al., 2014).

The experimental design was randomized, with grafts divided in 4 treatments: 

control (Ctl – sediment with plants); sediment with inoculated plant (I); sediment 

contaminated with 2-methylnaphthalene and with plant (MtN); sediment contaminated 

with 2-methylnaphthalene and with inoculated plant (MtN_I). The experiment was 

conducted for eight weeks.  

 

Treatments  

In order to simulate PAH contamination, sediments (MtN and MtN_I) were spiked 

with 2-methylnaphthalene (final concentration 10 µ g g-1). To achieve a uniform spiking, 

2-methylnaphthalene was dissolved in acetone and added to 1/4 of total sediment. The 

acetone was allowed to evaporate overnight. The contaminated sediment (1/4) was well 

mixed with additional sediment (3/4) (Brannock, 2004). Each container took 150 g of 

sediment. 

 Pseudomonas sp. SN31 strain was obtained after enrichment with 10 mg of 2-

methylnaphthalene crystals as the sole carbon source as described in a previous study 

(Oliveira et al., 2014). The 16S rDNA ribosomal sequence used to identify the isolate is 

available at the GenBank under the accession number: EF628000. Before planting, the 

plant grafts were divided in two sets. In one, plants were treated with freshly grown 

Pseudomonas sp. SN31 cells (107) by dipping the roots in a 0.85% NaCl solution, over 

72 h. In other set the roots were dipped only in sterile NaCl solution (Fig. 4.S1).  

Finally, plants were transferred to PAH-spiked or control sediment and maintained 

under natural light and room temperature. During the course of the experiment, two 

days per week all treatments were subjected to irrigation with Hoagland´s solution (Fig. 

4.S2).   

 

Quantification of 2-methylnaphthalene 

Sediment was analyzed for 2-methylnaphthalene using a Soxhlet extraction 

followed by a GC-MS analysis. Four sediment samples of each treatment were 

homogenized and freeze-dried before extraction. Deutorated naphthalene-d8 surrogate 

standard was added to sediment samples to monitor the procedures of sample extraction, 

cleanup and analysis. In a Soxhlet apparatus 5 g dried and homogenized sediment

treatment was extracted with 150 ml dicloromethane. Prior to extraction, the sediment 

was spiked with 25 µ l (2 µ g/ml) deuterated recovery surrogate standard (naphthalene-

d8). Activated copper (Schubert et al., 1998) were added to the collection flask to avoid 

sulfur interferences when using mass chromatography. After extraction, the sample 

extracts were concentrated by rotary evaporation up to a volume of about 2-3 ml, and 

change solvent into 10 ml n-hexane which further reduce to approximately 1-2 ml. The 

concentrated hexane extract with 2-methylnaphthalene was separated using a 2:1 

alumina/silica gel column with anhydrous sodium sulfate overlaying the alumina 

(remove small quantities of water). This column was used to clean-up and fractionate 

the extract. Elution was performed using 15 ml of hexane to yield the first fraction and 

followed by 30 ml of dicloromethane/hexane (1:1). The sample volume was reduced to 

1 ml by rotary vacuum evaporator and further to 0.2 ml with a gentle purified nitrogen 

stream. A known quantity (2 mg/ml) of the internal standard, hexamethylbenzene, was 

added prior to GC-MS. GC-MS analysis was carried using an Agilent Network GC 

system, namely an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a mass selective 

detector (MSD 5973) in the selective ion mode (SIM). The 2-methylnaphthalene was 

separated using a VF-5MS fused silica column (30 m x 0.25 mm i.d and 0.25 µ m film 

thickness). GC/MS operating conditions were as follows: injector and transfer-line 

temperatures were maintained at 300 ºC. The oven temperature programmed was 

initially isothermal at 60 ºC for 1 min, increased to 200 ºC at a rate of 10 ºC/min (hold 

for 2 min), and then kept isothermal at 300 ºC for 3 min with a rate of 20 ºC/min. 

Helium as the carried gas a flow rate of 1.3 mL min-1.  A 1 µ L sample was manually 

injected in the splitless mode with a 1 min solvent delay. The mass spectra of 2-

methylnaphthalene was acquired at the electron impact (EI) mode at 70 eV. The mass 

scanning ranged between m/? 20 and m/? 500. The naphthalene-d8 surrogate recovery 

was 90 ± 6 %. 

 

Photosynthetic performance  

Chlorophyll a fluorescence was monitored by PAM fluorometry as an indicator of 

photosynthetic performance, using an imaging chlorophyll fluorometer (Open 

FluorCAM 800-O/1010; Photon Systems Instruments). The equipment comprises a 



Plant-microbe interactions in 2-methylnaphthalene contaminated sediments 
 

86 

 

computer-operated control unit (SN-FC800-082, PSI), an 2/3” CCD camera (CCD381, 

PSI) attached to an F1.2 (2.8-6 mm) objective (Eneo) and four 13 x 13 cm LED panels 

emitting red light (emission peak at 621 nm, 40 nm bandwidth). Two LED panels 

(MLS13x13-016A/B) provided the modulated measuring light (&amp;lt;0.1 µ mol m-2 s-1) and 

the other two (SL3500-179/180) provided saturating pulses (&gt; 7500 µ mol m-2 s-1, 0.6 s). 

Chlorophyll a fluorescence was filtered using a filter system (composed by a high pass 

filter (695 nm) and a low pass filter (780 nm) and images (12 bit, 512 x 512 pixels) 

were captured and processed using FluorCam7 software (Photon Systems Instruments). 

Experimental procedure was carried out under the control of user-defined automated 

measuring sequences (protocols) with the ability to define measurement intervals and 

irradiance (Nedbal et al., 2000). For each treatment, five replicate of H. portulacoides 

leaves under the same experimental conditions were dark adapted for 5 minutes, before 

the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII) could be measured (Fv/Fm). A 

user defined protocol, with a total duration of 2s, was used to estimate Fv/Fm and 

allowed minimum fluorescence (Fo), to be measured for 1,4 seconds and then a 600 ms 

light saturating pulse (SP) was applied, which allowed the determination of maximum 

fluorescence (Fm) values. Fv/Fm was calculated following Kitajima &amp;amp; Butler (1975). 

After the estimation of Fv/Fm, rapid light-response curves (RLCs) were performed 

immediately on the same samples. RLCs were built using 14 increasing actinic light 

steps, from 53 to 1531 µ mol m-2 s-1, with each light step taking 10 sec, after which an 

SP was applied, allowing the estimation of steady state fluorescence (Fs) and maximum 

light-adapted fluorescence (Fm’) for each light step. The relative electron transport rate 

(rETR) was calculated for each light step, as rETR = [(Fm’- Fs)/Fm]’*PAR, with (Fm’- 

Fs)/Fm, being the PSII effective quantum yield (Genty et al., 1990). Light curve 

parameters, such as ? (initial slope), rETRm (maximum rETR) and Ek (light-saturation 

parameter) where quantified by fitting the model of Eilers &amp;amp; Peeters (1988), using the 

MS Excel Solver.  

 

Total community DNA (TC-DNA) extraction 

Four samples of 0.5 g of rhizosphere sediments were subject to TC-DNA extraction 

using a MoBio UltracleanTM soil DNA kit (Cambio) following the manufacturer´s 



Plant-microbe interactions in 2-methylnaphthalene contaminated sediments 
 

87 

 

instruction. The endophytic community was recovered from fresh roots. Root material 

was vigorously washed in distilled water (5 min) and root surface was disinfected by 

sequential washing with 95% ethanol and 1% sodium hypochlorite supplemented with 

one droplet Tween 80, and rinsed three times in sterile distilled water (Barac et al., 

2004). A 100 µ L sample of final rinsing water was spread-plated on 869 medium 

(Mergeay et al., 1985) to check the efficiency of disinfection. The endophytic TC-DNA 

extraction was performed using a bead-beating protocol previously described in 

(Phillips et al., 2006). About 2 g of surface disinfected root material was macerated in 

liquid nitrogen. The cell lysis was achieved by a combination of bead-beating, 

proteinase K (20 mg mL-1) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (20%). Procedures cellular 

debris and proteins were precipitated with aqueous 7.5 M ammonium acetate. DNA was 

subsequently precipitated with isopropanol, washed with 70% cold ethanol and re-

suspended in 50 µ L TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA; pH 8.0). The 

endophytic TC-DNA was purified with the GeneClean Spin Kit (MP Biomedicals). 

 

PCR amplification of 16S rRNA gene fragments and denaturing gradient gel 

electrophoresis (DGGE) 

A nested PCR approach was used to amplify the 16S rRNA gene sequence from 

rhizosphere sediments and endophytic communities (Gomes et al., 2008). Briefly, in the 

first PCR the universal bacterial primers U27 and 1492R were used. The amplicons 

obtained was used as template for a second PCR with the bacterial DGGE primers 

984F-GC and 1378R (Heuer et al., 1997). PCR proceeding and amplification conditions 

were described in (Oliveira et al., 2014). 

The GC-clamped amplicons were applied to a double-gradient polyacrylamide gel 

containing 6–10% acrylamide with a gradient of 40–58% of denaturants. The run was 

performed in Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer at 60 °C at a constant voltage of 80 V for 16 h 

using the DCode System (Universal Mutation Detection System, Bio-Rad). The DGGE 

gels were silver stained (Heuer et al., 2001). The processing of the scanned DGGE gels 

was carried out using the Bionumerics software 6.6 (Applied Maths).

Detection of genes encoding for PAH degradation  

The presence of genes encoding the large subunit of naphthalene-1,2-dioxygenase 

(nahAc) and alpha subunit of the PAH ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases genes, both 

related to PAH degradation, was detected by PCR using the primers and reaction 

conditions described by Wilson et al. (1999) and Cébron et al. (2008), respectively and 

summarized in Oliveira et al., (2014). 

 

Statistical analysis 

After analysis of DGGE gels the data matrix of band abundance (band positions and 

their corresponding intensities) per sample was log10 (x + 1) transformed and a distance 

matrix was constructed using the Bray-Curtis index with the vegdist() function in the 

vegan package (Oksanen et al., 2011) in R version 3.0.1 (http://www.r-project.org/; 

checked 2013/09/13). Variation in bacterial composition as response to different 

treatments in rhizosphere sediments and root endophytic communities was visually 

assessed with Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCO) using the cmdscale() function in R 

using the Bray-Curtis distance matrix as input. Significant differences between 

treatments in the communities of different microhabitats were tested using the adonis() 

function in vegan. The adonis() function performs an analysis of variance with distance 

matrices using permutations that partition the distance matrices among sources of 

variation. In the adonis() analysis, the Bray-Curtis distance matrix of band composition 

was the response variable with type of treatments the independent variable. The number 

of permutations was set at 999; all other arguments used the default values set in the 

function. Plant fluorescence parameters and 2-methylnaphthalene concentration data 

was included in an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model to determine the specific 

effects of each treatment. ANOVA analysis were performed using aov() function of the 

R. 

 

Results

Halimione portulacoides grew well in both controls (non-contaminated) and 2-

methylnaphthalene contaminated sediments. At the end of experiment plants appeared

healthy, with development of news leave and shoots (Fig. 4.S2). Fluorescence 

parameters were used to determine if 2-methylnaphthalene had a significant negative 

impact on plant health and photophysiology (Table 4.1). Maximum quantum yield of 

photosystem II (Fv/Fm) was evenly high in all treatments with an average of 0.788, 

without significant differences between treatments. The rETRm parameter used as a 

descriptor of the maximum photosynthetic rate, decrease in all treatments from the 

beginning to the end of experience (Table 4.1).

The final 2-methylnaphthalene concentrations in spiked sediments were lower (p &amp;lt;

0.001) than at the beginning of the experiment (Table 4.2). The initial concentration of 

2-methylnaphthalene in sediment was approximately 48 ng g dwt-1 and decrease to 

approximately 12 ng g dwt-1 at the end of experiment (Table 4.2) in both amendmdent 

sediments (MtN and MtN_I). In the treatments without added 2-methylnaphthalene, the 

concentrations at the beginning and at the end of the experiment were not significantly 

different (Table 4.2).

DGGE analysis of the bacterial community 

The effect of 2-methylnaphthalene on the bacterial community structure was 

determined using 16S rRNA gene-based PCR-DGGE for rhizosphere sediments and 

endophytic community at the end of the experiment. In order to determine differences 

between the bacterial community fingerprints, PCO was performed based on intensity 

of each DGGE band under the different conditions and microhabitats. PCO analysis 

shows that depending on the microhabitat, treatments have distinctly influenced 

bacterial community responses. The rhizosphere communities (Fig. 4.1) were generally 

conserved and a detectable shift in community structure only occurred under the 

combined pressure of 2-methylnaphthalene amendment and bacterium inoculation 

(Adonis F3,12 =3.60, P &amp;lt;0.001, R2 = 0.607). The PCO analysis of the endophytic 

community (Fig. 4.2) showed a clear separation of one cluster corresponding to the 

controls (Ctl) and another cluster including all other treatments (Adonis F3,12 =3.60, P &amp;lt;

0.001, R2 = 0.444) with inoculum and 2-methylnaphthalene separately or both additions 

at the same time.

Discussion 

Salt marsh sediments represent a phytoremediation challenge due to their particular 

biological, physical and chemical specificities. These habitats are constantly subjected 

to very different environmental pressures such as flooding, salinity fluctuations and 

contamination with organic and inorganic compounds. Considering that hydrocarbon 

pollution has severe effects on salt marsh vegetation, the main goal of this study was to 

determine whether the inoculation of a salt marsh halophyte with a hydrocarbon-

degrading bacterial strain could improve its overall degradation potential without 

affective its health status.  

 

Plant condition 

Several studies have reported significant reduction of the growth of salt marsh 

plants subjected to high petroleum hydrocarbons dosage (Mendelssohn et al., 1990, Lin 

&amp;amp; Mendelssohn, 1996, Pezeshki et al., 2000, Lin &amp;amp; Mendelssohn, 2009). Nevertheless, 

the type, quantity and time of exposure of the hydrocarbon contamination may be 

determinant (Lin &amp;amp; Mendelssohn, 1998). The tolerance limits of the salt marsh 

halophyte Juncus roemerianus is estimated to be between 160 and 320 mg diesel g-1 dry 

sediment. Above this limit, growth can be significantly affected (Lin &amp;amp; Mendelssohn, 



Plant-microbe interactions in 2-methylnaphthalene contaminated sediments 
 

93 

 

2009). Although the susceptibility of Halimione portulacoides is not well characterized, 

plants were not significantly affected by the concentration of 10 µ g g-1 of 2-

methylnaphthalene used in this work, as revealed by the Fv/Fm descriptor of 

photosynthetic efficiency. This means that quantum efficiency of the light reactions of 

photosynthesis on the contaminated plants was not affected. Information on the 

photosynthetic potential at different light regimes can also be inferred from the light 

curve parameters, especially the rETRm. The results of this parameter indicate that there 

was some variation of the photosynthetic potential during the course of the microcosm 

experiments. This can be explained as an acclimation phenomenon.  

In this study, the concentration of added PAH was intentionally low in order to 

represent realistic levels of contamination in moderately polluted estuaries. The results 

indicate this PAH load was generally well tolerated by the plants. A study of the effect 

of oil contamination (range 0.3 to 2.73 L m-2) on the photosynthetic activity of 

Salicornia virginica produced similar results (Rosso et al., 2005) indicating that plants 

can tolerate moderate concentrations of hydrocarbon without significant impairment of 

the photosynthetic function. In a field trial, there was only a modest variation on the 

photosynthetic rate in a group of plants subjected to petroleum contamination and 

inoculated with PGPR (plant growth promoting rhizobacteria) (Gurska et al., 2009). A 

different result was obtained in a study in which the effects of oil on Spartina 

alterniflora photosynthesis were measured. In this case, despite a full year of recovery, 

plants exhibited chronic stress which depressed photosynthesis (Biber et al., 2012).  

 

Hydrocarbon clearance 

The comparison of the concentration of 2-methylnaphthalene at the beginning and at 

the end of the experiments shows that, in the presence of the plant, there was a 75% 

reduction after 8 weeks in microcosm experimentally amended with 2-

methylnaphthalene (MtN and MtN-I). Several studies have demonstrated that 

phytoremediation is an efficient strategy for the removal of hydrocarbons from 

contaminated sediments (Taghavi et al., 2005, Lin &amp;amp; Mendelssohn, 2009) in 

comparison to other bioremediation approaches (Germaine et al., 2009, Moreira et al., 

2011). The increase of root biomass produces considerable amounts of exudates and 



Plant-microbe interactions in 2-methylnaphthalene contaminated sediments 
 

94 

 

consequently stimulates bacterial activity in the rhizosphere microhabitat, which might 

contribute to enhanced OH capacity (Escalante-Espinosa et al., 2005, Moreira et al., 

2011). On the other hand, a study using the same plant demonstrated that H. 

portulacoides can interfere with the degradation of higher molecular weight PAHs by 

sediment microorganisms and this was interpreted as an indication of competition for 

nutrients between plants and microorganisms (Mucha et al., 2011).  

The fact that inoculation did not enhance 2-methylnaphthalene degradation by the 

plant can be related with the inoculation method or environmental factors. Other studies 

report that the failure of bacteria inoculation in contaminated sites can be a matter of 

inoculum size (Mishra et al., 2001) or strong influence of soil characteristics, such as 

the soil type, particle sizes or organic matter content (Afzal et al., 2012, Afzal et al., 

2013). May be the inoculant would have been more helpful if 2-methylnaphthalene 

concentrations were very high. 

 

Structure of bacterial communities 

In this experiment the contamination had a differentiated impact on the structure of 

bacterial communities, depending on the microhabitat (endophytic or rhizosphere 

sediments). The presence of contaminants is known to modify the composition and 

activity of sediment bacterial communities (Gomes et al., 2005). Moreover, plants may 

enhance pollutant degradation by positively affecting the abundance, diversity and 

activity of specific microorganism in the surrounding rhizosphere (Siciliano et al., 2002, 

Mucha et al., 2011) and within plants roots (Phillips et al., 2008, Ryan et al., 2008). The 

results of this work indicate that endophytic and rhizosphere communities exhibited 

different responses to inoculation and/or to 2-methylnaphthalene amendment. The 

rhizosphere microbiota was more resilient and changes only occurred when two sources 

of variability (contamination and inoculation) were imposed. The inoculant used in this 

experiment was actually isolated from the endosphere of Sarcocornia perennis subsp. 

perennis root in a hydrocarbon-impacted salt marsh of Ria de Aveiro (Oliveira et al., 

2014). Therefore, it is expectable that this strain might also be present in the roots of the 

plants used in this study and that the inoculation alone did not represent a significant 

shift in community structure. Also, the rhizosphere communities are naturally enriched 



Plant-microbe interactions in 2-methylnaphthalene contaminated sediments 
 

95 

 

in hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria (Daane et al., 2001, Ma et al., 2010, Ribeiro et al., 

2011) and the amendment with realistic concentrations of 2-methylnaphthalene may not 

represent a significant challenge to the rhizosphere bacterial community. However, 

when the contaminant and the contaminant-inoculum were combined, there was 

detectable change in the bacterial community that could indicate a stress-relieve 

response.   

The PCO analysis of endophytic communities shows that the community reacted to 

contamination and to inoculation and also to the combination of both manipulations. 

These results suggest that endophytic communities are more sensitive to selective 

pressures applied separately that can correspond to a successful competition between 

inoculated bacteria and indigenous endophytic bacteria for plant roots. The endophytic 

communities are unique to each plant species and differences in their distribution and 

diversity can be due to plant-specific factors, metabolic pathways, nutrient availability 

and composition of root exudates (Günther et al., 1996, Rosenblueth &amp;amp; Martínez-

Romero, 2006). The amendment of an aromatic hydrocarbon causes a change in the 

composition of the endophytic community that may correspond to a selective response 

of particular hydrocarbon degrading strains. The relations between plant-specific 

factors, composition of the endophytic bacterial community and potential for 

hydrocarbon degradation have already been demonstrated in prairie plants (Phillips et 

al., 2008). The inoculum used in the present work is a hydrocarbon endophytic 

bacterium (Oliveira et al., 2014). Therefore, the observed change in the endophytic 

community in inoculated treatments suggests that the internalization of inoculant cells 

did occur during the experiment, even without experimental amendment with 2-

methylnaphthalene, and that the inoculant may be a promising root colonizer.  

 

Hydrocarbon degradation genes 

Naphthalene dioxygenase genes, as representatives of the family of catabolic genes 

involved in hydrocarbon degradation, were analyzed to assess the hydrocarbon-

degradation potential of rhizosphere and endophytic bacterial communities. At the end 

of the 8-week experiment, naphthalene dioxygenase genes were only detected in 2-

methylnaphthalene treatments, and in the case of the endophytic community, in 



Plant-microbe interactions in 2-methylnaphthalene contaminated sediments 
 

96 

 

inoculated plants. The positive detection only in contaminated sediments can be due to 

the increase of naphthalene degradation genes number and the enhancement of 

horizontal gene transfer in response of 2-methylnaphthalene contamination. In fact, it 

has been reported that biodegradation potential is enhanced by horizontal gene transfer 

and development of an efficient degrading microbial community upon contamination 

(Top et al., 2002, Top &amp;amp; Springael, 2003). The number of nahAc gene copies is directly 

related with the rate of naphthalene degradation (Park &amp;amp; Crowley, 2006) and the 

response to 2-methylnaphthalene in terms of nahAc gene copy number may be 

interpreted as an adaptative stress response. The fact that naphthalene degradation genes 

in endophytic communities were only detected in the treatment corresponding to 

inoculated plants in spiked sediments can be related with selection of naphthalene 

endophytic degraders in response to contamination.  

 

Conclusions 

In conclusion, the salt mash plant H. portulacoides can influence microbial 

communities by favoring the development of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria which 

may contribute to hydrocarbon clearance in salt marsh sediments. The hypothesis that 

the inoculation of the plants with the PAH-degrading endophytic bacterium would 

enhance 2-methylnaphthalene degradation could not be demonstrated. However, the 

inoculation did have an impact on the structural diversity of endophytic communities. 

This result indicates that this strain is a good plant colonizer. Because it carries genetic 

determinants for hydrocarbon degradation (e.g. plasmids) that can be horizontally 

transferred within the community, it may represent a promising candidate for microbe-

assisted phytoremediation approaches.

CHAPTER 5 

Conclusions 

 

The deposition and accumulation of contaminants, such as hydrocarbons, in salt 

marsh sediments is a recurrent global concern issue. Therefore, the relations between 

plants and microorganisms involved in hydrocarbon removal or degradation have for 

long been followed with interest. The rhizosphere effect in the process of OH (oil 

hydrocarbon) degradation has been progressively recognized. However, only very few 

studies have focused on the rhizosphere of salt marsh vegetation (Daane et al., 2001, 

Mucha et al., 2011, Ribeiro et al., 2011) and practically none on the associated 

endophytic bacterial communities. Phytoremediation is an inexpensive and “green” 

approach based on the interactions between plants, their associated indigenous 

degrading microorganisms (rhizo- and endosphere) and pollutants. The potential of salt 

marsh halophytes to clean-up petroleum hydrocarbons contamination have been studied 

(Oliveira &amp;amp; Mendelssohn, 2009, Al-Mailem et al., 2010, Couto et al., 2011, Ribeiro et 

al., 2013). Moreover, the use of endophytic-derived inoculants to reduce the pollutant 

toxicity to plants and increase biodegradation has been demonstrated (Barac et al., 

2004, Taghavi et al., 2005). 

The main goal of this study is the characterization of relevant plant-microbe 

interactions in oil-impacted salt marshes and the understanding of the effect of 

rhizosphere and endosphere bacteria in the role of salt marsh plants as potential 

phytoremediation agents. In order to achieve the objectives, the methodological 

approach combined field observations with experimental manipulations, conducted in 

plant sediment microcosms. 

 

Field work 

In the field, this study addressed some general questions: How do plant species- and 

OH pollution affect indigenous sediment bacterial composition and degradation 

potential in sampling sites exposed to different levels of contamination? How do 

endophytic communities respond? Which genetic factors are involved in endophytic OH 

degradation capacity?  



Conclusions 

101 

 

The shallow estuary-coastal lagoon Ria de Aveiro is composed of four main 

channels that divide into an intricate network of narrow and shallow secondary cannels 

separated by mud banks and salt marshes. The Aveiro long-distance port facilities are 

installed at the outer section of the estuary and elevated hydrocarbon contamination has 

been reported at this area (Pacheco &amp;amp; Santos, 2001). Also, other antropogenic inputs, 

such as recreational navigation, urban runoff and intense commercial shipping activity, 

cause a continuous efflux of OH.  

The location of the four collecting points was chosen to reflect different levels of 

OH pollution among the areas where the two studied halophytes could be found. The 

halophytes Halimione portulacoides (L.) Allen, and Sarcocornia perennis subsp. 

perennis (P. Mill) are widely represented in temperate estuaries and prevalent species in 

Ria de Aveiro salt marshes (Silva et al., 2009). Both Chenopodiaceae, these species can 

tolerate high salinity and water potentials (Rubio-Casal et al., 2003). By playing a 

relevant role in organic matter recycling and on nutrient and metal sequestration, they 

have been proposed for phytoremediation approaches.  

Within the field approach, culture-dependent and -independent methods were used 

to investigate the effects of OH contamination on bacterial communities in salt marsh 

microhabitats (bulk sediment, rhizosphere and endosphere). The structure and 

composition of sediment bacterial communities appear to be affected by site related 

factors (sediment properties and oil hydrocarbon contamination) and plant related 

factors (exudates composition). Sediment properties (organic content and gran size) 

influence the bioavailability of hydrocarbons (Kim et al., 1999, Wang et al., 2001). 

Moreover, plants can influence the hydrocarbon retention around roots (Ribeiro et al., 

2011) and affect the composition of the microbial community by selecting the 

development of hydrocarbon-degrading microbial population in its rhizosphere. The 

composition of the root exudates released by each plant can underlie the differences of 

diversity and structure of rhizosphere and endosphere communities of study plants. In a 

previous work directed to volatile compounds emissions which compose a relevant 

fraction of root exudates (Steeghs et al., 2004), the high complexity of the chemical 

composition of root-derived material associated to salt marsh plants (Spartina maritima 

and Halimione portulacoides) was demonstrated, indicating that the quality and quantity 

of root derived organic matter may be a relevant driver of bacterial dynamics in salt

marsh sediments. Phillips et al., (2012), suggested that the patterns of exudation 

released by Elymus angustus (wildrye) and Medicago sativa (alfalfa) are the driving 

factors behind the degradation traits of bacteria.  

In terms of degradation potential, the in silico metagenome analysis of 16 sRNA 

gene amplicons obtained in this study showed enrichment of genes involved in the 

process of PAH degradation in the rhizosphere of halophyte plants. The endophytic 

community showed potential degradation capacity with the presence and abundance of 

genes encoding for PAH-degrading enzymes which were plant species/contaminant 

dependent. 

Enrichment cultures of endophytic bacteria were prepared in order to obtain OH-

degrading bacterial strains with potential for later use in the microcosm experiments. 

The endophytic strains retrieved revealed a predominance of Pseudomonas sp. 

Pseudomonas is frequently isolated from oil-contaminated sediments (Ma et al., 2006, 

Gomes et al., 2007), even in other microhabitats oil contaminated of Ria the Aveiro 

(Coelho et al., 2011, Domingues et al., 2013). Same endophytic strains revealed 

degradation potential with an importance of nah genotypes in the PAH degradation in 

salt marsh plants. A dominance of nah-like genotypes in isolates after enrichment with 

naphthalene has been reported (Ma et al., 2006, Ni Chadhain et al., 2006). Plasmid-

mediated mineralization of aromatic hydrocarbon (AH) is a major process of oil 

hydrocarbon biodegradation. So, the horizontal gene transfer mediated by catabolic 

plasmid plays an important role in AH degradation capacity of salt marsh bacterial 

communities. The detection, in same endophytic isolates, of IncP-9 catabolic plasmids, 

a plasmid family known for carrying genes encoding for enzymes involved in 

hydrocarbon degradation, suggests that horizontal gene transfer can drive the spread of 

nah genes in these habitats and probably contribute to the process of bacterial 

endophytic adaptation and in planta OH decontamination. 

Based on the results obtained from the field, the following conclusions can be 

drawn: 

- The structure and composition of microbial communities in salt marsh 

microhabitats (bulk sediment, rhizosphere and endosphere) are affected by site-

related and plant-related factors.  



Conclusions 

103 

 

- Halophyte colonization could be an important driver of the structure of 

hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial community in salt marsh sediments, which can be 

exploited for in situ phytoremediation of OH in salt marsh environments. 

- The culturable fraction of endophytic PAH degraders revealed the presence of 

genetic determinants for hydrocarbon degradation (plasmids and nah genes), 

suggesting a potential ecological role of bacterial-plant symbionts on the process 

of colonization and in plant survival in urban estuarine areas exposed to OH 

contamination.  

 

Microcosm component  

A plant-sediment microcosm experiment was designed in order to 

experimentally manipulate the concentration of a representative aromatic hydrocarbon 

(2-methylnaphthalene) and test if the introduction of an indigenous endophytic 

hydrocarbon-degrading bacterium can reduce contaminant toxicity to plants and 

enhance contaminant degradation.  

Plant condition was not significantly affected by the addition of a moderate 

concentration of 2-methylnaphthalene, leading to the conclusion that Halimione 

portulacoides plants are tolerant to a concentration of 10 µ g g-1. At the end of the 

experiment, the concentration of 2-methylnaphthalene in spiked sediments was reduced 

by approximately 75 %. Phytoremediation studies suggest that plants have the ability to 

stimulate PAH-degrading microorganisms, ultimately enhancing hydrocarbon 

bioremediation (Phillips et al., 2006, Ribeiro et al., 2011). In fact, at the end of the 

experiment, the detection of catabolic genotypes in bacteria from plants corresponding 

to particular microcosm treatments (spiking with 2-methylnaphthalene) suggests that 

hydrocarbonoclastic populations were enriched in response to contamination.  

The use of a microbial inoculant or a consortium, in interaction with plants, to 

promote degradation of hydrocarbon contaminants has been well explored, with a 

variety of results reported in the literature. A genetically modified endophytic strain of 

Burkholderia cepacia was shown to increase the tolerance of Lupinus luteus to toluene, 

while decreasing toluene evapotranspiration (Barac et al., 2004). Another study 

concluded that despite the failure of endophytic inocula to survive in detectable 

numbers, transference of their degradative plasmids to endogenous endophytic

communities occurred (Taghavi et al., 2005). So, the efficient colonization of plants by 

microbial pollutant-degraders can represent a major contribution to plant survival and 

hydrocarbon degradation. The viability and colonization efficiency of an applied strain, 

however, depends on a variety of factors: plant and bacterial genotypes, inoculation 

mode and the physicochemical properties of the soil environment. The inoculation 

method and soil type can exert a major effect on plant growth, bacterial survival and 

activity and hydrocarbon degradation. The importance of inoculation procedures and 

soil type should be considered in the design of efficient phytoremediation applications 

(Afzal et al., 2011, Afzal et al., 2013).  

Based on the results obtained in the microcosm approach the following conclusions 

can be drawn: 

- H. portulacoides can influence the structure of microbial communities by 

selectively enhancing the development of hydrocarbons degrading populations 

that can contribute to hydrocarbon degradation and removal in salt marshes. 

- The enhancement of 2-methylnaphthalene degradation by inoculation of the 

plants with the PAH-degrading endophytic bacteria could not be demonstrated.  

- An efficient colonization of the hydrocarbon-degrading Pseudomonas spp. strain 

can be inferred from the changes imposed on the structure of the indigenous 

endophytic communities, at the end of the microcosm experiment, indicating 

that this strain may be regarded as good colonizer of H. portulacoides roots.
