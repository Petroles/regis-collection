ABSTRACT – (Temporal dynamics of two species of Chaetophoraceae (Chlorophyta) in tropical streams of São Paulo State,
southeastern Brazil). Temporal dynamics of the chaetophoracean green algae Chaetophora elegans (Roth) C.A. Agardh and
Stigeoclonium amoenum Kützing populations was investigated biweekly during late autumn trhough early spring (April to
October) in two tropical streams from northwestern São Paulo State, southeastern Brazil. Abundances of one population of
each species was evaluated by the quadrat technique in terms of percent cover and frequency. The fluctuations were related
to the following stream variables: temperature, turbidity, specific conductance, pH, oxygen saturation, depth, substratum type,
current velocity, irradiance and nutrients. Percent cover and frequency of C. elegans had lower values throughout the study
period and was positively correlated to rainfall. Other correlations (i.e. positive of percent cover with depth and current
velocity and negative with irradiance) were consistently found, reinforcing the strong influence of rainfall. On the other hand,
percent cover and frequency of S. amoenum had higher values, with maximum growth from June to September. Percent cover
was negatively correlated to rainfall. Results suggest the precipitation regime as the most important driving force to temporal
changes in both populations, but playing different roles in each one. The gelatinous thallus of C. elegans seem to be favored
by the increment of current velocity, since higher flows can improve the nutrient uptake by means of reduction in diffusion
shell without promoting excessive drag force. In contrast, tufts of S. amoenum are, presumably, more exposed to drag force,
and, consequently, more susceptible to mechanical damage effects due to higher current velocities.

Key words - Chaetophora, macroalgae, Stigeoclonium, stream, temporal dynamics

RESUMO – (Dinâmica temporal de duas espécies de Chaetophoraceae (Chlorophyta) em riachos tropicais do Estado de São
Paulo, sudeste do Brasil). A dinâmica temporal das algas verdes Chaetophora elegans (Roth) C.A. Agardh e Stigeoclonium
amoenum Kützing foi investigada bimensalmente de final do outono a início da primavera (abril a outubro) em dois riachos da
região noroeste do estado de São Paulo. A abundância (cobertura percentual e freqüência) de uma população de cada espécie
foi avaliada pela técnica de quadrado. A flutuação foi relacionada com as seguintes variáveis ambientais: temperatura, turbidez,
condutividade específica, pH, oxigênio dissolvido, profundidade, tipo de substrato, velocidade da correnteza, irradiância e
nutrientes. Cobertura percentual e freqüência de C. elegans foram baixas durante todo o período e correlacionaram-se positivamente
com precipitação pluviométrica. Outras correlações (positiva de cobertura percentual com profundidade e velocidade da correnteza
e negativa com irradiância) foram consistentemente encontradas, reforçando a forte influência da precipitação. Cobertura
percentual e freqüência de S. amoenum foram altas, com valores máximos entre junho e setembro. Cobertura percentual foi
negativamente correlacionada com precipitação. Os resultados sugerem o regime de precipitação pluviométrica como a mais
importante força influenciadora das mudanças temporais em ambas populações, entretanto, desempenhando diferentes papéis
em cada uma delas. O talo gelatinoso de C. elegans parece ser favorecido por um aumento da velocidade da correnteza, pois
fluxos mais intensos levariam a uma maior eficiência na aquisição de nutrientes, devido à redução no tamanho da concha de
difusão sem, entretanto, provocar atrito excessivo entre a planta e a massa d’água. Em contraste, tufos de S. amoenum são,
presumivelmente, mais expostos e, conseqüentemente, mais susceptíveis à força mecânica gerada pelo aumento da velocidade
da correnteza.

Introduction

Structure of stream macroalgal communities can
be affected by specific environmental variables, such

as current velocity, temperature, substratum type,
light, grazing and water chemistry (Sheath et al. 1989,
E v e r i t t  &amp;amp;  B u r k h o l d e r  1 9 9 1 ,  U e h l i n g e r  1 9 9 1 ,
Rosemond &amp;amp; Brawley 1996). Several studies have
showed that most of these parameters vary seasonally

macroalgal communities (e.g. Pringle 1990, Sheath
&amp;amp; Hambrook 1990, Everitt &amp;amp; Burkholder 1991,
Pfister 1993, Rosemond 1994, Borchardt 1996,
DeNicola 1996, Hill 1996).



C.C.Z. Branco &amp;amp; O. Necchi Junior: Temporal dynamics of Chaetophoraceae152

The green algal family Chaetophoraceae is a well
represented taxonomic group in stream macroalgal
communities worldwide, mainly by species of
Chaetophora and Stigeoclonium (Holmes &amp;amp; Whitton
1981, Entwisle 1989, Biggs 1990, Sheath &amp;amp; Cole
1992, Branco &amp;amp; Necchi Junior 1996a, 1997, Necchi
Junior et al. 2000). However, available information
concerning temporal distribution of these green algae
is still scarce, particularly for tropical regions.
Despite the high frequency of occurrence in stream
habitat communities, temporal analysis of individual
species of Chaetophoraceae are virtually absent in
literature.

Seasonal data on populations of Chaetophoraceae
are mostly reported in broader studies focusing on the
entire macroalgal communities. Some recent
investigations are relevant in this context, including few
carried out in Brazilian lotic ecosystems, such as Necchi
Junior et al. (1991), Necchi Junior &amp;amp; Pascoaloto (1993)
and Branco &amp;amp; Necchi Junior (1997). Similarly, specific
seasonal studies with members of Chaetophoraceae in
running waters are few. Entwisle (1989) described the
seasonal variation in abundance of the Cladophora-
Stigeoclonium communities in two urban creeks from
Australia, showing that the growth pattern of these algae
are distinct year round. Rosemond &amp;amp; Brawley (1996)
found that the species-specific characteristics explain
the persistence of Stigeoclonium tenue (C.A. Agardh)
Kützing in a woodland stream from Tennessee, USA.

Considering the scarcity of information on temporal
dynamics of Chaetophoracean species in stream
environments, this study was taken aiming to describe
the temporal variation patterns of Chaetophora
elegans and Stigeoclonium amoenum populations, in
two streams from the northwest region of São Paulo
State, southeastern Brazil.

Material and methods

The study was carried out in two tropical streams from
the northwest region of São Paulo State, southeastern Brazil.
The population of Chaetophora elegans (Roth) C.A. Agardh
was sampled in Talhadinho Stream, a third-order stream
segment, with continuous rocky substratum, located in São
José do Rio Preto (20º43’ S and 49º13’ W). The population
of Stigeoclonium amoenum Kützing was analyzed in Borá
Stream, also a third-order stream segment with predominantly
rocky substratum, located in the municipality of Cedral
(20º58’ S and 49º25’ W). The sampling sites were visited
biweekly during the typical growth period of the macroalgal
communities in this region (Necchi Junior &amp;amp; Pascoaloto 1993,
Branco &amp;amp; Necchi Junior 1997), extending from late autumn

(28 May - Talhadinho Stream and 26 April - Borá Stream) to
early spring (15 October - Talhadinho and 31 October - Borá
Stream) in 1996. This sampling period was mandatory due
to low abundance, or even lack of plants, during the remaining
of the year not allowing observations and collections for the
purposes of this study.

The sampling sites consisted of a 10 m length stream
segment (Sheath &amp;amp; Burkholder 1985). The abundance of the
populations were estimated by means of the quadrat technique
(Necchi Junior et al. 1995a). Sampling units were circles of
25 cm in diameter (area = 0.05 m2); this shape was adopted
to reduce the edge effect (Krebs 1989). The size of sampling
units was chosen on the basis of preliminary tests and a
previous investigation (Necchi Junior et al. 1995b). Twenty
sampling units were distributed in pairs at 10 equally spaced
intervals along the stream segment, resulting in a total
sampling area of 1 m2 in each collecting date. Within the
sampling units, algal percent cover on the substratum was
estimated visually (Necchi Junior 1993, Branco &amp;amp; Necchi
Junior 1998) with a Plexiglas viewbox (bottom surface ca
175 cm2). We tested the accuracy of percent cover of
Stigeoclonium amoenum against ash-free dry-weight in 15
sampling units consisting of circles 10 cm in diameter (area
ca. 79 cm2) and they proved to be positively correlated
(r = 0.69, p &amp;lt;0.01). Necchi Junior &amp;amp; Branco (1998) also
described, to the red alga Batrachospermum delicatulum
(Skuja) Necchi &amp;amp; Entwisle, positive correlation (r = 0.37-0.54,
p &amp;lt; 0.01) among visual estimation and two usual destructive
techniques (ash-free dry-weight and chlorophyll a).
Therefore, this parameter proved to be reliable for the purpose
of this study. Frequency of occurrence was also calculated,
considering the number of sampling units with algal thallus
to the total units sampled.

Ten plants were randomly collected along the stream
segment for morphometric analysis on each sampling date.
Samples were preserved in 4% formaldehyde (Branco &amp;amp;
Necchi Junior 1996a) for microscopic observation. The
randomization of sites for algal collection was based on the
position indicated by the collector ’s watch hand at
predetermined time intervals (Necchi Junior et al. 1997).

Specimens collected within quadrats were measured for
the following morphometric characters: Chaetophora
elegans, colony diameter, cell length and diameter (main axis)
and apical branch number; Stigeoclonium amoenum, plant
length, cell length and diameter of the main axis and lateral
branches cell length and diameter. These characters were
chosen according to a previous study (Branco &amp;amp; Necchi
Junior 1998). Measurements were made in replicates of 12 for
all morphometric characters.

The following environmental variables were measured:
water temperature, specific conductance, turbidity, pH and
dissolved oxygen, with Horiba U-10 water checker, equipped
with a multiple probe from a water sample collected in
midstream segments at 12:00 ± 1 h. Current velocity was
measured  by using a General Oceanics 2030R mechanical

flowmeter immediately below the water surface, whereas
irradiance was determined with a Li-Cor LI-189 quantameter
and a Li-Cor LI-193SA spherical quantum sensor at the stream
bottom. Nutrients (except total nitrogen and phosphorous)
were analyzed with a Horiba F-24 ion meter and Orion ion
selective electrodes (ammonia, nitrate, nitrite, calcium and
potassium) from a water sample collected at the midpoint of
sampling sites. Total N an P were determined according to
the technique described by Valderrama (1981). Current
velocity, irradiance and depth (with a rule) were measured at
the center of each sampling unit. Substratum type (according
to particle size classes given by Gordon et al. 1992) was also
annotated. Rainfall data for the closest locality of the sampling
site were provided by the Regional Division of the Secretary
of Agriculture, São Paulo State (figure 1). Numerical data
were submitted to the following statistical analyses (Sokal &amp;amp;
Rohlf 1981): Analysis of Variance (ANOVA, one way),
Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient and
multiple regression. Tests were performed by using the
Minitab statistical package (Ryan et al. 1985).

Results

Chaetophora elegans (Roth) C.A. Agardh -
Environmental data (figures 2-3) are described only for
the variables that revealed some relationship with
biological parameters of the population studied.
Temperature varied considerably throughout the study
period (17.1-25.5 ºC, 20.7 ± 2.7, mean ± one standard-
deviation), with the lowest values in early winter and
the highest during early spring. It was positively
correlated with irradiance (r = 0.73, p &amp;lt; 0.01). Specific
conductance varied from 38.6 to 89.2 µS.cm-1 (68.3 ±
15.8) and revealed a similar pattern with temperature
(r = 0.86, p &amp;lt;0.001). Dissolved oxygen had values in
the range of 3.9-6.3 mg.L-1 and was negatively
correlated with temperature (r = -0.73, p &amp;lt;0.01).
Irradiance was high throughout the period, ranging from
1,150 to 2,435 µmol.m-2.s-1 (1,765 ± 705), except for
extremely low values on 28 June (53 µmol.m-2.s-1), due
to rainy conditions. It was negatively correlated with
current velocity (r = -0.84, p  &amp;lt; 0.001). Depth was low
varying from 5.4 to 7.7 cm (6.0 ± 0.9), with lower values
in the peak of winter. Current velocity tended to
decrease along the period (39-74 cm.s-1, 48 ± 11), except
for a peak on 28 June. The potassium concentration
showed a relatively narrow variation, ranging from 15.5
to 20.0 mg.L-1 (16.6 ± 1.3), except for a peak on 28
June, with a slight increase towards the end of the period.
The nitrate concentration, showed a similar pattern with
potassium, with narrow variation (9.6-10.7 µg.L-1, 10.3
± 0.2).

The population of Chaetophora elegans varied
significantly throughout the study period in terms of
percent cover (F = 3.5, p  &amp;lt;0.001) (figure 4), with very
low values, ranging from 0 to 0.9% (0.4 ± 0.3). It was
positively correlated with frequency (r = 0.85, p &amp;lt;0.001)
and precipitation (r = 0.58, p &amp;lt;0.05) and negatively
correlated with nitrate (r = -0.74, p &amp;lt;0.01) and potassium
(r = -0.58, p &amp;lt;0.05). Multiple regression analysis
revealed that precipitation, depth, current velocity and
irradiance, were conjointly responsible for 68% in
percent cover variation of C. elegans population.
Correlations tests of C. elegans abundance with
environmental variables performed to each sampling date
individually showed consistent results. Percent cover
was positively correlated with depth and current velocity
in 33% and 22% of the sampling dates, respectively,
and negatively with irradiance in 33% of samplings.

Frequency showed the same seasonal pattern of
abundance, with low values during the entire period,
from 0 to 60% (29 ± 22) (figure 4). Frequency was

The morphometric characters of Chaetophora

elegans population exhibited the following significant
correlations: cell length was positively correlated with
current velocity (r = 0.72, p &amp;lt;0.01) and negatively with
irradiance (r = 0.82, p &amp;lt;0.01).

Stigeoclonium amoenum Kützing - Environmental data
(figures 5-6) revealed a considerable fluctuation for most

variables. Temperature had values ranging from 16.0 to
24.3 °C (19.6 ± 0.7), with lowest values during June-
August (winter peak) and the highest in September-
October (early spring). It was positively correlated with
specific conductance (r = 0.93, p &amp;lt;0.001). Specific
conductance had values in the range of 74 to 145 µS.cm-1
(103 ± 7.3), with lower values during the winter period
(dry season). Values of dissolved oxygen fluctuated from

4.2 to 6.9 mg.L-1 (5.5 ± 0.3) and were positively
correlated with current velocity (r = 0.57, p &amp;lt;0.05).
Irradiance was high throughout the study period, with
values ranging from 528 to 1,421 µmol.m-2.s-1 (1,039 ±
397), except on 28 June (85 µmol.m-2.s-1) due to rainy
conditions. Depth varied from 19.1 to 25.6 cm (21.8 ±
0.4) and was positively correlated with precipitation (r =
0.60, p &amp;lt;0.05). Current velocity had higher values at

the beginning and end of samplings, and lower values in
the peak of dry season (40-66 cm.s-1, 50 ± 7). ANOVA
showed significant differences for irradiance, depth and
current velocity (F = 8.9-43.3, p &amp;lt;0.001).

The percent cover of Stigeoclonium amoenum
population varied significantly throughout the
sampling period (F = 13.9, p &amp;lt;0.001), ranging from

correlated with proportion of boulders and macrophyte

respectively, whereas in 31% of samplings a negative
correlation with sand-clay substratum was found.

Frequency had a slight variation throughout the
study period with a clear tendency to high values
(85-100%, 92 ± 6.3, figure 7). It was negatively
correlated with temperature (r = -0.75, p &amp;lt;0.01) and
specific conductance (r = -0.64, p &amp;lt;0.05).

No significant correlation of percent cover and
frequency of Stigeoclonium amoenum with nutrients
was found.

The morphometric characters of Stigeoclonium
amoenum population showed the following significant
correlations: main axes cell diameter and length were
negatively correlated with current velocity (r = -0.65,
p &amp;lt;0.05 and r = -0.67, p &amp;lt;0.01, respectively) and

positively with irradiance (r = 0.68, p &amp;lt;0.01 and r = 0.58,
p &amp;lt;0.05, respectively).

Discussion

The temporal dynamics of Chaetophora elegans
was characterized by very low values of percent cover
and frequency throughout sampling period. Similar
seasonal data were previously reported (Necchi Junior
&amp;amp; Pascoaloto 1993), suggesting a consistent pattern for
this species in lotic habitats of this region. Despite the
low values of percent cover of C. elegans, results
indicated a possible influence of precipitation regime,
and its effects, on the population studied, suggesting that
this variable was the driving force most closely related
with temporal variations of species abundance. In
support to this view, some correlations were consistently
observed throughout the sampling period (e.g., positive
with depth and current velocity; negative with
irradiance), corroborating the influence of precipitation
on abundance of C. elegans population.

Precipitation regime has been often described as
an important factor of seasonal changes of macroalgal
communities in lotic ecosystems from tropical regions
in Brazil (Necchi Junior et al. 1991, Necchi Junior &amp;amp;
Pascoaloto 1993, Branco &amp;amp; Necchi Junior 1997). Branco
&amp;amp; Necchi Junior (1997) ascribed the capacity to provoke
change in local environmental conditions and,
consequently, the algal communities to the rainfall in three
tropical drainage systems. Variations in the precipitation
regime could cause indirect effects, mainly related to
the current velocity pattern. Higher values of current
velocity promote two opposite major forces acting on
algal communities (Stevenson 1996): a) a positive force
of stimulation related with increase in the nutrients
uptake; b) a negative drag force tending to brush the
plants downstream. The gelatinous thallus of
Chaetophora elegans seems to be stimulated by a
moderate increase in current velocity that would promote
a reduction of diffusion shell and, consequently, increase
nutrient uptake. On the other hand, the drag force would
be minimized because the filaments are protected from
direct mechanical effects of water flow for being
immersed in a mucilaginous matrix.

Branco &amp;amp; Necchi Junior (1998) investigated
microhabitat distribution and niche width of two
populations of Chaetophora elegans from São Paulo
State. Narrow microhabitat conditions and smaller niche
width of both populations were related to the low
abundance in streams from São Paulo State. In addition,
moderate to high values of current velocity were

suggested as one of the most favorable microhabitat
conditions for development of this species. Therefore,
the typical pattern of low abundance of C. elegans found
in several streams from São Paulo State (Necchi Junior
et al. 1995a, Branco &amp;amp; Necchi Junior 1996b, 1997, 1998),
also found in this study, can be associated to a combination
of microhabitat conditions and seasonal fluctuations
determined by the rainfall regime.

The peak of percent cover and frequency of
Stigeoclonium amoenum population occurred during
driest season (June to September) in studied area. The
percent cover of S. amoenum was negatively correlated
to precipitation, indicating a different influence on the
population than that observed in Chaetophora elegans.
The increase in current velocity induces a higher
mechanical pressure on S. amoenum plants and,
consequently, damage effects. This negative influence
is specially important to this species, which has no
specific morphological adaptation to avoid drag force.

Correlations observed within sampling dates
revealed that substratum type can influence the percent
cover of Stigeoclonium amoenum. Macrophytes and

boulders had consistent positive correlations with
abundance in several sampling dates, revealing the
association to more stable substrata with the population
establishment and maintenance. Coherently, negative
correlations were found of percent cover with an
unstable substratum (sand-clay). Thus, the effects
promoted by precipitation on substratum composition
altering population’s abundance are best viewed as
mechanical interactions related to plants attachment
than as ecophysiological features.

Entwisle (1989) described the extensive growth of
Stigeoclonium during winter and spring, covering most
submerged substrata, but no development into long
massive tufts as in Cladophora during summer. Our
data indicated a similar seasonal pattern of growth, with
the most expressive biomass during winter, but the
possible causes were sharply different. The most
important driving factors pointed out by Entwisle (1989)
were nutrient concentration (such as nitrogen and
phosphorous), substrata availability and a higher diffusion
gradient promoted by rising water levels, and
consequently, faster flowing, helping Stigeoclonium to
out compete Cladophora in early and late season growth.

Rosemond &amp;amp; Brawley (1996) reported that
Stigeoclonium tenue (C.A. Agardh) Kützing had lower
photosynthetic capacity than other algae at high
environmental irradiance and low nutrient levels,
indicating low competitive capacity under these specific
conditions. In addition, the authors suggested that
Stigeoclonium may also become relatively more
susceptible to herbivore when irradiance is increased.
No direct correlation was observed among abundance
of Stigeoclonium amoenum and irradiance or nutrients
in this study, whereas grazing effects have not been
examined. However, there was no evidence of
expressive growth of insect larvae (or other
macroinvertebrates) in the streams analyzed in this study
and, thus, no major influence on Chaetophoracean
species abundance is expected.

A microhabitat investigation (Branco &amp;amp; Necchi
Junior 1998) indicated Stigeoclonium amoenum (as
S. helveticum Vischer) as a generalist species, being
able to support a wide range of microhabitat conditions.
In addition, results of this study suggest that S. amoenum
has also high tolerance to temporal variations.

Morphometric variation in Chaetophora elegans
and Stigeoclonium amoenum plants examined
throughout this study also showed differences between
these Chaetophoracean species. Plants of C. elegans
exhibited weak correlations to morphometric
characteristics and environmental parameters. In

contrast, many correlations were found with
morphometric data and environmental variables in
plants of S. amoenum, suggesting wide morphological
plasticity. Therefore, plants of S. amoenum are
presumably well adapted to the fluctuations in the
surrounding environment by branch reconfiguration
(Sheath &amp;amp; Hambrook 1988). Thus, it takes advantage
in using more efficiently the environmental resources
for their ecological success in lotic ecosystems.
