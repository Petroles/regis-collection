1 ABSTRACT 

1.1 Abstract 

The financial crisis, climate change, earthquakes and global warming, almost made to 

forget about pollution, dry seasons and famine countries. Only the fuel price peak made 

way for us to become aware of resource scarcity, and in general, about global natural 

resources depletion, along with greenhouse effect gases and the exhaustion of earth 

carrying capacity. 

Furthermore, become clear the mankind responsibility for this situation, and mainly the 

economic production models set in motion after World War II, based on cheap natural 

energy sources, but non-renewable. 

At the core of those economic production models are the corporations, and the marketing 

function they perform. So, marketing management plays a determinant role for the 

environmental chaos where we are immersed. The new paradigm of sustainable 

marketing, developed by Professor Donald A. Fuller can reverse this trend, and contribute 

for different production models in respect for the environment. 

The present case study aim to perform a sustainable marketing audit to a product-specific 

in order to: 

1. Perform a sustainable audit to the product-specific; 

2. Assess the product-specific sustainability; 

3. Identify differentiation and innovation measures that can become marketing 

advantages; 

4. Assess the product’s commitment to ecological and social responsibility. 

The new sustainable marketing framework was applied to the capsulated coffee brand 

Delta Q, from the Portuguese coffee industry leading company, DELTA Cafés.

The research produced a clear Delta Q environmental strategic positioning regarding P2 

(Pollution Prevention) and R2 (Resource Recovery) basic sustainable marketing goals. 

It resulted also in a SWOT analysis covering both company and the product-specific, 

regarding every dimension of the production and marketing processes dealing with waste 

generation, which allow devising a future sound sustainable strategy. 

Other research findings were the opportunities to develop marketing advantages through 

Delta Q production and distribution processes differentiation and/or innovation. 

Moreover, the research came to prove the framework operability and allowed the 

identification of important issues for further investigation, like cost-structure impact of the 

sustainable marketing approach, or the internalization of eco-cost into the product’s price.

1.2 Portuguese Abstract (Sumário) 

A crise financeira, as alterações climáticas, os terramotos e o aquecimento global, quase 

fizeram esquecer a poluição, a seca e fome em muitos países. Apenas o pico do preço do 

petróleo, abriu caminho para nos tornarmos conscientes da escassez de recursos e, em 

geral, do esgotamento dos recursos naturais globais, juntamente com os gases com efeito 

de estufa e do esgotamento da capacidade terra. 

Além disso, tornou-se clara a responsabilidade da humanidade para esta situação e, 

principalmente, os modelos de produção económica implementados após a Segunda 

Guerra Mundial, com base em fontes de energia naturais baratas, mas não renováveis. 

No núcleo dos modelos de produção económica estão as empresas, bem como as funções 

de marketing que desempenham. Assim, a gestão de marketing desempenha um papel 

determinante para o caos ambiental em que nos encontramos imersos. O novo paradigma 

do marketing sustentável, desenvolvido pelo Professor Donald A. Fuller, pode inverter 

esta tendência e contribuir para desenvolver modelos de produção diferentes em relação 

ao meio ambiente. 

O objectivo do presente estudo de caso é realizar uma auditoria de marketing sustentável 

para: 

1. Auditar a sustentabilidade do produto-específico; 

2. Avaliar a sustentabilidade do produto-específico; 

3. Identificar medidas de diferenciação e inovação que possam constituir vantagens 

de marketing; 

4. Avaliar o compromisso do produto-específico com a responsabilidade ecológica e 

social. 

A nova abordagem do marketing sustentável foi aplicada à marca de café capsulado Delta 

Q, da empresa portuguesa líder da indústria de café, DELTA Cafés. 



 

10 

Da pesquisa resultou um posicionamento, ambiental e estratégico, claro do Delta Q em 

relação aos objectivos básicos do marketing sustentável: P2 (Prevenção da Poluição) e R2 

(Recuperação de Recursos), como objectivos básicos do marketing sustentável. 

Resultou também uma análise SWOT que abrange tanto a empresa como o produto-

específico, em relação a cada dimensão dos processos de produção e comercialização que 

são responsáveis pela geração de resíduos e, que permitem definir uma estratégia 

sustentável para o futuro. 

Outro resultado da pesquisa foi a identificação das oportunidades para desenvolver 

vantagens de marketing através de diferenciação e inovação do produto e respectivos 

processos de produção e distribuição. 

Adicionalmente, a pesquisa permitiu concluir sobre a operacionalidade da nova 

abordagem do marketing sustentável e identificar questões importantes para futuras 

investigações, tais como o impacto do marketing sustentável na estrutura de custos, ou a 

internalização dos custos ecológicos no processo de formação do preço do produto.

2 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 

This work is dedicated to Beatriz, Miguel and Dinis, who deserve to enjoy the planet as 

much as we have done, and to whom we have the responsibility to assure their education 

and ability for further protecting the earth ecological systems. 

For the accomplishment of this research project, several beloved people have contributed, 

whether with work, ideas, knowledge or hard motivation. To them all I send my deepest 

thanks. For some of them, taking the risk of forgetting someone unintentionally, I would 

like to express my special gratitude: 

The Professors Margarida Duarte, João Mota e Luíz Moutinho, for the scientific thinking, 

they taught me; 

The Professor Carmo Leal for her patience and attention to detail; 

To Nadir for her role in my life and by encouraging the birth of this project; 

To Paula, Wilma and Teresinha for keeping me in my toes to get the job done; 

To my mother for the proper and delicious feeding during the long nights working; 

To Nélia who endured many weekend absences, for listening actively my outbursts and 

for being the person as dear she is. 

I also wish to thank to Delta Cafés team who supported this project with enthusiasm and 

commitment: Rui Miguel Nabeiro (CEO), Marco Miranda (Head of R&amp;amp;D) and Isabel 

Ramalhete (Delta Q PM).  

I do believe that my generation holds a special responsibility before the ones to come and 

for the planet’s future. Never before, was so clear and grounded the harm done by 

mankind to ecosystems due to intensive earth resource exploration and mass industrial 

production. However, ever like the present, was possible to face the challenge of 

reversing the trend and act responsibly on the natural environment. 

It is my firm wish to have contributed to such endeavour, within the marketing field, 

which has been my professional life for the last twenty years.

3 INTRODUCTION 

Contemporary media review patent a changing world, immersed in deep financial and 

energetic (or fuel) crisis, natural cataclysms like earthquakes, tsunamis, and climate 

change, along with dramatic advances in medicine, science and communication 

technologies, in particular. Nevertheless, there are another media news that suggest old 

stories. Like the ones of regional conflicts that keep arising trough all the emerging and 

less developed economies (or countries, for this purpose). Middle and near East, or Sub-

Saharan African countries, continue to face a severe food crisis as for the last thirty years. 

Despite phenomenal economic advancements in Asia's region, some countries do still 

face high rates in child mortality. The same general description could be as well applied 

for middle and far-east, or Central and South America (Latin America). UN estimates that 

more than one thousand million persons were suffering from hunger in 2009, and over 

than two thousand million persons are living with less than one USD per day. 

The need for a new economic growth era, well foreseen by the Brundtland commission 

report for UN back in 1987, is today more needed than ever. However, this growth is to 

be achieved with innovative economic and production models, once the planet’s resources 

(which have sourced prior economic growth during twentieth century) are in danger of 

total depletion. Especially the absence of new reserves of cheap energy sources, like crude 

oil and coal requires sustainable development and growth models. 

Moreover, climate change due to human production activities mainly related to fossil 

fuels burn and other toxic gas emissions by mass industrial activities, determine radical 

new approaches to the problems of economic production and distribution, energy sources. 

This new paradigm provided the foundations for marketing, once part of the problem (by 

the main focus on the demand increase for consumption), to become an active part of the 

solution. This paradigm embodies the Sustainable Marketing approach and provides 

effective tools for marketers to enforce social and ecological responsibilities. 



 

13 

Sustainable marketing audit is the first step for designing a complete strategic sustainable 

marketing plan. It corresponds to the diagnostic task and provides a comprehensive 

interpretation of a company’s stand, commitment and involvement with ecological 

concerns. 

The emergence of greater widespread demand for better living conditions regarding 

fundamental human rights like caloric and vitamin quality feeding; general health care 

and education, along with human development dimensions in order to promote and 

maintain peace, brought the necessary conditions for new social goals. Those goals 

include governance, business and other organizations, both at national and international 

levels. 

A new self conscience has risen into collective responsibility, spreading from self action 

accountability to social and organization responsibility on actions and on resources use 

(human, technical or/and natural). On another side vast regions of the globe remain 

incapable to get rid of tribal conflicts, local or ethnical wars, and to climb the 

development ladder towards human rights respect, democratic elected governments, 

education and general better welfare for the people. It thus became wide exposed to 

natural catastrophes like earthquakes, prolonged dry seasons and extreme food shortage, 

giving place to an endless down-cycle of lesser economic growth, greater poverty, more 

hunger, armed conflicts… and so on. 

Wrapping the human/social issues above, the ecological earth systems become more 

stressed and depleted. Atmospheric pollution reducing solar UV radiation1 protection, 

Ozone layer diminishing, fisheries impoverished, global warming by greenhouse gases 

releases and weather climate change, became too familiar and close jargon, that most of

 Radiation at the longer UV wavelengths of 320-400 nm (nanometers, or billionths of a meter), called 
UV-A, plays a helpful and essential role in formation of Vitamin D by the skin, and plays a harmful 
role in that it causes sunburn on human skin and cataracts in our eyes.

the times none (persons, organizations or governments) really notice and take care, for 

both meaning and tremendous dangerous consequences of not acting. 

International organizations like the UN and the European Commission (also considering 

their respective branches as the World Bank, WHO, UNICEF, the European Investment 

Bank, among others) have called companies, and other non profit and non governmental 

organizations and institutions, to help solving the most critical problems humanity is 

facing nowadays. This involvement of supra-national organizations, enterprises and 

governments has given rise to a multiplicity of concepts and methods of approach to a full 

and detailed diagnosis of what to do, how to make and how to fund what needs to be 

done. It was built so the notion of corporate social responsibility (CSR). 

One can remounts the birthplace of this international movement transverse to 

organizations, companies and governments in the well-known 1987 Brundtland Report 

for the UN commission on the environment and development. This report has identified 

for the first time at a global level, the following issues that confront and resolve, urged to 

ensure the survival of humanity and improving their quality of life: 

 

Table 3.1 - UN’S diagnostics for the need of new growth and development cycle 

1. The absolute difference between the North (developed) and the South 
(still in development); 

2. The incapacity of the latter to provide minimum levels of welfare to 
launch their own development processes, especially in the areas of food, 
health, education, economic growth and viable investments; 

3. The need to protect the environment and stop the depletion of natural 
resources of the planet in order to ensure the future generations welfare; 

4. The need to launch a new era of growth/economic development with a 
new production model that respects the environment, based on 
technology that would ensure the welfare of humanity without 
exhausting natural resources or impair life ability, (which is) reducing 
and preventing pollution. 

 



 

15 

This is the concept of sustainability at a global scale and constitutes the foundation for 

organizations and business companies’ new paradigm. As well as for development of 

economic activities/production on a global scale and in a comprehensive manner ranging 

from the private issues to public or governmental, characterized by:  

 

Table 3.2 - New marketing management decision boundaries 

• Responsibility for the living conditions of future generations; 

• Respect for the environment; 

• Steady (and sustainable) economic growth. 

 

Confirming the relevance of the diagnosis it came to check on global warming and 

ecological disasters resulting in carrying capacity2 exhaustion (and almost extinction of 

some species) of the once considered inexhaustible ocean; continued power crisis; 

inability of an expanded group of countries to launch and sustain their own development 

processes and economic/social growth, and even democratic government systems. 

Weather climate change caused long dries followed by formidable storms and floods. The 

map of world hunger in the report of the World Food Program from UN for 2009 outlines 

the following scenario of world population suffering from hunger: 

 
Table 3.3 - UN 2009 world hunger map 

Asia and Pacific 642 million 

sub-Saharan Africa 265 million 

Latin America and the Caribbean 53 million 

North Africa and Near East 42 million 

Total 1.002 million 

 

                                                 
2 Carrying capacity refers to the number of individuals who can be supported in a given area within 

natural resource limits, and without degrading the natural social, cultural and economic environment 
for present and future generations. Global development research centre: 
http://www.gdrc.org/uem/footprints/carrying-capacity.html, 14-03-2011.

These figures account for almost 15% of world population! Global communications and 

international financial flows allowed to spread to the world the banking system's crisis, 

otherwise it would only be a USA national problem, with limited impact on some more 

exposed economies. In reality, the less developed economies are also suffering with the 

alien greed. 

On another hand, the success achieved with the global fight against aerosols with CFC´s3, 

which were to degrade the ozone layer4, confirmed that humanity already has (at least in 

some cases) the diagnostics capabilities and effective tools for intervention/resolution of 

environmental problems at a worldwide scale. 

Recent diagnostics, well grounded on valid scientific research, demonstrated economic 

and business downgrade due to natural resources exhaustion. Despite the widespread 

appeal from civil society, academia and a few politicians, the production models of the 

past century (based on the intensive exploitation of natural resources and non-renewable 

energy sources), still remain active and facing strong barriers to be abandoned. 

Resistances to change is forceful and only recently have been conceptualized models to 

accelerate necessary change in a world that is also changing the dynamics of economic 

and business growth, social and ethical behaviour, and new life standards that people and 

organizations aim to satisfy.   

                                                 
3  CFC's – Chlorofluorocarbons are a family of non-reactive, non-flammable gases and volatile liquids. 

Because of their properties they are used in a multitude of applications… The non-reactivity of CFC's, so 
desirable to industry, allows them to drift for years in the environment until they eventually reach the 
stratosphere. High in the stratosphere intense UV solar radiation severs chlorines off of the CFC's, and it is 
these unattached chlorines that are able to catalytically convert Ozone molecules into Oxygen molecules.

4  According to latest data from SCAR – Scientific Committee on Antarctica Research and NASA 

Ozone Hole Watch, ozone hole over Antarctica has been effectively dropping after the original 
Montreal Protocol was signed in the fall of 1987, based on negotiations started between European, 
Scandinavian countries and the USA over CFC's in aerosol sprays in 1983. The protocol has gone 
through a series of revisions […] as new information from science and industry has become available. 
The latest one, held in Copenhagen in November of 1992, laid down the most stringent CFC phase-
out schedule for CFC's for the world to date; and was signed by over 100 nations representing 95% of 
the world's current CFC consumption. http://www.nas.nasa.gov/About/Education/Ozone/history.html,

The growing needs and increasing desires of consumers, given the new paradigm of 

sustainable development and the emergence of CSR, clearly defines the fresh context and 

boundaries for management and marketing management decisions for companies and 

professionals with responsible attitudes in face of the renewed challenges. 

According to several authors (Fuller, 1999; Van Dam and Apeldoorn, 1996 and Porter, 

1991) sustainable marketing (considering marketing as the main management approach to 

daily business decision trough competitive and successful companies) is the most 

appropriate framework to ensure:

• Compliance with the new restrictions (and opportunities) on environment 
and ecology. 

• Meeting consumer-markets and business growing demand. 

• Effective Social Responsibility actions. 

 
 
The decisive importance of these issues has received considerable attention of the 

academy, translated into a vast output of research and thesis. The most prevalent 

marketing approaches to CSR and environmental issues have been on the differentiation 

and communication of companies and brands associated with social causes. These 

promotion efforts aim to obtain some marketing differentiation or to leverage advantages, 

trough advertising on green or environment friendly features. This is the paradoxical5 case 

of BP re-branding from British Petroleum to Beyond Petroleum, or the case of Portuguese 

electricity producer EDP massive advertising and international recognition on green 

company and major renewable energy producer, but who, nevertheless, still operates coal 

and fuel power plants.

 Paradox – …group of premises apparently indisputable leading to inacceptable or contradictory 
conclusions. (Blackburn, Simon, The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy, , Oxford university Press, 
1994).

According to Ottman (2006) aside from offering environmental benefits that do not meet 

consumer preferences, green marketing myopia can also occur when the products fail to 

provide credible, substantive benefits for environment. Which become ecological and 

managerial useless for as much as those strategies fail to prevent pollution, waste stream 

generation, nor promoting resource recovery (Fuller and Gillett, 1999), and fail to achieve 

company’s marketing targets. 

The present research assumes the stand point about sustainability construct as 

environmental based, and wish to investigate the impact of the new ecological decision 

boundaries in the marketing management processes to produce better (or improved) 

environmental-friendly products, benefits and to reduce waste generation, without losing 

of sight the traditional marketing management objectives. 

 

4 RESEARCH OBJECTIVES 

At the heart of productive activity and trade of goods and services is the MARKETING, 

which has gained preponderance increasingly dilated in the daily management of business 

(Kotler and Keller, 2005). Therefore, the marketing is in the pivotal position to enter and 

lead this paradigm shift of production operations and of marketing decisions across 

businesses. (Fuller, 1999). By evolving towards sustainable marketing, companies can 

pursue their traditional goals within a new ethical6 framework defined by the new social 

responsibility and environmentally sustainable principles.

 Ethics - (from the Greek ethos, character) Study of the concepts involved in practical reasoning: good, 
right action, obligation, virtue, freedom, choice. Ethics of Management - The branch of ethics that 
analyzes the problems and dilemmas created by the practices of management, for example, the social 
responsibilities of enterprises, the appropriate limits acceptable to the competition(Blackburn, Simon, 
The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy, Oxford university Press, 1994).

4.1 Sustainable marketing case study objectives 

The present work, under a case study approach method, holds four central objectives to 

achieve. The first is to perform a product-specific sustainable marketing audit. The second 

is to perform a sustainable marketing diagnostic. The third deals with the possible 

identification of improvements/innovations which can become a product’s (or company's) 

of marketing differentiation or advantages. And the fourth is the assessment of the 

company’s commitment to ecological responsibility. These objectives are fully detailed in 

the following chapters. 

 

4.1.1 Product-specific sustainable marketing audit 

Present research substantiates the implementation of the new approach proposed in 1999 

by professor Donald A. Fuller from University of Central Florida – College of Business 

Administration, in his book “Sustainable Marketing: Managerial - Ecological Issues”, 

1999, in a sustainable marketing audit to a product-specific. In this case, to the Portuguese 

capsulated coffee brand Delta Q, to assess the brand’s compliance with sustainable 

marketing decision’s boundaries: 

1) Compatibility with the ecosystem; 

2) Product-System Life-Cycle (PSLC) of the product; 

3) Respect for the balance of ecosystems7, in all marketing management decisions. 

The fundamental research question the study aspires to investigate is to discover and 

describe how Delta Q operationalize sustainability, in order to achieve business goals in 

balance with the new boundaries for marketing management regarding the environment.

 “Ecosystem is a complex system composed of two elements in constant interaction: (1) an 
environment of a physical-chemical (moisture + light + salinity + temperature + pressure + soil + ...), 
abiotic (without human influence), and well delimited in space and time, which is called Biotope, and 
(2) the set of living beings, or Biocenosis that inhabits this biotope. It is the basic functional element 
of the biosphere. It is maintained by a flow of energy and matter between these different components 
in permanent interaction.” Isabel Mendes, 2010, Seminar "Valuing Nature", ISEG, January 13, 2010 



 

20 

Another important issue to research is to find out if operationalization and investment on 

systemic controls to manage and monitor the marketing management paradigm towards 

social responsibility and sustainability can somehow, re-engineer the business model and 

processes to achieve better efficiency and profitability. 

A third issue the present research also aims is to help defining a new set of tools to assess 

global products, services and business performance and results, not only trough the fine 

monitoring of ecologic and social boundaries to be respected but, and most important to 

produce and deliver increased value (throughout the value-chain) to customers, 

stakeholders, shareholders, and environment. 

 

4.1.2 Sustainable marketing diagnostic 

The sustainable marketing audit will allow setting the current position of the product-

specific environmental strategy in the matrix of environmental reinvented or improved 

product’s strategic guidance, with regard to the basic strategies of the new paradigm: 

 

Table 4.1 - Management basic goals 

P2 
Pollution Prevention 

R2 
Resource Recovery 

 

To do so, will be used a marketing audit check-list expanded by sustainable marketing 

principles and assumptions: the ISO 14001 (International Standards Organization) norm, 

the GEMA (Global Environment Management Audit) audit check lists, CSR Europe 

sustainable marketing management principles and EMAS (Environmental Management 

Audit Scheme) audit checklists. 

P2 goals (and subsequent strategies) deal with actions and projects to prevent pollution. It 

is a proactive set of measures to act before pollution and waste are generated. Of course it 

also contains steps and programs aimed for reducing waste/pollution or to increase waste 



 

21 

recyclability (and sometimes reuse) or pollution treatment or further sequestration. 

Effective P2 strategies reduce the need for future heavy R2 actions or investments. 

R2 goals (and subsequent strategies) consist of corrective measures on current products 

and processes in order to consume lesser resources or to incorporate already used 

resources (re-use) from the product’s processes (or from other product production 

processes). Hence, in a certain way, R2 strategies also can help effectiveness of prior P2 

goals. Moreover, proper P2 strategies make easier to achieve R2 goals. Taking together 

P2 and R2 strategies reinforce each other goal achievement; therefore, they are 

fundamental to a successful sustainable marketing strategy. 

 
Figure 4.1 - P2 and R2 reinforcement cycle 

 

 
The diagnostic resulting from the sustainable marketing audit will permit an in depth and 

comprehensive knowledge and understanding of company’s position and effective use 

and respect for social and ecologic boundaries, particularly as regards to: 

1) Respect for the environment, in terms of preventing pollution (P2) and resource 

recovery (R2); 

2) Responsibility for the living conditions of future generations; 

3) The extent to which is possible to attain a constant and sustainable economic 

growth. 



 

22 

With this characterization is possible to identify company’s strengths to draw a successful 

sustainable strategy able to deliver increase value for customers, company and 

environmental protection. 

 

4.1.3 Identification of differentiating improvements/innovations 

The audit should also allow identifying the strengths and weaknesses for the product (or 

sometimes for the company), which compared with the external macro environment 

(constraints and opportunities) may set the bearing for the future sustainable marketing 

strategy of product-specific audited. 

Another source of differentiation that sustainable marketing audit method can provide, 

relates to product’s (or product’s subsidiary) utility or benefits enhancement. Distribution 

systems and packing processes and requirements can also constitute important sources of 

marketing differentiation strategies and even lowering cost structures. 

 

4.1.4 Assessment of company’s commitment to ecological responsibility 

The product-specific sustainable marketing audit process should allow to understand, 

through documentation content analysis, the company involvement with ecological 

responsibility. Detailed content analysis of the interviews will provide some "indicators" ( 

essentially qualitative), which will assess the degree of CSR and sustainable marketing 

integration on decision-making processes of marketing, management (including top-

management) and employees in general, on a day-to-day basis. 

 

4.2 Case study, the scientific contribution   

This research project on sustainable marketing has it main contribution to the level of 

Strategic Marketing Planning, once it is an empirical test for the strategic marketing 



 

23 

planning, development and implementation for a product-specific under this enhanced 

diagnosis and strategic planning framework. 

The final report shows a clear characterization of the current position of the product-

specific audited in accordance with the new model of marketing management 

development and decision, with regard to P2 and R2 goals. 

Another expected result is to identify the strengths of the marketing process and 

associated opportunities, to serve as a starting point for the construction of the strategic 

marketing planning for Delta Q. 

As far as it could be ascertained, the application of this method of strategic sustainable 

marketing diagnostic is unprecedented in Portugal, hence its importance emerges also 

from the ability to provide effective tools to make incremental changes on everyday 

marketing management decisions, thus incrementing profitability and reducing the 

ecological footprint. 

Let's assume for a moment that a leading company from a bigger market than the 

Portuguese, by restructuring its distribution operations based on lorry logistics by better 

on-line purchase orders and rationalized distribution routes, achieves a 10% diesel saving. 

Thus after a complete financial year, company would evidence increased profits. 

As a result it would reward shareholders with larger profit distribution, and stock prices 

would also be higher, providing company with better funding options. 

At the same time trough, an active partnership strategy with the software provider based 

on international positive referral, other industry companies from abroad start to replicate 

the project and achieve identical diesel savings on their operations. If the model could be 

replicated for other industries and markets, soon there would be a global diesel demand 

decrease. 

The benefits are self evident: increased company’s profitability, higher stock prices, larger 

and cheaper funding availability, less energy consumption, lesser carbon monoxide 



 

24 

emissions and negative demand pressure on oil markets that would eventually redound in 

oil prices dropping. 

The power of incremental improvements lies in their total sum. The result of these 

improvements in each industrial process, in each distribution system, in the way a product 

is consumed or disposed, towards environmental protection, or lesser waste generation, or 

fewer natural resources used, will end up in major impact on ecosystem balance, in 

human environmental life quality, and at the end in a better and sustainable planet.  

Sustainable marketing framework for strategic marketing planning and decision can ignite 

a virtuous cycle of change to foster greener products, with more benefits for consumer 

and less ecological impact. This innovative approach can effectively be the cradle for a 

new growth era, based on respect for environment and people who need it to the pursuit 

of life quality and well being. 

 

5 RESEARCH METHOD 

The selected approach is the case study method. Although research based on case studies 

is acceptable for a relatively short time in the Portuguese universities, in other foreign 

universities it has been practiced for long and accepted as a methodology for valid 

scientific research, with valuable and robust findings. Such is the case of Harvard 

University and countries like Sweden or Finland (Carson, Gilmore, Perry, and Gronhaug, 

2001). 

The absence of previous publications or other case studies in a relevant field or discipline 

as new as sustainable marketing is, suggested the need for an exploratory study aimed at 

defining the precise contours of the management problem and the implications for 

marketing management processes development. 



 

25 

Developing solid exploration work will enable the preliminary knowledge body to 

strengthen further quantitative approaches, which might allow the development of models 

to support and enhance the process of decision making in the context of strategic planning 

for sustainable marketing and environmental responsibility. 

The opportunity for a descriptive study, according to Malhotra and Birks (2006), also 

emerges from the need of studying and interpreting the phenomena within the business 

environment, where sustainable marketing processes and decisions are made. 

The essence of daily management interaction with whole stakeholders is particularly 

suitable to case study research, once it allows investigating and documenting the 

involvement of people in the dynamic environment of the phenomena, not running the 

risk of ignoring their capacity to reflect on the problems of the situation and interact on 

them (Robson, 1993). 

Case study research does not necessarily follow a rigid positivist stand, based on the 

strength of phenomena observation to extract patterns and theories, which are assured 

through quantitative internal and external validity (Campbell, and Stanley, 1963). 

However, it neither means that the preference for a more qualitative approach to the study 

of phenomena associated with the marketing strategies development is a pure relativistic 

interpretation of individual cases, regarding social and ecological responsibility. 

Considering that any type of business optimization or decision-making support is 

necessarily contingent and the result of systemic processes, the approach through case 

studies ensures a degree of neutrality between the two paradigms, providing a 

comprehensive interpretation of the phenomenon in its real context (Myers, 2000). 

 



 

26 

5.1 Case study protocol 

Case study method approach holds only one similarity with a survey-questionnaire: both 

aim to a single data collection (Yin, 2009). Beyond that, everything is different and 

complies with distinct objectives and requirements. A case study protocol contains the 

objectives, the rules and procedures to be respected in the process of comprehensive data 

gathering. 

Moreover, it is to be used by the researcher as a kind of a “script” and not to be presented 

to the subject interviewed has a means of answer registry. Thus the case study protocol is 

a major way to increase the research robustness and reliability (Yin, 2009). 

Following is the protocol developed for the present research on Delta Q sustainability 

assessment and positioning against P2 (pollution prevention) and R2 (resource recovery) 

basic goals for sustainable marketing:

5.2 Marketing audit checklists advantages 

According to early definitions of marketing audit, such as Schuman (1959), a marketing 

audit is a systematic, critical and impartial review and appraisal of the whole marketing 

operation's structure, which comprehends the basic marketing objectives and the policies 

implemented to achieve them. 

Kotler and Kelller (2006) still go much in the same direction as prior author definitions 

considering that a marketing audit is a comprehensive, systematic, independent and 

periodical assessment of environment, strategies, objectives and marketing operations of a 

company, in order to find problematic issues and opportunities as well as to recommend 

an action plan examination to improve marketing performance. 

Its primary purpose is to identify under-utilized marketing resources and generate 

recommendations for ways in which more effective use could be made of these resources 

(Brownlie, 1993). 

The present research in the light of the new environmental and social responsibility 

paradigm, aims to identify the environmental protection and sustainability development 

commitment level of the company, regarding people and natural resources. To achieve 

this goal the research makes use of the sustainable marketing audit checklists, within the 

framework of sustainable marketing approach. 

The use of audit checklists is widespread and is a common approach to classical 

marketing audits. According to Brownlie (1993) it comprises the following advantages: 



 

31 

1) Using already audited and grounded as important issues to investigate; 

2) It assures no important issue is omitted; 

3) It encompasses background philosophy and theories, important for the goals of 

the auditing process. Moreover, the use of checklists provides a simple scheme 

and complete data-set to compare to other audits and benchmark. 

Nevertheless, a product-specific sustainable marketing audit is essentially a qualitative 

and interpretative approach to understand clearly the ecological burden posed by the 

product, due to its production, marketing and consumption; and determining the product’s 

position in the strategic environmental matrix in order to draw a suitable and effective 

sustainable marketing plan. Hence sustainable marketing audit to a product-specific 

should be conducted by fully understanding each stage of the product (regarding PSLC) 

against P2 and R2 goals. 

The present work does not conclude with a set of statistical analysis on the audit 

checklists answers gathered, like Brownnlie (1993) proposed. It rather presents a relevant 

interpretation of product (and company) level of sustainability commitment, or in other 

terms, the ecological impact of product’s utility. Hence findings about resources use and 

waste generation, became classified as strengths/weaknesses or opportunities/threats, 

depending on the firm ability to implement realistic P2 and/or R2 solutions as a marketing 

response (Fuller, 1999). 

 

5.3 Qualitative study and content analysis 

The use of content analysis method is especially adequate for the purpose of the present 

research due to its descriptive and exploratory nature, reinforced for the novelty of the 

framework applied. Content analysis is the logical method for such a qualitative research, 



 

32 

since it aims to interpret and gain full perception of a given reality or process dynamics 

(Krippendorf, 1980 and Weber, 1990). 

The present exploratory work aims to position the product-specific in the P2/R2 strategic 

matrix in order to determine the range of strategies available for planning an adequate 

sustainable marketing plan. However, since there are no prior works of the same nature 

regarding P2 and R2 positioning, or even a solid set of indicators to benchmark against, 

thus falls inevitably in the qualitative data analysis by means of relational analysis 

towards gaining full understanding of the sequential stages of product, from the cradle to 

grave, i.e. from green coffee to used capsule collection and dreg valorization. 

As exploratory work, full description of the phenomena is critical inasmuch as further 

work and research can be grounded on a robust management problem definition, 

completely documented and clearly explaining how each selected issue is related in the 

product's processes. 

Multiple sources of evidence were used to achieve comprehensive understanding of 

responsibility and environmental policies implemented by DELTA. Primary main 

documental source was the annual reports from the company: accounting reports from 

2003 to 2009, and responsibility reports from 2004/2005, 2006/2007 and 2008/2009. 

Another important primary source was the deep guided interviews with the Innovation 

and research manager from DELTA, using the audit checklists as a guide in order to fully 

understand each issue on its own, and in relation with the overall Delta Q production and 

marketing processes, which resulted in more than six hours of tape recordings that were 

subsequently analysed and registered in chapter 9. 

Accounting data was assembled in the form of summary tables (presented on chapter 12 – 

Attachments) covering balance sheet and P&amp;amp;L8 account aggregates, followed by main 

                                                 
8 P&amp;amp;L stands for profit and losses. 



 

33 

profitability and financial indicators. This data set was brought for the report body and 

analyzed in chapter 9 under graphical presentation for easier trend perception and 

company performance evaluation. 

Secondary documental sources like magazine articles, interviews and company press 

releases were also used. They are listed in the bibliography and there enclosed copies in 

the case study box. 

 

6 SUSTAINABILITY 

Despite sustainability being nowadays widespread from media to technical and academic 

works, there is a large latitude for the term use. Therefore, a detailed review of the 

concept and its evolution is further developed in order to restrain the concept definition 

central for present research.  

In the present work, the term “sustainability” does not refer to the economic, tax, social 

security or financial ability to self-support in following years. For this research, the term 

sustainability means the global ecosystem ability to regenerate and survive, despite the 

human activity's harmful impact on them. 

As it will be further discussed, environmental sustainability can be positively impacted 

and enhanced trough incremental innovations and behaviour changes, as long as they are 

integrated, designed and implemented from an early project stage. The necessary manner 

and framework for marketing management to accomplish such a goal is discussed in the 

following chapters. 

 

6.1 The Corporate Social Responsibility 

Recent years have been fruitful in bringing into the focus of media, international 

conferences and legislation, issues related to CSR. One can find it everywhere, from the 



 

34 

NGOs9 to the internationally academic production. At the time of this writing, Google 

lists 301.000 entries to the term "Corporate Social Responsibility” in Portuguese 

language. The same search in English language returns no less than 7.300.000 entries. 

When one think of the meaning of the term, it seems clear that it refers to the 

responsibility that companies should have in society. This is, regarding people. However, 

people are the world! A company cannot be responsible for the world. Or, can it? To what 

extent could this responsibility belong to business companies? 

The term "corporate social responsibility" was coined by H. R. Bowen in 1953, with a 

view of social obligation. In this early meaning, companies should pursue policies, take 

decisions or follow the line of action which is desirable in terms of values and goals for 

the society (Turker, 2009). In 1979, Archie B. Carroll set out three main areas of 

obligations in respect of CSR, resumed in the following table: 

 
Table 6.1 - Definition of corporate social responsibility 

1. Economic obligations- economically viable producing; 

2. Legal and ethical obligations - compliance with laws and recognition of social 
norms and values; 

3. Philanthropic obligations- proactively return to society. 

 

In the mid-nineties of the XX century, many authors have argued that the term 

"obligation" was insufficiently precise to be applied effectively in the management of 

corporate social responsibility (Clarkson, 1995; Donaldson and Preston, 1995). Therefore, 

it was suggested that the companies would have to be accountable for society, not as a 

                                                 
9
 NGO’s – Non-governmental organizations are generally considered to be a non-state, non-profit, 

voluntary organization. As a non-state entity, an NGO is generally independent from government 
influence and either not established by a government, or intergovernmental agreement, or, if 
established in such a manner, is not independent of such influence. As a non-profit organization, 
or "nonprofits distributing," an NGO does not distribute profit to its partners. (NGO Handbook, 
http://www.ngohandbook.org/ 
index.php?title= What_are_Non-Governmental_Organizations_(NGOs)%3F), 17/02/2011. 



 

35 

whole, but only to those who are directly or indirectly affected by the company's 

operations. They are called "stakeholders"10; Henriques and Sadorsky (1999) divided 

them into four groups: 

 

Table 6.2 - Stakeholder groups 

1. Organizational - employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders; 

2. Community - local residents, special interest groups and generic; 

3. Regulators - local/national legislators and standards (at local, national, and 
international perspectives); 

4. Media Stakeholders. 

 

A more structured corporate social responsibility understanding was won and therefore, 

liable to be (better) managed. Still, business continues towards a concept which focuses 

on the interests of the company (Jones, 1995), which lacks intrinsic motivation for the 

implementation and enforcement, as an active operating and decision-making model. 

Measures of flexibility towards employees or philanthropic activities and donations to 

charities, may well be the only way a company has to act according to the social norms 

and value systems in each location and cannot move from a paternalistic expression of 

corporate power (Swanson, 1995). 

The various presented approaches regarding the concept of social responsibility 

demonstrate the wide interpretive latitude that the concept still has, even after more than 

fifty years passed over its creation. Even though others have identified this gap (or flaw) 

and argued that the concept of social responsibility requires being better operationalized 

                                                 
10

 Stakeholders - This concept refers to the idea that the company's operations depend on the interaction 
of various groups and individuals, whose result is greater than the sum of the parts and include: 
customers, shareholders, employees, suppliers, government, competitors and others (Charter, Martin; 
Peattie, Ken; Ottman, Jacqueline and Palonsky, Michael J. 2002). 



 

36 

through the assessment and management of the environment, as a way of reaching a stage 

of pro-active social responsibility. (Wartick and Cochrane, 1985; Wood, Donna J. 1991). 

Moreover, the many definitions of CSR seem to wind up a redundancy, especially if one 

defines marketing as the process of meeting the needs of consumers, where they want, 

which way they prefer, with the necessary information and the appropriate price to 

remunerate the factors involved in meeting these needs (Kotler and Keller, 2005). So the 

corporate social responsibility is fulfilled by the prosecution of the marketing 

management process by itself. Thus marketing management already should be aligned 

with social responsibility and environmental protection objectives. 

 

6.2 Triple Bottom Line 

More recently, with the advent of the so-called NGO’s in the field of cooperation and 

development, it was possible to understand and operationalize the concept of CSR. Three 

guiding principles of the operation and management processes arise: 

1) Social - employees, customers, local communities, respect for legal and cultural 

values;  

2) Respect for the environment; 

3) Economic - to maintain and ensure the economic viability/financial operations of 

the company. 

 

In short, those issues can be referred as TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE: People, Planet and 

Profit. 

Marc J. Epstein (2008) in his landmark book "Making Sustainability Work" presents the 

interpretation of this approach by pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk's in relation to 

its business unit of biopharmaceuticals for diabetes:

Novo Nordisk's "search to conduct its business in an economically viable, socially 

responsible and environmentally balanced, and believe, they will be a leader in diabetes 

care, will create value for patients and their stakeholders.” (Epstein 2008). 

According to Williams, E. (2008), CSR Europe, an organization that gathers and works 

directly with businesses companies, governments and other organizations concerned with 

social responsibility in Europe, sustainability has been the central concern of the actions 

and initiatives of CSR. 

 

6.3 Sustainability and Sustainable Development 

So what is sustainability? The definition in the largest dictionary of the Portuguese 

language: "Novo Aurélio, Séc. XXI" tell us that sustainability is "Sustainable Quality". In 

turn, one of the definitions of “sustainable” that interests the most in this research project, 

tells that it is "what it can support" or what "it can keep more or less constant or stable for 

a long time." Nevertheless, for the purposes of this research work, will be used the 

definition proposed by Brundtland Commission Report (1987) for the Committee on 

Environment and Development of the United Nations (Chapter 3, Paragraph 27): 

 



 

38 

 “Humanity has the ability to make development sustainable to ensure 

that it meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability 

of future generations to meet their own needs.” 

 

Furthermore, the report casts a light for more detailed understanding, stating “the concept 

of sustainable development does imply limits – not absolute limits but limitations 

imposed by the present state of technology and social organization on environmental 

resources and by the ability of the biosphere to absorb the effects of human activities. 

However, technology and social organization can be both managed and improved…”  

Hence sustainable development aims to meet the needs and aspirations of the present 

without compromising the needs and aspirations of the future. Far from requiring the 

cessation of economic growth, it recognizes that the problems of poverty and 

underdevelopment cannot be solved “…without a new era of growth ..." (Brundtland 

Report, Chapter 3, Paragraph 28). 

Thus, one can find a unique bridge between the need for ethical commitment of 

production operations and marketing decisions and business responsibility towards the 

environment, generally referred to as ecosystems and the imperatives of sustainable 

development. 

During the evolution of humanity, different models of consumption and production have 

evolved. Since the trade in spices arrived in Europe by caravans that crisscrossed the 

deserts and mountains of near and far east and impeding in Europe by Genovese 

merchants and ports. 

The later entry of the Portuguese in this lucrative trading, launching the Cape route 

(former route of Good Hope cape, now Cape Town) allowed the reduction of spices price 

in Europe, as well as their consumption increase. 



 

39 

Finally, with the industrial revolution of the steam engine and later the internal 

combustion engine, there were no restrictions on production or scarcity of resources, and 

only the economic power of markets limited their access to goods that they needed or 

demanded (Smith, 1776). 

The turn to the twentieth century, came to change this paradigm, although mankind only 

realized that, on the last two decades of the century. 

As the following figure evidence, the world population has suffered an explosion from the 

last quarter of the nineteenth century, growing more than six times in just little over a 

hundred years. Estimating is currently circa 7.000 million and is projected at 9.200 

million people by mid-century (Robinson, 1998 and US Census Bureau – International 

Database, 2010).

Concurrent with the population explosion there was a revolution of wealth and economic 

production systems associated in order to respond to growing demand on basic needs like 



 

40 

food, clothing, transport, education and health. Two major exogenous factors have 

contributed: 

1) Technical and scientific development in conjunction with novel robust economic 

and management theories, which together made the way for spectacular business 

efficiency and national governments economic policy outcomes; and  

2) The extraordinary production effort done by the United States of America, during 

Second World War, and the replication of the formula later, for Europe 

reconstruction. 

Those factors together provided the ideal conditions for amazing economic and well fair 

growth of the so-called western democracies, starting 1950 as following figures clearly 

evidences:

The damage caused to the environment resulting from the need to nurture the systems of 

production and consumption developed in the meantime, became a worldwide problem, 

both in its causes and in its consequences. 

Corporations are the prevailing institutions on the planet, and thus have to deal (also) with 

the social and environmental problems that afflict humanity (Hawken, 1993). According 

to Fuller (1999), dealing with these problems means finding solutions to problems arising 

from the following models of production and consumption that have become widespread 

across the planet over the last hundred years: 

 

Table 6.3 - Issues to be managed by marketing 

1. Facilities - Operated in the environment by mining, logging, fisheries, 
intensive agriculture, among others; 

2. Production/Processing - goods processed in factories and consumer 
goods/investment that fuel the trade and the global economy;  

3. Waste - collective costs to industry, consumers, environment, societies 
and economies based on consumption and waste, generating pollution and 
natural resource depletion and environmental destruction. They represent 
the so-called “eco-costs”. 

 

Those production models could be translated into three basic questions: What it takes? 

What it makes? And what it wastes? 

These are, according to Hawken (1993), the main challenges that companies have to face, 

and correspond inexorably to questions and issues that are manipulated by the processes 

of marketing management decisions. Not only the classical economic approach, assuming 

infinite natural resources, thereby without any value, as neither the neo-classical theories, 

trusting money supply and price dynamics to reflect upon markets the scarcity or 

abundance of a given resource, no one really considered the effective depletion of critical 

resources for economic and human kind survival, like water. Thus it was not taken into 



 

42 

account resource scarcity or further on the outcomes of consumer needs satisfaction: the 

associated waste production streams. 

 

6.4 Sustainable Marketing  

The marketing has to embrace the whole issue of sustainability and make their processes 

and activities sustainable. Like ecological systems in homeostasis11, organisms and plants 

using minerals, water and other organisms in continuous and interdependent processes 

that generate waste and are further processed into food and fuel for a new cycle. 

Thus, marketers must operate under the same principles. Its processes consume resources 

and generate waste, while delivering value and benefits to consumers and organizations. 

Now, a concern with environmental/ecological in order to maintain its balance 

(homeostasis) or even enrichment, is arising and gaining social, business and 

governments attention12. 

The term "Sustainable Marketing" was coined by Sheth and Parvatiyar in 1995 and tried 

to identify the manner and mean to reconcile economic, ecological and environmental 

issues, through the reinvention of production systems and the products themselves (Fuller, 

1997). Other terms and names have been used, such as "Ecological Marketing" (Henion, 

1976)", Green Marketing" (Ottman, 1993), "Environmental Marketing" (Coddington, 

1993), "Eco-Marketing" (Fuller and Butler 1994) among others, which only contribute for 

blurring in the emerging field of marketing science (Fuller, 1999). 

In this research work is used the definition proposed by Donald A. Fuller (1999) for it is 

the best fitted to structure the approach to the new paradigm of sustainability, and because 

                                                 
11

 Homeostasis – Auto regulatory property of a system or organism that allows keeping the equilibrium 
state of its main variables or its environment (Novo Aurélio – Séc. XXI, 1999).

it represents a natural development of the science of marketing and does not constitute a 

disruption with the analytical models already established. 

Sustainable Marketing is the process of [product] planning, implementation and 

development of price control, products/services promotion and distribution, in order to 

satisfy the following three criteria: 

 

Table 6.4 - Criteria to be met by sustainable marketing 

1. Meeting the needs of consumers; 

2. Achieving the goals and objectives of the companies; 

3. The processes developed and used are compatible with ecosystems. 

 

Compatible systems of production and marketing with respect for the environment require 

the integration of strategies and policies for the management of waste from production 

processes and trade, for pollution prevention (P2) and resource recovery (R2). In this 

sense they face directly with the so-called "eco-costs" in the sense of their elimination or 

reduction, from a standpoint of marketing strategies developed by companies. 

 

6.4.1 P2 and R2 goals 

The P2 goals can be achieved through preventive measures introduced in the marketing 

strategies and policies: waste management and its production towards its reduction or 

elimination in the first place. In this way, it contributes decisively to the reduction of 

resources used, reducing the eco-costs, present and future and contributing to the 

achievement of goals R2.  

The R2 objectives are essentially corrective actions arising from audits of sustainable 

marketing, identifying the need for reengineering of the product, packaging, or the 



 

44 

logistics of distribution (traditional or reverse) and all channels and other entities involved 

in distribution networks. 

When a company is to launch a new product in accordance with the sustainable marketing 

framework, it’s in the position to assess the potential pollution generated by product 

sourcing, production, distribution and consumption, and the resources consumed by the 

whole process. If the product is high natural resources consuming or very pollutant (for all 

stages or in a few), sustainable marketing provide the tools for management to 

strategically change product profile and steer pollution reducing or/and reduce resources 

consuming intensity. 

Almost the same rationale can be applied to a product already in the market. Sustainable 

marketing framework provides the means to identify and develop corrective actions, in 

order to reduce the pollution generation and resource consuming intensity. 

Under a stand point of sustainable marketing, goals P2 and R2 (as basic sustainable 

development strategies) imply production and trading operations development (or 

restructuration) in a way that do not compromise ecosystems. In consequence, from 

demand side of the markets, begins to emerge the term "sustainable consumption" 

(Willium and Goluke 1992; Charter, Peattie, Palonsky and Ottman, 2002), that also calls 

for a paradigm shift on decision-making processes and models of consumer behaviour, 

which are clearly outside the scope of this investigation.  

Nevertheless, worthwhile to mention, even briefly, new sustainable marketing mission 

which, according to Sheth and Parvatiyar (1995), can be resumed as: 

1) Redirect customer choices by shifting consumer attention from product benefits to 

product plus environmental benefits; 

2) Reorienting marketing-mix by implementing the decisions which will materialize 

as environmental protection; 

3) Reorganizing marketing channels, both supply side and demand side. 



 

45 

Only by aligning missions, goals, sustainable marketing planning and true commitment to 

ecosystem boundaries, is possible to effectively implement sustainable strategies and 

evolve for environmental stewardship companies. 

 

6.4.2 Waste Management  

In 1974, the Senator from Virginia, Jennings Randolph said before the Subcommittee on 

Environmental Pollution of the U.S. Senate: "The waste, involving more than what we 

call waste. The energy crisis (...) and the scarcity of raw materials make it urgent to 

develop a system of resource recovery. "(Ginter, Peter M. and Starling, Jack M., 1978). 

Two decades after, EPA defined pollution prevention (P2) as the key strategy for 

achieving sustainable development (Fuller 1996, et al). Another decade has passed and a 

study by Yale University places the waste (solid and gaseous) management on top of the 

issues to be managed by the environmental planning and management system of the 

Vancouver county hall, like presented in following figure: 

 

Figure 6.5 - Sustainable pyramid from Vancouver county hall

Pollution resulting from production and consumption of goods in terms of waste creates 

special constraints, not only for its own production (resources invested and associated 



 

46 

costs), and their collection and are in addition to the problem, increasing air pollution 

(transport) and subsequent treatment or disposal. Creating thereby greater impact on 

environment quality and making waste treatment appear on the first line of the 

management and control model that Shane and Graedel of Yale University applied to 

Vancouver13 City. 

 

The traditional waste management   

The traditional waste management model is usually concentrated in the collection, 

treatment and disposal of such waste as much as possible (depending on the technical and 

financial resources available). However, this approach is primarily related to R2 goals. In 

other words, it gives no attention to the processes and decisions ahead of waste 

production. Now, sustainable marketing, above all, aims to prevent and avoid the 

ecological degradation under a P2 perspective. 

The generation of waste, according to Fuller (1999), occurs when the consumer (private 

or business) does not give immediate economic value to the materials that remain after the 

satisfaction of their needs. Is the typical case of cans or plastic bottles, both used to 

transport and deliver a variety of liquid materials. 

Waste generation also occurs as a consequence of industrial processes, whether in the 

form of gases released into the atmosphere, or in the form of effluent into water systems. 

Waste processing can occur at source. This is right after the consumption and consists in 

the act of separation of "household waste" in the categories of organic, metal and plastic 

or paper and subsequent deposition in the ecological point of collection. 

At the industrial level, waste processing can occur by separation of packaging materials of 

raw materials and other inputs used in the production process (such as cardboard, shrink

plastic and pallets for storage) and subsequent delivery/collection by the public system 

Ponto Verde
14 in the Portuguese case. However, there are still many towns, cities and 

factory systems without waste classification and collection, which results in a larger 

environmental impact of the later stage of processing and disposal of such wastes 

(whether from domestic or from industrial and commercial sources). 

The waste collection and transportation involves collecting and carrying waste from the 

source to processing plants such as Valorsul15, to reduce its environmental impact before 

the deposition at landfills. On the other hand, it can also be processed for other industrial 

processes, such as the burning of toxic waste by cement industry. 

The residues that are not processed at the source typically involve transferring to other 

entity specialists in processing certain categories of materials and equipment. It’s the case 

of automobile tires and waste oil. These entities are specialists in the treatment of these 

materials or in the selection and collection of components for reconditioning for specific 

processing, or by its value or for its danger. 

The final disposal of waste is the stage where the waste will not suffer any further 

processing, selection or additional recovery. It is normally the land filling prepared for the 

purpose, or the release into the atmosphere or the sea and estuaries, which are expected to 

have the lesser environmental impact.   

The following figure shows those stages sequences and articulation, under the traditional 

perspective of waste management and recent evolution to integrated waste management 

approach: 

 
                                                 
14 Sociedade Ponto Verde SA is a private society in association with Portuguese state, non-profit and 

was incorporated in November 1996. Its mission is to promote the collection, recovery and recycling 
of packaging waste at the national level. (http://www.pontoverde.pt, 18/07/2010). 

15 Valorsul, SA is the company responsible for processing and recovery of some 750 tons of municipal 
solid waste produced per year in the municipalities of Amadora, Lisbon, Loures, Odivelas and Vila 
Franca de Xira. (http://www.valorsul.pt/default.asp?SqlPage=content&amp;amp;CpContentId=15051, 
09/08/2010). 



 

48 

Figure 6.6 - Traditional vs. Integrated waste management

Integrated waste management 

According to Fuller (1999), the first priority of integrated waste management is the 

elimination or reduction of waste at source, as the P2 goals. It is therefore, a proactive 

strategy for resource conservation and elimination or reduction of waste production 

through a preventive approach (marketing strategy), like product design with 

environmental concerns, which is called Environmental Design16. 

The second priority of integrated waste management has to do with the R2 goals and 

involves the capture of energy, materials and components of waste streams for future use 

(Fuller, Allen and Glaser, 1996). That is to be used as resources for other processes. 

The concept to retain is the close proximity between this hierarchy of integrated waste 

management following the P2 and R2 targets, with the design for environment, which 

trough planning and development, is to conduct from stage to stage to increasingly small 

waste streams. 
                                                 
16 Also known as DFE – Design for environment. 



 

49 

Thus, the waste final disposal will have to deal with smaller quantities, less dangerous and 

therefore, allowing more effectively handling and processing. One can implement 

strategies derived from the goals R2, aiming to lower environmental impacts, contributing 

to the restoration of ecological systems. 

 

6.5 Sustainable marketing strategic decisions 

“Sustainable marketing is an extension of, not a radical departure from, traditional 

marketing management practice.” (Fuller, 1999). This extension is achieved trough the 

addition of new strategic decision boundaries, new criteria to evaluate available 

alternatives and new strategies like P2 (Pollution Prevention) and R2 (Resource 

Recovery) which are to be understand “as logical responses to the need to develop 

production-consumption practices that preserve and enhance the ecosystems within which 

we live.” (Fuller, 1999). 

The following chapters present a detail discussion on this model extension, and the 

integration framework to evolve from traditional marketing management to sustainable 

marketing management. 

 

6.5.1 The traditional marketing management model 

The development of models is a very useful tool to identify and analyze the interactions 

between the various component elements and limits, and to determine influences of the 

marketing process of decision making. The use of models, in this case for sustainable 

marketing (towards sustainable economic performance), is a powerful opportunity to 

create enduring value for multiple stakeholders, according to Epstein, Marc J. (Making 

Sustainability Work, 2008). 



 

50 

Both marketing (traditional and sustainable) processes approach problems in a similar 

way, through the management cycle (planning, execution and control). But the results are 

substantially different, especially when we consider the externalities and the decision 

criteria in line with a marketing strategy (Fuller, 1999). 

For present research, a marketing model describes the necessary inputs, processes, 

outputs, constraints and outcomes to develop and implement a marketing strategy 

(Epstein, 2008). The following figure evidence the traditional marketing management 

decisions model: 

 

Figure 6.7 - Traditional marketing management model 

 

Source: Adapted from Boone and Kurtz1992; McCarthy and Perreault 1993 et al. 

 

In the traditional marketing decision model, marketing managers manipulate: (1) the 

target market, (2) the company's resources, (3) the variables of the marketing mix, which 

they control, and (4) the external constraints (Boone and Kurtz 1992; McCarthy and 

Perreault 1993), like the economy performance, competition intensity, technology and 

legal and fiscal context. They do it within (5) decision criteria defined by (6) marketing 



 

51 

channels immediately available. Marketers decide on what to do and why (planning), 

decide how, who, where and when to do it (implementation) and finally monitor the 

progress of the actions implemented (control) and introduce corrective measures (when 

necessary) in order to achieve the company goals. 

Macroeconomics factors draw the boundaries of marketing management activities outside 

the company. Market pressure demand in the context with culture and level of economic 

and consumerism, determines the opportunities marketing manager pursue in order to 

achieve business goals. 

 

6.5.2 The sustainable marketing management model 

In the sustainable marketing model, three new features emerge: (1) the ecosystems' 

integration into marketing management processes boundaries; (2) the introduction of a 

third criterion on marketing management decisions, in order to achieve ecosystems and 

environmental marketing management decisions compatibility; and finally (3) the 

introduction of the Product-System Life-Cycle (PSLC) concept, before facing the 

boundaries of marketing channels/distribution networks readily available. 

The PSLC concept, which will be fully detailed in the next chapter, can be resumed as the 

product’s waste and scrap generation cycle, from its production and distribution, to its 

consumption by the end-user. 

The context of ecosystems is a border that should be respected as far as possible. The 

ecological footprint17 of the strategy to implement can be evaluated by the fundamental 

equation: I = PAT18. The same applies to the compatibility with the ecosystem or 

                                                 
17 Corresponds to the trail left by human activities of production and marketing in the environment and 

which can be seen by pollution, greenhouse gases, depletion of fisheries in the oceans, deforestation 
of the Amazon among many other examples (Mathis Wackernagel and William Rees, 1990). 

18 In the early 1970 Ehrlich and Holdren conceived the equation by identifying the factors that generate 
environmental impact. Impact (I) is expressed in terms of resource depletion or accumulation of 
waste. P (population) refers to the human population size. Affluence (A) refers to the consumption 



 

52 

environment, as a criterion for deciding on the elements of the marketing mix to use and 

manipulate in order to produce value, both for end-customers and for the company, 

without harming ecological balance. 

That new criterion and boundaries provide a whole new mind-set to consider available 

marketing strategies and operational decisions, on the array of marketing mix variables. It 

can determine the choice for certain distribution networks, or a different approach on 

communication and advertising campaigns, or even drive different options regarding 

packaging and warehousing. 

The new approach of sustainable marketing management evidence those new boundaries 

for marketing decisions regarding environmental impact and waste generation 

management, as the following figures shows: 

 
Figure 6.8 - Sustainable marketing management model 

 
Source: Adapted from Fuller, Donald A. (1999) 

                                                                                                                                               
level of the population calculated as GNP per capita. Technology (T) refers to processes used to 
obtain resources and transforming them into consumer goods and waste (Marian R. Chertow, School 
of Forestry and Environmental Studies, Journal of Industrial Ecology, Volume 4, Number 4, 2001). 



 

53 

 

The new frontier for a market access called PSLC (Product-System Life-Cycle) is based 

on the concept of integrated waste management (Fuller 1996), which will be detailed 

later. The PSLC context of analysis (framework) for the marketing-mix faces new criteria 

with double results. On one hand, the new approach to waste management (or the 

production process or the process of distribution and consumption under the perspective 

of waste generation) can be a source of: 

1) Differentiation or cost reduction; 

2) Competitive marketing or industry advantages (correlated with integrated waste 

management). 

 

6.5.3 The Product-System Life-Cycle (PSLC) 

The Product-System Life-Cycle was early proposed by Donald A Fuller, Jeff Allen and 

Mark Glaser in 1996 and brings together two major constructs concerning marketing 

management and waste management trough sustainable marketing decisions, which are 

resources life-cycle and marketing channels: 

 

1) Resource life-cycle is the cradle-to-grave materials flow trough five nominal 

stages: (1) raw materials extraction, (2) material component manufacturing, (3) 

finished products manufacturing, (4) product’s use/consumption and (5) waste 

disposal which, after all, is also present in precedent stages, as each one of them 

generates its own waste stream. The flows stages 1 to 4 consist of resources (or 

manufactured products) that are either consumed, incorporated or discharged as 

waste (Keoleian and Menerey, 1993). 

2) Marketing channels are a network of organizations (or companies) positioned in 

such a manner that brings at reach the products demanded by end-customers 

markets in the store (place), at the moment (time), in the quantity (selling unit), 

and price preferred by consumers (Coughlan, Andersen, Stern and El-Ansary, 



 

54 

2001). Marketing channels network decisions are defined as the successive 

transactions from production until end-customer delivery for consumption, 

fulfilling business company’s targets of doing so in a profitability manner, for all 

network’s participants.  

Marketing channels decisions regarding occurrences prior to initial product’s 

processes stages or post-consumption are usually outside the scope of 

management (Fuller, 1999). A yoghourt marketing manager has no concern on 

what happens to milk-cows after reproducing age. Neither care for pollutant 

emissions from crude processing into yoghourt-cup polymer, nor (traditionally) 

care less for the yoghourt-cup terminal disposal after yoghourt consumption. 

 

As Fuller (1999) well emphasises, above constructs taken separately lack to offer an 

integrated vision over resources’ life-cycle and business companies objectives. The PSLC 

framework represents a merger of the two concepts that captures the comprehensive, 

cradle-to-grave coverage necessary to assess ecological problems while factoring the 

[critical] element of business purpose. 

The PSLC consists of five stages and its interdependent flows of resources as raw 

materials, energy and other inputs needed for production, distribution and consumption of 

goods and the flow of waste generated in those processes.

The stages 1 to 3 correspond to the flows of raw materials, energy and other materials 

needed for production, processing and marketing of goods to target end-markets of 

consumers/users. The purpose of the system, the consumption of goods by consumers and 

industry as end users, corresponds to the stage 4. Stage 5 concerns the integrated waste 

management of the whole process of production, distribution and consumption. 

Depending on the implementation of strategies for selection of waste, lead waste stranded 

for the most appropriate solutions to the homeostasis of ecological systems. Through 

strategies of recovery of waste back to integrate them into the production process as 

resources of a similar kind or as energy or subsidiary materials, complementary to the 

respective production processes, as is the case of cartons, bottles of glass or PET 

(polyethylene terephthalate)19.

The PSLC provides a perfect insight under a marketing management perspective, on first 

and second Commoner’s law (1971)20 which states respectively that everything is 

connected with everything else and everything must go somewhere. 

The central implications are that each stage of PSLC is supportive of the next stage, and 

are interdependent of each other, and the decisions made in one stage have a direct 

repercussion in following stages (Fuller, et al, 1996). PSLC model can be summarized in 

the form of three main streams, like detailed in the following table: 

 

Table 6.5 - PSLC stream flows 

1. Midstream flow consists of main product's marketing strategy that 

determines the characteristics of products and production, forms and 

packaging for the marketing of consumption goods by end-users and 

ultimately determines the volume and quality of consumption waste 

generation. 

Participants of this flow master subsequent marketing decisions with real 

impact on the overall waste generation chain originated by customer 

market needs satisfaction. Proper PSLC product’s profile can facilitate 

and ensure the company’s achievement of P2 and R2 goals, since it can 

determine the product DFE, allow deeper insight and interpretation of 

end-customers needs and behaviour and projects environment friendly 

distribution channels systems. 

2. Downstream flow of waste generated over the distribution networks, 

which play a key role in the process of waste production and 

management. Decisions within the context of this flow may well 

determine lesser pollutant emissions, resources consumption or 

components assembled, translating into more value for company 

objectives attaining and can be a source of important marketing 

                                                 
20 Ecologist Barry Commoner wrote The Closing Circle. Commoner summarized the basics of ecology 

into what he termed “laws of ecology” (1) Everything is connected to everything else; (2) Everything 
has to go somewhere or there is no such place as away; (3) Everything is always changing; (4) There 
is no such thing as a free lunch, (5) Everything has limits. 



 

57 

differentiation advantages. 

3. Upstream flow of reverse distribution networks and waste management 

ensures their return to productive processes/processing, but now as 

resources. Either to be recycled into a new resource-cycle or to be 

consumed as raw material, by-materials or under the form of energy. In 

many cases reverse channels can become a profit centre for the company, 

since it ensures transport returns occupied, or by selling to other 

companies, what under product’s own perspective is a scrap but can be a 

raw material or energy source for other product processes. 

 

According to Fuller (1999) the PSLC model can be considered as the first step for 

sustainable marketing strategy implementation, to delineate a product’s PSLC from which 

will come an understanding of waste burdens generated by interrelated decisions of 

midstream, downstream and upstream sector participants. Although no individual 

organization or end-customer  can be held as responsible for waste production from other 

system participants, clearly  the totality of system’s waste must be understood [and 

assessed] if it is to be moderated trough coordinated sustainable marketing efforts. 

From PSLC follows the Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) which is defined by EPA as a 

technique to assess the environmental aspects and potential impacts associated with a 

product, process, or service, by:  

1) Compiling an inventory of relevant energy and material inputs and environmental 

releases; 

2) Evaluating the potential environmental impacts associated with identified inputs 

and releases; 

3) Interpreting the results to help you make a more informed decision. 

According t Fuller (1999) LCA “attempts to add flesh, bones and sinew to the bare 

bones of PSLC framework.” Is a deep accounting, understanding and measuring process 



 

58 

of all waste streams and resources used for a certain product process, resulting on 

comprehensive profiling and evaluating of ecological burden. 

While LCA tracks very close the product’s environmental performance and impact, it 

lacks the global perspective of multistage consumption or waste generation. Then, far 

from replacing or being an alternative framework to PSLC, LCA is a necessary 

complementary one. 

Since the scope of present work lies within preliminary and qualitative research, LCA 

will not be further detailed. However, it must be used ahead, if one endeavours to 

develop a full sustainable marketing plan. 

 

6.6 Sustainable marketing strategies 

As discussed earlier sustainable marketing is an evolution of traditional marketing 

management to respond to the new challenges that business and mankind are facing in 

relation to ecosystems unbalance and resource depletion due to production-consumption 

models that we have been using. 

The strategies available under the sustainable marketing model are also extensions of the 

previous model, expanded now, by the P2 (Pollution Prevention) and R2 (Resource 

Recovery) new basic goals. Which result in four sets of product strategies: 

1) Product dematerialization; 

2) Environmental design concerns; 

3) Proactive sustainability; 

4) Sustainable growth. 

These sets of available sustainable strategies are discussed in detail in following chapters. 

 



 

59 

6.6.1 Reconsidering the products in the form of services 

Dematerialization is a result that occurs when fewer resources (raw materials, the 

subsidiary and/or energy) are consumed to produce the same benefits (or equivalent) to 

consumers, thereby reducing the impact of the marketing process in the environment 

(Fuller 1999). P2 and R2 basic strategies of sustainable marketing, contribute directly to 

this result by reducing the resources required and waste/scrap generated in the production 

process for a given level of output. 

Another form of dematerialization has to do with the packaging materials. Reengineering 

the packaging together with new types of logistics (storage and distribution), can bring 

very significant reductions in costs and waste. This is a sustainable marketing strategy, 

with an optimized PSLC perspective, of integrated waste management.   

Nevertheless, according to Kotler and Keller (2005) customers seek to maximize its 

value, within the limits imposed by the costs. The value to customers/consumers is the 

difference between the evaluation that customers make of all the benefits, and the cost 

(consumption) of a product or service. Then consumers look essentially for the benefits of 

products and not the actual product for itself (Fuller 1999). In this sense, it opens a wide 

world of creativity in which companies can spend the focus of its manufacturing and 

marketing operations to contracted services over time, as is the case of companies like 

"Automobile Leasing" whose clients do not get the ownership of the car, but the benefits 

of its use, depending on the mileage contracted.   

 

6.6.2 Design for Environment (DFE) 

According to Graedel and Allenby (1995) the term design for the environment (DFE) was 

born within industrial product design to describe the attributes or components that are 

positive for the environment. However, company decisions on marketing-mix variables 

are reflected directly in the production of waste under managed constraints arising from 



 

60 

P2 strategies, or facilitating the role of recycling, according to R2 goals. Then all areas of 

intervention of marketer’s management decisions must be guided by the principle of 

design for the environment. 

 

Product 

The product concept and design directly determines the resources and processes to be 

used. These are the factors determining the size, characteristics and value of the PSLC 

waste streams (Fuller, 1999). 

According to Devashish Pujari and Gilian Wright21, to effectively achieve DFE 

companies should perform a pre-design research to ensure meeting all new product’s 

environmental requirements and guarantee successful new DFE product marketing. 

The pre-design research consists in:  

1. Initial screening to learn and evaluate environmental needs by end-consumers and 

ecological stakeholders; 

2. Preliminary market assessment for market size appraisal, segments, estimate 

market growth rates and to gain competition insight; 

3. Market research to understand customer’s needs and wants in relation to 

environmental value and how purchase behaviour was altered regarding the new 

needs; 

4. Environmental and business analysis to determine environmental company 

resources and R&amp;amp;D capabilities and the needs to obtain new resources or 

competencies, both internal or through partnerships and to estimate new product’s 

ecological impacts (resource use and pollutant production intensity); 

5. Financial analysis to budget investments and expected returns, funding needs and 

investment planning;

61 

6. Concept definition where final product’s DFE requisites are defined such as 

environmental performance, new product’s benefits, ways of terminal disposal, 

packaging and distribution requisites. 

 

Pricing process 

This is not an intrinsically waste generator process. It, nevertheless, should be a reflection 

and an expression of proposed environmental value embedded supporting development of 

the product's sustainable marketing strategy and respective marketing mix. It must 

therefore internalize the eco-costs resulting from the optimization of PSLC relative to the 

midstream, waste downstream and recycling upstream. 

 

Distribution Networks  

Determine the composition, intensity of market coverage and functional capabilities of the 

networks that are necessary to link product with target markets (Fuller, 1999). They are 

the main agent of waste packing production, as well as air pollution and fuel 

consumption, drive the need and the physical distribution of products, and also hold a 

high proportion of PSLC. 

 

Promotion 

Not being the biggest area of waste production, communication campaigns and 

promotional events and demonstrations must be specially designed and evaluated for 

waste generation minimizing. Many times is a function very constrained by prior 

marketing decisions. So, it must be considered with equal importance when defining the 

marketing variables mix. Then it can fully play its role of communicating clear and 

effectively to end-customer markets product’s concept, central benefits and environmental 

performance or low impact. 



 

62 

 

6.6.3 Proactive strategies for sustainable marketing 

Taking into consideration basic P2 and R2 goals it is possible to draw two major sets of 

sustainable marketing strategies. The first set deals with P2 range of pollution prevention 

possible strategies. The second set covers R2 range of available resource recovery options 

to operationalize true sustainable marketing plans. 

 

P2 - Pollution Prevention 

According to USA’s federal environmental protection agency (EPA), pollution prevention 

(P2) is reducing or eliminating waste at the source by modifying production processes, 

promoting the use of non-toxic or less-toxic substances, implementing conservation 

techniques, and re-using materials rather than putting them into the waste stream.22. 

P2 strategy is the main contribution to the effectiveness of a product’s strategic 

sustainable marketing plan. Its impact at all levels of the PSLC, and the decisions of the 

marketing mix, define the scope of critical targets associated with it. The P2 strategy and 

targets are unquestionably medium to long term and are more effective the sooner they 

are considered in the process of marketing planning. This strategy applies mainly to 

products and production processes. 

 

P2 - Products 

The products are the result of production processes and are moved along the distribution 

networks, but unlike the processes that generate waste and rubbish, products will 

themselves be a waste in the future, either by its consumption, either in terms of waste 

packing as either old or even by the termination of its functionality or benefits. 

                                                 
22 EPA – Environmental Protection Agency http://www.epa.gov/p2/, 17/03/2011. 



 

63 

Thus P2 goals related to products are about designing products that minimize waste 

generation over the production and distribution flow to its consumption by the end-

customers.  

So this strategy focuses on: (1) selection of materials and product components; (2) 

amount of material (and resources) used in its production and packaging; (3) implications 

of those choices for their use, durability and deposition after losing its usefulness - i.e. 

increasing its useful life; (4) minimization of waste/rubbish resulting from the 

use/consumption; and (5) the potential to change the way the consumer obtains 

utility/benefits in their consumption to be more compatible with the ecosystems and 

reduce the environmental impact. 

 

P2 - Production and distribution processes 

The activities involved in the production of goods and materials and their movement 

through the distribution system are ultimately a set of transformation processes on the 

resources (or raw materials) and connected with a marketing purpose which embodies 

time, place and benefits for its possession or transaction (Fuller 1999). The design flow of 

PSLC clearly shows this chain of processes of resource consumption, production, trade 

and the consequent generation of waste/rubbish. 

So P2 goals can be met when production processes and distribution take place in the 

reengineering of production systems and distribution operations, to reduce the resources 

consumed and waste generated in the production process, logistics (Inbound and 

outbound) and along the distribution networks until the end-customer satisfies their needs. 

 

R2 - Resource Recovery 

The second priority resulting from the integrated waste management approach in 

sustainable marketing is the recovery of waste. Because current technology cannot 



 

64 

achieve the level of "zero waste in production", those can be minimized but not entirely 

preventable. They should therefore be addressed in the context of sustainable marketing 

because: (1) all products sooner or later will reach the end of its useful life; (2) will 

always be necessary packing materials and transport - albeit small ones; (3) the very laws 

of physics (underlying processes) require that the transformations the raw materials are 

subject to will always generate some sort of waste. 

The R2 strategy can therefore be described as the process through which products, 

materials (resources) and energy are routinely recaptured in waste streams and reinstated 

again in the cycle of production, distribution and consumption. This process is 

implemented by distribution reverse channels as evidenced by the upstream flow of PSLC 

framework. So R2 strategy can be achieved through the reuse of products, materials 

recycling and processing of materials. 

 

R2 - Reuse of products 

The many possible approaches of this strategy are always based on the type of product 

concerned and its ability to be modified or refurbished to be re-marketed and 

consumed/used. This approach is distinct from the strategy P2 – Product, due to being 

considered as product life-cycle extension. Here is considered a succession of 

consumption cycles with equivalent or equal benefits. Its achievement is evident in the 

"triple R": Reconstruction, Reconditioning and Repair. Most common (and not a novelty 

from sustainable paradigm) example for R2 goal enforcement is reusable bottles of beer 

or wine, fallen into oblivion on last decades of the twentieth century. In this case, a prize 

value was attributed to end-customer when the bottle was returned to marketing channel, 

performing a reverse flow from stores to production plant, for washing and refilling. It 

stands for a perfect example of PSLC model, with a correct pricing process which 



 

65 

assigned a price to the empty bottle to stimulate the end-customer to proactively return it 

to the stream, what otherwise would be a waste for terminal disposal. 

 

R2 - Recycling Materials  

The recycling of materials through the capture of large quantities of products and 

materials from the waste stream of PSLC, which are then subject to reduction and 

physical changes that make them return to the stage of raw (or subsidiary/components) 

materials, completely free from the product’s characteristics and benefits or the physical 

forms which was originally built. After recycling, these materials became resources and 

compete directly with the raw materials at first use, either in quality or in value, thus 

creating alternative resource material sources for industrial production, since it could be 

guaranteed: 

1) Continuous flow of supply; 

2) Use of stable distribution channels with reverse logistics (stage 5 of PSLC); 

3) Recycled material market development and maintenance. 

 

R2 -Waste material processing 

Transformation of raw materials involves waste processing through thermal processes 

(incineration and/or combustion), chemical or biological agents who transform the 

original materials in alternative or even new materials. 

 

6.6.4 Sustainable marketing growth strategies 

The natural and physical environment, traditionally discussed as an external influence on 

the process and content of managerial decision making, is now viewed (as already 

discussed) as central to marketing and management (Ajay Menon and Anil Menon, 1976). 



 

66 

However, business companies’ goals still remain to be the increase of sales and value. 

Although they have at present a wider scope of targets to run to like “green image”, CSR, 

respect for ecological balance and sustainable growth. 

However, some discussion and doubts about the causal relationship between sustainable 

strategies and better corporate performance still arise (Menon and Menon, 1997, Dias 

Sardinha and Reijnders, 2005). More recent research cast a whole renewed interest on the 

subject. As worldwide companies like Dupont, 3M and Electrolux (early adopters of 

environmental criteria for strategic development) keep on track regarding environmental 

and sustainability issues, and grow more involved and committed, because they consider 

that ecological and social responsibility is rewarding. 

According to several authors there is already robust enough evidence about social and 

ecological responsibility as performance drivers, responsible for cost reduction, higher 

value delivered to end-customers, shareholders and stakeholders in general (Auperle, 

Carrol and Hatfield ,1985; Pullman, Maloni and Carter, 2009). 

Companies that adopt a marketing strategy for sustainable development and growth under 

the new paradigm of social responsibility and ecological compatibility, have two high-

level strategies for its development towards sustainability: (a) environmentally improved 

products and (b) environmental reinvented products, each one subdivided into two sets, 

depending on the target end-market. (i) Penetration when the target is the same where 

product/company has already operated or (ii) development when product/company aims 

to enter new end-markets (or segments). It corresponds to environmental enhancement 

and constructs expansion of the classic Ansoff’s product/market matrix23.

67 

Figure 6.10 - Strategic matrix of environmentally 
enhanced and reinvented products

Strategies for environmentally enhanced products  

The entry strategies and market development for environmentally improved products 

require minor changes or adjustments in products, production processes and distribution 

networks, in terms of compatibility with the ecosystem (new decision criterion of the 

marketing-mix decision model for sustainable marketing). 

Those two strategies (1-market penetration/product enhancement and 2-market 

development) involve modest changes in products and processes that focus on improving 

the performance of the product as it stands in PSLC. Based on the current used 

technology, the central features of the product and its benefits for the end-customer, 

should remain essentially the same, but with an improved environmental performance, 

regarding production processes, distribution or terminal disposal (or perhaps returning to 

PSLC’s waste/raw materials upstream). So this development strategy is based mainly on 

R2 actions with a short-term horizon. 

 

Strategies for environmentally reinvented products  

In contrast to the strategies of improved products, those relating to the environmentally 

reinvented product's column have their origin in reinventing the concept of a product with 



 

68 

stronger compatibility with the environment, better distribution channels performance as 

proposed by the PSLC and the active contribution for the balance of ecosystems. 

In terms of product development, these strategies involve a radical change in how 

products deliver value and benefits of their consumption to end-customers to 

accommodate their ecological attributes. These are strategies with a time horizon of 

medium and long term, which inherently lead to exposure of the company to greater risks 

related to innovation. 

 

7 SUSTAINABLE MARKETING AUDIT 

Detailed analysis of the strategies available for management and sustainable marketing 

decision enforcement are not part of this research project. As an exploratory research in a 

discipline as recent as sustainable marketing, it focuses instead in a practice sufficiently 

grounded in theory and previous work, contributing to a more rapid introduction of this 

new approach in the current management plans and marketing strategies, which may at 

once incorporate the benefits of the new paradigm. 

 

7.1 Sustainability as a source of competitive advantage 

The implementation of sustainable marketing in accordance with the new paradigm of 

social responsibility and environmental responsibility may in itself be a source of 

competitive advantage (sustainable) in the medium and long term (Banerjee, Bobby S., 

Peattie, Ken, 1999)24. 

These advantages derive directly from the possibility of reducing costs through the 

implementation of strategies P2 and R2 in the view of the PSLC.

Charter, Martin and Polonsky, Michael J. Greenleaf Publishing Limited, Shefield, UK. 



 

69 

Apart from these, the repositioning environment of company's products can lead to 

product differentiation and to conquer additional market shares (Earle, 1993). 

According to Porter (1991), reducing consumption of raw materials, the emergence of 

growing market segments for products with environmental features and compatible with 

the environment and the new cleaner technologies, can be a source of competitive 

advantage. 

 

7.2 Environmental product positioning assessment  

Before the establishment of any marketing plan development, one must make the 

diagnosis of the starting point. That is, evaluate more thoroughly and accurately as 

possible where we are, thus one can define the objectives and goals to achieve and the 

way to go and the necessary investments to be made to support that strategy. 

The aim of this research is to develop a sustainable marketing audit of a product-specific, 

in order to find the product’s position regarding ecological burden. The comprehensive 

diagnosis can become the starting point for the future strategic sustainable marketing 

planning and implementing. 

According to Kotler and Keller (2005) the marketing audit is a comprehensive, 

systematic, independent and periodic review of environmental objectives, strategies and 

marketing activities of a company or business unit, to determine problems and 

opportunities and to recommend an action plan to improve the performance of marketing. 

The sustainable marketing audit pursues the same objectives but in terms of 

environmental responsibility (compliance with the goals P2 and R2), improvement on the 

PSLC and integrated waste management, restricted to a specific product. The marketing 

audit focuses on sustainability, and so the characterization and evaluation (qualitative) of 

the company's marketing strategies ecological impact for a product-specific (Fuller 1999). 

 



 

70 

The sustainable marketing audit is then subject to the following questions: 

 

Table 7.1 - Sustainable marketing audit questions 

• What are the waste streams associated with the product in the production process 

and distribution process? 

• What wastes are produced in the use / consumption of the product and at the end of 

its useful life? 

• What is the standard / typical method of deposition of the product? 

• Are there environmentally compatible processes, materials and raw materials or 

other improvements associated with the product that can be used in the current context 

of the production process and technology? 

• How to characterize the company's suppliers on the environmental responsibility? 

How can you support providers to abandon the use of products/resources toxic or 

hazardous? 

• How do customers see the product, environmental friend or foe? 

 

With this audit of sustainable marketing to a product-specific to be concretized in the 

diagnosis of the current strategy of Delta Q, one is in possession of the basic product 

positioning against goals P2 and R2. 

 

7.3 Product positioning in relation to P2 and R2 

At the end of the sustainable marketing audit process, should be a diagnosis with a solid 

foundation for developing and proposing a marketing strategy based on sustainable 

principles like pollution prevention (P2) and resource recovery (R2), and thus develop 

truly sustainable actions to assure product’s ecological impact reducing. 



 

71 

The comprehensive understanding of the product’s standing point regarding sustainable 

marketing goals is critical, not only to assess product’s commitment to environmental 

sustainability and ecological responsibility, but moreover, to define the set of sustainable 

marketing strategies available. 

Depending on product’s positioning against P2 and R2 goals, a whole set of different 

sustainable marketing strategies arise, as presented in following figures, representing the 

desirable product’s perfect positioning and the path to be made to achieve the 

improvement level goal: 

 

Figure 7.1 - P2 and R2 goals for product positioning 

 

 

If a product is low positioned against P2, the marketing manager has to evaluate and 

launch actions under dematerialization or DFE range of strategies, as previously 

discussed, if suitable. Alternatively, if the product is already developed (or even being 

marketed), product’s marketing manager can start a deep re-evaluation of the product 

according to the sustainable marketing proactive strategies discussed above. 

On the other hand, if the product’s positioning is low against R2 goals, the marketing 

manager should evaluate a different range of available sustainable marketing strategies, 

like the reuse of materials, material recycling, and above all, the integrated waste 



 

72 

management, according to product’s position in the PSLC (Product-system Life-cycle), as 

already discussed above. 

The design of the strategic marketing planning and implementation seeks to replicate the 

ecological systems in homeostasis. The company’s production and marketing processes 

have the unique property of providing the reproduction of those initiatives for a wide 

range of stakeholders, or by a wide audience like suppliers, distribution channel partners 

or common public in general. We are, therefore, in a context of effective action at the 

local level, with potential impact at the global level, which can and must diminish whole 

industry carbon footprint.

8 DELTA CAFÉS 

The choice on Delta Cafés was made mainly because it is the leading Portuguese 

company in coffee industry. This choice was also motivated by the company's decision to 

enter, consciously, the market segment of capsulated coffee, where the giant Nestlé holds 

the leadership. Delta Cafés entered in this market segment with Delta Q brand, which is 

the focus of the present research. 

Delta Q is essentially a pure marketing management product, born from the intrinsic 

development of day-to-day marketing management principles, in this case, the ones 

regarding to customer listening and needs satisfaction. In fact, soon after Nestlé strong 

launch of Nespresso concept in the Portuguese market, Delta Cafés started to receive 

increasingly pressure demand from end-customers and professional customers asking why 

there was no Delta Cafés product in the market segment of capsulated coffee? 

This demand pressure was made visible trough hundreds of e-mails and letters sent to the 

company and continuous questioning to the sales representatives by the professional 

market and distribution networks. In a very clever and bold move, Delta Cafés 

management found the right market opportunity and motivation to enter a new market 

segment with a new product/brand and expanding company’s revenue streams. 

 

8.1 Overview 

DELTA Cafés is celebrating in 2011 its fiftieth anniversary and is one of the leading 

representatives of the so-called Portuguese quality products and is also a special presence 

in the industry and in the business landscape, due to its brand recognition, value and trust 

from de end-market and its sustainable and organic growth. The coffee brand DELTA 

was considered by the consumers a trusted brand for the last nine years. 



 

74 

DELTA operates in the coffee industry under a vertical business integration approach. 

The company acts on three main markets associated to coffee: 

2) DELTA sources green coffee directly on the producer markets and 

respective farmers all over the world. 

3) DELTA imports green coffee for Portugal, being responsible for half of the 

Portuguese coffee imports, for plant processing and packaging. 

4) DELTA promotes, sells and distributes ready to consume coffee for several 

end-user and professional markets. More recently entered the niche of the 

encapsulated coffee rivaling directly with the giant NESPRESSO (Nestlé 

Group) and eventually could be added a new fourth dimension of vertical 

business integration, regarding reverse logistics of coffee consumption 

waste management, which will be furthermore detailed, later, once it is the 

core of this case study. 

 

Undoubtedly, this is the result of the charisma of its founder in addition to a recognized 

product quality, which allows a single market share of 48% facing more than a two dozen 

other national and international competitors brands in the Portuguese market. Thus the 

company leads the Portuguese toasted coffee market. In Spain, the company achieved a 

market share of little over 5%, which assure the seventh place in the Spanish toasted 

coffee ranking, just after three years of direct establishment in the market. 

The profile consumption for coffee breaks into 72% for immediate consumption in 

coffee-shops, restaurants and similar, and 23% for domestic consumption, according to 

latest market reports cited by current CEO of the company Rui Miguel Nabeiro grand-son 

of the founder of DELTA Cafés (Marketeer magazine, June 2009). 

Commendation holder Rui Nabeiro portraits a special entrepreneurship character and 

personnel business vision that determined the launch of DELTA in a small village called 

Campo Maior on the Portuguese country side of Alentejo (beyond Tagus river), near the 



 

75 

Spanish border, away from all the main end-markets, still today. Nevertheless, closer to 

the green coffee import markets, and now, fifty years after, strategically positioned to 

launch its successful internationalization process, towards continental European markets. 

Today DELTA SGPS manages more than ten business companies in three continents, and 

almost countless small other firms, ranging from store design, logistics and computing to 

a professional training school and a children day care centre. 

The company employs directly 1.746 persons according to 2009 DELTA's annual 

accounting report, that are responsible for a global gross wage mass of 50,8 million Euro. 

Almost one third of all goods and subsidiary materials used for coffee processing, and 

packaging is domestic sourced, which accounts for annual internal buying over 83 million 

Euro. 

DELTA group is present directly in Portugal, Spain, France, Angola, Mozambique and 

Brazil, and keeps trading operations with more than thirty countries around the world, 

making DELTA, perhaps, one of the most globalised Portuguese companies. Following is 

showed Delta inbound and outbound international flows from imports and exports 

respectively:

Iberian operations are structured around 34 own sales departments and 26 partner 

distributor companies. This distribution network assures a coverage rate of 98% in 

Portugal and over 75% in Spain, and assures effective promotion and sales trough several 

end-markets like: Restaurants, Companies, Modern distribution (wholesalers and 

retailers), Vending machines, on-line and Brand-owned stores in Lisbon and Oporto. The 

following figure shows Delta’s Iberian marketing structure and geographical widespread 

trough Portugal and Spain, as direct own marketing departments:

To assure all the necessary logistics regarding the producing, marketing and distribution 

the company manages a fleet of 37 Lorries and 662 light vehicles. 

The business model associated to the coffee industry as implemented by DELTA is 

arranged under three main strategic building block operations: 

 



 

77 

Figure 8.3 - Traditional building blocks of business model 

 

 

Green coffee inbound 

Since there aren't coffee planting and production in Portugal, all raw coffee must be 

imported, and the company bought from foreign producer markets in 2009, around 185,7 

million euro of coffee (2009 DELTA's annual accounting report), which accounts for 50% 

of Portuguese coffee buying in the international markets. This means over exposure to the 

volatility of exchange rates, financial markets and national economies performance and 

assessment by the market makers. 

Furthermore, it becomes of strategic importance due to the determinant impact on the 

final quality of the toasted coffee produced and marketed. From different production 

markets are obtained coffees with distinctive textures, aromas and (off course) tastes, 

which, through the first building block of the DELTA’s business model, assumes seminal 

importance to the final product quality and company market success. 

Based on these distinctive characteristics of green coffee from several continents and 

climates, DELTA blends different aromas and textures to produce some of the best 

Espresso coffee in the world. 

 

Green coffee processing 

In this building block of the business model, green coffee goes trough three main 

processing stages and corresponds to the industrial step of the model. First the coffee 

grains are toasted. Second they are subject to milling. In addition, in the third stage the 



 

78 

several lots are mixed to create the different blends to pack and store for further 

distribution.  

Prior to the first stage of toasting, but quite close and critical, is the reception of the green 

coffee, where is it immediately subject to sensorial inspection and characteristics 

allocation by origin, grain weight, dimensions and humidity.   

Then grain samples are collected from the lots to further fine testing in the laboratory, 

which establishes, confirms and controls the lots origin and full characteristics, to 

determine exactly, the blend proportions needed to produce all the brands and lots 

marketed by DELTA. 

Furthermore, at this stage sample toasting is performed to determine the levels of ashes 

produced, loss of humidity, liquid extract produced, caffeine level and finally to assess the 

taste of the finished coffee. 

At the first stage, the grain coffee is toasted in three phases: 

1) Evaporation by heating is the longest phase; 

2) Drying the grains and aroma producing, as well as the brown colour that also 

occurs in this phase, is the most energy consumption phase reaching 1500 Celsius 

degrees; 

3) Most important chemical transformation occurs, and humidity loss is maxim. 

At the second stage coffee is milled. The milling process is also a critical one, once the 

milling is too thick and water stays too long with the coffee, which produces a coffee with 

kind of a bitter taste. Adequate milling gives coffee the proper taste and creamy look. 

Finally, at the third stage, milled coffee is packed. DELTA processes two kinds of 

packaging: 

1) The vacuum pack, where all the air is sucked out of the pack, inhibiting the 

oxidation of the coffee and hence the loss of aroma, taste and quality; 



 

79 

2) The modified atmosphere, which consists in the injection of an inert gas in the 

pack replacing oxygen to avoid, also, the coffee oxidation process. 

 

Coffee marketing and distribution 

The strategic importance of this block derives from the extreme exposure the product 

acquires from this moment on. The finished packs of the different blend and presentations 

start to be communicated and promoted trough the sales teams. Direct contact with 

costumers enhances the sales, but is also a source of conflicts and the first input to after-

sales process. 

The stock keeping packs start to be distributed for the several widespread sales 

departments, wholesalers, professional channels and retail stores. 

 

8.2  Accounting and financial data 

Following is presented a quick overview of main figures of DELTA, intended to gain a 

comprehensive picture of business evolution and dimension over the past seven financial 

years. 

The company has been facing a steady growth of business volume. Indeed DELTA 

evidences one of the best performances of recent years in Portuguese economic 

landscape. Starting 2003 to 2009 business volume increased 66%, which corresponds to 

an amazing 11% annual average growth. Special note for 2007 where the company 

achieved almost 14,50% growth of business volume over 2006, as shown in the following 

figure:

Accompanying the business volume growth, also the workforce has been increasing. In 

2009 financial year DELTA employed 1.746 persons, which computes a rise in the 

workforce of 39,20 % regarding 2003 financial year.

Over the same period DELTA manifest a slight deterioration of gross sales profitability. 

Starting 2003 with a gross sales profitability of 70,50% it turned to 65,49%, which 

corresponds to overall contraction of 7,10% over a period of seven financial years. Same 

trend is patented more clearly by the net sales profitability indicator. Over the period, it 

diminished from 9,62% in 2003 to 3,74% and recovered slightly for 5,11% in 2009, as 

shown in the following graphic:

8.3  DELTA and the corporate social responsibility 

Delta Cafés group achieved the first absolute Portuguese social certification, back in 

2002, under the SA 8000 norm from CEPAA26. These norms result from several 

international agreements like ILO – International Labour Organization, Human Rights 

Universal Statement and United Nations Convention on Child Rights. 

This is an enviable prize for any company, but for DELTA it is only the natural corollary 

for a lifetime coherence of the founder of the company as a citizen and entrepreneur and 

as a CEO sharing and spreading it’s vision and business philosophy over the community 

and all over the recruited human team. 

During one of the several interviews held with the responsible for DELTA Q project, 

when asked about the genesis of this strong feeling that the company transpires for all 

audiences regarding social responsibility and environment protection, after a lapse for 

thinking, the answer was unequivocal: “Commendation holder Rui Nabeiro is the cradle 

of this way of carrying on our coffee business, in every aspect it involves.” 

The social responsibility certification obtained allowed DELTA to frame already on-

going projects and was the framework which has launched some of the critical and 

innovative projects in Portugal, regarding social responsibility and sustainability since 

then. 

The well-established values of the company were organized and since then 

comprehensively communicated as follows: 

 
Table 8.1 - DELTA values statement 

Integrity Transparency Loyalty Quality 

Sustainability Solidarity Social responsibility Humility 

 

                                                 
26 CEPAA – Council on Economics Priorities Accreditation Agency 



 

84 

Anchored on these values statement, the company defined and assumed as a main goal to 

achieve, according to 2003 DELTA Social Report, “The group objective is to assure 

business profitability in a responsible manner with a strong and constant growth in such a 

way that the growing dynamics assures DELTA Excellency.” 

To pursue this main objective, the company recognised the necessity of commitment 

facing five groups of stakeholders: 

 
Table 8.2 - DELTA stakeholders 

1) Shareholders – To protect and assure a fair return on investment of 

shareholders. 

2) Collaborators – to underline the importance of the employees for the good 

governance of the group; to assure proper work conditions, specially regarding 

hygiene and safety; to respect the employees' rights, specially the association 

and collective negotiation ones; to nurture the development of new ideas and 

talents; to provide continuous training in order to make employees more 

capable and active citizens; to assure without discrimination fair evolution 

opportunities; to promote the employee's commitment in company progress as 

well as to the practicing of these principles. 

3) Clients – to create value for the client’s business, to invest in R&amp;amp;D  to offer 

products with enhanced added value as a strategy for acquisition and retention 

of customers and to anticipate the customer’s needs in order to provide a better 

response. 

4) Trade Partners – to reinforce the ethical principles needed for keeping well and 

long relationships with providers and all entities and organizations that 

somehow relate to DELTA, based on transparency and continuous 

improvement. 

5) Community – to drive business in a coherent and responsible manner to assure a 

pro-active contribution to integrated community development and to nurture 

human, natural, financial, emotional and cultural resource sustainability. 

 



 

85 

The above-mentioned responsibilities are based on a comprehensive group of principles, 

which are boundaries for the development and driving of the DELTA business operations. 

Those principles are listed next: 

 

Table 8.3 - DELTA responsible guidance principles 

» Economic 

» Integrity and Transparency 

» Quality and Employees health and safety 

» Citizenship 

» Zero tolerance to child working 

» Free competition 

» Communication exemption. 

 

Following the social certification granted, DELTA framed and enhanced several 

important projects in different areas such as Citizenship and Sustainability. 

As one of the most remarkable and important programs enhanced in the citizenship area, 

DELTA launched in early 2000, following the independence recognition of former East 

Timor, the campaign “Um café por Timor” (One coffee for Timor) consisting in offering 

0,25 Euro for each 250 g pack of coffee produced at the factory in Campo Maior. The 

money collected this way was channeled mainly for infrastructures to support citizens in 

Timor like equipment and other school supplies. 

Trough implementation of the tools provided by the social certification, the company 

could further systematize its deep social and environmental awareness. Thus the three 

strategic building blocks could unfold in six: the three blocks from traditional business 

orientation and three more came from the new social and environmental orientation, 

which might as well be called of sustainable marketing oriented. 



 

86 

 

Figure 8.10 - New social and environmental business model building blocks 

 

 

The three strategic building blocks added provide a comprehensive vision of the new 

approach resulting from the paradigm shift towards a sustainable and responsible growth 

of business companies, nation economies and the people. 

 

Community Involvement 

From this block was possible to build wide communication channels between the 

company and the communities surrounding DELTA in several contexts. End-customers 

easily obtain information and interact with the company trough user-friendly designed 

websites, green telephone number and DELTA Magazine. 

It should be stressed the program “Delta Planet” with its own internet address27 where the 

company reunites all information about sustainability and the programs or special projects 

held by the company. 

                                                 
27

 http://www.planetadelta.pt, 12/09/2010 



 

87 

A traceability program was also built to ensure product quality and effective after sales 

assistance regarding health and safety. 

It, furthermore, should be underlined the R&amp;amp;D efforts to develop and support HORECA28 

business in order to enhance the quality of equipments and services delivered to coffee 

consumers, and to assure health and safety conditions for industry professionals. 

 

Sustainability Management 

This building block comprises two of the most significant actions taken by the company 

towards an effective corporate responsibility and sustainability, namely “The Sustainable 

Coffee Origins Program” and the effective impact in logistics and regional transportation, 

bridging at the same time local and national government, public railway company and 

positive impact on business and community. Each action comprehends the following 

detailed scope: 

 

1) Sustainable Coffee Origins Program – Following prior program “One Coffee for 

Timor” DELTA created one of the first private owned companies in Timor to 

stimulate coffee farmers for the need of standardization and certification of 

origin, branded “Coffee Timor” and to promote community sustainable 

development. 

 Pursuant to this program ranging from the coffee plant farming, passing trough 

the use of local and natural fertilizer until the improvement of green coffee, 

DELTA could  introduce in 2001 the first world selected blend from Timor 

Origin Gourmet, branded as: TIMOR DIAK29.  

                                                 
28

 HORECA – Hotels, Restaurants and Cafeterias. 
29

 In Tétun (the autochthonous dialect) translates into: The good coffee from Timor. 



 

88 

 This was the standard coffee for the 

creation of Timor Standard and for 

Timor Gourmet to achieve the 

international origin certification of 

coffee from Timor. 

 After the 2002 harvests, the 

international classification created by 

DELTA was accepted and widespread as Timor Standard. 

 

2) Bridging trough companies, government and community – DELTA was 

decisive to motivate and bridge over several government departments, local 

authorities and public railway company, among other business companies and 

entities, turn reality the creation of the container logistics platform in Elvas. 

 These efforts come to avoid 205 kms several times a day by Lorries between the 

maritime platform container in Alcantara-Lisbon and Campo Maior, where the 

DELTA plant is located, to deliver green coffee. Only the remaining part of the 

route to Campo Maior is still assured by Lorries, in a distance of only 19 Kms. 

 This project allowed a significant fuel saving with positive impact in the cost 

structure of the company. Furthermore, it promoted job creation and cheaper 

logistics for other local business companies and, moreover, reduced 

tremendously the carbon footprint of the inbound logistics of green coffee. 

 

Towards effective sustainability and to manage the ecological footprint from the group, 

DELTA implemented an environmental management system which comprehends: 

monitoring of energy consumption, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, water consumption 



 

89 

(both from public or own supplying), waste production from coffee processing and 

packaging (by toxicity and terminal disposal).   

 

Social responsibility 

The last added strategic building block stands up for the full integration of the traditional 

business model with the one resulting from the new marketing management approaches 

like CSR and sustainable development. Thus the program created for the origin 

certification: Timor Standard gave place to the development of similar programs in 

Angola, S. Tomé e Príncipe and Brazil, and thus, contributing decisively for the 

enhancing of the coffee production (in quantity and quality) in a social and environmental 

manner. 

Those programs are based in three 

complementary dimensions of 

intervention designated: Origins 

Sustainability/Local Sustainability, Fair 

Trade and Eco-Efficiency. 

Together with other international 

programs and standards, life conditions of the farmers and local producing communities 

are improved as well as biodiversity and carbon sequestration. 

These goals are to be achieved trough the widespread communication of the several 

international origin certifications which ensure the above goals and action principles. In 

this condition are the following coffee international origin certifications: 

 

 

 



 

90 

Table 8.4 – DELTA’s coffee international certifications and standards 

» Organic – Biologic coffee produced under sustainable principles 

without fertilizers and independently audited and 

certified. 

» Rainforest Alliance – aims to improve biodiversity by planting 

the coffee plant in poor soils and manages the whole 

pollutants from machine fuel to human effluents of 

the community. This program also intervenes over 

the population assuring quality food and drinking 

water as well as the health services and medical aid. 

» Shadow Coffee – Is a coffee harvested from plants in the 

shadow of bigger trees, which allows a slow growth 

of the grain and produces a coffee with a high 

quality and strong scent. These kinds of coffee 

plants also provide shelter for birds and promote 

biodiversity. 

 

As a natural corollary for DELTA group, each company developed efforts towards 

certification under several international norms and standards, beyond the ones directly 

related to coffee sourcing origins, blending and marketing. This way DELTA was the first 

Portuguese company to achieve Quality certification under ISO 9000 for the toasting 

industry, back in 1994. Later it was also the first Portuguese company to be granted with 

quality product certification for the blends Delta Selecção, Delta Ouro and Delta Platina.  

Following is presented a list of all certifications and group companies audited according 

to each norm requisites:

8.4 Delta Q 

On November 2007, DELTA enters the segment of capsulated coffee with its newly 

created brand Delta Q. This moment is one of the most important milestones of the 

company history for two reasons. First DELTA is not even a big Portuguese business 

company and could dare the giant Nestlé in its very own game. And second, 

commendation holder Rui Nabeiro shoots back 

twenty years after Nestlé tried to by his business to 

enter Portuguese coffee market trough the leading 

marketing share company. 

Capsulated coffees are a niche of the general coffee market segment, specially associated 

with domestic consumption, which represents about 27% of the total coffee consumption. 

Nevertheless, entry to this niche requires not only to master all the competences to market 

coffee in all the remaining traditional segments and channels, but also to assure the 



 

92 

availability of a pressure machine with all associated details like sourcing the machine, 

capsule compatibility assurance, distribution and sales channels, after-sales technical 

maintenance, end-life machine disposal among many others. 

To well manage the whole issues related to capsulated coffee was a real challenge to add 

to all the others that DELTA’s management team had to deal with. 

Capsulated coffee history goes back as far as 1901 when 

Mr. Luigi Bezzera invented and assembled the first 

Espresso Coffee Machine. According to the Bezzera’s 

factory website, the machine was publicly unveiled at the 

Milan International Fair in 1906, where Mr. Bezzera 

presented an absolute novelty: the first automatic espresso 

coffee machine30. 

Back in 1970 Nestlé correctly anticipated the further 

development of domestic coffee consumption and the trend for increasing demand on 

Gourmet coffee, and decided to reinvent Mr. Bezzera’s original concept and drastically 

modernize and simplify the use of espresso machines along with dramatic size reducing to 

fit a wide range of users and situations. Due to this strategic decision, in 1986 “Nespresso 

SA, was set up in Vevey, Switzerland with a staff of five including one secretary. 

Nespresso is launched in Switzerland and Italy with the C100 and C1100 machine models 

manufactured by Turmix and targeted to the office coffee service sector. Capsule 

production begins in Orbe, Switzerland, and coffee varieties include Bolero, Capriccio, 

Cosi and Decaffeinato.”31

http://agents.nespresso-pro.com/en/about/history.html, 20-02-2011. 



 

93 

According to Nespresso website, the development of a “totally integrated system, after 

long years of research and many patents, revolutionized the 

portioned coffee market and started a new era of encapsulated 

coffee.” Moreover, all those patents, many years later, made 

harder the task endeavoured by DELTA. Indeed, to be possible 

for DELTA to enter this market, it would have to overcome 

several obstacles, of which Nespresso patents were not the lesser 

one. 

Nespresso entered the Portuguese market in 2003 with the machine model C100, and 

swiftly took advantage of almost two decades of international experience and on the élan 

around Nespresso Club exclusive stores. 

In turn, for DELTA entering this niche, although it was a marketing opportunity due to 

Portuguese coffee market maturity and approach to international mainstream behavior and 

needs, it was also, and perhaps more determinant, a market pressure from Portuguese 

customers, who revealed an extreme trust and fidelity to brand and company. In fact, end-

consumers and professionals flood DELTA with letters, e-mails and even direct 

approaches to company professionals at several levels, demanding the chance to enjoy at 

their homes the delight of a high quality capsulated coffee, but from a Portuguese brand, 

especially from DELTA. 

 Delta Q entry level was the model M55 with a price of 149,90 Euro. The more 

sophisticated model Bugatti, for higher and demanding segments was priced at 499,90 

Euro. There were launched seven blends of certified origin coffee like shown in the 

following table:

With flavour intensity ranging from 1 (fewer intense aroma and taste) to 10 (the mostt

coffee. 

The end-user coffee price was 2,50 Euro for a carton with ten capsules for every blend 

without distinction. Current 2011 price is 2,90 Euro, which represents a price inflation (by 

the end-customer) of 16% in the fourth year after launch. 

Until January 2011, more than 10 million Delta Q capsules were sold. 

 



 

95 

Capsule development 

To overcome the Nespresso international patents regarding the aluminium coffee 

capsules, there was the need to design a new capsule, assuring optimum coffee quality 

conservation, easy to use, compatible with available coffee machines technical 

restrictions, and that should be recyclable. This was a major pre-requisite since the very 

beginning of the project. Due to DELTA’s social and environmental involvement, the 

ability of both capsule and coffee should be susceptible to recycling and valorization after 

consumption. This early preoccupation turned more recently into an autonomous project 

to be presented later in the research. 

The design process for the DELTA Q capsule was assured with a full commitment of 

DELTA’s technical and human resources with the involvement of a University 

Laboratory. 

 

Machine sourcing and development 

The need to develop a brand new capsule for coffee with special characteristics like 

recyclability, determined the need for a new coffee machine, regarding which materials 

the capsules were made of, the water pressure and temperature necessary to assure coffee 

quality and properties in an everyday situation, among several other requisites. 

In 2009 in collaboration with Diverge Design, DELTA launches the coffee machine 

QOSMO. The first capsulated coffee machine 100% projected and manufactured in 

Portugal. Once more, 

DELTA patents and takes 

advantage of national know-

how and partnerships to 

innovate and achieve 

marketing differentiation and leverage. 



 

96 

The new machine, besides the national design and modern looks, also unveiled a new 

trend regarding urban young market segment of end-customers. The machine was 

specifically designed to be compact and fully portable, incorporating multi-coffee 

dispensing function. 

Until January 2011, were sold more then 220 thousand Delta Q coffee-machines. 

 

Distribution and promotion 

The strategic marketing options of DELTA reflect its own approach to markets where it is 

present, and clearly substantiate a differentiation strategy. While Nespresso supported 

their strategy on exclusiveness and selective distribution, privileging direct access to end-

customers, DELTA opted for widespread and easy access of customers to the brand, 

taking advantage of existing partnerships with modern distribution, hyper and 

supermarkets, and some punctual agreements with specialized retailers. One can find in 

this case the Media Markt chain of domestic electronics and appliances, and Spanish 

retailer El Corte Inglés. This last one also was extensive to Spanish market. 

Of course, promotion and communication strategies ought to be different due to enormous 

disparity of reachable resources of each one of the companies. Nevertheless, DELTA took 

clever advantage of recognitions and trust levels that the brand evidence in Portuguese 

market, developed an advertising strategy based on one of the most recognised 

entertainers young talents in conjunction with the intensive use of the new technologies of 

communication like the internet and viral marketing.

8.5 DELTA’s Rethink-Eco-Project 

According to DELTA’s press release of July 1st, 2010 on Rethink, “the project created by 

Delta Cafés aims to close the cycle of coffee. Is an integrated research project of waste 

recovery produced by the company's activity and the coffee consumption. This is a unique 

project in Portugal to be integrated and analyzed. Given the power of the entire coffee 

cycle, including the consumer and the waste generated, it is an enormous value source.” 

The project breaks into four integrated tasks to 

accomplish the main goal of adding economic 

value to coffee grounds and used capsules from 

Delta Q consumption. 

The four main tasks of Delta Rethink project are: 

 

1) First task consists of comprehensive logistics network of distribution 

assessment, in order to develop a cost effective reverse logistics system, to 

recover coffee grounds and polyethylene capsules back to industrial facilities. 

Thus it is possible to add value to the otherwise waste and to re-launch it into a 

new economic cycle of production. 

2) Second task relates to Delta Q coffee 

capsule (containing dreg) collection in 

Delta Q’s specific designed containers, 

named Capsulões, in selected locations like 

Delta Q own stores, partner híper and 

supermarkets and large professional end-

customers like offices, plants and 

warehouses. 



 

98 

3) Third task is the life cycle assessment (LCA) of Delta Q coffee machines, in 

order to assess the environmental impact. At the same time, it will be identified 

the material components and processes which allow further development and 

production of more environment-friendly coffee machines and accessories. It, 

furthermore, will be assessed the technical and economic viability of 

reintegration Delta Q coffee capsules and machines waste into fabrication of 

new Delta Q equipments and accessories. 

4) Fourth task focus on R&amp;amp;D processes to add value to dreg. 

 

DELTA is developing this project with third party partners. Regarding the container 

collection for used coffee capsule's design, it counts with the services of a most young and 

innovative design company – Diverge Design (http://www.divergedesign.com). 

On R&amp;amp;D resources and facilities, DELTA relies on UNIDEMI – R&amp;amp;D Unit in 

Mechanical and Industrial Engineering from Universidade Nova de Lisboa 

(http://unidemi.fct.unl.pt/). For the dreg recovery research, DELTA counts with the 

collaboration of IBET – Technologic Experimental Biology Institute 

(http://unidemi.fct.unl.pt/), the largest biotechnology research organization in Portugal. 

Delta Rethink Eco-Project is funded by DELTA group and by public funds from QREN32 

, which contributes with a grant of 2 million Euro. Company own financial resources for 

the project were not disclosed. 

The project aims to collect in the first twelve months more than two hundred tonnes of 

coffee grounds. Later, with the increase of end-customer environmental awareness and 

the multiplication of used capsule collection points, it sure will be possible to grow 

substantially this figure.

99 

After six months project, DELTA collected 477.000 used coffee capsules and added value 

to more than twelve tonnes of coffee grounds. 

As main results of this, under all aspects an innovative project, DELTA aspires to know 

and to devise alternative ways to extract more value from dreg and its wide utilization 

options. They vary from cosmetic industry, nutrition and energy to biological farming. 

Beyond the self-evidence of the critical importance of this project, must be underlined the 

absolute innovative approach and scope. 

If one takes into account 

that Nespresso recycling 

project is focused mainly 

on the recovery and 

further utilization of the 

aluminium capsule33 (as 

far as it is public from 

Nespresso website and 

traditional media communication coverage). 

Rethink-Eco-Project project manifests a complete and new breath landscape for dreg 

reutilization and to extract more economic value from it. It should be taken into account 

that DELTA as a leader of the Portuguese coffee market produces annually over 20 

thousand tones of coffee, which corresponds roughly to 40 thousand tones of wet dregs.

9 DELTA Q SUSTAINABLE MARKETING AUDIT 

In the next chapters will be developed and presented the actual sustainable marketing 

audit to Delta Q. The audit starts by scope’s definition and a brief review of the targets to 

meet against sustainable marketing basic goals P2 (pollution prevention) and R2 (resource 

recovery).  

Then the research finds the answers for the questions gathered trough the marketing audit 

checklists, where are covered the following main questions: company overall assessment, 

product assessment, distribution channels assessment, promotion and communication 

assessment, pricing assessment and target markets (or market segments) assessment. 

 

9.1 Sustainable marketing audit scope 

Sustainable marketing audit to Delta Q aims to achieve a comprehensive full detailed 

product profile, regarding its market characteristics and performance, in relation with its 

environmental footprint.  

In other terms, it is desired to understand the position of the product in the PSLC and 

identify its sustainability performance, waste generation by production processes and by 

consumption. The marketing diagnostic will enable DELTA to understand its strategic 

current position regarding P2 and R2 goals framed by strategic environmental matrix. 

It thus becomes possible to draw a comprehensive sustainable marketing plan for Delta Q 

under a double perspective: to drive sales growth and profitability by its own efforts and 

do so in an ecological and social manner, ensuring resource use reduction and preventing 

pollution trough waste management and recycling. 

To accomplish the marketing diagnostic, and since this is essentially a qualitative 

research, will be followed roughly the marketing-mix approach and will review in detail: 

 



 

101 

1) Product environmental impacts, waste generation by production processes, 

distribution and consumption; 

2) Pricing process and components, in particular, environmental or/and social cost 

internalization, profit margin available to foster consumer behaviour change; 

3) Distribution restraints and requisites for waste generation, energy efficiency, 

environmental and social issues and channel communication; 

4) Green communication assessment for environmental and social issues associated 

with product consumption, like alternative uses, waste generation and terminal 

disposal. 

 

Sometimes DELTA Cafés data is provided for understanding the landscape where 

DELTA Q was born and is daily managed. Other times, because there is no product-

specific (Delta Q) available data on the subject, like Delta Q’s specific waste generation 

while in industrial processing, or diesel consumption for distribution. 

On another hand, sometimes when researching a specific issue or process, the analysis 

ends on studying and assessing the company, rather than the product-specific Delta Q. 

This can occur due to the nature of the process involved, or because it is impossible to 

isolate clearly the Delta Q’s own process. This happens because Delta Q is one coffee 

product among many others from the company portfolio, including even tea. 

Nevertheless, and despite difficulties, every question was answered as close as the 

research demand and the data available has allowed. 

Financial and environmental data is provided in order to understand the overall present 

context of the company and product-specific, as a basis to define the window of strategic 

opportunities available, not under a theoretical standpoint, but rather feasible and at 

DELTA’s marketers reach. 



 

102 

Since present research is a qualitative study, special emphasis is cast on significant 

information in order to understand origins and constructs behind implemented strategies, 

and to devise probable consequences on the medium and long run for the brand. 

 

9.2 Environmental company culture 

9.2.1 Company environmental statement 

The company has an environmental commitment since 2002, when was granted with 

social responsibility certification by Norm SA 8000 from CEPAA – Council on 

Economics Priorities Accreditation Agency. It thus has also been committed to 

environment and sustainability and have incorporated that same commitment at the 

highest level of strategic guidance, which are the company’s very own VALUES 

STATEMENT as follows: “Integrity; Transparency; Loyalty; Quality; Sustainability; 

Solidarity; Social responsibility; Humility.” 

Environment also occupies an important position at the business principles to respect by 

DELTA management and employees: “Participative governance; Sustainable business; 

social and Environmental responsibility.” Moreover, the company took its environmental 

commitment really serious, and reorganized itself in order to accommodate new values, 

and guiding principles. To do so was created an environment management system with 

the following organic: 

 



 

103 

Figure 9.1- DELTA’s environmental management system 

 

 

This system, directly depending of the board counts, with a full time manager for 

sustainability that supervises every project that deals any in way with environmental 

issues. The system meets every forth day, and eventually as needed. 

To monitor the ecological impact of industrial and marketing processes, although there is 

a widespread academicals and business uncertainties on how to define and agree on the 

right indicators to measure sustainability34, DELTA selected an array of indicators to 

track, resumed as follows: 

 

Table 9.1 - DELTA’s environmental indicators

104 

TOE / Tonnes of coffee sold 

Rate between energy consumption and 

effectively sold coffee. It can be 

interpreted as sales energy efficiency. 

CO2 total emissions 

CO2 emissions are estimated by type 

and quantity of energy consumption 

like electricity, natural gas and fuel, 

according to APA36. 

CO2 / Tonnes of coffee sold 

Total CO2 emissions by coffee 

effectively sold. It can be interpreted 

as sales carbon efficiency. 

Packing waste production 

Tonnes of packing waste generated for 

coffee processing, packing and 

marketing. This waste is outside of 

Ponto Verde management system 

which accounts only for the packing 

casted onto marketing channels. 

Waste production treatment 

Total coffee processing waste 

generation by type of final destination: 

value adding or terminal disposition. 

 

To manage effectively the environmental impacts and constrain from coffee production 

and marketing, and as a direct result from social certification, DELTA monitors 

environmental stewardship trough the above set of indicators. DELTA has a rather 

equitable distribution of energy sources. It consumes a minimal quota of gasoline and the 

remaining sources' weight about one third each of total energy consumption, like is shown 

in the company's energy consumption profile figure:

Special emphasis should be cast on efforts to swap certain heat production energy sources 

from diesel to natural gas, which has more heating produce efficiency and burns in a 

cleaner manner, i.e. emits less CO2. 

The company has been implementing more cost-effective processes in order to achieve 

better environmental performance. Analysing total energy consumption, measured in 

TOE (Tonnes of Oil Equivalent), DELTA is reducing its energy consumption even with 

coffee production growth, like shown in the following energy consumption evolution

Regarding Delta Q's packing waste production, DELTA faces an adverse and low-eco-

responsibility awareness from suppliers and distribution channels. All packing systems 

are built to fulfil transport and delivery requirements, both from inbound and outbound 

logistics. Beginning with green coffee imports until hyper and supermarkets distribution 

chains, becomes boldly evident the disregard for re-usable transport and distribution 

packing’s, which would allow less packing waste producing and reduced distribution 

operation costs as will be detailed further on the present report. At the same pace as the 

sales growth, packing material and waste generation also have grown as evidenced in 

following graphic:

DELTA pursues a coherent conduct with its mission and values statement and in 

accordance with social certification granted. Thus from all waste and rubbish generated 

by coffee business, the way the company faces its commitments translates in a permanent 

effort to enforce 3 R’s37 environmental management principles, and that is evident by the 

amount of annually value added waste. As well as the amount of terminal disposal waste, 

without further valorization reduced almost 23% from 2007 to 2009, as evidenced in the 

graphic bellow:

9.2.2 Social and environmental reporting 

Since DELTA was first granted with Social Responsibility Certification, it issues a 

Sustainability Report every two years. It should be noted that Portuguese state, so far, has 

not made mandatory any kind of social or environmental accounting or reporting, thus 

every move from DELTA towards social and environment responsibility, sustainable 

development and ecological stewardship, has been an act of will.

Although Portuguese government had approved The National Strategy for Sustainable 

Development
38, and the respective plan of implementation under the form of law (also 

approved by the parliament), the effective result hadn't overcome the creation of 

commissions and group discussions. Which has supported and promoted several good 

ideas and odd projects, without any real impact on transporting for practice the 

imperatives of the new sustainability paradigm. Thus failing to help business companies 

to contribute and effectively participate in the change that humanity demands. 

The company sustainability report usually presents the following structure, which roughly 

follows the six strategic building blocks detailed above (see Figure 8.10): 

 

Table 9.2 - Delta sustainability report structure 

1. Introduction – Where it is reviewed last couple of years most important 

achievements at a strategic and governance level. 

2. Green coffee Sourcing – Accounting on evolution of projects related to 

coffee sourcing, farming communities, new projects and figures for 

volumes, conditions and relevant economic or social facts related. 

3. Coffee processing – Coffee blends produced, green grains quality analysis, 

toasting, milling and packaging processes, quality management system, 

treatment of complaints and suggestions and food safety. 

4. Marketing of coffee – Reports on guidance principles and relations with 

clients, both professionals and end-customers, as well as communication 

channels used and under development. It also presents marketing data like 

sales volumes by sales departments, number of national and international 

clients, distribution channels and logistics, customers retaining and loyalty 

policies.

 National Strategy for Sustainable Development was approved by minister counsel resolution of June 
30th 2007 with number 109/2007, and published in Republic Diary, 1st Series, Nº 159, August 20th 
2007. 



 

110 

5. Social responsibility – This chapter divides into five parts. The first part of 

the chapter covers the person’s management principles, equality policy, 

employee’s perks and benefits, health and safety, agreements and 

collective bargaining, employee's performance assessment model and 

training programmes. The second part reports on DELTA's specific 

environmental program – DELTA PLANET. The third part covers all 

initiatives, programs and partnerships related to community, like DELTA 

community support, associations funded by the company, child and family 

support, educational centres and volunteer programs among others. The 

fourth part is dedicated to R&amp;amp;D and innovation. And the fifth part is 

relative to partners and partnerships promoted or supported by DELTA 

group. 

 

9.2.3 Company current environmental and social programs 

DELTA is a paradigmatic case of social responsibility from the top to bottom level of the 

group. Starting with the early awareness of its charismatic founder until full commitment 

of management and integral support from employees is the only rational manner to justify 

the involvement of the company in so many projects, beyond every difficulty and 

obstacles within day-to-day business. 

Presently, the company is involved in the following projects and programs:

9.3 Target markets assessment 

DELTA launched Delta Q endeavour under end-customers market demand. Which in 

addition with already known characteristics from end-customers, like the trust the brand 

DELTA enjoys, level of distribution coverage and market share, was a determinant in 

favour of the project study, planning and implementation under certain initial pre-

requisites like the recyclability of the capsule, among others. 

Hence, no special market study was developed in order to determine significant product 

benefits or distinctive features to take advantage on. It was kind of a piggy-back strategy, 

once competition had already established product concept (regarding coffee capsules and 

proprietary coffee machines need). 

Once again, echoes the idea of misusing the opportunity to build a sound and full-

successfully product marketing strategy. Indeed Delta Q marketers would have a lot to 

gain in robust planning and effective budgeting if they could consider critical end-

customers insights regarding: 

1) Target market segments and their demographic and psychographic 

characterization; 

2) End-customers decision making models and buying behaviour; 

3) End-customers system-beliefs about green products, waste generation (by 

producing and consuming the goods), reusability or/and recyclability; 

4) Target-markets environmental perception about product category; 

5) Target-markets perception about company “greenness” or ecological and social 

commitment; 

6) Present and future green market-segments relevance for the company’s strategy. 

 



 

114 

9.4 Delta Q Sustainability assessment 

9.4.1 Waste generation by product processes 

Delta Q production process does not stand for any particular issue concerning pollution or 

waste generation in addition to the ones resulting from coffee processing in general. 

Delta Q capsules are made of inert polymer39 and are produced on the plant site with 

residual waste generation that is easily reintroduced into the productive process of new 

capsules. However green coffee processing deals with some environmental issues, like: 

residual ashes from toasting process, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and liquid effluents 

from grain washing and human related. 

Regarding liquid effluents production it should be noted that they are totally processed at 

the wastewater treatment station and 67% (2007) of them were reused in irrigation, the 

remaining part joins the public sewer system. 

Only one percent of total waste generation by coffee processing was toxic. From a global 

amount of 1.119 tons, in 2007, by 2009 was achieved one important goal: toxic waste was 

reduced to zero. 

From DELTA's total waste production, only 17% face terminal disposal, the remaining 

part is further valued or recycled. 

The most bulky waste the company has to deal with is related to inbound logistics and 

packaging. DELTA stresses the efforts to reuse (as possible) green coffee bags40. 

Packaging also poses important waste generation issues that have been limiting some 

environmental goals' achievement. The boundaries regarding outbound logistics and 

packaging are the direct results of the marketing channels pressures and end-customers 

demands. While retailers press for easy and more cost-effective (meaning small) stock 

                                                 
39 Polymer is a substance which has a molecular structure built up chiefly or completely from a large 

number of similar units bonded together, e.g. many synthetic organic materials used as plastics and 
resins (Oxford Dictionaries Online, http://oxforddictionaries.com, 22/02/2011). 

40 Bulk green coffee is traded in international standard 60 Kg bags. 



 

115 

keeping units and selling units. Consumers demand easiness to use with attractiveness, 

disregarding many times the environmental pressure from a small 20 cm carton box41. 

 

9.4.2 Design, use, composition and terminal disposal of the product 

Delta Q is a product-specific design to a target market segment, but due to its very nature 

(coffee) there is no other alternative use. So, there are some critical aspects related to its 

consumption tied with proprietary coffee machine. Even if the produced coffee-machines 

are much lesser than the thousands of coffee tons consumed every year. 

Coffee-machines are still a problem when arriving at its life cycle ending, regarding 

recycling and terminal disposal. This problem is being already addressed by DELTA, not 

only through the collection campaign for used equipments, but also trough one of the 

tasks committed to Rethink-Eco-project program, which aims to define new recycling and 

re-use standards, as well as the integration of recycled materials into its production. 

Capsules also pose important issues regarding recycling and terminal disposal of the 

polymer and the dreg. Taken apart each material is relatively easy to recycle and reuse. 

Polymer can be reused in the production of other lesser quality “plastics” after milling, 

and the dreg can directly be used with significant value and quality as a fertilizer. 

However, taken together they pose a critical problem: material separation. And take into 

account that the capsule contains also a paper filter film and an aluminium film for 

sealing. 

To deal with those issues DELTA launched the project Rethink Eco-project detailed 

earlier (see chapter 8.5 – DELTA’s Rethink-Eco-Project). 

                                                 
41 A regular toothpaste carton box consumes the wood equivalent to 2 or 3 branches from an adult pine 

tree (estimated on estimates from Boise Cascade, Idaho, USA, 
http://ecology.com/features/paperchase, 22/02/2011). 



 

116 

Regarding the capsule, since the beginning of the project Delta Q, the company has posed 

its recyclability as one of the main projects requisites, which are assured since launching 

of the brand. The same occurs for separation process of capsule and dreg. The challenge 

that Rethink-Eco-project also addresses is to reduce the cost of this separation. However, 

prior to face the problems of material separation, it must be figured out how to motivate 

end-customers to pro-active initiate the recycling chain by depositing used-capsule in the 

special collector placed by DELTA, rather than throw them for the domestic rubbish 

basket. 

The other issue that Rethink-Eco-Project also deals with is adding value to the coffee 

grounds. Although there are plenty of alternative uses for dreg, its adding value under the 

light of sustainable marketing boundaries and waste management principles, is only 

possible if economically viable. 

 

9.4.3 Alternative roles of the product regarding recycling, re-utilization 
and materials transformation 

Due to its own nature, once coffee is food and that is all the need it satisfies, there is no 

devisable alternative role for this product. 

Regarding the capsule, there is (so far) no viable field for reuse beyond creative domestic 

applications for leisure. 

For the coffee grounds, it is possible the direct re-utilization as plant fertilizer, which is 

common in many suburban areas. However, the same does not apply for capsulated 

coffee, which demands some industrial approach, due to small quantity of dregs for each 

used capsule. 

Regarding the exclusive coffee-machine associated to Delta Q, they are to be selectively 

collected at the end of its life cycle for proper terminal disposition after disassembling and 

retrieving toxic and non-degradable components.  



 

117 

 

9.4.4 Main product benefit to end-user changing or enhancement 

For the same reasons stated above, there is presently no alternative use for capsulated 

coffee. There is, however, some enhanced alternative use for the machine coffee 

proprietary of Delta Q, considering some design modifications. Taking into account that a 

good domestic Delta Q coffee demands water at about 900 Celsius degrees, it could be 

considered the viability of enhancing alternative uses for the coffee machine, like heating 

(or boiling) small water portions, since the physics behind are the same. 

 

9.4.5 Reducing/eliminating waste generation (solid or liquid) and toxic 
emissions from the production process 

In 2009 DELTA has achieved the goal of zero toxic solid waste generation. This is 

remarkable in face of the absence of legally imposed limits for toasting coffee industry 

emissions. 

Of course, there is always room for improvement. Moreover, considering the technical 

and scientific development pace, it is very likely that new technology and processes arise 

to pollute less, to consume less energy, or just to make the industrial processing of green 

coffee more cost effective, which will result in a shorter ecological footprint. 

Depending on investment costs, there is some viable opportunity to incorporate more 

recycled water into the productive process. Once only a part of the treated water from 

water treatment station is reused for irrigation, it is possible, trough a simple decanting 

process, to enhance treated wastewater quality, not for human drinking but for washing 

operations and WC flushes. 

Regarding plant illumination, there is also a new array of cost-effective solar-related 

solutions, in order to bring sun light inside constructions recurring to aluminium mirrors 

that concentrate the sun light. 



 

118 

Furthermore, a new generation of photovoltaic solar panels is emerging, with longer 

productive life, more efficient cells, and above all, cheaper prices. Other opportunities 

may arise from technical development on the way, and are worthwhile to be close 

monitored, like more efficient carbon sequestration filters for chimneys or more energy 

effective toasting ovens and mills. 

 

9.4.6 Waste produced by packaging at different stages of inbound, 
production and marketing processes 

To DELTA, packaging is one of the most critical cost drivers and waste production 

source. Starting with the reception of the green coffee and the 60 Kgs bags, where coffee 

grains are carried, and finishing with the packaging necessary for stock keeping, 

distribution and selling units to end-customer, there is an enormous amount of paper and 

carton, aluminium film and plastic film, and even wood. 

Inbound logistics produce essentially rubbish bags from the reception of green coffee. 

Processing (toasting and milling) produces an array of subsidiary input packages for 

coffee processing like cans (plastic and metal) and a multitude of rubbish from carton 

boxes to plastic bags of varied dimensions. 

At the end, with the finishing of the Delta Q capsules it is necessary to pack them in 

different 10 capsules carton boxes (selling unit) for each blend. It is then necessary to 

pack 50 boxes of 10 capsules from the same blend in a larger box (distribution unit). It is 

then necessary to put together 40 of these boxes to assemble one pallet (transport unit) of 

the same blend. Finally, the pallet is coiled with retractile plastic and is ready for 

distribution both for DELTA sales departments and distribution chains central 

warehouses. 



 

119 

Given the packaging classification from Ponto Verde, three levels42 of packaging were 

applied: 1st level (or primary) packing corresponds to the selling unit, 2nd level (or 

grouped) packing is the distribution unit and 3rd level packing is the transport unit. 

All of them are subjected to annual contribution for Ponto Verde, regarding the type of 

packing material and quantity and weight of packing launched into the distribution 

channels and consumer markets. Hence any intervention in the logistic operations, 

changing transport or distribution or unit-selling packing, can play an important role, 

either by cost reduction, or fewer packing materials injected into market and distribution 

networks, thus lesser mandatory contributions for Ponto Verde. 

 

9.4.7 Reengineering of packing levels  

Taking present the three packing levels described above, it looks very unlikely to the 

company to intervene deep at 3rd level (transport or distribution unit) due to two kinds of 

reasons:  

1) Shelf replacement and warehousing requisites from main distribution chains of 

hyper and supermarkets; 

2) Transport and handling of 3rd level packs, once they are built around international 

standard pallets (euro pallet43) and are fully suited for lorry transport and 

mechanic stacker handling. 

However, there are some opportunities for 1st level (selling unit) and 2nd level packing 

(grouped pack). It is very likely (with a little help from marketing communication 

specialists) to swap the traditional carton box with 10 capsules for biodegradable plastic 

packing (1st level packing or selling unit). Of course this change should take into account:

120 

1) The investment costs and payback  period for the plastic packaging machine; 

2) The “super attractive” design and carefully choice of the pack colours scheme; 

3) Effective communication campaign to present the new packing not only as “new”, 

but mainly as a environment-friendly packing, since it is biodegradable. 

This three step plan could very easily become a source of important marketing 

differentiation for Delta Q, as well as of added value proposition for end-customers, 

because plastic (even the biodegradable ones) tend to be cheaper than carton boxes. 

Furthermore, at 2nd level packing (grouped pack) biodegradable plastic could be 

introduced. This swap doesn’t need to be mass communicated. Instead it just needs to be 

well explained and presented to channel partners, using the same argumentation used for 

end-customers market. At this level, the only main preoccupation for packing 

reengineering is the necessary resistance of the biodegradable film for adequate transport 

of 50 packs of 10 capsule-bags. 

 

9.5 Pricing assessment 

DELTA assumes social responsibility programs and environmental protection 

investments under the most restrict and traditional concepts of corporate responsibility as 

discussed above on chapter 6.1 regarding the philanthropic obligations of companies, to 

give back to society, whom (somehow) contributed for company goal achievement 

(Carrol, 1999). 

Thus DELTA internalizes the costs of all programs and investments related to social and 

environmental efforts. Whole improvements, certifications, international programs and 

involvement with community or ecological issues, are funded by the company, depleting 

the operational profits. Of course this is only possible due to family type organization and 

effective shareholding of DELTA group. 



 

121 

The Delta Q pricing is based on the sum of costs (including green coffee imports and 

industrial toasting and milling), packaging, marketing and distribution. In balance with 

net profit contribution goals for the brand, distribution costs and shelve investments, are 

kept within the boundaries of the marketing leader pricing. 

Like any other FMCG product present in the hyper and supermarkets distribution 

networks, Delta Q is periodically stimulated with price lowering or quantity campaigns, 

resulting much more from store networks pressure, than from product marketing strategy 

or demand side pressures. 

In consequence, no social or environmental challenges are reflected in pricing. This is in 

accordance with the absence of green or community involvement product (or brand) 

communication, and leaves not enough space maneuvering for an environmental pricing 

process. Due to Delta Q’s own birth process (by demand pressure) in addition to the 

elected strategic marketing positioning as a “follower”, pricing strategies redound 

immediately in closed set of options. No accounting processes were developed in order to 

internalize and transfer eco-costs, or to fund the multiple projects, programs and 

investments held by the company in relation to environmental protection, waste 

management or social responsibility. Thus, also in pricing, Delta Q must follow the 

product category leader and restraint its aims, to practice some price. 

Again, the lack of open publicity on relevant and wide ecological and social achievements 

by DELTA, obliterate important (and deserved) marketing positioning and strategies 

options. Efforts being made regarding raising awareness of end-customers for the need of 

used capsule recycling, could benefit a lot if marketing management could encourage 

customers to keep and deposit capsules on the collection spots, with some money prize. 

Of course this kind of strategy would need the support of really effective special 

communication and “green” premium price, to allow giving some money back to the 

customer. 



 

122 

Although this is a bit risky strategy, since it leaves room for the competition price 

increases without any significant effort to justify it. Clear communication of campaign 

objectives and effective implementation of a simple money prize procedure, could easily 

obviate the risk. According to Kotler and Keller (2005) many empiric experiences result 

on unexpected end-customer positive price elasticity, and do not drive to market-share 

loss, when a proper price strategy is set in place. 

Moreover, reducing ecological foot-print could very well be a perfect justification to limit 

price conditions for distribution networks or to pitch a quantity campaign, in order to 

reduce the number of lorry deliveries. 

 

9.6 Distribution channels assessment 

9.6.1 Boundaries imposed to Delta Q production and selling systems due 
distribution channels requisites 

The boundaries Delta Q faces to coffee business development emerging from the 

marketing and distribution channels system are not specifically different from other 

industries. In fact, coffee industry is probably one of the most eco-efficient businesses 

regarding distribution network constraints. 

Portuguese distribution networks, along with other southern Europe counterparts are very 

robust and mature (Rousseau, 1997). From their stand, it is very efficiently organized 

under a concept pre environmental concerns and reverse logistics, of “one-way” mass 

distribution. They are near-optimal efficient regarding goods inbound and reception, shelf 

replenishment (mostly assured by brands’ employees) and managing providers for long 

account payment periods. Within these approach goods handling and easy packs stocking 

became critical to end quickly the distribution operations cycle. Thus all packing 

requisites mentioned above, mainly 2nd and 3rd level packing, were developed taking more 



 

123 

into regard physical distribution operations, than cost efficiency, or environmental 

performance. 

However, under sustainable marketing framework approach, some intervention 

opportunities arise. Distribution operation systems reengineering with the environmental 

commitment is possible, at a very low cost or even, with important savings. These could 

be undertaken by two tools from the framework, which are rethinking product as services 

and reverse logistics development. The 3rd level packing (transport unit) could be changed 

for reusable containers with same dimensions and capacity. 2nd level packing (distribution 

packing) could also suffer changes or even be eliminated if accompanied with an efficient 

store replenishment software, linking the supermarket store with DELTA plant. This 

would allow the implementation of a JIT44 production, storing and distribution 

philosophy, which is widely grounded and firmly proved. 

With this approach, reverse logistics implementation can be leveraged, once it would 

allow the back transport of collected used capsules with dreg, but also to collect back to 

sales departments warehouses and plant, the transport and distribution packs for refilling. 

 

9.6.2 Energy and pollution intensity from raw and subsidiary material 
transportation to plant 

Due to Delta Q plant location at Campo Maior, the company faces important inbound 

costs regarding green coffee and subsidiary material. Moreover, Portuguese distribution 

logistics is organized under a road transportation concept, which very much limits 

company’s distribution system options.  

This is a major problem not only for Portuguese business companies, but also for country 

economy, since over dependency on lorry handling of goods accounts for an important 

                                                 
44 JIT stands for just in time logistics management approach. 



 

124 

quota of oil imports and carbon emissions. This is also the main reason for the intense 

ecological footprint that characterizes the vast majority of Portuguese industry sector. 

DELTA is aware of this reality and with the extreme environmental concern, was decisive 

on leading a wide interest group to set up a container platform at the nearby city of Elvas 

(17 kms from Campo Maior). 

As a result the daily Lorries come-and-go between Lisbon and DELTA’s plant ceased, 

and was substituted by two merchandise trains a day. 

This shift represents a substantial improvement towards reducing carbon (and by the way, 

fuel energy consumption) footprint, by saving 226 kms lorry trip several times a day. 

Following is a map which shows the distance between Lisbon and Campo Maior, once 

covered daily by lorry and now substituted by merchandise trains: 

 

Figure 9.9 - Green coffee transport to plant 

 

 

9.6.3 Energy consumption due to distribution channels 

As already explained, Portuguese logistics are based on road transportation. Most of the 

times is not an option for a company to consider other transport and delivery systems. 

Since Delta Q is an FMCG45 product and due to the capillarity of the marketing channels, 

who impose a wide point-of-sale presence in order to maximize product rotation and 

                                                 
45 FMCG stands for fast moving consumer goods. 



 

125 

achieve increased sales (Marketing Channels, 2007), there is (so far) no other options 

available to delivery systems but lorry transportation between plant and distribution 

centres (both from DELTA and hyper and supermarkets chains). The distribution to stores 

is made by smaller vans. 

This rationalized distribution architecture allowed DELTA to manage outbound logistics 

in a cost-effective manner and lower, as far as it is operational and economical viable, the 

pollution associated with marketing and distribution function. 

Another theoretical distribution and delivery of goods systems to end-customers like 

postal delivery need further consumer awareness and major changes in buying behaviour, 

besides the highly direct costs associated, that are out of reach of DELTA’s marketing 

efforts by itself. 

Alternative transport systems between plant and DELTA’s sales-departments warehouses, 

like the railway, are only partially possible for some of them. The lack of global 

reengineering of distribution logistics on these terms, due to the excessive cost and 

coexistence of several distribution systems at the same time, make it organizational and 

economicaly unviable. 

The use of electric powered distribution vehicles isn’t so far of practical implementation 

but state of the art EPV46 lack of operational autonomy and price lowering due to the 

absence of mass marketing. 

In conclusion, the company as a whole and Delta Q distribution operations, are highly 

energy consuming (and an important pollution source) due to Portuguese transportation 

infrastructures and consumer demands and behaviour.

126 

9.6.4 Waste production due to distribution channels 

Distribution channel waste production relates mainly to 2nd and 3rd levels packing 

(grouping and transport) that becomes rubbish after each of the distribution stages and 

before final product consumption. For the purposes of waste production analysis, 

distribution channels must be divided into two major segments: hyper and supermarkets 

on one side and professional and domestic end-customer, on the other. 

In the case of the hyper and supermarkets related channels, transport and grouping packs 

consist essentially of pallets, retractile-plastic and large carton boxes, which fulfil their 

purpose at this stage and become rubbish.  

Fortunately, in Portugal, this waste category is largely recovered since early launching of 

Ponto Verde system, which assures the collection and further recycling for pallets, 

retractile-plastics and carton boxes. Of course not all the wastes produced enter the waste 

recycle chain, which poses a problem due to many little bits of uncollected scrap from 

each warehouse or supermarket facility. It is one of the inefficiencies of the systems that 

demand further improvement. 

Regarding the professional and domestic end-customer distribution segments, it is where 

the waste generation mostly occurs due to product consumption. First stage, at home or 

offices correspond to 10 capsules carton-box disposal. The second stage corresponds to 

capsule and dreg disposal. 

Although most of the country's cities are already covered with a selected domestic waste 

collection system, which allows families to separate it into three groups: carton and paper, 

metallic and plastic, and glass, the collection systems do not cover all urban and 

industrial/commercial areas. Thereby the capsules with dreg from Delta Q do not fit any 

of the above mentioned groups, once they are made of plastic, aluminium film and 



 

127 

contain dreg, which invalidate its collection for plastic recovery, and drives used capsules 

to terminal disposal at landfills. 

This was the main reason for DELTA to launching the Rethink-Eco-Project program, due 

to lack of adequate treatment of used capsules by municipality's waste collection systems 

(both with a selective collection and undifferentiated collection). 

 

9.6.5 Workforce training on environmental issues 

DELTA employees do not receive special environmental training. However, their 

comprehensive welcome process and corporate training programs cover deeply all the 

issues that the company is involved with, like sustainable coffee origins, Fair Trade, eco-

efficiency, Rethink-Eco-Project program among all the other already listed (see chapter 

9.2.7). 

 

9.6.6 Sustainability criteria for partners and providers selection 

Regarding green coffee, the company is deeply committed with environmental and social 

responsibility issues, like training farmer communities, child education and health and 

safety life conditions. 

In what refers to the subsidiary materials and other inbounds necessary for product 

process and packing, there are essentially requisites defined by environmental company’s 

own goals. This is justified for two orders of reasons. First, for some critical inputs like 

natural gas, there are no alternative providers in the Portuguese market. Second, for the 

remaining inputs where selection is possible, the choice is made on the pre-requisites of 

the item being purchased, and not on the environmental performance of the company that 

produces or sells it, as it is the case of the capsule’s polymer, which the absolute initial 



 

128 

pre-requisite was the recyclability, and so it became a basic specification for the project’s 

provider selection. 

 

9.6.7 Reverse logistics as a cost or profit centre 

Reverse logistics are a fact since the Rethink project launch. In the first stage it covered 

the back circuit from company’s sales departments, where initial Delta Q capsule's 

collection baskets were placed. It later has widened to cover also professional end-

customer segment, assured by company’s own distribution systems. At a second stage, 

with protocol establishment with hyper and supermarkets distribution chains, was 

possible to grow dramatically the number of capsules and dreg collected by reverse 

logistics for recovery. 

So far, reverse logistics is a cost centre, totally funded by company, degrading industrial 

and trade margins. However, Rethink project development is expected to reverse this 

reality, since the high potential value laid on dreg reuse, and recycling of polymer 

capsules into new coffee machine manufacturing. 

 

9.7 Promotion and communication assessment 

9.7.1 Delta Q’s environmental and sustainable communication 

Delta Q by itself has no special ecosystem or sustainable characteristics that can be used 

to project and/or communicate the company’s commitment to ecosystems stewardship 

and social responsibility. What makes Delta Q a more ecological friendly product is the 

processes the company deployed from coffee business upstream trough downstream to 

end-user markets, regarding social responsibility and environmental commitment. For this 

reason, the coffee capsule recyclability was a pre-requisite for Delta Q's project. 



 

129 

More recently, Rethink-Eco-Project was launched to find and develop economical viable 

processes to collect used capsules and to add significant value to the coffee grounds. 

DELTA does not use any of these important projects and abilities to communicate and 

advertise Delta Q. In fact, regarding mass market communication, the company has 

assumed a follower strategy based on irreverence, due to lesser communication budget. 

This is the opposite strategy from the main competitor, who massively invests in media, 

aligned with worldwide company’s global communication campaigns. 

Delta Q's communication efforts regarding initiatives related to reducing the brand 

ecological footprint, are still focused on interviews and magazine reports, and some press 

releases when Rethink-Eco-Project was launched. 

The same approach applies to the numerous company social initiatives, which receive 

only local media coverage or specialized media, losing opportunity to leverage company 

and brands awareness trough wide media coverage of brand’s environmental friendly 

features and special community and researching projects associated. 

The absence of larger marketing and communication budgets looks to have inhibited 

DELTA of fully projecting its social and sustainability projects' trough the means of mass 

communication, and making poor use of bellow the line communication strategies. Here 

is a wide landscape of innovation and opportunity to be explored and enhanced. 

 

9.7.2 DELTA historical commitment with environment and CSR 

DELTA’s history and its early involvement and commitment to the community and 

environmental issues, provided the first social certification for the industry in Portugal, is 

probably the best history possible to project a corporate, responsible and ecological “de 

facto” image and able to build an important marketing differentiation advantage, as 

presented above (see chapter 8 – DELTA Cafés). 



 

130 

However, the company does not take advantage of this so rich history in their current 

marketing communication. All efforts to project to markets company’s deep involvement 

in social and sustainable projects are developed under the form of press conferences, press 

releases and company owned communication channels like the websites and the DELTA 

Magazine, with limited audience and poor notoriety leveraging. 

There are plenty of opportunities to power up the whole company’s projects and 

achievements regarding social responsibility and environment protection, with minor 

investment costs and just by adding current communication and advertising campaigns 

with already done or in progress projects. 

Capsule recyclability and spots to used capsule collection, or the deep involvement with 

farmer communities with sustainability in the origins program, allow to achieve a “green” 

awareness and to differentiate Delta Q on customer mind, providing them with important 

means for buying behaviour and decision reference modification, in favour of the brand. 

 

9.7.3 Environmental certification and labeling 

Regarding the labeling issue, a dual situation emerges, taking into account Delta Q and 

the remaining coffee brands. On one side, there is some sort of company’s environmental 

and social commitment statement on the back of coffee packs, pursuant to type II labeling 

step emerging from ISO 14001 series certification (Hortensius and Barthel, 1997)47. 

Although that labeling none of them, clearly evidence the social or environmental 

certifications achieved by DELTA. On the other side Delta Q packs completely omits 

whole company involvement and commitment to sustainability and social responsibility 

issues. 

                                                 
47

 In Sheldon, Christopher (1997), ISO 14001 and beyond: Environmental management Systems in the 
real world, Greenleaf Publishing, Sheffield, UK. 



 

131 

Once again, important marketing differentiation and advantages strategies are being miss-

used or poorly leveraged. On the traditional product lines (both for professional and end-

user markets), DELTA packaging communication strategy lacks to tell the market the 

proud involvement of the company with actively promotion of coffee origins 

sustainability, fair price trade, and social enhancement of local farmers education and 

living conditions. The sustainable development statement printed on coffee packs back, is 

too long to provoke brain-impact memorization, and risks being miss-understood, due to 

the logotype not belonging to any national or international certification organization. This 

option constitutes a missing opportunity since DELTA has a social and environmental 

certification and has successfully implemented EMAS audit systems. 

Those awards and management systems should be shared with the whole end-customers. 

Delta Q packing faces several restrictions due to target end-market and tight image 

following strategy with main international competition. However, there is no risk for any 

brand damage, by associating Delta Q brand with social or environmental certification 

marks. Most of the end-markets companies which started to print these certifications in 

their product packs faced an overall awareness increase and, many times, also sales 

growth (Ackerstein and Lemon, 1999; Rios, Martínez, Moreno and Soriano, 2006; Shen 

and Chang, 2009). 

Moreover, according to Carolina Afonso (2009), there is a growing number of the so-

called green consumers with a very well established psychographic profile, like higher 

grade education and above average income. These consumers present a high rate 

conversion between green-products buying intention and effective buying (even in the 

Portuguese contracted market). Thus, it seems that important consumer trends are being 

disregarded, what can cause future problems by later communication with those end-

markets. 

 



 

132 

9.7.4 DELTA’s marketing channel communication on environmental and 
social commitment 

The company is developing a bold and important effort to gather supporters and effective 

partners for its programs and initiatives, both throughout supply chain and distribution 

networks. DELTA’s Rethink-Eco-Project involves directly the hyper and supermarkets 

networks once they constitute central crossing hotspots for customers with high 

accessibility, both for buying processes and for used capsule collection. 

Furthermore, distribution and logistics personnel are deep involved with these efforts in 

order to motivate and widespread the need and easiness of the environmental protection 

trough behavioural enhancement and habits change towards waste valorization and value 

harnessing from capsules collection and coffee grounds recycling. 

From supply side, there is also important care to find and trade with coffee providers deep 

involved with environmental and social issues. This is an outcome from sustainability at 

the origins program. Not forgetting the Shadow and Rainforest Alliance blends. 

Remaining suppliers are taught about company social and environmental commitments by 

traditional communication channels like the media, press release, DELTA’s specific 

website for sustainability and by DELTA’s magazine. 

 

9.7.5 Top management involvement regarding social and environmental 
communication 

Company top management presents a full breath commitment and involvement with 

social and environmental responsibility, assuming the role of the main projects and 

programs drivers. This involvement can be seen in two complementary dimensions: the 

governance level and trough public/media involvement. 



 

133 

Regarding the first dimension, since recent years, is widely accepted the positive and 

determinant impact of CEO48 commitment for CSR and environmental projects 

implementation and success. DELTA top management is deeply embodied with the issues 

concerning sustainability. Beyond plain image and presence on events to support 

responsibility projects, also as a result from environmental and social certifications, was 

created a formal sustainability management system with a full time manager and an 

annual working plan and budgeting (see chapter 9.2.1 – Company Environmental 

Statement). 

On the second dimension, DELTA’s top management is regularly present and heads the 

public presentations49 on social and environmental subjects. By media interviews, press 

conferences and issuing special reports on important milestones achieved50, or by 

endorsing the academic researching projects51. 

 

9.7.6 Sales-force sustainability and social responsibility training 

Social responsibility and environmental protection are covered by sales force training. 

However, it is not a special chapter of it but rather another component of the general sales 

force training programs, where the trainees become aware and familiar with the deep 

commitment of the company with social responsibility for local communities (both in 

Portugal and coffee sourcing countries), the programs and investments held for it, and 

what should be sales-representatives behaviour and speech accordingly.

134 

9.7.7 DELTA’s environmental and sustainability advertising campaigns 

The company does not communicate its deep involvement with environmental and 

sustainability in their media advertising campaigns. DELTA as a whole, including Delta 

Q is a poor media communication investor, and practices a following strategy from the 

main competitors. This becomes clear when Delta Q advertising used George Clooney’s 

(worldwide Nespresso brand face) unknown girlfriend. Even taking into account the 

humorous feeling of the ad's storyboard it is still a follower's strategy. 

DELTA's strategy miss-use the tremendous potential of marketing differentiation and 

advantages, that emerge from the communication of DELTA’s deep commitment with 

social responsibility initiatives and environmental programs. 

More and more consumers, in face of environmental problems and growing waste 

production, are increasing their buying intentions and effective buying of green-products 

(Carolina Afonso, 2009). Hence the lack of wide communication of DELTA’s “green 

concerns”, programs and investments, and moreover, the real achievements and 

improvements regarding environment and social responsibility, is itself a wasted 

opportunity. Not only for Delta Q awareness, but mainly a lost opportunity to raise 

environmental and sustainability awareness from DELTA’s end-customers. 

 

10 SUSTAINABLE MARKETING ASSESSMENT 

In possession of the data gathered trough the interviews and content analysis in order to 

answer the issues raised from the sustainable marketing audit checklist, it is possible to 

draw an accurate product’s profile regarding the overall pursued strategy, against P2 

(pollution prevention) and R2 (resource recovery) basic goals. 



 

135 

As previously discussed, this profiling naturally results in a SWOT analysis, which 

presents the advantage of clearly listing the future strategies building blocks emerging 

from product’s strengths in conjunction with product’s opportunities. 

Along the following SWOT analysis, several times will be referred “the company” 

instead of the product-specific being audited, once in those cases it is impossible to 

clearly, identify, the driver of the process (or procedure) being analysed from the product 

itself. On the other hand, because it makes no sense to discuss the specific toasting

10.2 Delta Q positioning: P2/R2 

Delta Q is a product-specific very aware of its ecosystem's impact and ecological 

responsibilities. The tradition and commitment to social and environmental issues 

patented by DELTA nurture a positive context to develop and launch responsible 

products. Delta Q holds some important ecological stress due to industrial processes and 

distribution, waste generation on production, distribution and consumption cycles, and 

issues associated with terminal disposal (both capsules and later coffee-machine). The 

way the management team addressed these challenges and developed projects to deal with 

negative impacts, provides a favourable product positioning regarding P2 (pollution 

prevention) and R2 (resource recovery) goals. 



 

139 

Despite those problems, Delta Q is clearly on the right sustainable path, and positions 

itself almost halfway to be a highly pollution preventer product, and just over a mid track 

towards resource recovery goals, as presented in the figure bellow. 

In the same figure was also represented a tentative positioning of the main competitor for 

benchmarking purposes. The de deduction of Nespresso positioning against P2 and R2 

goals was made upon the disclosed data on brand environmental involvement conveyed 

through press and from the product's website on the subject53. 

 
Figure 10.1 - Delta Q positioning to P2 and R2 goals 

 

 

Regarding P2 goals, Delta Q shows an important environmental impact, especially trough 

energy consumption and waste generation along product’s PSLC (Product-system -Life-

cycle). On one side, there are the capsule related issues, like polymer production (from 

oil) and subsidiary materials for industrial processing and marketing (mainly packing 

scrap generation). 

On the other side are the exclusive coffee-machine related issues like polymer production, 

restricted use of such a device (strictly for quality coffee domestic consumption), and 

terminal disposition of equipment. Although early pre-requisites for the product like

140 

capsule recyclability, the need to involve and actively commit the end-consumer and 

drive his consumption behaviour to change, in order to achieve environmental impact 

minimization for product life cycle, remains a long path to walk towards product 

sustainability. The absence of proper and efficient end-customer communication and 

adequate incentives to drive consumer decision models and consumption behaviour 

change makes P2 goals harder to achieve. 

Delta Q patents a better positioning regarding R2 goals due to the company own 

environmental and social commitment and most innovative and comprehensive projects 

like Rethink-Eco-Project. 

DELTA’s efforts to reduce CO2 emissions, to bring waste treatment to the level (already 

achieved) of zero toxic waste, and packaging waste generation close monitoring, provides 

product upwards improvement on the scale. Complementary, Rethink-Eco-Project 

objectives like old coffee machines and polymer capsules recycling for further 

incorporation in new capsules and coffee machines are also most relevant for R2 

positioning. The early results about dreg valorization and capsules recycling contribute 

decisively to overcome half-scale R2 positioning. 

 

10.3 Conclusions 

Delta Q, due to P2 and R2 goals positioning and company’s social and ecological 

responsibility, awareness and commitment, faces unique opportunities for marketing 

performance enhancement and sustainability development achievement. As a result, 

strategic options available are defined in the matrix bellow: 

 



 

141 

Figure 10.2 - Delta Q strategic environmental matrix positioning 

 

 

Available strategies are framed by market penetration trough product strategy 

enhancement, or trough market development strategy, respectively for current target 

markets or new markets as is the case of Delta Q Spanish market penetration. 

The relative worst P2 score is justified mainly by the necessity to involve end-customer 

towards decision-making models and consumption behaviour changing. To do so require 

a bold communication strategy shift and investment, which is a result of both previous 

matrixes cross analysis, market penetration and market development has much to do with 

broad brand communication and product development to become more environmental 

friendly. 

In the case of abroad markets, proper communication strategy on the product ecological 

performance and responsible consumer behaviour, supported by early reverse logistics 

system implementation, could very well be the key for greater and sustainable success. 

Once the core benefit of product cannot be changed, penetration and development 

strategies deal essentially with: 

1) Minor incremental product fine-tuning to become lesser ecological harmful. 

2) Development of broad end-consumer awareness and engagement on active 

behaviour changes to reduce waste disposal environmental impact. This is to 

participate actively in the recycling process. 



 

142 

These are R2 strategies, looking for comprehensive waste collection and increased 

recycling efficiency towards full waste recovery and re-injection onto the productive 

cycle. No matter if it is the coffee cycle or any other useful manufacturing, as long as it 

prevents used coffee capsules and dreg to end at the landfill, without further treatment or 

valorization. 

Of course technology plays a major role to achieve R2 goals, since there are to be 

developed yet, economic and industrial viable solutions in order to treat and add more 

value to dreg. Rethink-Eco-Project is a very good example of the effort to be made and 

perhaps, sustained, in order to fully achieve P2 and R2 Goals. 

 

11 RECOMMENDATIONS AND FURTHER RESEARCH 

11.1 Business recommendations 

Sustainable marketing audit, like common audits is a tool for management to make better 

decisions by identifying under performing areas or processes, by benchmarking, or simply 

by questioning and stimulating managers to do some serious critical thinking about their 

areas or processes of responsibility. 

Present audit was developed on a brand from a group with utmost awareness and 

commitment with social responsibility and environment protection towards sustainability. 

However, some of the marketing mix variables are being poorly managed in face of the 

important DELTA’s social and ecological achievements perfectly aligned with P2 and R2 

basic goals. To correctly implement a comprehensive sustainable marketing strategy and 

take full advantage of the achievements already made by DELTA, would be advisable to 

implement the following measures, to be understand as a road-map, since it would require 

more in-depth financial and marketing analysis: 

 



 

143 

1) Target market segment assessment – As much as a company feel safe and 

grounded on demand pressure from “loyal” end-customers to launch a new 

product, or significantly modify an existing one it is sound advised to perform a 

deep marketing research. Present marketing research methods are far less 

expensive than they used to be and provide a wide, reach and reliable knowledge 

on the marketing or management problem under investigation. It reduces 

uncertainty dramatically, regarding the planned investments. 

This rational also applies for an already marketed product, since it provides 

insights on end-customers behaviour and decision models, consumption drivers 

and motivations, estimates market size, delimits price flotation band, preferred 

packing, selling unit dimension regarding consumer and distribution preferences 

and requisites, among many other critical insights to make strategic marketing 

decisions more as conscientious options than guessing art or empirical 

experiments. 

 

2) Pricing – Absence of a proper market study for Delta Q makes it impossible to 

have a proxy to test market price elasticity, and further establish a comprehensive 

pricing process. However, it seems to be very difficult to internalize eco-costs (or 

part of them) from coffee production cycle. 

Nevertheless, recent academic research and empiric evidence points towards some 

end-consumers willing to support a price increase for well perceived 

environmental product benefits, especially the growing green end-consumers 

niches (Ottman, 1992 and Catarina Afonso, 2009). 

To be successful in such an endeavour, distribution channels networks and sales-

teams must be totally involved in order to pitch correctly the price modifications 

and fighting the hyper and supermarkets trend to transpose price increases to end-



 

144 

consumers, gaining better trade margins for themselves. Properly budgeted, 

planned and communicated, such strategy presents every property to be well 

succeeded, on trade margin creation, to reward the end-consumer behaviour 

change towards an increasingly active role on collecting and depositing used 

capsules into collection spots. 

 

3) Communication – Delta Q brand is making a very poor use of this strategic 

marketing variable, by two sorts of reasons. On one side the assumed following 

strategy presents very little chances of achieving any significant return on 

communication investment made, no matter how small it may be. Sustainable 

marketing is also an intrinsic combat against every kind of resource waste, never 

minding if they are from the environment or from the company’s marketing 

budget. Even small resources could be more effectively spent on other most 

important communication objectives, like raising end-consumer awareness for 

ecological behaviour and waste avoidance. 

On another side, the brand is forgetting the whole public recognised company’s 

commitment and achievements regarding social responsibility, absolute 

innovative programs and ecological investments with government funded research 

program and international social and environmental certifications granted. 

The first and urgent step is to stamp on Delta Q packs, the granted certifications 

logos, regarding those issues, in a phased and planned manner. 

 

11.2 Discussion, limitations and further research 

The present work is an exploratory research on Donald A. Fuller seminal work, which has 

resulted in the sustainable marketing framework. As far as it is possible to know, it is the 



 

145 

first attempt to operationalize the approach and to take advantage of the model to envision 

a comprehensive sustainable marketing strategy for a product-specific already being 

marketed, the capsulated coffee brand Delta Q. 

The framework proved to be suitable for practical enforcement and to stimulate 

management and marketers to think out of the box, questioning new processes, systems 

and other dimensions of the product’s industrial and marketing dimensions. The waste 

management approach trough the product-system life-cycle assessment brought into 

perspective a whole further comprehensive array of issues previously unexplored. 

Moreover, bi-dimensional matrix positioning of Delta Q regarding P2 and R2 Goals, 

developed along research a clear perspective on what remains to be done regarding 

product and attached equipments, to implement an effective sustainable marketing 

strategy and to achieve diminished environmental impact. 

Another area where the framework came to be unexpectedly effective was 

communication. Sustainable marketing framework provides a comprehensive set of tools 

to assess effectively every dimension of marketing management decisions and processes. 

By questioning and investigating the company’s social and environmental achievement's 

projection on end-markets was possible to identify an area of poor company and brand 

performance, in face of what are the real company’s commitments and achievements 

regarding environmental responsibility (P2 and R2 goals) towards sustainability. 

Therefore, the company is missing excellent awareness growth and marketing 

differentiation opportunities. Especially if one takes into account the most recent research 

and available indicators on “green consumerism” due to growing end-customers 

awareness for environmental issues, although often not being clear what are the behaviour 

models and decision drivers for environment-friendly products purchasing. 

Sustainable marketing audit also proved to be a more valuable tool for company/brand 

performance assessment and strategy building than the green model. According to Ottman 



 

146 

(2006) the green marketing approach has been many times unsuccessful due to lack of 

end-customer insight on decision models, behaviour drivers and motivations. Therefore, it 

becomes useless to invest in campaigns and communication strategies outside of end-

consumer concerns and awareness. 

Other times green marketing has suffered with poor product performance against P2 and 

R2 goals or lack of effective environmental features, what makes the task virtually 

impossible. One should not conclude from above exposition, on green marketing 

inadequacy or lack of effectiveness. Contrariwise green marketing approach is very 

powerful for successful communication if product beholds true environmental 

enhancement or feature benefit that the end-customer value and apprehends. 

Sustainable marketing as a comprehensive framework widely overcomes the narrow 

company-market communication perspective and goes further on questioning and 

detailing the product processes from top to bottom. It goes deep in product design, brand 

management terminal disposal or/and waste reinjection on the upstream of PSLC. It also 

covers the supply chain side by investigating company’s distribution channels, pricing 

process (including environmental cost internalization), communication strategy and end 

markets assessment. 

Above all it is a strategic framework model with integrated operative tools, which 

provides a coherent approach for marketing management processes, under a new 

paradigm approach. 

Moreover, sustainable marketing offers the tools to assess critically the product's 

performance and company’s profitability contribution, and to generate alternate processes 

(no matter if productive, transport, pricing, communication or packaging related) towards 

enhanced ecological stewardship and cost effectiveness. 

Those are the main benefits of a comprehensive approach to the issues emerging from 

social and environmental responsible management for the future. Sustainable marketing 



 

147 

does not break with traditional marketing management theory, instead offers to conscious 

and pro marketers an important steps forward, by providing a systemic reference model 

that evaluates every marketing (and management in general) decision against its impact 

on environment. 

Of course, as a recent marketing science development, sustainable marketing needs to be 

further tested against more companies and different products, not forgetting the industrial 

markets. Above all this new approach deserves a full comprehensive testing, from 

foundation theory to whole model's operationalization. 

Once accomplished the diagnostic task and the product positioning against P2 and R2 

goals emerges the array of strategic options available. Following, trough the 

environmental dimension added to Ansoff’s product/market matrix and the SWOT 

analysis, the logic next step is to build a full sustainable marketing strategy within new 

social and environment boundaries. 

A bolder ambition would be then, to develop a full sustainable marketing strategy 

implementation and monitoring, for necessary corrections and fine tuning. Such a 

endeavour could be set in motion trough an action-research project for two main reasons: 

1) Due to sustainable marketing framework novelty, it should be developed with a 

project-team, to allow multiple theory interpretations, and to stimulate creativity; 

2) Since it is to be implemented, it necessarily demands an empowered management 

team to be able to take decisions and to assure they are fulfilled by the company’s 

structure. 

 

As a preliminary, qualitative and descriptive study, the research lacks of reliability due to 

the absence of statistical validity. So, further research on the sustainable marketing 

framework should be conduced onto other products, markets and industries. However, 

management problems could be similar, each product, market and industry presents their 

own specificities against whom the framework should be tested. 



 

148 

Another area where further empiric research would be desirable relates with the 

internalization of the eco-costs of Delta Q in the pricing process. Such project would 

require intensive cost mapping and evaluating, and a full commitment of the marketing 

communication team, whom main concern should be the design of an adequate 

communication program, for target-markets, distribution partners and Delta Q’s sales-

force.
