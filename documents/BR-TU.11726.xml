Abstract  

Equity Valuation -  Galp Energia S.G.P.S. 

Cátia Maria Sousa Ferreira 

 

Nowadays, companies are involved in a fiercely competitive environment and are more 

complex than they ever were. As a consequence, the need to more accurately access the 

value of an asset or an opportunity is essential, when the overall goal is to grow and to 

prosper. Furthermore, the recurrent instability in the financial markets has been unveiling 

irregular company?s stock variations, which are no longer reliable indicators of firm´s 

performance evolution and ability to create future value.  

In this context, corporate valuation emerges as a leading-edge instrument for managers and 

investors that want to assess the real underlying value of their companies in order to make 

wiser business and investment decisions.  

Considering this, the main goal of the present dissertation is to value Galp Energia S.G.P.S, 

Portugal?s leading oil and gas company, which is currently quoted in the Lisbon Stock 

Exchange Market and integrates the PSI-20 Index.  

After a review of the fundamental academic literature existing, the company?s three main 

businesses segments as well as the debt tax shield were valued separately and the overall 

valuation was accomplished, considering the sum of the different parts. Subsequently, a 

sensitivity analysis was made and the methodology and results were compared with the ones 

used by two Investment Banks – Millennium IB and Caixa IB – in their recent equity 

researchs.  

The main conclusion is that each share of Galp Energia S.G.P.S. is currently being traded in 

the stock market at a discount to its intrinsic value. The future developments of its E&amp;amp;P 

projects – mainly in Brazil – and the evolution of macro variables such as the oil price, the 

international benchmarks for refining margins and the EUR/USD exchange rate will define 

the company?s future valuation updates.

Abstrato 

Avaliação da empresa -  Galp Energia S.G.P.S. 

Cátia Maria Sousa Ferreira 

 

Nos dias que correm, as empresas estão envolvidas num ambiente intensamente 

competitivo e são mais complexas do que alguma vez o foram. Como consequência, a 

necessidade de perceber o valor de um activo ou de uma oportunidade é essencial, quando 

o objectivo fundamental é crescer e prosperar.  

Para além disso, a recorrente instabilidade nos mercados financeiros tem denunciado 

variações irregulares no preço das acções das empresas e por isso os sinais do mercado 

accionista deixaram de ser indicadores confiáveis da evolução da performance da empresa 

e da sua habilidade de criar valor. 

Neste contexto, a avaliação de empresas emerge como um importante instrumento para 

gestores e investidores que pretendam saber de forma mais precisa o valor real das 

empresas como forma de conseguir tomar melhores decisões ao nivel das operações 

correntes e de futuros investimentos. 

Tendo isto em conta, o objectivo principal da presente dissertação é o de avaliar a Galp 

Energia S.G.P.S., a empresa portuguesa líder no sector do petróleo e do gás, que está 

cotada na Bolsa de Valores de Lisboa e que integra o Index PSI-20.   

Após uma revisão da literatura académica essencial, os três segmentos da empresa, assim 

como o valor dos benefícios fiscais resultantes do envididamento, foram avaliados 

separadamente e só depois a avaliação da empresa foi feita, considerando a soma das 

partes. Subsequentemente uma análise de sensibilidade foi feita e a metodologia e os 

resultados foram comparados com aqueles utilizados por dois bancos de Investimento – 

Millennium BI e Caixa BI – nos seus recentes estudos da empresa. 

Conclui-se que presentemente, cada acção da Galp Energia S.G.P.S. encontra-se 

subavaliada no mercado accionista. O desenvolvimento futuro dos seus projectos de E&amp;amp;P 

de petróleo e gás – maioritariamente no Brasil – e a evolução das variáveis 

macroeconómicas como o preço do petróleo, os benchamarks internacionais para as 

margens de refinação e a taxa de câmbio EUR/USD, definirão a evolução do valor futuro da 

empresa.

Preface 

Foremost I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Professor José Carlos Tudela 

Martins. As an academic teacher, it was him who instigated my passion for the field of 

corporate valuation when I first arrived at UCP as a master student. As the dissertation 

advisor, he was always a strong facilitator and presented me with a regular guidance and 

expertise thoughout all the technical and general doubts.  

A profound gratitude also goes to Professor Rui Pina Pereira, that despite not personally 

knowing me, exceeded all my expectations and spontaneously agreed to supervise a part of 

my work, helping me to overcome some detailed issues either by email or by telephone. 

Furthemore I would also like to thank:  Drº Filipe Rosa from BES Investment Bank for his 

assistance in spite of his busy schedule; Drª Maria Ascensão and all the team from Galp 

Energia Investor Relations Department for all the information regarding the company and the 

industry?s modus operandi; BPI – Asset Management team, namely Drº Paulo Candeias 

which during my master internship offered me the flexibility and means needed to develop 

this dissertation with a superior quality; Drº Carlos Jesus from Caixa Geral de Depósitos and 

Drª Vanda Mesquita form Millenium BCP for our productive discussions and all their support, 

knowledge and enthusiasm in providing me the foundations needed to better understand this 

multifaceted company. 

  

I am also thankful to all my family and friends that through all the process were encouraging 

and comprehensive, namely: Anneline Gouveia, Cátia Castanha, Susana Sousa, Taniuska 

Abreu, Teresa Gonçalves, Sofia Teixeira and Victor Barros. A particular reference to 

Elizabetth Sequeira – a noteworthy friend that accompanied me throughout my master 

journey providing me the strenght to go on and with whom I had the privilege to share many 

of my thoughts and feelings, laughs and tears.  

A particular acknowledgment to Fátima, Vasco, Cristina, Hugo and Margarida Pestana that 

were several times my home away from home and that with support and encouragement 

allowed me to better accomplish this objective. 

 

A special thanks to my parents for their constant support, patience and care and to whom I 

dedicate this project and all my successes in life. My love for them is beyond description and 

I will never be able to thank them enough.

Cátia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         1 

 

1. Introduction 

1.1 Dissertation?s purpose 

In this dissertation, Galp Energia S.G.P.S. (herein referred to as Galp Energia or Galp) is a 

valuation object and the main goal is to launch a valuation model for it in order to reach an 

accurate value for each of its outstanding shares. The valuation reference date is December 

2011. 

Additionally, it?s also an objective to compare my approach, assumptions and outcome with 

the ones applied by two Investment Banks. 

 

1.2 Motivation   

The main incentive behind the choice of the company is the fact that Galp Energia S.G.P.S. 

is one of the few portuguese companies with most significant growth opportunities.  

Moreover it?s the only oil and gas operator in Portugal and a strong player in the Iberian 

market
1
 representing a great source of value for the overall Portuguese economy and its 

competitiveness - the company exports
2
 are an important contribution to the Gross National 

Product and to the equilibrium of Portugal?s Trade Balance. 

As a further motive, Galp is a leading multi-energy business and a challenging valuation 

object due to its personnel features and high correlation with the oil price.  

 

1.3 Thesis Structure 

The dissertation is organized in the following manner: 

In section 2, a generalized literature review is presented, distinguishing the main valuation 

approaches and features. A special topic on the valuation of natural resources is offered. 

In section 3, a succinct description of the company characteristics, corporate structure, 

business segments, past performance and strategy in place is clarified. Furthermore, the 

industry, its players and trends are briefly analyzed. 

In section 4, the company?s macro environment is analized and a focus on the oil &amp;amp; gas 

outlook can also be observed. 

                                                

1
 According to the company sources, Galp?s market share for the refining products is 50% in Portugal and 8% in Spain. In what 

concerns the natural gas and electricity, the main market is Portugal with a 70% market share. Nevertheless, it?s also the 
second-largest gas operator in the Iberian Peninsula with a 15% market share.  
2
Through its subsidiary - Petrogal, it?s the major Portuguese exporter since 2009. According to Caldeira (2010), in the first 

trimester of 2010 Galp?s exports represented around 8,6% of the total Portuguese exports. In the first trimester of 2011, its 
exports increased 14% and by June, it was still the largest Portuguese exporter (Baptista 2011).

Section 5 presents the line of thought behind my SoP valuation approach, the main 

conclusions, the projected financial position and a sensitivity analysis. 

It?s also possible to find an attempt to value Galp through relative valuation and the 

inconsistencies of the approach for this specific company.  

In section 6, a contrast between the my valuation methodology and the ones used by Caixa 

and Millennium investment banks is done. 

In Section 7, I present my main conclusions.  

Sections 8 and 9 report respectively, the appendixes and the bibliography.

2. Literature Review       

2.1 Introduction 

Following the turbulent business, social, economic and political atmosphere in the last years, 

corporate valuation has acquired momentum and became “the financial analytical skill that 

general managers want to learn and master more than any other” (Luehrman 1997a, p.132). 

Koller, Goedhart &amp;amp; Wessels (2005) refer that it strengthens modern executives with the 

chance to make informed decisions about: the alternative business strategies, the corporate 

portfolio strategy and the effective capital structure to hold in order to sustain the company?s 

strategy and to minimize the risk of financial distress. In this way, it allows them to envision 

the direction the business is heading, to comprehend if the undertaken strategy is working, 

and even to access potential market inefficiencies. 

  

2.2 The Valuation Process: general approaches 

In current days there are more than a few developed theories and models that, in the view of 

fundamental analysts
3
, can be referenced and applied within a valuation process.  

There is an extensive amount of literature and Young et al. (1999, p.1) state that “we are fast 

approaching the point of valuation overload”. 

Nevertheless, Young et al. (1999, p.4) state that under specific assumptions, “most popular 

valuation approaches are different ways of expressing the same underlying model” and 

hence are “mathematically equivalent”. The basic principles are similar amongst the models 

(Damodaran 2002) and for Modigliani &amp;amp; Miller (1961), different combinations of variables just 

provide additional insights into the valuation process. Therefore, the choice of which model to 

use is just a matter of taste and convenience and should depend on the nature of the 

company and on the valuation purpose.  

Furthermore, in a valuation process each analyst interprets the reality and the information 

available in a specific way and perceives the future with a particular shape, necessarily 

making assumptions about doubtful events. As a non objective science, Damodaran (2002, 

p.7), allerts that “it is unrealistic to expect […] absolute certainty in valuation, since cash 

flows and discount rates are estimated with error”, particularly in young companies or the 

ones inserted in tumultuous sectors.  

To reduce the number of mistakes that the uncertainty of forecasts and market conditions 

introduces in the valuation process, the appraiser needs more than simply rely on the 

                                                
3
 These analysts compute the called intrinsic (or fundamental) value as it?s also the purpose of the present dissertation. By this 

technique, the company's underlying value and potential for future growth is determined using the firm?s financials and related 
data (activities, competition, growth prospects and macro variables) in order to reach to a stock value (Quirin, Berry &amp;amp; O'Bryan 
2000). This contrasts with the technical analysis where securities are evaluated by analyzing the statistics generated by market 
activity, such as past prices and volume, to identify patterns that can suggest future price movements (McAllen 2011).

Cátia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         4

straightforward application of the models equations. Young, Sullivan, Nokhasteh and Holt 

(1999) declare that the data reliability is more important than the valuation model chosen. 

Determining corporate value is part art and part science (Siciliano &amp;amp; Jones 1991) and as a 

consequence, the company future projects, the competitive and macroeconomic environment 

and its value drivers should to be carefully scrutinized. 

According to Luehrman (1997a) the models should always be a function of three 

fundamental factors – cash, timing and risk. The most popular models in corporate valuation 

can be analyzed under four broad and distinct approaches
4
 (Damodaran 2005): discounted 

cash-flow valuation, liquidation and accounting valuation (asset based valuation), relative 

valuation and contingent claim valuation.     

In this dissertation all four approaches are briefly explained. However the discussion will be 

mostly narrowed around the models that were considered as more suitable to value Galp 

Energia  – the DCF and the Contingent Claim Valuation. 

2.2.1.1 Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation  

According to Damodaran (2002), the discounted cash-flow valuation is seen as the 

foundation on which all other valuation approaches are built and the model with the best 

theoretical credentials (Damodaran 2005).  

In the 1970s, it emerged as the best practice for valuing corporate assets (Luehrman 1997a), 

and currently, Koller et al. (2005, p.4) observe that “more and more investors, analysts, and 

investment bankers are turning to […] sophisticated discounted cash flow (DCF) models as 

the touchstone of corporate valuation”. A view that is also supported by Damodaran (2005) 

and Fernández (2007c). 

Its foundation lies on the notion of “present value” (PV) which states that the value of any 

asset is simply the present value of its expected future cash flows, discounted back at the 

rate that reflects the riskiness of those cash flows (Damodaran 2002). 

It accesses the company as a financial asset (Fernández 2007c) and Damodaran (2005) 

highlights the following general equation, that serves as basis for the DCF models: 

 

where: 

V = Value of the company 

CF i = Cash flows generated by the company in period i

 A compact overview of the valuation approaches can be seen in Appendix 1.

Cátia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         5 

 

k = Discount rate for the cash flow?s risk  

Tv n =Terminal value of the company in the year n 

g = Expected growth rate of cash flows after the explicit period 

 

The company value is computed by adding two separated components: the specific forecasts 

over a limited number of years and the terminal value. 

Despite the DCF general formula, Damodaran (2002) observes that there are literally 

thousands of discounted cash flow models variants in existence. According to Oded &amp;amp; Michel 

(2007) and Fernandez (2007b), the basic differences among them lie in the cash flows taken 

as the starting point for the valuation and in the discount rates that are under each. 

Nevertheless,  if there is no mismatch between the cash flows and discount rates used, 

consistent estimates of value should be yield (Damodaran 2002). 

 

The Terminal Value  

The terminal value, often called continuing value, i.e., the value after the growth period, 

measures the long-run value and can be difficult to estimate with any degree of accuracy. 

Nonetheless it deserves a special attention since it represents the lion?s share of market 

value (Young et al. 1999).  

According to Damodaran (2002), there are three alternate routes to compute the terminal 

value: i) assume that the cash flows of the firm will grow at a constant rate forever and 

therefore use a perpetual growth model (as demonstrated in equation (1)), ii) assume the 

liquidation of the firm?s assets after some years and estimate what others would pay for the 

total assets at that point of time, or iii) rely on relative valuation, applying a multiple to 

earnings, revenues or book value.  

Fernández (2007c) also points out that although the flows are assumed to be perpetual, it?s 

possible to ignore some of them after a certain period, attending to the asset under valuation. 

This happens because on one hand, the present value decreases progressively with longer 

time horizons and on the other hand, the competitive advantage of many businesses tends to 

disappear after a few years. In this perspective, as the explicit period considered augments, 

there is less measurement error and the explanatory power of the results increase (Torrez, 

Al-Jafari &amp;amp; Juma?h 2006). 

 

2.2.1.1.1 DCF valuation: Equity Value versus Firm Value 

The diverse DCF variants can also be differentiated by the way they bring forward the value. 

Folowing this reasoning, they can disclose the equity value - when only the equity stake of

Cátia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         6

the business is valued - or the firm or enterprise value - when the entire business, with both 

assets-in-place and growth assets are under valuation.  

Nonetheless, it?s always possible to get from the firm value to the equity value. Whether it is 

approached directly (by discounting cash flows to equity at the cost of equity) or indirectly (by 

valuing the firm and then netting out the market value of all non-equity claims), the equity 

value should be the same (Damodaran 2005). 

 

 2.2.1.1.1.1 Equity Valuation Models  

In the equity valuation models, the result obtained is the firm value to the equity holders
5
 

(Young et al. 1999).  

The value is generally obtained by discounting expected cash flows to equity at the rate of 

return required by the equity investors of the firm (Damodaran 2002).  

These cash flows are the ones that remain available in the company after covering fixed 

asset investments, working capital requirements and financial charges and after repaying the 

corresponding part of the debt?s principal, as explained by Fernández (2007c).  

In this context, Damodaran (2005) brings to the spotlight two variants of the DCF valuation 

where the cash flows to equity holders are viewed differently - the Dividend Discount Model 

(DDM) and the Free Cash Flow to Equity Model (FCFE). 

2.2.1.1.1.1.1 The Dividend Discount Model (DDM) 

In the words of Damodaran (2005), the dividend discount model represent the oldest
6
 

theoretical variant in practice of the neo-classical DCF models. The dividends are assumed 

as the only regular flow received by the equity holders (Müller &amp;amp; Teló 2003). As a 

consequence, the current worth of a share is seen as the “discounted value of the stream of 

dividends to be paid on the share in perpetuity” (Modigliani &amp;amp; Miller 1961, p. 419), i.e., the 

liquid present value of the expected dividends (Damodaran 2005 and Müller &amp;amp; Teló 2003). 

According to Damodaran (2005), it?s possible to infer that, within DDM: 

 

where: 

E(DPS t) = Expected dividends per share in period t 

ke = Cost of equity 

                                                
5
 According to Damodaran (2005), equity and debt holders are different primary due to the nature of their cash flow claims – 

lenders get priority to claim the cash flows and equity investors get only the residual amount available. 
6
 The book  “The Theory of Investment Value”  written by Jonh Burr Williams in 1983, was the first to explicitly connect the 

present value concept with dividends (Damodaran 2005).

The cost of equity (ke) is determined by its riskiness and can be measured by different 

models such as the market beta in the CAPM
7
 (Damodaran 2005). 

To compute the expected dividends (E(DPS t)), assumptions about future growth rates in 

earnings and payout ratios have to be made (Damodaran 2005).  

Nonetheless, Müller &amp;amp; Teló (2003) note that the payout ratio and the growth rate in earnings 

are correlated. They clarify that if the company has a high payout ratio, it will have a lower 

growth in the stock value since it?s distributing part of the profit that in other way, would be 

retained and reinvested in the business.  

In this context, the different assumptions about the expected future growth of companies, 

shed light to the development of tailored versions of the DDM such as the Gordon growth 

model or the multi-stage DDM. 

 

The Gordon Growth Model   

For firms that are in a 'steady state' with dividends growing at a constant rate that can be 

sustained forever, the Gordon growth model
8
 is applied (Damodaran 2002). Within this 

variant, the value of a stock can be computed as follows: 

 

     

 

In this version of the DDM model, there are two main constraints in what concerns to the 

growth rate of dividends: it cannot be greater than the overall growth rate of the economy 

(since any firm cannot grow forever at a rate higher than the growth rate of the economy in 

which it operates) and it should be similar to the expected growth in the other measures of 

performance, such as earnings (Damodaran 2005).  

  

The Multi-Stage DDM 

For firms that are non stable-growth companies, some extensions of the model were also 

developed over time mainly in response to the need of more flexibility when valuing firms that 

are expected to grow differently in distinct stages of time and consequently have divergent 

payout ratios across the time.  

When compared to the Gordon growth model, these models fit better into the reality 

(Damodaran 2005), since in practice, given the volatility of earnings in most companies, the 

assumption of a constant growth rate in dividends is inadequate (Damodaran 2002).

 The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) was postulated in the 1960?s by Jonh Lintner and William Sharpe and even resulted 

in a Nobel Prize for Sharpe in 1990. This model is better explained in the page 13. 
8
 According to Damodaran (2005), the model was developed by David Durand and Myron Gordon, but it was the last one who 

popularized it, thus giving his name to the model.

Some examples are: i) the two–stage DDM that assumes two distinct phases with two 

different growing rhythms and, ii) the H model, presented by Fuller &amp;amp; Chi-Cheng (1984) that 

assumes that the growth rate in the initial phase is not constant and drops in linear 

increments each year, converging later to a stable growth rate (Damodaran 2005). 

 

Despite the large range of critics along the years, the DDM approach still has its proponents 

since: i) fewer assumptions are needed to get to the forecasted dividends when compared 

with the forecasted FCF, what eases the process and, ii) managers can set their dividends at 

sustainable levels even with volatile earnings (Damodaran 2005). 

On the list of cons, and as the same author explains: it undervalues companies with 

meaningful cash balances and it overvalues firms that pay more dividends that their available 

cash flows, since it doesn?t consider the potential future problems on external funding to 

meet the deficits in perpetuity. In addition, Damodaran (2002) adverts that it does not 

accounts for other ways of returning cash to stockholders (such as stock buybacks) and it 

neglects the value of 'unutilized assets' or other valuable assets such as the value of brand 

names. 

Damodaran (2005) even asserts that the fact that increasingly less practitioners use the 

dividend discount model in valuation is testimony to the belief that there are better ways of 

doing DCF valuation. 

 2.2.1.1.1.1.1 The Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) Model 

The free cash flow to equity valuation (FCFE) it?s a simple departure on the DDM, with just 

one significant change: the FCFE replaces the value of dividends in the models, as observed 

by Damodaran (2002). Instead of discounting the actual dividends paid by the firm, as in the 

DDM, it discounts the cash that could have been paid out in dividends - potential dividends 

(Damodaran 2005). 

The value to shareholders are estimated in the following manner (Fernandez 2005): 

 

 

where: 

FCFE i = Free Cash flow to equity generated by the company in period i  

k = Discount rate for the cash flow?s risk, i.e., the cost of equity 

TV n = Terminal value  

g = Expected growth rate of cash flows after the explicit period

Cátia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         9 

 

The FCFE are measured by the cash flows left over after meeting all financial obligations 

(such as debt payments) and after covering all reinvestment needs such as capital 

expenditures and working capital, i.e.: 

FCFE = Net Income + Depreciation - Capital Expenditures - Change in Non-cash Working 

Capital - (New Debt Issued - Debt Repayments). 

When comparing DDM and FCFE valuation, Damodaran (2005) affirms that the former 

should be adopted just if we are facing a company reluctant to changes in corporate control, 

since in this case, the dividend policy of the firm is unlikely to be adjusted. If a firm can be 

easily taken or there is some probability for the management to change, FCFE models 

should be the valuation tool in use, since they are able to capture a higher value. 

As happens in the DDM, there are similar variations of the FCFE models developed around 

different assumptions for future growth and reinvestment needs (Damodaran 2005).  

 

2.2.1.1.1.2 Firm Valuation Models 

The firm valuation models aim to value the firm as a whole, i.e., not only the equity stake but 

also the funds provided by third parties, such as the financial debt (Damodaran 2002). As a 

consequence, in comparison to the equity value, the major difference lies in the fact that it 

incorporates the tax benefits of debt and the expected additional risk associated with this 

source of financing - in the form of higher costs of equity and debt and superior debt ratios 

(Damodaran 2005). 

The same author suggests the following models to compute the firm value: a) the Free Cash 

Flow to the Firm or the Cost of Capital approach; b) the Adjusted Present Value; c) the 

Capital Cash Flow approach; or the d) Economic Value Added. 

2.2.1.1.1.2.1 The Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) Model 

In the words of Damodaran (2005), the origins of this model lie on one of corporate finance?s 

most cited papers by Modigliani &amp;amp; Miller (1958). It states that the firm value is obtained 

discounting the cumulated cash flows to all claim holders - also called the free cash flow to 

the firm (FCFF) - by the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). 

In this line of thought, the cash flows considered are the ones available after taxes and 

reinvestment needs,  but prior to any equity and non-equity claims.

The general version of the FCFF or the cost of capital approach can be presented as follows 

(Damodaran 2005):  

 

 

where: 

EV =  Entreprise value 

FCFF i = Free cash flow to the firm generated by the company in period i 

WACC = Weighted average cost of capital  

Tv n = Terminal value of the company in the year n 

g = Expected growth rate of cash flows after the explicit period 

 

To compute the FCFF and despite the diverse definitions, the subsequent formula illustrates 

a simple way to compute it (Damodaran 2005):  

FCFF = EBIT(1- tax rate) + Depreciation &amp;amp; Amortization – Capital expenditures – ? Working 

Capital 

To come across with the FCFF, we begin with the earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), 

deduct the corporate taxes (to achieve the after-tax operating income), add the depreciation 

&amp;amp; amortization since it?s not real cash and subtract the capital expenditures and working 

capital needs.  

The free cash flows are computed as if the firm had no debt and consequently no tax 

benefits due to interest payments (Damodaran 2005). According to Damodaran (2002), this 

happens on purpose once the concurrent use of the after-tax cost of debt in the cost of 

capital already considers the tax deduction for interest payments.  

This fact reflects one of the prevailing strengths of the model - any changes in the company?s 

financing mix is built into the valuation adjusting the discount rate rather than the cash flows 

(Damodaran 2005). As a result, the model is most suitable for firms that have very high 

leverage or are in the process of changing their leverage (Damodaran 2002). 

Nonetheless and similarly to what happens to the other DCF models previously described in 

this dissertation, there are several variations of the FCFF models – for example: a stable 

growth, a two-stage and a three-stage models - largely as a consequence of the future 

growth assumptions and on how long they are expected to be maintained (Damodaran 

2005). 

The same author also emphasizes that this model only values the operating assets of the 

firm and as a consequence, if the company has any assets whose earnings were not

accounted in the operating income – such as cash and marketable securities, the operating 

income from minority holdings and idle and unutilized assets - they have not been valued yet. 

Furthermore, to arrive at the equity value, all non-equity claims that have to be subtracted out 

to include not only all debt, but in addition all capitalized leases as well as unfunded pension 

plans and health care obligations. 

2.2.1.1.1.2.1.1 The WACC 

When valuing a company as a whole, the weighted average cost of capital – WACC – is by 

far, the average figure used as the cost of capital (Maruca 1996). It must reflect the cost 

associated with raising the capital - equity or debt or both – in the proportion to which they 

finance the company?s asset base (Fernández 2007c). 

 It?s the risk adjusted discount rate (Damodaran 2005) to use as input to the model or - as 

Modigliani &amp;amp; Miller (1963) refer - the minimum return that the company must offer to the 

investors to be just worth undertaking the project. 

The general formula is the following (Booth 2007): 

  

where: 

Re t = Cost of equity in period t 

Rd t = Cost of debt in period t 

E t-1  = Market  value  of  the  firm?s  equity 

D t-1 =  Market value of the firm?s debt 

E t-1/(E t-1+D t-1) = percentage that is financed by equity 

D t-1/(E t-1+D t-1) = percentage that is financed by debt  

V = E + D = Firm value 

 

Notwithstanding, there is room for disagreement among several authors about the practice of 

using WACC. Luehrman (1997b) establishes that the WACC is not good at handling financial 

side effects automatically since it just addresses the tax effects on raising debt. Damodaran 

(2005) by its turn, assures that the effects of leverage are reflected in WACC by two 

manners: i) the tax benefits are incorporated in the after-tax cost of debt and ii) the 

bankruptcy costs are mirrored in both the levered beta and in the pre-tax cost of debt. 

Another point of view is that the WACC sponsors simplification in the companies? values

(Torrez et al. 2006) since, in practice, is not adjusted over the years and remains constant 

over a long period of time.  

For this reason, Koller et al. (2005) and Luehrman (1997b) refer that WACC-based models 

work best when a company maintains or is expected to preserve a relatively stable debt-to-

value ratio. In the case of a volatile capital structure, APV
9
 is recommended as the most 

accurate valuation model. 

2.2.1.1.1.2.1.2 The Cost of Equity 

Although it?s a subject of controversy, there are basically there are two main approaches to 

find the cost of equity, as exposed by Fernández (2007c), Mullins (1982) and Cooper &amp;amp; 

Davydenko (2007): i) the dividend growth model and ii) the capital asset pricing model - 

CAPM.  

 

2.2.1.1.1.2.1.2.1 The Dividend Growth Model 

Using the dividend growth approach which results from the Gordon growth model in the DDM 

– as seen in equation (3) - the cost of equity can be computed as follows (Mullins 1982): 

 

 

 

 

 

In this case, is necessary to calculate the market?s current estimates of g, what can be a 

significant source of error (Mullins 1982). Furthermore, the assumption of a constant and 

perpetual growth rate in dividends inferior to the cost of equity makes the model inadequate 

for companies with unstable dividend patterns or which are rapidly growing.  

For this reason, despite of also having limitations, the CAPM can yield more realistic 

estimates (Torrez et. al 2006) of the company?s cost of equity and it?s the preferred method 

among corporate analysts (Maruca 1996).

2.2.1.1.1.2.1.2.2 The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) 

The CAPM, developed by Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965), marked the birth of asset 

pricing theory and is nowadays one of the most widely used models in finance (Mukherji 

2011). 

The same author clarifies that within this model, a firm?s return on equity (Ke) is a linear 

function of its market risk: 

 

 

 

 

 

The expected return on equity is the sum of the risk-free rate (Rf)
10

 plus a risk premium
11

. 

The risk premium equals the Beta multiplied by the market risk premium which is the 

expected return on the market minus the risk-free rate. 

Furthermore, the model only works correctly if we assume that investors are well diversified 

and consequently only exposed to the systematic risk
12

 of the investment, which is measured 

by the company?s beta. 

 

The Risk-Free Rate 

According to Koller et al. (2005), the risk-free rate is defined as the return on a portfolio that 

has no covariance with the market and it should be chosen to match the term of cash flows 

(Maruca 1996). 

Due to the high liquidity, in the context of valuation, the yield to maturity on long term 

treasury bonds is used as a reference (Maruca 1996). The German and French government 

bonds
13

 are the guide to get the risk-free rate in Euros (Damoradan 2008) due to their higher 

liquidity and lower credit risk when compared to bonds of other European countries (Koller et 

al. 2005). Also, the usage of year-specific risk-free rates is usually needless since these 

rates do not deviate radically over years (Damoradan 2008). 

 

The Beta coefficient 

It?s described as the security?s volatility relative to the market?s volatility (Mullins 1982). 

Maruca (1996) refers that it?s usually drawn from published sources, once the internal 

                                                
10

 The variable that sustains the CAPM reasoning (Mullins 1982) measuring the return on a riskless investment. 
11

 The extra expected return that investors demand as compensation for taking on that extra risk, i.e., for investing in this 
portfolio relative to the risk-free asset (Damodaran 2002). Higher-risk securities are priced to yield higher expected returns than 
lower-risk securities (Mullins 1982). 
12

 The risk related to the movement of the stock market and therefore unavoidable (Mullins 1982). 
13

 The lowest of the German and French 10-year government bond rates should be used (Damoradan 2008).

estimations of betas produce little improvement over the model. However, since it reflects the 

industry risk, the beta may need some refinements to adjust for the companies? differences 

related to financial leverage and others factors (Mullins 1982). 

 

The Market Risk Premium or Equity Premium 

The calculation of the market risk premium remains an unresolved issued for many analysts. 

A few models were developed to foresee it but none has gained universal acceptance since 

all bear some weaknesses.  

Koller et al. (2005) suggest that it?s possible to estimate the future market returns using: i) the 

extrapolation of historical excess returns, introduced by Ibbotson &amp;amp; Sinquefield (1976) ii)  

advanced regression techniques against observable financial ratios, such as the dividend-to-

price ratio (also defended by Lewellen (2004)) or iii) using the Gordon and Shapiro?s 

suggestion of a DDM, projecting future corporate dividends and then calculating the internal 

rate of return that sets the current market capitalization equal to the present value of future 

expected dividends.  

Nonetheless, it can also be reasonably obtained by surveying financial professionals or 

academics that make available their expectations for the different market?s risk premiums 

(Soenen &amp;amp; Johnson 2008).  

According to Damodaran (2002), the equity risk premium is the sum of a base premium for 

mature equity markets and the country risk premium. Nonetheless, the specific country risk 

premium should only be considered if the risk of investing on it, is non-diversifiable and has a 

low correlation to other markets. Maruca (1996) and Koller et al. (2005) affirm that based on 

historical averages and forward looking estimates, the appropriate base market risk premium 

lies between 4,5 and 5,5%. 

2.2.1.1.1.2.1.3 The Cost of Debt (Rd) 

According to Cooper &amp;amp; Davydenko (2007), the true cost of debt has to account for any 

expected default loss and therefore it must lie somewhere between the promised yield and 

the risk-free rate. However, this subject causes a lot of head scratching and despite of the 

several theories, most methods are hard to implement or lead to significant errors because 

they fail to capture firm-specific and current market information. 

Nonetheless, Damodaran (1996) states that the cost of the debt measures the cost to the 

firm of borrowing funds to finance its projects and it depends mainly on three factors: the 

riskless rate, the default risk and the tax advantage associated with debt.

As a consequence, to encounter the cost of debt before taxes, a default spread (depending 

upon the company?s credit risk) should be added to the risk-free rate (Damoradan 2008). 

Additionally, Koller et al. (2005) assert that is also possible to estimate the cost of debt only 

using the yield-to-maturity of the company?s outstanding long term bonds. 

Despite the calculation alternatives, the fact is that, for most companies, the cost of debt 

(before tax) is usually lower than the cost of equity. 

2.2.1.1.1.2.2 The Adjusted Present Value (APV) Model 

According to Damodaran (2002), the adjusted present value (APV) method unbundles the 

firm?s value, computing first the value from its operations and then adding the effects of the 

value of debt and other non-equity claims.  

Consequently it adds managerially relevant information to the company (Luehrman 1997b) 

exposing individually all the components of value and being easily adaptable to changing 

capital structures
14

. 

The firm value results from the sum of three major procedures, through APV. In the first step 

we value the firm as if it had no leverage. Within the second step, it is considered the value 

added (or taken away) by a given level of debt, computing the present value of the interest 

tax savings. And in the third step, the probability of the firm to go bankrupt and the expected 

costs of financial distress are appraised.  

Because of this, it?s possible to state that:  

 

Firm Value = Present value of business with 100% equity financing (Vu = Value of the firm 

unlevered) + Present value of expected interest tax shields (PVTS) – Present Value of 

expected bankruptcy costs (PVEBC) 

The following formula summarizes step one: 

where: 

Vu = Value of the firm unlevered 

FCFF = after-tax operating cash flow to the firm 

 

 

                                                
14

  In accordance with Damodaran (2005) and Cooper &amp;amp; Nyborg (2007), the financing side is not captured in the discount rate as 
most DCF approaches.

The step two is accomplished through the following equation:

r = rate that reflects the riskiness of these cash flows  

 
and the last step, although uneasy to estimate and recurrently neglected in practice,

where:

2.2.1.1.1.2.2.1 TheTax Shield Dilemma  

A worth mentioning subject of debate among a number of academics lies on the correct 

discount rate to use when computing the present value of the interests tax shield (PV TS) 

(Fernandez 2007a). 

Although Modigliani &amp;amp; Miller (1963) propose to discount the tax savings at a risk free rate 

(Rf), Fernandez (2004) demonstrates that this view provides inconsistent results for growing 

companies. 

One alternative is to refer Myers (1974), Taggart (1991), Luehrman (1997a), Cooper &amp;amp; 

Nyborg (2006) and others which consent that the value of the interest tax savings should be 

discounted back at the cost of debt (Kd), based on the premise that tax shields are as 

uncertain as principal and interest payments. Nonetheless, this cost of debt does not 

inevitably has to be the interest rate at which the company has contracted its debt and it may 

                                                
15

 According  to Fernández (2007), in a leveraged company, the required return on assets is smaller than the required return to 

equity because financial risk anchored by the existence of debt implies a higher equity risk premium to shareholders.

be the debt?s market cost, as observed by Fernández (2007c). Furthemore it will only work 

for expected debt fixed levels (Fernandez 2007a).  

Harris &amp;amp; Pringle (1985), Ruback (2002), Kaplan &amp;amp; Ruback (1995), Brealey &amp;amp; Myers (2000) 

and Tham &amp;amp; Vélez-Pareja (2001), by their turn, propose that the tax to discount the interests 

tax shield should be the required return to unlevered equity (Ku) since the leverage and the 

tax shields accomplish with it are positively correlated to the firm?s operating cash flows and 

therefore deserve the same discount rate. Ruback (2002) also supports this point of view 

stating that it is more reasonable to assume that interest tax savings share the same risk as 

the operating assets, with fluctuating capital structures, rather than rely on the conventional 

APV?s assumption that the interest tax savings are discounted back at the cost of debt 

supposing a constant the debt ratio. 

Regardless of these previous divergent points of views, there is another alternative to 

discount the value of the tax shields, depending on the debt strategy of the firm. Therefore: i) 

if a firm intends to keep a constant D/E ratio, an analyst should discount the interest tax 

shields with Kd for the first year and Ku in later years as recommended by Miles &amp;amp; Ezzell 

(1980), Lewellen and Emery (1986) and Fernandez (2005);  ii) if the amount of debt is the 

fixed factor, the interest tax shields should be discounted with Rd, in the words of Inselbag &amp;amp; 

Kaufold (1997) and Ruback (2002). 

Taggart (1991) by its turn explores another path and suggests using Miles &amp;amp; Ezzell (1980) 

point of view if the target debt ratio of the company is adjusted once a year and Harris &amp;amp; 

Pringle (1985) theory if the company adjusts to that ratio continuously.  

Reflecting this lack of consensus, the finance literature does not clarifies which discount rate 

is theoretically correct (Fernandez 2007a).  

2.2.1.1.1.2.3 The Capital Cash Flow (CCF) Model 

The capital cash flow (CCF) valuation or the compressed APV approach was presented by 

Kaplan &amp;amp; Ruback (1995) and within this view, the firm value is computed using the capital 

cash flows discounted back at the expected asset return (Ruback 2002).  

The cash flows considered are the after-tax cash flows available to all capital providers - both 

debt and equity investors (Kaplan &amp;amp; Ruback 1995). Therefore they include the debt tax 

shields, assuming a similar systematic risk between the interest tax shield and the operating 

free cash flow (Cooper &amp;amp; Nyborg 2007). Furthermore, and because the interest tax shields 

are included in the CCF, the appropriate discount rate is before taxes and corresponds to the  

WACC.

The general principle is the following: 

 

 

where, 

 

 

and,         

 

In the words of Ruback (2002), this model is more useful than others, when we are dealing 

with highly leveraged transactions, restructurings, project transactions and other instances 

where the capital structure changes over time. 

When compared with the APV conventional model, the major difference is that the CCF 

method discounts the tax shields at WACCBT rather than at the cost of debt (Rd) (typically a 

lower rate) as in the APV. As a result the value through APV will be higher because they 

implicitly assume the debt level to be a fixed amount and consequently the tax shields are 

treated as less risky when compared to the firm assets. 

2.2.1.1.1.2.4 Excess Returns Models - the case of Economic Value Added (EVA)  

The excess return models are seen as another variant of the DCF approach and consider 

that any investment only adds value to a business if it?s able to generate excess returns, i.e., 

the returns on equity (or capital) have to exceed the cost of equity (or capital) as explained 

by Damodaran (2005).  

One of its variants that has acquired momentum, is the Economic Value Added (EVA) that  

measures the surplus value created by an investment or a portfolio of investments 

(Damodaran 2005). 

The mathematical reasoning behind it, is that: 

EVA = (Return on capital invested – Cost of capital) x (Capital invested) 

        = After-tax operating income – (Cost of capital) x (Capital invested) 

  (15)

In this way, the NPV of a project measured using the EVA is “the present value of the 

economic value added by that project over its life” (Damodaran 2005, p.732) and it?s 

calculated in the following way: 

 

 

 

 

Whe the purpose is corporate valuation, Damodaran (2002) states that, the firm value can be 

seen as the sum of the capital invested currently in the firm and the present value of the 

excess returns that the firm expects to make in the future, i.e.: 

 

Or more explicitly: 

 

Furthermore, due to the connection between EVA and NPV it?s possible to value a firm just 

substituting the NPV by the EVA in the previous formula (Damodaran 2005), as evidenced 

next: 

 

As a consequence, the firm value can be written as the sum of three components - the 

capital invested in assets in place, the economic value added by these assets and the 

expected economic value that will be added by future investments (Damodaran 2005). 

The same author also explains that the other variants of EVA – such as Economic Profit or 

Cash flow return on investment (CFROI) models – differ essentially on how excess returns 

are computed. 

Still, most analysts face serious obstacles to get reasonable estimates for the variables that 

serve as inputs to the model, and for that reason the approach is not widely used.

2.2.1.2 Liquidation and Accounting Valuation  

Also known as the balance sheet-based techniques or assets based valuation, this approach 

neglects the fact that a firm is an on-going-entity and focuses primarily on valuing the firm?s 

assets in place.  

In this way, is usually not recommended for companies with meaningful growth opportunities 

(Damodaran 2005) because most of their value comes from their growth assets
16

 and is not 

reflected in the current account statements. Using balance sheet-based techniques would 

disclose over conservative estimatives of value (Fernández 2007c). 

Nevertheless, Bhojraj &amp;amp; Lee (2002) observe that it?s commonly used approach when valuing 

real estate and distressed firms. 

Some examples to approach value through these techniques are: the book value, the 

adjusted book value, the residual income and the liquidation value, as referred by 

Damodaran (2005) and Fernández (2007c). Since they were not considered as valuation 

methods for the purpose of this dissertation, I will not further develop this topic.  

2.2.1.3 Relative Valuation  

Also known as the multiples approach, relative valuation is an income statement-based 

method, where the value of any asset is priced based upon how similar assets are priced in 

the market (Damodaran 2005). It implicitly assumes that the other firms in the industry are 

comparable to the firm being valued and that the market, on average, prices them correctly 

(Damodaran 2002). 

According to Lie &amp;amp; Lie (2002), it demands calculating particular multiples for a set of 

comparable companies (peer group) and then finding the implied value of the company of 

interest, based on the benchmark multiples. This value is estimated by multiplying the 

multiple by the relevant financial figure of the company under valuation. 

It?s usually used as a supplement to DCF in a second stage of valuation (Lie &amp;amp; Lie 2002) 

where it can be helpful to test plausibility and accuracy of the cash flows forecasts, to explain 

differences among the companies? performance and to generate additional insights into value 

creating factors (Koller et al. 2005). Furthermore it?s also a valid method to use when 

computing the terminal value or even when valuing minority interests, according to Koller et 

al. (2005).

 The investments that the business is expected to make in the future (Damodaran 2005).

Cátia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         21 

 

Nevertheless, in the words of Fernández (2001), it?s a highly questionable method, guardian 

of a broad dispersion since it?s too affected by one-time events, rarely accounts for future 

events and handles the companies? risk differences based on rules-of-thumb. 

There is an infinite number of multiples (Koller et al. 2005) but Fernández (2001) categorizes 

them into three major groups: i) multiples based on the equity value – such as PER, 

Price/Sales, Price/Book Value, Price/Output; ii) multiples based on the company?s value – 

such as EV/EBITDA, EV/Sales, EV/FCF and iii) growth-referenced multiples – such as PER 

to EPS Growth, EV/EBITDA Growth, along with others. 

Although there is no consensus as to which multiple performs best (Lie &amp;amp; Lie 2002), 

Fernández (2001) identifies PER and EV/EBITDA among the most popular ones. On the 

other side, Koller et al. (2005) refer that  EV multiples can be preferable since they minimize 

the effects of the capital structure and non-operating items, unlike PER for example. 

Nonetheless, Fernández (2001) argues that the multiples selection should be made 

considering the company and the industry unique characteristics. 

 

The peer group  

Despite the apparent simplicity, the selection of the comparable firms can be a source of 

manipulation, threatening the model?s credibility (Bhojraj &amp;amp; Lee 2002).  

Besides excluding the “abnormal” firms, Koller et al. (2005) defend that the selection of pure 

play proxies firms should be made, adjusting for differences across assets and considering 

similar prospects for the expected growth rates, returns on invested capital, capital structures 

and also the SIC
17

  codes or the GICS
18

 system. 

Recognizing the difficulty in practice to measure all these aspects in the potential peer group, 

Damodaran (2005) observes that most analysts consider comparables firms as the ones in 

the same business or businesses, i.e., based on the industry classification, and then adjust 

their sample according to other factors such as size.  

2.2.1.4 Contingent Claim Valuation  

The contingent claim valuation is the only valuation approach that accounts for the value of 

managerial flexibility (Koller et al. 2005), i.e., the value obtained from the possibility that 

managers have to postpone decisions and to do the best when the time comes, based on 

market evolution (Luehrman 1997a).

In the words of Damodaran (1996), it?s designed to price assets (financial or real)
19

 with 

“option-like” characteristics that permit arbitrage, in distinct possible states of the world. The 

prices obtained are the payoffs which are contingent on the occurrence of specific events.  

Since almost all corporate liabilities can be viewed as combinations of options (Black &amp;amp; 

Scholes 1973), it?s seen as a promising approach in the context of valuation (Luehrman 

1997a). 

Notwithstanding, Koller et al. (2005) emphasize that it?s more suitable when valuing 

companies with a single product, companies in a commodity-based industry
20

 – that deal, for 

example with investments in oil and gas fields, refining facilities, chemical plants and power 

generators -, companies in (or near) distress or even in high-technology firms, since the most 

valuable things these firms generally own are golden business opportunities. 

In financial terms, these opportunities are similar to options (Luehrman 1997a), and to value 

them there are basically two techniques (Koller et al. 2005): the Black-Scholes Option Pricing 

Model (BSOPM) and the Decision Tree Analysis (DTA), focused on the binominal model. 

Despite the fact that the BSOPM is theoretically superior to DTA (Koller et al. 2005), none 

can replace conventional DCF since valuing an option still requires knowing the value of the 

underlying assets, typically not simply observable. Consequently, Luehrman (1997a) defends 

that this approach should be used as a supplement for the valuation methodology already in 

use.  

For the purpose of this dissertation only the BSOPM will be here clarified. A brief explanation 

of the Binominal model is in Appendix 2. 

 

2.2.1.4.1The background reasoning 

In the words of Luehrman (1997a), an option
21

 is a contract which provides the holder with 

the right – but not the obligation – to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an underlying asset 

(S) at a specific price (strike or exercise price - X) on or before some future date (expiration 

or maturity date). For that right, the buyer pays a call price.  

 

 

 

                                                
19

 The financial options are based on assets which are traded, such as warrants. Contrary, the so called real options, are based 
on untraded assets, i.e., on real assets, such as commodities, real estate or investment projects - such as investments in oil 
reserves (Damodaran 2002). 
20

 An industry where companies trade commodities which are basic goods, such as grains, gold, iron, oil and natural gas that 
are usually used as inputs in the production of other goods or services or are desired as investments in their own right 
(Damodaran 2009). The basic idea is that there is little differentiation between the commodity coming from one producer and 
the same commodity from another producer. Recently, the definition has even expanded to include financial products such as 
foreign currencies and indexes. 

21
 That is termed American if the right to buy or sell can be exercised at any time up to maturity date and European, if this right 

can only be exercised at maturity (Black &amp;amp; Scholes 1973).

If it?s a call option, at expiration, the buyer only exercises its right if the underlying asset (S) &gt; 

striking price (K). In this case, the net payoff = S – K - call price. Otherwise the call option is 

almost sure to expire without being exercised so its value will be zero (Black &amp;amp; Scholes 

1973). 

If it?s a put option, at expiration, the buyer only exercises its right if the underlying asset (S) &amp;lt;

striking price (K) and in this case, the net payoff = S – K - put price (Figure 2).

2.2.1.4.2 The Black Scholes Theory for Option Pricing 

According to Damodaran (1996), the BSOPM, developed by Black &amp;amp; Scholes (1973) and 

Merton (1973) is one limiting case of the binomial model with the difference is that it does not 

requires so many inputs as the last one. 

It works based on the assumption that the stock price fluctuates in random Brownian 

movements
22

 (Dickens and Lohrenz 1996) and that the price behavior of the underlying 

security follows a lognormal distribution
23

 of returns (Damodaran 1996).  

While the Black-Scholes option pricing model presupposes that the stock pays no dividends 

payments and the option can not be exercise until maturity – European type (Dickens and 

Lohrenz 1996) - it can be modified to allow for both (Damodaran 2002).  

Damodaran (1996) states that the value of a call in the BSOPM can be written as follows: 

where, 

 

The valuation process is made within 4 main steps: 

In the first step, the inputs to the Black Scholes model are used to estimate d1 and d2. 

In this context and to estimate the price?s volatility, three main alternatives exist: rely on the 

historical volatility, use the forward-looking implied volatility or compute it through other 

complex dynamic models. Brous, Ince &amp;amp; Popova (2010) and Corrado &amp;amp; Miller (2006) 

                                                

22
 The asset rate of returns is continuously compounded following a geometric Brownian motion model or Wiener process (Hull 

2008) where a particle subject to a large number of small molecular shocks is analyzed. 
23

 A variable is lognormal distributed if its logarithm (or log) is normally distributed. Stating that the asset prices are lognormal is 
equivalent to say that its returns are normally distributed (Anon 2010).

advocate that the past volatility is often an unreliable predictor of future volatility and that the 

option implied forecast of return volatility outperforms the other methods. 

In the second step, the cumulative normal distribution functions - N(d1) and  N(d2) - are 

estimated. 

The third assignment is to estimate the present value of the exercise price as follows: 

And the last task is to finally value of the call as showed in equation (23). 

After finding out the call value, the value of a put can be easily isolated through the arbitrage 

relationship - the Put-Call Parity (Damodaran 1996). 

Within this: 

Where C is the value of the call and P is the value of the put, with the same life and exercise 

price.

2.3 Valuing Natural Resources 

Natural resource companies – such as oil and mining companies – generate their cash flows 

from their existing under development reserves and from the undeveloped reserves that they 

own and can develop at a time of their choice, presumably when the price of the resource is 

high (Damodaran 2002).  

The resources? value is, in theory, a function of the quantity of the resource and its current 

price (Damodaran 2009). But as the quantity is typically known, their value ends up being  

almost entirely a function of the movements of the commodity price.  

As a consequence, very uncertain earnings and cash flows are expected. When commodity 

prices are on the upswing, all companies that produce that commodity benefit, whereas 

during a downturn, the opposite happens (Damodaran 2009). 

Furthermore, since managers get to observe the commodity price before they make 

decisions, as the reserve value rises and falls, the owner of the reserve will compare the 

value to the cost of developing
24

 the reserve and will only develop it if the value exceeds the 

development cost, what can be compared to valuing a call option (Damodaran 2009).  

The potential payoff is as illustrated below:  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Source: Damodaran (2009) 

According to Dickens &amp;amp; Lohrenz (1996), Paddock et al. (1988) and Damodaran (2009), 

evaluating of oil and gas assets should then entail an option pricing theory using real options. 

When compared to a conventional DCF valuation, Damodaran (2009) acknowledges that the 

contingent claim valuation adds a premium
25

 to the former value, to reflect the optionality. In 

addition, it makes an efficent use of market data mittigating the need to use (among others) 

                                                
24

 Any holder of petroleum leases must pass through three stages before he can obtain hydrocarbons below the ground: 
exploration, development, and extraction (Paddock et al. 1988, p. 483). These stages will be better explained in Appendix 3. 
25

  Which is positively correlated to the volatility of commodity prices (Damodaran 2009).

 (Paddock et al. 

1988). Consequently, is less subject to error.  

 

Damodaran (2009) affirms that the analyst should value the undeveloped reserves as 

options and value reserves already under development with conventional DCF models. 

As regards the value of undeveloped petroleum leases, one can: i) value each individual 

undeveloped reserve as an option (and then cumulate the value of the options to get the firm 

value) or, ii)  value the sum of all undeveloped reserves as an option. 

Although the first alternative is normally preferred, a guide to calculate the model?s standard 

inputs for each alternative, is suggested by Damodaran (2009):

 Within DCF valuations, analysts regularly resort to simple rules of thumb such as “use 20 percent for the exploration phase 
and 10 percent thereafter” (Paddock et al. 1988, p. 483), for the discount rate.

In order to calculate S, and once the resources cannot be extracted instantaneously, an 

adjustment should be made, discounting back the current value of the undeveloped reserve 

(S) at the dividend yield, which is what you loose while we wait to start the extraction 

(Damodaran 2009). 

 

Within the literature, other authors such as Brennan &amp;amp; Schwartz (1985);  Dickens &amp;amp; Lohrenz 

(1996); Osmundsen, Asche, Misund &amp;amp; Mohn (2006); Paddock et al. (1988) and Quirin, Berry 

&amp;amp; O'Bryan (2000) suggest alternative approaches to embrace the value of these commodity 

companies. However, their proposed methods explicitly require an amount of information that 

the companies usually do not disclose. For that reason and due to the dissertation length 

limitation, they were not here exposed.

3.1 The company in a few words 

3.1.1. The history 

The history of Galp Energia dates back to the 18th century and is closely related to 

Portugal's industrial development. Nonetheless the company as we know it was only 

established in the 22
nd 

 of April 1999 under the name - Petróleos e Gás de Portugal, SGPS, 

S.A. and resulted from the merger, acquisition and integration of several companies such as 

Petrogal - Portugal's sole refiner and the main distributor of oil products - and Gás de 

Portugal – the country?s main natural gas importer in charge of its transport and distribution 

domestically. It was the vehicle for restructuring the Portuguese oil and natural gas sectors.  

Along the years, it developed and expanded its businesses and currently the group 

integrates many subsidiaries
27

 companies in Portugal, Spain and other worldwide
28

 locations.  

The company also became the single integrated Portuguese multi-energy operator, 

performing in a broad spectrum of the energy chain, from exploration and production of crude 

oil and natural gas to the supply of energy products and services to the end consumers. 

3.1.2 The shareholder structure

indirectly - through Caixa Geral de Depósitos (CGD) - controls a total stake of 8% and the 

remaining capital is traded freely in the Euronext covered by investidors from 26 different 

countries.  

Until the end of 2010, the structure was quite stable since there was a shareholder 

agreement
29

 in place underlining that until the end of that year, none of the parts could sell its 

stake (lock-in-period) and consequently no significant changes would happen to the 

structure. After 1 January 2011, the parties became liberated to sell their shareholding what 

did not happened so far. 

3.1.3 The business segments 

The company?s activities can be summarized in three core business segments:  

Exploration and Production - E&amp;amp;P 

Refining &amp;amp; Marketing - R&amp;amp;M    

Power &amp;amp; Gas - P&amp;amp;G 

 

Since it became listed in 23
rd
 October 2006, Galp evolved from being essentially a domestic 

competitor with downstream activities
30

 in both gas and refining markets to having one of the 

most exciting upstream portfolios in the industry. 

In Table 3, a summary of the company?s current activities is presented.

3.1.4 The overall strategy  

According to the last Strategy update
34

, the company?s plan is to develop its potential as an 

integrated multi-energy operator. On one hand the aim is to capture value in the Refining &amp;amp; 

Marketing and Gas &amp;amp; Power business segments (downstream business) by vertical 

integration and, on the other hand, the purpose is to turn the company into an important 

upstream operator taking advantage of the portfolio of valuable E&amp;amp;P assets that the company 

owns, mainly in Angola and Brazil?s pre-salt Santos Basin.    

Until the end of 2011, the main focus will be on the R&amp;amp;M segment with the refinaries 

upgrade. From 2012, a more efficient downstream business will be in place and will serve as 

the funding source for the upstream development, which will absorb the biggest pie of the 

company investments and will be the main source of value for the future from that year on.  

In the medium and long term, the increasing production achieved will strengthen Galp?s 

position as an integrated oil &amp;amp; gas operator, promoting an increment in cash flows and 

turnning Brazil into the key focus of the company long term strategy. 

Appendix 6 exhibits a more detailed overview of the strategy splitted along the business 

areas and in Appendix 7, a summary of the company?s historical performance can be found. 

  

3.2 The oil &amp;amp; gas industry 

The petroleum is amongst the world?s primary sources of energy production. It assures the 

industrial maintenance and development and is used as an inimitable input in nearly every 

type of production that is made worldwide. As a consequence it?s in the world?s best interest 

to manage the industry sustanability and antecipate future challenges.  

The industry?s characteristics, recent performance and major threats are explored in 

Appendix 8, given the relatively lower importance of the themes. Nevertheless, the 

company?s main competitors are showed next.      

3.2.1 Major competitors 

As an integrated oil and gas operator, Galp is the monopolistic portuguese player. However, 

it?s often pressured by other integrated oil &amp;amp; gas companies in the international panorama

If we consider only integrated oil &amp;amp; gas, the competitive frame in the western Europe is 

essentially composed by the following companies:

Petrobras is also included in the group when the aim is to access the global integrated 

competitors. 

On the other side, the spectrum can even be more ample if we also consider companies with 

activities that are solely related to the downtream activities of the value chain. In this case, 

Galp also competes for sales with the following companies:

4. Macroeconomic environment 

According to IMF (2011a), the world is currently facing an intense deceleration and its 

recovery is at risk. The main reasons behind it are: on one hand, the Euro sovereign crisis 

caused by the elevated public debts, banking sector problems and a slow growth in the euro 

area and, on the other hand, the economic slowdown in the United States (due to the credit 

downgrade), the impact of the tragic March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan (which 

led to a broad-based decline in global manufacturing and exports growth across Asia), as 

well as the unstable situation in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region - Egipt, 

Tunisia, Libya, Iran and Bahrein -  and the related impact in oil prices. 

In this context, the investor?s risk aversion and the employments rate increased as well as 

the world?s financial instability, lowering the propension to consumption and turning the 

global activity severely unbalanced.  

The experts previsions have been revised downwards and the world real GDP growth is 

expected to be around 4% in 2011 and 2012 (IMF 2011). In Europe, the growth is expected 

to be lower i.e., 2,3% in 2011 and 1,8% in 2012 (IMF 2011). Nevertheless, since countries 

such as Germany and Sweden were barely affected by the turmoil, and others such as 

Ireland, Portugal, Greece and Italy were strongly influenced by it, their GDP growth rates will 

be quite differents. Furthermore, recently and due to the high pressures and abrupt cutbacks 

in external financing, Ireland, Greece, Portugal and recently Italy were obliged to ask for 

external financial assistance and are now embarked on an adjustment program supported by 

the EU and the IMF. 

In this context, the portuguese real GDP growth is forecasted to be -2,16 % in 2011 and –

1,84% in 2012 and just after 2013 is forecasted to be out of recession.

According to IMF (2011), the US and China will reemerge relatively quickly from the latest 

downturn; the Eurozone and possibly India will move at a slow pace and the economies of 

the former Soviet Union and Latin America (except Brazil) may not progress so quickly. 

In the major advanced economies such as the United States, euro area, and Japan, the 

growth is forecasted to rise modestly, from about 0,75% in the first half of 2011 to about 

1,5% in 2012, and even higher if the country is predicted to have close ties with emerging 

Asia.  

In emerging and developing economies, the overall economic climate may encourage a 

higher financial regulation with policymakers seeking to increase protectionism, reducing the 

allowed capital flows, augmenting the exchange rates, deteriorating terms of tradings and 

exports volume, promoting a reduction in foreign demand. This is expected to cut the growth 

in these economies from about 7% in the first half of 2011 to about 6 % in 2012 (IMF 2011a). 

Furthermore, as a consequence of the recent adverse supply shocks promoted by the 

political instability in the MENA countries, a rapidly fluctuating crude oil market is now on the 

spotlight, the oil prices have been reaching historical maximums and there is no expectation 

that they will be more moderate in the near future since the Iran?s petroleum sector is being 

hit with Western sanctions and the European Union is considering a possible embargo on 

Iranian oil imports suspecting the development of atomic weapons. If the situation 

deteriorates, the oil price
36

 will even exceed those currently predicted by futures markets and 

its volatility will influence the GDP growth (OPEC 2010).  

This instability in the oil prices is also reflected in the countries? inflation levels. Most analysts 

expect the high commodity prices to be temporary and therefore the world?s inflation
37

 is 

forecasted to be 2,5% in 2011 and 1,5% in 2012 in more advanced economies and, 7,5% in 

2011 and 6% in 2012 in developing countries (IMF 2011a). In Portugal, 2011 is expected to 

be the year with the higher inflation rate as seen in Figure 5.

Furthermore under such a global scenario, the uncertain growth performance in most 

industries will be evidenced. For multinational firms, as it is the case of oil &amp;amp; gas companies, 

the exchange rates can also be an important driver for results. The following graph presents 

the expected exchange rates USD/ Euro until 2012.

5. Valuation of Galp Energia S.G.P.S. 

5.1 The valuation methodology – “the break-up value
38

” 

Galp Energia is a multi-business company, in which each business segment is distinct in 

terms of features and value drivers. To avoid some potential misconceptions, my valuation 

approach was made through 4 main steps: 

1
st
 step: I valued each business segment – E&amp;amp;P, R&amp;amp;M and G&amp;amp;P – separately and as if they 

were exclusively financed by equity and then those valuation outputs were added up.  

2
nd 

step: The preceding result was adjusted to report the value of the non-operating assets 

and the company?s financing benefits - since the group also relies on external financing 

sources, such as banks - and by this manner, I?ve reached the Enterprise Value (EV).  

3
rd
 step: To achieve the Equity Value, all non equity claims such as the value of debt and 

minority interests were subtracted from the EV.  

4
th
 step: The equity value was divided by the number of shares outstanding and the value per 

share was encountered.

A more detailed valuation could have been accomplished, considering either the: company?s 

different geographic markets, the individual valuation of the group?s subsidiaries and 

associates or the supplementary undeveloped resources in the company?s portfolio, but the 

lack of information available, would require me to do entirely groundless and unrealistic

5.2 The valuation in practice 

5.2.1 General Assumptions 

5.2.1.1 Macroeconomic Variables 

Despite my attention on the global economic atmosphere and its upcoming future, I keept a 

special focus on the Portuguese and Spanish macroeconomic progress, since these 

countries are the main markets where the company operates in and they represent the 

largest source of the Galp?s profits.  

A special attention goes to the E&amp;amp;P activities which are often more dependent on the world 

economic context and on the oil price evolution, rather than on the financial situation of the 

countries where the natural resources are located in.     

As a result, I considered the following macroeconomic outlook, having the IMF as the primary 

data source: 

Table 8: Assumptions – GDP growth (%) and inflation rates (%)  

Data Source: IMF [Accessed on 21 December 2011] 

As I considered an explicit period of 37 years – 2011 to 2048 -, from 2017 on I assumed that 

the variables would remain in line with 2016 levels. 

Inserted in the oil &amp;amp; gas industry, the company negotiates the crude oil barrels in US dollars 

while the petroleum products derivatives are priced and sold according to local currencies - 

the Euro, in Galp?s case. For that reason, I had to account for the EUR/USD exchange rate 

evolution, mainly when accessing the value for the E&amp;amp;P segment.  

I considered that the exchange rate will be 1,42 in 2011 and 1,43 in 2012, according to 

Banco de Portugal estimates. From 2013 on, I assumed that it would be a value similar to 

2012.

Furthermore and as Galp is a commodity company producing and using crude oil and natural 

gas as an inputs in its business, the firm?s earnings and value are highly correlated to the 

price fluctuation of these commodities, which are given externally. Table 9 presents my 

assumptions.

5.2.1.2 Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) 

The investment policy is expected to enhance the portfolio of tangible - land and natural 

resources, machinery and transport equipment and reusable containers, for example - and 

intangible - as R&amp;amp;D Costs and services concession arrangements - fixed assets. 

From 2011 until 2015, the investment estimatives were made in line with the plan disclosed 

by the company.  

In 2011, Galp plans to spend 1400 million dollars of which 630 million in the R&amp;amp;M segment – 

with the completion of the upgrade?s project. From 2012 on, the bulk of capital expenditures 

will be redirected to the E&amp;amp;P segment, to the development of projects in the pre-salt Santos 

Basin. From 2012 to 2015, I assumed a total spending of 3500 million euros of which 70% 

where to the upstream activities.  

After 2016 and due to the fact that there is slight information about the costs that these kind 

of activities require, I assumed that: 

For the E&amp;amp;P Segment – the investments will be varying across the years. Assumptions were 

made considering the previous years? values released by the company but also the fields 

characteristics, the number of FPSO?s predicted to be installed, the forecasted inflation rate 

and expected timeframe for production.      

For the R&amp;amp;M and G&amp;amp;P Segments – the annual investments will increase from the 2015 level 

based on the estimated annual inflation rate and will work as a maintenance CAPEX.  

In addition and following the past years? results, a residual investment - reported in the 

caption Others - is estimated to be made every year to account for the intra-group?s 

operations. In 2011, the value followed the release of the company?s 9 months results. From 

2012 on, the projection was based on the historical trend adjusted for the inflation estimated.

5.2.1.3 Depreciation and Amortization (D&amp;amp;A) schedule     

In the company?s last annual report, I was able to identify the key components of its fixed 

assets, the respective updated values and their depreciation phases. As a result, for the 

existent fixed assets I was able to forecast with a reduced uncertainty, their D&amp;amp;A future 

schedule. 

In what concerns to the new investments projected to be made from 2011 on, I had to make 

some assumptions since the expected breakdown between tangible and intangible assests 

was not disclosed by the company.  

In this context and after trailling the historical trend, the projections were made considering 

an 89% investment in tangible assets and an 11% investment in intangible assets. As for the 

amortization rate, 5% was considered for the amortizable intangible assets and 4% for the 

tangible assets, i.e, 20 and 25 years of estimated usefull life.

5.2.1.4 Working Capital (WC) and Working Capital Needs (WCN) 

For valuation purposes, I used as a reference, the operating working capital which reflects  

the strictly operating current assets and liabilities, i.e., the accounts receivable, the 

inventories and the acounts payable. Additionally and based on historical facts, I accounted 

for a mininum cash level
40

, to more accurately reproduce the company?s operational 

efficiency and short-term financial health. In the subsequent table, the results of the 

company?s activity ratios achieved in the last years, are exhibited.  

Table 12: The Operational efficiency ratios 

Data source: Company?s historical data and analyst estimates 

After 2011, the indicated activity ratios and the cash conversion cycle are assumed to remain 

equal to the historical average as the company didn?t revealed further informations. 

Based on these, I also anticipated the company?s Operating Working Capital as well as its 

variation and considered the results evidenced in Table 13, as inputs to the DCF valuation 

methodology. For the subsequent years, the WC was similarly computed. 

Table 13: WC and WCN – Past results and future outlook

 The least amount of available cash that a company decides to maintain on a regular basis to avoid or cover up cash 
shortfalls resulting from a potential mismatch between cash inflows and outflows during an accounting period. In this case I 
considered to be the sum of cash, demand deposits and other negotiable securities included in the caption cash and 
equivalents. The remaining value is accounted as Excess Cash.

Since the valuation was made accessing each business segment individually, the working 

capital segmentation had to be made and without any kind of indicative elements I decided 

on doing it according to the sales volume. 

Table 14: Working capital needs – segmentation, 2009 – 2016 E 

Data source: Company?s historical data and analyst estimates 

As the sales from the R&amp;amp;M activities are higher than the bulk from the other segments, the 

WC for the segment?s maintenance is also expected to be higher and a major positive 

variation is denoted. For more information on the WCN segmentation, consult Appendix 14. 

When comparing with the activity ratios that serve as a reference for the global sector, and 

neglecting the inventories proportions, Galp appears to have below the average results, as 

can be seen in Appendix 15. 

5.2.1.5 The Capital Structure  

At the end of September 2011, the leverage analysis expressed mainly by the debt ratio and 

net-debt to equity ratios indicated that the businesses had too much risk.  

To manage this situation, the company announced that, in the first quarter of 2012  it will sell 

a 30% stake of its subsidiary – Petrogal Brasil, Lda to Sinopec, a chinese company and one 

of the largest energy groups worldwide, to raise around 3,77 billion €. Furthermore Sinopec 

will make a shareholder loan to Petrogal of nearly 306 million €. 

According to the same source, these new funding options will allow the group to achieve a 

net debt-to-equity inferior of 50% and net debt-to-EBITDA inferior to 2,5x. 

In this context, I forecasted the debt levels taking into account the previous information and 

also the company needs to meet the operational projections in the explicit period, as see in 

Table 15. In Appendix 16, I account for the remaining years.

Table 15: Financial situation, 2009 – 2016 E 

Data source: Company?s historical data and analyst estimates 

With regards to the debt ratio, I foresee an incremental decrease after 2012 due to the 

alternative cash coming from Petrogal?s raise in capital. For the same reason and assuming 

that the cash obtained will be received in parcels until 2016, the net debt-to-equity and net 

debt-to-EBITDA ratios will decrease mainly after 2012 converging to the anticipated intervals 

previously described. Until the end of the explicit period, the debt ratio is expected to be 

always inferior to 50%. 

5.2.1.6 The Cost of Equity 

Each segment was valued considering an individual risk performance in a debt free 

environment. As a consequence, the cost of capital, i.e., the discount rate used to come 

across the segments? values was the cost of equity, computed throught the CAPM. The table 

below outines the assumptions and final results. 

Table 16: Assumptions for the cost of equity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Data Source: Bloomberg (2011) 

 

The risk free rate 

Although it should be chosen to match the term of cash flows, I used the yield-to-maturity of 

a Germany?s 10-year government bond as the risk free rate, since 10 years is the average 

length of most investments in stocks.

The market risk premium 

To obtain a reasonable estimate of the market risk premium, I had to the account for the 

diversity of countries were Galp operates in, especially in the dowstream activities. 

For this purpose I calculated a specific equity premium by segment which was a result of the 

weighted average market risk premiums of all the countries where the segment?s sales were 

made.  

For the R&amp;amp;M segment, the market risk premiums of Iberian Peninsula, Africa, US, Mexico, 

UK, Netherlands, Greece and others were considered.  

For the G&amp;amp;P business, I followed the same reasoning but just considered the Portuguese 

and Spanish expected differential returns of the markets over the treasury bonds. 

For the E&amp;amp;P activities: in Angola, a country risk premium of 9,88% was considered, while in 

Brazil a risk of 7,63% was more accurate. 

The market premiums used were made available by Damodaran (2011a), although I am 

aware that due to the current economic climate, they may not be a good enough 

approximation of the reality. 

 

The beta coefficient 

In what concerns to the segments beta, the following approach was made: 

E&amp;amp;P segment: I resorted on Damodaran industry data base and composed a peer group
41

 

based on the companies? market capitalization, capital structures, projected growth and 

ROIC?s which allowed me to identify a group of companies that were relatively comparable to 

Galp. Based on this, I used the average levered beta of these companies and adjusted it for 

the company?s capital structure and the countries corporate tax rates, to reach a value for the 

segment?s unlevered beta. 

R&amp;amp;M segment: As the company until just recently was mainly focused on this kind of 

activities, I considered that Bloomberg?s beta estimative, based on past performance was 

realistic to account for the R&amp;amp;M business sensitivity to the market performance. 

G&amp;amp;P segment: I identified and analyzed a peer group
42

 based on capital strutures, and 

ROIC?s and considered their average beta as a good indicator for this segment after the 

adjustement for Galp?s capital structure.  

To deleverage the beta and assuming that the Beta of the debt is zero, I used the following 

formula:

The terminal growth rate 

For the E&amp;amp;P segment, the number of reserves and resources available to be developed and 

extracted are in a limited number. Therefore no growth rate at perpetuity was considered.  

Concerning the R&amp;amp;M business, I considered that the major investment plans were already 

accomplished. Moreover, the refining capacity is limited and the utilization rate can only 

increase slightly. A 1% growth rate was estimated to be reasonable to account for this 

doubtful growth at perpetuity since it?s the growth rate expected to be in place in the last 

years of the explicit period.   

The G&amp;amp;P segment serves as a complement to the refining and marketing activities and the 

company didn?t reveal any plans to future substancial investment. Nevertheless I considered 

a 1,2% growth rate since the Galp?s CEO announced that it was the expected growth rate for 

the industy sector after 2012. 

  

5.2.1.7 The Cost of Debt  

Following the methodology ascribed to Damoradan (2008), the before tax cost of debt of 

5,85% was reached considering the following assumptions:  

-  Risk free rate: 1,85% as similarly used when computing the cost of equity. 

- Default spread: 4%. On one hand, the historical trend highlighted an average spread of 

1,5% while, on the other hand and based on the synthetic rating calculation, the associated 

spread was 1,1%. However, in the last year and due to the economic recession the banks? 

risk perception has changed considerably and these values were not reflecting the reality. 

For this reason, and due to the lack of more information, I relied on the average spread 

achieved by EDP
43

 when, in January 2011, issued bonds. 

5.2.2 Valuation – E&amp;amp;P business 

Despite of the large portfolio of assets that the company owns for exploration and 

development, as already described in Figure 14 (Appendix 6), currently, the real production

of oil and natural gas to Galp Energia has its origin in Kuito, BBLT and CPT in Block 14 

(Angola) where the company has a 9% participation share and in the Lula field in Block BM-

S-11 (located in Santos Basin – Brazil), where a 10% stake is entitled to Galp. 

To access the value of the segment, I considered, besides the previous ones, the other E&amp;amp;P 

assets that are or have already been under the exploration phase and consequently are 

ready to be developed and productive. 

According to the disclosed information, the next in line to be under development are: 

? Cernambi, Iara and Jupiter in Block BM-S-11; Bem-te-vi in BM-S-8 and Caramba in 

BM-S-21 – located in Brazil. 

? Negage, Malange and Menongue in Block 14; Lianzi in Block 14K-A-IMI; Block 32 

and Block 33 – placed in Angola. 

Furthermore recently, the company announced the discovery of a new hydrocarbon province 

in Mozambique - Mamba South-1, in Area 4 - with at least 15 Tcf
44

 of recoverable natural 

gas. However, as residual information was released to the market, it was not considered for 

this valuation purpose. 

Pre-exploration reserves were also not valued as no informations concerning the reserves in 

place, the development costs and the required investments were availabe.  

 

Valuation techniques: 

Each Brazilian field was valued separately using the DCF methodology in order to get a 

suitable value per barrel. Since the company divulged the number of barrels that each field is 

expected to have, the total value of the reserve was encountered. 

The Angolan area was valued similarly but it was analyzed as a whole and not discriminated 

by field, as the company did not provide detailed information.  

Additionally and following Damodaran (2009), I?ve accessed the yet undeveloped fields using 

the Option Pricing Theory to pull out the extra value that comes from the options - such as to 

accelerate or postpone the development and extraction stage
45

 according to the economic 

perspectives at the time - that the field operator
46

 might have, since it?s a natural resource. 

For this matter, I had to account for the projects? main sources of uncertainty at this stage - 

the recovery rate and the development and extraction costs - which are highly correlated to 

the oil and gas prices volatility. In this case, and based on the information of future contracts, 

an implied volatility of 25,45% in oil prices and 16% in gas prices was assumed.   

                                                
44

 Trillion of cubic feet. According to the company website in 6 January 2012, 5610 cubic feet is equivalent to 1 Boe. 
45

 I treated development and extraction as one single phase due to the shortage of data available. Furthermore the 
abandonment option was not considered since these costs are hard to predict and very uncertain.  
46

 Galp is not the operator in any of those fields and consequently its influence regarding these managerial decisions its quite 
residual. Nevertheless the economic value of each field was accessed to account just for the part that is assigned to Galp.

Data source: Analyst estimates  

 

Segment’s assumptions: 

Since no more data was available I considered that the others reserves in Brazil would have 

a value per barrel equal to the average valuation of the other fields. The prospective 

resources would have a minimum value of 1$/barrel.

The projections of the segment?s annual sales per field were based on the mix of oil and gas 

production profile considered, and the oil and gas realization prices
47

. The production profile, 

by its turn, was a result of the analysis of the production report in the last 3 years as a 

complement to the industry historical prodution profiles in major oil fields. 

For the Brazilian fields the main costs considered were: an OPEX of 9,6 $ per barrel, 

according to the figures released by Petrobras; a 10% Royalties tax and a Special 

Participation Tax (SPT) that is owned by the leaseholder to the State and that oscillates 

according to the production volume in each year. 

For the Angolan fields, the scenario is a bit different. Instead of taxes, the company has to 

transfer part of its total production – called Working Interest Production (WIP) - to the State 

and it?s only able to sell the remaining, which is called the Net entitlement Production (NET). 

Historically the NET has been around 67% of the WIP and I maintained that ratio for the 

future to forecast the field? s production which will be sold. Furthermore an OPEX of 5,5 $ per 

barrel was considered. 

The D&amp;amp;A of the segment were allocated to each field in proportion of the CAPEX invested in 

it. 

In what concerns to corporate taxation, a tax rate of 34% and 28% were the assumptions for 

the Brazilian upstream assets and for the Angolan ones, respectively. 

The segment value is nearly 14,9 billion €. It worths 66% of EV, or in other words, 17,92€ per 

share. The segment?s EV is 79,9 times its 2010 EBITDA. 

    

The value drivers: 

The value of the segment is highly correlated to the cost of capital and the amount of 

reserves owned by the company. Any future discoveries on the amount of resources and 

reserves that are available to the company will positively update the actual E&amp;amp;P valuation 

and might also push the value per barrel of each field up. 

Nonetheless, the business it?s even more sensitive to changes in the Brent oil Price ($/bbl) 

and in the EUR/USD exchange rate. 

5.2.3 Valuation – R&amp;amp;M business 

Valuation technique: 

A DCF was the valuation methodology chosen and the segment was valued as a whole.

Segment assumptions and results: 

Table 19: R&amp;amp;M – Key assumptions  

Data source: Company?s historical data and analyst estimates 

In the last years, the international benchmark refining margins have been decreasing and as 

a result, the company?s refining margin has also been very low. Faced with the current 

economic climate, I assumed that for 2011, the refining margin would follow the trend of the 

results in the first three quarters of that year and that in 2012, it would rise to an average of 

1$ per barrel. Galp also released an information that from 2011 to 2015, an average 

benchmark margin of 1,62 $/bbl would be expected which I only assumed to happen from 

2013 on, to be more conservative.  

In what concerns to the company?s refining margin, a boost of 3,5 dollars per barrel is 

expected after the end of the refinaries? upgrade project. Furthermore and considering an 

average spread of 2,02 $/bbl and a cost of 2,1 $/bbl, Galp will be able to solidify the 

segments? gains. 

Additionally, the capacity utilization will increase until 2013 and then will decrease coming to 

a period where it will stabilize to a standard 75%, in line to what is hoped to happen in the 

industry. As a consequence, the processd crude and, as a result, the sales, are expected to 

augment in the first years of the projection and then will become quite constant. 

The processed crude is a product of the refining capacity and its actual utilization. The 

amount of sales is then a function of the processed crude and the company?s refining margin. 

In what respects the Marketing division, the increase in sales is positively correlated to the 

Iberian inflation rate and its costs are expected to be 97% of the sales, as the past years 

results have showed. As a result, the Marketing EBITDA as well as its weight on the 

segment?s result will lean on increasing year after year.

The segment value is nearly 4,7 billion euros and its terminal value just accouts for 9,5% of 

it. It worths 21% of EV, or in other words, 5,71€ per share.  

 

The value drivers: 

The key drivers that underpin this value are the company?s Refining Margin, the volume of 

processed crude and the segment?s discount rate.  

5.2.4 Valuation – G&amp;amp;P business 

Valuation technique: 

This segment core current activities were also approach as a whole and through a DCF 

methodology.  

 

Segment’s assumptions and results: 

Table 22: G&amp;amp;P – Operating highlights 

Data source: Company?s historical data and analyst estimates 

The segment?s sales of natural gas and electricity are expected to increase, mainly due to 

the higher production capacity that will be in-place from 2012 on, with a new cogeneration 

plant in Matosinhos. 

Due to the limited amount of information available, mainly in what concerns to unitary sales 

prices, I calculated the historical margins of the EBIT over the volume sold and presumed 

that it would remain equal for the years to come.

I also assumed that the storage and distribution assets add a constant yearly EBITDA 

contribution of 1,548 million euros to the segment as no more significant investments will be 

made.  

Table 23: G&amp;amp;P – NG regulated asset base (RAB) 

 

 

 

 

 

Data source: Company?s historical data and analyst estimate of EBITDA 

As no further investments are expected to be made, not much information was available to 

value other potential investments that the company has been showing interest to develop 

such as a wing power project, the construction of the 12MW Vale Grande wind farm and the 

Sines combined-cycle plant. Nevertheless, if they become viable and implemented, an 

additional capacity of 1012 MW will potential increase the eletricity production, the segments 

sales and the G&amp;amp;P segment?s value. 

Table 24: G&amp;amp;P – DCF valuation results 

Data source: Analyst estimates 

Currently, the segment?s value is still relatively residual, representing 7% of the total EV , i.e., 

2€ per share. The segment?s EV is just 6,3 times above its 2010 EBITDA. 

 

The value drivers: 

The value of these activities are very sensitive to a change in the volume of sales of natural 

gas and electricity, the growth assumed in perpetuity and the discount rate of the segment. 

Furthermore when the company update its investment plan and account for the wind projects 

and the CGCP, a boost in the G&amp;amp;P value will happen.

5.2.5 Valuation – Debt Tax shield  

Taking into account the company?s projected capital structure, clarified in section 5.2.1.5, the 

debt ratio is expected to be variable. 

As a consequence, I considered that the company?s forecasted tax savings should be 

discounted at the weighted average unlevered cost of equity of company?s business 

segments, in which the weightning factor was the CAPEX from 2011 to 2015. 

As the amount of debt is highly correlated to the firm?s investments and its capacity to 

generate operational cash flows, it should entail an equivalent risk. 

In Table 25, the main outcome is presented.

5.2.6 Valuation  – Sum-of-parts (SoP) 

After a SoP approach, the valuation of Galp Energia S.G.P.S. was complete and the folowing 

output was accomplished: 

Table 26: Galp Energia S.G.P.S. – SoP Valuation 

Data source: Analyst estimates 

The value per share that I reached in my SoP valuation in my base case was 14,76 € per 

share. Considering a -10% to + 20% interval range, the value might fluctuate between the 

13,28 and 17,71€ per share. This value represented a 16,1% premium to the market value of 

Galp on the 06th of January 2012. As the price target is above the current market price, my 

recommendation is to BUY. 

In Appendix 18, a brief overview of the company?s share performance in the last years can 

be seen. 

The E&amp;amp;P business segment is the center source of value for Galp, followed by the R&amp;amp;M 

business activity. The G&amp;amp;P segment entails a relatively low proportion of value to the 

company.

5.2.7 Sensitivity Analysis 

As previously I have identified the main value drivers for each segment, a sensitivity analysis 

is provided in this section. 

Focusing on potential changes in my base case E&amp;amp;P assumptions, it?s possible to verify that: 

If the volume of resources that the company holds for exploration increases, the value of the 

segment will also increase, as the expected share price (Table 27). 

 

 

 

 

The EV has an even higher relationship with the Brent oil price and the EUR/USD exchange 

rate.  

As the oil price raises, the company value will increase, implicity boosting the value of each 

stock. In the prices drops, the value will also diminish.  

 

 

 

 

In what concerns to the exchange rate, an negative correlation exists. A dollar devaluation 

causes a higher inflation and decreases the oil supply, the drilling activities, the oil demand 

and the purchasing power in the producing countries. As a result if the exchange rate goes 

up, the E&amp;amp;P will value less, decreasing the value per share. The inverse will occur as the 

exchange rate decreases. 

   

  

   

 

Furthermore as in the international markets occurs a simultaneous fluctuation in these two 

items, the follow values per share can be obtain:

As for the drivers of the R&amp;amp;M activities, the refining margin and the volume of proccessed 

crude are the center of attention for this sensitivity analysis. The next tables illustrates the 

effects on the company?s value per share, if the international benchmark refining margin
48

 

and volume output of crude processed - measured by the capacity utilization of the refinary - 

change. 

 

 

 

Table 32: Sensitivity analysis – change in refinaries’ capacity utilization 

 

 

As can be seen, the value of the company increases as the benchmark refining margin and 

crude processed output increases. 

 

In what concerns the G&amp;amp;P business, and assuming a constant capacity installed, the value is 

driven by the volume of sales sold. For that purpose, the next table presents a sum of 

indicatives values per share, as the volume of natural gas and electricity sales is adjusted.

Also and considering the intense link that any valuation results have with the discount rate 

used by the analyst, it?s important to reflect these changes as they are negatively correlated 

to the value of the segments and consequently the value per share. The table below shows 

the results obtained when I modify the cost of capital used in my base case.

5.3 Relative Valuation – an alternative approach 

As a complement to the previous valuation methodology, I decided to use the multiples 

approach as an attempt to better understand the company, its role amongst the industry 

players and the reasonableness of the break-up valuation. 

In this context, and with the support of Damodaran database
49

, I assembled a group of 

integrated oil &amp;amp; gas companies, that could potentially be comparables to Galp according to 

factors such as the size, forecasted growth rates, ROIC and capital structures. 

I fist had in mind to resctrict the group to the ones located in the Western Europe, due to the 

higher probability of resemblance in terms of modus operandi. Nevertheless, it was quite an 

unproductive job since none of them was truly similar to Galp Energia. 

For that reason, in a second phase, I searched for integrated petroleum companies that 

despite their location, could be more pure proxies to Galp and used them as the peer group. 

The next table compares the two groups just above described, with Galp. 

 

 

 

 

Data source: Damodaran database 

As it?s possible to verify, Galp has a much lower market capitalization and ROIC, a distict 

capital structure and higher growth perspectives when compared to most of the potential 

comparable firms from Western Europe and from this point of view, it?s entirely a distinct 

company.  

When compared to the peer group, it?s less atypical and so the multiples reasoning can be 

applied. The next table gathers the multiples from: Galp, the peer group and the industry 

average. Since companies such as Galp and the peer group emerge to be quite different 

from the bigger companies in the sector, I also present their multiples.

The major conclusion is that even when compared to the average multiples of identical 

companies, Galp trades at higher multiples. Although they are all integrated petroleum 

companies, their mix of businesses and specific characteristics are not similar among them 

and so the company?s multiples, should be adjusted to account for those differences.  

Due to the recent sharp increases in the oil price, the companies mostly involved in the 

exploration and drilling activities evidence higher EV?s and consequently higher implied 

multiples. This is the case of Galp, which was until recently mostly a dowstream player and 

has just emerged to be a promising player in the upstream activities, due to its exciting 

portfolio of E&amp;amp;P assets. As a result, the Galp?s implied multiples incorporate assets that do 

not yet produce operating income and the potential value from the E&amp;amp;P segment increased 

as well as the overall company EV.  

Furthermore, it?s not accurate to compare them with the companies that worth less, either 

because they have a potential lower value from E&amp;amp;P assets, or because there are more 

focused on other activities of the value chain.  

Nevertheless the valuation results using the multiples approach, more specifically 

EV/EBITDA and PER
50

, are presented next:

I can say that the previous valuation outputs indicate the minimum value that Galp would 

worth if it was similar to the peer group companies considered.  

The difference between the firms is again undeniable when, in Table 38, the implicit multiples 

obtained through my valuation approach are presented.

5.4  Financial Outlook – complementary remarks 

The financial estimatives for Galp Energia?s P&amp;amp;L, Cash Flow Statement and Balance Sheet 

are summarized in Appendix 20. 

Nevertheless, I would like to add the following comments: 

In terms of sales, and despite the fact that the ones from the E&amp;amp;P operations will increase 

substancially from 2011 on, the bulk is still expected to come from the refining and marketing 

activities. In Appendix 22, a table with the projected company sales by segment is offered. 

The amount of  costs in the income statement was calculated by segment and considering 

their historical percentage over sales.  

The company is expected to increase its EBITDA margin, ROS and ROE on a yearly basis 

mainly after 2011. The ROE is even expected to be higher than the required return to 

investors for at least a decade after 2012. 

Despite of the great amount of investments expected to be made, the firm will give back a 

higher return on capital invested (when compared to the past results) and is likely to be 

financially healthy with, a D/E ratio below 50% as exposed in section 5.2.1.5. and a solvency 

ratio below 30% (Appendix 21). 

Until the 2013, the company predicts to pay a 0,20€ dividend per share what corresponded 

to a dividend payout ratio of 38% in 2010. For the following years, I assumed a higher 

dividend payout ratio -  Galp will distribute 50% of the net income at replacement cost until 

2034 (in line with the dividend policy that was in place until 2009) and 80% of it after 2035.

Furthermore the half yearly interim dividends payment will occur and will be equal to 50% of 

the previous annual dividend. 

The agreement made with Sinopec to sell 30% of Petrogal, is expected to be finalized in the 

first months of 2012. For the dissertation purpose, I assumed that the cash balance will 

increase as well as the minority interests amount. As the operation is still on the run to be 

made, not much details were available and I was not able to consider a profit or loss that the 

transaction might entail, by comparing the selling price to the book value. 

Besides the macroeconomic, political, technological, fiscal and regulatory risks, the company 

has highly influent operational risks, such as: lower than expected commercially recoverable 

reserves, higher lifting and R&amp;amp;D costs, superior royalties or special participations taxes 

imposed to leaseholders by local governments.

6. Valuation Comparison – Caixa IB and Millennium IB 

In this section, I present the main findings that were achieved when I put side by side my 

valuation methodology and the ones used in recent equity researchs from Caixa BI and 

Millennium IB
51

. 

While Milllennium IB valued Galp at 18,15€ per share, Caixa IB settled the value of each 

stock to 18,7€. In comparison, my approach yielded the most conservative value, reaching a 

lower equity value and value per share (14,76€).  

The main cause was the adjustment that I?ve made to the EV considering a higher level of 

minority interests
52

 as a result of the Petrogal?s selling operation and which was not equally 

accounted by these analysts. Additionally, I considered a relatively higher level of debt and I 

did not account for a debt reduction since my assumption was that the cash-in obtained with 

this operation would be the financial support to Galp?s future investments. 

On the other side, while Millennium BCP did not account for any of these changes, the 

analyst from Caixa IB assumed that the monetization of these Brazilian assets would be 

used to reduce the current amount of debt outstanding.   

Table 39: Valuation output – own valuation, Caixa BI and Millennium IB 

 

Among all, the predominant valuation method was the DCF. Nevertheless the other analysts 

also used the multiples approach to value essentially the G&amp;amp;P business segment. 

                                                
51

 Although my purpose was to also examine a report from a foreign investment bank - BofA Merrill Lynch, that was not possible 
since insufficient information was disclosed by the analyst. 
52

 For this purpose, a sensitivity analysis on the value of minority interests is made in  
Appendix 19.

In what concerns to the cost of capital, different assumptions for the discount rate were 

made, as can be seen in the next table.  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The main discrepancy lies in the fact that Millennium IB and Caixa IB, have allocated the 

total amount of debt to each segment and subsegments valuing them at different WACC?s 

and considering different risk profiles, while I valued debt separately and the segments in a 

debt-free context. Their betas are generally superior as they account for the risk of leverage 

and a special attention also goes to their higher assumptions of the risk-free rate. 

Furthermore, Millennium IB offers the most exhaustive study and thoroughly accounts for 

individual discount rates considering segments and subsegments.  

 

In  this context, I will now highlight the main drivers that guided the overall valuation outputs 

in each business segment. I will just focus on the next five years to compare the results, 

since they carry the bulk of the most important assumptions.

For the E&amp;amp;P sector: 

? The analysts did not account for the options value in these kind of activities. 

? For the projections, Millennium IB assumed a constant oil price of 100$ per barrel, a 

gas price of 7,65$ per million of btu and an exchange rate of 1,40. Caixa IB relied on 

lower levels, i.e., a price per barrel of 85$, a gas price of 4,2$ per million of btu and 

an exchange rate of 1,34. My projections can be seen on Table 9.   

In this context, each field was valued individually and distinct NPV?s ($ per barrel) per field, 

were accomplished: 

 

? In what concerns to the CAPEX and production profile, Caixa IB did not disclosed the 

information of its assumptions. As a result I will just compare my projections to the 

ones from Millennium IB. 

 

For the R&amp;amp;M activities: 

There is not much relevant differences in what concerns to the assumptions for the company 

refining margin since all analysts position it in a similar interval range. When compare to 

Millennium, I assumed a lower cash cost per barrel. Adding to the comparatively regular 

assumptions for the processed crude, I ended up with higher level for the segment?s 

projected EBITDA. In what concerns to the segment?s investments, Millennium assumed a 

similar CAPEX effort, when compared with my own valuation. For CAIXA IB, this last data 

was not available.

Own Valuation Caixa IB  - 28 November 2011Millennium IB - 1 September 2011

 

For the G&amp;amp;P segment: 

It?s the segment with the less value, according to all the three analysts, and it revenues and 

EBITDA are expected to be maintained in relatively low levels.  

Millennium IB valued the natural gas related activities with DCF and RoRAB as I did in my 

own valuation, while Caixa IB valued it only with DCF?s. 

In what concerns with the electricity business, Caixa IB used the multiples approach, I valued 

it with DCF and Millennium IB valued in with multiples and DCF?s.  

Besides the G&amp;amp;P assets considered in my own valuation, Millennium also valued the wind 

and cogeneration assets through relative valuation and projected a negative NPV to the 

CCGT.   

The main output in seen in Table 44. I assumed that there will be heavier investments in the 

segment, when compared the other analysts. My revenues and EBITDA forecast are also 

slightly inferior. 

 

To sum up, I would like to say that despite the fact that each analyst have pursued different 

paths to account to the company?s value, the divergence between the final results has to do 

mainly with the different assumptions made by each one especially in what concerns the key 

value drivers. Otherwise the final value would be analogous.

7. Conclusion  

Valuing companies is a complex subject where is not possible to establish a unique path or 

methodology to execute it. Furthermore, each valuation output is simply a result of the 

analyst set of judgments on the company future expected development. 

In this dissertation, the value of Galp Energia S.G.P.S. was accessed through the Sum-of-

the-parts (SoP) methodology using mainly two valuation approaches -  the Discounted Cash 

flow method and the Black and Scholes model to value options.  

Moreover, the results were cross-checked with the average industry implied multiples to 

better understand the SoP results. The conclusion was that for Galp, fundamental DCF 

valuation is a much more powerful tool when compared to relative valuation. Due to the 

Galp?s characteristics and current market conditions, the company trades to a premium to the 

sector. 

The company?s current value driver is the E&amp;amp;P business with a promising exploration 

portfolio held in Angola and in Brazil (Santos Basin). Nevertheless, this segment is also the 

biggest source of uncertainty for the firm, since it?s highly sensitive to changes in the 

macroeconomic variables such as the Brent oil price and the euro/dollar exchange rate. 

The dowstream activities are projected to become a complement to the E&amp;amp;P activities, 

contrary to what have been happing so far. A special focus goes to the R&amp;amp;M business that is 

expected to become a cash cow and an important funding source to the upstream 

developments.  

The main issue to be followed in the near future is the partnership deal with Sinopec to sell 

30% of the company?s subsidiary, Petrogal Brazil. This operation will, on one hand, wipe out 

the company?s short term funding issues allowing it to grow in a more sustained way and, on 

the other hand, diminish the company?s value attributable to the equityholders.

The binomial option pricing model assumes that the stock price follows a random walk, i.e., 

in each step, it has a certain probability of moving up by a certain percentage amount (p) and 

a certain probability of moving down by a certain percentage amount (1-p) (Hull 2008).  

It?s a discrete time model and the following tree illustrates precisely all the possible future 

stock valuations and the associated probabilities.

In practice, we have to create a replicating portfolio using a combination of risk free 

borrowing/lending and the underlying asset to create the same cash flows as the option 

being valued (Damodaran 2002).  

The value of the option should equal to the value of the replicating portfolio. If the option 

value deviates from the value of the replicating portfolio, investors can create an arbitrage 

position. 

Appendix 3 – The Petroleum related activities 

Source: Adapted and translated from Mateus (2010, p.77) 

According to Wolf &amp;amp; Tordo (2009), the oil and gas industry involves a range of different 

activities and processes inherently linked with each other (conceptually, contractually and/or 

physically) which contribute to the transformation of petroleum resources into valuable 

products for industrial and private customers.  

These activities can be categorized into upstream, downstream or midstream operations. 

The petroleum value chain starts with the identification of suitable areas to conduct 

exploration for oil and/or gas. After that, there are three stages before hydrocarbons can be 

obtained above the ground: exploration, development and extraction (Paddock et al. 1988) – 

what are generally called Exploration and Production (E&amp;amp;P) or upstream activities. 

The exploration stage involves seismic and drilling activity to obtain information on the 

quantities of hydrocarbon reserves present in that tract, as well as the costs of bringing them 

out. Only if the exploration results are favorable, the firm may then proceed to the 

development stage, which involves putting the equipment in place to extract the oil, such as: 

constructing platforms and drilling production wells. These development expenditures 

convert undeveloped reserves into developed reserves and prepare for the extraction phase 

where barrels of oil and gas equivalent are produced.   

In a next phase, the barrels are transported through infrastructures such pipelines, access to 

roads, rails and ports and storaged to be refined into usable products such as gasoline and 

diesel. Then they are distributed onwards to wholesale, retail or direct industrial clients – 

Figure 10: The petroleum value chain

through what is known as Refining and Marketing (R&amp;amp;M) or downstream activities (Wolf &amp;amp; 

Tordo 2009).  

The same authors note that the transport and storage operations have a massive weight 

within the value chain linking production, processing facilities and the final customer. For that 

reason, they refer that these activities could be distinguished as the midstream part of the 

value chain, in spite of being usually included in the downstream point of view. For this 

dissertation purpose, the downstream operations include these midstream activities. 

A final remark goes to the fact that the upstream activities entail higher investments that can 

be offset with the possibility of achieving higher profits while in the downstream activities the 

risk is relatively low and there is a possibility of moderate earnings despite the colateral 

losses from the fluctuant benchmark refining margins in international markets.   

 

Geographically speaking, Galp Energia has a strong presence in almost all the world: 

The E&amp;amp;P activities are placed predominantly in Brazil, Angola, Mozambique Venezuela and 

Uruguay. 

The R&amp;amp;M operations are located mostly in Portugal and Spain, although some clients are 

placed in Africa and North America. 

The G&amp;amp;P segment is mainly associated with Nigeria and Angelia, in the North of Africa, since 

these are the main suppliers of natural gas. In the beginning of 2009, a LNG project in 

Equatorial Guinea started being designed.

Appendix 5: Galp’s base of resources &amp;amp; the petroleum classification system 

The current resource base 

According to the company, the intense exploration work that has been developed in the 

recent years, particularly in the Brazilian Santos basin, led to an considerable enlargement of 

Galp?s base of resources and reserves.  

Presently the company publicizes that nearly 2,4 billion of barrels of oil and natural gas can 

be encountered in its porfolio. Furthermore, if we also account for the prospective resources, 

the 2P reserves in Angola and the 3P reserves in Brazil, the total resource base is estimeted 

to be around 5,88 billion boe, which considering a production level of 200 thousand boe per 

day is equivalent to around 80 years of production. In Figure 12, it?s possible to see the 

evolution of the company?s resource base along the years.

The petroleum classification system  

According to the definitions approved by the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) and by 

the World Petroleum Council (WPC), the total petroleum (which includes crude oil, 

condensates, natural gas and related substances) dispersed around the globe can be 

classified as Reserves - Proved (1P), Probable (2P) and Possible (3P) - or as potentially 

recoverable hydrocarbon volumes beyond Reserves, which are known as Resources – 

Prospective or Contingent. 

In theory, each quantity of petroleum starts as being a Prospective Resources. Dependent of 

the company disclosures along the time, these Prospective Resources are likely then, to be 

classified in Contingent Resources and later in Probable and Proved Reserves.

To better understand Figure 13 and according to the SPE, the WPC and the company 

website: 

Prospective resources are quantities of petroleum that have, on a certain date, been 

estimated as potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application of 

future development projects. The estimation of the resources quantities of a prospect is 

subject to both technical and commercial uncertainties.  

Contingent resources consign quantities of petroleum that have, on a certain date, been 

estimated as potentially recoverable from known reservoirs but that are not commercially 

recoverable yet. The maturity stage of the project (the discovery needs further appraisals to 

support for the development plan), technical issues (new technology needs to be developed 

and tested) or issues related with the market (the sales contracts are not yet in place or the 

infrastructure needs to be built in order to take the product to the clients) appear as reasons 

for this classification. 

When the previous phases have been overcome and there is already a development plan in 

place, the discovered petroleum is renamed to fit in one of the following three categories:  

Proved, Probable and Possible reserves (3P) are a category of unproved reserves and 

correspond to the addition of proved, probable and possible reserves.  

These reserves are based on geological or engineering data similar to those used in the 

calculation of proved reserves but entail technical, contractual, economic or regulatory 

uncertainties and therefore are not classified as proven. The possible reserves have lower 

probability of being recovered than the 2P reserves. If probabilistic methods are used, there 

should be at least a 10% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or 

exceed the 3P estimate. 

Figure 13: Petroleum classification system

Cátia Ferreira                                                                                                                                                         71 

 

Proved and Probable reserves (2P) are also a category of unproved reserves and 

correspond to the sum of proved and probable reserves. These reserves are based on 

geological or engineering data similar to those used in the calculation of proved reserves but 

also entail technical, contractual, economic or regulatory uncertainties and therefore are 

disqualified from becoming categorized as proved. When compared with the 1P reserves, 

these have a lower probability of being recovered, but higher if compared with the 3P 

reserves. The probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50% probability that 

the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the 2P estimate. 

Proved reserves (1P) are those quantities of petroleum which, by analysis of geological and 

engineering data can, with reasonable certainty and under current economic conditions 

(include relevant petroleum prices and associated costs), operational methods and 

government regulations, be estimated to be commercially recoverable, from a certain data 

onwards from known reservoirs. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be a  

minimum 90% probability that actual recovered quantities will equal or exceed the 

estimatives. 

Appendix 6: Galp Energia –  characteristics and strategy by segment 

E&amp;amp;P 

The company aspires to develop its current resources in order to increase future oil and gas 

production. The present goal is to reach to a production of 200 thousands boe/d in 2020 and 

300 thousands boe/d in the early 2020's.  

To achieve this production, Galp is focused on its major E&amp;amp;P assets, located in Angola and 

in Brazil?s pre-salt Santos basin where the scale of reserves and the recent discoveries have 

positioned it among the restricted group of operators with highly successful exploration 

programmes. For the company, the participations in the Brazilian exploration fields represent 

more than 90% of the total reserves and contingent resources, from where the company can 

extract petroleum and natural gas. Furthermore, after 2012 the focus of the company?s 

capital investments will move from the R&amp;amp;M segment to the development of these projects. 

Despite the large assets portfolio as seen in Figure 14, the projects which are the current 

source production of oil and natural gas to Galp are located in Angola?s Block 14 and at 

the Lula field, in the Block BM-S-11, in Brazil, whose production started in October 2010.  

In the future, Galp?s activities, will be focused on the development and the appraisal of other 

estimated resources in the pre-salt of the Santos basin such as blocks BM-S-8, BM-S-11, 

BM-S-21 and BM-S-24. The Lula field, included in the Block BM-S-11 has already undergone 

through an EWT and 8,3 billion recoverable barrels of oil and natural gas were indicated to 

exist.

R&amp;amp;M 

The segment integrates two separated but correlated set of activities: the refining process 

and the distribution of the refined products to the market.  

The company imports the crude oil from numerous suppliers in circa 16 countries
53

 and refine 

it to obtain a broad range of products, such as gasoline, diesel and middle distillates.    

Galp Energia owns the only two refinaries in Portugal which presently have a joint capacity of 

310,000 barrels of oil per day, equivalent to 20% of the Iberian Peninsula?s total refining 

capacity. After the conversion project scheduled to be completed in the months of 2012, the 

distillation capacity will raise by 20,000 barrels of oil per day. Additionally it will promote a 

reduction in imports, an adjustment in the production profile (to meet the needs of the Iberian 

market, where diesel is currently in short supply) and an upgrade in the heavy crude oil
54

 

processing (expected to top 70% of total crude processed), since it?s available on the market 

at lower prices what allows a reduction in the raw material costs. As a consequence, the 

refinaries? upgrade will augment the refining margins and maximize the cash flows.  

In Figures 15 and 16, the production profile and the types of crude oil that were processed in 

2010 are presented.

Once the crude oil is processed, the refined products are marketed mainly in Portugal and 

Spain – 80% under Galp?s brand. The company commands a 14% market share in the 

Iberian market, where Spain accounts for 44% of sales and the wholesale segment accounts 

for the biggest proportion of volumes sold. Nonetheless a few sales are made to Africa and 

some production is exported to European and North American countries. Galp?s position in 

the Iberian Peninsula was consolidated by the acquisition of Agip?s and Exxon Mobil?s 

operations, in 2008. 

                                                        

G&amp;amp;P 

This segment clusters Galp Energia?s procurement, distribution and marketing of natural gas 

as well as its electrical and thermal power generation activities.  

 

Natural Gas 

The company purchases natural gas in Nigeria and Argelia and then, storages, distributes 

and sells it in the Iberian Peninsula where it currently holds a 15% market share
55

, partly due 

to the growing importance of the Spanish market recently consolidated with the acquisition, 

in 2010, of the Madrileña Suministro de Gas SUR and Madrileña Suministro de Gas. The 

company expects to be less dependend on these sources, throught the future development 

of its  projects in Angola and in Brazil Santos Basin.  

In Portugal, the natural gas sector comprises a set of regulated and unregulated activities, 

ranging from unregulated procurement and mixed (regulated and unregulated) marketing to 

fully regulated infrastructure. Galp Energia is actively present in all stages except in the 

regasification and high-pressure transportation of liquefied natural gas as seen in Figure 17.

In what concerns to distribution – a regulated activity - in Portugal, the natural gas is 

distributed by six companies and five of them are Galp Energia subsidiaries operating 

through the so-called „autonomous distribution units?.  

Regarding the underground storage of natural gas – also a regulated activity -  the company 

was awarded with a 40-year period up to 2046. Its regulatory asset base (RAB) is currently 

valued at €18 million and the rate of return has been set by ERSE
56

 to be 9% (until June 

2013). Furthermore, a combined storage capacity of close to 118 million cubic metres, is 

scheduled to come into operation in 2016 and 2019 augmenting the company relevant 

weight on the strategic quantity needed for the country and allowing it to exploit some trading 

opportunities. 

In Figures 18 and 19 we can find the breakdown by country and by sector respectively, of the 

volumes of natural gas sold in 2010.

Power 

It?s currently working as a complement to the natural gas set of activities, to allow a dual 

offering predominantly to the domestic customers. Nevertheless, the company aims to 

develop a competitive energy generation portfolio with cogeneration plants, wind power and 

a joint offering of electricity and natural gas, optimizing the margins in this business segment.  

Galp already comprises a cogeneration plant, in Sines, with an installed capacity of 160MW. 

Moreover: i) another cogeneration plant in Matosinhos
57

 with a total production capacity of 

80MW is under construction; ii) the company partly owns three cogeneration plants - Carriço, 

Powercer and Energin - with a joint capacity of 80MW; iii) the construction of an alternative 

power generation system - a combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plant in Sines – is being 

analysed until the end of 2011; iv) a wind power project, which has a 200MW installed 

capacity is expected to be in place by 2013; v) Galp anticipates the construction of the 12MW 

Vale Grande wind farm to be initiated in the fourth quarter of 2010 and completed in 2011. 

Appendix 7: Galp Energia – historical financial performance 

From 2005 to 2010, the group?s sales &amp;amp; services grew significantly. The only exception in 

2009 where there was nearly a 21% reduction in the sales and services RCA
58

 in all 

segments, mainly due to the intensive decline in the oil prices and in the refining margins, a 

smaller volume of natural gas sales and a controversial economic context. 

                                                

57
 Expected to come into operations by the end of 2011, it will result in a total increase in consumption of 500 million cubic 

meters of natural gas each year, integrating further the natural gas and power businesses.

 Replacement Cost Adjusted -  although not accepted by the IFRS, it adjusts the results in order to smooth the inventory effect 
and exclude non-recurrent events. Within the IFRS accounting method, the cost of goods sold is valued at weighted average 
cost (WAC) what can lead to a volatility in results due to the fact that commodities and good prices fluctuate intensively – also 
called the inventory effect.  By RCA method, the costs of goods is valued at replacement cost, i.e., the average cost of raw 
materials in the month when the sales were realized and unrelated to the inventories held at the start or the end of the period.

In 2010, the company was able to partially recover and sales &amp;amp; services increased by 17%. 

The higher bulk came from the R&amp;amp;M segment following the historical trend but the 

contribution of the G&amp;amp;P and E&amp;amp;P segments to this result grew to 13,1% and 1,5% 

respectively, when compared to the previous year.  

Just in the first 9 months of 2011, the amount of sales was 12.429 million euros what 

corresponded to 88% of the 2010 result. Additionally it?s possible to foresee that the E&amp;amp;P 

business area is increasing its share in sales, what comes in line with the company strategy 

analyzed previously.   

Table 45: Historical analysis – Sales &amp;amp; Services 

Source: Company?s annual reports 

Focusing largely on the last year and on the primary data of this year?s first three quarters, 

it?s possible to affim that, according to Table 46, Galp has been improving its operating 

performance, by presenting, in 2010, a 27% increase in the EBITDA (RCA) and a 58% 

augment in the EBIT (RCA).  

Figure 20 illustrates each segment contribution to the EBIT result and it?s possible to 

conclude that the R&amp;amp;M activities have been an important segment to the company?s 

sustainability. Nevertheless, if we compare 2010 and the 2011 primary results, we can 

antecipate on one hand, a decrease in the contribution of the R&amp;amp;M segment, and on the 

other hand, an increase in the input from the E&amp;amp;P and G&amp;amp;P segments.

The financial information also reveals that, despite the noteworthy decrease in 2009, the 

company?s annual profit has always been positive and taking into account the adjusted 

results, it raised by 44% in 2010. In the premature results of 2011, the adjusted net profit was 

close to 56% of the 2010 full year results. 

Until 2009, the earnings per share have decreased along the years but in 2010, they raised 

by 26% to a value of 0,53 euros per share. Yet, the dividend payout ratio has been always 

superior to 50%, with the exception of 2010.  

In the last four years, the EBITDA margin has been below 10%, when compared to 2005 and 

2006 what indicates a less operating profitability, i.e., higher operating costs. Nevertheless, 

in 2010 it increased 0,6% reaching a value of 7,5%. This also promoted the lower ratio of 

return on sales (ROS) which indicates that a relatively low amount of sales is actually being 

transformed in net profit. 

In what concerns to the capital expenditures, with the exception of 2009, the amount applied 

has been increasing year by year. In 2010 it expanded 68,9%, with the higher share being 

invested in the R&amp;amp;M segment. Nevertheless, the investment rate in E&amp;amp;P also increased while 

the one in G&amp;amp;P activities decreased as can be see in Table 47.

In addition, Table 48 evidences that in the last two years, as in so far this year,  around 70% 

of the company assets are being finance by debt and the other 30% are being sponsored by 

equity.  

The net debt to equity ratio increased on a yearly basis, reaching 105% in 2010, and 

indicated a high risk due to a soaring net debt. In September 2011 this ratio was 114%.  

Table 48: Historical analysis – Financial structure 

Data source: Company?s annual reports 

Appendix 8: Oil and Gas industry – Main characteristics, historical facts and 

challenges 

Core characteristics and historical facts: 

The petroleum industry is characterized by high entrance costs and consequently, the 

number of important competitors is significantly narrower when compared to other industries. 

Furthemore, Wolf &amp;amp; Tordo (2009) observe that the players are usually organized to benefit 

from vertical and horizontal integration.  

With regards to the horizontal concentration, the goal is to benefit from economies of scale in 

order to: easily access better funding, diversify investment and development risk, and to 

serve as long-term insurance to partners such as host governments.  

Within the vertical integration, some of the gains are: to secure sources of supply, to facilitate 

logistical operations, to create entry barriers, to circumvent taxes, to eliminate profit margins 

of intermediaries or to practice price discrimination. 

It?s a very complex industry, highly capital intensive, has long lead times and it?s inherently 

risky (Stevens 2005).  

Nevertheless it thrives since the energy demand continues to increase even in the less 

propitious economic cycles, due to the fact that economies expand, the global population 

grows and living conditions across the world improve (OPEC 2010). 

According to Figure 21, the crude oil has been the most consumed type of energy until now 

and consequently, the more sought. In 2010, the global energy consumption strongly 

recovered, growing at an above-average rate 5.6% which was the highest rate since 1973, 

with a big contribution of non OECD countries (BP 2011a).

The biggest pie of the world oil reserves are concentrated in a relatively low amount of 

countries and companies, as seen in Figures 22 and 23Figure 22. Nonetheless the oil 

consumption has been global, with a focus in America and Europe as evidenced in  Figure 

24. The transportation sector has been that one that absorbes most of the oil demand.

In terms of earnings, the latest published data by API (2011), explains that the oil and gas 

industry is characterized by relatively high earnings. In the second quarter of 2011, this 

industry earned in average, 9,5 cents per every dollar of sales achieved. This value has been 

increasing over the last quarters – in the period 2006 to 2010 it was just 6,7 cents - and in 

the last few months, the oil &amp;amp; gas industry was positioned among the top ten higher earnings 

industries as can be seen in Figure 26.

Industry trends and challenges: 

According to Al-Zayer (2007), these are some of the major threats to the sector: 

There are geographic challenges such as the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico, the frigid 

regions of Russia or the hot, dusty, undeveloped deserts of the Middle East that can affect 

the field?s recovery rate and prodution accomplished. 

Global geopolitical forces are creating highly volatile markets and unreasonable swings in the 

crude oil price.  

The sector is currently characterized by a labor shortage, what is reflected in the increasing 

wages. In the words of IMF (2011), 50% of the industry?s current skilled workforce will be 

retired within the next ten years and the recruitment and training activities of new engineers, 

geologists, technicians and managers activities have been relatively insufficient. 

The firm?s overall costs have been increasing year over year. The expenditures in the drilling 

activities largely contribute to this, in addition to the growing personnel costs. 

The global competition brings out the importance of lowering these operating costs more 

than increasing oil production.

The companies must incessantly seek to develop innovative technologies, in order to 

enhance the field?s exploration success rates, reduce the CO2 carbon emissions,  minimize 

the time intervals needed, avoid the wasteful use of energetic resources and improve the fuel 

efficiency.  

Shareholders are pressuring companies for a rapid return on their investments affecting the 

firm?s reinvestment rithm and their margin to implement large size projects. 

The concern with the environment poses relevant issues and pressures the future path of the 

companies? strategy. There are projects on the run that aim to: prevent oil spills and reduce 

gas flaring, minimize the global warming effect, develop carbon capture and storage (CCS) 

tecnhnologies, make use of fossil fuels more environmentally friendly or even promote the 

reduction of these fuels consumption. Moreover there is a growing presence of energy and 

climate change legislation that might raise refiners? costs, as well as further limit crude-

derived products demand.  

Uncertainties from the demand became an adverse reality since mixed signals are being 

sent to the market. If by one side there is an expectation that the supply will need to increase 

in order to cover the growth in the world economy, on the other side, many countries are 

actively engaged in moving away from fossil fuels.  

Since these facts are directly reflected in the company?s investment decisions, the same 

experts recommend that innovative schemes involving all stakeholders should be 

implemented. Furthermore, to reduce the amount of uncertainty that this produces, 

transparency, dialogue, partnership and a productive cooperation between players should be 

efficiently structured in order to minimize losses in times of high and low prices.

Although some regions of the world may be cutting back on their energy consumption, the oil 

and gas demand will still be largely stimulated as a result of the increase in living standards, 

industrialization and other socio economic factors.  

According to OPEC (2010), by 2030, the world energy demand will have increased by more 

than 40% when compared to today?s levels, and the developing countries or rapidly-growing 

non-OECD
59

 economies will be responsible for the most part in this growth, as evidenced in 

Figures 29 and 30.

In what concerns to the global energy consumption, BP (2011) refers that the world primary 

energy consumption which grew 45% in the last 20 years, will grow by 39% over the next 20 

years (1,7% per year), with a gentle deceleration beyond 2020. 

By 2030, non-OECD energy consumption (in countries like China or Asia) will be 68% higher 

(yearly growth of 2,6%) and will account for 93% of the global energy growth. The OECD
60

 

economies foresee just a 6% growth, and from 2020 on, their energy consumption per capita 

will face a declining trend by over 4 million barrels per day
61

. 

While in developing countries, the energy consumption growth will be driven by power 

generation and industrial activities, in the OECD members the decline will be highly corrected 

to the softening growth of consumption by the transportation sector. 

Considering the supply side, in the short term, the growth is likely to come from non-OPEC 

countries, but OPEC will be responsible for an increasing share of global oil supplies in the 

long term (OPEC 2010). 

Moreover, among the energy sources globally available – coal, crude oil, gas and wind for 

example - by 2030, fossil fuels are expected to still make up to 68% until 2030 (from 83% in 

1990 to 2010) of the energy mix around the globe (BP 2011).

 Their demand has peaked in 2005 according to BP (2011).                                                                            
61

 Which contrasts to what has been happening so far where the industrialized countries led in energy consumption.

Even so, BP (2011) refers that the fuel mix changes relatively slowly and that gas and non-

fossil fuels will gain share at the expense of coal and oil. Furthermore, the fastest growing 

fuels will be renewables (including biofuels) which are expected to grow at 8.2% per year 

until 2030 and among the fossil fuels, gas will be the fastest growing energy source (2,1% 

annual growth).  

In this context, the refining sector is also under pressure to pressure to supply lighter and 

cleaner products, i.e., mainly middle distillates such as diesel fuel. In the short-medium-long 

term the companies might have to deal with a contrasting demand evolution across regions 

and a severe overcapacity in the refineries. By 2015, the utilization capacity is expected to 

be, on average only 75% (OPEC 2010).

Data Source: Damodaran (2011), for the industry sector and own analysis for the company data. 

All the company?s ratios outputs are below the industry average. The sales by credit are 

within an inferior number, the stock over sales amount sustained is superior and the 

unpaid suppliers' bills over the amount of revenues is minor when compared to the industry 

what can mean better liquidity.  

Nevertheless, what is more evident is the Galp?s substancially inferior cash to sales ratio, 

what indicates a better effectiviness of its collection and credit policies meaning that the 

company requires less cash to deal with unexpected cash collection delays, when compared 

to the other companies in the industry.

Appendix 18: The company’s stock performance – a brief overview 

As a public company, Galp?s stocks are traded in several indexes worldwide, beside the PSI 

20. Some examples are: the Bloomberg European 500, the BE500 Energy, the Euronext Top 

100 or the WT INTL Energy IIV.  

The graph presented below points up the stock price evolution.

Subsequent to the IPO in 2006, the price per share followed a trend to increase. 

Furthermore, in the beginning of 2008, the stock price reached its maximum as Galp entered 

the eletricity business and descovered new amounts of oil in the Pre-Salt Santos Basin.  

Then it went through a bearish period and dropped to a minimum of 6,13€, which occurred in 

October 2008. Over the recent years, the price has been reaching higher levels, mainly as 

new progresses in the E&amp;amp;P activities are being announced.  

During 2011, the company?s stock was trading at relatively high values, closer to the ones 

practiced in the first months of 2008. 

After the second trimester of 2011, the stock price showed a tendency to decline. 

Nevertheless, the major fall was when the company announced its partnership with Sinopec 

to sell 30% of Petrogal, which was unitl then, totally owned by Galp.  

Additionally and facing the current portuguese economic climate, regular swings have been 

detected and until now it has been hard for the invertors to invert this situation and offer a 

higher price per share. 

Even so, the company has been performing extraordinarily well when compared to the PSI 

20 Index or the DJS Oil&amp;amp;Gas Index, or even when compared with companies that are 

similarly in terms of industry, to Galp, such as, BP or Petrobras, as evidenced next.

As expected, a change in minority interests, will adjust the value each share outstanding.
