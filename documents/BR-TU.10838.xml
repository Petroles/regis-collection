ABSTRACT 
 
The objective of this study was to assess the physical attributes of a kaolinitic oxisol, medium texture (Haplustox) 
and an oxidic oxisol, clayey (Eutrustox) under different usage systems, localized in the region of Jaboticabal, SP, 
Brazil. The usage systems were sugarcane, cotton and forest. Parameters such as soil bulk density, total porosity, 
macro and microporosity at the depths of 0.0-0.1; 0.1-0.2; 0.2-0.3, and 0.3-0.4 m were evaluated. Haplustox showed 
greater bulk density and smaller total porosity, macro and microporosity. The usage increased the bulk density in 
0.0-0.3 m depth, with greater effects on the kaolinitic oxisol, mainly in 0.1 -0.2 m depth in the areas cultivated with 
sugarcane.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Soils have structural differences that originated 
from pedogenesis. Soils have different 
granulometric, mineralogic and organic matter 
compositions that can be modified by the usage 
and tillage of those soils. Ferreira et al. (1999a, 
1999b) found that oxisols with kaolinitic clay 
fractions led to the development of a block-type 
macrostructure that caused the formation of 
oxisols with greater bulk densities and greater 
proportion of small pores. They also reported that 
oxisols with oxidic mineralogy formed porous- 
structures with lower bulk densities due to larger 
diameter pore spaces. Moreover, Chagas et al. 
(1997) reported that soil with a higher content of 
kaolinite in the clay fraction had a greater bulk 
density, lower total porosity and macroporosity 
when compared to other oxidic soils.  

Excessive soil preparation, removal of growing 
plants from the surface and the establishment of 
annual crops combined with inappropriate tillage 
practices cause a disturbance in the balance 
between the soil and environment, by modifying 
its physical, chemical and biological attributes; by 
limiting its agricultural usage, and by making it 
more susceptible to erosion and degradation. 
There are several studies on the effects of different 
usage and tillage systems on the physical 
properties of soils. Overall, data show an increase 
in soil bulk density and a decrease in porosity 
when soils are submitted to different usage 
systems when compared to its natural state (Hill   
et al., 1985; Cavenage et al., 1999; Beutler et al., 
2001). Carvalho et al. (1991) evaluated the effect 
of many years of conventional cultivation with 
sugarcane and observed that soils with longer 
cultivation times had a decrease in the porosity 
especially in the macroporosity. Cerri et al. (1991)

reported that intensive cultivation of the soil with 
sugarcane had structural changes, mainly in the 
soil surface layers. Later studies conducted by 
Carvalho (1999) showed that conventional tillage 
systems followed by maize and sugarcane 
cultivation caused degradation of the physical 
attributes of the soil when compared to the natural 
state. This degradation was quantified through 
greater values of bulk density and microporosity, 
and lower values for macroporosity and total 
porosity.  
The decrease of total porosity and macroporosity, 
with an increase in microporosity and soil bulk 
density in areas cultivated with annual crops, was 
mainly due to the intensive soil mixing during the 

preparation activities (Silva et al., 1986). Data 
collected by Machado et al. (1981) showed that the 
changes in the physical attributes of the oxisol soil 
cultivated with conventional tillage were also 
associated with decrease in organic matter content 
when compared to the natural state of the soil. 
Even though Brazilian soils are mainly oxisols and 
are widely used for agriculture, little is known 
about the differences on the physical attributes 
between kaolinitic and oxidic oxisols soils under 
different usage systems. Therefore, the objective 
of this study was to evaluate the physical attributes 
of kaolinitic oxisol (Haplustox) and oxidic oxisol 
(Eutrustox) under different usage systems.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
The experiment was carried out in a kaolinitic oxisol, 
medium texture (Haplustox), and in oxidic oxisol, 
clayey (Eutrustox). Geographic co-ordinates of the 
experimental area were south latitude 21º08’27” and 

west longitude 48º16’17”, located in Jaboticabal, São 
Paulo state, Brazil. The weather is classified as 
mesothermic with dry winters (Cwa) by the Köppen 
system. The physical and chemical characterizations of 
the soils are shown in Table 1.

Usage systems were sugarcane (5th year), cotton 
(1th year) and forest. In the area cultivated with 
sugarcane for 30 years, practices such as 
conventional tillage using discs plow, harrow and 
chisel plow and burning were performed before 
cutting. The area cultivated with cotton was 
prepared by using discs plow, harrow and four 
leveler harrowings, and had been cultivated for 30 
years with annual crops. 
Disturbed and undisturbed samples were collected 
at 0.0-0.1; 0.1-0.2; 0.2-0.3, and 0.3-0.4 m depths. 
The undisturbed samples collected with volumetric 
rings of 0.048 diameter and 0.03 m high were used 
to determine the following: bulk density according 
to Blake and Hartge (1986); microporosity by 
drying (0.006 MPa) in a Richard pressure 
chambers with porous plate (Klute, 1986), and 
total porosity according to Danielson and 
Sutherland (1986). The macroporosity was 
obtained by the difference between total porosity 
and microporosity. 
Particle size composition was established in 
disturbed samples through dispersion with water 
and NaOH (0.1 mol L-1) and slow shaking for 16 
hours, and the clay portion was determined by 
pipetting method according to Day (1965). 
Organic matter was determined by the method 
described by Raij et al. (1987). Fe2O3 and Al2O3 
were determined through sulfuric agents according 
to Lim and Jackson (1986). 
Experimental design was entirely randomized with 
subdivided parcels, with seven replications each. 
The effects of the usage systems on the soils 
physical attributes at different depths were verified 
by the variance analysis and significant means 
were compared by Tukey test at the 0.05 
probability level. 
 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Since variance analysis did not reveal significant 
interactions between soils vs. usage systems, are 
shown in the means of usage systems by depths for 
both soils (Figure 1). Haplustox showed 
significantly higher bulk density, and lower total, 
macro and microporosity. The highest soil bulk 
density and lowest total porosity, macro and 
microporosity were due to the lowest oxide 
contents of Fe and Al and coarser granulometry 
(Table 1). However, soils with coarse 
granulometry provided porous formation with 
greater diameter, resulting in a greater 

macroporosity. These traits were not observed in 
this study. This probably was due to the fact that 
the mineralogy of the kaolinitic clay fraction of 
Haplustox led to the formation of compact block 
structures (Ferreira, 1999a). The greater values for 
bulk density, lower total porosity and 
macroporosity in kaolinitic soils when compared 
to oxidic soils agree with studies conducted by 
Chagas et al. (1997) and Ferreira et al. (1999b) in 
soils with similar granulometric composition. 
According to Ferreira et al. (1999a), soils with 
predominantly kaolinite in the clay fraction 
presented small subangular block structures which 
combined with other soil aspects to form pores 
that were predominantly cavities due to the face to 
face adjustment of the kaolinite plates, thus 
resulting in greater bulk density and smaller 
diameter pores. These authors also found that the 
oxidic mineralogy of the clay fraction promoted 
the formation of round microaggregates (&lt;1 mm) 
that were predominately composed of porous 
packages around the microaggregates, which 
formed granular macrostructures with a porous 
appearance “in situ” that promoted the formation 
of a greater quantity of a large porous and lower 
bulk density. Demattê (1988) documented that the 
formation of very stable sand-silt size aggregates 
occured in oxidic soil due to both, clay content and 
cementing elements, or to the actions of iron and 
aluminum oxides. Pinheiro-Dick and 
Schwertmann (1996) reported that hematite and 
goethite form homogeneous microaggregates with 
gibbsite, kaolinite and quartz, thus promoting 
greater porosity when comparing to kaolinitic 
soils. 
The only parameter that did not differ between the 
soils was the macroporosity in 0.0-0.1 m depth 
(Figure 1).  This was due to the changes in the 
structure related to the soil usage, which affected 
mainly the surface layer and was possibly more 
extensive in the more compact Haplustox. 
Moreover, macroporosity is a physical attribute 
that reflects small changes in structure when 
compared to the total porosity and microporosity, 
thus confirming the results obtained by Hill et al. 
(1985), Bertol (1989), Carvalho et al. (1991) and 
Beutler et al. (2001). 
Correlation between Fe and Al oxides and the soil 
physical attributes have shown a negative 
relationship with soil bulk density and positive 
relationship with microporosity and total porosity 
(Table 2), confirming the studies conducted by 
Chagas et al. (1997) and Ferreira et al. (1999b).

However, Ferreira et al. (1999b) found a stronger 
effect of Al oxides on the physical attributes, 
which was probably not observed in this study due 

to the contents of iron oxides being slightly greater 
than the aluminum oxides.

The effects of soil usage on the physical attributes 
were different in Haplustox (Table 3) in relation to 
Eutrustox (Table 4). Haplustox soil under cotton 
cultivation had greater bulk density in the 0.0-0.1 
m depth when compared with sugarcane 

cultivation. This was caused by the intensive 
preparation of the soil using discs plow, harrow 
and four leveler harrowings in cotton, which 
pulverized the soil more at this depth when 
compared to sugarcane, which are cultivated every

five years. Carvalho Filho (1999) did not find 
significant difference for soil density in the area 
cultivated with maize and sugarcane in oxidic 
oxisol, where the soil preparation for maize 

cultivation was less intense compared to cotton 
with only harrowings.

The lower bulk densities at 0.0-0.1 m depth under 
sugarcane and forest was due to the greater content 
of organic matter and not to soil preparation, 
which favored the biologic activity and soil 
structure. In the sugarcane area, a higher bulk 
density at 0.1-0.2 m depth was observed and this 
agrees with the studies done by Carvalho Filho 
(1999). According to Magalhães (1990), soils 
cultivated annually undergo successive processes 
of compaction, which begins with as a natural 
process or as a forced one, due to the traffic of 
agricultural machines and decompaction through 
plowing and harrowing. 
The forested area showed the lowest bulk density 
at all depths and the density increased with depth. 
This was expected because it was a common 
behavior native conditions, which was caused by 
the decrease of organic matter content in depht and 
due the weight of the layers of soil above.  These 
data agreed with the studies conducted by 
Cavenage et al. (1999).  Greater density values in 
cultivated soils have been documented by several 

studies (Carvalho et al., 1999; Cavenage et al., 
1999; Beutler et al., 2001). 
Our results revealed that the increase in the soil 
bulk density caused a reduction in the 
macroporosity in all depths, thus confirming the 
data obtained by Bertol (1989), Cerri et al. (1991), 
Carvalho Filho (1999) and Beutler et al. (2001). 
Macroporosity is the first and most affected by the 
compaction process (Bertol, 1989). This study 
showed that the soil usage systems increased soil 
bulk density and decreased macroporosity and the 
total porosity in all analyzed depths when 
compared to those from native conditions. 
Reduction in macroporosity with depth in the 
forest and sugarcane area is consistent with the 
decrease in the organic matter content with depth. 
Increases in the total porosity and soil 
macroporosity was observed in the area with 
cotton, in the Haplustox, as depth increases, and 
these were probably related to the intense surface 
traffic of machines and equipment during soil 
preparation and deep cultivation with agricultural

implements. These had strong effects on the 
compaction of the surface layer when compared to 
that from the sugarcane area.  
The microporosity for the forest soil was lower at 
all depth and did not increase with the density, 
while the macroporosity decreased in the usage 
systems. These data agreed with those documented 
by Bertol (1989), who found that macroporosity 
was initially affected by the increase of the bulk 
density followed by an increase in the 
microporosity. Similar results were reported by 
Secco et al. (1997), who observed differences in 
the oxisol bulk density and in the macroporosity 

when comparing usage systems, without 
significant alterations in the soil microporosity. 
In Eutrustox (Table 4), the cotton area presented 
higher bulk density at all depths, followed by 
sugarcane.  In oxidic oxisol, Carvalho (1999) did 
not find differences in the bulk density of the 
cultivated area with maize when compared to that 
with sugarcane, probably due to less machine 
operations performed during soil preparation. 
Cultivated soils showed greater densities at 0.0-0.3 
m depth, and these results associated with the 
turning of the soil at that this depth.

Compact layers were not found in Eutrustox at 
0.0-0.3 m depth, which resulted from soil 
preparation under improper conditions, as 
observed for sugarcane at 0.1-0.2 m depth in 
Haplustox. The lack of compact layers was due to 
the oxidic mineralogy of Eutrustox, which 
promoted the formation of very stable 
microaggregates (Demattê, 1988), thus making the 
soil resistant to compression. The greater soil bulk 
density in Eutrustox with cotton caused a decrease 
of the total porosity in all depths and the lowest 
macroporosity at 0.1-0.4 m depth.  Total porosity 
in sugarcane and forested areas were not different, 
but the pores diameter differed, causing a decrease 
in the macroporosity in the area cultivated with 

sugarcane. Therefore, the effect of the usage 
systems on the soil structure was less of an 
influence on these soils. 
Kaolinitic oxisol (Haplustox) showed the greatest 
bulk density and the smallest total porosity,   
macro and microporosity. Soil cultivation 
increased the bulk density and decreased total 
porosity at 0.0-0.3 m depth with intensive effects 
on Haplustox.  Soil cultivated with sugarcane had 
compaction at 0.1-0.2 m depth in Haplustox, while 
cotton had greater bulk density at all depths in the

RESUMO 
 
A mineralogia da fração argila e os sistemas de 
uso exercem fundamental importância na estrutura 
do solo. Assim, objetivou-se avaliar atributos 
físicos de um Latossolo Vermelho Distrófico, 
caulinítico (LVd), e, de um Latossolo Vermelho 
Eutroférrico, oxídico (LVef), sob diferentes 
sistemas de uso, localizados no município de 
Jaboticabal (SP), Brasil. Os sistemas de uso foram: 
cana-de-açúcar; algodão e mata. Foram avaliadas a 
densidade do solo, porosidade total, macro e 
microporosidade, nas profundidades de 0,0-0,1, 
0,1-0,2, 0,2-0,3, 0,3-0,4 m. O Latossolo caulinítico 
(LVd) apresentou maior densidade do solo e 
menor porosidade total, macro e microporosidade. 
O uso aumentou a densidade do solo na 
profundidade de 0,0-0,3 m, com efeitos maiores no 
Latossolo caulinítico, principalmente na 
profundidade de 0,1-0,2 m na área cultivada com 
cana-de-açúcar.
