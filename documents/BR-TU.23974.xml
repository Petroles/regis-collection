ABSTRACT

FERREIRA, A. R. Micromechanical modeling of effective behavior of
anisotropic porous ductile materials. 2019. 151p. Dissertation (Doctorate) – Escola
de Engenharia de São Carlos, Universidade de São Paulo – École Normale Supérieure

The manufacturing of ductile materials generally inserts impurities into their microscopic
composition. These impurities may detach from the surrounding matrix and even crack
along progressive deformation. Due to the consequent incapacity of these undesirable
particles of supporting any stress, these ductile materials are equivalently assumed to be
porous. Porosity has been effectively shown to play a fundamental role in the mechanisms of
ductile fracture. Many micromechanical models have been proposed since the 1970s with the
aim of mathematically describing these mechanisms. Among them, the acclaimed Gurson
model combines the averaging homogenization technique with the kinematic theorem of
Limit Analysis to estimate the macroscopic yield criterion and porosity evolution law
of porous ductile materials. However, the Gurson model and most of its extensions only
account for isotropic ductile fracture. Thus, the purpose of the present work is to contribute
to the conception of yield criteria for anisotropic porous ductile rupture. Three main
contributions are hereby proposed by profiting from similar hypothesis to those of the
Gurson model. The first contribution is the assessment of the influence of void morphology
on overall yield criteria for those classes of materials. The second is the inclusion of an
anisotropic yield criterion in the material matrix so that the macroscopic behavior presents
matrix-induced anisotropy even for spherical cavities. The third and last advancement
consists of generalizing the material matrix yield criterion of the Gurson model in order to
include a linear transformation-based class of yield functions that has been widely used to
represent specific high strength aluminum alloys. The results hereby presented highlight
the consistency and robustness of the three formulations. Moreover, the role of the porosity
on the modeling of yield behavior of aluminum alloys encourages further work regarding
experimental parameter characterization.

Keywords: Ductile fracture. Gurson model. Anisotropy. Porous materials.





RESUMO

FERREIRA, A. R. Modelagem micromecânica do comportamento efetivo de
materiais dúcteis porosos anisótropos. 2019. 151p. Tese (Doutorado) – Escola de
Engenharia de São Carlos, Universidade de São Paulo – École Normale Supérieure

A fabricação de materiais dúcteis insere impurezas em suas composições microscópicas.
Essas impurezas podem se soltar da matriz circundante e até trincar durante um processo de
deformação progressiva. Devido à consequente incapacidade destas partículas indesejáveis
para suportar qualquer esforço, estes materiais dúcteis são equivalentemente assumidos
como sendo porosos. Investigações experimentais têm extensamente mostrado que a
porosidade desempenha um papel fundamental nos mecanismos de ruptura de materais
dúcteis. Desde a década de 1970, vários modelos micromecânicos têm sido propostos para
descrever esses mecanismos matematicamente. Entre eles, o célebre modelo de Gurson
combina a técnica de homogeneização com o teorema cinemático da Análise Limite para
estimar o critério de plastificação macroscópica e a lei de evolução da porosidade dos
materiais dúcteis porosos. No entanto, o modelo de Gurson e a maioria de suas extensões
consideram apenas situações de ruptura dúctil em meios isotrópos. O objetivo do presente
trabalho é, portanto, contribuir para o desenvolvimento de critérios de plastificação para a
ruptura dúctil de meios porosos anisotrópos. Três principais contribuições são propostas
neste trabalho, as quais se valem de hipóteses semelhantes às do modelo de Gurson. A
primeira contribuição é a avaliação da influência da morfologia do vazio nos critérios
de plastificação macroscópica desta classe de materiais. A segunda é a inclusão de um
critério de plastificação anisotrópico na representação da matriz do material, de modo que
o comportamento macroscópico exiba anisotropia induzida por ela, mesmo para cavidades
esféricas. O terceiro e último avanço é a generalização do critério de plasticidade da matriz
de modo a incluir uma classe de funções de plastificação baseadas em transformações
lineares. Esta classe de funcões tem sido amplamente utilizada com sucesso para modelar
ligas de alumínio de alta resistência. Os resultados apresentados neste trabalho atestam a
coerência e robustez das três formulações. Além disso, o papel da porosidade na modelagem
da plasticidade das ligas de alumínio encoraja trabalhos futuros sobre a caracterização
experimental de parâmetros de anisotropia.

RÉSUMÉ

FERREIRA, A. R. Modélisation micromécanique du comportement effectif
des matériaux ductiles poreux anisotropes. 2019. 151p. Thèse (Doctorat) – Escola

La fabrication de matériaux ductiles insère généralement des impuretés dans leurs compo-
sitions microscopiques. Ces impuretés peuvent se détacher de la matrice environnante et
même se fissurer lors d’une déformation progressive. En raison de la résultante incapacité
de ces particules indésirables à supporter toute contrainte, ces matériaux ductiles sont, de
manière équivalente, supposés être poreux. Il a été largement démontré que la porosité
joue un rôle fondamental dans les mécanismes de la rupture ductile. Depuis les années
1970, de nombreux modèles micromécaniques ont été proposés dans le but de décrire
mathématiquement ces mécanismes. Parmi eux, le célèbre modèle de Gurson combine la
technique d’homogénéisation avec le théorème cinématique de l’analyse limite pour estimer
le critère de plastification macroscopique et la loi d’évolution de la porosité des matériaux
ductiles poreux. Cependant, le modèle de Gurson, ainsi que la plupart de ses extensions,
ne tient compte que de la rupture ductile isotrope. Le but du présent travail est donc de
contribuer à la conception de critères de plastification pour la rupture ductile des milieux
poreux anisotropes. Trois contributions principales tirant parti d’hypothèses similaires à
celles du modèle de Gurson sont ici proposées. La première contribution est l’évaluation de
l’influence de la morphologie des vides sur les critères de plastification macroscopique de ces
classes de matériaux. La deuxième est l’inclusion d’un critère de plastification anisotrope
dans la matrice du matériau, de sorte que le comportement macroscopique présente une
anisotropie induite par cette matrice, y compris pour les cavités sphériques. Le troisième et
dernier progrès consiste à généraliser le critère de plastification de la matrice afin d’inclure
une classe de fonctions de plastification basée sur des transformations linéaires. Cette
classe de fonction a été largement employée avec succès pour représenter des alliages
d’aluminium à haute résistance. Les résultats ici présentés soulignent la cohérence et la
robustesse des trois formulations. En outre, le rôle de la porosité sur la modélisation de la
plasticité des alliages d’aluminium incite à poursuivre les travaux sur la caractérisation
expérimentale des paramètres d’anisotropie.

1 INTRODUCTION

The ability of modeling failure process in structures made of ductile materials has
a vital importance in a wide range of activities. For example, it can predict when, where
and how a fracture may occur and propagate in rivet connections made of aluminum alloys
in aircraft fuselages. Additionally, it details the perforation process in metallic plates hit
by projectiles, which indicates the types of alloys that are more appropriate for specific
military applications. Finally, pinned connections of tall steel towers can be prevented
to fail by localization of plastic deformations, which could cause serious damage to the
structure. These examples illustrate that three of the major contemporary industries
benefit from the development of reliable models to understand ductile fracture processes.

Throughout the deformation process of these ductile materials, their mechanical
properties may considerably vary. This variation is due to the intense plastic strain fields
that concentrate around impurities in their microstructure. On the other hand, these
concentration fields deform the surroundings of the impurities so intensely that they
normally detach from the material matrix, which creates pores in the microstructure. With
even more intense loads, these pores become significantly deformed in such a way that
the distribution of stresses from grain to grain in the microscale prefer certain directions
instead of others. Thus, consistent mathematical descriptions to account for the anisotropy
along ductile fracture processes are required.

Studies over the last fifty years demonstrated that microscopic parameters are
crucial to understand these ductile rupture processes. Additionally, not only the failure
processes themselves, but also the mechanical behavior of macroscopic structures has been
shown to be strongly dependent on their microstructure. Thus, a research area called
micromechanics has been the subject of important developments since then with the aim of
taking into account microstructure parameters in the modeling of conventional engineering
structures. This field usually benefits from homogenization techniques so that information
on the constitutive response of highly complex microstructure arrangements can be used
to generate macroscopically homogeneous material models.

The aim of this doctoral dissertation is to propose advances on the mathematical
descriptions of yield criteria associated to ductile rupture. The models hereby developed
are based on the acclaimed Gurson model’s framework. To sum up, three contributions
are presented in this work, all of them focusing solely on effective yield criteria – therefore,
the ongoing evolution in anisotropy with further plastic strain is not taken into account.
The first contribution is the investigation of the influence of different void morphologies
on the overall anisotropic behavior of ductile materials. The second one is the inclusion
of a microscopic anisotropic yield criterion into the original Gurson formulation so that



30 Chapter 1 Introduction

the effect of anisotropic material matrices could be accounted for. Finally, the anisotropic
yield criterion of the material matrix in Gurson’s framework is generalized to linear
transformation-based yield functions. Basically, these functions allow anisotropic aluminum
alloys to be characterized with an arbitrary number of parameters.

A summary of each chapter of the doctoral dissertation is presented below.

• chapter 2 summarizes the state-of-art of the understanding of ductile rupture. Both
classical background and novel tendencies in the field are discussed. The text focuses
on justifying the mechanisms of ductile rupture by appointing the main experimental
evidence that supports them. Moreover, some analytical and numerical studies are
also pointed out in order to complement this evidence. The chapter ends with a brief
overview of the main inconsistencies in the current understanding of shear-dominated
failure of ductile materials that have been reported over the last fifteen years.

• chapter 3 provides an introduction to the modeling of isotropic porous ductile
materials. The chapter begins by introducing the basic concepts of the averaging
homogenization. The Gurson (1975) model is then presented in detail. Some of
its main phenomenological extensions are also briefly discussed. Finally, with the
aim of providing a basis to the understanding of the next chapters, two analytical
extensions of the Gurson model are reviewed. The first one is proposed by Benallal,
Desmorat and Fournage (2014), who assessed the importance of some approximations
in the original formulation of the Gurson model on the overall macroscopic behavior.
The more recent work of Benallal (2017) – which included the third invariant of
microscopic stress into the matrix yield criterion – is also detailed and illustrated by
some numerical examples.

• chapter 4 consists of the first contribution of the present doctoral dissertation. Therein,
an extension of Benallal (2017) is proposed to consider different morphologies of
the pores. Both spheroidal and ellipsoidal voids are explored. The results show
the consistency of the formulation, as well as the robustness of the numerical
implementation. Nevertheless, the anisotropic effect induced by different porous
morphologies is limited to high stress triaxialities. This limitation motivated the
development of the formulations in chapters 5 and 6.

• chapter 5 consists of the second contribution to the doctoral dissertation. In this
chapter, the yield criterion of the material surrounding the pores as considered
by Benallal (2017) is extended in order to include anisotropic material matrices.
This extension relies on the continuum anisotropic yield function of Karafillis and
Boyce (1993) and includes different material symmetries. Four of them are thereby
explored: (i) Cubic; (ii) Transversely Isotropic; (iii) Tetragonal; and (iv) Orthotropic.
Differently to chapter 4, the results point out the sensibility of the anisotropic



31

effects on the material matrix parameters. Besides, the confrontation of orthogonal
material symmetries demonstrates the physical and mathematical consistency of the
formulation.

• chapter 6 consists of the third and last contribution of this doctoral dissertation. A
generalization of the microscopic yield criterion is thereby proposed with the aim of
representing anisotropic material matrices that follow Barlat et al. (2005). Basically,
this work provided a framework to compose yield functions that can include an
arbitrary number of anisotropy parameters to be experimentally determined. This
model has been widely confirmed as being an adequate formulation for continuous –
not porous – modeling of aluminum alloys. Thus, chapter 6 contributes to the field
by inserting this acclaimed model into a Gurson-like formulation for porous ductile
materials. The results show a remarkable influence of the porosity on the overall
macroscopic yield criterion and encourages further experimental characterization
work of porous aluminum alloys.

• chapter 7 provides some details on the numerical implementation of the formulation
contained in chapters 4, 5 and 6. The covered aspects are: (i) the numerical integration
procedure for obtaining macroscopic yield criteria; (ii) the discretization procedure
of the macroscopic strain rate variables; and (iii) an interpolation-based procedure
for obtaining level-set (or contour) plots of three-dimensional yield surfaces.

• chapter 8 finally depicts the advantages and deficiencies of the three formulations
proposed in this doctoral dissertation. Moreover, it links some of the these deficiencies
to further work that must be carried out in the near future.

Three appendix sections contain complementary details on the formulations and
numerical implementation hereby developed:

• Appendix A summarizes some practical aspects of the Voigt notation for symmetric
tensor operations. This notation was used throughout every implementation of this
doctoral dissertation with the aim of saving computation time.

• Appendix B proposes a numerical N-dimensional procedure to obtain level-set (or
contour) plots of N-dimensional surfaces, with applications in Mechanics of Materials.
This procedure is a generalization of that presented in section 7.3 for two-dimensional
surfaces described in three-dimensional spaces.

• Appendix C lists the auxiliary derivatives that are required for the implementation
of Eq. (6.16), (6.28) and (6.29).

2 AN OVERVIEW OF DUCTILE RUPTURE

2.1 Classical background

This section summarizes some important concepts about the classical view of
ductile fracture. Its emphasis is to present both pioneering studies on key concepts and
some of the most significant contributions to the understanding of specific phenomena. The
text is strongly based on the reviews by Hahn, Kanninen and Rosenfield (1972), Schwalbe
(1977), Stone et al. (1985), Garrison Jr and Moody (1987), Benzerga and Leblond (2010)
and Besson (2010). Much richer and vaster overviews can be found in their works.

2.1.1 Nucleation: the genesis of voids

The manufacturing processes of steels and alloys generally result in undesirable
small non-metallic particles in their microstructures. These particles are commonly called
either second-phase particles, because of their different chemical composition to the grains
that compose most of the texture, or inclusions, due to their undesirable presence. They
can be classified into two main types. The first is called endogenous and refers to particles
that arise from the chemical reactions in the melt. The second type is exogenous and
represents inclusions that enter the melt during pouring. While endogenous particles are
typically small and dispersed throughout the material, the exogenous ones vary in size
and tend to be concentrated in specific regions of the casting (BEELEY, 2001).

Due to geometric aspects of the microstructure and to the non-metallic character
of inclusions, the stress and plastic deformation tend to concentrate around them when
the ductile material is under load. Then, two very important mechanisms may occur. The
first one is the decohesion of the particle–matrix interface as a consequence of the intense
plastic flow along the interface. Since it implies that the particle is no longer attached to
the surrounding matrix, the particle can no longer contribute to the material’s mechanical
stiffness. Thus, it is equivalently assumed that a void is generated in the same position as
the original inclusion. This phenomenon is called nucleation by particle–matrix decohesion
and was first documented by Tipper (1948–49 apud GARRISON JR; MOODY, 1987).
Then, Puttick (1959) observed it by studying copper and iron notched specimens under
tensile loading. Following the conclusions of Wilcox and Clauer (1972) and Gurland (1972),
the particle–matrix decohesion is likely to arise first in larger particles.

The second nucleation mechanism takes place when the particle itself – and not
the interface as in the earlier case – cannot support the stress concentration imposed to it.
Therefore, the particle cracks and can no longer add any stiffness to the material. In the



34 Chapter 2 An overview of ductile rupture

same way as the first case, it is thus equivalently assumed that the particle is substituted
by a cavity. This mechanism is known as nucleation by particle cracking and one of the
first experimental pieces of evidences were given by Puttick (1959). More recently, Agarwal
et al. (2002) observed that the process of intermetallic particle cracking of an aluminum
alloy (6061–T651) presented anisotropy behavior due to the rotation of particles during
uniaxial compression tests.

Babout et al. (2004) investigated the hardness effect of aluminum alloys on void
nucleation in tensile tests. For this purpose, a structural 2124 aluminum alloy and a
commercially pure aluminum were chosen to represent a hard and a soft matrix, respectively.
In short, they found that particle cracking generally prevails in materials with a hard
matrix, while particle–matrix decohesion is associated to softer ones. Other trends about
the competition of these two nucleation mechanisms are presented by Benzerga and
Leblond (2010). Among them, it has been found that particle cracking is related to higher
(i) matrix yield strength; (ii) matrix hardening exponent; and (iii) particle elongation
along the tensile test. On the other hand, particle–matrix decohesion is normally linked to
(v) higher particle stiffness and (vi) to transverse loadings.

2.1.2 Void growth

After nucleation, the progress of the loading level continues to concentrate plastic
deformations in portions of the matrix around voids, which causes permanent changes in
their boundaries. Due to this phenomenon, the voids can grow and evolve their shapes. This
mechanism is then called void growth. The earlier experimental investigations that treated
void growth was presented by Ashby (1966), Ashby and Johnson (1969) and Ashby (1970).
The first work stated that the void growth is described mainly by dislocation motions
of grains around the voids. The author also proposed a dislocation-based expression for
the estimation of void growth. However, Rosenfield (1968) concluded that the predictions
provided by this expression was indeed small. Additionally, the hypothesis of the dislocation
influence was found not to be enough to completely describe the void growth phenomenon.

The mechanism of void growth was also introduced and explored by some studies
based on analytical developments in continuum mechanics. Firstly, McClintock, Kaplan
and Berg (1966) developed a fracture criterion for the growth of cylindrical voids immersed
in a viscous (or plastic by a thereby specific approximation) infinite media under shear
loading with a superimposed mean stress. McClintock (1968a) and McClintock (1968b)
(errata) then generalized the earlier work and proposed a criterion for ductile fracture due
to the growth of cylindrical holes under arbitrary history of load. Their main conclusions
highlighted the strong influence of (i) the tensile stress transverse to the void elongation
on the fracture strain (i.e. ductility); (ii) intermediate principal stress also on the fracture
strain; and the history of stress and strain on ductile fracture.



2.1 Classical background 35

Two other very important studies – also based on continuum mechanics approaches
– contributed to understanding of void growth. Rice and Tracey (1969) studied the enlarge-
ment of spherical cavities in an infinite perfectly rigid–plastic medium under remote tensile
stress with a superposed hydrostatic one. Their work concluded that there exists high
dependence of void growth on the stress triaxiality, as well as an exponentially decrease
of the fracture strain with increasing triaxiality. Then, Tracey (1971) went further by
continuing the same path as the earlier work. He investigated the effects of the hardening
exponent and interaction between voids within a similar framework to Rice and Tracey
(1969). His conclusions indicated the decelerating influence of the hardening exponent
on the void enlargement and the need for accounting for large strain theory for further
investigation on the effect of interaction between voids.

2.1.3 Coalescence: the linkage between voids

The next stage of the classical view of ductile rupture consists of the linkage of
adjacent voids due to the intersection of their boundaries and the consequent formation of
microcracks. This stage is called coalescence and may occur due to four main mechanisms:
(i)internal necking; (ii) microshear bands (or "void sheets"); (iii) necklace; and (iv) inter-
granular cracking. This propagation of a microcrack by coalescence is found to evolve in a
very short time interval when compared to the mechanisms cited above, as documented
by Broek (1973).

The internal necking occurs due to the enlargement of two adjacent cavities until
their boundaries collapse and form only one larger cavity (Fig. 1a, 4a and 5a). The term
"necking" refers to the high plastic deformations in the region between two voids just before
they become linked. This mechanism was first suggested by Henry (1855 apud ARGON;
IM; SAFOGLU, 1975) and, since the advent of Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) for
mechanics in the 1950s, it has been unequivocally accepted.

Coalescence by formation of a void sheet arises from the nucleation of smaller – but
numerous – secondary voids oriented following a shear band localization between two larger
and distant voids (Fig. 1b and 4c). Cox and Low (1974) presented their classical result for
a tensile test of an AISI 4340 steel (Fig. 5c). In their experiment, metallography analyses
led to the conclusion that larger voids were nucleated firstly at manganese sulfide particles.
These voids enlarged until a critical point from which smaller particles of carbides started
to nucleate in the narrow band between the larger voids. Although these secondary voids
were much smaller, they were numerous enough so that a void sheet could be formed
by a dense arrangement of microvoids. At the final stage of their experiment, this void
sheet linked the initial two larger voids and then created a macrocrack. The formation of
microscopic shear band localization in single crystals was further investigated by Asaro
(1979) and Pegel et al. (1980). Later, Moody and Greulich (1985) also observed a formation



36 Chapter 2 An overview of ductile rupture

of slip band fracture by void sheet coalescence of carbides in a Fe-Ni-Co superalloy.

Figure 1: An illustration of the coalescence mechanisms by internal necking and by void sheeting.

In Fig. 1a, two voids become linked due to their enlargement until their boundaries collapse by
forming only one larger void. In Fig. 1b, two larger and more distant voids become jointed by
the nucleation of smaller voids aligned with a shear band. Source: (BESSON, 2010).

Necklace (also known as coalescence in columns) is a peculiar coalescence mechanism
discovered by Benzerga (2000). He observed a formation of vertical void sheets in uniaxial
loading tests of steel specimens. Differently to the microshear bands, these sheets resulted
from the alignment of elongated manganese sulfide particles following the loading axis
direction. Consequently, these voids continued to become even more elongated throughout
the increase of the load level until such a point that, even though the particular volume
fraction of each void was small, the voids were linked due to the coincidence of intense
elongation of them in the same "columns" (i.e. loading axis direction). This mechanism
was also perceived in uniaxially loaded steel notched bars in Benzerga, Besson and Pineau
(2004).

Finally, coalescence by intergranular fracture consists of a microcrack propagation
by adjacent particle interfaces. Distinctly to internal necking, it is generally caused by
a deficient resistance of the particle boundaries due to a chemical action of a hostile
environment (DOWLING, 2013). Additionally, this mechanism also tends to occur in high
strength aluminum alloys in which both the matrix and the particles themselves are too
stiff compared to their interfaces (LUDTKA; LAUGHLIN, 1982).

2.1.4 Considerations about ductility

The influence of certain parameters on the ductility has been also assessed by
several experimental and analytical–numerical studies. Increasing stress triaxialities (T , Eq.
(2.1)) from the value of 1/3, were shown to decrease strain failure, according to numerous
studies (e.g. (RICE; TRACEY, 1969) and (AGOGINO, 1978)). The specific value of
T = 1/3 refers to the initial conditions of a uniaxial tensile test in round smooth bars (i.e.
?2 = ?3 = 0 in Eq. (2.1)), according to Benzerga and Leblond (2010).



2.1 Classical background 37

The stress Lode parameter µ (defined in Eq. (2.2)) is found to also decrease ductility
when its value approximates zero, which corresponds to a pure shear condition in the plane
1–3, according to Bao and Wierzbicki (2004), Barsoum and Faleskog (2007b), Barsoum
and Faleskog (2007c), Barsoum and Faleskog (2007a), Barsoum and Faleskog (2011) and
Barsoum, Faleskog and Pingle (2011). The reasons for this is still a matter of intense
research.

where ?1, ?2 and ?3 are the principal macroscopic stresses.

The influence of initial porosity (or equivalently volume fraction of particles) has
been widely recognized as well. It is well-known that the increasing initial porosity causes
decreasing failure strain. This conclusion was first reported in the experimental studies of
Lentz (1978), Speich and Spitzig (1982) and Spitzig (1985). Then, Bourcier et al. (1986)
dedicated a whole study to assess the effect of initial porosity on the fracture process of
titanium alloys with different hardening behaviors. They concluded that the concentration
of porosity in certain regions of their specimens led to localization-induced cracks.

The orientation of elongated particles was also a subject of investigation in the
1970s. Bernard, Grumbach and Moliexe (1975) and Wilson (1979) studied short-transverse
ductility of steel plates and fatigue properties of a carbon plate steel A516–70, respectively.
Their works agreed that the more an elongated void was transversely oriented to the
rolling direction, the less ductile the materials became.

2.1.5 Reference values of critical porosities

The overall porosity f? of a given material is defined as an estimation of the average
of volume fraction of every void. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that a critical porosity f?c
is related to the beginning of a coalescence process and, thus, to the final stage of ductile
rupture itself.

Following this idea, estimations of f?c have been consistently proposed in the
literature. Nowadays, there is consensus that, for most ductile rupture conditions, the
critical porosity may vary in f?c ? [? 1%,? 2%], according to Marino, Mudry and Pineau
(1985), Pardoen and Delannay (1998), Benzerga, Besson and Pineau (2004) and Benzerga,
Besson and Pineau (2004).



38 Chapter 2 An overview of ductile rupture

2.2 Recent investigations

In the last 15 years, many efforts have been devoted to better explaining some incon-
sistencies between experimental observations regarding ductile failure in shear-dominated
loadings (i.e. ?1/3 ? T ? 1/3 and µ ? 0). The classical works that performed tensile
tests, generally on round smooth or notched bars, assured that the failure strain decreases
for increasing stress triaxialities T from 1/3 on (e.g. the work of Hancock and Mackenzie
(1976)). These results are in agreement with the predictions provided by the analytical
work of Rice and Tracey (1969). Additionally, in the 1980s, Johnson and Cook (1985) found
that ductility continued to increase with decreasing positive triaxialities below T = 1/3.

However, Bao and Wierzbicki (2004) obtained a very different outcome from a
series of tests on a 2024-T351 aluminum alloy. They found that the ductility decreased
for decreasing triaxialities below T ? 1/3 and that it reached a minimum in the vicinities
of the level T = 0. Notwithstanding, the ductility then increased quickly for decreasing
values of T ? 0, as illustrated in Fig. 2.

Figure 2: The relation between fracture strain and stress triaxiality for tests on a 2024-T351
aluminum alloy.

For a decreasing stress triaxiality T, Bao and Wierzbicki (2004) obtained (i) an increasing
ductility until T ? 0.4; (ii) a decreasing ductility until it reached a minimum level at T ? 0; and
a rapidly increasing ductility for ?1/3 ? T ? 0. Source: (BAO; WIERZBICKI, 2004).

The scientific community promptly proposed some explanations. Teng and Wierzbicki



2.2 Recent investigations 39

(2006) proposed that (i) a void growth mechanism should prevail in the region T ? 1/3
and (ii) a shear-decohesion should predominantly occur for T &amp;lt;1/3. Later, Barsoum
and Faleskog (2007b), Barsoum and Faleskog (2007c) and Barsoum and Faleskog (2011)
proposed that ductile fracture should be developed by a combination of the mechanisms
of intervoid necking (Fig. 4a and 5a) and intervoid shearing (Fig. 4b and 5b).

Nevertheless, more inconsistencies have been continually reported in the present
decade. For example, Ghahremaninezhad and Ravi-Chandar (2013) obtained a shear-
dominated failure mode on a 6061-T6 aluminum alloy that apparently did not involve any
influence of coalescence of voids. Additionally, increasing ductility related to a decreasing
stress triaxiality was observed by Ghahremaninezhad and Ravi-Chandar (2012), Ghahre-
maninezhad and Ravi-Chandar (2013), Haltom, Kyriakides and Ravi-Chandar (2013) and
Scales, Tardif and Kyriakides (2016).

The interaction between coalescence and localization phenomenon was investigated
by Teko?lu, Hutchinson and Pardoen (2015). They performed 3D FEM calculations
on an elastoplastic periodic cell to find out whether these two mechanisms occurred
simultaneously. They concluded that (i) for increasing stress triaxialities, coalescence and
localization tend not to occur at the same time; and (ii) for triaxialities near zero, these
mechanisms tend to occur simultaneously.

The influence of the Lode parameter on the evolution of porosity in ductile materials
was studied by Danas and Ponte Castañeda (2012). They used a second order nonlinear
homogenization method of Ponte Castañeda (2002a) to obtain the effective response of
porous materials under different loading conditions. They remarked that the effect of the
Lode parameter µ is more significant at the evolution of porosity than at the effective
yield surfaces. Moreover, their results showed that the lowest failure strain coincided
with a Lode parameter µ = 1, while no void collapse was observed for the axisymmetric
condition of µ = ?1. However, Hutchinson and Tvergaard (2012) argued that 3D FEM
calculations – as in Bao and Wierzbicki (2004) – indicate that the minimum ductility
should not coincide with µ = 1. According to them, some analytical considerations in
Danas and Ponte Castañeda (2012) could have erroneously influenced this result.

Dunand and Mohr (2014) performed several 3D FEM analysis of periodic cells –
including contact and large strain theory – to assess the influence of the Lode angle on the
localization at low triaxialities. Some of their results are shown in Fig. 3. Each black dot in
this figure represents a proportional loading, keeping constant both stress triaxiality and
Lode angle, that led the cell to a localization pattern. They found that the failure strain
is a convex function of both the stress Lode angle and triaxiality. Besides, Fig. 3 reveals
that the localization phenomenon does not occur for stress triaxialities approximately in
the range of T ? [0, 0.18]. Furthermore, for around T ? [0.18, 0.6], the development of
localization relies on a specific variation of the Lode angle as a function of the triaxiality.

proportional loading that led the cell to a failure due to localization. Note: Due to different
nomenclatures in their manuscript, ? represents the stress triaxiality T, while ? to the stress

In a very recent work, Noell, Carroll and Boyce (2018) proposed an extended
group of seven mechanisms that should play a role in different ductile rupture conditions.
According to them, these mechanisms may not only compete with one another – as in
the sense of Barsoum’s view –, but they may facilitate the occurrence of other ones.
Moreover, these mechanisms can also work sequentially in a progressive load to rupture of
a material. These mechanisms are illustrated by schematic representations, in Fig. 4, and
by experimental observations provided by the literature in Fig 5. Since Noell, Carroll and
Boyce (2018) limited their experimental investigations to high-purity copper, nickel and
aluminum, further works are required to validate their hypothesis to structural engineering

materials and high-strength alloys.

Coalescence-based mechanisms: (a) coalescence by adjacent enlarged voids until their boundaries
collapse into a larger unique void; (b) coalescence by a nucleation of small voids that are aligned
to a shear band localization; and (c) linkage of two larger voids by the nucleation of smaller and
numerous ones following the direction of one or more shear bands. Coalescence-free mechanism:
(d) in the Orowan Alternating Splip (OAS) mechanism, groups of voids are nucleated in the
vicinities of the crossing points of two slip bands and then proceed to grow (no coalescence).

localization band; and (g) rupture by slipping along multiple shear localization bands. Source:

3 ISOTROPIC DUCTILE FRACTURE MODELING: THE GURSON MODEL
AND ITS EXTENSIONS

This chapter describes some of the most relevant models for isotropic ductile fracture.
The first one is the acclaimed Gurson model, which was proposed by Gurson (1975) (in
his doctoral dissertation) and then by Gurson (1977) (in a scientific paper). Basically, he
combines the averaging homogenization technique with the kinematic approach of Limit
Analysis theorem to analytically formulate a continuum constitutive model for porous
ductile materials that couples yield criterion and damage evolution. Since then, several
extensions of this model – some purely phenomenological and other numerical/analytical –
have been proposed in order to overcome some of its limitations. Among these, some of the
most important work to the field, and also useful to the understanding of the contributions
of this doctoral dissertation, are hereby presented. Moreover, the basic concepts about the
averaging homogenization technique and the notations used throughout this document –
not only in this chapter – are resumed in the first section.

3.1 Preliminaries

3.1.1 Tensorial and matrix algebra notations

Throughout this document, most mathematical expressions are written following
an intrinsic or index tensorial notation. Scalar quantities are represented by regular weight
letters (e.g. ?, ?, r, R). First and second-order tensors are referred to in bold letters (e.g.
?, ??, E?). Their precise orders are indicated in the text and may also be inferred by the
context. Fourth-order tensors are written in cursive letters (e.g. L, C).

Whenever needed, additional notation is also used in some sections in order to avoid
ambiguities between matrices and vectors. A matrix algebra notation is then conveniently
adopted in certain sections concerning aspects of numerical implementation. According to
this notation, a scalar variable is still represented by regular letters (e.g. C, ?, ?). However,
vectors and matrices are still written in bold, but hold respectively one and two underlines
(e.g. vectors are ??, ??, while matrices are L, C).

The numerical implementation of products involving symmetric high-order tensors
requires an equivalent matrix algebra representation so that the unnecessary operations are
avoided. For this purpose, the well-known Voigt notation is used in order to conveniently
treat tensor operations as matrix–vector relations. Some details about this notation are
given in Appendix A.

3.1.2 A brief overview of the averaging homogenization technique

In general terms, homogenization techniques offer approaches for modeling het-
erogeneous media (i.e. consisting of more than one material) by defining an equivalent,
but hypothetical, homogeneous medium. However, in most engineering materials, the
heterogeneities are arbitrarily distributed on microscale, which does not allow that every
heterogeneity be accounted for. In order to avoid this inconvenience, Hill (1963) proposed
that a heterogeneous medium could be consistently represented by its smallest material
portion that contains every relevant property of the material. This portion is commonly
called Representative Volume Element (RVE) or Representative Elementary Volume (REV).
According to Besson et al. (2010), the validity of this idealization is guaranteed for most
cases if the characteristic lengths (i) lRV E of the RVE; (ii) lstruct of the engineering structure
to be modeled; and (iii) lload of the load fluctuations applied to the final structure satisfy

lRV E ? lstruct
lRV E ? lload.

(3.1)

Based on the RVE concept, the equivalence between the real heterogeneous material
(represented by the RVE) and the fictitious homogeneous one is achieved by averaging the
microscopic (i.e. pointwise in the RVE) stress and strain fields in the domain ? – including
heterogeneities, voids, inclusions – (Fig. 6). These averaged tensors are then assumed to
be those of the hypothetical homogeneous material. The average of a statically admissible
(i.e. equilibrated) microscopic stress field ?? in the domain ? of the RVE is

The illustrated RVE contains four arbitrary heterogeneities enumerated from 1 to 4. The
material matrix is represented by ?m, while ?i represents the interior of the i-th heterogeneity.
The boundary ??+ denotes the outer surface of the RVE. The total domain ? is defined as
? = ?m ??1 ??2 ??3 ??4. This RVE representation is taken as two-dimensional for the sake
of simplicity and distinctness. However, the RVEs used in the next sections of this document are
assumed to be three-dimensional, as will be indicated later on. Source: the author.

The integrals in Eq. (3.2) and (3.3) can be equivalently evaluated in the external

considering no volume forces and small strains theory,

(?ikxj),k = ?ik,kxj + ?ikxj,k = ?ij
and

?ij =

(u??i,j + u?j,i).

where n(x) is the normal unitary vector to the outer surface ??+ at the point x ? ??+.

Although the averaging process is straightforward, an equally important – but more
complicated – task is the definition of the boundary conditions to the RVE problem. These
boundary conditions must represent as accurately as possible the actual situation in which
the microscopic portion of material is subjected. However, it is a very complex task due
to the arbitrary distribution of the heterogeneities and the impossibility of determining
the precise stress and strain field acting on the planes of interaction between two material
portions. Two idealizations regarding these questions were then proposed by Hill (1963):
(i) uniform stress field on the external boundary ??+ (Eq. (3.6)); and (ii) uniform strain
field on the external boundary ??+ (Eq. (3.7)).

Fd(x) = ? ·n(x) x ? ??+, (3.6)

where Fd(x) is the traction vector applied at x ? ??+ and ? is a uniform (i.e. constant)
macroscopic stress tensor applied on ??+.

u?d(x) = E? ·x x ? ??+ (3.7)



46 Chapter 3 Isotropic ductile fracture modeling: The Gurson model and its extensions

where u?d(x) is the velocity vector at x ? ??+ and E? is a uniform (i.e. constant)
macroscopic strain rate tensor applied on ??+.

These two types of boundary conditions lead to relevant conclusions. The first
one is that the boundary condition of uniform stress implies the average &amp;lt;? &gt; to equal
the applied macroscopic stress ?. Similarly, the second one is that uniform strain in
??+ causes &amp;lt;?? &gt;= E?. These two results can save computational effort in numerical
implementations involving one of these assumptions. They can also be easily verified by
considering Eq. (3.4) and (3.5).

The strain energy density may also be conveniently averaged in the domain of
the RVE. Thanks to the Hill-Mandel lemma ((HILL, 1967) and (MANDEL, 1972 apud
ZAOUI, 2002)), the average strain energy density can be equivalently evaluated as

&amp;lt;? : ?? &gt;=&amp;lt;? &gt;:&amp;lt;?? &gt; . (3.8)

Throughout this document, the adjective macroscopic indicates that a certain field
(stress and strain rate) is averaged in the domain ? of an RVE, even though its precise
meaning is related to uniform fields that are imposed as boundary conditions on ??.
Additionally, the term effective is also used by meaning averaged.

3.1.3 Microscopic quantities

In the present text, the microscopic stress tensor is represented by ?. This tensor
is conveniently decomposed in terms of its three stress invariants: (i) the hydrostatic (or
mean) stress ?m; (ii) the von Mises (or equivalent) measure of stress ?eq; and (iii) the Lode
angle ?. The microscopic stress tensor can then be written as

? = ?eqe?(?) + ?m1, (3.9)

?m =

and 1 is the identity matrix of order three.

Similarly, the microscopic strain rate ?? is hereby written in terms of its three
invariants: (i) the hydrostatic (or mean) strain rate ??m; (ii) the equivalent measure of
strain ??eq; and (iii) the Lode angle ? as

?? = ??eqe

As the following chapters deal with incompressible material matrices, the hydrostatic
strain rate is nulled in the equations above (i.e ??m = 0).

3.1.4 Macroscopic quantities

The macroscopic stress and strain rate are represented by ? and E?, respectively.
Analogously to the previous subsection, the macroscopic stress is defined in terms of
its invariants (i) macroscopic hydrostatic stress ?m (or, equivalently, the macroscopic
stress triaxiality T ? [??,?]); (ii) the deviatoric macroscopic stress; (iii) von Mises (or
equivalent) macroscopic stress ?eq; and (iv) the macroscopic stress Lode angle ?:

3.2 The Gurson Yield Criterion 49

3.1.5 Graphical representation of macroscopic yield surfaces

In order to avoid representing the yield surface in three-dimensional plots, it is
preferable to benefit from the intersection of the surface with certain planes that hold
fundamental concepts from Mechanics of Materials. The first is called deviatoric plane (or
even ?-plane or Nadai’s plane). It consists of an intersection of the yield surface with a
plane that is orthogonal to the hydrostatic axis for a prescribed value ?m = ??m, as Fig. 7
illustrates for a hypothetical yield stress.

The second useful family of planes is called meridional planes. A meridional plane,
in the context of yield surfaces, corresponds to two given values of stress Lode angles: (i)
? = ?? to obtain a semi-plan; and (ii) ? = ?? + ? to its complementary semi-plan. In Fig.
8, the prescription of ? = ?? may be understood as the upper quadrants of the meridional
curves (?eq ? 0); and ? = ?? + ?, to ?eq &amp;lt;0.

3.2 The Gurson Yield Criterion

In the 1970s, Gurson (1975) and Gurson (1977) formulated a model with the aim of
describing isotropic ductile rupture by an adequate constitutive model to be implemented
within recurrent engineering problems. His approach starts by conceiving two main RVE
configurations: (i) a hollow sphere with a centered spherical cavity inside it; and (ii) a
cylinder with an also aligned cylindrical void contained in it. The spherical RVE was

chosen to represent materials whose particles in microscale are arbitrarily distributed (i.e.
macroscopic isotropy). The second RVE was taken to simulate materials whose defects in
microscale are distributed with a preferred direction. Although both models were proposed
in his doctoral dissertation, the spherical model has received much more attention in the
literature. Accordingly, the present work explores only the spherical approach from here
on.

The material matrix in a vicinity of the void is assumed to be continuous and
(i) to follow von Mises criterion of plastification; (ii) to hold the normality rule for the
plastic flow; (iii) not to present any hardening rule (i.e perfectly plastic material); and (iv)
to undergo solely plastic deformation (i.e. rigid-plastic material). These assumptions are
mathematically described by

?(?) = ?eq ??0 ? 0, (3.35)

?? = ??pl = ??
??

??
and (3.36)

Tr ?? = 0, (3.37)

where ?(?) ? 0 is the isotropic yield function, ? is the Cauchy stress tensor, ?0 is the
microscopic yield stress, ?eq is the von Mises (or equivalent) stress, ?? and ??pl are respectively
the total and the plastic microscopic strain rate tensor and ?? is the microscopic plastic
multiplier rate.



3.2 The Gurson Yield Criterion 51

The radii of the inner (i.e. void) and the outer spheres are respectively represented
by rv and R (Fig. 9). The porosity parameter

f =
(
rv
R

)3
(3.38)

is defined as the ratio between the volumes of the cavity and the total volume occupied by
the RVE. A point in ? can be conveniently described by a spherical coordinate system, as
depicted in Fig. 10.

A uniform strain rate boundary condition is imposed on the outer surface ??+

in order to facilitate the choice of candidates to the trial strain rate field, as discussed



52 Chapter 3 Isotropic ductile fracture modeling: The Gurson model and its extensions

hereafter. The macroscopic strain rate E? is imposed in the external surface by the relation

u? = E? ·x. (3.39)

Additionally, the void surface requires another boundary condition. For this purpose,
Gurson assumed that the void surface was traction-free. This assumption can be regarded
as a uniform stress boundary condition in ???:

Fd(x) = 0, x ? ??? (3.40)

where Fd(x) is the traction vector on the void surface.

The microscopic dissipation potential ? can then be defined as a function of a
microscopic stress field ? and an traceless microscopic strain rate field ?? as

?(??) = sup
???
{? : ??} (3.41)

where ? = {?|?(?) =? ?0} is a convex set of statically admissible stress tensors ? and
?(?) is homogenous of degree one.

The combination of the normality rule for the flow of the microscopic plastic strain
rate ?? = ????/?? with the first degree homogeneity of the yield function ?(?), Eq. (3.41)
can be rewritten as

?(??) = ? :
(
??
??

??

)
= ??? :

??

??
= ???(?) = ???0, (3.42)

The evaluation of the plastic multiplier rate ?? can be done in terms of a kinematically
admissible (also called compatible) strain rate field ??. According to this kinematic condition,
the microscopic strain rate ?? must respect the essential boundary condition, which is, in
the Gurson’s RVE problem, imposed on the outer surface (i.e. ??(R,?,?) = E?). From Eq.
(3.18) and (3.36), the plastic multiplier rate then satisfies

It follows from Eq. (3.42) and (3.43) that the microscopic plastic dissipation ?(??)
may thus be written in terms of only the compatible strain rate field ??? as

?(??) = ?0??eq (3.44)

and the macroscopic plastic dissipation potential is then derived by an average in the RVE
volume as

eqdV. (3.45)

The solution to the RVE (i.e. the velocity or strain rate field) can be obtained by a
minimization of the macroscopic plastic dissipation potential ? in Eq. (3.45). However,
this minimization procedure would result in too much of a complex description to use in
common engineering situations.

Gurson (1975) then proposed that the solution could be approximated in a conve-
nient way by carefully choosing a trial strain rate field ??G. This field would constitute an
upperbound approximated solution to the minimization of ? based on kinematic theorem
of Limit Analysis. It means that, by evaluating ? in Eq. (3.45) with a compatible ??? –
but different to the exact solution ?? – the resultant dissipation should be certainly greater
than the exact dissipation calculated with ??.

The Gurson’s trial strain rate field ??G relied on the contemporary results obtained
by McClintock (1968a) and Rice and Tracey (1969). According to these authors, the ductile
fracture is strongly dependent on the stress triaxiality. Gurson then idealized that the
kinematically admissible velocity field u?G could be decomposed into two parts. The first,
u?VG, should be the exact solution of a perfectly rigid-plastic hollow sphere under uniform
external pressure. The second, u?SG, should be an approximation of a velocity field that
would only cause a shape change to the RVE. Their expressions in terms of the macroscopic
strain rate E? and written in the spherical coordinate system depicted in Fig. 10 are

u?VG = E?m

where E?? = E? ? E?m1 is the macroscopic deviatoric strain rate and

The compatibility equations from continuum mechanics allowed then to derive the

3 is RVE outer sphere volume and dV = r2 sin ?d?d?dr is the differential

volume element written in spherical coordinates, with r ? [rv,R], ? ? [0, 2?] and ? ? [0,?].

The viability of obtaining the analytical solution of Eq. (3.50) requires certain sim-
plifications. Gurson (1975) assumed that the parcel ?4E?m

model. The argument was that this elimination was in fact linked to the linearization of
the microscopic dissipation ?(??G) in terms of the variable

µ =
eTr .E?.er
E?eq

.

Thus, he concluded that the high-order terms in the series expansion of ?(??G) could be
neglected so that the resultant expression of ? in Eq. (3.50) could be simplified. This
simplified expression reads

Figure 11 illustrates the macroscopic yield surface obtained by the Gurson model
for a material whose porosity is f = 1% and the yield stress is adopted unitary ?0 = 1. It
can be observed that the macroscopic behavior of the deviatoric planes shown in Fig. 11a
are circumferential, which is a direct influence of the microscopic von Mises yield criterion.
Moreover, the meridional planes depicted in Fig. 11b are independent on the macroscopic
stress Lode angle ?.

It is important to remark that, due to the linearization of ?(??G) performed by
Gurson (1975), the macroscopic stress Lode angle ? is restricted to the Lode angle ?
associated to the macroscopic strain rate tensor. This coincidence is clearly a limitation
that arises from that linearization. More recent works, as Benallal, Desmorat and Fournage
(2014) and Benallal (2017), have overcome this limitation with semi-analytical developments
and are described in section 3.4.

3.3 Phenomenological extensions

The Gurson model has been the topic of several studies since the 1980s aiming to
surpass some of its limitations. A common approach for extending its capabilities is called
phenomenological due to the nature of altering its original formulation. Basically, the pre-
dictions obtained with the original model are confronted with cell model FEM calculations
and experimental data. Then, some heuristic modification based on these comparisons is

proposed in order to better represent the reference behavior with a modification of the
original model.

A classical Gurson model modification is that presented by Tvergaard (1981) and
Tvergaard (1982). In these works, two parameters q1 and q2 were inserted into the original
Gurson yield function (Eq. (3.56)) so that it better agreed with numerical computations
of cylindrical and spherical periodic cells of porous materials. These works found that
q1 = 1.5 and q2 = 1.0 calibrated the modified yield function (Eq. (3.57)) with enough
accuracy.

Another important extension of the Gurson model was proposed by Tvergaard and
Needleman (1984). They argued that Gurson (1975) overestimated the porosity associated
with the loss of the material stress capacity (fc = 1/q1). Thus, they proposed that the
porosity should be defined as

is the porosity for which the material loses the capacity of supporting any stress. Based
on the conclusions of the experimental investigations of Brown and Embury (1973 apud
TVERGAARD; NEEDLEMAN, 1984) and Andersson (1977), Tvergaard and Needleman
(1984) chose the values fc = 0.15 and fF = 0.25, respectively.

The effect of hardening in material matrices on the overall behavior of the Gurson-
Tvergaard-Needleman (GTN) model was assessed by Koplik and Needleman (1988). They
analyzed the spherical voids in periodic cells whose material matrix followed an exponential
hardening law. According to their conclusions, q1 = 1.25 and q2 = 1.0 minimized the
discrepancy of the GTN model with FEM calculations of periodic cells. Furthermore, a
smaller value of fc = 0.03 was required so that the accelerated void growth due to the
matrix hardening was accounted for.

In a review on ductile material failure, Tvergaard (1990) resumed several studies on
calibration of the parameters q1 and q2 by comparing the GTN model with both numerical
and experimental references. He remarks that, in general, q1 ? [1.25, 2.0] and q2 ? 1.0
reasonably agree with those references.

Twenty years after the proposition of the GTN model, Bao and Wierzbicki (2004)
pointed out the inconsistency between the prediction and experimental results of the strain
failure for stress triaxialities less than T &amp;lt;1/3 (see section 2.2 and Fig. 2). Based on this
fact, a phenomenological extension of the Gurson model was developed by Nahshon and
Hutchinson (2008). They proposed a modification on the evolution law of porosity so that
the GTN model could better predict the strain failure caused by shear-dominated loadings.
For this purpose, the new evolution law was altered to be dependent on the macroscopic
stress Lode angle ?:

f? = (1 ?f) Tr E? + q?f?(?)
?? : E?
?eq

, (3.59)

where q? is a scalar parameter to adjust the influence of the shear loading on the porosity
evolution law, ?? is the deviatoric part of the macroscopic stress tensor ?, and ?(?)
is the macroscopic stress Lode angle given by Eq. (3.27). The parameter q? must be
graphically inferred in Nahshon and Hutchinson (2008) as a function of the initial porosity
f0.

The prediction of strain failure by the Nahshon and Hutchinson (2008) for different
values of q? and increasing macroscopic stress triaxialities is depicted in Fig. 12. Their
model could capture the overall tendency of decreasing ductility for decreasing stress
triaxialities below T = 1/3 as in Bao and Wierzbicki (2004). However, there were no
improvements in the shape of the macroscopic yield surfaces and further works have been
developed since.

3.4 Analytical and numerical extensions

Basically, analytical and numerical extensions of the Gurson (1977) model relies on
choosing some trial velocity field and on simplifications of the model in such a way that
analytical developments become feasible. Among the more recent extensions, most have
been concerned with the influence of the macroscopic Lode angle on the effective yield
criterion of porous materials. For example, Cazacu et al. (2014) chose the trial velocity field
proposed by Rice and Tracey (1969) to obtain macroscopic yield surfaces of those materials
under axisymmetric loadings and concluded that these surfaces were dependent on the
stress Lode angle. Trillat and Pastor (2005) also verified this dependence by performing
non-linear optimizations based on both conic programming and the kinematic and static
approaches of the Limit Analysis. Finally, Cheng et al. (2015) used the statical theorem of
limit analysis to impose trial stress fields to 3D porous RVEs. They also obtained a yield
criterion explictly dependent on the stress Lode angle.

Additionally, the effect of the microscopic stress Lode angle has also been a matter
of recent developments. In short, the insertion of the effect of this angle accounts for
non-quadratic yield criteria of material matrices (e.g. Tresca, Hershey-Hosford, William-
Warnke). For instance, Trillat, Pastor and Thoré (2006) performed a non-linear optimization
algorithm based on conic programming to obtain effective yield criterion of porous materials
whose matrix followed Drucker-Prager criterion. Another example is the work of Soare
(2016), who extended the Gurson model to account for the Hershey-Hosford matrix criterion.



3.4 Analytical and numerical extensions 59

They proceeded to approximate the expression of the microscopic plastic dissipation by a
truncated Fourier series. This approximation allowed them to numerically obtain effective
yield surfaces.

The next two subsections review some details of the two recent works by Benallal,
Desmorat and Fournage (2014) and Benallal (2017), which are crucial to understanding
the following chapters.

3.4.1 An assessment on the effect of linearizing the microscopic plastic potential in the
Gurson model (BENALLAL; DESMORAT; FOURNAGE, 2014)

The effect of the linearization of the microscopic plastic dissipation ?(??G) on the
overall microscopic yield criterion obtained by the Gurson model was assessed by Benallal,
Desmorat and Fournage (2014). They proceeded to the minimization of the macroscopic
plastic dissipation ?(E?) (Eq. (3.50)) without simplifying the expression of ?(??G). For this
purpose, they obtained the expression of the macroscopic stress ? = ??/?E? by bearing
the full expression of

?(E?) =

Since E? can be equivalently written in terms of its three invariants (E?m or H, E?eq
and ? or cos 3?), the derivative ? = ??/?E? is decomposed into three chain rule parcels

This assumption is consistent to isotropic materials due to the guarantee of coincidence of
the principal directions of ? and E?. However, in anisotropic analyses, another approach
should be applied (more details in chapter 4).

The complexity of Eq. (3.61) prevents that the resultant yield criterion to be
written in a closed-form expression as in Gurson (1977). Nevertheless, Eq. (3.61) can be
accurately solved by using common numerical integration procedures. Thus, Fig. 13 depicts
three meridional planes of a macroscopic yield surface related to a material whose porosity
and yield stress are respectively assumed f = 1% and ?0 = 1. These meridional planes



60 Chapter 3 Isotropic ductile fracture modeling: The Gurson model and its extensions

correspond to six different levels of the macroscopic stress Lode angle: ? = 0, ? = ?/6 and
? = ?/3 for the upper quadrants (?eq ? 0); and ? = ?, ? = ?/6 + ? and ? = ?/3 + ? for
the lower quadrants (i.e. ?eq &amp;lt;0). As Gurson (1975) had remarked, the linearization of
?(??G) does not strongly affect the overall model’s behavior. However, further improvements
on the Gurson model relies on the possibility of accounting for the influence of the stress
Lode angle on shear-dominated loads, which can only be considered, in the context of the
Gurson model, by using the non-linearized plastic dissipation potential, as in Benallal,
Desmorat and Fournage (2014).

3.4.2 Including the influence of the microscopic stress Lode angle on the Gurson model
(BENALLAL, 2017)

Subsequently to Benallal, Desmorat and Fournage (2014), Benallal (2017) included
the influence of the microscopic stress Lode angle ? on the Gurson model. This parameter
was inserted into the microscopic yield criterion ?(?) by defining an auxiliary function
g(?) that multiplies the equivalent measure of stress ?eq:

?(?) = ?eqg(?) ??0 ? 0 (3.62)

where, in order to guarantee the convexity of the yield surface given by ?(?), the function
g(?) must satisfy g??(?) + g(?) ? 0.

In a practical view, the function g(?) generalizes the shape of the microscopic
yield surface. Thus, a desired behavior of the yield criterion may be obtained by defining
a specific function g(?). Accordingly, Benallal (2017) proposed a particularization of
g(?) so that it represents the Hershey-Hosford yield criterion ((HERSHEY, 1954 apud
NEMAT-NASSER; HORI, 1993) and (HOSFORD, 1972))

?HH =
{1

[(?1 ??2)

m + (?3 ??1)

}1/m

. (3.63)

The particularized expression of g(?) to represent this criterion is shown in Eq. (3.64).
The von Mises yield criterion is retrieved if m = 2; the Tresca’s, if m ??.

g(?) =

(3.64)

where ?1 = ?, ?2 = ? ? 2?/3 and ?3 = ? + 2?/3.

In a similar way to Gurson (1975), the microscopic plastic potential was obtained.
For this purpose, one must recall the relations for the microscopic yield criterion in Eq.
(3.62) and the normality rule for the plastic flow in Eq. (3.36). The microscopic plastic
dissipation potential ?(??) is then analogous to that in Eq. (3.42). The main difference
from Benallal’s approach to Gurson’s is the expression of the plastic multiplier rate ??,
since the microscopic yield criterion ?(?) is also dependent on the shape function g(?):

?? =

In order to eliminate the dependence of ?? in Eq. (3.65) on the microscopic stress
Lode angle ?, a relation between ? and ? had to be derived. Then, Benallal (2017)
proceeded following the definition of the microscopic strain rate Lode angle ? in Eq. (3.20).

.

(3.67)

The necessity of writing the microscopic plastic dissipation ? in Eq. (3.42) only in
terms of the ??? or its invariants requires ? to be obtained by a given ?. This means that
the relation ? = ?(?) in Eq. (3.67) must be inverted. Although it is not possible to be
analytically achieved, a one-dimensional interpolation procedure can accurately obtain

? ? ?(?) (3.68)

The approximation in Eq. (3.68) leads to rewriting the plastic multiplier rate in ??
in Eq. (3.65) only in terms of the admissible microscopic strain rate ??? as

?? =
??eq?

[g(?)]2 + [g?(?)]2
?

??eq?
[g(?(?))]2 + [g?(?(?))]2

. (3.69)

The microscopic plastic dissipation potential ?(???) can be finally defined as

?(???) = ?0??eqG(??
?), (3.70)

where the auxiliary function G(???) satisfies

G(???) =
1?

[g(?(?))]2 + [g?(?(?))]2
. (3.71)

Analogously to Benallal, Desmorat and Fournage (2014), the macroscopic stress
? is obtained by assuming the Gurson’s trial field ??G (Eq. (3.49)) as the admissible
microscopic strain rate ??? := ??G. Additionally, the derivative ? = ??/?E? is still evaluated



3.4 Analytical and numerical extensions 63

by considering E? dependent only on its three invariants E?m or H, E?eq and ? as in Eq.
(3.61).

The strong effect of the third microscopic stress invariant ? is illustrated in Fig. 14.
Therein, two groups of macroscopic deviatoric planes are highlighted. The first one (Fig.
14a) is associated to a shape parameter m = 8 and may be regarded as an intermediate
state between the von Mises and Tresca criteria. The second group (Fig. 14b) was obtained
for m = 20, which already presents a behavior closer to that idealized by Tresca. Both
groups consist of macroscopic deviatoric planes for different levels of ?fm = ?m/|?maxm |.

Meridional planes correspondent to the macroscopic yield surface in Fig. 14 are
shown in Fig. 15, for m = 8, and in Fig. 16, for m = 20. In both figures, six levels of
macroscopic stress Lode angle are illustrated: ? = 0, ? = ?/6 and ? = ?/3, for the upper
quadrants (i.e. ?eq ? 0); and ? = 0 + ?, ? = ?/6 + ? and ? = ?/3 + ?, for the lower
quadrants (i.e. ?eq &amp;lt;0). It can be observed that the microscopic stress Lode angle ?
considerably affects the macroscopic meridional planes. There is a remarkable consequence
in the clearer distinction between different macroscopic stress Lode angles ? levels in
comparison to those results obtained by Benallal, Desmorat and Fournage (2014) for the
microscopic von Mises criterion (Fig. 13).

4 EFFECT OF POROUS MORPHOLOGY ON DUCTILE FAILURE

4.1 Introduction

Despite the success of the Gurson model, ever since then many studies have
addressed surpassing some of its limitations. One of them is the restriction about void
morphology, mainly in the isotropic case of a spherical RVE. In this case, the spherical
void is assumed to conserve its morphology throughout the entire deformation process. In
other words, the damage evolution is described only in terms of porosity, which means
that an eventual shape change is not accounted for.

Important contributions to this field have been accomplished by Gologanu, Leblond
and Devaux (1993), Gologanu, Leblond and Devaux (1994) and Gologanu et al. (1997).
They approached the case of spheroidal cavities contained in a confocal spheroidal matrix
and derived its macroscopic yield criterion by assuming special velocity fields which satisfy
homogeneous boundary conditions on the outer surface. These fields were idealized by
making an interesting analogy between the velocity in a point with the electric field on
the same point lead by an electric charge located in the RVE center. After an extensive
mathematical development detailed in their works and important approximations of integral
terms by their respective averages in the RVE domain, they proposed a Gurson-like yield
criterion expression dependent on both porosity and a shape factor so that the spheroidal
void could be defined. Because of its rigorous mathematical aspects, this model is limited
to spheroidal voids (both elongated and flatted ones) aligned to the principal directions of
axisymmetric macroscopic strain rate field. Gologanu et al. (2001) and Gologanu, Leblond
and Devaux (2001) also proposed models for predicting coalescence of initially spherical
voids inside cylindrical RVEs under axisymmetric deformation. These voids then might
evolve and assume an spheroidal shape.

Another group of significant advances to the consideration of void morphology on
ductile rupture of porous materials were developed by Ponte Castañeda and Zaidman
(1994), Ponte Castañeda and Zaidman (1996), Zaidman and Ponte Castañeda (1996),
Kailasam, Aravas and Ponte Castañeda (2000), Aravas and Ponte Castañeda (2004), Danas
and Ponte Castañeda (2009a) and Danas and Ponte Castañeda (2009b). Basically, these
works rely on the estimation of effective properties of nonlinear composite materials (which
in these cases are porous ones) proposed by Ponte Castañeda (1991) and Ponte Castañeda
(1992), which uses an approach based on variational principles to obtain these properties by
a specific comparison with a correlated linear composite, and also Ponte Castañeda (2002a)
and Ponte Castañeda (2002b), which is based on a second-order variational formulation.
The choice of the strain rate field relies on the Eshelby (1957) approach to a problem of an



68 Chapter 4 Effect of porous morphology on ductile failure

inclusion contained in an infinite elastic medium. In order to simulate in an elastic medium
the incompressibility condition of ductile plasticity, they impose the Poisson parameter to
hold ? = 1/2. Although these models comprehend arbitrarily oriented ellipsoidal voids and
consider finite strain formulation, the fact that Elsheby’s microscopic strain rate field is
derived to an infinite elastic media might limit their representativity of plastic materials.

Another important improvement on the Gurson model to account for the growth and
coalescence of spheroidal cavities is provided by Pardoen and Hutchinson (2000). Basically,
they heuristically extended the approaches of Gologanu et al. (1997) for considering
void shapes and Thomason (1993) for taking the onset of coalescence into account. The
important feature of their model is that no phenomenological variables – which are difficult
to determine experimentally – are therein considered. In addition, only one heuristic
parameter q is required, which does not need to be obtained at each analysis, but can be
obtained once and for all by FEM cell calculations. They also compared their heuristic
criterion with several 3D FEM calculations and confirmed the good agreement between
these models.

Monchiet et al. (2006) and Monchiet et al. (2008) extended the models of Gologanu,
Leblond and Devaux (1993) and Gologanu, Leblond and Devaux (1994), by following
similar approximations and assumptions as those works, in order to the material matrix to
follow the anisotropic yield criterion proposed by Hill (1948). Next, Monchiet, Charkaluk
and Kondo (2007) and Monchiet, Charkaluk and Kondo (2011) took the Eshelby (1957)
displacement field for the problem of an inclusion surrounded by an infinite continuum
medium as a trial velocity field to the problem of a hollow spheroidal RVE with perfectly
rigid-plastic material matrix. Since this field is not the exact one to the referred RVE
problem, this approach also constitutes an upper bound. This model was implemented into
a FEM code by Lin et al. (2010) so that notched and round tensile bars could be modeled
in detail. Their results showed the improvement provided by this new trial velocity field.

The class of velocity fields as that used in Gologanu, Leblond and Devaux (1993)
and Gologanu, Leblond and Devaux (1994) was generalized by Leblond and Gologanu
(2008). They found a class of velocity field, related to the problem of a spheroidal RVE with
a confocal spheroidal void, which respects the assumption of uniform (i.e. constant) strain
rate conditions along every confocal spheroid in the RVE domain. Madou and Leblond
(2012a) and Madou and Leblond (2012b) used this velocity field to obtain effective yield
criterion of ductile materials with spheroidal voids by asymptotically expanding the
expressions of the macroscopic plastic dissipation potential and of the effective stress
tensors.

Flandi and Leblond (2005a) and Flandi and Leblond (2005b) proposed a heuristic
expression of the macroscopic gauge function (which is an analogous concept defined by
Leblond, Perrin and Suquet (1994) of yield functions, albeit used in a viscoplastic materials

context) of porous materials containing spheroidal voids. This expression was imposed
to reproduce reference models when particularized to certain cases, as for the perfectly
rigid-plastic case of Gologanu, Leblond and Devaux (1993) and Gologanu, Leblond and
Devaux (1994). The restriction to spheroidal voids and the heuristic character of the gauge
function expression are the drawbacks of this approach, in spite of reasonable agreement
numerical unit cell FEM calculations.

In order to provide a contribution to the study of ductile plasticity, this chapter
presents a Gurson-based approach to obtain an overall yield criterion of anisotropic porous
materials. A spherical RVE containing a centered ellipsoidal void is assumed to represent
orthotropic porous media under a rupture process. The material matrix surrounding the
void is dependent on the third invariant of microscopic stresses, as in Benallal (2017).
The Gurson’s trial velocity field is chosen to approximate the solution of that RVE by an
upper bound. Although only the void morphology is altered in relation to Benallal’s work,
the analytical approach as well as some fundamental definitions have to be generalized
so that the anisotropic effect induced is the void morphology be adequately considered.
The results hereby presented show the consistency of the present formulation and provide
important insights for further investigation.

4.2 A Gurson-like RVE with arbitrary centered void morphology

Aiming to propose an advance on the work by Benallal (2017), let us initially
consider a spherical RVE whose material matrix and boundary conditions follow the
configuration introduced in his work. However, let the centered cavity assume now an
ellipsoidal morphology instead of a spherical one. Figure 17 schematizes an arbitrary

A crucial aspect of the RVE conceived above is that the principal directions of
the applied macroscopic strain rate E? coincide with those of the ellipsoidal porous. This
configuration is in accordance with the results that will be shown in section 4.4. However,
as justified in chapter 7, this restriction is only necessary for visualizing the yield surfaces
in the principal macroscopic stress space and it is not a limitation of the formulation itself.

An RVE with an ellipsoidal cavity, as illustrated in Fig. 17, can be conveniently
described in terms of relative lengths (`1,`2,`3), the porosity f and the external radius R
of the RVE. The advantage of using relative lengths (`1,`2,`3) is that they might represent
only the ratios between the principal radii of the ellipsoid. Thus, this notation briefly
describes how much elongated or flatted an ellipsoid is in each direction (x1,x2,x3). The
principal radii (r1,r2,r3) of the ellipsoid are obtained in terms of (`1,`2,`3), f and R as

ri = `i 3
?

f

`1`2`3
R i = 1, 2, 3. (4.2)



4.3 Deriving the macroscopic yield surface 71

For example, an RVE with (`1,`2,`3) = (1, 4, 8), f = 1% and R = 1 (unitary)
presents an ellipsoidal cavity whose principal radii give r1 ? 0.067860, r2 ? 0.271442 and
r3 ? 0.542884, which satisfies r2/r1 = `2/`1 = 4 and r3/r1 = `3/`1 = 8.

The classical definitions of spheroids (i.e. an ellipsoid whose two of the principal
radii have the same length) are also useful for describing the void morphology. A spheroid
is said to be prolate (oblate) if one principal radius is greater (less) than the other two.
For instance, in terms of relative lengths (`1,`2,`3), a (8, 1, 1) is prolate spheroid and a
(1, 8, 8) is an oblate one.

Finally, each of the principal radii of the ellipsoidal void must be less than the
external radius R so that the cavity is thoroughly contained in the RVE. This condition
in terms of the relative lengths (`1,`2,`3) satisfies

4.3 Deriving the macroscopic yield surface

Since the material matrix defined in the domain ? of the RVE follows the Hershey-
Hosford criterion (Eq. (3.63)) in the same way as that developed in Benallal (2017), the
microscopic plastic dissipation potential ?(E?) holds

?(??) = ??(??eq(??))G(?(??)) =
?0??eq?

[g(w(?))]2 + [g?(w(?))]2
(4.4)

where

and ? ? ?(?) is obtained by a one-dimensional linear interpolation procedure.

A detailed development of Eq. (4.4) is given in chapter 3 in the present document,
as well as in the original work of Benallal (2017).

The macroscopic dissipation potential is then defined as

?(E?) =

and the macroscopic stress tensor ? gives

where V refers to the volume occupied by the sphere ? = {(x1,x2,x3)/x21 + x22 + x23 &amp;lt;b}.

Differently to Benallal (2017), the derivative ??/?E? hereby cannot be developed
only in terms of its invariants E?m, E?eq and ?. Since some anisotropic effect is expected to
be acquired from the potential ?(E?) due to the void morphology, the principal directions
of E? also play a role in Eq. (4.11), as illustrated in Fig. 18 and 19. Thus, it is useful to
treat the macroscopic strain rate tensor E? intrinsically (i.e. as a whole tensor) in the
development of Eq. (4.11), and not separately in terms of its invariants. The derivative
??/?E? is then developed as

One important remark is that the choice of the trial velocity field of Gurson (1977),
given by either Eq. (4.17) or (3.49), is a first attempt with the aim of providing a rigorous
upper bound approximation to the effective criterion. Further developments with more
refined trial velocity fields are previewed in the next steps of the research. For example,
(i) the field proposed by Monchiet and Kondo (2012), which is the exact solution of a
spherical porous RVE whose material matrix obeys the Hill-Schleicher yield criterion; (ii)
the Eshelby (1957) field, in a similar way to Monchiet, Charkaluk and Kondo (2007) and
Monchiet, Charkaluk and Kondo (2011); or even (iii) the class of admissible fields given
by Leblond and Gologanu (2008) for ellipsoidal RVEs containing confocal ellipsoidal voids.
Furthermore, the exact solution of an elastic spherical RVE with a centered spherical
inclusion given by Li, Sauer and Wang (2007) – and applied in homogenization procedures
by Li, Wang and Sauer (2007) – can also be particularized to the condition of Poisson’s
coefficient ? = 1/2 to represent the incompressibility condition, similar to the way Benallal,
Desmorat and Fournage (2014) explored it in part of their work.

4.4 Results and discussion

In order to illustrate the application of the formulation derived in former sections,
several RVEs with different principal radii are hereby considered. The correspondent
macroscopic yield surfaces are obtained from each of the morphologies listed in Tables 1

to 4. These tables contain the relative lengths (`1,`2,`3) and the principal radii (r1,r2,r3)
respectively to each of the ellipsoidal void (including its spherical and spheroidal particu-
larizations) used throughout this section.

A porosity f = 5% is chosen to represent an arbitrary ductile rupture condition
whereby the high deformation fields must lead the microscopical voids to be elongated or
flatted in certain directions. Furthermore, this chosen value of porosity has also shown to
adequately highlight the differences between properties of each morphology considered
here. The other parameters that are assumed are (i) the Hershey-Hosford shape parameter
m = 8, which refers to a FCC material matrix; (ii) the microscopic yield stress ?0 = 1
(unitary) for the sake of simplicity; and (iii) the external radius R = 1 (unitary) of the
RVE.

morphology type concerns elongated voids and is represented by a (4,1,1) prolate spheroid
in Fig. 20. The second one is related to flattened voids, which are represented by an (1,8,8)
oblate spheroid in Fig. 21. Finally, with the aim of representing the class of arbitrary
ellipsoidal voids in Fig. 22, an (1,4,8) ellipsoid is chosen.

As shown in Fig. 20a-22a, the deviatoric planes ?fm = 0 coincide with the respective
isotropic reference. This fact indicates that the present approach is not able to capture
any anisotropic effect for ?fm = 0, regardless the morphology considered. This limitation
arises from the choice of Gurson’s microscopic strain rate field ?? (Eq. (4.17)), since
E?m ? 0 =? ??(E?,r,?,?) = ??(E?) = E??. This means that, for any traceless macroscopic
strain rate E? = E??, the microscopic one ?? is uniform in ?. Hence, the choice of ?? prevents
Eq. (4.11) of obtaining any influence of the void morphology.

The macroscopic yield surfaces in Fig. 20 and 21 suggest that spherical RVEs with
spheroidal voids mechanically behave as transversely isotropic materials. In a similar way,
Fig. 22 indicates the presence of orthotropic symmetries in the macroscopic yield surface
resultant of spherical RVEs with ellipsoidal voids. These observations are in agreement
with geometrical configurations of the RVEs presented in Fig. 17 and put forward the
consistency of the present formulation.

Although the meridional planes in Fig. 20b-22b do not exhibit any significant
discrepancy between different levels of ?, a slight vertical asymmetry might be noticed.
Albeit discreet, this effect illustrates the influence of the anisotropy induced by the void
morphology also on the meridional planes of the macroscopic yield surfaces.

The effects of different elongation aspects and orientations on prolate spheroidal,
oblate spheroidal and ellipsoidal voids are explored in Fig. 23-25, respectively. In each of
these figures, two types of comparisons on the deviatoric plane ?fm = ?m/|?m|max = 0.99
are proposed. The first one investigates the effect of different relative lengths for the same
type of void morphology and porosity. The second one considers three similar voids, whose
each respective triple of relative lengths is a cyclic permutation of three fixed values. These
permutations simulate the effect of rotating the void so that their resultant orientations
are orthogonal to each other.

The elongation of voids in certain directions induced a gain of resistance on those
respective directions, in accordance with Fig. 23a-25a. Since ?fm = 0.99 &gt; 0, it is expected
that this gain of resistance would be noticed predominantly on the positive range of the
axes on the deviatoric plane (i.e. ??i). This fact is also confirmed in Fig. 23a-25a, which
sustain the consistency of the present formulation.

Fig. 23b-25b show that curves related to void orientations that have a relative length
in common for a certain direction coincide on its correspondent axis. This observation
also illustrates the transversely isotropic and orthotropic behaviors that are induced by
spheroidal and ellipsoidal voids, respectively. Moreover, the match of the curves precisely
on the expected axis shows the accuracy and consistency of the present implementation.

4.5 Concluding remarks

This chapter has presented a simple way of treating morphology-induced anisotropy
on ductile porous materials. The choice of Gurson’s trial velocity field and spherical
RVE facilitated the analytical developments and possibly its further implementation
in multiscale FEM codes. However, this choice limited the anisotropic effects to high
triaxialities, which encourages the search for more representative approximations to the
trial velocity field and for alternative approaches of modeling anisotropy in ductile failure.

Although it was not possible to derive a closed-form expression for the yield
criterion, the development of high-performance scientific computing makes multiscale FEM
codes feasible nowadays. Thus, a yield criterion written in an integral form can still be
successfully implemented in FEM codes with the advantage of not penalizing the analytical
development with further simplifications.

The results obtained in the form of macroscopic yield surfaces have shown to be
consistent. Moreover, the identification of transversely isotropic and orthotropy symmetries
in the results related to spheroidal and ellipsoidal voids, respectively, unveiled the accuracy
of the present implementation. However, further work is required to validate the formulation
hereby presented with experimental studies.

This chapter proposes an anisotropic yield criterion for porous ductile materials. The
approach consists of representing the morphological microstructure properties by defining
a spherical RVE containing a centered spherical void. The material matrix surrounding
this void is assumed to be continuous and follows an anisotropic yield criterion proposed
by Karafillis and Boyce (1993). A uniform macroscopic strain rate E? at the external
surface of the RVE and a traction-free prescription are imposed as boundary conditions
to the RVE problem. The classical Gurson’s trial velocity field is chosen to compose
the microscopic strain rate as a first attempt, which approximates the solution to the
RVE mechanical problem and performs a rigorous upper bound solution to it. The effect
of different morphologies of the void is not considered in the following analysis so that
any perceptible effect of anisotropy is due exclusively to the matrix behavior. Numerical
simulations are hereby presented for four different symmetries of porous ductile materials:
Cubic, Transversely Isotropic, Tetragonal and Orthotropic. These results highlight the
consistency of the present approach representing the yield criterion of ductile porous
materials whose microstructures present specific crystal symmetries.

5.1 The concept of an Isotropic Plastic Equivalent material

Classical yield criteria for anisotropic continuum media have been proposed since
Hill (1948), who altered the equivalent stresses of criteria for isotropic criteria (e.g. the
von Mises stress) were modified in a certain mathematical way to insert new material
coefficients to be experimentally determined. Although this class of yield criteria has
been largely used so far in the literature, these approaches usually lack the physical
meaning of each coefficient. Besides, the formulations related to these criteria end up being
considerably more complex than the classical isotropic ones, as well as being particularized
for specific crystal symmetries.

Karafillis and Boyce (1993) proposed a more convenient treatment for formulating
yield criteria for anisotropic continuum media, which is based on the concept of an Isotropic
Plastic Equivalent (IPE) material. This fictitious IPE material is assumed to undergo
auxiliary stress states s?, which are defined by applying a linear transformation L on the
true Cauchy stress tensor ?, Eq. (5.1). Since stress states are mathematically represented
by second-order tensors, the linear transformation L is defined as a fourth-order one.

s? = L : ? (5.1)



84 Chapter 5 Macroscopic yield criteria for porous anisotropic ductile media

The usefulness of the definition of the auxiliary stress tensors relies on the property
that an affine transformation preserves convexity (EGGLESTON, 1958). Following this
property of convex functions, Karafillis and Boyce (1993) realized that the convexity of an
isotropic yield criterion is preserved if its argument, which is a Cauchy true stress tensor ?,
is linearly transformed by the operator L, as in Eq. (5.1). Therefore, since the symmetries
of the operator L might imply a rotation of the principal directions of ?, an anisotropic
yield criterion ? on the variable ? can be defined by an equivalent isotropic one, ?, on
the auxiliary stress tensor s?, as shown in Eq. (5.2). In other words, an anisotropic yield
criterion can be equivalently obtained by using an already known isotropic one, which is
then related to an IPE material.

?(?) = ?(s?) = ?(L : ?) (5.2)

The linear operator L definition requires three general conditions. The first one
arises from guaranteeing the symmetry of both ? and s?, which implies in the so-called
minor symmetry of fourth-order tensors: Lijkl = Ljikl = Ljilk. The second condition
minimizes the number of needed anisotropy coefficients to represent an arbitrary crystal
symmetry and implies the so-called big symmetry of fourth-order tensors: Lijkl = Lklij.
Finally, the last condition is a consequence of the necessity that s? is traceless regardless
of the anisotropy parameters, so that the linear transformation operated by L over ? be
defined in the deviatoric space: Lijkk = 0, where implicit sum applies.

The symmetries hereupon cited allow to represent Eq. (5.1) in Voigt notation (see
Appendix A) by considering a system of six equations, as shown in Eq. (5.3). The stress
tensors ? and s?, as well as the linear operator L? are depicted as (6 × 1) vectors and a
(6 × 6) matrix, respectively. Due to major symmetry of L, L is a symmetric matrix.

In the following sections, the concept of IPE materials is used to formulate
anisotropic yield criterion having as a basis the Hershey-Hosford isotropic function
(Eq.(3.63)). The resultant anisotropic criterion, Eq. (5.6) is then used as the microscopic
yield function of the material matrix surrounding the RVE spherical void.

5.2 A Gurson-like RVE for modeling porous anisotropic media

Although the framework proposed by Karafillis and Boyce (1993) has been widely
and successfully accepted by the literature as an adequate manner to formulate anisotropic
yield criteria, it does not include the effect of porosity in microstructures. This effect,
however, plays an important role on ductile rupture phenomena according to several
experimental studies ((ARGON; IM; SAFOGLU, 1975), (ARGON; IM, 1975), (ARGON,
1976), (ROZOVSKY; HAHN; AVITZUR, 1973), (BEREMIN, 1981)).

In order to overcome this drawback, the present work proposes an approach for
considering the effect of porosity on ductile rupture modeling. For this purpose, a spherical
RVE containing a centered and also spherical void is assumed to represent the porosity
contained in the microstructure of an arbitrary ductile material. The material matrix
surrounding the spherical void is then assumed to follow the yield criterion of Eq. (5.6).
Since only centered spherical voids are hereby considered, any noticeable anisotropic
behavior is certainly due to the yield criterion of the material matrix. An illustration of
the RVE conception is put forward in Fig. 26.

criterion. Source: the author.

The material matrix contained in the domain ? is assumed to be continuous
and to follow the plastic model described in Eq. (5.7), which corresponds to (a) the
yield criterion, (b) the associated flow rule, (c) the consistency condition and (d) the
irreversibility condition.

The attachment between the RVE and its microscopic vicinities is approximated
by the prescription of a uniform macroscopic strain rate E?, described in Eq. (3.28), in
??+ (see Fig. 26). Furthermore, the inner surface (???) of the RVE is assumed to be
traction-free. Eq. (5.8) summarizes these last boundary conditions below:

u? = E?x ?x on ??+, (5.8a)
?n(x) = 0 ?x on ???, (5.8b)

where n(x) is the normal vector to the inner surface ??? and ? is the resultant macro-
scopic stress tensor.

As will be discussed later on, the solution of the problem defined by the RVE
that undergoes the hereupon conditions is approximated in the sense of Gurson (1977).



5.2 A Gurson-like RVE for modeling porous anisotropic media 87

According to this work, a convenient upper bound approach consists of taking a trial
velocity field u?G(x), for x ? ?, as the solution to the RVE problem. This trial velocity field
is kinematically admissible (i.e., it matches external boundary conditions: u?G(x) = E?x,
for x ? ??+) and finally gives rise to the classical Gurson’s trial strain rate field ??G, as in
Eq. (5.9).

??G(E?,r,?,?) = E?? + E?m
(
R

r

)3
(1 ? 3er(?,?) ?er(?,?)) (5.9)

where r, ? and ? are respectively the radius, the polar angle and the azimuthal angle
associated to the spherical coordinate system, as illustrated in Fig. 10.

It is important to highlight that the choice of the trial velocity field of Gurson
(1977) consists of a first attempt to obtain an upper bound approximation to the effective
criterion. More refined trial velocity fields are required in the next steps of research. For
instance, the field proposed by Monchiet and Kondo (2012), which is the exact solution of
a spherical porous RVE whose material matrix obeys the Hill-Schleicher yield criterion
can be particularized to a RVE whose matrix follows an incompressible plastic flow rule.
Additionally, the exact solution of an elastic spherical RVE with a centered and also
spherical inclusion given by Li, Sauer and Wang (2007) may be particularized to the
condition of Poisson’s coefficient ? = 1/2 – to represent the incompressibility condition
– and to the case where the inclusion offers no stiffness to the RVE – to consider a void
instead of an inclusion.

In the sense of Karafillis and Boyce (1993), a trial strain rate field associated to the
concept of an IPE material can be deduced by combining both normality rules concerning
the actual strain rate ?? = ????/?? and ??? = ??/?s? with Eq. (5.1), as in Eq. (5.10).

??? = ??
??

?s?
= ??

??

??
:
??

?s?
= ?? : L+ (5.10)

where L+ represents the inverse of the fourth-order tensor L with respect to the deviatoric
space.

Thus, the trial velocity field ???(E??,r,??) concerning the IPE material in the RVE
domain ? is then defined as

???(E?,r,??) = ?? : L+ = E?? : L+ + E?m
(
R

r

)3
(1 ? 3er(?,?) ?er(?,?)) : L+ (5.11)

In an equivalent manner, a macroscopic IPE material is conveniently idealized. For
this purpose, a macroscopic IPE strain rate field is defined as

E?? = E?? : L+ + E?m1. (5.12)



88 Chapter 5 Macroscopic yield criteria for porous anisotropic ductile media

This definition operates a linear transformation only over the deviator E??, while the
hydrostatic parcel E?m1 is taken without any changes.

Regarding E??, its deviatoric parcel E???, Lode angle ??, equivalent measure E?eq and

5.3 Deduction of the macroscopic dissipation potential

The microscopic plastic dissipation potential ? associated to a point in RVE domain
? whose plastic laws hold Eq. (5.7) is defined in Eq. (5.17). It can be defined as a function
of the incompressible (i.e. Tr ?? = 0) microscopic strain rate field ?? as

?(??) = sup
???
{? : ??} (5.17)

where ? = {?|?(?) = ?(s?) ? ?0} is a convex set of stress tensors ?.

Considering the normality rule for the flow of the microscopic plastic strain rate
?? = ????/?? and the fact that the yield function ?(?) is a homogeneous function of
degree one, Eq. (5.17) can be rewritten as

?(??) = ? :
(
??
??

??

)
= ??? :

??

??
= ???(?) = ???0, (5.18)

An IPE microscopic strain rate ??? as in Eq. (5.11) can be obtained by exploring
the normality flow rule by doing

where

?s?
= ?? : L+. (5.20)

At this point, one assumes that L has an inverse L+. Because Lijkk = 0 (pressure
independence condition), its inverse L+ satisfies L : L+ = J, where J is the deviatoric
fourth-order identity defined in Eq. (4.19).

The plastic multiplier rate ?? is obtained as a function of the IPE microscopic strain
rate ??? by considering its definition in Eq. (5.20) as

Since the present work relies on the prescription of a chosen trial strain rate field ???

to perform an upper bound approach, the expression of ? must be dependent only on ???.
However, Eq. (5.32) states that the function G(??) still has the microscopic stress Lode
angle as an argument. The following paragraphs of this section show that, in fact, ?? can
be obtained from a prescribed ???.

The definition of the microscopic strain Lode angle ?? combined to the normality

A full algebraic simplification procedure allows finally directly relates ?? to ?? in
Eq. (5.36). It is important to remark that, albeit the particularization of ?(s?) in Eq.
(5.23), the following relation is defined for an arbitrary function g(??) which satisfies the
convexity condition in a polar coordinate system g(??) + g??(??) ? 0.

?? = ?? + arctan

(5.36)

Although there is no explicit inverse relation of Eq. (5.36), a one-dimensional
interpolation approximates a function ?? ? ??(??). Consequently, the microscopic stress

The fact that both Eq. (5.45) and (5.46) do not involve any integral turns these
expressions into a very convenient way for obtaining deviatoric curves on ?-plane (i.e.
{?/?m(?) = 0}). Thus, these curves can be produced with a minimal computational

? is directly dependent only on the IPE macroscopic Lode angle

5.5 Results and discussion

In order to illustrate the ideas provided in the former subsections, macroscopic
yield surfaces are obtained for four different microscopic material symmetries: Cubic (C),
Transversely Isotropic (TI), Tetragonal (T) and Orthotropic (O). Each of these symmetries
is related to specific dependency between coefficients in the tensor L, represented in Voigt
notation in Eq. (5.4). These restrictions are schematized in Fig. 27 and were adapted from
Royer and Dieulesaint (2000a), Royer and Dieulesaint (2000b), Canova et al. (1985) and
Cowin (2013) in order to respect Eq. (5.5) as well. The chosen coefficients of L for each of
those symmetries (C, TI, T and O), additionally to the isotropic one (I), are summarized in
Table 5. These coefficients were picked only for academic purposes. Additionally, Karafillis
and Boyce (1993) proposed a experimental procedure to identify these coefficients only for
a given continuum material. Thus, further work must be devoted in order to propose an
experimental method to determine the coefficients of L for a porous ductile material.

The five anisotropy symmetries used in this section are illustrated here (including isotropy) by
general schemes of L on its irreducible forms. The squares represent components that must be
prescribed in order to define the linear transformation L. The triangles refer to components that
are calculated by using the pressure independence condition described in Eq. (5.5). Every matrix
depicted hereby is symmetric. The number of parameters required to define L for each symmetry
is at the right-bottom corner of their respective matrices (except for isotropy, which requires
only one parameter). Source: the author.

Every analysis thereafter represents an anisotropic porous material in a ductile
fracture regime. Thus, a porosity f = 1% and a Hershey-Hosford shape parameter m = 8
are chosen to simulate this condition for an FCC material matrix. For sake of simplicity,
the microscopic yield stress ?0 = 1, which does not affect any of the further overall results
nor conceptual discussions.



5.5 Results and discussion 95

The coefficient C in Eq. (5.4) is chosen so that it satisfies ||
(
L+

)
|| = ||J|| for every

considered symmetry. This assumption assures that none of the discrepancy between the
isotropic reference (I) and the anisotropic yield surfaces is due to any uniform scale factor.
Hence, only the relation between the Lkk coefficients, k = 1, .., 6, affects the anisotropic
curves throughout this section.

Figures 28–31 present both (a) deviatoric and (b) meridional planes of macroscopic
yield surfaces for the cubic (C1), transversely isotropic (TI3), tetragonal (T1) and or-
thotropic (O1) symmetries, respectively. The overall macroscopic behavior matches the
microscopic symmetries prescribed for material matrices. For example, while the deviatoric
planes shown in Fig. 28a for a cubic material matrix (C1) do not present any relative
rotation when compared to the isotropic reference (I), Fig. 29a exhibits a significant one.
This rotation effect is due to the difference between the coefficients L11, L22 and L33, which
privileges the directions 11 and 22 with more rigidity (i.e. for a specific direction, the
rigidity and the Lkk coefficients are inversely proportional to each other).

The influence of decreasing symmetry planes (i.e. the increasing anisotropy effect)
can be noticed by the increasing discrepancy between meridional planes in Figures 28b,
29b, 30b and 31b. For instance, the effect of different coefficients in the linear operator
L in Eq. (5.4) for the orthotropic material matrix (O1) induced the macroscopic yield
surface to distinguish its meridional planes for different macroscopic stress Lode angles ?.
In the context of the present work, this outcome can be seen as a secondary indicator of
the number of symmetry planes for a certain anisotropic matrix.

The analytical predictions described for E?m ? ? in Eq. (5.45) and (5.46) are
compared to the numerical results in Figures 28a, 29a, 30a and 31a. They exactly match
the deviatoric planes related to a level of ?fm = 0, which indicates the consistency between
the analytical formulation and the computational implementation.

In order to evaluate the influence of different intensities of coefficients for the
same material symmetry, Fig. 32 shows the deviatoric planes for the almost hydrostatic
level ?fm = 0.99 related to two macroscopic yield symmetries obtained for two different
cubic material matrices (C1 and C2). These results confirm the consistency of the present
formulation by providing the same of number symmetry pattern in each curve. In addition,
the more different coefficients of the linear operator L are from the isotropic coefficients,
the more further away the anisotropic curves (C1 and C2) are from the isotropic reference.

Analogously, Fig. 33 exhibits macroscopic deviatoric planes for the level ?fm = 0.99
related to three transversely isotropic material matrices (TI1, TI2, TI3). Because of the
permutation of their anisotropy coefficients (see Table 5), TI1, TI2 and TI3 represent
anisotropy frames that are orthogonal to each other. This orthogonality is corroborated by
the matching of the curves TI1, TI2 and TI3 in specific points on the deviatoric plane. For
example, the curves TI1 and TI2 coincide on the axis ??1, which is referred to the direction

5.6 Concluding remarks 99

5.6 Concluding remarks

This chapter proposed a formulation to represent yield criteria for anisotropic
porous media based on i) the concept of an IPE material introduced by Karafillis and
Boyce (1993) to model anisotropy of continuum media and ii) the framework put forward
by Gurson (1977) to model ductile porous materials.

The numerical results showed the consistency and robustness, in the sense of the
applicability of the formulation for a wide range of conditions, of the formulation for four
different symmetries. The results were limited to cases which there was coincidence between
the principal directions of macroscopic strain rate and the anisotropic referential due to the
extreme computational cost of performing 6-dimensional contour plots for visualizations.
Nonetheless, the formulation itself considers arbitrary anisotropic symmetries and can be
implemented in general multiscale FEM codes.

The results also revealed that the macroscopic yield criteria preserved the overall
symmetries of the RVE material matrix. This fact is due to the spherical shape of the cavity
inside the RVE. However, further works can properly combine the anisotropy provided by
the material matrix with that acquired from the morphological effects.

The trial velocity field proposed by Gurson (1977) proved to be an adequate choice
for the developments hereby. However, further works may also explore more elaborate trial
fields in order to obtain better upper bounds to the RVE problem.

6 MODELING OF ORTHOTROPIC RUPTURE OF POROUS ALUMINUM AL-
LOYS

This chapter presents an approach for modeling anisotropic rupture of porous
aluminum alloys. This approach consists of deriving the macroscopic yield surface of a
Gurson-like RVE whose material matrix follows the Yld2004-18p yield criterion proposed
by Barlat et al. (2005). The RVE is assumed to undergo uniform macroscopic strain
rates and the correspondent dissipation potentials are obtained by using Gurson’s trial
microscopic velocity field as a first attempt, which composes an upper bound procedure.
The results point out the consistency of including the porosity parameter on the modeling
of rupture in orthotropic aluminum alloys, as well as the need to account for the porosity
effect on the resultant macroscopic yield surfaces.

6.1 The Barlat et al. (2005) Yld2004-18p yield criterion

Although Karafillis and Boyce (1993) have formulated a convenient way to represent
anisotropic yield surfaces by the concept of IPE material, their approach did not match
experimental results of aluminum sheet forming Barlat et al. (2003). In order to overcome
this drawback, Barlat et al. (2003) proposed an anisotropic yield function by applying two
linear different transformations over a sum of two distinct yield functions. This method
doubled the number of material parameters to be experimentally identified, which thus
increased the accuracy in representing aluminum alloys. Banabic et al. (2005) also proposed
anisotropic yield function based on an extension of Barlat and Lian (1989) model in order
to include more material parameters. However, these approaches were restricted to plane
stress formulation.

Barlat et al. (2005) then suggested a consistent manner to derive an anisotropic
yield surface with more material parameters than Karafillis and Boyce (1993), also based
on linear transformations (Eq. (6.2)), which is thus applicable to 3D full stress states.
Their framework uses an arbitrary number of linear transformations instead of only one as
in Karafillis and Boyce (1993). However, the more linear transformations are considered,
the more material coefficients need to be experimentally identified.

Although their formulation is consistent with an arbitrary number of linear transfor-
mations, Barlat et al. (2005) restricts their results and formulae to only two. These linear
transformations are then applied to the Cauchy stress tensor ?, defining two auxiliary
traceless stress tensors s1 and s2.The linearly transformed stress tensors s1 and s2 are

4th-order tensors Ci, Li and J, respectively, with J given by Eq. (4.19). The superscript i
in Eq. (6.2) refers to the i-th linear transformation, i = 1, 2.

In accordance with their approach, an anisotropic yield criterion was derived by
writing an isotropic convex function in terms of the transformed stress tensors s1 and
s2. According to Eggleston (1958), a convexity of a function is preserved if its arguments
are transformed by affine operators. This guarantees the convexity of the resultant yield
function ? (s1,s2), Eq. (6.3). Because two linear transformations are involved, this approach
can give rise to criteria that can take into account up to 18 parameters of anisotropy.

6.2 A Gurson-like RVE for modeling porous aluminum alloys

In the same sense of the approach in the last chapter, a modification of the Gurson’s
RVE is hereby proposed in order to consider the anisotropic behavior of the material
matrix, as shown in Fig. 34. The microscopic yield criterion of the material portion ?
surrounding the void is then assumed to behave as the Yld2004-18p criterion proposed by
Barlat et al. (2005). Although different void morphologies could be also explored within
the following formulation, the present work is restricted to centered spherical cavities so
that whatever anisotropic effect is due to the material matrix yield criterion.

In accordance with chapters 3, 4 and 5, the trial strain rate field ??G proposed by
Gurson (1977) is still chosen as an approximation to the analytically exact ?? strain rate
field. This approach consists of an upper bound solution to the BVP posed by the hollow
spherical RVE, subjected to a macroscopic strain field E? on ??+, whose material matrix
follows an incompressible rigid-perfect plasticity model (i.e. Yld2004-18p, normality rule
and no hardening). Nonetheless, it is important to remark that more refined trial strain
rate fields will be considered in future work. As already commented in chapter 4 and
chapter 5, the fields provided by Monchiet and Kondo (2012) and by Li, Sauer and Wang
(2007) are believed to result in better upper bound estimates.

6.3 Deduction of the macroscopic dissipation potential

The microscopic plastic dissipation potential ? associated to a point in RVE domain
? whose plastic laws satisfy Eq. (5.7) is defined in Eq. (5.17). It can be defined as a
function of the traceless (i.e. Tr ?? = 0) microscopic strain rate field ?? as

?(??) = sup
???
{? : ??} (6.6)

where ? = {?|?(?) = ?(s1,s2) ? ?0} is a convex set of stress tensors ?.

Taking into account the normality rule for the flow of the microscopic plastic strain
rate ?? = ????/?? and recalling that the yield function ?(?) is a homogeneous function of
degree one, Eq. (5.18) is hereby reproduced for the sake of completeness:

Although the linear operator L is represented by a rectangular 12 × 6 matrix in

Penrose generalized inversion procedure, which may generate infinite possible solutions to
this problem. The choice of this inverse matrix for numerical implementation is discussed
in section 6.5. By now, it is sufficient to assume that this inversion is possible and that it

The yield function ? shows to be a function on five independent variables (s1eq,s2eq,?1,?2,?).
It is convenient to deal with this formula as being a product of two independent functions:
s?eq(s1eq,s2eq) and g(?1,?2,?), as expressed in Eq. (6.15). Therefore, the derivative of the

The complete expressions of the derivatives contained in Eq. (6.16) are detailed in

sake of clarity, the microscopic plastic dissipation potential ? is written concisely as

Although the dependency of the microscopic dissipation potential ? on the micro-
scopic equivalent stresses s1eq and s2eq has been eliminated, Eq. (6.17) still hinges on three
stress variables: the microscopic stress Lode angles ?1 and ?2 and the auxiliary stress
angle ?. The following subsection links these three stress variables with those analogous
ones of strain rates ??1 and ??2.

6.3.2 Relations between the microscopic stress angles (?1, ?2, ?) and microscopic strain
rate angles (?1, ?2, ?)

In a similar way to the definition of the strain Lode angles which has been used so
far in the present work, Eq. (6.20) puts forward the definitions of the Lode angles ?1 and

(6.21)

A full simplification of the Eq. (6.21) through the expressions of ??/?s1 and ??/?s2

given in Appendix C gives rise to the relation between the strain rate angles (?1, ?2, ?)



110 Chapter 6 Modeling of orthotropic rupture of porous aluminum alloys

Although there is no explicit way to invert these relations in order to express the
stress angles as functions of the strain rate angles, this can be accomplished numerically
by a 4-dimensional interpolation technique (i.e. interpolation of functions whose domain is
defined in a three-dimensional euclidian space). A procedure for interpolating a structured
n-dimensional set of points is proposed in Appendix B and allows to approximate the
relation between the stress angles (?1, ?2, ?) and strain rate angles (?1, ?2, ?):

?1 ? ?1(?1,?2,?)
?2 ? ?2(?1,?2,?)
? ? ?(?1,?2,?).

(6.23)

6.3.3 Defining a microscopic plastic dissipation potential dependent only on the micro-
scopic strain rates

Once the dependency of the microscopic plastic dissipation potential ? on the
stress variables s1eq and s2eq has been eliminated and a numerical relation between the
stress angles (?1, ?2, ?) and strain rate angles (?1, ?2, ?) has been presented in the last
subsections, ? can now be rewritten as a function solely on the strain rate variables, as
shown in Eq. (6.24).

?

(??1eq)2 + (??2eq)2?

where g = g(?1,?2,?), g1 = g1(?1,?2,?), g2 = g2(?1,?2,?), g? = g?(?1,?2,?). Besides,
in accordance with Eq. (6.23), ?1 ? ?1(?1,?2,?), ?2 ? ?2(?1,?2,?) and ? ? ?(?1,?2,?).



6.4 Deriving the macroscopic yield surface 111

Finally, ?(??1eq, ??2eq,?1,?2,?) is rewritten in Eq. (6.25) in an alternative form as a
product of two different functions ??(??1eq, ??2eq) and G(?1,?2,?), which are defined in Eq.
(6.26).

?(??1eq, ??

1,?2,?) = ??(??1eq, ??

where

G(?1,?2,?) =

g2 + g2? + (g1 sec ?)2 + (g2 csc ?)2

(6.26)

6.4 Deriving the macroscopic yield surface

The macroscopic plastic dissipation potential ?(E?) is still defined as the average
value of the microscopic one, ?(??1eq, ??2eq,?1,?2,?) over the volume occupied by the RVE, as
presented in the chapters 3, 4 and 5. However, the derivation of the macroscopic stress
tensors now requires a more complex approach, since the microscopic plastic dissipation
potential ? is now dependent on five independent variables instead of only two, as within
the formulation for a macroscopic yield criterion based on the model by Karafillis and
Boyce (1993) for the material matrix (see Eq. (5.39)). Eq. (6.27) describes the general
expression for deriving the macroscopic stress tensors ? as a first derivative of ?(E?) with
respect to E?.

Equations (6.28) and (6.29) exhibit the general approach for evaluating the deriva-
tives in Eq. (6.27). Due to the number of variables which ?? and G are dependent on, their
derivatives with respect to the macroscopic strain rate E? are described here in a adapted
matrix notation. Each matrix or vector component shown below does not necessarily
represent a scalar value: they might also symbolize either a second-order tensor or even a

Equation (6.30) is equivalently rewritten following Voigt notations (see Appendix A)

Lijkl = Ljilk, respectively):

||??1|| and ??2eq =

||??2||.

Since the macroscopic plastic dissipation potential ? gives better upper bound
estimates for lower values of dissipation (according to the kinematic theorem of Limit
Analysis), the choice of the inverse of the matrix L is made by keeping this fact in mind.
Thus, the problem of finding a proper inverse of L can be defined as a minimization of an
auxiliary function

where ? ? R|? &gt; 0.

According to Ben-Israel and Greville (2003), the function F is minimized uniquely
by

??
? ??

1

??2

??
? = (LaL + ?2I)?1La??, (6.34)

where La is the conjugate transpose matrix of L and ||{??1 ??2}T || monotonically decreases
with decreasing ?.

Following Ben-Israel and Greville (2003),

lim
??0

(LaL + ?2I)?1La = L+, (6.35)

where L+ ? M(n,m) is the Moore-Penrose unique inverse of the matrix L ? M(m,n) that
respects the following properties defined by Penrose and Todd (1956):

L L+ L = L, (6.36)
L+ L+ L+ = L+, (6.37)
(L L+)a = L L+, and (6.38)
(L+ L)a = L+ L. (6.39)

The Moore-Penrose inverse L+ can be obtained by the Single Value Decomposition
(SVD) procedure – among others (see Ben-Israel and Greville (2003) and Campbell and
Meyer (2009)) – by decomposing the original matrix L as

L = U LS V
?, (6.40)



114 Chapter 6 Modeling of orthotropic rupture of porous aluminum alloys

where U is a m×m unitary matrix, L is a m×n matrix, V ? is a n×n unitary matrix,
LS is a matrix whose diagonal components are nonnegative, while its other components
are zero, and

L+ = U L+S V
?, (6.41)

where L+S is obtained by replacing each nonzero diagonal component of LS by its cor-
respondent reciprocal value. Additionally, in the particular case of the present chapter,
m = 12 and n = 6.

Accordingly, the relation in Eq. (6.31) can be thus inverted as in Eq. (6.42) so that
the norm ||{??1 ??2}||T is minimized:

??
? ??

1

??2

??
? = L+?? (6.42)

Although the solution of Eq. (6.42) minimizes both F and ||??1??2T ||, it does not
necessarily minimizes the microscopic plastic dissipation of ?(??1, ??2) in Eq. (6.32) – it only
minimizes its numerator. The denominator, which is a function of the microscopic strain
rate Lode angles ?1 and ?2 as well as of the auxiliary angle ? = ??2eq/??1eq, is a much more
complex function to be optimized. Therefore, the choice of an inverse for the rectangular
matrix L consists in an additional upper bound approximation.

The inverses
(
L+

and

(

are finally obtained by separating the 12×6 matrix

L+ into two 6 × 6 blocks:

Coherently to the previous chapters in the present text and to section 6.2, ?? is
approximated by the trial microscopic strain rate ??G(E?) proposed by Gurson (1977). This
choice consists of a rigorous upper bound approach for the minimization problem of the
macroscopic plastic dissipation potential ?(E?), and leads to the following implementation
of ??1 and ??2:

??1(E?) =
(
L+

??G(E?)

??2(E?) =
(

??G(E?).

It is important to recall one more time that further developments concerning this
research will consider more refined trial velocity fields, as those of Monchiet, Charkaluk



6.6 Results and discussion 115

and Kondo (2007), Monchiet, Charkaluk and Kondo (2011), Monchiet and Kondo (2012)
and Li, Sauer and Wang (2007).

Recalling that E? is fully determined by the prescription of both normalized macro-
scopic strain triaxiality H and Lode angle ? (Eq. (3.28)), each point of the macroscopic
yield surface in the space of macroscopic stresses is related to a pair (H,?). Hence, one
must evaluate Eq. (6.27) for as many pairs (H,?) as possible in their respective domains so
that the points comprehend the entire macroscopic yield surface. Due to the computational
cost of each integration in Eq. (6.27), only a reduced set of ? is calculated for each
macroscopic yield surface, which is thus correspondent to the prescribed set of pairs (H,?).
Further details of these discretizations are given in section 7.2.

Along the same lines as the previous chapters, although the implementation is
not restricted to the coincidence between the principal directions of the material matrix
symmetry and the macroscopic strain rate E?, the graphical visualization based on contour
level plots of the macroscopic yield surfaces is. This limitation derives from the fact that if
there is no coincidence between those principal directions, each point of that surface would
be defined in a 6-dimensional space, since the shear components of stress would not result
in zero. Thus, a contour level plot for 6-dimensional would be required, which implies an
extreme computational cost. Nevertheless, an N-dimensional contour plot procedure is
proposed in Appendix B for further developments in high performance computing.

6.6 Results and discussion

Following the formulation detailed in previous sections, two macroscopic yield
surfaces are obtained by modeling a Gurson-like RVE whose material matrix follows the
Yld2004-18p yield criterion. They are intended to insert the porosity effect in the yield
surfaces of 6111-T4 and 2090-T3 aluminum alloys presented by Barlat et al. (2005). The
material matrix coefficients of the RVE are assumed to be those identified by Barlat et
al. (2005) and listed in Table 6. The shape parameter of the Hershey-Hosford equation is
chosen to be m = 8, which is in correspondence to a FCC crystal structure. A porosity of
1% is chosen to represent a critical value for general ductile fracture configurations, as
indicated by Benzerga, Besson and Pineau (1999). According to section 6.2, only centered
spherical voids are hereby considered so that every noticeable anisotropic behavior is due
to the material matrix model.

Figures 35 and 36 respectively compare the anisotropic macroscopic yield surface
of a porous 6111-T4 and 2090-T3 aluminum alloy to a porous isotropic reference. In
accordance with the material matrix behaviors, the macroscopic yield surfaces for 6111-T4
(B1) and 2090-T3 (B2) present a mildly and strongly anisotropic behavior, respectively.
Figures 35a and 36a compares the macroscopic yield surfaces (B1 and B2) to an isotropic



116 Chapter 6 Modeling of orthotropic rupture of porous aluminum alloys

reference (I). Although Fig. 35b and 36b do not contain the isotropic reference, a more
significant effect of anisotropy can be noticed by the discrepancy between meridional planes
related to different macroscopic stress Lode angles ?. Both deviatoric and meridional planes
match the expectations about the intensity of the anisotropic effect of the microscopic
yield criterion on the overall behavior.

simplicity. Source: the author.

In the deviatoric planes in Fig. 35a and Fig. 36a, the misalignment of the anisotropic
curves naturally becomes more significant as the macroscopic hydrostatic stress ?m
increases. Although it cannot be analytically shown for the formulation in this chapter
due to the complexity of Eq. (6.27), this effect is believed to be analogous to the one
observed in section 5.5, where it has been demonstrated that once the macroscopic IPE
stress ??? was proved to be centered on the deviatoric plane related to ?m = 0, the linear
transformation ?? = L+ : ?? could not result in a misaligned ?? for ?m = 0.

A stronger anisotropic effect might also be noticed in Fig. 36b in comparison with
Fig. 35b, since discrepancies between meridional planes related to different macroscopic
stress Lode angles ? are more marked in the first than in the last one. Furthermore, the
meridional planes are not expected to be asymmetric, since the i) function g(?1,?2 ?) is
symmetric with respect to ?1 and ?2 (i.e. g(?1,?2,?) = g(??1,?2,?) = g(?1,??2,?));
ii) the trial strain rate fields ??1 and ??2 are symmetrically distributed inside the domain
? of the RVE (see Fig. 34); and iii) the void shape shares symmetric planes with the
material anisotropy.

In order to verify the consistency of the present formulation, Fig. 37 compares
the deviatoric planes related to ?m = 0 for the 6111-T4 and 2090-T3 porous aluminum
alloys with the correspondent ones with no porosity (i.e. f = 0). The yield surface of the
nonporous models are multiplied here by a scalar factor of (1?f), so that the amplification
effect due to the porosity could be negligible.

Both Fig. 37a and 37b show that the combination of two linear transformations
on the microscopic stress tensor carried out throughout the formulation proposed in this
chapter alters the general aspect of the macroscopic yield surfaces slightly. Hence, the
outcome of inserting the porosity effect in the Yld2004-18p criterion proposed by Barlat
et al. (2005) is a change in the overall shape of the yield function, even in the contour
level of ?m = 0, which has preserved its form in the last two other approaches presented
in chapter 4 and chapter 5.

6.7 Concluding remarks

The formulation proposed in this chapter has revealed to be a consistent way of
inserting the porosity effect in the yield criterion Yld2004-18p proposed by Barlat et al.
(2005). Furthermore, the macroscopic yield surfaces obtained hereupon are in accordance
with convexity requirements for general yield criteria for ductile media.

Differently from the results shown in chapter 5, there was a slight discrepancy

between the deviatoric planes for ?m = 0 of the macroscopic yield surface and the
microscopic one. This difference is believed to be due to the effect of applying two linear
transformations instead of just one in the RVE general formulation, even though it was
not possible to demonstrate it analytically.

Finally, although the overall results have shown to be in accordance with the
expectations, the next steps of research must consist of (i) using more refined trial velocity
fields with the aim of obtaining better upper bound approximations; and (ii) further
experimental works to properly validate the approach presented hereby: differently to
those tests made by Barlat et al. (2005), the porosity must also be controlled over the
course of experiments from now on.

7 SOME ASPECTS ON THE NUMERICAL IMPLEMENTATION

7.1 Numerical integration

The linearization of the microscopic plastic dissipation potential ?(??G) (Eq. (3.51))
in the original Gurson (1975) model allowed the macroscopic stress state to be obtained
analytically, since the volume integral in Eq. (3.51) – and implicitly in Eq. (3.52) – could
be solved analytically. However, the anisotropic extensions proposed in chapter 4, chapter 5
and chapter 6 require the macroscopic stress tensors ? = ??/?E? to be numerically
obtained (i.e. by using some approximation technique). Thus, a numerical integration
procedure based on the Gauss quadrature was implemented to solve integrals in the form

? =
1
V

?
?

The spherical shape of the RVEs suggests that a spherical coordinate system (Fig.

Although a spherical coordinate system is convenient for evaluating a certain
function at a point in the RVE domain, the referential frame associated to that point is
also dependent on the point position. This means that, during a numerical integration
procedure of Eq. (7.2), each elementary parcel of the macroscopic stress tensor ? would be
calculated for a different referential frame. Therefore, the integrand function (i.e. ??/?E?

The void radius rv = rv(?,?) is assumed to be dependent on the angles ? and
? because of the possibility of it being an ellipsoid, as in chapter 4. However, for the
subsequent chapter 5 and chapter 6, the void is assumed to be spherical and hence the
void radius is constant.

The results provided in chapter 4, chapter 5 and chapter 6 were obtained by using
Gauss quadrature of (N1,N2,N3) = (40, 40, 40) integration points. However, the isotropic

results obtained to illustrate Benallal, Desmorat and Fournage (2014) and Benallal (2017)
models required only (N1,N2,N3) = (15, 15, 15) points to be accurately integrated –
403/153 ? 28402, which has a strong impact on the computational cost.

7.2 Discretization of the ? and H subspaces

The trial strain rate field ??G(r,?,?) in Eq. (3.49) is also a function of two macro-
scopic strain rate invariants: E?m (or H) and ?. This means that ??G not only varies in
the space (i.e. in the RVE domain), but also following two additional variables (H,?).
Moreover, the numerical integration framework given by Eq. (7.11) is related to only a
given pair (H,?), which are purposely implicit in that equation. Therefore, the integration
in Eq. (7.11) results in solely one stress tensor – i.e. one point on the macroscopic yield
surface. In order to obtain the whole surface, the invariants (H,?) of E? must be treated
also as variables and thus require a discretization.

According to the definition of the macroscopic strain rate triaxiality (Eq. (3.33)),
H ? [??,?]. Therefore, its discretization cannot be effectively performed, since it is an
unbounded domain. To address this issue, a change of variables is hereby proposed. This
change does not affect the formulation itself – neither destroys the conceptual meaning of
the triaxiality. The advantage of that change of variables is that the idealized triaxiality
variable H? ? [?1/

?

3]. Thus, a traditional discretization procedure can be applied.
The new strain rate triaxiality variable is

It is important to remark that due to the perfectly rigid-plastic material matrix of
the RVE and to the small strains theory used throughout this formulation, the resultant
macroscopic stress tensor ? given in Eq. (7.11) is independent on the intensity of E?
(i.e. on the norm ||E?||). Therefore, ? depends only on the directions of E?, given by its
triaxiality H and Lode angle ?. An auxiliary macroscopic strain rate E? can then be defined

where e?(?) is the unitary deviatoric strain tensor given by Eq. (3.32).

A generalization of the macroscopic strain rate Lode angle ? is also hereby proposed
for convenience. Because the classical definition of the Lode angle in Eq. (3.34), ? ? [0,?/3]
so that the ordination E?1 ? E?2 ? E?3, with E?1 &gt; E?3, can be respected. This is particularly
inconvenient for the anisotropic analyses treated hereby in which the principal directions
of E? coincide with the material referential frame (x1,x2,x3). In these analyses, full yield
surfaces (i.e. including cases where the stress ordination is not respected) can be obtained
only by extending the range of the Lode angle (both ? and ?) to [0, 2?]. This extension
avoids the need to account for permutations of the principal directions that are required
to obtain full (i.e. closed, not limited to the sector ?1 ? ?2 ? ?3, ?1 &gt; ?3) yield surfaces.
An illustration of the extended Lode angle ?? is provided in Fig. 38. This angle can be
defined as

sign = ?1 k = 3 forE?1 ? E?3 ? E?2, E?1 &gt; E?2. (7.23f)

Although specific anisotropy symmetries implies their respective yield surfaces to
present certain symmetry planes as well, as shown by Canova et al. (1985), the results
hereby presented were obtained by varying the macroscopic strain rate parameters in
their whole range: H? ? [?1/

?
3, 1/
?

3] and ?? ? [0, 2?]. Two numerical criteria were then
implemented to discretize those variables.

Basically, the Lode angle ?? is uniformly divided in the range [0, 2?] in N?? points.
Differently, the triaxiality H? is divided by following a heuristic criterion so that the stress
points on meridional planes could be as equally spaced as possible for a fixed number of
points NH?. This criterion uses the analytical expressions Eq. (3.54), provided by Gurson
(1975), to calculate the values of H? for which the macroscopic stress points (?Gm,?Geq)

obtained by the original Gurson (1975) model can be equally spaced. That discretization
of H? is thus assumed to be a reasonable estimate for the optimum set of triaxialities that
should imply equally spaced (?m,?eq) in macroscopic meridional planes.

The results presented in chapter 4, chapter 5 and chapter 6 were obtained by
prescribing N?? = 180 and NH? = 221 (i.e. 180 · 221 = 39780 pairs (??, H?)) for each
macroscopic yield surface. For each of those pairs, a numerical integration of Eq. (7.11)
based on the Gauss quadrature with 40 · 40 · 40 = 64000 points were therefore performed,
as indicated in section 7.1.

7.3 From macroscopic strain rates to macroscopic stresses: Contour (level set)
plots

The procedure of obtaining macroscopic stress ? points by evaluating Eq. (7.11)
for a given number of pairs (?,H?) results in a set of points of ? that certainly lie on
the macroscopic yield surface. However, this set of stress points must be interpolated in
some way so that an arbitrary stress state that does not necessarily coincide with any of
the points in this set – but that also lies on the yield surface – could be approximately
obtained by interpolation. Hence, the interpolation procedure would profit from the yield
surface points that would have already been obtained to avoid the need of evaluating the
demanding integration in Eq. (7.11) to obtain new points.



124 Chapter 7 Some aspects on the numerical implementation

This interpolation procedure is particularly required to obtain meridional and
deviatoric level-set curves – as extensively used in chapter 4, chapter 5 and chapter 6.
These curves represent the intersections of the macroscopic yield surface with the following
planes: i) meridional (? = ??, where ?? is a prescribed level of ?); and ii) deviatoric
(?m = ??m, where ??m is a prescribed value of ?m), as illustrated in Fig. 7 and 8.

Generally, contour (or level-set) plots of an arbitrary surface, represented by a finite
set ? of points lying on it, can be numerically derived by firstly dividing the surface domain
into elements (or subdomains). These subdomains can be defined, for example, by subsets
composed of adjacent points in ?, as illustrated in Fig. 39. Secondly, an interpolation
procedure must be performed to obtain the approximated position of new points lying
on a prescribed regular grid in each of those subdomains (Fig. 40). This interpolation
procedure must consider a natural (i.e. dimensionless) coordinate system (?1, ?2) (Fig. 41)
from which shape functions ?i(?1, ?2) for i = 1, 2, 3, 4 can be deduced, as in Eq. (7.24).
The expressions of the interpolated macroscopic stress ?, strain rate Lode angle ? and
triaxiality H? are given in Eq. (7.25). Finally, the algorithm must search in each point
of the regular grids inside each subdomain for those that respect a prescribed level-set
condition (e.g. ? = ?? for meridional planes or ?m = ??m for deviatoric planes).

For two-dimensional surfaces described in three-dimensional spaces, commercial
and community codes were implemented to perform contour plots within practically
instantaneous computations. However, these codes do not account for an important
peculiarity that arises from the anisotropic yield surfaces obtained hereby. They are not
capable of identifying the equivalence of a stress Lode angles ? = 0 ? 2?. Besides, the
set of points of anisotropic yield surfaces does not necessarily follow a strict increasing
(or strict decreasing) order of ?, which aggravates the apparent discontinuity between
adjacent values of ? = 2? ?d?1 and ? = d?2, where d?1 and d?2 are sufficiently small.

Thus, an adapted contour function was implemented in Python programming
language. This code accounts for the periodicity of the parameters to be prescribed as
level-set conditions. The meridional and deviatoric curves throughout this document were
obtained by using this implementation.

8 CONCLUSION AND FURTHER WORK

Within the assumptions considered in this work – the choice of the trial field and
RVE geometry –, the modeling of different void morphologies in a Gurson-like spherical
RVE has shown to be adequate only for high triaxialities. Additionally, these effects
could only be noticeable for porosities greater than 1%. This weak influence of the void
morphology on the macroscopic anisotropy is actually due to the Gurson’s trial microscopic
strain rate field ??G, which was conceived for isotropic models considering spherical voids.
Notwithstanding, the results show a consistent formulation that accurately captures
the influence of ellipsoidal void orientations and motivated the study of matrix-induced
anisotropy.

The results obtained when including the anisotropy of the matrix lying on the
same kind of assumptions seem encouraging and need to be improved by more elaborate
kinematically admissible velocity fields associated to anisotropic materials. In these analy-
ses, the resultant macroscopic yield surfaces are sensitive to the anisotropic parameters
regardless of the material symmetry involved in them.

The generalization of the microscopic yield criterion to include yield functions such
as those of Barlat et al. (2005) leads to indefinitely increasing the number of anisotropy
parameters to characterize porous ductile materials. In the examples shown hereby, yield
surfaces of two aluminum alloys are obtained by inserting the effect of a hypothetical
porosity f = 1%. In both cases, the porosity affected the overall aspect of the yield
surfaces even for purely deviatoric loads (i.e. traceless loads whose principal directions
coincide with those of the material symmetry). This fact encourages further experimental
investigation on the characterization of porous aluminum alloys based on the formulation
herein provided.

In order to be able to apply loads whose principal directions do not coincide with
the anisotropic symmetry orientations, these formulations must be implemented in a high
performance computing language – such as High Performance Fortran (HPF), for example,
which is optimized for clustering and multithreading computers. This is required due
to the necessity of varying the principal directions of the macroscopic strain rate – and
not only its triaxiality and Lode angle –, which substantially increases the computation
time. In these cases, the resultant yield surface must be described in terms of the six
components of the stress tensor, and not only by its three invariants. Consequently, a
six-dimensional level-set plot based on Appendix B must be applied so that those yield
surfaces could be appropriately visualized in two-dimensional plots. This improvement
should also allow trigonal, monoclinic and triclinic anisotropy symmetries to be considered
in those formulations.



128 Chapter 8 Conclusions and further works

Another further step consists of implementing a porosity evolution law associated
to anisotropic ductile materials. Initially, its formulation must be based solely on the
void growth mechanism by considering the same definition as Gurson (1977) based on
mass conservation law: f? = (1 ? f) Tr E?. However, the challenging aspect is that the
macroscopic hydrostatic strain rate E?m must now be obtained from an anisotropic surface
described by a set of points, instead of an analytical closed expression.

The complementation of the present effective yield criteria with a future imple-
mentation of a porosity evolution law will make possible to apply the resultant model
in multiscale three-dimensional FEM codes for ductile fracture propagation analyses.
Although this future multiscale implementation will demand a high performance computa-
tional approach, most of the simplifications commonly assumed to make the development
of closed-form expression feasible can be overcome.

APPENDIX A – THE VOIGT NOTATION FOR TENSOR OPERATIONS

The Voigt notation provides a very convenient approach to perform tensorial
operations. It consists of representing symmetric fourth (L) and second-order (??) tensors
by matrices (L) and vectors (??), respectively. Since the tensors are assumed to hold
symmetry (i.e. Lijkl = Likjl = Lkilj and ?ij = ?ji), it avoids the evaluation of unnecessary
operations, which saves computing time.

Fourth-order tensors are represented by conveniently composing its matrix form as

L =

Due to the coefficients 2 and

2 conveniently applied in certain positions in the
matrix and vector forms (Eq. (A.1) and (A.2)), the following tensor operations can be
easily performed by using conventional matrix algebra products:

• Double contraction of a fourth-order tensor by a second-order tensor (L : ??)

L : ?? ? L??; (A.3)

• Double contraction of between two second-order tensors (?? : ??)

?? : ?? ? ??T ??; (A.4)

and

• Cross product of two second-order tensors (?? ? ??)

?? ? ?? ? ????T (A.5)

APPENDIX B – A PROCEDURE FOR INTERPOLATION OF
N-DIMENSIONAL FUNCTIONS FROM STRUCTURED MESH DATA

Let us consider a function f : RN?1 ? RN that has been evaluated in n1·n2·...·nN?1
points lying on a structured – but not necessarily regular – grid such that f(xi) = yi,
where

f(xi) = f(x(i1,i2,...,iN?1)), (B.1)

x(i1,i2,...,iN?1) = (xi11 ,x
i2
2 , ...,x

iN?1
N?1 ), (B.2)

and
yi = (yi1,y

i
2, ...,y

i
N ), (B.3)

for ij = 1, ...,nj, j = 1, ...,N ? 1.

One assumes that (N ? 1)-dimensional hypercubes constitute (N ? 1)-dimensional
subdomains (or elements). The k-th vertex of the (i1, ..., iN?1) × (i1 + 1, ..., iN?1 + 1)
hypercube are positioned at x = xk, where k is the k-th subset – among 2N?1 possible
ones – given by the cartesian product (i1, ..., iN?1)×(i1 + 1, ..., iN?1 + 1). One then defines
a shape function ?k : RN?1 ? R, associated to the k-th vertex of a given subdomain:

?k(?) =
1

2N?1
(N?1)?
k=1

(?k + ak), (B.4)

where ? = (?1, ..., ?N?1) is a local coordinate system such that ?k ? [?1, 1] and ak is k-th
multisubset (i.e. a subset that can contain repeated elements) obtained from the cartesian
product of the (N ? 1)-dimensional multisubsets (?1, ...,?1) × (1, ..., 1).

For each element, one may thus divide the range of each natural coordinate
?k ? [?1, 1] so that an auxiliary subgrid be defined inside that element. In each position of
this new subgrid the function f can be then approximated by

f(xi(?)) =
2N?1?
k=1

f(xk)?k(?), (B.5)

where

xi(?) =
2N?1?
k=1

xk?k(?). (B.6)

One may finally verify whether the approximated values of f – that are obtained in
each point lying on the subgrid correspondent to each element (i.e. hypercube) – respect



146Chapter B A procedure for interpolation of n-dimensional functions from structured mesh data

a given level-set condition (e.g. y1 = y2 = ... = yN?2 = 0). The collection of every
approximated value comprises a level-set solution to the given level-set condition.

For example, if N = 3, Eq. (B.4) retrieves the two-dimensional interpolation
function given in Eq. (7.24). Furthermore, N = 6 can be used to obtain contour plots of
six-dimensional anisotropic yield surfaces.
