Agradecimentos

Um mestrado não é feito por uma pessoa só. Nem por duas. Muitas pessoas tiveram al-
gum papel na construção do que está apresentado nas próximas páginas, por menor (mas
não menos importante) que seja. Justamente por isso, tenho muitas pessoas a agradecer
pela participação nessa etapa da minha vida que acaba de se encerrar.

Primeiramente, agradeço à minha orientadora, Ilana Wainer, por ter me guiado durante
este trabalho (e em todos os anteriores também!). Também aos docentes do IO (especial-
mente, mas não apenas os com quem tive aula durante a pós), não só pelo ensino dentro
de sala, mas pelo apoio e conselhos fora dela inclusive.

Agradeço também a toda a tripulação, pesquisadores e colegas com quem tive a opor-
tunidade de embarcar no "Tio Max", logo no primeiro mês de mestrado! Foram 29 dias
a bordo com muitas histórias, risadas, choros e, acima de tudo, muito aprendizado! Com
certeza espero rever todos um dia, inclusive o próprio continente gelado. Meu "muito
obrigado" vai também a todos do OC2, pelo apoio e convivência nesses últimos anos:
Mineiro, Ferrero, Marina, Laurinha, Fernanda, Zé, Paulo e Gabriel. Um muito obrigado
também à Iole, pelo apoio e inúmeras discussões e conselhos (nem sempre) acadêmicos.

Aos meus pais, avós e a toda minha família, que mesmo sem entender direito o que
eu faço e fiz, sempre apoiou incondicionalmente todas as minhas escolhas! Não só nesses
últimos dois anos, mas pelo menos nos últimos dez. Por falar em dez anos, também devo
agradecer aos meus grandes amigos, que apesar de nos vermos com menor frequência, são
parceiros há tanto tempo ou até mais: Alan, Lucas e Buffo.

Não só de apoio acadêmico e da família precisamos. Por isso devo agradecer MUITO,
MUITO MESMO, a todos aqueles que contribuíram para fazer cada semana mais leve e
aturável, por pior que estivesse. Primeiramente, devo agradecer ao CA da biologia (sim,
ao espaço físico, mesmo), por ter sido o ambiente de tantas comemorações, conversas e
reuniões. Agradeço também a todos do "ForrIO &amp;amp; Gafieira" (o coletivo de dança de salão
alojado no IO), desde os membros da nossa velha guarda até os mais recentes; me alegra
ver a continuidade e evolução desse grupo que começou tão pequeno e hoje é enorme!
A todos os parceiros de quadra (e também fora dela) do "Ataliba Handebol Mamute",
que me devolveram a alegria e garra do handebol após tantos anos parado. Também aos
"Demônios de Maxwell", um grupo que em pouquíssimo tempo me cativou e mostrou os
valores incríveis desse esporte que é o rugby! Não só a estes aqui citados, mas meu "muito
obrigado" vai também a todos e todas que conheci por causa do esporte universitário e
que o fazem o acontecer! É uma válvula de escape indispensável para nos mantermos sãos
e saudáveis junto aos estudos e à pesquisa.

Por último, devo agradecer àqueles que conviveram comigo – quase diariamente – não
só pelo apoio, mas também por terem conseguido me aguentar durante todos esses anos!
À gloriosa Turma Nine, em especial à Bau, Danilo, Luiza, Domo, Camila, Burns, Mar-
iana, Ceci, Lígia e Paulinha! Também à Julia, pela grande parceria e gigantesco apoio
ao longo de boa parte dessa jornada. A todos vocês e provavelmente muitos outros que
acabei esquecendo de mencionar (mas ainda assim estão no meu coração), meu mais sin-
cero obrigado! Esse trabalho também é de vocês!

Abstract

The transition between the South Atlantic and the Southern Ocean is marked by a frontal
system that includes both the South Atlantic Current and the Antarctic Circumpolar
Current (ACC). In the eastern part of the basin, the latitudinal position of the fronts that
compose this system is thought to control the input of warm waters into the Atlantic basin
through the Agulhas Leakage. Changes in the Subtropical and Polar regimes associated
with the system that marks the boundary between the Subtropical Gyre and the ACC
are investigated using the simulation results of the ocean component of the National
Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Earth System Model (CESM),
POP2. Sea surface height gradients and specific contours are used to identify and track
the ocean fronts position. We compare the Subtropical Front position at the eastern edge
of the South Atlantic to changes in temperature and salinity, as well as Agulhas Current
transports and the overlying wind field, in order to determine what could be driving frontal
variability at this region and its consequences to volume transport from the Indian into
the Atlantic. Results suggest that the Subtropical Front is not the southern boundary of
the subtropical gyre, but it responds to changes in the "Supergyre", especially the Indian
Ocean Subtropical Gyre expansion.

Resumo

A transição entre os oceanos Atlântico Sul e Austral é marcada por um sistema frontal que
inclui tanto a Corrente do Atlântico Sul quanto a Corrente Circumpolar Antártica (CCA).
Na porção oeste da bacia, acredita-se que a posição meridional das frentes que compõem
este sistema controla o aporte de águas quentes para o Atlântico pelo Vazamento das
Agulhas. Mudanças nos regimes subtropical e polar associadas ao sistema que marca
o limite entre o giro subtropical e a CCA são investigadas através dos resultados da
componente oceânica do modelo do National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR),
o Community Earth System Model (CESM), chamada POP2. O gradiente meridional,
bem como valores específicos de altura da superfície do mar são usados para identificar
e acompanhar a posição destas frentes oceânicas. A comparação da posição da Frente
Subtropical no limite leste do Atlântico Sul com as mudanças na temperatura e salinidade,
assim como no transporte da Corrente das Agulhas e do campo de ventos sobrejacente,
é feita para determinar quais as forçantes da variabilidade frontal nesta região e suas
consequências no transporte de volume entre o Índico e o Atlântico. Resultados sugerem
que a Frente Subtropical não é o limite sul do giro subtropical, mas responde às mudanças
no "Supergiro", especialmente à expansão do Giro Subtropical do Oceano Índico.

1 Introduction

1.1 The South Atlantic Upper Circulation

The Atlantic Ocean is the narrowest of all oceans and the only one with a net north-
ward transport from the southern to the northern hemisphere. This happens due to the
anomalous transport of warmer waters from higher towards lower latitudes over the South
Atlantic (Macdonald and Wunsch, 1996). Because of the relative position of the African
continent to the latitude of maximum westerly winds, Sverdrup dynamics allows rela-
tively warmer and saltier waters from the Indian Ocean to enter the Atlantic basin and
be carried north (Beal et al., 2011).

The South Atlantic subtropical gyre is limited on the western side by the Brazil Cur-
rent, a western boundary current that flows south until it meets the northward flowing
Malvinas Current (Silveira et al., 2000; Piola and Matano, 2001). The latter can be re-
garded as the northernmost branch of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). This
is known as the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence, a region of high seasonal and interannual
variability due to the strong interaction between the two current systems (Wainer et al.,
2000; Piola and Matano, 2001; Goni and Wainer, 2001; Lumpkin and Garzoli, 2011). As
the confluent currents flow eastward, they separate into two currents: the South Atlantic
Current and the northern branch of the ACC, associated with the Subantarctic Front
(SAF). These two currents are considered the dynamical boundaries of the South At-
lantic and the Southern Ocean, respectively (Stramma and Peterson, 1990; Peterson and
Stramma, 1991; Orsi et al., 1995). Part of this system extends all the way into the Indian
Ocean acting as a meridional barrier for exchanges between the Southern Ocean and the
subtropics (Speich et al., 2007). Thus, these currents and associated oceanic fronts mark
the transition between the subtropical and polar dynamical regimes not only in the South
Atlantic but in all southern hemisphere basins (Sokolov and Rintoul, 2009a).

At the southeastern side of the Atlantic basin, the South Atlantic Current is much
weaker and separates into a northward (back into the South Atlantic) and an eastward
flow (into the Indian Ocean). The former is known as the Benguela Current and is com-
posed by both South Atlantic waters and Indian Ocean waters, entering the Atlantic at
the Agulhas region (Lutjeharms and Van Ballegooyen, 1988; Speich et al., 2007; Biastoch
et al., 2008). As it flows north, it becomes part of the South Equatorial Current, eventu-
ally reaching the Brazilian coast and bifurcating southward (recirculating into the Brazil
Current) and northward as the North Brazil Current (Stramma, 1991; da Silveira et al.,
1994; Zhang et al., 2011). The waters that enter this current are carried to the North
Atlantic, eventually reaching the high latitudes as part of the Meridional Overturning
Circulation (MOC) (Talley, 2013). These currents are depicted in Fig.1.1.

1.2 The Indian Ocean Upper Circulation

Contrary to the Pacific and Atlantic, the Indian Ocean is constrained to the north by
the Eurasian supercontinent. Thus, only a southern hemisphere subtropical gyre exists in
this ocean. North of the gyre, the ocean circulation is dominated by the monsoon system
(Gordon et al., 1997).

The western boundary of the Indian Subtropical gyre, due to the existence of Mada-
gascar, is composed by the East Madagascar Current and a turbulent flow across the
Mozambique Channel. These two merge south of Madagascar with recirculated waters to
form the southwest flowing Agulhas Current (Penven et al., 2006). The Agulhas Current
then veers to the west south of Africa (following the bathymetry) until it retroflects back
into the Indian Ocean as the Agulhas Return Current (ARC; details about the Agulhas
system are discussed further below). Far from the western side of the basin, this current
is regarded as the South Indian current, which is associated with the Subtropical Front,
hereafter STF (Stramma, 1992). This current flows east until about 90 to 100?E, where it
veers northeastward, becoming the West Australian Current (Stramma and Lutjeharms,
1997). The South Indian Ocean Current starts as the most intense subtropical gyre south
boundary current but, due to intense recirculation, it weakens towards the eastern side
of the basin; this also helps to enhance the South Equatorial Current, which is much
stronger than its counterparts over other basins (Stramma and Lutjeharms, 1997). Be-
tween 50 and 70?E, the South Indian Ocean Current is steered by topography, bringing it
closer to the SAF at about 80?E and allowing cross-frontal mixing between the subtropical
gyre and the ACC (Sparrow et al., 1996). Unlike the Atlantic, a counter-current inside
the subtropical gyre exists, and it is called the Indian Counter Current. It is located
between 22 and 26?S and is fed by the East Madagascar Current retroflection, reaching
as far as 100?E (Siedler et al., 2006; Palastanga et al., 2007). Nevertheless, most of the
Indian Ocean recirculation is concentrated in the southwestern part of the basin due to
topography (Stramma and Lutjeharms, 1997).

Contrary to the other southern subtropical gyres, the Indian South Equatorial Current
(ISEC) has a zonal flow, mainly supplied by the Indonesian Throughflow (Godfrey, 1996;
Gordon et al., 1997; Stramma and Lutjeharms, 1997). As a result, it carries fresher water
from the Pacific Ocean within its flow. The Indonesian Throughflow also causes its eastern
boundary current, called the Leeuwin Current (LC), to flow polewards (Schott et al.,
2009). As a consequence, the closure of the subtropical gyre is done by the recirculating
waters from the SIOC and the West Australian Current, which is located further away
from the western Australian coast (Andrews, 1977; Stramma, 1992).

The ISEC bifurcates when it reaches the western side close to Madagascar, becoming
the Northeast and Southeast Madagascar Currents (Schott et al., 2009). The former
branches north, as the East African Coastal Current (which is not part of the subtropical
gyre), and south, to supply waters to the Mozambique Channel flow, thus closing the gyre.
Variability from the Indonesian Throughflow is then carried into the entire subtropical

13



gyre, forcing changes at interdecadal timescales originated from the Pacific (Reason et al.,
1996). The Indian Ocean itself was also shown to have a global influence on climate at
many timescales, from intraseasonal to secular, primarily but not exclusively through the
El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (Schott et al., 2009).
These currents are depicted in Fig.1.1.

1.2.1 The Agulhas Region

South of Africa, at the transition between the Indian and the Atlantic oceans, lies the
Agulhas region. There, relatively warmer and saltier waters enter the Atlantic at the first
1000 to 1600 m through the Agulhas Leakage (Bryden and Beal, 2001; Rouault et al.,
2009; Beal et al., 2011). This happens due to the fact that the line where wind stress
curl (WSC) is zero is located south of the African continent and thus not interrupted
by any landmass between the two ocean basins. As a consequence, it allows waters to
be transported meridionally (due to Sverdrup dynamics), forming a “supergyre” (Speich
et al., 2007). The connection between both subtropical gyres is mainly given by waters
shed from the retroflection of the Agulhas Current.

The Agulhas Current separates from the southeastern African coast and veers west-
wards towards the Atlantic Ocean (Ou and De Ruijter, 1986). South of Africa, at about
16 to 20?E, it retroflects to conserve potential vorticity; positive (i.e., counter-clockwise)
relative vorticity has to be generated to compensate for the "more negative" planetary
vorticity (since waters move further south) and increase in depth (Gill and Schumann,
1979; Lutjeharms and Van Ballegooyen, 1984; de Ruijter and Boudra, 1985; Lutjeharms
and Van Ballegooyen, 1988). Then, it flows eastward back into the Indian Ocean as the
Agulhas Return Current (ARC) (Quartly and Srokosz, 1993). This retroflection, as it
moves westwards and forms a progressively tighter loop, sheds its relatively warmer and
saltier waters into the Atlantic as a way of going back to a more stable state (Lutjeharms
and Van Ballegooyen, 1988). Most of the Agulhas Current waters come from the recir-
culation at the southwestern Indian subgyre and by a diffusive flow east of Madagascar
(i.e., the East Madagascar Current; Stramma and Lutjeharms, 1997).

The waters that leak into the Atlantic are then carried northwards in the form of rings
and filaments (Boebel et al., 2003). More importantly, their properties are preserved at
the thermocline and intermediate depths (Gordon et al., 1992) as it crosses the Atlantic.
This mechanism is very important for the global climate, as it is able to transport heat
and salt into the North Atlantic high latitudes (Beal et al., 2011). This region and its
currents are also depicted in Fig.1.1.

1.3 The Southern Boundary of the Atlantic Subtropical Gyre

Ocean fronts (such as the STF and the SAF) are regions of transition between different
dynamic and thermodynamic regimes or between water masses. These regions can be

respectively; South Indian Ocean Current, SIOC; Western Australian Current, WAC;

The Mozambique Channel flow is represented by a series of eddies between Africa and
Madagascar, while the eddies that leak into the Atlantic are shown crossing the entire
Atlantic basin. Main fronts over the Southern Ocean are listed as: Subtropical Front, STF;
Subantarctic Front, SAF; and Polar Front, PF. These compose the transition between the
subtropical and polar regimes. Other regions of interest are also identified: (1) the Brazil-
Malvinas Confluence, (2) the Agulhas Leakage region and (3) the Indonesian Throughflow.
Shading shows mean sea surface temperature (in ?C) of this region.

identified by strong gradients of properties such as temperature and salinity throughout
the water column (e.g., Orsi et al., 1995) and, at least in most cases, also sea surface
height (e.g., Sokolov and Rintoul, 2009a). In the South Atlantic, the transition between
its southern boundary and the waters around Antarctica is marked by a series of fronts,
most of them part of the ACC System (Orsi et al., 1995; Rintoul et al., 1999; Carter et al.,
2008).

The STF is historically regarded as the limit of the Subtropical Gyre. It is defined as
the boundary between two water masses of different regimes and very distinct properties
(e.g., temperature, salinity, density, oxygen and nutrient concentrations). Therefore, it
can be identified by the maximum horizontal gradients or by the specific contours of
such properties (Orsi et al., 1995; Belkin and Gordon, 1996; Sokolov and Rintoul, 2009a;
Dencausse et al., 2011).

Its meridional position varies zonally, as it separates from the Brazil-Malvinas Con-
fluence at roughly 37?S, veers southward and goes back to 40?S at 40? to 50?W (Belkin
and Gordon, 1996; Sokolov and Rintoul, 2009a,b; Lumpkin and Garzoli, 2011, shown in
Fig.1.1). The STF latitude remains the same until east of 40?W and then bifurcates
close to Africa into two branches. Its northern branch joins the Benguela Current and

15



its southern branch flows into the Indian Ocean south of the Agulhas Front, which is
associated with the ARC and thus part of the leakage system (Belkin and Gordon, 1996;
Ruijter et al., 1999). Dencausse et al. (2011), however, suggest the STF and the Agulhas
Front might merge and not be distinguishable from each other south of Africa.

Deacon (1982) first associated the position of the STF with the zero wind stress curl
line (WSC0) calling it the "Subtropical Convergence". The WSC0 line is considered the
atmospheric boundary of the Subtropical Gyre due to Sverdrup dynamics. Boer et al.
(2013), on the other hand, found this line to be located 10? south of the STF, and therefore
over the ACC. The association between the WSC0 and STF positions meant that this
boundary location would serve as a “gateway” for the amount of relatively warmer and
saltier waters that could enter the Atlantic as the MOC upper branch (Peeters et al.,
2004; Biastoch et al., 2009). Boer et al. (2013) also discuss the possibility that WSC0
could be related to the Subantarctic Front instead.

Boer et al. (2013) and Graham and Boer (2013) have also shown that the STF may
be viewed as a composition of two distinct systems in each side of an ocean basin in
the southern hemisphere. At the western side, the STF can be regarded as a dynamical
boundary (called Dynamical Subtropical Front —DSTF). In the Atlantic, it is associated
with the South Atlantic Current. At the eastern side of any given basin, the STF is
considered to be a zone of several lesser temperature and salinity gradients representing the
water mass boundaries called the Subtropical Frontal Zone (STFZ). The Indian Ocean’s
DSTF is associated with the ARC and therefore can be found south of Africa right at
the Atlantic Ocean’s eastern boundary. It coincides with the STF’s southern branch of
Dencausse et al. (2011).

1.4 Fronts at the Atlantic Sector of the Southern Ocean

South of the STF, the ocean is dominated by the ACC. This current is composed by a
series of circumpolar jets that flow along its fronts: the Subantarctic Front (SAF), the
Polar Front (PF) and the South ACC Front (SACCF) (Orsi et al., 1995; Belkin and
Gordon, 1996; Sokolov and Rintoul, 2009a). The SAF is the northernmost front of the
ACC, located close to South America at the Drake Passage, veering north downstream
and reaching 45?S at the Greenwich meridian (Orsi et al., 1995; Belkin and Gordon, 1996).
It can be identified both as a maximum in the SSH gradient field and by the sinking of a
less saline subsurface water tongue, which is associated with the Antarctic Intermediate
Water (Whitworth and Nowlin, 1987; Orsi et al., 1995; Sokolov and Rintoul, 2002, 2009a).

Between the ACC fronts, there are zones where properties show little variation and
are named after its southern boundary. Therefore, the region north of the SAF is the Sub-
antarctic Zone (SAZ) and to its south lies the Polar Front Zone (PFZ), which is bounded
to the south by the PF (Fig. 1.1). This front is found at about 50?S east of 40?W and can
be identified by strong gradients in density, temperature, salinity and by high geostrophic
velocities as well as by the northern edge of a subsurface temperature minimum (Deacon,

16



1933; Mackintosh, 1946; Orsi et al., 1995; Moore et al., 1999). It is between the SAF and
the PF where the formation of Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) and Subantarc-
tic Mode Water (SAMW; a precursor to the AAIW) occurs (England, 1992; Sloyan and
Rintoul, 2001; Gent, 2016). To the south of the PF lies the SACCF and the Southern
Boundary. The SACCF can only be identified by a strong gradient in subsurface tem-
perature and salinity (i.e., a transition between different water masses) despite being a
dynamical feature. The Southern Boundary, however, is not a dynamical feature as it
only marks the southernmost extent of the ACC. It is the limit between the ACC regime
and the Weddell Sea regime and can be viewed as the southernmost extent of the Upper
Circumpolar Deep Water (UCDW), one of the main water masses carried by the ACC
(Stramma and Peterson, 1990; Peterson and Stramma, 1991; Orsi et al., 1995). These
fronts and the associated water mass structure are shown in Fig. 1.2.

Many studies (e.g., Orsi et al., 1995; Belkin and Gordon, 1996; Sokolov and Rintoul,
2009a,b; Dencausse et al., 2011) discuss the location of the ACC Frontal System, which
is present in all ocean basins, but at different latitudes around Antarctica. This happens
mainly due to the strong influence of topography on the mean flow (Belkin and Gordon,
1996; Sokolov and Rintoul, 2002; Boer et al., 2013). Topography also plays a role in the
branching and merging of these fronts, sometimes dividing them into three or even more
branches (Sokolov and Rintoul, 2009a; Dencausse et al., 2011). Still, the position of such
fronts is subject to variability at many timescales. For example, Boer et al. (2013) show
that their DSTF and STFZ show different seasonal variations of their position, while the
ACC fronts show a seasonal variation of their properties but not as much of their position
(Moore et al., 1999; Graham and Boer, 2013).

1.5 Relevance to the Meridional Overturning Circulation

The South Atlantic Ocean plays a crucial role in the regulation of global climate, as both
warm and cold branches of the MOC flow through it (Garzoli and Matano, 2011; Talley,
2013). The cold branch is composed by the deep southward flow of North Atlantic Deep
Water, which is carried from the Labrador Sea all the way south to the ACC. At the
South Atlantic, it flows close to the South American coast, eventually flowing with the
Brazil Current until it reaches the Southern Ocean and becomes part of the CDW (Orsi
et al., 1993, 1995; Orsi and Wiederwohl, 2009). It is balanced by a northward return
flow of surface and thermocline waters that are redistributed from the Southern Ocean
to the Pacific and Indian ocean basins before returning to the Atlantic through the warm
branch (Speich et al., 2007; Talley, 2013), i.e., through the Agulhas Leakage. The waters
that leaked into the Atlantic are eventually advected to the North Atlantic carried by the
North Brazil Current (van Sebille et al., 2011) and its variability was shown to respond
to changes in the wind field at short timescales (Biastoch and Böning, 2013). The part
of the MOC system that is present in the Atlantic basin is more specifically called the
Atlantic MOC, also known as AMOC.

17



The Indian Ocean itself has a smaller meridional overturning cell, with northward
flowing deep and bottom waters balanced by mid-depth thermocline and near-surface
waters. Balance estimations (Toole and Warren, 1993; Robbins and Toole, 1997; Stramma
and Lutjeharms, 1997; Bryden and Beal, 2001) confirmed the Agulhas Current as the
balancing agent of such northward flow, connecting it to the AMOC.

2 Motivation

The variability of the MOC has been extensively studied at different timescales (e.g.,
Rahmstorf, 1995; Knorr and Lohmann, 2003; Peeters et al., 2004; Zhang and Delworth,
2005; Stouffer et al., 2006; Knorr and Lohmann, 2007; Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 2007; Meinen
et al., 2013) and changes in the AMOC have been linked to changes in the position of the
WSC0 line in the Southeast Atlantic Ocean (Biastoch et al., 2009; Biastoch and Böning,
2013). This, in turn, would control the STF position (Peeters et al., 2004; Biastoch et al.,
2009; Beal et al., 2011; Dencausse et al., 2011) and the strength of the Agulhas Leakage
(Alory et al., 2007).

18



While ACC fronts are believed to respond to changes in winds and heat fluxes combined
(Böning et al., 2008; Kim and Orsi, 2014; Downes et al., 2015), Sverdrup theory combined
with the fact that the STF was thought to act as the subtropical gyre southern boundary
(Speich et al., 2007) suggest that this front should be directly related to the WSC0 line.
Rouault et al. (2009) discuss that changes in the transition between the South Atlantic and
the Indian Ocean are caused by shifts of the wind field over the Indian Ocean, possibly
influencing the position of the ocean fronts. More recent work by Graham and Boer
(2013) and Boer et al. (2013) raise the question whether the WSC0 is actually the main
driving factor of the STF position. They suggest it is mainly controlled by interaction
with topography, while wind stress curl would be more associated with the SAF position.
This is further supported by the work of Durgadoo et al. (2013), which have not observed
any response of the subtropical front to the zero wind stress curl line shift; they find that
considerable changes in Agulhas Leakage happen when increasing WSC south of it.

As the main forcings of the Subtropical Front (especially at the transition between the
Atlantic and Indian oceans) are not yet completely understood, an assessment of the STF
and the overlying wind field variability, as well as temperature, salinity and velocity, might
yield more information on how these fields interact with each other, if at all. Secondarily,
the relationship between the SAF and the wind field should also be assessed in order to
see how the WSC0 position could affect it. Thus, the main question to be answered in this
study is “what controls the frontal position variability over the Agulhas region?”, focusing
on decadal to interdecadal timescales, as it is the time scale of our datasets.

3 Data and Methods

3.1 Datasets

Three distinct ocean products are used:
First, the simulation results of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)

Community Earth System Model (CESM) ocean component for the twentieth century. It
is based on the Parallel Ocean Program version 2 (POP2) of the Los Alamos National
Laboratory (Smith et al., 2010). It is a coarse resolution global model under the hydro-
static and Boussinesq approximations with an implicit free-surface formulation. It uses a
displaced North Pole grid with a horizontal nominal resolution of 1?, increasing meridion-
ally up to 0.27? near the equator. It has 60 vertical levels, which decrease in resolution
from 10 m (surface to 160 m) to 250 m (below 3500 m).

The POP2 ocean-only component is forced by the Coordinated Ocean-ice Reference
Experiments (CORE) version 2 (i.e., the version that includes interannual variability)
dataset, which is described in Large and Yeager (2009). Although this is a coarse res-
olution model and does not allow eddies, it uses a parameterisation scheme (Gent and
Mcwilliams, 1990) that was shown to be robust for very turbulent regions, such as the
Southern Ocean (Gent, 2016). Its behaviour for the Southern Ocean (including our re-
gion of interest) was described in detail by Weijer et al. (2012). More details about this
POP2 experiment, such as spin-up procedures and parameterisations, can be found in
Danabasoglu et al. (2012).

Downes et al. (2015) have already conducted an intercomparison project using different
models forced by CORE and concluded that the NCAR POP2 model is one of the best
to represent the Southern Ocean. We use a second dataset, the World Ocean Atlas
2013 (WOA13, Locarnini et al., 2013; Zweng et al., 2013), for model validation of the
temperature and salinity fields.

In order to be able to compare the velocity and sea surface height fields, we use a
third dataset, the Ocean Reanalysis System 4 (ORAS4). It was developed by the Euro-
pean Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in conjunction with other
institutions and uses the NEMO ocean model and its assimilation system NEMOVAR
on a 3D-Var FGAT configuration (Balmaseda et al., 2013). It assimilates temperature
and salinity profiles from the EN3 dataset (Ingleby and Huddleston, 2007), as well as
XBT, CTD, Argo and mooring data. The heat, momentum and freshwater fluxes used
are obtained from the ERA-40 reanalysis (Kalnay et al., 1996) until 1989 and from the
ERA-Interim project (Dee et al., 2011) from 1989 to 2009. Data from NCEP’s Opti-
mal Interpolation and OSTIA analysis are also assimilated from 2010 onwards (Mogensen
et al., 2012). It has a 1? by 1? resolution and 42 vertical levels. Its time period spans
from 1958 to 2011.

For our simple validation, we have focused on highlighting the regions of higher bias
and checking if it represents properly the frontal structure of our region of study. Simple

20



differences between those were calculated and temperature-salinity diagrams for specific
points of interest were compared.

3.2 Methods of Analysis

3.2.1 Front Identification

The frontal system was first characterised by computing the mean-state of each variable
used to identify ocean fronts, i.e., (a) temperature (from the surface to intermediate depth
levels), (b) sea surface height, (c) upper layer current velocities. The fronts were identified
according to the following criteria:

• location of sea surface temperature (SST) meridional gradient maxima on meridional
transects;

• location of sea surface height (SSH) meridional gradient maxima on meridional
transects;

• location of the surface zonal velocity maxima on meridional transects;

• the position of specific SSH contour labels selected based on the previous criteria;

• known features in the temperature and salinity transects that can be used to identify
which specific front corresponds to the peaks found.

The analyses of temperature and salinity were extended from the surface to 2000
m on meridional transects at three given longitudes: 0?, 20?E and 30?E as these allow
a direct comparison to WOA13 and also yield information on these fronts positions at
the transition between the Southeast Atlantic and the Indian oceans. Once each local
maximum in temperature and surface height was related to its respective front, time
series of each front’s meridional position were calculated for all datasets based on the
position of a specific contour. The choice of such contour was done based on which SSH
value corresponded to each peak on a cross-section averaged between 20 and 30?E. This
"specific label approach" was already used for the Southeast Atlantic (Billany et al., 2010;
Swart et al., 2010) and for other regions (Sokolov and Rintoul, 2007, 2009a; Kim and Orsi,
2014) and was proven to yield better results for tracking fronts in time than water mass
properties and the meridional gradients themselves (Chapman, 2014). Although Graham
et al. (2012) highlight that tracking fronts by meridional gradients may have certain
advantages, Chapman (2014) shows that the contour method has limitations that could
restrict its use only when using high-resolution products, which is not the case here.

3.2.2 Comparison to the wind field

Once identified, front positions were compared to the wind field through its wind stress
curl (WSC), which was calculated as:

21



?× ? =
??y

?x
?
??x

?y
(1)

? being given by the following equation from Smith (1988):

? = ?airCDU
2
10 (2)

where ?air = 1.2 kg m?3 is the air density, CD = 1.2 ·10?3 is the wind drag coefficient
(Large and Pond, 1981) and U10 is the wind velocity at 10 m above the surface. It is
worth reminding that ? has the same unit as pressure (i.e., Pa or Nm?2), but WSC has
units of Nm?3.

Meridional profile of winds at 10 m for the Atlantic (i.e., 40?W–20?E) and the Indian
Ocean (50–100?E) were also used for discussion on changes over the wind field as well as
meridional profiles of WSC, all presented as decadal means.

3.2.3 Comparison to temperature and salinity changes

Temperature and salinity changes were assessed through a temperature-salinity diagram,
surface trends over the Agulhas and eventually vertical profiles of heat and salt fluxes
towards the Atlantic. Fluxes were calculated through equations 3 and 4 respectively:

H.Flux =

? yb
ya

?0cpT ·Udy (3)

S.Flux =

? yb
ya

?0S ·Udy (4)

where ?0 = 1027 kg m?3 is the density of sea water (here simplified as a constant
value), cp = 3850 Jkg?1K?1 is sea water’s specific heat, T the temperature in Kelvin
and S the salinity in g/kg. The integration was done transversal to the Agulhas Leakage
(ya and yb being its boundaries); associated current and fluxes vertical profiles were given
respectively in Watts per meter (Wm?1) and kg m?1s?1.

3.2.4 Evaluation of the velocity fields

The currents volume transport was calculated through the following integral:

T =

? yb
ya

? 0
zb

Udzdy (5)

where U is the velocity of the current, ya and yb the horizontal boundaries and zb =
1500 m, as it was considered the maximum extent of the Agulhas current (and its leakage-
associated current as well). Results are given in Sverdrups (Sv, which represents 106

m3s?1).

22



For the discussion of some of our results, eddy kinetic energy was calculated. Its
formula, given by equation 6, is based on fluctuations over the geostrophic velocity field,
which is why we were able to calculate it even though the model does not allow eddies.

EKE =
?

[(u?ug)2 + (v ?vg)2] (6)

where ug and vg are the geostrophic velocities calculated as

ug = ?
1

f

??

?y

vg =

f

??

?x

(7)

where f is the Coriolis parameter (defined as f = 2?sin(?), ? being the latitude).
Results for EKE were given either in m2s?2 or cm2s?2. Two different units were used to
make numbers easier to read.

3.2.5 Indices for gyre strength and extent

Two indices were used for comparing front changes with changes over the circulation of
the Indian and South Atlantic subtropical gyres: (a) an index for strength, or intensity,
of the circulation. It was calculated as the average of the Barotropic Stream Function
(BSF) inside the region where it was negative (i.e., inside the subtropical gyres) with its
seasonal cycle removed. In order to filter out its high-frequency variability, a 12-month
running mean was applied twice. (b) an index for its extent was calculated as the area
where the BSF was negative. This was done by integrating over the area where BSF was
negative and removing its seasonal cycle. As in (a), a double 12-month running mean
filter was applied to reduce variability. The two indices were calculated for the Indian-
Atlantic Supergyre (i.e., from 60?W to 120?E) and for both gyres separately (dividing
them at 20?E).

The position of the zero BSF contour (BSF0) was also used as an index for the position
of the southern edge of the subtropical gyres, as this line represents where no meridional
barotropic transport occurs.

3.2.6 Other Statistics

Since the model used has a coarse horizontal resolution (1? by 1?), the position of a specific
contour label (e.g., the position of fronts, WSC0 and BSF0) at each step of the time series
had their value found through a linear interpolation between the two existing values on the
surrounding grid points. For correlations (including for cross-correlations), the Pearson
correlation was used. All time series had their seasonal cycles and trends removed before
calculating correlations and all results presented in this work are significant at 95% or
higher.

4 Model Validation

4.1 Description of the climate-mean fields

Overall, all three datasets show a similar SST structure (Fig.4.1a-c): warmer surface
waters towards the equator and colder surface waters towards higher latitudes. It is
possible to see that the southwestern Indian Ocean is warmer than the southeastern
Atlantic. The center of the South Atlantic Subtropical gyre can also be identified by the
pool of warmest temperatures close to 20?S and 40?W (the upper left edge of all plots).
Differences are shown in Fig.4.1d,e. The warm water tongue coming from the Agulhas
Current towards the Atlantic is farthest from 20?E on WOA13 than on the other two
datasets.

The surface salinity fields (Fig.4.2a-c) are not as similar as the surface temperature
ones. POP2 does not represent it so well, showing lower values throughout the entire
region south of 40?S and a tongue of fresher water west of Greenwich until about 30?S
(Fig.4.2d,e). The eastern edge of the Atlantic basin also shows higher salinity values than
ORAS4 and WOA13, as does the southwestern Indian Ocean. Despite those differences,
the overall pattern is represented by the model. Highest salinity waters are found closer to
the center of the Atlantic Subtropical Gyre and fresher waters are found over the Southern
Ocean.

As WOA13 does not have velocity fields, model results are compared to the ORAS4
reanalysis only. The sea surface height (SSH) structure is shown in Fig.4.3 and is in good
agreement with ORAS4. The main difference (Fig.4.3c) is an overall overestimated SSH,
which is more pronounced at the Southwestern Indian and the Southern Ocean.

As for the surface zonal velocity field (Fig.4.4), POP2 has a similar structure to
ORAS4, yet about 0.1 m/s more intense (reaching up to 0.2 m/s right south of Africa).
The stronger velocities can be explained by the also stronger meridional SSH gradient
field (Fig.4.5d,e) which, although very similar (even more so at the eastern side of the
Atlantic basin), is up to 0.02 m/100 km stronger in POP2. This intensity difference,
however, is not as pronounced on the meridional temperature gradient field (Fig.4.5a-c),
which once again bears a better resemblance at the eastern side of the basin and overall
has a pattern more similar to the ORAS4 product than to WOA13.

The mean meridional sections of temperature and salinity at the longitudes of 0?,
20?E and 30?E (Figs. 4.6, 4.7 and 4.8 respectively) show that the POP2 model is able to
reproduce the features first used by Orsi et al. (1995) to identify the Southern Ocean fronts.
(i) The salinity minimum tongue responsible for the AAIW formation – used to identify
the STF (which lies above it to the north) and the SAF (which lies where this fresher
water sinks); (ii) The subsurface temperature minimum used to identify the PF, which
lies north of it. They can be identified by the strong vertical tilt and sometimes outcrop
of the temperature and salinity isolines located at the regions mentioned above (tilted
isolines reach from 400 to 1000 m, sometimes even deeper depending on the longitude).

WOA13. (d, e) Difference between POP2 and (d) ORAS4; (e) WOA13.

It is important to notice, however, that in our datasets the features used to identify the
SAF and the PF yield roughly the same position. This happens because, in this region,
they are not separated enough for a coarse model resolution to distinguish them.

4.2 Model biases relative to WOA13 and ORAS4

The POP2 model results show strong biases at the regions of highest gradients (mainly the
STF, SAF and Weddell Sea regions) and in the centre of the Atlantic basin (Fig.4.1d,e). As
for salinity, significant biases were identified at the African coast and over the southwestern
Indian Ocean (where it is overestimated). At the western region of our domain and
between 35 and 40?S, it is underestimated (Fig.4.2d,e) due to the low salinity tongue seen
in the mean field. These biases, however, are not vertically homogeneous. An analysis

of the mean field difference at the 200, 300 and 900-meter levels (Figs. 7.1 and 7.2;
supplementary material) shows that the model is progressively warmer and saltier, with
higher salinity and temperature values than the reference at 900 m.

The surface height field is overestimated throughout most of the South Atlantic except
for the Agulhas Current southeast of Africa (where it is underestimated) and south of
the Agulhas Leakage region (which is close to the reference; Fig.4.3c). The zonal velocity
field difference (Fig.4.4c) shows that indeed the model has more zonally intense and
narrower current jets than ORAS4, which partly explains the overestimated Agulhas
Current transport. It is worth mentioning that leakage, due to the coarse model resolution,
is represented as a viscous boundary layer current (Weijer et al., 2012). It is expected,
therefore, that smaller scale eddy-related processes are not well represented and that
transports are overestimated as discussed in Weijer et al. (2012). Most strong biases are

difference between POP2 and ORAS4.

found where standard deviation is highest (Figs. 7.3 and 7.4; supplementary material).
A comparison of the meridional sections for the longitudes of 0?, 20?E and 30?E (Figs.

4.6, 4.7 and 4.8 respectively) shows that the low salinity tongue corresponding to the
AAIW at the eastern side of the basin is colder and fresher in the model, with increased
biases to the east. The warmer surface temperature region in Greenwich spans from 58
to 30?S (Fig.4.6) and it is reduced to a region between 58 and 48?S at 30?E (Fig.4.8).
The higher temperature and salinity values (compared to both ORAS4 and WOA13)
at Greenwich become less intense at 20?E (Fig.4.7). The model is generally colder and
fresher throughout the water column at 30?E (Fig.4.8).

4.3 Potential Temperature-Salinity diagrams

The Potential Temperature-Salinity (?-S) diagrams for the three datasets between 35 and
65?S (Fig.4.9) show that the Southern Ocean mean water mass structure is reasonably
captured by the model. POP2 overall shows less dense and warmer surface waters than
ORAS4 and WOA13 and a less saline Winter Water when compared to ORAS4 and the
profiles shown by Talley et al. (2011) (Chapter 13, Figs. 13.7 and 13.13, hereafter T13;
the figure shows three profiles over the 0 and 1?E at 39?S [red], 48?S [blue] and 61?S
[magenta]; a copy of both figures is available in the supplementary material as Figs 7.5
and 7.6). The reason why WOA13 are warmer than the other two datasets is probably
its summer bias due to the reduced number of winter observations available (?).

A comparison with the ?-S Diagrams on T13 shows that none of the datasets used here
could reproduce the frontal structure through ?-S profiles as shown by the cruise data. A
direct comparison of single profiles at the same locations (Fig.4.10) shows a much better
agreement. The POP2 representation of the Winter Water is fresher and colder, while
its versions of AAIW and Subantarctic Surface Water are considerably different from
the observed, showing higher salinity (the salinity minimum is not as pronounced in the
POP2 profile). The Upper Circumpolar Deep Water is also not well represented by the
model, as it seems to be warmer and saltier, with a narrower salinity range than ORAS4
and T13 cruise data. The Lower Circumpolar Deep Water, however, is found in both
POP2 and ORAS4 at very close values, comparable to T13 (less than 0.05 difference in
salinity and less than 0.2?C in temperature). The Antarctic Bottom Water is warmer
than T13 data in both datasets (about 0.1?C warmer), but ORAS4 shows closer values
for salinity than POP2 does (about 34.65 for ORAS4 and T13, compared to 34.75 for
POP2). The ORAS4 reanalysis, on the other hand, shows a structure strikingly similar
to T13 at intermediate to greater depths. It shows large differences only closer to the
surface, where it is over 1?C colder than the profiles shown in T13. Still, it is important
to highlight that Fig.4.10 shows mean profiles for the 1970–2009 period, whereas T13
profiles were obtained from a specific cruise in October 1983. This might explain part
of the discrepancies found. In order to facilitate further discussions and descriptions, we
will keep the classical nomenclature of water masses throughout this study despite model
results showing different temperature and salinity intervals for these water masses.

4.4 Meridional Gradients

The meridional gradient profiles (Fig.4.11) show that, except for the Greenwich SSH, the
model represents satisfactorily the structure and position of the peaks present in both
ORAS4 and WOA13 (although not with the same intensity), with a maximum difference
in position of up to 1? in latitude. As all products have a 1? horizontal resolution, it
means that they are at most a single grid point apart. Furthermore, it is possible to
clearly identify two distinct fronts through SSH at 20 and 30?E with a maximum in SST

32



gradient slightly north of the northernmost SSH gradient maximum. This is confirmed by
the meridional SST and SSH gradient fields (Fig.4.5), which show that the POP2 model
captures the frontal structure very well, especially at the Southeast Atlantic (the focus of
this investigation). Also, these peaks coincide with the gradients found in the 0?, 20?E
and 30?E cross-sections (Figs. 4.6, 4.7 and 4.8 respectively), proving them to be robust
from the surface to intermediate depths.

5 Results and Discussion

5.1 Ocean Fronts Identification

Identifying fronts through changes in temperature and salinity inside a certain interval
such as the ones identified by Orsi et al. (1995) cannot be done due to the model biases.
For the same reason, it is difficult to compare results to other studies in terms of values.
Thus, we have focused on the spatial structures found in the temperature and salinity
transects rather than the expected intervals. Fig. 5.1 summarises the comparison between
POP2 and ORAS4 surface gradients and how they relate to the water properties vertical
structure as well as the SSH values. This helps to identify fronts according to their mean
position and thermohaline criteria. By comparing SSH values from both datasets, it is
possible to see that POP2 is able to reproduce satisfactorily the mean state of the frontal
structure and its meridional gradients at the same latitude, despite the differences in the
SSH values themselves.

from ORAS4 (solid, red) and POP2 (dashed, blue) at (a) 0?, (b) 20?, (c) 30?E. Red and
blue lines represent SSH, whereas black lines represent the SSH gradients. Middle panels:

35



The average between transects from 20 to 30?E was chosen to look for the SSH contour
best associated to each meridional gradient peak as fronts are better distinguishable in
this region (Fig.5.2). Also, this allows keeping the STF associated with the Agulhas
Front/ARC.

The northernmost peak in the meridional gradient lies directly above a region of
strongly vertically tilted isotherms and isohalines. This gradient extends from the surface
to about 1200 m for potential temperature and about 800 m for salinity (Fig.5.2b,c respec-
tively). Below these tilted isolines, the tongue-shaped salinity minimum associated with
the AAIW can be found. North of this gradient, shallow waters with high salinity and
temperature suggest that this is the region of the Agulhas Current (AC). These features
fit the thermohaline criteria established by Orsi et al. (1995) and therefore are evidence
that this surface meridional SSH gradient peak represents the Subtropical Front (STF),
hereafter represented by the SSH = 0.15 m contour. As for the southern peak in merid-
ional SSH gradient, it lies directly north of a subsurface potential temperature minimum
and right over vertically tilted isotherms and isohalines that extend below 2000 m and up
to about 1500 m, respectively. This shows that this front is also consistent throughout
the water column from surface to intermediate depths. According to its position and
thermohaline criteria, it can be regarded as the Subantarctic Front (SAF), hereafter rep-
resented by the SSH = -1.1 m contour. We note that, according to Swart et al. (2010)
and Kim and Orsi (2014), it could be the Polar Front (PF) instead. However, since the
model horizontal resolution is not high enough for these two fronts to be well separated
from each other at this longitude, we have decided to consider it as the SAF. Front mean
positions, as well as their respective trends throughout the period, are listed in Table 5.1.

Figure 5.2: Cross-sections averaged between 20?E and 30?E of (a) Meridional SSH gra-
dients (solid line) and SSH values (marked line); (b) Potential Temperature (?C); (c)
Salinity. Vertical dashed lines show the SAF (south) and STF (north) mean positions for
an easier comparison between the three panels.

For assessing changes in time we looked at the variation of each contour mean position
during the first five years (i.e., 1970–1974; Fig.5.3a) and during the last five years (i.e.,
2005–2009; Fig.5.3b). Between 15?E and 40?E, there is a southward displacement of

36



the STF of roughly 45 km (Fig.5.4). It is worth mentioning that we consider only the
southern branch of the 0.15 m contour to be the STF and east of 10?E, which was the
contour used for the time series in Fig.5.4b. Changes in the SSH gradient distribution
can also be observed in Fig.5.3. As for the SAF, it shows a large zonal variability of its
mean position. For example, its southward trend at 20?E is 4 times greater than the 20
to 30?E mean and the 30?E variation (Fig.5.5).

STF mean position between 1970 and 2009.

5.2 Ocean Fronts Variation and Wind Stress Curl

For the 40-year period analysed, the mean STF position is located at 39.5?S, whereas the
mean position of the SAF is at 50.5?S. This means that the SAF is located at a latitude
much closer to the zero WSC line than the STF, which is located 10? to the north (Fig.5.6).
The STF position is, in fact, closer to the latitude of highest WSC values. The STF shows
very little zonal variation over the Agulhas region and shifts south at all longitudes, while

37



the SAF has migrated south only close to 20?E. West of 10?E there is virtually no change
and east of about 25?E, it has either migrated north or remained at the same position.

show where the SAF and the STF are located on the SSH curves.

Table 5.1: Summary of both fronts identified, listing contours used for identification, their
mean position and trends (in km/decade). Trends are significant over the 95% level.

Front SSH contour (m) Mean Position Trend (km/dec)
STF 0.15 39.5?S -11.6
SAF -1.1 50.5?S -6.0

The WSC0 line does indeed migrate south at most longitudes between the Atlantic
and the Indian Ocean (Fig.5.7a), but, at this time scale, its displacement at any longitude
is much stronger than that of the STF or the SAF (i.e., it moves much further south than
the fronts). The highest change in WSC happens over the Indian sector of the Southern
Ocean and north of the WSC0 line, while much weaker changes happen elsewhere. This
high WSC increase (the trend at this region is 1.5 to 2 times stronger than elsewhere in
the Indian Ocean or the Agulhas region) is mostly due to an intensification and southward
migration of the westerlies core1 (Figs.5.7b,c). At lower latitudes, a negligible southward
migration is seen both for the Southeast Atlantic and the Indian Ocean basin, and no
significant changes can be seen in the trade winds. Still, there is an increase in WSC over
the Indian Ocean (Fig.5.7d).

Although both the STF at the Agulhas and WSC0 over the Indian Ocean (representing
changes in the wind field) have shifted south, they do so at different rates (11.6 km/decade
and 36 km/decade respectively) and show different zonal structures. This, combined with
the fact that the mean positions of these two features are more than 10? of latitude
apart and their weak correlation in time (strongest correlation of -0.19 when WSC0 lags
by 6 months, Table 5.2), suggests that they bear no direct relationship, or at least it
is not as direct as once thought. The SAF seems more directly related to WSC0 since
its location coincides with it at ? 50.5?S. The shift in the position of WSC0 (about 36
km/decade) is considerably stronger than that of the SAF at any longitude. At 20?E,
the SAF trend is strongest, shifting 24 km/decade. At 30?E, no trend was found and an
average between both longitudes yielded a southward trend of 6 km/decade. The total
STF displacement was zonally uniform between 10?E and 30?E. It shifted about 45 km
south over 40 years, roughly 6% of the changes observed by Bard and Rickaby (2009)
during stadial-interstadial shifts. During stadial periods (i.e., ice ages), the STF was
located further north, as was the westerlies core. This constricted the area where inflow
from the Indian to the Atlantic was possible at the Agulhas region. Conversely, during
interstadial (i.e., interglacial) periods, since the STF is located further south (as is the
westerlies core), there is a larger region over which this inflow to the Atlantic is possible.
Considering that natural, pre-industrial shifts happened over tens of thousands of years,

1It is also important to remind that the WSC0 line is representative of the westerlies core, since the
meridional wind shear is zero at the point where westerly winds reach their maximum strength. As can
be seen in Figs. 5.7b and c, the WSC is positive to the north and negative south of the maximum.

39



the rate of change found in the model over this period also suggests an anthropogenic
impact over this region as discussed by Biastoch and Böning (2013).

If the westerlies, WSC0 and the STF all migrate south, but do not seem to be directly
related, what could be forcing the STF changes or what could potentially link the two
features? So far, changes do not seem to be locally forced. Next, we look at temperature
and salinity variations over the mean STF region, before discussing Agulhas Current
transports, leakage, and forcings.

statistically significant (at 95% confidence) linear trend between 1982 and 2009 trying to
replicate the trend found by Rouault et al. (2009).

5.3 Temperature and Salinity changes

Over the southeast Atlantic boundary, north of the STF mean position at 20?E, there
is a statistically significant increase in surface temperature of 0.06?C per decade (i.e.,
0.24?C over the 40-year analysed period; Fig.5.8). Stronger trends are observed closer
to the STF mean position, reflecting the southward displacement of the warmer waters
north of it towards a colder region. Trends observed south of the African coast are close
to the values found throughout the southwestern Indian Ocean, and south of 45?S, a
predominant cooling trend is observed. Throughout the southwestern Indian Ocean, this
positive trend could be seen as the basin-wide warming previously reported (Nitta and
Yamada, 1989; Levitus et al., 2001; Lu et al., 2004; Levitus et al., 2005).

Salinity, on the other hand (Fig.5.9), increases until a sudden drop from 2002 onwards
over the southwestern Indian Ocean and south of Africa (extending throughout the whole
Indian Ocean, but starting at different times; not shown), which causes its trend to be
negative for the 1970–2009 period2. Considering only the 1970–2002 period over the AC,
it has a 0.02/decade increase (Fig.5.9b). The southwestern Indian Ocean shows a similar
positive trend, but salinity over the Mozambique Channel and the Eastern Madagascar
Current (i.e., both west and east of Madagascar, the AC upstream branches) increases
at about 0.05/decade. This means that, regardless of the period to be considered (and
therefore trend magnitude and sign), changes south of Africa over the Agulhas region are
linked to changes over the southwestern Indian Ocean and upstream of the AC.

Similar variations in salinity (including the sudden drop) were found throughout the
Indian ocean at lower latitudes (not shown). The spatial pattern of surface salinity trends
agrees with surface precipitation (represented in the model by salinity fluxes; Fig.5.10a,b)
and, when averaged throughout the whole basin, they show a correlation of -0.45 with
surface salinity lagging by 6 months (Fig.5.10c,d). When looking exclusively at the 2002–
2009 period, trends are over twice as strong or even higher depending on the region. These
results offer enough evidence for us to believe that the salinity drop after 2002 was most
likely caused by the forcing surface salinity fluxes (i.e., how precipitation is forced in the
model) over the entire Indian Ocean. Also, no changes in the ocean dynamics were found
that could explain it. The spatial pattern of the trend until 2002 (Fig.5.10a) also bears
some resemblance to the SST trends shown (Fig.5.8). Nevertheless, the model shows a
coherent structure between the Indian and the Atlantic through the Agulhas region (as
in observations) despite having an opposite trend.

2Although there is this sudden drop in salinity after 2002, it is important to highlight that it increases
again during the last two years, but it does not reach pre-2002 values until the end of 2009.

The ?-S diagram for the four decades (1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s; Fig.5.11) shows
that changes happen from the surface to the model’s Lower Circumpolar Deep Water
(LCDW). As expected, changes below the model’s Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW)
are very small. The most significant changes are observed in the upper layers. Waters
above the ? = 27.4 kg/m3 isopycnal (i.e., about 1200 m) show an increase in potential
temperature, which is consistent with observations for the Indian and Atlantic Oceans
(Levitus et al., 2001, 2005).

On the other hand, salinity decreases from this deeper layer until the ? = 26.5 kg/m3

isopycnal (at roughly 220 m) and increases afterwards up to the surface. In other words,
it has increased everywhere except for the AAIW layer, where it has decreased. This
suggests that only at the upper layers (i.e., above 220 m) there is an increase in the
amount of salt these already saltier waters are carrying into the Atlantic, while other
changes are taking place over the AAIW and the Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW).

43



It is also worth mentioning that the salinity changes seen on intermediate to subsurface
layers (i.e., above and including AAIW) and over the Indian Ocean before 2003 match
observations (Boyer et al., 2005; Durack and Wijffels, 2010).

Despite vertical variations, heat and salt fluxes towards the Atlantic have increased
from decade to decade, as did salt transport (Fig.5.10e,f), suggesting that velocity vari-
ability might play a stronger role than temperature or salinity variations for transporting
heat or salt from the Indian to the Atlantic. Choosing a reference salinity for the flux
calculations, over which we would compute the deviations, could lead to different results
(Weijer and Van Sebille, 2014). Since salinity was shown to be highly variable due to
changes in the surface forcings, computing fluxes using deviations from a reference av-
erage salinity value did not improve the flux estimates (not shown). Still, our results
indicate that the changes over the AAIW are also carried through this leakage current,
as they are embedded in the 1500 m deep leakage flow shown in the flux profiles (Fig.
5.10e).

5.4 Velocity and transport changes

The Agulhas Leakage in the model is represented by a viscous flow in a boundary layer
that emerges from the retroflection system as a bifurcation (Fig.5.12). For this reason,
transport values are greatly overestimated, which is why we have not focused on absolute
values, but rather on anomalies and trends.

Figure 5.12: Streamlines of the surface velocity over the Agulhas region. Colors show
velocity values in m/s. The lines show the transects at 20?E and 30?E for reference.

The model results show that Agulhas Leakage intensifies at 20?E and extents from the
surface to 1600 m (Fig. 5.13a), in agreement with previous studies (Bryden and Beal, 2001;
Rouault et al., 2009). We calculated its transport by integrating the westward velocity
at the same 20?E cross-section (dotted rectangle in Fig. 5.13a), and its anomaly can be
seen in Fig.5.13b. The average transport of 41 Sv obtained with POP2 is comparable to
the 43 Sv found by Weijer et al. (2012) using the same ocean model in a coupled setup.
It showed an increase of about 6 Sv in 40 years (1.5 Sv/decade), comparable to the 5 Sv
found by Biastoch et al. (2009). Its variation in time is well correlated to the STF position

45



(-0.76 at lag zero; Table 5.2). It was not correlated, however, to the WSC0 position (-0.14
when WSC0 leads by one month; Table 5.2). The SAF associated jet also intensifies
(Fig.5.13a). However, it seems to be tightening (i.e., its northern edge is weakening while
its core intensifies) while the boundary current associated to the AC leakage seems to be
broadening (i.e., trends are not centred over the core of this current).

Since changes in the velocity field structure at the 20?E cross-section also indicate that
the Agulhas Leakage current could be either broadening or slightly moving south, we test
this hypothesis based on Beal and Elipot (2016), who show through observations that in-
stead of intensifying, the AC broadens due to increased eddy activity. Although our model
does not allow eddies, it is possible to calculate the eddy kinetic energy (EKE) through
the velocity fluctuations compared to computed geostrophic velocities (as explained in
section 3-Methods). Consistent with Beal and Elipot (2016), there is an increase in EKE
(at a very similar rate) over the Agulhas Current and its Leakage Current (Fig.5.14). As
expected, the correlation between EKE and the Leakage transport at 20?E is very high
when filtering out high-frequency variability (R = 0.87 when EKE leads transport by 1
month; Table 5.2). However, broadening or increased EKE of this current itself cannot
explain the STF southward shift. By using the position where zonal velocity is zero as
an index for the edge of the Leakage Current, we found its southward displacement to
be statistically significant, but too small and too subject to interpolation to be a robust
indicator of the current broadening or displacement. Its correlation with EKE at 20?E
was also weak (-0.36 when EKE lags by 3 months; Table 5.2).

Figure 5.13: (a) Meridional cross-section of mean zonal velocity (shading, m/s) and its
trend (each line denotes a 0.2 cm/s month?1 trend; solid for positive and dashed for nega-
tive) at 20?E. (b) Solid lines show time series of Agulhas leakage transport anomaly (gray,
Sv; 1 Sv = 106m3/s) for the dotted area in (a) and its 12-month running mean (black).
The dash-dotted line shows the STF deviation from its mean position in kilometers as in
Fig. 5.4, but under a 12-month running mean.

AC transport at 30?E has increased by roughly 1.3 Sv (0.32 Sv/decade; Fig.5.15a). The
ARC transport, on the other hand, has decreased by 4.4 Sv (1.1 Sv/decade; Fig.5.15b).
It can be seen that the AC transport at 30?E shows a much smaller change than the other
main currents, but is still in line with an intensification of the entire current system. An
increase of WSC over the Indian Ocean was also found, which could explain the strength-
ening of this current system. Since transport towards the Atlantic is well correlated to the
STF position, the results obtained so far suggest that changes in the STF mean latitude
and in the current transports at the Agulhas region could be connected to larger scale
changes.

The Barotropic Stream Function (BSF) field can be used to look at large scale changes
over the two ocean basins. Changes in BSF (Fig.5.16a) show that not only is there an
intensification of the circulation over both South Atlantic and Indian subtropical gyres
(and the whole Supergyre), but also an increase in recirculation at the southwestern
Indian Ocean. Since the position of the zero BSF contour (hereafter BSF0) can be used
as an index of the Subtropical Gyre southern border displacement (as it is its dynamical
boundary), it is natural to see how it changes in time at the Agulhas region. Indeed, there
is a significant southward displacement of the BSF0 at 20?E (Fig.5.16b) and an overall
intensification of the Indian Ocean subtropical gyre (Fig.5.16c).

The BSF0 has shifted south throughout the Indian and Atlantic ocean basins, but at a
much stronger pace over the Agulhas region (Fig.5.17). This goes against the topographic

47

Return Current at 30?E.

control suggested by Boer et al. (2013). According to their results, the STF should show
no shift in its position, since changes would be constricted by the bottom topography.
The correlation between the STF and BSF0 positions at the same region is R = 0.57
with BSF0 leading STF by one month (Table 5.2). This suggests a strong link between
both variables although the BSF0 trend is almost three times as high as the STF (35
km/decade and 11.6 km/decade respectively). The STF trend over the Agulhas is very
similar to the BSF0 trend between 30?W and Greenwich.

In order to quantify changes in the subtropical gyres circulation and extent, two indices
were used. First, gyre strength was calculated as the anomaly of the mean BSF over the
region where it has negative values (i.e., the subtropical gyres). Second, gyre extent was
calculated as the anomaly of the total area where BSF is negative. A double 12-month
running mean was applied in order to reduce high-frequency variability. Strength and
extent indices are presented in Figs. 5.18a and b, respectively. As shown, both Atlantic
and Indian subtropical gyres intensify (and therefore the Supergyre) and the Indian Ocean
shows an expansion trend, especially from the early 1990’s onwards.

The Indian gyre (and the Supergyre) intensification can partly explain the AC velocity
increase and the increased leakage in our model. The transport at 20?E is well correlated
to the strength of both Indian and Atlantic gyres as well as the Supergyre. The lags
of maximum correlations suggest this response to take 4 to 6 months (Table 5.2). The
increase in WSC over the Indian Ocean (Fig.5.7d) is most likely the cause, even though it is
statistically significant (as reported by Rouault et al., 2009) in our data only when filtering
out higher frequency variability and only considering the 1980’s to 2009 period. Most of
this WSC increase is attributable to the westerlies strengthening, since no changes can be
seen in the trade winds in the CORE dataset (Fig.5.7c). This agrees with the results of
Durgadoo et al. (2013), who showed the Agulhas leakage to respond to stronger westerlies
rather than the WSC0 position. Their proposed mechanism is more local. According

age represented by the shading while positive (negative) trends are represented by solid
(dashed) contours; (b) Meridional profile of the BSF at 20?E; (c) Meridional profile of the
BSF over the Indian Ocean (50-100?E average).

to Durgadoo et al. (2013), stronger westerlies increase WSC over the Indian sector of
the Southern Ocean, which in turn increases downward Ekman pumping. As a result,
the ocean interior responds with increased northward transport that is compensated by
increased leakage. Our results show an increase in WSC over the Indian Ocean sector
of the Southern Ocean, meaning that both the gyre strengthening and the response to
an increased Ekman pumping could be in action in the model. The uniform southward
displacement of BSF0 is a reflection of the Indian Gyre expansion, which is stronger from
the early 1990’s onwards (as is the BSF0 shift over the Agulhas/Southeast Atlantic). Kim
and Orsi (2014) have already discussed the influence of an intensification of the Indian
subtropical gyre, which works with the WSC0 shift to expand it polewards. This results
in the displacement of Antarctic Circumpolar Current fronts in the eastern side of the
Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean. Here we find the STF to also respond to this
expansion but on the western side of the Indian Ocean subtropical gyre.

We now have enough evidence to believe that changes in the STF position can be
related to changes over the strength and the expansion of the Indian subtropical gyre:
(i) the expansion of the Indian subtropical gyre (especially over the Agulhas region), (ii)
the consistency between an intensification of the circulation and the transport observed
at 20?E, and (iii) the good agreement between the BSF0 and the STF variations.

6 Summary and Conclusions

Multiple definitions of the Subtropical Front have been associated with changes in the
southern boundary of the southern hemisphere subtropical gyres via a direct relationship
with the zero wind stress curl line. In this study, we investigated this association using
the ocean component of the NCAR-CESM forced by the CORE dataset. We compared
the STF behaviour to the actual dynamical features that represent the gyre boundary
and its possible forcing mechanisms.

We identified two distinct fronts over the transition between the Atlantic and the
Indian oceans. They were considered the SAF (southern, at 50.5?S) and the STF (north-
ern, at 39.5?S) according to their mean position and features in potential temperature
and salinity cross-sections. Changes in their position were assessed by tracking in time
the position of a specific SSH contour throughout our 40-year analysis period from 1970
to 2009. The contour was selected considering the one that was best associated with the
local maximum SSH gradient (-1.1 m for the SAF and 0.15 m for the STF)

Although both fronts migrate south, as well as the latitude of WSC0 which was be-
lieved to be the controlling factor of the STF position Ruijter et al. (e.g., 1999); Beal et al.
(e.g., 2011), they are about 10 degrees in latitude apart and not correlated in time at any
lag. A slight yet statistically significant increase in wind stress curl over the Indian Ocean
was observed, as well as an increase in westerlies intensity over the Southern Ocean of
about 1 m/s (i.e., roughly 12%) and a southward shift of its core.

Accompanied by this increase in wind stress curl, an increase in transport of the
Agulhas leakage of 6 Sv over 40 years was observed, which was shown to be part of

51



a larger scale gyre spin-up and increase. An upstream increase of roughly 1.3 Sv over
40 years was observed, consistent with the strengthening of the recirculation cell of the
Southwestern Indian Ocean. Not only has the Indian Subtropical gyre intensified, it has
also expanded. Our results show that the stronger westerly winds were responsible for
such changes.

The increased leakage happens from the surface down to about 1600 m, in agreement
with previous studies for the Agulhas Current (Bryden and Beal, 2001; Rouault et al.,
2009). Although precipitation does change salinity over a wide region of the Indian Ocean,
the amount of salt carried into the Atlantic is much more dependent on leakage variability.
It is important to keep in mind that POP2 overestimates the Agulhas Leakage. Thus,
considerations regarding transport and flux changes are most likely a reflection of the
gyre-scale intensification.

In the time scales analysed in this study, the STF position was shown to be largely
connected to the Supergyre expansion, especially over the Indian ocean. Although the
whole Indian Subtropical gyre expands, the BSF0 position had its largest southward
displacement right over the Agulhas region. The results confirm that changes in the
large-scale wind stress forcing (rather than local) influence changes in the STF position.
Subtropical Gyre dynamics are essentially forced by the wind field and its stress applied
to the ocean over the entire basin. Although WSC0 and BSF0 lines are the actual agents
that represent the southern edge of subtropical gyres, over the last decades the STF has
followed the Supergyre dynamics and moved with it.
