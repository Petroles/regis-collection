Abstract 

 

Common bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, are social marine mammals with complex fission – 

fusion societies. The acoustic signals propagate efficiently in water, being an ideal form of 

communication in low visibility waters such as in estuarine habitat. Underwater acustic signals have 

an important role not only for communication, but also for navigation and prey detection. 

The Sado estuary bottlenose dolphins have a wide vocal repertoire that can be divided in three major 

categories of signals: unpulsed sounds (tonal), such as whistles; echolocation clicks; and burst-pulsed 

signals, such as creaks, squawks or bangs. This work focus in the brays series, a pulsed vocalization 

type that combine gulps, grunts and squeaks in bouts. 

Bray series have been reported in several, but not in all populations of bottlenose dolphins, however 

their functional role has yet to be fully understood. This work presents a quantitative analysis of the 

emission of this signal. 

This study was conducted in the Sado estuary region focusing on the resident bottlenose dolphin 

population. To understand which factors influence this conspicuous vocalization, a set of ecological 

and behavioural variables were analysed, such as group size, depth, location, pattern of activity, 

presence of vessels and tidal phase. 

A Generalized Linear Model with a Binomial Negative Regression Model was used to test the 

influence of the variables selected. The results show that group size, depth, location, vessels and tide 

had no effect on the emission rate of bray series. Only the activity pattern affected the number of bray 

sequences. Foraging (??? = 1.63±0.51), feeding (??? = 2.13±0.69) and socialization (??? = 2.06±0.81) 

showed significant higher counts than travelling, supporting notion of social (agonistic or affiliative) 

function for this signalling emissions.

Resumo 

 

Os golfinhos-roazes, Tursiops truncatus (Montagu 1821), são mamíferos aquáticos, pertencentes à 

ordem Cetartiodactyla, infraordem Cetacea, parvordem Odontoceti e à família Delphinidae. Esta 

espécie apresenta uma ampla distribuição, habitando desde águas tropicais até às águas temperadas, e 

algumas populações podem ser residentes, habitando baias, lagoas ou estuários, como o do Sado. 

A troca de informação é um processo vital na vida animal, e pensa-se que a complexidade das 

sociedades está relacionada com a complexidade de comunicação entre os seus elementos. Os 

golfinhos Roazes apresentam uma elevada capacidade cognitiva e são acusticamente especializados, 

vivem em sociedade de fissão – fusão, formando complexas alianças cuja composição varia ao logo do 

tempo, dependendo do contexto social.  

O vasto repertório vocal de Tursiops truncatus pode ser dividido em três categorias de sinais: sons 

não-pulsados (tonais), cliques de ecolocalização e outros sons pulsados. 

Os cliques de ecolocalização pertencem à categoria de sons pulsados, são altamente direcionais e são 

usados como sonar para orientação e deteção de alvos. O animal emite trens de cliques e obtém 

informação do ambiente envolvente através dos ecos recebidos, apresentam uma taxa de repetição 

abaixo de 40 pulsos por segundo.  

A categoria de outros sons pulsados é separada dos cliques de ecolocalização por apresentarem uma 

taxa de repetição muito alta (acima dos 300 pulsos por segundo) e tem um intervalo entre cliques 

muito curto (menos de 3 ms), que poderá interferir com a função de sonar. O papel funcional destes 

sinais ainda não é claro, certos estudos, como Herzing (1996) associaram alguns sons pulsados com 

comportamentos agonísticos ou de cortejo. 

No extenso repertório vocal dos golfinhos-roazes existe um grupo de sons pulsados que são 

combinados em distintas unidades vocais, para produzir sequências rítmicas, chamadas de zurros. Os 

zurros foram descritos pela primeira vez por dos Santos et al. (1990) no estuário do Sado, Portugal, e 

desde então tem sido descritos e estudados em diversas populações de Tursiops truncatus. 

Os padrões temporais e estruturais dos zurros ainda se encontram pouco claros. Estes sinais de 

multiunidades poderão representar um papel específico no repertório vocal, que poderá diferir 

consoante os componentes dos zurros, podem ser compostos por grunhidos, goles e guinchos. Esta 

vocalização poderá estar associada a comportamentos de socialização, ou a comportamentos de 

alimentação.  

Para o presente trabalho foi analisado um total de 205 gravações recolhidas na região do estuário do 

Sado, de março de 2014 a abril de 2017. 

O contexto comportamental foi avaliado tendo em conta os padrões de atividade observados à 

superfície durante as gravações, tendo sido definidos cinco categorias: alimentação (movimentos 

rápidos à superfície e em várias direções, estando os animais próximos uns dos outros), busca de presa 

(movimentos erráticos dos animais à superfície, geralmente acompanhados de curtos mergulhos), 

socialização (estabelecimento de contacto físico à superfície, com curtos períodos de submersão), 

deslocação (o grupo de golfinhos movimenta-se numa determinada direção, com mergulhos 

sincronizados) e repouso (animais muito próximos entre si, em movimentação lenta e direção 

constante ou praticamente imóveis à superfície). O comportamento de repouso não foi observado 

durante os períodos de amostragem.  

Os sons captados durante as gravações foram analisados em laboratório e atribuídos a categorias pré-

estabelecidas, de acordo com as suas caraterísticas: Assobios – som tonal modulado e de banda curta; 

Cliques de ecolocalização - Sinais pulsados direcionais, de banda larga e muito curta duração; 



IV 

 

Rangido – som de banda larga com alta repetição (&gt; 40 estalidos por segundo), semelhante ao ranger 

de uma porta; Chorinco – alta taxa de repetição (maior do que o rangido) e a frequência dominante 

variável ao longo da emissão, aspeto aural oscilante, assemelha-se a um choro de bebé; Trem de Taxa 

Variável (TTV) – pode conter cliques discerníveis, rangidos e chorincos, emitidos seguidos e ordem 

variável, consoante a taxa de emissão dos cliques aumenta ou diminui; Buzz (S-BP) – trem com alta 

taxa de repetição e curta duração (inferior 0,05 s), semelhante ao de uma abelha; Bang – som pulsado 

isolado de elevada energia; Grunhido – trem de sons pulsados intensos, com sonoridade estridente e 

áspera que se parece ao grunhir dos porcos; Gole – som pulsado curto e de baixa frequência, 

sonoridade de um gole ou soluço; Guincho – curto som pulsado que apresenta uma estrutura 

harmónica, semelhante a um grito ou ganido agudo. 

Através deste estudo verificou-se que os sons mais comuns no repertório dos golfinhos-roazes da 

população residente do estuário do Sado são os assobios e os trens de cliques, uma vez que, 

desempenham as funções de comunicação e bio-sonar, respetivamente, e podem ser emitidos em 

simultâneo, possivelmente transmitindo informação a conespecíficos sobre presença em atividades de 

alimentação. Estabeleceu-se, também, que os elementos vocais que constituem os zurros são sons 

comuns no repertório vocal e são mais emitidos em sequência, do que emitidos isoladamente. 

Cada sequência de zurro foi definida usando um critério de 0,6 segundos de intervalo silencioso entre 

elementos vocais, permitindo separar o fim da primeira sequência e o início da segunda, o que 

permitiu uma análise quantitativa das emissões de zurros. 

Tendo em conta as variáveis: local (dentro ou fora do estuário); profundidade; tamanho do grupo; 

presença ou ausência de embarcações; estado da maré (enchente ou vazante); e atividade dominante 

usou-se um Modelo Linear Generalizado, com uma distribuição Binomial Negativa para perceber que 

fatores influenciam a taxa de emissão de zurros, usando 179 gravações, onde os elementos vocais que 

constituem as sequências de zurros apresentam uma relação de qualidade – ruído média e boa. 

Só o padrão de atividade demonstrou diferenças significativas (valores p&amp;lt;0,01), sendo que as 

atividades de alimentação (??? = 2,13±0,69), busca de presa (??? = 1,63±0,51) e socialização (??? = 

2,06±0,81), apresentam taxas de emissão de zurros significativamente maiores que a atividade de 

deslocação.  

Como as sequências de zurros apresentam diversidade de estrutura e composição, as diferentes 

combinações poderão indicar que este tipo de vocalização é emitida em múltiplos contextos. O 

contexto social e ecológico onde se verificou maiores taxas de emissão (alimentação, busca de presa e 

socialização) são complexos, dinâmicos e apresentam diversos estados motivacionais, enquanto, que a 

atividade de deslocação envolve pouca interação entre indivíduos. 

Os fatores local, profundidade, tamanho do grupo, presença de embarcações e estado da maré não 

revelaram diferenças significativas na taxa de emissão de zurros (valores p&gt; 0,05).  

Este estudo conclui que, os zurros são emitidos com mais frequência em padrões de atividades que 

envolvem mais interação entre os indivíduos e estados motivacionais mais excitados, como a 

alimentação, a busca de presa e a socialização. Os fatores ambientais não relevaram influências 

significativas na taxa de emissão destas vocalizações. 

Embora o estatuto de conservação da espécie Tursiops truncatus seja “pouco preocupante”, as 

populações de golfinhos, como a do estuário do Sado, estão bastante expostas às atividades 

antropogénicas, como o tráfego de embarcações, poluição e perseguição por parte de embarcações de 

recreio, entre outras. Estes problemas associados a baixas taxas de reprodução, de recrutamento e 

continuo envelhecimento da população, apresentam importantes ameaças à sobrevivência destas 

populações.

Ao estudar as emissões acústicas dos golfinhos no seu meio natural, podemos compreender o papel 

funcional destas vocalizações e a associação com os contextos comportamentais, e assim, perceber e 

avaliar os impactos antropogénicos na população, para tomar medidas de preservação adequadas.

1. Introduction 

 

The common bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus (Montagu 1821), is an aquatic mammal, 

classified in the order Cetartiodactyla, infraorder Cetacea, parvorder Odontoceti and family 

Delphinidae (Wells &amp;amp; Scott, 2008).  

This species has a worldwide pelagic distribution, inhabiting from tropical to temperate waters, both in 

oceanic and coastal environments, more or less adjacent to continental masses or oceanic islands. In 

coastal waters, some populations become resident in bays, lagoons or in estuaries and other shallow 

coastal regions (Bearzi, Fortuna, &amp;amp; Reeves, 2009; Mann, Connor, Tyack, &amp;amp; Whitehead, 2000; Scott &amp;amp; 

Chivers, 1989; Wells &amp;amp; Scott, 1999). 

Bottlenose dolphins (Figure 1.1) are medium size odontocetes that can live more than 40 years. They 

present a greyish coloration dorsally and laterally, and a light coloration ventrally (Reynolds III, 

Wells, &amp;amp; Eide, 2000; Wells &amp;amp; Scott, 2008).The adult’s total length ranges from 2 meters to 4 meters, 

but the genus Tursiops presents geographical variation in morphology (Deharveng &amp;amp; Bedos, 2012; 

Reynolds III et al., 2000; Wells &amp;amp; Scott, 1999).

Dolphins evolved to adapt to the constraints of the marine environment. The fusiform body shape 

provides an efficient and fast way to swim, with modified appendages, and the respiratory system is 

modified compared to the terrestrial ancestors, which allowed the ability to dive and communicate 

(Reynolds III et al., 2000). Although there is no evident sexual dimorphism in adults, in some studies 

an individual is considered as female when observed regularly with a specific calf (Mann et al., 2000).  

The gestation period in Tursiops sp. lasts for 12 months, females give birth usually during spring-

summer months to a single calf with 84 cm to 140 cm (Deharveng &amp;amp; Bedos, 2012).

Bottlenose dolphins are  generalist predators, preying on fishes (such as mullets and European eel), 

cephalopods (squid and cuttlefish) and even crustaceans (Deharveng &amp;amp; Bedos, 2012; dos Santos, 

Coniglione, &amp;amp; Louro, 2007; Luís &amp;amp; dos Santos, 2012). 

In general, bottlenose dolphins form groups of 2-15 individuals. Nonetheless, there have been reports 

of groups with more than 1000 individuals. Group size varies according to biogeographic region, prey 

availability, activity and other factors. For example, in bays and estuaries these dolphins tend to form 

smaller groups in comparison with the offshore populations (Bearzi et al., 2009; Deharveng &amp;amp; Bedos, 

2012). 

Bottlenose dolphin societies are characterized by a fission–fusion dynamic, forming complex 

alliances. Individuals can associate in small groups that change in composition over time, and may 

depend on the social context, especially in relation to reproductive strategies, (to improve the 

individuals’ fitness) (Augusto, Rachinas-Lopes, &amp;amp; dos Santos, 2012; Connor &amp;amp; Krützen, 2015; Mann 

et al., 2000; Quintana-Rizzo, Mann, &amp;amp; Wells, 2006). Communication is a vital process to maintain 

long-term social ties, like the mother-calf bond, one of the strongest associations, or some long-term 

male-male alliances (Connor, Heithaus, &amp;amp; Barre, 2001; Harley, 2008; Quintana-Rizzo et al., 2006). 

Acoustic signals are the ideal form of communication in an aquatic environment, given that the 

acoustic energy propagates efficiently in water and offers a crucial advantage in turbid waters, where 

the visibility may be low, like shallow inshore waters, bays or estuary (Au &amp;amp; Hastings, 2008; Wells &amp;amp; 

Scott, 2008). 

The cetacean ear is much different from the other terrestrial mammals. Apparently does not exist a 

direct connection between the external canal and the tympanic membrane, so the sound is not 

conducted in the external auditory meatus to the inner ear as in other mammals. Norris (1967) 

proposed that sounds enter the dolphin’s head through the lower mandible and are transmitted to the 

middle and inner ears through the pan-bone window and the fat channel. (Au &amp;amp; Hastings, 2008).  

Tursiops truncatus has one of the widest auditory bandwidths of the cetacean species, hearing up to 

150 kHz. This species has a great capability to discriminate frequencies, which is important to detect 

and process acoustic signals, especially sonar echoes. The sound production is related with movements 

in the nasal muscles instead of being related with vocal cords in the larynx, like in humans and other 

mammals (Au &amp;amp; Hastings, 2008).  

With a highly developed acoustic system, cetaceans produce a wide variety of underwater signals, 

reflecting the major role of sound in the ecology and social life of these marine mammals. 

Communication can occur through vocal and nonvocal sounds, the latter being produced by percussive 

activity, like “tail slaps” (Au, Popper, &amp;amp; Fay, 2000; dos Santos, Louro, Couchinho, &amp;amp; Brito, 2005; van 

der Woude, 2009). 

Tursiops truncatus has a wide vocal repertoire that can be divided in three major categories of signals: 

unpulsed sounds (tonal), echolocation clicks and burst-pulsed signals. The burst-pulsed signals can be 

categorized as social sounds, functioning primarily for communication and have been linked to the 

social interactions of some species, while echolocation clicks serve for detection of the surrounding 

environment (Au &amp;amp; Hastings, 2008; Herzing &amp;amp; dos Santos, 2004; Luís, Couchinho, &amp;amp; dos Santos, 

2016; van der Woude, 2009; Wells &amp;amp; Scott, 2008). 

The tonal sounds which are omnidirectional, narrow-band and frequency-modulated, are known as 

whistles and their primary function is communication. The fundamental formant is between 3 kHz and 

15 kHz and harmonic components may extend above 40 kHz. Whistles can be highly stereotyped and 

individually specific, being used to communicate identity, location, and possibly emotional states. 



 

3 

 

Such stereotyped whistles are known as the “signature whistles” (Caldwell &amp;amp; Caldwell, 1965; Janik, 

2000b; Luís, Couchinho, &amp;amp; Dos Santos, 2015; Wells &amp;amp; Scott, 2008). 

Echolocation click trains, also pulsed signals are highly directional and are used in bio-sonar 

orientation and target detection (Figure 1.2). The animal emits clicks and obtains a sense of its 

surroundings from the echoes received. Dolphins and bats have specialized in this capability, which 

provides an advantage in surviving in habitats with low visibility. It can be used in navigation, 

foraging and other functions yet to be discovered (Au &amp;amp; Hastings, 2008; Wells &amp;amp; Scott, 2008). 

 

Figure 1.2 – Internal morphology of a bottlenose dolphin head and echolocation mechanism (adapted from:  Au, 

2008). 

 

Burst-pulses are also formed by broadband pulses, but these may be separated from the echolocation 

clicks due to the very short inter-click-intervals (ICI), less than 3 ms, and high repetition rate (above 

40 pulses per second). In sounds like creaks, squawks and grunts the clicks can’t be perceived 

individually and the packed clicks may prevent a functional sonar (Au &amp;amp; Hastings, 2008; Luís et al., 

2016; van der Woude, 2009). Although Herzing (1996) associated some burst-pulses with courtship or 

agonistic behaviour, the functional significance of these signals are yet to be fully understood (Au &amp;amp; 

Hastings, 2008; Herzing &amp;amp; dos Santos, 2004; Luís et al., 2016). 

In the extensive Tursiops truncatus repertoire there is a group of burst-pulses that can be combined to 

produce distinct vocal units, called bray series. These rhythmic vocalization sequences were firstly 

described by dos Santos et al. (1990). Since then it has been reported and studied in other populations 

around the globe (dos Santos, Ferreira, &amp;amp; Harzen, 1995; Gridley, Nastasi, Kriesell, &amp;amp; Elwen, 2015; 

Herzing, 2015; Janik, 2000a; López &amp;amp; Shirai, 2009). 

The temporal and structural patterns of the brays are yet to be clarified. These multi-unit signals may 

play a specific role within the vocal repertoire, which can differ according to the individual 

components in the bray series. Brays can be composed by grunts, squeaks and/or gulps (Gridley et al., 

2015; Luís, Alves, Couchinho, &amp;amp; dos Santos, 2017). In the resident population of the Sado estuary, 

bray production was recorded during social behaviour (dos Santos, Caporin, Moreira, Ferreira, &amp;amp; 

Coelho, 1990; Luís &amp;amp; dos Santos, 2012; Luís et al., 2017), and in Scotland, bray production was 

reported as food-related call, during the feeding on salmonids (Janik, 2000a; King &amp;amp; Janik, 2015).

The Sado estuary is located on the west coast of continental Portugal, between the city of Setúbal and 

the Tróia peninsula, and it is the main habitat of a population of bottlenose dolphins, one of the fewest 

resident populations in Europe (Coelho, 2016; dos Santos &amp;amp; Lacerda, 1987). Since the 80’s, several 

studies have been carried out in the region, about demography, ecology and ethology (Coelho, 2016; 

dos Santos et al., 2007, 1995; dos Santos &amp;amp; Lacerda, 1987; Gaspar, dos Santos, &amp;amp; Lacerda, 2003; 

Martinho, Pereira, Brito, Gaspar, &amp;amp; Carvalho, 2014), as well as acoustic communication of this 

resident population. Acoustic studies explore specific sounds in the wide repertoire of the species, 

such as whistles (dos Santos et al., 2005; Luís, Couchinho, &amp;amp; Dos Santos, 2015), pulsed sounds (Luís 

et al., 2016) or bray emissions (dos Santos et al., 1995; Luís &amp;amp; dos Santos, 2012; Luís et al., 2017).  

Concerning the conservation status, Tursiops truncatus is considered “least concern” by IUCN Red 

List (Hammond et al., 2012), although the proximity to human activities exposes bottlenose dolphins 

to numerous threats, such as pollution, habitat alteration, boat traffic, interactions with commercial and 

recreational fisheries, including bycatch mortality, and dolphin watch harassment (Mann et al., 2000). 

These factors, associated with apparent low recruitment, low reproductive rates and the ageing of the 

adults, present a great threat to the survival of resident populations, such as the one in Sado estuary 

(Gaspar, 2003; Mann et al., 2000). This community used to be composed by, at least 40 dolphins, but 

is currently reduced to 27 dolphins  (Augusto et al., 2012; Coelho, 2016; dos Santos &amp;amp; Lacerda, 1987).  

By describing the vocal repertoire of wild dolphins we are contributing to a better understanding of the 

function of dolphin vocalizations and their relation with the different activities. We can also be in a 

better position to evaluate the impacts of anthropogenic activities in the population and point out 

which ones are critical to the survival of a species or a population (Bearzi et al., 2009; Gridley et al., 

2015). 

Although the study of the acoustic emissions of bottlenose dolphins has been enriching to the 

understanding of the behaviour, it is still necessary to obtain quantitative correlations between sounds, 

behaviour activities and ecological circumstances (dos Santos et al., 1990), especially for the pulsed 

sounds. 

1.1 Objectives 

This work intends to explore the acoustic repertoire of a small resident bottlenose dolphin population 

in Sado estuary, Portugal. Specifically, it aims to expand the knowledge concerning burst-pulsed 

signals, focusing in the bray series, by identifying the factors, or set of factors, that may influence the 

emission of this type of vocalization, as well as the behaviour contexts associated.

2. Materials and Methods 

 

2.1. Study Area 

The Sado estuary is located on the Western continental coast of Portugal, between the city of Setúbal, 

on the north shore, and the Peninsula of Tróia. 

The river mouth is approximately 1.6 km wide. The estuary has two channels divided by sand and 

mud banks:  the South Channel is wider and deeper (maximum depth 25 meters) allowing larger ships 

to enter the estuary, while the North Channel has shallower waters (depths between 10-15 meters).  

The estuary presents a great ability to retain nutrients, with intense insolation which allows higher 

primary production rates and development of abundant and diversified food chains (Rocha, 2012). As 

a result, this estuary contains a variety of habitats and high biological richness. To protect the existing 

biodiversity and sources of biological productivity, in 1980, the upper estuary was established as 

protected area – The Sado Estuary Nature Reserve, figure 2.1 (Neves, Chozas, Costa, &amp;amp; Rufino, 

2004).

banks and the broken lines represent Marine Protected Areas and RNES (in Augusto et al. 2012). 

 

2.2. Data Collection 

Field recordings were made in the Sado estuary and adjacent coastal waters from an 8.40 m inboard 

motor vessel during light hours and with sea state ranging from 0 to 3 on the Beaufort scale. 



 

6 

 

Data collection went from March 2014 to April 2017, with 6 hours and 7 min of recordings, totalizing 

205 different samples, see figure 2.2. The boat-surveys were opportunistic. Once a group of dolphins 

was observed, a 15 minute habituation period was given.

The recordings were carried out with the research boat positioned about 500 m ahead of the group’s 

location, with the engines and batteries off. A Cetacean Research™ C55 hydrophone was placed at a 

depth of 5 m or, in case of shallower waters, 3 m. The hydrophone was connected to a Fostex FR-2 

digital recorder (Figure 2.3) (effective sensitivity of ?185 dB re 1V/1 ?Pa, frequency response of ±3 

dB in the 0.020-44 kHz band and +3/?13 dB in the 0.009-100 kHz band, polarized by a 9 V battery), 

using a high-pass filter of 100 Hz to decrease the effect of noise generated by the recording platform 

and low-frequency vibrations. All recordings were made at a 192 kHz sampling rate and with a 24-bit 

resolution, with the recording level fixed at the calibrated settings and the trim level at ?26 dB. The 

data was stored on Compact Flash memory cards as time-stamped wave files.

While recording, information about GPS position and depth was collected from the research vessel. 

Additionally, two experienced observers, retrieved data about the dolphin’s group composition, 

behavioural activity, surrounding vessels and other observations considered relevant. 

Based on dos Santos, 1998 and dos Santos et al., 2005, the behavioural activity was defined as 

follows: 

Travelling – Constant movement of a group in one direction, with synchronized diving;  

Foraging – Diversity of behaviours, characterised by sequences of short dives and surfacing in 

different directions; 

Feeding – Dive pattern similar to foraging, but more localized, with fish tossing, feeding 

circles or feeding splashes on the water surface; 

Socialization – Display of surface behaviour, animals engaging in physical contact with one 

another; absence of forward movement or prey; 

Resting – Individuals close to each other at the surface, with very slow movements or drifting 

in one direction. 

 

The following variables were selected: 

Location – Inside or outside the estuary, using range marker number five (38°29'12.00"N; 

8°55'21.60"W); 

Vessels – Presence and absence of vessels, in a 1000 m radius; 

Tide – Ebb tide and flood tide; 

Activity – Feeding, foraging, travel or socialization; 

Depth – Estimated using digital charts and the survey boat sounder; 

Group Size – number of individuals in the focal group.u

2.3. Acoustic Analysis 

Recordings were inspected by two trained independent observers, aurally and visually, using Raven 

Pro 1.4 (Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY) with Hann windows of 512 points Fast Fourier 

Transform (FFT), frequency resolution of 375 Hz and 50% overlap, in order to identify and classify 

the all vocalizations present in each recording. 

Signals were assigned to one of the following pre-established categories, according to their graphical 

and aural characteristics (see appendix A):  

I) Tonal sounds: whistles – narrow-band and modulated signals.  

II) Pulsed sounds:  

Click trains – discernible click trains, broad band and short duration;  

Creaks – long burst-pulse (&gt;0.2 sec.), aurally similar to a creaking door;  

Squawks – long burst-pulse (&gt;0.2 sec.), with higher repetition rate than “Creaks”, 

identical to a crying baby;  

TTV – Variable Rate Click Trains, may contain discernible clicks, creaks and squawks 

with high repetition rate; 

Short Burst-Pulses (S-BP) – short burst-pulse (&lt;0.2 sec.), aurally similar to a buzzing 

bee but brief;  

Bangs – isolated high energy pulsed sound;  

Grunts – trains of intense burst-pulses, acoustically similar to pig grunts;  

Gulps – low-frequency, short-pulse, identical to a sob;  

Squeaks – short burst-pulse with a harmonic structure, shrill sound like a scream;  

Bray series – rhythmic vocalization composed by different pulsed sounds, such as, 

gulps, grunts and squeaks, with a variable composition and structure.  

 

All the identified sounds were rated based on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR): 1 – poor-signal and hardly 

visible on the spectrogram, 2 – fair-signal, visible and with a clear start/end on the spectrogram, and 3 

– good-signal, well-marked and with a clear start/end on the spectrogram.  

Sounds that compose the brays series, grunts, gulps and squeaks with a SNR of 2 and 3 were selected 

for further analysis. 

Each bray sequence was defined using a 0.6 s bout criterion interval (BCI), to separate the end of the 

first sequence and the beginning of a second one (Luís, in prep.), see appendix B for more 

information.

2.4. Statistical Analyses 

For the analyses of vocalization occurrences, emission rates were computed dividing the number of 

vocalizations by the number of minutes of each sample. 

A Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with a Binomial Negative Regression Model was used to predict 

the expected value of bray emission rate (the response variable) as a linear combination of a set of 

observed variables (the predictors), i.e. to determine which predictors had a significant effect on the 

bray emissions. 

The statistics analyses were made in RStudio, Inc., using the nortest, fBasics, MASS and pscl 

packages. 

For more information see appendix C.

Brays series’ elements were common elements in 2014-2017 recordings: Gulps (12%), Grunts (11%) 

and Squeaks (5%). 

Click Trains (38%) and Whistles (21%) were the most frequent vocalizations, and short burst-pulses 

(&lt;1%) were the least frequent, see Figure 3.1.

3.2. Emission Rates 

The vocal elements that compose bray sequences were not frequently emitted isolated (Figure 3.3). 

 

 

Figure 3.3 - Bray Series Elements, emitted singly and in sequence . 

 

 

The emission rate of bray sequences did not follow a normal distribution (The Lilliefors (Kolmogorov-

Smirnov) normality test, p-value &amp;lt;0.001) and included an excess of zeros, with 0.75±1.97 mean and 

3.9 variance. Therefore, the model that best fit the data series was Negative Binomial Distribution as 

shown in figure 9, according to the Akaike Criteria (AIC) – 351.7. (For more details see the Appendix 

C)

According to the GLM, group size, depth, location, vessels and tide were not associated with the 

emission rate of bray series (Table 3.3). The only variable that was a significant predictor of bray 

occurences was activity pattern. 

Foraging, feeding and socialization showed significant higher counts than travelling. The expected 

count for foraging was 1.63 higher than the expected count for travelling (the reference group), 

feeding activity is 2.13 higher and socialization activity is 2.06 higher (see Table 3.3 below).

4. Discussion 

 

Bottlenose dolphins are social animals, characterized by a fission–fusion dynamic social structure in 

which communication is a critical key to the formation of alliances. These animals present an 

extensive vocal repertoire that can be divided in tonal sounds, echolocation clicks and burst-pulsed 

signals. The vocalizations can have multiple context-specific functions and studies on cetacean sound 

production suggest a signal and functional flexibility (Deharveng &amp;amp; Bedos, 2012; Gridley et al., 2015; 

Simard et al., 2011). 

In this study we have focused on the environmental influences and behavioural context of the emission 

of bray series. The results showed that group size, depth, location, vessels and tide had no effect on the 

emission rate of bray series, only the activity pattern is significantly related to the number of bray 

sequences. 

Echolocation clicks and whistles are the most frequent vocalizations produced by dolphins. This can 

be related to the fact that these animals, while in foraging activities, are able to emit whistles and sonar 

clicks simultaneously, possibly communicating the presence of food to other dolphins (King &amp;amp; Janik, 

2015; Ridgway, Samuelson Dibble, Van Alstyne, &amp;amp; Price, 2015). 

Previous studies show that whistles often occur in all activity patterns, especially when involving a 

high level of arousal. The primary function of this signal is communication and it plays an important 

role in maintaining contact between dispersed individuals of a population (dos Santos et al., 1990; 

Janik, 2000a; López &amp;amp; Shirai, 2009; Luís et al., 2015). Click Trains are used as bio-sonar orientation 

and target detection signals. These sounds are also present in all activities, having a major role in the 

perception of the environment and prey location. The Sado estuary usually has low underwater 

visibility, and dolphin would be expected to rely more on active echoloction for prey location and 

capture (dos Santos et al., 1990; Herzing &amp;amp; dos Santos, 2004).  

The burst-pulses signals grunt, gulp and squeak are common vocal elements and frequently occur in 

bouts, forming the brays series. Temporal patterning of vocal elements in brays sequences is poorly 

defined in the literature (Gridley et al., 2015). This study used a bout criterion interval in order to 

define a bray sequence, allowing a quantitative approach. 

The functional role of this conspicuous vocalization has yet to be fully understood, though in this 

study it was possible to observe that dolphins emit bray series more frequently in several behavioural 

patterns, such as feeding, foraging, and socialization, and less in travelling. Brays are present in 

several populations of bottlenose dolphins. Janik (2000a), suggested that the low – frequency structure 

of the brays in the dolphin’s population in Moray Firth, NE Scotland, occurs within a feeding context, 

primarily on the prey manipulation of a large fish such as Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Hastie et al. 

(2006) study also came to the same conclusion, when the dolphins surface with large fish during the 

bray emissions. 

King &amp;amp; Janik (2015), associated the bray emissions, considered food-related calls, with whistles, 

suggesting a social component and, in the absence of signs of aggression, that these calls are affiliative 

and helps in transmitting information to conspecifics. 

Another study, in the Bahamas, showed that brays occurred during social behaviours, specifically 

during male fighting and female persecution, suggesting a competitive/agonistic context (Herzing, 

2015). 



 

17 

 

Bray series are a recurrent vocalization type of the Sado estuary bottlenose dolphin population and 

have been reported in several studies since described by dos Santos et al. (1990) (dos Santos et al., 

1995; Luís &amp;amp; dos Santos, 2012; Luís et al., 2017; Rocha, 2012). 

Based on previous studies of this population (Luís &amp;amp; dos Santos, 2012), higher emission rates were 

expected during feeding and foraging activities, however it was not possible to determine if it is a cue 

to conspecifics as suggested by King &amp;amp; Janik (2015) or as manipulating prey behaviour (Janik, 

2000a). 

Bray sequences are frequently composed by grunts that have been described as aggressive calls 

(Herzing, 2015; Luís &amp;amp; dos Santos, 2012). The data did not allow to establish bray emissions as an 

agonistic display during socialization or as a competitive behaviour during feeding when the target 

prey is not abundant. However, it certainly remains possible that these emissions are mostly agonistic. 

Bray series emissions are lowest during travelling activities. This result was expected since this is low 

interaction activity and dolphins often move in silence (dos Santos et al., 1990). 

Each bray sequence presents a variable structure and composition, not all element are present and the 

order is mutable (Deharveng &amp;amp; Bedos, 2012; dos Santos et al., 1995; Santos, Luís, &amp;amp; Couchinho, 

2013). The different combinations could indicate that this type of sound is used in multiple contexts in 

the wild (Herzing, 2015). The ecological and social contexts where the bray emissions were higher are 

more complex and have a more diversified motivational states dynamic, than the context of travelling 

behaviour (dos Santos et al., 2005). 

Previous studies found that in the presence of vessels, dolphins may change their emission rates, 

(Buckstaff, 2004; Luís, Couchinho, &amp;amp; dos Santos, 2014; Rocha, 2012). Vessel noise propagates well 

underwater, within hearing range of the dolphins, and dolphins in the estuary are constantly exposed to 

boat traffic, which could make it possible for dolphins to predict the vessels course (Lusseau, 2006). 

Lemon et al. (2006), revealed that dolphins in Jervis Bay, Australia, change their surface behaviour in 

nearby powerboats, however it did not appear to have an impact in their acoustic behaviour. It might 

be that coastal dolphins were able to detect incoming vessels at varying distances and adapted their 

behaviour accordingly. In this study, significant differences in bray series emission were not found in 

the presence of nearby vessels, a possible explanation could be due to fact that dolphins were able to 

detect incoming vessels or that episodes with bray series emission are motivationally intense, and 

dolphins ignore passing vessels, even though they were aware of any vessel in their immediate 

environment. 

Philpott et al. (2007) found that acoustic emissions of a bottlenose dolphin’s population in Shannon 

estuary, Ireland, were associated to tidal state, with more acoustic emissions in the 4 h after high 

water, possibly reflecting prey-related changes in habitat use. These results differ from observations in 

the Sado estuary population, which may represent a geographic variation in the diet (Deharveng &amp;amp; 

Bedos, 2012; Hanson &amp;amp; Defran, 1993). Another explanation could be the fact that the study in 

Shannin estuary only considers one type of vocalization and not the whole repertoire. 

Hanson &amp;amp; Defran (1993) study found that the dolphins they studied in the San Diego area spent more 

time feeding in the estuary and in shallower waters, where it might be easier to find and capture prey, 

like the Sado estuary population (dos Santos et al., 2007). Whereas feeding is an arousal activity, 

which could explain higher emissions of the characteristics vocal elements, such as bray series. It was 

expected that the number of bray sequences would change depending on whether the dolphins were 

inside or outside of the estuary. However there was no evidence of this pattern, maybe beacause most 

of recordings (85%) were made inside the estuary, so it is possible that the variable location was not a 

significant predictor of bray emissions. 



 

18 

 

Some studies revealed that dolphins produce more vocalizations when group size increases and, may 

also depend on the behavioural activity (Henderson, Hildebrand, &amp;amp; Smith, 2011; Nowacek, 2005). In 

our study, there was no evidence that this happens with bray vocalizations, as was reported for the 

same population by similar studies, such as Luís &amp;amp; dos Santos (2000). The high levels of background 

noise may be related to this result. In a noisy habitat, like Sado estuary, each individual may limit its 

vocal emissions to avoid overlapping and to facilitate the transmittion of the emitted signals, 

improving the improve communication efficiency (Luís et al., 2015). 

Analysing the influence of depth in the emission rate of brays, Hastie et al. (2006) observed that 

dolphins were braying during feeding events, as diving from the surface to depths close to the seabed 

(mostly between 20 and 30 meters), and were subsequently returning to the surface after the brays. In 

the present study the described behaviour was not observed, maybe due to the fact that depth was 

estimated using the boat sounder. In order to retrieve a more accurate conclusion about the depths at 

which brays were emitted, the method described in Hastie et al. (2006) consisting in a vertical array of 

hydrophones in the water column, to reveal more detailed depth distribution of dolphin vocalisations, 

could be applied. 

 

4.1. Final Remarks 

Bottlenose dolphins exhibit large degrees of behavioural plasticity, both within and between 

populations, including differences in the vocal repertoires. Not all population vocal emissions are 

affected by the same variables, such as the ones studied in the present project. 

Bray series are a conspicuous component of bottlenose dolphins’ repertoire. This quantitative analysis 

shows significant differences in bray series emission between arousal events, such as socialization, 

feeding and foraging, and calm activities, like travelling.  

Future studies should acquire more data on feeding, foraging and socialization activities, to understand 

if bray emissions are more related to affiliative or agonistic functions, as well as to study the 

association of these calls with other vocalizations. A more detailed analysis of behavioural context 

using simultaneous underwater video and acoustic recording equipment could be a valuable advantage 

to shed light on the functionality of the bray series, although the application of this method in the Sado 

estuary is difficult due to the low visibility. Other variables that were not possible to add to this study, 

such as prey abundance, could be a key to a better understanding about the influence of environmental 

factors and should be explored in future studies.

Bray Sequence Definition 

 

Bray series’ are vocalizations composed by different vocal elements, such as gulps, grunts, and 

squeaks. 

In order to define each sequence the silent gaps were plotted using a log-frequency analysis, and bout 

criterion interval (BCI) was applied (Sibly, Nott, &amp;amp; Fletcher, 1990) to define each sequence, using 

only recordings without the noise of vessels. The silent gaps were measured by subtracting the end 

time of the first element from the start time of the second element. 

Bray series’ elements were identified in 26.2 % of the recordings. 

The majority of bray series’ elements were recorded in sequences with very short silent gaps: 58% of 

all elements were recorded with intervals less than 300 ms in between. Signal overlapping was 

observed on 6.7% of the emissions. Log-frequency analysis confirmed the bout structure of these 

emissions (Figure 6.1). A total of 130 sequences were identified.

structure of bray sequences. Bout criterion interval (BCI) estimated at 0.6 seconds.

Appendix C   

Statistical Models Analysis 

 
When it comes to modelling counts (numbers greater than or equal to 0), the Poisson regression is 

often used. This is a generalized linear model where a response is assumed to have a Poisson 

distribution conditional on a weighted sum of predictors (Bispo &amp;amp; Pinto, 2008; Rose, Martin, 

Wannemuehler, &amp;amp; Plikaytis, 2006; Zeileis, Kleiber, &amp;amp; Jackman, 2008).   

A Poisson distribution is parameterized, the mean and variance are equal, but usually the distribution 

of the counts does not present this characteristic. There is under- or over dispersion, depending if the 

variance is smaller or larger than the mean, consequently the performance of a Poisson regression on 

count data that exhibits this behaviour results and the excess of zeros in a model that won’t fit well 

(Bispo &amp;amp; Pinto, 2008; Rose et al., 2006; Zeileis et al., 2008).  

There are several models that approach hese problems. The Negative Binomial Regression (NB), that 

belong to the family of generalized linear models (GLM’s) and zero-augmented models, Hurdle 

models that combine a left-truncated count component with a right-censored hurdle component and 

the Zero-inflation models mixture models that combine a count component and a point mass at zero 

(Bispo &amp;amp; Pinto, 2008; Rose et al., 2006; Zeileis et al., 2008). 

 

Descriptive analysis 

The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, used for a number of samples superior to 50 (n&gt;50), shown that the 

bray emission rate does not follow a normal distribution, once that the p-value &amp;lt;0.001. Indicating that 

the null hypothesis (H0 = the variable presents a normal distribution) should be rejected. 

 

 
Figure 6.2 - Frequency distribution for No. bray sequences/min 

 

 



 

36 

 

The exploratory analysis presents a variance (3.9) that is higher than the mean (0.75) of the dependent 

variable, indicating an over dispersion problem, as shown in Figure 6.3.  

 

 

 
Figure 6.3 - Mean and Variance of the dependent variable - No. bray sequences/min. 

 

Model analysis 

When observing the number of bray sequences/ minute distribution graphic (Figure 6.2) it is evident 

the high number of zero counts. Also, there is a problem of over-dispersion (Figure 6.3), the variance 

is larger than the mean. Considering these problems, the Poisson Regression Model is inadequate.   

By comparing the estimated frequencies of various models (dashed lines in the Figure 6.4) with the 

frequencies observed, it is possible to perceive the model global fitting to the data. This was made to 

Poisson regression Model, Negative Binomial Regression Model (NB), Zero Inflated Poisson Model 

(ZIP) and Hurdle model – Negative Binomial (HNB). Using the using the MASS and pscl packages, in 

RStudio, Inc. (Figure 6.4). 

In the figure 6.4, as in table 6.1, it is possible to observe that the Poisson regression Model 

underestimates the zero counts and overestimates the values of other counts, not being well adjusted. 

The ZIP, the NB and the HNB estimated zero count appear to adjust to the observed zeros. Although 

the ZIP model underestimate the other count values, so this is not the best adjusted model. 

The NB and the NHB present similar estimate counts to the observed counts, presenting a good 

adjustment to the data.

Table 6.2 - Adjustment Statistics:  logLik – log-likelihood; df – degrees of freedom; AIC - Akaike Criteria. 

 
 

When analysing the fit statistics (Table 6.2) the models based on a Negative Binomial Distribution 

presents better adjustment. NB and HNB present the lowest AIC values (358 and 366 respectively) 

and higher log-likelihood values (NB = -171; HNB = -168). 

The Negative Binomial Model was considered adequate because it addresses the overdispersion as a 

temporal dependency and/or unobserved heterogeneity (Rose et al., 2006; Zeileis et al., 2008)
