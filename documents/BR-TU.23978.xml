AKNOWLEDGEMENTS 

 

After 4 years, I believe that the most difficult part was not to discuss my dataset, but 

trying to remember all the people that helped me along the way. Therefore, I ask in advance, 

please forgive me if your name is not cited in these next lines. Nevertheless, if you did 

anything, does not matter how small it was, to help me achieve the results exposed in this text, 

know that I own you a life debt, even if I do not remember it. 

First of all, I want to thank FAPESP for the scholarships, under processes 2013/08736-

6 and 2014/05738-0, that allowed this project to become true. 

Secondly, but not less, I would like to thank my family, my parents, Edison and Izabel, 

my brother and sister, Ricardo and Erica, my sister in law, Maria, as well as my nephew and 

niece, Giacomo and Isabel, for soften  my life during such hard years. 

To “older” friends of the Soil Science department, Osvaldo, Sueli, Sâmala, Getúlio,

To the whole class of 2005 from the best Unesp campus in the world, thank you for 

being part of my early career years, that prepared me for this moment. Special thanks to 

Rufião and Salsicha, whom made my time in Piracicaba to look like it was just a continuation 

of my undergrad period. 

Thanks to Erreinaldo and everybody at the LPV for allowing me to use their area for 

my experimentation, and for giving me support every time that I needed.

We are coming to an end. Again, hope your name was cited here, if not, know that only 

four names are in my mind now. I know what you are thinking - “you ungrateful b…!”. Well, 

get over it and let us continue. 

First, I would like to thank Virginia and Gonzalo for all the good moments. But 

especial thanks must be given to Virginia. If you can see 12 beautiful and long tables along 

this text, filled with the most interesting data about surface sealing and all that science stuff, is 

because she organized those tables. I have to say, is not every day that you have an intern with 

a Master degree working for you. 

Secondly, I would like to thank Rodrigo Zenero. Without your work, there would be no 

thesis. Normally, we do not read about problems in the final work. However, I must declare 

that, if in this world, demons and evil creatures are real, part of them must live inside 

electrical devices. And a half of the population live inside our “dear” MicroRelief Meter. You 

should be canonized for being able to make it finish my readings when I most needed it. 

Thirdly, thanks to my advisor, Dr. Miguel Cooper. After four years, you have learned 

how stubborn I can be. And, even so, during all this time you gave me your support and 

advise. I cannot say that I changed, but I sure have matured during the time working with you. 

Hope to continue our partnership in the years to come. 

And last, but not least. During the last years I am getting more and more certain that 

there is no supreme being in the middle of the universe controlling our lives. No master in the 

universe. No after, just now. However, I cannot deny the faith of my parents, that, by holding 

them up, it kept me strait on my path. At the same time, a dear friend of mine, already thanked 

previously, gave me good moments of discussion about God, life and its mysteries, during 

this last semester. The overall lesson that I take from it all, is that we born, live, and die, 

without knowing nothing for sure. Doubt, as logic, is the very essence of the human race. So, 

if I do not even know it for sure if multifractal parameters do really mean something, whom 

am I to deny the existence of something? Thus, in the name of my parents, I thank their God, 

who, by making them happier in some way, made me a blessed man.

RESUMO 

 

Parametrização quantitativa da estrutura da superfície do solo em volumes crescentes 

de chuva 

 

O estudo da estrutura do solo permite inferências sobre seu comportamento. Parâmetros 

quantitativos são comumente utilizados na avaliação da estrutura e os multifractais ainda são 

subutilizados na ciência do solo. Alguns estudos mostraram relação entre parâmetros 

multifractais com a diminuição da rugosidade superficial do solo devido à chuva e a 

heterogeneidade do sistema poroso. No entanto, uma assinatura multifractal relacionada a um 

comportamento específico do solo ainda não está estabelecida. Portanto, os objetivos desta 

pesquisa foram: (i) relacionar parâmetros multifractais com mudanças na estrutura do solo por 

meio da análise de mapas de rugosidade superficial e de imagens 2D provenientes de blocos 

impregnados de solo; e (ii) utilizar estes parâmetros para identificar as etapas de degradação 

do solo devido ao selamento e encrostamento superficial. Um experimento com chuva 

simulada com intensidade de 120 mm h
-1

 foi montado em uma Nitossolo Vermelho 

eutroférrico argiloso em parcelas quadruplas onde aplicou-se volumes de 40, 80 e 120 mm, 

mais um controle sem-chuva. A evolução da rugosidade superficial foi avaliada em três 

escalas: um rugosímetro de campo (MRM) reuniu leituras numa grade fixa (10 x 10 mm, 

640000 mm²); um escâner com triangulação de lasers em multilinhas (MLT) foi usado em 

laboratório, sobre blocos de solo, criando uma grade aleatório (0,5 mm de resolução, 5625 

mm²); um tomógrafo de raios-X (XRT) reuniu leituras de um bloco de solo em uma grade fixa 

(0,074 x 0,074 mm, de 900 mm²). Para a análise micromorfométrica, amostras de solo 

indeformado (0,12 x 0,07 x 0,05 m) foram impregnadas, cortadas em blocos, polidas e 

subdivididas em três camadas (0 a 10 mm, 20 a 30 mm e de 40 a 50 mm), paralelas à 

superfície, tendo cinco imagens (ampliação de 10x, 156,25 µm
2
 pixel

-1
) geradas por camada. 

Após a segmentação, três imagens foram selecionadas por camada e o sistema poroso foi 

avaliado. Análises de rugosidade não mostraram diferenças (p &gt; 0.10) entre parâmetros 

multifractais nas medições da escala MRM, enquanto MLT e XRT puderam ser utilizadas 

para modelar a degradação da rugosidade com o aumento do volume de chuva. Como essas 

duas ultimas escalas apresentaram resultados similares, MLT poderia substituir o uso de XRT 

em tais análises, devido ao seu menor custo e possibilidade de cobrir área mais vasta durante 

as análises. O comportamento multifractal dos poros mudou de acordo com o 

desenvolvimento do selamento superficial e da camada avaliada, sendo sensitivo a mudanças 

no grau de fragmentação (número de poros) dentro de cada classe de tamanho de poros. As 

dimensões de Hausdorff a esquerda do espectro (Lf(?)min, L?f(?) and D2) tiveram relação 

linear com o aumento de volume de chuva para ambas medições de rugosidade superficial do 

solo e de área de poros. Entretanto, D2 não foi significativo (p &gt; 0.10) entre volumes de chuva 

para diferenciar a porosidade próxima a superfície, embora os parâmetros D0-D1, D0-D2 e 

D1-D2 pudessem ser utilizados para descrever mudanças nessa camada. Conclui-se que o 

espectro multifractal é sensível à mudanças estruturais no solo causadas pela chuva e que 

pode ser utilizado na parametrização da degradação da rugosidade superficial do solo e da 

porosidade.

ABSTRACT 

 

Quantitative parameterization of soil surface structure with increasing rainfall volumes 

 

The study of soil structure allows inferences on soil behavior. Quantitative parameters 

are oftentimes required to describe soil structure and the multifractal ones are still underused 

in soil science. Some studies have shown relations between the multifractal spectrum and both 

soil surface roughness decay by rainfall and porous system heterogeneity, however, a 

particular multifractal response to a specific soil behavior is not established yet. Therefore, the 

objectives of this research were: (i) to establish relations between multifractal parameters and 

soil structure changes by analyzing both soil surface roughness maps and 2D images from 

impregnated soil blocks; and (ii) to utilize these parameters to evaluate soil surface 

degradation by the processes of crusting and sealing. An experiment with simulated rainfall 

was assembled on a Fine Rhodic Kandiudalf with an intensity of 120 mm h
-1

 in quadruplicate 

plots at amounts of 40, 80, and 120 mm, plus a no-rainfall control. The evolution of the 

surface roughness was evaluated in three scales of measurement: a field microrelief meter 

(MRM) gathered readings on a fixed grid (10 x 10 mm, 640,000 mm²); a multistripe laser 

triangulation (MLT) scanner was used in the laboratory in soil blocks, creating a random 

mesh (0.5 mm of resolution, 5625 mm²); an X-ray tomography (XRT) scanner gathered 

readings of a soil block on a fixed grid (0.074 x 0.074 mm, 900 mm²). For 

micromorphometrical analysis, undisturbed soil samples (0.12 x 0.07 x 0.05 m) were 

impregnated, sliced in blocks and polished. Each block was divided into three layers (0 to 10 

mm, 20 to 30 mm and 40 to 50 mm), parallel to surface, and five images (10X magnification, 

156.25 µm
2
 pixel

-1
) were taken by layer. After segmentation, three representative images were 

chosen by layer and the pore system was evaluated. Roughness analyzes showed no 

differences (p &gt; 0.10) between multifractal parameters across rainfall amounts for MRM 

measurements, while both MLT and XRT could be used to model roughness degradation by 

rainfall increase. Since the last two scales presented similar results, MLT could replace XRT 

in such analysis, due to its lower cost and possibility of a larger area coverage. The 

multifractal behavior of pores changed according to sealing development and depth of 

measurement, being sensitive to the changes on size distribution and fragmentation degree 

(number of pores) within each size class. The Hausdorff dimensions at the left side of the 

spectrum (Lf(?)min, L?f(?) and D2) showed a linear behavior with increasing rainfall amount, 

considering both soil surface roughness and area of pores measurements. However, D2 was 

not different (p &gt; 0.10) along rainfalls for the porosity closer to surface, although parameters 

D0-D1, D0-D2 and D1-D2 could be used to described the changes in this layer. Was 

concluded that the multifractal spectrum is sensitive to structure changes caused by rainfall 

and that it can be used to parameterize both soil surface and pores degradation.

1 INTRODUCTION 

The description of the soil structure assists the understanding of its behavior in the 

environment, which is important to explain complex processes that occur in the soil, such as 

water and air movement, nutrient cycling and erosion. However, characterization of the 

structure must not depend only on its visual description if we want to logically describe the 

system. Particularly, to understand a physical process, a mathematical approach is very often 

the most appropriate, because it uses a logical organization of thoughts to explain the system. 

As a result, soil physicists rely on both mathematical and statistical modeling to describe 

processes in soil, and a range of indexes are used to characterize physical quality of a soil. 

In the last century, several methods were used to estimate numerical data, which were 

used to express soil structure regarding its stability and functioning. These methods are 

mainly based on direct measurements of one or more soil physical attributes that, after some 

mathematical reasoning are linked to a determined behavior. For instance, aggregates size 

distribution can be used to calculate the weighted mean diameter, which is commonly used to 

describe the stability of the soil structure. On the other side both pores size and shape 

distribution are associated to several flux equations and used to model both inputs and outputs 

in soil, which basically governs soil functioning. The association between stability and 

functioning dictates the physical quality of a soil, that may be addressed in different ways. For 

example, to achieve high crop productivity, the ideal relation between stability and 

functioning may not be the same as to the one to reduce erosion rates to a minimum. 

Therefore, the term soil physical quality can be ambiguous. This subject will be developed 

during the section 2.1.2 to clarify the objectives and the methodology used during this 

research. 

Nonetheless, since soil presents several functions on the ecosystem, which may lead to a 

range of indexes used to characterize it, it may be considered as a complex system. This 

brings up the importance of finding a parameter that relates to several soil attributes, allowing 

its interpretation in several areas of research. The fractal theory was broadly employed in the 

study of chaotic systems, such as turbulence, and in soil science it was used as a parameter to 

describe patterns of spatial distribution of different materials, from fungi and bacterial 

communities until scaling properties of soil aggregation, that interferes in both pores size and 

shape distribution. However, the range of interpretations that can be uniquely drawn from 

fractal results is very narrow. The main issue with interpretations only based in a fractal 

approach is to rely on a unique number so that it will describe several processes occurring at 

the same time. Thus, the fractal dimension of a dataset is often correlated to other variables 



 
 

14 

before conclusions can be made. In that sense, the multifractal approach allows more 

flexibility, as it will be scrutinized throughout this text, and a range of interpretations can be 

made without the need of other variables input. However, its use is still incipient in soil 

science. This fact may be associated to the multiplicity of parameters displayed by such 

analysis, many of whom still lack physical interpretation. 

Therefore, the objectives of this research were: (i) to establish relations between 

multifractal parameters and soil structure changes by analyzing both soil surface roughness 

maps and 2D images from impregnated soil blocks; and (ii) to utilize these parameters to 

evaluate soil surface degradation by the processes of crusting and sealing. 

The hypothesis tested were: i) The multifractal spectra is sensitive to structure changes 

caused by a range of rainfall amounts; ii) some multifractal parameters can be used to model 

the steps of soil surface degradation by rainfall.

2 DEVELOPMENT 

2.1 Literature review 

2.1.1 Analyses of complex systems: soil as a multifractal 

A complex system is one that presents a challenge against universal modeling. In other 

words, when it is difficult to find a suitable model to describe phenomena, because these 

occur in a system that has too many variables, we call this system complex (CHU, 2011). The 

fractal theory has aided the understanding of several complex systems where other 

mathematical approaches have shown to be laborious, or even erroneous. Because of that, a 

quick review of this theory is provided. 

 

2.1.1.1 Fractal theory 

In Mathematics, the dimension of a space can be described as the minimum set of 

coordinates to specify any points within it. The theory of measure, by Henri Labesgue, gives 

the notion of linear measure on a straight line, of plane measure on a bi-dimensional plane, of 

volume measure in three dimensional space (BESICOVITCH, 1928). Knowing that length 

exists not only in straight lines, but also in a space, Constantin Carathéodory defined the s-

dimension of a set in a q-dimensional space as any integer number considering q   s. This 

states the dimensions in a Euclidean space, which are always integer numbers 

(BESICOVITCH, 1928). 

With the development of the set theory and Georg Cantor’s idea of the existence of 

uncountable sets (an infinite of infinities), the Euclidean point of view, traced by general 

topology, changed and mathematicians proved the possibility of non-integer dimensions. 

Hausdorff (1919) using the axiomatic of set theory wrote a paper on his definitions of 

dimensions, and Besicovitch (1928, 1937) applied Hausdorff theorems on the description of 

sets of fractional dimensions. The definition is as follows, and can be similarly applied to 

higher dimensional spaces: considering a finite sequence of sets Ui (U1,U2,…,Un) that cover a 

set A (Ui   A) in a q-dimensional space (q equals a positive integer), and knowing di is the 

sequence (d1, d2,…, dn) of the diameters of Ui, which di   ?, and ? is a positive number, the s-

dimension of the measure A (s-dimA) can be defined as: 

          
   

   

  

  (1) 

In a linear set Besicovitch assumed three possibilities: (i) there exists 0      1, if 

     for           and        for          , then A is a s-dimensional set; (ii) 

if          for any     , then A is one-dimensional; (ii) if          for any 



 
 

16 

   , then A is 0-dimensional. This was called the Hausdorff dimension of a set and, due to 

the possibility of fractional dimensions, was useful to describe the geometry of some strange 

sets. 

To compute the dimension of an object is easier to calculate the Minkowski-Bouligand 

dimension, which is, in most occasions, similar to the Hausdorff dimension. A way to 

calculate this is to cover the object with boxes with different side lengths L. The relation 

between L and the number of boxes N(L) that cover the object follows a power law 

      
 

 
 
 

  (2) 

and, when L  , the boxes approximate the real shape and size of the object, 

expressing Equation 3. 

        
   

  
 

 
 
 

  (3) 

D is Minkowski-Bouligand dimension, also called the box-counting dimension, and   

is a proportionality constant that represents the number of initiators of the object. This 

equation can also calculate the topological dimension of lines, squares and cubes, but nothing 

prevents D of being a non-integer number. 

If the boxes are square, there is a scale relation when L decreases and a more 

insightful way of writing Equation 3 is: 

  
 

  
      

   
  

 

  
 
  

 (4) 

Where   
 

  
  is the number of boxes with size 

 

  
, and    is the scale factor. When   is 

1, D can be expressed by using logarithm in Equation 5, where we can calculate D by two 

forms, approximately, by the slope of the log log plot of   
 

  
  vs  

 

  
 , or exactly, by finding 

the limit of this function.

2.1.1.2 Fractals in Nature 

As stated before, the fractional dimension is not new in mathematics. However, its use 

to explain physical phenomena started only in 1967. By measuring the coast of several 

countries and continents in different scales, Richardson (1961) showed that conventional 

measurement techniques could give enormously distinct results, with lengths increasing 

rapidly according to the magnification of the scale. Based on plots of scale vs length, 



 
 

17 

Richardson saw a power law relation. Therefore, he used a log plotting to calculate the slopes 

of such relations and propose to use this parameter to distinguish the coastlines. 

Mandelbrot (1967) made a mathematical interpretation of Richardson’s measurements 

using Equation 3 as basis, considering that the number N(d) of segments of length d needed to 

walk across the coastline was proportional to (1/d)
D
, for some exponent D and a 

proportionality constant k (Equation 6).  

         
   

  
 

 
 
 

  (6) 

The length L( ) of the coastline would be equal to the sum of all d: 

              (7) 

Therefore, by joining Equations 6 and 7: 

        
   

         (8) 

Applying logarithms: 

           
   

                   (9) 

If the initiator is a unique line,    , and because its length would depend on the 

scale of measurement,   may be substituted by 
 

  
, where    is a scale factor, generating 

Equation 10: 

        
   

     
 
  
 

    
 
  
 

 (10) 

If the data points of Richardson’s log log plots lied along a straight line, the 

assumption on Equation 6 was justified, and Mandelbrot called the exponent D as the “fractal 

dimension” of the coastline, permitting Richardson's data to be interpreted by this value. This 

was the first proof that, at some scales, natural systems could be represented by a simple 

power law that relates the characteristics of an object to an exponent, which was considered as 

a dimension of the system. 

Mandelbrot used the term “fractal” to designate the objects that exhibit repeating 

patterns at different scales and did extensive work on reviewing, theorizing and describing 

such objects and their relations with physical systems. Such interpretations were impacting in 

the study of chaotic systems, since the fractal dimension helps to explain the scale relation of 

complex shapes, where details appear to contain more information than the general analysis of 

the object. Therefore, the fractal theory defines spatial and temporal models of systems that 



 
 

18 

exhibit a range of symmetry, characterized by a power law dependent on the number of 

repetitions of a given characteristic. 

 

2.1.1.3 Multifractal theory 

Although the fractal theory presents an easy way of characterize a system, complex 

structures of nature present variations that cannot be analyzed by a simple fractal model. In 

nature most of the processes are stochastic, and the mass distribution along the systems is not 

homogeneous. The multifractal analysis includes this density variation, which are expressed 

in a multifractal spectrum (CHHABRA et al., 1989; CHHABRA; JENSEN, 1989) that gives a 

quantitative description of a heterogeneous phenomenon (STANLEY; MEAKIN, 1988). 

Perfect and Kay (1995) describes the fractal dimension as “a non-integer dimension that 

determines the capacity of a generator in occupying a space” and Stanley and Meakin (1988) 

said a “…multifractal phenomena describes the concept that different regions of an object 

have different fractal properties”. Therefore, the multifractal approach brings much more 

information of a process that happens at different scales, since it considers the heterogeneity 

of the system. 

If a system presents areas of different densities, it means that at each step of its 

formation, different probabilities occurred at different regions. For example, in a volume of 

soil, the formation of soil aggregates occurs at different amounts in each region, and areas 

with higher concentration of solids are going to present morphology different to areas with 

higher porosity. This shows that the distribution of probabilities of the mass along the object 

can be used to describe the system and to interpret the system’s organization. 

Once again recurring to the counting-box technique, the mass probability of the ith 

box       can be considered as the ratio between the number of points with mass of the ith 

box       and the total mass of the system  . 

        
     

 
 (11) 

Smaller the box size, smaller is the mass contained in that box compared to the rest of 

the image. Therefore, there is a dependence between       and L, decreasing the probability 

of each box with the decreasing of L, which may be expressed by a power law. 

         
   (12) 

   is called the Lipschitz-Holder exponent, or the strength of singularity (CHHABRA; 

JENSEN, 1989). This exponent characterizes the scale in the ith region or spatial location and 

can be interpreted as the local behavior of       in the center of a box with diameter L 



 
 

19 

(POSADAS et al., 2003). We can calculate   
 
by Equation 10 and, because the probability 

measures the fraction of the points that occupy a region, we think of this ratio as a dimension. 

       
   

        

      
 (13) 

Because of a logarithm property, smaller probabilities gives higher values of   , being 

the contrary true. Since    turns into a local exponent when    , and similar values can be 

found in different regions (boxes) of the system, the measure is called a “multifractal” 

(PARISI et al., 1985), exhibiting a range of power laws (Equation 11). 

        
 

 
 
    

 (14) 

The number of boxes      where       has exponents      is proportional to the 

inverse of the box size   and to an exponent f(?), which is the Hausdorff dimension of a set of 

boxes having the same strength singularity and can be loosely defined as a set of "fractal 

dimensions". Plotting f(?) vs ? we obtain a parabolic curve, with concavity up, known as the 

singularity spectrum, or the multifractal spectrum of the object. As cited by Chhabra and 

Jensen (1989) this curve “…provides us with a precise mathematical description of the 

multifractal behavior of a data set of an object”. 

Due to difficulties in direct computation of f(?), various methods where proposed to 

obtain it. Two main methods will be described here: the Legendre transformation of the ?(q) 

curve and the use of partition function        . 

 

2.1.1.3.1 Legendre transformation of ?(q) 

From Equation 11 is possible to note a conservation of probability: 

      

 

   

   (15) 

Rearranging Equations 11 and 15, and adding a distortion exponent   to evaluate the 

behavior of the distribution of mass in the measure, we get to the Equation 16 (BENZI et al., 

1984): 

      
 

 

   

  
      

 
   

 

 
 (16) 

We note that the distortion depends on the L size of the box, and it follows a power 

law (MANDELBROT, 1974; HENTSCHEL; PROCACCIA, 1983; BENZI et al., 1984):  



 
 

20 

      
 

 

   

        (18) 

Where      is a non-linear function of   if the fractal is not uniform, i.e. in the case of 

a multifractal measure, and it relates to an infinite number of generalized dimensions    as 

showed by Hentschel and Procaccia (1983): 

             (19) 

Joining Equations 19 and 18, applying logarithms and limit, so    , we get the 

definition of the generalized dimensions used by Hentschel and Procaccia (1983): 

   
 

   
   
   

          
     

   

    
 (20) 

The slope of the curve           is  :  

  
  

  
 (21) 

And due to the non-linearity of      there exists a range of    from which there are 

equivalent intercepts       (  =1,2,…,N): 

            (22) 

Thus, using the Legendre transformations of the           curve is possible to get an 

          spectrum. 

 

2.1.1.3.2 Partition function           

Chhabra and Jensen (1989) proposed a direct method to determine the      spectrum, 

without recurring to the Legendre transformations. For this, they used the comparison of the 

distortion of the mass probabilities over the sum of all boxes at this size (Equation 23). 

        
  
 

  
 
     

   

 (23) 

Using a relationship between the Hausdorff dimension and Shannon’s entropy, 

Equation 22 can generate Equations 24 and 25. 

        
   

                     
    
   

    
 (24) 

 

        
   

                   
    
   

    
 (25) 



 
 

21 

Considering the intervals where the linear correlation between the numerators of 

equations 23 and 24 vs      is high, we can estimate the f(?) spectrum. 

 

2.1.1.3.3 Multifractal spectrum parameters 

The f(?) spectra presents a convex parabolic shape, from where several parameters are 

known (Figure 1). The maximum Hausdorff dimension (f(?)max) occurs at q = 0 and it is 

known as the capacity or the box counting fractal dimension (D0), representing the global 

information or system average (VOSS, 1988). When the Hausdorff dimension equalizes the 

Lipschitz-Holder exponent (f(?) = ?), q is 1 and this is called the entropy dimension (D1), 

since is related to the Shannon entropy (SHANNON; WEAVER, 1949). When q is 2, f(?) is 

mathematically associated with the correlation function (HENTSCHEL; PROCACCIA, 1983) 

and represents the correlation of the measures contained in a L size box, being called 

correlation dimension (D2). If a process is indeed multifractal, these sorts as D2 ? D1 ? D0 

(HENTSCHEL; PROCACCIA, 1983). 

 

Figure 1 – Schematic of a multifractal spectrum and graphical interpretations of the capacity dimension (f(?)max 

=D0) and the entropy dimension (f(?)?? =D1). 

 

 

Other parameters can be assessed from the spectrum and their physical interpretation 

may help describe soil structure changes (Figure 2). 



 
 

22 

 
Figure 2 – Schematic of a multifractal spectrum and parameters that can be estimated: Rf(?)min: minimum 

Hausdorff dimension at right of D0; Lf(?)min: minimum Hausdorff dimension at left of D0; ?Rf(?): 

range of Hausdorff dimensions at right of D0; ?Lf(?): range of Hausdorff dimensions at left of D0; 

f(?)ratio: ratio between ?Rf(?) and ?Lf(?); ?min: minimum Lipschitz-Holder exponent; ?max: maximum 

Lipschitz-Holder exponent; ??: the complete range of Lipschitz-Holder exponents; ?R?: range of 

Lipschitz-Holder exponents at right of D0; ?L?: range of Lipschitz-Holder exponents at left of D0; 

?ratio: ratio between ?R? and ?L? 

 

The minimum Hausdorff dimension at left of D0 (Lf(?)min) is related to positive range of 

q’s, so it can be interpreted as the fractal dimension of areas presenting higher probabilities. 

The range between D0 and the Lf(?)min (?Lf(?)) represents how uniform the fragmentation 

process occurs at areas with higher probabilities, and values closer to 0 may show a 

homogeneous process, or one dominated by smaller probabilities. Similarly, the minimum 

Hausdorff dimension at right of D0 (Rf(?)min) represents the fractal dimensions of areas with 

smaller probabilities, and the range between this and D0 (?Rf(?)) shows the diversity of 

dimensions of these areas. While the ordinate axe relates to the fragmentation process at 

different ranges of probabilities, the Lipschitz-Holder exponent (?) shows how probabilities 

change along scales. Thus, its minimum (?min) shows how the distribution changes over scale 

in areas of higher density, and its maximum (?max) how it happens for the areas with lower 

density. The range at left and at right of ?(D0) (?L? and ?R?) indicate which class changes 

more over scale when compared to the systems’ mean. The whole range (??) represents how 

diverse the system is along scales. Both ratios (f(?)ratio and ?ratio) relates the behavior of areas 

with small probabilities to those with high probabilities, and show which class is more 



 
 

23 

fragmented and changes more across scale, respectively. They are calculated according to 

Equations 26 and 27.

2.1.1.4 Fractal and multifractal applications in soil science 

Fractal techniques have been used in soil science as an alternative to conventional 

geometry (PACHEPSKY et al., 1996; GIMENEZ et al., 1997). The fractal dimension 

assumes that a soil property is scale dependent and can be represented by a power law. In soil 

biology it was used in evaluation of mycelial morphology of different fungi species (BODDY 

et al, 1999). In the soil chemistry area, Rice and Lin (1993) were the first to evaluate the 

fractal nature of humic materials, followed by Senesi (1999), Rizzi et al. (2004) and Fedotov 

and Shoba (2013). Also Rice et al. (1999) and Sokolowska et al. (2009) considered patterns of 

the distribution of soil organic matter. Fractal dimensions were also used in many other areas 

of soil chemistry, e.g., as a parameter to estimate cation exchange capacity (ERSAHIN et al., 

2006; BAYAT et al., 2014), to evaluate mineral dissolution (GUARRACINO et al., 2013), 

nitrogen adsorption isotherms (PAZ FERREIRO; WILSON; VIDAL VÁZQUEZ, 2009), soil 

metal contamination (GERANIAN; MOKHTARI; COHEN, 2013), amongst others. 

The field of soil physics is where the use of fractal analysis started, and, because of that, 

is the area with most vast use for such theory. It started in the analysis of soil particles 

distribution (ORFORD; WHALLEY, 1983), and have been widely used until today for the 

same purpose (TYLER; WHEATCRAFT, 1992; STANCHI et al, 2006, BIEGANOWSKI et 

al., 2013; PENG et al., 2014). In the analysis of the structure Turcotte’s (1986) paper on soil 

fragmentation was a pioneer, while publications by Young and Crawford (1991), and 

Crawford, Sleeman and Young (1993), are the classical base for fractal modeling of 

aggregates size distribution. In the field of pore analysis its use was really expanded, 

especially considering the image analysis of soil pore systems. The first work considering the 

pore system was the one from Rieu; Sposito (1991), and was followed for more than 30 

publications on the same subject, considering methodological problems and specific 

applications. There are several review papers about fractal under the structure scope. 

Ghanbarian-Alavijeh et al. (2011) reviewed the pore-solid-fractal approach; Perfect and Kay 



 
 

24 

(1995) the applications in soil and tillage researchs. All things considered, the fractal theory 

was, and still have been, well explored in soil science. 

However, the fractal approach characterizes the mean properties of a dataset and cannot 

provide information on average behavior deviations of a power law (POSADAS et al., 2003). 

The multifractal analysis includes density variations and can be expressed in a multifractal 

spectrum (CHHABRA et al., 1989; CHHABRA; JENSEN, 1989), which integrates and 

quantifies the spatial properties of the studied object (POSADAS et al., 2003). The 

multifractal tool is much newer if compared to the fractal approach, especially applied to the 

soil science field. For example, during the literature review for this research, it was found 10 

papers which used multifractal analysis for particle size distribution, 4 in the analysis of soil 

structure and 21 considering the pore system, being 5 about water retention modeling. The 

respective number of papers considering the fractal applications were 19, 46, 27 and 45. 

Some parameters of the multifractal spectrum are well known and related to the 

heterogeneity of the porous system (POSADAS et al., 2003). However, due to its still 

incipient use in soil science, soil properties leading to a multifractal behavior are not 

established yet, which makes the interpretation of soil multifractal parameters an important 

subject of investigation. 

 

2.1.2 Definition of soil physical quality – stability and functioning 

The description of any system demands the creation of an ordered list of parameters 

with specific definitions that allows us to explain each step of the phenomena occurring in 

such system. Let us take as example the term “soil science”. Before knowing its significance, 

it is necessary to define separately what is “soil” and what is “science”. Soil (from Latin 

solum, Anglo-French soy and Middle-English soile, meaning “ground”) can be defined as a 

triphasic (consisting of air, liquids and solids) and tridimensional body that occupies the 

Earth’s surface. It is bordered by the atmosphere above, the lithosphere below and by water 

bodies laterally (i.e. lakes, rivers, seas and oceans) and beholds life. Its genesis arises from the 

interaction between a parental material with climate and organisms over time, being affected 

by the relief. Science (from Latin scientia, meaning "knowledge") is a systematic enterprise 

that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions 

about the universe. Science is also associated with the scientific method itself, which the 

Oxford English Dictionary (2015) defines as "a method or procedure … consisting in 

systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and 

modification of hypotheses". Thus, “soil science” can now be defined as a systematic 



 
 

25 

organization of the knowledge achieved of the subject “soil” by experimentation. It is 

developed by the study of soil as a natural resource of the surface of the Earth, based on the 

description of its genesis, classification and mapping, using physical, chemical and biological 

attributes, and aiming to enhance its use, management and conservation. 

Although very broad, we can follow the same premise to define “soil physical 

quality”. Is important to state that the aim of this work is not to create a global definition for 

this term, but the reader needs to understand our scope when referring to it during this text. A 

brief comment on the definition of soil structure is needed. As stated before, soil is triphasic. 

How the three phases interact forming different arrangements between solids and pores (i.e. 

the spaces not occupied by solids that can be filled up by liquid or air) is defined as “soil 

structure”. 

“Soil quality” can be defined as “the ability of a soil to perform functions that are 

essential to people and the environment” (DORAN et al., 1994). Since soil structure affects 

water and air movement, influencing its ability to execute vital functions, and all of the above 

are physical processes occurring in soil, the term “soil physical quality” will be considered in 

this text as a measure of the ability that soil structure has to perform functions that are 

essential to mankind and the environment. Thus, a soil with good physical quality presents a 

soil matrix resistant to disaggregation, at the same time allowing life to exist. In other words, 

a soil with high physical quality must be resistant to erosion and exhibit a degree of 

organization that allows the development of flora and fauna. 

All classical soil physical properties (texture, bulk density, aggregates shape and size) 

allow inferences about soil physical quality, because they all relate to the matrix arrangement. 

However, it is common to find that most publications on soil physical quality are associated to 

some physical index, in an attempt to resume several soil attributes into fewer variables. Such 

index may be linked to properties that command crop development, like compaction and 

resistance to penetration. Some examples are the aggregates tensile resistance (DEXTER; 

KROESBERGEN, 1985; MULLINS et al., 1992), relative bulk density (HÅKANSSON, 

1990) and the least limiting water range (SEVERIANO et al., 2011). On the other hand, soil 

structural stability, which is a measure of how soil structure maintains its coherence over 

time, is also an important physical qualifier. In this case, clay dispersion (LEVY et al., 1993) 

and distinct measures of aggregates stability (Le BISSONNAIS, 1996) are widely used to 

produce indexes, since they show how soil behaves against erosion. 

We can consider the soil functioning as the third pillar of soil physical quality. The term 

“function” relates to how the soil plays its role in the ecosystem. Then, its “functioning” is 



 
 

26 

any process that leads to this end. The main physical processes in soil are modeled via flux 

equations. These are used to model water (RAATS, 2001) and air (MOLDRUP et al., 2001) 

movement in soil. In that way, properties that represent these processes are also indicative of 

the degree of physical quality of a soil. Examples are the use of the classical water retention 

curve (DEXTER, 2004a, 2004b), the surface water infiltration rate (ZHOU; LIN; WHITE, 

2008), the air permeability (BALL et al., 1997), hydraulic conductivity (PAGLIAI; 

VIGNOZZI; PELLEGRINI, 2004), amongst others. Some of these will be explored in this 

text. 

 

2.1.3 Soil erosion: its mechanic and the “sealing” process 

Soil erosion is a set of natural processes that changes a soil, diminishing its capability 

on exercising its function in the ecosystem. These processes cause physical, chemical and 

biological changes. They are marked by: the selective removal of particles, which changes the 

structure, interfering in the dynamics of fluids and heat; the decline in the content of organic 

matter and nutrients, causing decay in soil fertility; and, as a result, a reduction in the biota. 

Human accelerated erosion is a major cause of cultivable soils depletion, making them 

unsuitable for exploitation. To change this feature, several soil conservation techniques are 

used to reduce erosion to a minimum rate. These techniques are the result of extensive 

research on the causes of erosion, which are explained by the mechanics of the erosion 

process, that relates the soil and the erosive agents. 

 

2.1.3.1 Physical Erosion 

It is common to divide erosion into physical, chemical and biological, according to its 

cause (LAL, 2001). The physical erosion is the process in which a natural agent causes the 

breakdown, transport and deposition of soil particles and aggregates (MORGAN, 2005). 

During this text we will only discuss this type of erosion and address it simply by “soil 

erosion”. 

The natural agents cited above are any force of nature capable of implementing 

sufficient energy to detach soil particles and aggregates, and move them, until they deposit at 

a location different from its origin. Wind and water are those agents, but they may be assisted 

by fire (SHAKESBY, 2011; GABET, 2014), since fire weakness the structure, and gravity as 

supporter agents (LAL, 2001). However, wind or water are still needed to detach and carry 

the soil to a lower gravitational reference (e.g. point closer to earth’s center). 



 
 

27 

In the case of water, erosion may occur due to its performance in liquid form, through 

the action of rainfall, rivers and sea waves (LAL, 2001), or in solid form, due to expansive 

action of water during the condensation process, or to the melting that destabilizes the 

structure (ANDERSLAND; WIGGERT; DAVIES, 1996). In tropical regions, which 

represents a major area of Brazil, the main erosion agent is rainwater, since summer 

rainstorms are very common in such climate. The rainfall is primarily responsible for the 

erosion in places where the soil bares unprotected, due to tillage operations, and prone to 

crumbling. 

 

2.1.3.1.1 Mechanics of erosion caused by rainfall 

2.1.3.1.1.1 Rainfall erosivity and soil erodibility 

Considering rainfall itself, several attributes interfere in its “erosivity”, i.e. its capacity 

in causing erosion (WISCHMEIER; SMITH, 1960; SALLES; POESEN; GOVERS, 2000). 

We can summarize the main attributes as: the raindrop size (UIJLENHOET; STRICKER, 

1999), pressure exerted over the soil (NEARING; PARKER, 1994) and velocity when 

reaching the target (GUO et al., 2013); the rainfall intensity (ASSOULINE; BEN-HUR, 2006) 

and amount (DALLA ROSA et al., 2012); and the composition of the rainwater (BORSELLI 

et al., 2001). Most studies on soil erosion process keep one or two of these attributes as 

variables, while maintaining all others constant. In studies with simulated rainfall, the 

raindrop size, velocity, pressure and angle of contact can be controlled by the devices sets. 

Then, is left to the researcher to decide on the intensity and amount to be used during 

experimentation.  

Once rainfall impacts on soil surface, the erosion starts to be controlled by its intrinsic 

properties, such as: soil type and steepness, that are dependent on the parental material, 

regional climate and landform (WISCHMEIER; MANNERING, 1969); tillage and cover, 

factors that are controlled by man (i.e. land use) (DALLA ROSA et al., 2012). Once again, 

these are attributes that can be controlled or evaluated separately, to comprehend their 

relationship with erosion rates (VAN OOST; GOVERS; DESMET, 2000; LAL, 2001).  

Rainfall erosion begins with the impact of raindrops over the soil surface (NEARING; 

BRADFORD; HOLTZ, 1987), continues through disintegration of clods and aggregates (Les 

BISSONNAIS, 1996), extends up to the runoff (NEARING; PARKER, 1994) and it ends with 

the sedimentation. Part of the sediments formed during the rainfall event are carried along 

with the water to the watercourses and are deposited in the lower parts of the relief (e.g. 

riparian zones). However, part of these particles and aggregates can also settle very close to 



 
 

28 

its origin, causing local changes in soil surface structure by forming a “seal”. Since the whole 

erosion process consists of these three main steps (particles and aggregates detachment, runoff 

and sedimentation) this will be further discussed. 

 

2.1.3.1.1.2 Particles and aggregates detachment and transport 

The detachment of the particles is the first stage of the erosion process and occurs 

mainly by three causes: the raindrop impact, which releases its kinetic energy on the soil 

surface, breaking aggregates and clods where the structure has weak points, and spreading 

particles around; slaking, due to rapid moistening, that increases aggregates internal pressure, 

causing micro-implosions that create ruptures that induce crumbing; and by water induced 

structure weakness, since water acts as a lubricant that allow structural sliding when soil is 

saturated (Les BISSONNAIS, 1996).  

The second stage of erosion is the transport of aggregates and particles. It starts with the 

spreading caused by the impact of the raindrop, and continues when water starts to flow in 

surface, carrying sediments downhill (MORGAN, 2005). Water surface flow only happens if 

rainfall intensity exceeds soil hydraulic conductivity capacity (DARBOUX et al., 2001). To 

be transported, the sediment must be detached from the soil matrix (SHARMA, 1996), and 

the rate and distance is dependent on the energy of the water flux at surface (DARBOUX at 

al., 2001), which is dependent on the steepness (NEARING; PARKER, 1994) and roughness 

of the surface (DARBOUX; HUANG, 2005). During the superficial flux of particles, i.e. the 

runoff, more particles can be detached and transported, depending on the shear capacity of the 

flux and the shear resistance of the soil (HUANG; BRADFORD; LAFLEN, 1996).  

If the water flow at surface is laminar, particles removal is of uniform thickness over the 

area, causing what is called as sheet or interrow erosion (DESCROIX et al., 2008). When the 

flux concentrates and the flow becomes turbulent, soil removal occurs by forming intermittent 

rills (MORGAN, 2005). If these evolve to become persistent and deeper, the so called gullies 

are formed. In the current specialized literature, these have been divided into ephemeral 

gullies and gullies according to their depth and width (CHESWORTH, 2008). 

 

2.1.3.1.1.3 Particles and aggregates deposition – sealing and crust formation 

The last step of the erosive process is the deposition of particles and aggregates that 

were detached from the soil matrix. The deposition happens according to the size and weight 

of sediments. The first particles and aggregates to deposit are those with low transportability, 

i.e. the heavier and wider ones (BERTONI; LOMBARDI NETO, 2005). The lightest 



 
 

29 

materials are the last ones to deposit, reaching larger distances from its origin. The runoff 

flow energy also influences the morphology and distribution of particles. Irregular depositions 

suggest erosive events with turbulent flow, while uniform deposits, with well-selected grain 

sizes, are an indicative of laminar flow (MOMOLI et al., 2007). 

Sediments properties differ according to their origin and, many times, can be 

distinguished from local horizons by color, particles size distribution, organic carbon content, 

pH and exchange complex constitution (FULLEN et al., 1996). Local sediments are, in 

essence, of coarser fractions, since clay and silt can be transported through larger distances. 

The amount of clay and silt also increases in proportion to the slope, since the steeper slopes 

contribute to the acceleration of runoff, increasing the soil erodibility. Hence, parental 

material, relief and precipitation are the determinant factor influencing the size distribution of 

the sediments. 

The deposition of particles and aggregates over the original soil surface forms a layer 

with different structure from the one underlying. The increase in thickness of this layer may 

change the surface bulk density, due to an decrease in the porosity, followed by an decrease in 

its hydraulic properties, fact why this layer is called a “soil seal”. When this layer of soil dries 

out, is common to occur an increase in the resistance to penetration, while its aspect becomes 

brittle and laminar, forming a so called “soil crust”. Although sometimes the terms soil 

crusting and soil sealing are considered as synonymous, soil sealing describes the wet process 

in which porosity decreases due to a rearrangement of structure, while soil crusting marks the 

increase in soil strength due to the drying of this rearranged structure (BERGSMA et al., 

2000).  

Considering the above, crusts can be separated into two types: structural and 

depositional. These two types give birth to different microstructure morphologies, and may 

occur successively, initiating with the sealing of the surface by an structural brokenness, 

followed by an depositional process of particles on its top. Structural crusts are formed by the 

reorganization of the soil surface due to a local displacement of fragments, i.e., clods and 

aggregates, without the sedimentation of particles. They are the result of gradual packaging 

and coalescence of small clods and aggregates, which are mainly produced by the breakdown 

of bigger aggregates due to an increased internal stress during wetting, i.e., slaking 

(NORTON; SCHROEDER; MOLDENHAUER, 1986). Depositional crusts are the result 

from the displacement of fragments and particles due selective decantation in puddles, formed 

during the runoff process, where the water slowly infiltrate into the soil (KOOISTRA; 

SIDERIUS, 1986).

2.1.4 Soil surface roughness vs soil physical quality 

The behavior of the soil surface structure has an important role on air, water and 

nutrients dynamics. In tropical and subtropical regions it is common to have high intensity 

rainfall events during summer seasons, and rainfall erosivity can lead to greater problems on 

bare and/or tilled soil. The raindrop impact changes soil microtopography, which controls 

surface depressional water storage (BURWELL et al., 1963; HANSEN et al., 1999; 

BORSELLI; TORRI, 2010), drainage and runoff (SEGINER, 1969; ROMKENS et al., 2001), 

and even interferes on infiltration rates (BURWELL; LARSON, 1969; MAGUNDA et al., 

1997; GUZHA, 2004). Therefore, the state of the soil microtopography is dependent on, and 

controls, soil erosion (MAGUNDA et al., 1997; DARBOUX et al., 2005; RODRÍGUEZ-

CABALLERO et al., 2012). 

Very often, the roughness of a surface is a measure of its state. Smith (2014) ratify that 

“surface roughness” generically defines any “…resulting parameter…that determines the 

minimum amount of information necessary to parameterize topographic complexity at a 

degraded scale in the most physically meaningful way”. He also states that this is subjective 

and dependent on the objectives of a study. Therefore, in soil science, the surface roughness is 

considered as a parameter that represents the variability of a set of (z) heights inside an (x, y) 

area and can be used to interpret the morphology of the microtopography. Commonly, this 

parameterization separates roughness into two classes: the Oriented Roughness, governed by 

the slope and tillage marks, and the Random Roughness (RR), representing the distribution of 

soil clods and particles (ALLMARAS et al., 1966; CURRENCE; LOVELY, 1970; 

KAMPHORST et al., 2000). The latter one, a major percentage of total roughness, is the most 

relevant considering fluxes at surface, since it controls the dynamics of runoff and it is 

governed by soil intrinsic attributes (i.e. particles and clods size distribution, water dispersed 

clay and aggregates stability). 

Consequently, several devices that collect data are used to estimate roughness 

parameters. The pin meter (BURWELL et al., 1963), the laser profilometer (CURRENCE; 

LOVELY, 1970) and the infrared microrelief meter (MRM) (CASTRO et al., 2006; 

CASTILHO et al., 2011) are examples of equipments used in field, that perform readings of 

(z) heights in square grids with a (x,y) resolution ? 1 mm. Other devices, generally used in the 

laboratory, case of Huang’s laser scanner (HUANG et al., 1988) and the Multistripe Laser 

Triangulation (MLT) scanner (HIRMAS et al., 2016), reach finer horizontal resolutions, up to 

0.5 mm. In addition, computed tomography allows the generation of even higher resolution 

images, as far as 0.02 mm (20 µm) by using standard X-ray computed tomography (XRT) 



 
 

31 

(ELLIOT; REYNOLDS; HECK, 2010) or even 0.001 mm (1 µm) using X-ray 

microtomography (µXRT) (ZHOU et al., 2013). Information on increasing scales stimulates 

the study of fragmentation processes caused by rainfall, because it allows mapping clods 

disruption by reaching scales close to the actual size of the soil’s primary particles, which was 

only possible previously via mathematical and/or statistical modeling. Furthermore, the 

gathering of real physical data on different scales can help enhance models used to estimate 

more complex variables (i.e. drainage, runoff, soil loss).  

Apart from the above, the roughness parameterization depends on distinct mathematical 

approaches as well. Allmaras et al. (1966) first used the standard error of log of heights, and 

Currence and Lovely (1970) showed the standard deviation of heights was enough if Oriented 

Roughness was corrected. Since these indexes only represent the vertical range of roughness, 

without considering the spatial component (KAMPHORST et al., 2000), several authors tried 

a geostatistical approach (VIDAL VÁSQUEZ et al., 2009; DALLA ROSA et al., 2012). 

However, the scale factor is also important and fractal models were also used in conjunction 

to spatial modeling (HUANG; BRADFORD, 1992; VIDAL VÁSQUEZ et al., 2005, 2010). 

Two facts restrain the use of fractal theory on roughness analysis: (1) it relies on a single 

number to describe the whole system; (2) although fractal indices may represent 

morphological responses to rainfall, they cannot be used to actually quantify fluids dynamics 

at the surface (KAMPHORST et al., 2000). In this sense, multifractal models excel. The 

multifractal approach consider several dimensions related to local occurrence of probabilities 

of a process, which merges the information of scale and spatial distribution, making it 

possible to generate indexes that may be used to model complex variables. This rising 

technique in soil science is still little explored in the evaluation of surface roughness 

(GARCÍA MORENO et al., 2008; SAN JOSÉ MARTÍNEZ et al., 2009; VIDAL VÁSQUEZ 

et al., 2010), but it is very promising in the generation of parameters that may express 

structural changes of the soil surface. 

 

2.1.5 Soil structure image analysis  

Micromorphometrical analysis consists on the evaluation of thin sections taken from 

soil blocks impregnated with polyester resin. This technique allows the study of the soil 

microstructure and to quantify the shape, size and soil pore connectivity using quantitative 

indexes related to pores and aggregate morphology (RINGROSE-VOASE, 1987; HORGAN, 

1998; HOLDEN, 2001). Since the pore system morphology is related to water movement and 

the matrix arrangement is associated to pedogenic processes and biological activity (BOUMA 



 
 

32 

et al., 1977; RINGROSE-VOASE, 1987; PAGLIAI; DENOBILI, 1993) this technique has 

aided in the study of the soil structure (RINGROSE-VOASE; BULLOCK, 1984). 

The selection and interpretation of soil pore morphological parameters still requires 

research (DROOGERS et al., 1998; HOLDEN, 2001) and, although this approach allows to 

systematically analyze a soil sample, it provides a partial result, since the analysis are made in 

two-dimensional soil sections.  

The computed tomography scan is an alternative to the bidimensional problem. This is a 

relatively new technique in soil analysis, since X-rays were discovered only in the late 

nineteenth century by WC Roentgen (HECK, 2009). The X-rays attenuation index calculus 

obtained mathematical foundations only in 1963 by Cormack (CARVALHO, 2007) and initial 

works using this technique to study the soil emerged only in the 1980s. It was widely used in 

the study of soil porosity and hydraulic properties, initiating with innovative studies in the 

1980s, related to soil bulk density (HAINSWORTH; AYLMORE, 1983), water movement in 

soil-plant system (PETROVIC et al., 1982) and soil moisture (CRESTANA, 1985). In the 

early 1990s, it was used aiming to understand the structure morphology and behavior, by 

macroporosity measurements (PHOGAT; AYLMORE, 1989; GREVERS et al., 1989; 

ANDERSON et al., 1990), biopores reconstruction (JOSCHKO et al., 1992, 1993) and effect 

of aggregate size on solute transportation (ANDERSON et al., 1992). In the late 1990s and 

early 2000s, the main use of this technique switched to understanding structure modifications 

in soils, such as due to cropping system (OLSEN; BØRRESEN, 1997), decomposition of 

organic waste (De GRYZE et al., 2006) and to wetting and drying cycles (PIRES et al., 2007). 

Nevertheless, although the studies using CT brought a new approach to image analysis, 

there was not a distinguished language used to describe soil structural quality that implicated 

in a leap between these and classical techniques. And the calculation of indexes that are 

actually based on a tridimensional approach is still scarce, since much work has been done 

analyzing the bidimensional slices that form the reconstructed 3d image. 

 

2.2 Material and methods 

An experiment with simulated rainfall was assembled on a Fine Rhodic Kandiudalf 

(SOIL SURVEY STAFF, 2014), i.e., a Nitossolo Vermelho eutroférrico argiloso 

(EMBRAPA, 2013), located at 22º41’51.5” S and 47º37’53.2” W, at the “Luiz de Queiroz” 

College of Agriculture – University of Sao Paulo, in the city of Piracicaba, Sao Paulo, Brazil 

(Figure 3). Piracicaba is in an altitude of 554 meters, in a subtropical region of the state of Sao 

Paulo. Its climate is Cwa, according to the classification of Köppen-Geiger. Temperatures 



 
 

33 

through the year vary from a maximum of 310.65 K to a 289.15 K minimum. The annual 

average rainfall is 1230 millimeters, with typically three dry months during the year (June, 

July and August).

“Luiz de Queiroz” College of Agriculture, Piracicaba, Sao Paulo, Brazil, where an experiment with 

simulated rainfall was assembled with quadruplicate plots divided in four blocks, each one containing 

the treatments No-rainfall, 40, 80 and 120 mm of rainfall 

 

The preparation of the soil, the sampling design and all measurements are described 

next. 

 

2.2.2 Soil preparation and experimental design 

Soil preparation was carried at the end of March 2014, by two disk harrowing (24 discs 

x 50.80 cm) operations: the first was for soil breakdown and disturbance of grass clumps, and 

the second, two weeks later, to simulate the conventional preparation of the seedbed. After the 

tillage operations, the soil was fully bare, presenting broken and partially decomposed straws 

of the previous crop (Gossypium hirsutum L.) and a distribution of different size clods. We 

removed tillage marks using a rake, in order to diminish its interference in the Oriented 

Roughness. Then, the area was fenced, to impede animal passage, and 16 plots (1 m
2
) were 

established in a contour line following the elevation of the terrain. A gap of 0.5 m was left 



 
 

34 

between plots to avoid drifts from neighboring treatments. A random blocks design divided 

the contour line in 4 blocks wherein rainfall applications were randomized (Figure 4).

how was the slope of the area and the localization of the water tank, and (c) leveled photo from the 1

 plots, demarcated by a black/yellow tape and arranged in a line perpendicular to the slope. (d) The 

scheme of the experimental design in randomized blocks (d), showing how the blocks were divided 

along the line and an example of how the rainfall was randomized within each one of the four blocks. 

 

After rainfall application (item 2.2.3), following a 24 h drying period, elevation data 

was collected from each plot with a laser microrelief meter (item 2.2.4). Six undisturbed 

samples were collected by plot: two soil blocks (12 x 12 x 5 cm) were scanned by a 

multistripe laser triangulation (MLT) scanner and a X-ray tomography (XRT) scanner, 

respectively, to obtain information about surface roughness (item 2.2.4); two cylinders (2.5 x 

5 cm) were collected to measure the bulk density (item 2.2.5.2), and to model the water 

retention curve (item 2.2.5.3); two soil blocks (12 x 7 x 5 cm) were used in aggregate stability 

tests (item 2.2.5.2) and micromorphometrical analyses (item 2.2.6.1). One disturbed sample 

was collected by experimental block at the surface (0-5 cm), to characterize the soil particles 

distribution (item 2.2.5.2), pH and exchange complex composition (item 2.2.5.1) (Figure 5). 



 
 

35 

The particles size distribution and chemical composition of the exchange complex are 

summarized on Table 1 and Table 2. The blocks were homogeneous. However, during 

statistical procedures the block design was maintained due to other possible causes of 

variance (e.g. terrain slope, machinery passage, etc.).  

 

Figure 5 – (a) Disposition of the sampling inside each plot and (b) scheme with the measures of each sample: 

two cylinders with 50 mm in diameter, that were used for bulk density and water retention curve 

evaluations; two rectangular blocks (120 x 70 mm), that were used in micromorphometrical and 

aggregates stability analyses; and two square soil blocks (120 mm x 120 mm) that were used in 

roughness analyses. The dots represent the resolution of roughness measurements. A field 

microrelief meter was used to gather information of the whole 1 m
2
 plot (10 mm resolution). For 

each square soil block there were different scales of measurement, using a multistripe laser scanner 

(right, 0.5 mm resolution) and a X-ray tomography scanner (left, 0.074 mm resolution). Solid lines 

represent the area of collected data, while dashed lines represent the cropped area used during 

analyses. The arrow in the middle indicate the position of the infiltrometer, used to measure 

unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity

2.2.3 Rainfall simulation 

Rainfall was applied at an intensity of 120 mm h
-1

 in the quadruplicate plots at amounts 

of 40, 80, and 120 mm, plus a control treatment with no-rainfall. The simulator operates at a 

height of 2.4 m above the soil and consists of a oscillating spray nozzle (VeeJet Nozzle, H/U-

80100, Spraying Systems, Co.) connected to a system that maintain a pendulum movement to 

simulate rainfall in a total area of 1m
2
. The entire system is supported by metal pipes that 

brings lightness and firmness at the same time. To avoid the effects of drift a plastic cover 

was placed around the equipment (Figure 6a). 

The rainfall intensity was chosen based on regional climate characteristics and soil 

structural features. For example, Hudson (1965) stated that rainfall intensities over 25 mm h
-1

 

are erosive for most tropical and subtropical soils. However, soil erosion is a combination 

between rainfall erosivity and soil erodibility, which depends on intrinsic properties of soil, 

such as structural stability. Castilho et al. (2011), studying the same soil of this research 

(Rhodic Kandiudalf), found undisrupted clods even after 10 natural rainfalls with intensities 

higher than 25 mm h
-1

. Magunda et al. (1997), in a similar soil (Mollic Kandiudalf), found 

minimal changes on soil surface roughness after 126 mm of simulated rainfall with an 

intensity of 63 mm h
-1

. These are evidences that such soils possess a highly stable structure. 



 
 

37 

Considering that, to fully understand this soil disruption behavior due to cumulative 

rainfall, higher intensities must be used during simulation tests, so that a wider range of 

structural changes may be captured. 

 

2.2.4 Soil surface roughness measurements 

The evolution of the surface roughness was evaluated in three scales of measurement. In 

the field, a portable field microrelief meter (MRM) was used, coupled with an infrared sensor 

(GP2Y0A21YK0F, SHARP Corporation) with ±0.05 mm resolution, and making readings on 

a fixed grid (10 x 10 mm), totaling 10,201 points per plot (Figure 6a). In the laboratory two 

finer scales were obtained from soil blocks. One block from each plot was scanned by a 

multistripe laser triangulation (MLT) scanner (NextEngine, Inc.), creating a random mesh 

averaging 60,000 points (resolution of 0.5 mm) (Figure 6c). A second block from each plot 

was scanned using an X-ray tomography (XRT) scanner model XT H 225st, third generation, 

with a total of 1918x1534 detectors (Figure 6b). To reduce artifacts and image noise a high 

passage filter was used. The acquisition voxel size was of 74.5 x 74.5 x 74.5 µm. This process 

results in average of 3018 two-dimensional projection images that are reconstructed to portray 

a three-dimensional soil structure. The final image was reconstructed using maximum 

resolution, and the process was filtered by back projection, using CT PR O 3D and 

VGSTUDIO.  

To minimize influences of artifacts and disturbances on samples edge, only a central 

area from each resulting mesh was analyzed, cropping areas of 800 x 800 mm, 75 x 75 mm 

and 30 x 30 mm for MRM, MLT and XRT, respectively.  

 

2.2.5 Soil attributes 

2.2.5.1 Chemical analyses 

The determinations of pH in water, CaCl2 0.01 mol L
-1

, KCl 1 mol L
-1

, and of the 

content of exchangeable aluminum (Al), potassium (K), phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca) and 

magnesium (Mg) were performed according to Raij et al. (2001). The Walkey-Black method 

was used for the determination of the organic carbon content (OC), as described in Anderson 

and Ingram (1992). All soil samples were air dried and sieved (&amp;lt;2 mm) prior to each 

analysis.

2.2.5.2 Physical analyses 

The bulk density (BD) (Mg m
-3

) was determined using the cylinder method according to 

Grossman and Reinsch (2002). Cylinders (2.5 x 2.5 cm) were collected in quadruplicates by 

rainfall amount. The particle size distribution was determined by the hydrometer method 

(GEE; OR, 2002), using 40 g of sieved disturbed samples (&amp;lt;2 mm) after air dried. The 

number of replicates was the same as for the cylinder method used for BD. The particles 

density (PD) (Mg m
-3

) was determined from the same disturbed samples (&amp;lt;2 mm) using a 

Helium pycnometer (AccuPyc 1330, Micromeritics Instrument Corporation ®). The ratio of 

volume of pores (Pr) (m 
3
 m

-3
) was calculated from BD and PD (Equation 28), indicating the 

relative amount of voids of the soil (VOMOCIL, 1965). 

     
          

  

  
  (28) 

An aggregates stability test was conducted according to Le Bissonnais (1996) using 

blocks of soil (12 x 7 x 5 cm) collected in quadruplicates according to rainfall amount. The 

surface of each block (0-10 mm) was ripped off, from which, aggregates were manually 



 
 

39 

broken and normalized to a diameter between 4 and 2 mm. The 10 mm layer was chosen in an 

attempt to boost the chances of detecting the changes caused by sealing. After, pre-treatments 

were applied in triplicates of 5 g of normalized aggregates, dried at 313,15 K for 24 h. The 

pre-treatments were: slow wetting, where dry aggregates were placed in a filter paper over a 

saturated sponge and slowly moistened by capillary forces; fast wetting, where dry aggregates 

were submerged directly into water; and mechanical breakdown, when dry aggregates were 

previously moistened with alcohol and shaken, while submerged in water, with controlled 

energy. After each pre-treatment, the aggregates were immersed in alcohol and sieved (0.053 

mm), with the retained soil once again dried (313,15 K for 24 h). These dry aggregates were 

then passed through a set of six sieves (2, 1, 0.5, 0.106 and 0.053 mm), generating an 

aggregates size distribution, which was consequently used to calculate the weighted mean 

diameter (WMD) (Equation 29).  

              
  
  

 

   

 (29) 

WMD considers the equivalent diameter of aggregates (  ), which is the average 

diameter between a subsequent set of sieves (e.g. between sieves 2 mm and 1 mm    = 1.5 

mm), having the relative mass of aggregates (
  

  
) as weights.    is the total mass of 

aggregates (5 g) and    is the mass of aggregates retained at each sieve i. 

 

2.2.5.3 Hydrological analyses 

Soil water retention curve (SWRC): The SWRC is the correlation between the 

gravimetric water content (?) and the matric potential in the soil (?m). Undisturbed soil 

samples were collected in cylinders (2.5 x 2.5 cm). Using a nylon string, each cylinder was 

subdivided into three parts (top, middle and bottom) while maintaining the original structure. 

The subsamples were relocated to smaller cylinders (2.5 x 0.8 cm). Since there were 

quadruplicate samples for each rainfall amount, it totaled 48 subsamples. Curves were 

generated using these subsamples in pressure plates for potentials of -0.001; -0.003; -0.006; -

0.008; -0.010; -0.033 -0.070 MPa and -0.100, and disturbed samples (&amp;lt;2 mm) in high 

pressure plates for potentials of -0.300, -0.500 and 1.5 MPa. The curves were fitted using the 

empirical model proposed by van Genuchten (1980), which parameters are the soil water 

contents at saturation ?s and residual ?r, plus the empirical parameters n and ? (Equation 30). 

Changes in the inclination of the curves were evaluated using parameters n and ?. 



 
 

40 

      
       

            
 
   

 (30) 

Soil hydraulic conductivity [K(?)]: The hydraulic conductivity of the unsaturated soil 

was calculated by measurements with a mini disk infiltrometer (Mini Disk Infiltrometer, 

Decagon Devices) at four potentials (-1.5, -3.0, -4.5 and -6 cm) (Figure 5). To calculate the 

unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, the method by Zhang (1997) was used. 

 

2.2.6 Image analyses 

2.2.6.1 Micromorphometrical analyses 

Undisturbed soil samples, oriented to the surface and collected in cardboard boxes (0.12 

x 0.07 x 0.05 m), were impregnated using a polyester resin (MURPHY, 1986), styrene 

monomer (CASTRO et al., 2003), a catalyzer (RINGROSE-VOASE, 1991) and a fluorescent 

pigment (MURPHY et al., 1977). The impregnation procedure and image acquisition was 

done as described by Castro et al. (2003). 

In the laboratory, the samples were air dried for 10 days and at 313.15 K with forced air 

circulation for 48 hours. These samples were put in containers and placed in a desiccator 

connected to a vacuum pump, which helps the solution to penetrate the pores. The 

impregnation was held by a solution of polyester resin and styrene monomer (1/1), using a 

hardening solute (Butanox M50, 10 drops L
-1

 of solution) and a fluorescent colorant (Tinopal 

OB, Ciba-Geigy®, 5 g L
-1

 of solution). After drying, the samples were sliced in blocks and 

polished. Image (1024x768 pixels) acquisition using a digital color camera (Sony DFW-

X700) in 10X magnification (156.25 µm
2
 pixel

-1
) was made using a charged couple device 

(CCD) system, connected to a magnifying glass with a polarizer (Zeiss). 

Each block was divided into three layers (0 to 10 mm, 20 to 30 mm and 40 to 50 mm), 

parallel to surface, and five images were taken from each layer. After taking the pictures, 

images analyses, using software ImageJ, followed the steps showed in Figure 7: each RGB 

image (24 bits) was converted to 8 bits (256 gray-levels); since most images showed artifacts 

related to illumination, with central pixels presenting higher values than those from the edge, 

a filter was applied around the image to smooth the values around the image center; after this 

correction, plugin “CTofsoil” was used to select areas of low variance in an attempt to smooth 

the histogram and facilitate the segmentation process; an average histogram was calculated 

for all blocks and used to choose the threshold between pores and solids; after segmentation, 

pores with equivalent diameter less than 50 µm (?13 pixels) were excluded prior to any 

calculations. Then, three representative images, from each layer, were used in further analysis.

with diameter less than 50 µm (&lt;13 pixels) 



42 

 

The total area of pores (%) was estimated by the ratio between the number of pixels 

representing the pore system and the total number of pixels of the image (MORAN et al. 

1988). The classification of pores by shape and size was executed using software Soil Pore 

Image Analysis - SPIA (COOPER et al., 2016). 

 

2.2.6.2 Soil surface roughness analyses 

Both MRM and MLT generate (x, y, z) data frames to create Digital Elevation Models 

(DEM). These were rasterized into matrices, whose rows and columns dimensions represents 

(x, y) coordinates and cell values are (z) heights, which were interpreted as grey-level images, 

having the cells as pixels and the heights as bit depth. For XRT three-dimensional binary 

images, the surface was estimated by adding the number of (z) axe voxels, at each (x, y) 

position, from the first bidimensional slice of the surface (pure air) until the first one 

representing the solid phase. Then, by subtracting the total number of slices and multiplying 

the resulting two-dimensional image by the scan’s resolution (0.0745 mm) we obtained a 

representation of the surface of the soil. 

Once we gathered the images from all scales, general trends of terrain slope (Oriented 

Roughness) were removed by linear regressions, and all calculations were made using the 

absolute value of the models deviations. Data were rearranged to present a minimum height of 

1 mm. Since MLT scanner measures the distortion patterns of lasers over an object (HIRMAS 

et al., 2016), places where light is lost (cracks) creates gaps in the DEM. These gaps were not 

considered in descriptive statistics and interpreted as zero (0) during multifractal calculations, 

which interferes in some spectra features that will be explained next. 

There are several roughness indexes that have been used in rainfall simulation studies 

(BERTUZZI et al., 1990). However, the facility of calculation and the good correlation with 

rainfall (ELTZ; NORTON, 1997), as to other important variables (KAMPHORST et al., 

2000; GARCÍA MORENO et al., 2008), makes the random roughness index RRi a suitable 

index to be used on describing soil roughness behavior across rainfall increase, reason to why 

it was used as an standard measure in this study (Equation 31). It is the standard deviation of k 

heights    within a plot with average height    (KAMPHORST et al., 2000).

2.2.6.3 Multifractal analysis 

For all images the multifractal spectrum f(?) was calculated using the partition function 

?i(q, L) (Equation 22) and a box-counting technique. By covering an image with boxes of 

different sizes L and applying Equation 23 for a range of q values (q   ) is possible to 

calculate ?(q) and f(q) (Equations 24 and 25). In this method, a grid of boxes of size L covers 

the image and the number of boxes that contain at least one pixel representing the object of 

study is counted (POSADAS et al., 2003). 

Multifractal spectra from the 2d images and the maps were calculated according to 

Posadas et al. (2003) with the software Multifractal Analysis System 3.0 

(http://inrm.cip.cgiar.org/home/downmod.htm; accessed on 27 June 2015). For the 

calculations using the 3d images an ImageJ plugin was used. For each image, maximum and 

minimum q values were selected when f(q) and ?(q) were linear functions (R
2
 ? 0.98). Values 

of q were estimated using a ?q of 0.1 to create a more detailed spectrum. 

As shown in Figures 1 and 2 the f(?) spectra presents a convex parabolic shape, from 

where several parameters are known or can be estimated. The parameters evaluated during 

this research were: D0, D1, D2, D0-D1, D0-D2, D1-D2, Lf(?)min, ?Lf(?), Rf(?)min,, ?Rf(?), 

?min,, ?max, ?L?, ?R?, ??, f(?)ratio and ?ratio. 

It was discussed that D0 is a fractional dimension of the mass contained in a fragmented 

system, i.e. one that possesses parts with and without mass. For example, if someone wants to 

analyze the pore system of a soil, the pore phase is considered as the one containing the mass 

of the system, while the solids are considered weightless during the analyses. When all points 

have mass, D0 is equal to the object’s topological dimension. Since roughness analyses 

consider a surface, D0 should be equal to 2 for all plots. However, the MLT data, as explained 

in item XXX, present gaps, and D0 was not exactly 2 for this dataset. Nevertheless, how D0 

relates to other dimensions is less affected by the gaps if the covered area (i.e. the area 

containing mass) is prevalent, since points with mass have major influence over spectrum 

format, especially considering its left side. All MLT images presented 90% or more of 

covered area, thus this feature was not considered as a problem. 

Although previous information from each parameter was presented on section 2.1.1.3.3, 

specific interpretations are presented here. Lf(?)min can be interpreted as the fractal dimension 

of micro-watersheds in roughness analyses, or large macropores in pore system analyses. 

?Lf(?) represents the homogeneity of the fragmentation at these areas, and values closer to 0 

may show a unifractal process, or one dominated by micro-valleys and smaller macropores. 

Similar interpretations can be made at the right side for Rf(?)min and ?Rf(?). ? shows how the 



 
 

44 

same range of heights, or pores sizes, change across scales. Thus, ?min shows how the 

distribution of the highest micro-watersheds, or larger macropores, changes over scale, and 

?max how it happens for the lowest micro-valleys and smaller macropores. ?L? and ?R? 

indicate which class of heights and macropores changes more over scale when compared to 

the systems’ mean. ?? represents diversity across scales, i.e. how differentiated it is its 

roughness or porosity. f(?)ratio and ?ratio shows the ratio between micro-valleys and micro-

watersheds, or between large and small macropores, and it is an indicative of which class is 

more fragmented or changes more across scales. 

 

2.2.7 Statistical analyses 

In the case of soil roughness, since the datasets were large (e.g. the smallest grid had 

more than 6,000 points), initial evaluation was made by descriptive statistics (maximum, 

minimum, mean, median, mode, variance, skewness and kurtosis) of each heights and 

exploratory analysis using histograms. Although all calculations were carried out with 

original height values, histograms present a logarithmic abscissa, for better visual 

interpretations. In the case of the aggregates stability an exploratory analysis was made using 

the plot of the distribution of masses of aggregates according the equivalent diameters. These 

variables were important to characterize the behavior of soil surface according to rainfall 

amount before interpreting the multifractal parameters. For bulk density, ratio volume of 

pores, aggregates size distribution, random roughness index, unsaturated soil hydraulic 

conductivity, image pores distribution and all multifractal parameters, direct measures of 

differences between means were used in interpretations. 

An Anova with randomized blocks was applied to all variables and each multifractal 

parameter, and significant differences (p &amp;lt;0.10) were considered in further analyses. In the 

analysis of the soil surface roughness, the scale of measurement was used as an additional 

factor to rainfall amount as a cause of variance. For images pore analysis and water retention 

curves depth was the additional factor, since the impregnated blocks and the cylinders were 

divided in three layers before each analysis. 

Before comparing means, we checked the homogeneity of variances amongst treatments 

using Levene’s test. In case of homoscedasticity, Tukey-Kramer Honest Significance 

Distance (Tukey HSD) was used, as for heteroscedasticity, Dunnett’s modified Tukey-Kramer 

(DTK) pairwise multiple comparison was used instead. When differences in means across 

rainfall amounts were significant (p &amp;lt;0.10) and a linear pattern was observed, linear 

regressions were used to explain behavior across rainfall. The coefficient of determination 



 
 

45 

(R²) was used to check the models explained variance, and the significance of the angular 

coefficient (slope) was used for comparisons and interpretations.  

All tests and regressions were made using R-project software (R CORE TEAM, 2015). 

Homogeneity test used functions of package “car” (FOX; WEISBERG, 2011), and mean tests 

from packages “agricolae” and “DTK” (LAU, 2013; MENDIBURU, 2015). 

 

2.3 Results and discussion 

2.3.1 Soil surface roughness 

In an initial glance over samples’ DEMs on each scale, we notice that physical changes 

happens on all scales with rainfall application, considering the opposite treatments of no-

rainfall and 120 mm ( 

Figure 8). Even in a coarser scale (MRM), there is a smoothing after rainfall, with a 

diminishing appearance of peaks and a spreading of the valley over the area. The persistent 

peaks represent very stable clods that do not disrupt even after 120 mm of rainfall. In higher 

scales there is a more pronounced flattening. This happens mainly because sample size is 

smaller and covers an area smaller than the average size clod. Thus, on such scales, disruption 

of very small clods (MLT) and particles spreading (XRT) are expected to be the dominant 

processes. This may be seen in the flatter and smother image from MLT after rainfall, 

indicating general dismantlement of clods, and flatter, but more rugged, image from XRT, 

indicating the presence of small particles covering the surface. 

Looking on descriptive statistical parameters of heights response to rainfall increase, we 

note, a general negative linear behavior for the variance of MRM, while its maximum, mean, 

median and mode, and all variables (less skewness and kurtosis) of MLT and XRT, present a 

negative quadratic behavior, with maxima around 80 mm (MRM) and 40 mm (MLT and 

XRT) of rainfall (Table 3). The negative linear behavior of variance was expected, since it is 

reasonable to think that when rainfall increases, more clods disrupt, and heights tend to 

diminish, as well as its variability. The initial increase of these parameters on MLT and XRT 

show that, at the beginning of the disruption process, the surface becomes more complex, i.e. 

rougher. It is easy to imagine that, at the beginning of the rainfall event, some clods disrupt 

more easily than others, and that not all pulverize entirely, instead they break into increasingly 

smaller clods. This increases heterogeneity of heights, especially in areas closer to more stable 

clods. As stated before, MRM gathers information of larger features, showing how average 

size clods behave with rainfall increase. In this case, a linear decrease of heights is expected, 



 
 

46 

because it represents the average behavior of the system, which is a general flattening. 

However, at a larger scale, where the small clods are responsible for the aspect of the 

roughness, anything that increases the quantity of this type of clods will favor the increase of 

height differences.  

 

 

 
 

Figure 8 – Digital elevation models from the surface of a fine Rhodic Kandiudalf, before (No rainfall) and after 

rainfall simulation (120 mm), obtained in three scales, by: a field microrelief meter sensor (MRM, 10 

– 800 mm); a multistripe laser triangulation scanner (MLT, 0.5 – 50 mm); and an X-ray tomographer 

(XRT, 0.0745 - 30 mm) 

 

The mean, the median and the mode represent the central tendency, which means that an 

increase in these variables is not always accompanied by an increase in variance, but can 

show that the distribution has shifted right. MRM skewness at 80 mm shows a light skewness 

left (-0.04), which may represent such displacement. However, since the variance reduces, the 

increase of these variables just means that during clod breakdown micro-valleys are filled 

faster than peaks are destroyed. In summary, proximity between means, medians and modes 



 
 

47 

within rainfall amount, plus skewness and kurtosis data, show that heights behave very close 

to normal [P~N(µ, ?²)] in all scales. Along scales, proportion seems to be the basic difference,

49 

since MRM, MLT and XRT ranged to a Maximum of 64.38, 14.26 and 12.74 mm 

before rainfall simulation, and 59.68, 10.27 and 6.62 mm after the last application, 

respectively. 

We matched these observations with histograms (Figure 9). When rainfall has not 

occurred yet, both MLT and XRT show very similar distributions. MRM has a larger 

distribution of heights. More or less, all distributions could be extrapolated to a normal after 

80 mm of rainfall. However, at 40 mm, MLT and XRT present a bimodal distribution. This 

agrees with the initial increment in variance after the first rainfall, since, as explained before, 

soon after rainfall, the heterogeneity is enhanced, and different classes of clods size are 

created in a short space of time during disruption process. This contributes to the appearance 

of peaks that represent each new clod size class that dominate the surface. Nevertheless, 

considering all other rainfall amounts and scales, there is nothing that extrapolates to much 

normality. Allmaras et al. (1966) recommended the logarithm transformation of heights, but 

Currance and Lovely (1970), and Kamphorst et al. (2000), also stated that most heights 

distributions behave as normal. Considering all histograms, and skewness and kurtosis values, 

no transformations were used to normalize the dataset.

and an X-ray tomography scanner (XRT, 0.0745 - 30 mm)

Rainfall increase appears to concentrate distributions over all scales, with more 

markedly features on MLT and XRT, where we see more narrow and peaked distributions 

after 120 mm of rainfall. XRT becomes very narrow at 120 mm, when its central value 

represents more than 50% of the distribution. At the same rainfall amount, MRM have bigger 

tails on both sides and presents more subtle changes, concentrating on a uniform distribution 

between 15 and 25 mm. Increasing rainfall augment the possibility of clods disruption, which 

is expected to homogenize heights, which would cause the narrowing of the histograms. 

Differences in scales are basically related to range. While MLT and XRT present very similar 

histograms: on first two rainfall amounts both are centered around 8 mm, and after 120 mm 

present distinct narrowing degrees; MRM is always centered above 20 mm. Thus, different 

parametrization is expected for each scale. 

 

2.3.1.1 Random Roughness - RRi 

In  

Table 4 we find the average from all variables (RRi and multifractal parameters) of each 

factor (rainfall and scale). The Anova showed that RRi had differences (p &amp;lt;0.10) among 

scales within all rainfall amounts, and among rainfalls only for MLT and XRT. After testing 

pairwise means, differences among rainfalls presented no significance (p &gt; 0.10), while MRM 

was considered significantly different from MLT and XRT. The difference in range was 

enough to differentiate scales; however, the subtle narrowing of distributions was not 

expressed by RRi. Magunda et al. (1997) also found, in a Mollic Kandiudalf with similar 

particles size distribution and carbon content as the soil of this study, only 5% reduction in 

RRi after 126 mm of simulated rainfall in a scale from 25 to 200 mm. Hence, in stable soils it 

seems to be difficult to find more accentuated differences along rainfall application. This 

corroborates results showed on section 2.3.2.2, where aggregates size distributions did not 

present significant differences (p &gt; 0.10) along rainfall application. 

Several studies use RRi as an independent variable to model more difficult to obtain soil 

attributes. Considering that, we did a linear regression between average RRi and rainfall 

amount for each scale (Figure 10). For rainfall amount, only MRM had a very significant (p &amp;lt;

0.05) slope (?1 = -0.0048), but still not very far from 0. The heteroscedasticity of MLT and 

XRT, confirmed by Levene’s test, must be the contributing factor to diminish the significance 

(p &amp;lt;0.2) on these scales, since they present increasingly smaller coefficients (?1 = -0.0078; ?1 

= -0.0112), which would indicate a more accentuated response to rainfall by magnifying the 



 
 

51 

scale of measurement. Even if there is a general decreasing behavior of RRi according to 

rainfall amount, the lack of significance makes it difficult to consider this variable as a good 

indicator of surface behavior. Significance appears to be linked specifically to the range of 

variances within each factor. This can lead to two hypothesis: (i) RRi is not effective in 

evaluating rainfall effects in this type of soil; or (ii) the lack of significance is related to the 

actual inexistence of physical differences on soil surface after rainfall. Since the second 

hypothesis is easily refuted by visual examinations of surface before and after rainfall, other 

parameters may explain better changes of soil surface with rainfall across scales.

2.3.1.2 Multifractal analyses of the soil surface roughness 

At a first sight over the average multifractal spectra (Figure 11), we do not see much 

differences between rainfall amounts on ? range for MRM, although it appears to show some 

differences on Lf(?)min, for 120 mm, and Rf(?)min for 80 mm of rainfall. For MLT and XRT 

there are clearer differences on both ? and f(?) ranges, with a narrowing of ? and decreasing 

of Lf(?)min and Rf(?)min with rainfall increase. Differences between scale have MRM with 



 
 

52 

wider and longer spectra, while MLT and XRT are more similar, with differences related to 

range of dimensions. 

 
Figure 11 - Multifractal spectra of elevations from a fine Rhodic Kandiudalf before (No rainfall) and after 

rainfall simulations (40, 80 and 120 mm), obtained in three scales, by: a field microrelief meter sensor 

(MRM, 10 – 800 mm); a multistripe laser triangulation scanner (MLT, 0.5 – 50 mm); and an X-ray 

tomography scanner (XRT, 0.0745 - 30 mm) 

 

To simplify interpretations, the parameters on Table 4 were used to unravel the 

multifractal behavior of soil surface. For MRM, no parameters were significantly different 

across rainfall, even the ones related to the left spectrum side [Lf(?)min, ?Lf(?)]. Again, for this 

scale, the variability within rainfall amount was too high to consider average spectra 

differences as a response to physical differences. This may confirm that on this soil and at this 

scale (from 10 to 800 mm), rainfall input is not enough to cause a modification on the general 

multifractal pattern of surface roughness. This type of soil is known to present high stability. 

Studying roughness changes by natural rainfall at the same soil, Castilho et al. (2011) noticed 

a reduction in total roughness after rainfall. However, they state that random clods would 

persist (i.e. undisrupted) even after 10 rainfall events. This stability favors a heterogeneous 

behavior of surface roughness even with rainfall.

Areas with a larger amount of stable clods will suffer less flatting by raindrop impact 

and/or moistening dismantlement, responding unpredictably to rainfall increase, which may 

create even rougher patterns. This behavior contributes to maintain a high variability of 

surface roughness even after rainfall application, which would reflect on the spectra. 

For MLT, that represents a larger scale, from 0.5 and 75 mm, the case was different. 

There were significant differences (p &amp;lt;0.10) for f(?) parameters D2, Lf(?)min and L?f(?). As 

explained before, f(?) can be interpreted as the fractal dimension of areas with same 

probability, and which scale organization relates to the magnitude of an specific ? range (? + 

 ?). In other words, f(?) is a fragmentation index of an specific class of probabilities, 

represented by a fractional number between 1 and 2 (i.e. topological dimension of a surface). 

Smaller the value of f(?), more fragmented is the region represented by this range of 

probabilities and smaller is the area covered by such features. On MLT, Lf(?)min significantly 

(p &amp;lt;0.10) decreases from 1.827, before rainfall, to 1.614, after 120 mm of rainfall. The 

Lf(?)min represents the dimension of areas with high probabilities (peaks). Therefore, the 

decrease in Lf(?)min means that peak areas are becoming more sparse, which would happen if 

the surface is getting flatter. Not only Lf(?)min is related to the flattening process, but it also 

shows at what degree the process diminishes at each rainfall amount, since it represents the 

area filling capacity of one class of probabilities. This may be better observed by L?f(?). It 

shows that the interval between D0, the average filling capacity of the system, and Lf(?)min, 

significantly (p &amp;lt;0.10) increase from 0.174 to 0.387. This means that after 120 mm of rainfall 

the peaks has twice less filling capacity than before rainfall, which implicates in twice less 

chance of finding high points  over the surface. 

For reasons explained in section 2.2.6.3, MLT does not have D0 = 2 for all images, 

which may dislocate D2. However, without considering the gross value of D0, the behavior 

across rainfalls must be explored. D2 is an specific value of f(?) that represents the correlation 

of the measures contained in a L size box. Thus, the increase from 1.952, before rainfall, to 

1.986, after 120 mm of rainfall, shows that the correlation is increasing with rainfall increase. 

That is, the local dimensions of different areas within an L size box, are becoming similar. 

This shows once again how the surface becomes homogeneous with rainfall increase, and that 

there is a positive spatial pattern, where higher heights will have more probability of being 

surround by other high points. 

For XRT the behavior was similar on f(?), with significant (p &amp;lt;0.10) differences on 

Lf(?)min, decreasing from 1.930 to 1.693, and L?f(?), increasing from 0.088 to 0.308. 

Nevertheless, XRT also had significant (p &amp;lt;0.10) differences for ? parameters ?max, ?R? and 



 
 

55 

?ratio. We have to remember that ? values show how height distribution changes 

proportionally to scale. It represents the slope of the linear relation of [logPi(L)/logL], and, 

because of the logarithm, smaller probabilities relate to higher ? values. That is why the right 

side of the spectrum is related to the micro-valleys (i.e. areas with small probabilities). Since 

it is a slope, ? represent the rate in which probabilities change along scales. ?max then 

represents how fast areas with smaller probabilities change across scale. For XRT, rainfall 

increase changes ?max from 2.090 to 2.028. Thus, rainfall enables a reduction in rate on which 

the micro-valleys distribution will change along scale. ?R?, which show how ?max distances 

from the systems average, decreases from 0.085 to 0.027, showing that, after rainfall, scale 

has four times less influence over low probabilities areas when compared with the average 

height of the surface. ?ratio is the relation between right and left side of the spectrum. That is, 

it shows which range of probabilities change more along the scales. Before rainfall, ?ratio is 

3.218, which means that valleys change more than peaks along the scales. At 80 mm of 

rainfall, the ratio almost becomes one (1.087), which indicate that extremes (i.e. peaks and 

micro-valleys) behave similarly among the scales. After 120 mm of rainfall ?ratio is 0.829, 

indicating that the low probabilities area changes less across scales than the peaks. 

Considering there were no significant differences (p &gt; 0.10) on Rf(?)min, the fragmentation of 

the micro-valleys is the same across rainfall, but with smaller differences among scales, which 

means the heights are closer to the average, i.e. more homogeneous. 

Differences across scales of measurement happened for almost all variables. Once again 

D2, Lf(?)min, L?f(?), ?max, ?R? and ?ratio had significant differences (p &amp;lt;0.10), but also there 

were differences (p &amp;lt;0.10) on D1, D0-D1, D0-D2, D1-D2, f(?)ratio, ?L?, ?R?, ?min and ?ratio. 

Only Rf(?)min and R?f(?), were not different across scales (p &gt; 0.10). This means the variance 

on the right side of spectra is too high to permit average differences between scales. The right 

side relates to the negative range of q’s, which mathematically contributes to enhance the 

variance of the estimates on this part of the spectrum. To circumvent such problem, some 

authors have used a method called “gliding box” to increase the number of L size boxes 

during calculations and diminish the variance on the right side of the spectra (GARCÍA 

MORENO et al., 2008). However, since 18 parameters were sensitive in differentiating scales 

in this research, the box-counting method seems to be suffice in analysis of this kind. In 

almost all comparison between f(?) parameters (D2, D0-D2, D1-D2, Lf(?)min, L?f(?)) MLT is 

not different (p &gt; 0.10) from XRT. For ? parameters (?L?, ?R? and ?ratio) this was not always 

true, with XRT presenting significantly smaller ?L? and ?R? and larger ?ratio values at 

different rainfall amounts. This diversity is related to the narrowing of the ? range with grid 



 
 

56 

increment. The finer grid, associated to a smaller area of measurement, influence the scale 

arrangement of probabilities, since differences in height start to diminish. However, it is 

interesting to note that the fragmentation is similar on these two scales of measurement.

scanner (XRT, 0.0745 - 30 mm; dashed line and x symbols) 



 
 

57 

Since no parameters were significant for MRM, we can only use the mutltifractal 

parameterization on MLT and XRT data. Considering the previous discussion, the 

regressions, according to rainfall, of the average parameters D2, Lf(?)min and L?f(?) from 

these two scales are displayed on Figure 12. Parameter D2 has the lowest R² (0.57, 0.70), and 

slopes (-0.00023, -0.00008) are very close to 0, with relatively high p-values (0.16, 0.11). 

Lf(?)min and L?f(?) had more significant (p &gt; 0.05, 0.01; 0.05, 0.02) slopes (-0.00161, -

0.00196; 0.00161, 0.00183), and models that better explain the variability along rainfall (R²= 

0.84, 0.96; 0.84, 0.93). Hence, these two variables are the most import for describing the soil 

surface roughness variability across rainfalls. Most importantly, since there are no significant 

differences (p &gt; 0.44, 0.65) between slopes of different measurement methods, one may be 

chosen over the other in the evaluation of the surface roughness. 

2.3.2 Physical attributes 

2.3.2.1 Bulk Density and Ratio of Volume of Pores 

In an initial evaluation we can use simple parameters that relate to soil structural 

changes. The average bulk density (BD) and ratio of volume of pores (Pr) are showed in Table 

5. Although we note an increase in BD after rainfall simulation, which causes a diminishing in 

Pr, differences were not significant (p &gt; 0.10).

There were no differences (p &gt;0.10) between rainfall amounts. 

 

One of the difficulties on trying to evaluate soil surface processes is to consider the 

scale in which they happen. The depth in which the sealing occurs for this soil is very narrow, 

as discussed in section 2.3.4. When observed in the microscope, most of the crusts, even after 

120 mm of rainfall, were smaller than 10 mm (i.e. 0.10 cm). Therefore, the height of the 

cylinder used for BD measurements had 2.5 times the width of the crust. Bergsma et al. 

(2000) cites that a crust can vary from a few millimeters to a maximum of 2 or 3 cm wide. 

This wide variance given by the authors is because their text try to create an international 

literature for soil erosion and conservation studies, which make it reasonable, in a world 



 
 

58 

scenario, to consider several classes of soils. As reported before, the soil of this study presents 

a very stable structure, theme that is going to be explored in section 2.3.2.2. Thus, is 

convenient to infer that the cylinder size was not enough to find differences between rainfall 

amounts, reason to why it was decided to divide the samples in narrower depths when 

computing the water retention curves that are showed in section 2.3.3.2. 

 

2.3.2.2 Aggregates stability 

The aggregates size distribution (ASD) and the weighted mean diameters (WMD) are 

shown in Table 6. Differences were not significant (p &gt; 0.10) between rainfall amounts for all 

pre-treatments, which reflects the high stability of such soil. However, a pattern is observed. 

Slow wetting (SW) had a higher concentration of aggregates bigger than 2 mm (903.15, 

916.23, 898.98 and 894.31 g kg
-1

), followed by the values from mechanical breakdown (MB) 

(585.29, 594.13, 551.66 and 534.27 g kg
-1

) and fast wetting (FW) (215.24, 193.83, 223.92 and 

184.92 g kg
-1

). Le Bissonnais (1996) states that it is common to find much smaller values for 

FW, since it relates to the slaking of dry soils when they are rapidly moistened (e.g. during 

tropical storms common during summer). Since this process is related to the raising pressure 

inside aggregates and clods, that may cause several internal ruptures in different parts of the 

structure, it is expected to have a higher degree of dismantlement, after all, it occurs 

simultaneously in several parts of the aggregate. 

Two facts are promptly noted by checking all pre-treatments. First, with regard to the  

differences between treatments, all distributions present relatively high WMD. Second, 

different distribution patterns occur after each pre-treatment, as can be seen in Figure 13, that 

shows the distributions according to equivalent diameters. FW curves covers a wider range of 

diameters, concentrating between 0.75 and 3.5 mm. MB is more concentrated around 1.5 and 

3.5 mm, and SW is dominated by aggregates with 3.5 mm of diameter. Although there were 

no differences (p &gt; 0.10) amongst rainfall amount, in FW we can better differentiate the 

curves according to rainfall, where 120 mm of rainfall decreases the amount of big 

aggregates, while increasing the concentration of very small aggregates (&amp;lt;0.053 mm). The 

curves for MB and SW behave similarly according to rainfall amount, being difficult to 

distinguish differences between simulations. 

With this information we can theorize which process is going to be dominant during 

clods disruption in this soil according to rainfall. At first, if the soil is dry when rainfall starts, 

big clods will suffer slaking, which will create wider distributions, with sizes reaching from 

centimeters to a few millimeters. When water starts to accumulate and the moisture 



 
 

59 

standardizes at the surface, the breakdown due to raindrop impact will be the dominant 

process, but not as effective, since most clods remain bigger than 1 mm. The results for SW 

show that almost no clod crumbles when the soil is already humid and water flux is slow. 

When studying surface roughness in the same area, Castilho et al. (2011) noticed the 

persistence of undisrupted random clods even after 10 natural rainfall events (with intensity &gt; 

25 mm h
-1

). This resistance is a natural feature of this class of soil. Brazilian Rhodic 

Kandiudalfs (SOIL SURVEY STAFF, 2014), i.e., Nitossolos Vermelhos eutroférrico 

(EMBRAPA, 2013), are known to present high contents of iron oxides, even in silt and sand 

fractions (FERREIRA et al., 2003), because of their parental material (basalt). That generates 

cohesive bonds that are difficult to break. The cohesive forces of such elements prevents 

dispersion by water alone, maintaining the structure stable for longer periods of time. Such 

soils even present a challenge during particles size analysis, since its total dispersion is very 

difficult due to these strong cohesive forces (CORÁ et al., 2009).

2.3.3 Hydrological attributes 

2.3.3.1 Unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity - K(?) 

In Table 7 are the values of K(?) in four tensions (1.5, 3, 4.5 and 6 cm). There were 

significant differences (p &amp;lt;0.10) between rainfall amounts and between tensions. K(?) was 

almost always significantly bigger at 1.5 cm, that represent pores with equivalent diameter of 

1.98 mm. At 40 mm of rainfall, for all tensions, K(?) drops almost to one third of its initial 

value in all tensions, which does not significantly change with increasing rainfall. In 40 mm 

differences between tensions starts to fade, with no significant differences between tensions of 

1.5 and 3 cm. At 120 mm of rainfall there were no significant differences (p &gt; 0.10) between 

all tensions. That means that with increasing rainfall the reorganization of the pores close to 

the surface causes a drastic change in the structure, probably standardizing pore sizes to a 

smaller equivalent diameter.  

 

Table 7 – Values of unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity at surface from a Rhodic 

Kandiudalf before (No rainfall) and after rainfall simulations (40, 80 and 120

At a tension of 6 cm there were no differences (p &gt; 0.10) between rainfall amounts. 

Thus, the porosity with equivalent diameter smaller than 0.50 mm was not affected by 

rainfall. Instead, rainfall caused pronounced changes in macropores bigger than 0.66 mm. 

Hence, changes in soil hydraulic conductivity from pores with equivalent diameter between 

0.66 and 1.98 mm may be related to changes in their size distribution, which would be 

reflected in the beginning of the water retention curve (WRC), and/or to changes in pores 

shape and connectivity, that can be evaluated by micromorphometrical analysis. 

 

2.3.3.2 Water Retention Curve – WRC 

In Figure 14 is possible to observe differences in average WRCs by rainfall amount and 

depth of measurement. There is a general decreasing in the dispersion of points with 

increasing rainfall, which is related to the homogenization of the structure within each 



 
 

62 

treatment. The curves show that rainfall causes differences in all three layers with increasing 

amount. However, main distinction occur at the superficial layer. In all rainfall amounts, the 

curves at surface stay beneath others (middle and subsurface) for most potentials (showed in 

pF, i.e., log10|-h| cm). 

Before rainfall, all curves presented similar shape and were closer to one another. This 

indicates that before rainfall the structure does not change from surface till the depth of 2.4 

mm. We can verify that by checking the WRC fitted parameters in Table 8. There are no 

differences between layers before rainfall for ?s (1.00, 1.00 and 1.00 kg kg
-1

) and ?r values 

are very close (0.14, 0.08 and 0.12 kg kg
-1

). Equality between ?s values shows that there is 

homogeneity in the part of the curve that represent structural pores. The ?r is more affected by 

the inclination of the curve, since it depends on the location of the inflection point at a lower 

potential (van GENUCHTEN, 1980), which shows when the porosity changes from structural 

to textural (DEXTER, 2004a). This can be observed by the ? and n parameters. Parameter ? 

presented a little increase on the middle curve (1.98, 2.48 and 1.31) while n presented a small 

decrease (1.30, 1.21 and 1.27). The parameter ? is related to the position of the inflection 

points, while n to the steepness of the curve (van GENUCHTEN, 1980). Higher ? indicates 

inflections closer to the end of the curve, i.e. higher percentage of structural pores, and lower 

n relates to smaller gradients  ?/ h, which is typical of curves that are less steep. Since the 

shape and ?s and ?r are very similar, there is no reason to consider differences between curves 

before rainfall. 

After 40 mm of rainfall, the curves of deeper layers (middle and subsurface) presented a 

different curvature when compared to the surface. Just with one rainfall there were changes in 

?s (1.00, 0.49 and 0.49 kg kg
-1

) and a positive linear behavior of ?r (0.16, 0.18 and 0.19 kg 

kg
-1

). It is easy to imagine that rainfall would decrease ?s at surface, due structural changes 

caused by sealing. However, values of ? (3.13, 0.06 and 0.03) and n (1.34, 1.64 and 1.83) 

show that deeper layers suffered more changes with the first application of simulated rainfall. 

The increase in steepness (i.e. increasing n) and decrease of structural porosity (i.e. decrease 

of ?), along with a linear increase in ?r, may point to an increase in clay content due to 

illuviation from the upper layer. The clay padding would explain the reduction of ?s. 

Imagining that structural pores are the first to be filled, a decrease of ? would also be 

plausible, and it is noteworthy that an increase in clay content would explain the rising of ?r.

Figure 14 – Average water retention curves from a Rhodic Kandiudalf before (No-rainfall) and after rainfall 

simulations (40, 80 and 120 mm). Averages calculated from quadruplicate soil cylinders (2.5 x 2.5 

cm) collected by rainfall amount. Each cylinder was divided in three parts (0.8 x 2.5 cm) to 

capture the transitions caused by soil sealing. Depths represent layers very close to soil actual 

surface (surface, 0 - 0.8 mm), an intermediate layer between parts that can be affected by sealing 

and the soil original structure (middle, 0.8 – 1.6 mm) and the layer less directly affected by rainfall 

(subsurface. 1.6 – 2.4 mm) 
 

At 80 mm all curves are once again very similar in shape and more superimposed. 

Nevertheless, they are less steep and displaced downward when compared to before rainfall, 

indicating a loss of structural porosity. Although ranges between ?s (1.00, 0.60 and 0.54 kg 

kg
-1

) and ?r (0.17, 0.16 and 0.17 kg kg
-1

) is larger than it was after 40 mm of rainfall, ? values 

(1.46, 0.20 and 0.08) are smaller at surface and n values are very similar (1.40, 1.38 and 1.43), 

corroborating the less steep shape. 

After 120 mm of rainfall there are profound differences between layers, with three very 

distinct curves. There is a huge difference between the values of ?s (0.37, 0.43 and 0.45 kg 

kg
-1

), while ?r (0.17, 0.18 and 0.19 kg kg
-1

) remains very close. This represents an immense 

difference in structure between the three layers, since at surface the soil retains 0.08 kg kg
-1

 



 
 

64 

less than at subsurface. Although the surface layer is the most degraded, changes occur  at all 

depths, since low ? values (0.02, 0.03 and 0.03) and high n values (10, 3.32 and 3.85) shows a 

complete change in soil behavior, with values very similar to ones found for sandy soils (van 

GENUCHTEN, 1980), where the lack of aggregation leads to more steep curves, with 

inflection occurring right at the beginning of the curve, at higher potentials.

Depths represent layers very close to soil actual surface (surface, 0 - 0.8 mm), an intermediate layer between 

parts that can be affected by sealing and the soil original structure (middle, 0.8 – 1.6 mm) and the layer less 

directly affected by rainfall (subsurface. 1.6 – 2.4 mm). All parameter were significant (p &amp;lt;0.05) for the 

regression 

*R² - coefficient of determination between real and predicted data 

**RSE – Residual standard error of the non-linear regression model 
 

Differences amongst rainfall amounts within each layer were more or less linear for 

deeper layers (middle and subsurface), and more abrupt at surface, with drastic changes from 

80 to 120 mm. This shows that the sealing process is not completely linear from surface to the 

underlying layers. Instead, changes occurs at different amounts at each depth, depending on 

which process is dominant at surface. For example, if clay dispersion is dominant, deeper 

layers will suffer faster changes than the overlying soil. If slaking and/or mechanical break 

starts to rearrange clods, the surface presents more changes.  

Since K(?) presents great changes right after the first rainfall, and curves at surface 

change gradually across rainfall amount, other features must be changing to impede water 

movement. The WRC shows structural differences related to retentions characteristics, that 

may be extrapolated to pores size distribution if bulk density is known. However, soil 

conductivity does not only depends on pore sizes, but also on its shape, tortuosity and 



 
 

65 

connectivity. Shape and connectivity can be easily estimated by micromorphometrical 

analysis. 

 

2.3.4 Image Pore Analysis 

2.3.4.1 Micromorphometrical analysis 

The distribution of the percentage of area of pores by format and size are presented in 

Table 9. A graphical representation can be found in Figure 15. Independently of the rainfall 

amount and depth, the dominant class of pores was the complex with diameters larger than 

1000 µm. This type of pore is associated to the degree of connectivity in a pore system. The 

definition of “complex” is an allusion to the difficulty to define such pores based on a unique 

diameter value, since they are not circular or elongated. Thus, complex pores are normally 

more ramified, and bigger this pore is, higher is the chance of connectivity throughout the 

system. At the same time that complex pores (&gt; 1000 µm) dominated, they changed (p &amp;lt;0.10) 

with the rainfall volumes applied on the surface layer, with a decrease in area from 35.360 %, 

before rainfall, to 20.308 % after 120 mm of rainfall. The fact that this happened only at the 

surface is associated to the sealing process, which modifies the soil structure only at the first 

few millimeters of the soil surface. On the other hand, the average of this class of pores was 

larger at the 40 mm rainfall than before rainfall,  but the differences were not significant, 

which is evidently related to the high variability within this treatment. Analogously to the 

surface roughness discussion, initial rainfall increases variability within the soil, instead of 

standardizing it due to clod disruption, especially considering the high stability of the 

aggregates of this soil. The more stable parts will disrupt less, so at the beginning of the 

rainfall event the variability increases, until soil moisture standardizes, and the structure at the 

surface starts to breakdown. 

The smaller area occupied by complex pores (&gt; 1000 µm) was followed by an increase 

in the area of smaller size pores, such as smaller complex (500 – 1000 µm and 100 - 200 µm) 

and elongated (20 - 50 µm) types. Rounded pores did not present differences (p &gt; 0.10) for all 

sizes within the soil surface among rainfalls. This may be associated to the very small area 

covered by such pores and the high variability of the pore systems. Analyzing the behavior of 

the means, an increase of almost all rounded pores as rainfall volume increases can be 

observed. This may show that the pore structure is becoming less and less connected. 

When comparing depths at the same rainfall volume it is interesting to note that, before 

rainfall, there is practically no differences (p &gt; 0.10) between layers, meaning that the whole 5 

cm layer is homogeneous. The biggest differences between depths are observed at the 80 mm 



 
 

66 

volume of rainfall, with all complex pores from 100 to 1000 µm decreasing as depth 

increases. Although changes by rainfall occur mainly at the surface, the accumulative rainfall 

can cause a collapse of the structure due to increase moistening, which weakens cohesive 

bonds, thanks to the lubricant action of water. This favors the increase of the bulk density in 

deeper layers, which might be confused with crust formation. We can infer that this is not the 

case here, since the distribution of rounded pores decreases, which is the contrary of what 

happen in a sealed layer, where the area of rounded pores rises due to fragmentation of big 

complex and elongated pores. Hence, the pore structure is not being morphologically changed 

from complex and connected pores into rounded and disconnected ones. Instead, there is an 

underlying process in which the whole area of pores is diminishing.

subsurface (40 – 50 mm)

Another important factor, that must be take into account in the discussion of pore 

connectivity, is the number of pores. For example, if a soil has a high percentage of area 

covered by complex pores with diameter larger than 1000 µm, but these are divided into 100 

units, it is easy to understand that this pore system would be little connected when compared 

to one with same area but represented by only 10 units. The idea of connectivity is important 

in a conservationist point of view, since it allows the soil to infiltrate and percolate water 

more easily and faster, increasing the initiation time and diminishing the volume of runoff. 

The number of pores by type and size are found in Table 10 and the graphical 

representation is in Figure 16. Again differences (p &amp;lt;0.01) between rainfall amounts occurred 

only at the surface, with an increase of the number of complex (200 – 400 µm and 500 – 1000 

µm), elongated (20 – 50 µm) and rounded (50 – 100 µm) pores. As stated in the area of pores 

discussion above, the fact that the area of big complex pores was significantly diminished and 

divided between the types cited above (smaller complex, elongated and rounded pores), one 

can infer that rainfall is indeed decreasing connectivity at the surface, attributing this to the 

soil surface sealing process. We note that several size classes are empty, which make it 

plausible to summarize them into broader size classes to facilitate interpretation. In Table 11, 

and Figure 17 and Figure 18, we find the same dataset divided into three size classes (large, 

medium and small). Some differences (p &amp;lt;0.10) are not observed as before, especially 

because variances within each class are increased. However, the average presented in each 

condensed class has similar behavior as to the one of the previous classes. At the surface, 

there is a linear decrease of large complex pores with rainfall increase, followed by a 

significant (p &amp;lt;0.01) increase in the area of medium complex, medium elongated, small 

elongated and small rounded pores. Differences (p &amp;lt;0.10) between depths occur primarily 

after 80 mm of rainfall. Number of pores at the surface increase (p &amp;lt;0.10) substantially with 

rainfall volume, especially the small rounded ones. Important to note that, after 120 mm of 

rainfall, the number of pores in several classes is bigger (p &amp;lt;0.10) then the one at the same 

rainfall in a deeper layer. This shows how significantly the structure has changed at surface 

due to sealing.

2.3.4.2 Multifractal analyses of pores 

When we first look at the average multifractal spectra by rainfall amount and depth 

(Figure 19) is a little difficult to observe a standard behavior according to rainfall. At surface, 

the spectrum after 120 mm of rainfall presents the minimum f(?) at both left and right side, 

and also the wider ? range, which could mean that sealing causes an increase on the 

fragmentation of the pore system, with big pores becoming less frequent along the system (i.e. 

smaller f(?) at left side) at same time small pores become more frequent, since this is the only 

treatment that presents a right spectrum side. In the subsequent layer, after the first rainfall (40 

mm) the pores became less fragmented, reaching higher f(?) values for most part of the 

spectra. At subsurface all treatments were much more similar. All rainfall amounts induced a 

more fragmented left side, indicating that big pores distribution did not change at this layer 

with increasing rainfall. At the same time, the spectrum before rainfall had a wider right side, 

which could mean that, for this treatment, small pores are more equally distributed along 

scales. Other interpretations are difficult to be made only by a visual approach. Thus, we now 

take our attention to the parameters contained in Table 12. 

 

Figure 19 – Multifractal spectra of area of pores from a Fine Rhodic Kandiudalf before (No rainfall) and after 

rainfall simulations (40, 80 and 120 mm), obtained from the average of triplicate images of 

quadruplicates blocks of soil. Soil blocks were impregnated and images taken in three depths, 

parallel to the real surface of the soil: surface (0-10 mm), middle (20- 30 mm) and subsurface (40 – 

50 mm) 

At surface, differences (p &amp;lt;0.10) with rainfall increase occurred positively for D0-D1, 

D0-D2, D1-D2, L?f(?) and ?L?, and negatively for Lf(?)min and ?min. D1 is the entropy 

dimension, following the information entropy definition (SHANNON; WEAVER, 1949). 

Thus, D1 represents the heterogeneity of the system (MARTÍNEZ et al., 2009), since it 

measures the decrease in information as the box size increase during the box-counting 



 
 

76 

analysis (POSADAS et al., 2003). A decrease in D1 when compared to D0, i.e., an increase in 

D0-D1, implicates an increase in heterogeneity. As mentioned in the soil roughness 

discussion section, D2 represents the correlation of the measure contained in a L size box 

(POSADAS et al., 2003). Therefore, a decrease in D2 with regard to D0, i.e., D0-D2, 

implicates diminishing correlation, and in comparison to D1, i.e., D1-D2, means that 

correlation drops faster than the rate in which information is lost. Rainfall caused an increase 

in heterogeneity, noted by D0-D1 (0.07, 0.07, 0.09 and 0.10), and a decrease in correlation 

marked by D0-D2 (0.15, 0.14, 0.21 and 0.21). The fact that D0 did not change significantly 

shows that the system’s average is not altered, which would mean that all changes are related 

to the displacement between small and big pores distributions, without big changes in the total 

area of pores. This agrees with the summarized micromorphometrical results, where, while no 

differences (p &gt; 0.10) were found for area of pores on most of the sizes (large, medium and 

small) and classes (complex, elongated and rounded), there were several differences (p &amp;lt;

0.10) in the number of pores, indicating an increase in the fragmentation of the porosity with 

rainfall increase. 

Rainfall also increased D1-D2 intervals (0.07, 0.06, 0.12 and 0.11). While large 

complex pores decreased most in area, the increase in the number of pores was more 

pronounced for the class of small rounded ones, going from 424 before rainfall, to 662 after 

120 mm (Table 11). Considering the creation of new rounded pores from the collapse of big 

complex pores as spatial dependent, and that spots where the structure is weaker are going to 

fade more easily and faster than others, we can imagine that the final geometry of the pore 

system is going to be unequally distributed. Therefore, correlation between different regions 

would drop fast with increasing rainfall. In contrast, D1 gives the probability of pore 

occupation of the ith L size box without considering the way they are distributed (VÍDAL 

VAZQUEZ et al., 2008). Thus, even if information loss along scales is affected by rainfall, 

any geometrical distribution would promptly affect D2, making it to drop faster than D1. 

Vidal Vázquez et al. (2008) also used the multifractal formalism to evaluate changes caused 

by rainfall, but with regard to the pores size distribution obtained by Hg porosimetry. Their 

results were very similar for D1, D0-D1 and Lf(?)min. However, their differences for D2 were 

not significant (p &amp;lt;0.5).

Other parameters from the left side of the spectrum that also increased (p &amp;lt;0.10) with 

rainfall are L?f(?) and ?L?, while, in contrast, Lf(?)min and ?min decreased. The left side shows 

the Hausdorff dimensions and the Lipschitz-Holder exponents related to the large pores. A 

decrease in Lf(?)min indicates an increase on the fragmentation of large pores, which was 

discussed before considering D1 and D2. The decrease of ?min was followed by the increase of 

?L?, i.e., there was no displacement of ?(f(?)max). This shows that the scale relation for the 

fragmentation of large pores has also changed. Narrower ? ranges are related to more 

homogeneous pore systems (POSADAS et al. 2003; VIDAL VÁZQUEZ et al., 2010), where, 

sometimes, D0 is enough to represent the whole system. Increasing ?L? followed by a 

decrease in Lf(?)min indicate that larger pores were fragmented into smaller pores, which are 

distinguished from the previous class by featuring a distinct degree of fractality, i.e., a 

different Hausdorff dimension.  

When  we examine the middle layer, more differences (p &amp;lt;0.10) are noted: D0, D1, D2, 

Rf(?)min, Lf(?)min, R?f(?), f(?)ratio, ?min, ?max, ?R? and ?ratio. However, these differences look 

random at first, i.e., they do not follow a trend across rainfall amount. Nevertheless, this is 

further evidence that, during the sealing process, changes do occur at deeper layers, even if it 

is difficult to find a pattern. What we note is that, instead of a linear trend, most differences 

occur after the first rainfall (40 mm). D0, D1 and D2 reach their maximum after this rainfall 

amount. As explained before, D1 and D2 increase implicates in a decrease in information loss 

over scales and an increase in correlation between different regions of the measure, 

respectively. Posadas et al. (2003) found high correlations between D0 and total area of pores. 

Since D0 is the average Hausdorff dimension of the system, which represents the underlying 

fragmentation process, this is expected to happen. The middle layer had a much higher 

percentage of pores area after 40 mm of rainfall (46.45 %) when compared to other treatments 

(32.25, 39.96 and 34.40 %). 

Many other parameters follow the same behavior, by peaking (Lf(?)min, f(?)ratio, ?min and 

?ratio) after 40 mm of rainfall. In contrast, Rf(?)min decreases with rainfall input, reaching its 

minimum after 120 mm of rainfall. Rf(?)min is the Hausdorff dimension, i.e. the fragmentation 

index, of very small pores. Thus, a decreasing Rf(?)min indicate a reduction of the contribution 

of small pores, i.e., the area of small pores is reduced. This corroborates in parts the 

micromorphometrical data, since smaller Rf(?)min after 40 mm of rainfall (1.82, 1.71, 1.77 and 

1.68) is paired with smaller area covered by small elongated  (0.04, 0.02, 0.03 and 0.04) and 

rounded (1.52, 0.94, 1.09 and 1.37) pores. In the case of 120 mm, even if the area of these 



 
 

79 

classes of pores increase when compared to 80 mm, we note that the number of pores in such 

classes also increase, which also interferes in the fragmentation of the system. 

At the deepest layer (subsurface) two parameters of the left side of the spectra presented 

differences (p &amp;lt;0.10) with rainfall increase (D1-D2, L?f(?)). However attentions must be 

paid to the significance of the differences for qmin values. While differences were significant 

(p &amp;lt;0.10) for qmin in all layers, two facts contributed to the lack of discussion of this 

parameter in other depths. First, differences were less pronounced at surface and middle, with 

ranges of 0.3 and 0.2, respectively, than at subsurface, ranging 0.4. Secondly, the magnitude 

and order of parameters from the left side did not always accompanied the differences 

between qmin values at upper layers. For example, at surface, the minimum Lf(?)min was 1.78, 

even with when L?f(?) was the shortest.  

Considering this last statement, is important to remember that fragmentation is a 

measure of two things: the filling capacity of a process, i.e., larger the area covered by the 

object, larger its Hausdroff dimension is; and the degree of brokenness, i.e. more divided the 

object is in the system, smaller its Hausdroff dimension is. The results above for the porosity 

of a Rhodic Kandiudalf, measured by two-dimensional image analysis, seems to demonstrate 

that most multifractal parameters are associated not only to the area of pores, but also to the 

number of pores at each level of size and shape. 

The differences (p &amp;lt;0.10) between depths within each rainfall amount show that the 

surface had higher values when compared to the underlying layers of soil, for all the left side 

parameters, while the contrary holds for some parameters of the right side. Most of the time, 

the middle layer was the opposite of the surface. For example, while D0, D1 and D2 had the 

highest values at surface before rainfall (1.93,1.86 and 1.80), the middle had the lowest (1.89, 

1.80 and 1.72), while the subsurface got intermediate values (1.89,01.81,1.74). This just 

indicates that, at surface, the area of big pores was higher during all rainfalls, which 

corroborates some of the micromorphometrical results. The middle layer works as a transition 

between a very opened surface, i.e. a layer with high percentage of pores, to a mild 

fragmented subsurface. When rainfall starts to act on the soil, transformations seems to be 

more pronounced in this transition, especially on the right side of the spectrum. This means 

that, although this layer has smaller pores, those are less stable than the ones at the surface, 

since particles tend to close more the pores at this layer than at surface.

3 CONCLUSIONS 

The multifractal spectra is sensitive to structure changes caused by rainfall. Considering 

the soil surface roughness, the multifractal parameterization is useful to evaluate 

modifications, caused by rainfall, on very fine scales. However, for the soil of this study, it is 

not possible to use the multifractal approach in datasets with resolutions coarser than 10 mm, 

since a pattern could not be found in such scale, i.e., MRM. There seems to be a relation 

between decreasing grid resolution and increase in randomness of heights, since other 

classical index, i.e., RRi, also could not distinguish changes provoked by rainfall. The 

multifractal behavior of this soil is not distinguishable (p &amp;lt;0.10) between measurements 

made at minimum resolutions of 0.074 mm and 0.5 mm. Therefore, is more convenient to use 

the device that work closer to the upper part of this range, i.e., MLT, for two reasons: its 

lower cost and greater area coverage. Considering the area and number of pores, obtained by 

micromorphometrical techniques, the multifractal behavior changed according to sealing 

development and depth of measurement, being sensitive to the changes in the pores size 

distribution and their fragmentation degree within each size class. Whereas this soil presents 

dominant complex pores across rainfall amounts and layers, it is not possible to correlate any 

spectra parameter to pores shape modification. 

Some multifractal parameters are suitable for modeling steps of soil surface degradation 

by rainfall. The Hausdorff dimensions at the left side of the spectrum are the parameters most 

sensitive to physical changes related to rainfall erosion. Lf(?)min, L?f(?) and D2 were the 

parameters that often showed a linear behavior with increasing rainfall amount, considering 

both surface roughness and area of pores measurements. However, D2 from porosity was not 

different (p &gt; 0.10) along rainfall amounts at surface. In this case, D0-D1, D0-D2 and D1-D2 

presented as parameters that could be used to describe the changes in the pore system.
