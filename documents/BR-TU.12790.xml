Libya  
 

The history of Libya is parallel to that of other once-colonized nations. Therefore, it 

displays economic, class, gender, religious, and ethnic inequalities. Libya gained 

independence from Italy in 1951. The country became The United Kingdom of Libya, 

a constitutional and hereditary monarchy. After the discovery of oil reserves and a 

large income from petroleum sales, Libya established as a wealthy nation.	
  However, 

discontent arises with the concentration of the country’s wealth in the power sphere.  

On September of 1969, a group of military officers led by Muammar Gaddafi launch 

Libyan Revolution and deposing the king Idris. The constitution was abolished and 

policies were outlined in the "Green Book" - a proposal of Gaddafi to improve and 

develop the country. Keeping Libya debt-free, the government improved the income 

per capita and increased the ranking of the country in the Human Development Index 

to the higher in Africa. However, since the 1970s most of the oil profits was spent on 

arms and supporting terrorist groups. Without any elections or democratic nature, in 

1977 Libya became "Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya" and Gaddafi 

got unlimited power. In 1986 there was a failed assassination attempt against Gaddafi 

and shortly thereafter, Libya was under UN sanctions. 

The “Permanent Revolution” of Gaddafi has been characterized by its brutality and 

extravagance. The dictator prohibited private ownership and retail trade, banned 

press, controlled the military, implemented the sharia and pursued dissidents. Libya’s 

decades of international isolation left the country without no political alliances or 

national organizations of any kind. Libyan society has been fractured, divided by the 

cleavages of kinship and region. In recent years, Gaddafi went from anti-Western 

terrorist dictator into a semi-Western ally in the global war against terrorism and 

fundamentalist Islamism. 

 

The Arab Spring 

At the beginning of the year 2011, revolutions in several Arab countries were 

highlighted in the worldwide media agenda. Social media played an important role in 

these political changes. The "Arab Spring" hit Tunisia, Egypt, Bahrain, Syria, Libya, 

Jordan, Morocco, Algeria, Yemen, Oman and Djibouti. The Internet and social media 

were considered as determinant. Social media applications such as Facebook, Twitter, 



YouTube or Flickr have been identified as key to the revolution in the Arab world. 

These platforms were the epicenter of Arab regional social media innovation and help 

built communities. 

The labels "Twitter Revolution" and "Facebook Revolution" fulfilled many 

newspaper titles. However, demographic issues as well as social and political patterns 

between countries were very diverse. Compare substantially different economies and 

cultures become habitual although created fallacies. Activists and opposition of 

dictatorial governments used technology to share ideas and disseminate their message. 

Nevertheless, the main issue is that these uses resonated in different ways in the local 

contexts and in the global sphere. Therefore, was the social media a facilitator of the 

revolution? There is no consensual answer. Yet it became clear that the political 

developments in the Arab showed that the youth used the Internet as a political 

platform and a tool to mobilize people for change.  

The use of platforms such as Facebook and Twitter highlighted the shift from social 

tools to political tools. Not only in the Arab world but mainly in the Arabian 

Diaspora. Through social media, the Diasporas have been instrumental to the change. 

However, broadcast media have not been redundant in the revolutionary processes. 

The role of Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabiya channels television were also very important.  

As Libyan regime was based on a society fractured into clan’s networks, armed rebels 

ignited the protests within the eastern provinces. The first manifestations in Libya 

began on February 15th 2011 and in the following days more than a dozen protesters 

were killed in confrontations with pro-Gaddafi tribes and secret police. The 

demonstrations hostile to government intransigence and brutal repression against 

protesters degenerated in a revolt that spread rapidly through the eastern part of the 

country, traditionally opposed to Gaddafi. In April 2011, the New York Times 

reported that two of the sons of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi attempted to 

articulate a transition to a constitutional democracy that would include the step-down 

of the father from power. The transition would be conducted by one of Gaddafi's sons, 

Saif al-Islam Gaddafi. The rebels, however, rejected the proposal. NATO took the 

command of military operations in Libya. The decision was taken unanimously by 

member states of the organization, after several days of tough negotiations on 

NATO's role and its ability to perform or not air strikes on ground targets.  

Even with the declared defeat of pro-Gaddafi forces and complete occupation of the 

territories, Saif al-Islam remained in hiding in the south of the country until his 



capture in November 2011. In addition, members of the former government escaped 

to Niger, despite the violence when they were detected by troops from that country. 

 

Role of Social Media 

Although digital migration is still in it early years in Libya, the use of social media for 

external dissemination of protests revealed the tribal and regional cleavages in the 

country. In Libya, the Internet penetration rate was quite low: only 5.4% of the 

population had access in June 2010 and in March 2011, only 1.1% had created 

account on Facebook. These numbers demonstrate how is not possible to argue that 

social media has been the main impulse of the uprising in Libya. From an internal 

perspective, the numbers demystify the idea of “Facebook Revolution" or "Twitter 

Revolution".  

Numerous Facebook pages and hundreds of thousands of tweets supported the protest. 

Moreover, the role of mobile devices has been significantly important, both in 

messaging and for conveying information across the Internet. On 18 February, the 

regime has disabled the Internet hoping to smother manifestations. Nevertheless, on 

the contrary, they increase, culminating in bloody clashes between rebels and loyal to 

Gadhafi. As social media encouraged the free expression, Gaddafi’s regime replied 

with brutal repression and arrests. As a consequence, the rise of an independent social 

media in the Diaspora resulted in an increasing of citizen engagement within 

communication technologies. Therefore, social media also were used as “watchdog” 

of official Libyan press and disseminated information to the Western world. Several 

Twitter campaigns were directed to public figures and against political actors in 

Libya. In the same perspective, the Libyan government also tried to resist and become 

active particularly on Twitter. The second son of Gaddafi, Saif al-Islam, also tried to 

use social media for spreading his message to the international community and 

present his determination to govern Libya and move the country toward democracy. 

As the revolution has several social and political actors, it became clear the 

appropriation of the technique as a method of propaganda. “The YouTube war” 

exposed the uses of social media platforms for the purposes of political dissident and 

activist organizations. There were many suspicions as to the contents published and 

confirmation of information was increasingly difficult, with armed rebels on the 

ground to hinder the work of media professionals. The propaganda war has become 

evident in video content but also in fake pages created on Facebbok and false 



information disseminated on Twitter. The different streams in social media caused 

many questions about the veracity of what was actually happening in the country. 

Journalists and bloggers faced serious repercussions for expressing independent 

opinion and publishing reliable and impartial information. Several social media 

campaigns demanded rights for Internet users, journalists, citizen journalists and 

bloggers. The Gaddafi regime severely repressed digital dissidents. The 

imprisonments were emblematic for a control of digital space. Hence Libyan 

Diaspora has often been the source of information of what was happening inside the 

country for the outside world and international audiences. In fact, Libyan youth 

movement in the Diaspora reported directly to Twitter and Facebook and tagged the 

messages with the hashtag #feb17. 

As Tripoli collapsed into a civil war, social media were used for empower the 

revolution as well as to place the message into a transnational sphere. On Twitter, 

users from around the world tagged tweets with the hashtag #feb17 as an international 

demonstration of solidarity for the pro-democracy protests. The media professionals 

dialogued directly with users through these streams and relied to the techniques of 

semantic classification to remain at the forefront of publishing content and attracting 

audiences. 

The new tools implemented different (simple and, simultaneously, complex) social 

objects that promoted new practices: to subscribe, to like, to retweet, to digg, to 

share… This means that users’ online behavior can be studied as an activity. 

Therefore, social practices can be labeled as the lead to social action and to social 

interaction. The role of hashtags in Libyan revolution was relevant as it promoted 

adherence to social and political movements, ensured information streams, indexed 

messages to contents and disseminated information by communication channels that 

promote collective action through social interactions. Social media and social 

practices of semantic web advertised the revolution as a whole organized and created 

ties that sustained communities and mobilized civic action. 

The NATO intervention in Lybia was also an issue that has been much discussed in 

social networks and led the rebels to impose severe punishments to critics. What 

seemed like a revolution for democracy began to cause questions in social networks 

and in the Libyan youth movement in the Diaspora. 

After five months of being blocked, by August 2011, the Internet was available again 

to the Libyan public. The capture of Gaddafi and his death at the hands of the rebels 



seemed to put an end to civil war, in October 2011. Though Libya is currently 

undergoing on a political reconstruction, widespread corruption and scarcity of basic 

goods still occur. The main issue is state formation and not only democratization. The 

6.4 million people in Libya are still living fearing a war and divided among the 

different provinces. The rebels took the power but democracy was not declared and 

social media continue to be a support to expose what is happening in the country. As 

media professionals began to redirect attention to the Syria, social platforms have 

become the only medium to disseminate information on the real situation in Libya. 

The youth in the Diaspora returned to play an important role after the disillusionment 

with the fall of Tripoli to the rebels. 

The opposition to Gaddafi who took power understood the role of network and 

satellites. Internet cuts aim to end communications with the outside world. Yet the 

attempts were frustrated because users can get to Twitter via SMS and virtual private 

networks and proxy servers that allow secure remote access to external networks. 

Attempts to limit communications with the outside world not only failed as it 

highlights in social media that there is another need for change.  

Social media continued to play an important role at this stage in the disclosure of the 

country situation and the evolution and social revolt. After the elections in July 2012, 

the new leaders of the country have difficulty imposing his authority over the rebel 

brigades who fought the Gaddafi regime in 2011. Some militias believe that their 

legitimacy is stronger than that of elected officials. The population responded by 

organizing demonstrations and managed to oust Islamist groups. Through the Internet 

and social media, Amnesty International reported that although most human rights 

violations had occurred by the forces of the deposed regime, supporters of the new 

regime would also be involved in torture and murder. Facebook pages and Twitter 

continue to have a very significant impact on the disclosure of internal information of 

the country, often replacing the media professionals. Moreover, social media started 

to be complementary to satellite TV that is assumed to be partial. Bloggers and citizen 

journalists continue to be harassed and Internet access is still controlled by the 

authorities and militias, according to Reporters Without Borders and Amnesty 

International. 

The critical mass of Twitter, mostly Western, considers unacceptable this kind of 

pressure on citizens and condemned the way Gaddafi was executed. The trial of the 

son of the dictator, prisons and repression of digital dissident are now the most 



discussed topics in social media. Despite the hashtag #feb17 refer to February 2011 

and the beginning of the revolution, it continues to be used to index content on the 

Libyan situation. 

The use of social media cannot be interpreted as a direct cause that induced changes 

in Libya. Cyberspace was the link between different networks and established new 

public spheres for debate. Digital media has individualized, localized and structured a 

collective consciousness. Within this new news ecosystem, political uses of social 

media were also exposed.  Social media don’t generate revolutions but may facilitate 

them and aided political actors to transform their public image. Nevertheless, social 

media can change the nature of news, just as Arab satellite channels helped to 

broadcast the revolution.
