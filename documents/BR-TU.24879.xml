RESUMO 
 

ORSOLINI, A. L. B. Metodologia para definição de novos setores operacionais 
para operações de offloading com navios DP em plataformas ancoradas em 
Spread Mooring. 2017. 142 p. Dissertação (Mestrado) – Departamento de 
Engenharia Naval e Oceânica da Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, 2017.  

 

Esta dissertação define e aplica uma metodologia para analisar a possibilidade de 

extensão do setor operacional de navios aliviadores DP para operações de 

offloading em plataformas FPSO ancoradas em Spread-Mooring. Esta proposta 

apresenta como vantagens o aumento da disponibilidade das operações e redução 

na demanda de energia do navio DP em certas condições ambientais. O estudo é 

importante tendo em vista que várias desconexões de emergência já ocorreram 

durante operações de alívio na Bacia de Santos, porque o navio-tanque foi 

empurrado para fora do setor verde por resultantes ambientais que apontavam para 

oeste. No entanto, a proposta deve ser cuidadosamente analisada para garantir que 

o novo setor não aumenta os riscos de colisão, de poluição ambiental e de 

segurança às pessoas. A metodologia consiste em cinco etapas básicas: Análise 

Preliminar de Riscos (APR); avaliação do ganho de disponibilidade da operação; 

avaliação da demanda de energia do sistema DP nos setores original e estendido; 

simulações de manobra em tempo real; e, finalmente, testes em campo para 

validação da proposta. Esta dissertação apresenta a contextualização do problema, 

pesquisa bibliográfica, conceitos teóricos, a metodologia detalhada e os resultados 

de cada etapa. Os resultados mostram que o ganho médio de disponibilidade é 

significativo nas bacias de Campos e de Santos – até 9% e 13%, respectivamente – 

e que os riscos adicionais criados pela extensão do setor são devidamente 

mitigados se as recomendações levantadas na APR forem implementadas. A 

conclusão desta dissertação é que estender o setor operacional é, não somente 

benéfico, mas também seguro.

ABSTRACT 
 

ORSOLINI, A. L. B. Methodology for definition of new operating sectors for DP 
assisted offloading operations in spread-moored platforms. 2017. 142 p. Thesis 
(Master’s Degree) – Naval architecture and Marine engineering department of 

University of São Paulo, São Paulo, 2017.  

 

This thesis defines and applies a methodology for analyzing the possibility of 

extending the operating sector of DP shuttle tankers for offloading operations in 

Spread Moored FPSO Platforms. Extending the operating sector is beneficial to 

increase operations’ availability and to reduce DP power demand under certain 

environmental conditions. This study is important, since several emergency 

disconnections have occurred during offloading in Santos Basin because the shuttle 

tanker was pushed out of the green sector by environmental resultants that pointed 

to the West. However, this proposal has to be carefully analyzed in order to 

guarantee the operations’ safety and not to increase the risks of collision between 

FPSO and shuttle tanker, of oil pollution and of personnel safety. The methodology 

consists in five basic steps: Preliminary Risk Analysis to assess the potential hazards 

associated with the new sector; evaluation of the uptime gain through static analysis; 

evaluation of DP power demand inside the original and extended sector; real time 

simulations to evaluate the operation in a realistic environment; and, finally, field tests 

to validate the proposal. This thesis presents the contextualization of the problem, a 

bibliographical research, theoretical concepts, the detailed methodology and results 

of each step. The results show that the average uptime gain is significant both in 

Campos and Santos Basins – up to 9% and 13% respectively – and that the 

additional risks created by the sector extension are well mitigated if some 

recommendations are put into place. The conclusion of this thesis is that extending 

the operating sector is not only beneficial but also safe. 

 

Keywords: offloading, DPST, Dynamic Positioning, shuttle tanker, FPSO.

1 INTRODUCTION 

Oil extraction activity at sea initiated between the 30s and the 50s, first in 

Venezuela and then in the Gulf of Mexico using fixed platforms, which consist of 

large metal or concrete structures carved on the seabed. In these types of system, 

the Christmas tree (set of valves controlling the well production) and processing units 

are positioned above water level on the platform’s deck, which is called dry 

completion, and the produced oil flows through subsea pipelines to the onshore 

terminals. 

Along with the technology of fixed units, a series of drilling platform technologies 

was developed - including rigs on barges, on ships, on semi-submersible platforms 

(SS) and jack-ups (self-elevating units) - which allowed the continued expansion of 

offshore activity. 

Thus, at the beginning of the 80s it became clear that although there was seismic 

and drilling technology to operate in deep water, the same did not occur with the 

production technologies. Fixed production systems have assumed increasing 

dimensions and their costs tend to increase exponentially with increased water 

depth.  

A number of solutions were proposed to overcome this problem, including 

compliant tower platforms, articulated towers and tension leg platforms (TLP). The 

latter started to gain importance in the exploration and production activities in the 

Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea as it allowed to be installed in deeper fields and still 

keeping dry completion. 

The first applications of wet completion technology, in which the Christmas tree 

are installed underwater lying on the seabed, were introduced in the North Sea. It 

was in this region that the first floating production systems (FPS) were developed, 

during the 70s (Furtado, 1996), but only in the 80/90 decades that the first floating 

units with wet completion were implemented. 

The uprising of the concept of semi-submersible production units overcame the 

barrier of deep water and allowed reaching even ultra-deep waters. PETROBRAS 

installed the first SS in Brazil in 1983, in Corvina oil field whose depth is 230m. 

Even though the SSs have represented an important development for the 

offshore activities, oil field discoveries in more distant areas from the coast have 

imposed major challenges with regard to the transportation of produced oil to the 



 19 

shore. The SSs, as well as the fixed units, are designed to treat the oil extracted from 

the well and then transfer it to the onshore terminals by major underwater pipelines. 

The increasing distance of the oil fields to the coast makes the projects of underwater 

pipelines ever more complicated and costly.  

Therefore, the concepts of Floating Storage and Offloading units, (FSO), and of 

Floating Production Storage and Offloading units (FPSO) started to gain more 

importance. The first consists of an anchored tanker that stores the oil produced by 

other platforms in its cargo tanks inside the hull and exports it to a ship called shuttle 

tanker – in an operation called offloading – that transports it to the coast. The second 

consists of a more complete and independent unit, which produces the oil extracted 

from the well, stores it in its cargo tanks and performs the offloading. Figure 1-1 

below shows examples of FSO and FPSO units. It is possible to differentiate easily 

the two types of units because FPSOs present several facilities installed on the 

topsides – which is the production plant – while the FSOs present a not so congested 

main deck, because they do not need a production plant.

The first FPSO in the world, Shell Castellon, was installed in 1977 in the 

Mediterranean Sea (Offshore Post, 2017). In Brazil, the first FPSO was installed in 

1979 as an early production system, but the boom of FPSO construction and 

installation only happened at the beginning of the 90s due to the increased 

production of Campos Basin (Henriques and Brandão, 2007). This concept has 

become so important in the offshore industry that more than 150 units are now 

operating worldwide being 30 units in Brazil. 

Over the years, PETROBRAS has demonstrated its great preference for FPSOs 

for oil exploration, especially in Santos Basin (BS), a region where part of the 



 20 

Brazilian pre-salt is found, where the fields are located up to 300 km from the coast 

and water depths are up to 2,500 m. Only 16 semi-submersible units make part of 

PETROBRAS fleet and, until 2020, 20 more FPSO units will be installed in Santos 

and other basins (PETROBRAS, 2015a).  

1.1 FPSO mooring systems 

It is important to define the two types of FPSO mooring systems that can be 

found in the industry: Single Point Mooring (SPM) and Spread Mooring System 

(SMS). The definition is important, because depending on the mooring system the oil 

export operations are performed with different types of tankers, as it will be explained 

in section 1.2, and this study concerns FPSOs moored with Spread Mooring System 

only. 

The first type of mooring, the SPM, consists in an assembly of bearings and 

swivels, that is integrated into a vessel’s hull (internally, as shown in Figure 1-2, or 

externally, as shown in Figure 1-3) and permanently fixed to the seabed by means of 

a mooring system or a fixed structure. The bearing system allows the vessel to 

weathervane, i.e., rotate around the fixed part. The risers that bring the oil up from 

the well to the FPSO are connected to the swivels. They can be seen in Figure 1-2 

as yellow lines (white lines are mooring lines, yellow lines are risers or injection lines 

and black lines are umbilicals).

Figure 1-3: Single Point Mooring – external arrangement 

 
S o u rc e : (P e tró le o  e  C o n s tru ç ã o  N a v a l, 2 0 1 5 ) 

 

The second type of mooring, SMS, consists in a multi-point system that moor 

vessels to the seabed using multiple mooring lines. They are usually composed by 

four clusters of mooring lines tied to each corner of FPSO and to the seabed as 



 22 

shown in Figure 1-4. This system, in the other hand, does not allow the FPSO to 

weathervane, i.e., its heading is permanently fixed, and in this configuration, the 

risers are connected to the FPSO through the riser balcony, which is located at 

portside, on the side of the hull. 

 
Figure 1-4: Spread Mooring System (SMS) 

 
Source: (2b1 Consulting, 2016) 

 

Although the SMS presents the disadvantage of needing more mooring lines 

than the SPM (because the fixed heading implies greater mooring tensions to hold 

the FPSO in place), the SMS presents other advantages that made it largely 

preferred by PETROBRAS to every new FPSO. 

Firstly, it demands less maintenance than the SPM, because the mooring lines 

only need to be re-tensioned from time to time, while bearings of the SPM need very 

careful lubrication. Any failure on this process might cause major damages to the 

bearings and it may cause clamping, which means losing the ability to weathervane. 

If major repairs on that system are needed, as for example, replacement of the 

bearings, this might mean the need of bringing the FPSO back to a shipyard to fix it. 

This would generate a millionaire loss for the operator and it is an alternative that is 

completely off the table.  

Second important advantage that made the SMS be the most used mooring 

system in PETROBRAS is that the riser balcony allows the connection of more risers, 

injection lines and umbilicals. A normal SPM accommodates about 30 slots for lines 

connection and the biggest one in the world accommodates 75 slots. A normal riser 

balcony, on the other hand, can accommodate around 100 slots. Hence, the 

production capacity on a SMS FPSO may be higher than a SPM one. For this 

reason, today, in PETROBRAS fleet, 22 F(P)SOs are spread moored and only 11 are 

single point moored.

1.2 Oil export from FPSO units  

The oil stored in the F(P)SO must be transported to the coast by a tanker, or a 

shuttle tanker (ST), which navigates to the location of the platform and receives the 

oil through a string of flexible hoses. This operation can be performed in two ways: 

through a Catenary Anchor Leg Mooring (CALM) buoy or directly from the FPSO, 

which is known as tandem offloading. 

The CALM buoy is a floating structure anchored to the seabed and connected to 

the FPSO by submarine hoses (see Figure 1-5). Its facilities include a hawser, which 

is generally a nylon rope, to which the tanker can moor, and a string of floating hoses 

that connects to the tanker’s midship manifold through which the oil will be 

transferred. 

 
Figure 1-5: CALM buoy for offloading with conventional tankers 

 
S o u rc e : P E T R O B R A S  in te rn a l a rc h iv e s  

 

Traditionally in Brazil, the CALM buoy is used in port terminals for loading and 

unloading oil. The operation takes place in sheltered waters using conventional 

tankers.  

Although the CALM buoy is able to operate with any conventional tanker, it 

presents serious disadvantages in terms of personnel and environment safety. The 

activities of hoisting the hose and its connection to the midship manifold are manual 

tasks without any automation. During the connection, the workers are closely 



 24 

positioned to a hoisted element that presents many hazards such as fingers or arms 

clamping or even crushing to death if the crew is not properly trained. Man overboard 

is another serious hazard in the operation since it happens through the side shell of 

the hull. Figure 1-6 and Figure 1-7 below illustrate the moment of lifting the hose and 

the connection to the midship manifold in a conventional shuttle tanker. These 

pictures were actually taken during a tandem offloading in a SPM FSO, but the 

operation is very similar to that of a CALM buoy. 

 
Figure 1-6: Hose lifting in conventional shuttle tankers. 

 
S o u rc e : P E T R O B R A S  in te rn a l a rc h iv e s  

 
Figure 1-7: Hose connection to midship manifold in conventional shuttle tankers. 

 
S o u rc e : P E T R O B R A S  in te rn a l a rc h iv e s  

 

In terms of environmental risks, the midship connection does not present any 

possibility of quick disconnection between the tanker and the hose string. Hence, an 

undesired event such as hawser rupture may cause hose string rupture and 

consequent oil pollution. 

Operation with offshore CALM buoys offers, therefore, in the Brazilian context, 

even greater risks to workers and environment, as the operations would take place 



 25 

under adverse environmental conditions and using exactly the same type of vessel, 

equipment and personnel. For this reason, PETROBRAS operates four CALM buoys 

only, in port terminals, and is installing another one in Campos Basin for offloading in 

shallow water (90 m). 

The offloading in tandem is the most frequently used in F(P)SOs in Brazil. Single 

Point Mooring units have one offloading station at the stern and Spread Moored units 

have two offloading stations, one at the bow and one at the stern, where the flexible 

hoses are stored either elongated over a chute or wounded onto reels (see Figure 

1-8), the last being the most common alternative. 
 

Figure 1-8: FPSO hose string storage in chute system (left) and reel (right)  

 
S o u rc e : P E T R O B R A S  in te rn a l a rc h iv e s  (rig h t) a n d  O ffs h o re  T e c h n o lo g y  (2 0 1 6 ) (le ft)  

 

In this operation, the tanker approaches the production unit at about 80m away 

so that the platform personnel shoots a messenger line to be used to hoist the 

hawser and the hose string from the FPSO to the tanker. At this point, depending on 

the tanker used, the sequence of activities varies. 

For SPM F(P)SOs in Campos Basin, it is still common to use conventional 

tankers, because the production unit and the tanker tend to be aligned with the 

environmental conditions at all times, which reduces the risk of collisions between 

them. However, the activities of hose connection to the midship manifold of the 

tanker are the same as on the operation of a CALM buoy earlier described, and the 

risk to workers is still too high. 

For Spread Moored FPSOs, which do not align with the environmental conditions 

because of its fixed heading, the risk of operation with conventional vessels is 



 26 

considered not tolerable by PETROBRAS, because in case of a sudden change in 

the weather the tanker would not be able to keep position and there would be not 

enough time to disconnect the offloading hoses and avoid collision of both vessels. 

For this reason, SMS FPSOs operate only with Dynamically Positioned Shuttle 

Tankers (DPSTs), or simply Shuttle Tankers (ST), which are better described in 

section 1.3. 

1.3 DP shuttle tankers  

The Dynamic Positioning System (DP system or simply DPS) is a system that 

automatically controls the heading and position of a vessel by means of active 

propulsion. It consists in a complex control system composed by four subsystems: a 

set of sensors for the detection of position, course, heading and environmental 
conditions, a central control module – which processes the information received 
from sensors, estimates the environmental forces acting on the ship and calculates 

the necessary thrusts to keep it in a certain position – a propulsion system – which 
receives the central control commands and drives the thrusters to obtain the desired 

forces and returns the feedback of the actions to the controller – and finally a 

generation and distribution system - that feeds electric power to all the other 
systems. Figure 1-9 extracted from Eriksen, Harms and McDonnell (1999), illustrates 

how these systems are interrelated. 

  



 27 

Figure 1-9: General arrangement of a Dynamic Positioning System  

 
S o u rc e : (E rik s e n , H a rm s  a n d  M c D o n n e ll, 1 9 9 9 ) 

 

Among the available DP vessels on the market, there are several types of 

projects that aim at different levels of position keeping ability, reliability and 

redundancy. In general, the types of DP vessel are divided into three classes, 

according to the following criteria (ABS, 2013): 

• Class 1: the loss of position is accepted to occur in a single failure event; 
• Class 2: loss of position is not accepted to occur in the event of a single failure 

of a component or system (generators, thrusters, switchboards, control computers, 

sensors, remotely controlled valves, etc.), excluding the loss of one or more 

compartments; 

• Class 3: loss of position is not accepted to occur in the event of a single failure 
of a component or system (generators, thrusters, switchboards, control computer, 

sensors, controlled valves remotely, etc.), including the loss of a whole compartment 

by fire or flooding. 

ABS Guide also provides Enhanced Class Notation (EHS) for DP-2 and DP-3 

vessels. This notation provides the basis for the measurement of the enhancement of 

critical components of the DP system, including power and thruster system, control 

system and fire &amp;amp; flood protection system. Although EHS notation is not available for 

DP-1, some shuttle tankers in PETROBRAS fleet are considered to be DP-1 

Enhanced, because they present improvements on their power or thruster system.  



 28 

The DP system was developed in the 60s for offshore drilling activities. The first 

trials with shuttle tankers took place in the North Sea in 1982 (Helgøy, 2003). The DP 

shuttle tankers reduce the risk of collision with the production units, since they can 

counteract the environmental loads.  

Nevertheless, they are designed with the Bow Loading System (BLS), shown in 

Figure 1-10  below, which allows automated connection of the hose string to the 

ship’s bow manifold and contributes greatly to enhancing personal safety, since it 

eliminates the direct contact of workers with the hose string. A quick release feature 

is also available in the BLS, avoiding environmental pollution in case of undesired 

events. 
 

Figure 1-10: BLS connection in DP Shuttle Tankers 

 
S o u rc e : P E T R O B R A S  in te rn a l a rc h iv e s  

 

Because of these safety advantages, PETROBRAS has adopted since 2002 the 

exclusive use of DPSTs to carry out offloading operations in SMS F(P)SOs. The first 

to enter the fleet were Cartola and Ataulfo shuttle tankers. Today the fleet consists of 

28 vessels, among which eight are DP Class 1, two are DP Class 1 Enhanced, and 

seventeen are DP Class 2. 

Although there are no official records of all incidents and accidents involving 

conventional tankers and shuttle tankers for comparison, operational experience 

shows that DPST incidents and accidents are less frequent. From 2002 to date there 

has been only one collision recorded in Brazil of Cartola DP-1 shuttle tanker with 



 29 

FPSO Marlim Sul in 2012, while at least three collisions between FPSO and 

conventional tankers took place in the history of offloading operations in Brazil. 

1.4 Offloading with DP shuttle tankers 

The offloading operation consists of five steps: Approach, Connection/Mooring, 

Offloading, Disconnection/Unmooring and Departure. 

The shuttle tanker navigates until the location with its main propeller and rudder. 

The Captain turns the DP system on when the ST is about 1,500m away from the 

FPSO. The approximation is aided by the DP system, which actuates on the 

thrusters to progressively decrease the shuttle’s speed from around 3 knots to the 

complete stop. The tanker always approaches in the opposite direction of the 

resulting environmental forces to minimize risk of collision in case of blackout.  

When the tanker is about 80m away, the messenger line is passed from the 

platform to the tanker with the help of an air pistol. The ST reaps the messenger line 

of the hawser and hose string and performs the mooring/connection to both the chain 

stopper and the BLS, respectively. The whole connection phase lasts around 6 hours 

in total.  

After connection, the ST positions itself from 120 to 155m away from the FPSO 

to continue the operation. First, a leak test takes place on the hose string and then 

water is pumped from the FPSO to the ST’s slop tank. Finally, the oil starts pumping 

from the FPSO to the ST’s cargo tanks. 

After the loading is complete, about 24 hours later, the ship's slop water is 

pumped back to the FPSO to flush the oil off the hose string, and the ship's crew 

starts to disconnect the hoses and the hawser. Once disconnected, the ship departs 

using the main engine only. 

In order to increase the safety of these operations, PETROBRAS has established 

procedures that limit the operating sector of DPSTs, bordering a green area where 

the vessel is allowed to be positioned in during all stages of offloading. 

Figure 1-11 shows the current operating sector for offloading operations in 

Spread Moored FPSOs. It can be noted that the limit angles are not symmetrical: the 

green limit is 45° to portside and 60° to starboard, or simply -45°/+60°. The sector is 

more restricted at portside because this is the riser balcony side, where all the risers 



 30 

are connected. At this side, the risers come out of the water and are exposed to the 

surface. Any collision on there would be catastrophic.  

The operating sectors are defined as follows: 

• GREEN SECTOR: the sector within which the shuttle tanker is allowed to 
stay during the whole offloading operation. 

• YELLOW SECTOR: the sector within which the ship is allowed to stay as 
long as necessary for the Captain to try to put the ship back into the Green 

Zone using the available resources. If the ST reaches 85° to starboard or 

60° to port, the Captain contacts the FPSO OIM, requesting the immediate 

interruption of the offloading operation (OESD I). The shuttle crew must 

stay alert to perform emergency disconnection of the hose and mooring 

system (OESD II - Offloading Emergency ShutDown level 2) if necessary. 

• RED SECTOR: the sector within which the shuttle tanker is not allowed to 
stay under any circumstances. If the ship reaches 90° to starboard or 70° 

to port, the Captain should immediately execute the emergency 

disconnection of the hose line and mooring system (OESD II).

1.5 Objectives 

The objective of this work is to develop and apply a meticulous but sufficient 

methodology to validate a modification of a specification in offloading operations. 

The modification under consideration is the proposal of extending the offloading 

green sector described in section 1.4 from -45°/+60° to -45°/+90°. The main 

motivation for this is that extending the green sector may increase the operation’s 

availability, or uptime, which may represent financial economy for the platform’s 

operator, as it will be explained in section 1.6. 

The extension of the offloading sector was originally proposed by Corrêa (2012), 

who demonstrated through a series of static analyses that this would result in 

significant availability gains in offloading operations. Corrêa studied two proposals of 

extended green sectors: -45°/+90° and -45°/+120° – always maintaining -45° at 

portside not to increase safety risks on the riser balcony side. His results show that 

uptime gain would be significant in both proposals: around 10% and 15%, 

respectively. However, he preferred not to consider -45°/+120° as a feasible proposal 

because the equipment installed at the FPSO offloading stations (hawser chain 

stopper and hoses’ reel) have physical limitations that may be surpassed if the DPST 

is allowed to reach +120°. Figure 1-12 is extracted from his study and shows his final 

green sector proposal, -45°/+90°, which will be evaluated in this study. 

  



 32 

Figure 1-12: Extended operating sector proposed by Corrêa (2012) 

 
S o u rc e : (C o rrê a , 2 0 1 2 )  

 

This proposal, however, still needed to be evaluated through a specific 

preliminary risk analysis, real time simulations and field tests, and the availability 

calculations still needed to be improved to consider an operating window of 36 hours, 

which is necessary to accomplish the offloading operation.  

 That is why the present work developed and applied the methodology further 

explained in section 1.7, in order to validate Corrêa’s operating sector proposal.  

1.6 Justification 

Although PETROBRAS has operated with this sector for many years, Santos 

Basin offloading operations, which are becoming more and more frequent, are very 

challenging.  

As it will be shown in section 5.1.2, Santos Basin’s environmental conditions are 

more severe than Campos Basin’s and their mean resultant load tends to push the 

shuttle tanker to the West, especially when strong currents come from the East. 

Figure 1-13 below shows the difference between annual mean environmental loads 

in Campos and Santos Basins. The resultant forces were calculated from hindcast 

data available for each basin (for more information on hindcast data, see sections 2.5 



 33 

and 5.1.2). It can be seen that mean environmental loads in Campos Basin tend to 

push the shuttle tanker to South-West, while in Santos Basins they tend to push the 

DPST to the West, i.e., pushing it out of the green sector1.  

 
 

Figure 1-13: Campos and Santos Basins mean resultant environmental loads

1 It is important to notice that the FPSO heading on the location is chosen to optimize its mooring 
system, i.e., to position the vessel in the most favorable heading to handle the incidence of extreme 
conditions. In Campos and Santos Basins, extreme conditions generally come from South-West, so 
the FPSOs are headed in a way that unfortunately does not optimize offloading operations. 



 34 

Consequently, on the last years PETROBRAS has experienced several 

offloadings being aborted because the DPST could not keep position inside the 

green sector.  

Extending the operating sector is thus crucial to the efficiency of offloading 

operations on the years to come.  Corrêa (2012) was already aware of this issue and 

showed that increasing the operational sector to -45°/+90° could bring gains of 

around 10% to 15% in the availability of each offloading station. This would be 

equivalent to 36 days more to operate in a year. 

The greater the availability of operations, the lower the risk of interrupting the oil 

production due to "top". A top happens when the platform has to stop the production 

plant due to lack of storage space in the cargo tanks. This scenario may occur when 

the offloading cannot be carried out because of bad weather conditions – that hinder 

the position keeping of the DPST – or because of operational difficulties – DPS 

degradation or problems with the offloading station equipment. 

Stopping a plant that processes about 100,000 barrels of oil per day generates 

millionaire losses to the operator and should be avoided to the maximum. 

Even if there is no risk of top in a platform, the delay in offloading operations 

generates extra costs of demurrage of the shuttle tanker. The daily rate of these DP 

tankers is about U$55,000. For this reason, any demurrage in the operation is quite 

costly to the oil company. 

Corrêa (2012) presents the statistics of emergency disconnections that occurred 

in offloading operations in Spread Moored terminals, in both in Santos and Campos 

basins between 2008 and 2011. In total, 33 disconnections took place, of which 13 

(about 40%) were motivated by position keeping difficulties by the DPST – which can 

be either due to vessel degradation or due to environmental conditions pushing the 

ship out of the operating sector. The other disconnections have been caused by 

other factors, as shown in Figure 1-14.

According to PETROBRAS Business Plan (PETROBRAS, 2015a), by 2020, 22 

more FPSO units will be installed in Santos Basin to develop the pre-salt fields. In 

this scenario, the increased availability of the offloading operation can bring 

economic benefits to the company, reducing the risk of interrupting the production 

units and of demurrage of shuttle tankers. 

Nevertheless, Corrêa (2012) points out that the extension of operating sector 

could increase operational safety, because it allows the ST to better align with 

environmental conditions, reducing the power demand on the thrusters and hence 

the risk of black-out. This work will show in section 6 that this hypothesis is actually 

true. 

1.7 Methodology 

The methodology used in this study consists in five different steps. First, a 

Preliminary Risk Analysis is performed by a group of specialists to assess the 

potential hazards associated with the operation on the new extended sector. The 

main purpose is to better understand what can go wrong during the operation at big 



 36 

relative headings and what the consequences are. Drive-off and blackout failures 

followed by collision with the F(P)SO are the main focus of this work. This step is 

described in section 4. 

Second, a downtime analysis is carried out to evaluate the advantages of the 

extended sector in terms of availability gain. This is accomplished by performing 

several static analyses to determine the ship’s station keeping capability under the 

environmental conditions from Campos and Santos basins as further explained in 

section 5. This analysis differs from Corrêa’s because it takes into account an 

operating window of 36 hours, which is a more conservative approach, and it uses 

different hindcast data from other locations.  

The third step is a power demand analysis, whose main objective is to evaluate 

the advantages of the extended sector in terms of power demand reduction. As 

previously mentioned in section 1.6, by operating in the extended sector, the shuttle 

tanker can better align with environmental conditions which would decrease the 

power demand on the thrusters and hence the fuel consumption and the risk of 

blackout. This analysis results in a comparison between the optimized power 

demand on the DP system when the vessel operates in original and extended 

sectors through histograms, which are shown in section 6. 

The fourth step, detailed in section 7, consists in a series of real time simulations 

followed by experienced DPST Captains so they can evaluate in practice the 

extended operating sector and manifest their opinion about the safety of the 

operations under the new proposed conditions. 

Finally, the fifth step, detailed in section 8, consists in performing field tests to 

evaluate the software update that needs to be installed on the shuttle tanker and to 

assess the Captain’s impression on the safety of the operation, this time in real life. 

1.8 Text Organization 

This report first provides in section 2 a literature review to show what has been 

studied about offloading operations that is important to the methodology explained in 

section 1.7. This involves operating sectors, risk analysis, numerical simulations, 

downtime analysis and the use of hindcast data. 

 Then, in section 3, the theoretical concepts, which were used to accomplish the 

whole methodology, are detailed. Those concern the methodologies for calculating 



 37 

environmental loads (from wind, waves and current) over the shuttle tanker’s hull, for 

thrust allocation – both used in the Downtime Analysis step – and the theory behind 

Preliminary Risk Assessment, which is used in the fourth step. 

Next, it presents in detail each of the methodology’s steps that were performed, 

as follows: Preliminary Risk Analysis (PRA) in section 4, Offloading Downtime 

Analysis in section 5, DP System Power Demand Analysis in section 6, Real Time 

Simulations in section 7 and Field Tests in section 8. For each activity, the specific 

methodology and results are described. 

Section 9 finally brings the conclusions that summarize the results that support

2 LITERATURE REVIEW AND BACKGROUND 

Offloading systems and operations are widely studied in the industrial and 

academic community. Issues such as risk, collision, structural damage are the most 

frequent, as seen below. 

It should be noted that in the North Sea – a very well studied location in the 

literature – most FPSOs are single point-moored and align with the environmental 

conditions all the time (some even have stern thrusters to change their heading). In 

addition, the DPSTs operate at distances between 80 and 100 meters from the 

FPSO, and, in general, the DP system is operated in Taut Hawser mode – when 

distance from FPSO is “manually” ensured by the Captain, using the main propeller 

with a small thrust astern and keeping the hawser tension up to 20 ton –, as reported 

by Chen and Moan (2004) and Vinnem, Utne and Schjølberg (2015).  

In Brazil, on the other hand, most FPSOs are Spread Moored, the operating 

distance of the DPST is 150m and the DP operating mode is called Normal Mode –  

in which the DPS operates automatically with a fixed set point, which is the shuttle’s 

midship section, and in weathervane mode, i.e., the shuttle aligns automatically with 

the resultant of environmental conditions and the midship section is a fixed reference 

point that is kept at the same GPS coordinates all the time.  

Therefore, it is interesting to analyze the aforementioned bibliographies with 

some caution when interpreting their issues and recommendations. 

2.1 Offloading operating sectors 

The first reference that mentions operating sectors is the UKOOA Tandem 

Loading Guidelines (UKOOA, 2002), which brings the operating limits shown in 

Figure 2-1. These limits are less severe than PETROBRAS’ when it comes to 

distance from the FPSO, as they allow the shuttle to be as close as 60 m from the 

platform during operation. On the other hand, it is more restrictive when it comes to 

the position of the shuttle’s bow, which is limited to +/- 25°.

Diederichsen and Olsen (2012) present the qualification of a new DP offloading 

vessel, designed to dock onto conventional tankers and keep them on safe position 

during the offloading operation. This vessel is designed to operate in a called banana 

sector, which goes from -60° on portside and +75° on starboard (see Figure 2-2) 300 

meters away from the spread moored FPSO. This proposal was validated and 

considered safe enough with the aid of real time simulations. In this case, the green 

sector is larger than PETROBRAS’, but the same logic applies here: since the DP 

vessel is 300m away from the FPSO, it seems fair to operate in a bigger sector.

Voogt and Brugts (2010) discusses about numerical simulations using a 

computational tool called "Shuttle" to evaluate offloading from a spread moored LNG 

terminal. At a certain point, its shows an image of a numerical simulation taking into 

account an operating sector, but never gives the parameters of this sector. However, 

by analyzing Figure 2-3 and the grid of the drawing it is possible to assume that the 

green sector is +/- 45° and yellow sector is +/- 60°.

A typical Field Layout with offloading from a spread moored FPSO is shown in below figure. 
When not in use the DP vessel can either be parked onto the FPSO or kept floating away from the FPSO.

Once the DP vessel is connected to the tanker, the DP vessel supports the tanker approach and maneuvering operations as 
well as the station keeping of the tanker during the entire offloading operation (typically 24 hours). The DP vessel’s onboard 
crew comprises of three people: Two DP operators and one marine engineer. The DP operators have visual contact with all 
critical areas of the operation at any given time, providing additional safety to the technically fully redundant system.

Simulation Results 
Simulations were carried out in different west of Africa environments with waves, wind and current. Different wave 

periods were included to study the sensitivity and dynamic wind and current conditions are included. Particular attention is 
paid to rip currents and squall conditions, in which the current or wind changes rapidly in velocity and or direction under the 
influence of throughs moving through the area. 

Motions of both vessels, relative motions between the vessels and the resulting hawser or line loads are studied to 
determine the uptime. The simulation model also outputs the wind, wave and current forces and the forces applied by the tugs 
and anchor system. The topview plots shown in Figure 10 allow quick assessment of the behavior and comparison with the 
specified safe offloading sectors.

Comparison with model tests  

For model testing, a 135,000 m3 storage capacity transport vessel is considered whose main particulars are listed in Table 
1. The natural roll period of the loaded vessel at 11.0 m draft is 15.5 seconds. The roll period of the transport vessel is slightly 
longer than the roll period of the offshore terminal of 14s.The transport vessel is moored alongside the terminal with 20 lines 
and 4 large fenders. Eight spring lines are centered around midship and run from fairleads 30m from midships on the terminal 
to 60m from midship on the transport vessel. The calm water pretension in the lines equals 150kN. The 20 line mooring 
arrangement consists of 6 aft breast lines near the stern, 4 aft spring lines, 4 fore spring lines, 6 fore breast lines near the bow 
lines. To reduce the stiffness of the lines, the lines continue towards bollards further on the deck and a 25m nylon tail is 
included in each line. The vessels are separated by four pneumatic fenders with an unloaded diameter of 4.5m. The 
pretension in the lines loads the fenders with 375kN each, resulting in a compression of 0.5m and a gap distance between the 
ships of 4m. The mooring lines and fenders are combined to increase the accuracy of the tests and the equivalent 
configuration and setup is shown in Figure 11.

the information about the sector aperture angles, it is possible to see that the 

distance from the FPSO is 250m, that the DPST may assume a wide range of 

headings and that the ship always aims a pivot point which is not the FPSO’s 

offloading station – reducing, thus, the risk of collision in case of drive-off. The blue 

zone is the messenger line pick-up point.

2.2 Offloading risk analysis 

Risk analysis is an important activity for managing the health and safety of any 

business. They are commonly used to assess the possible hazards of the operations 

and decide whether the operator is implementing reasonable measures to prevent 

those hazards from becoming accidents.  

Different techniques may be used for assessing and analyzing risks, but they are 

usually classified into two categories: qualitative risk analysis and quantitative risk 

analysis. The last alternative is usually applied when the main target is to quantify the 

probabilities of occurrence of a certain hazard and its consequences, when that 

information is important for decision-making. When it comes to offloading operations,

LERSTAD [13]. Ilustração extraída de LERSTAD [13]. 

 

A definição deste setor operacional teve como premissa a não utilização do cabo 

de amarração ‘hawser’, uma vez que havia o direcionador das companhias operadoras 

no Mar do Norte de simplificação das operações. Para ainda se reduzir a exposição ao 

risco de colisão direta foi também tida como diretriz uma maior distância entre a 

unidade de produção e a embarcação de alívio durante as operações. Com o mesmo 

objetivo, a lógica inserida à estratégia de posicionamento do SPD considera ainda dois 

pontos de pivotamento para que em nenhum instante o NADP tenha seu eixo 

longitudinal alinhado com o FPSO. Finalmente, desenhou-se então um setor operacional 

em que o NADP poderia aproar-se mesmo de forma paralela à unidade de produção o 



 42 

a quantitative risk analysis targets at, for example, calculating the expected 

probability of collisions between shuttle tanker and FPSO as Chen and Moan (2004) 

did. They developed a probabilistic model based on historical statistics of collisions 

caused by drive-off events and on the modelling of probability of failure of recovery 

actions to avoid collision after drive-off has initiated. 

Rodriguez (2012) has performed extensive studies on quantitative risk analysis in 

offloading operations introducing a method called dynamic probabilistic analysis, 

which considers that probabilities of failure may change over time with the come-out 

of new events. The method applies Bayesian and Markovian analysis to calculate the 

probabilities of different failure events. Other references on that subject include 

Rodriguez and Souza (2011a and 2011b). 

Qualitative analysis, which is used in this study, is the best choice when the 

objective is to evaluate and rank the risks of the operation into “tolerable”, “moderate” 

and “not tolerable” categories and to assess recommendations for risk mitigation. 

Qualitative analysis must be based, as much as possible, on professionals’ 

experience, historical incidents data and technical knowledge of the systems and 

their failure causes. Many are the authors who discuss those issues. 

Vinnem, Utne and Schjølberg (2015) and Lundborg (2014) present statistics on 

the number of collisions and near collisions that occurred between 1996 and 2013 in 

FPSOs operating for Norway and the UK in the North Sea, showing that there were 7 

collisions and 13 near collisions with DP shuttle tankers in that period. Chen and 

Moan (2004) report that among 2,000 offloading operations that were carried out by 

DP shuttle tankers between 1996 and 2000, 5 collisions took place, all of them 

caused by drive-off event, which happens when the DP system erroneously drives 

the ship out of position – backwards or forwards, the last one increasing the risk of 

collision. 

Also according to Chen, the occurrence of drive-off is associated with the intense 

response of FPSOs to environmental conditions (surge and yaw motions), which 

imposes large changes in the horizontal relative distance between the vessels. 

These situations make the DP system of the ST constantly seek the correct distance 

from the target and possibly end up driving the tanker forward and against the 

platform. This hypothesis is not actually applicable in Brazilian fields, because SMS 

FPSOs do not present large fishtailing motions while single point moored FPSOs 

operate with conventional shuttle tankers. By PETROBRAS own experience, drive-off 



 43 

occurs mostly for technical or maintenance problems such as locking of the pitch of 

the Controlled Pitch Propeller (CPP) in an unwanted position. 

Chen also estimated by time domain simulations that the Captain’s response to 

drive-off must take 53 seconds maximum to successfully avoid collision when 

operating at 80m-distance, whereas it must take 81 seconds maximum when 

operating ate 150m-distance. However, based on information about incidents, 

analysis of questionnaires given to various Captains and observation training 

simulator instructors, on average, an operator takes 60-90 seconds to react. 

MacDonald et al. (1999), Chen and Moan (2004) and Vinnem, Utne and 

Schjølberg (2015) point out that the biggest risks are related to drive-off and may 

cause extensive damage as rupture of fuel tanks, damage to living quarters, loss of 

multiple anchoring lines, flooding of the machinery room, and even multiple 

explosions in both vessels if severe collision takes place just below the flare 

structure. 

Several recommendations are made for mitigating risks, including use of fenders 

during operation (MacDonald et al., 1999), more training and better scaling of the 

crew (Williams et al., 1999) and better integration with the support base onshore 

(Easton and Falcon, 2000) - the latter being framed in the reality of drilling rigs, but 

not impossible to adapt to the case of DP vessels. 

Vinnem, Utne and Schjølberg (2015) and Mo, Muddusetti and Cargill (2011) also 

propose the implementation of decision support software on the DPST that provides 

online information such as manuals, documents, standards, lists of equipment 

interdependence and failure consequences, assisting the commander in decision-

making on the continuation or not of the offloading operation. 

Finally, Chen and Moan (2004) propose measures to increase the time to 

respond to the drive-off events: more effective systems to drive-off detection, 

improved training of the crew to ensure greater attention during operations and the 

increase in operating distance between ship and platform. 

This last recommendation makes perfect sense if we compare accident statistics 

occurred in the North Sea, where the DPST operates 80 to 100m away from the 

FPSO (Vinnem, Utne and Schjølberg, 2015), and in Brazil, where PETROBRAS 

procedures require 150m. While Vinnem, Utne and Schjølberg (2015) reports at least 

seven collisions between 1996 and 2013 in the North Sea, Brazil experienced only 

one collision event between 2002 and 2016. 



 44 

Obviously, this is a very simplified comparison. Several issues may be related to 

fewer accidents in Brazil, including shorter history in DP offloading, type of FPSO 

mooring system (SPM versus SMS), shorter number of DP-aided offloadings 

performed per year, company’s management system and other issues. However, the 

operating distance between vessels is a strong sign. 

Literatures about predicting collision damages between ships were also 

researched in order to have an idea of how critical a collision between FPSO and DP 

shuttle tanker would be during offloading. Many authors have developed several 

tools and they include simple formulae, simplified analytical methods, simplified FEM, 

and non-linear FEM simulations. 

Most part of the articles found, though, such as Sun (2015), Kitamura et al. 

(2002), Yamada and Pedersen (2007) and Gao et al. (2014), predict collision 

consequences between two ships, or between FPSO and passing ships, taking place 

at speeds ranging from 5 to 15 knots. The last authors conclude that right angle 

collision is the worst case for the struck ship. 

However, MacDonald et al. (1999) claim that collision between FPSO and DP 

shuttle tanker during offloading might take place at a maximum of 2 knots, because 

such a small distance between the vessels would not allow the DPST to accelerate 

more than that in case of a drive-off event. No other study was found about 

calculating collision consequences between FPSO and DPST during offloading, but it 

is known that the only collision experienced in PETROBRAS’ history originated 

structural damages only with no oil spills or personnel injury. 

2.3 Offloading numerical simulations 

Numerical simulations are usually applied in Naval and Marine Engineering in 

order to calculate vessels’ motions and accelerations under the influence of weather 

(current, wind and waves), other vessels 2  and mooring or Dynamic Positioning 

system. Three types of simulations are commonly used: static analyses, fast-time 

dynamic analyses and real-time dynamic analysis. 

                                            
2 Simultaneous operations with two or more vessels generally require a so-called diffraction and 
radiation analyses, because the presence of other hulls close to a certain vessel may affect the 
profiles of wave, wind and current that reach it. 



 45 

Static analyses consider that environmental loads are constant forces acting on 

the hull. Thus, they are simple, fast and do not consume many computational 

resources. Although the real environmental conditions are dynamic, i.e., they change 

over time, static analyses are widely used in the industry since they allow that a large 

number of conditions are tested in minimum time. Normally, a safety margin is put 

into place to guarantee that the results are conservative.  

When it comes to Dynamic Positioning operations, they are commonly used, for 

example, to evaluate the station-keeping capability of DP vessels. The simulations 

calculate constant environmental loads over the hull in every direction from 0 to 360° 

and evaluate if the available thrust is able to counteract those forces or not, and, 

thus, if the vessel can maintain position and heading or not. The results are usually 

presented as Capability Plots, which are polar plots that contain wind envelopes, 

where the maximum wind speed at which the vessel can maintain position and 

heading is plotted for each angle of attack. A plot example is shown in Figure 2-5.  

IMCA (2000) specifies the requirements for generating Capability Plots based on 

static analyses. In order to compensate for dynamic loads, which, as already said, 

are not represented in static analysis, IMCA recommends using a 15-20% dynamic 

margin over the available thrust to guarantee the conservativeness of the results.  

 
Figure 2-5: DP Capability Plot example  

 
S o u rc e : (V IC U S d t, 2 0 1 6 ) 

 

 



 46 

Some authors disagree with performing static analysis to determine station-

keeping capability of DP vessels, which is the case of Smogeli et al. (2013). The 

authors of this study show that performing dynamic analysis and establishing 

allowable offset and heading deviations instead might be more conservative and 

realistic than IMCA’s method and generate smaller wind envelopes. However, the 

dynamic analysis results depend on several factors, including thrusters’ response 

time and DP system control parameters, which were not detailed in their study. 

On the other hand, Tannuri, Saad and Morishita (2009) verified that the IMCA 

20% margin for static analysis is adequate for DP vessels that do not need much 

offset precision such as DP shuttle tankers. Other vessels, however, such as drilling 

units and pipe laying vessels, which need more offset and heading precision, should 

be modeled with larger margins in static analysis.  

Dynamic analyses, on the other hand, are simulations that take into account the 

fact that environmental loads are dynamic and change over time and that 

consequently, vessels’ motions also change with time. They can be performed 

through either fast-time analysis or real-time analysis. Since both are time domain 

simulations and consider non-linear effects, they are much more complex, time-

consuming and resources consuming than static analyses.  

Fast-time dynamic analysis usually requires a specific software, like Dynasim, 

and a computer with good processing capability (or a cluster, depending on how 

complex the simulation is). The parameters of the simulation are input in the software 

and the simulation is run by itself with no further interference from the user. The 

results can be shown as time domain or frequency domain graphics concerning 

vessel’s motions and accelerations, environmental loads, thruster forces or mooring 

lines’ tensions. An animation of the vessel’s movements is usually generated from 

the simulations as well. When it comes to analyzing DP operations, they are most 

commonly used, for example, when the main goal is to evaluate and test DP system 

behavior or parameters of the PID controller, as done by Peng and Spencer (2008) 

and Tannuri and Morishita (2006).  

Real time simulations are the last type of simulations that are commonly used to 

analyze DP operations. These simulations take place in full-mission facilities, with a 

realistic representation of the ship’s bridge – built with all the available equipment 

that exists in the real ship – and immerse pilots into very realistic scenarios. These 

simulators use the same algorithms as the fast-time dynamic analysis, but they 



 47 

project on the screens the animation of the operation as if it as happening in real life 

and the users are capable of interacting with the simulation and change parameters 

such as environmental condition, thruster forces and rudder direction. They can be 

used for a variety of applications, including crew training and skills improvement, 

operations planning and non-conventional operations evaluation. Currently, most of 

the medium to large size navigation companies, pilots and Captains, are already 

familiarized with this type of simulators. Some time-domain maneuvering simulators 

are presented by Ankudinov, Kaplan and Jacobsen (1993) and Fossen and Smodeli 

(2004). Other authors such as Varela and Soares (2015), Sutulo and Soares (2015), 

Tannuri, Saad and Morishita (2009) and Tannuri et. al (2014) have described 

examples of operation analyses with real time simulations.  

Sutulo and Soares (2015) have compared the results from real-time maneuver 

simulations to sea trial full-scale data and have concluded that their simulator’s 

numerical model is adequate to reality. Tannuri, Saad and Morishita (2009) have 

compared full-scale measurements of a DP offloading operation – that included 

vessel’s motions, individual thrusters’ forces, DPST and FPSO distances and 

environmental conditions – to the offloading simulation in the same conditions. The 

results also show good agreement between numerical simulations and full-scale 

measurements indicating that the computational simulator is an effective tool in the 

analysis and design of DP systems. 

Tannuri et al. (2014) describe the mathematical models of the simulator used in 

this project and presents two examples of application. A better overview of this 

simulator is presented in section 7.1. 

2.4 Offloading downtime analysis 

Many literatures discuss improvements in the availability of offloading operations, 

as they are directly related to the cost of production loss due to possibility of 

interrupting the FPSO production. 

Misund and Tveitt (1982) proposed as downtime calculation method the 

observation of several production units over time, counting how many oil transfer 

failures occurred and how long it took until the problem was resolved. Because the 

proposed method was difficult to put into practice, as the authors said themselves, 

they adhered only to cite best practices for increasing the availability of the operation, 



 48 

such as providing redundancy in systems or major equipment and performing 

periodic maintenance campaigns in key components as a hawser, hoses and oil 

swivel. 

Yamamoto et al. (2002) studied a new technology to control the dynamic 

positioning system based on neural networks and shows that with this system, which 

is installed on the FPSO to control yaw motions, the tension in the hawser may be 

well controlled even under adverse conditions. Thus, the Hs limit for offloading 

operation can be increased from 3.5m to 4.5m, increasing thus the availability of 

operation. 

Ballard and Evans (2014) discuss the planning of offshore operations, such as 

installation of subsea equipment, based on the concept of availability. The 

importance of his work to the present one is that he proposes using environmental 

conditions measures or computer modeling, like hindcast data, to predict the 

probability of success of each sub-task depending on its duration. This was similarly 

done in the present study and better described in section 5. 

Tannuri et al. (2010a) present a methodology for calculating downtime of 

offloading operations through performance of dynamic analysis. Tannuri et al. 

(2010b) make a comparative analysis of calculating downtime through static and 

dynamic analysis and conclude that the first method is more conservative than the 

second one when using a 20% margin for dynamic allowance (this margin is used to 

compensate the dynamic loads that are neglected in static analysis as mentioned in 

section 2.3). 

Finally, Corrêa et al. (2013) use the static analysis methodology for calculating 

the downtime of offloading operations, and the present work is based on the same 

approach proposed by them but with a more conservative approach, which is taking 

into account an operating window of 36h as it will be explained in section 5.2. 

2.5 Environmental hindcast data 

The downtime calculation was performed based on hindcast data from Campos 

and Santos basins. Hindcast data consist in a database of wave and swell significant 

heights and periods, wind and current speeds, all of them associated with their 

incidence direction. These data are generated using numerical models that provide 

accurate, localized long-term data of ocean and atmospheric conditions. 



 49 

Several literatures such as Akpinar and Kömürcü (2013), Boudière et al. (2013), 

Chawla, Spindler and Tolman (2013), Durrant, Greenslade and Simmonds (2009) 

and Suursaar, Kullas and APS (2012) discuss the use, accuracy and validation of 

hindcast data. In general hindcast data are very reliable, have been validated through 

comparison with satellite altimeters and in-situ buoy measurements and have been 

used for different purposes, such as offshore structures design, marine energy 

converters, wave farms design and even for marine biology studies.   

The wave and wind data for this study come from the results of BOMOSHU JIP 

(Oceanweather, 2016) and current data come from the HYCOM consortium 

(HYCOM, 2016). All data were also validated through comparison with satellite 

measures and oceanic buoys. The data comprehend the period of 1st of January 

2004 and 31st of December 2009 because HYCOM data were available from 2004 on 

and the JIP finished in 2009. More recent data were not available, however they are 

not expected to have changed over the years. PETROBRAS oceanography 

specialists affirm that recent buoy measurements do not show increase in wind, wave 

and current intensities over the last years.

3 THEORETICAL CONCEPTS 

This section presents the theoretical concepts that were used as a basis for the 

simulations or calculations performed in this study. 

3.1 Static environmental loads over the hull  

The Offloading Downtime Analysis further discussed in section 5 is accomplished 

by means of static analyses and uses a database of discrete environmental 

conditions called hindcast data (se sections 2.5 and 5.1.2).  Static analysis is chosen 

over dynamic analysis because it is more time saving in terms of computational 

resources. 

Static analysis only considers average loads over the hull and despises important 

effects such as wind gusts, first order movements and slow drift forces. Hence, they 

are faster than dynamic analysis. To compensate for these simplifications, a 20% 

margin is applied over the thrusters’ maximum capability as a reserve for dynamic 

effects. This margin is usually known as “dynamic allowance” (IMCA, 2000). 

In order to perform static analyses, the first step is to calculate environmental 

loads over the hull of the DPST. Environmental loads comprehend current, wind and 

wave forces, and their calculation is described in the following sections. 

The mathematical models are the same used by Tannuri, Saad and Morishita 

(2009) and Corrêa (2012). Current and wind moments and loads are considered 

constant and are described by generic equations that require drag coefficients. Wave 

loads and moments are also constant but are calculated based on the location’s 

wave spectrum. 

As the hindcast data is a discrete database, the formulation presented on the 

following sections must be applied to each of the 17,536 environmental conditions of 

the database to calculate the resultant environmental loads and, further on, the 

station keeping ability of the DPST. 

Ships’ dynamics is classically decomposed into six degrees of freedom, as 

shown in Figure 3-1. Translational movements represented by ?1, ?2 and ?3 are 

called, respectively, surge, sway and heave. Rotational movements represented by 

?4, ?5 and ?6 are called, respectively, roll, pitch and yaw. 

 



 51 

Figure 3-1: Ship’s dynamics in six degrees of freedom 

 
S o u rc e : (C o rrê a , 2 0 1 2 )  

 

As the Dynamic Positioning System is only capable of acting on the horizontal 

plane movements (surge, sway and yaw), only these three degrees of freedom are 

modeled in the static analyses.  

3.1.1 Current moments and loads  

Current moments and loads are calculated according to OCIMF guidelines 

“Predictions of wind and current loads on VLCCs” (OCIMF, 1994). Although the 

shuttle tanker of this study is a Suezmax type, equations (3.1) to (3.3) below are also 

applicable.

3.1.3 Wave moments and loads  

Wave forces and moments can be decomposed into three categories: mean drift, 

slow drift and first order.  

First order loads are proportional to the wave heights and present high 

frequencies. The DP system is not capable of reacting to these forces, because the 



 55 

thrusters’ response time is too slow for that. Moreover, these forces do not interfere 

in the average position of the vessel in a long time observation, so they are not 

considered in static analysis. 

Slow and mean drift loads are second order loads, i.e., proportional to the square 

of the wave heights. These are the loads, which the DP system is able to 

compensate, because of their lower frequency. Slow drift loads are dynamic, so they 

are also not considered in static analysis. 

Mean drift loads are constant and impose large thrust demand in the DP system 

to compensate it. Thus, they are the only wave loads considered for static analysis 

and their calculation is shown further in this section. 

In order to calculate mean drift forces, it is important to model the location sea 

state in which the DP vessel is operating through a sea spectrum. The sea spectrum 

represents the way irregular waves’ energies are distributed in relation to their 

frequency. Following PETROBRAS procedures, bi-modal JONSWAP modeling is 

used here, whose calculation is given by Equation 3.7.

Where: 

• !!(!,!!) is the drift coefficient in the j direction (j = 1, 2 or 6); 
• !! is the wave angle of incidence (measured from the stern of the ship); 

 

Drift coefficients are influenced by the presence of current, because they modify 

the frequency of encounter of refracted and generated waves. These coefficients are, 

thus, a function of current speed and direction and are calculated with the aid of 

appropriate software for computing wave loads and motions of offshore structures 

like WAMIT using the following equation:

3.2 DP thrust allocation algorithm for static analysis 

A thrust allocation algorithm is an optimization algorithm used in the Dynamic 

Positioning System to distribute thrusters’ forces and azimuth angles to balance 

environmental forces. 

Tannuri (2002) proposes a methodology for thrust allocation based on 

minimization of the total energy required from the DPS. 

The modeling of the problem consists in calculating the forces and azimuth 

angles (if applicable) of each thruster so that the resultant force is equal but opposite 

to the environmental load. 

Be !! = (!!!,!!!,!!!)! the vector of the environmental loads, where: 
• !!! is the load in surge direction (longitudinal); 
• !!! is the load in sway direction (transverse); 
• !!! is the moment in yaw (vertical axis); 

Be !! = (!!!!! ,… ,!!!!!"#$! ,!!!!! ,… ,!!!!!"#$! ,!!!!!"#$! ,… ,!!!"#!! )!  the vector of 
thruster forces (see Figure 3-6), where: 

• ! refers to “azimuth thruster”; 
• ! refers to “fixed thruster”; 
• !! refers to force in surge direction (longitudinal); 
• !! refers to force in sway direction (transverse); 
• !!"#$ is the number of azimuth thrusters; 
• !!"#! is the total number of thrusters;

1+nazim, …,nprop 

 
S o u rc e : (T a n n u ri, 2 0 0 2 ) 

 



 58 

The relationship of !!  and !" is linear and depends on the position of each 
thruster in ship’s local coordinates !!,!",!!,!" , ! = 1,… ,!!"#! and on the orientation 
of fixed thrusters !!"!(! = 1 + !!"#!,… ,!!"#!). The relation is given by matrix A below: 

 

! = !

Where: 

• !! = cos!(!!"); 
• !! = sin!(!!"); 
• !! = ?!!.!!,!" + !!.!!,!"!!, ! = 1 + !!"#!,… ,!!"#! 

 

The thrust allocation problem consists in finding vector !’s unknown values given 
vector !! and matrix ! through the following system of equations (3.10): 

 

!.!! = !! (3.10)  
 

However, this system of equations presents 3 equations and !!"#! + !!"#$ 
unknown values, so the solution for this system has to be found through minimization 

algorithms. The minimization consists in finding the combination of thruster forces 

that require minimum total power demand from the DP system. 

It is well known that the power demand on the DP system is proportional to the 

sum of the modulus of thrust forces to the power of 3/2 (Tannuri, 2002, Rindarøy, 

2013, and Fossen, 2002). However, the power demand can be approximated by the 

sum of thrust forces to the power of 2 in order to use simpler minimization algorithms 

without implying significant errors to the result (De Wit, 2009). The function to be 

minimized, !(!), thus, is assumed to be proportional to the sum of squares of 
thruster forces following equation (3.11) below. 

 

! ! !~ !!!
!!"#!

!!!
 (3.11)  

 



 59 

In this study, the minimization of the power demand function is accomplished in 

Matlab through “Fmincon” function, which finds the minimum of a problem specified 

by the function to be minimized and the problem’s restraints given by the user. 

In the thrust allocation problem of the present work, the only restraint is to 

consider that the maximum load in each thruster must be less than 80% of maximum 

available thrust. This is done to better distribute the thrust demand among all the 

thrusters and to avoid that the minimization algorithm calculates, for example, 100% 

power of one thruster and 10% of the others. 

The present problem does not consider any forbidden zones or efficiency loss 

due to hull structures or thrusters interferences, but that is a fair simplification since 

those effects are less expected in a shuttle tanker when compared to a semi-

submersible rig. 

3.3 Preliminary risk analysis 

As part of managing the health and safety of any business, it is important to 

control the risks involved in every operation or activity. Risk analysis techniques are 

commonly used to assess the possible hazards of the operations and decide whether 

the company is implementing reasonable measures to prevent those hazards from 

becoming accidents.  

Risk analysis can be either qualitative or quantitative. The last alternative is 

usually applied when the main target is to quantify the probabilities of occurrence of a 

certain hazard and its consequences, when that information is important for decision-

making. For example, if a company wants to evaluate a certain operation and 

determine the probability of failure and the costs involved in the event of failure, 

quantitative analysis is the best choice. However, this technique is usually complex, 

time costing and might demand the use of specific software. 

Qualitative analysis, which is used in this study, is the best choice when the 

objective is to determine the severity and importance of the risks of the operation, to 

rank them and to assess recommendations for risk mitigation. 

This alternative is widely used in the oil &amp;amp; gas industry when it comes to planning 

operations and activities from the simplest ones, such as welding and painting, to the 

most complex ones such as FPSO or subsea equipment installation. Qualitative risk 

analysis is so important in this sector that the International Maritime Organization 



 60 

(IMO, 2002) proposes its own methodology called Formal Safety Assessment (FSA) 

for that. 

FSA is a structured and systematic methodology for qualitative risk analysis 

whose main goal is to help in the evaluation of new regulations for maritime safety 

and protection of the marine environment, but it can also be used as a tool for routine 

operation risk analysis. The methodology consists in accomplishing the following five 

steps: 

 

1. Identification of hazards: identify a list of hazards, their frequency, their 
severity and ranking of the risks with the help of a tolerability matrix; 

2. Risk analysis: detailed investigation of the causes and consequences of the 
more important scenarios identified in step 1; 

3. Risk control options (RCOs): propose effective and practical 
recommendations for risk mitigation; 

4. Cost benefit assessment: identify and compare benefits and costs 
associated with the implementation of each recommendation identified and 

defined in step 3; and 

5. Recommendations for decision-making: define the RCOs, which should be 
presented to the relevant decision makers. 

 

It is important to highlight at this point the following terminology defined by IMO 

that will also be used in this study: 

 

• “Hazard” is a potential to threaten human life, health, property or the 

environment; 

• “Accident” is an unintended event involving fatality, injury, ship loss or 

damage, other property loss or damage, or environmental damage.  

• “Initiating event” is the first of a sequence of events leading to a hazardous 

situation or accident. Here, it will be referred to as the “cause” of an 

accident. 

• “Accident scenario” is a sequence of events from the initiating event to 

one of the final stages, which can be interpreted as the specific 

combination of a certain hazard, the events that trigger the accident (i.e., 

the causes), and their corresponding consequences. If an accident may 



 61 

present different causes, each of them might generate a different accident 

scenario; 

• “Consequence” is the outcome of an accident; 

• “Frequency” is the number of occurrences per unit time (e.g., per year), 

but in this study it represents the qualitative probability of occurrence of an 

accident scenario (for example, “frequent”, “likely”, “not likely”, “remote”); 

• “Risk” is the combination of the frequency and the severity of the 

consequence. 

 

Another common technique for qualitative risk analysis is called Preliminary Risk 

Analysis, or simply PRA. This technique is close to FSA’s methodology, except that 

steps 1 and 2 do not follow this exact order and steps 4 and 5 are not necessarily 

accomplished. PETROBRAS has established an internal regulation for performing 

PRA and other qualitative techniques, which is N-2782 – Applicable Techniques for 

Industrial Risk Analysis (PETROBRAS, 2015b) – that can be found in ANNEX A.  

Figure 3-7 below is extracted from N-2782 and shows the PRA methodology 

flowchart. The frequency, severity and risk evaluation follows the Risk Tolerability 

Matrix shown in Figure 3-8.

A group of specialists on the subject accomplishes this methodology in a 

brainstorm session. A default spreadsheet, which is shown in Figure 3-9 below, is 

used for supporting the team.  Besides the predefined header, it contains 12 

columns, which must be filled as described below.

The PRA methodology is the most used in PETROBRAS, and offloading 

operations are commonly evaluated through this technique. When the operations 

take place in normal conditions, i.e., following offloading guidelines, they are already 

covered by a generalist analysis that is applicable to all the FPSOs and DPSTs in 

Brazil.  



 66 

However, if one parameter is changed – like the operating sector angles, a 

simultaneous operation with a rig, harsh environments, DPST degradation and others 

– a specific risk analysis must be carried out. That is why the Preliminary Risk 

Analysis is important to be done in order to validate the new operating sector. The 

results of this analysis are described in section 4. 

 

 

  



 67 

4 PRELIMINARY RISK ANALYSIS 

Preliminary risk assessment was the first task to be done in this study because it 

was important to analyze the expansion of the operating sector among other 

PETROBRAS specialists before investing in other time and cost consuming activities.  

As explained in section 3.3, offloading operations in normal conditions are 

already covered by a generalist risk analysis that is applicable to all the FPSOs and 

DPSTs in Brazil. However, when one parameter is changed – like the operating 

sector angles in this case – a specific risk analysis must be carried out. 

Corrêa (2012) presents Preliminary Risk Analyses for offloading operations 

comparing the use of conventional and DP shuttle tankers. The conclusion is that 

conventional STs present a greater number of non-tolerable risks than DPSTs. 

However, his study is focused in normal offloading operations and does not discuss 

the additional risks associated with operating in the extended sector. Hence, the 

main goal of the PRA presented in this section is to analyze these additional risks.  

The following sections explain the methodology used, the participating team, the 

premises taken and finally the results, which were summarized from the technical 

report that was issued at the time (DNV, 2014).  

4.1 Methodology 

As mentioned in section 3.3, the Preliminary Risk Analysis followed 

recommendations of PETROBRAS norm N-2782, Applicable Techniques for 

Industrial Risk Analysis. 

The first step was to identify the different phases of the offloading operations – 

approach, connection, offloading, disconnection and departure – and to assess all 

the operating procedures for them. Then, for each phase, the group of specialists 

assessed a list of hazards, and, for each hazard, its causes, safeguards, existing 

means of detection and the possible consequences. The consequences’ severity 

were classified following the most serious effect that an accident scenario presents, 

e.g., if a collision implied light injuries to people (category II following the risk matrix) 

and catastrophic oil spill (category V), the scenario severity was classified in category 

V – catastrophic.  



 68 

The ensemble formed by phase, hazard, its causes and its consequences 

constitutes an accident scenario. Thus, the same hazard, e.g. DPST drive-off, can 

unfold in more than one accident scenario, e.g., collision caused by drive-off, collision 

caused by blackout, collision caused by human error. For each accident scenario, the 

frequency of occurrence and severity of its consequences were evaluated 

qualitatively, and   the risk was classified as Risk tolerability matrix established by N-

2782 standard is shown in Figure 3-8.  

For each scenario, whose risk was classified as “Moderate” or “Not Tolerable” 

recommendations for risk reduction were proposed and the residual risk was 

evaluated considering the implementation of these recommendations. 

The Preliminary Risk Analysis (PRA) was conducted through meetings with staff 

from PETROBRAS E&amp;amp;P division, TRANSPETRO and DNV GL, using a standard 

spreadsheet (shown in Figure 3-9) where the analysis of the hazards of the activities 

and tasks of each phase of DP offloading operation in the extended sector were 

filled. 

In the case of the offloading operation, the main hazards refer to events such as 

collision, incidents during cable or hose handling, oil leaks, man lost at sea, etc. In 

this analysis, though, only collision scenarios were analyzed because it was 

considered that other types of risk are independent of the operational sector and 

were therefore already analyzed in other risk analyzes. 

One last observation is important to highlight at this point. Considering the formal 

definition of “hazard” (see section 3.3), in the offloading scenario, a hazard would be, 

for example, the great proximity between DPST and FPSO. The concretion of this 

hazard, i.e., the accident, would be the collision of the two vessels caused by human 

error and its consequences would be oil leak from cargo tank. However, to facilitate 

the analysis and the filling of the spreadsheet, the definitions of “hazard” and 

“accident” are mixed together and the hazard in this example scenario becomes the 

collision itself, the cause is human error and the consequence is oil leak. 

4.2 Team 

The Preliminary Risk Analysis was performed by a group of offloading 

specialists: two DPST Captains, four naval engineers, two risk analysis consultants 



 69 

and a professor from University of São Paulo (USP), which gathered for two days in 

PETROBRAS office in Rio de Janeiro. 

4.3 Premises 

The main premises regarding the risk analysis study are listed below: 

• Location: Non-defined basin – the group agreed that environmental 

conditions would not interfere on the frequency and consequences of the 

hazards, since the DPST only operates within contractual limits; the 

results are valid both for Campos and Santos basins; 

• Contractual environmental limits – follow PETROBRAS offloading 

procedures (PETROBRAS, 2009); 

• Conditions for mooring, unmooring and operating follow PETROBRAS 

offloading procedures (PETROBRAS, 2009); 

• FPSO unit: typical ship-shaped FPSO whose characteristics are shown in 

Table 4-1; 

• DPST: Cartola, DP 1 Enhanced, whose characteristics are shown in Table 

4-2; 

• No tug is used to aid the operation; 

• Emergency shut-down conditions follow PETROBRAS offloading 

procedures (PETROBRAS, 2009); 

• Offloading operating sector: the group evaluated that extending the 

operating sector up to 90° (as proposed in Corrêa, 2012, Figure 1-12) 

wouldn’t be possible because of hawser interference with FPSO 

structures. Hence, the group proposed analyzing a different sector 

instead, shown in Figure 4-1 on page 72.  The difference is that green 

sector is extended to 75° at starboard only, and a conditional green sector 

(hatched one) is established between 75° and 80°. Within this area, the 

DP shuttle tanker is allowed to stay during the offloading operation as long 

as the environmental conditions are mild and power demand is low – 

which is considered by the team to be less than 50% of rated power.

4.4 Operating procedures 

The procedures for Approaching, Mooring, Offloading, Unmooring and Departing 

from FPSO are described in detail in PETROBRAS Offloading Guidelines 

(PETROBRAS, 2009). 

The procedures determine system checklists, verification of environmental and 

operational conditions, speed and direction of approach, hawser and hose string 

connection, hose string wash, cargo transfer, hawser and hose string disconnection 

and departure from location. 

4.5 Results for bow station 

In total, 41 accident scenarios have been identified in the operation on the bow 

station within the extended sector, using a DP 1 Enhanced shuttle tanker without 

auxiliary tug. These hazards have consequences for the safety of personnel, 

environment, facilities and for the company's image. 

In total, eleven accident scenarios were classified as not tolerable risks to the 

environment because they are a combination of a catastrophic consequence, which 



 73 

is large-scale oil leak from a FPSO cargo tank in case of collision, with a “not likely” 

probability of occurrence. These scenarios are related to human error, blackout 

events, sudden change in weather conditions and drive-off event, which is the most 

dangerous situation during offloading operations, since the DPST might collide with 

the FPSO at a higher speed if compared to a blackout scenario. Table 4-3 below 

shows the most relevant accident scenarios for the operation by the bow, and the 

recommendations to mitigate them are shown in Table 4-4. 

It is important to notice that the author disagrees with the conclusion of the group 

concerning the frequency category of the scenarios of human error, blackout and 

sudden change in weather conditions, because they should be classified as “remote” 

(B) instead of “not likely” (C). The justification for that is: (1) there is no reference in 

Petrobras’ history that human error has ever caused a collision during offloading with 

DP shuttle tankers (while drive-off events, on the contrary, have) and (2) blackout 

events and sudden change in weather conditions will probably not lead to a collision 

with enough impact energy to cause the rupture of the side shell of the FPSO.

After considering the implementation of the recommendations listed in Table 4-4 

the 11 not tolerable risks were re-classified into “Moderate” category because the 

frequency of the scenarios was reduced from C to B. 

4.6 Results for stern station 

Results for stern station are the same of bow station, except for 11 extra 

scenarios, in which the collision between shuttle tanker and FPSO causes flooding of 

the platform’s machinery room, damage to the hull girder and consequent sinking of 

the vessel. These accident scenarios were conceived from the observation of 

emergency documents of some FPSO units, where, depending on the unit’s loading 



 75 

condition, the flooding of the engine room generates shear forces and bending 

moments that exceed the design limits. However, it is important to highlight that 

these scenarios should be revised by the PRA group and re-classified into 
Moderate category. FPSO projects already consider the flooding of the machinery 
room scenario as required by MARPOL Convention (IMO, 1973); hence, it is unlikely 

that a FPSO may sink due to this scenario. Moreover, shear forces and bending 

moments’ envelopes are applicable to intact stability analyses only. After consulting 

several PETROBRAS and Bureau Veritas specialists on the subject, the author 

concluded that these scenarios present an extremely remote probability of 

occurrence.  

Table 4-5 below presents those 11 scenarios, which were classified as “not 

tolerable” by the PRA team. The recommendations for mitigating those risks are the 

same as shown in Table 4-4 for operation at the bow station and may also reduce the 

risks to Moderate category.

forces and bending moments envelopes are applicable to intact stability analyses only 
and should not be used to make any conclusions for damaged stability.

4.7 Conclusions  

The Preliminary Risk Analysis was divided into two steps to separately consider 

the bow and stern offloading stations, because the operation by the stern can result 

in more accident scenarios than the operation by the bow. The following conclusions 

are considered valid for both Campos and Santos Basins: 

• The “Not Tolerable” risks, both at the bow and stern stations, are mainly 

related to the occurrence of drive-off; 

• These not tolerable risks involve large-scale oil leak from and FPSO cargo 

tank when offloading by either bow or stern; 

• The recommendations assessed by the group of specialists were 

considered sufficient to reduce the risk of these scenarios to “Moderate”; 

• The use of a DP Class 2 shuttle tanker with adequate power can reduce 

the risk of collisions during offloading in the extended sector both at the 

bow and at the stern;  

• With the increase of the operational sector limit from 60 to 80 degrees, 

without increasing the red sector limit of 90 degrees, the yellow sector 

span was reduced from 20 degrees to 5 degrees and red sector span of 

10 degrees to 5 degrees. With these reductions, the available time for 

reaction becomes smaller. Therefore, during offloading in the extended 

sector, attention must be doubled to changing environmental conditions 

and shuttle heading; 

 

When comparing the results from the present risk analysis to the ones given by 

Corrêa (2012), it is possible to notice that the frequency of some scenarios was more 

conservative (higher) in this study than in Corrêa’s one (while here the expected 

frequencies for operating with DPSTs are “Not Likely”, Corrêa indicates “Remote” 

and “Extremely Remote”). This is because the PRA team feared that by operating in 

the extended sector, in case of drive-off event, the DPST Captain would have fewer 

options to perform an escape maneuver to avoid collision with the FPSO, if needed, 

and the chances of running into the platform would be higher. Figure 4-2 illustrates 

the escape maneuver routes to avoid collision in each operating sector. That would 

be the greater difference between operating in the extended and original sector: the 

risk of collision can be higher if no recommendations are put into place.

5 OFFLOADING DOWNTIME ANALYSIS 

This chapter describes the calculation methodology and results of the availability 

of the offloading operation in Campos and Santos basins, comparing the values to 

the original operating sector and the extended one. 

The term "availability", or “uptime”, must be understood as the percentage of time 

in which an offloading station (or both) is available for performing offloading. This 

availability is based on the operational sector and the position-keeping capacity of 

the DPST and should not be confused with the availability of offloading equipment 

(reel, HPU, pumps and cargo valves, etc.), which is defined by reliability engineering. 

This term can also be understood as the probability of success of offloading, 

which represents the chance of a shuttle tanker getting to the location and being able 

to accomplish the offloading operation during 36h (6h connection + 24h operation + 

6h-off) without interruptions.  

The opposite of "availability" – "unavailability" or “downtime” –, is the mostly used 

term in the following sections. 

5.1 Premises 

The following sections describe the premises used in this study regarding 

location, environmental conditions, vessel and operating limits. 

5.1.1 Basins 

Two FPSO´s are used as case studies in this section. The FPSO P-50 is located 

in Albacora Leste field, in Campos Basin. The FPSO Cidade de São Paulo is located 

in the Lula field (Santos Basin). Figure 5-1 shows the location of both fields. 



 79

5.1.2 Environmental conditions 

The occurrence of simultaneous environmental agents as bi-modal wave, wind 

and current were considered in this analysis.  

Hindcast data was available for both locations. The data consisted in the 

modelling of environmental conditions in the period of 6 years between 01/01/2004 

and 31/12/2009 with 3 intervals in 3h totaling 17,536 cases for each field. The long-

term computation of the environmental agents is based on numerical models 

validated/calibrated by some sparse monitoring campaigns in specific locations of 

Campos and Santos Basin as explained in section 2.5. The environmental data used 

in the present project are based on the same used for defining the official Metocean 

of Campos and Santos Basin adopted by PETROBRAS. A detailed description of the 

mathematical model adopted is presented by Andrioni et al.  (2012).

Figure 5-2 shows the frequency, direction and intensity of each environmental 

agent for the Albacora Leste field and Figure 5-3 shows the environmental data for 

Lula field. It should be noted that environmental data for wind, wave and swell show 

the direction of incidence, while the current data show the direction of propagation.

Suezmax tanker with Dynamic Positioning System Class 2, as recommended by the 

Preliminary Risk Analysis, whose characteristics are shown in Table 5-1. Thrusters' 

layout is shown in Table 5-2.

5.1.4 Operating limits 

 
Table 5-3 shows the environmental limits for oil transfer operations from SMS 

FPSO to DP shuttle tankers adopted by PETROBRAS. It may be observed that 

approach and connection/mooring phases have more restrict limits because of the 

greater proximity of the ST to the platform. Thus, these limits were adopted in the 

downtime study as the trigger for offloading interruption or non-start.

5.1.5 Operating sector 

After performing Preliminary Risk Analysis – discussed in section 4 –, Kongsberg 

specialists were consulted in order to check the possibility of implementing in the 

existing software the hatched green sector as suggested by the PRA team.  

Instead of creating the hatched green sector, Kongsberg specialists suggested 

creating a “Bow Rotation” zone in which the DP operation mode is changed from 

“Normal” to “Bow Rotation” when the shuttle tanker attaints the green sector limits (-

50°3 or +75°) and to a Heading Restriction mode when the stern of the shuttle attains 

grey sector limit (-60° or +85°) as shown in Figure 5-6 on the next page.  

Normal mode is the most commonly used DP mode in offloading operations. In 

this mode, the ship operates with a fixed reference point (center of rotation), which is 

the shuttle’s midship section, and in weathervane mode, which means that the 

shuttle automatically aligns with the resultant of environmental conditions to minimize 

thrusters’ demand. The Bow Rotation mode is also a weathervaning mode, but in 

which the fixed reference point is the bow of the shuttle, not the midship section. The 

Heading Restriction mode is a Bow Rotation mode added to a one-side-only heading 

restriction, which forbids the shuttle’s heading to surpass the grey limit on one side 

but allows the shuttle to freely weathervane between grey and green limits.  

Changing from Normal Mode to Bow Rotation mode on the green sector limit 

would be a good solution, because this would allow a significant decrease in power 

demand. Originally, when the DPST attaints the green sector limit, the Captain tries 

to hold the shuttle in position changing the DPS to Auto Position Mode – which is a 

fixed position and fixed heading mode – so that the operation is not interrupted. This 

                                            
3 This is due to technical restrictions on the software only. The fact that the sector is increased by 5° 
on portside is not a concern, since yellow and red sectors are kept the same, i.e., 60° and 70° 
respectively.  



 85 

situation usually increases the power demand on the thrusters. The inclusion of the 

Bow Rotation mode allows the shuttle to continue in weathervane mode as the bow 

continues inside the green sector, thus, reducing the power demand from the original 

alternative. 

 
Figure 5-6: Operating sector final proposition 

 
S o u rc e : ( P E T R O B R A S , 2 0 1 5 c ) 

 

 

As this alternative greatly approaches the hatched green sector proposition and 

complies with the PRA recommendation of operating in a misaligned heading so that 

the escape route is facilitated in case of drive-off, this was the final operating sector 

considered in the following calculations. 

5.2 Calculation methodology 

To calculate the offloading downtime, static analyses were used, programmed in 

MatLab software. It is based on an adaptation of computer code simulation 

TPN/Dynasim (Nishimoto, Fucatu and Masetti, 2002), (Nishimoto et al., 2003). This 

program performs a static evaluation of the available thrust on the DP system, to 

verify if the shuttle is able to counter the resulting environmental forces and keep 

DP operating mode 
from -50° to +70°:

 86 

position for each environmental condition of the hindcast data. The equations for 

calculating environmental forces over the hull are described in section 3.1. 

The application of dynamic simulations would be more complete than static 

simulations, but that would require a very high computational time due to the large 

number of environmental conditions and headings to be analyzed.  

For static analysis, the geometry of the FPSO hull is not used, since the program 

is not able to account for hulls interference. Only the relative heading between 

vessels is considered in order to check the possible positions for the shuttle within 

the extended sector. That is considered a conservative hypothesis, because in most 

cases the shadow effect reduces the forces acting on the DPST, since it is on the 

downstream position. There are some few cases, however, where the environmental 

force is amplified due to the change on current/wind flow direction by the FPSO (see 

for example Illuminati et al., 2009), but they are exceptions. Hence, for downtime 

calculation, it is expected that the shadow effect will increase the uptime that is 

calculated with the hypothesis of no-shadow effect.  

In the first step, the routine creates a three-dimensional vector of boolean values 

and verifies if the vessel has enough power to maintain position or not for all the 

17,537 environmental conditions, 71 DPST headings and 2 loading conditions 

(loaded and ballast). The routine assigns zero to the cells if the shuttle cannot 

maintain position and one if it can. 

The logical structure of this part of the routine is as follows: 

 
For each loading condition (l = 0 to 1) (Loaded and Ballast) 

For each shuttle tanker heading (h = 1 to 71) (0º to 355º with 5 deg 
increments4) 

For each environmental condition (e = 1 to 17 537 cases) 
Get static forces and momentum from wave, wind and current 
(attribute to Fenv vector) 
Perform thrust allocation of -Fenv on the vessel and check if 
it is feasible 
If not feasible, vector_feasilibity [l, h, e] = 0 
If feasible, vector_feasilibity [l, h, e] = 1 

End_for 
End_for 

End_for 
 

                                            
4 Although the DPTS will only operate inside the green sector limits, the calculation of environmental 
forces and thrust allocation is performed from 0° to 360° in order to give more flexibility to the 
availability analysis. Having the data of all the possible headings allows the user to choose a wide 
range of operating sector angles on the following step to calculate their uptime and later compare the 
results.  



 87 

Next, in possession of the feasibility vector and probabilities of occurrence of 

each environmental condition (which is 1/17,537), the routine calculates the uptime 

and downtime of the offloading operations by the bow station, by the stern, and by 

both (bow and stern) as follows: 
 
Given the heading of FPSO and operational sector limit angles 
 
For each environmental condition (e = 1 to 17 537 cases) 
 

Check if there is at least one heading inside the green sector for 
which it is possible to carry out the offloading in loaded condition by 
the bow 

If possible, check if there is at least one heading inside the 
green sector for which it is possible to carry out the offloading 
in ballast condition by the bow 

If possible, verify if the next 12 environmental conditions 
also meet the previous two criteria 

If true, increase the bow uptime by Prob[e]: 
Uptime_bow = Uptime_bow + Prob[e] 
and count_upbow[e]=1  
**this last counter helps later to calculate uptime of 
bow-stern 
 

Check if there is at least one heading inside the green sector for 
which it is possible to carry out the offloading in loaded condition by 
the stern 

If any, check if there is at least one heading inside the green 
sector for which it is possible to carry out the offloading in 
ballast condition by the Stern 

If possible, verify if the next 12 environmental conditions 
also meet the two previous criteria 

If true, increase the Stern uptime by: 
Uptime_stern = Uptime_stern + Prob[e] 
and count_upstern[e]=1 
**this last counter helps later to calculate uptime of 
bow-stern 
 
 

If count_upbow[e] = 1 OR count_upstern[e] = 1 then increase the uptime 
of the bow-stern 

Uptime_bowstern = Uptime_bowstern + Prob[e] 
 
End_for 
 

Figure 5-7 illustrates how the routine works, testing for all possible headings 
within the bow and stern sectors, if there is at least one solution for a given 
environmental condition. 
 



 88 

Figure 5-7: MatLab routine logic – evaluation of the existence of at least one solution for a 
given environmental condition 

 
S o u rc e : (C o rrê a  e t a l., 2 0 1 3 ) 

 

The acceptance criteria for an environmental condition to be accounted for as 
uptime for a particular offloading station are as follows: 

 
1. Hs is less than 3.5m (contractual limit) 
2. Wind speed is less than 40 knots (contractual limit) 
3. If environmental forces tends to push the ship towards the FPSO, this force 

must be less than 22 kN (which is equivalent to a wind of 10 knots and 1m 
Hs wave, to ensure that the shuttle is not operating at the unfavorable 
station) 

4. The thrust of the most requested propeller is less than 80% (dynamic 
allowance, explained in sections 2.3 and 3.1) 

5. Shuttle’s roll amplitude is less than 6° (to guarantee comfort on board of the 
ST, according to Captains’ experience) 

6. Operating window of 36 hours is met (6h for connection, 24 hours for 
offloading and 6h for disconnection). 

 
The above-described routine can be used to calculate the availability of the 

offloading given the heading of the FPSO and the operating sector limit angles. Thus, 
it is possible to calculate the downtime for both basins (because FPSO headings are 
different) and for both sectors – original (-45°/+60°) and extended one (-45°/+75°). 



 89 

This allows to calculate the uptime gain due to the extension of the operating sector 
and to compare the results of both basins. 

5.3 Seasonal uptime results 

Since the environmental data from Campos and Santos Basins show that 

summer and winter present very different conditions, it is important to present 

seasonal (monthly based) uptime results. 

Figure 5-8 presents the results of offloading seasonal uptime comparing the 

original sector of 60° and the extended sector of 75° for Campos Basin, and Figure 

5-9 shows the results for Santos Basin. The blue lines represent bow station, red 

lines represent stern station, yellow lines represent global system (bow and stern) 

and black line represent maximum uptime due to contractual limits. Triangles 

represent extended sector and asterisks represent original sector. 

It can be seen that extending the green sector from 60 to 75 degrees is beneficial 

for both offloading stations in every season of the year and that the global operation 

uptime approaches even more from the maximum uptime due to contractual limits.

One interesting point to be noted from the previous graphics is that, in Campos 

Basin, the bow station is more advantageous than the stern station in most months of 

the year except for the month of May. In some months of the year, it was found a 

difference of 60% more availability for bow station than for stern station. Even 

though, the stern station plays an important part for the global uptime, which remains 

very close to the contractual limits’ uptime.  

Results for Santos Basins, however, show that stern station is preferable during 

5 months of the year and that availability differences between the two stations are 

smaller than in Campos Basin.  

The following graphics, Figure 5-10 and Figure 5-11, show the actual uptime gain 

on each station and on the global system for both basins. This graphic is done by 

subtraction of the triangles lines by the asterisks lines on Figure 5-8 and Figure 5-9. 

It can be seen that for Campos Basin an annual uptime gain of 9.1% was found 

for bow station and 8.6% for stern station. The global system presents an annual 

availability gain of 3.0%. By analyzing each month individually, it is noticed that some 

months may present uptime gains of up to 19% (bow station, month of May) or as 

low as 4% (bow station, month of February).  



 91 

As for Santos Basin, the uptime gain is even more significant, around 10.6% for 

bow station, 13.2% for stern station and 4% for the global system (annual average). 

By analyzing each month individually, it is noticed that some months may present 

uptime gains of up to 18% (stern station, month of February) or as low as 2.5% (bow 

station, month of August).

5.4 Probability of disconnections during offloading 

It is important to notice that even if the 36-hour window is not met in real life, the 

shuttle may be able to start the offloading in one station and change stations if the 

weather changes. Changing stations represent an important loss of time, since the 

ST has to disconnect from one station and re-connect to the other one. However, it 

gives the operator more flexibility to offload, especially if the FPSO is close to top. 

The probability pf disconnection during offloading would be an interesting 

information to calculate, however, no specific methodology was developed in this 

study for that. Nonetheless, it is possible to assess this issue in a simplified manner. 

 Since the probability of finding a 36h window on a single station is higher for the 

extended sector than for the current sector, it is clear that the probability of not 

meeting the required window and perform a disconnection is smaller, though this 

probability is not quantified. 

Thus, it is possible to say that, by operating in the extended green sector, it is 

less likely that the DPST has to change stations to continue with the oil transfer.

6 DP SYSTEM POWER DEMAND 

This section presents the discussion about another advantage of extending the 

offloading operating sector. As previously mentioned in the Introduction, section 1.6, 

by operating in the extended sector, the shuttle tanker can better align with 

environmental conditions which would decrease the power demand on the thrusters 

and hence the risk of blackout. The comparison between the optimized power 

demand on the DP system when the vessel operates in original and extended 

sectors is shown below. 

6.1 Calculation methodology 

In order to compare the power demand on both sectors, the results from 

downtime analysis routine were used. As explained in section 5.2, the MatLab routine 

determines for all environmental conditions and all shuttle headings if it is able to 

keep position or not by calculating environmental loads over its hull and allocating 

thrust on the propellers.  

With this information, it is possible to find for each environmental window of 36h 

the optimized DP power demand to the operation. This can be done both for normal 

and extended sectors. By comparing the optimized power demand, it is possible to 

conclude if the extended sector helped the shuttle to find a more comfortable 

heading, with less power demand. 

The logic of the routine is as follows: 

 

1. For the original green sector, find every environmental window that allows 

the offloading operation to take place; 

2. For each of these windows, find the optimized DP power demand as 

follows:  

i. For every environmental condition within the 36hour-window, 

find the optimum heading inside the sector which requires the 

minimum DP power demand; 

ii. The optimized power demand for the window, i.e., the whole 

operation, will be the highest power demand found in item i. 

3. Keep the optimized power demand value on a specific vector; 



 94 

4. Do steps 1 to 3 for extended sector; 

5. Compare results through histograms. 
 

This methodology is applied for bow station, stern station and global system for 

each month of the year.  

An important point to be noted is that the environmental conditions that had 

solution in the extended sector only were not considered for the comparison of DP 

power demand. Only the conditions that had solutions in both sectors were taken into 

account, otherwise the comparison would be unfair, since the ultimate goal here is to 

understand what is the gain in terms of safety when extending the green sector. 

After calculating the optimized DP system utilization for all environmental 

windows for both sectors, several histograms were generated showing how many 

cases (environmental windows) request the following ranges of power on the DP 

System: 

• 0 to 10% 
• 10 to 20% 
• 20 to 30% 
• 30 to 50% 
• 50 to 80% (maximum utilization, discussed in 5.2) 

The histograms were generated for Campos and Santos Basins, for original and 

extended sectors, and for bow and stern stations, to facilitate comparison, each one 

showing the power demand in every month of the year. 

6.2 Results 

The next sections present the results for Campos and Santos Basins. 

6.2.1 Power demand in Campos Basin 

Figure 6-1 and Figure 6-2 below show the results for bow and stern stations 

respectively. The y-axis represents all the cases (environmental windows) where the 

DPST can operate in both sectors (previous and extended sectors). The length of the 

color bars represents the percentage of cases where the DPST presents the average 

power demand corresponding to its color. The total sum of color bars corresponds to 



 95 

100% of the cases, and the total number of cases is the same for previous and 

extended sectors.

Campos Basin (Bow) - Original Sector 



 96 

Firstly, it is possible to verify that the average utilization of the DP system is 

always lower in the bow station compared to the stern station, regardless of 

operating sector. This is due to more favorable environmental conditions to offload by 

the bow, as seen in section 5.1.2.  

Regarding the operating sector, it is clear that for the extended sector there is a 

power demand reduction at both bow and stern stations. For example, for the stern 

station in January, if the shuttle operates in the original sector the chances that the 

power demand is lower than 50% are less than 60%. However, if the shuttle operates 

in the extended sector, this chances increase to almost 80%. This indicates that the 

sector's extension could make the operation safer in terms of stress on the DP 

system and risk of blackout. 

6.2.2 Power demand in Santos Basin 

Figure 6-3 and Figure 6-4 show the results for bow and stern stations 

respectively.

As well as observed for Campos Basin, it is possible to see that the average 

utilization of the DP system is lower in the bow station than in stern station, 

regardless of operating sector. This is also due to more favorable environmental 

conditions to offload by the bow.  

Regarding the operating sector, it is possible to see that power demand reduction 

also occurs when operating within the extended sector and it is even more significant 

for the bow in Santos Basin than for Campos.

7 REAL TIME SIMULATIONS 

The last part of this study consisted in performing real time simulations with the 

participation of experienced DPST Captains so they could give their impression on 

how safe the operation in the extended sector would be in real life. The simulations 

were performed in the Maritime and Waterway Simulator, or Simulador Marítimo 

Hidroviário (SMH-USP) in Portuguese, available at the University of São Paulo inside 

the Numerical Offshore Tank Laboratory of the University of São Paulo (TPN-USP) 

facilities. 

These simulations had three main objectives. First, to assess the opinion of 

experienced Captains on the operation’s safety in a realistic simulator. Second, to 

compare DP System power demand in the original and extended sectors to confirm 

that the extended sector may allow the shuttle tanker to consume less fuel. Third and 

most importantly, to analyze if drive-off events during the operation in the extended 

sector were safely overcame by performing escape maneuvers to avoid collision with 

the FPSO. As explained in section 4.7, this was one of the main concerns of the 

group of specialists of the Preliminary Risk Analysis. 

7.1 The maneuvering simulator SMH-USP 

The SMH is a simulator for analysis and training of waterway, port and offshore 

operations, which was developed by the University of São Paulo,  

TRANSPETRO and PETROBRAS, with the technical collaboration of Brazilian Pilots 

Association (CONAPRA) in 2012. 

The software is based on the TPN (Numerical Offshore Tank) numerical code 

(Nishimoto et al., 2002), which had several modifications, in order to perform real-

time simulations. It helps in performing various maneuverings in extreme conditions, 

with different types of ship and in damaged conditions and/or command failures. 

Non-conventional operations, such as ship-to-ship berthing and maneuvering of hulls 

of future FPSO platforms (without propulsion), can also be examined beforehand 

using simulation. 

The simulator is equipped with 25 flat screen TVs giving a 360° view of the 

operation, 10 command screens, levers to control tunnel, azimuth thrusters, main 



 99 

propeller (fixed or variable pitch) and rudder, and DP system control station (in-house 

code and/or Kongsberg DP system code). See Figure 7-1. 

 
Figure 7-1: TPN-USP’s Full-Mission Simulator 

 
S o u rc e : (T P N , 2 0 1 5 )  

 

The simulator is capable of considering the following variables: 

• Calculation of movement in six degrees of freedom; 

• Hydrodynamics of the vessel in open water considering external wave and 

current; 

• Shallow water effects (bathymetric bottom) on the potential and viscous 

hydrodynamic efforts and on propulsion and maneuvering system; 

• Bank effects and interaction with other vessels; 

• Thrusters modeling (fixed or variable pitch), autopilot and dynamic 

positioning system; 

• Fenders, anchor and cables for docking and mooring simulations. 

 

As the simulations are performed, the simulator outputs are recorded in a 

particular hardware. These outputs comprehend videos, images of the vessel’s trails, 

time history graphics of vessels’ motions (heave, roll, pitch, surge, sway and yaw), 

power demand on each thruster, hydrodynamic forces and others. 

7.2 Team 

According to Tannuri et al. (2014), “the simulators are never perfect, since 

mathematical models are simplifications of reality. Therefore, they must always be 

used in conjunction with the knowledge and experience of local conditions”. Based in 

this same idea, the team that participated in the real time simulations was composed 



 100 

by two experienced DPST Captains (one of whom had participated in the PRA 

sections), four naval engineers from PETROBRAS and three simulator specialists 

from TPN (Figure 7-2 and Figure 7-3).  

Before the simulations took place, a calibration test was done a few weeks 

before, in the presence of another experienced Captain in order to adjust any items 

or parameters that he found necessary. On this day, a drive-off situation was tested. 

After discussing with the Captain about his perceptions, TPN staff provided a DARPS 

screen to the facility and programmed the code so it would be possible to easily 

change the thrusters command from the DP console to the manual levers.

7.3 Simulation Cases 

Amongst the environmental hindcast data from Campos and Santos Basins, the 

most significant conditions were chosen to be input into the simulations. These 

conditions were chosen because they represented either typical conditions from each 

basin or intense conditions that would tend to push the DPST out of the original 

green sector. 

In total, twelve simulations were performed with different shuttle tanker’s draft 

and different environmental conditions, as shown in Table 7-1. All of them included 

drive-off simulations to verify if the escape maneuvers would be successful and safe 

– which was assessed as an important concern in the Preliminary Risk Analysis 

detailed in section 4. The focus was to compare thrusters demand in original an 

extended sector and to evaluate possible drive-off escape maneuvers in the 

extended sector.

7.4 Results 

The following sections show the results of real time simulations concerning 

power demand and drive-off scenarios. The results are summarized in Table 7-2 

below. A detailed description of each of the simulated cases can be found in 

Appendix A. As the results show, most scenarios indicated that the extended sector 

is not only possible but also advantageous in terms of power demand. During the 

simulations of these scenarios, the Captains felt comfortable all the time and 

concluded that operating in this sector would be safely accomplished in real life.

7.4.1 Power demand 

The evaluation of power demand on each simulation is done through power 

histograms, which are provided by the simulator and show for how many time during 

the simulation each thruster attained the different levels of power demand. Dark red 

color represents the time a certain thruster worked between 50% and 100% of its 

nominal power, and dark blue color represents the time that this thruster was not 

used. Light blue, green and Orange colors represent, respectively, the time that a 

thruster was used at very low demand (from 0% to 12.5%), low demand (from 12.5% 

to 25%) and moderate demand (from 25% to 50%). So the more dark red areas on 

the histogram, the more that thruster was demanded at full power. The more blue 

and green colors on the histogram, the more time the thruster had low demand. 

As a summary from all the simulations, it can be said that extended sector 

generally showed to be less power demanding than original sector. This happens 

mostly for environments where wave and wind come from East and South East, or 

when strong currents come from the East (cases 1, 2, 7, 11 and 12). Figure 7-4 

below shows the power histogram of Case 2. It is possible to notice a significant 

power reduction when the DPST changes position from original sector limit to 

extended one.

Two simulations (cases 10 and 11) also showed the importance of the hatched 

green sector. In these simulations, the DPST was only able to keep position at 80o in 

relation to the FPSO. This confirms the uptime gain in extending the operating sector. 

Finally, two simulations (cases 3 and 9) did not show power consumption 

advantages for the extended sector. Instead, case 3 even showed that the extended 

sector might be disadvantageous depending on the wave height and period coming 

from the South. In this simulation, the shuttle was positioned inside the extended 

green sector, it was submitted to beam sea and presented excessive roll motions 

(see Figure 7-5). This would have hindered the operation in real life. This does not 

happen when Hs and Tp are lower but still coming from the south as it was observed 

in case 5.

The other simulation that showed no advantage of the extended sector, case 9, 

presented wave, wind and current coming from North-Northeast and the swell 

coming from Southeast. In this case, the best relative heading for the shuttle tanker 

was found to be 30 degrees in relation to the FPSO. Obviously, the fact that the 

extended sector is not always advantageous is not a surprise, because since the 

beginning it was seen as a solution for performing offloading under specific 

environmental conditions that push the shuttle out of the original green zone.

7.4.2 Drive-off escape maneuvers 

Drive-off events were simulated in the worst-case scenario, with pitch of the 

Controllable Pitch Propeller clamped at maximum forward position, which means that 

the main propeller would drive the DPST towards the FPSO at maximum thrust. The 

escape maneuvers were performed in two different ways. First and most common 

way was using the rudder and all the thrusters to apply a moment to starboard on the 

shuttle to make the curve and escape from the FPSO. Second, which is a more 

conservative approach, was using only the ruder to turn the DPST away from the 

FPSO. It is important to notice that the main propeller is fully actuated forward on 

both cases. 

The performance and success of the escape maneuver can be analyzed through 

a series of images that show the vessel’s trail through time. They give an idea of the 

DPST’s trajectory during escape maneuver and how far from the FPSO unit it went 

by. 

Most drive-off scenarios were successfully handled in the extended sector and 

there were no collisions. Case 1 and 6 were exception. In these simulations, the 

Captains performed the escape maneuver using main propeller and rudder only. The 

thrusters were not used to aid just as a conservative approach. In Case 1, a collision 

took place and in case 6, although there was no collision, the DPST came too close 

to the FPSO.  

Drive-off simulations showed that it is always recommended to perform escape 

maneuvers using all available thrusters to minimize the risk of collision. When the 

weather tends to push the shuttle away from the FPSO, however, the maneuver can 

be safely done with the main propeller and rudder only (this was possible in cases 4, 

9 and 12). Although most of the escape manoeuvers were successfully performed, 

the Captains highlighted that it is safer that the shuttle’s bow never points towards 

the offloading station as usually done so it is easier to avoid collision in case of drive-

off. 

Figure 7-7 and Figure 7-6 below show the comparison between drive-off escape 

manoeuvers performed in cases 1, 2, 3 and 4. It is possible to notice through the 

DPST trajectory that the use of thrusters to aid the escape manoeuver is safer 

because it increases the distance to the FPSO.

8 FIELD TESTS 

After completing the previous steps proposed by the methodology of this work, it 

was possible to gain confidence to test the operation with the new sectors in real life. 

The main objective of performing the field tests was to evaluate the DP software 

update on an existing shuttle tanker, to test the transition between Normal and Bow 

Rotation modes, between Bow Rotation and Heading Restriction Modes, and to have 

the Captain’s impression on the operation safety. 

For this test to be possible, it was firstly necessary to choose the location, the 

FPSO and DPST to be used and to negotiate with Kongsberg the implementation of 

the new sector on the shuttle tanker.  

The chosen location was Santos Basin, as this is the location with greater 

concern since the beginning of the study. The choice of the vessel is merely a matter 

of respecting the premises of the Risk Analysis – DP Class II, following the 

recommendations – and of choosing a shuttle that has operated several times at the 

chosen location. The chosen vessel was Brasil 2014, a Suezmax type, DP Class 2 

vessel that had already good experience in Santos Basin. Finally, the choice of the 

FPSO depended only on the DPST schedule, since no set-ups needed to be done on 

the FPSO side for this field test. 

The test was performed in August 2015 and required 72 hours in total to be 

accomplished – 36h of primary testing and 36h of offloading operation. Two experts 

from PETROBRAS and one expert from Kongsberg boarded the shuttle tanker in 

São Sebastião port to proceed to FPSO Cidade de Mangaratiba located in Santos 

Basin. The DP software update was performed during the trip to the offloading 

location and it only took half an hour to be completed5.  

The shuttle arrived at the destination on time and connected to the FPSO’s bow 

station following the normal procedures and approached the FPSO inside the 

extended sector. The offloading started and was entirely carried out under calm 

weather conditions that would have allowed the shuttle to operate even inside de 

original sector. 

At a certain point, the shuttle’s Captain was asked if he could position the vessel 

closer to the limit of the extended sector (75°) in order to force the situation were the 

                                            
5  The software update took one week of preparation onshore, and 30 min for installation onboard. 



 109 

DP software would change from Normal to Bow Rotation mode and then to Heading 

Restriction mode. As this manoeuver would not put into risk the operation, he 

promptly agreed and re-positioned the shuttle. 

As the shuttle overcame the limit of 75°, the DP software changed to Bow 

Rotation mode as expected and it was possible to see that thrusters’ power demand 

immediately dropped down. This confirmed that the Bow Rotation mode requires less 

power from the DP system when the shuttle is operating at the limits of the green 

sector, as explained in section 5.1.5. Later, the shuttle finally attained the Heading 

Restriction limit and the software promptly altered the operation mode not to allow 

the shuttle to surpass the limit of 85° shown in Figure 5-6 on page 85. 

As no adversities took place and the Captain of Brasil 2014 perceived no safety 

issues in operating inside the extended sector, the tests were considered successful 

and it was decided that it was possible to move on to the next stage, i.e., definite 

implementation of the technology on the whole fleet (PETROBRAS, 2015c). 

This stage involved official validation of the new sector inside PETROBRAS, 

modification of offloading procedures and implementation on all DP Class II shuttles 

of the fleet – which means performing set-up of every DPST shuttle with every FPSO 

in the fleet, what roughly makes 748 set-ups to be completed (17 DP Class II 

shuttle’s times 22 FPSOs times 2 offloading stations). 

The official validation of the new sector was done by the department in charge of 

offloading operations and procedures inside PETROBRAS E&amp;amp;P division after 

extensive discussions and participation of TRANSPETRO specialists.  

The new sector is already in operational in about 12 shuttle tankers in 

PETROBRAS and positive feedback has been received both by DPST Captains and 

by Kongsberg specialists. Figure 8-1 and Figure 8-2 show the images of Eagle 

Paraiba shuttle tanker operating in the extended sector and a screen capture of his 

DP console showing the operation mode set to “bow rotation”.

9 CONCLUSIONS 

The results presented in section 5 – Offloading Downtime Analysis – and in 

section 6 – DP System Power Demand – show that the extended operating sector is 

advantageous for increasing the offloading uptime, decreasing the probability of 

disconnection during the operation and decreasing the average of thrusters’ 

utilization of the DP shuttle tanker. 

The Downtime Analysis shows that for Campos Basin an annual average uptime 

gain of 9.1% is found for bow station and 8.6% for stern station. The global system 

presents an annual availability gain of 3.0%. By analyzing each month of the year 

individually, it is noticed that some months may present uptime gains of up to 19% 

(bow station, month of May) or as low as 4% (bow station, month of February). As for 

Santos Basin, the uptime gain is even more significant – around 10.6% for bow 

station, 13.2% for stern station and 4% for the global system (annual average) – and 

by analyzing each month individually, some of them present uptime gains of up to 

18% (stern station, month of February) or as low as 2.5% (bow station, month of 

August). 

It is important to highlight that availability gain is eventually translated as 

economical gains to the operator, since it reduces the probability of offloading delays 

and top events. The delay in offloading operations generates extra costs of 

demurrage of the shuttle tanker. The current daily rate of these DP shuttle tankers is 

about US$ 55,000. Moreover, a top event may cost about 5,5 million dollars a day 

(considering a 100,000 barrels production plant with the crude oil brent price at 

US$ 55).  

The Power Demand study shows that, when operating within the extended 

sector, there is a power demand reduction at bow and stern stations for both Campos 

and Santos Basin. This indicates that the sector's extension could make the 

operation safer in terms of stress on the DP system and consequent lower risk of 

blackout. 

The Preliminary Risk Assessment presented in section 4 shows that the non-

tolerable risk scenarios assessed are mainly caused by drive-off events. These 

scenarios’ consequences are mainly associated with collision between the two 

vessels, representing risks for the personnel, environment, facilities and company’s 

image. When offloading by the bow or stern within the extended sector, a collision on 



 112 

the side of the FPSO can cause large-scale oil leak of a cargo tank. When offloading 

by the stern, a collision may cause flooding of the machinery room and severe 

damage to facilities. However, the PRA group assessed several recommendations, 

which, when implemented, are considered sufficient to reduce the risk of these 

scenarios to “Moderate” category. 

The Real Time Simulations presented in section 7 complement all the other 

analysis showing that: 

 

• for some environmental conditions, where the DPST cannot keep position 

inside original sector, the extended sector allows the operation to continue 

normally, 

• for most of the simulated cases, even if the DPST is able to keep position 

inside original sector,  the extended one allows the shuttle to keep position 

in a more comfortable way, with reduced thrusters’ power demand, 

• in case of drive-off event when operating in extended sector, it is possible 

to avoid collision with the FPSO by using all the thrusters, main propeller 

and rudder to aid the escape maneuver, and 

• the experienced Captains that participated in the simulations felt 

comfortable all the time and concluded that operating in this sector would 

be safely accomplished in real life.  

 

After all the simulations were completed, a field test was carried out to evaluate 

the implementation of the new sectors in real life. As no adversities took place and 

the Captain of the tested DPST perceived no safety issues in operating inside the 

extended sector, the tests were considered successful and it was decided that it was 

possible to implement the new sector on the whole fleet.  

The final operating sector, which was validated through all the simulations and 

field-testing, is the one shown in Figure 9-1. The new sector presents a “Bow 

Rotation” zone, in which the DP operation mode is changed from “Normal” to “Bow 

Rotation” when the shuttle tanker attaints the green sector limits (-50° or +75°) and to 

a “Heading Restriction” mode when the stern of the shuttle attains grey  sector  limit 

(-60° or +85°) as  explained in section 5.1.5.

As a general and final conclusion, this study verified that the extension of the 

green operating sector can be incorporated into PETROBRAS’ offloading procedures 

without increasing any risks to the safety of people, environment, facilities and 

company’s image and represents good advantages in terms of uptime gain and 

power demand reduction. The new sector is already in operational in about 12 shuttle 

tankers in PETROBRAS and positive feedback has been received both by DPST 

Captains and by Kongsberg specialists. 

As a suggestion for future work, it is recommended to perform DP System 

reliability study together with quantitative risk analysis to determine the expected 

frequency of collision between shuttle tanker and FPSO. Along with these studies, 

Finite Element analyses can be performed to determine the exact consequences of 

collision and check if the severities of the scenarios assessed in PRA sessions are 

realistic or too conservative.  

Another suggested activity is monitoring the DPST fleet to calculate the real 

offloading downtime and the frequency of use of the extended zone to compare with 

static analysis results and validate them.

APPENDIX A – RESULTS OF REAL TIME SIMULATIONS 

This appendix presents the details of the real-time simulations described in 

section 7. 

A.1. Case 1 

The first case was a connection with the FPSO under environmental conditions 

from Santos Basin. Wave, Wind and current coming from SSE with moderate to high 

intensity (see Figure A-1).  

 
Figure A-1: Case 1 – Environmental conditions 

 
S o u rc e : (T P N , 2 0 1 5 ) 

 

 

This simulation started with a shuttle tanker heading of 6 degrees in relation to 

the FPSO. It was noticed the difficulty to keep position with this heading, so the 

shuttle was then brought to the limit of original green sector 70 degrees (60 degrees 

in relation to the FPSO). At this point, the shuttle was able to keep position, but the 

thrusters were too much demanded, which according to the Captains was not 

recommended because of equipment’s heat-up. The heading was adjusted again, 

now to the extended sector limit 80 degrees (70 degrees in relation to the FPSO) and 

it was possible to see that thrusters demand was reduced as expected. Figure A-2: 

shows the comparison of power histograms for both headings (70 and 80 degrees).

Drive-off was then simulated as if the pitch of the main propeller had locked on 

full thrust ahead position. The Captains performed the escape maneuver as if all the 

other thrusters were unavailable to aid, so only the rudder was used. The Captains 

wanted to try this way because it is possible that together with drive-off the thrusters 

will become unavailable. As it can be seen in Figure A-3, this maneuver was not 

successful because the two vessels collided.

At this point, the Captains highlighted that it is safer that the shuttle’s bow never 

points towards the offloading station as usually done so it is easier to avoid collision 

in case of drive-off, as shown in Figure A-4.

A.2. Case 2 

The second case was a connection with the FPSO under environmental 

conditions from Campos Basin, after the arrival of a cold front. The current runs to 

South and wave and wind, after turning because of the cold front, stabilize coming 

from Southeast (see Figure A-5). This is another situation favorable to the extended 

sector.  

 
Figure A-5: Case 2 – Environmental conditions 

 
S o u rc e : (T P N , 2 0 1 5 ) 

 

This simulation started with a shuttle tanker heading of 10 degrees in relation to 

the FPSO. It was noticed the difficulty to keep position with this heading, so the 

shuttle was then brought to the limit of original green sector 90 degrees (60 degrees 

in relation to the FPSO). At this point, the shuttle was able to keep position and 

power demand on the thrusters was reduced. The heading was adjusted again, now 

to the extended sector limit 100 degrees (70 degrees in relation to the FPSO) and it 

was possible to see that thrusters demand was reduced even more. Figure A-6 

shows the comparison of power histograms for both headings (90 and 100 degrees).

Drive-off was then simulated as if the pitch of the main propeller had locked on 

full thrust ahead position. The escape maneuver was performed this time considering 

all thrusters available to work together with the rudder to avoid collision. As it can be 

seen in Figure A-7, this was a successful maneuver.

A.3. Case 3 

The third case was a connection with the FPSO under environmental conditions 

from Campos Basin, also associated to the arrival of a cold front. The current runs to 

Southwest, and wave and Wind come from South-Southwest (see Figure A-8). The 

Captains observed that it would be not recommended to perform offloading in these 

conditions since the typical period of the waves is well beyond contractual limits, 

which is 9s. Too long waves may cause extreme pitch motions and hawser 

consequent whips and stress. Moreover, these conditions tend to push the shuttle 

towards the FPSO, increasing the risk of collision in case of blackout. Although it was 

a typical case were the offloading by the Stern would me much more recommended 

(regardless of the period problem), the simulation was performed anyway for 

analysis.

Figure A-8: Case 3 – Environmental conditions 

 
S o u rc e : (T P N , 2 0 1 5 ) 

 

This simulation began with a shuttle tanker heading of 27 degrees (-3 degrees in 

relation to the FPSO). It was noticed that the power demand was not very high, and 

the vessel could easily keep position although it was being pushed towards the 

FPSO. The pitch motion however was accentuated, going up to ±1,2o. Next, the 

shuttle was brought to the limit of original green sector 90 degrees (60 degrees in 

relation to the FPSO). The pitch motions were reduced to ±0,8o, but the roll increased 

from almost zero to ±5,0o. When the heading was adjusted again, now to the 

extended sector limit 105 degrees (75 degrees in relation to the FPSO), it was 

possible to see that roll response increased even more to ±7,0o, which is actually 

expected because in this situation the vessel is submitted to beam sea. Figure A-9 

shows the comparison of power histograms and motions for the three tested 

headings (27, 90 and 105 degrees). The conclusion is that for this environmental 

condition, the extended green sector brings no advantages.  

  



 130 

Figure A-9: Case 3 – Power demand and motions comparison between operation in original 
and extended sectors 

  
 

S o u rc e : (T P N , 2 0 1 5 ) 
 

Drive-off was then simulated and the escape maneuver was performed 

considering all thrusters available to work together with the rudder to avoid collision. 

The maneuver was successful, and the results can be seen on Figure A-10 on the 

next section.  

A.4. Case 4 

This case was just a repetition of the drive-off scenario of Case 3, but this time 

the escape maneuver was performed using the rudder only. As it can be seen on 

Figure A-10, the maneuver was also successful, although the shuttle went by closer 

to the FPSO than in Case 3.

This represents environmental conditions from Santos Basin, after the arrival of a

of the cold front, stabilize coming from South-Southeast (see Figure A-11). This 

situation was shown favorable to the extended sector.

This simulation began with a shuttle tanker heading of 14 degrees (4 degrees in 

relation to the FPSO). It was noticed that the power demand was not very high, and 

the vessel could easily keep position although it was being pushed towards the 

FPSO. Next, the shuttle was brought to the limit of original green sector 70 degrees 

(60 degrees in relation to the FPSO), showing that the power demand was reduced. 

When the heading was adjusted again, now to the extended sector limit 85 degrees 

(75 degrees in relation to the FPSO), it was possible to see that power demand

decreased a little more. Figure A-12 shows the comparison of power histograms for 

the three tested headings (14, 70 and 85 degrees).  

Unlike Case 3 simulations, the pitch and roll motions did not come up as a 

problem, because Hs and Tp are not as high as in case 3. In this case, roll motions 

did not go over ±1.5 degrees and pitch did not go over ±0.5.

When simulating drive-off in this case, the Captains tried a different type of 

maneuver, this time using the azimuth thrusters backwards and the tunnel thrusters 

to starboard. As they saw this was not going to work, they put the azimuth thrusters 

also to starboard and the vessel could escape safely from collision.  

A.6. Case 6 

This case was just a repetition of the drive-off scenario of Case 5, but this time 

the escape maneuver was performed using the rudder only. As it can be seen on 

Figure A-13, it was a very risky maneuver, because the shuttle came too close to the 

FPSO although they did not collide. Again the Captains highlighted the importance of 

this simulation, because not only the thrusters can become unavailable during drive-

off, but also other vessels, different from Stavanger, might have less azimuth 

thrusters and thus less escape capability.

Once more, the recommendation of never pointing the shuttle’s bow to the 

offloading station was made, and the recommendation of always using all thrusters to 

escape from collision.

The seventh case was a connection with the FPSO under environmental

current runs to South, and wave and Wind come from Southwest (see Figure A-14).

This simulation began with a shuttle tanker heading of 38 degrees (8 degrees in 

relation to the FPSO). It was noticed that the power demand was very high, and the 

roll motions as well. Next, the shuttle was brought to the limit of original green sector 

90 degrees (60 degrees in relation to the FPSO) and the roll motions as well as the 

power demand were greatly decreased. When the heading was adjusted again, now 

to the extended sector limit 105 degrees (75 degrees in relation to the FPSO), it was 

possible to see that roll response continued low as expected and that power demand 

decreased a little more. Figure A-15 shows the comparison of power histograms and 

motions for the three tested headings (38, 90 and 105 degrees). The conclusion is 

that for this environmental condition, the extended green sector brings power 

reduction advantage.

and extended sectors 

 
S o u rc e : (T P N , 2 0 1 5 ) 

 

Drive-off was then simulated and the escape maneuver was performed 

considering all thrusters available to work together with the rudder to avoid collision.

The maneuver was successful, and the results are similar to Case 3, shown in Figure 

A-10.  

A.8. Case 8 

This case was requested by the Captains to check, under the same environmental 

conditions from Case 7, what it would happen in case of a blackout event if the ship 

was on the extended sector limit. Thus, all the thrusters were disabled at some point, 

and as expected, the vessel started to distance from the FPSO, giving no risk of 

collision (see Figure A-16). 

 
Figure A-16:  Case 8 – Blackout simulation

A.9. Case 9 

This case corresponds to the arrival of a swell coming from SE associated to typical 

environmental conditions from Campos Basin (Current to S, wave and Wind from 

NE) during connection with the FPSO. See Figure A-17.

S o u rc e : (T P N , 2 0 1 5 ) 

 

This simulation began with a shuttle tanker heading of 30 degrees (0 degree in 

relation to the FPSO). It was noticed that the power demand was very high and the 

vessel was not able to keep position. Next, the shuttle was brought to 60 degrees (30 

degrees in relation to the FPSO), the power demand decreased and the shuttle 

position was stabilized. Then it was brought to the limit of original green sector, 90 

degrees (60 degrees in relation to the FPSO), and then again to the extended sector 

limit, 105 degrees (75 degrees in relation to the FPSO). It was possible to see that 

power demand increased repeatedly for both limits. Figure A-18 shows the 

comparison of power histograms for the four tested headings (30, 60, 90 and 105 

degrees). The conclusion is that for this environmental condition, the extended green 

sector brings no advantage.

Drive-off was then simulated and the escape maneuver was performed 

considering the use of the rudder only, because, according to the Captains, as the 

environmental conditions would push the ship towards starboard, i.e. far from the 

FPSO, the risk of collision would be lower and that proved to be true during the 

successful maneuver. Figure A-19 shows the screens of the simulator during drive-

off simulation.

A.10. Case 10 

This case corresponds to the approach towards the FPSO under typical Santos 

Basin conditions (Current to W, wave and Wind from SE). See Figure A-20. 

 
Figure A-20:  Case 10 – Environmental conditions 

 
S o u rc e : (T P N , 2 0 1 5 ) 

 

This simulation started with a shuttle tanker approaching with a heading of 17 

degrees (7 degrees in relation to the FPSO). It was noticed that the power demand 

was very high and the vessel was not able to keep position. The Captains were then 

forced to position the shuttle to the extended sector limit (heading 85 degrees - 75 

degrees in relation to the FPSO), because even in original limit (heading 70 degrees 

- 60 degrees in relation to the FPSO) the tanker could not keep position. Even for this 

heading, the shuttle continued to drift off and the simulation was aborted. Figure A-21 

shows the trail of the ship’s drift-off.  

  



 139 

Figure A-21:  Case 10 – Non-successful approach simulation 

 
S o u rc e : (T P N , 2 0 1 5 ) 

 

The Captains highlighted that for this environmental condition the shuttle should 

not approach with heading 17 degrees (7 degrees in relation to the FPSO) but 

already headed to the East. The problem in this simulation was that when the 

weather started drifting the ship away from initial position, it gained too much inertia 

and when he was finally positioned on the most favorable heading, it still was not 

able to keep position. Case 11 was further done to repeat the approach, now with the 

recommended heading. 

A.11. Case 11 

This case is a repetition from Case 10, but this time approaching with the 

recommended heading of 85 degrees (75 degrees in relation to the FPSO), which is 

the extended sector limit. The approach is performed with the DP system, because 

according to the Captains the distance from the FPSO already allowed that. 

Due to environmental conditions, the power demand on the thrusters was very 

high and the Captains decided to change the heading to 105 degrees (95 degrees in 

relation to the FPSO), which is on the red sector. Although this would not be 

permitted in real life, the Captains decided to do that only for analyzing the ship’s 

behavior. At this heading, the shuttle approached the FPSO safely. When it got to the 

operation distance of 150m, the heading was adjusted to 85 degrees (75 degrees in 

relation to the FPSO - extended green sector limit) but it was possible to see the

power consumption increased too much. Thus, the heading was adjusted again to 90 

degrees (80 degrees in relation to the FPSO - hatched green sector limit) and in this 

position the thrusters demand dropped into an acceptable level. Figure A-22 shows

Drive-off was then simulated and the escape maneuver was performed considering the use of 

all thrusters and rudder ( 
Figure A-23). This was necessary because the wave and wind coming from SE 

push the shuttle against the platform, increasing the risk of collision. The escape 

maneuver was successful and the shuttle went by the FPSO at a 44m distance.

A.12. Case 12 

This case corresponds to the arrival of a swell coming from SW associated to 

typical environmental conditions from Santos Basin (Current to W, wave and Wind 

from NE) during connection with the FPSO. See Figure A-24.

This simulation started with the shuttle tanker fully loaded with a heading of 60 

degrees (50 degrees in relation to the FPSO). It was noticed that the power demand 

was very high although the vessel was able to keep position. Next, the shuttle was 

brought to the limit of original green sector, 60 degrees (60 degrees in relation to the 

FPSO), and then again to the extended sector limit, 85 degrees (75 degrees in

relation to the FPSO). It was possible to see that power demand decreased 

repeatedly for both limits.  

 Figure A-25 shows the comparison of power histograms for the three tested 

headings (60, 70 and 85 degrees). The conclusion is that for this environmental 

condition, the extended green sector presents good advantage for power 

consumption.

sectors 

 
 

S o u rc e : (T P N , 2 0 1 5 )  
 

Drive-off was then simulated and the escape maneuver was performed 

considering the use of the rudder only because the conditions tend to push the 

shuttle away from FPSO. The maneuver showed to be effective to escape from 

collision.
