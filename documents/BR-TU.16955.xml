The aim of this study was to compare the effect of a 16% carbamide peroxide (CP) gel 
and a 10% CP gel on mineralized enamel content and morphology. Enamel blocks from 
bovine incisors were subjected to a 14-day treatment (8 h/day) with 10% or 16% CP gels. 
Knoop microhardness was evaluated before bleaching and at 1, 7 or 14 days after this 
treatment (50 g/15 s). Mineral content (energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy), surface 
roughness and topography (atomic force microscopy) were evaluated at the 14-day period. 
Data were analyzed statistically by two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test (?=0.05). Significant 
microhardness reduction was observed at the 7 th and 14 th days for 10% CP gel, and for all 
bleaching times for 16% CP gel (p&lt;0.05). At the 14-day period, a significant decrease in 
Ca and P content, increase on surface roughness (p&lt;0.05) as well as on picks and valleys 
distance were observed when both bleaching gels were used. These enamel alterations 
were more intense for 16% CP gel. It was concluded that both CP-based gels promoted 
loss of mineral structure from enamel, resulting in a rough and porous surface. However, 
16% CP gel caused the most intense adverse effects on enamel.

Introduction
Tooth bleaching is a popular esthetic procedure because 

of its simple technique, clinical efficacy and non-invasive 
nature, requiring no sound dental structure removal. 
However, a number of studies demonstrated that bleaching 
gels with high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (HP), 
such as those used for in-office tooth bleaching, could 
promote pulp cell damage (1). This undesirable adverse 
effect has been related to the ability of HP to disrupt the 
mineral structure of enamel (2), which allows HP diffusion 
to the subjacent dentin and pulp chamber (3). Therefore, 
at-home tooth bleaching technique has been considered 
as an interesting alternative for bleaching teeth without 
causing toxic effects to pulp tissue. This esthetic procedure 
is based on patient wearing a custom-made tray filled 
with low concentrations of carbamide peroxide (CP) or 
HP gels (4). 

Currently, several researchers are looking for tooth 
bleaching techniques that are at the same time effective 
and safe for dental tissues (1). Low-concentration HP (15-
20%) gels for in-office therapy provide effective bleaching 
associated with less intense and prevalent tooth sensitivity 
(5,6). The CP-based gels have the advantage of promoting 
a slow and gradual release of HP, which prevents its quick 

diffusion through enamel and dentin at high concentrations 
(7). The 10% CP gel has been considered a safe bleaching 
technique for tooth structure, since several studies 
demonstrated low incidence of post-operative sensitivity 
(8) and low trans-enamel and trans-dentinal cytotoxicity 
(4). A recent in vivo study also demonstrated that night-
guard vital bleaching with 10% CP gel provides patient 
satisfaction with minimal side effects up to 17 years post-
treatment (9). However, some patients complain about the 
long treatment time required for this technique.

To fulfill patient requirement of faster tooth bleaching 
outcomes, CP-based gels with concentrations varying from 
15 to 22% have been currently recommended. However, 
only a few studies evaluated the effects of these products 
on tooth structure (4,10-15). A recent investigation showed 
that 16% CP gel caused higher trans-enamel and trans-
dentinal toxic effects to pulp cells than 10% CP gel, which 
may have been favored by the more intense enamel changes 
triggered by the 16% CP gel (4). However, as the effects of 
16% CP gel on dental enamel as well as on pulp cells are 
still controversial, a rational approach is probably to carry 
out studies to clarify these topics. Therefore, the aim of this 
study was to evaluate the microhardness, mineral content, 
roughness and topography of dental enamel bleached with

16% CP gel compared with the widely used 10% CP gel.
 

Material and Methods
Preparation of Specimens 

Thirty-six dental enamel blocks measuring 8x8 mm were 
obtained from buccal surface of sound bovine permanent 
incisors. The blocks were embedded in autopolymerizing 
acrylic resin (Vipi Flash; Vipi Ltda., Pirassununga, SP, Brazil) 
and the outer enamel surface was polished with wet 320-, 
600-, 1200- and 1500-grit silicon carbide paper (T469-SF; 
Norton - Saint-Gobain Abrasivos Ltda., Jundiaí, SP, Brazil) in 
a polishing machine (Panambra DP-10; Panambra Industrial 
e Técnica S.A., São Paulo, SP, Brazil) followed by hand 
polishing with 6, 3 and 1 µm (Arotec; Arotec S.A., Cotia, SP, 
Brazil) diamond pastes intercalating ultrasonication with 
distilled water to eliminate paste residues. The specimens 
were rinsed with distilled water after the final polishing 
with 1 µm diamond paste. 

Bleaching Procedure
Bleaching gels containing 10% or 16% CP (Whiteness 

HP; FGM, Joinville, SC, Brazil) were evaluated. These gels are 
identical in composition, except for the HP content, having 
a neutral pH. The specimens were randomly assigned to the 
following 3 groups (n=12): CG - control (no bleaching); 
G10 - 10% CP bleaching gel application; G16 – 16% CP 
bleaching gel application. 

In G10 and G16, the surface of each enamel block was 
washed with 1 mL of sterile deionized water, dried with 
absorbent paper and then 30 mg of either of the bleaching 
gels was applied on enamel for 8 h at 37 °C. After this, the 
gel was aspirated, enamel surface was thoroughly rinsed 
with sterile deionized water and maintained in artificial 
saliva for 16 h at 37 °C. These procedures were repeated for 
14 consecutive days. In CG, the enamel surface remained in 
contact with deionized water during the bleaching time (8 
h) followed by storage in artificial saliva (16 h) (4).

Knoop Microhardness
Enamel microhardness was evaluated in 12 specimens 

per group using a microhardness meter with a square base 
diamond pyramid Knoop hardness indenter (Buehler, Lake 
Bluff, IL, USA). The analysis was performed before bleaching 
(baseline) and after 1, 7 and 14 days of bleaching protocol 
in each specimen. Each indentation was made with a 50 g 
static load for 15 s. Five indentations were made in each 
specimen at each evaluation period, within an area of 1.0 
mm2 on enamel surface, equidistant from each other 0.1 
mm horizontally and 0.5 mm vertically. An average of the 
5 indentations of each period was obtained. Data were 
submitted to two-way ANOVA (“group” and “period”), 
complemented by Tukey’s test for multiple comparisons 

at a significance level of 5%.

Analysis of Mineral Content by Energy-Dispersive 
X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX)

The mineral content of enamel was assessed in the same 
specimens used for microhardness analysis at the end of 
the experimental protocol. Six specimens of each group 
were examined by SEM-EDX at the 14 th day. An EDX probe 
coupled to a scanning electron microscope (Philips FEG 
XL 30; Oxford Instruments, Inc., Concord, MA, USA) at 25 
kV accelerating voltage, 100 ?A illuminating current and 
100-second counting time was used. In each specimen, 
analyses of calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) content of 
enamel (%) were carried out in three equidistant points 
distributed diagonally along the test surface and the 
average value was statistically analyzed by two-way ANOVA 
and Tukey’s test at a significance level of 5%.

Analysis of Surface Roughness and Topography by 
Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)

In the other six specimens of each group subjected 
to the microhardness test, surface roughness and surface 
topography were evaluated with an atomic force microscope 
(Alpha 300AR; Witec, Ulm, Germany) at the 14 th day for 
each group. The topography of the specimens was examined 
within an area of 70 x 70 µm2 in 3 different positions 
in each sample. All AFM measurements were conducted 
with the tip working in AC-mode (tapping mode) and the 
average values from the 3 measurements were submitted 
to statistical analysis (two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test; 
?=5%). The WSxMV 3.1 software (Nanotec Electrónica 
S.L., Tres Cantos, Madrid, Spain) transformed the obtained 
data in 3D images for subsequent analysis of the results. 
The results were three 3D images of the surface for each 
qualitatively examined specimen.

Results
Knoop Microhardness

The Knoop microhardness values for enamel according 
to CP concentration and duration of the bleaching protocol 
are presented in Table 1. 

In CG, enamel microhardness remained unaltered during 
the entire experimental period. Bleaching with 10% CP gel 
(G10) caused a significant decrease in enamel microhardness 
after 7 and 14 days of treatment compared with baseline 
(p&lt;0.05). On the other hand, no significant difference was 
observed between these two periods (p&gt;0.05). Enamel 
microhardness was significantly lower in G16 than in CG 
after all bleaching times (p&lt;0.05). Comparing the three 
bleaching times within G16, no significant difference was 
found between the 1- and 7-day times (p&gt;0.05); however, 
significantly lower microhardness values were observed 
after 14 days of bleaching treatment (p&lt;0.05).

Analysis of Mineral Content by Energy-Dispersive 
X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX)

No statistically significant difference was observed 
between G10 and G16 (p&gt;0.05; Fig. 1A). However, both 
bleached groups presented a significantly lower Ca and P 
content on enamel compared with the non-bleached CG 
(Fig. 1) (p&lt;0.05). 

Analysis of Surface Roughness and Topography by 

Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)

No significant difference was observed between 
G10 and G16 (p&gt;0.05); but both bleached groups had 
a significantly higher surface roughness compared with 
the non-bleached CG (Fig. 2) (p&lt;0.05). Regarding the 
topography, enamel surfaces in the bleached groups were 
more irregular than in CG, exhibiting more numerous 
and deeper peaks and valleys, suggesting a more evident 
microporous layer on this tissue (Figs. 3B and C), especially 
in the specimens bleached with the 16% CP gel (Fig. 3C).

Discussion
In spite of being considered a safe technique for dental 

structures, the in-home bleaching therapy using 10% CP 
bleaching gel requires a long time to reach a desirable 
esthetic outcome (2 to 4 weeks) (4). A recent study 
demonstrated that it is possible to speed up the whitening 
effect of this technique by increasing CP concentration 
(15). However, the negative effects of high concentration 
CP bleaching gels on this hard dental tissue structure were 
scarcely studied. 

According to the results of the present study, higher 
CP concentration in the bleaching gel results in higher 
and faster decrease of dental enamel microhardness. This 
alteration has been correlated to the oxidative action of HP 
on the organic phase of this hard tissue (2). Disruption of

the enamel organic matrix results in loss of the crystalline 
material sketched out of this matrix, leaving zones of 
erosion intercalated with areas of intact enamel, resulting 
in a rough surface (16,17). The presence of nitrogen and 
oxygen molecules on bleached enamel surface, probably 
due to the interaction of peroxide with the enamel proteins, 
suggests that HP is able of dissolving the enamel organic 
matrix (3). The results of the present investigation may 
confirm this hypothesis, since reduction of Ca and P content 
was observed after bleaching, associated with increase of 
enamel surface roughness. Therefore, as the compositions 
of both gels used in this study are identical except for the 
CP concentration, it may be suggested that the greater 
aggressiveness caused by 16% CP gel in the present 
study was due to the release of higher HP concentrations 
compared to the 10% CP gel. 

Several studies demonstrated that the effects of 
bleaching agents on dental enamel might vary from 
insignificant up to deep alterations on its structure and 
morphology, depending on the bleaching protocol (18-20). 
As observed in the present investigation, some studies 
demonstrated that application of 16% CP gel also causes 
more intense morphological changes on enamel surface 

and reduction of enamel microhardness compared to low-
concentration CP-gels (10-12). On the other hand, other 
studies did not observe significant differences on dental 
enamel structure between bleached or non-bleached 
surfaces (21-23), and also among different concentrations 
of the CP-gels (23). In these investigations, the enamel 
surface was bleached in an in situ environment. In this 
condition, there is an influx of saliva, which presents 
remineralizing ions such as fluoride, calcium and phosphates 
(18). However, at the moment of bleaching procedure, 
increase of enamel porosity allows HP penetration on deep 
enamel and consequently into the pulp chamber (2,3). A 
recent study demonstrated that even when applied onto 
remineralized enamel by fluoride, the 16% CP gel was 
still toxic to the odontoblast-like cells, with no significant 
difference from the non-fluoride treated enamel (24).

In this way, the high-concentration CP gels appear to 
promote greater alteration on dental structure, resulting in a 
more intense trans-enamel and trans-dentinal HP diffusion, 
as previously demonstrated (4). According to the authors, 
the slight increase in CP bleaching gel concentration (from 
10% to 16% CP gel) may be accompanied by significantly 
greater deleterious effects to pulp cells. Based on the 
results of the present study, it is believed that this increased 
toxicity is a result of more alteration of the mineralized 
dental tissues, allowing a higher influx of HP into tooth 
structure. This hypothesis is confirmed by clinical studies, 
which demonstrated a significantly higher prevalence of 
tooth sensitivity for patients who used 20% CP gel (71.4%) 
compared with 10% CP gel (36.8%) (25). Other studies 
demonstrated that the 16% CP gel presents similar results 
of tooth sensitivity as the in-office bleaching protocol with 
35% HP gel (13,14).

This way, since the higher CP concentration causes 
higher toxic effects in the pulp cells (3), more intense and 
prevalent tooth sensitivity (8,25), and higher modifications 
on the mineralized phase of teeth (10-12), with no benefits 
in the final esthetic outcome (14,15,25), the 10% CP gel 
appears to be an interesting alternative for tooth bleaching

associated with less intense adverse events. However, 
based on the fact that data from in vitro study cannot be 
directly extrapolated to clinical situations, it is strongly 
recommended that further in vivo studies should be carried 
out to evaluate the effects of 16% CP gel on enamel, dentin 
and pulp tissue of patients subjected to tooth bleaching. 

According to the methodology used in this in vitro study, 
it may be concluded that both 10 and 16% CP bleaching 
gels reduced the mineral content and increased the surface 
roughness of dental enamel, producing a more irregular 
and porous surface. However, the 16% CP gel promoted 
the most intense alterations on enamel, even after a single 
8-h application.

Resumo
O objetivo do presente estudo foi comparar o efeito de um gel com 16% 
de peróxido de carbamida (PC) sobre a estrutura mineral e morfologia 
do esmalte dental com os efeitos de um gel com 10% de PC. Blocos de 
esmalte provenientes de incisivos bovinos foram submetidos a 14 dias de 
tratamento (8 h/dia) com géis com 10 ou 16% de PC. A microdureza Knoop 
foi avaliada antes do clareamento e 1, 7 e 14 dias pós-tratamento (50 g/15 
s). O conteúdo mineral (EDX), rugosidade de superfície e topografia (MFA) 
foram avaliados no período de 14 dias (ANOVA a dois critérios e teste 
de Tukey; ?=0,05). Redução significante na microdureza foi observada 
nos períodos de 7 e 14 dias para o gel com 10% de PC, e em todos os 
períodos para o gel com 16% de PC (p&lt;0,05). No período de 14 dias, uma 
diminuição significante no conteúdo de Ca e P, aumento na rugosidade 
de superfície (p&lt;0,05), bem como na distância entre picos e vales foram 
observados para ambos os agentes clareadores usados. Estas alterações 
foram mais intensas para o gel com 16% de PC. Pôde-se concluir que 
ambos os géis à base de PC promoveram perda de estrutura mineral do 
esmalte, resultando em superfície mais rugosa e porosa. Porém, o gel 
com 16% de PC causou efeitos adversos mais intensos no esmalte dental.
