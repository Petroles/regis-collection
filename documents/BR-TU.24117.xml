Abstract 
Soil-Aquifer Treatment (SAT) is a well-established Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) 

complementary method which main purpose is to increase water availability in aquifers by 

enhancing the quality of the injected water. SAT-MAR methods are an important way of 

addressing water scarcity challenges by reusing water of impaired quality, such as 

wastewater, converting it into a reliable resource. They can be quite useful in water resource 

management, particularly in semi-arid regions, helping to face decrease of rainfall and long 

drought periods resulting from climate change. In this context, SAT can also present itself as 

a relatively simple and inexpensive complementary method of treatment, lessening possible 

environmental problems. 

The research presented in this dissertation was developed in the framework of EU 7th 

Framework Project MARSOL project which aims to demonstrate the reliability of MAR 

processes to face water scarcity problems in Southern Europe and Mediterranean regions. 

Several soil characterization, soil-column and batch experiments were conducted at National 

Laboratory for Civil Engineering (LNEC) using a soil collected in São Bartolomeu de Messines, 

one of the projects demonstration sites where SAT-MAR basins are to be constructed using 

treated wastewater as primary infiltration water source. 

These experiments aimed to characterize the soil behaviour at lab scale by simulating 

infiltration basin conditions, determining hydraulic characteristics and contaminant retention 

capacities. Natural soil results obtained were later compared to those obtained for a soil 

mixture produced in LNEC. This soil mixture will act as a reactive layer to be installed in the 

bottom of the infiltration basins, increasing capacity to retain certain contaminants detected in 

inflow water, but also keeping acceptable hydraulic conductivity without hindering the water-

soil interaction. The referred mixture results from a combination of cheap and easily available 

materials with the natural soil. 

Unregulated emerging contaminant problematic was also discussed, focussing in 

pharmaceutical compounds, considering the type of source water used in these experiments 

– São Bartolomeu de Messines (SBM) wastewater treatment plant effluent. High concentration 

of ammonia and sulphates were measured and traces of 17 pharmaceuticals were detected. 

SBM natural soil that was used in experiments is a loamy sand composed of 81.91% sand, 

15.95% of silt and 2.14% clay, having quartz, calcite, montmorillonite and anorthite as major 

mineral constituents and traces of dolomite, illite, kaolinite and hematite. It has 24.02% of 

carbonates percentage, low organic matter content (2.66%), average bulk density of 1.44 

g/cm3 and average porosity of 43.6%. 

Five soil-column experiments were conducted in this soil for different time lengths, testing 

different methods of column assembling, thickness, soil packing, saturation conditions and 

injection method (Column 1 to 5 – C1 to C5). For the three different soil mixtures produced, 

four soil column experiments were conducted (Column 6 to 9 – C6 to C9). Outflow samples 

were collected for the experiments that used wastewater as injection source (C3 to C5 and 

C8 and C9) – metals, nitrogen cycle components, major ions and pharmaceuticals were 

analysed. Pharmaceuticals were not measured for C3 inflow. 

Considering hydraulic behaviour for natural soil, and taking as reference the first day of 

experiment, C5 showed highest flow rate (1.504 cm3/min) and permeability (2.536 m/d) while 



III 

C4 showed the worst results (0.363 cm3/min and 0.589 m/d). For soil mixture behaviour, C6 

had higher flow rate and permeability (7.722 cm3/min 12.579 m/d) but this one along C7 

suffered high soil washing out along the experiment. 

Concerning inflow water quality, from 32 parameters analysed (excluding pharmaceuticals), 

C3 had 17 values above the limit of recovery (LOR), C4 and C5 had 17 and C8 and C9 had 

26. For pharmaceuticals, from the 24 parameters analysed, 14 were above LOR in C4 and C5 

inflow, while in C8 and C9, nine parameters were above LOR. 

Comparing the outflow in terms of quality, and more precisely average concentration of metals, 

from 11 parameters considered, C3 has 7 parameters where outflow concentration is higher 

than inflow, while C4 has 6 and C5 has 9. C8 has only 3 parameters in which outflow average 

concentration surpasses the inflow, although inflow sample presents a slight enrichment in 

certain metals when compared to other columns. Phosphorus shows the highest reduction in 

all columns. For nitrogen cycle components, ammonia showed high concentration at inflow 

and a reduction at outflow for all columns, while nitrites present low concentration at inflow 

and high concentration at outflow. C3, C5 and C8 show higher average concentration of 

nitrates when compared to inflow. Concentration at outflow in C8 reaches 140.46 mg/L, a very 

high value when compared to C3 (0.86 mg/L) and C5 (6.51 mg/L). Concerning major ions, for 

the 7 parameters considered, 4 were above inflow concentration C4, C5 and C8. C8 

experiment shows a worse overall behaviour for these parameters than that with higher 

average concentrations. 

Soil samples were collected and analysed after C3 and C5 experiments stopped. C3 shows 

almost equal concentration of boron, copper and zinc in top and bottom sections, but boron 

concentrations were lower. Ammonia showed higher concentrations when compared with 

nitrates and nitrites, being heavily retained in the soil top section, while nitrates where not 

detected in both sections and nitrites showed very small concentration. Phosphorous and 

phosphates show higher concentrations in the soil top section. From the set of selected 

pharmaceuticals, none showed concentrations above LOR in C3. For C5, boron and copper 

showed slightly lower concentrations to those detected in C3, and ammonia shows a high 

concentration on the top section. Nitrates and nitrites were also detected in higher 

concentration on column top section. Phosphorous and phosphates show lower 

concentrations in both sections when compared to C3 and sulphates where not detected in 

both sections. Caffeine was the only detected pharmaceutical compound in C5. 

Batch experiments were also conducted in both natural soil and soil mixture. For the set of 32 

parameters analysed in the inflow and outflow water of natural soil batch, eight showed a 

decrease in concentration in the outflow when compared to inflow. Highest percentage of 

removal is observed in aluminium, followed by iron, and the lowest in sodium. Nitrites, 

sulphate, barium, calcium, chromium, magnesium, manganese, nickel, vanadium and chloride 

showed an increased concentration in outflow. 14 of 24 pharmaceuticals analysed had values 

above LOR, only seven of those were persistent and were detected in the outflow (propanolol, 

bezafibrate, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, naproxen, indometacin and carbamazepine). For the 

persistent compounds, lowest removal rate was detected for naproxen while seven of the 

compounds showed 100% removal (atenolol, betaxolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol, sotalol e 

pentoxifillin). For the same set of parameters, 25 were detected in soil mixture inflow water 

while only 20 were detected in the outflow water. Ammonia presented the highest adsorbed 

amount and copper, zinc, nitrites, calcium, magnesium, manganese, potassium and chloride 



IV 

showed an increase of concentration in outflow. Removal was higher in antimony and lowest 

in lithium. For the pharmaceuticals, 14 were above LOR in inflow water and only 1 in the 

outflow water. 100% removal rate was observed in atenolol, betaxolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol, 

propranolol, sotalol, bezafibrate, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, indomethacin, naproxen 

and pentoxifyllin. Carbamazepine showed recalcitrant behaviour, but a relatively high removal 

rate (86.3%). 

Transport of ammonia, nitrates and nitrites was modelled in Hydrus-1D to understand the 

conditions inside the column in continuous saturated conditions using C3 and C4 data. 

Simulations showed ammonia being retained on the top of the column whereas nitrites showed 

a small increase in concentration as ammonia concentration decrease. Then nitrites 

concentration decrease at the column bottom while nitrates concentration increased. 

Saturation indexes (Log SI) were determined at inflow and outflow for calcite, dolomite and 

hematite in C3, C4 and C8 by hydrogeochemical speciation in PHREEQC. C3 inflow water is 

unsaturated in calcite and dolomite and it’s in equilibrium with hematite. C4 inflow solution is 

close to stability concerning dolomite and calcite while high Log SI for hematite was 

determined, showing saturation in this iron oxide. C8 inflow solution is slightly unsaturated in 

calcite and dolomite, and hematite Log SI is showing oversaturation at inflow. For all columns, 

outflow solutions are saturated in hematite, and oscillate from unsaturation to saturation in 

calcite and dolomite along the experiment. Inverse modelling in PHREEQC was also used in 

C3 to understand phase transfers that occur between inflow solution and the soil media along 

the experiments under invariable saturation conditions. 

The natural soil shows some suitability to be used as a base infiltration layer for the SAT-MAR 

infiltration basins in what concerns infiltration capacity, but is expected to show some problems 

in the long term, with a continuous decrease of permeability. The soil mixture resulted in a 

more pervious material with a good long term hydraulic behaviour, with better response to 

cycles of saturation and non-saturation allowing the oxygenation of the soil. The sequential 

use of oxic/anoxic conditions is the best approach to ensure maximum attenuation efficiency, 

since some elements degrade better in oxic conditions, and others are degraded under 

anaerobic conditions. Complementarily, the increase of organic matter favoured the 

retention/degradation of most pharmaceuticals studied, as well as metals. It was also 

observed that high pH favoured the retention of metals into the soil.

Resumo 
As metodologias de tratamento solo-aquífero (SAT) são geralmente aplicadas no âmbito da 

recarga controlada de aquíferos (MAR) tendo como principal objetivo aumentar a 

disponibilidade de água no aquífero, melhorando a qualidade da água injetada. Apresentam-

se como forma de enfrentar os desafios inerentes à escassez através da reutilização de água 

de fraca qualidade, como águas residuais com tratamento secundário. Podem ser úteis na 

gestão integrada de recursos hídricos, particularmente em regiões semiáridas e em zonas 

sujeitas à diminuição da precipitação com longos períodos de seca resultantes das alterações 

climáticas e apresentar-se como um método complementar de tratamento de água pouco 

dispendioso, permitindo diminuir possíveis problemas ambientais decorrentes da descarga 

no meio ambiente. 

Os trabalhos apresentados foram desenvolvidos no âmbito do projeto MARSOL que tem 

como objetivo demonstrar a fiabilidade dos processos MAR como forma de enfrentar os 

problemas de escassez de água no sul da Europa e Mediterrâneo. Ensaios de caracterização 

do solo, em coluna e do tipo batch foram realizados no Laboratório Nacional de Engenharia 

Civil (LNEC), num solo recolhido na área de estudo de São Bartolomeu de Messines (SBM) 

onde serão construídas bacias SAT-MAR. 

Estes pretenderam caracterizar o comportamento do solo à escala laboratorial, simulando as 

condições existentes nas bacias, determinando características hidráulicas e capacidade de 

retenção de contaminantes. Os resultados obtidos para o solo natural foram comparados com 

um segundo conjunto de ensaios realizados para um solo de mistura produzido no LNEC. 

Este solo de mistura actuará como camada reativa, instalada na base das bacias, permitindo 

o aumento da capacidade de retenção de contaminantes, assegurando uma permeabilidade 

aceitável. 

A problemática dos contaminantes emergentes foi analisada, dando-se especial atenção a 

compostos farmacêuticos. A análise da presença destes compostos em águas tratadas e para 

consumo assume cada vez maior relevância particularmente em países desenvolvidos, 

tendo-se mesmo observado comportamento recalcitrante após tratamento. A qualidade do 

efluente da ETAR de SBM foi analisada sendo registada elevada concentração de amónia e 

sulfatos, sendo também detetados 17 compostos farmacêuticos. 

O solo natural de SBM é uma areia argilosa composta por 81,91% de areia, 15,95% de silte 

e 2,14% de argila, apresentando-se quartzo, calcite, montmorilonite e anortite como principais 

constituintes minerais e evidenciando traços de dolomite, ilite, caulinite e hematite. Possui 

24,02% de carbonatos, baixo teor de matéria orgânica (2,66%), densidade média de 1,44 

g/cm3 e porosidade média de 43,6%. 

Cinco ensaios em coluna foram realizados para este solo tendo-se testado diferentes 

métodos de montagem, espessura de solo, procedimentos de compactação, variações das 

condições de saturação e método de injeção (Coluna 1 a Coluna 5 – C1 a C5). Para o conjunto 

de três solos de mistura com diferentes composições realizaram-se quatro ensaios em coluna 

(Coluna 6 a Coluna 9 – C6 a C9). Amostras foram recolhidas à saída das colunas onde foi 

injetado efluente tratado (C3 a C5 e C8 e C9) tendo-se analisado metais, componentes de 

ciclo de azoto, iões maiores e compostos farmacêuticos. 



VI 

Considerando o comportamento hidráulico do solo natural, e tendo como referência o primeiro 

dia de ensaio, C5 mostrou maior caudal à saída (1,5 cm3/min) e permeabilidade (2,5 m/d), 

enquanto C4 mostrou o pior desempenho (0,4 cm3/min e 0,6 m/d). Para o solo de mistura, C6 

apresentou maior caudal e permeabilidade (7,7 cm3/min e 12,6 m/d). C6 e C7 apresentaram 

forte mobilização de partículas, com perda de espessura e criação de cavidades. 

No que concerne à qualidade da água injetada nas colunas, dos 32 parâmetros analisados 

(excluindo os compostos farmacêuticos), C3 apresentou 17 valores acima do limite de 

deteção (LD), C4 e C5 apresentaram 17 e C8 e C9 apresentaram 26. Nos 24 compostos 

farmacêuticos analisados, 14 estavam acima do LD em C4 e C5, e 9 em C8 e C9. 

Em termos de qualidade, mais precisamente na concentração média de metais, de 11 

parâmetros considerados a C3 obteve 7 onde a concentração de saída foi maior que a de 

entrada, enquanto a C4 teve 6 e a C5 teve 9. A C8 teve apenas 3 parâmetros onde a 

concentração média de saída ultrapassa a de entrada, apesar de ser observável um ligeiro 

enriquecimento em certos metais à entrada em comparação com as restantes colunas. O 

fósforo mostra a maior redução em todas as colunas. Para os componentes do ciclo de azoto, 

a amónia apresentou elevada concentração à entrada e uma significativa redução à saída em 

todas as colunas, enquanto os nitritos apresentaram elevada concentração na saída 

comparativamente aos valores de entrada. C3, C5 e C8 mostram uma concentração média 

mais elevada de nitratos à saída em relação à concentração de entrada. Este parâmetro 

regista 140,46 mg/L à saída da C8, um valor muito elevado quando comparado com C3 (0,86 

mg/L) e C5 (6,51 mg/L). Nos iões maiores, para o conjunto de 7 parâmetros, 4 estavam acima 

da concentração registada à entrada em C4, C5 e C8. C8 mostra um comportamento pior 

para esses iões com concentrações médias mais elevadas à saída. 

Amostras de solo foram analisadas após a conclusão dos ensaios C3 e C5. C3 mostra 

semelhante concentração de boro, cobre e zinco nas secções superior e inferior. A amónia 

mostrou elevadas concentrações, sendo fortemente retida na seção superior do solo, 

enquanto nitratos não foram detetados em ambas as seções e os nitritos mostraram muito 

baixa concentração. Fósforo e fosfatos mostraram concentrações mais elevadas na secção 

superior do solo. Dos compostos farmacêuticos analisados, nenhum apresentou 

concentrações acima dos LD na C3. Na C5, boro e cobre apresentaram concentrações 

ligeiramente mais baixos para os detetados na C3. A amónia, nitratos e nitritos mostram uma 

maior concentração na secção superior da coluna. O fósforo e fosfatos mostram 

concentrações inferiores em ambas as secções quando comparados com a Coluna 3 e não 

foram detetados sulfatos em ambas as secções. A cafeína foi o único composto farmacêutico 

detetado na C5. 

Nos ensaios batch realizados no solo natural, para o conjunto de 32 parâmetros analisados, 

oito mostraram uma diminuição na concentração entre a entrada e a saída. A maior 

percentagem de remoção foi observada para o alumínio, seguido do ferro total. A mais baixa 

foi registada para o sódio. Nitritos, sulfatos, bário, cálcio, crómio, magnésio, manganês, 

níquel, vanádio e cloreto mostraram aumento da concentração na saída. 14 de 24 compostos 

farmacêuticos analisados apresentaram valores acima dos LD à entrada mas apenas sete 

apresentaram comportamento persistente e foram detetados na saída. Os restantes 

compostos apresentaram 100% de remoção. Para o solo de mistura, 25 dos 32 parâmetros 

– em que se incluem metais, iões maiores e compostos do ciclo do azoto – apresentaram 

valores acima dos LD na água de entrada. Apenas 20 foram detetados na água de saída. A 



VII 

amónia apresentou a maior quantidade adsorvida e o cobre, zinco, nitritos, cálcio, magnésio, 

manganês, potássio e cloreto mostraram um aumento de concentração à saída. A remoção 

foi maior em antimónio e menor para o lítio. Dos 24 fármacos considerados, 14 estavam acima 

do LD à entrada e apenas 1 na água de saída. As taxas de remoção de 100% foram 

observadas para 13 desses compostos e 1 mostrou comportamento recalcitrante. 

O transporte da amónia, nitratos e nitritos foi modelado através do software Hydrus-1D tendo 

como objetivo compreender as condições dentro da coluna em regime de saturação contínua 

usando dados de C3 e C4. As simulações demonstraram a retenção da amónia na parte 

superior da coluna. Os nitritos mostraram um pequeno aumento da concentração com a 

diminuição da concentração de amónia. Em seguida, a concentração em nitritos decresce na 

parte inferior da coluna enquanto a concentração de nitratos aumentou ao longo da coluna. 

Os índices de saturação da calcite, dolomite e hematite foram determinados por especiação 

hidrogeoquímica em PHREEQC tanto para as soluções de entrada como de saída da C3, C4 

e C8. A solução de entrada da C3 apresenta subsaturação em calcite e dolomite e está em 

equilíbrio com a hematite. A solução de entrada da C4 está perto do equilíbrio relativamente 

à calcite e dolomite e evidenciando saturação em hematite. A solução de entrada C8 é 

subsaturada em calcite e dolomite, e sobressaturada em hematite. Para todas as colunas, as 

soluções à saída estão saturadas em hematite, e oscilam ao longo dos ensaios entre a 

subsaturação e a saturação em calcite e dolomite. A modelação inversa com base nos dados 

da C3 permitiu compreender as transferências de fase que ocorrem entre uma solução de 

entrada e o solo em condições de saturação contínua. 

Em conclusão, o solo natural mostra alguma aptidão para ser utilizado nas bacias SAT-MAR, 

podendo ocorrer a longo prazo colmatação e diminuição capacidade de infiltração. O solo de 

mistura apresentou maior permeabilidade e comportamento hidráulico mais regular a longo 

prazo, com melhor resposta aos ciclos de saturação/oxigenação, permitindo a oxigenação da 

coluna de solo. A variação das condições de oxidação resulta numa maior eficiência na 

atenuação de um maior espectro de elementos, já que alguns são degradados em ambiente 

oxidante. Concluiu-se também que o aumento da matéria orgânica favorece a 

retenção/degradação da maioria dos compostos farmacêuticos estudados, assim como de 

metais. Verificou-se ainda que o pH elevado favoreceu a retenção de metais no solo.

1. Introduction 
Water scarcity is currently a concerning issue, particularly in semi-arid regions, and presents 

itself as a global challenge to human populations. As climate change starts to be a more 

pressing problem that tends to result from the decrease of rainfall and long drought periods 

hindering water availability in both surface reservoirs and aquifers, groundwater management 

processes represent reliable solutions for assuring water supply in affected regions. In these 

climate change scenarios it is important for groundwater management entities to find 

innovative methodologies to maintain the sustainability of this resource. This where the 

application of Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) together with Soil-aquifer Treatment (SAT) 

methodologies, where the usage of recycled water (or reclaimed water) is promoted, can 

ultimately result in positive impacts by solving scarcity and environmental problems. 

One of the main water sources for MAR is treated wastewater. Instead of direct discharge to 

a surface waterbody, this water may be injected into the aquifer. As it is a continuous supply 

of water, its reuse can represent a solution to the stress induced by increased demand, 

allowing for an integrated management with other types of supply, lessening impacts on the 

overall resource. 

This dissertation focus on the use of Soil-Aquifer Treatment methodologies, at laboratory 

scaled experiments, with the purpose of understanding the increase in water quality induced 

by using specific soil types as depurative layer, giving important instructions for real scale 

SAT-MAR structures management. 

 

1.1. Framework of this dissertation 

This dissertation was developed in the context of an European Union 7th Framework Program 

project named MARSOL - Demonstrating Managed Aquifer Recharge as a Solution to Water 

Scarcity and Drought (www.marsol.eu) that is being developed in the Water Resources and 

Hydraulic Structures unit of the National Laboratory for Civil Engineering’s Hydraulics and 

Environment department, in partnership with other European institutions and small to medium 

enterprises (SMEs). 

As described in the Document of Work of MARSOL project, the main purpose is to 

demonstrate that MAR is a sound, safe and sustainable strategy that can be applied with great 

confidence and therefore offering a key approach for tackling water scarcity in Southern 

Europe and the Mediterranean regions that are facing the challenge of managing its water 

resources under conditions of increasing scarcity and concerns about water quality. Already, 

the availability of fresh water in sufficient quality and quantity is one of the major factors limiting 

socioeconomic development. Innovative water management strategies such as the storage of 

reclaimed water or excess water from different sources in MAR schemes can greatly increase 

water availability and therefore improve water security. For this, eight field sites were selected 

that will demonstrate the applicability of MAR using various water sources, ranging from 

treated wastewater to desalinated seawater, and a variety of technical solutions. Targets are 

the alleviation of the effect of climate change on water resources, the mitigation of droughts, 

to countermeasure temporal and spatial misfit of water availability, to sustain agricultural water 

supply and rural socio-economic development, to combat agricultural related pollutants, to 

sustain future urban and industrial water supply and to limit seawater intrusion in coastal

aquifers. Results of the demonstration sites will be used to develop guidelines for MAR site 

selection, technical realization, monitoring strategies, and modelling approaches, to offer 

stakeholders a comprehensive, state of the art and proven toolbox for MAR implementation. 

Further, the economic and legal aspects of MAR will be analysed to enable and accelerate 

market penetration. The MARSOL consortium combines the expertise of consultancies, water 

suppliers, research institutions, and public authorities, ensuring high practical relevance and 

market intimacy. 

In summary, MARSOL aims to (1) demonstrate at 8 field sites that MAR is a safe and 

sustainable strategy to increase the availability of freshwater under conditions of water 

scarcity, (2) improve the state of the art of MAR applications to enable low cost high efficiency 

MAR solutions that will create market opportunities for European Industry and SMEs (MAR to 

market), (3) promote the advantages of MAR by tailored training and dissemination programs 

to enable and accelerate market penetration and (4) deliver a key technology to face the 

challenge of increasing water scarcity in southern Europe, the Mediterranean and other 

regions of the world. 

The project is divided into 17 Work Packages (WP) guided by three Activity Lines (AL): 

? Activity Line 1 or "Horizontal Activities" consists of Project Management (WP 1) and 

Dissemination, Exploitation &amp;amp; Training Activities (WP 2) 

? Activity Line 2 covers the technical work performed at all the DEMO sites and includes 

"Demonstration Sites" Work Packages (WP 3 to WP 10). 

? Activity Line 3 "Integration and Impact" groups activities that support the 

demonstrations activities and/or collect, evaluate, and assess data produced at the 

DEMO sites such as innovative monitoring techniques (WP 11), modelling (WP 12), 

benchmarking (WP 13), water quality issues (WP 14), economic feasibility 

considerations (WP 15), risk and contingency plans (WP 16), and legal issues and 

knowledge transfer for policy and governance (WP 17).

pollutants, (3) accompanying column experiments, (4) risk assessment, (5) model calibration 

with analysis of the potential of existing models, (6) model or combination of models selector 

and (7) water quality guidelines. The final results will be the development of guidelines for 

water quality requirements of source water in various MAR schemes. 

 

1.2. Dissertation structure 

Besides this introductory section this dissertation is divided in six other sections: 

Section 2 synthetises a brief literature review on the main processes on MAR and explains 

the objectives of SAT processes. In Section 2 a special attention is given to the problem of 

emerging contaminants in the environment in particular in water, presenting a set of actual 

concerns and describing other projects that address this issue. 

Section 3 describes the geological and hydrogeological background of the study area, as well 

as the main problems resulting from the discharge of wastewater and the possible use of this 

water supply in MAR processes by insuring that environmental conditions are enhanced by 

use of SAT. 

Section 4 is the core of this dissertation and thoroughfully describes the laboratorial apparatus 

for all the experiments conducted for soil characterization, short and long term hydraulic 

behaviour, parameters analysed and both water and soil sampling procedures. In this section 

there is also the presentation of the methodologies and criteria used for the creation of soil 

mixture, an extensive description of the results achieved in soil characterization experiments, 

soil-column experiments and batch experiments conducted both in natural soil and soil 

mixtures. 

Section 5 presents the numerical modelling processes at soil-column scale. A brief description 

of the software used is presented, as well as input data for column models. Output information 

concerning compound transport is summarized, as well as water speciation and inverse 

solution in geochemistry. 

Section 6 compares Section 4 laboratory experiment results between natural soil and soil 

mixtures in terms of hydraulic behaviour and contaminant retention, allowing for the selection 

of the most suitable reactive layer. 

Finally, Section 7 summarizes the main conclusions of this dissertation offering a set of 

recommendations concerning the reactive layer creation and operation procedures. 

Experiments limitations are also briefly discussed and suggestions on future research are 

given.

1.3. Objectives 

The main objective of the research developed is, in general terms, to improve the environment 

conditions in the wastewater discharge area by increasing quality using Managed Aquifer 

Recharge through the usage of Soil-Aquifer Treatment (SAT). These methodologies are 

presented as a reliable complementary water treatment process and a solution, not only for 

water scarcity, but also environmental problems. 

The application/use of SAT techniques requires an advanced knowledge of the 

purification/decontamination capacities of the soil and aquifer media that will act as a filter. In 

this sense, several soil characterization and soil-column experiments were conducted in the 

groundwater laboratory located in the Hydraulics and Environment Department of the National 

Laboratory for Civil Engineering (LASUB – LAboratório de Águas SUBterrâneas) in soils 

collected in the area of the infiltration basin installation. The objective of these experiments 

was to characterize the soil behaviour at lab scale but in similar conditions to those of 

infiltration scale. Also, simple batch experiments were conducted to define the maximum 

retention capacity of a set of pre-selected contaminants. 

Depending on the results obtained, both in contaminant retention capacity – mainly by the 

comparison between the inflow and outflow parameters concentration – and by the hydraulic 

behaviour, a soil mixture can be produced and again tested in the soil-column experiments 

and batch experiments. The objective of this soil mixture is to increase the soil capacity to 

retain certain contaminants analysed in the inflow water, but also keeping hydraulic 

conductivity that allows an easily infiltration process without hindering the water-soil interaction 

processes. This soil mixture will act as a reactive layer to be installed on the bottom of the 

infiltration basins. This procedure – real scale experiments – will not be conducted during the 

time of conclusion of this dissertation, but the information collected will be fundamental for this 

stage. 

A second stage is to be carried, dedicated to the modelling of the transport and retention of 

contaminants at column scale by using the Hydrus-1D software and water speciation with 

PHREEQC. This will allow the visually understanding of these processes that occurs in the 

soil-column given certain soil and contaminant parameters. 

In summary, this dissertation includes the following objectives: 

? Characterization of the infiltration basin soil properties. 

? Characterization of the physical and chemical behaviour of these soils as a filtrating 

and purifying layer, both under soil-column and batch experiments conditions. 

? Criteria definition, given the results obtained in the experiments, of the soil mixture for 

contaminant retention capacity increase. 

? Numerical modelling of the chemical processes that occur at soil-column scale and 

simulation of transport in saturated and unsaturated media. 

Initially two areas were defined for the application of SAT-MAR methodologies – São 

Bartolomeu de Messines and Melides Lagoon. Due to the large amount of data gathered and 

the lack of time to analyse it taking into account MARSOL project deadlines, this dissertation 

focused only in one of the study areas, São Bartolomeu de Messines.

2. State of the Art 
In this section a brief literature review will be presented regarding the main subjects of this 

dissertation. Section 2.1 focus on Managed Aquifer Recharge while Section 2.2 presents 

some important aspects of the Soil-Aquifer Treatment, the main methodology studied in this 

dissertation. The following sections refer to the main aspects, problems and advantages of 

these methods, namely clogging, water origin and quality, ending with a section dedicated to 

Emerging Contaminants (EC) problematic. 

 

2.1. Managed Aquifer Recharge 

In general terms, Dillon et al. (2009) defined Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) as the 

purposeful recharge of water to aquifers for subsequent recovery or environmental benefit, 

while Gale (2005) defines MAR as an intentional storage and treatment of water in aquifers.  

The term of Artificial Recharge has been the most common expression in the past to describe 

these processes. However adverse connotation of the “artificial” term resulted in the 

abandonment of this expression to avoid hindering the public acceptance of these processes. 

The term enhanced recharge has also been suggested by the scientific community. It’s also 

easier to distinguish between the natural process of rainfall water infiltration and the 

anthropogenic induced process recharge, defining it as a well-organized, effective and 

efficient project with specific objectives. 

As described by the United States National Research Council (NRC, 1994) report on artificial 

recharge1 the main purpose of this process is to replenish an aquifer by storing water 

underground in times of surplus to meet water demand in times of shortage through infiltration 

methods such as surface spreading, recharge wells or by altering the natural conditions. 

Besides this use, this processes can also control sea water intrusion in coastal aquifers and 

migrant contaminant plumes, land subsidence resulting from declining groundwater levels or 

maintain streams base flow. These benefits can also be extended to impediment of soil 

erosion by increase of infiltration. DINA-MAR (2010) inventoried other environmental 

applications of MAR as a result of the water table rise in the recovery of groundwater 

dependent ecosystems such as caves, wetlands, prairies and marshes. Other uses may be 

temperature control for industry procedures using the stable temperatures of subsurface or 

the use of saline aquifers for potable water storage (Murray et al., 2007). 

Accordingly to Gale (2005), the benefits of an effectively managed aquifer can be of relevance 

in (1) poverty reduction &amp;amp; livelihood stability, (2) economic and health risk reduction, (3) 

increased agricultural yields resulting from reliable irrigation, (4) increased economic returns, 

(5) distributive equity by more accessible water to everyone and (6) reduced vulnerability. In 

small communities MAR may represent a cheap and safe water supply which will be essential 

in semi-arid and arid areas, and has been a common practice for centuries in several 

techniques. 

The human activities which enhance aquifer recharge can be put into three categories (Dillon 

et al., 2009): (1) unintentional, which result from the deep seepage under irrigation areas or

leaks from water pipes, (2) unmanaged, that includes stormwater drainage wells and septic 

tank leach fields and (3) managed, through specific mechanisms/devices. 

Gale (2005) defined 15 types of MAR device classification, to which DINA-MAR (2010) added 

8 more (variations of irrigation systems that result in an increase of water return to the aquifer 

and MAR in urban areas techniques) – Table 1. Some of these system schemes are 

represented in Figure 1.

As described by Dillon et al. (2009), the induced storage by MAR in aquifers has some 

advantages but also some disadvantages when compared to surface storing. The main 

advantage is the land area required which is very small compared with a surface dam. This 

represents an increase of area for rural and urban uses. MAR structures can be dimensioned 

accordingly to use, and they need considerably smaller surface areas when compared to dams 

that usually require a suitable valley, making it almost impossible to place them near urban 

areas. In the comparison of capital costs, a MAR structure is, by far, less expensive than a 

dam, and requires less investigation investment. 

A surface reservoir is usually more exposed to evaporation losses, algal problems and 

mosquitoes and has a large contamination potential. In contrast, a below ground reservoir has 

a smaller supply rate and intake of water, but allows, by SAT processes, a natural 

decontamination. Also, as referred by Bouwer (2002) dams interfere with river ecology and 

can flood sensitive areas, with cultural, religious, archaeological, recreational and scenic 

impacts. Other advantages of aquifer storage is that the first doesn’t need to relocate 

population, does not tend to have large silt accumulations, does not and produce large 

quantities of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. 

On the other hand MAR applications may require great expertise for it to be successful, which 

can represent an obstacle for its development. Also there is the concern about the possible 

damage of these processes in the aquifer and the environmental effects of the fluctuating 

groundwater levels, particularly in dependent ecosystems and, in shallow aquifers, the 

increase of aquifer vulnerability to contamination (Murray et al. 2010).These factors may be 

an obstacle at entry point for MAR implementation as a wide technique for managing 

groundwater, but so far it has been applied with success in several countries. 

Dillon et al. (2009) defined five critical elements for a successful MAR project: 

? Demand – within an economic scale, demand has to provide the revenue stream to 

pay for the water supply cost elements of a project. As an example in reclaimed water 

projects, the decline in discharge of treated effluent to sea may provide motivation for 

investment in MAR; 

? Source – enough water for recharge must be available so it allows to build up a buffer 

storage to meet reliability and quality requirements; 

? Aquifer – the media has to have enough storage capacity and be able to retain water; 

? Detention Storage – there should be enough space for water detainment to enable the 

target volume of recharge to be achieved and also enough space for treatment process 

after recovery if necessary; 

? Management capability – This means enough knowledge acquired both in 

hydrogeological and geotechnical and in terms of water storage and treatment design. 

Several projects applied MAR methods with success. In Portugal, the 6th Framework Program 

GABARDINE project started in 2005, with the main objective of exploring the viability of 

supplementing existing water resources in semi-arid areas with alternative sources of water 

that could be exploited based on an integrated water resources management approach, tried 

to apply MAR technologies in the Southern region - Algarve. The main purpose of this 

application was to rehabilitate the groundwater quality of a heavily nitrate contaminated aquifer 

– Campina de Faro – resulting from several years of inappropriate intense agricultural uses 

(Diamantino, 2009). The water source used was from surface runoff and it was infiltrated into 



9 

basins built in the bed of a perennial stream. Other experiments using injection large diameter 

wells were also conducted in the area. 

 

2.2. Soil-aquifer Treatment 

It is well known that the natural water recycling happens through the global hydrological cycle, 

which is expected to suffer major variations due to the climatic changes. As anthropogenic 

pressures increase over water resources, it is important that a change in attitude towards 

water use occurs. It’s in this context that the development of water reuse techniques is in 

implementation, being the growing research and application of Soil-aquifer Treatment (SAT) 

techniques a good example. Accordingly to Bouwer (2000), planned local water reuse may be 

important, as the discharge of sewage effluent is becoming increasingly difficult and 

expensive, since treatment requirements become more strict to protect the quality of the 

receiving waters, making economically attractive to treat and reuse rather than discharge. 

Abel (2014) defines SAT as a land-based MAR technology adopted as a way to reliably 

enhance water resources and reduce indiscriminate discharge of treated wastewater to water 

bodies. Physical, chemical and biological processes improve the quality of wastewater effluent 

during infiltration through soil strata. Bdour et al. (2009) characterizes this process as a geo-

purification system in which the aquifer is recharged with partially treated wastewater through 

the unsaturated zone before mixing with native water. In terms of methodologies, a treated 

effluent is intermittently placed in recharge basins, allowing for the infiltration into the ground 

for the recharge of the aquifers, and as the effluent moves through the soil and the aquifer it 

undergo quality improvement through the previously referred processes (Miotli?ski et al. 2010) 

- Figure 3. 

 

Figure 3 – SAT system infiltrating water to an unconfined aquifer (Miotli?ski et al. 2010) 

 

The SAT process provides mechanical filtration of suspended particles and, resulting from 

intermittent aerobic and anaerobic conditions in the soil under the basin, nitrification and 

denitrification is facilitated, allowing the partial or total removal of organic and inorganic 

nitrogen and organic carbon, phosphorus, non-aromatic organic, trace metals or pathogens 



10 

(Miotli?ski et al., 2010). The removal process can be controlled by managing wetting and 

drying cycles, and it’s highly dependent on the quality of available water. 

Simply put, NRC (1994) indicates that the soil and underlying aquifer have a great capacity to 

remove contaminants and pathogens, by reduction or removal of these constituents, as the 

water moves towards bigger depths in the aquifer. This represent an important step in reducing 

potential health risks at the time of recovery. 

The pre-treatment of wastewater effluent can be made before spreading, to deliver the 

required quality either by regulations or for optimum operational purposes. SAT can be flexible 

concerning the wastewater quality and pre-treatment as primary, secondary or tertiary 

effluents can be used (Abel, 2014). 

NRC (1994) determined that the ideal soil for SAT system balances the need for a high 

recharge rate (coarse-textured soils) with the need for efficient contaminant adsorption and 

removal (fine-textured soils). It should posess the suitable physical and chemical properties to 

achieve sufficient contaminant removal (Abel, 2014). For the stated reasons SAT systems are 

very site specific. Also wastewater effluent should be considered together with site 

characteristics to evaluate the feasibility of SAT (Cha et al., 2004). 

Abel (2014) studied the effects of several factors in SAT success of removal using primary 

effluent, such as effect of pre-treatment of primary effluent used, impact of hydraulic loading 

rate and soil type, wetting and drying cycles, biological activity and temperature and redox 

conditions. It was concluded that the pre-treatment of effluent alone resulted in 90% of 

suspended solids, 70% of dissolved organic carbon, 98% of phosphorous. Also, low hydraulic 

loading rates and fine particles soil can, with longer contact time and presence of adsorption 

processes, allow the reduction of nitrogen, while wetting/drying cycles helped in E. coli and 

total coliforms removal. Temperature and redox conditions also affect SAT performance, with 

high nitrogen removal at 15-25ºC temperature interval (89.7 to 99%) with an increase of 

nitrates and phosphates removal with temperature increase, indicating that lower viscosity 

increases adsorption. Higher contaminant removal was achieved with aerobic operating 

conditions, which suggested that aeration prior to infiltration process (with wetting and drying 

cycles) can improve SAT success. Malolo (2011) also showed temperature effect in ammonia 

nitrogen oxidation, which was maximum (76%) in soil-column experiments using primary 

effluent at temperatures of 20ºC. Phosphorous also shown a dependence on temperature. 

Bekele et al. (2011) demonstrated that secondary treated wastewater was infiltration through 

a 9 m-thick calcareous vadose zone during a 39 month managed aquifer recharge (MAR) field 

trial resulted in the reductions of the average concentrations of phosphorous (30%), fluoride 

(66%), iron (62%) and total organic carbon (51%). 

NRC (1994) also demonstrates the example of the nitrogen cycle in SAT in which nitrogen is 

quickly transformed to nitrates, very mobile in soils under normal conditions but can be 

removed by denitrification under anaerobic conditions. Other components such as phosphorus 

are reduced by sorption and precipitation, and trace metals, with exception of boron, are 

attenuated and can be precipitated in the soil, especially under alkaline and aerobic conditions. 

SAT cannot substitute water treatment processes simply because processes by which 

removal occur are not completely efficient in natural settings, resulting from the significant 

number of ever changing factors, and not all constituents are retained or degraded. This is the 



11 

reason that NRC (1994) indicate that this processes is dependent on management strategies, 

and with adequate monitoring, a SAT system may help to reduce treatment costs. 

Also, public acceptance of this type of treatment is fundamental for the implementation, and 

some communities still perceive recycled water as disgusting regardless to the extent of 

advanced water treatment the recycled water suffered (Abel, 2014). Socio-economic, cultural 

and religious factors can influence the use of this type of water, being education and 

community programmes fundamental to compete against false notions of unsafety and 

impurity (Bouwer, 1991). Many regions that face stress in their renewable source of water 

have not exploited this technology in full potential, so public outreach programs addressing 

these issues should be created to bridge the gap between institutions and end users (Abel, 

2014). 

Presently there are SAT facilities functioning worldwide. One example of successful 

application is Alice Springs SAT system, Australia. Operation started at 2008 and consists in 

four infiltration basins. As a result of this system operation Miotli?ski et al. (2010) observed 

that phosphorus removal is quite effective, and there is a freshening of the Quaternary aquifer 

with groundwater getting more suitable for agricultural purposes in terms of salinity which can 

be recovered in the future. 

 

2.3. Clogging 

As referred by Bouwer (2002), the main problem in infiltration MAR systems is clogging of the 

infiltrating surface that results in a decrease of infiltration rates. This phenomenon outcomes 

from physical, biological and chemical processes. 

It’s important, in the context of scaled laboratory experiments of MAR structures, to understand 

these processes as a way to comprehend the soil and aquifer behaviour, the effects of inflow 

water, and also to achieve the best conditions to avoid inviable projects. 

Martin (2013) states that a MAR scheme will invariably experience clogging and where the 

selected method involves an injection and recovery bore (aquifer storage and recovery 

process or ASR, see Figure 1) the risk of clogging is potentially greater. In general, this 

process often results, in the case of infiltration basins, of minerals precipitation and gas 

entrapment in soil, biofilm formation and by algae and sediment accumulation and deposition. 

Hutchison et al. (2013) presents the effects of this phenomena in spreading facilities, such as 

reducing infiltration rates, diminishing the effectiveness of soil-aquifer treatment, necessity of 

regular maintenance (with basin flow ripping and draining) and in an extreme scenarios 

leading to site abandonment. Accordingly to Martin (2013), clogging can be divided into four 

types: (1) chemical, with elements precipitation and matrix dissolution, (2) physical that 

comprehend the suspended solids and interstitial fines migration, (3) mechanical such as 

entrained air binding and (4) biological with algae growth, iron or sulphate reducing bacteria. 

The clogging layer in infiltration basins is usually not very thick (Hutchison et al., 2013) and is 

composed essentially of suspended solids, algae, microbes, dust and salts. This layer will 

decrease permeability and make the basin bottom unsaturated. According to the author, two 

types of clogging layers exist: (1) upper layer with particulate matter, algae and/or microbes 

above the original sediment surface, and (2) lower layer composed with the native sediment 

with organic and inorganic solids trapped in the pore space. 



12 

In this type of structures, besides water quality, other parameters will influence the extent of 

clogging. One of the most relevant is the particle size of the soil media, where the fine grained 

sediments will create a clogging layer faster than coarse graded, although the extent of this 

layer may be bigger in coarse graded sediment media. Ponding depth is also a factor for 

clogging effect with a higher compaction of clogging layer occurring in higher depths. The 

loading rate (or rate at which water is applied to the soil surface) is also important to consider 

with lower hydraulic rates to achieve better results, especially in loading cycles where the 

basins are allowed to dry 50 percent of the time. Finally, vegetation in the pond will contribute 

to the decrease of soil permeability, considering not only root exudates but also effect from 

leafs. On the other hand root expansion may help in soil loosening (Hutchison et al., 2013). 

Concerning the chemical clogging, the main problems are related to the precipitation of iron 

oxides and hydroxides as well as calcium carbonate and usually are related to other forms of 

clogging. Accordingly to Martin (2013) many geochemical reactions are catalysed by bacteria, 

which creates a strong correlation to biological clogging, especially in iron and manganese 

rich aquifers and soils which, in the presence of oxygen, stimulate microorganisms the 

precipitate iron or manganese oxides and hydroxides. Dissolution is also a factor to instability, 

where soluble materials such as clays, anhydrite or halite may be dissolved leaving occluded 

pores that can be filled with insoluble fines creating blockage effects. 

Physical clogging may have similar effects as chemical clogging. In spreading methods, fines 

migration associated with turbulence resulting from water injection pulses, can create fines 

settlement that be consequently suffer larger mobilization in each injection cycle. Concerning 

clays, swelling may be the biggest issue, which block pores and result in severe hydraulic 

conductivity reductions. Also, temperature variations may also affect infiltration due to the 

changes in water viscosity, which may be seasonal. Higher viscosity from lower temperatures 

results in lower infiltration rates. Benamar (2013) also concluded that physical clogging (as 

well as filtration) depends on particle concentration and flow conditions. 

Biological clogging may result from growth of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, usually from 

injection water and it’s directly associated with the amount of nutrients in solution, which 

accumulate themselves in biofilms that repel fluid and block pores. 

Clogging problems can be prevented by controlling the injection water quality, by suspended 

solids removal, pH managing or dissolved oxygen control, although it does not solve 

microbiological activity clogging related problems. Also, extended ponding periods enhance 

soil clogging whereas wetting and drying cycles will ultimately help in reduce the effects of 

clogging layer (Hutchison et al., 2013). 

 

2.4. MAR water sources and quality 

As stated by EU (2001), although the natural and artificial recharge involves basically the same 

physical, geochemical and biological processes, in the second case the infiltration rate is 

usually higher thus affecting the water content in the unsaturated zone. Also, depending on 

the origin, the concentrations of solute and contaminants in the water are higher when 

compared to rainwater, and most certainly will have different chemical composition from the 

aquifer water. In this scenario it’s important to have into account the chemical and 

microbiological impacts on the native groundwater. 



13 

The origin of water used in recharge processes can be diverse, from municipal wastewater, 

industrial wastewater, stormwater runoff and irrigation return flow. Gale (2005) extended the 

list of potential source of water for MAR, each with its own particularities in terms of quality: 

perennial stream/river/canal and intermittent flood flow, and storage dams. 

Accordingly to NRC (1994) the injection water may be affected by several factors, directly 

dependent of its origin. For storm water runoff, besides its quantity and intensity, its quality is 

highly dependent on the characteristics of the drainage basin, time since last rainfall event 

and season. For irrigation return flow, that presents the widest variation in quality, may be 

dependent on the type of culture and the farmer irrigation methods, and this water source is 

not usually subjected to any kind of treatment. 

In the case of wastewater, which represent a very interesting option given its immediate 

availability, its quality is related to the treatment processes that it has been subjected to – 

primary to tertiary treatment. The major constituents of this type of water are quite known, but 

less is known about trace constituents (see section 2.5). Also, besides organic compounds, 

nitrogen species, phosphorous and pathogen organisms, when water is treated to a higher 

degree, i.e. exposed to chlorine disinfection, the effluent will contain disinfection by-products 

which, in MAR, may represent a concern if the recovered water is for human consumption. 

Henze and Comeau (2008) divided the constituents of wastewater into main categories (Table 

2).

Asano and Cotruvo (2004) refer four quality factors for reclaimed wastewater use in MAR: (1) 

microbiological quality, (2) total dissolved solids (TDS), (3) presence of heavy metal toxicants 

and (4) concentration of stable and potentially harmful organic substances. These factors will 

highly influence the pre-treatment and type of more suitable MAR, considering also its 

purpose, location and public acceptance, giving that the direct injection of wastewater into an 

aquifer, for later recovery, can require a more sophisticated approach in pre-treatment. A set 

of criteria for groundwater recharge with reclaimed wastewater has been proposed to the State 

of California Regional Water Quality Control Boards, which included total nitrogen requirement 

of 10 mg/L and 1 mg/L of nitrite. 



14 

Concerning the legislation framework, besides the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) 

which defines the good chemical, quantitative and ecological status of water bodies, 

Groundwater Directive (2006/118/EC) that rules the groundwater chemical status concerning 

nitrates, pesticides and other parameters/compounds concentration, there is no official 

regulatory legislation to define the characteristics of source water to be used in MAR at 

European scale like the previous directives. The Water Framework Directive specifies MAR 

as measure to achieve acceptable status but without referring to quality aspects. National 

scale legislations start to take into account the MAR processes giving the importance of 

regulation in different water uses. According to DEMEAU (2013), several countries have 

regulated MAR having as background the European Framework. Spain, defined quality criteria 

for several parameters such as E. coli, TDS, turbidity, and nitrogen/nitrates. Netherlands 

Water Act integrates rules for artificial infiltration and protection of infiltration areas and soils, 

while Switzerland Federal law and Ordinance of water protection regulates MAR installations 

and defines the general requirements of groundwater quality affected by infiltration. Germany, 

in Groundwater Ordinance, defines values that refer to minimum water quality at the point of 

reaching groundwater surface. Previous projects such as AQUAREC (2006) or 

RECLAIMWATER (2012) suggested quality requirements for MAR injection water, which 

concern not only parameters like pH, conductivity and TDS but also nitrates, nitrites, ammonia, 

phosphate, sulphate, arsenic, boron, cadmium, chloride, chromium, zinc, mercury and lead. 

 

2.5. Emerging contaminants 

United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines emerging pollutants as new 

chemicals without regulatory status and which impact on environment and human health are 

poorly understood. Use of reclaimed or recycled water is more common nowadays not only in 

irrigation but also in MAR/SAT processes (and others that efficiently use this type of water). 

As usage of this source of water increases, the concept of emerging contaminants (EC) starts 

to be more of a concern, particularly in economically developed countries where environmental 

law tends to be more restrictive concerning water quality and the associated uses. 

This results mainly from a more and more detailed view of these waters composition and its 

long term effects in the environment, particularly in the case of treated wastewater, due to the 

considerable organic and biologic content commonly found in some types of recycled water 

such as treated wastewater (Henze &amp;amp; Comeau, 2008). 

The emergent contaminant problem, and in particular, the presence of pharmaceuticals in 

water is a more common subject nowadays mainly because of the recent advances in 

analytical chemistry and lower detection limits (Schwab et al., 2005). Although, in the vast 

majority of cases, pharmaceuticals have been detected in natural waters only in nanograms 

to micrograms per litre, there is a lack of knowledge of their impact in the middle or long-term 

on human health as well as the environmental effects, particularly aquatic environments 

exposed to these compounds (Deblonde et al., 2011). 

These long term effects to are yet unknown, particularly those resulting from complex 

pharmaceutical mixtures, and there is an urgent need for risk assessment studies (Schwab et 

al., 2005). 



15 

While not directly toxic or carcinogenic, the chemicals that enter wastewater by discharges of 

pharmaceutical industries, hospitals, medical facilities and households (by direct flushing and 

by human excreta with unmetabolized compounds) may produce adverse health effects by 

interfering with hormone production or by weakening immune systems (Bouwer 2000). 

There are also records of problems in fauna and flora, namely an increase of bacteriological 

resistance to antibiotics and other compounds, increasing risk of disease as well as 

reproductive problems detected in aquatic organisms exposed to certain disrupting hormone 

compounds (Strathmann et al., 2010). These are mainly a result of the direct discharge of 

pharmaceutical compounds in the environment through treated (or poorly treated) 

wastewaters and are recently being increasingly addressed in research programs.  

For these reasons pharmaceuticals and similar compounds should be kept out of water 

environment as much as possible (NRC, 1994). Directive 2008/205/EC, which regulates the 

environmental quality standards of a set of priority hazardous substances in surface waters, 

does not contemplate the regulation of pharmaceuticals. 

Christensen (1998) and Webb et al. (2003) conclude that concentrations found in aquatic 

media for some pharmaceuticals are subsequently transmitted to drinking water and to fish. 

However, these do not pose significant risk to human health although, accordingly to 

Cunningham et al. (2009), the effects of chronic exposure to the mixture of these emerging 

compounds should be prevented, possible susceptibility of individuals (particularly in 

debilitated or imunosupressed populations) should be defined, and the efficiency of treatment 

methods for the removal of pharmaceutical in wastewater treatment plants should be 

increased. 

In a literature review by Calisto and Esteves (2009), large discrepancies are observed in the 

amount of pharmaceuticals removed during the treatment process of the WWTP, indicating 

that some employed methods show removal efficiencies below 10%, and consequently large 

quantities of active substances discharged unaltered. In some cases, this justifies a high 

occurrence of these compounds in environmental matrices, reinforcing the need to find viable 

alternatives to removal through remediation strategies that minimize the impact of this 

problem. With today’s scientific knowledge, these low concentrations of pharmaceutical active 

compounds and other contaminants are, from a toxicological point of view, not harmful to 

humans but their occurrence in ground- or drinking water may not be desirable from a hygienic 

point of view or with regard to the precautionary principle (Heberer, 2002). 

Richardson and Bowron (1985) addressed the problem of pharmaceuticals in aquatic 

environments, considering 200 of these substances. Many would metabolise to innocuous 

substances (conjugates) which can be hydrolysed during treatment. Biodegradation studies 

in 25 compounds that included naproxen, ibuprofen or paracetamol indicated that 14 of them 

were non-biodegradable (that included amitriptyline, chlorhexidine, clofibrate, coideine 

phosphate, dextropropoxyphene, erythromycin, meprobamate, methyldopa, metronidazole, 

naproxen, sulphamethoxazole, sulphasalazine, tetracycline and tulbutamide). 

In a more detailed view, Ternes (1998), determined that due to the incomplete removal of drug 

residues during passage through a WWTP, above 80% of the 32 selected pharmaceuticals 

were detectable in at least one municipal sewage treatment plant effluent with concentration 

levels up to 6.3 mg/L (carbamazepine) and thus resulting in the contamination of the receiving 



16 

waters. It was also concluded that the drugs detected in the environment were predominantly 

applied in human medicine; therefore it can be assumed that the load of municipal WWTP 

effluents in the surface water highly influences the contamination - Figure 4. 

 

Figure 4 - Scheme for the main fates of drugs in the environment after application (STP meaning sewage 
treatment plant) (adapted from Ternes, 1998) 

 

Heberer et al. (2011) concluded that several polar organic compounds, including 

pharmaceuticals, are relevant to MAR in bank-filtration (an efficient natural attenuation 

treatment process for natural surface-water). Compounds such as bezafibrate or, diclofenac 

seem to be removed effectively during bank filtration, while others, such as carbamazepine, 

clofibric-acid, primidone or propyphenazone are not (Lake Wannsee transect in Berlin, 

Germany). Endocrine disrupting compounds including herbicides and one pharmaceutical 

were also detected in surface water, water-supply wells, or drinking water at three bank-

filtration sites in Nebraska, United States. Pharmaceuticals were also identified at the ng/L-

level in Berlin tap water samples (Heberer, 2002). 

Teijon et al. (2010) identified in Llobregat delta (Spain), 26 of 100 analysed compounds, where 

22 of them were pharmaceuticals and 4 were personal care products (limit of recovery, LOR 

of 0.1 µg/L) in groundwater samples. Water from Depurbaix WWTP showed at effluent higher 

values than influent and diuretics, blood lipid regulator, beta-blockers, analgesics, antibiotics 

and fragrance where detected. In 60% of groundwater samples collected in that study area 

substances like caffeine, niconite and galaxolide (musk fragrance) were found, rarely 

exceeding a few µg/L. Carbamazepine, ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazone have also been 

found in WWTP and groundwater samples above LOR. Teijon et al. (2010) observed that from 

the set of compounds analysed, pharmaceuticals are the most common detected for that area. 

It was also observed that although tertiary treatment efficiently removed some compounds, 

others still been detected in much lower concentration. 

In a database that included drugs for human health and disinfectants and collected 

concentration data for 50 pharmaceuticals, caffeine is the molecule whose concentration in 

influent was highest (in means 56.63 ?g/L) with a removal rate around 97%, leading to a 

concentration in the effluent that did not exceed 1.77 ?g/L. It was also shown that analgesics, 



17 

anti-inflammatories and beta-blockers are the most resistant to treatment with 30 to 40% of 

removal rate in WWTPs (Deblonde et al., 2011). 

Ying et al. (2004) detected the presence of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDC) in sewage 

effluents, such as 17beta-estradiol, 17alpha-ethynylestradiol, bisphenol A, in concentrations 

that range from nanograms to micrograms and conducted sorption tests to define attenuation 

factors in ASR systems. De Mes et al. (2005) defined EDC, used as oral contraceptives, as a 

threat affecting aquatic life by its estrogenic character, which environmental presence has 

been identified as a possible cause of adverse trends in reproductive health and prevalence 

of cancer in endocrine sensitive tissues 

Although the issue of emerging contaminants is not likely to be, for now, a problem of major 

proportions, Jones et al. (2005) assert it would be prudent to apply in this case, the 

precautionary principle trying to reduce the levels of these compounds before their 

dangerousness is proven by monitoring and prevention. 

DEMEAU project (7th Framework Programme), which aimed to demonstrate the importance 

of MAR concerning water quality impact and safety assurance, compiled a set of emerging 

substances and their removal rates influence parameters in several matrix. Accordingly to 

DEMEAU (2013) 12 pollutants from 40 compounds that represent emerging substances were 

selected considering a criteria: (1) commonly found in wastewater &amp;amp; drinking water supplies, 

(2) environmental relevance, (3) different chemical and physical properties, (4) cover the range 

from good to bad elimination by several methods and (5) existence of analytical methods of 

measuring its concentrations. These 12 substances (benzontriazole, bezafibrate, 

carbamazepine, epoxy-carbamazepine, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, iopromide, metroprolol, 

phenazone, primidone, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) were analysed considering the 

influencing parameters that result in attenuation, like residence time (RT), redox conditions, 

organic carbon in sediment and water, attenuation/sorption capacity of sediment, and 

existence of an unsaturated zone and temperature. 

From the literature review in DEMEAU (2015) it was learned that in MAR processes 

Benzotriazole compound removal occurs only in anoxic conditions with RT of 20 days to 1 

year, with 75 to 85% of removal occurring in 4 months RT with iron/manganese reduction 

conditions. Bezafibrate attenuate in oxic to reductive conditions and RT ranging to days to 1 

year. 40% removal achieved in nitrate reduction conditions and less than 3 months RT. 

Carbamazepine, which was found to be recalcitrant in both oxic and in nitrate and manganese 

conditions with pour removal, achieved rates of 99% removal in strictly anoxic conditions with 

long RT. Diclofenac removal occurred in different redox conditions and RT from days to 

months, being insignificantly removed under nitrate and manganese reduction conditions. 

Epoxy-Carbamazepine was removed (85%) in the presence of an organic layer at short RT, 

although the authors indicate that there is little information about this substance behaviour in 

MAR systems. Gemfibrozil is highly removed in all conditions and RT from 1 day to 3 months, 

with best rate achieved in high temperatures (97 to 100%). Ioprimide was successfully 

removed both in oxic and anoxic conditions with RT from 1 day to several months. Metoprolol 

shows high removal (100%) with long RT of more than 6 moths. Again, little information was 

collected about this substance. Phenazone showed good removal with short residence time 

and best results in oxic conditions (91%), although in some cases authors found inconsistent 

behaviour. Primidone was not removed in both oxic and reduction conditions and showed 

recalcitrant behaviour with only 30% removal in long RT. Sulfamethoxazole removal showed 



18 

good removal rates from 80 to 99% in anoxic conditions. Finally, from the 12 selected 

substances, trimethoprim removal was achieved both in oxic and anoxic conditions and RT 

ranging to 1 year, and high success achieved (90 to 100%) with 1 month of RT. In general, 

literature review showed consistency on the attenuation conditions of each compound. 

In this context the authors defined a set of design and planning instructions for the removal of 

these substances, concerning the potential additional water and soil treatment to ensure 

attenuations – Table 3. 

Table 3 – DEMEAU MAR operation instructions (adapted from DEMEAU, 2013)

residence time between 3 and 12 months the maximum

Bezafibrate All aquifer conditions ensure &gt; 90% removal 

Carbamazepine Removal rates &gt;90% are only expected in aquifer with very 
long residence time (at least 6 months) and anaerobic

long residence time (at least 6 months) and anaerobic 
conditions or strictly anaerobic conditions (sulphate redox 
conditions) 

Trimethoprim All aquifer conditions ensure &gt;90% removal 

 

Concerning experiments directly correlated with SAT and removal of these substances, Abel 

(2014) concluded using soil-column experiments that phenacetin, paracetamol, ibuprofen and 

caffeine were easily removed under various operating conditions. Also, increased biological 

activity allowed for a substantial removal of gemfibrozil, diclofenac, pentoxifylline and 

bezafibrate from the primary effluent used, for periods of 240 days. 

Mansell et al. (2004), in soil-column experiments on silica sand showed that adsorption is the 

primary mechanism of removal for 17?-estradiol, estriol, and testosterone hormones studied, 

with removals of  79.3 ± 2.4%, 84.3 ± 14.6%, and 97.5 ± 1.7%, respectively. It was also 

observed that removal efficiencies were higher on soil containing a higher content of silt, clay 

and organic content, demonstrating that SAT is efficient in removing hormones present in 

reclaimed water. 

At infiltration basin scale, Life+ ENSAT project, tried to demonstrate the efficiency of a vegetal 

compost-made reactive organic layer. After a set of laboratory experiments this layer was 

applied at a full scale MAR system, where several pollutants reduction, usually present in 

recharge water, where taken into account to verify the suitability of the referred reactive layer 



19 

(ENSAT, 2012a). The project focused on recalcitrant compounds that resist to advanced 

treatment processes – organic micro pollutants. By adding organic matter to the reactive layer 

mixed with original soil (Figure 5) installed at the bottom of the pond, biodegradation as well 

as adsorption processes can be enhanced. 

 

Figure 5 – Scheme of the reactive layer (adapted from ENSAT (2012b)) 

Thirteen compounds where selected, including degradation products (8 pharmaceuticals, 4 

pesticides and 1 estrogenic compound) and some of them where in Directive 2008/105/EC. 

The substances and the effects suffered by application of a reactive layer are shown in Table 

4. 

Aqueous behaviour of these substances is highly dependent on their physicochemical 

properties, such as molecular weight, octanol-water partition coefficients, solubility and acid 

dissociation constant. These are key parameters to take into account when considering 

treatment (Caballero, 2010). Octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow) describesthehydrophobic 

(Kow&gt;2) or hydrophilic (Kow&lt;2) character of a given compound. This important property allows 

anticipating the tendency of a compound to adsorb onto suspended solids and sediment 

during infiltration. Hydrophilic compounds remains in aqueous phase due to its affinity with 

water. 

Acid dissociation constant (Ka) gives a measure of ability of an acid to donate protons to a 

respective base, the greater this values are the stronger the acid in the solution. These two 

parameters together are can give efficient information for estimating the fate of a compound 

in a system.

DEMEAU (2013) compiled information about the behaviour of some organic pollutants and 

also solubility and mobility information – Table 5. For example, carbamazepine can be 

retarded in the presence of soil organic matter based on laboratory results but field data seems 

to relate the removal with dilution processes. Retardation is governed by carbamazepine 

desorption kinetics from adsorbing sites. Ibuprofen is significantly retarded and biodegraded 

while diclofenac has a higher transformation in unsaturated conditions rather than under 

saturated conditions.

3. Study area characterization: São Bartolomeu de Messines 
In this section a general characterization of the study area will be presented, addressing 

regional geology to hydrogeological factors, water quality and some socioeconomic facts. 

 

3.1. Global characterization 

The study area is located in the northern limit of Querença – Silves aquifer system, situated 

in the Algarve region, south of Portugal (Figure 6). Geologically, this system is a karstic multi-

aquifer, with confined to unconfined layers, limited in the northern contact by Grés de Silves 

(sandstone) formation and, in the south, by Jurassic Callovian-Oxfordian-Kimmeridgian 

limestones and marls where the aquifer geological formations can have 270 m of thickness. 

Karstification is observed and is only developed to smaller depths, which locally can achieve 

200 m. This aquifer system has a complex geometry, reflected in the pattern of the surfacing 

geologic formations, resulting from the tectonic activity that compartmentalized the aquifer 

system in smaller subsystems with hydraulic connections between them that vary in rate of 

groundwater transferral (Almeida et al., 2000). 

 

Figure 6 – Location of Querença-Silves aquifer system 

 

Monteiro et al. (2006), Monteiro et al. (2007) and Reis et al. (2007) refer that, besides this 

complexity in the subsurface media, there is transference between subsystems induced by 

streams, that transfer water from the upstream subsystems to downstream subsystems by a 

succession of springs and areas of infiltration in the stream beds. Water flow does not occur 

exclusively underground, but there is also a superficial component of circulation and hydraulic 

connection between different sectors of the aquifer system. It’s possible to conclude that 

complex surface/groundwater relations are established, where streams (seasonal or not) 

frequently represent the hydraulic connection between sectors (or subsystems) that otherwise 

would function independently. Figure 7 represents the distribution of receptor (influent) and 

donator (effluent) sections of the main streams that pass through the aquifer. 



23 

 

Figure 7 – Influent (blue) and effluent (red) sections of the streams that pass through Querença – Silves 
aquifer system (adapted from Monteiro et al., 2006). 

 

The study area is situated near the zone of influence of Ribeiro Meirinho, a tributary of 

Alcantarilha stream. This stream upper reaches are located outside the aquifer, in Serra 

Algarvia and flows south throughout the central-western area of Querença-Silves aquifer. 

Serra Algarvia are Palaeozoic terrains, composed essentially by impervious lithologies, being 

the main source of water for this stream until it reaches the Jurassic calcareous formations 

composing the karst aquifer of Querença-Silves (Leitão et al., 2014). 

Reis et al. (2007) refers an influent behaviour in the upstream section of Ribeiro Meirinho and 

an effluent behaviour in the downstream area, where it suffers a severe flow reduction when 

it reaches the karstic formations, having several sinks located along its riverbed. Ribeiro 

Meirinho has no significant flow during most of the year and its watershed upstream from the 

northern limit of the aquifer system is of small dimension. This stream acts as an hydraulic 

passage and transfers water received from northern Palaeozoic formations by surface flow 

and/or possible subsurface flow from them to the aquifer system. 

Water availability in the region is low, and therefore, the importance of its preservation is clear 

(Leitão et al., 2014). The average annual recharge of Querença-Silves aquifer, for the period 

1941–1991, was estimated as 314 mm/year (Oliveira et al., 2008) and 294 mm/year for the 

period 1979–2009 (Oliveira 2011). 

 

3.2. Local characterization: SBM Wastewater treatment plant 

Considering the global characteristics referred in the previous section and the significant 

importance of the groundwater/surface water relations in the aquifer system, a set of infiltration 

basins was purposed for construction to improve the aquifer recharge that occurs naturally 

through Ribeiro Meirinho (Lobo Ferreira et al. 2013) by using the treated effluent from São 

Bartolomeu de Messines Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) in the upstream section of the 

aquifer system – Figure 8. This generally aims to increase availability by storing excess water 

in Querença-Silves aquifer during wet years, allowing for complementary response to the use 

of surface water reservoirs in case of long drought periods, assuring continuity in consumer 

supply. 



24 

 

Figure 8 – São Bartolomeu de Messines Wastewater Treatment Plant location 

 

São Bartolomeu de Messines Wastewater Treatment Plant (SBM WWTP) treated effluent is 

directly discharged to Ribeiro Meirinho. The objective of the infiltration basins is to improve 

wastewater quality through SAT processes, acting as a complementary treatment process. 

SBM WWTP is managed by Águas do Algarve (AdA), a Portuguese public enterprise, and 

was previously managed by local authority of Silves municipality. It receives mainly urban 

effluent for treatment from São Bartolomeu de Messines and serves an average of 4228 

inhabitants. The volume of wastewater treated is about 316891 m3/y (AdA and ERSAR, 2008). 

This infrastructure has secondary treatment and a disinfection process by ultraviolet radiation 

(UV) – Figure 9. UV disinfection (a good alternative to chemical disinfection), basically 

inactivates bacteria and viruses by exposing microorganisms to electromagnetic radiation that 

disrupts its genetic material and interferes with reproduction process (NRC, 1994). This 

process allows for the disinfection by-products resulting from transformation of chemical 

disinfection products to be greatly reduced. 



25 

 

Figure 9 – SBM WWTP UV treatment infrastructure 

 

After treatment, the water is directly discharged to Ribeiro Meirinho stream – Figure 10. 

 

Figure 10 – Point of discharge of SBM WWTP to Ribeiro Meirinho stream (blue line on the map) 



26 

Concerning water quality, this effluent shows expected variability. Data is from Águas do 

Algarve (AdA) from effluent monitoring, which control several parameters such as pH, COD, 

BOD, phosphates, nitrogen, chloride and E. coli, is frequently published. Graph 1 to Graph 4 

shows parameter concentration for the period of 2009 to 2014 for samples collected at point 

of discharge. Values are compared to the maximum acceptable concentrations for wastewater 

at discharge established (emission limit values - ELV) in Legislative Decree 236/98, except for 

Total Coliforms which reference value corresponds to maximum recommended value (MRV) 

for drinking waters. 

In Appendix 1 is the table showing the parameter concentrations for samples collected at point 

of discharge published by Águas do Algarve. 

From the collected data it’s possible to observe at Graph 1 that BOD and COD concentrations 

are often above the ELV, mainly during summer months, while Graph 2 shows that pH values 

for the considered period respects the ELV interval (6 to 9), without showing evidence of 

seasonal pattern. 

 

Graph 1 – BOD and COD concentration at SBM WWTP point of discharge 

 



27 

 

Graph 2 – pH at SBM WWTP point of discharge 

 

Graph 3 shows that N total is often above ELV at SBM WWTP point of discharge, with an 

evidence of seasonal effects with higher concentrations in the summer months, except for the 

year of 2013. P total show values below ELV except for March 2011. 

 

Graph 3 – Total nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations at SBM WWTP point of discharge 

 

Finally, Graph 4 presents the Total Coliforms (TC) and Total Suspended Solids. While the first 

parameter (TC) presents a concentration higher than MRV for certain periods of the year, it is 

very clear that TSS does not respect the ELV in most of the samples at point of discharge. 



28 

 

Graph 4 – Total suspended solids and total coliforms at SBM WWTP point of discharge 

 

This WWTP shows, for the selected period of available data some problems in the effluent 

treatment. Note that a comparison between the WWTP affluent and effluent parameter 

concentrations for the determination of elimination percentage is not possible due to affluent 

parameters concentration not being available. The Legislative Decree 152/97 refers that this 

comparison is to taken into account when determining the quality of effluent at discharge point. 

Also there is no available/published information for metals, total hydrocarbons or detergents, 

which are also referred in Legislative Decree 236/98 as control parameters for the effluent 

quality. 

Considering the type of effluent treated in São Bartolomeu de Messines WWTP, which is 

mainly urban, pharmaceuticals were considered in this study. As reported in Section 2.5, this 

type of contaminants is commonly found in wastewater. To understand, the extent of the 

problem in a small population, several wastewater analysis where conducted in different field 

campaigns in different conditions. Pharmaceuticals and other emergent substances are not 

monitored by Águas do Algarve. 

The first campaign was led in May of 2014, and several parameters where measured, 

including pharmaceuticals – Table 6. Sample analyses were conducted in an external 

laboratory and the measured pharmaceuticals correspond to a fixed set of compounds and 

where not pre-selected which include several types of these substances, from anti-

inflammatory to hormones. The remaining parameters measured were determined accordingly 

to Section 4.2.3 set of parameters considered and common in wastewater.

From the set of 32 parameters analysed in SBM WWTP effluent, only 8 where above LOR. 

Low values of nitrates, boron copper and zinc where detected and relatively high 

concentrations of sulphate and ammonia where measured. Concerning the pharmaceuticals 

only carbamazepine and caffeine where detected. The presence of these substances is 

coherent with what was presented in Section 2.5, especially with carbamazepine which shows 

small reduction after treatment and has a persistent behaviour. 

A second campaign was conducted in the end of September 2014 where data from the affluent 

was also collected. Again the set of pharmaceuticals considered in the analysis was defined 

by default in the external laboratory – 84 pharmaceuticals where considered in the effluent 

analysis. A new set of parameters were also considered, such as chloride, dissolved organic 

carbon (DOC), iron, potassium, magnesium, manganese, sodium, nickel, total phosphates, 

total phosphorous, cadmium, calcium, total hardness, total alkaline earth, arsenic, lead, 

chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD) and total soluble solids 

(TSS).

From the 25 parameters analysed in WWTP affluent, 19 showed values above LOR. In the 

treated effluent a total of 7 from 42 analysed parameters showed values below LOR. In 

pharmaceuticals, beta-sitosterol, iopromid and EDTA presented values of 10.6, 7 and 6.6 

nanograms per litre, when others stayed below 1 nanogram per litre. In total, from the 84 

pharmaceuticals considered, 17 where above LOR. COD and BOD concentrations seam 

coherent with published data from Águas do Algarve. Nitrogen elements show lower values 

than expected, considering the main stressors in the area (Leitão et al., 2014). 

Comparing WWTP inflow and outflow, ammonia, nitrite, chloride, sulphate, DOC, iron, 

magnesium, total phosphates and phosphorous, COD, BOD and TSS presented a reduction 

after treatment. Other parameters had the inverse behaviour with an increase of concentration 

on the outflow. 



31 

Appendix 2 presents all measured pharmaceuticals in the campaigns. Note that in Section 4 

other wastewater analysis results will be presented for SBM WWTP effluent, as this water was 

used in the laboratory soil-column and batch experiments. 

This WWTP serves an aging population, where accordingly to INE (2011) 28% of the 

population is in the age group of &gt;64 years old and 51.6% is in the age group of 25 to 64 years 

old. An aged population may be the main factor for the presence of unmetabolized 

pharmaceuticals in wastewater in this study area, where there is also a local healthcare unit. 

To date it is unknown if this units sewage is treated independently. 

Also, Algarve see its population increase significantly during Summer season because of its 

warm weather, so there may be a seasonal factor in the presence of pharmaceuticals in 

wastewater.

4. Laboratory experiments 
In this section, the laboratory experiments conducted are descript and the results are 

presented. In addition to the soil-column and batch experiments, soil granulometry, organic 

matter percentage, carbonate percentage, cation exchange capacity and clay type were also 

determined for the natural soil (results presented in section 4.3.1.1). Some parameters were 

also determined for soil mixture – results in section 4.3.2.1. 

 

4.1. Soil characterization methods 

Several experiments were conducted in LASUB for the determination of soil characteristics. 

The granulometric characterization of the soil was made following the procedure 

recommended in Norma E196 LNEC (1966). The soil was air dried and quarted to achieve a 

representative sample. After quarting and removal of the organic matter visible at naked eye, 

the soil was passed by the 0.063 mm in a washing process. The below 0.063 mm fraction 

(plus water) was collected in a cup and left to settle. After settle, this fraction was left to dry 

and was latter weighted. The above 0.063 mm fraction was dried at 40ºC to be, after drying, 

passed by another sieving process. The sample was inserted in the sieves tower composed 

of thirteen sieves with decreasing diameter of holes (4, 2.8, 2, 1.4, 1, 0.71, 0.5, 0.355, 0.25, 

0.18, 0.125, 0.09, 0.063 mm) from the top of the tower down to a catchment pan. This tower 

is installed in a vibrating plate. The sample was sieved for a period of 30 minutes. After that, 

the fraction retained in each sieve was collected and weighted. 

The granulometric analysis of the fine fraction (&lt;0.063 mm) of the soil was carried out with the 

use of laser diffraction instrument that consists of an optical unit, which collects the information 

from the scattered light when a laser is passed through the sample, determining the size of 

the particles in the sample. The procedure consists of dispersing the fine fraction in water that 

will pass by the system. 

Organic matter (OM) percentage was determined by incineration of this fraction in the ceramic 

oven at 600ºC. By comparing the weight of sample before and after incineration, this 

percentage was calculated. 

Carbonates percentage followed a similar method, as the sample was mixed with a strong 

acid (HCl) to destroy the carbonated fraction of the soil. After soil-acid mixture the sample was 

left to settle and the pH in the soil solution was measured (Figure 11). Deionized water was 

added to the soil solution until the acid neutralization. When neutralization was achieved the 

samples were dried and weighted. The comparison of the soil weigh before and after this 

process allowed for the determination of carbonates percentage. 



33 

 

Figure 11 – pH determination previous to soil neutralization procedure 

 

Soil clay minerals composition was also determined in LNEC laboratories by difractogram. 

This process follows the Norma E403 LNEC (1993), where two difractograms are carried out 

in the fine fraction (&lt;0.063 mm) of soil sample, one to verify the presence of expanding clays 

(montmorillonite) and the other in a fraction heated up to 550ºC degrees for 30 minutes for 

kaolinite identification. 

Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) was also determined in an external laboratory. This intrinsic 

property of the soil material describes the total number of exchangeable cation charges (Hillel, 

1998). It’s usually expressed in miliequivalents of cations per 100 grams of soil and depends 

not only on clay content but also on clay type. The cation exchange phenomenon affects the 

movement and retention of ions in the soil as well as flocculation-dispersion processes of soil 

colloids. pH together with CEC are very important for prediction of soil sorption capacity 

(Barbosa, 1999). 

Porosity was determined by two similar procedures: in a simple process by saturating dry soil 

samples (cf. Figure 12) and from the saturated volume during soil-column experiments. The 

first process consisted in weighting three dry soil samples (and cups), adding water to the 

sample top and weight again. This simply allowed of the determination of the volume that was 

retained in pores, which corresponds to the porosity. 

 

Figure 12 – Simple experiment for density determination  

Soil porosity was also determined in these experiments using the following equation: 

? =  ??/ ?? ? ??? (%) 

 



34 

where Vw is the volume of water in the soil sample (cm
3) 

Vt is the total volume of the sample (cm
3) 

 

Soil bulk density (?b) (g/cm
3) was determined by the following equation: 

??  =  ??/?? 
 

where Wd is the weight of the dried soil sample (g). 

 

4.2. Soil-column experiments methodologies and methods 

A soil-column is characterized as a discrete block of soil inserted in a column that is located 

either outdoors or in a laboratory, allowing the control and measurement of the infiltration, as 

well as incorporating equipment for the total recovery of the effluent. This is usually achieved 

by encasing the soil column in a rigid and impermeable shell material, both for structural 

reasons and to prevent fluid loss (Lewis and Sjöstrom, 2010). 

A set of soil-column experiments were conducted using both natural soil and soil mixture. The 

following sections describe the methodologies and results achieved. 

 

4.2.1. Apparatus description 

The soil-column experimental apparatus consists of an acrylic transparent column with 30 cm 

height and 5 cm diameter (Figure 13) and/or an acrylic column with 50 cm height with a similar 

diameter, which allowed the existence of a controlled height of water on the top of the soil, 

simulating the conditions of real scale infiltration basins. 30 cm column was only used in initial 

soil-column experiments. Following DEMEAU (2015), this material is rigid to ensure structural 

strength, inert to avoid chemical interference (this is particularly important when analysing 

emergent contaminants), transparent to facilitate visual observations of events, impermeable, 

and resistant to corrosion. 

The soil-column is attached to a compaction system composed of a standardized weight disk 

for soil compaction and a ruler for dropping height determination. All columns have a tight lid 

base with an outlet port which is connected to a sample tube where the outflow water is 

collected. An inert Teflon membrane filter is added to the soil-column bottom for fine particles 

retention. 



35 

 

Figure 13 – Soil-column experimental apparatus designed and built at LNEC 

 

For continuous water injection, a volumetric peristaltic pump was used. This peristaltic pump 

has a pulse volume of 3 mL and time between pulses can be adjusted. Minimum time (1s) 

results in a non-stop pulse making injection continuous. For pulse injection, the water was 

directly poured from a container to the column (Figure 14). 

 

Figure 14 – Soil-column apparatus and diagram of operation 

 



36 

The injection from the wastewater/deionized water reservoir to the pump and from the pump 

to the column was made by PE tubes. When in contact with wastewater the tube was not used 

in any other experiments to avoid sample contamination. This is very important considering 

that pharmaceuticals occur in very small concentrations (nanograms per litre). The use of 

silicone tubes was discarded to avoid compound loss by reaction to tubing sections. 

Outflow samples were collected at defined periods in glass graded tubes. These samples can 

be conditioned in dark glass vials or bottles and keep in the fridge (&lt;4ºC) for future analysis 

or ultimately destroyed (if the purpose is to only characterize hydraulic behaviour of the soil). 

Water naturally flows from the bottom outlet to the sample tubes. 

 

4.2.2. Soil and wastewater sampling procedure and experiment preparation 

4.2.2.1. Soil-column preparation 

Soil samples were collected at the approximate location of the infiltration site in the outskirts 

of SB Messines wastewater treatment plant, removing the most superficial layer, and 

collecting soil from a depth of 5 to 20 cm. The soil was dried at 40°C, the large organic matter 

(roots, leaves, etc.) was manually removed; afterwards it was quartered and split in equal 

portions to be representative of the site soil. 

The soil-column experiments were performed in a soil subject to a dry pack procedure. The 

objective of packing is to produce a homogeneous soil column having a bulk density similar to 

that observed naturally, while avoiding the formation of preferential flow pathways. This might 

be the most critical issue associated with soil-column experiments (Lewis and Sjöstrom, 2010), 

since these preferential flow paths will result in spatial heterogeneity in flux and solutes 

transport, and will significantly bias any experimental results. 

Dry or damp packing involves loading small discrete amounts or “lifts” of dry or damp soil into 

the column and then mechanically packing it either by hand or with some type of ram or pestle 

(Lewis and Sjöstrom, 2010). After the column assembling and the Teflon filter correctly 

positioned at the bottom end section, the soil-column was filled with the soil following the 

CEN/Technical Specification 14405 (2004): fill the column in 5 cm soil sections packing each 

section with the weight, dropping it three times over a 20 cm height above it. In this process 

the whole surface should be covered with the weight disk after three drops for maximum 

regularization. The surface was then scarified before addition of another 5 cm layer. The 

process was repeated until the column was completely filled. The soil-column was then 

weighted. This compaction method was applied to all soil-columns except Column 5, where 

the number of weight drops was reduced to two instead of three. 

As stated above, the removal of roots, leaves and big sized organic will help, after compaction, 

to decrease the probability of macropore flow to occur. This phenomenon refers to any 

preferential flow due to heterogeneities within the porous medium, including cracks, root holes, 

wormholes and macropores.

4.2.2.2. Wastewater sampling 

Wastewater effluent samples were collected in the SBM WWTP point of discharge. In-situ 

parameters were measured and samples for analysis were collected in 1L dark glass bottles 

for pharmaceuticals and 40 mL dark glass vials for other parameters analysis. For injection in 

soil-column experiments, different campaigns for collecting the necessary water were 

conducted. This water was collected and transported to LASUB in a large 25L container, 

where it was fractioned in several smaller glass containers. 

As stated before, both samples collected from SBM WWTP effluent and from the columns 

bottom outlet are stored in chilled environment to prevent alteration (&lt;4°C) until analysis. ECs 

are potentially sensitive to UV radiation, so dark glass bottles were used to prevent photo 

degradation, particularly for pharmaceuticals analysis (DEMEAU, 2015). 

The outflow samples were collected once the volume necessary for analysis was achieved, 

except for pharmaceuticals. Due to the large volume necessary (which corresponded to 

several pore-volumes to every column) and the time needed to achieve it, the samples 

collected for pharmaceuticals where kept in totalizer bottles. This means that the 

pharmaceuticals samples were related to an extended period of time, being this the main 

reason for the smaller number of samples for pharmaceuticals compared to the other 

parameters. The totalizer bottles were also kept in refrigerated conditions. 

 

4.2.2.3. Natural soil used 

To correctly define the soil parameters and to recreate/model different functioning conditions, 

several soil-column experiments were conducted using the same natural soil subject to altered 

methods of packing, water matrix, soil thickness and granulometry, time of experiment, 

injection and saturation conditions. Table 8 presents a synthesis of the operating details of the 

soil-column experiments conducted in the natural soil. Uncertainty factors are also taken into 

account and are briefly discussed in Section 6.1.

In total, five soil-column experiments were conducted using natural soil, named Column 1 to 

Column 5. In all experiments the soil used had the same volume, corresponding to 30 cm 

height and 5 cm diameter, except for Column 3 where the height was 20 cm. 

For Column 2 to 4 the soil, which has the tendency to form clay aggregates, was disaggregated 

in a mortar and then sieved, having the particles larger than 2 mm being excluded from the 

column filling sample – as stated in Section 4.3.1.1, 84.1% of SBM soil particles are below 2 

mm size. Accordingly to Hillel (1998), large rocks in soil do not behave like soil, and if 

numerous large rocks occur this might affect the behaviour of soil. For such high composition 

in sand in SBM soil, being the most representative fraction, it’s advisable to take larger 

fractions (gravel). This also allowed for the reduction of possible air pockets (that could result 

in preferential flow paths) with better particle rearrangement inside the column. 

 

Figure 15 – Clay aggregates in natural soil at SB Messines 



39 

In the top section of Columns 4 and 5 a non-reactive permeable layer was used to ensure an 

equal distribution of the input water and minimum disturbance of the first layer of soil during 

the water injection, also preventing an early clogging process. This layer was composed of 

Fontainebleu quartz white sand with an approximate thickness of 0.5 cm. 

For all five soil-column experiments the soil was completely saturated with deionized water 

from bottom to top for about 16 hours allowing the reduction of air-pockets inside the soil – 

Figure 16. This saturation process can mainly prevent fingering phenomena, which refers to 

the preferential flow taking place as a result of the wetting front instability, and by a number of 

reasons, includes changes in hydraulic conductivity with depth and compression of air ahead 

of the wetting front. Fingering is most likely to occur in soils that are predominantly sandy and 

that are initially extremely dry (DEMEAU, 2015). 

 

 

Figure 16 – Saturation process from the column bottom (Column 1) 

Concerning the injection method for the experiment, after saturation, all columns except 

Column 5 have started with continuous flow from the top using an automatic peristaltic pump. 

Column 4 experiments started with continuous flow until the end of the first day, and the 

injection method was switched to pulse injection. Column 5 started with pulse injection of 

approximately 378 mL of deionized water, filling the 20 cm top of the column,  

Column 1 and 2 have used deionized water for all experiment time length while the other 

columns added SBM WWTP effluent water injected. Column 3 experiment, started with 

continuous deionized water injection and it was switched to wastewater after 30 minutes. In 

column 4 only wastewater was used, while column 5 add 2 cycles of deionized water between 

2 wastewater injection cycles. 

Following DEMEAU (2015), the transparent parts of the setup were wrapped in aluminium foil 

to simulate non-light conditions encountered in the subsurface, and to reduce photolithotrophic 

microorganisms growth of and photodegradation of contaminants - Figure 17. 



40 

 

Figure 17 – Transparent parts of the column covered with tinfoil paper 

 

The experiments were held in different time periods, from a few hours (Column 2) to several 

days (Column 3, 4 and 5). For Columns 4 and 5 an unsaturation period was considered after 

every injection period in order to recreate the field conditions for contaminant degradation 

enhancement through oxygenation process. The different experiments aimed to assess the 

importance that compaction procedures, saturation-desaturation and infiltration water quality 

can have in the flow rate of the same soil, also for different time periods. 

 

4.2.2.4. Soil mixture used 

Considering the interesting results of project ENSAT (Section 2.5) that used a reactive layer 

installed in the bottom of the SAT-MAR infiltration basin, as well as the results obtained from 

the soil-column experiments using the natural soil, it was decided that a similar approach could 

be taken into account in Portugal MARSOL DEMO site of Querença-Silves. Following Section 

1.3 objectives, a reactive layer was created by the mixture of different materials. The quality 

of the outflow water and hydraulic behaviour of both the natural soil and the soil mixture were 

compared and will be taken into account in the selection of the best material to be used in the 

infiltration basins. 

Concerning the materials to be used, several options were considered. The main factors for 

the selection were essentially that those materials were cheap and easily available (if possible, 

wastes resulting from agricultural, recycling or industrial processes), that do not represent risks 

for the environment, and that can be easily handled during the construction process. It was 

taken into account that the materials should be collected near or from the area of the 

installation, which would greatly reduce the transportation cost. 



41 

After a brief literature review and a set of personal contacts, the list of possible materials was 

widened. Several initially considered were later excluded for several factors. An example of 

these materials is cork, carob (“alfarroba”) and almond external bark. Cork showed itself a not 

so good material for contaminant retention given its hydrophobic and impermeable behaviour, 

as presented by Pintor et al. (2012). Also due to its density cork particles tend to fluctuate 

making it very hard to install in the bottom of infiltration basins. Finally, this material is not 

cheap. 

Carob is easily available on Algarve. Unfortunately the carob external skin also shown signs 

of hydrophobic behaviour as well as it tend to rapidly rot and moulder when in continuous 

contact with water, which would greatly decrease the lifespan of the reactive layer. Also due 

to its constitution benefits to human health, carob has seen a price increase, being increasingly 

used in flour/food production besides other industrial and agricultural uses. 

Almond external bark, which may have been a good material for mixture with the soil, was not 

tested since it did not comply with the factors stated above: this material is neither cheap nor 

easily available in the study area, mainly because, due to its calorific power it is commonly 

used in industrial ovens or households heating systems. Secondly, although almond trees are 

very common in Algarve, the business of almond has seen a decrease in value due to the 

more accessible prices in emergent markets. Because of this, almond trees are being replaced 

by orange trees and other more valuable cultures in the last years. 

Other options had to be taken into account. Following ENSAT (2012) method and considering 

that upper soil layers with the higher organic matter content have the potential to accumulate 

some pharmaceuticals such as carbamazepine during flooding/drainage cycles (Arye et al., 

2011), an organic soil was selected. A commercial organic soil was acquired for the 

experiments. Special attention was taken to its composition as the most common use of 

commercial organic soil is plants fertilization. The acquired organic soil has an organic matter 

percentage above 70% and it’s composed by 70% humus resulting from natural composting 

and 25% peat. The remaining percentage is fine sand. Given that peat tends to present high 

porosities (Walczak et al., 2002) better performance is to be expected in soil oxygenation. 

In fact, a large percentage of organic matter can greatly contribute to the increase of biological 

activity and therefore the chances of biodegradation processes to occur as it has a supply of 

dissolved organic carbon. 

Another factor that had to be taken into account was the hydraulic behaviour – although time 

of contact is essential for contaminant retention, it is also important that this reactive layer 

does not behave as a cap layer. This would result in very long periods of ponding which would 

possibly create other problems in the area of infiltration. 

To increase the soil mixture permeability an “artificial sand” was selected. Basically, this 

component results from the industrial extraction of inert materials for construction, more 

specifically limestone, common in Algarve. This “artificial sand” results from the crushing of 

limestone into specified particle sizes for different uses. It’s easily available in the study area. 

The selected particle size, available to sell, was 0-2 mm. 

In a soil mixture this material will help to increase the sand fraction and also the porosity, 

allowing for infiltration and also for the reactive layer to “breathe” in the unsaturated periods. 



42 

The fact that this artificial sand is composed of crushed limestone can have another benefit, 

mainly in the quality improvement aspect. Crushing allowed for a larger reactive surface to be 

available in each grain which facilitates surface retention and cationic exchange processes. 

Also, as limestone can present large concentrations of calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg), 

cationic exchange and retention processes can be enhanced by the substitution in rock matrix 

of Ca and Mg. Ca and Mg displacement as a result of cation exchange processes can result 

in fixation of other elements such as heavy metals (Barbosa, 1999). 

 

Figure 18 – Different soil mixture components (artificial sand – left cup; natural soil (disaggregated and 
sieved) – middle cup; organic soil – right cup) 

 

The mixing process was relatively simple: taking into account the material percentage to be 

considered in each mixture, each fraction was weighted in the defined proportions and added. 

This bulk compound was then hand mixed for the sample to be the most homogeneous as 

possible. The mixture was then packed into the column following the procedure explained at 

Section 4.2.2.3. 

The choice of having a soil mixture of different materials instead of having layers of each 

selected material inserted into the column, aims to decrease uncertainty factors related to 

water flow inside the column: the creation of different layers inside can create hydraulic 

barriers with different behaviour that can hinder the water flow, and create preferential ways 

or even ponding or retention in certain parts of the column. The homogeneous soil mixture 

along the column avoids changes in flow behaviour from top to bottom, making it as regular 

as possible, which is easier to reproduce and numerically model. The soil mixture as a whole 

can insure that the behaviour along the column concerning quality factors is also the same. It 

is also very difficult to reproduce this layering process at the basin scale. 

To firstly understand the hydraulic behaviour of the soil mixture, several soil-column 

experiments with different materials percentages in composition were conducted, as 

demonstrated in Figure 19 – Column 6 to Column 7. 



43 

 

Figure 19 – Soil composition in conducted soil-column experiments 

 

Column 6 had a composition of 60% of natural soil and 40% of organic soil while Column 7 

had 40% of natural soil, 30% of organic soil and 30% of artificial sand. These two soil-column 

experiments were conducted at the same time, and allowed to understand the effect of artificial 

sand presence in the hydraulic behaviour. 

In Column 8 and Column 9, both with same soil mixture composition, a smaller percentage in 

weight of vegetal compound was used. The causes for the change in composition are 

discussed in Section 4.3.2.2. 

Quality parameters where only measured in these two last columns, after measuring that a 

good hydraulic behaviour has been achieved. The purpose of this remains with the fact that 

large quantities of volume is needed for pharmaceuticals analysis (approximately 1 L) – having 

two columns with same soil composition working in parallel, assembled with equal packing 

and injection methods, volumes and water matrix, can be understood as being the same 

column. So, Column 9 outflow water was collected exclusively for pharmaceuticals analysis 

while Column 8 outflow water was used to analyse all the other parameters. 

The details concerning the four soil-column experiments conducted in different soil mixtures 

are summarized in Table 9.

4.2.3. Parameters selected for quality analysis 

Considering that wastewater matrix can be very different for each WWTP (given certain factors 

such number of population served, age of population, seasonal effects, etc.) the parameters 

to be analysed in the soil-column inflow and outflow had to be handpicked specifically. 

In-situ parameters such as pH, Eh, temperature and electrical conductivity were measured in 

wastewater prior to each injection pulse (Column 4 to Column 5) and during the experiments 

in each sample collected in the column outflow. 

Considering the parameters for chemical analysis, three “tracers” that commonly occur in 

wastewater where selected due it its stability in aqueous media – boron, copper and zinc, and 

to their presence in the groundwater downgradient the SBM WWTP rejection point (Leitão et 

al., 2014). 



45 

Another component which is fundamental, not only to characterize the wastewater matrix but 

also to understand the processes that occur inside the column and the success of soil as 

filtering layer is nitrogen. Nitrogen cycle offers good information about the conditions inside 

the column. Therefore, nitrates, nitrites and ammonia were determined. Also, phosphorous is 

an important component in this type of water, so phosphates were considered in the analysis. 

Complementary information was also collected on sulphates. 

Concerning the pharmaceuticals, and given the knowledge achieved in Section 2.5, special 

attention was given to those that are prevalent in wastewater effluent, such as bezafibrate, 

carbamazepine, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, naproxen and propranolol. The characteristics of 

these compounds are presented in Table 10. All pharmaceuticals examined are presented in 

the following results sections (4.3.1.3).

After Column 3 experiment was finished, and as it was a “learn as we go” process, it was 

decided to expand the number of parameters to be analysed. This way the maximum quantity 

information would be collected, and processes inside the column could be understood. So, in 

addition with other previously described measured parameters, the following set was 

considered – Table 11.

In the pharmaceuticals results, from the 24 parameters analysed, 14 were above LOR for 

Column 4 and Column 5 inflow, while for Column 8 and Column 9, nine parameters were 

above LOR. The first set (Column 4 and Column 5) presents, in general, higher concentrations 

in detected compounds (above LOR) when compared to the second (Column 8 and Column 

9), except for Carbamazepine and Gemfibrozil. Inflow water parameters concerning 

pharmaceuticals where not determined for Column 3. 

This set of information will be used for column outflow concentration comparison in Section 

4.3.1.3 (natural soil) and Section 4.3.2.3 (soil mixture). 

 

4.3. Soil-column experiments results 

In this section the main results of all the experiments conducted will be presented, for both 

natural soil and soil mixture. 

 

4.3.1. Natural soil 

Below are presented the overall soil-column experiment and characterization data for the São 

Bartolomeu de Messines natural soil. 

 



49 

4.3.1.1. Soil characteristics 

In this section the results are presented accordingly to the methods that were explained in 

Section 4.1. 

Granulometry analysis allowed to determine that SBM natural soil is mainly composed of sand 

(81.91%) with a small fraction of silt (15.95%) and clay (2.14%). The granulometric curve is 

presented in Graph 5. Representing these results in the textural triangle, this soil is classified 

as a Loamy Sand. 

This data will be fundamental in numerical modelling (Section 5). 

 

Graph 5 – Granulometric curve for SBM natural soil

Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) and soil solution pH results are presented in Table 14. 



50 

Table 14 – Natural soil CEC and pH results (d – Bascomb method) 

pH CEC d (cmol/kg of soil) 

8.90 5.74 

 

The SBM natural soil presents a typical loamy sand CEC value (between 5 and 10 cmol/kg of 

soil2) and high alkalinity. High alkalinity (or alkali) soils may result from high concentrations of 

CaCO3 resulting from limestone weathering, which is expected in this area given that the most 

common lithology is limestone (see Section 3). These soils are often incipient and present low 

permeability3. 

Concerning mineral composition, the sample of SBM natural soil presented the following

The relatively large percentage of carbonates determined in soil composition (24.02%) is 

coherent with the information above. It also presents a low organic matter percentage (2.66%), 

which was expected given the low CEC value. 

Bulk density and porosity, determined by the two methods presented in Section 4.1, are 

presented in Table 15 and Table 16. Table 15 also presents humidity percentage in soil.

SBM soil presents a slightly high percentage of retained water in its composition (17.15%). 

This may be related with silt/clay fraction. 

Concerning porosity, the soil presents a relatively large porosity percentage, typical of sands4. 

Obtained values are similar in both methods, but slightly higher in soil-column experiments 

(average – 43.6%) (average of simple method – 39.7%). 

Average bulk density determined from simple method is 1.11 g/cm3 while slightly higher values 

are again observed in the soil-column experiments (average of 1.44 g/cm3). This difference 

may be associated with packing method that is applied only to soil-column experiments. In 

simple method the soil samples were only poured to the container without any packing 

method, therefore the lower bulk density. Besides these disparities between methods, these 

values are acceptable for fine loamy sand (Domenico and Schwartz, 1998; Lewis and 

Sjöstrom, 2010) – Table 17.

4.3.1.2. Soil hydraulic behaviour 

Soil hydraulic behaviour was analysed taking into account the column outlet flow rates, and 

consequently permeability, for all soil-column experiments conducted using SBM natural soil. 

The main results are summarized in Table 18. Flow rate and permeability results are 

presented as average for two periods of time – average obtained at first day of experiment 

(Day 1 line) and average obtained for all the experiment time length (Experiment time line).

Concerning the calculated pore-volume for each column, similar values were obtained for each 

column (considering that the pore-volume for column 3, with 20 cm, is 173.2 mL × 3/2 is 259.8 

mL) – for a 30 cm soil layer in a 5 cm diameter column an average pore-volume of 261.16 mL. 

The slightly above average pore-volume obtained for Column 1 experiment may result from 

the fact that the soil was not sieved nor disaggregated, which created a large number of 

cavities due to the large granulometric heterogeneity (Figure 22). 

 

Figure 22 – Detail of Column 1 (unsaturated) 

 

As previously stated, column experiments were conducted through different time periods, from 

several hours (Column 2) to 1 month (Column 4). This allowed the observation of the flow rate 

variation though time in different levels of detail. 

Having as reference the column behaviour for 1 day, it’s possible to observe several variations 

throughout the five columns (Table 18). Column 4 presents the worst result at the end of this 

period in terms of flow rate (0.363 cm3/min) and permeability (0.589 m/d). On the other hand, 

Column 5 presented the best results, with a flow rate and permeability four times larger than 



53 

in Column 4. It can be assumed that these discrepancies are a direct result from the 

assembling and packing methods as described in Section 4.2.1, Table 8, given that Column 5 

packing only took 2 strikes instead of 3 in Column 4 and the first cycles used deionized water 

(= lower biological and organic content therefore lower possibility for clogging) instead of 

wastewater. 

If a linear behaviour is considered by observing this parameters for all the time of the 

experiment is possible to see that it tends to decrease through time – Flow rate of experiment 

at C1 (0.846 cm3/min), C2 (1.457 cm3/min) and C3 (0.789 cm3/min) where the longest is C3 

and the shortest is C2. 

The evolution of flow rate through time in the five soil-column experiments is presented in 

detail for 1.4 days in Graph 6, and for the whole time length of the experiment and pore-volume 

in Graph 7 and Graph 8, respectively. 

Flow rate tends to naturally decrease over time, mainly in the first 2.4 to 4.8 hours (0.1 to 0.2 

days). After this period, the flow rate continues to decrease but not so fast. It is also observed 

that flow rate and velocity keep decreasing over time at slightly lower rates. The lower flow 

rates were observed for column 4 (0.04 cm3/min) at the end of 4th cycle of 

saturation/unsaturation, and completely clogged at the end of 33 day of functioning. However, 

at every injection pulse, the flow rate temporarily increases, due to the increase of the water 

hydraulic gradient above the soil top. This is most noticeable in Column 5, that runs for 16 

days with 9 saturation/unsaturation cycles (due to its higher permeability), but the last 

measured flow rates were 0.006 cm3/min, before experiment was stopped. 

Ponding above soil top was also longer as permeability decreased and time between cycles 

increased.

54 

 

Graph 7 – Natural soil hydraulic behaviour (Time vs Flow rate) – 35 days 



55 

 

Graph 8 - Natural soil hydraulic behaviour (Pore-volume vs Flow rate) 



56 

Considering pore-volume units (Graph 8) it is possible to observe that flow rate decreases 

noticeably at 1 to 2 pore-volumes (0.5 in Column 4), and tend to achieve the lowest values at 

14 pore-volumes (equivalent to approximately 3500 mL) (11 pore-volumes in Column 4). 

As stated previously, clogging processes occurred inside the columns. The large organic and 

biological load of wastewater will result in the formation of biofilms on the top of the column 

and in biological activity will be more important inside the column itself - Figure 23. Although 

the main consequence is a decrease of soil permeability, it can be a positive aspect in 

biodegrading some contaminants. 

 

Figure 23 – Biofilm with equal daily cycle in infiltrating water above soil top (Column 4) (left) and 
biological activity inside the soil column (Column 5) (right) 

 

These clogging processes, which are uniquely distributed along the column can create a 

blockage to water flow at the top section of the column while the bottom section (which has a 

free flow outlet) continuously desaturates. This can result in different environments inside the 

column, with lower oxygen on the top and higher on the bottom. 

 

4.3.1.3. Inflow/outflow results comparison 

Soil-column experiment inflow and outflow samples for the SBM natural soil are synthetized 

in this section. The results were divided into subsections given the type of parameter 

considered – metals, nitrogen cycle components, major ions and pharmaceuticals. Other 

parameters that were measured in the outflow in LASUB such as pH, Eh and electrical 

conductivity are also presented. 

 



57 

4.3.1.3.1. Metals 

Metals and metalloids inflow and outflow concentration are presented in Graph 9 to Graph 14 

for all three columns (C3, C4 and C5). Considering the large difference in terms of magnitude 

between these and phosphorous and manganese, they are presented in separate graphs – 

Column 3 (Graph 10), Column 4 (Graph 12) and Column 5 (Graph 14). It’s important to refer 

that other metals were analysed but only those with values above LOR are presented. 

 

Graph 9 – Metals inflow/outflow concentration in Column 3 

 

Concerning the first set of metals for Column 3 (aluminium, barium, boron, copper, iron, 

molybdenum, nickel, vanadium and zinc), inflow water (IN) shows that boron and barium are 

present in the higher concentration. In the first outflow sample (S1), copper, aluminium, iron, 

barium and boron show concentrations above those measured in inflow water (IN). This is 

probably the result of the osmosis and desorption processes resulting from the contact 

between the soil and the distilled water used for the initial saturation. Besides barium and 

boron, which are present in higher concentrations throughout all the experiment, all remaining 

elements show the soil high capacity to retain them for the period of the experiment, 

considering that they are continuously being fed in the input WW. Assuming that no significant 

reactions occurred in inflow water since the time of sample in SBM WWTP until time of 

injection, the presence of B and Ba may be the result of continuous soil washing out, showing 

that barium and boron are very conservative under the existing conditions and maybe also a 

part of the soil chemical composition itself (since values are higher than the inflow water). This 

is consistent with the presence of B and Ba measured in the groundwater downgradient the 

WWTP discharge (cf. Leitão et al., 2014). 



58 

Alloway (1990) referred, from experiments with zinc and iron (two other metals present in the 

inflow water), in a clay soil with organic matter at different pH values, that these metals are 

more strongly adsorbed to alkaline soils. Given the characteristics of the soil and its 

composition in bentonite, illite and kaolinite, zinc reduction at outflow can be explained by 

adsorption at the exchange sites or entrapment in clay lattice. 

Phosphorous and manganese are other two elements present in the Column 3 inflow water 

(IN), the first in higher concentration (approximately 5 mg/L) (Graph 10). The first sample (S1) 

shows that both elements have lower concentration than the inflow, but a trend of increasing 

in concentration detected on the following samples, although the measured maximum values 

in outflow are approximately 1/9 of initial concentration for phosphorous. Manganese outflow 

values are higher than inflow after S9 with increasing trend, corresponding to the soil 

saturation after approximately 10 pore-volumes. 

 

Graph 10 – Manganese and phosphorus inflow/outflow concentration in Column 3 

 

Column 4 metals (excluding phosphorous and manganese) in inflow water (IN) show, similarly 

to C3, that boron, barium and iron are common in this water matrix. All outflow samples show 

higher concentrations for these elements, except iron. At outflow boron presents almost 3 

times the inflow concentration while barium has 10 times the inflow concentration, both with 

increasing trends until outflow sample 2 and oscillating behaviour after that. Aluminium and 

molybdenum (which has a below LOR value at inflow) show higher concentration in the first 

outflow sample but the values remain more or less stable throughout the experiment.  



59 

 

Graph 11 – Metals inflow/outflow concentration in Column 4 

 

Graph 12 – Manganese and phosphorus inflow/outflow concentration in Column 4 

Concerning manganese and phosphorus, the behaviour is very similar to Column 3. 

Phosphorus outflow concentration is much smaller than inflow and shows an oscillating 

behaviour, while manganese shows lower outflow concentration at the first until sample five 

and from there a trend to increasing concentration, higher than inflow due to soil saturation. 



60 

Column 5 inflow water present similar results than Column 4, being boron, barium and iron 

the noticeable concentrations. Outflow samples also present higher concentrations for boron 

and barium, although the second element shows a decrease between Sample 1 and 

Sample 2. Besides this, the number of samples does not allow for establishing a trend. Nickel 

shows higher concentration in both outflow samples when compared to inflow. Molybdenum 

is not presented as none of the samples (both inflow and outflow) are above LOR. 

 

Graph 13 – Metals inflow/outflow concentration in Column 5 



61 

 

Graph 14 – Manganese and phosphorus inflow/outflow concentration in Column 5 

Column 5 outflow results for manganese and phosphorous again show similar behaviour to 

Column 4, as phosphorous decreases in outflow and manganese presents higher outflow 

concentration when compared with inflow. Soil washing out may be the cause for this 

behaviour. 

Given the inflow water matrix (wastewater), a particular attention was given to three metals 

that may be considered tracers and common – boron, copper and zinc. Concentration 

variations along the experiment for these elements are presented in terms of natural soil pore-

volume units in Graph 15 to Graph 17. 

Boron conservative behaviour is observed in detail, particularly in Column 3 where 

concentration at outflow remains very stable along al the experiment (although oscillating), 

and approximately the same as inflow (Graph 15). Column 4 and Column 5 both present 

higher concentrations of boron at outflow, but similar values. Saturation and non-saturation 

conditions show no effect on B concentration. 



62 

 

Graph 15 - Boron vs pore-volume (natural soil) 

 

Copper is show similar behaviour between Column 3 and Column 4 (Graph 16), with an 

increase of concentration at outflow between the first and second pore-volume and a steady 

decrease after that, suggesting a soil washing out process for this element, which origin is due 

to the soil composition and not to the WW. Column 5 number of samples does not allow for 

any complex conclusions other than that in pore-volume (PV) 9 and PV14 copper 

concentrations is still at higher concentrations than the inflow. The slow decrease in 

concentration at outflow can be explained by the fact that Cu is specifically adsorbed by soil 

at relatively slow rates (Alloway, 1990), being the retention process very ineffective on the first 

stages of the experiments. 



63 

 

Graph 16 – Copper vs Pore-volume (natural soil) 

 

Finally zinc show an oscillating behaviour along C3 experiment with values always below 

injection concentration. Column 4 shows an irregular behaviour, with zinc concentration 

increasing irregularly after experiment start and PV2-3 and an outflow concentration below 

inflow at PV3. Again C5 results only allow establishing that at PV 9 and PV14 values of zinc 

are below inflow concentration in similar behaviour to C3 results. 

 

Graph 17 – Zinc vs Pore-volume (natural soil) 



64 

4.3.1.3.2. Nitrogen cycle 

The results of ammonia, nitrites and nitrates concentrations are presented for Column 3, 

Column 4 and Column 5 in Graph 18, Graph 19 and Graph 20, respectively. 

 

Graph 18 – Nitrogen cycle components concentration in Column 3 inflow/outflow 

 

Column 3 outflow results show an increase in ammonia concentration (although smaller than 

inflow concentration) along the time the experiment was conducted, while nitrites show an 

increase on S1 and S2 and a continuous decrease in the next samples. Nitrates also show a 

higher concentration at S1 when compared to inflow (IN) but the concentration decreases in 

S2 and S3 until below LOR. In this case, a degradation of ammonia into nitrites and nitrates 

seem to have occurred in the column, although the total nitrogen at inflow is higher than the 

measured nitrogen at outflow. 

The trend of increasing ammonia in the outflow may have resulted from the fact that 

continuous injection on Column 3 did not allowed for the column to achieve an aerobic 

environment, resulting in the formation or non-degradation of injected ammonia. 



65 

 

Graph 19 – Nitrogen cycle components concentration in Column 4 inflow/outflow 

 

Column 4 inflow sample show similar composition to Column 3, as ammonia is the 

predominant compound in the nitrogen cycle. Nitrites and nitrates are in this inflow sample 

below LOR. After experiment start it’s noticeable that ammonia has a very small concentration 

at OUT sample 1 when compared to inflow, but shows in the following outflow samples a trend 

for increase. Concerning nitrites, although concentration at outflow is higher than inflow 

between outflow samples 1 to 3 with an increasing trend, in outflow sample 4 and the next the 

values highly decrease (from 18.6 mg/L in sample 3 to 0.0413 mg/L in sample 4). A similar 

behaviour is verified for nitrates concentration, with a peak at outflow sample 2 followed by a 

steep decrease until values below LOR (OUT sample 4 and next). This may mark a change 

in the column environment. 

Again, the slight increase of ammonia along the experiment may represent that each cycle is 

less successful in oxygenating the column. This may be due to clogging processes inside the 

column that keep the column always saturated even with oxygenation (no injection) periods. 

Also, as permeability decreases, the ponding time above the soil column is longer (see Section 

4.3.1.2) not allowing for the column to “breath”, creating conditions for a redox environment. 



66 

 

Graph 20 – Nitrogen cycle components concentration in Column 5 inflow/outflow 

 

Finally, column 5 inflow show similar composition to Column 4, and an increase in nitrites in 

the following 2 samples collected from the outflow. Nitrates remained below LOR while 

ammonia showed again a decrease in concentration when compared to inflow. 

Visualizing the behaviour of these tree elements along the experiment in terms of pore-volume 

may be helpful to understand it. Ammonia, nitrites and nitrates are presented in Graph 21, 

Graph 22 and Graph 23, respectively. 

Concerning ammonia, Column 3 presents a steady concentration below inflow until 

approximately PV9 where it starts to gradually increase. Similar behaviour is presented in 

Column 4, although there is only data until PV3. Values at outflow are very similar between 

the 3 soil-column experiments. 

As stated above, nitrites behave similarly in Column 3 and Column 4 with an increase between 

PV1 and PV2 and a stable concentration parallel to inflow. Column 5 shows nitrite 

concentration higher than C3 and C4 at PV9 and PV14. 

Nitrates only show values above LOR between PV1 and PV2 in both Column 3 and Column 4. 



67 

 

Graph 21 – Ammonia vs pore-volume (natural soil) 

 

 

Graph 22 – Nitrites vs pore-volume (natural soil) 

 



68 

 

Graph 23 – Nitrates vs pore-volume (natural soil) 

 

From the analysis of the results of the three columns, it is possible to see that ammonia (NH4
+) 

is being nitrified in the first pore-volume periods, when nitrites (NO2
?) and nitrates (NO3

?) were 

increased: 

2 NH4
+ + 3 O2 ? 2 NO2

? + 2 H2O + 4 H
+ 

2 NO2
? + O2 ? 2 NO3

? 

This denitrification process was possible throughout the all period of Column 4 and 5 

experiments due to the saturation-desaturation sequence imposed. However, Column 3 was 

saturated all the time; therefore, the absence of O2 did not allow denitrification in the last 

stages (PV) which resulted in the presence of more NH4
+. These results show the importance 

of saturation-desaturation cycles in the N cycle degradation. 

 

4.3.1.3.3. Major ions 

Results from major ions for Column 3, Column 4 and Column 5 are presented in Graph 24, 

Graph 25 and Graph 26, respectively. Due to the large required volume, bicarbonate was not 

analysed. 



69 

 

Graph 24 – Column 3 major ions inflow/outflow concentrations 

 

Column 3 results concerning major ions allow establishing that inflow water shows that 

chloride is the only parameter not detected, and sulphate is very abundant followed by sodium 

and calcium. Sulphate shows lower concentrations at outflow when compared to inflow, while 

sodium (although similar) show a clear increase trend and surpasses inflow concentration 

outflow after sample 9 (S9). 

Calcium is the most abundant ion at outflow with concentration that is 3 times higher than 

inflow (S3). After a trend of concentration decrease seems to be established, allowing to 

assume that this element common in soil concentration is being continuously washed out. 

Magnesium shows equal behaviour although with lower concentrations, as well as potassium, 

with some peaks in S4 and S6 and steady behaviour after that. 

Chloride behaviour suggest that some problem occurred in the detection of this ion taking into 

account that concentration goes from 0 mg/L in every sample to 97.9 mg/L in only one sample 

(S6). 

 



70 

 

Graph 25 – Column 4 major ions inflow/outflow concentrations 

 

Column 4 inflow water shows large concentrations of calcium, chloride, magnesium, 

potassium, sodium and sulphate above 10 mg/L. Similarly to Column 3, calcium and 

magnesium show values above inflow concentration at the outflow. Sulphate shows a clear 

increasing trend to achieve inflow values at outflow sample 7. Similarly sodium shows an 

increase in concentration throughout the experiment, while potassium remains more or less 

steady after outflow sample 2, suggesting that this element washing out occurred at this point. 

Finally chloride behaviour seems to be similar to calcium and magnesium, and clearly differ 

with Column 3s inflow/outflow concentrations. 



71 

 

Graph 26 – Column 5 major ions inflow/outflow concentrations 

 

Column 5 shows an increase in sulphate, calcium, magnesium, sodium and chloride, with 

concentrations values above inflow. Phosphate shows very low concentrations in comparison, 

and potassium seems to be slowly decreasing in concentration throughout the experiment. 

Again, continuous washing out of magnesium and calcium is apparently occurring while 

chloride seems to have a persistent behaviour. 

 

4.3.1.3.4. Pharmaceuticals 

The final set of parameters analysed is pharmaceuticals. Although a set of 24 of these 

compounds were analysed (60 parameters in the case of Column 3), special attention was 

given to those that were detected in outflow, and are commonly referred in bibliographic 

references as being persistent. 

It’s important to refer that pharmaceuticals at inflow where only analysed for Column 4 and 

Column 5, while in Column 3 only one outflow sample for these compounds was analysed. 

Concerning Column 3, outflow analysis of 60 different compounds showed that 

carbamazepine, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, hydrochlorothiazide, ibuprofen, levetiracetam, 

naproxen and primidone are the only above LOR. From these levetiracetam showed the 

highest concentration (2.1 µg/L) and primidone the lowest (0.02 µg/L). 

For Column 4 and Column 5 inflow water pharmaceuticals concentrations please refer to Table 

13 in Section 4.2.3. 



72 

For the 24 compounds considered in outflow water for Column 4 (1 sample), bezafibrate, 

carbamazepine diclofenac, gemfibrozil and naproxen showed concentrations above LOR, with 

the highest being naproxen (0.46 µg/L) and the lowest in carbamazepine (0.02 µg/L). 

In Column 5, two samples were taken that showed similar results: bezafibrate, 

carbamazepine, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen and naproxen. Column 5 sample 1 

compound with lowest concentration is carbamazepine (0.02 µg/L) and the highest is 

naproxen (0.76 µg/L). In sample two, naproxen shows again the highest concentration 

(0.61 µg/L) and ibuprofen the lowest (0.17 µg/L) 

Pore-volume progression throughout the experiments is presented for carbamazepine, 

diclofenac, gemfibrozil and naproxen are presented in Graph 27 to Graph 30. 

 

Graph 27 – Carbamazepine vs pore-volume (natural soil) 

 

Carbamazepine, although with an increasing trend in column 5 shows a lower concentration 

than inflow in all outflow samples for all columns. 



73 

 

Graph 28 – Diclofenac vs pore-volume (natural soil) 

 

Diclofenac shows similar behaviour as carbamazepine although in Column 5 measured 

outflow concentrations seem to be converging with inflow concentrations. 

 

Graph 29 – Gemfibrozil vs pore-volume (natural soil) 

 

For Column 4 and 5, gemfibrozil was detected in the outflow analysis with higher concentration 

than inflow. Assuming that no pharmaceuticals are present at the soil, as it is at its natural 



74 

state, and that no form of contamination could be possible, this could result from problems 

with sampling or conditioned retention and washing out when column conditions change. This 

will be discussed in depth in section 6.1. 

 

Graph 30 – Naproxen vs Pore-volume (natural soil) 

 

Similar behaviour as gemfibrozil was detected in Column 5, with higher outflow concentration 

when compared with inflow. Column 4 presents a coherent behaviour. Although not presented 

graphically, ibuprofen outflow concentration values are also higher than inflow. 

 

4.3.1.3.5. pH, Eh and electrical conductivity 

Once a minimum volume for measurement (approximately 15 mL) was collected, pH, redox 

potential (Eh) and electrical conductivity were recorded. Eh was not measured in Column 3 

due to a problem in the sensor. pH, Eh and electrical conductivity are presented in Graph 31, 

Graph 32 and Graph 33, respectively. 

Considering as reference the pH values of Column 3 inflow water (Table 12), which 

correspond to a slightly acid water (6.08), outflow shows higher values (approximately 7), 

except in PV10 where it has basic pH (approximately 9.5). Column 4 and Column 5 have a 

pH of 7.61 at inflow but, with the exception of some samples (in PV0-1 PV6-7 and PV7-8 for 

Column 4), outflow water for both columns is neutral to basic. In terms of general behaviour 

although values are very disperse between 6.5 to 9.5 interval, there are no noticeable trends 

or any variations due to infiltration cycle start. The high pH levels contribute to the retention of 

most heavy metals in soils (cf. section 4.3.1.3.1) due to the complexes formed with the 

carbonates and oxides and hydroxides. 

 



75 

 

Graph 31 - pH vs pore-volume (natural soil) 

 

Redox potential analysis (Graph 32) may be the key to understanding the behaviour of certain 

elements as the redox environment inside the column will facilitate other reactions that can 

result in degradation/sorption of contaminants. 

 

Graph 32 – Redox potential vs Pore-volume (natural soil) 

 

Table 12 presents the Eh inflow values for Column 4 and Column 5 (173 mV). 



76 

For both Column 4 and Column 5 redox potential values taken at outflow show anaerobic 

conditions in several occasions, with most of Eh &amp;lt;40 mV. Column 4 shows a gradual decrease 

trend in Eh from positive (?40 mV) to negative values. In Column 5, Eh values remain in the 

same interval as Column 4 both the lower boundary of interval has higher values. This 

difference may reflect the success of the saturation/unsaturation cycles in oxygenating the 

columns, in lower degree in Column 4 that has lower conductivity (see Section 4.3.1.2). In 

most situations it is possible to observe an increase in the Eh after saturation starts.  

Finally, electrical conductivity values (Graph 33) at inflow (760 µS/cm for C3 and 649 µS/cm 

for C4 and C5) are generally lower than those observed at outflow with the exception of 

Column 5. At the start of soil-column experiment 3 and 4 it’s noticeable an increase of electrical 

conductivity in outflow that goes to PV1 in C4 and to PV2 in C3. Mixing between deionized 

water and wastewater is clear at this interval. Considering that wastewater injection in C5 

started after 2 cycles of deionized water, the same as C3 and C4 behaviour is observed but 

only at PV3. 

 

Graph 33 – Electrical conductivity vs pore-volume (natural soil) 

 

The continuous washing out process (possibly of Ca and Mg) is observed clearly in Column 

4, as electrical conductivity values remain stable after PV1 with only small fluctuation. Similar 

behaviour is show in Column 3 with electrical conductivity stabilizing between 800 and 

900 µS/cm along the experiment after PV2. 

Soil in column 5, after PV3 seems to respond to the deionized water/wastewater mixing 

process. After that, there is a rapid response to wastewater inflow is observed (PV6-7) at 

saturation cycle start and a following stabilization of behaviour with small fluctuation at each 

new cycle.

4.3.1.4. Soil analysis 

At the end of the experiment conducted in Column 3 and Column 5, each column was 

dismantled and soil samples were collected and sent to analysis in an external laboratory. The 

parameters analysed considered not only pharmaceuticals but also some metals, and nitrogen 

cycle components. Both columns were split into two equal sections (15 cm each), 

corresponding to top and bottom. A set of pharmaceutical compounds were analysed for both 

columns. For these compounds only one composite sample of the soil was considered for 

Column 3 while for Column 5 two samples were analysed (more precisely, one for the top 

section and one for the bottom section). 

The main results for Column 3 and Column 5 (excluding pharmaceuticals) are presented in 

Table 19 and Table 20, respectively.  

Table 19 – Column 3 soil analysis results

Phosphates % DW 0.10 0.61 0.54 

Sulphate % DW 0.10 0.12 &amp;lt;0.10 

Note: DW – dry weight 

 

The data presented for Column 3 show an almost equal concentration of boron, copper and 

zinc in top and bottom section, but boron concentrations are clearly lower (although inflow 

SBM WWTP effluent has higher concentrations in B, cf. Table 12). This confirms the ability of 

natural soils to retain the Cu and Zn that is continuously fed during the experiment (3 pore-

volumes) and the conservative behaviour observed for B that is not retained but leached. Cu 

and Zn concentrations in soils show a similar value to the average sedimentary soils of the 

world (30 mg/kg) (Alloway, 1990). 

Concerning the nitrogen cycle, ammonia showed much higher concentrations when compared 

with nitrates and nitrites. Nitrates where not detected in both top or bottom section and nitrites 

show very small concentration when compared to ammonia in both sections. This seems to 

justify the large decrease difference between inflow and outflow concentrations verified in all 

columns, showing that ammonia is heavily retained on the soil top section, besides being 

transformed into nitrites and nitrates. This last one is conservative, being leached by the 

outflow water.  

Phosphorous and phosphates show higher concentrations in the soil top section but both in 

small concentrations. This complies with what was verified in outflow water, with relatively 

important phosphorous concentrations. Sulphate concentration was not detected at bottom 

section, and on top it was slightly above LOR. 



78 

From the set of selected pharmaceuticals, none showed concentrations above LOR. Extended 

Column 3 soil analysis results are presented in Appendix 3. 

Boron and copper in Column 5 (Table 20) showed similar concentrations, although slightly 

lower, to those detected in Column 3. This is relevant since Column 5 had 15 PV of WW 

passing through the soil, and the retention capacity for Cu was maintained. Zinc appears to 

have been concentrated on the bottom section of the column, possibly due to higher 

saturation.

Note: DW – dry weight 

 

Ammonia shows a high concentration on the top section and about 1/4 of that on the bottom 

section. Nitrates and nitrites were also detected with the same behaviour – higher 

concentration on column top. When comparing both compounds to low concentrations 

detected in the outflow water it can be assumed that they were retained in the column. Also, 

by comparing nitrites to nitrates it’s possible to see a higher concentration of nitrites on the top 

of the column and higher concentration of nitrates on the bottom. It can be assumed that the 

top section of Column 5 is more oxygenated than the bottom section, generating the 

degradation of ammonia on the top, then to nitrites and finally to nitrates at the bottom, where 

they were retained. While in Column 3 most ammonia was transformed into nitrites and 

nitrates that were leached in the outflow (not accumulating in the soils), Column 5 is a longer 

experiment (15 PV instead of 3 PV) leading to the accumulation of nitrites and nitrates in the 

top part of the soil column. 

Again phosphorous and phosphates show lower concentrations in both sections when 

compared to Column 3, but in the same magnitude. 

Similarly to Column 3 sulphates where not detected in bottom section, as well as on the top. 

Concerning pharmaceuticals, the only value above LOR detected was in caffeine, in higher 

concentration on top section (57 mg/kg). Extended Column 5 soil analysis results are 

presented in Appendix 4.

4.3.2. Soil mixture 

The results obtained in the experiments performed with natural soil (Section 4.3.1) showed 

the need to increase soil ability to retain some elements, namely pharmaceuticals, at the same 

time that the permeability, and therefore the infiltration rate, would be maintained or even 

increased. Based on these purposes, different mixtures of soils were defined and tested 

aiming to define the “perfect soil” for the future application in the SAT-MAR basins. These 

mixtures are composed of different proportions of: natural soil, organic soil, and sand (cf. 

Figure 19).  

In the following sections the results concerning soil mixture characteristics (Section 4.3.2.1), 

hydraulic behaviour (Section 4.3.2.2) and quality aspects of outflow water (Section 4.3.2.3) 

are presented. 

 

4.3.2.1. Soil characteristics 

For natural soil component descriptions please refer to Section 4.3.1.1. 

The carbonates percentage determined for the organic soil was 21%. Carbonates percentage 

was also determined for artificial sand. As expected 99% of this soil mixture component is 

carbonates, as it results from crushed limestone (see Section 4.2.2.4). The increase of 

carbonates may result in contaminant retaining processes. 

Organic matter was not determined since the artificial sand is expected to have a null organic 

matter percentage due to its source (it’s not a soil itself) and the second component should 

have a organic matter percentage &gt; 70% as stated by the seller. 

A granulometric analysis for soil mixture was not possible due to the large organic content that 

would be severely altered by washing out and high temperature drying. For the same reason 

the organic soil was not submitted to this characterization. On the other hand, artificial sand 

was subjected to granulometric characterization – Graph 34 

 

Graph 34 – Artificial sand granulometric curve 

As expected, 98.1% of the particles are of the size of sands and 1.49% are below 0.063 mm. 



80 

Soil mixture bulk density and porosity where determined after column assembling and results 

are presented in Table 21.

Porosity (%) 45.0 53.1 74.8 69.8 

Bulk density (g/cm3) 1.09 0.93 1.23 1.19 

 

Porosity values seem to be related to the percentage of artificial sand added to the soil mixture 

– Column 6 (60% natural, 40% organic) had the lower porosity value while Column 8 &amp;amp; Column 

9 (40% natural, 20% organic, 40% artificial) had the higher porosity values. Column 7 

presented the lower bulk density, although being similar to Column 6. 

Both parameters are dependent not only in soil texture but also on the column packing. Since 

each soil mixture presented has its own characteristics, defining which factors will result in 

parameters variation is not possible. A larger set of soil mixtures with different percentages of 

components would be necessary to understand which effects they cause in soil characteristics 

and soil behaviour. 

Although Column 8 and Column 9 have the same composition they show different porosity 

and bulk density. This may be related to column assembling factors and is discussed in 

Section 6.1. 

 

4.3.2.2. Soil hydraulic behaviour 

Soil-column experiments were conducted with different soil mixtures, namely to understand 

the short and long term effects in hydraulic behaviour. The results are summarized in Table 

22.

Comparing pore-volume values, it noticeable that a decrease of the organic soil percentage 

and increase of artificial sand percentage in the mixture results in pore-volume increase. 

Again, as described previously, Column 8 and Column 9 show different pore-volumes, 

although the soil composition is exactly the same. These differences are also visible when 

comparing C8 and C9 flow rate and permeability. Both experiments were conducted with the 



81 

same type of inflow water matrix, thickness and assembling method, but C9 shows higher flow 

rates and permeability, which is almost the double that was verified in C8. Besides that factor, 

both C8 and C9 show lower permeability than C6 and C7, showing that the decrease of organic 

soil and increase of artificial results in a decrease of permeability. 

Both Graph 35 and Graph 36 show flow-rate changes throughout time and pore-volume 

respectively. For Column 6 and Column 7 a set of peaks were observed (easily observable in 

Flow rate vs Pore-volume graph) where there is an increase in flow rate and an abrupt change 

with a decrease of flow rate. Given that water injection was continuous and no alteration of 

injection flow was made, these peaks may result from soil washout and/or particle 

rearrangement that, after a period of decreasing permeability, result in lower flow rates with 

ponding above soil column. This hydraulic pressure resulting from ponding may have forced 

a preferential flow path (potentiated by soil wash out) and consequent particle rearrangement, 

therefore an increase in flow rates until stabilization. 

Column 8 and Column 9 show fast response after each saturation period start and low ponding 

time as the flow rate rapidly increases. It’s noticeable that C9 has almost double flow rates 

and consequently higher permeability, but shows very similar decrease times to C8 

(approximately 1 day). Both columns show a smooth linear decrease of flow rates through 

time but a more steep decrease within the first pore-volume. 

One of the facts that resulted in aborting soil-column experiment C6 and C7 was the 

continuous soil washout that created large macropores (and water/air pockets) - Figure 24. In 

Column 8 and Column 9 this washout processes was observed in the first 2 cycles, noticeable 

in the colour of the outflow water (which was slightly yellow), but no growing cavities were 

visible in the column walls. 

 

Figure 24 – Detail of soil washing out process (Column 6) 

 

Also, and possibly resulting from fine particle washout and rearrangement, a visible 

compaction process was observed in all columns but more noticeable in Column 6 and 

Column 7. While in Column 8 the maximum compaction observed was 1.5 cm, in Column 6 it 

achieved 3 cm. These processes showed a weak soil mixture structure and may have resulted 

in not good filtering layer as it was being continuously washed out.

4.3.2.3. Inflow/outflow results comparison 

The inflow and outflow samples collected in the soil-column experiments for the soil mixture 

are summarized in the following sections. Following the same procedure used for natural soil 

experiments, results were divided into subsections given the type of parameter considered – 

metals, nitrogen cycle components, major ions, and pharmaceuticals. 

As stated previously, pharmaceuticals were only measured at Column 9 outflow, while the 

other parameters where determined for Column 8, assuming same conditions in the columns. 

Column 6 and 7 were only used for flow assessment, so no water or soil quality analysis was 

performed. 

Outflow pH, Eh and electrical conductivity where measured in LASUB in both Column 8 and 

Column 9. 

 

4.3.2.3.1. Metals 

Metals and metalloids concentrations in inflow and outflow water are presented in Graph 37 

and Graph 38. Due to the differences in magnitude between the concentration values of 

phosphorous and manganese, they were presented in a separate graph. 

From the set of parameters presented in Graph 37, arsenic, chromium and copper show the 

lowest concentrations at inflow, while aluminium, antimony, iron, barium and boron show the 

highest values. Barium and boron show the highest concentrations of this set at outflow, and 

after outflow sample 13 (S13) there is a trend of decrease, with some oscillations. 

Also after S13 iron concentration increases, and several samples after that show values above 

inflow concentration. This point may mark an alteration in the column conditions or the soil 

saturation in this element. At this point the pH values show a temporary decrease (between 

pore-volume 4 and 8 (cf. Graph 52), possibly responsible for the temporary release of some 

metals). S13 was the last sample to be collected before the experiment was stopped for one 

week. This longer unsaturation period, were injection stopped (and outflow flux was severely 

slowed as the soil mixture constituents, such as peat trend to have a great water retention 

capacity) may have resulted in a longer time of water soil interaction and better oxygenation. 

The potentiation of the reactions by the longer interaction may have resulted in lower pH in 

soil solution and processes of desorption processes in metals, that were ultimately mobilized 

when inflow was resumed one week later (and therefore higher concentrations in metals were 

measured). 

Antimony show concentrations similar to inflow from sample S1 to S4 and then decreases and 

stabilizes its concentration along the experiment. 

On the second set of metals (Graph 38), outflow samples show regular behaviour throughout 

the all experiment, having approximate inflow/outflow values, except for molybdenum, 

selenium, thallium and lithium. Those are higher in the first outflows, possibly as a result of 

the soil composition. The first metal has its concentration increasing between S2 and S3 

suggesting a washout process, similarly to selenium and thallium. Lithium shows an increase 

of concentration between S2 and S18 and converges to values below inflow after that. The 

temporary increase of lithium between S13 and S18 possibly has the same reason, resulting 

from the pH decrease. 



85 

Finally, phosphorous shows at inflow relatively high concentrations, and assumes as 

oscillatory behaviour at outflow, with concentrations that can be approximately half of inflow. 

Manganese show also oscillatory behaviour with a possible washout process between S1 and 

S7 and S11 to S29 with concentrations always above inflow.

Graph 38 – Metals inflow/outflow concentration in Column 8 (2nd set) 



88 

 

Graph 39 – Manganese and phosphorus inflow/outflow concentration in Column 8 



89 

Analysing in detail some of the metals, Graph 40, Graph 41 and Graph 42 present boron, 

copper and zinc concentrations at the outflow. 

 

Graph 40 – Boron vs pore-volume (soil mixture) 

 

Boron shows its conservative behaviour between experiment start and PV3-PV4. After that 

boron concentrations measured are always below inflow concentration with a tenuous 

increase trend from PV10. Assuming that the inflow concentration remains the same it can be 

assumed that a retention mechanism is causing a smaller concentration in outflow. Even 

though B is an anion, which is likely to be conservative as Cl- or NO3
-, B is sorbed more strongly 

by soils than other anions and the manner of its sorption by clay surface or organic matter is 

somewhat similar to that of cations, for example as B(OH)4
?. Being this soil mixture more rich 

in organic matter, the better performance in B behaviour is due to that. 



90 

 

Graph 41 – Copper vs pore-volume (soil mixture) 

A copper washing out process seems to occur between experiment start and PV1, and after 

that the concentration at outflow show a decreasing trend. The only exception is at PV5. These 

results are similar to those obtained in the natural soil-column experiments. 

 

Graph 42 - Zinc vs pore-volume (soil mixture) 

 

Zinc only show above LOR outflow concentration between experiment start and PV1 – which 

again seems evidence of soil washout – and between PV3 and P5. Again the behaviour is 

very similar to that obtained in natural soil experiments, which ability to retain this metal and 



91 

Cu was already good. Also the increase of OM in soil percentage could have helped in the 

retention of this metal as this component is an important factor affecting behaviour of Zn in 

soil, which results in higher adsorption capabilities (Alloway, 1990). 

 

4.3.2.3.2. Nitrogen cycle 

Concerning the nitrogen cycle Graph 43 summarizes the inflow/outflow results for Column 8. 

Inflow water present high concentration in ammonia while nitrites and nitrates concentration 

are bellow LOR.  

At the outflow, ammonia decreases in concentration, compared with inflow, while nitrites 

reappears between S12 and S23. Nitrates show very high values, several orders of magnitude 

compared to inflow. The maximum value measured is 724 mg/L at outflow sample 3. This high 

concentration may be directly related to the soil mixtures organic component. Considering that 

it represents a commercial soil, nitrogen may have been added to its composition, being slowly 

released during the experiment. Again the changes observed during S13 and S18 may have 

created conditions that prevented the oxidation of nitrites to nitrates. 

Ammonia, nitrites and nitrates concentration along pore-volume are presented in Graph 44, 

Graph 45 and Graph 46. 

 



92 

 

Graph 43 - Nitrogen cycle components concentration in Column 8 inflow/outflow 



93 

 

Graph 44 - Ammonia vs pore-volume (soil mixture) 

Ammonia outflow values are, as previously stated, always below inflow concentration, with 

only a slight increase between PV4-PV8. This also represents that in several periods the 

column is being oxygenated and ammonia is being degraded into nitrites and nitrates. 

 

Graph 45 - Nitrites vs pore-volume (soil mixture) 

 

Nitrites also show an increase in concentration between PV4 and PV7, that remained until  

PV11. Comparing with ammonia this may represent a period when the conditions inside the 

column have changed, allowing for the nitrogen cycle to invert resulting in transformation of 



94 

nitrites and ammonia, by low oxygen levels inside it. Values are always above inflow 

concentrations. 

 

Graph 46 - Nitrates vs pore-volume (soil mixture) 

 

As presented above nitrates detected in outflow can achieve high values in several hundreds 

of mg/L. That nitrites concentration seems regular between PV1-PV3 and also between PV12-

PV14. 

Such high concentration of nitrates due to possible soil and organic matter washout end up 

disguising the nitrogen cycle processes inside the column, not allowing to compare nitrates 

outflow concentration with nitrites and ammonia with such different orders of magnitude. 

The presence of the organic soil does not favour the outflow concentrations of nitrates and 

nitrites, but in the real scale SAT-MAR basin it is expected that nitrate reduction can occur in 

reducing environment producing N2 gas, that will escape to the atmosphere:  

2 NO3
- + 12 H+ + 10 e- -&gt; N2 (g) + 6 H2O 

 

4.3.2.3.3. Major ions 

Calcium, chloride, magnesium, phosphate, potassium, sodium and sulphate concentration 

results are presented in Graph 47. 

Again bicarbonate concentrations were not measured as the necessary volume was too high. 

 



95 

 

Graph 47 – Column 8 major ions inflow/outflow concentrations 



96 

When comparing calcium and magnesium inflow and outflow concentrations, it’s again 

possible to observe a continuous soil washing out processe, where high concentrations 

along all samples are detected, except for magnesium that tends to stabilize between 

S6 and S11 and S19 and S29. Given that limestone is added to the soil mixture these 

outflow concentrations in calcium and magnesium were expected. 

Sodium and sulphate have also higher concentrations at inflow. Both show great 

increase between S12 and S20. Comparing with other parameters previously presented 

for this column, there seems to be a generalized increase of concentrations between 

S12 and S20. Chloride also follows this behaviour. Again almost all of these samples, 

mainly after S13, were collected after a long period of desaturation, where the 

experiment was stopped for 1 week. This may have allowed for the good oxygenation of 

the soil, as well as a change in the column conditions, as the sat/unsaturation interval 

greatly increased when compared with the others. 

This may have also resulted from inflow sample composition variation, but this will be 

further discussed in Section 6.1. 

 

4.3.2.3.4. Pharmaceuticals 

A set of 24 pharmaceuticals were analysed at the 4 samples collected at Column 9 

outflow. 

In the inflow water, as presented in Table 13 (Section 4.2.3), 9 out of 24 pharmaceuticals 

showed concentrations above LOR – atenolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol, propranolol, 

sotalol, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, naproxen and carbamazepine. 

Following the methodology presented in Section 4.3.1.3.4, graphics for carbamazepine, 

diclofenac, gemfibrozil and naproxen are presented in Graph 48, Graph 49, Graph 50 

and Graph 51.

98 

 

Graph 50 – Gemfibrozil vs pore-volume (soil mixture) 

 

Graph 51 – Naproxen vs pore-volume (soil mixture) 

 

Comparing with inflow data, and considering that inflow concentrations remain the same 

throughout the experiment, it’s possible to observe that none of the pharmaceuticals 

were detected at outflow – concentrations are below LOR. This may have been a result 

of soil retention and/or biodegradation. 

 



99 

4.3.2.3.5. pH, Eh and electrical conductivity 

Similarly to natural soil-column experiments, pH, redox potential (Eh) and electrical 

conductivity were measured once the necessary volume at outflow was achieved. 

Results for these three parameters, in terms of pore-volumes, are presented in Graph 

52 to Graph 54. 

Column 8 and Column 9 show similar behaviour with pH situated between 6 and 8.5, 

with the exception of sample collected at PV5 where pH is approximately 5.5 (with no 

noticeable changes in the condition of the experiment during that period this may be an 

error of measurement). No specific trend is observable and values are not very far from 

the inflow water pH (7.28). This means that no significant alteration is occurring in the 

solution pH inside the column along the experiments, except for the period between PV4 

and PV8, which is the only one with pH &amp;lt;7 after the experiment started (post PV1). That 

particular change has had important consequences in some metals remobilization, with 

clear increase in their concentration in the outflow water for that period. 

 

Graph 52 – pH vs pore-volume (soil mixture) 

Concerning Eh parameter, a similar behaviour is observed between C8 and C9, with Eh 

at outflow lower than inflow (90 mV). Again no specific trend is clear, and a low 

oxygenated environment is observed. 



100 

 

Graph 53 – Redox potential vs pore-volume (soil mixture) 

 

 

Graph 54 – Electrical conductivity vs pore-volume (soil mixture) 

 



101 

Electrical conductivity doesn’t show a clear trend in both columns considering inflow 

value (1052 ?S/cm), although from PV9-10 values are below inflow. In column 8 this 

parameter increases significantly between experiment start and PV1 and decreases 

again until PV2. This suggests that deionized water/wastewater mixture occurs rapidly 

and a soil washout process starts (as electrical conductivity values increase until 

approximately 1800 ?S/cm, higher than inflow). After a new saturation cycle there is a 

new increase but not as clear as the previous. Column 9 show no obvious behaviour with 

an increase in electrical conductivity in all experiment time, but after PV12-13 appears 

to be a clear increasing and continuous trend. 

 

4.4. Batch experiments 

Two batch experiments were conducted to understand, in equilibrium conditions, what is 

the behaviour of both natural soil and soil mixture concerning maximum contaminant 

retention capacity. 

As only one batch experiment was conducted for each soil using collected wastewater, 

this does not permit a more complex analysis with Langmuir isotherm (Langmuir, 1997; 

Appelo and Postma, 1996) that needs several batch experiments conducted with 

different contaminant concentrations in the inflow. The results will only be scrutinised in 

terms of inflow/outflow concentration comparison. 

 

4.4.1. Apparatus description and methodologies 

In both batch experiments the same procedure has been used. To avoid major 

alterations in chemical composition both natural and soil mixture were air dried. Drying 

in high temperatures may affect the soil organic matter composition and pH (EPA, 1992). 

Concerning the soil mixture, the components described in Section 4.2.2.4 used in 

Column 8 and Column 9, where used in the same proportion in the batch experiment. 

The adsorbent soils were mixed with SBM WWTP effluent in the proportion of 1:5 

(Zakharova and Leitão, 2002) – 240 mg of soil to 1200 mg of water each. The volume of 

water used considered the amount of volume necessary both for pharmaceuticals (1000 

mL) and other parameters (approximately 200 mL) - in the batch reactor (glass bottle). 

The reactor lid was closed and the soil solution was shaken manually every hour for 12 

hours during two days and after left without shaking for an additional 48 hours period. 

The batch reactor was kept under controlled temperature and was covered with tinfoil 

paper to reduce photolithotrophic microorganisms growth and photodegradation of 

contaminants. After settling the soil solution was filtered through 45 µm filter by vacuum 

pressure pumping (Figure 25). Electrical conductivity, Eh and pH effluents values have 

been measured and samples were sent for analysis in an external laboratory.

Note: bold values show increase in outflow concentration 

 

For the set of 32 parameters analysed in the inflow and outflow water, eight showed a 

decrease in concentration in the outflow when compared to inflow. Highest percentage 

of removal is observed in aluminium, followed by iron, and the lowest in sodium. Boron, 

copper, zinc, nitrites, sulphate, barium, calcium, chromium, magnesium, manganese, 

nickel, vanadium and chloride showed an increased concentration in outflow. This is the 

result of soil washing out and explains the increase of some elements in the outflow 

water, like Ba, Ni, V (Graph 9), Ca and Mg (Graph 24). 

Concerning the pharmaceuticals, Table 24 resumes the inflow/outflow concentrations.

compounds, lowest removal rate was detected for naproxen. Seven of the 24 

pharmaceuticals showed 100% removal (atenolol, betaxolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol, 

sotalol e pentoxifillin).

From the 32 parameters considered, 25 were detected in inflow water while only 20 were 

detected in the outflow water. Ammonia presented the highest adsorbed amount and 

copper, zinc, nitrites, calcium, magnesium, manganese, potassium and chloride showed 

an increase of concentration in outflow. For this set of parameters percentage of removal 

was higher in antimony, aluminium, molybdenum, selenium, silver, thallium and 

vanadium, and lowest in lithium. Again this increase in the outflow water is a result from 

the interaction between soil and water and explains the increase observed in Graph 47 

until S11 (since the increase in concentration after that period have different reasons). 

The capacity to retain Ba is also clearly seen for this soil mixture when compared to the 

natural soil.

5. Numerical modelling of column experiments 
Numerical modelling exercises were conducted using data collected in the soil-column 

experiments. These exercises can be a helpful tool to describe contaminants behaviour 

as well as some removal mechanisms and the conditions in which they occur. Solute 

transport and geochemical modelling were considered for the column behaviour 

understanding. 

For the solute transport modelling Hydrus-1D (Jacques and Šim?nek, 2005) was used. 

This software is widely used to simulate flow and solute transport in variably saturated 

soils and groundwater in both steady and transient state. One dimensional flow can be 

modelled at different scales from laboratory soil-columns to larger experiments. Hydrus-

1D can also considerer inverse problems when some parameters need to be calibrated 

or estimated from observed data. 

For geochemical modelling PHREEQC 3.1 (Parkhurst and Appelo, 2013) was used. 

PHREEQC is a speciation program to calculate the saturation index for numerous 

minerals and solid phases, the distribution of aqueous species in equilibrium, as well as 

the density and specific conductance of a specified solution composition. Also adsorption 

and desorption can be modelled as surface complexation reactions or as ion exchange 

reactions as well as ion exchange. 

HP1 (Hydrus-1D coupled with PHREEQC) package was not used, as it was not 

fundamental for the modelling process. Compared to HP1, PHREEQC 3.1 interactive 

menus and capabilities allow for easier and faster inclusion of large amounts of data, 

while the first software requires the user to have deeper knowledge of input language 

and data insertion, which is not as intuitive. Also, PHREEQC 3.1 allows for easier output 

data selection and integration with other software like Excel.  

In these modelling exercises pharmaceuticals where not considered due to the 

complexity of the modelling processes and the large number of influencing factors. Few 

studies have attempted to model this type of compound breakthroughs curves to 

differentiate between sorption and biodegradation, as modelling does not take into 

account the main removal mechanisms and considers the results as a whole trying to 

relate some changes with some initial varying conditions (DEMEAU, 2015). 

 

5.1. Nitrogen cycle / transport modelling 

5.1.1. Input data 

Given that nitrogen cycle is highly dependent on redox conditions, modelling the 

nitrification process can be useful to understand the conditions inside the column. 

For this modelling process, continuous saturated conditions were considered – all time 

length of Column 3 experiment (continuous flow) and the first saturation cycle of Column 

4. Column 5 was not modelled due to the small number of outflow samples. Column 8 

was also not considered taking into account that no data was available granulometric 

percentages for the soil mixture, which is necessary input data for Hydrus-1D. 



108 

Simulations were run in transient state for solute transport, where the inflow and outflow 

concentrations were considered as solute top and bottom boundary conditions 

respectively. Both models were divided into five time intervals. 

Input parameters for both soil-column experiments are presented in Table 27. Some of 

the input parameters were obtained by bibliographic research while others were inverse 

modelled (Ilie, 2015).

5.1.2. Results 

Simulations were successful and the model converged to a solution. Model results of

Figure 26 – Hydrus-1D results for nitrogen simulation (concentration through depth) 

 

Both simulations show similar behaviour along the columns, with ammonia being mostly 

existing (and retained) on the top of the column whereas nitrites show a small increase 

in concentration as ammonia is oxidized to nitrite, and then nitrites decrease at the 

column bottom as they are transformed into nitrates. In Column 3 simulation, ammonia 

concentration rapidly decreases to zero at the first half of the column while in Column 4 

some ammonia can be observed at the bottom section but in much lower concentration 

than that observed on the top. Nitrites concentrations show a small increase in the first 

centimetres of the column top and decreases again. In Column 4 bottom nitrites are 

observed at the outflow. Nitrates continuously increase in Column 4 while in Column 3 



110 

this compound increases at the first ¼ of the column thickness and slowly decreases 

after that. 

For the considered parameters for the three solutes, solute retention and possibly 

transformation can be observed, which can suggest that good conditions occur at the 

columns for nitrification, with lower oxygen content on the column top and slight 

oxygenation on the bottom (where higher concentration of nitrates is observed). 

Although ammonia retention on the column is confirmed by inflow and outflow 

comparison, particularly in natural soil experiments (C3 to C5), the observed behaviour 

calculated in simulations is not what is observed in the soil-column experiments results, 

mainly for nitrates concentrations. In soil-columns, nitrates show low concentration at 

outflow, instead of high concentrations calculated in the model. This may result from the 

time of simulation considered, but also, in the soil columns, to a process of retention of 

nitrates, observed in the models, where nitrates have high concentrations at the bottom 

section of the column and possibly are not mobilized to the water. 

Five nodes were represented along both columns, equally distributed between them. 

Results for variation of concentration through time taken from these nodes (from top to 

bottom) are presented in Figure 27 and Figure 28.

Solute behaviour is observed in different depths along the columns, through time (from 

point 1 to 5). Again ammonia (S1) concentrations are very low (or null) at the bottom in 

both columns. 

In an overview of the model results, Column 3 achieves stabilization in these compounds 

concentration in the first 1000 minutes and in Column 4 at approximately 200 minutes. If 



112 

pore-volumes determined in soil-column experiments are considered and that 1L of 

water is injected in both columns (steady state flow), these periods correspond to 5.7PV 

for C3 and 3.8PV for C4. 

 

5.2. Saturation index / Hydrogeochemical modelling 

5.2.1. Input data 

Taking into account the relatively high outflow concentrations of calcium and magnesium, 

the Saturation Index (Log SI) was calculated for calcite and dolomite. Considering that 

hematite is one of the natural soil constituents (as presented in Section 4.3.1.1) its Log 

SI was also determined. Given that there are no determination of silica, both at outflow 

and inflow for all columns, the calculation of Log SI for the other major mineral 

constituents of the natural soil was not possible (quartz, anorthite, montmorillonite, 

kaolinite, etc.). 

Column 3, Column 4 and Column 8 inflow and outflow solutions were inserted into 

PHREEQC. Column 5 was not considered due to the small number of outflow samples.  

As HCO3
- concentration was only measured for Column 8 inflow and outflow, average 

concentration detected at C8 outflow was used as input for Column 3 and Column 4. 

Inflow concentration of this parameter was also used as input for inflow solution for C3 

and C4 

PHREEQC input data is presented in Appendix 5. 

 

5.2.2. Results 

Saturation indexes determined for dolomite, calcite and hematite for Column 3 inflow 

solution are presented in Table 28.

Index 
(Log)

The Log SI calculated shows that Column 3 inflow water is unsaturated in calcite and 

dolomite. Very low value (Log SI ? 0) for hematite show that the solution is in equilibrium 

with this mineral. 

Saturation index for calcite and dolomite of Column 3 outflow is presented in Graph 55. 

Hematite saturation index is presented in Graph 56. 



113 

 

Graph 55 – Column 3 outflow Log SI for calcite and dolomite 

 

 

Graph 56 – Column 3 outflow Log SI for hematite 

 

Both calcite, dolomite and hematite present similar behaviour although Log SI for 

hematite is slightly higher. Outflow Log SI shows that solution is saturated in these 

minerals until PV7, where unsaturated suggests that conditions inside the column 

changed. At approximately PV10 Log SI for the set of minerals is positive, decreases to 

equilibrium state and unsaturated again. 

Unsaturation at inflow and saturation at outflow suggests that calcite and dolomite 

dissolution is occurring inside the column. Therefore, these results can explain the large 

concentrations of Ca and Mg at the outflow. 



114 

High pH measured in solution 11 (near PV10) may have resulted in relatively high Log 

SI for hematite, calcite and dolomite. 

Saturation indexes determined for dolomite, calcite and hematite for Column 4 inflow 

solution are presented in Table 29.

In this soil-column experiment, inflow solution is close to stability concerning dolomite 

and calcite while high Log SI for hematite was determined, showing saturation in this iron 

oxide.

Graph 58 – Column 4 outflow Log SI for hematite 

 

Again, Column 4 Log SI for calcite, dolomite and hematite seem to follow the same 

behaviour. Outflow Log SI for calcite and dolomite is constantly below 0, showing that 

the solution collected at column outlet is unsaturated in these minerals (except of PV2 

where Log SI ? 1). On the other hand, hematite Log SI is constantly over 0, showing 

saturation, although Log SI is much lower than Log SI calculated for inflow. This can 

suggest that Column 4 conditions allowed for some precipitation of these minerals, 

instead of dissolution. It’s also important to note that this data is referring to only 3 pore-

volumes of the experiment. 

Saturation indexes determined for dolomite, calcite and hematite for Column 8 soil 

mixture inflow solution are presented in Table 30.

For this soil-column experiment, inflow solution is slightly unsaturated in calcite and 

dolomite. Again hematite Log SI is showing oversaturation at inflow.

Hematite saturation index is presented in Graph 60.

Graph 60 – Column 8 outflow Log SI for hematite 

 

Column 8 outflow Log SI general behaviour shows that, except for a small period after 

experiment start and PV9-11, Log SI for calcite and dolomite is &gt;0. Taking in account 

that inflow was unsaturated in these minerals, dissolution occurred inside the column. 

Again this can explain the high concentrations of Ca and Mg at outflow. Saturation cycles 

seem to result in an increase of SI, suggesting that mineral dissolution inside the column 



117 

starts as soon as spreading starts. Interval between PV9 and PV11 suggest that 

conditions inside the column changed as calcite and dolomite are unsaturated. 

Temperature values measured for the samples collected between this interval were 

relatively low (&lt;10ºC) which could have resulted in low Log SI in speciation modelling. 

Concerning hematite, Log SI values calculated for C8 outflow solutions, which are very 

similar to inflow SI, show once again saturation. It is possible that hematite in the soil 

constitution remains unchanged, and no reactions occur between the soil media and 

solution concerning this mineral. Besides this, there is a difference between inflow and 

outflow concentration of iron for the soil mixture experiment (Section 4.3.2.3.1). 

 

5.3. Inverse modelling 

5.3.1. Input data 

Inverse modelling was used as a way to understand phase transfers that occur between 

inflow solution and the soil media. The methodology adopted consisted in inverse 

modelling solution A to solution B, C, D, etc., having as solution A the initial solution – 

the inflow water – and the final solutions as the outflow solutions collected from the 

column. 

For this exercise, Column 3 results were used, considering that the experiment was 

conducted in continuous flow/saturation cycle (meaning that no changes in terms of 

conditions were induced directly in the column) and also the substantial number of 

samples collected at outflow. 

Three of the major ions that show significant concentrations at outflow and are major 

constituents of the minerals in the natural soil – calcium, magnesium and sodium. As 

input, two mineral phases – calcite and dolomite – and three exchangers – CaX2, MgX2 

and NaX – were considered. Mineral phases mass transfers between initial to final 

solutions allow to understand if dissolution or precipitation processes occur. Exchangers 

present cation exchange processes. 

This inverse modelling approach can represent a simple way to understand the 

behaviour of soil concerning retention of certain ions giving column outflow 

concentrations. 

 

5.3.2. Results 

Results for Inverse Modelling process ran through PHREEQC are presented in Graph 

61. 

It’s important to refer that for mineral phases, positive values of concentration means 

dissolution in the second solution (outflow), as this is enriched in that element when 

compared to the first solution (inflow). For the exchangers (CaX2, NaX and MgX2), 

negative values in concentration means that it gave ions to the solution, enriching the 

solution in the element of the exchanger.

are presented in Graph 62.

119 

Concerning the mineral phases analysed, inverse models where dolomite 

dissolution/precipitation occurs weren’t considered, being given special attention to 

models that considered calcite and exchangers. This decision results from the fact that 

it is very unlike to occur dolomite precipitation or dissolution in such a small column. 

In terms of processes that occur in the column for inflow solution to become outflow 

solutions, it’s possible to observe a positive phase transfer of calcite from the initial 

solution to final solutions. It can be assumed that continuous dissolution of this mineral 

is occurring, and it’s especially important in the first pore-volume. On the other hand an 

inverse behaviour is calculated for calcium exchanger, resulting negative phase transfers 

to it and therefore an enrichment of the solution concentrations at outflow. Considering 

that inflow water composition does not vary throughout the experiment, it can be 

assumed that calcite dissolution and calcium washout occur, therefore large 

concentrations are encountered in outflow solutions. This continuous dissolution can be 

a positive factor in the retention of contaminants, such as metals. 

Calcium concentrations at outflow increase rapidly in the first two PV, and after that 

slowly decreases and seams to stabilize. Mineral phase (calcite) and calcium exchanger 

also follow similar behaviour. 

Magnesium and sodium exchangers seam to follow the exact pattern as outflow 

concentrations, but while magnesium exchanger tends to stabilize in positive phase 

transfers, slowly retaining this element, sodium exchanger shows an increasing trend 

(positive phase transfers) for retention. This is somewhat contrary to what was expected. 

Continuously high outflow concentrations of Mg and Na when compared to inflow can be 

explained by dissolution of other phases that were not considered in this analysis. If silica 

concentration at both inflow and outflows was measured clay minerals interaction with 

inflow solution could be modelled (when considering additional mineral phases such as 

montmorillonite or illite).

6. Results discussion  
Considering the soil characteristics, and comparing both natural and soil mixtures it’s 

expected, due to the components used, that the later presents increased composition in 

carbonates and organic matter. Both are expected to have significant effects in terms of 

contaminant degradation and retention. Also, the increase in granulometry, by addition 

of artificial sand component (with granulomectric composition of approximately 98% 

above 0.063 mm) resulted in an increase of flow rates at outflow, and therefore an 

increase in permeability. This may also help in facing the possible long term effects of 

soil washout processes resulting from the addition of organic soil. Column 6 (40% of 

organic soil) and Column 7 (30% of organic soil) showed a significant decrease in 

thickness resulting from particle washout processes (up to 3 cm in approximately 4 days 

of functioning). This was actually observed in the outflow water colour (slightly yellow). 

This was not relevant in Column 8 and Column 9 where the decrease of organic soil 

percentage and increase of artificial sand component gave structure to the soil mixture, 

lessening the washout process. 

In terms of soil behaviour, the soil mixture presents similar behaviour to natural soil 

concerning the response to saturation cycles, with a rapid increase of flow rate and 

decreasing as water above soil top is depleted. Besides that, soil mixture generally 

showed higher results concerning permeability, both in short term (1 day) and long term 

periods – Table 31.

Considering the columns where quality component was analysed, C8 and C9 showed 

good results in long term behaviour as both experiments were conducted for 46 days. 

C4 showed the worst results in both short and long time behaviour. Although several 

processes could have led to these results in this soil-column experiment, packing 

process of natural soil and immediate injection of wastewater are the apparent causes if 

compared with Column 5 results (only two packing strikes instead of three and first cycle 

was conducted with deionized water). This behaviour is consistent to Pavelic et al. (2011) 

that observed high dependence of hydraulic loading rates on the level of treatment given 

to the source water (in particular, to the level of particles present in the source water) 

and subsequent clogging effects. 

In general terms, the permeability decrease is faster in the natural soil and total clogging 

was even observed in C4. C8 and C9 were still functioning after more than 1 month, 

although with smaller outflow, which shows a good behaviour for an infiltration basin.

Soil mixture inflow sample (C8) present a slight enrichment in certain metals when 

compared to other columns inflow concentrations, particularly in barium and boron. 

Besides that fact, when comparing inflow and outflow concentrations in the 11 

parameters considered, Column 3 has 7 parameters where outflow concentration is 

higher than inflow, while Column 4 has 6 and Column 5 has 9. One keep in mind that 

Column 5 only has two outflow samples, which do not allow for a detailed overview of 

the general behaviour of the parameters considered. Column 8 has only 3 parameters in 

which outflow average concentration surpasses the inflow, suggesting an overall 

reduction of concentration in outflow besides the slight enrichment in inflow. Phosphorus 

shows the highest reduction in all columns. This is particularly useful taking into account 

that this element is very common in wastewater matrix. 

Considering that boron is a rare element at soils, and it is usually retained by organic 

matter5, boron concentration decrease in outflow may have resulted from increased 

presence of organic matter in the soil mixture. Zinc is heavily retained by clay minerals, 

hydrated metal oxides and organic matter (Alloway, 1990) being a good indicator of the

effects of a possible increase of organic matter in soil mixture. It is also important to note 

that adsorption of Zn from soil solution by the solid soil particles is generally 

accompanied by simultaneous desorption of equivalent amounts of other cations from 

the solid phase to the soil solution. 

Nitrogen cycle components overall results are presented in Table 33. Again, outflow

Note: red values represent higher outflow concentrations compared to inflow 

The general behaviour is similar in natural soil and soil mixture, with high concentration 

of ammonia at inflow and a reduction at outflow. Both soil mixture and natural soil show 

similar results also in nitrites, with low concentration at inflow and high concentration at 

outflow average. This suggests a transformation of ammonia in nitrites and nitrites into 

nitrates. Excluding Column 4, the inflow of all columns has lower concentration of nitrates 

than outflow average. Although this may suggest that nitrites are being converted into 

nitrates, a careful investigation has to be taken considering the known problems with 

nitrates in SBM WWTP and the outflow average of Column 8. The first premise raises 

some doubts in nitrates values measured in the inflow, as nitrates always show very low 

values in comparison to background data in the study area. The second statement is 

related to the possible constitution of the organic soil used, as the main reason for such 

high concentration in nitrates in outflow water can result from a high concentration in the 

soil itself. This is not observed in the original soil. Besides this fact, similar behaviour with 

ammonia was observed by Ollivier et al. (2013) in a soil-column experiment, where NH4
+ 

was the predominant form of nitrogen in the infiltrated treated wastewater but its 

concentration decreased sharply with depth, in which NH4
+ is oxidized to NO3

- in aerated 

conditions. In the process NH4
+ was retained in the uppermost soil layer and nitrification 

occurred in the top 1.5 m of soil. 

Major ions results for all soil-column experiments are presented in Table 34. OUT refers

Overall behaviour is again similar in all columns, where a high concentration is measured 

at outflow for calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, and chloride. This suggest a and 

continuous washing out of the soil mineral matrix, with includes limestone, anorthite and 

montmorillonite (bentonite). These minerals are rich in Ca, Mg, K, Na. Similar behaviour 

was observed by Goren et al. (2011) where the recharge of secondary effluent into a 

calcareous sandstone aquifer was accompanied by CaCO3 dissolution that increased 

the Ca concentration in the reclaimed water resulting in increasing water hardness. 

High concentrations of chloride also suggest limestone reaction with acid solutions, 

although inflow concentration is not very different from outflow average. The main 

behaviour of this element is to be persistent. 

Sulphate concentration decreases in Column 3 (from 88 mg/L at inflow to 8.9 mg/L at 

outflow) and in Column 5 (64.7 mg/L to 52.63 mg/L), while Column 4 and Column 8 show 

an increase at outflow. The difference in concentration reduction between C3 and C5 

can be related to redox environment. C3 continuous inflow did not allow for the 

oxygenation of column, creating an oxygen depleted environment, allowing SO4
2- 

transformation. This is not the case in C5, where the saturation cycles allow for the 

oxygen presence in the column (at least in some sections). As Greskowiak et al. (2005) 

demonstrated in infiltration basins, the abrupt change from saturated to unsaturated 

conditions causes the most significant geochemical changes, including the rapid 

oxidation of sulphides accompanied by the dissolution of calcite. 

Phosphate concentration is highly reduced throughout the experiments, but more in the 

natural soil. 

The overall behaviour of Column 8 experiment concerning major ions is worse than that 

observed for natural soil column experiments. This may be the result of the addition of 

artificial sand, enriching the soil with limestone thus resulting in an increased leaching of 

major ions. 

It is also important to note that this soil-column experienced a long period of non 

saturation (as discussed in Section 4.3.2.3.1) which resulted in a longer time of water-soil 

interaction and better oxygenation (with longer water residence due to the enhanced 

water retention capacity induced by OM) and therefore enhanced soil-water reactions, 

lowering pH in soil solution and increasing of desorption processes in metals. These 

were latter mobilized when outflow flux was re-established. This can provide significant 

information about the saturation/desaturation periods and their effects for basin 

functioning procedures. 

If ELV values from Legislative Decreed 236/98 are used as reference and compared to 

average outflow values for each column (Table 35) it can be concluded that after soil-

column filtration outflow concentrations are below limits defined by law. This means that 

limit values at discharge after treatment are respected. It’s important to refer that from 

the 26 parameters considered only six have emission limit values defined.

In a more conservative approach using as reference the maximum recommended values 

for drinking water, a similar comparison to the average outflow concentration was made 

-Table 36. From the 26 parameters considered, fifteen of them have MRV defined by 

law. Aluminium, boron, nickel, chloride, sodium and sulphate concentrations at outflow 

are below MRV for all columns. On the other hand, manganese, ammonia and nitrites 

are above MRV in all columns, while nitrates are above MRV only in Column 8. Antimony 

and selenium were only determined for Column 8 outflow and are also above MRV. 

These can be considered poor quality waters in terms of drinking water criteria, but one 

must keep in mind that this is treated wastewater not subjected to the same treatment 

as a drinking water. Also, soil-column experiments only show represent a small part of a 

SAT system, given that many processes of purification occur in larger depths of the 

aquifer.

Concerning pH, Column 8 and Column 9 show slightly lower pH values at outflow in 

comparison with Column 3, 4 and 5. Eh values are very disperse with no direct relation 

with saturation/unsaturation cycles. Besides the high dispersion of these parameters, 



126 

there seems to be a negative correlation between both, with inverse relation (decrease 

of pH results in increase of Eh) - Graph 63. 

This information may be useful for further experiments, both in laboratory scale and 

infiltration basin scale. 

 

Graph 63 – pH vs Eh for natural soil and soil mixture 

 

Batch experiment results for natural soil show similar results for soil-column experiments. 

From the both batch experiments results comparison soil mixture shows better effects 

on supressing recalcitrant pharmaceuticals, where one out of 14 above LOR in inflow 

was detected in outflow, namely carbamazepine. This element also occurs in the outflow 

of the batch conducted in natural soil, where seven out of 14 above LOR show persistent 

behaviour. 

Other parameters also show better results in soil mixture, where average of percentage 

of removal is 63.7% vs 56.9% of natural soil. Also, the number of compounds that 

showed concentration increase at outflow is higher in natural soil (13) than in soil mixture 

(9). 

The increase of organic matter seems to have had a positive effect in terms of overall 

contaminant reduction. But the selected organic soil must be carefully chosen. In the 

selected soil mixture, there were unexpected results concerning nitrates. Higher 

concentrations at outflow can point to a possible contamination (accidental or intended 

addition) of these elements in the organic soil, since it is usually used as plants substrate. 

To control this, a careful analysis should be conducted if the organic soil is commercial, 

besides consulting the sellers’ composition information. If possible this organic layer 

should be created in controlled conditions if time constraints allow it. 

In a practical approach, considering an average volume discharged every day from 

wastewater treatment plant of 900 m3/d (AdA and ERSAR, 2008), treated volume 

percentages can be calculated for the basins to be constructed based on the range of 

laboratory flow rates obtained. For the two basins programed to be constructed (each 

one with 15 m by 7 m = 105 m2 area), a reactive layer of the natural soil, wastewater 



127 

volume that could be infiltrated ranges from 6 to 24 % of the total SB Messines WWTP 

outflow volume considering flow rates obtained at column scale for day 1 of experiment 

and without taking into account clogging effects - Table 37.

If characteristics determined for C8 and C9 (that shown better endurance to soil washing

at the basin bottom can treat up to 71% of the considered average volume discharged 

daily in perfect conditions (i.e. no clogging effects) - Table 38. Again, flow rates 

considered correspond to 1 day of experiment in both columns. If flow rates for all the 

experiment time length (44 days) are considered the treated percentage decreases to 

13% in Column 8 and 21% in Column 9.

6.1. Uncertainty associated with soil-column experiments 

Uncertainty in the methodologies and procedures adopted can cause some lack of 

confidence in results, this is why for the sake of future research this must be described. 

A brief analysis of uncertainty must be conducted for the sole reason to understand the 

limitations of this type of experiments and also to keep track of the lacking information. 

Effects of soil packing are somewhat dependent of, as previously seen, number of strikes 

(drops), but not only. The effect of weight dropping can change from user to user, and 

it’s not possible to replicate with high confidence the same column. Even the dry filling 

procedure of the column, natural granulometric selection can occur and different 

interface can be created inside the soil column. 

Concerning column assembling uncertainty factors a parallel benchmark was conducted 

in Column 8 and Column 9. The soil mixture that was used in the soil column had exactly 

the same composition. The same person conducted the filling and packing process in 



128 

both columns, following the exactly same steps. Pre-experiment saturation process was 

conducted in parallel and after experiment start the saturation cycles started at exactly 

the same time with the same water matrix being injected. Given those careful procedures 

to replicate every step in both columns the results were in fact different. Column 8 had a 

lower permeability than Column 9, and flow rates were repeatedly lower. After the 

experiment was discontinued, both soils where removed from the column and carefully 

observed. No evidences of preferential flow channels were observed. 

Uncertainty in concentrations measured in column outflow samples or SBM WWTP 

effluent samples analysis for determination of pharmaceuticals concentration can be 

considered minor, since the values obtained are in the same interval scale, although 

conditions of sampling varied. Besides that fact, higher values at outflow than for inflow 

for pharmaceuticals were detected in column 3, 4 and 5. Both inflow and outflow sample 

conservation followed strict conservation rules, being kept in low temperatures previous 

to laboratory analysis. 

The reasonable cause for this, and considering that there are no pharmaceutical 

compounds in the soil previous to the soil-column experiments, may be the fractioning 

process conducted in the inflow samples. After the SBM WWTP was collected in large 

container, it was divided into several smaller glass vials for both conservation and also 

for gradual infiltration in the column experiments. This fractioning process may have 

caused some kind of compound partition due to differentiated settling inside the main 

container before being divided into parts, thus having different concentrations in different 

bottles. The result may be that the outflow concentrations may not be representative of 

the values measured in one inflow analysis.

7. Synthesis, conclusions and recommendations 
Soil-Aquifer Treatment (SAT) in Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) systems is a 

recharge option aiming to improve the quality of the recharged water while augmenting 

the water availability, helping to address water scarcity challenges.  

In SAT-MAR basins, water percolates through the soil matrix under controlled conditions 

inducing water pre-treatment. In fact, as the effluent moves through the soil, natural soil 

filtration occurs and water undergoes significant quality improvements through physical, 

chemical and biological processes. 

One of the main existing challenges of SAT-MAR is to control and maintain the infiltration 

rates and avoid clogging due to physical, chemical and biological processes taking place 

during the transport of water through the unsaturated and saturated zone. Soil-column 

experiments are frequently used to get information on the soil behaviour under controlled 

conditions.  

In the framework of this dissertation carried out under EU MARSOL project 

(www.marsol.eu), several soil-column experiments were conducted at LNEC LASUB 

laboratory using a soil collected in SB Messines wastewater treatment plant, one of the 

Algarve demo sites. This dissertation presents the results obtained concerning the soil 

flow rate variations under different conditions, aiming at verifying the soil suitability for 

infiltration media in basins. It also presents the results for the improvement in water 

quality resulting from the soil capacity for sorption and biodegradation of the pollutants.  

The laboratory experiments performed allowed gathering information on the short and 

long term behaviour, at laboratory scale, of São Bartolomeu de Messines natural soil 

and a soil mixture produced from it, providing the basis for deciding the best soil 

composition to be used in the SAT-MAR facility to be installed in SB Messines WWTP. 

The first conclusion that can be drawn in that the soil collected in the outskirts of the SB 

Messines WWTP has shown some suitability to be used as a base infiltration layer for 

the SAT-MAR infiltration basins, in what concerns the infiltration capacity, but is expected 

to have some problems in the long term, with a continuous decrease in permeability. This 

has led to the need of a new soil composition mixture.  

The production of a soil mixture composed of organic soil and “artificial sand” from 

crushed limestone mixed with natural SBM soil, resulted in a more pervious material with 

a good long term hydraulic behaviour, with better response to saturation/unsaturation 

cycles. Although organic matter percentage has increased the soil washout processes 

and compaction resulting from particle rearrangement, this was not very problematic for 

the permeability rates at long term. 

Considering the average volume of 900 m3/d discharged every day from wastewater 

treatment plant (AdA and ERSAR, 2008), the potential treated volume percentages were 

calculated for the basins to be constructed (each one with 15 m by 7 m = 105 m2 area), 

based on the range of laboratory flow rates obtained. 

For the two basins with a reactive layer of natural soil, the wastewater volume that could 

be infiltrated ranges from 6 – 24 % of the total SB Messines WWTP outflow volume, 

http://www.marsol.eu/


130 

considering the flow rates obtained at column scale for day 1 of experiment and without 

taking into account clogging effects (Table 37). 

Considering the soil mixture (40% natural soil, 40% artificial sand and 20% organic soil), 

which has shown better endurance to soil washing out processes and good long term 

behaviour, a reactive layer installed at the basin bottom could treat up to 71% of the 

considered average volume discharged daily if no clogging effects are considered (Table 

38). If flow rates measured at the end of experiment (44 days) are considered, treated 

percentage decreases to 21% of the daily discharged volume. 

The removal of contaminants in the wastewater of SB Messines was analysed aiming to 

understand the best conditions for improving the water quality for the following main 

group of contaminants: metals, nitrogen cycle, pharmaceuticals and major ions. 

Both natural soil and different soil mixtures were studied using cycles of saturation and 

non-saturation, the latter allowing the oxygenation of the soil column. The main 

conclusions that can be drawn are: (1) the presence of a soil mixture with an organic 

matter (OM) layer favours the retention/degradation (mainly through sorption and 

biotransformation processes) of most pharmaceuticals studied, as well as heavy metals 

(retained both in clay fraction and OM); (2) the sequence of oxic/anoxic conditions is the 

best approach to ensure maximum attenuation efficiency, since some elements degrade 

better in oxic conditions (for example for the biological oxidation of ammonia into nitrite, 

nitrate and nitrogen gas), and others are degraded under anaerobic conditions (example 

for several pharmaceuticals); and (3) the existence of high pH favours the retention of 

heavy metals attached to soils. 

 

7.1. Recommendations 

Given the results obtained, concerning both hydraulic and quality aspects, a set of 

considerations/recommendations can be made: 

? The experimental results obtained in laboratory, both for permeability and 

recharge water quality, are different from basin scale experiments. This results 

from scaling factors as well as the natural soil heterogeneity, together with local 

differences resulting from changes in vegetation, topography or man activity.  

? The exposure to field conditions that can vary widely, and are not possible to 

control as in soil-column experiments. At infiltration basin scale other processes, 

such as root growth in the reactive layer, could benefit the long-time hydraulic 

behaviour by smoothing the clogging effects, but on the other hand uncontrolled 

effluent (with the natural variations that a wastewater can experience) can have 

adverse results in the basin operational status. 

? The increase in the organic matter content in the soil used for SAT-MAR has 

shown general improvement of the outflow water quality when compared with the 

inflow. Thus, if the natural soil to be used as reactive layer has low concentration 

of organic matter, it should be integrated in a soil mixture, e.g. in the form of 

humus or peat. 

? The increase of organic matter can result in lowering the soil resistance, due to 

the increase in porosity resultant from the washing out processes; the latter 



131 

creates preferential flow paths, cavities and air pockets that led to the thickness 

decrease of the reactive layer. Consequently, the addition of a skeleton 

component can be useful to avoid these phenomena. “Artificial sand”, which is 

an inexpensive material produced from limestone crushing, was a good example 

to increase permeability and also to give structure to the soil, without any relevant 

impact in terms of quality at outflows as the matrix of this component is the same 

as the natural soil (limestone). 

? The implementation of a procedure of saturation/unsaturation cycles allows the 

soil to oxygenate, enabling the degradation/retention of compounds under 

oxidation reactions, as well as periods of oxygen depleted environment that 

enhance anaerobic degradation. This will also reduce biological clogging effects, 

as the small turbulence of inflow water and air exposure can hinder biofilm 

production on the soil top. 

? The implementation of too large periods (more than 1-2 days) of non-saturation 

conditions should be avoided to prevent drastic changes in pH and redox 

conditions which can result namely in the remobilization of metals (Graph 

37,Graph 38,Graph 39 and Graph 52). 

? The inflow water should be equally distributed along the reactive layer and water 

influx should be relatively low. This allows avoiding turbulence and the creation 

of suspended solids as well as the remobilization of contaminants retained in the 

soil matrix. 

? Finally, although soil analysis results showed little to none concentration of 

pharmaceuticals retained in it, it’s expected that this reactive layer can have high 

contaminant concentration. Therefore, this reactive layer should be treated as a 

hazardous material, and if substitution is necessary due to maximum lifespan 

achievement, it should be collected, contained and afterwards destroyed to avoid 

additional pollution problems. 

 

7.2. Research needs 

Further studies will be conducted at the SAT-MAR basin scale that will help enriching 

the conclusions of this dissertation. 

In terms of what was learned and considering the limitations of these experiments, 

several research needs are proposed: 

? To confirm the presence of microorganisms capable of degrading 

pharmaceuticals in the column, particularly in the natural soil/soil mixture. These 

microorganisms with biodegradation potential can originate from the soil itself 

collected from the field site or injected with inflow water. This information would 

help understanding the degradation/transformation processes that occurred 

inside the columns.  

? To monitor real time changes in parameters. This could help understanding the 

degradation processes and the importance of redox potential (Eh), total organic 

carbon (TOC), nutrients and pH, among others, in the chemical and biological 

processes occurring in the column. For example, the value in Eh and the 

consumption/production of oxidants can give insight into the types and extent of 



132 

biodegradation processes related with the decrease in pharmaceuticals 

concentration. 

? To define the amount of organic matter needed to achieve good results. The 

addition of organic matter certainly had an effect in the retention of 

pharmaceuticals, but a larger number of soil-column experiments and batch 

experiments would be necessary to establish the most effective amount of OM to 

be added without compromising the reactive layer structure and retention 

capacity. 

? To investigate other possible pre-existent contaminants in the organic soil to be 

mixed with original soil, aiming to prevent further contamination problems. 

? To develop new soil-column and batch experiments using spiked concentrations 

(with known concentrations) of certain contaminants, allowing analysing the soil 

behaviour with water having higher concentrations than those used (but 

maintaining the same wastewater contaminants and emerging contaminants).  

The knowledge achieved, particularly in quality of outflow aspects, may be of relevance 

to the legal framework, helping to establish reference values to the injection/infiltration 

water quality and suitable soils (and places) and materials to use in SAT-MAR 

processes, to produce successful results with minimum negative environmental impacts 

and an acceptable economic outcome.
