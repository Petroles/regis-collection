Abstract

The development of the electrical sector whether in the new business model resulting from the

liberalisation of a traditionally state-controlled and/or state-regulated sector or due to the de-

ployment of new clean electricity production technologies poses big challenges. In particular,

the advent of renewable energy and the massive penetration of variable renewable electric-

ity have shaken some of the traditional pillars of the electricity sector. Despite being the

symbol of a liberalised market, the pool market is a trading mechanism which induces great

uncertainty on market participants’ operations, becoming a considerable source of risk to the

goals defined by the electricity sector’s companies, particularly the goal of profit maximisation.

In this context, the first objective of this work is the extension of the multi-agent electricity

market simulator (MAN-REM), developed by the Portuguese National Laboratory of Energy

and Geology, allowing greater and better operation and mainly more interactivity of this soft-

ware regarding the profit maximisation of generation companies through the optimisation of

their portfolio’s production scheduling.

After the development of a mouse and keyboard based interface which greatly facilitates

the interaction with users and provides a functioning structure, three profit optimisation mod-

els were programmed and added to the software. Each of these models is characterised by its

own portfolio composition, including the following technology portfolios: thermal, hydro and

wind, and thermal and wind.

After the extension of the simulator with these new features, this work focused on demon-

stration of the optimisation models, aiming to investigate their response to di?erent input

values, namely to market prices forecasts (necessary to the self-scheduling algorithms). Addi-

tionally, a second case study was considered to use some of the initial features of MAN-REM

to demonstrate the sensibility of market-clearing to higher wind production ratios.

The results of the first case study revealed a good logical coordination between the equa-

tions of each optimisation model and the output values. Furthermore, the second case study

demonstrated the well-known impact of high levels of variable generation on market clearing

prices.

Resumo

A evoluc?a?o do sector ele?ctrico, tanto ao n??vel do seu modelo de nego?cio atrave?s da liberalizac?a?o

de um mercado ha? muito controlado e/ou regulado pelos estados, quer ao n??vel da evoluc?a?o das

tecnologias de produc?a?o de energia ele?ctrica, apresenta grandes desafios. O advento das ener-

gias renova?veis e a penetrac?a?o massiva da produc?a?o de eletricidade de cariz varia?vel vieram

abalar alguns do princ??pios pelos quais o sector sempre se regeu.

Apesar de se assumir como o mecanismo s??mbolo de um regime de mercado liberalizado,

o mercado em bolsa (pool) induz grande incerteza nas operac?o?es dos agentes que nele partic-

ipam, tornando-se uma fonte de risco para os objectivos trac?ados por cada agente, podendo

representar, em u?ltima ana?lise, perdas na?o negligencia?veis que se refletem nos balanc?os das

empresas e, por conseguinte, na sua sustentabilidade financeira a me?dio e longo prazo. A

opc?a?o por contratos bilaterais de compra e venda de energia ele?ctrica, cujas condic?o?es de

transac?a?o sa?o detalhadamente definidas apo?s negociac?a?o e acordo entre as partes, torna-se,

deste modo, uma opc?a?o de mitigac?a?o do risco em que os agentes de mercado incorrem.

Nesta perspectiva, o objectivo deste trabalho e? composto, numa primeira fase, pela exten-

sa?o do simulador multi-agente de mercados de energia, MAN-REM, desenvolvido pelo Lab-

orato?rio Nacional de Energia e Geologia (LNEG), permitindo uma maior operacionalidade e

interatividade do software na sua vertente de maximizac?a?o do lucro das empresas (agentes)

de produc?a?o de energia ele?ctrica, atrave?s da optimizac?a?o do agendamento de operac?o?es da sua

carteira de ativos, no que respeita a?s infraestruturas de produc?a?o de energia ele?ctrica.

O plano de agendamento e? calculado com base nas caracter??sticas te?cnicas de cada central,

como o custo de produc?a?o fixo, custo de produc?a?o varia?vel, custo de desligamento, custo de

ligac?a?o e, no caso de centrais te?rmicas, custos de emissa?o de gases de efeito de estufa. A soma

de todos estes factores (quando aplica?veis) representa, nos modelos de optimizac?a?o considera-

dos, o encargo financeiro decorrente da produc?a?o de energia ele?ctrica que devera? ser minorado

pela colocac?a?o informada de volumes de energia no mercado, permitindo a anulac?a?o dos custos

atrave?s da majorac?a?o dos proveitos. Consequentemente, as previso?es de disponibilidade de

produc?a?o de centrais ele?ctricas de cariz varia?vel — traduzidas atrave?s de dados hora?rios de

velocidade do vento (para a gerac?a?o eo?lica) e escorre?ncia de a?guas (para a produc?a?o h??drica)

— e a estimativa de prec?os de mercado para compra e venda de energia ele?ctrica, sa?o tam-

be?m dados de entrada essenciais, que permitem a um produtor “prever” quais as unidades de

produc?a?o renta?veis a uma determinada hora e qual a forma mais bene?fica para a sua venda:

o mercado em bolsa ou a contratac?a?o bilateral.

ix



A construc?a?o de um conjunto de janelas, em linguagem JAVA, que permitam definir uma

interface de apoio ao manuseamento das novas funcionalidades de agendamento, foi uma fase

essencial do trabalho. As diversas janelas criadas permitem simular as func?o?es de adic?a?o

manual de novos agentes produtores — incluindo todas as caracter??sticas te?cnicas dos seus

portfo?lios segundo as va?rias tecnologias de produc?a?o inerentes a cada central —, a adic?a?o de

novos agentes a partir de ficheiros de dados externos (EXCEL), a optimizac?a?o do agendamento

da produc?a?o de um agente, a visualizac?a?o de dados de sa??da detalhados do processo de opti-

mizac?a?o e, finalmente, a simulac?a?o de uma plataforma electro?nica de casamento automa?tico

de ofertas compra e venda de energia em ambiente de transac?a?o bilateral. Adicionalmente,

foram programados tre?s modelos de optimizac?a?o de lucro atrave?s do agendamento da pro-

duc?a?o de energia ele?ctrica, resultando num exerc??cio de programac?a?o moderado a elevado. Os

modelos contam com diferentes composic?o?es caracter??sticas de portfo?lios, tendo sido consid-

eradas carteiras de unidades produtivas exclusivamente te?rmicas, h??dricas e eo?licas e ainda

te?rmicas e eo?licas. Os tre?s modelos foram adicionados ao simulador ja? existente (MAN-REM).

Apo?s a ampliac?a?o das func?o?es do simulador, quer ao n??vel da interface, quer do co?digo

necessa?rio para possibilitar todas as suas funcionalidades e a compatibilidade com o software

ja? existente, este trabalho focou-se essencialmente na demonstrac?a?o dos modelos de optimiza-

c?a?o da produc?a?o adicionados ao simulador, de forma a analisar a sua resposta a diferentes

valores de entrada, nomeadamente a?s previso?es de prec?os de mercado em bolsa (necessa?rias

aos algoritmos de agendamento) e, assim, assegurar o seu correto funcionamento.

A formulac?a?o do primeiro caso de estudo, composto por duas simulac?o?es do mercado dia?rio

por cada exerc??cio de validac?a?o dos modelos testados, requereu, para as vinte e quatro horas

de um dado dia, a utilizac?a?o de um conjunto de perfis de consumo fixos, alocados a um grupo

de agentes comercializadores de energia ele?ctrica — retalhistas — assim como um outro con-

junto de ofertas de venda de energia, proveniente de um grupo de produtores de eletricidade,

de forma a dotar o mercado de uma competic?a?o significativa, tanto do lado da procura como

da oferta. Para cada um dos modelos, a primeira simulac?a?o de mercado contou com a partici-

pac?a?o de todos os agentes referidos — produtores e retalhistas — e de uma oferta de venda de

energia adicional proposta por um novo agente produtor (produtor-teste). Os vinte e quatro

prec?os relativos ao custo marginal de mercado, resultantes da simulac?a?o da primeira sessa?o,

foram enta?o utilizados como previso?es de prec?os do mercado pool do produtor-teste numa

segunda sessa?o de mercado, na qual as suas ofertas de venda de energia ele?ctrica, decorrentes

da sua atividade produtiva, foram sujeitas ao algoritmo de optimizac?a?o a ser validado. Desta

forma, a concorda?ncia de valores referentes aos volumes de energia ele?ctrica enviados para o

mercado nas primeira e segunda sesso?es pelo produtor-teste, permitiram atestar o funciona-

mento dos algoritmos de optimizac?a?o em estudo. De facto, os resultados dos testes realizados

x



revelaram uma boa coordenac?a?o entre as func?o?es-objectivo e as restric?o?es lo?gicas e te?cnicas

aos problemas a serem solucionados pelos tre?s modelos em estudo, sendo os dados finais co-

erentes com os resultados que seriam esperados.

De forma a utilizar as novas ferramentas disponibilizadas pelo MAN-REM para a demon-

strac?a?o da susceptibilidade dos prec?os de mercado em bolsa a? variabilidade intr??nseca a? pro-

duc?a?o de energia ele?ctrica de origem renova?vel, nomeadamente a partir do recurso eo?lico, e

dos seus reduzidos custos marginais, foi considerado outro caso de estudo. Deste modo, e

utilizando o mesmo grupo de agentes retalhistas do exerc??cio anterior, foram considerados

dois cena?rios antago?nicos no que respeita a?s condic?o?es atmosfe?ricas para produc?a?o renova?vel,

tendo sido analisados os efeitos da maior ou menor contribuic?a?o de energia eo?lica sobre o

prec?o marginal do mercado bolsista. Consequentemente, foi poss??vel verificar o efeito de re-

duc?a?o substancial dos prec?os marginais do mercado bolsista nas situac?o?es em que a produc?a?o

eo?lica varia?vel apresenta valores me?dios hora?rios acima da me?dia, corroborando o pressuposto

teo?rico de que tecnologias com menores custos de produc?a?o marginal contribuem para uma

maior eficie?ncia deste mecanismo de comercializac?a?o, na?o so? atrave?s de uma reduc?a?o do custo

da energia ele?ctrica em mercado por substituic?a?o de tecnologias mais dispendiosas, como tam-

be?m de um aumento do bem-estar social por efeito da majorac?a?o do volume total de energia

ele?ctrica a ser efetivamente negociado e transacionado em mercado.

Introduction

1.1 Contextualisation and Motivation

The electricity sector presents itself as a strategic area for both the economy and the sovereignty

of states, not only by its impact on services, but also by its importance on the daily life of

companies, industries and households. Therefore, it is expected that the optimisation and

improvement of e?ciency in the sector result in a relieving of energy costs — a powerful

contributor to the financial burden of almost all activities.

Electricity is mainly produced in large power plants, away from major centres of con-

sumption, typically in suburban and industrial areas, due to technical and economic reasons,

including availability of primary energy resources as well as infrastructural and environmental

constraints. The electrical energy produced in large plants is delivered to the transmission

system, consisting of high voltage power lines — the energy highways. Through transformers,

power flows from high to medium and low voltage distribution networks, and then to con-

sumers, the base of the electricity value chain.

Generation units vary with respect to size, production cost, technology, fuel, and the time

required to respond to orders of dispatch (i.e., the time elapsed from the moment when the

decision to generate electricity is taken and the moment when it is delivered to the grid).

From the point of view of both market and grid operators, units with more flexibility and

dispatch-ability represent higher value. Controlling such units o?ers the opportunity to adapt

production to instant consumption, maintaining equilibrium and ensuring the security of sup-

ply [1].

Regional geopolitics, geographical barriers and the availability of natural resources are nat-

ural shapers of the diversity and characteristics of electrical systems across the world. Given

that, the recent modernisation of electricity generation fleets (and related infrastructures) into

a renewables-based production towards a more sustainable power sector is often constrained

by the same factors as well as by cost and technical suitability of solutions.

1



Electricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets

The global introduction of renewables for mass electricity production, which became all

too apparent during the last twenty years, has embodied an attempt of countries to limit their

CO2 emissions — and meet the targets defined and signed at the last Conference of the Par-

ties, embodied in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals — as well as their risk

exposure to fuels price oscillations, which have proven significantly unstable due to several

phenomena, such as armed conflicts, cartelisation, price manipulation and economic wars.

Overall, this policy has led to an increased external independence of the primary energy’s

importing countries, promoting greater safety of supply. However, these deep changes in the

electrical systems, as they are being made, have also involved the rise of some consequent

issues that might disturb the balance and operational status quo of the electrical sector.

Abreast renewables’ deployment, investment on cleaner fossil-based technologies is a key-

alternative onto a more sustainable electricity system. As fossil fuels represented 65% of the

world’s electricity mix in 2015, the deployment of cleaner electricity production technolo-

gies assumes a clear and logical pathway towards the decarbonisation of the sector. IEA’s

forecasted scenarios for climate change mitigation, released under the “Energy Technology

Perspectives 2015” publication, stated that, under a 2-degrees scenario (2DS)1, in 2050, fos-

sil fuels will still play an important role, accounting 20% of the overall produced electricity,

whereas, considering a 6DS2, fossil fuels would remain stable and continue to lead as the

main source of electric generation. However, despite the considerable importance that hy-

drocarbons are expected to play, even in the 2DS, only 7% of the electricity produced by

fossil-fuelled thermal plants is generated by facilities without carbon capture and storage —

mainly gas-fired facilities with low capacity factors, running occasionally when renewables

balancing is necessary, which would allow an average CO2 intensity of about 40 gCO2/kWh

(533 gCO2/kWh in 2012). In order to achieve such ambitious goals, countries must start to

act and pave the way with strategic plans to contain and reduce greenhouse emission gases.

On the contrary, if a strong dependency on fossil fuels endures, leading to a 6DS, an average

CO2 intensity of 480 gCO2/kWh will be the most probable scenario, a completely contrasting

forecast when compared with what should be achieved to remain under the 2DS (see Figure

1.1).

1The 2-Degree Scenario (2DS) is the main focus of Energy Technology Perspectives. The 2DS lays out an
energy system deployment pathway and an emissions trajectory consistent with at least a 50% chance of limiting
the average global temperature increase to 2?C. The 2DS limits the total remaining cumulative energy-related
CO2 emissions between 2015 and 2100 to 1 000 GtCO2. The 2DS reduces CO2 emissions (including emissions
from fuel combustion and process and feedstock emissions in industry) by almost 60% by 2050 (compared with
2013), with carbon emissions being projected to decline after 2050 until carbon neutrality is reached [2].

2The 6-Degree Scenario (6DS) is largely an extension of current trends. Primary energy demand and CO2
emissions would grow by about 60% from 2013 to 2050, with about 1700 GtCO2 of cumulative emissions.
In the absence of e?orts to stabilise the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases, the average global
temperature rise above pre-industrial levels is projected to reach almost 5.5?C in the long term and almost
4?C by the end of this century [2].

Figure 1.1: Evolution of regional electricity generation mixes under the 2DS [2]

One of the main aspects of the undergoing global energy transition is the variable nature

of the production of new CO2-free technologies that are currently in great expansion. De-

spite the fact that significant deployment of technologies — such as wind and photovoltaic

— has indeed the power to reduce greenhouse gases’ emissions (GHG), the uncertainty that

characterises these energy sources, and hence their output, presents important and complex

challenges to the grid.

The second aspect concerns the decentralised nature of low- and medium-power produc-

tion facilities — small hydro, wind or solar photovoltaic — and their necessity to be often

installed in remote areas where optimised production can be achieved. Consequently, both

the scale and the scattered production raise significant challenges of interconnection to the

grid, making them more suitable to be connected to distribution networks rather than to

high-voltage lines [3].

The third aspect is related to the fugacity of market conditions: thermal-based electricity

generation is very dependent on financial and commodities markets, since fuel prices are the

main drivers which influence production costs. Therefore, dynamic prices of oil, gas or coal

induce significant changes on the generation unit’s merit order. The current panorama of

fuel prices, for instance, dictated by political and international relations, reveals an implosion

of coal prices over the past few years (Figure 1.2). This sharp fall is mainly caused by the

shale gas boom occurring intensively in the United States of America, where a significant

share of the internally produced and once consumed coal has now to be drained out to other

regions, ”flooding” the market. The e?ects of excess of coal in the market are being felt in

the Europe, as coal prices fell and remained significantly low during the last years. At the

Figure 1.3: Evolution of capacity factors of gas- and coal-fired power plants in Portugal (2000-2014) [6, 7]

same time, high regional prices of natural gas and geo-political conflicts whether in Eastern

Europe, Middle East or Northern Africa, have increased doubts and reticence among gas mar-

ket’s users, namely in the electricity production sector. Consequently, the pressure exerted by

low coal prices and the absence of an e?cient and strong carbon european market on other

technologies, particularly gas, have yielded perverse e?ects on the path towards the CO2-free

electricity generation targets and the environmental sustainability of European countries [4].

In fact, capacity factors of gas-fired power plants have been decreasing over the last few years

due to the growing installed capacity and decreasing generation shares. On the contrary, the

coal-fired capacity has seen its capacity factors rising (Figure 1.3). This reality results in

significant setbacks in terms of sustainability policies, a?ecting, most of all, the environment

and threatening the achievement of climate change mitigation goals, by increasing electricity’s

CO2 intensity.

Electricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets

All the mentioned conditions — price variation of primary energy sources, intermittent

production of most of the newly added (renewable) installed capacity and scattered generation

— are just some of the contributors which justify the development of computational systems

that allow specialists to study the dynamic of markets and allow market participants to foresee

and plan their actions in advance. Such tools, often called “market simulators”, can be part

of the necessary decision-taking process for the technical governance of utilities. Additionally,

and among others, these software tools provide invaluable support to study the impact that

di?erent technologies, such as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), battery storage banks or

pumping storage, may have on the market, being a source of knowledge on the behaviour of

marginal costs, generation units’ merit order and electricity market-clearing prices.

By using accurate self-scheduling models, producers are provided with invaluable help to

manage their unit portfolios in order to achieve their goals — profit maximisation, costs min-

imisation or others. At the same time, market simulators constitute an important platform

for researchers who try to adapt market rules, processes, and policies to a non-static reality.

Simulations, generally developed under multi-agent systems (MAS), provide an approxima-

tion to “real” decisions, and can be important to all market participants.

1.2 Objectives

The main objectives of this thesis are as follows3:

1. Study the existing models for electrical energy generation, namely those who seek a

proper market settlement towards the maximisation of profit;

2. Study the main energy markets, particularly the day-ahead market and the bilateral

contracts market;

3. Study the multi-agent simulator “MAN-REM”, which permits market participants to

enrol in energy transactions, negotiate bilateral agreements [8, 9], colligate with each

other [10], and manage the active role of consumers [11, 12];

4. Adopt some of the self-scheduling models referred in (1) and expand the existing version

of MAN-REM by developing and implementing computational agents which simulate

electrical energy producers, and whose operations are particularly based on those models;

5. Expand MAN-REM by adding market simulation functions for very-short over-the-

counter bilateral contracts clearing;

both FEDER and National funds through the program “COMPETE–Programa Operacional Tema?tico Factores
de Competividade” and “FCT–Fundac?a?o para a Cie?ncia e a Tecnologia”.

6. Develop a case study to demonstrate the functioning of the self-scheduling models added

to the MAN-REM;

7. Develop a case study regarding the trading of high renewable electricity levels on the

wholesale market and evaluate its impact on the day-ahead market prices;

1.3 Structure

This dissertation is divided into six chapters: Introduction, Liberalised Electrical Energy Mar-

kets and Multi-Agent Systems, Portfolio Optimisation and Self-Scheduling Models, MAN-REM

Extension, Production Scheduling - Case Studies and Conclusion. In the first chapter, one

can find a short introduction and contextualisation of this work as well as its main objectives

and the structure of this document.

The second chapter is entirely dedicated to a concise explanation of a broad range of topics

that were considered relevant to this work. Platforms for electricity trading, most common

maturity periods for its transaction, principal market agents and a summary of the Iberian

electricity market (MIBEL) regarding its composition, operation and challenges due to the

deployment of variable clean electricity generation technologies are also addressed.

The third chapter presents a selection of three optimisation models, developed for genera-

tion companies to self-schedule their production. The models will be added to the pre-existing

MAN-REM simulation software, increasing its features.

The fourth chapter presents an exhaustive description of the developments made to the

MAN-REM simulator, including all the JAVA-programmed windows, which constitute the

new interface, built to allow an user-friendly use of the software and its inherent markets.

The fifth chapter presents two case studies. The first is meant to demonstrate and analyse

the new features of the MAN-REM simulator by testing its response to several input data, and

the second to demonstrate (through a market simulation) the e?ect of high levels of variable

renewable penetration on the day-ahead electricity pool market prices.

Finally, conclusions arising from this study and suggestions for further work developments

and improvements to the MAN-REM software, regarding the simulation of electricity trading

under a liberalised electricity market, are present in the sixth chapter.

Liberalised Electrical Energy Markets and

Multi-Agent Market Simulators

Since the early times of the electricity sector, scale economies and transaction cost savings

achieved with vertical integrations favoured the emergence and establishment of natural mo-

nopolies. This sector was therefore controlled by single public or private companies, properly

regulated — since the 1980’s — by state agencies [13]. In Portugal, as in many other countries,

the four key-business components of the electricity sector (generation, transmission, distribu-

tion and retail) were owned by the same monopolist firm: Energias de Portugal (EDP).

Traditionally, power plants were run according to central dispatch directives which en-

sured the stability of the system. Regulated prices or tari?s have generally failed to signal

real generation costs, aiming above all, maximising social welfare and limiting the power held

by monopolists in the market, but disregarding the fundamental e?ciency and sustainability

of the industry and the correct remuneration of all interveners [14, 15].

The Electricity Pool of England and Wales appeared in 1990 as a first glance over the

coming reforms that started to occur across Europe and in the United States of America. To

replace the existing system, the British government designed a wholesale market, where all

generation companies could sell their output on the same terms [16]. Besides the maintenance

of the technical stability of the electric system, such solution also aimed the achievement of

a mandatory remuneration for the produced and consumed energy. Additionally, British au-

thorities wanted to help participants to schedule their market positions by setting conditions

to get more stable prices.

In fact, this decision has e?ectively led to significant competition in both generation and

supply sides, which was clearly demonstrated by a fall of the electricity prices to consumers of

above thirty percent [16]. As a result of this reformulation, the British model for the electricity

sector was followed in many other countries, and the pool platform became a symbol of the

liberalised market.

Electricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets

In 1996, the European Commission approved the first European Directive [17] for the

energy sector, embodying the will to liberalise its activities under the light of the above prin-

ciples. The Directive 96/92/EC has broaden the access conditions to networks and solved the

issue of determining the cost of transmission infrastructures. Standardised rules were also set

for production, transmission and distribution. The spirit of competition ensured that con-

sumers would be free to choose their electricity supplier and that new capacity should only

be allocated through authorisation or be awarded by tender [18].

The challenges posed by the liberalisation of the electricity sector are usually convergent:

to abolish barriers and dismantle old monopolies, design a new architecture for the sector’s

organisation and improve the allocation of resources to achieve an optimum, mainly comprised

of financial sustainability, improved social welfare and market e?ciency.

In this sector, the principle of dismantling vertically integrated activities into di?erent and

independent segments of the value chain emphasises three key-measures: decoupling activities

(unbundling), stimulating access to the grid by third-parties, and the creation of independent

regulatory authorities [18]. We should be aware that the switchover from regulated monopo-

lies to competitive markets, in which consumers have the possibility to choose their supplier

freely, does not mean only the increase of the number of operators [13]. Under this scenario,

the risk for producers increases (theoretically) but, at the same time, they get greater freedom

to establish their own strategies in order to maximise profits, taking into account, of course,

the behaviours of their competitors [13].

During the late 90’s, there was the conviction that developing a Single European Energy

Market would be a no easy task, given the wide variety of existing solutions in the Member

States and their variety of liberalisation degrees. Furthermore, the European geography also

presents specificities that do not facilitate the interconnection of networks: it consists of a cen-

tral core — France, Germany and Benelux — and peripheral regions — the UK and Ireland,

Scandinavia, the Italian Peninsula and the Iberian Peninsula. Weighted these constraints, it

seemed preferable to draw on the experiences of existing or arising regional markets and then,

from that point, start to build the Single European Energy Market. As a consequence of such

plan, the Portuguese Government proposed to the Spanish Government, in 2000, the creation

of a new regional electricity market, the MIBEL [18].

2.1 Considerations on Market Competition and Regulation

Energy markets, as many others, are independently regulated. Thereby, regulators are re-

sponsible for defining prices and tari?s that rule transactions between producers, retailers

and consumers. As a matter of fact, regulation entities may also act as supervisors, ensuring

that all actors comply to the existing rules, and punishing them otherwise. Traditionally,

state-regulated activities intent one of the following main purposes: intervention towards a

more e?cient market or promotion of a maximised social welfare through greater equity, sol-

idarity between individuals and regions, as well as guaranteeing basic social needs [19].

The relationship between cost and product valuation, made by consumers, is essential

to understand and evaluate the level of e?ciency of a market. Hence, the pure seeking of

e?ciency by gradually lowering the production cost of an asset is not the only condition to

achieve e?ective e?cient market conditions. In every single liberalised activity, the value of a

good or service is defined by the price consumers are willing to pay in order to adquire it. As

a consequence, the true value of an asset is dictated by the price paid for the last consumed

unit. This definition leads to the essence of the concept “market e?ciency”, which states that

a truly e?cient market is attained when consumers valuation of a good is equal to the exact

cost at which the producer incurs to produce it — often known as marginal production cost

[19].

2.1.1 Traditional Market Structures

Monopoly

For a long time, the electricity sector was ruled as a monopoly due to the idea that, despite

the absence of competition, it was the most e?cient operational market regime. Electricity

companies were vertically integrated, from production to retail. Some of them can still be

found across Europe, operating now in liberalised markets as former-monopolist companies:

EDP (Portugal), Enel (Italy), or EDF (France). A classic monopoly situation is achieved

when a market is composed by a single producer or a restricted group of producers acting

as a cartel. Such absence of real competition among producers was often regulated by an

independent agency in order to limit their market power over consumers and to guarantee

access to the population.

Oligopoly

An oligopolistic market is broadly defined as a restricted number of producers who are re-

sponsible for providing a certain good or service. Due to this limited range of service/good

providing companies, some of them hold significant influence on the market, which gives them

9



Electricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets

the power to continuously influence prices. Consequently, competition is mainly punctuated

by interaction strategies, not only with consumers, but most often with producers. This

market framework has been deeply studied since the nineteenth century and often modelled

by well known models such as Cournot’s or Bertand’s. The exercise of profit maximisation

made by producers operating in oligopolist markets gets more complex than that made by

monopolist companies. In fact, most of the times, the equilibrium situation for an oligopolist

market often results in lower prices [3, 20].

Perfect Competition

In order to exhibit characteristics of perfect competition, a market must guarantee one major

requirement: the existence of a range of both producers and consumers large enough to as-

sure that none of the market participants hold su?cient market power to influence prices and

quantities. This particular model also implies a perfect e?cient market, where marginal pro-

duction costs equal the price consumers are willing to pay, whereas in the long-run, marginal

costs should equal minimum average production costs. Following the above premises, it is

clear that a producer, in a perfectly competitive market, produces the exact quantity of a

good/service socially accepted, and thus, that consumers can absorb. Additionally, if long-

run convergence is achieved, producers are actually operating with minimum possible costs,

avoiding unnecessary waste and use of scarce resources.

2.2 Key Market Entities

The electricity market is comprised of several key entities who ensure that households, in-

dustry and services receive a proper electricity delivery service with considerable safety and

reliability:

Generation Companies (GenCos) are responsible for producing electrical energy and sell

it through the variety of trading mechanisms at their disposal. They can also provide a range

of ancillary services to the System Operator, helping this entitiy to maintain the electrical

balance of the grid, and consequently the security of the system. GenCos can also participate

in the market by buying energy to their competitors, whether for immediate delivery or to

cover eventual imbalance risks. Each company can own a single power plant or a portfolio

of producing units that, depending on the dimension, may provide the producer considerable

power to influence the market.

Transmission Companies are responsible for the operation, maintenance and development

of transmission lines, transformers and reactive compensation devices. Transmission compa-

10



Electricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets

nies often play the role of the Transmission System Operator. They are, by nature, the last

stronghold of former monopolies, due to the enormous costs inherent to the construction of a

transmission grid.

Distribution Companies own and are responsible for the operation of the distribution net-

work. Due to technical and financial constraints, and even in partially liberalised systems, the

distribution sector is hardly subject to competition. Such constraints are naturally related to

the need of having a physical grid for each competitor, which would greatly increase costs.

Retailers are entities responsible for the resale of the electricity bought from producers in

the wholesale market. Since they are non-supervisor actors who do not need to own physical

infrastructures to operate, retailers have proliferated in liberalised systems. These entities

buy electricity from generation companies and use — and pay a tax for — both transmission

and distribution lines in order to supply small customers, ‘’located” at the end of the chain.

Consumers are commonly categorised according to their level of consumption. Small con-

sumers include domestic consumers and small companies which means they do not possess

enough power to influence the market. Consumers in liberalised markets are free to choose the

retail company to whom they agree to buy electricity. On the other hand, large consumers,

due to their dimension and consumption volumes, can operate in the wholesale market and

buy electricity directly to generation companies. In general, large consumers represent large

industrial facilities that may be directly connected to the transmission network.

The Regulator is most commonly embodied by a government agency, responsible for en-

suring the e?ciency and transparency of all operations that occur within the sector.

The Transmission System Operator (TSO) is an independent actor responsible for run-

ning the last resort market and balancing demand and supply in real-time towards a secure

electrical system.

The Market Operator (MO) is responsible for managing both sale and purchase bids,

matching them and guaranteeing the proper course of all trading processes. However, for

-short and very-short horizon transactions, the Independent System Operator assumes the

leading role.

11



Electricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets

2.3 Trading Mechanisms

Distinct and simultaneous forms of power trading are common in deregulated markets, en-

suring a proper technical and economical operation of the electrical sector. Power producers

can bid in the spot market and/or engage in derivative contracts with buyers, setting a le-

gal contractual bond for future transactions. Generally, both methods may be adopted by

power producers to maximize their profits using the available market information. Consider-

ing the features of deregulated markets, it is essential that power producers develop generation

scheduling techniques and procedures that consider the technical characteristics of the power

plants’ portfolio, operation limits, production costs, maintenance costs and market behaviours

(e.g., electricity prices) to maximise their benefits [1, 21].

2.3.1 Spot Market

The spot market is defined by its immediacy, where sellers supply goods and buyers pay for

them with no reversibility of deals. As this market operates on a short-term horizon, both

buyers and sellers are able to adquire and o?er the exact amount of goods they need or have

available, respectively. Hereupon, scarcity of goods or sudden demand increase are rapidly

mirrored by higher spot prices, enhancing the considerable volatility of prices and quantities.

On the contrary, a rise of the ratio supply/demand will therefore lead to a fall of prices [22].

As discussed in [15], these interactions ultimately lead to an equilibrium set by prices or, in

other words, meeting supply and demand results in the transacted amount of a good and its

price.

Ideally, electricity spot markets should operate based on forecasts of both demand and

supply, where retailers — representing medium and small consumers — and large consumers

estimate their consumption for a given period in order to place their purchase bids. Likewise,

producers are responsible for setting their sale o?ers in order to fulfil a forecasted rate of con-

sumption, having always in mind its profit, mostly related to production costs. In fact, such

deterministic approach to the market cannot be applied, particularly in electricity trading.

Generation units obviously su?er form sudden failures, technical problems, maintenances or

other type of events that might originate unavailabilities. The same constraints are appli-

cable to transmission lines that connect the electricity generation level to the grid and all

the downstream infrastructures. Additionally, the fast deployment of intermittent electricity

production technologies with inaccurate forecasts regarding their production output exacer-

bates even more this problem. Consequently, and because demand is also hardly accurately

predictable, the rendering of a proper balance is specially hampered by limited and expensive

storage capacity of potencial energy in water reservoirs, batteries or through high-rampage

generation technologies, such as CCGT systems or more modern and flexible coal-fired power

plants [23].

Pool Market

The pool platform is a representative cornerstone of the liberalised electricity market philos-

ophy. The creation of this trading mechanism envisioned the establishment of a transparent,

e?cient, flexible and competitive wholesale market that could provide guarantees to produc-

ers, retailers and consumers. Although pool markets are very unusually adopted as trading

mechanisms in commodity markets, they are very well established in electricity systems. One

of the main features of a pool platform is the absence of a negotiation process between two

(or more) parties and, therefore, the transaction process occurs with absolutely no reliance on

iterative attempts to reach an agreement. Despite some circunstancial di?erences that may

be verified from one market to another, pool sessions usually follow the following procedures:

1. Generation companies submit selling bids for a certain amount of electrical energy at a

certain price;

2. Similarly, large consumers and retailers submit purchase orders, specifying both quan-

tities and prices they are willing to pay for each energy unit.

3. The market operator ranks both purchase and sale bids in order to get a purchasing-price

crescent curve and a selling-price decrescent curve, respectively (see Figure 2.1).

4. The intersection point of the two curves is computed by the market operator and re-

sults in the “market clearing point” (MCP), whose coordinates represent the “market

marginal price” (MMP) and the total tradable energy volume. Therefore, the market

operator accepts all generators’ o?ers which are bellow the MMP [24] and, consequently,

all GenCos located on the left side of the market clearing point see their production of-

fers accepted and are required to supply the proposed volumes of electricity. For the

sake of classification, o?ers to the market whose price is bellow the MMP are “in merit”.

Producers whose o?erings are on the right side of the intersection — “out of merit” —

will be excluded for the respective market’s spanning period.

From this point on, several versions of a pool auction may be found, depending on the

specific electricity market configuration. With regard to the o?ered prices by each generation

entity, two main variations may be encountered: in a price-based auction, generators can bid

at any price they find appropriated, whereas in a cost-based auction, prices should reflect the

inherent marginal costs of each particular unit. Similarly, a pool can also be di?erentiated

concept of market inelasticity and historical records, and hence all o?ers from producers are

cleared against this demand assumption, with no input contribution from buyers. On the

contrary, in a two-sided auction, the market operator’s dispatch is based on both buyer’s de-

manded quantity and the supply o?ered by sellers.

Finally, a pool platform can also operate according to two opposed remuneration philoso-

phies (Figure 2.2): in a single-price auction, “in merit” participants (buyers and sellers) pay

and are paid in accordance to the resulting market marginal price, whereas in a pay-as-bid

auction, “in merit” generators are paid the exact price they had individually submitted to the

market operator.

Both trading models have strengths and weaknesses. In pay-as-bid auctions, certain be-

haviours are more likely to occur in order to influence the MMP (upwardly). A classic situation

is observed when a generator who owns a power plant with a given marginal cost, knowing that

the forecasted MMP for the next auction is significantly higher than his marginal production

costs, bids at a selling price substantially above his marginal cost, having nearly the same

chances of getting his o?er accepted. As discussed in [15], a pay-as-bid scheme is often not

adopted because it discourages generators from placing o?ers that reflect their marginal costs.

GenCos would then try to guess the forthcoming MMP and would bid at that level of prices,

attempting to maximise their revenues. Also, in a pay-as-bid situation, the absence of a single

price to rule the purchase of an asset assumes a critical dimension when a price indicator is

needed whether for statistical ends or as a benchmark for setting bilateral contracts [1].

Ancillaries Market

As already discussed, the balance of the electrical system is of capital importance. Therefore,

in order to maintain the integrity of the system without compromising the electricity supply,

the transmission system operator (TSO) controls a set of balancing tools, which are gener-

ally categorised according to their timescale e?ectiveness. Spot markets usually comprise one

daily market — day-ahead — where participants bid their purchase and sale o?ers for the

next twenty-four hours. A smoother maintenance of this balance is achieved, over the day,

by the intraday market, thats aims to harmonise some natural fluctuations, allowing both

producers and consumers to adjust their positions.

Although minor momentaneous imbalances do not represent a major security issue, they

must be promptly detected and corrected, since frequency variations tend to weaken the sys-

tem, making it much less resilient to further technical complications that may occur, harming

its stability.

Such adjustments require the existence of a bench of backup units which can be “called”

to perform corrective actions on production. This reserve is often subdivided into “spinning

reserve” and “non-spinning reserve”. Spinning reserve is distinguished by its quick response,

which may vary up to ten minutes, and is fundamentally oriented for frequency services —

meant for constant frequency regulation. Therefore, and because of the haste these correc-

tions require, such generation facilities are commonly equipped with a governor system which

allows a direct and automated control of its power output by the ISO. On the other hand,

the non-spinning reserve consists of production units with lower response rates — up to sixty

minutes — and are specially designed to handle slower (but usually larger) fluctuations, par-

ticularly during intra-period oscillations — the following services.

2.3.2 Bilateral Contracts Market

Bilateral trading constitutes a mechanism for energy transactions where two parties negotiate

and get an agreement without the intervention of third-parties. In transactions via bilateral

contracts, almost all conditions — including price, time of delivery and energy volumes —

are dependent of the goals and concession tolerance of each intervenient in the negotiation.

Customised long-term bilateral contracts are flexible and negotiated privately to meet the

needs of both parties. They usually involve the sale of large amounts of power over long

periods of time due to large transaction costs associated with the negotiation of such contracts,

making them worthwhile only when the parties want to buy or sell large amounts of energy.

On the other hand, short-term bilateral contracts, celebrated within a short maturity horizon,

are classified as spot market operations and usually adopt one of the following concepts:

• Trading ’Over-the-Counter’ is a mechanism specially designed for the necessary adjust-
ments to eventual assumed positions through long-term agreements. Producers and

consumers can perform corrective actions to their previous perspectives for a given pe-

riod, towards an equilibrium between demand and supply. The nature of this market

makes it a low-volume energy transactions’ mechanism.

• Electronic Trading is an electronic platform where buyers and sellers can send their
o?ers to the market. Typically, each bid comprises four main features: order (purchase

or sale), period of delivery, energy amount and energy price. When a participant sends

an o?er to this computerised platform, the system seeks for other submitted o?ers that

may be matchable with it. If the matching happens to be impossible, the o?er is added

to a queue list, waiting for further o?ers that may clear it. The electronic trading is

commonly used for fine-tuning of the participants positions, some minutes before the

market closure.

Bilateral contracts evolved and greatly expanded over recent years. The MIBEL, as well

as other electricity markets, is an example of the increasing relevance that bilateral contracts

have to market participants. Besides the main goal of risk-reduction, BC present also some

positive collateral e?ects [25], as providing greater stability in spot markets, and the curtail-

ment of potential market power situations and reduction of demand fluctuations. Although

pool markets and BC are distinct mechanisms of trading, they are naturally related and can

be used to take advantage from price variations and market speculation, providing an extra

source of income. Energy bought in the pool market can satisfy the bilateral deals assumed

by the producer, if such prices prove to be lower than the inherent marginal costs for energy

production. Similarly, if a producer holds a position benefiting from bilaterally contracted

power, he might find it financially beneficial to resell part of this power in the pool, aiming

at obtaining a significant profit [25].

16

2.3.3 Derivatives Market

The mitigation of possible harmful e?ects from sudden changes in market conditions has led

to the appearance of derivative products, which induce more predictability and reduce risk

exposure. These instruments are most commonly found as legal private transaction contracts

establishing agreed quantities and negotiated prices for a certain asset. In fact, some of these

contracts can be highly complex, to a point that contracted quantities and prices may vary

hourly or according to existing intraday tari?s [26].

The market transactions can be physical or purely financial. On one hand, financial trans-

actions are cash-settled, with the cashflows calculated through formulas referencing energy

prices established in di?erent markets (and possibly other prices and variables). On the other

hand, physical transactions require the delivery of physical electricity, for instance spot trans-

actions are, by definition, physical transactions. These transactions are often structured using

the templates developed for the financial markets, including swaps and options [1]. Some of

the most vulgar derivatives mechanisms are presented and briefly explained below:

• Forward contracts are one of the simplest derivative mechanisms and involve agreements
on energy volumes and prices, for future transaction events, on previously scheduled de-

livery dates. Further details are also usually safeguarded, such as energy quality and

penalties for default. Therefore, this tool allows two parties to set an agreed price of a

given volume of energy, capping eventual losses which may occur in future pool market

sessions, if the evolution is not favourable. For instance, if a buyer is trying to prevent

the e?ects of an eventual price escalade, he might be willing to pay a higher amount

than the current energy price in order to reduce his exposure to price variations. This

di?erence between the expected pool price and the contracted price is often called the

“premium”, and reflects the price producers are willing to pay in order to have pre-

dictable and controlled selling prices over a given period of time. When contracts are

signed, buyers assume a “long position”, while sellers take on a “short position” [15, 27].

• Options contracts can be materialised as “call options” or “put options”. A call option
defines the allocation of a buying right of a certain asset at a certain price (strike-price)

to its holder, whereas the owners of a put option detain the legal right to sell their

asset according to the conditions stated on the contract [27]. Contracts can be designed

considering a single-day execution date (“European options”) or over a ranging period

with a given expiration date (maturity) (“American options”).

17



Electricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets

• Future contracts assume themselves, in the energy market landscape, as an opportunity
for non-energy firms to take advantage from the considerable volatility of prices in en-

ergy markets. Future contracts do not carry any physical delivery of energy associated

and, therefore, contribute only for market speculation. Accordingly, speculators buy

and sell “paper energy”, trying to profit with future price oscillations that may occur

before reaching the maturity expiration date. Since some of the participants enrolled in

futures are neither consumers nor producers, as the date of delivery approaches, contract

holders have to balance their position in the physical market (either buying or selling).

• Contracts for Di?erences ( CfD’s) are purely financial-driven contracts, not involving
any physical transaction of electrical energy, and used to mitigate the exposure to price

variations. The two subscribers of a CfD agree upon a strike-price for the thereafter

traded energy. Consequently, both parts have the legal right to be compensated by each

other whenever they sell/buy energy at a lower/higher price than the agreed strike-price

[28].

2.4 E?ect of Renewables on the Electricity Spot Market

Currently, at a time when the penetration of renewable energy technologies is already ex-

tremely relevant in many countries (see Figure 2.3), another phenomenon arising from the

mass production of “non-conventional” intermittent electricity has undergone a deep study

and some discussion: the influence that non-dispatchable technologies — wind and solar in

particular — have on electricity market prices [29, 30].

In pool markets, as explained in detail in Section 2.3, market operators aggregate pur-

chase and sale o?ers, previously submitted by buyers and sellers, sorting them according to

a meritocratic hierarchy which sets the price and amount of the electricity traded. From the

time when this mechanism was primordially designed, in the early 1990’s, until now, reality

has being severely changing due to renewables deployment [31].

At the origin of these changes is the sorting logic of production units: based on operational

expenditures (OPEX) — very dependent on the cost of fuels and susceptible to rapid changes

in extraordinarily limited time periods. Thus, marginal costs of fuel-fired power plants are

closely related to the price of commodities in the market, being possible to establish a link

between the evolution of the plants’ operating costs and the price of fuels.

18



Electricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets

Figure 2.3: Annual wind power installation in the EU (2004-2014) [29]

Contrary, costs from photovoltaic or wind technologies are mainly influenced by capital

expenditures (CAPEX), due to the large initial investments needed for construction and lim-

ited capacity factors. Given that, the OPEX of wind projects can be considered a minor cost

in comparison to its CAPEX, particularly due to “free fuel” [32].

The combination of this bidding selection process with the fact that the marginal costs of

wind or PV generation are considerably lower, led — over the years — to a change of the tradi-

tional shape of the supply curve. Despite frequent assumptions of null marginal costs for wind

power production, it is essencial to account operation and maintenance variable costs (O&amp;amp;M)

which include predictive maintenance — activities performed on equipments expected to fail

soon, typically based on the results of condition based monitoring — and corrective mainte-

nance — performed to repair equipments that are damaged or underperforming. Depending

on the literature and also on the specific characteristics of each electric grid, estimations of

marginal costs may vary considerably [33, 34], being estimated to range up to 12 e/MWh.

Moreover, costs arising from the integration of this type of technology into the electricity

system were also considered and comprise [35]:

• Additional system reserve costs:

– Additional requirements for instantaneous and frequency keeping reserves;

– Additional requirements for scheduling reserve;

• Additional system generation capacity costs;

• Transmission constraints and reinforcement costs driven by wind power.

Hence, total wind power marginal costs were estimated below 14 e/MWh.

19



Electricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets

Through the following historical data records of three “characteristic days”, one can in-

stinctively understand the referred e?ect of wind production in MIBEL pool prices: the

22thApril, 2013 — medium wind production (Pav = 1 483 MW) —, the 8
thDecember, 2013 —

low wind production (Pav = 64 MW) — and the 4
thJanuary, 2014 — high wind production

(Pav = 2 950 MW).

Figure 2.4 illustrates a medium wind production day with an average hourly output of

1 483 MW, whereas Figure 2.5 illustrates a low wind-based electricity generation characteristic

day with an average hourly output of sixty-four megawatt, and Figure 2.6 depicts a high wind

production day with an average output of 2 950 MW — corresponding to capacity factors of

about 1.3%, 32.0% and 65.0% of the Portuguese installed capacity, respectively [7].

By analysing Figures 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6, it turns easier to understand the subjacent e?ect of

high wind production — whose marginal costs are below of any other traditional technology.

High wind production, here represented by Figure 2.6, causes a shift of the traditional capacity

to the right-side of the MCP (assuming an electricity market where demand is approximately

inelastic). Examining the changes induced by the introduction of wind production, a major

e?ect is easily distinguishable: a decline of the marginal market price. This e?ect is often

known as “merit of order e?ect” [36].

By comparing both annual maximum and minimum wind generation days, the correlation

between wind production and pool prices is even more evident: while on the 8th December,

with very low wind production output, hourly prices in MIBEL ranged from 83.4 e/MWh

to 111.0 e/MWh, on the 4th January, the high production output from wind farms led to

extremely low pool prices in the Iberian market, ranging from 0.0 e/MWh to 19.0 e/MWh.

An intermediate case, represented by the case of 22th of April, shows an average production

situation where the outcoming prices were around 25.0 e/MWh.

Through this example (not necessarily simplistic), it can be concluded that wind power

contributes for considerable energy cost savings. Therefore, it follows that a substantial pres-

ence of wind technologies in the market may lead to increased overall e?ciency of the pool

mechanism, resulting in a significantly lower MMP [36, 37].

However, despite going beyond the scope of this work, it should be emphasised that this

economy — due to lower pool prices — may not be a net gain for consumers and, hence,

it should be holistically analysed. Some studies were carried out on this matter with the

intention of finding out whether there is a net benefit from the socio-economical optimisation

perspective arising from high penetration of wind power, being many of them contradictory.

In a study, Azofra et al. [40] essentially focus on the Spanish electricity generation system,

and conclude that, despite the feed-in tari?s guaranteed to renewable energy producers —

indirectly supported by consumers — the significant reduction of the market marginal price

results in significant savings for consumers.

On the other hand, Mulder et al. [41] focused on the Dutch electricity market and con-

cluded that the reduction of the electricity retail price is not necessarily an evidence, since a

clear gain for the consumers cannot be admitted. However, this study admits the possibility

that the low preponderance of renewable technologies in the Dutch electrical production sys-

tem might be the cause of such ine?ectiveness.

2.5 The Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL)

The Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL) results from the cooperation of the Portuguese and

Spanish Governments, aiming to promote a better integration of both countries’ electrical

systems. Its significant contribution for the establishment of an integrated electricity market,

not only at the Iberian level but, also at the European scale, is an important step to take on

the pathway towards the envisioned “energy union” [42].

This market was fully launched on 1st July 2007 and is subdivided into two main poles: the

OMIE — from the Spanish side — and the OMIP — from the Portuguese side. Despite the

fact that MIBEL is an unified electricity market, the OMIE takes responsibility for the spot

market clearance, whereas the OMIP ensures the management of the bilateral agreements,

including forwards, futures and options.

The joint regulation of the Iberian electricity market is operated by “ERSE - Entidade

Reguladora dos Servic?os Energe?ticos” and “CMVM - Comissa?o do Mercado de Valores Mobil-

ia?rios”, in Portugal, and by “CNE - Comisio?n Nacional de Energ??a” and “CNMV - Comisio?n

Nacional del Mercado de Valores” in Spain.

Regarding the transmission industry, the Iberian market is composed by two major com-

panies, the “REN - Rede Ele?ctrica Nacional” and the “REE - Red Ele?ctrica de Espana?”, which

22



Electricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets

are also responsible for the market operation. Distribution is, in Portugal, guaranteed by the

monopolist company “EDP - Energias de Portugal” whereas in Spain, regional monopolist

companies such as Union Fenosa, Endesa, Iberdrola and HC Energia are the providers of this

service.

2.5.1 Market Organisation

Currently, the OMIE manages day-ahead and intraday transactions as well as real-time trans-

actions for Portugal and Spain. As this is a joint market, bids from both Portuguese and

Spanish sellers and buyers are aggregated and cleared in single auctions. This method often

leads to uniform electricity pricing on both sides. However, despite the fact that all o?ers to

the market are handled disregarding their origin, it is still not unusual to witness disparities

among Portuguese and Spanish spot prices. Price decoupling and its consequent price spread

is mostly caused by the exhaustion of the transmission capacity between territories, leading

to nodal regional prices (see Figure 2.8).

The day-ahead and intraday markets represent the two main mechanisms for energy trans-

action in the spot market, organised by the OMIE. The day-ahead regime allows both buyers

and sellers to trade energy according to their perspectives of demand loads and renewables

production forecasts. Procedures for a regular pool market auction start with a twelve-hour

advance from the beginning of the next day, meaning that supply- and demand-side agents

must communicate their market actions to the market operator until 12:00h of the previous

day (d-1)

Producers and retailers place their selling and buying bids, which are then arranged ac-

Figure 2.7: Day-ahead and intra-day market sessions [42]

23



Electricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets

cording to the proposed prices and used to draw the demand and supply curves [1, 24, 43].

However, due to natural oscillations either on the demand and supply sides or to unforeseen

technical constraints, additional trading platforms with much shorter maturities provide es-

sential adjustment services, smoothing the e?ects of sudden events.

The intraday adjustment tool is provided by the market operator and comprises six daily

sessions where buyers and sellers can adjust their positions to the real course of both demand

and supply (Figure 2.7):

• 1st Session — closes at 20.00h of day d ? 1 and clears the market for the remaining four
hours of day d ? 1 and for the next 24 hours of day d;

• 2nd Session — closes at 00.00h of day d and clears the next 24 hours of day d;

• 3rd Session — closes at 5.00h of day d and clears the market for the next 20 hours of
day d;

• 4th Session — closes at 8.00h of day d and clears the market for the next 17 hours of
day d;

• 5th Session — closes at 12.00h of day d and clears the market for the next 13 hours of
day d;

• 6th Session — closes at 16.00h of day d and clears the market for the next 9 hours of day d.

In addition to the spot market platforms for electricity trading made available by the

Spanish pole of the MIBEL (OMIE), the Iberian Energy Derivatives Exchange, through the

OMIP, provides a large set of derivative products such as futures, swaps, forwards and options.

A wide number of contractual products with di?erent specificities allows traders to negotiate

in maturity periods ranging from days, weeks, months, up to quadrenniums. Characteristics of

such contractual bonds, physical and financial, are extensively described stating, for example,

whether a contract concerns base-load or peak period energy, tick volumes or the method of

cash payments [44].

2.5.2 Market Main Indicators

The Iberian Peninsula and, therefore, the MIBEL, are fairly well equipped with intracon-

nections linking Portugal and Spain. However, they are still quite regionally isolated and

far from the interconnection ratios commonly found across central and northern Europe: in-

terconnections with Morocco and France amount 2.4% of the overall MIBEL’s generation

capacity, constraining exchange operations with neighbouring markets and making it impos-

sible to export wind power generation surplus. Because a proper market union can only be

24



Electricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets

fully achieved under a scenario of comfortable net interconnection capacity to accommodate

transactions defined by the market, intra- and interconnection developments have been one

of the main consensuses among national authorities and the European Commission. In fact,

improved MIBEL’s intraconnections — connecting Portugal and Spain — have decreased the

e?ect of price decoupling (Figure 2.8) and increased the price-coupling between these two

countries, reducing significantly the number of hours when locational prices were registered.

Accordingly, 97.6% of price-coupling in the day-ahead market was registered in 2015.

The Iberian generation system is naturally composed by the sum of the installed capacity

in the two Iberian countries. By the end of 2014, this overall capacity rounded 125 595 MW,

with a contribution of 19 125 MW from the Portuguese side and 106 470 MW from the Span-

ish side [7].

Despite the recent deployment of CO2-free electricity generation technologies, combustible

fuels still play an important role in MIBEL, with a capacity share of 46.1% (2014), signifi-

cantly comprised by coal and natural gas facilities. A closer look at the evolution of generation

capacities unveils a consistent growth of natural gas. Coal and gas usage is highly variable in

the Iberian countries due to their direct dependence on renewable production to meet demand

and, therefore, on wet and/or windy years.

Improvements on hydro capacity were a must regarding the safety of the grid’s manage-

ment and balance. Pumping capacity in the Iberian countries represented 13.9% of the peak

demand and 23.6% of the overall wind capacity in 2014 [7]. Portugal’s pumping capacity

has registered a growth of 57.0%, representing 24.8% of the overall hydro capacity in 2014.

According to [45], the Portuguese authorities plan to add 1 837 MW of new hydro capacity

by 2017 — including 1 295 MW of reversible capacity — and an additional capacity of 1 100

MW (reversible) by 2022.

Wind generation is high in Portugal and Spain due to the optimal resource conditions:

MIBEL’s wind capacity was significantly deployed, growing 213.8%, from 8 870 MW in 2004

to 27 831 MW in 2014, and accounting for 21.9% of the overall capacity and 59.9% of the

peak demand capacity (2014).

Portugal and Spain have considerably su?ered with the outbreak of the European finan-

cial crisis in the late 2008 — and subsequent economic cool down and shrinkage — and have

registered a significant fall on electricity demand since then (8.1%). This situation, enhanced

by a decoupling of some level between the economic growth and the energy consumption,

has increased even more the representativity of variable generation, meaning solar and wind

25



Electricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets

Figure 2.8: Implications of interconnection capacity on MIBEL’s price coupling (19Jan2013 - 25Jan2013) [5]

power production shares (4.3% and 19.5% in 2014).

Renewables, particularly wind and solar power, have been specially deployed in European

countries. In 2014, Portugal (25.4%) and Spain (21.6%) were the World’s leaders on wind

penetration, right after Denmark. Production variability is managed by relying on hydro

pumping and gas-fired capacity to constantly balance the production.

Also in 2014, the electricity generated in Portugal from wind reached 22.9% and was the

second largest contributor for electricity supply after hydropower. On its turn, Spain’s elec-

tricity generation registered a 18,8% contribution from wind, making it the third main source

of generation after hydro and nuclear power. On the other hand, solar capacity for electricity

production has registered a 113.8% growth, reaching 7 502 MW in 2014. However, only 5.5%

of this capacity is located in Portugal. In 2014, solar power contributed with 4.3% of the

generated electricity in the MIBEL region [6].

Despite the fact that the pool day-ahead market is the trading mechanism by excellence in

a liberalised market, the great majority of energy transactions in both countries through the

MIBEL were traded via derivatives market. This situation is highly comprehensible since no

producer nor consumer wants to be at the mercy of pool price fluctuations and, consequently,

setting bilateral agreements with other parties, with controllable strike-prices, reduces opera-

tion risks [5].

At the same time, we have been assisting to a downward trend on MIBEL’s daily average

prices, as well as to the convergence between Portuguese and Spanish prices — which has only

been possible because of the reinforced net capacity between both countries [39].

2.6 Agents and Multi-Agent Systems

Agent-based modelling and simulation (ABMS) is a relatively new approach of modelling com-

plex systems composed of interacting, autonomous agents. Agent-based systems may contain

two or more agents, constituting multi-agent systems. Moreover, a typical agent-based system

stands on three main pillars: agents, interactions and the environment.

An agent is defined by its capacity to act autonomously, meaning it can act on its own,

responding to the environment, without the intervention of humans or other agents. Au-

tonomous agents are responsive, meaning that they should perceive their environment and

consequently respond to changes that may occur in it. They can also be pro-active, since

their goal-seeking nature doesn’t allow them to assume a simply reactive posture, being able

to exhibit opportunistic behaviour and take the initiative. Generally speaking, agents are

individuals that interact with their peers and even with humans, in order to complete their

own problem solving [46].

Despite the above, some agents may be created with only a reactive purpose, which means

that such individuals interact by making no use of historical or learning processes, responding

27



Electricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets

exclusively to impulses from the environment [47].

Agents interact according to their portfolio of pre-designed possible actions, which may

influence their environment (Figure 2.10). However, those actions may be subject to prelimi-

nary conditions, which ensure that the agents can e?ectively proceed in specific ways. Hence,

the actions of an agent are often associated with pre-conditions which define the possible

situation where they can be applied [47]. The mutual interaction among agents characterises

social systems, where individuals are influenced and learn the other’s actions, and adapt their

behaviours to be more harmonised with the environment. Interactions between agents can

range in a variety of natures [46]:

• Cooperation — agents assume a partnership that can take them to their common aim;

• Coordination — agents organise a problem solving activity in order to avoid harmful
interactions and to exploit beneficial ones;

• Negotiation — agents define a set of conditions that must be agreed by all in order to
come to an agreement.

Negotiation is a bulk issue when it takes to agents interactions. When in a negotiation

situation, agents must be designed to be able to solve di?erences and conflicts through ne-

gotiation towards a good coordination of their activities. In multi-agent systems, negotiation

requires that agents participate in a hole of chained actions which might permit a conflict

resolution. Agents, therefore, prepare and plan their negotiation interactions. Secondly, they

should generate, evaluate and exchange o?ers with its pairs and then, if possible, come to an

agreement with the involved parties. The demand for an agreement between parties leads to

the development of negotiation strategies which are supposed to lead to a beneficial agree-

ment that can be as closer as possible of the agent’s initial goals. According to [48], those

behaviours can be mainly categorised as Concession Making and Problem Solving.

The first is a characteristic behaviour of an agent who possesses a given concession factor,

which defines its willingness to sacrifice part of its initial goals, reducing its aspirations, to-

wards a consensus among the intervenient parties. On the other hand, the second behaviour

is typical of an agent who assumes a more interesting posture regarding its primordial aims,

maintaining its goals and aspirations and confining itself to conciliate them with others’ aspi-

rations.

Agent-based modelling is widely used in a large variety of areas, ranging from stock mar-

kets and supply chains, to predicting the spread of epidemics and the threat of bio-warfare,

via understanding the fall of ancient civilisations to modelling engagement of forces on bat-

tlefields or at sea [49]. Pedestrian crowd movements, transportation infrastructures, financial

28

markets, cell behaviours, population dynamics and even markets that do not exist yet, are also

commonly studied and tested through agent-based systems. Such models can be developed

using specific software toolkits (e.g. JADE). General programming languages, such as Python,

JAVA and C++, can also be used with the advantage of providing specific capabilities for

modelling agents [50].

2.6.1 Multi-Agent Simulators for Energy Markets

This subsection introduces some of the existing multi-agent simulators namely, EMCAS,

SEPIA, MASCEM and AMES.

EMCAS

The Electricity Market Complex Adaptive System (EMCAS) simulator was developed

by researchers from the Argonne National Laboratory (US Department of Energy) with

the aim to study the evolution of the electrical system, consequences of competition on

the variation of market prices as well as to assess operational limits and security criteria

of the grid [51].

The EMCAS allows one to simulate the behaviour of agents enrolled in several types

of electricity markets, such as the pool market and the bilateral contracts market, and

constrains their activities according to eventual operational limitations of the system.

Producers, consumers, distributers, market operators, the independent system operator

29



Electricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets

and transmission entities are all represented by agents who are able to adapt their be-

haviour in order to achieve success or avoid prior failures as well as to make decisions,

learn and adapt their strategies (e.g. biding strategies) to the environment based on

historical records [52, 53]. In fact, this simulator is widely used by real-world companies

across the globe, being used, for instance, by REN - Rede Ele?ctrica Nacional, to study

and analyse the MIBEL.

SEPIA

SEPIA, standing for Simulator for the Electric Power Industry Agents, is a tool designed

by Honeywell Technology Center and the University of Minnesota specifically oriented

to bilateral contracts for trading electricity. Similarly to others, this an agent-based

tool that aims to analyse the behaviours of all participants in the electricity market.

SEPIA requires power specifications (generation and load), determines the operational

limitations of the system and foresees eventual discrepancies on the security criteria that

have been defined. Agents aim to model physical entities such as producers, consumers

and system operators. Consumer agents define and provide their load profiles, stating

the amount of electrical energy they are willing to buy, and interact with generation

agents in order to define the contractual terms and conditions for the trade, such as

price and quantity. Once both parties agree upon a specific contract, their decision is

sent to the system operator, who is responsible for checking whether this transaction

can be physically accomplished within the boundaries considered acceptable to run the

electric grid safely [51].

MASCEM

Developed by the Grupo de Investigac?a?o em Engenharia do Conhecimento e Apoio a?

Decisa?o (GECAD) of the Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto (ISEP), the MA-

SCEM simulator is a JAVA-based multi-agent simulator. Being a software to support

decision-making, the MASCEM allows users to evaluate agents’ decisions, on di?erent

markets, particularly on pool market and bilateral contracts. Agents’ modelling of pro-

ducers, consumers, retailers, market operators, system operators and facilitators (whose

function is to coordinate and supervise simulations) is based on artificial intelligence [54].

Simulations may occur according to di?erent bidding strategies such as time-wise dy-

namic strategies, strategies dependent on other agents’ behaviours, historical market

records and historical agents’ decisions records [55].

suggestion for the restructuring of the wholesale electricity market in 2013 [56]. AMES

is an open-source software developed under the JAVA programming language where

agents, particularly producers, possess learning skills. This simulator runs the whole-

sale electricity market for a predefined period of time with a minimum scale of one hour

which allows to reduce forecast errors induced by the volatility of prices inherent to an

electricity market. The software comprises generation agents (GenCos), retail agents

(LSEs) and the system operator.

GenCos are assumed profit-seekers and exclusive sellers, which means that, unlike in the

real world, electricity producers cannot buy electrical energy in the market. Learning

capacities and generation technologies are an input to this simulator — allowing to de-

termine production costs that are sent to the system operator whenever a GenCo bids in

the market. Such marginal costs can be presented in the form of a costs curve above the

real costs of the producer, a behaviour that is typically observed when generators want

to reduce risk exposure and maximise profits. Declaring a generation capacity below

their real one is also a mechanism used by GenCos to lead to higher market prices [57].

The Load-serving entities (LSEs), or in other words the retailers are, unlike GenCos,

unable to learn. They aim to satisfy their demand for electrical energy by sending buy-

ing o?ers to the system operator with respect to the twenty-four hours of the next day.

The system operator (OS) is responsible for managing the wholesale energy market, seek-

ing, above everything else, to maximise the global gain of the system, which is defined as

Total Net Surplus in the AMES software. After receiving the GenCos’ and LSEs’ o?ers

for the next day (D+1), the OS determines the prices of each of the twenty-four intervals.

Portfolio Optimisation and Self-Scheduling

Models

The following suggested deterministic models describe three di?erent ways of computing op-

timised selling settlements of GenCo’s production depending on the nature of their portfolios.

Since all considered methods maximise the overall profit over a given period, they require

similar input data:

• Technical specifications of all units owned by a producer, in order to properly schedule
production within the technical limits of each power plant and considering specific costs

of each particular running decision;

• Day-ahead pool prices’ forecast for the considered period;

• Purchase and sale prices forecast for bilateral contracts;

• Forecasted data for hydro and wind power generation units comprised of hourly water
inflows in hydro reservoirs and the hourly wind production, respectively, in order to

better estimate an eventual production and its selling settlement.

The considered energy market’s framework is comprised of two general platforms where

GenCos can participate and try to achieve the best profit possible by trading their produced

energy. Specifically, producers are free to sell their production output in the pool and/or

through bilateral agreements with retailers and large consumers. As a matter of fact, a pro-

ducer can even buy electrical energy bilaterally and, by doing so, take advantage of an eventual

rise in pool prices, by trying to resell the energy bought bilaterally in the pool, with potential

net financial gain.

In real energy markets, GenCos may need to buy energy to competitors — whether in a

pool or through bilateral contracts — in order to cap its risk exposure to external unexpected

events, or even to guarantee the supply of a percentage of contractual obligations arising from

long-term contracts. Despite the adherence to reality of such scenarios, neither long-term

33

Figure 3.1: Input and output data of the considered scheduling models

contracts nor risk management are considered in the following models.

The output data made available by the models is transversal to all of them. Hence, by

computing the scheduling of a portfolio, GenCos will have at their disposal the best scenarios

for production settlement, meaning the proposed energy volume to be sold in the pool and

the second and third lots of energy that are proposed to be sold and bought through bilateral

contracts. A commitment status of each individual unit is also determined as well as their

hourly production output (see Figure 3.1).

Depending on the chosen scheduling model, more technical specification details may, or

may not, be used to optimise more accurately the production and its settlement towards the

best profit. Hereupon, further details on individual approaches to the described problem will

be discussed below.

3.1 Thermal Portfolio Model

Although clean electricity production technologies have been the recent focus of the great

majority of countries, thermal generation units still play an important role in the electric-

ity sector. Particularly, coal-fired — but also gas- and oil-fired — power plants have always

been considered base-load units, due to their higher operational inertia, which did not allow

big generation fluctuations, due to high start-up and shut-down costs, slow output power

rampages, considerably high minimum production levels and high fixed costs. However, de-

spite the so called “green policies”, it is common thinking that fossil fuels, and thus thermal

power plants, still have a crucial importance to play in the medium-and long-term future, as

balancing agents of the electric system, and as the market continues to be flooded with vari-

34



Electricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets

able renewable production. Hence, further technological research has to continue to provide

this generation systems with higher flexibility and, naturally, lower costs, when operating as

backup units.

The following model suggests one way of determining an optimised market settlement

of electrical energy, for a generation company, on both bilateral and pool markets, towards

the best possible revenue, from a given production portfolio composed by a set of thermal

fossil-fuelled power plants. Such method is based on the deterministic approach formulated

by Conejo et al. [58].

Based on an input of forecasted market prices — for both pool and bilateral markets —

and on technical specifications of each generation unit, the model computes the best produc-

tion scheduling for a given portfolio, including the best commitment for each unit and its

hourly electricity production output. Additionally, an optimisation for market settlement is

computed, providing the GenCo with the best bidding scenario towards a maximised profit.

The objective function (3.1) reflects the sum of the revenues for a given period of time, minus

the sum of all costs for the same period:

The profit optimisation function is obtained by summing the revenues arising from both

selling a variable quantity (VPool) of electricity in the pool and selling a variable volume

V SaleBilateral via bilateral contracts. Additionally, all costs derived from electricity production

(?P ) and eventual bilateral acquisitions (V PurchaseBilateral ) must be deducted. Constraints (3.2) to

(3.8) ensure several technical limits as well as the logic dimension of all variables, and conse-

quently the proper operation of the model and consistency of its output results.

Constraints (3.3) and (3.4) state that the power output limits of each individual thermal

unit should be bounded by its minimum and maximum technical output. Constraints (3.5)

and (3.6) define volume limits for the energy produced by unit i during hour t sold in the

pool market. Volumes of energy bought and sold through bilateral contracts are delimited by

equations (3.7) and (3.8). Therefore, V SaleBilateral and V
Purchase
Bilateral must be, individually, less than

or equal to overall name-plated power owned by the GenCo. This imposed limit aims a better

distribution of the power settlement on both bilateral and pool markets.

Contrary to pool prices, sale and purchase prices for bilaterally agreed contracts do not

vary on an hourly basis, but according to settled contract periods. Likewise, contracted vol-

umes assume the same value along this tari?, meaning that contracted power volumes should

be respected by both buyers and sellers until the the contracted period is expired — a time

when the two parties can negotiate and enrol in newly-agreed volumes for the next tari? pe-

riod span.

The model also considers a mechanism to replicate the high volatility and low liquidity

that characterises bilateral markets [58]. The accumulation of purchase or sale energy blocks

is then discouraged by gradually less favourable prices. As the producer accumulates buying

or selling blocks, his profit margin decays due to the decrease of the profitability of both selling

and buying blocks.

3.2 Thermal and Wind Portfolio Model

Coordination between electricity generation technologies is more and more a key issue to

secure a reliable electrical grid. Massive wind power production, that has become a reality

worldwide, still lacks some reliability, and thus thermal power plants need to assist the system

with backup services, balancing the grid whenever necessary. Costs of this cooperation must

be taken into consideration since the greater share of thermal power capacity is still quite re-

36



Electricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets

silient to variability, having been built to provide a continuous and stable output production.

Hence, when used to operate under a di?erent generation regime, a careful management of

his portfolio should be done by every generation company in order to safeguard eventual risks

and financial losses arising from a deficient planning and/or operation of an infrastructure.

The following model suggests a scheduling optimisation method in order to maximise prof-

its of portfolios comprised of thermal and wind generation technologies. Similarly to Section

3.1 and to the next Section 3.3, this section considers a deterministic scheduling settlement-

oriented model, which aims to provide the best bidding solution in both bilateral and pool

markets, and at the same time, adjusting production scheduling. Furthermore, this computa-

cional design is based on the Combined Unit Commitment and Emission (CUCE) problem [59].

By considering such a hybrid portfolio, this model can be an invaluable tool, since it

permits to schedule the production of each producing unit, individually, while minimising

the greenhouse gases (GHG) emission and, therefore, avoiding to the maximum the inherent

taxes paid as a compensation for the release of those gases. Additionally, as it considers GHG

emission costs, this model can be seen as a key-tool to access the competitiveness of thermal

power plants equipped with carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems, which at the cost of

increasing generation costs, reduce massively CO2 emissions.

The objective function of this optimisation is driven by the maximisation of the profit —

the net value between revenues arising from the simultaneous energy sale through bilateral

agreements and pool market, minus the costs.

Contrary to what is considered in the previous models, the cost calculation for a given

GenCo is hereby much more scrutinised and close to real charges faced by any generation

company. Hence, besides the obvious marginal cost of each energy unit — almost exclusively

derived from fuel consumption — this method is comprised of a fixed value paid for each

online generation unit, independently of its current production.

37



Electricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets

Apart from that, considering only thermal units, the model also takes into account start-

up and shut-down costs, as well as GHG emissions taxes. This factor is obviously restricted

to thermal infrastructures, since wind turbines do not make any contribution for emissions

during its operation. GHG emissions are intrinsically related to the fuel used to fire each unit.

Hence, the release of pollutants depends on the unit e?ciency and whether the fuel used is

coal, natural gas or even oil, and it is consequently characterised by Fuel Consumption Coe?-

cients (di, ei) and Fuel Emission Factors (efco2, efno2). For the present work, only CO2 and

NO2 emissions are considered for taxation purposes, and its production factors are present in

Table C.4.

In Equation 3.11, Ctax is defined by the specific penalty for emitting each one of the con-

unit i, while fi and gi represent the fuel coe?cient factors for unit i (see Table C.4).

3.3 Hydro and Wind Portfolio Model

Apart of thermal power generation, hydropower is the main electricity production technol-

ogy technically able to operate with relative flexibility and backup the variability inherent to

wind power. In fact, generation from hydro sources is usually highly controllable, especially

in power plants equipped with water reservoirs, which allow big water retention and/or dis-

charges. The considerable dispatchability of hydro power — due to high production rampages

— and the possibility of using pumping systems to lift and storage water from down to up-

stream makes this technology the most adequate to minimise the e?ects of variable renewable

production, for instance PV or wind power. The generation output of hydro power plants can

be modelled based on technical and operational specificities of the plants, such as the head of

reservoir, water discharges or the natural inflow of water into the plants’ basin.

The objective function (3.23), particularly designed for a portfolio comprised of hydro and

wind generation technologies, addresses the optimisation method through the maximisation

of the company’s profit, by computing the di?erence between revenues from selling energy

and the costs inherent to its production.

The considered generation expenditures inherent to an hydro producer include both vari-

able and start-up costs which, according to what was considered in [61], represent the following

range of losses su?ered by the producer at the moment of a start-up order: the loss of water

during maintenance works, wear and tear of windings and mechanical equipment, malfunc-

tions in the control equipment and loss of water during the start-up.

On the other hand, when wind production output is available and delivered to the grid,

an inherent cost is inputed to the producer.

With regard to hydro units, and for the sake of a more accurate scheduling output, a set

Figure 3.2: Illustration of both series coupling and standalone operation for hydro reservoirs and units

of multi-performance curves is considered to patent the close correlation between generated

power and the head of the associated hydro reservoir [62]. This model also takes into account

an eventual spatial coupling among reservoirs located in the same river basin (Figure 3.2).

Therefore, it allows a generation scheduling optimisation of standalone hydro units as well as

of units connected in series along the riverbed, having in consideration a time delay factor

(?), stating the delay of the e?ects of an hydro power plants’s water discharge on downstream

infrastructures.

Constraint (3.24) defines a compulsory energy balance, where hourly sold energy —

whether bilaterally or in pool — is forced to have equal value to the energy hourly pro-

duced plus the eventual energy volume bought via bilateral contracts with retailers and/or

other generation companies. In other words, the constraint states equality between the trans-

acted energy net volumes and the generated electrical energy required to supply such needs.

As mentioned before, the method followed by [63] uses a set of curves to bind water discharges

and power outputs.

As it can be seen in Figure 3.3, each three-dimensional curve relates power output, water

discharge and the head of the reservoir. Constraint (3.25) assure the correct hourly perfor-

mance curve assignment considering the existing water volume vt,k in each reservoir k at t.

Hereupon, if at a given period t, the content of reservoir k, vt,k, is bellow the low level

limit V Lk (XLi in Figure 3.3), the energy production output shall be ruled by performance

Curve 1. If vt,k is located between the low level and the upper level V Uk (XUi in Figure

3.3), then Curve 2 is selected. On the other hand, if the reservoir content is above the upper

level limit, Curve 3 is selected and unit k operates according to the higher performance curve.

Binary values, d1t,k and d2t,k, operate as a switch, used to select the right curve:

8
&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;:

Performance Curve 1 if d1t,k = 0 ^ d2t,k = 0;

Performance Curve 2 if d1t,k = 1 ^ d2t,k = 0;

Performance Curve 3 if d1t,k = 1 ^ d2t,k = 1;

Formulation of the non-concave unit performance curves is made as shown by constraints

(3.26) to (3.31). Constraint (3.26) represents the construction of Curve 1, designed for op-

erations with low level reservoir contents. Since low water contents presupposes d1t,k = 0

and d2t,k = 0, the output power is, then, equal to the minimum power plus the blocks of the

lower-level piecewise linear curve. This situation is analogous to (3.27), for Curve 2, and to

(3.28), for Curve 3.

which is equal to 1, if the water discharge of plant k at time t has exceeded block l, and 0

assume the value 1, indicating that a start-up has occurred, which reflects a cost for the pro-

ducer. According to [60], this relation has also proved its ability to simplify and accelerate

The Multi-agent Simulator MAN-REM: Ini-

tial and Extended Versions

4.1 The Initial Simulator

The MAN-REM is a JAVA-based multi-agent simulator developed by LNEG over the last

years. Its characteristics are mostly derived from the multi-agent platform JADE, aiming to

show and carefully study all the interactions and events taking place in a real-world electric-

ity market situation. This tool was designed to provide simulation capacities to mimic, for

instance, the real environment of an electricity pool market. Additionally, due to JADE’s

platform, interaction among several market players can be modelled and simulated.

The current version of the simulator allows the recreation of an electricity pool platform

both in the daily and intra-daily markets, based on two main market models, namely the

system marginal price (SMP) and the locational marginal price (LMP). These models allow a

complete analysis of both the day-ahead market and the adjustment market, essential to the

proper functioning of the electricity sector. To perform the simulations and extract the conse-

quent results, a sequence of processes needs to be followed with the purpose of configuring the

agents, the market model under appreciation, the pricing algorithm and some characteristics

of the power grid.

The main window of the MAN-REM (Figure 4.1) was designed to provide an essential

overview of the market agents, which are about to interact in a virtual market. Along side

the left and right borders, the name of each market player is added and also detailed personal

information is sequentially introduced by the user.

4.1.1 Participants: Agents Menu

Currently, the software is comprised of three categories of agents, which can interact with

one another, notably Generation Companies, Retail Companies and End-Use Costumers. As

a first step during the creation of a new agent (Figure 4.2), whether a generation company

(GenCo agent), a retailer or a consumer, one is invited to provide some generic informations

about it. In the case of adding a GenCo — in the“Enter GenCo”window (Figure 4.3) — apart

from the GenCo Name, all input details are indicative. This process formalises the creation

of a new production agent that could be subsequently called to interact in a market simulation.

4.1.2 Market Models: Markets Menu

The “Markets Menu” allows the user to select the market model which will rule the desired

simulation. This menu provides options for the energy market on the stock exchange and

the bilateral trading, such as the Energy Markets, Forward Market or Futures Market. Con-

cerning the Energy Markets, either the Day-ahead Market or the Intraday Market can be

simulated using two di?erent bidding algorithms.

System marginal price (SMP)

The system marginal price algorithm, developed by team of the MAN-REM project, and

added to the system, allows market simulation stock. The structure of the o?ers, as men-

tioned, comprises the hourly time of each o?er, the purchase/sale price and the volume of

energy to trade (Figure 4.4). Unlike the local marginal price algorithm, presented below, the

SMP does not include network specifications, meaning that it does not have the ability to

check for bottlenecks. The SMP forms the basis of the algorithms used by some real-world

markets, including MIBEL, to define the prices of the daily and intraday markets.

Locational marginal price (LMP)

The locational marginal price algorithm allows market simulation on the stock exchange, and

can assign a price per hour to every single power grid node. Its structure, as mentioned,

includes a greater number of data, compared with the single marginal price algorithm, pre-

senting di?erences regarding the structure of the o?ers, composed of an initial price and a

slope variable, representing the elasticity of the agent to the market price, positively influenc-

ing the increased bid sale price. For a more detailed description of the system, the interested

reader is referred to [10, 12, 65].

4.2 The Extended MAN-REM Simulator

In order to provide a self-scheduling tool, several new crucial interface windows were added

to the existing software, representing a significant share of the work time invested in this

project, which was reflected in more than 12 000 programming JAVA code lines, developed

on NetBeans IDE.

Since all generation units were, in their former version, characterised simply by their max-

imum and minimum output power, and due to some complexity of the input data required

by the self-scheduling models presented in the previous chapter, a new and larger virtual

database for technical specifications was created, in order to store all the necessary details.

Additionally, a new set of interface windows was added to the simulator, allowing one

to declare all the required information regarding an agent’s portfolio. Moreover, new upload

functionalities were added to MAN-REM to provide information on production forecasts con-

cerning wind farms or even on hourly water inflows in reservoirs associated to hydro power

plants. The scheduling process added to the software will be explained in detail further on.

4.2.1 Portfolio Construction

After the creation of a new GenCo agent, the following step is its allocation to a portfolio of

power plants. The “Add Portfolio” window, shown in Figure 4.5, is the starting point for the

portfolio construction. As can be seen, the user can sequentially add new generation units,

proceed to further update existing power plants, or even remove some of them. Summarised

data about the current portfolio is made available through the data table of the window.

Pressing the “Add” button of the “Add Portfolio” window initiates the process of adding a

new generation unit, showing the “Preliminary Information” window (Figure 4.6). As shown,

the type of this window allows the user to provide general technical specifications, transversal

to all technologies, such as Technology, Fuel, Minimum Power and Maximum Power. An unit

ID can also be provided for the propose of identification.

Figure 4.9: Scheduling a GenCo’s portfolio: add portfolio window (final)

Three main production technologies were considered: thermal, hydro and wind. However,

fuel distinctions are accounted when it comes to thermal technologies, permitting to specify

the firing type of each power plant. For the wind case, an existing database of wind turbines is

available and the user can simply select the desired model. Additionally, the user is required

to provide the number of wind generators that are part of the wind farm.

From here, the process of adding of new generation units su?ers a ramification according

to the selected technology. Therefore, if Thermal Unit is selected in the “Technology” box,

the user is further invited to proceed to the “Thermal Unit Information” window and fill the

remaining thermal-related technical details. Likewise, if the Hydro Unit option is selected,

the user is redirected to the “Hydro Unit Information” window or, in the case of the Wind

Unit, to the “Wind Turbine Technical Details” window, where technical specifications of the

turbines are displayed. In particular, the “Wind Speed Regime” window, where hourly wind

speeds are defined to further compute wind farm’s output production, and the “Wind Unit

Cost Information” window, where eventual fixed and variable production costs (see Figure

4.8).

During the construction process of a GenCo’s portfolio, the user has the chance to overview

the composition of the current generation infrastructure. Once this process is completed, the

data inserted can be saved by clicking“Save”in the“Add Portfolio”window (Figure 4.9), lead-

ing the user to the window where forecasts of prices of pool and bilateral contracts markets

are submitted to the system (Figure 4.10), before finishing the first stage towards a further

market simulation.

53

4.2.2 Scheduling Process

The second stage of market simulation, as adherent as possible to the reality, is the GenCo’s

self-scheduling of production and the subsequent electricity market settlement. Despite the

fact that both objectives and methods of a self-scheduling process may vary from company

to company, all the considered models integrated in MAN-REM, as discussed in Subsections

3.1, 3.3 and 3.2, address this problem by optimising the financial profit from selling energy in

the market, through the maximisation of the net balance of revenues and costs. Accordingly,

a “Unit Selection” window was created, so that users can specify the scheduling optimisation

process details (Figure 4.11).

After choosing the desired generation agent for the scheduling optimisation, the user will

have at his/her disposal a list of the electricity generation units associated to it. As discussed

in Chapter 3, each optimisation method has the focus on a particular portfolio composition

and, therefore, scheduling models should be chosen with regard to the selected portfolio.

54



Electricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets

Figure 4.11: Scheduling a GenCo’s portfolio: choosing model window

Hence, even if a given GenCo owns three di?erent generation technologies, if the “Thermal

portfolio” model is selected, the simulator immediately runs a filter, removing all other tech-

nologies from the table, disabling its usage. This “filtering” mechanism works in the same

manner for the remaining models, in order to display only plausible unit options, according

to the selected model.

The “Select/Unselect” button was designed to add units to the optimisation process. This

step allows the user to pick, among the available portfolio, the generation units that are to be

scheduled and those which, by any reason, are not.

Depending on the selected scheduling model, more input details may be necessary for the

optimisation to be successful. For instance, if the “Hydro and Wind Portfolio” model is se-

lected, the “Hydro Cascade” panel is enabled and the user has the possibility to configure a

sequential spacial coupling among the selected group of hydro units. In this case, a time delay,

foreseen by the “Hydro and Wind Portfolio” model, is required, defining the time needed for

the downstream reservoir to be a?ected by the operation of the upstream hydro unit.

Similarly, data for the “Thermal and Wind Portfolio” model concerning the taxation over

greenhouse emissions (CO2 and NO2) should be inserted, if this model is selected, and then

the “Emissions” panel is enabled.

55

Figure 4.12: Scheduling a GenCo’s portfolio: set pre-sold energy volumes window

The “Contractual Allocation of Wind Power” window (Figure 4.12) was especially created

to support the insertion of a new type of input required by the new “Thermal, Hydro and

Wind Portfolio” scheduling model. In this case, the user has the option to set an hourly share

of the wind farms’ total capacity that is already sold through bilateral contracts even before

the start of the day-ahead market session. Additionally, since the electricity volume sold a

priori can or cannot be e?ectively produced due to the variability of the wind resource, it is

essencial to define a penalty, charged for each energy unit not delivered.

Once the“Generate Scheduling”option is selected, the model can run and the optimisation

function computed by LP SOLVE 5.5, a freeware Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)

solver, developed at the Eindhoven University of Technology, which solves pure linear, (mixed)

integer/binary, semi-continuous and special ordered sets models [66, 67]. In other words, all

the models described in the previous chapter were implemented in the MAN-REM system,

using the JAVA programming language, and LP SOLVE 5.5.

56

4.2.3 Scheduling Results Data

Output data is summarised on the “Scheduling Output” window. As depicted in Figure 4.14,

four charts provide all the output information computed by the selected scheduling model.

Here, after checking the suggested hourly energy settlement, scheduled production and fore-

casted profit and comparing both prices and costs1, the user has the possibility to agree with

the presented solution and Save the scheduling data or, on the other hand, reject (Discard)

it and restart the scheduling process with further desired changes in the portfolio.

Agreeing on the scheduling optimisation output means that all bids are sent to the market

operator. Depending on the number (n) of generation units scheduled, a GenCo places n bids

into the pool market. Each bid, placed separately for each unit, is embodied by an energy

volume and a price, which is equal to the respective marginal cost inherent to its generation

unit (Figure 4.13).

Once the self-scheduling process is finished, more generation competitors can join the mar-

ket and have their portfolios scheduled, increasing the pool competitiveness.

1The reason why the marginal costs of the unit “Termica 2” are not visible in the “Prices &amp;amp; Costs” window
tab is the overlapping with the line of “Termica 2” whose marginal costs have the same value.

4.2.4 Additional Developments

Apart from the main developments indicated above, other features were also deployed and

implemented in this new version of the MAN-REM simulator:

Load “Generation Agent and Portfolio”

Due to some complexity and lengthy of the process required to add a new generation agent

and its portfolio from scratch, a load function was created so that users could gradually cre-

ate a market environment scenario much more expeditiously. Consequently, this new software

version has available a Genco Template, under the form of an EXCEL spreadsheet, that can

be used as a database to be uploaded and, instantly, construct a new generation agent.

Electronic Bilateral Trading Mechanism

Despite the fact that MAN-REM already has an agent-based mechanism of trading for the

bilateral contracts market, such tool is a negotiation-based trading platform, which involves

negotiation between agents — buyers and sellers — according to their goals and adopted

strategies.

The “Electronic Trading Mechanism”, as discussed in Subsubsection 2.3.2, is an entry-

order merit system where, once an order is received, the software runs the exchange, checking

and looking up for a matching o?er. As such solution did not exist in the previous software

version, a contract clearing platform was developed and added to the MAN-REM in order

to provide a new market tool. Figure 4.15 depicts this trading platform which arranges all

placed o?ers according to their entry order. Once the clearing procedure is started, the sys-

tem initiates a loop-based method and compares the first o?er, at the top, with the following

o?ers. If a match is found, both o?ers are cleared at the sale price. Moreover, if one of the

matched o?ers is not completely fulfilled in its power volume, the remaining power is kept in

the market for a further match until it is totally cleared.

60



Production Scheduling: Case Studies

The following case studies aim to demonstrate at some level the relevance of the self-scheduling

models added to the simulator and the MAN-REM’s output data. Simultaneously, this demon-

stration process will also allow to evaluate the correct functioning and pertinence of all the

fifteen new windows that were programmed and embodied in the simulator along this work.

Hence, this chapter will be essentially a bipartite exercise where the responsivity of the models

to the GenCo’s target market prices will be assessed (Case Study I) and the e?ect of variable

renewable electricity production on pool prices will be demonstrated (Case Study II).

For the first case study, two simulations of the day-ahead electricity pool market were

run for each scheduling model to be tested, totalling six market simulations (3 models ? 2
simulations). Hereupon, a set of generation agents, holding di?erent unit portfolios, and of

retail agents, were used in order to mimic a competitive power market. Furthermore, a single

sale bid, comprised of twenty-four prices and volumes, was sent by an additional generation

agent. After all the sale and purchase bids were communicated to the market operator, the

pool mechanism was run and the market cleared, yielding the transacted volumes and the

market clearing prices. Aiming to test the coherence of each model, the single bid referred

above is replaced by another one, calculated using the self-scheduling optimisation and having

the MCP from the previous session as price target. Both output values were then compared.

The second case study aims at analysing the e?ect of high variable production from re-

newables — wind, in this particular case — on pool prices, and requires only two market

simulations, where using the same set of market agents as in the prior simulations, the wind

speeds forecasted and provided as an input to the model are substantially antagonistic, rep-

resenting each of them a windy day and a low-wind day. For both wind speed scenarios, the

market is run and the yielded MCP compared.

5.1 Case Study I: Demonstration of the Optimisation Models

In order to demonstrate the functioning of the self-scheduling optimisation models, added to

the MAN-REM extended version as a result of this work, and analyse their output data, the

system will be subject to some testing examination.

Because this process requires consecutive pool market simulations, a standard set of market

players was defined, meaning that certain producers and retailers are kept constant through-

out this case study. Consequently, eleven bids from three di?erent generation companies —

P2, P3 and P4 — represent a static group of sale o?erings to the market, which are submitted

to the MAN-REM’s virtual market operator and ensure enough market liquidity.

As depicted in Figure 5.1, an additional sale agent — P0{T,T&amp;amp;W,H&amp;amp;W} — was included

in the market and whose portfolio is dependent on the optimisation model being analysed —

“Thermal Portfolio”, “Thermal and Wind Portfolio” and “Hydro and Wind Portfolio”, respec-

tively. Each o?ering consists of a certain energy volume and marginal cost associated with the

generation unit where it is produced. For the present exercise, it was decided that GenCos

would bid their nameplate capacity over the twenty-four hours period which constitutes the

day-ahead pool market span (Figure 5.2). The P0{T,T&amp;amp;W,H&amp;amp;W} producers’ bids are defined

“manually”, without the intervention of any system to support the management of production

and operation of the generation portfolio.

Likewise, eleven standard purchase o?erings from retail companies — Best Energy, SCO

Corporation, Electro Center and First Energy — were considered, providing considerable com-

petition to the market. Contrary to the generation companies’ bids, purchase o?erings, based

on [68] are variable in volume and price throughout the day (Figure 5.3), picturing consump-

tion profiles from a wide range of industrial, domestic and commercial electricity consumers

(further details are shown in Tables B.1 – B.4).

Figure 5.4: Retailers’ power bids shares on the market

Figure 5.4 shows how the considered hypothetical demand is shared among retail com-

panies. Firstly, for each model, a first day-ahead pool market simulation was run with the

standard players and the respective producer P0n. This demand-supply matching process of

electricity volumes, which characterises the pool market clearing operation, occurs as men-

tioned previously in Section 2.3, yielding twenty-four hourly transacted energy volumes and

market marginal prices, determining which purchase and sale bids were accepted and those

which were not.

Then, a profit optimisation session was simulated using the market marginal prices values

as GenCo’s — P1{T,T&amp;amp;W,H&amp;amp;W} — market prices forecasts (Equation 5.1). Therefore, in this

case the variable agent’s bid was not manually submitted to the market operator but computed

by the self-scheduling model under analysis, optimising the commitment and production of

its portfolio according to an input of prices forecasts.

?Poolt = V1,t, 8t = {1, 2, ..., 24}. (5.1)

This testing method is based on comparing both produced energy volumes and clearing-

market prices from the first pool market simulation and the output of the considered opti-

misation models that will define the o?erings to market in the second market session. By

comparing the first market clearance and the further self-scheduling data, based on the mar-

ket prices given by the MMP from the first iteration, this exercise allows to see whether the

behaviour of the models demonstrates the desired sensitivity to prices forecasts in order to

properly schedule the commitment and output of a GenCo’s generation units portfolio. In case

the transacted volumes during the first market simulation are similar to the ones yielded from

64



Electricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets

the model, the conclusion that an important part of the optimisation algorithm is working

properly can be drawn. Table 5.1, Table 5.2 and Table 5.3 show data from the three di?erent

validation exercises.

For each model (and Table), it can be seen that the volumes “in merit” from the first

market session of the Pn producers are coincident with those from the self-scheduling optimi-

sation which had the MMP from the first session as forecast input. Accordingly, one can say

that, by using a self-scheduling optimisation model, a generation company would be able to

estimate better its most probable minimum revenue, and to prepare its actions according to

the circumstances. By foreseeing the failure of some units to be “in merit”, the producer can

then be aware of the low probability of having to start them in order to supply the market and

fulfil the demand. Additionally, as expected, hourly market marginal prices were a (perfect)

match when comparing both market sessions.

Despite coherence of output data, some discrepancies can be easily spotted on Table 5.1,

regarding the testing of the “Thermal Portfolio”“Hydro and Wind Portfolio” and model (see

also Figure 5.5). Due to the fact that the agent’s producing unit was the last “in merit” unit

to be accepted by the market operator, and thus is the marginal unit, only part of the sale bid

was e?ectively transacted via-pool. This event is patent at 01:00h, first, and then at 05:00h

and 06:00h. The major motive for this to happen is the input data necessary for the model to

optimise generation: because this is a profit-driven optimisation, a given GenCo’s generation

is defined on price forecasts and not on demand forecasts, making the model insensitive to

the demand-side necessity (or not) of certain volumes of electricity. Accordingly, one can as-

sume that a volume-driven optimisation, by opposition to a price-driven optimisation, would

prevent this situation.

Electricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets

5.2 Case Study II: E?ect of High Levels of Renewable Variable

Generation on Pool Market Prices

Aiming to illustrate the functionalities of the MAN-REM through the demonstration of the

e?ect of di?erent non-dispatchable electricity generation levels on pool market marginal prices,

two day-ahead pool market sessions were simulated. This matter assumes capital importance

at a time when clean energy generation systems, such as wind and photovoltaics, are under

profound deployment worldwide.

Regarding the retail market players, a set of bids comprised of prices and energy volumes,

similar to the one considered in Section 5.1 for the first case study (Figure 5.3), was used

(Tables B.1 – B.4). On the other hand, several production units operating according various

generation technologies were allocated to the four GenCos, who played an active role in this

market simulation: GenCo 1, GenCo 2, GenCo 3 and GenCo 4 (Table 5.4).

Two market simulations were carried out in order to illustrate the influence of a scenario

characterised by high wind speed against a scenario of low wind speed, namely by compar-

ing their hourly marginal prices. Hence, the main di?erence between the two simulations

is precisely the input data (to the self-scheduling optimisation models) related to the wind

speed forecasts, which will allow the producer to estimate the hourly wind production for the

next twenty-four hours and hence its whole portfolio commitment. Table C.1 shows in detail

the hourly wind speed forecasts used in this case for both the low and high speed scenarios.

Likewise, Table C.2 shows the actual output wind power generation from the considered wind

farms computed, for each case, according to the technical characteristics of the installed wind

turbines’ models (see Table A.1).

As mentioned above, a set of generation companies owning, each of them, several genera-

tion units, was considered. Tables C.3 – C.9 describe the technical specificities of each of these

plants. Figure 5.6 shows the composition of the group of electricity producers that constitutes

the electricity generation system considered, according to the generation technology of their

power plants. Consequently, an overall generation capacity of 2 831, 65 MW constitutes the

electrical system here simulated, having considerable contributions from hydro power, coal,

an important share of wind power, and smaller power availability from natural gas and oil.

Figure 5.6: Representativity of each generation technology composing the generation system

The generation costs considered for hydro [61, 62] and thermal power [58, 59] plants follow

state-of-art fixed and variable costs, whereas marginal costs of wind power were considered to

be in the interval referred in Section 2.4. Marginal costs of all the units that participate in

the market are shown in Table C.9. Despite other costs are shown in Table C.9, and because

producers are expected to bid in the market at marginal costs, this case study considered only

the costs on the last column (e/MWh).

Figure 5.7 depicts the market marginal prices (see Table C.10 for further details) yielded

from the two pool market simulations. A considerable decay of market marginal prices can be

easily noticed when higher wind speeds are registered due to their influence on wind farms’

output production and, consequently, to the flooding of the pool market with wind power at

lower (if not null) marginal costs.

70



Electricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets

As already discussed in Section 2.4, wind power’s low OPEX costs easily result in lower

market marginal costs because of its e?ect on pushing more expensive generation units on-

wards and, oftentimes, disposing them from the group of the in merit producers. For the

present exercise, an average market marginal price reduction of around 4,43e/MWh was reg-

istered, having the price spreads oscillated from a minimum of 0,00 e/MWh — at 06:00h and

21:00h — to a maximum of 17,65 e/MWh — registered at 00:00h.

By examining Figures 5.8 and 5.9 one can get to the conclusion that marginal prices fall

is intrinsically linked to the avoidance of calling fuel-fired power plants to produce electricity

through the use of electrical energy generated by wind farms. Specifically, during the night

period, namely between 00:00h and 05:00h, the reduction of reliance on coal can clearly be

noticed when a high output wind production is registered during these hours of low load.

Besides the market marginal price reduction, another e?ect of high shares of electricity

production from wind farms on the market clearance was verified. In fact, the transacted

volume of energy through this pool platform increased when higher wind generation was reg-

istered. Whereas in a low wind speed scenario (and thus low wind output production), the

overall volume of negotiated energy was of about 17 083,23 MWh, under a high wind speed

scenario, the daily amount of traded electricity via-pool rose from approximately 2 799,29

MWh up to 19 882,52 MWh. This non-surprising event is justified by the increase of the

social welfare and the increase of quantity demanders can pay for.

Figure 5.8: Hourly power generation by technology under a low wind speed scenario

Figure 5.9: Hourly power generation by technology under a high wind speed scenario

It should also be highlighted the fact that, in both market scenarios, neither hydro nor

oil generation technologies managed to be “in merit” in the simulated markets due to their

higher marginal costs when compared to the remaining sources of power production.

72



Conclusions and Further Developments

In an era of great demographic expansion and relative levelling of living standards in some of

the more densely populated areas of the planet, the human kind is facing extreme challenges

to provide to more than seven billion people the goods and services that, not so far from us,

were only part of a minority’s life. Electricity, as almost any other utility, has seen its demand

rocket over the last hundred years and even more with the industrial and economic explosion

of countries, such as India, China, Russia and others emerging regions. Massive quantities of

demanded electrical energy have evidenced even more a chronicle problem of this sector: a

profound reliance on fossil fuels burning to fire power plants and its inherent greenhouse e?ect

gases emissions with all the negative aspects of their spread into the atmosphere. Currently,

some previous policies regarding the sustainability of our society, including of the energy

sector, are already yielding some changes on the electricity generation landscape, with the

introduction of considerable renewable and CO2-free production technologies, including wind,

solar and geothermal, as well as pumping and chemical storage systems, which promote wiser

and more e?cient use of the electricity produced.

The current diversity of production technologies with distinct operation regimes, costs

and maturities has provoked the rise of market competition up to levels never seen before,

exposing particularly generation companies to higher financial and operational risks that need

to be forearmed for the sake of an e?cient sector. Market simulators, particularly multi-agent

systems with higher adherence to the reality of market and negotiation environments, are

(extraordinary) tools that allow the study of the interactions between agents from di?erent

backgrounds and with distinct expectations, as well as the consequences of the introduction

of new types of agents, generation technologies, market regulations or any other aspects.

Hereupon, the aim of this work was to provide the already existent MAN-REM market

simulator with a set of tools that could be helpful to a producer to self-schedule its units’

commitment and output production based on technical specificities of the generation portfo-

lio, market prices and renewable production forecasts, in order to maximise its financial profit

within a considered period span.

73



Electricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets

After the conclusion of the simulator’s expansion, three self-scheduling models had been

added to the software, each of them with special focus on a particular generation portfolio’s

technology composition. Hence, producers owning thermal units, thermal and wind units and

hydro and wind units were considered and are now allowed to self-schedule their production

towards a profitable sale of the output electricity through both bilateral contracts and pool

market. Interface windows to enable an easy and e?cient addition of agents and portfolios to

the market were also patched to the existent version of MAN-REM as well as an electronic

trading mechanism for bilateral transactions.

The case study adopted to demonstrate the optimisation algorithms has demonstrated

that a good coordination between the input prices forecasts and the output generation and

commitment of units exists. Units whose marginal prices are above the forecasted prices the

producers expect to sell their energy by, are immediately excluded from the generation plan-

ning in order to avoid financial losses.

Also, by developing a second case study, the software has allowed to demonstrate that

renewable generation units, with traditionally lower marginal costs, surpass more marginally

expensive production technologies such as thermal or hydro. This substitution of technologies

on the meritocratic hierarchy results on the displacement of coal- and gas-fired power plants

with beneficial consequences whether for the reduction of GHG emissions or for the lowering

of pool market prices. In fact, weak demand periods, usually during the night, are some time

characterised by substantial reductions of the market clearing prices, when sometimes the

energy is transacted freely or, depending on the region, at negative prices.

6.1 Further Developments

Regarding future work, and aiming to improve the MAN-REM multi-agent simulator and some

of the added features, resulting from this dissertation, a few suggestions may be followed and

used to make it a more robust and realistic tool. The following development paths are then

proposed:

• Proceed with further testings in order to prove the logical stability and coherence of the
self-scheduling optimisation models added to the MAN-REM, assuring a correct unit

commitment status and output production;

• Complement the self-scheduling optimisation tools, added as result of this work, with
the introduction of a certain level of uncertainty, which characterises a real market

74



Electricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets

situation, for instance on the day-ahead market prices forecasts, and the uncertainty

arising from imperfect wind speed and hydro inflows forecasts. Risk assessment and

management tools should then be considered as the next step to turn market simulations

more realistic;

• Development of new self-scheduling optimisation models focused on broader units port-
folio compositions, such as photovoltaic power, hydro storage and even chemical battery

storage facilities, providing the user with the chance to have more realistic simulations

by adding, to his portfolio, technologies that are already widely used Worldwide;

• Study, development and implementation of a more realistic market system where day-
ahead pool market clearance is operated simultaneously with bilateral negotiation and

agreements in order to assure that a correct settlement of all energy volumes, bought

and produced, is properly achieved.
