Resumo: O sector costeiro do Algarve central entre as praias da Galé e Olhos de Água deve a sua fisiografia 
crenulada a um sistema cársico bem desenvolvido em rochas carbonatadas. As arribas possuem no sopé uma 
plataforma litoral rochosa ou uma praia arenosa. Os principais objectivos do projecto de investigação EROS são: 
(i) a quantificação da dissipação da energia das ondas ao longo de plataformas litorais e de praias arenosas com 
diferentes declives e exposição às ondas; (ii) a caracterização da refracção e difracção das ondas e da modificação 
das correntes forçadas pelo controle morfológico. A metodologia base centra-se na aquisição de dados de ondas e 
correntes utilizando transdutores de pressão e correntómetros colocados em transeptos normais à linha de costa, 
de modo a obter o espectro completo de ondas e correntes, desde a água profunda até aproximadamente à base 
das arribas, quer nas plataformas quer nas praias.  

Palavras chave: Algarve, costa rochosa, plataforma litoral, ondas, correntes.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 

The ability and extent of waves on quarrying the 
cliff foot depends on the structure connecting the 
cliff with the sea floor (shore platform or sandy 
beach). Medium-term (centennial) cliff retreat has 
been reported as mainly controlled by the shore 
platform morphology on the cliff foot as well as by 
hydrodynamic processes acting on it (Duperret et al., 
2005; Walkden and Hall, 2005; Pierre, 2006; 
McGlashan et al., 2008). The widen of the shore 
platform driven by several processes including the 
cliff retreat, leads to the successively topographic 
elevation of the cliff-platform junction and to wave 
energy dissipation, and therefore to the decrease of 
the recession rate through a negative feedback 
(McGlashan et al., 2008). Where beaches develop at 
the cliff toe, the coastal equilibrium correlates 
positively with beach width, which responds very 
rapidly to changes on waves and tides characteristics 
(Morisawa and King, 1974). The ongoing research 
project named Erosion of Rocky Shores-differences 
in protection promoted by sandy beaches and shore 
platforms (EROS) aims, among other objectives: (i) 
to quantify the amount of the wave energy 
dissipation upon both shore platforms and sandy 
beaches; (ii) to characterize the wave and current 
fields and its dependency on the local beach 
morphology. Two study sites differently exposed to 
the incident waves are considered. This work 

presents the results of a field experiment, which led 
to the proposal of the EROS project. The data were 
collected in December 2009.  Furthermore, two 
recent field campaigns made during March 2012 are 
also described.  
 

2.  STUDY AREA 
 

The coastal zone of the centre Algarve between Galé 
and Olhos de Água (Fig.1) displays a complex 
karstic morphology leading to a strong 
morphological control of the hydrodynamic 
processes. Cliffs exposing near horizontal carbonate 
rocks back both shore platforms and beaches. 
Sandstones filling the palaeo relief into the 
carbonate rocks may reach the rocky cliffs 
lowermost portions. This crenulated shore with 
pocket beaches bounded by headlands and shore 
platforms, offers suitable conditions as a case study. 
It enables to quantify and compare the behaviour of 
waves and currents over both shore platforms and 
the adjacent beaches during the same time span and 
offshore conditions, but with different obliquity 
when approaching the coast. The waves incoming 
from WSW represent 72% of the year. Off the 
Algarve, the wave height ranges from 0.30 m to 1.8 
m, with rare exceptional heights surpassing 3.7 m. 
Such high waves are usually associated with storms 
from the SW sector, during which waves attain an 
averaged height of 2-3 m with a period of 7-8 s

(Costa et al., 2001). The Algarve coast experiences a 
semi-diurnal mesotidal regime ranging from 2.70 to 
1.36 m during neap tides and from 3.82 to 0.64 m 
during spring tides (Instituto Hidrográfico, IH, 
1990).

3.1- Methods 

Four pressure transducers (pt) were used in order to 
simultaneously acquire the wave heights (H) and 
periods (T) crossing two shore platforms at different 
angles to the incident waves. Thus, two pressure 
transducers were used in Galé (pt1 and pt2, Fig. 2A) 
and the other two in Olhos de Água (pt3 and pt4, 
Fig. 2B). The seaward transducers (pt1 at Galé and 
pt3 at Olhos de Água) were positioned in the lower 
intertidal zone at the spring low tide level, whereas 
the landward pt2 and pt4 at Galé and Olhos de Água 
respectively were placed close to the cliff foot (Fig. 
2). The height above mean sea level and 
geographical position were taken using a differential 
geographical position system (dGPS). The pt sensors 
were protected with stainless steel cages to prevent 
both the algae accumulation upon the sensors and 
the damage by gravel transported by waves. 
 
3.2- Results and discussion 
 
Changes in the direction of propagation due to 
variations in the group velocity may result in the 
increasing of wave heights when approaching the 
coast. During the monitored tidal cycle, the offshore 
wave direction was 247º and the offshore significant 
height (Hs0) was 0.9 m (IH data, Faro buoy). 
According to the coastline orientation, the waves 
approached the shoreline obliquely with angles of 
incidence of 65º and 25º at Galé and Olhos de Água 
respectively. The deep-water waves shoal at the 
Galé outer edge (pt1) show a statistically significant 
increase (P&lt;0.05) of the significant wave height (Hs) 
of 43%. In a sheltered position to the WSW waves, 
the Hs at the shore platform outer edge (pt3) at 
Olhos de Água, was 41% lower than Hs0 but that Hs 
decrease was not statistically significant (P&gt;0.05). 
This difference may be explained both by the 
relationship between the bathymetric contours and 
the waves direction and the bottom morphology 
(e.g., Davidson-Arnott, 2010). The inner continental 
shelf shows a steeper morphology at Galé and waves 
from WSW are less oblique to the coastline than in 
Olhos de Água.  

The water depth on the platform changes with the 
tide being the main factor controlling the changes of 
the wave height. The highest Hs was observed four 
hours after the beginning of flood at the outer 
pressure transducers, and two and one hour later at 
the inner ones at Galé and Olhos de Água 
respectively (Fig. 3). The Hs modification along the 
shore platform was noted worthy different between 
the studied sites (Fig. 3).

profiles are quite different because at Olhos de Água they 
were produced through a laser scan survey whereas a 
dGPS survey was used at Galé. Elevations report to mean 
sea level. 
 
 
The averaged wave Hs was 1.18 m at the outer pt in 
Galé decreasing along the platform to 0.78 m as 
registered in the landward pt (pt2) close to the cliff 
foot, representing a statistically extremely 
significance (P&lt;0.001) decreasing of 33%.  The ratio 
between Hs and the water depth (Hs/h) ranged 
landward from 0.83 (SD=0.27) to 0.74 (SD = 0.10). 
Considering these thresholds and the Hs values in 
pt1, 65% of the waves broke before reaching the 
inner position at pt2. The remaining 35% of the

unbroken waves crossed the shore platform breaking 
close to the cliff foot (pt2 position). The wave power 
at breaking (Pb) in the shore platform outer edge 
(pt1) was 10819 Kw/m at Galé decreasing to more 
than half (4915 Kw/m) near the cliff foot at pt2.  
In contrast to Galé, Hs increased from 0.53 to 0.68 
m between the platform outer edge (pt3) and the 
landward pt (pt4) near the cliff foot at Olhos de 
Água. However, the observed 28% of Hs increasing 
between pt3 and pt4 was not statistically significant 
(P&gt;0.05). Thereby, the sheltered (to WSW waves) 
and flatter shore platform at Olhos de Água did not 
show the effectiveness on dissipating the energy of 
the waves as observed at Galé. The Hs/h value of 0.6 
was quite constant along the shore platform 
traducing it relative flatness with respect to the Galé 
site. Similarly to Galé, 64% of the incoming waves 
broke before attaining the inner portion of the 
platform. However, the remaining 36% of the waves 
shoaling along the platform represented a landward 
increasing of the Pb from 2165 Kw/m in pt3 to 3750 
Kw/m pt4 close the cliff foot. 
Those results show that, together with the tidal 
elevation, the platform slope has a major role on the 
wave energy dissipation as also observed by other 
authors (Marshall and Stephenson, 2011; Ogawa et 
al., 2011).  
 
4. FIELD CAMPAINGNS MARCH 2012 
 
Aiming to further quantify the amount of the wave 
energy dissipation upon shore platforms and sandy 
beaches, two field campaigns were recently 
performed (March, 8 and 22). We deployed 
electromagnetic current meters (ecm, Infinity) and 
pressure transducers (pt, In Situ Level Troll 700) in 
normal transepts to the shoreline both in shore 
platform and beach (Fig. 4). Permanent fixings have 
been made into the rock in shore platforms using 
bolts and chemical dowels in order to locate the pt 
and ecm equipments. The near shore wave climate 
(currents and waves) was obtained through an 
acoustic doppler current meter (adp, Sonteck, Mini 
ADP 1.5 MHz) anchored at the 8 m bathymetric 
contour. The frequency of data acquisition was 2 Hz 
for pt and 4Hz for adp and ecm. A cell size of 0.25 
m and an averaging interval of 10 min with profiling 
interval of 5 min, that represents a 4 min of wave 
measurement, were adopted for the adp data 
acquisition. The experiences were performed during 
two tidal cycles, with simultaneous data acquisition 
in the shore platform and the adjacent beach, at Galé 
and Olhos de Água sites (Fig. 4). The present data 
set will be analysed in the scope of EROS project to 
give further insight of the waves dissipation both in 
the platform and beach at both study sites. 
 
 
 

5. FINAL REMARKS AND FURTHER 
WORK 

 
The role of shore platform in dissipating the wave 
energy is largely dependent of the coastal sector 
orientation and the platform slope. For the same 
offshore wave conditions, we observed that:  
1- The waves shoaling at the steeper shelf adjacent 
to the well exposed site of Galé represented 63% of 
the Hs increase with respect to the offshore Hs0, 
whereas the Hs increase at Olhos de Água, where 
the waves approached with a high obliquity, was not 
statistically significant; 
2- The shore platform at Galé was more efficient in 
energy dissipation than at the Olhos de Água 
sheltered site, where both the inner continental shelf 
and the shore platform are flatter; 
3- Hs/h ranged landward between 0.83 and 0.74 at 
Galé and showed a constant value of 0.6 across the 
platform at Olhos de Água.
