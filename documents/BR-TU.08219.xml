Magnetometric exploration in intrusive basic with evidence of gold in northern region of the Camaquã Sedimentary Basin (RS)
Abstract
This study involved magnetometric exploration in the region of São Sepé (RS), southern Brazil, to evaluate the potential for gold mineralization in a gabbro using evidence previously obtained from the geochemical exploration of stream sediments. The gabbro named Santa Catarina is intruded in the Metamorphic Complex Vaca-caí, a metassedimentary sequence where several gold deposits were recognized. In this study, nine lines of land magnetometry were performed with 1.200m in length each, a total of 10.800m and 720 reading stations. The results suggest the presence of filonian mineralization in fractures, some of which are subject to weathering action, releasing and transporting gold by water action and depositing it along the stream sediments downstream from the gabbro. The analytical signal map outlines areas of high magnetic susceptibility within its boundaries, coinciding with structural lineaments in the NS and EW directions, associated with the last of the four stages of regional deformation, possibly responsible for both fracturing and opening of spaces in the gabbro, as by remobilization of sulfide and gold recognizably described in several gold deposits within the Vacacaí Metamorphic Complex.
Keywords: mineral exploration; gabbro; fracture; analytic signal.
Resumo
Esse estudo consiste na aquisição de dados magnetométricos na região de São Sepé (RS), sul do Brasil, com o propósito de avaliar o potencial de mineralização aurífera de um gabro, a partir de indícios obtidos em prospecção geoquímica de sedimentos de corrente prévios. O gabro denominado Santa Catarina está intrudido no Complexo Metamórfico Vacacaí, uma sequência metassedimentar ,onde foram reconhecidas diversas jazidas de ouro. Nesse estudo, foram realizadas nove linhas de magnetometria terrestre, com 1.200 m de comprimento cada, num total de 10.800 m e 720 estações de leitura. Os resultados sugerem a presença de mineralizações filonianas em fraturas, algumas das quais sujeitas à ação intem-périca, com liberação e transporte de ouro por ação fluvial e deposição junto a sedimentos de corrente a jusante do gabro. O mapa de sinal analítico descreve as áreas de alta susceptibilidade magnética dentro de seus limites, coincidentes com lineamentos estruturais nas direções NE e E-W, associadas a

1.	Introduction
Mineral exploration is of fundamental importance for the discovery of new deposits, as well as for detailing or revaluating known deposits. This is achieved through a series of techniques for direct and indirect geological investigations, planned in a manner to provide increased detailing of the mineralized geological conditions.
Searches using indirect tools such as geophysical investigations make in-depth investigations possible by measuring intrinsic physical properties and geological materials such as mineral accumulations. Such methods are represented by applied geophysics, whose data can be acquired through aerial surveys and ground campaigns, besides the use of remote sensing
Location and geology of the study area
The study area is represented by gabbro Santa Catarina, is located in the south of Brazil, in the city of São Sepé city, State of Rio Grande do Sul, about 270 km distant from from Porto Alegre city, and accessed by the BR 290 highway between the towns of South Cacapava do Sul and Vila Nova do Sul.
Filonian gold mines are represented in the region by ores characterized by associations of quartz veins with gold and small amounts of iron oxides, pyrite and chalcopyrite. The veins present NE and NW directions and are preferably embedded in rock types of
and aerial photos (Telford et al, 1990; Moon et al, 2006).
Among the several geophysical methods, magnetometry shows good results, referring to geological structural mapping, as well as associations between magnetic fields and possible mineralization. This method can provide indications of mineral accumulations such as sulfides and oxides, quite contrasting with the main minerals that form rocks, such as silicates.
Research in potentially mineralized targets of copper, gold, iron oxides, for example, enable detailing by magnetometry, subsequently confirmed by sampling and geochemistry. Studies such as those of Sharma (1986), Doyle, (1990); Fallon &amp;amp;

A geochemical study of the collected stream sediment sample taken approximately 1 km downstream from the center of Santa Catarina gabbro drainage recorded 48 pints of gold, well above the average 45 gold particles characteristic for the region, besides arsenopyrite and pyrite together with heavy minerals (CPRM , 2000).
The investigated area is located in southern Brazil in the central sector of the State of Rio Grande do Sul, in the

unit denominated Sulriograndense Shield, represented by metamorphic, igneous and sedimentary rocks, with Archean and Proterozoic ages, compartmentalized into blocks and bordered by large regional faulting in the NE-SW directions (Paim et al. 2000).
The Basic/Ultrabasic Stratiform Complex covers the area of study and comprises layered rocks, such as peridotites, gabbros and anorthosite. The gabbro Santa Catarina was originally described by Rodrigues et al. (1982). The gabbro is in contact by fault with rocks of the Va-cacaí Metamorphic Complex (Figure 1).

When characterized by a multiphase tectonic evolution in this unit, it is possible to discern four phases of deformation. The first three phases (D1, D2 and D3), generated folds with a tendency to axial coaxiality in the NE/ SW direction and are related to compressive stress directed to SE, where D1 and D2 reflect a tangential movement , while D3 is characterized as associated to a transcurrence phase. Meanwhile, the fourth phase of deformation (D4)

The deformation phase D1 was responsible for the folding and transposition of the layers. The deformation phase D2 resulted in a significant mass transport from northwest to southeast, evidenced by tectonic imbrications featuring structural arrangement between the various metamorphic associations in the region.

The main procedures for processing magnetometer data obtained in this work were: correction of diurnal variation, IGRF (International Geomagnetic Reference Field) removal and filtering of data. The magnetic data were subjected to diurnal correction performed to eliminate the variations caused by non-geological causes; these changes that occur in the values recorded during the day, in the base magnetometer data in relation to
with moderate slope axes, now to NNE, then to SW. In general, these are open folds often of monoclinal trend with the hinge line inclined in from to NW. The folds generated in the D4 deformation phase are characterized by presenting axes with guidance close to orthogonality with respect to the structures established in the previous phases. They feature soft folds, of decimetric dimensions, represented by metamorphic foliation ripples, which constitute side folds, i.e. superimposed laminar folds of the structures of the previous stages (CPRM, 1995).

mobile magnetometer. As the magnetic anomalies are disturbances or deviations from the terrestrial geomagnetic field, to define an anomaly, it is necessary to subtract the value of the normal field of each measure performed in the survey. In surveys performed in less extended areas, such as the study area, a single value of IGRF was obtained for the center of the area and subtracted from all measurements made.

3.	Results
The map of the total anomalous field presents great variation in values, with the presence of anomalies of elongated shape with higher magnetic susceptibility in the order of 22710 nT, whose areas with higher susceptibility portions are in NE, E, SW, W areas and intermediate values in N-S. These anomalous areas exhibit elongated shape with lateral continuity. Areas with lower magnetic intensity were also observed, with variation in the order of 22043 nT, whose most significant low values are located in the NW, SW and SE quadrants (Figure 3).
The elaboration of magnetometric maps was based on linear interpolation by the method of minimum curvature, resulting in a grid of cells of 15 m x 15 m. For the geographical location of the stations the Universal Transverse

Mercator or UTM coordinates system, Zone 22 South was used. The reference ellipsoid used for this study was the SAD 69.
From the total magnetometer field map, the processing technique was applied for enhancement of magnetic anomalies. In the transformation of the space domain to the time domain through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), a map of analytical signals was generated. In this map, the gabbro was characterized by high magnetic susceptibility, in contrast to the metassedi-ments of the Vacacai Metamorphic Complex. However, the ends of the map also present a high magnetic susceptibility, in this case, attributed geostatistical effects due to the absence and small quantity of sample points (Figure 3).

main feature, the positioning of the amplitudes arising immediately above the limits of structures.
With the purpose of a joint analysis of magnetometric and geological data, the limits of the intrusive rock obtained in a previous work developed by CPRM in 1995, measured by field surveys, together with the main structural lineaments, interpreted based on satellite images, were superimposed on the analytic signal map (Figure 4).
In the analytic signal map, it is possible to observe that the magnetic highs are strongly conditioned to the geological structures in the area. In the NE portion, where a more significant magnetic high in the order of 27.6 nT is observed, fractures are heading NE-SW, which reinforces the hypothesis of ore concentration in these lineaments.

The Vacacai Metamorphic Complex, fitting from the Santa Catarina gabbro is characterized by a multiphase tectonic evolution, where it is possible to discern four phases of deformation (D1, D2, D3 and D4).
The first three phases generated folds tending to coaxiality in a NE/ SW direction, related to compressive stress towards the SE. The D3 phase is characterized by strike-slip movement with coaxial refolding and generation of folds of normal type and slope axis to NNE and SW. The D4 phase resulted in folds with axial orientation NW/SE,
4.	Conclusion
The image of the amplitudes of the analytic signal determines geometric parameters, such as the location of geological and structural limits. The analytic signal presents as its main feature the placement of the amplitudes arising immediately above the limits of the structure. These aspects are quite evident regarding the magnetometer signature of the intrusive rock, defined by high values
orthogonal in relation to the structures established in the previous phases.
The gabbro Santa Catarina is understood as a structural basement horst, raised to its present position during the D3 stage by compressive stresses. The compressive stress of the D4 phase generated fractures in the main direction, in an event where there was low-grade metamorphism and probable gold remobilization from the metassediments to the gabbro (CPRM, 1995).
The geological context of the study area indicates that the mineralized zones must be contained in fractures. Thus,

In this sense, processing through the analytical signal filter demonstrated efficacy as an auxiliary tool in the delimitation of mafic intrusives in metassedi-mentary contexts.
The evolutionary context of the study area is characterized by a polycyclic
after the application of the analytical signal filter, the generated map shows two zones of high magnetic susceptibility, one in the NE portion and another in the S portion, which can be interpreted as promising for the accumulation of gold and sulfides (Figure 3).
The areas with potential presence of mineralized veins in gold and sulfides cause large distortions in the local magnetic field, apparently in an amplitude higher than the distortion caused by the presence of disseminated magnetite along the forming minerals of the gabbro.
evolution and high complexity, where four phases of deformation were defined. In the D3 phase, it is attributed to the rise of intrusive rock by the movement of normal faults, interpreted as a structural horst of basement, which was a seabed before sedimentation and subsequently, to the metamorphism of the lithotypes gathered in the Vacacai Metamorphic Complex, unit admittedly mineralized in gold.
The D4 deformation phase resulted in structural lineaments with NE and E-W directions, whose efforts may be related to both the fracturing and opening of spaces within the gabbro, and the remobilization of metals (gold and sulfides) derived from the metassedimentary host. Although the gabbro is a known magnetic rock because of the high content of magnetite, the analytic signal map outlines areas with high magnetic susceptibility within its boundaries, coinciding with structural lineaments in the NS and E-W directions. This fact can be attributed to the possible presence of veins of massive sulfide and gold, in	contrast to the occurrence of magnetite above the regional average.
