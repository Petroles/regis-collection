resumo 
 
 

A Análise de Risco Ecológico (ARE) é um processo sistemático de avaliação 
da probabilidade de efeitos adversos ocorrerem em resultado da exposição a 
um ou mais agentes de stress ambiental. No contexto da tomada de decisão 
relativa aos problemas ambientais, a ARE tem-se mostrado como uma 
ferramenta fundamental e eficaz, sendo cada vez mais utilizada nos países 
desenvolvidos. Contudo, em Portugal, o seu uso continua muito limitado e 
incipiente.  
A Lagoa da Vela, localizada no litoral centro de Portugal, é um lago eutrofizado 
potencialmente exposto a contaminantes resultantes das actividades agrícola 
e pecuária que tem lugar na sua bacia de drenagem, e que comprometem 
seriamente o seu equilíbrio. Assim, o presente estudo teve como objectivo 
planear e desenvolver uma ARE retrospectiva na Lagoa da Vela, de modo a 
analisar os riscos para o ecossistema aquático resultantes da exposição a 
fontes de poluição difusa. Este estudo foi desenvolvido tendo por base a 
estrutura conceptual proposta pela Agência de Protecção Ambiental Norte 
Americana para AREs, a qual inclui 4 etapas principais: formulação do 
problema, caracterização da exposição, caracterização dos efeitos e 
caracterização dos riscos. Na fase de formulação do problema o ecossistema 
foi caracterizado, as fontes de poluição foram identificadas, elaborou-se um 
modelo conceptual e definiu-se um plano de análise. Na fase de 
caracterização da exposição confirmou-se a potencial contaminação da Lagoa 
da Vela por fontes de poluição difusa resultantes de actividades 
antropogénicas locais, ilustrada, principalmente, pelas elevadas quantidades 
de nutrientes e pela presença de pesticidas nas águas superficiais, nas águas 
subterrâneas, nos sedimentos e nos tecidos de peixe. Além disso, verificou-se 
que o uso de pesticidas nos campos adjacentes ao lago (nomeadamente 
alacloro) pode facilmente contaminar o sistema aquático por lixiviação, 
fenómeno que é amplificado pelas características específicas do local, como 
as propriedades do solo, a profundidade do aquífero, etc. Mediante a 
comparação das concentrações de pesticidas medidos na água superficial do 
lago e em sedimentos com valores de qualidade legislados e com dados 
toxicológicos, surgiram preocupações relativas a potenciais efeitos no biota 
aquático. As concentrações de pesticidas detectados na água subterrânea 
(colhida nos poços locais) ultrapassaram também os valores de segurança 
definidos para águas de consumo, o que constitui uma preocupação para a 
saúde da população local. A fase de caracterização de efeitos, baseada em 
bioensaios com espécies de fitoplâncton e zooplâncton, padrão e locais, 
mostrou que a contaminação do lago poderá comprometer o seu fraco 
equilíbrio afectando os produtores primários. Por fim, a fase de caracterização 
de riscos, através de uma metodologia baseada no peso das evidências, 
sustentou potenciais riscos, induzidos pela poluição difusa, no ecossistema da 
Lagoa da Vela e na saúde pública local.

Ecological Risk Assessment, diffuse pollution, lakes, nutrients, pesticides 
 

abstract 
 

Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA) is a process for systematically evaluating 
how likely it is that adverse ecological effects occur as a result of exposure to 
one or more stressors. In the arena of decision-making processes concerning 
the environmental problems, the ERA is a fundamental and feasible tool, and 
has becoming an increasingly used process in developed countries. However, 
in Portugal their use stills limited and insipient.  
Lake Vela, located in the Portuguese littoral-centre, is a eutrophic lake 
potentially exposed to contamination generated by agricultural and livestock 
activities held in its drainage basin, which are seriously compromising it´s 
ecological sustainability. Therefore, the present study aimed to plan and 
perform a retrospective ERA in Lake Vela to assess the risks posed by diffuse 
sources of pollution on the aquatic ecosystem. This study was conducted 
according the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guideline for ERA 
processes, which include 4 main steps: problem formulation; characterization of 
exposure, characterization of ecological effects and characterization of risks. In 
the problem formulation step the ecosystem was described, the sources of 
pollution were identified, a conceptual model was designed and the analysis 
plan was defined. In the exposure characterization step it was confirmed the 
potential contamination of Lake Vela by diffuse sources of pollution from local 
anthropogenic activities, illustrated mainly by the high amounts of nutrients and 
by the presence of pesticides in surface water, groundwater, sediment and fish 
tissues samples. Moreover, it was verified that the use of pesticides (namely 
alachlor) on agricultural fields surrounding Lake Vela can easily contaminate 
the aquatic ecosystem through leaching, a phenomenon that is enhanced by 
the site-specific characteristics, such as soil properties, depth of the aquifer, 
etc. The comparison of pesticide concentrations recorded in lake surface water 
and in sediment with regulatory and toxicological benchmarks generated 
concerns about potential effects on the aquatic biota. The concentrations of 
pesticides recorded in groundwater (collected in local wells) were also above 
the recommended safety levels for drinking water, which constitutes a concern 
for the local public health. The characterization of effects, based on bioassays 
with standard and local phytoplanktonic and zooplanktonic species showed that 
lake contamination could compromise the weak balance of their communities 
by affecting the primary producers. At last, the step of risks characterization, 
performed following a qualitative weight-of-evidence approach, provided 
evidences regarding the risks posed by diffuse pollution to the Lake Vela 
ecosystem and local public health.

I -General Introduction 

 

1.1. Ecological Risk Assessment  

The ecological risk assessment (ERA) process was developed in the 1980s with the 

purpose of evaluating the effects of the anthropogenic activities at the ecosystem level 

and integrates this ecotoxicological information into regulatory decisions (Campbell et al., 

2006). ERA was defined by the United States’ Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) 

as the process that “evaluates the likelihood that adverse ecological effects may occur or 

are occurring as a result of exposure to one or more stressors” (USEPA, 1992). Hence, risk 

assessments are used to evaluate environmental problems associated with past, ongoing, 

and future practices (Pastorok, 2002). For example, ERA can be used to evaluate benefits 

of different managing decisions at contaminated sites, assess new chemicals prior to their 

commercial production or evaluate the risks posed by effluents, industries or agriculture 

to ecological resources in the ecosystem (SETAC, 1997). In recent years, ERA has emerged 

as an important tool in environmental protection programs (USEPA, 1998). ERA clearly 

has a key role in the ecological assessment of contaminated sites and has been widely 

used as a fundamental tool for linking science to decision-making (Moraes, 2002). 

Through the identification of potential risks ERA permits to recognize environmental 

problems, to select priorities for environment protection, to select targets to control, to 

compare the efficacy of management options, and identifies critical knowledge gaps, 

thereby helping to prioritize future research (USEPA, 1992). Moreover, ERA provides a 

critical component, enabling risk managers to make well-founded environmental 

decisions.  

The ERA process is based on two major elements:  

Exposure - is the co-occurrence and interaction of stressors with receptors. Measures 

of exposure can include concentrations of contaminants in the environmental 

compartments or residues bioaccumulated on biota 

Effects – are the changes that occurred in the eco-receptors as a consequence of 

exposure to stressor(s).

The integration of data from exposure and effect assessments leads to an estimation 

of risk (Figure I.1). When the potential for exposure and effects are low, the risk will be 

low. When both are high, the risk will be high.

(1997). 

 

 

A tiered approach is usually adopted in the ERA process. Lower-tier assessments are 

based on limited data and reasonable worst-case assumptions and higher-tier 

assessments are based on more realistic and complex data. Throughout the tier approach 

the assessment of exposure and effects is refined and the uncertainty associated to the 

risk characterization in reduced (Maltby, 2006). 

Risk assessments may be performed for different environmental compartments (i.e. 

terrestrial, aquatic, atmospheric) and may be used to predict the likelihood of future 

adverse effects (prospective) or evaluate the likelihood that effects are caused by past 

exposure to stressors (retrospective). Prospective risk assessment is generally used to 

help the risk manager and regulators decide whether a chemical should be registered for 

commercial production and use, and if so, under what conditions and control measures. It 

is usually generic (non site-specific). On the other hand, the retrospective risk assessment 

evaluates the effects of chemicals after they have been used and released into the 

environment and is usually regional, local or site-specific. In general, it is focused in the 

effects of a single chemical or chemical source, but it can be applied to evaluate human-

induced changes that are considered undesirable as a result of multiple stressors, 

including chemical, physical and biological stressors (USEPA, 1998).  

ERA is subject to both variability and uncertainty (Regan et al., 2003). Variability is an 

inherent property of the system being investigated and includes interspecific, inter-

population and inter-individual differences in exposure and response as well as temporal 

and spatial differences in the biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems. Variability 

cannot be reduced by increased information or measurement, but it can be characterized 

and its influence minimized by careful selection of study systems. Uncertainty is due to 

imprecise or incomplete knowledge and is a property of the relationship between the 

study system and the risk assessor. Variable uncertainty arises from imprecise, inaccurate 

or inappropriate measurements and can be reduced by improving measurement 

techniques and study design. Uncertainty and variability inherent in the risk assessment 

process may mean that the real effects are larger than the estimated effects or vice-versa. 

Consequently, uncertainty and variability must be incorporated into the analysis of risk. 

Risk assessments are often based on information obtained on a small number of species, 

exposed to a single chemical under a given set of conditions for a limited period of time. 

This information is then used to estimate the generic risk of both short-term and long-

term exposure of complex ecosystems exposed to multiple stressors; a process that 

incorporates many uncertainties. Risk assessment procedures take one of two 

approaches to addressing uncertainty. The first, commonly applied to deterministic risk 

assessments, is to apply uncertainty (or assessment) factors to either model parameters 

or outputs; the second is to analyze uncertainty using probabilistic approaches (Maltby, 

2006). 

 

 

1.1.1. USEPA and European Commission (EC) Procedures for Risk Assessment 

USEPA was pioneer in the development of guidelines for ERA. In 1992 the Agency 

published “A Framework for Ecological Risk Assessment” which was later updated by the 

“Guidelines for Ecological Risk Assessment "in 1998. The USEPA procedure for ERA 

includes three major steps (Figure I.2): 



Chapter I 

 

30 

i) Problem formulation: clearly defining the problem.  

At this step, the available information on stressor and sources characteristics, 

pathways of exposure, characteristics of the ecosystems potentially at risk, and the 

ecological receptors are integrated. Three products are expected after this integration: 

the selection of assessment endpoints which are the ecosystem’s components or 

attributes of concern; a conceptual model that is a representation of the hypothesized 

exposure pathways of the different ecological receptors; and an analysis plan that 

delineates the design of the analysis, including measurement endpoints and assessment 

endpoints, and methods for conducting the analysis phase of the risk assessment; 

ii) Analysis: characterizing potential or existing exposure to stressors and their 

subsequent effects. 

The analysis phase includes two principal elements: characterization of exposure and 

characterization of ecological effects. During this process, the assessor quantifies the 

stressor release, its migration and fate and characterizes the eco-receptor(s). In addition, 

the ecological effects are characterized through the establishment of dose-responses 

relationships. This information is then used to evaluate questions arise during the 

problem formulation; 

iii) Risk characterization: integrating and evaluating exposure and effects information 

Risk characterization is the final phase of an ERA. It serves as the link between 

exposure and effects characterization providing an estimate of ecological risks. The 

process is based on exposure and stressor profiles developed according to the analysis 

plan.  

One of the major advantages of the USEPA procedure for ERA is related with its 

broad scope that permits the adaption to different environmental problems and 

considers scenarios with multiple stressors.

In 1996 the European Commission has also published the “Technical Guidance 

Document (TGD) on Risk Assessment for new and Existing Substances” (EC, 1996) 

concerning risks to both environment and human health. The TGD was revised recently 

taking into account the experience gained and was extended to the needs of biocides (EC, 

2003). The risk assessment procedure according the TGD consists of three steps (Figure

 i) Assessment of effects, comprising: 

  a) Hazard identification: identification of the adverse effects that a 

substance has an inherent capacity to cause; and 

  b) Dose (concentration) – Response (effects) assessment: estimation of the 

relationship between dose, or level of exposure to a substance, and the incidence and 

severity of an effect. Derived from the ecotoxicological data and the application of 

assessment factors a Predicted No-Effect Concentration (PNEC) is estimated; 

 ii) Exposure assessment: estimation of the Predicted Environmental Concentration 

(PEC), which is the concentration to which human populations or environmental 

compartments are or may be exposed. The environmental concentrations are estimated 

on a local level (PEClocal, concentration of a substance released from a point source 

assessed for a generic local) or on a regional level (PECregional, concentration of a substance 

from point and diffuse sources over a wider area); 

 iii) Risk Characterization: estimation of the incidence and severity of the adverse 

effects likely to occur in a human population or environmental compartment due to 

actual or predicted exposure to a substance, and may include “risk estimation”, i.e. the 

quantification of that likelihood. This step involves the calculation of a quotient: the 

PEC/PNEC ratio. If the PEC/PNEC ratio is above 1, the substance is “of concern” and 

further information should be need.  

This procedure is focused on single chemical stressors and therefore is not well suited 

to assess ecosystems subjected to multiple kinds of stressors (Moraes, 2002).

1.1.2. Challenges Associated with the ERA Process 

Some challenges facing ERA include the following: 

Chemical datasets: 

Regarding the larger quantity of chemicals released into the environment only a small 

fraction is well characterized and available in robust datasets. This ‘data-poor’ group 

includes most of the existing chemicals, pharmaceuticals, biocides and nanomaterials. To 

surpass this limitation a new regulatory framework for the Registration, Evaluation and 

Authorization of Chemicals (REACH) has been proposed by the EC. However it still exist 

some challenges associated with implementing this system due to the large number of 

chemicals to be processed and the lack of appropriate techniques for detecting, 

quantifying and assessing some of the chemicals concerned (Maltby, 2006). 

Different Modes of Action: 

The current procedures to evaluate the environmental effects are designed to detect 

these that occur during exposure and that can be measured in terms of changes in the 

survival, growth, reproduction or feeding rate of organisms. However, they cannot be 

readily applied to substances with reversible, latent or trans-generational effects, nor to 

substances that result in effects not detected using standard ecotoxicological endpoints. 

Some chemicals may elicit effects that occur after exposure, either because the chemical 

is slow-acting, or because changes in the organism’s physiology makes the chemical more 

toxic, or because the chemical disrupts a developmental process that only becomes 

apparent later in the life cycle of the organism. Latent effects have been reported for a 

number of carcinogens, endocrine disruptors and some pesticides (Maltby, 2006). The 

great challenge is to improve the understanding of the several toxic mode of action of 

chemicals and to use this understanding to develop more suitable risk assessments. 

Multiple kinds of stressors: 

In real systems chemical contamination rarely occur in isolation and ecosystems are 

also subject to a range of natural stressors. Nevertheless, current ERA procedures have 

limited application in scenarios constrained by multiple kinds of stressors. The 

development of assessment procedures that take into account combined effects, 

resulting from multiple kinds of stressor, still remains a challenge. Moreover, currently 



Chapter I 

 

35 

methods for evaluating the toxicity of chemicals mixtures, which combination could result 

in additive/synergistic effects, are poorly established (Van den Brink et al., 2002).  

Testing Different Species: 

In general, ERA take into account a limited set of toxicity data for a few 

representative species and extrapolate these data to a larger number of organisms. 

However, different species present varying sensitivities exposed to the same substances. 

In this way, additional and/or alternative standardized ecotoxicity tests using test species 

that replace or complement the species currently used are therefore needed to improve 

ERA of chemicals (OECD, 1998). 

 

 

1.2. Lake Vela 

Lake Vela located in the littoral-centre of Portugal (40º5´N 8º8´W, 45 m elevation), is a 

eutrophic freshwater shallow lake (mean depth =1.5 m) with 70 ha of surface area. This 

lake makes part of a larger system of interconnected reservoirs, commonly designated by 

the “Quiaios Lakes”, which are disposed in parallel with the coastline, in a sand-dune 

planed site. In agreement with the European Commission, Lake Vela was considered a 

natural habitat with community interest whose conservation requires the designation of 

special areas of conservation (MA, 1999), and was subsequently included in the Ecological 

European Net - Rede Natura 2000 (CM, 2000).  

Lake Vela is potentially exposed to nonpoint sources of pollution generated by 

agriculture and livestock which constitutes a threat to the aquatic ecosystem and human 

health (Fernandes, 1999; Abrantes et al., 2006a). Comprising 48% of its drainage basin 

area (Figure I.4), the agricultural lands are abundantly fertilized and pesticides (e.g., 

herbicides) are intensively used for pre-emergent control of weeds in corn crops, namely 

Lasso® and Roundup® (Abrantes et al., 2006a). The sandy nature of agricultural soils 

located on a sand dune plain (with low organic matter content and high permeability), the 

topography of the system, the discharges of aquifer into the lake (Fernandes, 1999), the 

existence of agricultural water channels in the direction of the lake and the shallow depth 

of the groundwater, are site-specific characteristics that enhance the risks of 



Chapter I 

 

36 

contamination of Lake Vela, namely through runoff or leaching. As a consequence of the 

exposure to nonpoint sources of pollution, this lake is facing serious environmental 

problems, namely by the higher input of nutrients that accelerate the eutrophication 

process, and pesticides that constitute a potential threat to aquatic life and human 

health.  

Although several studies have been relied on this aquatic system (e.g., Abrantes, 

2002; Barros, 1994; Alface, 1996; Ferreira, 1997; Pereira, 1997; Fernandes, 1999; 

Abrantes, 2006b; Castro, 2007), no ecotoxicological evaluation has been performed and 

no data exists on the risks to aquatic biota and human health.

1.3. Aim and Scope of the Thesis 

This study aimed to plan and to perform a retrospective risk assessment in Lake Vela to 

assess the risks posed by diffuse pollution (e.g., inputs of pesticides and nutrients) on the 

aquatic ecosystem.  

At a national level, this study may provide important data to help the implementation 

and regular utilization of the ERA process as an important tool for evaluating the causes 

and consequences of environmental contamination and for support site restoration and 

management decisions. 

 

 

1.4. Thesis Structure  

This thesis is composed by seven chapters. Chapter II, III, IV, V and VI correspond to 

manuscripts that were submitted to SCI journals, being two of them already published. 

 

Chapter I – Some background information on the ecological risk assessment process 

is presented, including the description of the USEPA and EC procedures for ERA and the 

major challenges associated with the risk assessment process. This chapter also presents 

a general description of the aquatic system of Lake Vela and the environmental problems 

posed by diffuse pollution. 

 

Chapter II – This chapter provides the basis for the entire ERA. It presents background 

information about Lake Vela, suggests a conceptual model integrating suspected sources 

of stressors with the defined endpoints and describes a plan to analyse data and to 

characterize the potential risks for the aquatic ecosystem. 

 

Chapter III – A characterization of exposure was performed through the 

determination of pesticide residues in different compartments of Lake Vela system: 

surface water, groundwater, sediments and fish tissues. To assess potential concern for 

effects on ecosystem and human health, the measured concentrations of pesticides were 

compared with regulatory and toxicological benchmarks, in a preliminar assessment of 

risks. 



Chapter I 

 

38 

Chapter IV - A whole sample toxicity assessment was used to evaluate the toxicity of 

water and sediment samples from Lake Vela on freshwater species. To increase the 

ecological relevance of the bioassays providing useful and reliable information about 

potential effects to resident species and to comparatively analyse differences in 

sensitivity between species, local as well as standard species were used. In order to 

evaluate the spatial and temporal variations of Lake Vela contamination, this study was 

performed seasonally, throughout one year, and two sampling sites at Lake Vela were 

selected: one in the east margin near agricultural fields and the other in the opposite 

margin, surrounded by a pine-tree forest. 

 

Chapter V – The seasonal variations in the phytoplankton and cladoceran 

communities of Lake Vela and their interactions were evaluated throughout one year. 

This study allowed understanding the behaviour and linkages between the trophic levels 

under advanced trophic conditions and therefore contributes to understand the natural 

variability of the ecosystem. 

 

Chapter VI – A terrestrial model ecosystem was used to assess the potential leaching 

of the herbicide Lasso® in agricultural soils around the lake and their ecotoxicological 

impact on non-target freshwater species. To attain this purpose agricultural soil cores 

were collected and used to simulate the leaching of a pesticide in laboratorial conditions 

following local agricultural practices for pesticides application and crop irrigation. 

Thereafter the toxicity of leachates was assessed through standard toxicity assays with 

algae and cladoceran species. 

 

Chapter VII – A general discussion is presented. Through a weight-of-evidence 

approach, in which the different assessed lines of evidence (chemical concentrations: in 

water, sediment and groundwater; body burden; biological surveys; toxicity tests) were 

evaluated, it was possible to infer about the risks posed by diffuse pollution on the 

aquatic ecosystem and human health.

Abstract 

Lake Vela, located in the Portuguese littoral-centre, is a temperate shallow lake exhibiting 

a high trophic status. This aquatic ecosystem has been potentially exposed to 

contamination generated by agricultural and livestock activities held in their drainage 

basin, which seriously compromise their health. This work summarizes some background 

information and presents the problem formulation step of the ERA. Therefore, it 

evaluates the characteristics of the stressor(s), describes the ecological system and 

receptors and suggests a conceptual model, which predicts the potential exposure 

pathways, relating suspected sources to the defined endpoints. This introductory step 

also described an analysis plan on the entire study, which includes a delineation of the 

assessment design, data needs, measures, and methods for conducting the analysis phase 

of the risk assessment process.

Nonpoint sources of pollution constitute a problem of increasing concern all over the 

world. Identified as one of the mainly universal sources of diffuse pollution, the 

agriculture, through the use of pesticides and fertilizers, contributes to physical and 

chemical changes in water properties, which are reflected in the biological integrity of the 

aquatic communities. Agrochemicals have been detected in surface waters (e.g., Kruhm-

Pimpl et al., 1993; Larson et al., 1997; Tanik et al., 1999) and ground waters (e.g., 

Meinardi et al., 1995; Barbash and Resek, 1997; Cerejeira et al., 2003), and their toxic 

effects on aquatic organisms are well-documented.  

Lakes are especially endangered ecosystems because of the risk of high pollutant 

loads from anthropogenic activities in a shallow water body with low dilution capacity. 

Eutrophication is one of the major and common problems of the lakes. However, the 

chemical contamination from diffuse sources also affects their balance. In this way, the 

need to protect the lakes was already underlined by the European Commission in the 

European Framework Directive for Community Actions in the Field of Water Policy (EC, 

2000).  

Due to Lake Vela natural relevance, several studies have been relied on this aquatic 

system. Thus, its limnology has been well described by different authors (e.g., Alface, 

1996; Ferreira, 1997; Abrantes, 2002). Other studies (e.g., Barros, 1994; Pereira, 1997; 

Fernandes, 1999) revealed the awareness about ecological threats for the ecosystem 

balance. Barros (1994) evaluated the ecotoxicological implications of cianobacterial group 

in cladocerans, Pereira (1997) presented a management plan for Lake Vela and Fernandes 

(1999) realised a global and integrative analysis of the eutrophic process based on 

analytical techniques and simulation models. However, the ecological effects of potential 

stressors in Lake Vela ecosystem have not been studied yet.  

Recently occurrences in Lake Vela (e.g., large fish kills, toxic algal blooms) triggered 

the development of a plan for an ERA in the lake and its drainage basin. This ERA process 

will be performed to assess potentially adverse effects, occurring in the aquatic life as a 

result of exposure to different chemicals and to provide sound scientific knowledge, in 

order to support decisions regarding management strategies and conservation measures.

This article provides the basis for the entire ERA. It presents background information 

of the site, suggests a conceptual model relating suspected sources of stressors with the 

defined endpoints and describes a plan to analyse data and to characterize the potential 

risks for Lake Vela ecosystem. 

 

 

2.2. Methods 

The methodologies used to assess the ecological risks in Lake Vela posed by diffuse 

sources of organic and chemical pollution, follow the USEPA Guidelines for Ecological Risk 

Assessment (USEPA, 1998). ERA was defined by USEPA (1992) as the process that 

“evaluates the likelihood that adverse ecological effects may occur or are occurring as a 

result of exposure to one or more stressors”. Through the identification of potential risks 

it is possible to recognize environmental problems, to select priorities for environment 

protection, to select targets to control, to compare the efficacy of management options, 

and identify research needs. Moreover, ERA provides a critical component enabling risk 

managers to make well-founded environmental decisions. The USEPA procedure for ERA 

can be carried out either to predict the likelihood of future adverse effects (a priori) or to 

determine the likelihood whose effects are caused by past exposure to stressors (a 

posteriori). It starts with a problem formulation step, which is a planning and scooping 

process that establishes the goals of the risk assessment. Furthermore, there is an 

analysis phase consisting of exposure and ecological effects assessment, followed by the 

risk characterization, the last step that estimates the risk through integration of the 

results obtained in the exposure and effect analysis. 

During the problem formulation, available information for the area is described, 

assessment endpoints are selected, conceptual models are constructed and a plan for 

analysing and characterising risks is determined.

2.3. Problem Formulation 

 

2.3.1. Description of the System 

Lake Vela located in the littoral-centre of Portugal (40º5´N 8º8´W, 45 m elevation), is an 

eutrophic freshwater shallow lake (mean depth =1.5 m) with 70 ha of surface area. This 

lake makes part of a larger system of interconnected reservoirs, commonly designated by 

the “Quiaios lakes”, which are parallelly disposed along the coastline, in a sand-dune 

planed site. It is limited in the East side by agricultural fields and some human 

settlements, and in the West side by a forest road, which is separated from the lake by 

pinetrees (Pinus pinaster) and acacias (Acacia spp.) (Figure II.1).

fields, stables for livestock and human settlements. 

 

The littoral-centre of Portugal is located in the Mediterranean-iberoatlantic group of 

the Mediterranean region, being the climate strongly influenced by the proximity of the 

Atlantic Ocean. Hence, it is characterized by dry and moderately hot summers and mild 

rainy winters, with a long wet period that starts in October and finishes in February. The 

total annual precipitation is of 900 mm, with monthly values higher to 100 mm in 

autumn-winter and lower to 10 mm in summer. Mean solar radiation is of 300 

cal/cm
2
.day and the annual mean temperature is about 18ºC, with summer and winter 

averages of 23-24ºC and 12-14ºC, respectively (Fernandes, 1999).

In agreement with the European Commission, Lake Vela was considered a natural 

habitat with community interest whose conservation requires the designation of special 

areas of conservation (MA, 1999), and was subsequently included in the Ecological 

European Net - Rede Natura 2000 (CM, 2000). This lake was also classified as a first level 

natural area protection, by the Municipal Director Plan of Figueira da Foz, defined on 30
th

 

of December of 1993. In addition, Lake Vela is a freshwater system included in the Baixo 

Mondego natural areas list, according to PROT/RCL (Plano Regional de Ordenamento do 

Território da Região Centro Litoral) (CCRC, 1994). In fact, the PROT/RCL, defines a natural 

zone as “a national territorial area provided with faunistic, floristic and landscape 

variables, which individual or ecological characteristics enhance the area merit, therefore 

contributing to Portuguese natural heritage enrichness”. Subsequently, the preservation 

and utilization of this area should be constrained.  

In relation to the lake hydrology, besides the precipitation that falls directly in the 

water body (10 % of the input), water also enters in Lake Vela from superficial and 

subterraneous fluxes (67% and 23% of the input, respectively). These fluxes are generated 

in the drainage basin, which is due to the slope of the piezometric surface towards the 

lake depression. The excess of water is drained by the Zurrão waterway, which runs to the 

South. The water circulation in this waterway corresponds to the largest proportions of 

outputs (76%), being the remainder (24%) attributed to evaporation (Fernandes, 1999). 

Hence, the hydric regime of Lake Vela presents a balance between, on the one hand, the 

output of water by the Zurrão waterway and the input by superficial fluxes, and, on the 

other, by the evaporation and the subterraneous fluxes, being the maximum stored 

volume of 7.0E+05

(Figure II.2). The retention time of water shows an annual average 

of 130 days, with a water renovation rate of 2.8 m

2.3.2. Biotic Characterization 

During the year, Lake Vela presents an elevated diversity of aquatic vegetation. In a total 

amount of 50 species, the macrophytes identified in this system are distributed among 25 

families of four taxonomic divisions: Charophyta, Chorophyta, Pteridophyta and 

Espermatophyta (Machás, 1995). This community was characterized by the dominance of 

Cladium mariscus, Myriophyllum verticillatum, Nymphaea alba and species from Poaceae 

family (Machás, 1995). However, nearly 80-90% of the flooded lakebed does not contain 

any vegetation (Fernandes, 1999).  

Phytoplanktonic community of Lake Vela was characterized by seven taxonomic 

groups – Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta, Cryptophyta, Chrysophyta, Dinophyta, 

Euglenophyta and Cyanobacteria – with a total of 49 genus. The taxonomic groups that 

showed higher abundance levels are the Bacillariophyta in Winter, the Chlorophyta in 

Spring and the Cyanobacteria in Summer (Barros, 1994; Fernandes, 1999; Antunes et al., 

2003). The dominant species of Cyanobacteria is the colonial algae Microcystis 

aeruginosa. Chlorophyta is mainly represented by the big size coccoid forms (e.g., 

Coelastrum sp., Pediastrum sp. and Scenedesmus sp.) and Bacillariophyta is mainly 

represented by Cyclotella sp. (Pereira, personal communication).  

According to Rodrigues et al. (1993), the zooplankton was characterized by the 

dominance of rotifers in detriment of the cladocerans and copepods. The major 

cladoceran species recorded was Daphnia longispina, Ceriodaphnia pulchella and 

Bosmina longirostris (Barros, 1994; Abrantes, 2002; Antunes, et al. 2003). The mainly taxa

recorded for the macroinvertebrate community were Hydracarina and Ephemeroptera 

(IAV, 1994).  

The fish community is composed by six species distributed for five families. The 

prevalent species are: pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus), mosquitofish (Gambusia 

holbrooki) and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), which are all introduced species 

(Castro, personal communication). For the herpetologic community eleven species of 

amphibians were identified (65% of the total species described in Portugal) and ten 

species of reptiles (IAV, 1994). The amphibians European tree frog (Hyla arborea), nurse 

frog (Alytes obstetricans), Western spadefoot (Pelobates cultripes) and natterjack toad 

(Bufo calamita) are species that are strictly protected by the Berna Convention (MNE, 

1981) and jointly with the Iberian painted frog (Discoglossus galganoi) and marbled newt 

(Triturus marmoratus) are considered species with community interest in need of strict 

protection (MA, 1999). The amphibian Portugal painted frog (Discoglossus galganoi) is 

also a species whose conservation require the designation of special areas of 

conservation (MA, 1999). As well, the reptiles Iberian wall lizard (Podarcis hispanica) and 

grass snake (Natrix natrix) are species with community interest that require a rigorous 

protection (MA, 1999). In relation to Lake Vela avifauna, it was already registered the 

presence of twelve species (IAV, 1993, 1994; Farinha and Trindade, 1994; Fernandes, 

1999). Cattle egret (Bulbucus ibis), Black- necked grebe (Podiceps nigricolis) and little 

grebe (Podiceps ruficollis) are species that are strictly protected by the Berna Convention 

(MNE, 1981). Ferruginous duck (Aythya nyroca) is a rare species according the Red Book 

of Portuguese Vertebrates (SEADC and SNPRCN, 1990) and is also considered to be a 

priority species with community interest, whose conservation require the designation of 

special areas of protection (MA, 1999). Regarding mammals whose habits depend on the 

aquatic environment, the otter´s (Lutra lutra) presence has already been reported in Lake 

Vela (Trindade et al., 1998). This species is strictly protected by the Berna Convention 

(MNE, 1981), is classified as insufficiently known by the Red Book of Portuguese 

Vertebrates (SEADC and SNPRCN, 1990) and is a species with community interest, whose 

conservation requires the designation of special areas of conservation and requires a 

strict protection (MA, 1999).

2.3.3. Sources of Contamination 

Agriculture constitutes one of the main sources of diffuse pollution in the world (Meinardi 

et al., 1995; Loague et al., 1998). Agrochemicals, namely fertilizers and pesticides, play an 

important role in modern agriculture. Furthermore, they are produced and spread into 

the environment in huge quantities.  

Nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) can naturally occur in water, however the 

fertilizers run off, livestock production, discharges from domestic sewage, land erosion, 

and other sources, may increase their concentrations significantly (Hem, 1985; Wetzel, 

1993). Although a pesticide is usually applied to act on a specific target (e.g., a pest or 

weed), it may cause effects on non-target species through environmental transport 

processes. The transport of pesticides from the fields to the surrounding waters may 

occur by volatilization/deposition, run off and leaching (Barbash and Resek, 1997). These 

processes are constrained by climatic factors like rainfall, wind, temperature and 

topography of the area (Kolpin, 1997; Burkart et al., 1999). Pesticides solubility, soil 

mobility and rate of degradation are the most important properties often used to predict 

their potential to contaminate the aquatic environment (Eke et al., 1996; Kolpin, 1997). 

Indeed, the characteristics of the environmental compartment where the agrochemicals 

are released on, also influence their dispersion. In this way, the texture and structure of 

the soil as well as the amount of organic matter are factors that affect adsorption of 

agrochemicals to soil and, thus, their transport (Barbash and Resek, 1997). In addition, 

the agricultural practices and techniques, evolving amounts and formulations of 

compounds, also constrain their transport, degradation and transformation rates (Gish et 

al., 1995; Hansen et al., 2000; Wente, 2000).  

Due to the sandy nature of soil (with higher permeability) and the small depth of the 

groundwater, Lake Vela is potentially exposed to contamination generated by agricultural 

and livestock activities. The drainage basin of Lake Vela, defined by Fernandes (1999), 

show at the East site an intense agricultural activity (Figure II.1) characterized by small 

rural proprieties and based in the broad groundwater exploration, where the mainly 

crops are corn and grass for livestock. Owing to the poor nature of the sandy soils, the 



Chapter II 

 

53 

lands are abundantly fertilised with organic compounds (livestock manures) and 

chemicals (syntheticals fertilizers). Inquiries realised by Pereira (1997) confirm the use of 

fertilizers, such as Foskamonio 111® and elementary manures, and also refers to the 

frequent application of herbicides, like Roundup® and Lasso®. According to the local 

farmers indications, the fertilization rates are about 150 Kg of N/ha·year (20% of organics 

fertilizers and 80% of chemical fertilizers) and 50-60 Kg of P/ha·year (more than 90% 

correspond to chemical fertilizers). In relation to the herbicides, the amount used per 

application are about 2-10 Lha
-1

 of Roundup® and 4-5Lha
-1

 of Lasso®. Mixtures for 

application are made by diluting 1 L of concentrate in 100 L of water, resulting a 

concentration of 4.8 gL
-1

 of alachlor (active ingredient of Lasso®) and a concentration of 

3.6gL
-1

 of glyphosate (active ingredient of Roundup®).  

Glyphosate (N-phosphonomethilglycine) is a non-selective herbicide registered for 

preemergent and pre-harvest use in crops. It is generally sold as the isopropylamine salt 

and applied as a liquid foliar spray, being among the most widely used broad-spectrum 

herbicide in the world, including Portugal, with a total annual of sales of 669,041 Kg 

(Vieira, 2004). Glyphosate may enter aquatic systems through surface runoff, spray drift 

and accidental spraying. As a result of adsorption to suspended particulate matter or 

sediments and microbial degradation it dissipates rapidly from water, with a half-life in 

water ranging from a few days to 2 weeks (Giesy et al., 2000). Sediments constitute the 

primary sink for glyphosate (USEPA, 2002a).  

Alachlor (2-chloro-2’,6’-diethyl-N-methoxymethilacetanilidae) is the second most 

widely used herbicide in Portugal, with a total annual of sales of 256,359 Kg (Vieira, 2004). 

It is used for preemergent control of annual grasses and broadleaf weeds in crops. Soil 

sorption coefficient values (log Koc=2.08-2.28) indicate that alachlor would have a medium 

to high mobility in soil, allowing their leaching from soil to groundwater. The less of 

alachlor in groundwater free aquifers materials (as Lake Vela groundwater aquifer) was 

very slow, with a half-life ranging from 808 to 1518 days (USEPA, 2002b). Surface runoff 

of alachlor is also a pathway of water contamination, but the average half-life in surface 

waters is low (6.5-8 days) (Aga and Thurman, 2001). Both photolysis and biodegradation 

are important for the dissipation of alachlor in water. Alachlor makes part of the list of 



Chapter II 

 

54 

priority substances defined by the European Commission (EC, 2001), whose substantial 

risk for the aquatic system demands a progressive reduction or cessation.  

The livestock breeding, the respective manure production and the untreated 

domestic sewage accumulated in septic tanks are also other possible sources of Lake Vela 

contamination.  

 

2.3.4. Assessment Endpoints 

Assessment endpoints are explicit expressions of the ecological resources being protected 

and measured in a risk assessment analysis. They can be defined at different levels of 

biological organization (e.g., individual, population, community, ecosystem or region) 

(USEPA, 1998). From a regulatory perspective, it is important to define the assessment 

endpoints, which should be chosen in a reliable and valid manner. As suggested by USEPA 

(1992), Suter (1993), Barton and Sergeant (1998) and Fisher et al. (2001), the selection of 

assessment endpoints in this study (Table II.1) was based on several concerns related to 

ecological, methodological and management arguments, including: i) their ecological 

relevance, based on their role to help sustain the natural structure and their diversity in 

Lake Vela; ii) their susceptibility to potential stressors, namely for pesticides and high 

organics loads of nutrients presents in Lake Vela; iii) their relevance to management 

goals. It is important that assessment endpoints reflect societal values, which will always 

be considered together with the ecological information; iv) their position in the food-

webs, including producers, primary consumers and higher trophic groups, which are 

exposed at different levels of contamination; v) the easily to measure their characteristics 

directly or the possibility to use measures that are easily monitored and modelled. 

According to the environmental regulations stated for Lake Vela (see description of 

the system) it is extremely important to protect the fauna and flora in this natural area. 

Thus, the main management goal of the risk assessment for Lake Vela is to provide 

information to support the management dealing with the protection of the aquatic 

environment.

2.3.5. Conceptual Model  

The conceptual model represents the relationships between stressors and ecological 

entities, and includes two principal components: the risk hypotheses and the conceptual 

model diagram. Risk hypotheses articulate the links among stressors, potential exposure 

and predicted effects on an assessment endpoint, based on available information and risk 

assessor judgments. The conceptual model diagrams are a visual representation of the 

risk hypotheses, providing a dynamic analysis of relationships. According to Suter (1999), 

conceptual models are essential tools that will be used as an intermediate step in the ERA 

development. A conceptual model diagram of exposure of Lake Vela aquatic communities 

to stressors is represented in the Figure II.3.

predict or postulate why ecological effects occurred and what caused the effect. The 

hypotheses for this ERA are presented below, and are described for each stressor: 

Nutrients:  

The increase of nutrients load as result of anthropogenic activities in Lake Vela, may 

be responsible for an increase of the phytoplankton biomass. As the primary producers 

community undergoes changes, the structure of communities along the trophic web is 

subsequently affected. The phytoplankton increase leads to the high turbidity of water, 

which in turn, may contribute to the depletion of the submerged macrophytes 

community (Freedman, 1989; Caraco, 1993; Klinge et al., 1995). This fact enables changes 

in communities structure, as it reduces the surface area for algal fixation, the habitat and 

refuge for zooplankton, macroinvertebrates, fish and waterbirds, as well as it impairs the 

slow biomass growth, which is responsible for long-term storage of nutrients removed 

from water-column and sediment (McDougal and Goldsborough, 1996). On the other 

hand, eutrophication can lead to the reduction of phytoplankton communities, for 

example, the diversity, species richness and evenness of diatom communities can 

decrease in response to organic enrichment (Steinman and McIntire, 1990). Additionally, 

some phytoplankton taxa that respond more swiftly than others to increases in nutrients, 

as cyanobacteria, were favoured. 

The quantity and quality of available food define the dominant zooplanktonic group, 

whose populations adjust it to present conditions (Margalef, 1983). Thus, the increase of 

water trophic level favours the rotifers dominance in detriment to the cladocera and 

copepods (Pereira et al., 2002). In addition, the eutrophication process favours the 

development of cyanobacterial blooms including toxic species, and the subsequent 

replacement of the common Daphnia by small cladocera (Klinge, 1995; Jeppesen et al., 

1999). In an advanced eutrophication process a reduction in the number of chironomides 

and other benthonic organisms may be observed, while the number of oligochaeta and 

the benthonic biomass may increase (Wetzel, 1993). Indeed, the fish community could be 

profoundly affected, occurring the replacement of autochthonous species, more 

susceptible, by exotic species like perch (Margalef, 1983). The other trophic chain levels 

(e.g., insects, amphibians, birds and mammals, including humans) may also be subjected 



Chapter II 

 

58 

to changes induced by the increase of the trophic state of the aquatic systems. 

Ultimately, the increase of nutrients concentrations (P and N) can promote the excessive 

production of phytoplankton, which eventually dies and is decomposed by 

microorganisms that are responsible for the elevated rates of organic matter 

decomposition and the subsequent hypoxia, leading to kill off fish and other aquatic life 

forms (Brönmark and Weisner, 1992). 

Pesticides:  

There is an evident risk that pesticides may end up in waters close to agricultural 

areas, as in Lake Vela (Pereira, 1997). When pesticides enter aquatic systems through 

environmental transport processes (e.g., runoff, volatilization and leaching) they may 

cause serious problems because they are specifically created to kill organisms.  

The level of pesticides in the aquatic ecosystems are often enough to cause effects in 

several organisms and affect the composition and structure of communities (Hanazato, 

2001). Macrophytes are strongly affected by pesticides, namely herbicides (Lewis, 1995), 

and as aforementioned, changes in their community enable subsequent changes in other 

trophic levels. Alterations in zooplankton community structure induced by pesticides may 

also alter the balance of lake ecosystems (Hanazato, 1998).  

The normal flux of energy mediated by algae-zooplankton-fish is modified in a lake 

impacted by pesticides, which is due to the replacement of Daphnia sp. by smaller 

zooplankters such as rotifers and Bosmina (Hanazato, 2001). In this case, the primary 

production is transferred upwards, due to longer food chains that include invertebrate 

predators. Therefore, due to energy loss during transfer, from one trophic level to 

another, the efficiency of energy flux from primary producers to top predators is lower in 

a pesticide–contaminated lake. 

Benthic feeders in permanent contact with pesticides sorbed to the sediment are also 

potentially exposed to pesticides. Certain pesticides tend to accumulate in organisms and 

tend to biomagnify along the food web, therefore enhancing the risk exposure for the top 

predators (fish, waterbirds, otters and humans). Once fishery is a recreative activity often 

practiced in Lake Vela (MAPA, 1990), the ingestion of contaminated fish may affect the 

human health. Moreover, as amphibian habits are intimately linked to the aquatic 



Chapter II 

 

59 

systems, they are particularly vulnerable to their contamination or alteration. Amphibians 

decline has been well documented (e.g., Blaustein and Wake, 1990; Wake, 1991; 

Blaustein et al., 1994; Carey et al., 1999; Green, 2003), however the causes are not yet 

cleared up.  

 

2.3.7. Analysis Plan  

The analysis plan includes the pathways and relationships between different analysis 

steps (characterization of exposure, characterization of effects and characterization of 

risk), and delineates the methods and measures that will be used to conduct each one 

(Figure II.4).

2.3.7.1. Characterization of Exposure 

The characterization of exposure begins with the description of sources and the 

respective generated stressors. This step will be based on the acquisition of maps, aerial 

images and the compilation of relevant data (e.g., gathered together from previous 

studies, observations of local environmental problems and changes, and contacts with 

local farmers and inhabitants).  

In order to evaluate the distribution of stressors several data will be compiled to 

characterize the ecosystem (e.g., topography, hydrology, pH, temperature, hardness, 

dissolved oxygen, conductivity) and the stressors (e.g., physico-chemical properties, 

persistence, transformation, mobility, bioaccumulation and depuration). In this way, 

models of transportation will be adopted or developed for present contaminants in Lake 

Vela. In addition to this, for temporal and spatial stressors distribution various field 

measurements will be conducted in water, sediment and biota (fish tissues) 

compartments, following APHA (1995), USEPA (2001) and USEPA (2000) methodologies, 

respectively. Sediments can be a sink of contaminants which concentrations may reach 

much higher levels than those in the upper water-column. Thereby, long-term exposure 

can often produce adverse effects to aquatic life (Viganò, 2000). Fish are an important 

food resource for some waterbirds and otters in Lake Vela. Furthermore, once 

recreational fishing is practised, the consumption of contaminated fish may represent a 

risk for human health, thus justifying its use as bioindicators of local pollution. According 

to the USEPA (2000) two different species will be analysed: a predator species 

(Micropterus salmoides) and a bottom feeder species (Cyprinus carpio). Different 

sampling sites will be defined in the margin close to agricultural fields and in the opposite 

one, as well as in output and input waterways. Moreover, wells located in the drain basin 

will also be considered in order to assess groundwater contamination. The input of 

agrochemicals to the aquatic systems often occurs in pulses rather than by continuous 

exposure (Handy, 1994), what is mainly related to climacteric conditions (e.g., the 

precipitation enables the runoff and leaching of contaminants to the aquatic system). 

Therefore, having in mind these factors, samplings will be performed seasonally (one per 

season). 



Chapter II 

 

61 

The third objective is to describe the co-occurrence between stressors and receptors. 

This relationship is evaluated by comparing stressor distributions with receptor 

characteristics. In an attempt to characterize the receptors data regarding habitat, 

reproduction, feeding habits and sensitiveness to contaminants should be compiled. 

Biomarkers are considered a useful tool for indicating exposure and also for determining 

the likely effects if exposure continues (Beliaeff and Burgeot, 2002; Hyne and Maher, 

2003). Several sensitive and feasible groups of biomarkers suggested by Van der Oost et 

al. (2003) for ERA programs will be assessed in Micropterus salmoides and Cyprinus 

carpio, namely phase I enzymes (e.g., cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) and ethoxyresorufin 

O-deethylase (EROD)), genotoxic parameters (e.g., hepatic DNA adducts) and 

physiological and morphological parameters (e.g., histopathology).  

Available data related to the quantification of distribution and degradation of the 

stressors will be used to calculate the predicted exposure concentration (PEC) in surface 

water and sediments (EC, 2003). Overall information regarding exposure and receptors 

will be integrated by a Geographical Information System (GIS), therefore allowing the 

evaluation of their co-occurrence. Finally, conclusions will be summarized in an exposure 

profile. 

 

2.3.7.2. Characterization of Ecological Effects 

In order to characterize the ecological effects, changes in attributes of the ecological 

entities in response to stressors will be analysed (Table II.1). Two principal lines of 

evidence will support the assessment of the ecological effects: toxicity tests and biological 

surveys.  

After knowing the main pesticides used in the study area, the effects of these 

products (either commercial products or active ingredients) will be tested in laboratory. 

In agriculture, however, it is common the use of different compounds to destroy different 

target plants. Thus, the laboratory tests will be performed with the individual products 

and their mixture.  

For phytoplankton toxicity test (growth inhibition test; OECD, 1984) will be used the 

green alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and the cyanobacteria Aphanizomenon flos-



Chapter II 

 

62 

aquae. Laboratory tests with zooplankton (acute and reproduction tests; OECD, 2000a 

and OECD, 1996, respectively) will be developed with the standard Daphnia magna and 

the most representative cladoceran of Lake Vela - Daphnia longispina, being analysed 

their survival, growth and reproduction. Toxicity tests with fish (acute and juvenile growth 

test) will be developed according to OECD (1992) and OECD (2000b) guidelines, 

respectively, and will be used two of the prevalent species in Lake Vela: Lepomis gibbosus 

and Gambusia holbrooki. For amphibians acute toxicity test (ASTM, 1996) will be chosen 

the species Rana perezi, which is a widely distributed and abundant species, and the 

effects will be conducted on all three life stages (embryo, larvae, and adult).  

Toxicity laboratory tests (acute and chronic) with Lake Vela water and elutriates will 

be carried out using the above-mentioned species. Methods for performing receiving 

water tests and elutriates toxicity tests are described by USEPA (1993, 2002c) and USEPA 

and USACE (1998), respectively. Hence, it will be defined a number of sampling sites to 

collect the water and the sediment, which will be coincident with the sampling sites 

selected in the characterization of exposure. In addition to laboratory tests, data referred 

to chemical toxicity will be compiled. If possible, it will be determined, for each species, 

the lethal concentration for 50% of a group of organisms (LC50), the no observed effect 

concentration (NOEC) and the lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC). 

In relation to the biological surveys, it will be recorded the richness and abundance of 

several ecological entities defined from Lake Vela. USEPA (2003) provides a description of 

the most appropriate sampling location, the most advisable sampling gear and 

information about sample processing and effort. The sampling sites that will be 

considered to perform this analysis will be the same as those ones mentioned above. Due 

to natural seasonal changes in the structure and composition of communities, this 

evaluation will be repeated along the year, temporally coinciding with the exposure 

analysis. Comparing the obtained results with previous limnological works will be possible 

to evaluate the evolution of the lake status. 

From the available toxicity data a predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) will be 

calculated for several entities according to the European Commission (EC, 2003). The final 

results of ecological effects will be compiled in a profile document.

2.3.7.3. Characterization of Risks 

At last, risk characterization serving as the link between exposure and effects 

characterization provide an estimate of ecological risks. A weight-of-evidence approach 

that weighs multiple lines of evidence will be performed to characterize the risk, 

providing more accurate estimates of effects and more consistent conclusions (Suter et 

al., 1999; Stahl et al., 2000). The process is based on exposure and stressor profiles 

developed according to the analysis plan.  

ERA in Lake Vela is a complex process that involves the effects of multiple stressors in 

the ecosystem, which contains numerous species that are interlinked and dependent. 

Thus, risk estimates will be evaluated by using several techniques: field observational 

studies, quotient methods and models. The field studies will measure biological changes 

in the environment based on exposure and effects data for selected ecological entities, 

providing empirical evidence relationships. They present an advantage since they can be 

used to evaluate multiple stressors and complex ecosystem interlinks that cannot be 

reproduced in the laboratory (USEPA, 1998). Field survey data can be associated by 

multivariate analysis, permitting to interlink between exposure parameters, habitat 

characteristics and ecological entities parameters (Pielou, 1984, Ludwig and Reinolds, 

1988; Ter BraaK and Verdonshot, 1995). On the other hand, the variables resulting from 

field survey data can be combined and arranged as indices. The quotient methods, 

expressed as a ratio between exposure and effects (e.g., PEC/PNEC ratios), although 

present some limitations, they have advantages as they are simple, easy to use, and allow 

the integration of risks of several chemical agents (USEPA, 1998). The development of 

ecological models that incorporate field observations, exposure characteristics, and 

laboratory toxicity data will greatly help the risk characterization. A major advantage of 

using models for risk estimation is the possibility of predicting future scenarios and such 

ones can predict the outcome of different management options (Stahl et al., 2000). 

Lake Vela is potentially exposed to diffuse pollution, being evident the risks for its 

aquatic ecosystem. According to the researches that are being conducted in the area, we 

found the presence of several pesticides in the water (e.g., alachlor, aldrin, anthracene, 

dieldrin, glyphosate and hexachorophene), sediment (e.g., alachlor, aldrin, anthracene 



Chapter II 

 

64 

and glyphosate) and fish tissues (e.g., anthracene and alachlor), which confirmed their 

exposure and the potential bioaccumulation along the food web. In spite of the 

concentrations recorded to be lower than the values of LC50 described for phytoplankton 

and zooplankton organisms (PAN Pesticide Database, 2005), toxicity laboratory tests with 

Lake Vela water and elutriates showed sub-lethal effects on several standard and 

autochthonous species (except for the cyanobacteria Aphanizomenon flos-aquae) 

(unpublished data). In general, we observed a growth inhibition of the algae 

Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, and effects in normal reproductive and growth patterns 

of the cladocerans Daphnia magna and Daphnia longispina, with a decrease in the daily 

growth rate and in the number of offspring (unpublished data). Thus, our results 

indicated that the state of Lake Vela water and sediment represent a potential risk to 

phytoplankton and zooplanktonic communities, therefore constraining their viability. 

Additionally, as reported by Antunes et al. (2003), Lake Vela is now more eutrophic than 

10 years ago. The occurrence of algal blooms, the increase in turbidity, the reduction of 

biodiversity, and the occurrence of large fish kills are also some indicators of its alarming 

condition. In this way, the risks for the aquatic ecosystem are evident, probably 

compromising their entire wildlife and recreational use.  

 

 

2.4. Conclusion 

As a consequence of diffuse pollution, namely through the input of nutrients and 

pesticides, the aquatic ecosystem of Lake Vela is facing serious environmental problems. 

Hence, this lake is becoming a progressively more impoverished ecosystem, thereby 

requiring a profound characterization of its risks to the aquatic communities, in order to 

implement restoration measures to mitigate them. 

The environmental recovery actions in Portugal are based on impact assessment 

studies, which commonly consist of a compilation of biological survey data characterized 

by a little or absence of toxicological information. In order to surpass this setback, an ERA 

framework proposed by the USEPA was used to plan the assessment of ecological risks 

caused by the diffuse pollution generated in the drain basin of Lake Vela. ERA could be 



Chapter II 

 

65 

the best boarding to follow, since there is a flexible and integrative process of orderliness 

and analysis of information related to the entire ecosystem, having as main goal the 

evaluation of the likelihood that adverse ecological effects are caused by exposure to the 

stressors (USEPA, 1998).  

Because of the variability and complexity of natural environment, the first step of an 

ERA (problem formulation) is crucial and critical to provide a focus for the assessment. 

Complex investigations should include an integrated plan to permit the definition and 

prioritisation of tasks, hence allowing the scientific sound base elimination of some of 

them, which are reflected in terms of costs and time spent. ERA in Lake Vela is essentially 

retrospective and based on field observations and samplings. However, it is possible to 

apply for this analysis to predict future effects (e.g., related to human population 

increase, that leads to the increase of sewage, to the increase of livestock or the 

extension of agriculture with the subsequent increase of pesticides and fertilizers use), 

through the use of models.  

The ecological effects on aquatic organisms caused by agrochemicals in water are 

dependent both on the maximum concentrations that the contaminants may reach and 

on the exposure period of organisms to them. Differences in feeding, living habitats and 

trophic level of species can affect their exposure to pollutants. Thus, ERA procedure in 

Lake Vela suggests the use of different trophic levels to conduct the risk assessment and a 

sampling plan along the several seasons. The approach suggested to Lake Vela risk 

assessment is based on several lines of evidence (comparisons between measured 

concentrations and toxicity endpoints, toxicity tests and biological survey), thereby 

allowing the balance between opposite factors and, in this way, providing a process to 

attain a consistent and feasible conclusion regarding the risk estimate. 

Several aquatic systems in Portugal, or even in other countries, have analogous 

problems to that one of Lake Vela. Thus, the plan definition including its methodologies 

used in this study can also constitute useful tools to apply in similar places.

Abstract 

Lake Vela (Portugal), considered a natural habitat with community interest, has been 

potentially exposed to diffuse pollution generated by agricultural and livestock activities 

in its drainage basin, which seriously compromise its health. As part of the Ecological Risk 

Assessment proposed for Lake Vela ecosystem, this study aims to evaluate the pesticide 

exposure in different compartments: surface water, groundwater, sediments and fish 

tissues. To assess potential concerning effects on ecosystem and human health, the 

measured concentrations of pesticides were compared with regulatory and toxicological 

benchmarks. Residues of current and non-current pesticides, including two 

organochloride pesticides (OCPs) banned decades ago, were detected in surface water, 

groundwater and sediment. The measured concentrations of pesticides compared with 

toxicological benchmarks indicated that harmful effects are likely for aquatic species due 

to the presence of alachlor, aldrin and dieldrin. Additionally, the concentrations of 

pesticides detected in groundwater were also above the recommended safety levels for 

drinking water, which constitutes a concern for the local population’s health. Results also 

showed an accumulation of alachlor in predator and benthic fish species which could 

represent a risk to human consumers and particularly to the regular fish predators (e.g., 

otters and birds). Notwithstanding this initial assessment of exposure and risks provides 

useful information for the ERA process, it should be proceed through a weight-of-

evidence approach. 

 

 

Key words: Diffuse pollution, pesticides, ecological risk assessment, aquatic ecosystems, 

human health.

3.1. Introduction 

Lake Vela, located on the west coast of Portugal, is exposed to nonpoint sources of 

pollution generated by agriculture and livestock activities which are a potential threat to 

the aquatic ecosystem and human health (Fernandes, 1999; Abrantes et al., 2006a). 

Comprising 48% of its drainage basin area, the agricultural lands are abundantly fertilized 

and large amounts of pesticides (e.g,. herbicides) are used for pre-emergent control of 

weeds in corn crops, namely Lasso® and Roundup® (Abrantes et al., 2006a). The sandy 

nature of agricultural soils located on a sand dune plain (with low organic matter content 

and high permeability), the topography of the system, the discharges of aquifer into the 

lake (Fernandes, 1999), the existance of agricultural water channels in the direction of the 

lake and the shallowness of the groundwater, are site-specific characteristics that 

enhance the risks of contamination of Lake Vela, namely through runoff or leaching from 

the adjacent agricultural lands to the lake depression. As a consequence of nonpoint 

sources of pollution, this lake, similarly to several other Portuguese shallow lakes, is 

facing serious environmental problems, caused by the high input of nutrients that are 

accelerating the eutrophication process, and pesticides that constitute a potential threat 

to aquatic life and human health. Moreover, Lake Vela is frequently used as a recreational 

site, particularly for sport fishing and consequently the ingestion of contaminated fish 

could put health risks to consumers. The use of contaminated groundwater as drinking 

water can also be a pathway of human exposure and could constitute a great public 

health problem for the local population.  

Although Lake Vela has been well characterized in terms of its limnology (e.g., Barros, 

1994; Alface, 1996; Ferreira, 1997; Pereira, 1997; Fernandes, 1999; Abrantes, 2006b; 

Castro, 2007), any ecotoxicological evaluation was performed and no data exists on the 

risks to aquatic biota and human health. Therefore, a plan was defined for an Ecological 

Risk Assessment in Lake Vela (ERA) to evaluate the risks posed by diffuse pollution 

(Abrantes et al., 2006a). As part of this ERA, the aim of this study was give a contribution 

for the characterization of the exposure of ecological receptors and humans, through the 

determination of pesticide residues in different compartments: surface water, 

groundwater, sediments and biota (fish tissues). Furthermore, the concentrations

recorded were compared with the environment quality guideline values (EQGV) and 

benchmarks values. The generated information will be helpful in the preliminary 

assessment of the degree of pesticide contamination and of the potential risks to 

ecosystem and human health, providing risk assessors with relevant data for pursuing the 

ERA process. 

 

 

3.2. Material and Methods 

 

3.2.1. Study Area 

Lake Vela is a shallow (0.9 m average depth; 2.4 maximum depth) eutrophic lake located 

in the littoral of Portugal (40º5’N 8º8’W, 45 m elevation) with a surface area of 

approximately 70 ha. It is part of a larger system commonly known as “Quiaios Lakes”, 

which is comprised by a coastal belt of dunes and a pine forest, about 6 Km from the 

Atlantic Ocean. Lake Vela is bordered on the west side by pines trees and acacias, and on 

the east by agricultural fields, livestock farming and human settlements (Figure III.1). The 

hydric regime is mainly influenced by the superficial and subterraneous fluxes (67% and 

23%, respectively), the remainder being attributed to rainfall (Fernandes, 1999). Due to 

the slope of the piezometric surface towards the lake depression, the fluxes are 

effectively discharged into Lake Vela. The main crop in agricultural lands is corn for 

livestock whose cultivation starts with land tillage in late April and continues until 

September, when corn is harvested.  

Lake Vela was considered a natural habitat with interest within the European 

Community, being classified as a special area for conservation (MA, 1999), and 

subsequently included in the Ecological European Net - Rede Natura 2000 (CM, 2000).

water (SW), sediment (S) and groundwater (GW). 

 

3.2.2. Sampling Strategy and Storage 

To assess spatial variation in terms of contamination by pesticides, sediment (S) and 

subsurface water (SW) samples were collected from 5 sites of Lake Vela (Figure III.1): at 

the north, near the input waterway (SW1 and S1); at the east, in the margin surrounded 

by agricultural fields (SW2, S2, SW3 and S3); at the south, near the output waterway and 

also surrounded by agricultural lands (SW4 and S4); at the west, in the margin surrounded 

by the pine tree forest (SW5 and S5). To assess potential groundwater contamination, 

samples (GW1 and GW2) were taken from two wells located in the drainage basin of the 

lake with a Van Dorn bottle (Figure III.1). Water samples (subsurface and groundwater) 

were collected in a 5 L glass flasks following the USEPA recommendations (USEPA, 2002). 

Sediment samples (three samples per site) were collected according to the USEPA 

guidelines (USEPA, 2001) using a stainless steel corer and transferred into storage 

containers specially prepared for pesticide analysis. In the laboratory, the sediment 

samples were homogenised and sieved in a 2 mm mesh size sieve. In order to minimize 

the sampling heterogeneity the samples collected in each site were mixed to get a

composite sample. Water and sediment samples were stored in the dark at 4ºC 

(maximum storage time: 1 week) until analysis.  

Two fish species with different habitats and feeding strategies were sampled by 

electro-fishing: the predator Micropterus salmoides and the bottom-feeding Cyprinus 

carpio. The procedures of samples collection and handling followed the USEPA guidance 

for assessing chemical contamination in fish (USEPA, 2000). Composite samples of fish 

fillets (for predator) and whole fish (for bottom-dwelling), in a total of 5 individuals per 

composite, were wrapped in aluminium foil and frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored 

in a freezer (-18 °C) until analysis. Field samples (water, sediment and fish) were collected 

in summer, after the application of pesticides and in autumn, during the first seasonal 

rainfalls.  

 

3.2.3. Analytical Methods 

Based on the farmer’s information on the major pesticides used in the agricultural lands 

near Lake Vela [e.g., Roundup® (formulated with glyphosate – 360 gL
-1

)
 
and Lasso® 

(formulated with alachlor – 480 gL
-1

)] and considering the historic contamination, namely 

the persistent pesticides that were used in the past, the several collected samples were 

analysed for the presence of glyphosate, alachlor and organochlorine pesticides. The 

extraction procedure was carried out according to method no.3550B for Ultrasonic 

extraction published in the SW-846 manual (USEPA, 1996a). Concentrations of alachlor 

and organochlorine pesticides were determined by gas chromatography with an electron 

capture detector (GC/ECD) (USEPA, 1995, 1996b) and glyphosate by high-performance 

liquid chromatography (HPLC) (USEPA, 1999). 

 

3.2.4. Assessing Potential Risks on Aquatic Life and Human Health 

Concentrations of pesticides in surface water were compared with the water quality 

guideline values (WQGV) fixed by USEPA (2006) for protection of freshwater species and 

with the maximum admissible values (MAV) defined by the Portuguese legislation for 

surface waters (MA, 1998). To evaluate potential hazards to human health, the 

concentrations measured in groundwater were compared with the MAV established for 



Chapter III 

 

 

84 

drinking water according to the Portuguese legislation (MA, 1998) and compared with 

maximum contaminant level (MCL) defined by American and Canadian guidelines for 

drinking waters (HC, 2007; USEPA, 2007a). Since no Portuguese legislation exists, 

regarding the MAV for sediment, the concentrations of pesticides in sediment were only 

compared with the sediment quality guideline values (SQGV) fixed by Canadian Council of 

Ministers of the Environment (CCME) to protect benthic-dwelling species (CCME, 2001).  

Hazard quotients (HQ) were calculated for surface water and sediment in order to 

evaluate potential risks to aquatic life, according to the equation 1:  

HQ = (MC/LC50)×1000                     (1), 

where MC is the highest measured concentration in the environment, LC50 is the lowest 

literature LC50 for organisms inhabiting the water column and for sediment-dwelling 

organisms, and 1000 is the assessment factor applied when only short-term data is 

available to ensure that substances with the potential to cause adverse effects are 

identified, as defined by the Technical Guidance Document on Risk Assessment (EC, 

2003). For the aquatic compartment, at least one short-term test from each of three 

trophic levels of the base-set (algae, daphnids and fish) was considered, and for the 

sediment compartment, at least one short-term test with sediment-dwelling organisms 

was considered, according to EC (2003) recommendations. HQ higher than 1 indicates 

risks of concerning effects on aquatic life. 

 

 

3.3. Results and Discussion  

Pesticide residues were detected in the assessed compartments (water, sediment and fish 

tissues) (Figures III.2, III.3, III.4 and III.5), which confirmed the potential contamination of 

the Lake Vela system by agricultural nonpoint sources of pollution. In general, the highest 

concentrations were recorded in autumn which was related with seasonal rainfalls that 

promote the runoff and leaching of pesticides from the agricultural lands to the aquatic 

system.

Currently and non-currently used pesticides were found in all surface water samples 

(SW1, SW2, SW3, SW4 and SW5), namely the herbicides alachlor and glyphosate and the 

organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) aldrin and dieldrin (Figure III.2). Alachlor and glyphosate 

are the two most widely used herbicides in Portugal (Vieira, 2006) and are intensively 

used in the agricultural lands located in the drainage basin of Lake Vela (Abrantes, 2006a). 

The insecticides aldrin and dieldrin were banned decades ago in most European 

Community countries, including in Portugal (MAPA, 1988), however they are still found in 

the environment, as reported by recent studies in Europe (Neal et al., 2000; López-Flores 

et al., 2003; Gonçalves and Alpendurada, 2005, Peris et al., 2005). In fact, OCPs are 

characterized by low water solubility, high affinity to organic material and high half-life in 

soil (Table III.1), and thus soil constitutes an important reservoir in which residues can 

persist for long periods of time (&gt;7 yr) (Valle et al., 2005).

The presence of pesticides in all water samples reveals their dispersion throughout 

the whole water body. This evidence was expected due to the small area and shallow 

depth of Lake Vela and due to the strong wind typical of the East Atlantic Coast that 

contributes to the mixing and homogeneity of water. Nonetheless, SW2 and SW4 showed 

higher concentrations of pesticides compared with the other sampling sites. As illustrated 

by Figure III.1, SW2 and SW4 are bordered by agricultural fields and therefore are directly 

exposed to agrochemicals that enter the lake through surface runoff. SW3 is also 

surrounded by agricultural lands, however the existence of a large buffer zone, between

The concentrations of pesticides recorded in all the surface water samples were 

above the regulatory values defined by the Portuguese legislation for surface waters 

(MAV=0.5 gL
-1

 per single substance; MA, 1998) (Figure III.2). Moreover, concentrations 

of aldrin in SW2, SW4 and SW5, and dieldrin in all samples exceed the WQGV for 

protection of freshwater species (USEPA, 2006). Figure III.6a) shows that the risk 

threshold of an HQ equal to 1 was largely exceeded in all samples for alachlor, aldrin and 

dieldrin, indicating potential risks for the aquatic biota of Lake Vela (Figure III.2).  

With the exception of alachlor, the detected pesticides (glyphosate, aldrin and 

dieldrin) have high log Koc values and therefore their leaching to groundwater is unlikely 

(Table III.1). Nevertheless, all of them were detected in groundwater samples (Figure 

III.3). The sandy nature of agricultural soils (with high permeability and low organic 

matter content) and the shallow depth of the groundwater are site-specific characteristics 

that promote the leaching of agrochemicals and could explain the presence of slightly 

mobile pesticides in groundwater. Concentrations of alachlor, aldrin and dieldrin at GW1 

and GW2 were above the MCLs for drinking water defined by HC (2007) and USEPA 

(2007a) guidelines (Figure III.3). Moreover, all concentrations were also above the 

regulatory allowable values defined by the Portuguese legislation for drinking water

(MAV=0.1 gL
-1

 per single substance; MA, 1998). This evidence indicated that the use of 

groundwater for drinking water purposes is likely to put risks to human health. EPA has 

found that long-term exposure to alachlor potentially causes damages in the liver, kidney, 

spleen, nasal mucosa and eyes at levels above the MCL. Additionally, there exists 

evidence that alachlor is carcinogenic to humans for lifetime exposures at levels above 

the MCL (USEPA, 2007b). Aldrin and dieldrin are highly toxic to humans, affecting the 

central nervous system and the liver. USEPA has classified aldrin and dieldrin as probable 

human carcinogens in the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) database (USEPA, 

2004). Glyphosate can cause kidney damage and reproductive effects for long term 

exposures above the MCL (USEPA, 2007c). Glyphosate was not classified as carcinogenic 

to humans (USEPA, 2004).  

The sediment samples collected in Lake Vela revealed a spatial variation in terms of 

the contamination (Figure III.4). The insecticide dieldrin was detected in S2, S3 and S4 and 

the herbicides alachlor and glyphosate were only detected in S2. In S1 and S5 pesticides 

were not detected. Compared with water samples the concentrations of alachlor and 

glyphosate in S2 assume higher values (20.12 gL
-1

 and 20.40? gL
-1

, respectively). On the 

other hand, lower concentrations of dieldrin were recorded in sediments when compared 

with those registered in surface water samples. Considering sediments as a sink of 

contaminants, whose concentrations may reach much higher levels than those in the 

upper water-column, and taking into account the high sorption coefficient of dieldrin 

(Table III.1), higher concentrations of this pesticide in sediments relatively to water can be 

expected. Nevertheless, as the highest concentrations of dieldrin in water samples were 

detected during the seasonal rainfalls in autumn, this observation could be explained by a 

recent runoff of dieldrin from agricultural soils historically contaminated. The non-

detection of aldrin in sediment samples could be due to their transformation to dieldrin 

which, in turn, is more stable and highly persistent in the environment.  

The spatial variation observed in terms of the sediment contamination was 

consistent with the characteristics of sediments and to the greater proximity of 

agricultural lands to the sampling sites. In general, sediments collected in the margin near 

agricultural fields, comparatively to sediments collected in the opposite margin, present a 



Chapter III 

 

 

90 

higher percentage of small size particles (silt and clay) and organic matter (Abrantes et al., 

not published), which increases the adsorption of pesticides. In fact, the proximity of 

agricultural lands to the east and southeast margins of the lake is responsible for the 

input of small size particles of soil through surface runoff and to the enrichment of 

sediments with organic matter (Figure III.1). Moreover, the margins bordered by 

agricultural fields are directly exposed to contamination from runoff, which is reflected in 

terms of the sediment contamination. 

All the concentrations of aldrin detected in sediments were above the SQGV defined 

by CCME for the protection of aquatic life (CCME, 2001) (Figure III.4). Additionally, the HQ 

calculated for alachlor in S2 and for dieldrin in S2, S3 and S4 were above 1 (Figure III.6b)), 

which confirms the potential risk for the sediment-dwelling organisms. 

The chemical analysis performed on fish tissues showed that both species (the 

predator Micropterus salmoides and the bottom-feeding Cyprinus carpio), accumulated 

alachlor (Figure III.5). Nevertheless, the concentrations detected were below the 

concentrations found in water and sediment. According to EC (2003), substances with a 

log Kow?3, or that are highly adsorptive, and without mitigating properties (half–life 

superior than 12h), are potentially bioaccumulable in organisms. Hence, regarding the 

properties of the contaminants detected in water and sediment samples (Table III.1), it 

was also expected the bioaccumulation of aldrin and dieldrin in fish tissues. In fact, OCPs 

belong to a class of substances known to be of high lipophility and therefore have a great 

potential to accumulate in living organisms and to biomagnify in the food chain (Larson et 

al., 1997). The non bioaccumulation of aldrin and particularly dieldrin, whose 

concentration detected in water was considerably high, could also indicate a recent input 

from the agricultural soil historically contaminated with OCPs. Considering the different 

habitats and feeding strategies of the assessed fish species it was also expected to find 

differences in the contamination level. Predator species may biomagnify persistent 

contaminants through several trophic levels of the food web and bottom-feeding species 

may accumulate high contaminant concentrations through direct contact with 

contaminated sediment or by feeding on sediment-dwelling organisms (USEPA, 2000). 

The ingestion of contaminated fish from Lake Vela could represent a risk to ecological and 



Chapter III 

 

 

91 

human receptors. Considering that top predators, such as otters and birds, are regular 

fish eating predators and that the transfer of contaminants through the food chain results 

in an increase of the bioconcentration in organisms at higher trophic levels, the 

accumulation of alachlor in fish tissues may result in toxic concentrations to top 

predators, also called secondary poisoning (EC, 2003). Regarding the human receptors, it 

was not possible to ascertain if the consumption of fish from Lake Vela, represents a risk 

to human health because the amount of fish consumed per individual as well as the 

frequency of intake are unknown.  

EQGV were established with the purpose of protecting aquatic life and/or human 

health and are frequently used in the screening tier of ecological risk assessments (e.g., 

Suter, 1996; Chapman, 2000; Burton, 2002), being useful in the identification of 

contaminants and areas of potential concern. Nevertheless, EQGVs should not be taken 

as thresholds of significant effects (Suter, 1996). In general, they differ greatly between 

jurisdictions (Chapman, 2000) and may not reflect in situ conditions, disregarding the 

synergistic/additive effects of chemical mixtures and the bioaccumulative effects that 

may affect higher trophic levels (Burton, 2002). On the other hand, it is important to 

consider that HQ suffers from a large uncertainty which results in an overprotective 

assessment, as it is difficult to interpret their real meaning in terms of the ecosystem 

effects (Villa et al., 2003). In this way, risk estimation should be based on a weight-of-

evidence approach, i.e. they must be assessed in a holistic view in which multiple 

components of the aquatic system are assessed (e.g., physical and chemical measures, 

biological community structure, toxicity and bioaccumulation) through an integrated 

methodology (Burton, 2002). In order to attain this purpose other studies were carried 

out on Lake Vela in order to include data from biological surveys (Abrantes et al., 2006b) 

with ecotoxicological data derived for standard and local species (Abrantes et al., in 

prep.).

3.4. Conclusion 

Exposure characterization is a fundamental step in an ecological risk assessment. The 

present study confirmed the potential contamination of Lake Vela by pesticides from local 

agricultural activities. Results showed that aquatic organisms in Lake Vela as well as top 

predators and humans are exposed to currently and non-currently used pesticides, 

including OCPs banned decades ago. The measured concentrations in surface water and 

sediment and their comparison with benchmarks values indicated potential risks for 

water column living organisms as well as sediment-dwelling species. Likewise, the levels 

of pesticides in groundwater were also above the safety values for drinking water 

indicating a potential public health problem for local residents. The accumulation of 

alachlor in predator and benthic fish species could also represent a risk to humans and 

particularly to top predators, during their lifetime. Moreover it is also important to 

recognize that human health safety can not be achieved without the protection of natural 

resources. This study, as the first exposure characterization performed on the Lake Vela 

system, constitutes valuable and useful information for the ERA process. However, this 

preliminary assessment of risks should be continued and confirmed through a weight-of-

evidence approach.

Abstract 

Lake Vela (Portugal) has been potentially exposed to diffuse pollution generated by 

agricultural and livestock activities held in its drainage basin, which seriously compromise 

its health and recreational use. Hence, as part of an ecological risk assessment (ERA) this 

study aimed to use a whole sample toxicity assessment to evaluate the toxicity of water 

and sediments from Lake Vela on freshwater species. This way, standard (algae: 

Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata; cladoceran: Daphnia magna) and local species (algae: 

Aphanizomenon flos-aquae; cladoceran: Daphnia longispina) were exposed to water and 

sediment elutriates collected seasonally from two sites at Lake Vela: one in the east 

Margin (EM), near agricultural lands and, the other in the west margin (WM), surrounded 

by a pine tree forest. The results confirmed the seasonal contamination of both 

environmental compartments by pesticides, including organochlorine pesticides, and the 

presence of high concentrations of nutrients. Although both sites were contaminated, 

higher levels of pesticides and nutrients were detected in EM, particularly in the 

sediments. Bioassays showed that water samples (100% concentration) collected in 

summer and autumn significantly affected the growth rate of P. subcapitata, which could 

be attributed to the presence of pesticides. Likewise they revealed an apparent toxicity of 

elutriates for P. subcapitata and for both daphnids, in summer and autumn. In fact, 

although pesticides were not detected in elutriates, high levels of un-ionized ammonia 

were recorded, which is considered highly toxic to aquatic life. By comparing the several 

species, P. subcapitata was revealed to be the most sensitive one, followed by the 

daphnids, and then by A. flos-aquae. Results obtained in this study underlined the 

importance of whole samples toxicity assessment for characterizing the ecological effects 

of complex mixtures from diffuse inputs, in the ERA processes.

4.1. Introduction 

Diffuse pollution constitutes an increasing problem all over the world and poses a 

significant challenge to risk assessors, regulators and managers, as it is difficult to 

measure and regulate (Loague et al., 1998; Howarth et al., 2000). Agriculture, through the 

use of pesticides and fertilizers, is one of the main nonpoint sources of pollution (e.g., 

Carpenter et al., 1998; Ritter and Shirmohammadi, 2000; Arbuckle and Downing, 2001; 

Horwarth et al., 2002; Horwarth and Ramakrishma, 2005; Galbraith and Burns, 2007), 

contributing to environmental degradation, particularly in freshwater and estuarine 

ecosystems. Additionally, intensive livestock farming practices are also recognized as a 

nonpoint source of nutrients to water bodies (Hooda et al., 2000).  

Lake Vela, located on the west coast of Portugal, is potentially exposed to 

contamination generated by agricultural and livestock activities (Abrantes et al., 2006). 

The lands are abundantly fertilized, and pesticides (e.g., herbicides) are commonly used. 

Due to the higher permeability of the agricultural soils, and their proximity to the water 

body, those anthropogenic activities, through runoff or leaching, contribute to the 

imbalance of the aquatic ecosystem, namely with the higher input of nutrients, which 

accelerate the eutrophication process, and also the input of pesticides that could affect 

non-target species. The frequent occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in Lake Vela, the 

large fish kills in recent years and the reduction in biodiversity, triggered the development 

of an ecological risk assessment (ERA) (Abrantes et al., 2006). This ERA defined, as a task, 

the evaluation of the potential toxicity of diffuse pollution on different trophic levels. 

Hence, the approach used in this study was a whole sample toxicity assessment, linking 

toxicity bioassays and exposure information, as a tool for evaluating the impacts induced 

by diffuse pollution on algae and cladocerans species. Generally referred as WET (Whole 

Effluent Toxicity) tests in the USA or DTA (Direct Toxicity Assessment) in the UK, the 

whole sample toxicity assessments can help to identify, diagnose and control impacts on 

the ecosystem yielded by complex mixtures of contaminants (Wharfe, 2004; Wharfe et 

al., 2004; Whitehouse et al., 2004). Thereby, in this approach, all the present substances 

and their interactions are considered, which reduces the risks of under-protection and 

permits a more direct association between the source and the receptor (Whitehouse et 



Chapter IV 

103 

 

al., 2004). Although WET tests are not perfect tools, they are considered important 

predictive tools in the first stage of ERA hazard identification (Chapman, 2000). Moreover, 

they can help to meet the aims and fill the gaps of the current water quality legislation 

and could be introduced in scenarios where common approaches are either inadequate 

or impractical (e.g., for complex mixtures) (Whitehouse, 2004). 

According to OECD (1998a), ERA should consider additional/alternative standardized 

bioassays using test species that complement the species commonly used. In this way, in 

order to increase the ecological relevance of the bioassays providing useful and reliable 

information about potential effects to resident species and to comparatively analyse 

differences in sensitivity between species, local (algae: Aphanizomenon flos-aquae; 

cladoceran: Daphnia longispina) as well as standard species (algae: Pseudokirchneriella 

subcapitata; cladoceran: Daphnia magna) were used. Additionally, and considering the 

studied water body as a whole system, we evaluated the toxicity of two different 

compartments: water and sediment. For these purposes we have carried out adapted 

protocols of general bioassays [Whole Effluent Toxicity Test (WET) and Elutriate Sediment 

Toxicity Test (ESTT)]. Sediment elutriate tests were performed mainly to assess the 

potential contribution with contaminants given by sediments to the water column related 

with dredging activities that occur regularly in Lake Vela (Abrantes, personal observation), 

and the subsequent effects on planktonic species. To obtain a holistic picture of the 

diffuse pollution impacts and to perceive the influence of external factors, the spatial and 

temporal variations of contamination in Lake Vela were also evaluated. 

In summary, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of agricultural practices (diffuse 

pollution) on the aquatic environment of Lake Vela using a combination of adapted whole 

effluent and elutriate bioassays with chemical analysis.

4.2. Material and Methods 

 

4.2.1. Study Site, Sampling Strategy and Storage 

Lake Vela is a shallow eutrophic lake located in the littoral-centre of Portugal (40º5’N 

8º8’W, 45 m elevation) with a surface area of approximately 70 ha (Figure IV.1). It is part 

of a larger system commonly known as “Quiaios Lakes”, which is in parallel with the 

coastline, on a sand dune plain, about 6 Km from the Atlantic Ocean. It is bordered on the 

west side by a pine tree forest, and on the east by agricultural fields, livestock farming 

and human settlements. Due to its ecological diversity Lake Vela was included in the 

Ecological Net - Rede Natura 2000 – PTCON0055 (CM, 2000). The hydric regime of the 

lake is predominantly influenced by superficial and subterraneous fluxes (67% and 23%, 

respectively), the remainder being attributed to rainfall (Fernandes, 1999). Due to the 

slope of the piezometric surface towards the lake depression, the fluxes are effectively 

discharged into Lake Vela. On the east side of the drainage basin there are intensive 

agricultural and livestock farming activities. The main crop is corn for livestock feeding, 

whose cultivation starts with land tillage in late April and continues until September, 

when corn is harvested.  

The collection of samples (water and sediment) was performed in two sites: one in 

the east margin (EM), near agricultural lands and affected by direct runoff; and the other 

in the west margin (WM), where agricultural lands are absent (Figure IV.1). Furthermore, 

to assess temporal variations, the samples were collected seasonally, one sample per 

season. Subsurface water samples were collected directly to 5 L glass flasks for 

environmental parameters analyses and for bioassays, following the USEPA 

recommendations (USEPA, 2002). Sediment samples were collected according the USEPA 

guidelines (USEPA, 2001) using a stainless steal corer and transferred into storage 

containers specially prepared for pesticide analysis and bioassays. At the laboratory, the 

sediment samples were homogenised and sieved in a 2 mm mesh size sieve. Until further 

processing, water and sediment samples were stored in the dark at 4ºC (maximum 

storage time: 1 week).

4.2.2. Analytical Methods 

Simultaneously to field sampling, parameters such as water temperature, pH, 

conductivity and dissolved oxygen were determined in situ by using portable water 

testing meters (WTW 340-A pH meter, WTW LF 330 conductivity meter and WTW OXI 320 

oxygen meter). Secchi disk was also used to measure water transparency. In the 

laboratory, the total suspended solids (TSS) in water, and chlorophyll a (Chl a) were 

determined according to APHA (1995). A qualitative analysis of phytoplankton was 

performed in water samples fixed in formol (5% v/v) to depict the presence of 

cyanobacteria blooms (e.g., A. flos-aquae and M. aeruginosa). 

Sediment samples were characterized in terms of their particle size distribution, 

organic matter content (OM) and pH, following the methodologies described by 

Buchanan and Kain (1971). 

Based on the information of farmers on the major pesticides used in the agricultural 

lands near Lake Vela [e.g., Roundup® (formulated with glyphosate – 360 gL
-1

)
 
and Lasso® 

(formulated with alachlor – 480 gL
-1

)] and considering that persistent pesticides were 

used in the past, water, sediment and elutriate samples were screened for the presence

of alachlor, glyphosate and organochlorine pesticides. Concentrations of alachlor and 

organochlorine pesticides were determined by gas chromatography with an electron 

capture detector (GC/ECD) (USEPA, 1995, 1996) and concentrations of glyphosate by 

high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (USEPA, 1999a). 

At the onset of the bioassays, soluble reactive phosphorus (ascorbic acid method; 

PO4
3-

), un-ionized ammonia (Nessler method; NH3-N), nitrates (cadmium reduction 

method; NO3-N) and nitrites (calorimetric method; NO2-N) concentrations were measured 

in water and elutriate according to methodologies described by Lind (1979) and APHA 

(1995). 

 

4.2.3. Water and Elutriate Preparation 

Water samples were filtered through a 60 m mesh size plankton net for assays with 

cladocerans and through a glass fibre filter (Whatman GF/C) with 0.45 m of pore 

diameter for assays with algae, as recommended by USEPA guidelines (USEPA, 2002). 

Elutriates were prepared according to the procedures described in Ankley et al. (1991) 

and Nebeker et al. (1984). Sediments were mixed with MBL medium (elutriate a) for the 

assays with algae and mixed with ASTM hard water medium (elutriate b) for the assays 

with cladocerans, in a ratio of 1:4 (sediment/medium). The mixture was shaken at 200 

r.p.m for 2 h in an orbital shaker and, after a 12 h sedimentation period at a temperature 

of 4ºC, it was centrifuged at 5000 r.p.m for 15 minutes. The liquid fraction was removed 

by decantation and filtered in the same conditions, as aforementioned for the water 

samples. Water and elutriate samples were stored in the dark at 4ºC up to the testing 

time, but never exceeding one week. 

 

4.2.4. Culture of Test Species 

Unialgal inoculum cultures of P. subcapitata and A. flos-aquae (being the latter isolated 

from a sample collected in Lake Vela a few years ago) were maintained in 250 mL 

Erlenmeyer flasks with 100 mL of sterilized Woods Hole MBL medium, at 20±2 °C and with 

a 16h
L
:8h

D
 photoperiod. To start new cultures, algae were harvested in the exponential 

growth phase (5–7 days old) and inoculated in fresh medium. 



Chapter IV 

107 

 

Monoclonal cultures of D. magna (clone A, sensu Baird et al., 1989a) and D. 

longispina (isolated from a sample collected in Lake Vela a few years ago) were 

continuously reared under a 16h
L
:8h

D
 cycle and a temperature of 20±2 °C, in synthetic 

ASTM hardwater medium (ASTM, 1996) supplied with an organic additive extracted from 

the algae Ascophyllum nodosum (Baird et al., 1989b). Cultures were renewed every other 

day and the organisms were fed with P. subcapitata at a rate of 3.0x10
5
 cells/mL/day and 

1.5x10
5
 cells/mL/day for D. magna and D. longispina, respectively. 

 

4.2.5. Assays with Algae 

Bioassays were conducted according to USEPA (2002) and OECD (2002) guidelines. The 

algae were exposed during a 96 h period to several dilutions of water or elutriate (12.5, 

25.0, 50.0, 75.0 and 100.0%) in MBL medium. Assays were performed in 100 ml glass vials 

filled with 40 ml of test medium, using a total of three replicate per each treatment and 

control. Test vials were incubated under constant agitation (~100 r.p.m in an orbital 

shaker) and in the same conditions of algal cultures, with an initial cell density of 

approximately 10
4
 cells.mL

?1
 (inoculated from the exponential-growing batch culture). In 

order to exclude any potential effects from nutrient deficiency promoted by dilutions, 

additional controls were tested using MBL medium diluted with distilled water at 

concentrations of 12.5, 25, 50 and 75%. At the end of the bioassay, the cells density was 

determined as a biomass parameter. The growth rate (day
-1

) and percentage of growth 

inhibition (% I) were calculated from cells density measurements.  

 

4.2.6. Assays with Cladocerans 

Sub-lethal assays with cladocerans (D.magna and D. longispina) followed OECD (1998b) 

and USEPA (2002) guidelines. Water and elutriate samples were tested at several 

dilutions (12.5, 25.0, 50.0, 75.0 and 100.0%) performed with ASTM. Bioassays were 

initiated with neonates (&lt;24h-old), born between the 3
rd

 and 
5th

 broods, obtained from 

the bulk group cultures. For each treatment and control, 10 replicates were used. The 

organisms were exposed individually, in 100ml glass beakers, whose test medium was 

changed every two days. Organisms were fed daily with P. subcapitata at a rate of 3.0x10

Chapter IV

cells/ml/day and 1.5x10
5
 cells/ml/day for D. magna and D. longispina, respectively, 

supplied with an organic additive. Dissolved oxygen and pH were monitored throughout 

the test for validation purposes. Test vessels were checked daily and neonates, when 

present, were counted and removed. Survival, growth, fecundity (number of neonates), 

the age at the first reproduction and the number of broods, were the endpoints assessed 

in these assays The test finished after 60%, or more, of the control females have released 

their third brood (USEPA 2002). The body length of females was estimated at the 

beginning and at the end of the test, by extrapolation from moult exopodite length 

(Pereira et al., 2004), allowing calculation of the somatic growth rate of the females (SGR, 

day
-1

). Fecundity, survival and age at each brood release were integrated in the 

calculation of the rate of population increase (r, day
-1

) using the Euler-Lotka equation 

(Meyer et al., 1986). According to Forbes and Calow (1999) r is a better measure of 

responses to toxicants than are individual-level effects because it integrates potentially 

complex interactions of life-history traits, providing a more relevant measure of ecological 

impact. The Jack-knife technique was used to calculate standard errors for r (Meyer et al., 

1986).  

 

4.2.7. Statistical Analysis 

One-way-ANOVA, followed by a Dunnett test, was used to assess significant differences 

(p&lt;0.05) in the endpoints assessed between each lake water dilution and each elutriate 

dilution and the control (Zar, 1996). Probit regression analysis (Finney, 1971) was used to 

calculate the IC50 (96h) and IC10 (96h) for algae growth inhibition and the EC50 and EC10 for 

daphnids SGR and r. The different test parameters are reported as percentages of water 

or elutriate in the dillution medium.  

 

 

4.3. Results and Discussion  

The present study evaluated the sub-lethal toxicity of water and sediment elutriate 

samples from a lake exposed to diffuse pollution (Lake Vela, Portugal) on algae and 

cladocerans species. The toxicity evaluation was based in a whole sample toxicity 



Chapter IV 

109 

 

assessment and the toxicity bioassays were complemented with the physical and 

chemical characterization of the environmental samples tested. 

 

4.3.1. Characterization of Exposure 

The chemical analyses performed on the water and sediment samples confirmed the 

potential contamination of Lake Vela by diffuse pollution from agricultural and livestock 

activities, illustrated mainly by the high amounts of nutrients and by the presence of 

pesticides (Tables IV.I and IV.II).  

As expected, a seasonal variation in the concentrations of contaminants was 

observed in both compartments (water and sediment), which could be associated to the 

seasonal agricultural activity and to the climatic factors, such as rainfall events. Moreover, 

by comparing the two sampling sites (WM and EM) a spatial variation of nutrients and 

pesticide concentrations in elutriates and sediment samples, respectively, was also 

evident, with higher values in the margin surrounded by agricultural lands (EM).  

Nutrients in water samples showed their highest values, generally, in the winter 

sampling period, especially the nitrate and orthophosphate ions (Table IV.1). In fact, 

rainfall intensification in autumn and winter months (Figure IV.2), associated with the 

Lake Vela topography and sandy nature of the soil [with high permeability and low 

denitrification potential (Abrantes et al., submitted)] promoting the leaching and runoff 

of nutrients from the adjacent agricultural fields to the lake basin. According to local 

farmers, the lands are highly fertilized with commercial fertilizers and livestock manures 

(personal communication). In fact, the high nutrient contents, especially N and P 

compounds, associated with the high values of Chl a, the reduced water transparency and 

the presence of cyanobacterial blooms (e.g., A. flos-aquae and M. aeruginosa) (Table 

IV.1), confirmed the advanced trophic state of Lake Vela, classified as 

eutrophic/hypertrophic lake, according to Nürnberg (1996). Antunes et al. (2003) 

reported that Lake Vela is now more eutrophic than 10 years ago.

Table IV.1 also shows higher nutrient concentrations in elutriates, especially for un-

ionized ammonia (NH3-N). It is common to find greater ammonia concentrations in 

sediment than in surface water. Indeed ammonia can accumulate to high concentrations 

in the sediments under anaerobic conditions (Frazier et al., 1996). Nevertheless, the 

greater levels of nutrients detected in elutriate a, compared with elutriate b, is due to the 

high nutrient content of the MBL medium.

Table IV.2 shows that both water and sediment are seasonally contaminated with 

pesticides, namely with the herbicides alachlor and glyphosate and with the 

organochloride pesticides (OCPs) aldrin and dieldrin. All concentrations detected were 

greater than the allowable maximal limits (0.5 gL
-1

 per single substance) defined for 

surface waters by the Portuguese legislation (MA, 1998). Alachlor and glyphosate are the 

two most widely used herbicides in Portugal (Vieira, 2006) including in the agricultural 

lands near Lake Vela (Abrantes, 2006). Though the use of insecticides with aldrin and 

dieldrin as active ingredients was banned decades ago in most of the European 

Community countries including Portugal (MAPA, 1988), they can still be found in the 

environment, particularly the dieldrin. OCPs are characterized by their high persistence,

lipophility and affinity to particulate matter, and, thus, soil constitutes an important 

reservoir from which residues can be released to the atmosphere and groundwater 

through the time (Valle et al., 2005). The presence of pesticides either in Lake Vela 

surface water or sediment was only reported in summer and autumn, with the highest 

concentrations recorded in autumn. This seasonality is certainly associated to agricultural 

practices and meteorological events. The major application of pesticides takes place in 

May with the use of Lasso® and/or Roundup® as pre-emergent herbicides. Roundup® is 

also used later for pre-harvest control (Abrantes et al., 2006). During the summer, the 

irrigation of agricultural fields is the main factor promoting the runoff and leaching of 

pesticides, while in autumn the inputs of pesticides are certainly related to the high levels 

of precipitation recorded before the samples collection (Figure IV.2). The depicted 

pesticides were detected in both water samples (EM and WM), which reveals the 

dispersion of contaminants throughout the whole water body. Nonetheless, the pesticide 

concentrations in the water samples from the margin adjacent to agricultural lands (EM) 

are slightly more elevated than the concentrations recorded in the opposite one (WM). 

Regarding sediment samples there is a clear variation of pesticide concentrations 

between them, which are absent or below the limit of detection in WM samples (Table 

IV.2). This variation was consistent with the characteristics of sediments. In general, the 

sediment collected in EM compared with the sediment collected in WM, presented a 

greater percentage of small size particles and organic matter (Table IV.1), which promote 

the higher adsorption of pesticides.

Although several pesticides were detected (alachlor, dieldrin and glyphosate) in 

sediments from EM collected in summer and autumn, in elutriates prepared with these 

contaminated sediment no pesticides were detected. Considering that ESTT is an effective 

method of evaluating the potential toxicity of contaminants that are exchanged between 

the sediment and the aqueous phase during dredging processes (Ankley et al., 1992) and 

that all samples were kept in the dark, under refrigerated conditions, this study reveals 

the strong adsorption of pesticides to sediment particles, and the low risk for aquatic life 

associated to water contamination by pesticides due to a dredging process or sediment 

ressuspension 

 

4.3.2. Assays with Algae 

Figure IV.3 shows the effects of water and elutriate samples on the growth rate of the 

green algae P. subcapitata and the cyanobacteria A. flos-aquae. A considerable difference 

in sensitivity was observed between the two species. The growth of P. subcapitata was 

significantly inhibited (p &amp;lt;0.001) by samples collected in summer and autumn at higher 

concentrations. On the other hand, a stimulation in the growth rate of A. flos-aquae was 

observed under intermediate concentrations and no significant inhibitory effects (p&gt;0.05) 

were observed when exposed to higher concentrations. In fact, although little is known 

about the effects of pesticides on cyanobacteria, some studies have shown that they are 

less sensitive than green algae (e.g., Fairchild et al., 1998; Sabater and Carrasco, 2001; Ma 

et al., 2004, 2006).

The responses of P. subcapitata when submitted to different water samples 

throughout the year were consistent with the seasonal variation of pesticide 

concentrations, which underlines the potential effects of pesticides on algae growth. In 

fact, by comparing the concentrations of pesticides measured in water samples with the 

toxicological benchmarks for algae, it was observed that the concentrations of alachlor 

were close to the IC50 values reported for P. subcapitata in literature [e.g., Fairchild et al. 

(1998): IC50 (96h)=10 gL
-1

; Tomlin (2000): IC50 (72h)=12 gL
-1

; Monsanto Company 

(2002): IC50 (96h)=2.9 gL
-1

]. Moreover, the toxic effects were not due to depletion of 

nutrients because controls with different dilutions of MBL with distilled water performed 

similarly.  

Both water samples (WM and EM), collected in summer and autumn affected 

negatively the P. subcapitata growth, with a significant growth inhibition relative to 

control in the 100% concentration (p&lt;0.001) (Figure IV.3). Nevertheless, by comparing the

IC10 (96h) values, the water from EM collected in autumn [IC10 (96h)=71.6%] was more 

toxic than the water from WM [IC10 (96h)=86.1%] (Table IV.3). Although the contaminants 

were dispersed throughout the whole water body (Tables IV.1 and IV.2), the site EM was 

potentially more affected due to the proximity of the agricultural lands. Besides the 

contaminants, the biological interactions are also important factors that constrain the 

performance of organisms. Studies developed by de Figueiredo et al. (2006) in Lake Vela 

demonstrate the inhibitory effects of bloom-forming cyanobacteria (e.g., A. flos-aquae 

and M. aeruginosa) towards some algae and their implications in phytoplankton 

dynamics. It is known that many cyanobacteria are toxic to many organisms, namely 

microalgae (Kearns and Hunter, 2001; Singh et al., 2001; Suikkanen et al., 2004). Blooms 

of cyanobacteria, including the species present in Lake Vela, produce toxins and have 

semi-chemical properties (Downing et al., 2001). In this way, the inhibitory effects 

reported for P. subcapitata could also be related to the presence of toxins or allelopathic 

compounds produced by the algal blooms observed in summer (Table IV.1).

(Figure IV.3), particularly when exposed to the sample EM (IC10=55.3%), collected in 

autumn (Table IV.3). Regarding the nutrient concentrations (Table IV.1) it is noticeable 

the high concentrations of un-ionized ammonia (NH3-N) recorded in elutriates, namely in 

the summer and autumn samples, and although ammonia is a nitrogen source for algae, 

at high concentrations may be adverse for some algae species (Källqvist and Svenson, 

2003, Mucha et al., 2003). In fact, ammonia has been considered a confounding factor in 

sediment toxicology (Lapota et al., 2000; Postma et al., 2002; Losso et al., 2007), with un-

ionized ammonia being the most toxic form to aquatic environments (Camargo and 

Alonso, 2006).  

The presence of algal blooms in Lake Vela is frequently associated with an increase in 

water temperature during the warm season and with anthropogenic nutrient enrichment, 

particularly nitrogen and phosphorus (de Figueiredo et al., 2006). Nevertheless, the low 

sensitivity showed by A. flos-aquae to pesticides, relative to the green algae, can also 

contribute to their massive growth and dominance. 

 

4.3.3. Assays with Cladocerans 

The results of bioassays with D. magna and D. longispina are illustrated in Figures IV.4, 

IV.5 and Table IV.3. In general, despite the seasonal contamination of water by pesticides, 

particularly by the insecticides aldrin and dieldrin (Table IV.2), no significant toxic effects 

(p &gt; 0.05) on growth and reproduction of both daphnids were observed. Moreover, 

stimulation was observed in the population growth rate (r) for several bioassays, which 

could be related to the presence of dissolved nutritive particles and edible algae in water 

samples. Additionally, toxicity due to the presence of harmful cyanobacteria blooms (e.g., 

A. flos-aquae and M. aeruginosa) recorded in the summer was excluded, as the daphnids 

performed well when submitted to water collected in this period.

E – elutriate. Error bars indicate the standard error and asterisks indicate significant 

differences between the treatment and the control (p&lt;0.05).  

 

 

The apparent toxicity exhibited for both daphnids when exposed to elutriate EM at 

100% concentration in summer and autumn (Figures IV.4 and IV.5), was congruent with 

the results obtained for P. subcapitata. In fact, as above mentioned to algae, although any 

pesticides were detected in elutriates, the toxicity could be related to the high values of 

un-ionized ammonia (around 2 mgL
-1

) recorded in elutriate b, which are above the 

recommended concentrations of ammonia (0.05 to 0.35 mg.L
-1

 NH3-N for short-term 

exposures and 0.01 to 0.02 mgL
-1

 NH3-N for long-term exposures) defined by the USEPA 

water quality criteria for ammonia to protect the aquatic animals (USEPA, 1986, 1999b). 

Data on toxicity associated with the elutriate EM in summer and autumn showed that 

both parameters (SGR and r) were significantly affected (p&lt;0.001) in the 100% elutriate 

(Figures IV.4 and IV.5). In fact, toxic chemicals reduce the SGR of neonates and cause an 

early maturation and a subsequent reduction in fecundity (Hanazato, 1998, 1999), which, 

in turn, is reflected in population growth rate (r). 

The outcome of exposures to several water and elutriate samples did not allow a 

clear distinction between daphnid species regarding, in general, their tolerance or 

sensitiveness. Nonetheless, compared with algae bioassays, it was possible to establish 

the following decreasing order of sensitivity: P. subcapitata &gt; daphnids &gt; A. flos-aquae.  

Although the presence of contaminants in Lake Vela seemed not to affect the fitness 

of daphnids in the laboratory, it is important to consider the potential toxic effects on 

other related trophic levels, especially in primary producers. In this way, effects in edible 

algae, as reported for P. subcapitata, could indirectly affect their consumers, namely 

daphnids and, subsequently, all the food-web through a bottom-up mechanism.

4.4. Conclusion 

This study has showed that anthropogenic activities, such as agriculture and livestock, are 

affecting the quality of Lake Vela and represent a potential threat to the aquatic life. 

Results confirm the potential contamination of water and sediment by diffuse 

pollution, expressed by the presence of pesticides, including OCPs, and higher 

concentrations of nutrients. As expected, it was observed a seasonal variation of 

contaminants in both environmental compartments, which could be associated to the 

seasonal agricultural practices and to the meterological factors, such as periods of more 

abundant rainfall. Moreover, by comparing the two sampling sites (WM and EM) there is 

also an evident spatial variation of nutrient and pesticide concentrations in sediment 

samples, with the highest values recorded in the margin surrounded by agricultural lands 

(EM).  

The outcome of bioassays indicated that lake water samples (at 100%) collected in 

summer and autumn significantly affected the growth rate of the green algae P. 

subcapitata, which could be due to the presence of pesticides, namely the herbicide 

alachlor. Likewise, there was an apparent toxicity associated to the elutriate EM (at 100%) 

for P. subcapitata and for both daphnids, affecting their growth and reproduction. 

Although pesticides were not found in elutriates, high levels of un-ionized ammonia were 

recorded which are considered highly toxic to aquatic life. By comparing the several 

species responses, P. subcapitata revealed to be the most sensitive one, followed by the 

daphnids, and then by A. flos-aquae. Thus, this study reveals that the low sensitivity to 

pesticides showed by the local cyanobacteria A. flos-aquae comparatively to the green 

algae may represent an important advantage in field and could contribute to their 

massive growth and dominance in summer. Furthermore, emphasises should be placed 

on the use of local species besides the standard ones, as a way to provide more 

ecologically relevant information on potential toxic effects. At last, this study highlights 

the importance of whole samples toxicity assessment for a more relevant evaluation of 

the toxicity of complex mixtures from diffuse inputs in the ERA processes.

Abstract 

Lake Vela is a polymictic shallow lake exhibiting some characteristics typical of an 

advanced trophic state, namely, the permanently turbid water, the reduction in 

biodiversity, and the recurrent occurrence of Cyanobacteria blooms, which occasionally 

lead to large fish kills. This study was carried out in order to understand the seasonal 

variation of Lake Vela’s phytoplankton and cladoceran communities and their interactions 

under advanced eutrophic conditions. When comparing our results with general models 

of plankton succession observed in other temperate and tropical lakes we found some 

coherence between several seasonal events. Our results suggest that phytoplankton is 

mainly regulated by nutrients (“bottom-up” effect). However, the warm mediterranean 

temperatures had an important role in the phytoplankton succession, being responsible 

for the rapid and intense Cyanobacteria development in spring and summer. Our work 

also demonstrated that phytoplankton is one of the main factors responsible for the 

seasonal structure of the community of cladocerans, which are well related to changes in 

algae diversity and abundance, being the Cyanobacteria having major impact. Moreover, 

the occurrence of a massive Cyanobacteria bloom during the study, which induced anoxia 

and consequent fish kill, enhanced the structuring role that fish have on the cladoceran 

seasonal succession and the effects of this episode in the normal seasonal succession of 

plankton.

5.1. Introduction 

The relationship between zooplankton and phytoplankton is an important base of the 

food web in lakes. The abundance and diversity of phytoplankton and zooplankton vary in 

freshwater bodies according to their limnological features and trophic state (Jensen et al., 

1994; Jepessen et al., 2000; 2002; 2003). When nutrient loading is low, lakes present a 

clearwater phase with low algae biomass and a dense community of submerged 

macrophytes. On the other hand, the increase of nutrient loads in lakes may be 

responsible for an increase of the phytoplankton biomass. As the primary producers 

community undergoes changes, the structure of communities along the trophic web is 

subsequently affected. The phytoplankton increase leads to the high turbidity of water, 

which in turn, may contribute to the depletion of the submerged macrophytes 

community (Freedman, 1989; Caraco, 1993; Klinge et al., 1995). This fact enables changes 

in community structure, as it reduces plant surface area for algal fixation, the habitat and 

refuge for zooplankton, macroinvertebrates and fishes, as well as impairing the slow-

growing biomass of macrophytes, which is responsible for long term storage of nutrients 

by removing them from water column and sediment (McDougal and Goldsborough, 

1996). Moreover, some algae taxa that respond more swiftly than others to increase in 

nutrients, as Cyanobacteria, are favoured. It is known that Cyanobacteria are low quality 

food for zooplankton, due to their filamentous or colonial structure, low digestibility and 

toxin production, inducing limitations to the growth and reproduction of zooplanktonic 

organisms (e.g., Arnold, 1971; Haney, 1987; Lampert, 1987; Reinikainen et al., 1994; 

Repka, 1996; 1997; DeMott, 1999; DeMott et al., 2001; Rohrlack et al., 2001; Ghadouani 

et al., 2003). Ultimately, the increase of nutrient concentrations can promote the massive 

growth of phytoplankton, which eventually die and are decomposed by microorganisms 

that are responsible for the elevated rates of organic matter decomposition and the 

subsequent anoxia, leading to large kills of fish and other aquatic life (Brönmark and 

Weisner, 1992).  

Zooplankton represents the channel of transmission of the energy flux from the 

primary producers to the top consumers, because they include the primary herbivores 

and are important diet items for fish and other predators. In particular, cladocerans are 



Chapter V 

133 

an important constituent of most lake zooplankton communities, due to their capability 

to filter all particles within a given size range, including bacteria, protozoa, detritus and 

algae (Lampert, 1978; Infante and Litt, 1985; De Bernardi et al., 1987; Hessen 

and.Andersen, 1990; Brendelberger, 1991; Müller-Navarra and Lampert, 1996; 

Greenwood et al., 1999; Hülsmann, 2001). Hence, these organisms are faced with a great 

diversity of resources of different quality and since their capacity of selection is limited, 

the quality and quantity of food are determinants in the life history of cladocerans 

(Lampert, 1978; Müller-Navarra and Lampert, 1996; Greenwood et al., 1999; Hülsmann, 

2001). On the other hand, in addition to nutrient conditions, it is known that the 

zooplankton can affect the composition and abundances of phytoplankton species, both 

by direct grazing (Shapiro, 1995) and by altering the nutrient conditions through nutrient 

regeneration (Carney and Elser, 1990). 

Lake Vela is a shallow polymictic lake situated in the West coast of Portugal, which is 

located in the Mediterranean-iberoatlantic group of the Mediterranean region, where the 

climate is influenced by the proximity of the Atlantic Ocean. Due to Lake Vela’s 

strategical-geographic position it is considered as a protected zone with high 

conservational interest. Thereby, it was classified as a first level protection natural area 

and it benefits the protection statute defined by the Biótopos Project of Corine 

Programme 85/338/CEE, of 27 June (Farinha and Trindade, 1994). However, Lake Vela 

watershed shows intense agricultural and livestock activities on the East site. Due to the 

sandy nature of soils and the small depth of the groundwater (Fernandes, 1999), the 

drainage basin of Lake Vela is potentially exposed to loads of nutrients generated by 

these activities. Thus, this lake is classified as eutrophic since 1960 (Nauwerck, 1960), 

showing high N and P levels typical of eutrophic systems (Barros, 1994; Pereira, 1997, 

Fernandes, 1999; Abrantes, 2002; Antunes et al., 2003). The increase of phytoplankton 

biomass, with the presence of algal blooms, the depletion of submerged macrophytes, 

the increase in turbidity, and a subsequent reduction in biodiversity are some of the 

characteristics associated with the eutrophication process in Lake Vela that could 

compromise its wildlife and recreational use. 



Chapter V 

134 

Although general hypotheses and patterns of plankton succession were well 

described in temperate dimictic lakes (Sommer et al., 1986), there is still very few studies 

assessing plankton succession patterns in shallow lakes with Mediterranean climate, 

polymictic thermal regime and extreme eutrophic conditions associated to Cyanobacteria 

blooms. Thus, this study constitutes a complement for previous works, namely works on 

plankton seasonal succession, as PEG model. Furthermore, to contribute for the 

management of the Lake Vela system and the activities in its drainage basin it is 

important to understand the behaviour and linkages between the trophic levels under 

advanced trophic conditions. Thus, we aim to study the structure and the seasonal 

changes of the primary producers and herbivorous cladocerans and their 

interdependency in the eutrophic polymictic Lake Vela.  

 

 

5.2. Material and Methods 

 

5.2.1. Study Description 

Lake Vela, located in the littoral-centre of Portugal (40º5´N 8º8´W, 45 m elevation), is a 

temperate shallow lake (mean depth =0.9 m, maximum depth =2.4 m) with 70 ha of 

floodable surface area and a total volume of 70 10
4
 m

3
. It is surrounded in the East side 

by agricultural fields and some human settlements and, in the West side, by a forest road, 

which is separated from the lake by pine trees (Pinus pinaster) and acacias (Acacia spp.). 

Due to the regular nutrient inputs, the lake is highly eutrophic. It is characterised by a 

permanently turbid water, without a spring clear water phase, and algal blooms are 

frequently observed, namely in the warmer seasons. The phytoplankton is typically 

dominated by Cyanobacteria, Bacillariophyceae (e.g., Cyclotella spp.) and coccoid 

Chlorophyta (Barros, 1994). The macrophyte community is characterised by the 

dominance of Cladium mariscus, Myriophyllum verticillatum, Nymphaea alba and species 

from Poaceae family (Pereira, 1997). However, nearly 80-90% of the flooded lake bed 

does not contain any vegetation (Fernandes, 1999). The major crustacean species 

recorded are Daphnia longispina, Ceriodaphnia pulchella and Bosmina longirostris 

(Antunes et al., 2003). Fish are also abundant, with prevalent species such as: Lepomis 



Chapter V 

135 

gibbosus, Gambusia holbrooki and Micropterus salmoides, which are all introduced 

species. 

 

5.2.2. Physico-chemical Analysis 

Samples were collected bimonthly near surface (0.4 m in average) in the pelagic zone of 

the lake, over a one-year period. For chemical analysis (alkalinity, hardness and 

nutrients), chlorophyll a and suspended solids, water samples were collected with a 1.5 L 

plastic bottle and transported to the lab in the dark, at 4ºC. Until further processing, the 

samples for chemical analysis were preserved at –20ºC. Chlorophyll a was measured after 

collection on glass fibre filters (Whatman GF/C) and extraction in 90% acetone in the 

dark, following APHA. (1995). Likewise, for suspended solids analysis, samples were 

filtered through pre-weighed filters (Whatman GF/C) and the solids (volatile and fixed) 

were calculated according to APHA. (1995). Hardness and alkalinity were determined 

through buret titration methods. Ammonia was determined by Nessler method, nitrites 

by a colorimetric method, nitrates by cadmium reduction method and soluble reactive 

phosphorous (SRP) by the ascorbic acid method, following APHA (1995) procedures. 

Simultaneously to field sampling, temperature, pH (WTW 340-A pH meter), dissolved 

oxygen (WTW OXI 320 oxygen meter) and conductivity (WTW LF 330 conductivity meter) 

were recorded subsuperficially.  

 

5.2.3. Biological Parameters 

For phytoplankton a 1 L sample were preserved in lugol (1% v/v) for later identification 

and enumeration. The identification of phytoplankton species was made by observation 

through a light microscope using different references for Cyanobacteria (Geitler, 1932; 

Komárek and Anagnostidis, 1999), Bacillariophyceae (Krammer and Lange-Bertalot, 1986-

1991) and Chlorophyta (Chlorococcales) (Komárek and Fott, 1983). The enumeration was 

performed according to Lund et al. (1958) with at least 400 cells counted. For cladoceran 

analysis, three replicate samples were collected and concentrated by filtration through a 

55 µm mesh screen until significant clogging occurred. Each nylon screen was 

immediately placed in 4% sugar-formalin for zooplankton preservation (Haney and Hall, 



Chapter V 

136 

1973). In the laboratory, zooplankton samples were sorted out and cladoceran taxa were 

identified through a binocular stereoscope, using the keys of Scourfield and Harding 

(1966) and Amoros (1984a, 1984b), and enumerated.  

 

5.2.4. Statistical Analysis 

A canonical correspondence analysis or CCA (ter Braak, 1995) was used to ascertain the 

relationships between zooplankton, phytoplankton and environmental variables along 

the study period. CCA extracts synthetic gradients from the biotic and environmental 

matrices and the explanatory variables are quantitatively represented by arrows in 

graphical biplots. The arrow direction indicates positive or negative correlations and their 

length is relative to the importance of the explanatory variable in the ordination. A Monte 

Carlo permutation test was used to assess the significance of the relationships between 

the biotic data and the explanatory variables. Variation partitioning was performed 

according to the method developed by Borcard et al. (1992), which permits to single out 

the respective effects of the environmental factors. In our work, we considered two sets 

of explanatory variables: biotic (Bio) and abiotic (Abio), being included in Bio the 

phytoplankton and cladoceran communities and in Abio the physico-chemical factors. Bio 

and Abio variables were obtained by CCA after forward selection of variables. Total 

variations in phytoplankton and cladocerans were portioned as follows: Bio|Abio: fraction 

of total variation explained by biotic factors (Bio) alone, not shared with abiotic factors 

(Abio); BioxAbio: fraction of total variation explained by the interaction of Bio and Abio; 

Abio|Bio: fraction of total variation explained by abiotic factors (Abio) alone, not shared 

with biotic factors (Bio); x: fraction of total variation unexplained by the abiotic and biotic 

factors. 

 

 

5.3. Results 

5.3.1. Physical and Chemical Characteristics 

Water temperature was lower in autumn-winter seasons (10.3ºC recorded in November), 

and higher in spring-summer seasons (29.4ºC recorded in July) (Figure V.1). Oxygen levels 

were relatively stable during the study period, however complete oxygen depletion 



Chapter V 

137 

occurred in May 29, which corresponded to a large fish kill. In general, during the study, 

pH and conductivity did not show significant variations. Suspended solids presented their 

lower values in winter and began to increase in spring, reaching their higher values in 

summer and early autumn. They were mainly constituted by volatile organic materials. 

All analysed nutrients (nitrites, nitrates, SRP and ammonia) showed a similar trend, 

with highest concentrations in the period from December to April, which is explained by 

the adjacent soil leaching, promoted by rain. Nevertheless, ammonia showed an increase 

in May 29, corresponding to the fish kill. Alkalinity did not shown considerable changes 

during the sampling period, while hardness showed a substantial decrease after August 

(Figure V.1).

 in May). However, its diversity was essentially limited to Cyanobacteria, 

Bacillariophyceae and Chlorophyta, Cyanobacteria being the group with highest densities 

(Figure V.2). The dominant species of Cyanobacteria were the colonial algae Choococcus 

limneticus and Microcystis aeruginosa, and the filamentous Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. 

The Chlorophyta community was constituted mainly by coccoid forms of great size (e.g., 

Coelastrum reticulatum, Pediastrum simplex, Pediastrum duplex and Scenedesmus sp). All 

the Bacillariophyceae were filamentous, except Stephanodiscus and Cyclotella. There 

were considerable seasonal variations in phytoplankton (Figure V.2). In general, the 

dominance of Bacillariophyceae was found in the autumn-winter period (November to 

March). However, a peak (5.0 10
6 

cell. ml
-1

) of Bacillariophyceae was observed in June, 

mainly represented by the colonial diatom Achnanthes hungarica (Figure V.2). In early 

spring, the phytoplankton was dominated by Chlorophyta (March to April). The spring-

summer period (May to October) showed Cyanobacteria dominance, excepted for May 29 

(when the oxygen depletion and a large fish kills occurred), which was dominated by 

Chlorophyta, in particular by the green algae Scenedesmus acuminatus var. acuminatus. 

Cyanobacteria reached a peak in May (4.6 10
7
 cell. ml

-1
) due to the A. flos-aquae bloom. 

Chlorophyll a biomass was correlated positively with Cyanobacteria abundances (r=0.865, 

P&lt;0.005, n=25), with concomitant maxima recorded on May 16 (Figure V.3).

Figure V.4. Variation of total cladocerans densities and percentages of the main species 

during the studied period.  

 

Abundances and composition of cladocerans varied significantly through the seasons 

(Figure V.4). D. longispina presented their maximum abundance in August and September 

(318 ind. L
-1

), being the dominant species in the winter (from January to March) and in 

early autumn (from September to November). C. pulchella presented very low densities 

along the year. Nevertheless, they attained a peak in May 16 (28 ind. L
-1

), coincident with 

the maximum density of total phytoplankton. High positive correlations were observed 

between C. pulchella and Cyanobacteria densities (r=0.864, P&lt;0.005, n=25). During the 

first study months, where D. longispina and C. pulchella presented very low densities, 

Chydoridae and B. longirostris reached very high densities (  1000-1500 ind. L
-1

) (Figure 

V.4). B. longirostris became the dominant species in the summer, attaining their highest 

density in August (1551 ind. L
-1

). Chydoridae also reached high densities in the summer, 

but less pronounced than B. longirostris. Practically, no cladocerans were observed in the 

May 29 (due to the anoxia and large fish kills), including C. pulchella, which attained a 

peak two weeks earlier, in May 16.

5.3.3. CCA and Variation Partitioning Analysis 

The results of the CCA applied to the environmental factors (physical and chemical 

variables and cladoceran community) indicate that only the abiotic factors significantly 

influence the phytoplankton community (P  0.005; Monte Carlo test of first constrained 

axis), explaining 31% of the total variance (Table V.1 and Figures V.5, V.6). The most 

discriminant physico–chemical variables were temperature, volatile solids, hardness, SRP 

and pH (Figure V.5), nevertheless, clear trends are difficult to extract. Provided by the 

variation partitioning analysis, the pure contribution of the physical and chemical 

variables (Abio|Bio) was large (30%) and significant (P 0.005) while the pure contribution 

of cladocerans (Bio|Abio) was lower (13%) and not significant (P=0.095). The total 

variation, explained by the abiotic and biotic factors and their interaction, was relatively 

high with a total of 44% (Figure V.7a). 

The CCA and partial CCA analysis applied to the environmental factors allowed to 

ascertain that the pure contribution of the physico-chemical parameters (Abio|Bio =1%) 

and the phytoplankton (Bio|Abio =4%) did not explain the cladocerans abundance and 

diversity (Figure V.7b). However, the variation shared by (BioxAbio) was 24%, suggesting 

an interaction between physico-chemical factors and phytoplankton. Thus, we intend to 

perform a CCA of cladocerans with respect to phytoplankton and physico-chemical 

variables, which was explaining 29% of the total variance and showed a statistical 

significance (P 0.005) (Table V.2). Clear trends are difficult to extract, mainly because of 

the proximity of the species scores (Figure V.8). However, ammonia was the most 

discriminant variable, which is probably related to the Chl a peak and subsequent oxygen 

depletion on the occasion of the fish kill (May 29).

5.4. Discussion 

Lake Vela is a eutrophic shallow lake with high nutrient levels (mainly nitrates and 

phosphates) and its cladoceran community presents low diversity and high abundances. 

Cyanobacteria blooms are frequent, especially A. flos-aquae and M. aeruginosa, and fish 

kills have occurred in the last years. Submerged macrophytes are unusually abundant, 

planktivorous fish now dominate, and Chl a presents high values during the warmer 



Chapter V 

146 

months. This description is in agreement with the findings of Jeppesen et al. (1999) on 

eutrophic turbid lakes.  

In eutrophic lakes the role of nutrients versus zooplankton grazing in controlling 

phytoplankton continues to be a controversial question among limnologists. Sommer et 

al. (1986) present a general model (the PEG model) for the seasonal planktonic patterns. 

According to these authors, with nutrient availability and increased light, phytoplankton 

productivity increases in spring and supports growth of cladoceran herbivore populations; 

the herbivore populations increase exponentially and eventually exceed food availability 

and decline; in some systems, planktivores fish allied to the food limited accelerates the 

decline of crustacean herbivores and a replacement of larger species by smaller species in 

the summer; autumn destratification, resulting in nutrient replenishment and a 

deterioration of the effective underwater light climate, permits the development of 

edible phytoplankton species and a second peak in zooplankton biomass (applied to 

stratifying lakes only); a reduction of light energy results in decline of algal biomass to the 

winter minimum, which associated to low winter temperatures restrict herbivores 

production and some species produce resting stages. 

The CCA performed on the data revealed that the phytoplankton abundances and 

diversity is mainly regulated by abiotic factors, including temperature and nutrients 

availability. In respect to the cladocerans, CCA suggests that their distribution was, in 

part, influenced by an interaction between physico-chemical factors and phytoplankton. 

Therefore, we believe that physico-chemical factors do not influence directly the 

cladocerans community, but control the phytoplankton growth, which in turn influence 

the dynamics of cladocerans. The drainage basin of Lake Vela shows at the East side small 

rural properties characterised by an intense agricultural activity, as well as intensive 

livestock breeding. Thus, the runoff into the Lake Vela has a high nutrient content, which 

explains the high values recorded for nutrients from winter to early spring. As a 

consequence, we observed an increase of phytoplankton in early spring. According to PEG 

model, a spring production of small fast-growing algae such as Cryptophyceae and small 

centric Bacillariophyceae develops. In our work, which is corroborated by previous studies 

in Lake Vela (Barros, 1994; Fernandes, 1999), was observed that the spring growth of 



Chapter V 

147 

algae is firstly dominated by Chlorophyta, being replaced by Cyanobacteria. The warm 

temperatures in spring, typical of Mediterranean areas, that enables a faster growth of 

Cyanobacteria, possibly allied with cladoceran grazing pressure in small edible 

phytoplankton, promote their dominance and the appearance of blooms in Lake Vela.  

As already stated, the presence of Cyanobacteria leads to a decrease  

in Daphnia densities, because Cyanobacteria interfere with filtration, have low 

digestibility and release toxins (e.g., Arnold, 1971; Haney, 1987; Lampert, 1987; 

Reinikainen et al., 1994; Repka, 1996; 1997; DeMott, 1999; DeMott et al., 2001; Rohrlack 

et al., 2001; Ghadouani et al., 2003). This evidence can explain the non observed spring 

peak of zooplankton in Lake Vela (also non reported in previous limnological works in 

Lake Vela), which is largely documented in other works (e.g., Sommer et al., 1986; 

Saunders et al., 1999) as responsible for the reduction of phytoplankton and the 

consequent clear water phase.  

In general, smaller cladocerans are less affected by Cyanobacteria (Berzins and Pejler, 

1989; Radwan and Popiolek, 1989; Pinel-Alloul, 1993). Frequently there is the 

replacement of large species by small ones, when the Cyanobacteria are dominant 

(Lampert, 1982). When comparing the different populations of cladocerans during the 

study period, it was evident that Daphnia was the most affected species by the spring 

Cyanobacteria blooms, leading to a drastic reduction of its abundance. On the other 

hand, simultaneously to the peak of Cyanobacteria (due to the A. flos-aquae bloom), the 

small cladoceran C. pulchella reached their highest density ever recorded during the 

study, showing a positive significantly correlation with Cyanobacteria densities. This fact 

could be also related to the efficient capture and consumption of bacteria by C. pulchella 

in the presence of inedible algae (DeMott, 1989). PEG model also reports the 

replacement of larger cladoceran species by smaller ones, but this occurrence is seen 

most distinctly during the summer (Sommer et al., 1986). 

The large amount of unexplicated variation (71%) obtained in our study, suggests 

that cladoceran community structure may not be regulated only by “bottom up” forces 

such as food availability or nutrients. Predation is often an important factor conditioning 

zooplankton structure (e.g., Christoffersen et al., 1993). In summer, zooplankters are 



Chapter V 

148 

subjected to very high predatory pressure, especially because of YOY fish, and this 

pressure is size-selective, with major impact in larger-size cladocerans - Daphnia.  

The massive growth of Cyanobacteria that occurred in May was responsible for the 

large kill of fish and other aquatic life, as a consequence of complete oxygen depletion. 

Although the extent of the fish kill was not studied, it seems to have been drastic enough 

to diminish the predatory pressure on cladocerans. Under the same conditions, Daphnia 

is a better competitor than Ceriodaphnia and it has been experimentally shown that 

Daphnia can suppress small species, especially in eutrophic systems, where the 

competitive effects are more pronounced (Vanni, 1986). Thus, the major fish kills 

observed in May 29 can explain the summer Daphnia peak. However, the decrease of 

Cyanobacteria after this occurrence, can also explain the increase of D. longispina, and 

consequently the reduction of C. pulchella densities. Previous studies on Lake Vela, in 

which the fish kills were not recorded, have shown a dominance of D. longispina and B. 

longirostris in the beginning of the summer, but they were replaced by C. pulchella during 

the rest of the season (Vasconcelos, 1990 (only studied the zooplankton community 

during the summer); Barros, 1994). 

Nutrient limitation is a common characteristic during summer stratification (Sommer 

et al., 1986). Lake Vela, although it is a non-stratified lake, also presents a limitation of 

nutrients in summer, namely a phosphorous limitation (Barros, 1994; Fernandes, 1999). 

This absence is associated to the high growth of phytoplankton that leads to the nutrient 

depletion. As referred by Sommer et al. (1986) the competition for phosphate leads to a 

replacement of green algae by large Bacillariophyceae and later the nitrogen depletion 

favours a shift to nitrogen-fixing of filamentous Cyanobacteria. Lake Vela presents 

Cyanobacteria dominance in summer (Barros, 1994, Fernandes, 1999), being the A. flos-

aquae (a nitrogen-fixing algae) and M. aeruginosa the most representative species in our 

study.  

A new zooplankton peak typically occurs in autumn, as a consequence of the nutrient 

replenishment and the subsequent development of edible phytoplankton species (e.g. 

Sommer et al. 1986; Saunders et al., 1999). Lake Vela presents a gradual transition 

between summer and winter, without the autumn destratification event and the 



Chapter V 

149 

consequent release of nutrients. However, in our study we observed a Daphnia peak in 

the beginning of autumn, which could be related to the continue decrease of 

Cyanobacteria and a decrease in predation still associated to the May 29 fish kill. Barros 

(1994) presents in her work an autumnal peak of cladocerans, although with C. pulchella 

dominance, which is possibly related to the fish predation pressure on major cladocerans 

that persists in early autumn.  

In winter, the reduction of light energy results in phytoplankton biomass decrease to 

the minimum, which is associated to cool winter temperatures and restricts zooplankton 

production rates and, for some species, stimulates diapause (Sommer et al., 1986). Our 

study, as well as the work developed by Barros (1994) in Lake Vela, showed low 

abundances of cladocerans during the winter. The decline of edible algae biomass in 

winter, that only starts to increase after the typical winter precipitation and the 

consequent runoff and nutrient replenishment, can explain this event. In addition, the 

role of temperature, which influences the metabolic rates of cladocerans (e.g., Burns, 

1969; Goss and Bunting, 1983; Moore et al., 1996; Giebelhausen and Lampert, 2001), is 

also an important factor that can explain their lower winter densities. It is possible to 

observe the presence of resting eggs produced by D. longispina in Lake Vela. However, 

this occurrence was not only associated with the low temperatures, being observed the 

presence of resting eggs along the year as a consequence of several stressing factors.  

 

 

5.5. Conclusion  

From the present study we conclude that the seasonal pattern of the phytoplankton and 

cladoceran communities is more or less coherent with the general model of plankton 

seasonal succession described for other temperate lakes. 

Phytoplankton in Lake Vela is mainly regulated by physico-chemical factors, namely 

nutrients. However, the high Mediterranean temperatures had an important role in the 

plankton succession, being responsible for the exponential Cyanobacteria development in 

spring and summer. Moreover, the present work demonstrated that phytoplankton is one 

of the main factors responsible for the succession of cladoceran community, which are 



Chapter V 

150 

well related to changes in algae composition and density, the Cyanobacteria being the 

group with major impact. Nevertheless, the consequences of fish kills, such as the one 

recorded here, enhanced the structuring role that fish have on the cladoceran seasonal 

dynamics, and that any irregular event in the system has effects on the normal seasonal 

succession of plankton. It is important to consider that this occurrence has been regularly 

observed in Lake Vela and its effects on the zooplanktonic community are not yet fully 

understood.  

It should be considered that the changes shown by organisms, in general, do not 

occur as a response to a single factor, but to a complexity of interactions generated by a 

large range of factors. Thus, further information on competitive interactions within 

plankton, toxic cyanobacteria, anti-predator defences, or YOY fish, should be included in 

such models in order to understand the intricate trophic relationships of aquatic systems.

Abstract 

Terrestrial Model Ecosystems (TMEs) are frequently used to assess the potentially 

harmful effects of contaminants on terrestrial organisms. Nonetheless we used this 

apparatus to simulate the leaching phenomena in agricultural soils, from the drainage 

basin of Lake Vela (Figueira da Foz, Central Portugal), and to perform a subsequent 

evaluation of the toxicity of the leachates obtained, after a treatment of the soil cores 

with the herbicide Lasso® on non-target freshwater species. In this way, standard (algae: 

Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata; cladoceran: Daphnia magna) and local (algae: 

Aphanizomenon flos-aquae; cladoceran: Daphnia longispina) species were exposed to 

several dilutions of leachates derived from different treatments applied to soil-cores 

collected in an agricultural field from Lake Vela surrounds: RW- soil-core irrigated only 

with artificial rain water; RW+L- soil-core irrigated with artificial rain water after the 

application of Lasso®; GW+L –soil-core irrigated with groundwater collected in local wells 

after the application of Lasso®. Chemical analysis confirmed the presence of alachlor 

(active ingredient of Lasso®) in the leachates RW+L and GW+L at concentrations of 88.0 

gL
-1

 and 16.9 gL
-1

, respectively. As expected, the results demonstrated that the 

leachate RW did not present toxicity for the several tested species. On the contrary, 

leachates where the herbicide was applied, particularly the RW+L, showed a higher 

toxicity to P. subcapitata (96h-IC50 =9.7%), which contrasts with the absence of toxic 

effects in A. flos-aquae. Notwithstanding the effects on the green algae, the reproduction 

and growth of both daphnids were not affected by the potential toxicity of leachates. 

Nevertheless, our results were consistent with the chemical analysis and alachlor 

ecotoxicity data reported in literature. Our study confirms that the current use of 

pesticides in the lands near Lake Vela, especially Lasso®, allied to soils specific 

characteristics, can easily contaminate the aquatic ecosystem through leaching and could 

compromise their weak balance by affecting one of the main trophic levels: the primary 

producers.

6.1. Introduction 

According to tiered-approach frameworks for the ecological risk assessment (ERA) of 

contaminated sites, if concerns about the potential risk of chemicals in the environment 

subsist in the first tiers the assessment should proceed to in situ or laboratory conditions 

with great environmental realism in order to reduce uncertainties (Boxall et al., 2002). 

Terrestrial model ecosystems (TMEs) may be a useful tool for site-specific evaluations 

within the risk assessment context (Weyers et al., 2004). More specifically, TMEs can be 

used as a diagnostic instrument for contaminated sites or a prognostic instrument for the 

ERA of individual chemicals, mixtures of chemicals and bio-products (Knacker et al., 

2004). Integrated in the European Union (EU) project “The use of TME to assess 

environmental risks in ecosystems” a TME ring-test and field-validation study was 

recently performed (e.g., Forster et al., 2004; Jones et al., 2004; Knacher et al., 2004; 

Koolhaas et al., 2004; Moser et al., 2004a, 2004b; Rombke et al., 2004; Sousa et al., 2004; 

Van Gestel et al., 2004). Although TMEs have been used, almost exclusively, to evaluate 

the fate and effects of chemical substances in the soil compartment (e.g., Knacher et al., 

2004; Weyers et al., 2004; Boleas et al., 2005; Van den Brink et al., 2005), they can also be 

used to evaluate the potential toxicity of contaminants on non-target species from the 

aquatic compartment, the common final receptor system of the great majority of soil 

contaminants, since they allow the collection of soil leachates yielded by soil irrigation 

(Knachers et al., 2004). 

Lake Vela, a freshwater shallow lake, located in the Centre of Portugal (Figueira da 

Foz), is exposed to diffuse pollution generated by agricultural and livestock activities. 48% 

of the drainage basin of this lake is occupied by agricultural fields that contribute for a 

high input of nutrients and pesticides in the system (Fernandes, 1999). In fact, initial 

results from the ecological risk assessment that is being conducted in Lake Vela (Abrantes 

et al., 2006a) confirms the contamination of water and sediment with current and non-

current used pesticides and indicates that alachlor, aldrin and dieldrin are substances of 

concern for aquatic species.  

In this context, the main purpose of this study, integrated in the ecological risk 

assessment planed for Lake Vela, (Abrantes et al., 2006), was to assess the potential 



Chapter VI 

163 

leaching of Lasso® in agricultural lands around the lake and their ecotoxicological impact 

on non-target freshwater species. To attain this purpose agricultural soil cores were 

collected and used to simulate the soil leaching in laboratory conditions and following 

agricultural practices for pesticides application and crop irrigation. Thereafter the lethal 

and sublethal toxicity of leachates was assessed through standard toxicity assays with the 

green algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, the cyanobacteria Aphanizomenon phlos-

aquae and the daphnids Daphnia magna and Daphnia longispina.

6.2. Material and Methods 

 

6.2.1. Pesticide Properties 

Alachlor (active ingredient of the herbicide Lasso®) is a chloroacetamide pre-emergent 

herbicide widely used to control weed grasses, being the second most traded pesticide in 

Portugal (Vieira, 2006). Its potential for contamination of surface and groundwater is high 

owing to its physicochemical properties, particularly solubility in water (170.31 mgL
-1

 at 

pH=7 and 20ºC) (Tomlin, 2000) and mobility in soil (log Koc ranging from 2.08 to 2.28)

(USEPA, 2002a), which enables it to leach from soil to aquatic systems (El-Nahhal et al., 

1998), its half-life in aquifers (ranging from 808 to1518 days) (USEPA, 2002a) and its 

hydrolysis half-life in surface water (28 days) (Tomlin, 2000). Alachlor makes part of the 

list of priority substances defined by the European Commision (EC, 2001), whose 

substantial risk for the aquatic system demands a progressive reduction or banishment. 

 

6.2.2. Experimental Set-up 

Soil-cores were taken from agricultural lands located in the east margin of Lake Vela 

(Figueira da Foz, Central Portugal) in spring, before the seasonal application of pesticides 

used for pre-emergent control of corn crops (Figure VI.1). To minimise the differences in 

soil properties soil-cores were collected close to each other. The procedures of extraction, 

transport and handling of soil-cores followed the methodologies described by Knacker et 

al. (2004). In the laboratory, soil-cores were placed in moveable carts in a climatic 

chamber, under constant laboratory conditions (air temperature: 20±2ºC; relative 

humidity: 50-80%; light intensity: 8000 lux; photoperiod 16h
L
:8h

D
). Each soil core was 

connected to a glass bottle allowing the collection of leachates obtained by soil irrigation. 

The soil cores were left undisturbed during one month to permit soil structure 

stabilization. After this period Lasso® was applied and for this purpose three different 

treatments were defined, with 6 replicates per treatment: RW- soil-cores only irrigated 

with artificial rain water [formulated according to Davies et al. (2004)]; RW+L - soil-cores 

treated with Lasso® and irrigated with artificial rain water;, and GW+L - soil-cores treated 

with Lasso® and irrigated with groundwater collected from local wells, usually used as 

irrigation water in agricultural lands near Lake Vela. Both pesticide application and 

irrigation was based on local agricultural practices. Lasso® was diluted in water in a ratio 

of 1:100 (v/v), in a final concentration of alachlor of 4.8 gL
-1

. The solution was applied to 

the soil-cores using a sprayer at an application rate of 0.185 Lm
-2

. After the pesticide 

application, and to promote leaching, soils were uniformly irrigated. The irrigation took 

place every 5 days in a daily rate of 32.27 Lm
-2

, corresponding to 31.4 Lm
-2

 of irrigation 

water used by local farmers and to 1.34 Lm
-2

 relative to the average precipitation 

recorded in May (soil sampling period) in the Lake Vela area (INAG, 2007). Due to the high 



Chapter VI 

165 

permeability of soils, the leachates were quickly obtained after the irrigation and the 

several replicates of each treatment were mixed, to get a composite sample, and 

immediately stored in the dark at 4ºC, until the bioassays were performed, in a period 

never exceeding one week. At the onset of the bioassays, the pH of leachates was 

adjusted to values ranging between 7.3 and 7.7.  

 

6.2.3. Physico-chemical Analysis 

The soil was characterized for basic pedological descriptors including particle size 

distribution, organic matter content, pH and water-holding capacity. An analysis to detect 

background concentrations of alachlor in soil and groundwater was performed by gas 

chromatography with an electron capture detector (GC-ECD) (USEPA, 1995).  

Alachlor concentrations were also assessed in the composed samples of soil 

leachates obtained from each TME treatment. Soluble reactive phosphorus (ascorbic acid 

method; PO4
3-

), un-ionized ammonia (Nessler method; NH3-N), nitrate (cadmium 

reduction method; NO3-N) and nitrite (calorimetric method; NO2-N) concentrations were 

also measured in soil leachates, in artificial rainwater and in groundwater, according to 

methodologies described by Lind (1979) and APHA (1995). 

 

6.2.4. Culture of Organisms 

Unialgal inoculum cultures of A. flos-aquae (isolated from a sample collected in Lake Vela 

a few years ago) and the standard species P. subcapitata (formely named Selenastrum 

capricornutum) were maintained in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks, with 100 ml of sterilized 

MBL, shaking at 100 r.p.m in an orbital shaker and under controlled temperature 

(20±2ºC) and photoperiod (16h
L
:8h

D
). To start new cultures, algae were harvested during 

its exponential growth phase (5–7 days old) and inoculated in a fresh medium. 

Monoclonal cultures of D. magna (clone A, sensu Baird et al., 1989a) and D. 

longispina (isolated from a sample collected in Lake Vela a few years ago) were 

continuously reared in the laboratoty, under a photoperiod of 16h
L
:8h

D
 and a 

temperature of 20±2 °C, in the synthetic ASTM hardwater medium (ASTM, 1996) supplied 

with an organic additive to provide essential microelements to daphnids (Baird et al., 



Chapter VI 

166 

1989b). Cultures were renewed every two days and the organisms were fed with P.

 cells.ml

-1./
day for D. magna and 

D. longispina, respectively. 

 

6.2.5. Assays with Algae 

Algae growth inhibition assays were conducted according to USEPA (2002b) and OECD 

(2002) guidelines. The two test species (P. subcapitata and A. flos-aquae) were exposed 

for 96h period to a range of dilutions of the soil leachates (12.5, 25.0, 50.0, 75.0 and 

100.0%) obtained with the MBL medium. Assays were performed in 100 ml glass vials 

filled with 40 ml of each leachate dilution or MBL control, in a total of three replicates per 

dilution and control. Test vials were incubated in the same conditions described above for 

algae cultures maintenance, with an initial cell density of approximately 10
4
 cells.ml

-1
 

(inoculated from the exponential-growing batch culture). To exclude any potential effects 

from nutrient deficiency promoted by dilutions, additional controls were tested using 

distilled water as the dilution medium. At the end of each assay, the cells density was 

determined as a biomass parameter. The growth rate (GR.day
-1

) and percentage of 

growth inhibition (% I) were calculated from cells density measurements.  

 

6.2.6. Assays with Cladocerans 

Sub-lethal assays with cladocerans (D.magna and D. longispina) followed OECD (1998) 

and USEPA (2002b) guidelines. A range of dilutions of soil leachates (12.5, 25.0, 50.0, 75.0 

and 100.0%) was obtained using ASTM culture medium. Only neonates born between the 

third and the fifth broods ( 24-hr old) were used in tests (Barata and Baird, 1998). For 

each leachate dilution and ASTM negative control, 10 replicates were used. The 

organisms were exposed individually, in 100 ml glass beakers; test medium was changed 

every two days. Organisms were fed daily with P. subcapitata at a rate of 3.0x10
5
 

cells/ml/day and 1.5x10
5
 cells/ml/day for D. magna and D. longispina, respectively, 

supplied with an organic additive (see feed rates in the Culture of organisms section). 

Dissolved oxygen and pH were monitored throughout the test for validation purposes. 

Test vessels were checked daily and neonates, when present, were counted and

removed. Survival, growth, fecundity (number of neonates), the age at the first 

reproduction and the number of broods were the endpoints assessed in these assays The 

test finished after 60% or more of the control females have released their third brood 

(USEPA 2002b). The body length of females was estimated at the beginning and at the 

end of the test, by extrapolation from moult exopodite length (Pereira et al., 2004), 

permitting calculation of the somatic growth rate of the females (SGR.day
-1

). Fecundity, 

survival and age at each brood release were integrated in the calculation of the rate of 

population increase (r, day
-1

) using the Euler-Lotka equation (Meyer et al., 1986). 

According to Forbes and Calow (1999) r is a better measure of responses to toxicants than 

are individual-level effects because it integrates potentially complex interactions of life-

history traits, providing a more relevant measure of ecological impact. The Jack-knife 

technique was used to calculate standard errors for r (Meyer et al., 1986).  

 

6.2.7. Statistical Analysis 

One-way-ANOVA, followed by a Dunnett test, was used to assess significant differences 

(p&lt;0.05) in the endpoints assessed among each soil leachate dilution and the control (Zar, 

1996). Probit regression analysis (Finney, 1971) was used to calculate the IC50 (96h) and 

IC10 (96h) for algae growth inhibition and the EC50 and EC10 for daphnids SGR and r. The 

different test parameters are reported as percentages of soil leachates dilutions.  

 

 

6.3. Results and Discussion 

 

6.3.1. Physico-chemical Analysis 

The composite soil sample collected in the east margin of the Lake Vela was acidic 

(pH=5.85) and characterized by a low organic matter content (2.11% ± 0.7). Regarding 

grain size distribution the soil was classified, according to the British scheme, as a sandy 

loam soil (fractions:&amp;lt;60 m=42%; 60-120 m=58%). Both properties contributed for the 

low water-holding capacity (WHC: 3.10% ± 1.2) of this soil and subsequently to their high 

permeability. Hence, the main general physical and chemical characteristics of this soil 



Chapter VI 

168 

seemed to favour the mobility of pesticides potentially applied in the margins of Lake 

Vela, which are contributing for the risks of contamination of this freshwater aquatic 

system. In fact, according to Barbash and Resek (1997) the texture and structure of the 

soil, as well as the organic matter content, are the main factors determining the 

adsorption of pesticides to soil particles preventing their transport. Additionally, the 

chemical properties of the pesticide alachlor, particularly its relatively high mobility in soil 

(log Koc ranging from 2.08 to 2.28) (USEPA, 2002a), increases the potential for leaching 

and consequently to contaminate the aquatic systems (Kolpin, 1997). The chemical 

analysis of the leachates revealed the presence of alachlor in both treatments to which 

the pesticide was applied (RW+L: 88.0 gL
-1

 and GW+L: 16.9 gL
-1

) (Table VI.1). Moreover, 

alachlor was not recorded on soil and on groundwater used for irrigation in the GW+L, 

eliminating other potential sources of contamination of the leachates. Table VI.1 shows 

the physical and chemical properties of the leachates. The RW+L was more acidic, while 

the GW+L leachate showed the highest concentration of nutrients (particularly nitrates). 

These differences were certainly associated with the water used for irrigation. In fact, 

rainwater was more acidic than groundwater (RW: pH=5.8 ; GW: pH=7.1) while the 

groundwater showed high levels of nutrients, probably as a consequence of in situ 

leaching of fertilizers also applied to agricultural fields. Regarding the alachlor 

concentrations measured in both leachates RW+L and GW+L (Table VI.1), there was a 

clearl difference between them. Due to the low pH of rainwater, the hydronium ions 

(H
3
O

+
) in solution may have neutralized the negative charges of soil organic compounds 

and mineral particles, diminishing the sites available for alachlor sorption and therefore 

increasing its mobility.

6.3.2. Assays with Algae 

Figure VI.2 and Table VI.2 illustrates the results of the assays with P. subcapitata and A. 

flos-aquae. Any toxic effects were recorded on both species for the RW leachate. By 

contrast, the leachates from the treatments with the pesticide Lasso® (RW+L and GW+L) 

were highly toxic to the green algae P. subcapitata, causing a significantly reduction in 

their growth rate (GR) even at the highest leachate dilution (12.5%). For this algae species 

IC50 (96h) values of 9.7% (RW+L) and of 24.3% (GW+L) were recorded. The toxic effect of 

leachates was not promoted by the depletion of nutrients because controls with different 

concentrations of MBL performed similarly. Moreover, considering the results of the 

chemical analysis (see above in the Physico-chemical analysis section) and the sequence 

of dilutions performed in the leachates, the toxicity recorded to P. subcapitata 

corresponded approximately to a concentration of alachlor within the range of the IC50 

values reported in literature [e.g., Fairchild et al. (1998): IC50 (96h)=10 gL
-1

; Tomlin 

(2000): IC50 (72h)=12 gL
-1

; Monsanto Company (2002): IC50 (96h)=2.9 gL
-1

]. According to 

recent findings, chloroacetamides act primarily inhibiting the formation of very-long-

chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) through the inhibition of the VLCFA synthase (FAE1) (Böger, 

2003). As it is a crucial metabolic process, the inhibition of VLCFAs is phytotoxic to algae 

and higher plants, affecting the plasma membrane stability and functions required for cell 

elongation and division (Böger, 2003), which results in the inhibition of cell division and 

growth and finally in the death of the plant. Contrasting with the higher sensitivity

exhibited by P. subcapitata, any significant inhibitory effects were observed on the GR of 

A. flos-aquae which showed a similar response to the different treatments and dilutions. 

Although little is known about the effects of pesticides on cyanobacteria, some studies 

have shown that these species are less sensitive than green algae (e.g., Fairchild et al., 

1998; Sabater and Carrasco, 2001; Ma et al., 2004, 2006). The presence of algal blooms in 

Lake Vela is frequently associated with an increase in water temperature and with the 

input of nutrients from anthropogenic sources, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus 

(Abrantes et al., 2006b; de Figueiredo et al., 2006). Nevertheless, the low sensitivity 

showed by A. flos-aquae to pesticides relative to the green algae can also explain their 

massive growth and dominance in summer, after the application of pesticides. Generally, 

the dynamic of phytoplankton communities and the shift in dominant populations has 

being mainly attributed to physical, nutritional and biological factors. Our results 

underline the importance of incorporating data regarding pesticides concentrations in 

aquatic systems within the current models used to explain the fluctuation of freshwater 

populations.

6.3.3. Assays with Cladocerans 

Figure VI.3 and Table VI.2 illustrate the results for the endpoints assessed in the assays 

with D. magna and D. longispina. In spite of the contamination of leachates (RW+L and 

GW+L) with alachlor, no significant toxic effects were recorded on the somatic growth 

rate (SGR) and on the rate of population increase (r) for both species. Although the lack of 

literature data regarding alachlor chronic toxicity to Daphnia sp., acute toxicity values 

reported are usually remarkably higher (by three orders of magnitude) than the 

concentrations recorded in the leachates [e.g., Tomlin (2000): 48h-EC50 = 10,000 gL
-1

; 

Monsanto Company (2002): 48h-EC50 = 22,000 gL
-1

].  

When exposed to certain stimulus, Daphnia sp. adjusts its fitness in terms of the 

energy allocation to guarantee the maintenance and survival of the population 

(Polishchuk and Vijverberg, 2005; Pieters and Liess, 2006). In the presence of stress 

agents, Daphnia produces small broods with few large eggs, and the resulting neonates 

have more energy reserves that increase their resistance to starvation (Gliwicz and 

Guisande, 1992; Enserink et al., 1995; Knops et al., 2001; Coors et al., 2004;) or to toxic 

stress (Enserink et al., 1990; Smolders et al., 2005; Pieters and Liess, 2006). Our study 

showed that daphnids exposed to the different leachates have allocated more energy to

reproduction producing high broods and releasing the first brood earlier. Both responses 

enhanced the fitness of the organisms as it was demonstrated by the significant 

stimulation of the population growth rate (r) at almost all the dilutions of the three 

leachates.  

Although the presence of alachlor in leachates seemed not to directly affect the 

fitness of daphnids, it is important to consider the potential toxic effects in other related 

trophic levels, especially in primary producers, as showed by P. subcapitata, which could 

indirectly affect their consumers, namely daphnids, contributing to deep changes in the 

zooplanktonic community structure through a bottom-up cascade of events.

6.4. Conclusion 

This study showed that TMEs are a suitable and helpful tool for the simulation of the 

pesticides leaching phenomena in soils with a reduced retention function, and for the 

assessment of subsequent toxic effects in non-target aquatic organisms, under laboratory 

conditions.  

It was confirmed that Lake Vela has serious risks of contamination through leaching 

of pesticides, applied in surrounding agricultural fields, especially of the herbicide Lasso®, 

due to their great mobility in the soil compartment. Moreover, the results of bioassays 

with non-target species confirm that the contamination of the aquatic system could 

indirectly compromise the whole ecosystem by affecting the primary producers. Although 

this pesticide seemed not affect the primary consumers, those can be indirectly affected 

by changes in the structure of the phytoplankton community resulting, ultimately, in deep 

alterations in all the planktonic community of the lake. Thus, the obtained results are 

important from both regulatory and research perspectives with the final purpose of 

protecting and guarantee the sustainability of freshwater ecosystems.

VII – General Discussion  

 

Lake Vela, considered a natural aquatic habitat with community interest, has been 

exposed to diffuse sources of pollution (e.g., agriculture and livestock). These 

anthropogenic activities, through runoff or leaching, contribute to a great input of 

nutrients and pesticides accelerating the eutrophication process, and affecting non-target 

aquatic species, which compromises the environmental quality of the entire ecosystem as 

well as their value for recreational purposes. Hence, it was considered urgent and 

imperative to assess the risks posed by diffuse pollution to Lake Vela in order to provide 

useful information for the establishment of restoration and management measures 

directed to promote its sustainability. In Portugal, environmental recovery actions are 

usually based on impact assessment studies, which consist in a compilation of biological 

survey data characterized by scarce or absence of toxicological information. In order to 

surpass this setback, an ERA framework was used to assess the risks posed by diffuse 

pollution to the aquatic life. Some inferences were also made regarding potential risks to 

human health. ERA is a flexible and integrative process of orderliness and analysis of 

information related to the entire ecosystem, whose main goal is the evaluation of the 

likelihood that adverse ecological effects are caused by exposure to stressors (USEPA, 

1998). Through the identification of potential risks it is possible to recognize 

environmental problems, to select priorities for environment protection, to select targets 

to control, to assess the effectiveness of management options, and identify research 

needs. Moreover, ERA provides a critical component enabling risk managers to make 

well-founded environmental decisions. Some of the tasks proposed in the first step of this 

risk assessment process (chapter II), were performed in this study. However, more work is 

needed and is being done to present a reliable assessment of risks to the entire 

ecosystem. Nevertheless, through a weight-of-evidence approach some conclusions can 

be made combining the several assessed lines of evidence (chemical concentrations: in 

water, sediment and groundwater; fishes body burden; biological surveys; toxicity tests).  

 The present study confirmed the contamination of Lake Vela by diffuse pollution 

from local anthropogenic activities (e.g., agriculture and livestock), illustrated by the 



Chapter VII 

 

184 

presence of pesticides and by the high amounts of nutrients. Residues of current and non-

current pesticides, including two organochloride pesticides (OCPs) banned decades ago 

(aldrin and dieldrin), were detected in lake surface water, groundwater and sediments 

(chapter III). The measured concentrations of pesticides compared with toxicological 

benchmarks indicated the likelihood of harmful effects for aquatic species, due to the 

presence of alachlor, aldrin and dieldrin. The risk threshold of 1, calculated by HQ for 

these pesticides, was largely exceeded, indicating the existence of potential risks for the 

aquatic biota of Lake Vela. As reported in the chapter IV and V, high nutrient contents 

were also recorded in Lake Vela water. In fact, the use of TMEs to simulate the leaching of 

pesticides in local agricultural soils (chapter VI), confirmed that the current use of 

pesticides in agricultural fields near Lake Vela, especially Lasso®, allied to the site-specific 

characteristics (e.g., the high permeability and low organic matter content of soils), can 

easily contribute for the contamination of the aquatic ecosystem. 

 The seasonal variation of nutrients and pesticides observed in water and sediment 

samples was associated to the seasonality of the agricultural activity and to climatic 

factors, namely rainfall events, which promote the leaching and runoff of contaminants 

(chapter IV). The main crop in the surrounding agricultural fields is corn for livestock 

whose cultivation starts with land tillage in late April and continues until September, 

when corn is harvested. According to local farmers, the lands are highly fertilized with 

commercial products and livestock manures, and pesticides are intensively used, 

particularly the herbicides Lasso® and Roundup® for pre-emergent control. All the 

analyzed nutrients in water samples showed their highest values in the winter sampling 

period, especially nitrate and orthophosphate, providing evidence for the role of rainfall 

in the input of nutrients. The presence of pesticides, both in water and sediments was 

only reported in summer and autumn, with the highest concentrations recorded in 

autumn. In summer, the irrigation of lands is the main factor that promotes the runoff 

and leaching of pesticides, while in autumn the inputs of pesticides are certainly related 

to the elevated precipitation recorded before the sample.  

 All the pesticides analyzed were detected in water samples from both lake 

margins (EM and WM), suggesting the dispersion of contaminants throughout the whole 



Chapter VII 

 

185 

water body (chapter III). Nonetheless, the pesticide concentrations in the samples from 

the margin adjacent to agricultural lands (EM) were slightly more elevated. Regarding 

sediment samples there was a clear spatial variation of pesticides, which were below the 

detection limit in WM samples. This variation was consistent with the characteristics of 

sediments. In general, sediments collected in EM, when compared with those from the 

WM, presented a greater percentage of small size particles (silt and clay) and organic 

matter, which promote the higher adsorption of pesticides. In fact, the proximity of 

agricultural lands to the east and southeast margins of the lake is responsible for the 

input of small size particles of soil and of organic matter through surface runoff. 

The nutrient enrichment, or eutrophication, can lead to highly undesirable changes in 

aquatic ecosystem structure and function (Smith et al., 1999), being responsible for the 

loss of aquatic biodiversity (Carpenter et al., 1998). Examples of adverse effects caused by 

eutrophication include: increased biomass of phytoplankton; shifts in the phytoplanktonic 

community to bloom-forming species that may be toxic or inedible; changes in 

macrophyte species abundance and diversity; decreases in water transparency; 

dominance of small zooplanktonic species; oxygen depletion; increased incidence of fish 

kills; replacement of autochthonous species, more susceptible, by exotic species 

(modified from Carpenter et al. (1998)). In fact, toxic algal blooms have become 

increasingly frequent (e.g., A. flos-aquae and M. aeruginosa) and large fish kills have 

occurred in recent years in Lake Vela, as reported in chapter V. Moreover, the fish 

community was radically altered, due to the introduction of exotic species, mainly 

pumpkinseed sunfish (Castro, 2007), and the zooplankton was characterized by the 

dominance of rotifers in detriment of the cladocerans and copepods. All of these 

characteristics confirmed the advanced trophic state of Lake Vela and are indicators of its 

alarming condition. Actually, Antunes et al. (2003), through comparison with previous 

limnological works, reports that Lake Vela is more eutrophic than 10 years ago.  

Among the anthropogenic chemicals, pesticides may cause the most serious 

environmental problems because of their toxic effects and their bioaccumulation (Larson 

et al., 1999). Pesticides often affect nontarget organisms at several levels of the aquatic 

trophic chains and consequently affect the structure and the functioning of the whole 



Chapter VII 

 

186 

aquatic ecosystem (Hanazato, 2001). The use of a whole sample toxicity assessment 

(chapter IV) to evaluate the contamination and toxicity of water and sediment elutriates 

showed that water samples collected in summer and autumn affected significantly the 

growth rate of the green algae P. subcapitata at higher concentrations, which could be 

due to the presence of pesticides, namely the herbicide alachlor. Likewise, they revealed 

an apparent toxicity associated to the elutriate EM for P. subcapitata and for both 

daphnids, affecting their growth and reproduction. Although no pesticides were found in 

elutriates, high levels of un-ionized ammonia were recorded. In fact, ammonia has been 

considered a confounding factor in sediment toxicology (Lapota et al., 2000; Postma et 

al., 2002; Losso et al., 2007), with un-ionized ammonia being the most toxic form to 

aquatic environments (Camargo and Alonso, 2006). By comparing the several species, P. 

subcapitata revealed to be the most sensitive taxon, followed by the daphnids, and then 

by A. flos-aquae. The presence of algal blooms in Lake Vela is frequently associated with 

an increase in water temperature, in the warm season, as well as with nutrients-

enrichment, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus (chapter V). Nevertheless, the low 

sensitivity showed by A. flos-aquae to pesticides and ammonia relative to the green algae 

can also explain their massive growth and dominance in summer, after the application of 

pesticides. In general, the dynamics of phytoplankton and the shift in populations are only 

attributed to physical, nutritional and biological factors. This way, our results underline 

the importance of incorporating the contamination data within models to explain the 

population fluctuations. Although the presence of contaminants in Lake Vela seemed not 

to affect the fitness of daphnids in the laboratory, it is important to consider the potential 

toxic effects in other related trophic levels, especially in primary producers. In this way, 

effects in edible algae, as reported for P. subcapitata, could indirectly affect their 

consumers, namely daphnids. Additionally, the toxicity tests performed with the 

leachates obtained through the use of TMEs (chapter VI) confirmed that the current use 

of pesticides in the lands near Lake Vela, especially Lasso® (formulated with alachlor), 

allied to the site- specific characteristics, can affect the green algae, as it was recorded for 

P. subcapitata.

 Another line of evidence was the accumulation of alachlor in predator and benthic 

fish species, which confirms the bioavailability of this compound and their potential for 

bioaccumulation (chapter III). The ingestion of contaminated fish from Lake Vela could 

represent a risk to ecological and human receptors. Considering that top predators, such 

as otters and birds, are regular fish eating predators and that the transfers of 

contaminants through the food chain results in an increase of the xenobiotics 

concentrations in organisms from higher trophic levels (EC, 2003), the accumulation of 

alachlor in fish tissues may result in toxic concentrations to top predators. Regarding the 

human receptors, it was not possible to ascertain if the consumption of fish from Lake 

Vela represents a risk to human health because the amount of fish consumed per 

individual as well as the frequency of intake were unknown.  

 The concentrations of pesticides recorded in groundwater samples were also 

above the recommended safety levels for drinking water, which constitutes a concern for 

the local population’s health. This evidence indicated that the use of groundwater as a 

source of drinking water is likely to cause effects on the human health. EPA has found 

that long-term exposure to alachlor potentially causes damages in the liver, kidney, 

spleen, nasal mucosa and eyes at levels above the MCL. Additionally, there exists 

evidence that alachlor is carcinogenic to humans for lifetime exposures at levels above 

the MCL (USEPA, 2007b). Aldrin and dieldrin are highly toxic to humans, affecting the 

central nervous system and the liver. USEPA has classified aldrin and dieldrin as probable 

human carcinogens in the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) database (USEPA, 

2004). Glyphosate can cause kidney damage and reproductive effects for long term 

exposures above the MCL (USEPA, 2007c). Glyphosate was not classified as carcinogenic 

to humans (USEPA, 2004).  

 In summary, following a the weight of evidence approach, in a qualitative 

evaluation of risks, strong evidences were provided regarding the risks posed by diffuse 

pollution to the Lake Vela ecosystem. Moreover, regarding the several assessed lines of 

evidence it is feasible to establish, with some reasonability, causality between the 

stressor and the effects. However, it is not possible to establish specificity between the 



Chapter VII 

 

188 

stressor and the effects by the fact that several causal factors can be responsible for the 

observed effects.  

This study provides relevant information that could be helpful in future 

environmental decisions. Moreover, the environmental problems in Lake Vela were not 

an isolated case; actually, several freshwater shallow lakes in Portugal have similar 

problems. In this way the methodologies defined and used in this study may be also 

applied in other places. Nevertheless, despite our efforts to develop new tools for 

environmental assessment, they alone will not solve environmental problems (Moraes, 

2002). In fact, problems will remain while conservation goals still poorly defined and 

environmental regulations are not implemented or are disregarded.
