ABSTRACT – Two outcrops of the Traversodontidae Biozone, located in the municipal districts of Santa Cruz
do Sul and Venâncio Aires, were analyzed for their diagenetic patterns. Both outcrops share a very similar faunal
content, with a predominance of non-mammalian cynodonts, and also a common biostratinomic pattern.
Macroscopically, the bones are characterized by the presence of a thin, dark coloured layer composed by
manganese oxides, attached to the external surface and for the absence of volumetric distortions caused by
diagenesis, which often occur in the fossils of the Santa Maria Formation. On the microscopic level, a poor
osteological preservation is found. X-ray diffractometry and scanning electron microscopy analyses revealed a
high percentage of quartz in the samples, unlike the fossil bones found in other locations and stratigraphic levels
within the Santa Maria Formation, where only minimal concentrations of silica are found. The amount of quartz
filling the bones reflects different paleoenvironmental conditions and is here also correlated to the volumetric
changes in the bones at the different biozones within the Santa Maria Formation. In addition to the diagenetic
patterns shared by the Santa Cruz do Sul and Venâncio Aires outcrops, their similar biostratinomy and faunas
corroborate the hypothesis that both represent a distinct biozone within the Santa Maria Formation.

RESUMO – Dois afloramentos da Biozona de Traversodontidae, localizados nos municípios de Santa Cruz do
Sul e Venâncio Aires, foram analisados em relação ao seu padrão diagenético. Os afloramentos apresentam um
conteúdo faunístico muito semelhante, dominado pela presença de cinodontes não-mamalianos e, também, um
padrão bioestratinômico comum a ambos, considerando suas tafocenoses. Macroscopicamente, os ossos são
caracterizados pela presença de uma fina camada de coloração escura, composta de óxidos de manganês, na
superfície externa, e pela quase ausência de deformações morfológicas (aumento de volume). Em nível microscó-
pico, encontra-se uma pobre preservação osteológica. As difratometrias de raios-x e a microscopia eletrônica de
varredura revelaram uma alta porcentagem de quartzo nas amostras, diferente dos fósseis encontrados em outras
localidades da Formação Santa Maria, onde apenas concentrações mínimas são encontradas. A quantidade de
quartzo preenchendo os ossos reflete diferentes condições paleoambientais e é aqui também relacionada às
deformações volumétricas nos ossos de diferentes biozonas. O padrão diagenético similar dos afloramentos de
Santa Cruz do Sul e Venâncio Aires, além de suas características bioestratinômicas e faunísticas semelhantes,
corrobora a hipótese de que ambos representem um nível distinto na Formação Santa Maria, reforçando a
presença de uma biozona distinta.

INTRODUCTION

Two outcrops of the Santa Maria Formation (Middle-
Upper Triassic from southern Brazil), the “Schoenstatt”
outcrop, located in the city of Santa Cruz do Sul and the “Vila

Estância Nova” outcrop, located in Venâncio Aires munici-
pal district, have a fossil tetrapod assemblage of more than
90% non-mammalian cynodonts. Among the over 50
specimens collected until now, the only occurrences not
belonging to this group are a small archosaur (probably

related to Rhadinosuchus, according to Machado &amp;amp; Kischlat,
2003), found in Schoenstatt outcrop, and an indeterminate
tusked dicynodont, found in Vila Estância Nova outcrop.
This dominance of cynodonts does not occur in any other
outcrop of the Santa Maria Formation. Besides, some
cynodonts identified from the Schoenstatt outcrop, including
Charruodon (Abdala &amp;amp; Ribeiro, 2000) and Santacruzodon
(Abdala &amp;amp; Ribeiro, 2003), are distinct from those already
described for the two biozones established for the Santa Maria
Formation: the Therapsid Biozone (Mesotriassic) and the
Rhynchosaur Biozone (Neotriassic) (Scherer et al, 1995;
Schultz et al., 2000). Thus, Abdala et al. (2001), proposed a
new biozone, the Traversodontidae Biozone, for the fossil
assemblage found at that outcrop, which should be
positioned between those cited above.

Lucas (2001) argued that the occurrence of the new fauna
was much restricted (only at the Schoenstatt outcrop) and
the new cynodont taxa do not represent a distinct stage of
evolution related to those cynodonts from the underlying
Therapsid Biozone (Dinodontosaurus Biozone of Lucas, 2001)
to support the establishment of a distinct biozone, so that he
included the Schoenstatt outcrop and its fauna in his
Dinodontosaurus Biozone.

In this study, we analyze the diagenetic pattern of the
fossil bones from the Traversodontid Biozone, including the
Schoenstatt and Vila Estância Nova outcrops and also com-
pare the data obtained from these two outcrops with those
coming from other known outcrops belonging to the other
biozones of the Santa Maria Formation. Our goal is to deter-
mine if, from a diagenetic point of view, the Schoenstatt and
the Vila Estância Nova outcrops constitute a distinct level
within the Middle-Upper Triassic sequence of Brazil.

GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND LOCATION OF
THE OUTCROPS

The outcrops of Schoenstatt (Santa Cruz do Sul city, UTM
359767 E, 6709062 N) and Vila Estância Nova (Venâncio Aires
city, UTM 394997 E, 6720253 N) (Figures 1 to 3) are composed
of decimetric layers of massive red mudstones, alternated
with amalgamated lenticular bodies of fine sandstones. These
represent the typical association of the Alemoa Member of
the Santa Maria Formation. The age attributed to this unit is
Ladinian to Eonorian, based mainly on its paleotetrapods
(Scherer et al., 2000).

The materials used for comparisons (Table 1) were collected
in the Sanga Pinheiros outcrop, in Candelária city (UTM 331263
E, 6705014 N) and in the Faixa Nova outcrop, in Santa Maria
city (UTM 229955 E, 6711041 N), in red mudstones and fine-
grained sandstones of Ladinian-Carnian age (Figure 1).

The Santa Maria Formation tetrapod fauna has been
divided into two units: the Therapsid Biozone, of Ladinian
age and the Rhynchosaur Biozone, of Carnian age (Schultz
et al., 2000; Figure 4). The names indicate that the inferior
zone is dominated by the presence of therapsid synapsids,
especially the herbivorous dicynodont Dinodontosaurus,
while the hyperodapedontid rhynchosaurs (Diapsida,

Archosauromorpha) dominate the upper one. The
chronostratigraphic datum for the Rhynchosaur Biozone is a
radiometric age of 227 My. obtained at the basis of the
Ischigualasto Formation from Argentina (Rogers et al., 1993),
in which the same rhynchosaurs occur. Therapsid non-
mammalian cynodonts occur both in Therapsid and
Rhynchosaur Biozones, but are represented by distinct taxa
in each one of them (Abdala et al., 2001).

The Traversodontid Biozone fills the hiatus between the
Therapsida and Rhynchosauria Biozones, corresponding to
the Neoladinian, as proposed by some authors (Scherer et
al., 1995, Schultz et al., 1994, 2000; Figure 4).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The material studied (Table 1) consists of bone fragments
of cynodonts collected from the Schoenstatt and Vila Estância
Nova outcrops, which belong to the collection of the
Paleontology and Stratigraphy Department of the Universida-
de Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). In both outcrops
the bones are disarticulated, sometimes fragmented or crushed,
probably due to trampling. There is no evidence of selective
transport, nor a preferential bone orientation, which confirms
the absence of hydraulic influence on the distribution of the
bones. All the bones occur in a pelitic matrix, which formed in
a low-energy environment (Machado, 2004).

The materials collected in Schoenstatt and Vila Estância
Nova outcrops are macroscopically very similar, with a thin
and darkned layer covering all the bones. The absence of
significant volumetric changes in the bones from these
outcrops also becomes evident when compared to the

materials from other localities of South Brazilian Triassic (e.g.
those pictured by Holz &amp;amp; Schultz, 1998 from Therapsid and
Rhynchosaur Biozones).

In order to compare diagenetic patterns among different
stratigraphic levels within the Santa Maria Formation, the
fossils from Schoenstatt and Vila Estância Nova were
confronted, with those coming from the Therapsid and
Rhynchosaur Biozones (referred by Holz &amp;amp; Schultz, 1998).
Thin sections and respective fossil bones from dicynodonts
(5 specimens) and rhynchosaurs (18 specimens) were used.
From these, one specimen of dicynodont (thin section UFRGS
PV0969T) and two of rhynchosaurs (thin sections UFRGS
PV0970T and UFRGS PV0298T) were selected to be analyzed
in detail. The thin section UFRGS PV0969T was analyzed by
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), as described below.
The samples were separated into groups according to their
origin: Vila Estância Nova, Schoenstatt, Sanga Pinheiros and
Faixa Nova outcrops (Table 1).

An impregnation technique, adapted from Timm (1996),
was applied to some bone samples in order to prepare them
as thin sections for histological analysis under optical
microscope (Figures 6 - 8). Another technique applied in this
study was X-Ray diffractometry (XRD), using macerated
materials. This technique characterizes the diagenetic pro-
cesses that occurred at those paleoenvironments through
the identification of the minerals present both in the bones
and the surrounding matrix (Table 2). XRD analyses were
performed with a Siemens D5000 diffractometer using Cu Ká
radiation with generator conditions of 40 kV, 20 mA, with a
step size of 0.020 2q and a time step of 1 s.

Some of the sections were also analyzed by SEM. The
samples selected were from Schoenstatt (M7), Vila Estância
Nova (M9), and Sanga Pinheiros (one of thin sections used
by Holz &amp;amp; Schultz, in 1998, UFRGS PV0969T), representing
the Therapsid Biozone. All these samples were coated with
carbon. Qualitative and semi-quantitative chemical analyses

with Electron Dispersion Spectroscopy (EDS) were made in
selected spots in each sample (Figure 9). Each spot was
photomicrographed (Figure 10).

RESULTS

Optical microscopy
Observation under an optical microscope indicated that

all the bones collected in Shoenstatt and Vila Estância Nova
have an equally poor histological preservation due to the
dissolution of the bone tissue. This state of preservation
precludes the identification of preserved bone structures,
with the exception of some minor walls of the trabecular bone
and also little fragments of lamellar bone (Figure 6). On the
other hand, in most of the fossil bones from the Therapsid
and Rhynchosaur Biozones (Holz &amp;amp; Schultz, 1998) it is
possible to observe more histological structures preserved
(contrasting with the bad external preservation) such as
almost complete bone lamellae (Figure 5). The main filling
minerals in Schoenstatt and Vila Estância Nova outcrops are
quartz (Figures 6 - 8), and calcite (Figure 8). The quartz crystals
occur filling the pores of the bones, forming huge crystals or
just aggregations of small crystals. In the thin sections from
fossils from Therapsid and Rhynchosaur Biozones no quartz,
but just calcite was found in the bones, between bone
lamellae, splitting them (Figure 5). Calcite crystals are also
present in the bones from Schoenstatt and Vila Estância Nova,
but in much smaller quantity than in those from Therapsid
and Rhynchosaur Biozones (Holz &amp;amp; Schultz, 1998). In the
thin sections, the dark layer which macroscopically
characterizes the bones from Schoenstatt and Vila Estância
Nova (Figures 6 and 8) occurs as well defined dark stains,
not only covering the external border of the bones but also
inside them, generally close to fractures.

X-Ray Diffractometry (XRD)
Three bone XRD analyses and two matrix XRD analyses

were made on materials from Vila Estância Nova, while four
bone analyses and one matrix analysis were made on
Schoenstatt materials. The results of the analyses are
presented in Table 2. In all bone samples fluorapatite was

detected. Quartz and calcite are also detected in most bone
samples, except for the sample UFRGS PV0579T (from
Schoenstatt), where no calcite was detected and UFRGS
PV0583T, where no quartz was detected. In all sediment
samples quartz was detected.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
Figure 9 shows the percentages of P, Ca and Si found in

each sample. Three analyses were made on materials from
the Therapsid Biozone collected in the Sanga Pinheiros
outcrop (UFRGS PV0969T) and four on materials from the
Traversodontid Biozone, two from the Schoenstatt (M7) and
two from the Vila Estância Nova (M9) outcrops.

Three kinds of samplings are represented in Figure 9: those
identified as “bone” represent EDS analyses of the elements
detected in a bone spot. These samples present high
concentration of Ca and P (reflecting just the presence of the
main constituents of bone hydroxylapatite). The samplings
identified as “pore” represent EDS analyses of pores of the
bones, where diagenetic minerals were accumulated. The third
kind of sampling, identified as “average”, represents EDS
analyses of spots containing both bone and pore fillings.

In one of the samples (M9) the dark layer, which covers
the external surface of most bones, was also analyzed. An
average percentage of 63.62% of Mn was detected, always
associated with Ba (in concentrations of nearly 7%). A
photomicrograph of this Mn and Ba enriched area was taken
(Figure 10). Low concentrations of Al (1.35%), Si (3.54%), Cl
(0.75%) and Ca (1.85%) were detected in the same sampling.
On the other hand, in the fossils from Therapsid and
Rhynchosaur Biozones, external layers around the bones are
mainly represented by Fe oxides (Holz &amp;amp; Schultz, 1998).

In some isolated samplings of Schoenstatt (M7) other
elements were detected as Ir (0.96%), Nd (19.94%) and V
(66.77%).

DISCUSSION

The study of the morphological and chemical
characteristics of the fossil bones can provide information
about environmental conditions during early taphonomic

history. It is possible to determine the level of microstructure
preservation of fossils only after microscopic analyses. All
the microanalyses made here showed a poor histological
preservation of the bones from Schoenstatt and Vila Estân-
cia Nova outcrops, on the contrary of the bones from Faixa
Nova (Therapsid biozone) and Sanga Pinheiros (Rhynchosaur
biozone) outcrops, in which the histological preservation is
better in spite of the poor external preservation. The main
permineralizing minerals in Schoenstatt and Vila Estância Nova
outcrops are quartz and calcite and the external dark coloured
layer is composed of Mn oxides and Ba. Comparing these
data to samples from Rhynchosaur and Therapsid biozones
(Figure 9 – UFRGS PV0969T and observation of other thin
sections under the optic microscope), where no quartz crystals
are found, the high quartz (Si) concentrations detected in
Schoenstatt and Vila Estância Nova become even more
evident, attributing them an exclusive mineralogic feature.

Quartz filling the pores of bones could result from
pedogenic or phreatic processes in arid environments (Hesse,
1989). In the case of pedogenic processes, the quartz could
result from the precipitation of inorganic silica in the form of
silcretes, in a process closely related to soil formation and/or
weathering (Hesse, 1989). Machado (2004) found some root
marks in the Schoenstatt outcrop, which were interpreted as
evidence of paleosoil. Regarding phreatic processes,

177REICHEL ET AL. – DIAGENETIC PATTERN OF FOSSILS FROM THE TRAVERSODONTIDAE BIOZONE

silicification could occur in beds, resulting in heterogeneities
in stratification. In both cases the bones act as a nucleus for
the silicification when they are not in geochemical equilibrium
with Si rich percolant fluids (if previously carbonated, for
example). Therefore, they become potential targets for
dissolution and epigenic substitution by quartz. The process
could be incomplete (affecting just a percentage of the fossil,
with some calcite remaining). So, it is possible that the
silicification process in these fossils has been eodiagenetic
over a previously carbonated material (also by phreatic or
pedogenic processes, according to Da Rosa et al., 2003).

The exact mechanism of this switch between quartz/calcite
deposition is still poorly understood. It is possible that
changes in pH and silica concentrations may have caused
dissolution of calcite and deposition of silica, or dissolution
of silica and deposition of calcite (Krauskopf, 1972).
Nevertheless, it is unclear what kind of environmental
changes may have caused such geochemical alterations.

In the material studied low quartz concentrations are
found in the bone samplings, demonstrating that this mineral
concentrates preferentially in the pores, and not in the bone
matrix itself (compare in Figure 9, bone and pore samples,
from Schoenstatt [M7] and Vila Estância Nova [M9]). The
quartz concentration in these samplings is much higher than
that present in bones from Sanga Pinheiros (UFRGS PV0969T).

It is very important to stress that the absence of Ca in the
pore of the Schoenstatt sample analyzed by SEM does not
indicate the total absence of Ca in all pores, because the
diagenetic minerals do not necessarily have a homogeneous
distribution inside the fossils. In fact, the presence of calcite
was detected for Schoenstatt and Vila Estância Nova fossils
by X-Ray Diffractometry (Table 2) and Optic Microscopy
analyses (Figure 8).

The Optic Microscopy analyses (Figures 5 - 8) enable us
to visualize the real difference between the mineral filling of
the bones from the Traversodontid biozone (Schoenstatt and
Vila Estância Nova outcrops) and the bones from the other
biozones. In the Schoenstatt and Vila Estância Nova outcrops,

the quartz crystals are clear and easily recognizable,
demonstrating a different diagenetic pattern between those
outcrops and those where no quartz crystal was recognized
(Holz &amp;amp; Schultz, 1998).

These microscopic analyses demonstrate that there is no
relationship between the appearance of the bones and their
histological preservation. The same was concluded in a
microscopical analysis of archaeological bones (Garland,
1989). This author stressed the intimate relationship between
the depositional environment and the histological
preservation of bone tissues. Therefore, the similar
histological preservation pattern observed in Schoenstatt
and Vila Estância Nova samples suggests a correlation
between both the localities studied and their respective
depositional environments. In both, the same kind of
dissolution of bone tissue can be observed. Hard skeletal
parts dissolution can occur during diagenesis or weathering
due to the infiltration of water associated with pH variations
of the environment. Calcite is dissolved in acid conditions,

while quartz becomes soluble under alkaline conditions (Holz
&amp;amp; Simões, 2002). Therefore, the sedimentary environment at
the time of the Traversodontid Biozone may have been more
acidic during the beginning of the fossilization process
(eodiagenesis), allowing the precipitation of quartz in the
pores of the bones.

Geochemical considerations indicate that the silica
released during weathering of alkali feldspars will not be used
up completely by the formation of clay minerals, because in
the most abundant clay minerals, Si:Al ratios are below 2:1
whereas in alkali feldspars ratios are 3:1. During alteration of
alkali feldspars to clay minerals, silica is left over and from
this excess silica quartz can be formed. The solubility of
amorphous silica in water at 25°C and at a pH below 9 is
about 120 ppm SiO

2
, with silica in solution in the monomeric

form. It has been shown that even from strongly
undersaturated solutions (concentrations down to 0.5 ppm
SiO

2
) silica can be adsorbed by hydroxides of Fe, Al, Mn, Mg

and other elements. So, in natural sedimentary environments,
the hydroxides of Fe, Al, Mn, Mg, etc. adsorb silica and thus
enable the formation of quartz in marine and fresh water
environments (Harder &amp;amp; Flehming, 1970). At this point it is
important to stress the presence of manganese in the fossils
analyzed, which may have some influence in the quartz
concentration on the outcrops studied.

The formation of silicic acid (H
4
SiO

4
) in shallow waters or

in the interstitial waters, or in the interstitial water of a
quartzous sediment (Taguchi et al., 1988), is probably related
to intense rainfall during early diagenetic stages. This would
lead to a minor acidification around fossil bones, which could
cause damage to the bone structure. However, when this
silicic acid encounters an alkaline environment, represented
by a previously carbonated bone, precipitation of silica in
the bone pores begins. This could explain why the fossil
bones from these outcrops present a poor histological
preservation but keep their original size, preventing the
volumetric changes which occur in the bones coming from
the other biozones (like those studied by Holz &amp;amp; Schultz in

1998) caused by the expansive growing of calcite crystals
inside the bones. The silicification of fossils, as an
eodiagenetic process, turns them relatively resistant to any
other subsequent diagenetic processes (Carson, 1991), as
compression or physical distortions.

The apatite detected in the fossils was identified as
fluorapatite by the XRD, so that the fossil-bone mineral is
francolite (carbonate fluorapatite), rich in fluorine and carbon
dioxide. According to Newesely (1989), in vivo bones begin
a crystalographic maturation of the hydroxylapatite with an
i n c o r p o r a t i o n  o f  F - t o  i t s  s t r u c t u r e  i n  v e r y  l o w
concentrations. This substitution may continue during
diagenesis, depending on the conditions of the environment.
Dahllite (the apatite with F- concentration&amp;lt;1%), which
occurs in in vivo bones, changes to francolite (the apatite
with F- concentration &gt;1%, which was detected by the XRD
analyzes). The fluorine does not only substitute the
hydroxyls (OH- radicals in hydroxylapatites), which can
completely disappear, but also substitutes PO

4
3- for CO

2-,

while the apatite turns into carbonate-fluorapatite (Lucas
&amp;amp; Prévôt, 1991). These chemical alterations occur by simple
ionic change. The increase in fluorine concentration during

179REICHEL ET AL. – DIAGENETIC PATTERN OF FOSSILS FROM THE TRAVERSODONTIDAE BIOZONE

diagenesis can lead to a higher crystallinity (Lucas &amp;amp;
Prévôt, 1991), as also observed in a study about diagenesis
i n  S u p e r i o r  C r e t a c e o u s  f o s s i l s ,  i n  w h i c h  a  h i g h e r
crystallinity in bones was documented (and its original
apatite was substituted by francolite), when compared to
modern bones (Elorza et al., 1999).

The hydroxylapatite is relatively insoluble in high pH
soils, but localized acidity around the skeleton, as those
described above, could increase its solubility (as well as its
propensity to suffer any kind of damage). The nature of the
ionic substitutions between the bone apatite and the
surrounding sediment can also influence the solubility of the
hydroxylapatite: substitutions involving fluorines decrease
its solubility, while carbonatic inclusions increase it (Pate et
al.,1989).

In the Schoenstatt and Vila Estância Nova outcrops, the
ionic changes between the sediment and the bones studied
led to the substitutions of OH- by F- (see Table 2, the detection
of fluorapatite [francolite] by the XRD). Therefore, the
reduction of the apatite solubility could have contributed to
a better morphological preservation of the bones (in spite of
poorer histological preservation). The fossils of the Therapsid
and Rhynchosaur Biozones, which were affected by
carbonate solutions, present marked volumetric changes
(Holz &amp;amp; Schultz, 1998).

Nevertheless, the most important factor for the
preservation of these fossils has not only been the occurrence
of silica, but the occurrence of silica associated with other
factors. The processes that involve the precipitation of silica
inside the bone pores indicate acid environments, which could
damage the bones if they were exposed for a too long time to
such conditions (because the bones could have been
completely dissolved). The presence of calcite increased the
alkalinity, preventing these excessive acid conditions.

In this case, even if hydroxylapatite represents the best
defined constituent of the inorganic matrix of the bone, it
does not occur in a pure state, nor represents the only
inorganic phase (Newesely, 1989). This indicates that
diagenesis is not a simple process and never depends on
one isolated factor or mineral. Not just the soil and
groundwater, but the bone itself has a complex and variable

inorganic composition that contributes to variations of the
diagenetic processes. Therefore, strong similarity between
the diagenetic patterns of different localities can be very
useful for stratigraphic correlation.

Many details can still be explored in the future, including
the trace elements detected by SEM analyses (Mn, Ba, V, Nd,
Ir) and their paleoenvironmental implications, leading to a
more precise understanding of the relationship between the
outcrops studied and an understanding of the biology of the
collected fossil groups (Williams, 1989; Williams et al., 1997;
Toots &amp;amp; Voorhies, 1965).

CONCLUSIONS

The outcrops of Schoenstatt (Santa Cruz do Sul) and Vila
Estância Nova (Venâncio Aires) present the same diagenetic
pattern, which is distinct from others within the Santa Maria
Formation. Both of them present a high percentage of silica
filling the bones, while in the other levels (Therapsid and
Rhynchosaur Biozones), silica is absent. It could be observed
both in optic microscopy and SEM analyzes. A distinct
biostratinomic pattern was also observed for the fossil
assemblages of these outcrops (Machado, 2004). These
diagenetic and biostratinomic patterns, which are shared by
Schoenstatt and Vila Estância Nova outcrops and differ from
those of the other biozones, reinforce the existence of a
distinct biozone for the middle portion of the Santa Maria
Formation, even if represented by two isolated outcrops.

The faunal change, observed in the Traversodontid
Biozone, could be interpreted in this case, as a consequence
of an environmental change (arid climate, according to Ma-
chado, 2004), which would produce the distinct sedimentary
facies observed in this unit within the Santa Maria
Formation.
