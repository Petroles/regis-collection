ABSTRACT

This work is an application of the 14C-Polymethylmethacrylate method to compare the porosity evolution between unal-

tered and propylitic-altered granites, using samples from Lavras do Sul region, Brazil. This method, when coupled with

optical and electronic petrography has the advantage over other methods to provide the quantification and identification

of total and local porosity of rocks. From petrographic observations, different kinds of porous zones were identified

and quantified (microfractures, grain boundaries, alteration of minerals, etc). Results show that unaltered granites

have 0.5 to 0.6% porosity and propylitic-altered ones have 1.7 to 1.8% porosity, even between samples with different

textures. Porosity of altered rocks increases mainly due to higher porosity of neoformed chlorite, calcite, sericite and

microfractures. Field observations show that later phyllic alteration halos are wider in equigranular than in porphyritic

granites, which could not be explained by different original porosity between those rocks. The observed differences

of phyllic halos diffusion were controlled by structural and fluid/rock ratio variations between the equigranular and

porphyritic granitic facies during the later hydrothermal stage.

Key words: porosity quantification, 14C-PMMA method, granite porosity, hydrothermal alteration, propylitic
alteration, Lavras do Sul.

INTRODUCTION

Methodologies for rock porosity quantification like wa-

ter impregnation, mercury injection, fluorescent resin im-

pregnation and gas adsorption in different kinds of rocks

have been developed in the last decades (Dubois et al.

1998, Schild et al. 2001, Yue et al. 2004). These meth-

ods however, have reasonable resolutions only for total

rock porosity. The 14C-Polymethylmethacrylate (14C-

PMMA) method has the advantage over those methods

because it provides also the porosity quantification of se-

lected areas of the rock surface (Hellmuth et al. 1993).

When coupled with petrographic data and image analy-

sis, it is possible to recognize the petrophysical charac-

teristics of its associated sites (Oila et al. 2005, Sardini

et al. 2006).

The recognition and quantification of rock poros-

ity are important for the following reasons (Schild et al.

2001): (1) evolution (propagation and coalescence) of

microcracks controls the mechanical behavior of brittle

regimes; (2) porous zones are pathways for fluid flow

and solute diffusion and (3) orientation of microfissures

controls the anisotropy of petrophysical and mechanical

properties of rocks that can indicate stress regimes. In

hydrothermal systems, porosity quantification of altered

and unaltered rocks can be used as a tool for prevision of

fluid/rock ratio and for recognition and quantification of

pathways controlling hydrothermal alteration.

The Lavras do Sul Gold Mining District (LD) com-

prises hydrothermally altered Au-Cu (± Pb, Zn, Ag)-
bearing prospects hosted in Neoproterozoic granitic and

volcanogenic sequence, located near the town of Lavras

do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul State (RS), southernmost

Brazil (Fig. 1). The major gold mineralizations (0.4 to

5 ppm) are located in N40?E to E–W quartz + diocta-
hedral phyllosilicates + pyrite (± chalcopyrite) veins and
breccia and their related alteration halos. These highly al-

tered and deformed zones are associated to an alteration

stage (phyllic alteration) that superimposes initially unal-

tered and propylitic (pervasive alteration) altered rocks.

The granitic complex which hosts the mineraliza-

tions is characterized by a reverse zonation of its geo-

chemical and petrographic features, called central, trans-

itional and border facies (Nardi and Lima 1985). The

central facies comprises shoshonitic rapakivi coarse-

grained porphyritic granodiorites and monzogranites,

while the border facies hosts mainly alkaline coarse-

grained equigranular perthite granites. The transitional

facies comprises textural and geochemical hybrid rocks

(monzo and syenogranites) generated by partial assim-

ilation of the central facies by the border one (Nardi

and Lima 1985). The occurrence of microgranular mafic

enclaves (MME) attests a coeval mafic magmatism

with both central and border granitoids (Nardi and Lima

2000), besides swarms of enclaves are more likely found

in the transitional and border granitic facies.

It is known from field observations and borehole

descriptions (E.M. Bongiolo, unpublished data) that dif-

fusion of hydrothermal alteration halos around veins

(phyllic alteration) is quite different between the granitic

facies. Perthite granites from border facies have com-

monly wider halos (up to 40 m width) than rapakivi

granites from the central facies (&amp;lt;10 m width), although

phyllic alteration was probably produced at the same

time in both facies, as they have similar 595 ± 5 Ma

magmatic age (Remus et al. 2000) and structural ori-

entation of later mineralized veins associated to phyllic

alteration.

The aims of the present contribution are (1) to com-

pare the evolution of porosity between unaltered and

propylitic-altered granitic rocks using samples from

Lavras do Sul area and (2) to test the influence of primary

porosity of rocks on the diffusion (width) of later phyl-

lic alteration halos around veins from different granitic

facies. The 14C-polymethylmethacrylate (14C-PMMA)

method, coupled with detailed petrographic and digital

image processing studies were carried out to identify and

quantify the micrometer to decimeter porosity hetero-

geneities of rocks from central and border granitic facies

and to compare the obtained results with field data.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

It was selected four granitic rock samples of drill cores

from Bloco do Butiá (sample A) and Valdo Teixeira (sam-

ples C and D) prospects and of a surface quarry from

Cerrito (sample B) prospect (Fig. 1B).

Samples A and B represent original or near unal-

tered rocks with contrasting compositions and textures

(border and central granitic facies respectively) that hosts

different alteration halos width of later phyllic alteration.

They were collected in zones where fractures and faults

are not observed. Samples C and D represent avail-

able boreholes comprising propylitic-altered rocks (bor-

der granitic facies) of contrasting texture, i.e. associated

to an intermediate (pervasive) alteration stage between

unaltered and highly altered rocks. They were collected

in altered zones near structurally controlled quartz veins

from Valdo Teixeira prospect, but with weak or no influ-

ence of later alteration halos.

THE 14 C-POLYMETHYLMETHACRYLATE

(14 C-PMMA) METHOD

The 14C-PMMA method developed by Hellmuth et al.

(1993) consists in sample impregnation with 14C-MMA

under vacuum, polymerization by irradiation and au-

toradiography of sample surface. A bidimensional (2D)

porosity image is obtained and optical density and poros-

ity calculations were performed on samples using digital

image processing techniques.

lar molecule with low viscosity (0.00584 Pa s at 20?C)
and small size (100.1 g/mol) when compared to the wa-

ter molecule, which allows an effective penetration in

the rock porous spaces. The 14C low-energy (maximum

155 keV) and its 5360 years half-life yields good autora-

diographic resolutions for rocks submitted to long time

impregnation.

The core samples were sawed and dried in a vacuum

chamber (T = 90 to 114?C) during 10 days. The drying
process is very important, because the MMA molecule

has a hydrophobic characteristic that inhibits its com-

plete infiltration in rocks when water is present. This

step was followed by the impregnation of samples with
14C-MMA in the same vacuum chamber during 21 days.

After that, the 14C-MMA impregnated in samples was

polymerized (fixed in the rock matrix) during 8 days,

which consists in ? -ray irradiation (total dose: 77 kGy)

using a 60Co source. The initial concentration of the
14C-MMA tracer used in this study was 0.5 MBq/ml.

Thin sections of impregnated rock fragments were pro-

duced for petrographic observations of the similar areas

and to obtain an estimative of the volume (%) of mineral

phases present in each sample by point counting (1500

points). A better quantification of mafic mineral contents

in exactly the same areas used for porosity quantification

of unaltered rocks was performed digitally on JPEG im-

ages after selective staining techniques (see below) using

Adobe Photoshop? software. The main petrographic
characteristics and the mineral content in each sample

are summarized on Table I. The sawn surface of rock

samples was polished (1/4 µm) and cleaned ultrason-

ically for 3 minutes to obtain very plane surfaces be-

fore to perform the autoradiography exposition. After

performed the autoradiography, the plane surfaces were

covered with carbon to obtain additional petrographic

observations directly on the rock, using a Jeol JSM-5800

Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) equipped with an

EDS quantitative analyzer.

The autoradiography method is based on detection

of radiation with nuclear emulsions. The sensibility of

the autoradiographic film is a function of exposition

time, activity of the radiation target and the blacken-

ing of the photographic film (Hellmuth et al. 1993). A

Kodak? X-OMAT MA film (20 µm resolution) was used
with the impregnated samples and together with 14C-

PMMA calibration series (5.1356–3 to 97.535–3 MBq/ml

activities). These patterns are used to calculate the cali-

bration function for quantitative analyses of rock poros-

ity (Hellmuth et al. 1993). The exposition time of rock

samples and thin sections was 5 days. The obtained au-

toradiographies were digitalized in BMP grey level (8

bit), using transparent option and a resolution of 1200

dpi (each pixel is 21.2 µm2) using a UMAX Power Look

III scanner.

THEORETICAL ASSUMPTIONS OF POROSITY

CALCULATION

The porosity quantification is based on the assumption

that optical densities on autoradiographies are propor-

tional to the decaying isotope contents in the studied ma-

terial (Hellmuth et al. 1993, Oila et al. 2005).

The rock porosity calculation using the autoradio-

graphies comprises the following steps:

– initially all grey-levels intensities (I ) and its related

background (I0) are determined digitally in several

areas of the sample;

– the optic densities (D) are calculated using the

Lambert-Beer law (Equation 1) and lately converted

into activities ( A) using Microcal Origin? soft-
ware. This software provides a calibration curve

based on interactive calculation using tree param-

eters: the k correction factor, the minimum opti-

cal density (D0) and the maximum optical density

(Dmax ) shown in equation 2 (Treutler and Freyer

1988);

– the activities are then converted to porosities us-

ing the Autoradio© software (D. Prêt, unpublished

data).

The quantitative porosity measurement is based on

the assumption that the rock matrix dilutes the 14C-

PMMA. If the pore sizes are under the resolution of

the autoradiography (usually &gt; 0.1 µm), the major frac-

tion of the emitted ?-radiation is attenuated by the rock

and the porosity calculation is applicable. The local rock

porosity (?) is obtained by the calculation of the 14C

tracer contents in an analyzed area (Equation 3):

Finally, the intensity levels observed in the autora-

diography are proportional to the 14C-PMMA tracer con-

tents in the rock porous spaces according to relations (1),

(2) and (3). Lower intensities of grey level on the film

represent 100% porosity.

MINERAL STAINING

After autoradiography, the primary minerals were identi-

fied on unaltered rock surfaces by staining procedure and

digital processes to obtain an estimative of volume (%)

of rock forming minerals in that area. As mafic minerals

are highly susceptible to alteration, this technique had

the aim to test the influence of different mafic contents

on total porosity of unaltered rocks. Altered rocks were

excluded from this process because staining techniques

are similar for carbonates and mafic minerals. First, the

samples were etched with hydrofluoric acid during 30

seconds, washed with distilled water, immersed in a K-

ferrocyanide solution (Müller 1967) for 12 hours to stain

the ferro-magnesian minerals blue and dried at room tem-

perature for 1 hour. Second, the colored surfaces were

etched with hydrofluoric acid during 30 seconds, washed

with distilled water, immersed in a Na-cobaltinitrite so-

lution (Hutchison 1974) for 1 minute and dried at room

temperature for 1 hour. The latter step stain the feldspars

yellow, plagioclase white and quartz grey and did not

affect ferro-magnesian minerals that had already been

stained.

The stained rock surfaces were digitalized in 24-

bit RGB mode with high resolution in the same areas as

the autoradiographies. The four colors representing dif-

ferent minerals were color level adjusted and thresholded

using Adobe Photoshop? software to obtain a histogram
of total modal contents of each color on rock surface

areas. Biotite and amphibole contrast greatly with the

surrounding felsic minerals and can be extracted easily.

RESULTS

PETROGRAPHIC AND AUTORADIOGRAPHIC

OBSERVATIONS

Figure 2 shows the original (not treated) rock samples

(A to D) and its corresponding autoradiographies (A’ to

D’) of the same area. From autoradiography images of

impregnated samples, thin sections and SEM observa-

tions, several types of pores were identified, i.e. these

data are used for porosity qualitative identification, be-

fore quantification of total and local porosity of rocks.

The nomenclature of pore types follows the suggestion

of Siitari-Kauppi (M. Siitari-Kauppi, unpublished data):

(i) transgranular, that transect mineral grains; (ii) inter-

granular, represented by a connected network between

grains; and (iii) intragranular (inside grains), that can be

found connected to another pore type or isolated, as a

residual pore. It is also important to point out that rocks

usually called “unaltered” have always minor amounts

of secondary minerals, as observed in the studied sam-

ples (Table I).

In sample A, porous zones observed in the autora-

diography are mainly associated to transgranular and in-

tragranular microfissures and wider patches of different

grey-level intensity. The transgranular microfissure net-

work predominates and is regularly distributed through

the equigranular sample, affecting all rock forming min-

erals. These fissures are always unfilled or filled by a

thin film of hematite. They have commonly homoge-

neous grey level intensity in the autoradiography and

long linear forms with average 4 µm aperture. It can

be better observed on alkali feldspar and quartz grains,

due to volumetric predominance and lighter grey level

of these minerals in the autoradiography image when

compared to microfissures. Intragranular porosity is as-

sociated to linear microfissures with 2 to 3 µm aper-

ture, usually interconnected with transgranular ones that

locally coincide with cleavage plans of mafic minerals

(Fig. 3A). Twin plans and perthitic exsolution structures

do not correspond to porous zones (Fig. 3B) and inter-

granular microfissures are observed only locally. Wide

patches with mean grey level intensity in the autora-

diography were identified after petrographic studies as

amphibole and minor amounts of biotite with 0.8 to

2 mm grain size and locally to slight sericitization of

feldspars. Different grey level are observed inside the

limits of mafic minerals: darker zones in the autora-

diography (higher porosity) represent high density of

microfissures or alteration of amphibole (± biotite) to
chlorite through cleavage planes, sometimes associated

to lesser amounts of calcite, hematite and pyrite. Lighter

zones of lower porosity correspond to unaltered zones

of the same minerals and to quartz inclusions.

In sample B, the porphyritic texture of the rock al-

lows us to differentiate two main sites with visual con-

trasting porosity intensity on autoradiography: (i) phe-

nocrysts (alkali feldspar) and (ii) matrix (alkali feldspar,

plagioclase, quartz, amphibole and biotite). Both sites

comprise an interconnected network of randomly dis-

tributed trans-, intra- and intergranular microfissures af-

fecting all rock forming minerals. Transgranular mi-

crofissures are always unfilled or partly filled by a thin

film of hematite. Phenocrysts represent ample lighter

areas on the autoradiography, where transgranular and

intragranular microcracks occur with linear forms with

average 3 µm aperture and intergranular microfissures

contour grain boundaries (? 3 µm aperture). The weak
alteration of plagioclase from rapakivi mantling rims

provides a bad visual estimative of alkali feldspar phe-

nocrysts contents on autoradiography image, as alkali

feldspar grains seems to be smaller (only the core is

completely preserved) than they really are. The fine

grained matrix provides an interconnected network of

tortuous intergranular microfissures with 1.5 to 8 µm

aperture (Fig. 3C), which yields a mean grey level inten-

sity of the matrix in the autoradiography. This grey level

intensity of the matrix is also provided by the presence

of amphibole and biotite (in general &amp;lt;0.6 mm size), usu-

ally less fractured and altered than in sample A, and in

minor amounts to sericitization of plagioclase and slight

alteration to chlorite and calcite. The intragranular mi-

crofissures of mafic minerals are mainly represented by

opened cleavage plans with 1.3 to 4 µm width (Fig. 3D

and E). Associated quartz and alkali feldspar represent

always the lower porosity minerals of the matrix on the

autoradiography.

Dark dots are also a well marked porosity site, which

porosity level (see text for discussion). White letters on the autoradiography (A to L) correspond to sites showed in Figure 3.

and/or monazite crystals; G – highly connected network of tortuous intergranular microfissures from sample C, which is tighter than the same

corresponds mainly to zircon and monazite crystals

(Fig. 3F).

As for the previous samples, ample light zones (low

porosity) on autoradiographies of samples C and D com-

prise quartz and alkali feldspar. High porosity (darker)

zones are mainly associated to (i) microfissures and (ii)

hydrothermal alteration of original rock forming miner-

als. The microfissure density and width in these samples

is higher than for samples A and B. It comprises a marked

and connected network of trans-, intra- and intergranular

pores with contrasting forms and mineral fillings, de-

pending on rock texture.

In sample C, transgranular microfissures with 2 to

4 µm aperture have linear to slightly tortuous forms in

both the rock matrix and phenocrysts (alkali feldspar

and quartz). It is highly connected with a tight network

of tortuous intergranular microfissures with 1 to 2 µm

aperture (Fig. 3G) that follows grain boundaries. In sam-

ple D, long linear transgranular microfissures with 2.5

to 9 µm aperture (average 4 µm) predominates over

all rock forming minerals, commonly connected with

a network of intragranular microfissures, besides minor

amounts of intergranular ones are locally observed.

minerals and filling of microfissures is characteristic for

samples C and D, which allows the observation of ample

areas with variable grey levels (and consequently poros-

ity) on autoradiographies. It is represented mainly by

the following secondary features:

(a) pseudomorphic replacement of original mafic min-

erals for chlorite (Fig. 3H) and sericite (± calcite).
These minerals are associated to low grey level

(high porosity) areas on autoradiographies and

shows wider porosity paths in open cleavages (up

to 12 µm aperture) than in samples A and B. They

are locally aligned or in clusters that can form rims

around feldspar grains;

(b) destabilization of ilmenite (Fig. 3I), generate high

porosity sites (up to 4 µm aperture) mainly in the

core of the crystals, which corresponds to dark

zones on the autoradiography;

(c) micro inclusions of hematite (Fig. 3J) or very fine

grained chlorite ± sericite ± calcite crystallization
mark commonly the compositional zoning of mag-

matic alkali feldspars which correspond to medium

grey level intensity on autoradiography. These sec-

ondary phases were observed in either the border or

the core of feldspar grains as patches or over perthite

exsolution structures;

(d) calcite veinlets (Fig. 3K) with up to 150 µm width

and very fine grained chlorite crystallized through

infillings of microfissures (Fig. 3L) represent the al-

teration minerals in longer linear transgranular and

in tortuous inter and intragranular porosity respec-

tively;

(e) mafic microgranular enclaves (MME) were ob-

served only locally on sample C. They are com-

pletely altered to chlorite ± sericite ± calcite and
represents highly altered and porous zones. When

present, these petrographic sites increase the poros-

ity of the analyzed surface and comparison between

original rock porosity would have no significance.

For that reason, zones containing MME were ex-

cluded from total porosity quantification of that

sample.

MINERALOGY OF QUANTIFIED AREAS AFTER STAINING

The main rock-forming minerals observed in the stud-

ied samples were quartz, alkali feldspar, plagioclase and

mafic minerals (amphibole and biotite). The mafic min-

eral contents calculated on binary (black and white) im-

ages of selected areas from samples A and B obtained

after digital threshold of stained surfaces are 7.4% and

3.5% respectively (Fig. 4). Quantification of mafic min-

eral contents in altered samples by staining were not

used, however they have similar values between por-

phyritic (A and D, ?7%) and equigranular (B and C,
?4%) samples. Tectosilicate contents (%) are Qz = 28.1
and KF = 64.5 for sample A and Qz = 27.3, KF = 58.2

and Pl = 11 for sample B.

POROSITY QUANTIFICATION

Total rock porosity of each sample was calculated using

the Autoradio© software. In the image generated dur-

ing total rock porosity calculation (Fig. 5A–D), small

red points correspond to zones with very low porosity

(near null) that were not computed. The correspond-

ing total rock porosity map (Fig. 5A’–D’) is obtained

after transformation of the logarithmic ratio grey level of

autoradiographies to a linear one, which is visually an

easier way to compare between different porosity values

in selected areas of the samples. However, this process

of transformation generates an image with inverse tonal-

ity, when compared to the autoradiography, i.e. in this

case, black represent the lowest porosity areas and white

the highest porosity ones.

rock surfaces are 0.5% for sample A, 0.6% for sample B,

1.7% for sample C and 1.8% for sample D. The poros-

ity histograms of rocks represented in a log-linear scale

(Fig. 6) show similarities between samples with the

same textural characteristics (porphyritic or equigranu-

lar). Images from samples A and D have the highest

quantity of pixels with 0.25% porosity and samples B

and C with 0.35% porosity respectively. Porosity curves

increases up to 4% for unaltered rocks and up to 10%

for altered rocks.

Microfissure sites from samples A and B shows 1.5

to 5.5% porosity, using a 3 pixel width for porosity pro-

files. The same sites from samples C and D can reach

The mineral-specific porosity in all samples was es-

timated on the autoradiographies using rectangular areas

with homogeneous grey-level zones in each identified

mineral phase. It shows constant values between 0.2 to

0.4% for quartz and alkali feldspar in all samples. Av-

erage of mineral porosity in samples A and B was 1 to

1.8% for amphibole, 1.7 to 2% for biotite and 12% for

accessory minerals (zircon and monazite). In samples

C and D mineral sites shows porosity values up to 4.5%

for calcite altering mafic minerals or feldspars, 4 to 7%

for sericite + chlorite + calcite altering mafic minerals,

8% for oxide + very fine grained chlorite crystallized

over feldspars, 1.5 to 5% for sericitization of feldspars,

8% for destabilized ilmenite and 14% for altered micro-

granular mafic enclaves.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Natural microcracks in granitic rocks are commonly as-

sociated to (i) thermal contraction during cooling, (ii)

stress relaxation during uplift or unroofing and (iii) tec-

tonic deformation (Kowallis and Wang 1983). No tec-

tonic deformation was visually recognized near sam-

pling locations during fieldwork, however infillings of

secondary veinlets can generate additional microcracks

in propylitic-altered rocks.
14C-PMMA porosity results of total rock calcula-

tions were compared with data obtained by the same

method on granitic rocks worldwide. Unaltered, fairly

and strongly altered granitic rocks show commonly 0.1

to 0.5%, 0.4 to 1% and 1 to 5% porosity respectively

(Siitari-Kauppi et al. 1997, Hölttä et al. 1997, Johans-

son et al. 1998). Consequently, the obtained data on

unaltered (0.5% to 0.6%) and propylitic-altered (1.7%

to 1.8%) granitic samples from Lavras do Sul region are

in agreement with the range of porosity values for simi-

lar rocks reported by other authors (Sardini et al. 2006).

Results of total rock porosity between unaltered

rocks (A and B) are quite similar, if we take into account

that sample B (inactive quarry) was exposed to surface

alteration for a longer period of time (up to 50 years)

than sample A (borehole). However, slightly differences

in the weathering and the slight propylitic alteration be-

tween unaltered samples are possible. Surface exposition

through time yields a low increase in total rock porosity

as argued by other authors (Guillot et al. 2000, Thuro

and Scholz 2003, Iñigo et al. 2000).

Some textural aspects between unaltered rocks

could enable different values for the measured porosity.

Porphyritic rocks from central facies have intergranular

microfissures (allowed by the fine grained matrix) with

high tortuosity that is not well developed in equigranular

rocks from border facies. High tortuosity and constric-

tivity are commonly interpreted as longer pathways to

fluid flows. The effect of trans- and intragranular mi-

crofissures with low tortuosity and low constrictivity in

both textural rocks seems to prevail over narrow and tor-

tuous intergranular ones. As observed in the obtained

data, those different textural characteristics seem to have

no effective influence on the fluid flow through very low

porosity media as unaltered granitic rocks. Moreover,

slight increase of the measured total porosity of sam-

ple B is expected due to its higher contents of accessory

minerals (zircon and monazite), which contain radioac-

tive elements excited during sample irradiation. Con-

cerning mafic minerals, amphibole predominates largely

over biotite. These grains are in general well preserved

and differences of mafic mineral contents or extension

of surface areas (in clusters or as single grains) between

samples do not modify their connected (total) porosity

value. Total porosity histogram for these rocks is com-

patible with specific porosity of individual sites, which

shows predominance of up to 4% porosity. The range of

porosity values for mafic minerals increases linearly with

open cleavages, intragranular microfissures and chloriti-

zation contents of these petrographic sites.

The main difference between samples C and D com-

prises also the rock texture. Both samples were collected

in the same depth (borehole) and for that reason they

were exposed to identical events of primary and sec-

ondary porosity formation (i.e. microcrack evolution,

hydrothermal alteration and weathering). As for unal-

tered rocks, the occurrence of intergranular microfis-

sures did not allowed high variations in the measured

porosity between samples C and D (1.7 and 1.8%). His-

tograms of total porosity have higher maximal values

than for unaltered rocks, and porosity values vary up to

10%. These data agree with porosity calculated for indi-

vidual petrographic sites. Opened cleavages, carbonate

and chlorite veinlets and diffuse alteration (chloritization,

sericitization) of original minerals allow an effective in-

crease in total porosity of these samples in comparison

to values obtained for unaltered rocks.

From the bulk results we can consider the follow-

ing aspects:

• spatial distribution of porosity values is dependent

on the mineralogy (either primary or secondary), as

reported in previous papers (Oila et al. 2005, Sar-

dini et al. 2006);

• variable porosity values within a single mineral

grain is dependent on its alteration degree or imper-

fect development of crystal growth;

• undeformed quartz and unaltered alkali feldspar

have null to very weak porosity values and felds-

par sericitization (weathered or hydrothermal) in-

creases its porosity and total porosity of rocks;

• cleavage (mafic minerals), grain boundaries, com-

positional zonation (rapakivi, perthite), micro-

cracks, degree of alteration and accessory miner-

als with radioactive elements are representative of

distinct porosity values;

• high mafic mineral contents and clusters increase

conditions to form secondary porosity if they are

previously altered or fractured.

The results obtained in this study shows that original

porosity of granitic rocks with different textures (sam-

ples A and B) have no significant influence on the dif-

ferences of diffusion (width) of later phyllic alteration

halos around veins observed during field works between

central and border facies granitoids.

Secondary porosity represented by propylitic-al-

tered rocks (samples C and D) has higher porosity val-

ues either in total or specific mineral quantifications be-

tween different rock textures. Propylitic alteration com-

monly develops in response to low water/rock ratio in

ample areas of hydrothermal systems (Berger and Velde

1992, Titley 1982) and phyllic alteration, on the con-

trary, needs high fluid/rock ratio in narrow zones of ac-

tive fluid flow (fractures, veins) to develop.

Early and widespread propylitic alteration in the

studied area may have provided additional porosity for

rocks due to fluid interaction (Holl et al. 1997) through

cleavage plans, microcracks and secondary minerals

of higher porosity prior to phyllic alteration stage near

quartz veins, but the variability of diffusion width ob-

served on alteration halos between granitic facies might

be produced during phyllic alteration. If true, central

and border facies were influenced by different fluid/rock

ratio or fluid composition during phyllic alteration stage.

That hypothesis must also consider variations in the

hydrothermal products, timing between granitic facies

emplacement and/or paleoenvironment of rocks (depth,

superimposing alteration stages, tectonic deformation

and location within the granitic body). Moreover, micro-

granular mafic enclaves (MME) commonly found in the

border facies are also highly porous zones that if present

can locally contribute to increase the hydrothermal fluid

diffusion.

The 14C-polymethylmethacrylate (14C-PMMA) im-

pregnation method, coupled with petrographic (optical

and through SEM) observations and digital image pro-

cessing provides a valuable methodology to identify and

quantify the porosity heterogeneities in hydrothermally

altered rocks and specific minerals. The modeling of

fluid flows and evolution of porosity in different stages

during hydrothermal alteration is also possible. The

initial porosity (fairly altered, unaltered) and porosity

generated during early alteration stages (propylitic) of

these granitic rocks obtained by the 14C-PMMA method

should be compared with other hydrothermal stages/

environments (phyllic alteration, around vein selvages)

within the same locations to test the observation of por-

osity evolution until its final stages. The recognition and

quantification of the connective network and of alter-

ation products observed in this study can be also used as

a data basis for calculation of mass balance of alteration.

RESUMO

Este trabalho é uma aplicação do método 14C-polimetilmeta-

crilato na comparação da evolução da porosidade entre granitos

não alterados e propilitizados, utilizando amostras da região

de Lavras do Sul, Brasil. Este método, quando associado a

análises por petrografia ótica, eletrônica e processamento digi-

tal de imagens tem a vantagem de fornecer, além da porosidade

total, a quantificação e identificação da porosidade em locais

específicos das rochas. A partir da petrografia foi possível iden-

tificar e quantificar os diferentes tipos de poros presentes nas

rochas (microfraturas, limites de grãos, alteração de minerais,

etc). Os resultados mostram que granitos não alterados têm

porosidade de 0,5 a 0,6% e granitos propilitizados 1,7 a 1,8%,

com valores semelhantes para rochas de texturas diferentes.

A porosidade das rochas alteradas aumenta, principalmente,

devido à maior porosidade dos minerais neoformados como

clorita, calcita e sericita e de microfraturas. Observações de

campo mostram que halos de alteração fílica, posteriores à

propilitização, são maiores em rochas equigranulares do que

em porfiríticas, o que não pode ser explicado pelo valor seme-

lhante da porosidade original dessas rochas. A difusão diferen-

cial da alteração fílica foi, portanto, condicionada por variações

estruturais ou da razão fluido/rocha entre as facies equigranular

e porfirítica durante este estágio hidrotermal posterior.
