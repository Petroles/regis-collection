ABSTRACT 
 
This work investigated the possibility of using vinasse as an amendment in ex-situ bioremediation processes. 
Groundwater and soil samples were collected at petrol stations. The soil bioremediation was simulated in Bartha 
biometer flasks, used to measure the microbial CO2 production, during 48 days, where vinasse was added at a 
concentration of 33 mL.Kg-1 of soil. Biodegradation efficiency was also measured by quantifying the total petroleum 
hydrocarbons (TPH) by gas chromatography. The groundwater bioremediation was carried out in laboratory 
experiments simulating aerated (bioreactors) and not aerated (BOD flasks) conditions. In both the cases, the 
concentration of vinasse was 5 % (v/v) and different physicochemical parameters were evaluated during 20 days. 
Although an increase in the soil fertility and microbial population were obtained with the vinasse, it demonstrated 
not to be adequate to enhance the bioremediation efficiency of diesel oil contaminated soils. The addition of the 
vinasse in the contaminated groundwaters had negative effects on the biodegradation of the hydrocarbons, since 
vinasse, as a labile carbon source, was preferentially consumed.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Vinasse is a byproduct of the alcohol distillation 
process, whose disposal represents a major 
environmental concern mainly due to the great 
volume generated and its high biological oxygen 
demand. In general, to produce one liter of 
alcohol, 10 to 15 liters of vinasse are produced, 
depending on cane quality and the industrial 
process (Cortez et al., 1992), which corresponds to 
approximately 170 billion liters per year of this 

residue in Brazil (Agrianual, 2004). Considering 
that every two liters of vinasse is equivalent to the 
domestic sewage generated by one person per day 
(Lukssemberg et al., 1980 apud Gonçalves and 
Silva, 2000), the annual production of vinasse 
corresponds to the domestic sewage produced by 
an estimate population of 232 million people 
during one year. 
This residue is a light-brown liquid consisting 
basically of water (93 %), organic solids and 
minerals (7 %). Its chemical composition is

variable, depending, among other factors, on water 
availability, sugar-cane characteristics and the 
fermentation and distillation processes employed 
(Ferraz et al., 1986). In general, vinasse presents 
high turbidity and low pH, with high levels of 
organic matter (mainly glycerol, a soluble carbon 
source), potassium, calcium and moderate amounts 
of nitrogen and phosphorus (Rodella et al., 1983; 
Tauk, 1987; Gómez and Rodríguez, 2000). 
In Brazil, it is very common to dispose the vinasse 
in agricultural fields, a process called ferti-
irrigation, as a partial or total substitute for mineral 
fertilizers, mainly potassium. This idea is a more 
environmental friendly option than the previous 
disposal, when vinasse was discharged in rivers 
nearby the usines, and had a good acceptance by 
the distilleries due to its technical simplicity and 
economic advantages (Corazza, 1999).  In São 
Paulo State, where the majority of the sugar cane 
fields is located, this agricultural procedure is 
controlled by a specific legislation that determines 
how to calculate the vinasse dosage (Cetesb, 
2005b). Vinasse addition at adequate rates has 
demonstrated to increase sugar cane production. 
However, in a long term, the intensive application 
of vinasse can increase the soil salinity (Corazza, 
1999), affect the sugar cane quality and 
contaminate the groundwater (Gonçalves and 
Silva, 2000). Some works have shown that vinasse 
can modify temporarily some soil chemical and 
biological characteristics, such as pH, organic 
carbon, changeable acidity (Camargo et al., 1987) 
and the microbial activity and biomass (Minhoni 
and Cerri, 1987). Ramalho and Sobrinho (2001) 
observed that the use of vinasse in large scale did 
not alter significantly the heavy metals 
concentration in soil. Fontes (1988), Cardoso 
(1988) and Itamar (1987) observed that vinasse 
increased the concentrations of calcium, 
magnesium, organic matter and mainly potassium, 
causing an elevation of the soil electrical 
conductivity. 
Considering that the ethanol production in Brazil 
is in expansion due to a rising internal and world-
wide demand for alternative energy sources and 
that soils have a limited support capability to 
receive the vinasse, there is a need for alternative 
methods to treat or re-use the vinasse. Corazza 
(1999) described alternative technologies where 
the vinasse could be recycled in the fermentation 
process, treated in anaerobic reactors, or used to 
produce yeast, animal food and employed in the 
civil construction.  In relation to the use of vinasse 

as an amendment to the biodegradation of 
pollutants, Prata et al. (2001) evaluated the effects 
of vinasse on the degradation and sorption of the 
herbicide ametryne. The vinasse addition 
increased the microbial activity and the 
degradation of ametryne, and the sorption was not 
affected. Crivelaro (2005) reported an increase in 
the microbial population, mainly fungi, when 
studying the use of vinasse as an amendment to 
accelerate the biodegradation of oily sludge in soil. 
Aiming to offer an alternative of destination for 
the vinasse, this work investigated the possibility 
of using vinasse as an amendment in ex-situ 
bioremediation processes by supplying the 
nutrients and as an extra labile carbon source that 
could increase the microorganisms population. As 
vinasse represents a potential source of pollution, 
ex-situ treatments are preferable since controlled 
processes minimize any risk of additional 
contamination due to the vinasse.  

 
 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Vinasse characteristics 
Vinasse was collected at the Santa Lúcia usine 
(Araras-SP, Brazil) and stored frozen until its use. 
The physicochemical analyses described in Table 
1 were performed by Icasa laboratory (Instituto 
Campineiro de Análise de Solo e Adubo – Icasa), 
according to the methodology proposed by 
Embrapa (1997), and the following parameters: 
dissolved oxygen (DO) (Digimed DM4), chemical 
oxygen demand (COD) (Cetesb, 1994), redox 
potential (Eh) (Hanna HI 8314) and conductivity 
(Analion C-701, electrode Analion C 801-1) were 
determined at Unesp (Rio Claro-SP, Brazil). 
 
Soil respirometric test 
Soil samples were collected at three petrol 
stations. At the petrol stations ASP and SB, diesel 
oil spills occurred from underground storage tanks 
approximately ten years ago and samples were 
contaminated with diesel oil. At these locations, 
samples were collected from the capillary fringe 
(depth: ASP - 1.60 m; SB - 2.60 m). At the third 
petrol station (RC), the sample was collected at 
0.50 m during the replacement of underground 
pipes. This sample showed low level of 
contamination by unknown fuel, possibly due to 
leaks in the pipes and ground infiltrations. Until 
performing the biodegradation experiments,

samples were stored at 5 oC. Table 2 summarizes 
some physicochemical characteristics of these soil 
samples. Values of heavy metals concentrations 
were not above the more restricted levels set by 
the Cetesb (São Paulo Environmental Agency - 
Brazil) and by the Dutch list (Cetesb, 2005a). 
The physicochemical analyses were performed by 
Icasa laboratory according to the methodology 
proposed by Embrapa (1997), except the following 
parameters: total nitrogen (laboratory 

“PIRASOLO – Laboratório Agrotécnico 
Piracicaba”, according to Embrapa (1997)); grain 
size distribution (ABNT, 1984) and the moisture 
content (obtained by the oven drying method). 
Determination of the total petroleum hydrocarbons 
(TPH) content was carried out by the “Analytical 
Technology” laboratory by gas chromatography 
with the flame ionization detector (FID) according 
to the US Environmental Protection Agency 
(USEPA) methodology SW-846/8015.

In order to verify the influence of the 
bioaugmentation technique in the biodegradation 
of diesel oil, batch biodegradation experiments (48 
days) were carried out in Bartha biometer flasks 
(250 mL) used to measure the microbial CO2 
production (Bartha and Pramer, 1965; Régis and 
Bidoia, 2005; Inazaki et al., 2004; Mariano et al., 
2007a). Mineralization studies involving 
measurements of total CO2 production can provide 
excellent information on the biodegradability 
potential of hydrocarbons (Balba et al., 1998). 
The experiments were divided into two parts 
described in Table 3. In the first one, a diesel oil 

contamination of the RC soil was simulated by 
adding diesel oil purchased from a local petrol 
station or a weathered diesel oil collected from the 
groundwater at ASP petrol station (6 mg.Kg-1 of 
soil). In the second part, experiments with ASP 
and SB soils were carried out. For both the parts, 
vinasse was added at a concentration of 33  
mL.Kg-1 of soil, which changed the water content 
of the soils to 11.9 (RC), 19.0 (ASP) and 19.0 % 
(SB). In the treatments where vinasse was not 
added (controls), the water content was corrected 
in relation to the other treatments by adding 
distilled water.

For each experimental condition, the biometer 
flasks were prepared in triplicates (3 x 50 g of soil) 
and incubated at 27 oC in the dark. The CO2 
produced was trapped in a 10.0 mL solution of 
KOH (0.2 N), located in the side-arm of the 
biometer. This solution was periodically 
withdrawn by syringe, and the amount of carbon 
dioxide absorbed was then measured by titrating 
the residual KOH (after the addition of barium 
chloride solution (1 mL; 1.0 N) used to precipitate 
the carbonate ions) with a standard solution of HCl 
(0.1 N). During this procedure, the biometers were 
aerated during 1.5 minute through the ascarite 
filters. 
At the end of the experiments, replicates of each 
treatment were thoroughly mixed together for 
physicochemical and microbiological analyses. 
Total heterotrophic bacteria were counted by using 
the pour plate technique on plate count agar 
(Acumedia, USA). Plate count of the bacterial soil 
population was performed as follows: samples of 1 
g of soil were added to 9 mL of 0.85 % sterile 
saline solution in test tubes and agitated 
mechanically for 2 minutes. After appropriate 
serial dilutions, 1 mL of the suspension were 
spread over the surface of duplicate petri dishes 

and incubated at 35 oC for 48 h. The total 
heterotrophic bacteria count was carried out at the 
beginning and at end of the respirometric 
experiments. 
 
Groundwater experiments 
Groundwater samples were collected at petrol 
stations ASP and SB (Mariano et al., 2007b) and 
stored at 5 oC until the biodegradation experiments 
were performed. In order to verify the influence of 
the addition of vinasse in the biodegradation of the 
diesel oil present in the groundwater, two 
biodegradation experiments were set up. The first 
was carried out in BOD flasks (300 mL) that were 
incubated in the dark during 20 days at 20.0±0.2 
oC. Treatments with vinasse were compared to a 
standard bioremediation technique, the addition of 
nutrients, where the nitrogen and phosphorus 
correction was performed using solutions of 
(NH4)2SO4 and KH2PO4, respectively. Table 4 
summarizes the experimental conditions. To 
provide the same conditions to the treatments 
without vinasse, 5 % of the reacting medium 
volume corresponds to distillate water.  
For each treatment, six BOD flasks were prepared 
and the following measurements were carried out

at intervals of 0, 5, 10 and 20 days: dissolved 
oxygen (DO) (Digimed DM4); pH (Analion 
IA601); redox potential (Eh) (Hanna HI 8314); 
conductivity (Analion C-701, electrode Analion C 
801-1); chemical oxygen demand (COD) (Cetesb, 
1994); potassium and nitrate ions concentration 
(Hach DR 2000); BTEX (benzene, toluene, 
ethylbenzene and xylenes) and PAH (polyaromatic 
hydrocarbons) concentrations, being the latter only 
at initial and final times. At the mentioned 
intervals, for each treatment, the DO was 
measured in two flasks and then they were mixed 
together and appropriate aliquots for each analysis 
were withdrawn. 

The BTEX and PAH analyses were performed by 
“Laboratório de Química Ambiental (IQSC-USP)” 
according to the USEPA methodologies 8015 and 
8270, respectively. 
The second biodegradation experiment with the 
groundwater was carried out in four aerated 
bioreactors (900 mL), whose experimental 
conditions are listed in Table 5. To provide the 
same conditions to the treatments without vinasse, 
5 % of the reacting medium volume corresponded 
to distilled water. At the same intervals of the first 
biodegradation experiment, the BTEX 
concentration was measured. The chemical oxygen 
demand (COD) and the PAH concentration were 
determined only at initial and final times.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Soil respirometric test 
The daily CO2 productions in the respirometric 
experiments are represented in Figures 1 to 5, 
where each error bar represents 1 SD (standard 
deviation) of three replicates. The evolution of the 
CO2 production in treatment 2 (Fig. 1) showed that 
the vinasse was almost totally biodegraded in 

approximately 20 days after being applied to RC 
soil (without addition of diesel oil). When 
considering the experiments with contaminated 
soils (Fig. 2 to 5), a similar behavior was 
observed, i.e. the CO2 production in experiments 
with vinasse initially differentiated from the 
controls and after similar period, it decreased until 
reaching values next to the controls.

Figure 5 - CO2 production during incubation of treatments 9 (SB soil) and 10 (SB soil + vinasse). 
 
 
 

The total heterotrophic bacteria counts at initial 
and final times of incubation (Fig. 6) showed that 
in the treatments with vinasse, the bacterial 
population was higher at the final time than in the 
controls. This increase in the soil microbial 
population caused by the vinasse has also been 
reported by Prata et al. (2001) and Crivelaro 
(2005) in their biodegradation experiments. 
However, as observed by Hickman and Novak 
(1989), the total microbial biomass could be a poor 
predictor for determining biodegradation potential, 
mainly because the active biomass could differ in 
species composition and in metabolic regimes. 
Certainly these additional microorganisms 
preferentially biodegraded the more labile carbon 

sources as the glycerol present in the vinasse 
(Rodella et al., 1983; Prata et al., 2001); otherwise, 
a marked decrease in the CO2 production after the 
consumption of the vinasse would not be 
observed. Moreover, there was practically no 
difference in the biodegradation efficiencies in 
terms of concentrations of hydrocarbons between 
the treatments (RC and ASP soils) with the 
addition of vinasse and the controls (Table 6). The 
results with SB soil, where the biodegradation 
efficiency was clearly superior in the control, 
indicated that the preferential consumption of the 
vinasse could also delay the bioremediation 
process.

Table 7 shows the values of pH and concentrations 
of organic matter, nitrogen and potassium at the 
initial and final times of experiments. Comparing 
the treatments with the addition of vinasse to their 
controls, the values of pH were practically not 
altered; the organic matter, nitrogen (only in RC 
soil) and potassium contents increased with the 

addition of vinasse. The potassium concentration 
in the soil and its cation exchange capacity are the 
parameters used to calculate the vinasse dosage to 
be applied in agricultural fields according to the 
Brazilian legislation (Cetesb, 2005b), since this 
residue has a high concentration of this element.

In general, the treatments with addition of 
nutrients had similar behavior in relation to 
controls, except for the dissolved oxygen that was 
more consumed in the former, indicating an 
intensification of the biodegradation rates. It was 
possible to observe that with the addition of the 
vinasse, there were a series of inhibitory factors in 

the biodegradation efficiency: values of pH under 
5 (Corseuil &amp;amp; Alvarez, 1996); the treatments 
rapidly achieved anaerobic condition (indicated by 
the nearly total depletion of the dissolved oxygen 
and negative values of potential redox) due to the 
great amount of organic matter present in the 
vinasse, which caused a large increase in the 
chemical oxygen demand; a conductivity rise 
related to the high concentration of dissolved salts 
in the vinasse, mainly potassium. The vinasse also

caused an increase in the concentration of nitrate 
above the limit (10 mg.L-1) determined by the 
Brazilian legislation on drinkable waters for public 
use (Portaria n.518/2004 MS). 
In terms of concentration of the hydrocarbons 
BTEX (Table 9), the remaining concentrations 
mainly of xylenes, the more recalcitrant ones 

(Kaplan et al., 1997), showed that the treatments 
with vinasse had the worst performances. Most of 
the values of concentrations of the poliaromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAH) were under the detection 
limit, for this reason, it was not possible to identify 
any influence of the treatments in the 
biodegradation of these hydrocarbons.

The previous results showed that the high 
concentration of organic matter in the vinasse 
caused a rapid consumption of the dissolved 
oxygen in the groundwater. Thus, aiming to 
overcome this process deficiency, the second 
biodegradation experiment was based on an 
aerated system. The results obtained with the 
aerated bioreactors are shown in Tables 10 and 11. 
Treatments with vinasse had a better performance 
in terms of reduction of the chemical oxygen 
demand (COD) (Table 10). However, the final 
values were still very high (up to 40 times in 

relation to the controls), indicating that even in 20 
days the vinasse was not totally biodegraded. 
Similarly to the BOD flasks experiment, the 
addition of vinasse had a negative influence on the 
biodegradation of the hydrocarbons, as suggested 
by the final concentrations of benzene (ASP) and 
xylenes (ASP and SB) (Table 11). No influence of 
the vinasse in the concentration of the 
polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) could be 
identified, since most of these values were under 
the detection limit.

CONCLUSIONS 
 
Although an increase in the soil fertility and 
microbial population were obtained with the 
vinasse, it demonstrated not to be adequate to 
enhance the bioremediation efficiency of diesel oil 
contaminated soils. The addition of the vinasse in 
the contaminated groundwaters had negative 
effects on the biodegradation of the hydrocarbons, 
since vinasse, as a labile carbon source, was 
preferentially consumed. Thus, the use of vinasse 
as an amendment to ex-situ bioremediation 
processes showed not to be efficient in the studied 
conditions.

RESUMO 
 

Este trabalho investigou a possibilidade de se usar 
a vinhaça como um agente estimulador de 
processos de biorremediação ex-situ. Amostras de 
água subterrânea e solo foram coletadas em três 
postos de combustíveis. A biorremediação do solo 

foi simulada em frascos de Bartha, usados para 
medir a produção de CO2, durante 48 dias, onde a 
vinhaça foi adicionada a uma concentração de 33 
mL.Kg-1 de solo. A eficiência de biodegradação 
também foi medida pela quantificação de 
hidrocarbonetos totais de petróleo (TPH) por 
cromatografia gasosa. A biorremediação da água 
subterrânea foi realizada em experimentos 
laboratoriais simulando condições aeradas 
(bioreatores) e não aeradas (frascos de DBO). Em 
ambos os casos, a concentração de vinhaça foi de 
5 % (v/v) e diferentes parâmetros físico-químicos 
foram avaliados durante 20 dias. Embora um 
aumento da fertilização e da população microbiana 
do solo foram obtidos com a vinhaça, esta 
estratégia não se mostrou adequada em aumentar a 
eficiência da biorremediação dos solos 
contaminados com óleo diesel. A adição de 
vinhaça às águas subterrâneas contaminadas teve 
efeitos negativos na biodegradação dos 
hidrocarbonetos, uma vez que a vinhaça, como 
uma fonte de carbono facilmente assimilável, foi 
preferencialmente consumida.
