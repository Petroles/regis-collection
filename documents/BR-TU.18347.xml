Resumo 
 
 

Durante o século passado, as temperaturas globais médias têm vindo a aumentar. De 
acordo com as previsões, a mudança de temperatura deverá ser superior a 1,5ºC neste 
século e o aquecimento é provável que continue. Os ecossistemas de água doce estão 
entre os mais sensíveis, principalmente devido às mudanças no ciclo hidrológico e, 
consequentemente, em diversos parâmetros físico-químicos (ex. pH, oxigénio 
dissolvido). Alterações nos parâmetros abióticos de ambientes de água doce irão 
provavelmente afectar a distribuição, morfologia, fisiologia e riqueza de uma ampla 
gama de espécies levando a mudanças importantes na biodiversidade e funcionamento 
do ecossistema. Para além disto, eles também podem atuar como co-estressores em 
ambientes onde os organismos já tem que lidar com contaminação química. Portanto, o 
objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar os efeitos de parâmetros ambientais sobre a 
toxicidade dos pesticidas para embriões de peixe-zebra. Foram estudados os seguintes 
fatores ambientais: pH  (3,0-12,0), nível de oxigénio dissolvido (0-8 mg/L) e radiação UV 
(0-500 mW/m2). Os pesticidas estudados foram o inseticida carbamato carbaril e o 
fungicida benzimidazólico carbendazim. Ambos os estressores (fatores ambientais e 
pesticidas) foram testados separadamente a fim de obter curvas dose-resposta para 
estudar mais profundamente os efeitos combinados de estressores ambientais e 
toxicidade química, aplicando modelos de mistura. A caracterização das respostas do 
peixe-zebra ao estresse ambiental mostrou que os efeitos do pH foram totalmente 
estabelecidas após 24 h de exposição e a sobrevivência foi só afetada a valores de pH 
abaixo de 5 e acima 10. Os níveis reduzidos de oxigénio também afetaram o 
desenvolvimento dos embriões em concentrações abaixo de 4 mg/L (atraso, redução 
dos batimentos cardíacos e edema) e em concentrações abaixo de 0.5 mg/L a 
sobrevivência foi drasticamente reduzida. A exposição contínua a radiações UV 
mostrou um forte efeito dependente do tempo na sobrevivência dos embriões levando a 
100% de mortalidade no final do ensaio. A toxicidade dos pesticidas carbaril e 
carbendazim foi caracterizada em vários níveis de organização biológica, incluindo 
desenvolvimento, biomarcadores e comportamental, permitindo uma compreensão 
mecanicista dos efeitos e destacando a utilidade de respostas comportamentais 
(locomoção) como um parâmetro sensível em ecotoxicologia. 
Uma vez que as curvas dose resposta para cada estressor foram estabelecidas, um 
estudo de toxicidade combinado foi realizado para avaliar os efeitos do pH sobre a
toxicidade do carbaril. 
Os resultados mostraram que o pH pode modificar a toxicidade do pesticida carbaryl. O 
modelo conceitual de adição da concentração permitiu uma previsão precisa da 
toxicidade dos efeitos conjuntos do pH ácido e carbaril. No entanto, para a condição 
alcalina ambos os conceitos falharam na previsão dos efeitos. Os desvios ao modelo 
foram no entanto fáceis de explicar uma vez que os valores de pH elevados
favoreceram a hidrólise do carbaril com a consequente formação de um produto de 
degradação mais tóxico 1-naftol. Embora no presente estudo tal processo explicativo foi 
fácil de estabelecer, para muitas outras combinações de natureza "interativa" talvez 
esse processo não seja tão evidente. No contexto das alterações climáticas poucos 
cenários preveem um aumento tão elevado do pH de sistemas aquáticos, no entanto, 
esta pode ser considerada uma primeira abordagem focada apenas nos efeitos letais. 
Numa segunda avaliação, efeitos ao nível sub-letal seriam recomendados uma vez que 
espera-se que mudanças mais sutis de pH (mais realistas em termos de cenários de 
mudanças climáticas) possam ter um efeito em níveis fisiológicos e bioquímicos, com 
possíveis consequências a longo prazo para o fitness das populações.

Abstract 
 

During the last century mean global temperatures have been increasing. According to 
the predictions, the temperature change is expected to exceed 1.5ºC in this century and 
the warming is likely to continue. Freshwater ecosystems are among the most sensitive 
mainly due to changes in the hydrologic cycle and consequently changes in several 
physico-chemical parameters (e.g. pH, dissolved oxygen). Alterations in environmental 
parameters of freshwater systems are likely to affect distribution, morphology, physiology 
and richness of a wide range of species leading to important changes in ecosystem 
biodiversity and function. Moreover, they can also work as co-stressors in environments 
where organisms have already to cope with chemical contamination (such as 
pesticides), increasing the environmental risk due to potential interactions. Therefore, the 
objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of climate change related 
environmental parameters on the toxicity of pesticides to zebrafish embryos. The 
following environmental factors were studied: pH (3.0-12.0), dissolved oxygen level (0-8 
mg/L) and UV radiation (0-500 mW/m2). The pesticides studied were the carbamate 
insecticide carbaryl and the benzimidazole fungicide carbendazim. Stressors were firstly 
tested separately in order to derive concentration- or intensity-response curves to further 
study the effects of binary combinations (environmental factors x pesticides) by applying 
mixture models. Characterization of zebrafish embryos response to environmental stress 
revealed that pH effects were fully established after 24 h of exposure and survival was 
only affected at pH values below 5 and above 10. Low oxygen levels also affected 
embryos development at concentrations below 4 mg/L (delay, heart rate decrease and 
edema), and at concentrations below 0.5 mg/L the survival was drastically reduced. 
Continuous exposure to UV radiation showed a strong time-dependent impact on 
embryos survival leading to 100% of mortality after 72 hours of exposure. The toxicity of 
pesticides carbaryl and carbendazim was characterized at several levels of biological 
organization including developmental, biochemical and behavioural allowing a 
mechanistic understanding of the effects and highlighting the usefulness of behavioural 
responses (locomotion) as a sensitive endpoint in ecotoxicology. 
Once the individual concentration response relationship of each stressor was 
established, a combined toxicity study was conducted to evaluate the effects of pH on 
the toxicity of carbaryl.  
We have shown that pH can modify the toxicity of the pesticide carbaryl. The conceptual 
model concentration addition allowed a precise prediction of the toxicity of the joint-
effects of acid pH and carbaryl. Nevertheless, for alkaline condition both concepts failed 
in predicting the effects. Deviations to the model were however easy to explain as high 
pH values favour the hydrolysis of carbaryl with the consequent formation of the more 
toxic degradation product 1- naphtol. Although in the present study such explanatory 
process was easy to establish, for many other combinations the “interactive” nature is 
not so evident. In the context of the climate change few scenarios predict such increase 
in the pH of aquatic systems, however this was a first approach focused in the lethal 
effects only. In a second tier assessment effects at sublethal level would be sought and it 
is expectable that more subtle pH changes (more realistic in terms of climate changes 
scenarios) may have an effect at physiological and biochemical levels with possible long 
term consequences for the population fitness.

1. General Introduction 

1.1 Contextualization 

 

Strong scientific evidences have demonstrated that global climate is changing and 

in some extent responsibilities can be attributed to human activities. The warming 

observed since the mid-20th century is mainly due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas 

emissions (GHG), such as carbon dioxide and methane. Despite the effort to reduce 

emissions, GHG have largely increased between 2000 and 2010 (IPCC, 2014). The most 

recent assessment report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2014) 

indicated that the last three decades were the warmest at the Earth’s surface since 1850. 

Moreover, the warming is predicted to continue beyond the 21st century in all scenarios 

and the temperature increase may reach 4.8 ºC. Changes in climate have caused impacts on 

human and natural systems in recent decades with strongest impacts on natural systems. 

Fig.1 summarizes the impacts of climate change on natural and human systems based on 

available scientific publication from 2001 to 2010. As can be observed, the impacts of 

climate change are strongest and most comprehensive for natural systems. Changes in 

precipitation or melting snow and ice for instance may affect quantity and quality of water 

resources (IPCC, 2014). 

Aquatic ecosystems are particularly susceptible to climate change because of their 

strong dependence on precipitation and hydrologic cycles (Allan et al., 2005). These 

processes affect not only the quantity of water but also its quality. Indeed, recent studies 

emphasized the relationship of climatic and hydrological parameters to surface water 

quality. For instance, a negative correlation between climate related parameters such as 

precipitation, evaporation, air temperatures, water level and discharge flow and 

modifications in Dissolved Oxygen (DO), pH and conductivity was found in the Mekong 

River (Prathumratana et al., 2008). In addition, a clear relationship between temperature 

increase and water quality changes, namely nutrient loadings (soluble reactive phosphorus, 

nitrate among others) was reported in semi-arid streams in Spain (Benítez-Gilabert et al., 

2010). These changes in physicochemical characteristics of freshwater environments affect 

directly and indirectly the biodiversity of ecosystems, with changes in distribution,

13 
 

morphology, physiology and richness of many species (Mezcua et al., 2004; C. M. O. 

Reilly et al., 2003). 

Figure 1: Widespread impacts attributed to climate change based on the available scientific 
literature since 2000. Symbols indicate categories of attributed impacts, the relative contribution of 
climate change to the observed impact and confidence in attribution. Number in ovals indicates 
regional totals of climate change publications from 2001 to 2010 (IPCC Synthesis report, 2014).  

 

The immediate effects of global climate change in hydrologic patterns may 

indirectly cause alterations in the physicochemical water properties with temperature being 

a determinant factor affecting almost all physicochemical parameters and biological 

processes. pH is an important environmental factor conditioning survival of many 

freshwater species. Water pH depends on a complexity of factors including temperature. 

For example, during a drought period in the Meuse river van Vliet &amp;amp; Zwolsman (2008) 

observed an increase in the pH reflecting a decrease in CO2 concentration due to 

proliferation of algae blooms elicited by higher water temperature and nutrients 

concentrations. Fluctuations in pH may compromise physiological fitness of aquatic life 



General Introduction

and also influence the speed of chemical reactions, degradations and bioavailability of 

contaminants. The DO in water can vary temporally and spatially and these changes are 

directly related to atmospheric gas exchange, temperature and may also be related to 

eutrophication phenomena (van Vliet and Zwolsman, 2008). A temperature increase, for 

example, can cause a decrease in oxygen concentration due to the lower water capacity to 

carry oxygen (Kundzewicz and Krysanova, 2010). DO has also an important role in the 

physiology of aquatic organisms and at low levels has been shown to affect survival and 

development of fish and invertebrate organisms (Ferreira et al., 2008; Küster and 

Altenburger, 2008; Padilla and Roth, 2001). Other important environmental factor 

conditioning survival of aquatic organisms is ultraviolet (UV) radiation. In the case of UV 

radiation, the depletion of the stratospheric ozone along with changes in dissolved organic 

matter (DOM) (as changes in climate may lead to a reduction of DOM in water), may lead 

to an enhanced exposure of aquatic life to UV-B radiation which can also compromise 

survival and development of aquatic organisms as demonstrated by many studies (Charron 

et al., 2000; Häkkinen et al., 2002; Oromi et al., 2008). The risks of fluctuations in the 

above mentioned environmental parameters are exacerbated as they may be able to modify 

the toxicity of chemical compounds and/or act as an additional stress to aquatic life.  

Changes in climate will also affect the development and geographical distribution 

of many agricultural pests, diseases and weeds, caused mainly by alterations in 

temperature, precipitation and wind patterns (Patterson et al., 1999). In particular, climate 

change will cause the spreading of insect-borne diseases and pests (Koleva and Schneider, 

2009; Porter et al., 1991) as well as the increased incidence of weeds (Coakley, 1999). For 

instance, 1º C increase in temperature will influence the development rate and distribution 

of the European Corn Borer inducing a northward extension (up to 1200 km) of this pest, 

as predicted by Porter, Parry et al. (1991). The increased incidence of existing pests, 

diseases and weeds predicted under climate change scenarios may imply an extensive and 

more frequent application of pesticides (Koleva and Schneider, 2009; J. Reilly et al., 

2003). Chen and McCarl (2001) studied the relationship between climate change and 

pesticide usage in US agriculture by employing projected climate change scenarios. Their 

results suggest that climate change will considerably increase pesticide use/costs in US 

agriculture. This will imply that more pesticides residues will reach the aquatic 

environment by runoff or leaching from agricultural fields which may increase their

concentrations and bioavailability to aquatic biota and, thus, affecting the survival of the 

most sensitive species.  

Thus, in some climate changes scenarios species have to cope not only with 

variations of natural environmental parameters such as pH, DO and UV radiation that may 

fallout of their optimal range but also with an increased load of pollutants as it is the case 

of pesticides. Moreover, and with particular relevance for this thesis, chemical, physical or 

biological interactions between these two types of stressors (environmental X chemical) 

may occur, exacerbating ecological risk for aquatic systems. However, these possible 

interactions are not usually taken into account in the toxicity evaluation and in the risk 

assessment of chemicals. The toxicity evaluation is carried out by exposing organisms in 

“standard conditions” where temperature, oxygen and pH are held constant. These 

conditions do not always reflect the heterogeneity and the multiple stress factors that 

natural populations experience in the wild and, more importantly, do not take into account 

the upcoming changes resulting from global alterations leading to inaccurate ecological 

risk assessment. Therefore, in order to improve risk assessment, new methodologies need 

to be designed, considering the evaluation of combined stress of environmental factors and 

chemicals.  

A model organism that could be suitable to address this issue should have particular 

characteristics including: i) relatively well understood growth and development; ii) 

relatively easy to grow and maintain in laboratory; iii) relatively short generation time; iv) 

closely resemble others organisms or systems; v) be compliant with ethical 

legislation/requirements/issues and vi) provide a set of easily quantifiable functional 

parameters allowing mode of action analysis among other features. This last is an essential 

requirement in a model organism and encompasses a good knowledge on the species 

biology and biochemical processes. The development of adequate technology is also 

important in order to enable precise measurements of responses and high throughput 

analyses. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) shows to fulfill these requirements, being an 

excellent model to unravel mechanisms of combined toxicity in the aim of this thesis as 

explained below. Zebrafish is a small tropical fish indigenous to South Asia and India. 

Recently, it has become a popular model in many fields of science including human 

disease (Bakkers, 2011), genetics (Haffter and Nüsslein-Volhard, 1996), pharmacology 

(Redfern et al., 2008) and (eco)toxicology (Braunbeck et al., 2014, 2005; Lammer et al., 



General Introduction 

16 
 

2009; Scholz et al., 2008). A number of unique attributes have contributed to its rise in 

popularity as a model organism: 

(1) Zebrafish are easy and economic to maintain; 

(2) They have a small size; 

(3) They present a high fecundity producing a large number of embryos; 

(4) Embryos develop rapid and outside the mother; 

(5) Zebrafish development has been well characterized including morphological and 

physiological information at all stages of early development (Kimmel et al., 1995); 

(6) The transparency of embryos allows unobstructed observation of the main 

morphological changes during earlier developmental stages; 

(7) Zebrafish genome is completely characterized. 

In the process of risk assessment of chemicals (plant protection products, 

pesticides, pharmaceuticals, effluents, etc.), a set of ecotoxicological tests is required for 

chemical toxicity assessment including the acute toxicity test with vertebrates (Scholz et 

al., 2013). The implementation of the new European Union regulation for the Registration, 

Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH) is certainly increasing dramatically 

the animal testing (Piersma, 2006). Moreover, the global production of chemicals is 

increasing with tons of new substances released in the market every year. However, within 

the current animal welfare legislation in Europe which demands the incorporation of the 

3Rs principles (replacement, reduction, refinement), testing with vertebrate animals should 

be reduced or even replaced by alternative methods (EU, 2010). In this context, the 

zebrafish embryo toxicity test has emerged as a true alternative – or at least a refinement – 

for the acute fish toxicity test (Braunbeck et al., 2014, 2005; Scholz et al., 2013, 2008; 

Schulte and Nagel, 1994). The approval of the OECD testing guideline nº 236 has 

consolidated the fish embryo test (FET) with zebrafish as a test to assess toxicity of the 

embryonic forms of fish and a full alternative for the use of vertebrates (OECD, 2013). 

The use of embryonic forms of fish has numerous advantages. Particularly, early 

life stages of fish (characterized by lack of independent feeding) are considered as non-

protected life stages complying with the ethical framework of the 3Rs (EU, 2010). In the 

case of zebrafish, besides all the advantages mentioned before, numerous studies have 

reported the good accordance of zebrafish embryos assays with the acute adult test

17 
 

(Belanger et al., 2013; Lammer et al., 2009) and in vivo results in mammals (Selderslaghs 

et al., 2009). In addition, the FET test enables the monitoring of a whole organism from 

early embryogenesis (1.5 hpf – hours post fertilization), until hatching (48-72 hpf) and 

beyond (96-120 hpf).  Furthermore, the FET is less time consuming and requires very low 

volumes of test solution.  

Briefly, the zebrafish embryos toxicity test consists in exposing newly fertilized 

eggs (?1.5 hpf) to the test chemical for a total period of 96 h (Fig 2). During this period, 

the embryos are evaluated daily and four observations are performed as indicators of 

lethality: coagulation of embryos, lack of somite formation, non-detachment of the tail and 

lack of heartbeat. In addition, hatching is also recorded daily starting form 48 hpf until the 

end of the test.

The assessment of sub-lethal endpoints in the FET assay such as changes in heart 

beat, presence of edema and deformities, changes in length, altered behaviour among 

others makes this test a powerful tool for the detection of effects at several levels and may 

provide information on the mode of action and, finally, indicate long-term effects of 

chemicals (Scholz et al., 2008).

1.2 Aim and outline  
 

Regarding the several direct and indirect impacts of climate change on aquatic 

environments and, at the same time, recognizing the complexity of environmental risk 

assessment for the combination of two or more stressors, this thesis aims to contribute to 

the discussion concerning the influence of climate change related environmental factors 

(pH, DO and Ultraviolet radiation) on the toxicity of pesticides. Therefore, the main goal 

of this thesis is to evaluate the toxicity of binary combinations of environmental 

parameters and pesticides using zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos as a model. In order to 

accomplish this goal, both stressors (environmental factors and pesticides) were evaluated 

separately and in combination and thus 3 specific objectives were established:   

1) To evaluate the effects of the environmental factors pH, DO and UV radiation on 

the development of zebrafish embryos in order to establish clear concentration-

response relationships to be further used in combined experiments with chemical 

compounds; 

2) To study the toxicity of the selected pesticides (the carbamate insecticide carbaryl 

and the benzimidazole fungicide carbendazim) combining lethal (survival) and 

sublethal (developmental, biochemical and behaviour parameters) endpoints to 

zebrafish embryos in order to better understand their toxic effects by expanding the 

sensitivity of the test and also to establish concentration response relationships to 

be posteriorly used in the combined experiments.   

3) Ultimately, to study the influence of environmental factors on the toxicity of 

pesticides by testing the binary combination of pH (acidic and alkaline) and 

carbaryl based on the previously established individual toxicity of each stressor.  

 

This thesis is composed by seven chapters. The chapter 1 consists of this 

contextualization and a brief introduction with an overview of the climate change process 

and its subsequent effects on aquatic environments. Chapters 2 to 6 are structured as 

scientific papers (two submitted and the others in preparation to be submitted in 

international peer reviewed scientific journals) and present all results of effects assessment 

of environmental factors (pH acid and alkaline, low DO levels and ultraviolet radiation) 



General Introduction

and pesticides (carbaryl and carbendazim) as well as the influence of environmental factors 

(acid and alkaline pH) on the toxicity of the pesticide carbaryl in combination. The 

description of each chapter is summarized below: 

 

Chapter 1: General Introduction. Contains a contextualization of the climate 

change process and the consequences to aquatic environments.  

 

Chapter 2: Pesticide contamination in a changing environment: the role of pH, UV 

radiation and oxygen depletion in the modulation of toxicity. A careful and massive review 

of the literature was conducted concerning the climate change process and its consequent 

impact on water quality through alterations in environmental factors and on pesticides fate 

and behaviour. Global warming, along with higher pesticide exposure in natural 

ecosystems may pose an increased risk in terms of quality of water resources and wildlife 

conservation. Climate change will produce changes in various abiotic parameters such as 

pH, UV radiation and dissolved oxygen in which we focused in this review and in this 

thesis. The combination of these abiotic factors with pesticides may be deleterious to 

aquatic species as they may interact in many ways producing higher toxicity and therefore 

affecting their development and long term survival.   

 

Chapter 3: Zebrafish embryo tolerance to environmental stress factors – 

concentration/dose response analysis of oxygen limitation, pH and UV-light irradiation. In 

this study we evaluated the tolerance of zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos to variations in 

three climate change related environmental stress parameters: pH, DO and UV light 

intensity. All stressors showed clear concentration- or intensity-dependent effects, on 

zebrafish embryo survival and development allowing the application of established models 

and determination of half-maximal effect concentrations (LC50, EC50). These data provide 

an important source to study the interaction of environmental stress factors with 

contaminants in the zebrafish embryo model in the context of climate change scenarios. 

 

Chapter 4: Effects of carbaryl in zebrafish embryos development, biochemical 

makers and locomotion. In this work the acute toxicity of the carbamate insecticide 

carbaryl was evaluated in zebrafish embryos using a battery of lethal and sub-lethal 



General Introduction 

20 
 

endpoints. Embryos survival, development, biochemical markers and behaviour was 

studied. Our results showed that carbaryl is moderately toxic to zebrafish embryos with a 

96 h-LC50 of 14.9 mg/L; however, low concentrations of carbaryl also demonstrated to 

impact embryos development. At the sub-lethal level, carbaryl significantly decreased 

heart rate and body length and increased malformations (edemas, red blood cell clutch, 

deformities such as axis curvature and tail deformity, etc.) and also resulted in significant 

alterations in enzymatic activities and behaviour. This study highlights the importance of 

considering the sub-lethal effects of environmental contaminants in risk assessment in 

order to better estimate their effects to aquatic biota.  

 

Chapter 5: Carbendazim exposure induced physiological, biochemical and 

behaviour disturbance in zebrafish embryos. The toxicity of the benzimidazole fungicide 

carbendazim was studied by performing a fish embryos toxicity test with zebrafish using 

several endpoints. The survival, development, biomarkers and behaviour of embryos was 

affected after exposure to carbendazim. The behaviour proved to be a very sensitive 

endpoint to evaluate the effects of pesticides to zebrafish embryos.  

Chapter 6: Influence of pH on the toxicity of carbaryl to zebrafish early life stages. 

In this study, the combined effect of pH and carbaryl was studied. We analysed and 

compared the predictive power of the concepts of concentration addition and independent 

action. Results show that observed mixture toxicity was rather well predicted by 

concentration addition. In the case of acid range the median lethal concentration (LC50) of 

the mixture is predicted with an error of only 8%. Considering the alkaline range, both 

concepts underestimate the LC50 (by a factor of 3 for concentration addition and by a factor 

of 4.6 for independent action). The use of concentration addition to evaluate the combined 

effects of pH and chemical stress seems to be suitable at least for the case of carbaryl and 

acid conditions. In the case of alkaline level, high pH values played a crucial role by 

modifying the toxicity of carbaryl through hydrolysis and consequently increasing its 

toxicity to zebrafish embryos. More research need to be conducted to evaluate mixture 

toxicity composed by chemical and non-chemical stressors in order to improve our 

understanding of these type of combinations and to improve the risk assessment of 

mixtures composed of chemical and non-chemical stressors.

Chapter 7: Discussion and Final Remarks. This chapter provides a general 

discussion on the results obtained in Chapters 2 to 6 and gives a short overview with the 

main highlights of the thesis.

Abstract 

Environmental pollution and global warming are two of the topics of most concern 
worldwide. With increasing anthropogenic pollution and rising temperatures, quality of 
water ecosystems is becoming seriously compromised. Climate change will also induce 
proliferation of many invasive pests as conditions tend to be favourable to their life 
cycles. In this context, pesticide use will surely increase as a measure to safeguard crop 
productivity. Global warming, along with higher pesticide exposure of natural 
ecosystems may pose and increase risk in terms of quality of water resources and wildlife 
conservation. Climate change will produce changes in various abiotic parameters such as 
pH, ultraviolet radiation and dissolved oxygen in which we focus in this review paper. 
We compiled data from 28 studies on the effects of the above mentioned environmental 
factors on the toxicity of pesticides (insecticides, fungicides, herbicides etc.) to different 
model organisms. The evaluation revealed that in 71% cases the environmental factors 
significantly increased the toxicity of pesticides mainly by changing the bioavailability 
and consequently the uptake of the chemicals by the organisms. However, gaps 
concerning the study of the effects of environmental parameters on the toxicity of 
pesticides were also identified, especially concerning dissolved oxygen depletion with 
only 3 studies available. This review highlights the need of further research in what 
concerns pesticide toxicity in the climate change context in order to improve the risk 
assessment of these chemicals and adequately protect aquatic biota. Understanding the 
mechanisms underlying these effects is a pressing need and essential to build better 
predictive models and therefore implementing better policies for climate change 
mitigation.

1. Introduction 
 
 

Climate change, particularly global warming is one of the major topics of concern 

worldwide and has been highlighted for its influence in natural and human systems. 

Assessment reports by the Intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC, 2013), 

indicate that global mean surface temperature has increased since the late 19th century 

further referring that the 2000’s were the warmest among all the previous recorded. This 

temperature change is expected to exceed 1.5ºC and the warming is likely to continue 

beyond 2100 in almost all scenarios. Apart from the direct effect that temperature has on 

organisms, it can also impact water quality affecting physicochemical parameters such as 

pH and dissolved oxygen (DO).  

Freshwater ecosystems are naturally the most sensitive ecosystems due to changes 

in the hydrologic cycle promoted by climate change (Allan et al., 2005). Several natural 

systems have been already described as impacted by recent climate change such as 

temperate lakes (Benítez-Gilabert et al., 2010; Fenoglio et al., 2010; Mooij et al., 2005), 

catchments, streams and lakes. Analysis of extensive time sequences of these ecosystems 

have shown that climate change affects water quality parameters such as nutrient loading 

(Benítez-Gilabert et al., 2010; George et al., 2004; Komatsu et al., 2007), DO 

concentrations (Mimikou et al., 2000; Prathumratana et al., 2008) and pH (Bates et al., 

2008; Vliet and Zwolsman, 2008). Furthermore, environmental parameters such as DO, 

pH and conductivity have been shown to be negatively correlated with hydrological 

parameters such as the mean level and discharge flow which are certainly associated with 

climatic processes (evaporation and precipitation).  

A case-study in Spain, in a semi-arid stream, has shown a clear relationship 

between temperature increase and organic matter content and nutrient (nitrate and 

phosphorus) concentrations (Benítez-Gilabert et al., 2010), being these important factors 

to consider when assessing the quality of water resources. Another case-study in the UK 

highlighted that important hydrological changes will certainly occur, such as frequent 

droughts in summer as well as flash flooding, leading to uncontrolled discharges from 

urban areas to water courses and estuaries (Whitehead et al., 2009). Also, other scenarios 

predict lower flows, reduced velocities and consequently higher water stagnation in rivers 

and lakes will enhance the potential for toxic algal blooms and DO depletion (Whitehead

et al., 2009). 

Besides all these important effects referring to the direct physical alterations in 

what concerns climate change, other indirect effects are previewed that should not be 

neglected. Changes in climate are likely to result on spreading of some insect-borne 

diseases and agricultural pests (Koleva and Schneider, 2009; Porter et al., 1991), in 

addition to the increased incidence of weeds (Coakley, 1999) caused mainly by 

alterations in temperature, precipitations and wind patterns. Several pests, diseases and 

weeds are already spreading or moving such as the Western corn rootworm, the Colorado 

beetle in potato, grass weeds in maize and Barley Yellow Dwarf virus in cereals (Parry, 

1990). Thus, it is expected, in the future, an increase in pesticide use and therefore 

increased bioavailability for non-target aquatic organisms. 

 

1.1 Effect of climate change related factors on pesticide toxicity 

Recently, special attention of the scientific community has been directed towards 

the combined effects of multiple stressors instead of a only chemical toxicity evaluation, 

especially considering the Global warming scenario. Standard chemical toxicity 

evaluation usually means exposing organisms in “standard conditions” where 

temperature, moisture, oxygen and pH are held constant and in controlled situations. 

However, these conditions do not always reflect the heterogeneity and the multiple stress 

factors that natural populations experience in the wild but more importantly in the 

worldwide context, do not take into account the upcoming changes resulting from global 

alterations and do not lead into an accurate ecological risk assessment. 

Some recent reviews which focus on the influence of abiotic/environmental 

parameters - highlighted as impacted by climate change - in the biological effects of 

contaminants such as Holmstrup et al., (2010) reporting interactions involving heat stress, 

freezing temperatures, desiccation, oxygen depletion, starvation and pathogens and a 

huge roll of chemicals including metals, pesticides and other types of chemicals such as 

ammonia or phenol. Similarly,  Laskowski et al., (2010) emphasizes the need to 

incorporate natural environmental conditions, especially adjusted to different 

geographical  areas, in ecological risk assessment. Further they refer that not only toxicity 

of single chemicals is affected but also that combinations of different chemicals may be 

modulated by various environmental conditions. Therefore, a pressing need arise to 



Pesticide contamination in a changing environment 

31 

 

design new methodologies to improve ecological risk assessment and environmental 

safety analysis. 

However, the mechanisms by which variations of environmental parameters 

increase the toxicity of chemical pollutants, in freshwater systems, are not fully 

understood. These may act simply by inducting metabolic changes which can be a likely 

factor for increased toxicity as referred many times in the literature (Heugens et al., 2001; 

Holmstrup et al., 2010; Lydy et al., 1999; Noyes et al., 2009) or can  interact chemically 

or biologically in more complex ways. Thus, scientific community is only starting to 

understand how multiple stressors such as salinity, temperature, hypoxia or Ultraviolet 

radiation (UVR) interact with chemical pollution and in which way are these affecting the 

biota in all kinds of ecosystems (Schiedek et al., 2007).  

 

1.2 Mixture toxicity 

In what concerns aquatic toxicology, two different concepts are broadly used to 

describe general relationships between the effects of single substances and the 

corresponding mixtures of stressors with similar and different modes of action (MoA) 

therefore defined as concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA). These 

models allow the calculation of expected mixture’s toxicity on the basis of known 

toxicities of the mixture’s individual components (Barata et al., 2007). 

These concepts have now been applied to environmental factors as well being 

used in a similar way to evaluate existing interactions. However, these terms must be 

used with caution as environmental factors, contrary to chemical pollutants do not 

possess a specific MoA that can be used to integrate the stressor into IA or CA models. 

Although, these models have already been used to investigate such interactions, none of 

the models obtained relates to biochemical and physiological processes which are the key 

to understanding those environmental-chemical interactions (Laskowski et al., 2010). 

Therefore, hereby, synergism or antagonism is referring to the degree by which the 

effects are either higher (synergism) or lower (antagonism) than the expected results in 

standard situations.

Taking into account all the information that was reported above, the main 

objective of this review is to highlight the state of the art of current research on 

interactions regarding environmental factors and pesticides and to identify data gaps that 

need to be fulfilled The environmental parameters to be addressed in this review will be 

the DO depletion, pH and UVR. Selection was made according to current state of the art 

and gaps in the literature concerning pesticides and climate change. 

 

2. Combined effects of environmental factors and pesticides 
2.1 Effect of acid and alkaline pH 

 

The pH is pointed out as one of the most important factors conditioning survival 

and fitness of many freshwater species since it affects many chemical and biological 

processes. The pH of freshwater systems (rivers and lakes) depends on a complexity of 

factors and can be indirectly affected by changes in climatic variables including higher 

temperatures, increased summer drought, intense rainfall among others (Wright and 

Jenkins, 2001; Wright and Schindler, 1995; Wright, 2008). For instance, a temperature 

increase may be indirectly related to a pH increase reflecting a decrease in dissolved CO2 

concentrations due to proliferation of algae blooms as reported for European river 

(Meuse) after a severe drought period (van Vliet and Zwolsman, 2008). In remote 

locations where acid deposition is absent such as alpine lakes (Psenner and Schmidt, 

1992; Sommaruga-Wögrath et al., 1997) a strong positive correlation is observed between 

pH and mean air temperature. In this case, factors such as a nitrogen deposition and/or 

biological activity are indicated as possible significant variables for this variation. 

As one of the most determinant parameter for any chemical and biochemical effect, 

pH alone has been extensively explored in the past. Variations in pH showed to have a 

significant impact on survival, hatching success, reproduction, pigmentation, swimming 

performance behavior and body chemistry of both fish species and invertebrate aquatic 

species (Fromm, 1980; Haines, 1981; Havas and Rosseland, 1995; Ikuta et al., 2000; 

Jordahl and Benson, 1987; Lechleitner et al., 1985; Okland and Okland, 1986; Ye and 

Randall, 1991), with early life stages of development being more sensitive to pH 



Pesticide contamination in a changing environment 

33 

 

variations. Effects of this environmental parameter are not restricted to the organismal 

level but also affect the community level, being responsible for changes in the structure 

of populations and for decreasing species diversity of aquatic organisms (Havas and 

Rosseland, 1995; Jordahl and Benson, 1987; Okland and Okland, 1986). Therefore, in the 

current and future climate change scenarios it is crucial to understand the consequences 

of this pH variations, especially in ecosystems where organisms are exposed to other 

chemical stressors being forced to cope simultaneously with multiple stress factors. 

The majority of studies considering the influence of pH on the toxicity of 

environmental pollutants have focused on the effects of pH mainly on metals and phenols 

toxicity (Bervoets and Blust, 2000; Dave, 1985; Dietrich and Schlatter, 1989; Grosell et 

al., 2006; Reader et al., 1989; Stouthart et al., 1996). Gerhardt (1993) reviewed the effects 

of pH on the toxicity of metals, concluding that metals toxicity depends on pH, because it 

affects sorption, complexation and solubility of metals. In general, it seems that decreases 

in pH implies increased metal uptake, consequently, increasing their toxicity. However, 

the effects vary among species, life stage and duration of exposure. The influence of pH 

on the toxicity of environmental pollutants has been studied for more than 50 years; 

nevertheless, few studies have dedicated to understand its influence on pesticides toxicity.  

In Table 1 we summarize 18 studies found in the literature addressing the effects 

of pH on the toxicity of pesticides. For almost all the pesticides, toxicity is correlated 

with changes in pH. For organhosphates and carbamate pesticides, hydrolysis seems to be 

an important factor as decreases in toxicity were related to rapid hydrolysis of pesticides, 

especially under alkaline conditions. However, the generation of more toxic hydrolysis 

products was correlated to an increase in the toxicity in higher pH values. In the specific 

case of trichlorofon, its toxicity increases at higher pH values due to formation of a more 

toxic form (Howe et al., 1994). Similarly, the herbicide mexacarbate zectran was found to 

be 38 times more toxic at pH 9.5. In contrast two authors (Kar and Singh, 1978; Rath and 

Adhikary, 1996) reported a reduction in the toxicity of carbaryl and carbofuran (Furadan) 

to cyanobacteria and algae at high pH. In both cases, toxicity decreases as consequence of 

a hydrolysis process, being these two more toxic at low pH (4.0-6.0).

Pesticide contamination in a changing environment

Regarding pyrethroids, the pH effects on toxicity of these compounds were 

investigated in the three studies and no significant changes in the toxicity were found 

(Ghillebaert et al., 1996; Howe et al., 1994; Mauck et al., 1976). The greater molecular 

stability of these compounds across the studied pH range (6 to 9.5) may explain the 

low or no influence of pH in the toxicity of this class/group of pesticides. However, 

tests under acidic conditions were absent in these studies.  

The toxicity of all the herbicides studied seem to be dependent on pH 

conditions except for the banned herbicide atrazine referred in Mayer et al., (1998). In 

the extreme case of chlorsulfuron, toxicity is enhanced by 25-fold when pH is lowered 

from 6.0 to 5.0. In this particular case, a pH-dependent sorption and bioconcentration 

was observed, suggesting that this herbicide primarily crosses the cell membrane in 

undissociated lipophilic form and accumulate inside the cell by ion trapping.   

As for the ubiquitous organochlorine herbicides 2,4 – dichlorophenol, 2,4,6 – 

trichlorophenol and pentachlorophenol, four studies (Dave and Garside, 1980; Fisher, 

1991; Kishino and Kobayashi, 1995; Xing et al., 2012) account for a strong correlation 

between an increase in toxicity and low pH with severe effects on the survival and 

growth of the exposed organisms. On the other hand, the toxicity of the broad 

spectrum herbicide glyphosate increases only at higher pH values (7.5 – 9.0) (Chen et 

al., 2004; Folmar et al., 1979) being this also observed by Tsui and Chu (2003) which 

reported a higher toxicity of this herbicide at high pH (9.0). Further, it was concluded 

that glyphosate became non-ionic under alkaline pH resulting in a greater toxicity to 

this species through a non-specific membrane disruption mechanism. 

As can be seen from these studies, pH can strongly affect the toxicity of 

pesticides. From the 18 studies reviewed, in the majority of cases (66%), it is reported 

an increase in the toxicity due to changes in pH. The influence of pH on the 

bioavailability and bioaccumulation of pesticides was the main explanation to the 

observed effects at different pH levels mainly through transformation or degradation 

originating more toxic metabolites (e.g. Mayer et al 1998; Tsui and Chu 2003; Howe, 

Marking et al 1994). In fact, it is well recognized that pH can act directly on the 

physicochemical properties of chemical compounds leading to drastic changes in the 

bioavailability and also affecting the uptake by the organisms (Rendal et al., 2011a, 

2011b). Understanding the influence of pH on bioavailability, uptake and also on the 



Pesticide contamination in a changing environment 

38 

 

sensitivity of organisms is extremely important to understand the combined effects 

between pesticides and pH changes. The data sets available in the literature relating 

pH to interactions with pesticides are very small comprising only 18 pesticides 

evaluated. In addition, half the studies investigate the pH effects only in the range of 6 

to 9 which may not adequately reflect the actual toxicity of pesticides in cases in 

which pH falls outside the natural levels, such as acidic lakes (Psenner and Schmidt 

1992). Therefore, more research is needed to better predict the impact of fluctuations 

of pH on the toxicity of pesticides in order to protect aquatic biota in the current and 

future climate change scenarios.  

 

 

2.2 Effect of low dissolved oxygen levels (DO)  

No environmental parameter of such ecological importance to coastal and 

estuarine environments has changed as fast as DO (Diaz, 2001). Hypoxia is defined by 

concentrations of DO below 2 mg O2/L, (Diaz and Rosenberg, 1995; Shang and Wu, 

2004; Wu, 2002). Hypoxia has been referred as a problem regarding mainly marine 

environments affecting thousands of Km2 of marine water all over the world and has 

been responsible for mass mortality in various groups of organisms (Diaz, 2001). 

Notwithstanding, this phenomenon also occurs in a wide range of aquatic ecosystems 

(e.g. streams, lakes, etc.) and varies temporarily and seasonally depending on many 

factors like atmospheric gas exchanges and temperature. While occurring naturally, 

hypoxia has been enhanced by anthropogenic activities related to organic and nutrient 

enrichment with special relevance on lakes and coastal areas which tend to be highly 

sensitive to nutrient enrichment  (Diaz and Breitburg, 2009) in a phenomenon known as 

eutrophication.  

Due to rapid human growth and global warming, the problem of hypoxia is 

likely to worsen in the upcoming years. An increasing temperature will lead to a 

considerable reduction in oxygen solubility, therefore leading to a more anoxic 

environment. Hypoxia due to anthropogenic factors may be a result of excessive input 

of nutrients and organic matter into water bodies with poor water circulation. Singly, it 

is referred in Bagatto (2005) that hypoxia has profound effects on the onset of all 

cardiovascular responses but also shifted the onset relative to the developmental

programme. Hanazato &amp;amp; Dodson (1995) refers that oxygen depletion may lead to lower 

growth rates in daphnids neonates due to an extra investment in haemoglobin 

production to compensate lower oxygen availability which will reduce energy needed to 

carbaryl detoxification. In this case, a synergism occurred mainly by changing patterns 

of energy allocation.  

Synergistic interactions between oxygen depletion and environmental 

contaminants have already been reported, mainly focusing on heavy metals (e.g. Cd). 

Very few authors such as Ferreira et al. (2008),  Hanazato and Dodson (1995), Van der 

Geest (2002), studied interactions concerning pesticide toxicity and DO depletion 

(Table 2). Interaction between these two parameters may not always be of synergistic 

nature as influenced by the specific mode of action of each pesticide. While Ferreira et 

al. (2008) states that oxygen depletion and carbendazim interact synergistically, Van der 

Geest (2002) described that oxygen depletion had no effect on the toxicity of pesticide 

diazinon. In another experiment, the synergism detected for low DO and high 

carbendazim concentrations in daphnids was attributed to the production of reactive 

oxygen species by hypoxic conditions and consequently a loss of detoxification 

capability at the cellular levels (Ferreira et al., 2008). This synergism was further 

confirmed by LC50 calculation at different DO levels.

Despite referring to possible hypothesis and mechanisms by which synergism 

may occur, in none of this studies is taken a molecular approach in order to properly 

assess the nature of this synergism. Although one paradigm remains, the synergist ic 

interactions resulting from lower oxygen concentrations should always be related, in 

some sort of way, to the energy allocation which is used to acclimate and therefore not 

available for detoxification of these contaminants. 

The data available among the bibliography surely lacks for the combined effects 

of oxygen depletion and pesticides in vertebrate species as well as a convincing 

explanation and description of the mechanisms involved in these synergistic 

interactions. In this way, toxicodynamics and toxicokinetics studies should provide a 

better understanding on the effects of oxygen depletion in pesticide toxicity, particularly 

if these approaches are integrated into the respiratory chain and in antioxidant defence 

such as (e.g.) superoxide dismutase (SOD) or catalase (CAT) but also physiological 

indicators such as haemoglobin counts as referred by Hanazato &amp;amp; Dodson (1995). 

However, it is noteworthy the lack of bibliography in this matter. 

 

2.3 Effect of UV radiation  

In the last years, there is a growing awareness on the effects of UVR in 

terrestrial ecosystems mainly due to an increasing concern related to human-induced 

depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer. Despite the attention given and the efforts to 

mitigate this depletion, projections point out that baseline levels pre-1980 will not be 

accomplished in the next decades (Weatherhead and Andersen, 2006), however, the 

most recent and promising report shows that ozone is no longer decreasing and is 

expected to return to normal levels before the mid of the 21st century (WMO, 2011).  

Nevertheless, many other factors can cause alterations in UVR. Besides the 

direct consequence of changes in the ozone layer, changes in aerosols, clouds, or surface 

reflectance may also affect UVR as reviewed by McKenzie and co-authors (McKenzie 

et al., 2011). However, future projections on UVR changes are uncertain due to the 

complexity in the projection of clouds and aerosol changes and also due to the complex 

interaction between climate change and ozone depletion (McKenzie et al., 2011).  Other 

important variable conditioning UVR effects in natural waters is the dissolved organic 

matter (DOM), which has a strong effect on the attenuation of UV-B radiation in 



Pesticide contamination in a changing environment 

42 

 

aquatic environments (Helbling and Zagarese, 2003). Changes in quantity and quality of 

DOM directly influence the exposure of aquatic organisms to UV-B radiation (Clements 

et al., 2008). Moreover, climate change may affect the production, transport and cycling 

of DOM leading, in some scenarios, to its reduction in aquatic ecosystems (Young et 

al., 2005, 2004). These changes in the amount of DOM, accompanied by increasing UV 

radiation, may exacerbate UV effects to aquatic biota.  

Ultraviolet (UV) is the shortest wavelength (100-400 nm) that reaches the 

surface of earth and is divided into three wavelength bands: UV-A (315-400 nm), UV-B 

(280-315 nm) and UV-C (100-280nm) (Helbling and Zagarese, 2003; WHO, 2002; 

WMO, 2011). Furthermore, the amount of UV radiation reaching the earth’s surface is 

mainly composed of UV-A and a small quantity of UV-B as UV-C radiation is almost 

all absorbed by stratospheric ozone. As almost no UV-C reaches the earth surface, UV-

B remains as the most hazardous to organisms (Häder, 2000; Preston et al., 1999; 

Williamson et al., 2001).  

Recently, the direct and indirect effects of UV-B radiation in aquatic ecosystems 

have received attention. Studies confirmed that solar UV-B radiation have harmful 

effects on aquatic organisms (Häder et al., 2007; Helbling and Zagarese, 2003). UV-B 

radiation demonstrated to inhibit photosynthesis  (Bracher and Wiencke, 2000), to cause 

DNA damage (Zeng et al., 2009), to alter behavior (Blaustein et al., 2000), growth and 

reproduction (Huovinen et al., 2001a), to reduce body size and hatching success 

(Dethlefsen et al., 2001) and increase deformities and mortality (Blaustein et al., 1997, 

2003).  

Nonetheless, it is important to note that there is high inter-specific variability 

regarding the sensitivity to UV-B radiation and thus, some species are not so susceptible 

(Häkkinen et al., 2002; Oromi et al., 2008). These aspects may pose difficulties to 

assess the UV effects in natural waters (Häder et al., 2007). Furthermore, the co-

exposure of organisms to UV radiation and a variety of environmental pollutants may 

induce interactive effects (antagonistic or synergistic). 

UV-B radiation has been reported  to modify the toxicity of many stressors, such 

as metals (Prasad and Zeeshan, 2005; Preston et al., 1999; Rai et al., 1998), polycyclic 

aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Huovinen et al., 2001b; Nikkilä et al., 1999), 

antibiotics (J. Kim et al., 2009; J.-W. Kim et al., 2009) among others. Arfsten et al., 

(1996) reviewing the effects of UVR on the toxic effects of PAHs in aquatic organisms 



Pesticide contamination in a changing environment 

43 

 

found that apparently the UV seems to increase PAHs toxicity. According to their 

results, exposure to UVR and PAH in concert induced a lethal phototoxic effect, where 

lethality may be a result of a rapid accumulation of cellular damage or death in higher 

aquatic organisms. Moreover, they found evidences that PAHs enhance carcinogenic 

properties of UV light. Another study investigating the effects of combined UVR and 

toxic chemicals associated changes on amphibian populations to synergistic interactions 

of UVR and contaminants (Blaustein et al., 2003). Although, a large amount of studies 

have tried to address interaction between environmental pollutants (mainly metals and 

PAHs) and UV-B radiation, few research have focused on the determination of 

interaction between UV-B radiation and the fate and effects of pesticides and the few 

studies addressing this issue are quite recent, dating from 1998 (14 years ago).  Table 3 

summarizes all the studies conducted on interactions effects of UV-B and pesticides on 

aquatic organisms. In the majority of studies explicit synergistic effects were found. 

Nevertheless, the mechanisms through how UV-B radiation enhances the toxicity of 

pesticides are heterogeneous and in some cases not clear. 

Three studies assessed the combined effects of UV-B and insecticides. Beketov 

et al., (2011) investigated the UV-B related toxicity of pesticides fenoxycarb, pirimicarb 

and tebufenpyrad on the survival, reproduction and population growth rate of daphnids. 

The combination of sublethal pesticides concentrations and UV doses produced a 

synergistic effect on both cumulative reproduction and population growth rate for 

fenoxycarb and pirimicarb, but a less-than-additive effect for tebufenpyrad. The authors 

stated two different processes that may explain the observed synergistic effects: (1) UV 

radiation possibly activates the compounds inside the tested organisms after exposure to 

chemicals, or (2) sensitivity of tested organisms is probably increased by UV radiation. 

They concluded that the synergistic effects are mainly due to the combined effects of 

both stressors (pesticides and UV) on daphnid physiology.

The other two studies investigate the effects of UV-B radiation on the toxicity of 

the well-known carbamate pesticide carbaryl. Both studies evaluated the lethal and 

sublethal effects of the combination on amphibians. Bridges and Boone (2003) found no 

effect of UV radiation on carbaryl toxicity. The authors believe that dissolved organic 

carbon of the artificial ponds used in the test might have act as a protection. On the 

other hand, Zaga et al. (1998) results indicated a synergistic effect due to 

photoenhanced toxicity by UV-B radiation. In this case, the synergism seems to arise 

from the photomodification of the carbaryl molecule in the water.  

One study investigated the interactive effects of environmental relevant UV 

doses (105 to 400 J.m-2) on the toxicity of carbendazim (a benzimidazole fungicide) to 

Daphnia magna. Ribeiro et al., (2011) found two different response patterns for feeding 

rates and reproduction. For feeding inhibition, when UVR was the dominant stressor in 

the combination, antagonism was observed. Conversely, for reproduction, synergism 

was observed when UVR was the dominant stressor in the combination. In these case 

the response patterns differs according to the endpoint and UVR dose applied. 

Differently from the others studies, these authors do not associate the increased toxicity 

to photomodification/phototransformation of the pesticide.   

The other three studies explored the UV-B influence on herbicides toxicity. 

Kasai and Arts (1997) and Scrano et al., (2002) observed a negative effect of UV-B 

radiation on triazine and acifluorfen to algae and  daphnids respectively. On the other 

hand, Lin et al., (1999) studying the effect of simulated sunlight on atrazine and 

metolachlor toxicity to aquatic organisms observed a decrease in toxicity when 

increasing light intensity. The authors suggested a possible photodegradation of the 

pesticides when exposed to simulated sunlight as the responsible for the reduction in the 

toxicity. 

Based on the knowledge obtained until now, the combination of UV radiation 

and pesticides seems to depend on the specific compound and its concentrations and 

also on the species and stage of development. However, further studies need to be 

conducted to comprehend how these stressors interact with one another and the possible 

mechanisms behind these interactions in order to predict the consequence of the 

increasing UV radiation. The synergistic effects should be thoroughly investigated to 

better define more realistic safe concentrations of pesticides. Furthermore, to realistic 

predict the consequences of increasing UV-B radiation and pesticides pollution under 



Pesticide contamination in a changing environment 

46 

 

the climate change conditions, it is of extremely and crucial importance to increase the 

knowledge on combined effects of these stressors. 

 

3. Conclusion and future remarks 

According to the literature reviewed, it is clear that climate change will have a 

wide range of effects not only on structure and function of freshwater ecosystems, but 

also on pesticide distribution and toxicity. From the 28 studies reviewed on interactive 

effects of pesticides and environmental factors showed that in the majority of cases 

(78%), environmental variables significantly modified the toxicity of pesticides on 

tested organisms. Although many studies refer the potential impact of environmental 

variables in pesticide toxicity such as pH, a lack of knowledge is still present when we 

address to the nature of this interactions. The terms synergism and antagonism still need 

to be clearly defined in what concern this relations. These terms do not imply that a 

direct effect is experienced due to interactions at the physiological level or the possible 

“side effects” that a given environmental parameter may induce. Also, it is clear that a 

temporal gap (from 2000 until now only 4 studies available) exists for certain 

parameters such as the verified in pH while there is a clear gap of knowledge 

concerning depletion of dissolved oxygen and the effects of UV radiation. Moreover, in 

the case of pH, the majority of studies evaluate its effects in the range between 6 and 9 

which do not reflect their real toxicity. Climate change is a much more complex 

problem than what is addressed in individual research on sole environmental parameters 

and pesticides and therefore we need to keep in mind that in natural environmental 

conditions interactions of more than one parameter and more than one toxicant may 

occur. Although this review highlights the need of further research in what concerns 

pesticide toxicity in the climate change context, it also points out the need to conduct 

integrated studies in which data should include site specific conditions for better 

ecological risk assessment. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these effects is a 

pressing need and essential to build better predictive models and therefore 

implementing better policies for climate change mitigation. We hope that this review 

may inspire future studies in this matter, not only referring to effects of the interactions 

between environmental parameters and pesticide toxicity but also to the complexity of 

the questions underlined here and hopefully leading to creation of better tools for 



Pesticide contamination in a changing environment

ecological risk assessment and mitigation policies.

Abstract  
During the last century the increase in the mean global temperatures has been shown to 
impact on freshwater physico-chemical parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen or UV 
light abundance. Changes in these parameters could modify the toxicity of environmental 
pollutants. Therefore, in this study, we studied the tolerance of zebrafish (Danio rerio) 
embryos to variations in pH (3 - 12), dissolved oxygen (3.9 – 237 µmol/L) and UV 
intensity (55 – 467 mW/m2) using selected endpoints. The zebrafish embryo is an 
established alternative test system that is widely used for assessment of the toxicity of 
chemicals. Embryos were exposed to different ranges of the sublethal endpoints, 
assessment included the quantification of hatching success, developmental delay, reduction 
of body length, and frequency of edema, and morphological abnormalities. 96 h-LC50s of 
3.68 and 10.21 were determined for acid and alkaline pH, respectively. Embryo survival 
appeared to be relatively resistant to oxygen depletion with a 96 h-LC50 of 13.17 µmol/L. 
However, concentrations of 187 mg/L and below caused edema and developmental 
retardations. Continuous exposure to UV radiation (UVR) affected zebrafish development 
by reducing survival and hatching rate and triggering a series of developmental 
abnormalities such as pericardial edema and deformities. A 72 h-LC50 of 227 mW/m2 was 
derived from intensity-response modelling. Our data provide a useful basis for the 
subsequent assessment of combined effect of environmental stress parameters and 
chemicals in the context of climate change scenario using the zebrafish embryo model.

1. Introduction 

Recent reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2013) 

have indicated that the global mean surface temperature has increased since the late 19th 

century with a tendency to exceed a further 1.5º C increase until 2100 in almost all

scenarios. Temperature does not only have a direct effect on organism but is impacting 

also on water physicochemical parameters such as dissolved oxygen (DO) level and pH 

which could affect the toxicity of contaminants to aquatic organism. Indirectly, 

temperature may also change exposure of organism to UV light. 

For instance, increasing temperatures and increased summer droughts are likely to 

favour acidic conditions in surface waters (Wright, 2008) due to a higher production of 

carbon dioxide. pH has been shown to affect survival rates, hatching success, reproduction, 

pigmentation, swimming performance behaviour and body chemistry of both fish species 

and invertebrate aquatic species (Fromm, 1980; Havas and Rosseland, 1995; Jordahl and 

Benson, 1987; Lechleitner et al., 1985; Okland and Okland, 1986; Ye and Randall, 1991), 

with early life stages of development being more sensitive to pH variations. Consequently, 

changes in the pH may also affect the community level and translate into via alterations in 

population structure and reduced species diversity. In acidic streams (pH of about 5), 

sublethal effects such as reduced larval activity and pigmentation, incomplete hatching as 

well as low survival of embryos could explain low population density and altered 

populations structure as observed e.g. in Salvelinus fontinalis brook trout populations 

(Jordahl and Benson, 1987). Eventually, low pH levels can constitute a risk for more 

sensitive fish and invertebrate species through effects on survival and development of 

embryos and larval stages. Moreover, an influence of pH on pesticides toxicity has been 

documented in various studies (Chen et al., 2004; Fisher, 1991; Folmar et al., 1979; Mount, 

1973). Overall, these studies showed that fluctuations in pH exacerbate the toxicity of 

pesticides which may be attributed to increased bioavailability as has been shown for e.g. 

aluminium and other metals (Dietrich and Schlatter, 1989).  

Increasing temperature is also expected to decrease saturation concentrations of 

oxygen due to a decrease in water capacity to carry oxygen.  In aquatic ecosystems with 

fluctuating oxygen levels as common for many lakes or streams, the dissolved oxygen 

depletion could increase the frequency of hypoxia status. Hypoxia is commonly defined as 

an oxygen concentration below 2 mg/L in aquatic environments. Anthropogenic activities 

leading to organic and nutrient enrichment may contribute further to amplify this effect by 

eutrophication.  

Reduced spawning success, sperm motility, fertilization success, hatching rate and 

larval survival have been described as hypoxia effect on wild fish populations and to 



Zebrafish embryos tolerance to environmental stress factors

reduce reproductive performance (Wu et a. 2003). At the community level, hypoxia does 

not only change the structure by loss of species diversity in fish and benthic communities 

(Dauer et al., 1993; Diaz and Rosenberg, 1995) but also change functional groups and 

types of animal/plants in benthic, fish and planktonic communities. Given that many 

chemicals are known to interfere with reproductive success and development, combination 

effects with oxygen depletion could be anticipated. For instance, synergistic effects on 

survival and growth resulting from the interaction between low oxygen levels and 

pesticides were described by Ferreira et al. (2008) and Hanazato et al. (1995) in daphnids. 

Decrease in oxygen concentrations has also shown to affect the toxicity of phenolic 

compounds to fresh water fish Nopterus nopterus (Gupta et al., 1983).  

Penetration depth of UV light can range from 0.5 to 4 m. Hence, UV-light is 

potentially damaging to species living in this zone (Speekmann, 2000). Projections show 

that despite the efforts to reduce atmospheric ozone depletion, the baseline levels of UVR 

before 1980 will not be restored in the next decades (Weatherhead and Andersen, 2006). 

Moreover, the UV exposure of inland aquatic ecosystems remains highly variable and 

could increase due to climate changes. For instance, alterations in dissolved organic carbon 

(DOC) could affect the UVR transparency since drier and warmer climates will reduce 

flooding and water saturation of soils within watersheds and hence, could reduce the entry 

of DOC to adjacent lakes and streams. This might increase exposure of aquatic species to 

UVR and affect distribution and abundance of planktonic and shallow benthic organisms 

as well as the benthic spawning zones of vertebrates such as amphibians and fish that 

deposit their eggs in shallow surface waters (Häder et al., 2007). 

UVR is defined as the shortest wavelength that reaches the surface of the earth 

being divided into UV-A (315-400 nm), UV-B (280-315 nm) and UV-C (100-280 nm) 

(Helbling and Zagarese, 2003; WHO, 2002; WMO, 2011). The UVR reaching the earth’s 

surface is mainly composed of UV-A and a small quantity of UV-B while UV-C is almost 

completely absorbed by the stratospheric ozone. UVR is known to provoke several 

deleterious effects in fish such as DNA damage (Zeng et al., 2009) and reduction of 

hatching success and egg survival rates (Charron et al., 2000). Moreover, UV has shown to 

modify the toxicity of many chemical stressors such as metals (Preston et al., 1999), 

polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) (Huovinen et al., 2001; Nikkilä et al., 1999) and 

pesticides (Ribeiro et al., 2011; Zaga et al., 1998) with – in the majority of studies – 



Zebrafish embryos tolerance to environmental stress factors

increasing toxicity of contaminants which may result in synergistic (i.e. higher than 

expected from the individual toxicity) effects. 

In the context of global change, understanding how the above mentioned 

components can affect toxicity of environmental contaminants to aquatic organisms is 

pertinent. Therefore, this study intended to evaluate the effects of different ranges of pH, 

DO and UVR (280-400 nm) on zebrafish embryos, an important model for the hazard 

assessment of chemicals. The zebrafish embryo test is considered as an alternative model 

to toxicity tests with juvenile or adult fish. It offers the possibility to perform small-scale, 

high-throughput analyses compliant with the 3Rs approach (refinement, replacement and 

reduction of animal experiments; Embry et al., 2010; Halder, 2001; Strähle et al., 2012). 

The transparent embryos and its well characterized embryonic development represent 

further advantages of the model in toxicity assessment (Kimmel et al., 1995). Therefore, 

we set out to provide a detailed and comprehensive assessment of susceptibility ranges for 

pH, DO and UVR as a basis for the future assessment of the impact of stress factors related 

to climate change on chemical toxicity.  

 

2. Material and Methods 

2.1 Test organisms 

Zebrafish were kept in a ZebTEC (Tecniplast, Buguggiate, Italy) recirculating 

system. Culture water was obtained through reverse osmosis and activated carbon filtration 

of tap water, complemented with 0.34 mg/L salt (“Instant Ocean Synthetic Sea Salt”, 

Spectrum Brands, USA) and automatically adjusted for pH and conductivity. Water 

temperature was 26.0 ± 1 ºC, conductivity 750 ± 50 µS, pH 7.5 ± 0.5 and dissolved oxygen 

equal or above 95 % (7.6 mg/L) saturation. A 16:8 h (light:dark) photoperiod cycle was 

maintained. The adult fish were fed twice a day with commercially available artificial diet 

(ZM-400 fish food; Zebrafish Management Ltd) and brine shrimp. Eggs were obtained by 

breeding of fish in aquaria with marbles in the bottom to protect eggs from predation by 

adults. The day prior to breeding, males and females were separated by placing a barrier in 

the holding container until the next morning. Early in the morning, barriers were removed. 

After removal of marbles eggs were collected, rinsed in water and checked under a 



Zebrafish embryos tolerance to environmental stress factors 

64 
 

stereomicroscope (Stereoscopic Zoom Microscope-SMZ 1500, Nikon Corporation). Eggs 

with cleavage irregularities, injuries or other kind of malformations were discarded.  

All tests were performed similar as described in the OECD testing guideline 236 

(OECD, 2013), in charcoal filtered and deionised water supplemented with 0.34 mg/L  sea 

salt (see above) at 26 ± 1 ºC and a 16:8 h (light:dark) photoperiod (except UV test, see 

below).  Exposure was conducted from 3 to 96 hpf. 

 

2.2 Analysis of pH effects 

Zebrafish embryos were exposed to pH ranges from 3.0 to 12. A set of buffers were 

used in order to prevent pH drifts during the assay (Table 1). All buffers (MES, MOPS, 

TRIS, CHES and CAPS) were first tested at neutral pH. The neutral pH is outside of the 

optimal buffer range but was only used to estimate any potential toxic effect to zebrafish 

embryos (Fig S1 and S2 suppl. Data (‘S’ before the number indicates that the figure or 

table respectively is provided in the ‘supplementary information’)). This analysis indicated 

that buffers were used at concentrations ranging from 17- to 64-fold below concentrations 

that cause mortality. Except for MES, all buffers were used in their optimal pH range to 

test for pH toxicity. However, despite that MES was used outside the optimal range it was 

found to efficiently maintain the pH (Figure S3) and was not toxic to embryos at the used 

concentration. HCl and NaOH (1.0 N) solutions were used for pH adjustment; a portable 

multiparameter device (ProfiLine Multi 332) was used for pH measurements. Test 

solutions were daily renewed.  

Embryos were exposed individually in 24-well plates for 96 h. For each test 10 

embryos were used per replicate and a minimum of 3 replicates were used per treatment. 

The following endpoints were registered: survival, incidence of pericardial edema, heart 

rate, deformities, hatching success, body length and developmental delay. The heart rate 

was measured by counting heart beats under a stereomicroscope in 3 randomly selected 48 

hpf-embryos of each replicate (n=9 per concentration) over a period of 15 s. Body length 

was measured by analysis of digital images of the embryos using the software NIS 

Elements D (Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) in 96 hpf-old embryos. Developmental 

delay was determined by comparison of controls and exposed embryos with developmental 

stages as described by Kimmel et al. (1995) and by calculating the difference between the 



Zebrafish embryos tolerance to environmental stress factors 

65 
 

stages in comparison to normal development (in hours). A correction accounting for the 

different temperatures used in Kimmels’ work and the present work was done using the 

formula HT=h/ (0.055 T-0.57) described in Kimmel et al. (1995) with HT= hours of 

development at temperature T, and h = hours of development to reach the stage at 28.5.

2.3 Analysis of oxygen depletion 

Embryos were exposed to oxygen concentrations ranging from 3.9 and 237 µmol/L 

(0.12 to 7.6 mg/L), reflecting an oxygen spectrum from hypoxic to normoxic conditions. 

The different oxygen concentrations were established by injecting compressed gaseous 

nitrogen to the exposure medium. This was done inside a controlled atmosphere chamber 

(model 855-AC, PlasLabs, USA), saturated with nitrogen gas in order to facilitate the 

establishment of the desired oxygen concentration in each bottle. Subsequently the test 

vessels with the embryos were transferred to an incubator with controlled temperature. 

Oxygen concentrations, pH and conductivity were measured using a portable 

multiparameter device immediately after adding the embryos and at the end of the test. 

Embryo exposure was performed with 10 embryos in 100 ml air-tight glass Schott bottles 

completely filled with test solution to avoid gas exchange during the assay. A minimum of 



Zebrafish embryos tolerance to environmental stress factors 

66 
 

nine replicates per treatment were used.. At the beginning of the test, the pH values varied 

among the different DO treatments between 7.6 and 8.4. Given that the results from pH 

experiments demonstrated that pH effects were only observed at various levels above or 

below neutral conditions, the pH was not adjusted. (see section 3.1: pH effects on zebrafish 

embryo survival and development).   

To avoid variation in the DO concentrations, flasks were not opened until 

measurement. Hence, separate replicates were used to analyse oxygen concentrations at 24, 

48 or 96 hpf. Embryos were then visually inspected using a stereo microscope. Survival 

rate, hatching success, frequency of edema, heart rate, developmental delay and body 

length were recorded.  

 

2.4 Analysis of UV effects 

Zebrafish embryos were continuously exposed to the UVR intensities ranging from 

55 ± 3.3 to 467 ± 25.7 mW/m2 for a 96 h period with no other source of light. A 

continuous exposure was chosen to allow the modeling of data and the derivation of 

L(E)C50 values on continuous exposure basis for future experiment on the combined 

effects of UV and chemical exposure. Additionally, a normal light control (16:8 h, light: 

dark; ?500 lux) and three continuous light controls (3.2 ± 0.83 lux to resemble intensity 

under UVR exposure, 539 ± 7.63 lux, similar to the normal light control and 1804 ± 13.11 

lux for comparison with previously published literature) were conducted in order to 

indicate whether the differential photoperiod alone may impact on the development and 

survival of the embryos. Organisms were placed in plastic petri dishes.  Acetate cellulose 

filters (0.003 mm, Grafix plastics, USA) were used to reduce UVR irradiation and placed 

directly below the UV lamps and over the Petri dishes (were they also avoided medium 

evaporation). These filters were previously irradiated for 12 h to achieve stable reductions 

in UV transmission and to filter UV-C wavelengths (200-280 nm). In order to achieve 

different UVR intensities, the organisms were placed at different distances from two 

Spectroline XX15F/B lamps (Spectronics Corporation, NY, USA). Lamps had peak 

emission at 313 nm and 365 nm corresponding to UV-B and UV-A respective emission 

peaks, see Fig S4 supplementary data.  



Zebrafish embryos tolerance to environmental stress factors 

67 
 

UVR intensities (280 – 400 nm) were measured every 24 h with a spectro-

radiometer connected to a monochromator and analyzed with BenWin+ Software 

(Bentham Instruments, Reading, UK).  Lethal and sublethal effects such as described in 

section 2.2 were monitored daily. 

 

2.4. Data analysis 

Lethal concentration values (LC10 and LC50) and effect concentration (EC10 and 

EC50) were calculated for each environmental parameter by fitting logistic dose-response 

curves  using the package drc (Ritz and Streibig, 2005) in the software R (R Core Team, 

2014). Model choice decision was made based on the the R2, the log likelihood value, 

Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and the estimated residual standard error. The models 

used as well as the slopes for each concentration response curve are presented in Table S1 

in the supplementary information. 

Buffer LC50s could only be calculated for CAPS and CHES. For all other buffers 

tested the low mortality rates up to concentrations at the solubility limit did not allow 

obtaining LC50 values. For these buffers an ANOVA (one-way analysis of variance) with 

appropriate post hoc test (- Dunnett’s or Dunn’s test) were conducted to potentially derive 

LOEC or NOEC values. The type of ANOVA (parametric or non-parametric) and post hoc 

test was chosen depending on whether normality and homocedasticity of data were 

demonstrated by analysis of the residuals with the Shapiro-Wilks test. Test statistics and 

analysis of normality were conducted using the software SigmaPlot V.11.0 (Systat 

Software, 2008) and a significance level of 0.05. 

 

 3. Results 

3.1 pH effects on zebrafish embryo survival and development 

The pH effects were tested for both acidic and alkaline conditions (pH 3-7 and pH 

7-12) using various buffers well below lethal concentration ranges (Fig. S1 and S2, 

supplementary data) to stabilize the pH. Embryos exposed to pH below 3.5 or above 10.5 

showed a 100 % of mortality. The observed lethality was established within 24 hours and 



Zebrafish embryos tolerance to environmental stress factors

did not increase with prolonged exposure. A 96 h-LC50 value of 3.7 ± 0.03 pH units was 

determined (Table 2 and 3 and Fig. 1 a). Heart rate was affected (bradycardia) at 48 h and 

pericardial edema increased frequency was observed at 96 h (Table 2 and 3, Fig 2 b, Fig. 

S5 a and b). For the alkaline range, a 96 h-LC50 of 10.2 ± 0.03 pH units was calculated 

(Table 2 and 3, Fig. 1 b). Alkaline pH also affected hatching success at 72 hpf (Fig. S6 a) 

and the incidence of pericardial edemas (Fig. S6 b).  

 

3.2 Oxygen depletion effects on zebrafish embryo survival and development  

The effects of oxygen depletion were studied on the survival and development of 

zebrafish embryos exposed to DO in the range of  3.9 to 237 µmol/L. At 24 h no mortality 

was observed even at the lowest tested oxygen concentration. At 48 hpf survival was 

decreased at concentrations below 18.75 µmol/L. Hundred percent mortality was observed 

at 96 h at concentrations below 9.37 µmol/L. For the same stage a 96 h-LC50 of 13.17 ± 1.7 

µmol/L (Table 2 and 3, Fig. 1 c) was calculated. At DO below 4 mg/L, sublethal effects 

could be observed such as decreased heart rate (48 hpf), increased incidence of pericardial 

edema (48 hpf and 96 hpf, Fig. S7 a, b) and developmental delay (48 and 96 hpf, Fig. 2 c, d 

and e, Fig S7 c). At 96 h embryos exposed to oxygen concentration of - 62.5 µmol/L 

showed a developmental delay of 20 h compared to the control and according to stage 

classifications based on Kimmel, et al. (1995) (with developmental time corrected for a 

temperature of 26º C). I.e. the pec fin stage that was reached 60 hpf of controls was only 

achieved at 96 hpf in exposed embryos. This developmental delay was coinciding with a 

decreased hatching rate (Fig S7 d) and a reduced body length (Fig S7 e). Body length was 

already reduced at DO concentrations where no other adverse effects were observed 125 

µmol/L.

3.3 UVR effects on zebrafish embryo survival and development  

In order to determine the effects of UVR on zebrafish survival and development, 

zebrafish embryos were continuously exposed to UVR (280 nm – 400 nm) over a 96 h 

period. The continous exposure was selected for compatibility with combinded 

stress/mixture experiments with chemicals, which requires a contineous exposure. Given 

that it is known that continuous illumination can already affect the development, a 

continuous light control was conducted. The control and the continuous light control 

groups developed normally, no mortality and/or developmental effects were observed in 

both normal photoperiod and the continuous light control. After 96 h, no survival was

detected already at the lowest UV level tested (3 mW/m2). Due to technical constraints 

(availability of suitable UV filters) it was not possible to test lower UVR intensities in 

order to derive 96 h-LC50. Therefore, effect concentration could only be determined for an 

exposure up to 72 h. The 72 h-LC50 was 227 ± 6.55 mW/m2 (Table 2 and 3, Fig. 1 d). UVR 

exposure also induced a variety of sublethal effects on embryos including increased 

incidence of edema (Fig. S8 c), inhibition of hatching (Fig S8  a), reduced heartbeat (Fig. 

S8 b) and deformities. UVR intensities above 107 mW/m2 significantly increased general 

malformations at 48 h (Fig. S8 d) and spine deformities at 72 h (Fig. S8 e). Fig. 1 g and h 

illustrates the type of anomalies observed in embryos exposed to UVR if compared to the 

control group.

4. Discussion 

In this study the effects of changes in pH, low DO levels and increased UVR 

intensities on the survival and development of zebrafish embryos were evaluated. The 

impact of these environmental stress factors have been studied in various aquatic organism 

from algae to vertebrates (Heugens et al., 2001; Holmstrup et al., 2010; Laskowski et al., 

2010). Data were also partially available for the zebrafish embryo but a comprehensive and 

detailed analysis including a time-course analysis as a basis to study combinatorial effects 

with chemicals was lacking. E.g. the pH effects on zebrafish development was previously 

only assessed for the acidic range by Dave (1984) who observed reduced survival at 

extreme acidic pH. However, in the study of Dave (1984) the pH fluctuations in some 

cases exceeded more than 1 pH unit and mortality at pH around 4 and 7 may have been 

partially provoked also by high buffer concentrations (1.1 mM citrate-HCl and 1.3 mM 

phosphate) used to stabilize the pH (Dave, 1985). The effects of oxygen limitation has 

been studied in zebrafish embryos from 48 to 168 hpf by Küster and Altenburger (2008), 

Shang and Wu (2004) and Strecker et al (2011) but none of  them provided a 

concentration-response relationship for the endpoints assessed.  Regarding UVR effects, 

the studies available (e. g. Charron et al., 2000; Dethlefsen et al., 2001; Dong et al., 2007) 

did not perform a continuous exposure to UV light which would facilitate to model data for 

subsequent experiments targeting to analyse combinatorial effects with chemicals. 

The compromising effects of acidic or alkaline pH, oxygen depletion and UV 

radiations are also long known and our study confirmed the expected results for the 

zebrafish embryo. Our primary aim was to establish concentration-response curves which 

could be used for hazard and risk characterisation of combined effects with chemicals 

(Cassee et al., 1998). The data provided by our study will be a useful tool for the study of 

combined effect of environmental stressors and chemical toxicity.

4.1 pH effects on zebrafish embryo survival and development  

Lethal effects of pH were fully established after 24 h of exposure for both acidic or 

basic ranges (see Table 2). Generally our data agreed with previous literature on fish 

toxicity, where pH showed to significantly impact on fish survival at values below 5 

(Dave, 1984; Jordahl and Benson, 1987) and above 10 (Kaur and Toor, 1980; Le Louarn 

and Webb, 1998). Cardiac effects, i.e. pericardial edemas and reduced heart rate were the 

most prominent observed sublethal effects for acidic and alkaline pH, however, they were 

observed at concentrations close to mortality and may be associated with overall toxicity 

rather than representing specific effects (see Table 2 and 3). 

Furthermore, at the alkaline range a hatching delay was observed. This effect was 

also observed in Silurus asotus at alkaline pH (Gao et al., 2011). Hatching delay is often 

associated with a reduction in the activity of the enzyme chorionase (Yamagami, 1981) 

which seems to be pH dependent with an optimum at around pH 8.5 (for the fish 

Coregonus albula L and C. lavaretus L) (Luczynski et al., 1987). Alternatively, pH may 

increase the hardness of the chorion and reduce hatching capability (EL-Fiky, 2002).  

Several processes may be involved in pH related toxicity: (i) the interference with 

structure and functioning of proteins (Kapetaniou et al., 2006), in case that intracellular pH 

cannot be maintained.  Activity of  proteins generally exhibit pH optima ranging from pH 5 

to 9 (e.g. Talley 2010). (ii) more energy may be required to maintain intracellular pH-

levels. If the intracellular pH is affected, the energy budget is further compromised, since 

the generation of ATP is enabled via proton gradients at the mitochondria (Mitchell, 1961). 

(iii) the interference in the osmotic regulation of essential ions. (iv) for alkaline condition, 

the disturbances in ammonia excretion and acid base regulations is considered as the major 

cause for toxicity (Baldisserotto, 2011; Bolner and Baldisserotto, 2007; Wilkie and Wood, 

1996).  Although fish can compensate changes in the external pH (Claiborne et al., 2002), 

the mortality observed in zebrafish embryo is likely to be associated with levels above the 

compensation capacity, with compromising effects on protein function and/or energy 

budget.

4.2 Oxygen depletion effects on zebrafish embryo survival and development 

Contrary to pH, DO effects on zebrafish embryo were strongly dependent on the 

exposure duration (Table 2 and 3). The results were in concordance with previous studies 

in zebrafish which reported developmental effects such as delay, heart rate decrease, 

increased incidence of edemas and reduced body length at oxygen concentrations below 

4.2 mg/L; (Küster and Altenburger, 2008; Strecker et al., 2011)  and reduced survival rates 

at 0.5 mg/L (Shang and Wu, 2004). Padilla and Roth (2001) showed that zebrafish 

embryos exposed to anoxia conditions enter a stage of arrested development which can be 

survived up to 24 h without any deleterious effect on subsequent development if oxygen 

levels are restored. This capacity to survive low levels of oxygen is likely related to a 

decrease in metabolism as an organisms’ strategy to reduce energy expenditure through 

arrest of developments and the corresponding demand for energy to synthesis cellular 

macromolecules such as proteins (Wu, 2002). Ton et al. (2003) has shown changes in gene 

expression including drastic suppression of ATP demand and shutting down of protein 

synthesis and cell division in zebrafish embryos under hypoxia. The observed reduction in 

body length and heart rate that were also observed by other zebrafish embryo studies 

(Bagatto, 2005; Shang and Wu, 2004; Strecker et al, 2011), may be related to the 

aforementioned biochemical adjustments but could also reflect a developmental delay and 

secondary toxic responses to hypoxia conditions.   

 

4.3 UVR effects on zebrafish embryo survival and development  

In order to establish concentration-response curves, embryos were continuously 

exposed to UVR throughout 72 hours (for technical reason longer exposure durations could 

not be used for deriving concentration-dependent effects). Although not corresponding to a 

natural exposure scenario, a continuous UVR exposure was selected to enable future 

studies on the assessment of combined UV-light and chemical exposure including the 

modelling of data. However, a continuous illumination cycle may interfere with the 

circadian clock and impact the development and survival of organisms as it is well 

documented for the zebrafish embryo in the literature (e.g. Jensen et al., 2012; Villamizar 

et al., 2013 among others). Villamizar et al., 2013 studied the effects of continuous light 



Zebrafish embryos tolerance to environmental stress factors 

75 
 

exposure or lack of illumination and observed effects on body length and survival rate 

(reduction by below 10%). Nevertheless, significant effects were only detected at 7 and 12 

dpf respectively.  Similarly, in the study of Jensen et al., 2012, constant light exposure 

(1800 lux) did not affect viability or caused any abnormal phenotypes although effects on 

the development of vasculatures were observed in 24 and 72 hpf embryos. Despite the 

observed vascular defects under constant light, embryos development was not affected. In 

our study, no effects on survival or developmental endpoints were observed after exposure 

to constant light. Therefore, the effects observed under UVR exposure can be mainly 

attributed to UV light and not to the alteration of the dark:light cycle. In addition, as 

reviewed by Vatine et al., 2011, although  clock gene expression are detected in zebrafish 

embryos at the first  24 hpf, no circadian rhythms of S phase are evident during the first 3 

days of development demonstrating that these rhythms are dispensable for normal growth 

and development in the laboratory environment.  

To our knowledge no other study has used a continuous UV exposure and hence, 

comparison to other results is difficult. E.g. in the study of Dong et al. (2007) a 24 h-LD50 
of 2.32 J/cm2 was obtained for zebrafish embryos exposed to short-term pulses of UVR 

during the first 24 h of development. The continuous exposure to UVR showed a strong 

time-dependent impact on embryo survival leading to 100% mortality at 96 hpf for all 

intensities tested.   

In our study, UVR also affected hatching – in agreement with studies on amphibian 

(Blaustein et al., 1997) and others fish embryos (Dethlefsen et al., 2001; Dong et al., 2007). 

The hatching delay/inhibition may be related to a reduced spontaneous movement of 

embryos mainly caused by an increased incidence of malformations that may hinder 

movement and reduce embryos ability to move to breach the egg shell.  

Developmental abnormalities have already been reported previously for zebrafish 

and other species exposed to UVR.  In the study of Dong, Svoboda et al. (2007) embryos 

exposed to UVR doses ? 0.93 J/cm2 exhibited spinal deformities while Fujimoto et al., 

(2007) observed edema, deformed head and double body axis in embryos of Misgurnus 

anguillicaudatus. These effects were discussed as a result of impairment of body axis 

formation through the UVR provoked disruption of the formation of the cellular 

microtubule array (Jesuthasan and Strähle, 1997; Strähle and Jesuthasan, 1993).

The observed EC50 or LC50 values of the environmental stressors tested are unlikely 

(with potentially the exception of O2 levels in some areas) to be of direct relevance for 

climate change impacts. However, the detailed concentration-dependent analysis would 

allow studying the interaction with chemical effects at low effect levels of the stressors, 

using for instance established models of mixture analysis. Future research can now build 

on the availability of detailed description of the impact of stress factors on zebrafish 

development and survival. 

 

5. Conclusion 

The present study intended to comprehensively evaluate the effects of oxygen level, 

pH and UV-irradiation using a detailed concentration-response on zebrafish embryos. All 

stressors showed clear concentration- or intensity-dependent, respectively, effects on 

zebrafish embryo survival allowing the application of established concentration-response 

models and deriving half-maximal effect concentrations (LC50, EC50). These data provide 

an important source to study the interaction of environmental stress factors with 

contaminants in the zebrafish embryo model in the context of climate change scenario.

The supplement provides additional data on the toxicity of acidic and alkaline pH, reduced 

oxygen levels and ultraviolet radiation to zebrafish embryos. The effects of the buffers 

MES, MOPS, TRIS, CAPS and CHES on embryos survival are shown to indicate that the 

buffer concentrations selected did not compromise the analysis of pH effects (Fig S1-S2). 

Fig S4 shows the UV light spectra used in this study, while Fig S5 to S8 shows the 

concentration response curves for almost all endpoints analyzed. In the cases where no 

difference between the curves at the different stages was observed, only one stage is 

shown. Heart rate and body length were only evaluated at 48 and 96 hours post fertilization 

(hpf), respectively.

 Abstract  

Despite the efforts to reduce the use of pesticides in agriculture, they are still widely used 
to prevent and treat pests. The main concern with the use of pesticides is the impact in non-
target wildlife with serious consequences to aquatic ecosystems. Typically, environmental 
concentrations of pesticides rarely cause lethality; therefore the risk assessment of these 
chemicals is better achieved if a battery of sublethal endpoints is used.  Within this context, 
the main goal of this work was to evaluate the effects of Carbaryl – a carbamate insecticide 
– in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo survival, development, biomarkers and behaviour. 
Developmental endpoints included delay, hatching success, edema incidence, 
malformations, reduction of size and alterations in heartbeat rate. Biomarkers included 
Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), Glutathione-S-transferase (GST), Lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH) and Catalase (CAT). Behaviour was assessed through a locomotion assay at 96 hpf 
(hours post fertilization) using the Zebrabox (Viewpoint, France) video tracking system. 
Carbaryl effects on zebrafish embryos survival was dose dependent with a 96 h-LC50 of 
14.94 mg/L. At the sublethal level, carbaryl significantly affected heartbeat rate, decreased 
body length and increased incidence of edema and malformations. Moreover, carbaryl 
exposure resulted in significant decrease in enzymatic activity (AChE, GST and LDH) and 
alterations in the locomotor behaviour of zebrafish embryos reflected by a decrease in the 
total distance moved. When compared to the developmental endpoints (mortality/survival, 
edemas, heart beat and etc.), biomarkers and locomotor behaviour were the most sensitive 
parameters showing effects at very low concentrations. This study highlights the 
importance of considering the sublethal effects of environmental contaminants in risk 
assessment in order to better estimate their effects in aquatic ecosystems.

1. Introduction 
 

Pesticides have become a major environmental problem. The use (and abuse) of 

pesticides in agriculture is widespread all over the world and has increased in the last years 

(except in some regions) as a consequence of the increase in human population and crop 

production. According to EPA (Environmental Protection Agency), in 2007 pesticides use 

worldwide topped approximately 2.5 billion kilograms (EPA, 2007). Moreover, the 

increased in the incidence of existing pest, diseases and weeds predicted under climate 

change scenarios may imply a more extensive and frequent application of pesticides 

increasing its use and bioavailability (Chen and Mccarl, 2001; Koleva and Schneider, 

2009; Mango et al., 2011; Reilly et al., 2003). The main problem with the use of pesticides 

is its migration from agricultural fields to aquatic environment by runoff or leaching 

(Larson, Capel et al. 1995, Battaglin, Thurman et al. 2003) which may increase their 

concentrations in the water, threatening aquatic biota.   

Insecticides represent a large (33 %) proportion of total pesticides used worldwide 

(Stokstad and Grullón, 2013). Carbaryl (1-naphthyl-N-methylcarbamate) is among the 

most widely used carbamate insecticide and is applied to control a broad spectrum of insect 

pests on crop and non-crop sites including domestic gardens (CCME, 2009). Low 

concentrations of carbaryl ranging from 0.1 to 1737 µg/L (Vryzas et al., 2009; Walters et 

al., 2003; Wilsont and Foos, 2006) have been detected in surface waters both adjacent to 

agricultural fields and urban areas (Munn et al., 2006; Phillips and Bode, 2004).  Generally 

environmental concentrations are in the sublethal range which strengthens the importance 

of using appropriate tools to assess the risks posed by pesticides in more realistic scenarios. 

Zebrafish early life stages tests focusing on developmental endpoints, biomarkers and 

behaviour have been showing promising results to evaluate sublethal concentrations of 

contaminants (Coelho et al., 2011; Oliveira et al., 2009).  

Like most carbamates, carbaryl is a known acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor 

with a resulting disruption of nerve impulse transmissions. The presence of carbaryl 

prevents AChE from breaking down acetylcholine causing it to accumulate in the nervous 

system (Fukuto, 1990). As a consequence, the continuous stimulation of the muscle leads 

to uncontrolled, rapid movement of some muscles, paralysis, convulsions and even death 

(Gruber and Munn, 1998; Gunasekara et al., 2008; Mora et al., 2000; Scaps et al., 1997). In 



Effects of carbaryl to zebrafish embryos

addition, carbaryl is also teratogenic, causing developmental and hatching delay, defects in 

heart formation including defect in cardiac looping, pericardial edema and decrease in 

heart rate and affected body length in zebrafish embryos (Gallo et al., 1995; C C Lin et al., 

2007; Schock et al., 2012; Todd and Van Leeuwen, 2002).  

The fish embryo toxicity test (FET) has been validated and adopted by OECD 

(Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) (OECD, 2013) and is now 

widely used with zebrafish. Among many other advantages, the transparency of zebrafish 

eggs allow the monitoring of the entire organogenesis permitting the study of a wide range 

of sublethal endpoints including anomalies (edemas, tail deformities etc.) and 

developmental delay (hatching delay) (Lammer et al., 2009; Scholz et al., 2008). 

Moreover, the use of zebrafish early life stages for the assessment of behaviour is also 

becoming popular (Fetcho and Liu, 1998; Tierney, 2011). Behaviour is linked to a range of 

stress responses such as physiological and biochemical disturbances (Beauvais et al., 2000; 

Tierney et al., 2007) and represents an interface between internal (physiological) and 

external (environmental, social) forces that may have serious implications in health and 

organisms survival (Little et al., 1990). In this context locomotor behavioural analysis 

represents a sensitive tool for detection and evaluation of sublethal effects of chemicals as 

compared to conventional endpoints such as survival (Levin et al., 2004).  

In the present study we aimed to assess the toxicity of carbaryl to zebrafish 

embryos focusing on sublethal endpoints such as developmental endpoints (hearbeat, 

edema, body length etc.), biochemical makers (Cholinesterase, Glutathione-S-transferase, 

Lactate dehydrogenase and Catalase) and behaviour (total distance moved). Although 

previous studies have already reported carbaryls’ toxicity to zebrafish embryos, the present 

study provides detailed concentration-dependent analysis (LCx or ECx) throughout the 

whole embryonic and early larval development (0-96h). Moreover, we are unaware of any 

studies addressing the effects of carbaryl on locomotor behaviour of zebrafish 

eleutheroembryos.

2. Materials and Methods 
 

2.1 Zebrafish maintenance and embryo collection 
 

All the embryos used in the present study were provided by the zebrafish (Danio 

rerio) facility established at the Department of Biology, University of Aveiro (Portugal). 

Adults were maintained in carbon-filtered water, complemented with salt “Instant Ocean 

Synthetic Sea Salt” (Spectrum Brands, USA) and automatically adjusted for pH and 

conductivity. Water temperature was kept at 26.0 ± 1 ºC, conductivity at 750 ± 50 µS, pH 

at 7.5 ± 0.5 and dissolved oxygen equal or above 95 % saturation. A 16:8 h (light:dark) 

photoperiod cycle was maintained. This reconstituted water was used in the preparation of 

test solutions of all assays performed. The above mentioned temperature and photoperiod 

conditions were constant in all assays. The adult fish were fed twice a day with 

commercially available artificial diet (ZM-400 fish food; Zebrafish Management Ltd) and 

brine shrimp. Zebrafish eggs were obtained by crossbreeding of individuals in aquaria; 

after 30 min of natural mating, eggs were rinsed in water and checked under a 

stereomicroscope (Stereoscopic Zoom Microscope -SMZ 1500, Nikon Corporation); those 

unfertilized, with cleavage irregularities, injuries or other type of malformations were 

discarded.  

 

2.2 Test Chemical and Preparation of Test Solutions 
 

Carbaryl (1-Naphthyl-N-methylcarbamate) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 

Stock solutions of carbaryl were prepared fresh by dissolving it in water and test solutions 

were prepared by diluting the stock. Ten ml of each tested concentration were sampled at 

the beginning and at the end of the assay and preserved at -20 ºC to further chemical 

analysis. The chemical analysis was performed at Laboratory of Environmental Chemistry 

and Biochemistry, University of South Bohemia in ?eské Bud?jovice, Czech Republic. 

The results are presented in supplementary materials Table S1.

2.3 Embryo assay 
 

The assay was based on the OECD guideline (236) on Fish Embryo Acute Toxicity 

(FET) Test (OECD, 2013). The test started with eggs at 3 hours post fertilizations (hpf), 

previously selected and exposed to concentrations ranging from 1 to 30 mg/L of carbaryl. 

Ten eggs per treatment were distributed in 24-wells microplates in triplicate and run for 

96h. Embryos were observed daily under a stereomicroscope (Stereoscopic Zoom 

Microscope – SMZ 1500, Nikon Corporation, Japan). The following endpoints were 

evaluated: survival, incidence of pericardial edema, heartbeat rate, presence of 

haemorrhage (clutch of red blood cell), malformations, hatching and body length (total 

length: snout to tail tip). Heartbeat rate (beats/15s) was measured by counting heart beats 

under the stereomicroscope in 3 randomly selected embryos of each replicate (n=9 per 

concentration) at 48h. Body length was measured using digital images of the embryos with 

the software NIS Elements D (Nikon Corporation, Japan).  

For analysis of biomarkers and locomotory activity, sublethal concentrations of 

carbaryl were used ranging from 0.00075 to 0.75 mg/L and from 0.0001 to 5 mg/L 

respectively. These tests were carried out in the same conditions as the above described 

test. For biomarkers, at 96 hours of exposure, 10 clusters of eight larvae per treatment were 

snap-frozen in microtubes containing 0.8 ml of K-phosphate buffer (0.1M, pH 7.4) and 

stored at - 80 ºC for further enzymatic analysis (see section 2.4). For locomotory assay 

larvae were transferred to 96 well plates and analysed using the track system Zebrabox 

(Viewpoint, Lyon, France) at 96 h (see section 2.5). 

 

2.4 Biomarker determinations 
 

Enzymatic assays were performed to analyse cholinesterase (ChE), glutathione-S-

transferase (GST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and catalase (CAT) activities in zebrafish 

embryos. On the day of enzymatic analyses, samples were defrosted on ice, homogenised 

(KIKA Labortechnik U2005 Control) and centrifuged at 4 ºC, 10000 g, during 20 min in 

order to isolate the post-mitochondrial supernatant (PMS) posteriorly used as enzyme

extract for enzymatic activity determination. All determinations were made 

spectrophotometrically (Thermo Scientific Multiskan Spectrum, USA) using 96 wells 

microplates. 

Protein quantification in samples was performed in quadruplicate according to the 

Bradford method (Bradford, 1976), at 595 nm, using ?- globulin to determine standard 

curve. The method for the determination of ChE, GST and LDH activity is described in 

Domingues et al. (2010). Briefly, ChE activity was determined using acetylthiocholine as 

substrate and measuring at 414 nm (every 20 s, for 5 min) the conjugation product between 

thiocoline (a product of the degradation of acetylthiocholine) and 5,5-dithiobis-2- 

nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) (absorbance increase), according to the method of Ellman et al. 

(1961). Activity determinations were made using 40 ?L of PMS, 250 ?L of reaction 

mixture (acetylthiocholine (75 mM), and DTNB (10 mM)) in Kphosphate buffer (0.1 M, 

pH 7.2).  

GST activity was determined at 340 nm by monitoring the increase in absorbance every 

20 s, during 5 min, following the general protocol described by Habig and Jakoby (1981) 

adapted to microplate reader (Frasco and Guilhermino, 2002). Activity determinations 

were performed using 100 ?L of PMS from the sample and 200 ?L of reaction solution (10 

mM reduced glutathione (GSH) and 60 mM 1-chloro-2.4-dinitrobenzene in K-phosphate 

buffer (0.05 M, pH 6.5)). 

CAT activity was measured at 240 nm in spectrophotometer quartz cell by monitoring 

(every 10 s, for 2 min) the decrease of absorbance due to degradation of H2O2, as described 

by Clairborne (1985). Fifteen microliters of PMS was mixed with 135 ?L of reaction 

solution (H2O2, 30 mM) and 150 ?L of K-phosphate buffer (0.05 M, pH 7.0). 

LDH activity was measured at 340 nm and was based on the decrease of absorbance (5 

min) due to the oxidation of NADH, following the methodology described by Vassault 

(1983) with the modifications introduced by Diamantino et al. (2001). Activity 

determinations were made using 40 ?l of PMS of the sample, 250 ?l of NADH (0.24 mM) 

and 40 ?l of piruvate (10 mM) in Tris–NaCl buffer (100 mM, pH 7.2). 

Enzymatic activity were determined in quadruplicate and expressed in nanomoles of 

substrate hydrolyzed per minute per mg of protein. A Labsystem Multiskan EX microplate 

(Labsystems Inc., Franklin, MA) reader was used to determine all protein and enzymatic 

activity.

2.5 Locomotory activity assay 
 

To assess carbaryl effects on locomotor activity, zebrafish larvae at 96 hpf were 

used. Locomotion was evaluated for 24 embryos per treatment including the control in 96 

well plates (one embryo per well). Embryonic movement was tracked using the Zebrabox-

ZEB 478 (software version 3.22, Viewpoint Life Sciences, Lyon, France) a system that 

monitors the movement by automated video recording with an infrared camera (25 images 

per second). Typically zebrafish larvae show less locomotion during light periods and 

more during dark. Therefore, movement was stimulated by applying light:dark intervals 

according to what was described in Irons et al (2010). Briefly, embryonic movements were 

recorded during light-dark intervals over a period of 20 minutes (5 min light, 10 min dark, 

5 min light). For each replicate the distances moved in 1 minute intervals were recorded 

separately and only locomotion in the dark period was used to calculate the differences 

between control and treated embryos. The parameter total distance moved was calculated 

and refers to the total swimming distance of the larvae during each measurement period.  

2.5 Statistical analysis 
 

Sigmaplot for Windows V.12.5 (Systat Software, 2008) was used for statistical 

analyses. One-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) was used to test differences between the 

different treatments in normally distributed data sets. When datasets failed the Kolmogorov 

Smirnov normality test, an ANOVA on ranks (Kruskall-Wallis) was performed and the 

Dunnet’s or Dunn’s post-hoc test where used to compare each treatment against control. 

Lethal concentrations (LCx) and effective concentrations (ECx) values were calculated for 

each developmental endpoint by fitting dose-response curves. A significance level of 0.05 

was used to infer statistically significant results.

3.1 Effects of carbaryl on zebrafish early life stages 
 

Carbaryl significantly affected zebrafish embryos survival and development. Table 

1 presents all the calculated LC50 and EC50 for all developmental endpoints analysed and 

Table S2 presents the models used to calculate concentration response curves. Below 5 

mg/L, survival was higher than 90 %; however, there was a severe decrease in survival 

from 15 mg/L reaching 0 % at 30 mg/L. Fig. 1 indicates a dose dependent response with a 

96 h-LC50 of 14.91 mg/L (Table 1).

The development of embryos was also affected by carbaryl. Teratogenic effects 

were found even at low concentrations. At 24 h of exposure concentrations above 15 mg/L 

increased the incidence of deformities and a 24 h-EC50 of 19.36 mg/L was calculated 

(Table 1). At 48 h, Carbaryl also significantly affected embryos heartbeat rate at 

concentrations above 3 mg/L inducing a decrease in heartbeat as can be seen in Fig. 2c. 

Embryos exposed to the highest concentration presented an average heart beat rate of only 

67 beats, while controls had an average heart rate of 155 beats per min. Along with the 

decrease in heartbeat, carbaryl-treated embryos presented an increased incidence of 

edemas and haemorrhage (clutch of red blood cell) both at 48 and 72 h (Fig. 2a, Table 01). 

Moreover, at 72 hours a delay in hatching was observed in concentrations above 10 mg/L, 

with a 72 h-EC50 of 15.2 mg/L.

At 96 h, carbaryl strongly affected embryos body length at 96 hpf. Fig 3d shows a 

significant decrease of body length in treated embryos even at concentration as low as 1.6 

mg/L were no other effect was observed. The carbaryl-treated embryos were considerably 

smaller; at the concentration 11.4 mg/L for example, embryos presented a mean body 

length of 3 mm, whereas control embryos exhibited a mean body length of 3.4 mm.

hpf: a) percentage of embryos showing edema; b) percentage of embryos that showed haemorrhage 
(clutch of red blood cell); c) percentage of embryos showing tail deformities and; d) body length of 
larvae at the end of the test.  

 

Additionally, exposure to carbaryl also induced a series of morphological changes 

as can be observed in Fig. 4. These alterations can be characterized for the presence of 

haemorrhage (clutch of red blood cell) mainly in the heart (Fig. 4e) and in the tail (fig not 

showed), the incidence of pericardial edemas (Fig 4b, c, d and f), tail deformities (Fig 4d, 

f) and spine deformities (Fig 4b).

3.2 Carbaryl effects on enzymatic activity 
 

The effects of carbaryl on the activities of biomarkers (ChE, GST, LDH and CAT) 

are presented in Figure 5. Exposure to carbendazim significantly inhibited ChE (F = 7.11; 

P = 0.001), GST (F = 6.28; P = 0.001) and LDH (F = 4.49; P = 0.005) activities at 

concentrations equal and above 0.0075 mg /L when compared to control group (Fig 5 a-c). 

The activity of CAT seems also to be altered; however, no statistically significant 

differences were observed (F = 2.6; P = 0.046).

3.3 Carbaryl impacts on larval behaviour 
 

 Carbaryl showed to significantly alter the locomotor behaviour of zebrafish 

embryos at 96 hpf. Fig. 6 shows the results for mean total distance moved (mm) across 

each measurement period. At low concentrations (? 0.01) exposure to carbaryl seem to do 

not affect the overall locomotor activity of the embryos as no differences were observed 

when compared to control (Fig 6). However, at the concentration 0.1 mg/L and above, the 

locomotor activity seems to be affected as significant reduction in total swimming distance 

was observed (Fig. 6).

4. Discussion 
 

4.1 Carbaryl effects on embryos survival and development 
 

Pesticides are one of the major sources of ecological contamination and their 

impacts in the environment are an important target of research. Carbaryls’ use started in 

the late 1950s (Chemical Watch) and in the past decades its toxicity has been studied in 

different model organisms. Carbaryl toxicity to fish early life stages varies accordingly to 

the fish species and stage of development. Table S3 (supplementary data) summarizes the 

literature review for carbaryl toxicity in fish early developmental stages. The toxicity of 

carbaryl to zebrafish embryos have been explored in three different studies, however, 

E(L)Cx values were reported only by Lin et al (2007) for the 24 hpf (LC50 =  44.66 and 

EC50 = 7.52 mg/l). For adult fish a 96 h-LC50 of 9.26 mg/L was reported for zebrafish 

(Gallo et al., 1995) while for other fish species varies between 2.51 and 7.89 mg/L. In our

study the 96 h-LC50 was 14.94 mg/L and the effects of carbaryl on zebrafish survival 

showed to be dose-dependent which are consistent with previous results (Schock et al., 

2012) (Fig. 1).  

At low concentrations, carbaryl exposure caused developmental and hatching delay 

and shortened body length of fish embryos (Kashiwada et al., 2008; Todd and Van 

Leeuwen, 2002). In our experiments, carbaryl caused hatching delay and was also 

responsible for a significant reduction of approximately 0.6 mm on body size of embryos. 

Carbaryl’s mechanism of reducing body length has not been reported in the literature. This 

decrease in body length may be due to the metabolic costs associated with the 

detoxification of the pesticide leading to a reduction of individual fitness as hypothesized 

for fish and amphibians exposed to metal and pesticides (Cook et al., 2005; Diana et al., 

2000; Schock et al., 2012). Development, hatching delay and reduced fitness may have 

serious implications in fish survival as it makes them more susceptible to predation.  

Moreover, carbaryl has also shown to impair cardiovascular development of fish 

embryos causing heart malformations, pericardial edemas and bradycardia. Kashiwada et 

al (Kashiwada et al., 2008) studying carbaryl effects on medaka (Oryzias latipes) embryos, 

reported an increased rate of tubular heart and pericardial edema formation and a reduction 

in heartbeat rate at sublethal concentrations (5-10 mg/L). Morphological defects in cardiac 

development were also found in zebrafish embryos exposed to carbaryl. Schock et al., 

(2012) observed a decrease in cardiac precursor field as well as defects and delays in 

cardiac tube migration and fusion. In addition, they also observed delayed or defective 

cardiac looping in exposed embryos. In our studies, carbaryl induced a significant decrease 

in heart beat even at low concentrations (4.3 mg/L) (Fig. 2c) and also increased the 

incidence of pericardial edema (Table 1, Fig. 2b, 3a). Pericardial edema seems to be a 

common feature in carbaryl-exposed embryos as reported for medaka and zebrafish 

(Kashiwada et al., 2008; C. C. Lin et al., 2007; Schock et al., 2012). Generally, AChE 

inhibitors (the case of carbaryl) have been reported to decrease heartbeat rate (Kashiwada 

et al., 2008; Schock et al., 2012; Watson et al., 2014). Briefly, the increase in acetylcholine 

concentration in the synaptic cleft caused by the presence of carbaryl (AChE inhibitor) 

lead to continuous signals from the acetylcholine receptor causing the decrease in heart 

rate (McKim et al., 1987). However, Lin et al., (2007) hypothesized that the decrease in 

heart beat at early developmental stages (2 dpf) may be due to an alternate mechanism of 



Effects of carbaryl to zebrafish embryos 

108 
 

inhibition of calcium ion channels. Nevertheless, the exact nature of this mechanism is still 

unclear. 

Carbaryl is also teratogenic, causing bent tail, notochord bending and axial skeletal 

defects in embryos of different species of amphibians (Bacchetta et al., 2008; Bridges, 

2000; Kang et al., 2010) and inducing changes in tail morphology in zebrafish (Schock et 

al., 2012). In our study, carbaryl exposure triggered a series of different phenotypes in 

zebrafish embryos such as, haemorrhage, pericardial edema, tails deformities and spine 

curvature (Fig. 4b-f). This increase in developmental abnormalities may also be related to 

AChE inhibition action of carbaryl. Bacchetta et al., (2008) hypothesized cholinesterase 

inhibition with consequent repetitive muscular spasms to be responsible to the abnormal 

tail flexure of the amphibian embryos of the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis). Kang et 

al., (2010) sustain the same hypothesis as a consequence of several developmental 

abnormalities found in Boulenger (Bombina orientalis) embryos exposed to carbaryl. 

Behra et al., (2002) studying the AChE role in the neuronal and muscular development of 

zebrafish embryos concluded that AChE activity is essential for the correct development of 

the muscle apparatus preventing damage in subsequent developmental stages. In our study, 

tail deformities were common in zebrafish larvae at 96 hpf in a dose dependent manner and 

may be related to carbaryl ability to inhibit AChE activity.    

 

4.2 Effects of carbaryl on biochemical makers and locomotor activity of zebrafish embryos 
 

 In the present study carbaryl was found to alter the swimming behaviour of 

zebrafish embryos exposed to concentration equal or higher than 0.1 mg /L. These 

alterations in swimming behaviour can disrupt feeding (capability to capture prey), impair 

the ability to attract mates, and increase vulnerability to predation (through an inability to 

remain inconspicuous) which may have serious implications for long term survival (Little 

and Finger, 1990) and makes locomotor activity an important and relevant parameter for 

the risk assessment of pesticides. Our results are in good agreement with previous studies 

where adverse effects of acute exposure to insecticides on fish swimming behaviour were 

also found. For example, a decrease in locomotor activity was also observed in juvenile 

goldfish (Carassius auratus) exposed to another carbamate insecticide carbofuran (50 and 



Effects of carbaryl to zebrafish embryos 

109 
 

100 µg/L) (Bretaud et al., 2001); a markedly decrease in swimming activity was observed 

in rainbow trout larvae (Onchorhynchus mykiss) after exposure to two organophosphate 

insecticide namely diazinon and malathion (Beauvais et al., 2000);  similarly, Beauvais et 

al., (2001) reported a decrease in swimming speed of rainbow trout larvae (Onchorhynchus 

mykiss) exposed to carbaryl. 

As expected for a carbamate insecticide, carbaryl significantly inhibited the activity 

of AChE (Fig. 5a). AChE is closely related with behavioural changes as pointed out by 

Scott and Slomman 2004. Therefore, AChE inhibition may be correlated to the decrease in 

swimming performance of zebrafish embryos observed in this study. Similarly, previous 

research also related AChE inhibition to changes in behaviour for other fish species 

exposed to carbaryl and other carbamate insecticides for example, in the rainbow trout 

larvae (Oncorhynchus mykiss) exposed to carbaryl (Beauvais et al., 2001) and the gold fish 

(Carassius auratus) exposed to carbofuran (Bretaud et al., 2001). 

GST and LDH activities were also inhibited after exposure to carbaryl (Fig. 5 b and 

c). Both enzymes activities were also reported to be affected (decreased) after exposure to 

carbamate insecticides. Exposure to 0.25 mg/L of carbaryl decreased GST activity in the 

liver of nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) (Matos et al., 2007). Similarly, the carbamate 

insecticide isoprocarb also significantly inhibited gill GST activity of gold fish (Carassius 

auratus) (Wang et al., 2012). Regarding LDH, Singh &amp;amp; Sharma (1998) demonstrated that 

exposure to carbofuran significantly decreased enzymatic activity in different body tissues 

of the teleost fish Clarias batrachus.  

These two enzymes are directly involved in metabolic activity of organisms. GST 

play a crucial role in the biotransformation (metabolism) of xenobiotic compounds and its 

activity may be induced or inhibited after exposure to xenobiotics (Hyne and Maher, 

2003). LDH is an important enzyme in the anaerobic pathway of energy production and is 

also involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates (Diamantino et al., 2001). Considering 

that metabolism is closely related with fish behaviour as reviewed by Sloman et al 2004, 

the observed inhibition of GST and LDH activities may have also be involved in the 

reduction of the total swimming distance of embryos exposed to carbaryl.  

In this study, carbaryl exposure showed to significantly impact zebrafish embryos 

survival and development. Moreover, sublethal concentrations were responsible to 

decrease the total swimming distance and also inhibited ChE, GST and LDH activities

which effects are likely correlated. However, further studies correlating behavioural 

measures and biochemical marks are necessary to elucidate the specific mechanisms by 

which alterations in neurotransmission and/or metabolic enzymes result in changes in 

behaviour. Sublethal levels of carbaryl showed to affect embryos at concentrations more 

than ten times below the 96 h-LC50 (at 0.0075 mg/L for biomarkers and 0.1 mg/L for 

behaviour). This raises concern regarding carbaryl toxicity to aquatic biota since this 

insecticide is widely used and has been already detected in freshwater bodies in higher 

concentrations (0.1-1737 µg/L) (Vryzas et al., 2009; Walters et al., 2003; Wilsont and 

Foos, 2006). Therefore, our results highlight the importance of biomarkers and behavior 

endpoints in the risk assessment of pesticides. Although the total swimming distance was 

less sensitive compared to the biomarkers used, this endpoint is very important due to its 

ecological relevance and should be used as a complement in developmental studies.  

5. Conclusion 
 

The effects of carbaryl on zebrafish embryos development were analysed. Carbaryl 

showed to have a great impact in fish embryonic development reducing survival, delaying 

hatching, causing edema and deformities and affecting heartbeat and embryos size. The 

data presented here besides confirming previous findings, also give a more detailed 

analysis of carbaryl effects on zebrafish embryos overall development throughout the 

embryonic and early larval stage (96 h). Moreover, in this study we provide novel data 

demonstrating that sublethal concentrations of carbaryl affect locomotor behaviour of 

zebrafish which may indicate an overestimation of the effects of carbaryl specially in 

developing embryos. Compared to survival or developmental parameters, biomarkers 

followed by behaviour were the most sensitive endpoints been capable of detecting effects 

in very low concentration of carbaryl. Therefore, combining developmental parameters as 

well as the sensitiveness of biomarkers and behavioural endpoints seems to be an excellent 

approach to expand the sensitivity of standard toxicity tests and consequently improve the 

risk assessment of pesticides.

Aquatic Toxicology 

Abstract  
Carbendazim is a widely used broad spectrum benzimidazole fungicide; however, 

its effects to non-target aquatic organisms are poorly studied. The aim of this study was to 
investigate the toxic effects of carbendazim to zebrafish early life stages at several levels of 
biological organization, including developmental, biochemical and behavioural levels. A 
first embryo assay was done following the OECD guideline 236 and using a concentration 
range between 1.1 and 1.8 mg/L. Lethal and developmental endpoints such as hatching, 
edemas, malformations, heart rate, body growth and delays were assessed in a 96 hours 
exposure. A sub-teratogenic range (from 0.00016 to 0.5 mg/L) was then used to assess 
effects at biochemical and behavioural levels. Biochemical markers included 
cholinesterase (ChE), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and 
catalase (CAT) and were assessed at 96 hours. The locomotor behaviour was assessed 
using an automated video tracking system at 120 hours. Carbendazim showed high toxicity 
with a 96h-LC50 of 1.75 mg/L while sublethal effects such as hatching success, edemas, 
malformations, reduction of heart rate, body length and yolk sac consumption were 
observed with EC50s ranging from 0.85 to 1.6 mg/L. Carbendazim exposure significantly 
altered biochemical parameters by inducing Che, GST and LDH activities at 
concentrations equal or above 0.004 mg/L. The locomotor response of zebrafish embryos 
was also affected as observed by alterations in swimming activity of larvae even at the 
lowest tested concentration (0.00016 mg/L). In this work, locomotion showed to be several 
orders of magnitude more sensitive than developmental parameters or lethality, 
highlighting the potential of behavioural endpoints as early warning signs for 
environmental stress. Further studies should focus on understanding how the behavioural 
disturbances measured in these types of studies translate into fitness impairment at the 
adult stage.

Carbendazim effects on zebrafish embryos

1. Introduction 

Carbendazim (methyl-1-H-benzimidazol-2-yl-carbamate) is one of the most widely 

used benzimidazole fungicides. It has a high toxicity to target organisms, inhibiting the 

development of a wide variety of fungi even at low doses. It is used in agriculture, 

horticulture, forest and home gardening and as a preservative in paint, papermaking, 

textile, leather industry, as well as a preservative of fruits (Selmano?lu, G.Barlas, 

N.Songür, S.Koçkaya, 2001). Carbendazim is a metabolite of benomyl and it is known to 

target the tubulin in cells, causing disruption of microtubule assembly and cell division 

(Davidse, 1986).  Many studies have reported the adverse effects of carbendazim on 

mammals mainly on reproductive organs (Farag et al., 2011; Ireland et al., 1979; Lim and 

Miller, 1997; Nakai et al., 2002; Urani et al., 1995). Low concentrations of carbendazim 

ranging from 0.2 to 200 µg/L have already been detected in surface waters near agriculture 

and forestry areas (Palma et al., 2004; Readman et al., 1997). Moreover, carbendazim has 

shown to be very persistent in the water with a half-life of 6 to 25 weeks (Cuppen et al., 

2000a).  

Although some of the toxic effects of carbendazim have been studied in mammals, 

its effects on aquatic organisms are poorly studied. The majority of studies available focus 

on zooplankton and macroinvertebrate communities where chronic exposure to 

carbendazim negatively affected these populations by decreasing survival, reproduction 

and feeding rates (Cuppen et al., 2000b; Daam et al., 2010; Ferreira et al., 2008; Ribeiro et 

al., 2011; Van den Brink et al., 2000). To our knowledge, there are only two studies 

available concerning carbendazim effects on fish early life stages. The study by 

Ludwikowska et al. (2013) showed that carbendazim could affect the survival and hatching 

success of Prussian carp embryos at concentrations above 0.036 mg/L and the study of 

Jiang et al. (2014) demonstrated that embryonic exposure to carbendazim led to significant 

changes in the expression of genes related to apoptosis, immunotoxicity and endocrine 

disruption in zebrafish (Danio rerio). In this later study concentrations between 0.004 and 

0.5 mg/L of carbendazim were tested, although gene expression effects for most of the 

genes analyzed, did not follow a dose response pattern.  

Risk characterization is better achieved by studying chemical effects at several 

levels of biological organization. Recently, behavioural parameters such as locomotion 



Carbendazim effects on zebrafish embryos

(whose evaluation have been considered time consuming and lacking objectivity) have been 

increasingly used due to the development of technology for automated analysis. In the case 

of zebrafish, locomotion has been used as an endpoint to assess the neurotoxic effects of 

chemicals in early life stages (Irons et al., 2010; Padilla et al., 2011; Selderslaghs et al., 

2010) and the sublethal toxicity of pollutants (Ulhaq et al., 2013). In fact, many 

contaminants disrupt fish behaviour after exposures much less severe than those causing 

mortality as demonstrated by Klüver et al., (2015) where behaviour of fish embryos was 

altered at concentrations 375-fold lower than the LC10. Thus, behaviour has proven to 

provide very sensitive measures of stress exposure; furthermore it has high ecological 

relevance as effects can be translated in their long term health and survival (Scott and 

Sloman, 2004; Tierney, 2011).  

Thus, in this work we aim at assessing the effects of carbendazim at several levels 

of biological organization using zebrafish embryos as model organism. Recently, the 

approval of the OECD Test Guideline nº 236 (fish embryo toxicity test) has consolidated 

the zebrafish embryo test as a true alternative for the acute fish toxicity test with adults 

(Braunbeck et al., 2014a) in the European Union. This test has been increasingly used to 

assess the toxicity of chemicals and waste waters as reviewed by Scholz et al. (2013, 

2008). The low volume of test solutions needed (tests are deployed in 24 or 96-wells 

microplates), and the rapid development and transparency of embryos that allow the 

monitoring of the entire organogenesis are among the advantages of this test. Moreover, 

the possibility of measurement of behaviour (as referred above) and biochemical 

parameters such as AChE-acetylcholinesterase, GST – gluthatione-S-tranferase, LDH – 

lactate dehydrogenase, CAT - catalase (Oliveira et al., 2009), makes the zebrafish embryos 

a very good model to analyze effects of chemicals at several levels, providing 

complementary information on the mode of action of the chemicals (Braunbeck et al., 

2014b; Küster and Altenburger, 2008) ultimately contributing to understand and establish 

the Adverse Outcome Pathway – AOP - (a recent framework proposed by Ankle et al 

(2010) that directly link molecular-level initiating events that ultimately lead to adverse 

outcome at higher levels) for this fungicide. Once described, an AOP can be a key factor 

for hazard identification in the risk assessment of chemicals (Ankley et al., 2010; Volz et 

al., 2011). This is particularly important considering the urgent need to reduce animal use 

for toxicity testing in the European Union.  



Carbendazim effects on zebrafish embryos

Thus, in the present study, zebrafish embryos were used to assess the toxic effects 

of carbendazim at several levels: 

i)  survival,  

ii) developmental level (including embryo development delays and malformations),  

iv) biochemical level (including the measurement of the enzymes AChE, GST, 

LDH and CAT) and  

v) behavioural level (by measuring locomotion of zebrafish eleutheroembryos 

expressed either by distance moved or time spent moving) 

 

2. Materials and Methods 

2.1 Zebrafish maintenance and embryo collection 

All the embryos used in the present study were provided by the zebrafish facility 

established at the Department of Biology, University of Aveiro (Portugal). Adults were 

maintained in carbon-filtered water, complemented with 0.34 mg/L salt (“Instant Ocean 

Synthetic Sea Salt”, Spectrum Brands, USA) and automatically adjusted for pH and 

conductivity. Water temperature was kept at 26.0 ± 1 ºC, conductivity at 750 ± 50 µS, pH 

at 7.5 ± 0.5 and dissolved oxygen equal or above 95 % saturation. A 16:8 h (light:dark) 

photoperiod cycle was maintained. This reconstituted water was used in the preparation of 

test solutions of all assays performed. The above mentioned temperature and photoperiod 

conditions were constant in all assays. Zebrafish eggs were obtained by crossbreeding of 

individuals in aquaria; after 30 min of natural mating, eggs were rinsed in water and 

checked under a stereomicroscope (Stereoscopic Zoom Microscope -SMZ 1500, Nikon 

Corporation); those unfertilized, with cleavage irregularities, injuries or other kind of 

malformations were discarded.

2.2 Test Chemicals and Preparation of Test Solutions 

Carbendazim (Methyl 2-benzimidazolecarbamate, 97% purity) was purchased from 

Sigma-Aldrich. Carbendazim solutions were carefully prepared by dissolving carbendazim 

on the zebrafish water system. Ten millilitres of each tested concentration was sampled at 

the beginning and at the end of the assay and preserved at -20 ºC for further chemical 

analysis. The chemical analysis aimed to assess the degradation of carbendazim in the test 

solutions and was performed at Laboratory of Environmental Chemistry and Biochemistry, 

University of South Bohemia in ?eské Bud?jovice, Czech Republic.  

 

2.3 Embryo assay 

The assay was based on the OECD testing guideline 236 on Fish Embryo Acute 

Toxicity (FET) Test (OECD, 2013). The embryos (approximately 3 hpf) previously 

selected were exposed to carbendazim concentrations ranging from 1.1 to 1.8 mg/L. Ten 

eggs in triplicate per treatment were distributed individually in 24-wells microplates. Test 

run for 96 h. Embryos were daily observed under a stereomicroscope (Stereoscopic Zoom 

Microscope – SMZ 1500, Nikon Corporation, Japan) and the following parameters were 

evaluated: survival, somite formation, incidence of pericardial edema, heart beat, 

malformations (general, spinal, tail and head), hatching, body length (total length: snout to 

tail tip), yolk sac length and developmental delay. The heart beat (beats/15s) was measured 

by counting heart beats under a stereomicroscope in 3 randomly selected embryos of each 

replicate (n=9 per concentration) at 48 h. The body and yolk sac length was measured 

using digital images of the embryos with the software NIS Elements D (Nikon 

Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Development delay was obtained by matching the 

developmental stage of a given embryo with the developmental stages defined by Kimmel 

et al., (1995).  

A sublethal range of carbendazim concentrations (0.00016, 0.0008, 0.004, 0.020, 

0.1 and 0.5 mg/L) was used to set up the test for biochemical determinations and 

locomotory analysis. This test was deployed in the same conditions as the above described 

test. At 96 hours of exposure, 10 clusters of eight larvae per treatment were snap-frozen in 



Carbendazim effects on zebrafish embryos 

127 

 

microtubes containing 0.8 ml of K-phosphate buffer (0.1M, pH 7.4) and stored at - 80 º C 

for further enzymatic analysis (see section 2.4). For locomotory assay larvae were 

transferred to 96 well plates and analysed using the track system Zebrabox (Viewpoint, 

Lyon, France) at 120 h (see section 2.5).  

 

2.4 Biomarkers determinations 

Enzymatic assays were performed to analyse cholinesterase (ChE), glutathione-S-

transferase (GST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and catalase (CAT) in larvae of zebrafish. 

Enzymatic determinations were made spectrophotometrically (Thermo Scientific 

Multiskan Spectrum, USA) using 96 wells microplates. On the day of enzymatic analyses, 

samples were defrosted on ice, homogenised (KIKA Labortechnik U2005 Control) and 

centrifuged (4 ºC, 10000 g, 20 min) in order to isolate the post-mitochondrial supernatant 

(PMS) posteriorly used as enzyme extract for enzymatic activity determination.  

The methods for the determination of ChE, GST and LDH activity is described in 

Domingues et al. (2010). Briefly, ChE activity was determined at 414 nm according to the 

method of Ellman et al. (1961) adapted for microplate (Guilhermino et al., 1996). GST 

activity was performed at 340 nm as described by Habig and Jakoby (1981) adapted to 

microplate reader (Frasco and Guilhermino, 2002). The LDH activity was continuously 

monitored for 5 min at 340 nm, following the methodology described by Vassault (1983) 

with the modifications introduced by Diamantino et al. (2001). The CAT activity was 

measured at 240 nm in spectrophotometer quartz cell by monitoring the decrease of 

absorbance due to decomposition of H2O2, as described by Clairborne (1985). 

Protein quantification in samples was performed in quadruplicate according to the 

Bradford method (Bradford, 1976), at 595 nm, using ?- globulin to determine standard 

curve. Enzymatic activity units were expressed in nanomoles of substrate hydrolyzed per 

minute per mg of protein. A Labsystem Multiskan EX microplate (Labsystems Inc., 

Franklin, MA) reader was used to determine all protein and enzymatic activity.

2.5 Analysis of locomotor response  

Zebrafish larvae were used to assess the effects of carbendazim on locomotory 

activity.  At 120 hpf the embryos were removed from the exposure dishes and placed in 96 

well plates (one per well). Locomotion was evaluated for 12 embryos per treatment in 

triplicate including the control. Prior to the assessment of behaviour, dead larvae or larvae 

that exhibited physical abnormalities were discarded and not included in analyses. 

Embryonic movement was tracked using the Zebrabox (Viewpoint, Lyon, France) tracking 

system using a 25 frame per second infrared camera over a period of 50 min. The 

temperature was maintained stable at 26 ± 1 ºC. Movement was stimulated by applying 

light:dark intervals according to what was previously described in Irons et al (2010).  

Briefly, the test consisted of acclimating the embryos in the light for 10 min, followed by a 

cycle of four alternating periods of light:dark intervals (10 min dark; 10 min ligth; 10 min 

dark; 10 min ligth). Typically zebrafish larvae show less locomotion during light periods 

and more during dark. For each replicate the distances moved in 2-minute time intervals 

were recorded separately for each dark and light period.  

In this study the following parameters were calculated for each time interval except 

acclimation period that was not included in the analysis: total distance moved, relative 

small and large distance moved and relative swimming time. The total distance consists of 

the total swimming distance of the larvae during each measurement period. The relative 

small distance (%) is the ratio between small distance moved and total distance moved in 

each 10 min period. The relative large distance (%) is the ratio between large distance and 

the total distance moved in each measurement period. Finally, the relative swimming time 

refers to the time embryos spend moving (swimming) relative to the total measurement 

period. A threshold of 30 was used for background correction and a movement was 

considered “small” when individuals moved less than 0.5 mm/sec.

2.6. Determination of Carbendazim in water using liquid chromatography-tandem 

mass spectrometry 

2.6.1. Chemicals 

Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) grade methanol and 

acetonitrile (Li Chrosolv Hypergrade) were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). 

Formic acid used to acidify the mobile phases was purchased from Labicom (Olomouc, 

Czech Republic). Ultra-pure water was produced using an Aqua-MAX-Ultra System 

(Younglin, Kyounggi-do, Korea). All compounds used were analytical standards or of high 

purity (&gt; 98%). 13C6 labeled trimethoprim was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Inc. 

(Andover, MA, USA) and it was used as internal standard because it has quite similar 

retention time as carbendazim (elution time is 4.98 min for carbendazim and 5.35 min for 

labeled trimethoprim). 

Stock solutions of carbendazim and labeled trimethoprim were prepared in 

methanol at a concentration of 1 mg·mL-1 and stored at -20°C. A spiking mixture was 

prepared for each compound by diluting stocks in methanol to concentration of 1 ?g/mL 

and stored at -20°C. 

 

2.6.2. LC-MS/MS analysis 

 A triple stage quadrupole MS/MS TSQ Quantum Ultra mass spectrometer (Thermo 

Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA) coupled with an Accela 1250 LC pump (Thermo 

Fisher Scientific) and an HTS XT-CTC autosampler (CTC Analytics AG, Zwingen, 

Switzerland) was used for analysis of carbendazim in water samples. Thawed water 

samples were filtered through a syringe filter (0.45 ?m, regenerated cellulose, Labicom, 

Olomouc, Czech Republic), after that 10 ng of internal standard was added to 1 mL of 

sample. 

An analytical Cogent Bidentate C18 column (50 mm x 2.1 mm ID x 4 µm particles, 

Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for chromatographic separation of the target analytes. 

Ionization of targeted compounds was carried out with heated electrospray ionization 

(HESI). The spray voltage was 3.5 kV. Nitrogen (purity &gt; 99.999%) was used as the sheath 

gas (40 arbitrary units), auxiliary gas (10 arbitrary units) and collision gas. The vaporizer 



Carbendazim effects on zebrafish embryos 

130 

 

was heated to 250°C and the capillary to 350°C. Chromatographic separation of targeted 

analytes was provided with acidified acetonitrile/ultrapure water gradient presented in the 

Table S1 (Supplementary data). 

Two product ions from carbendazim 192?159, used for quantification, and 

192?131, used for qualification, were monitored in positive ion mode during analysis. 

Developed method was validated in the range of tested concentrations. The method 

showed good linearity in the concentration range from 0.001 to 1 mg/L for carbendazim 

with R2=0.998. Recovery of carbendazim from aquaria water was evaluated by spiking 

water samples with the target compound. Recovery value for carbendazim was 100%. The 

average carbendazim limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.00016 mg/L and was calculated 

as one quarter of the lowest calibration point in the calibration curve where relative 

standard deviation of average response factor was &amp;lt;30%. 

Matrix-matched standard response was used as factors for correcting the response 

derived from the calibration curve. Matrix-matched standard was prepared from tested 

water blank by spiking with both internal standard and native compound at 0.01 mg/L and 

1 mg/L, respectively. 

 

2.7 Statistical analysis 

Lethal concentration (LCx) and effect concentration (ECx) values were calculated 

for each endpoint by fitting dose-response curves using the package drc in the software R 

(R Core Team, 2014). For locomotor behaviour a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) 

was used to test differences between the different treatments among each of the light dark 

interval, except the acclimation period that was not included in the analysis. In the case 

datasets failed the normality and homoscedasticity test, an ANOVA on ranks (Kruskall-

Wallis) was performed. When significant, differences were further explored with 

appropriate post hoc test (Dunnet’s or Dunn’s) to compare each treatment against control. 

Test statistics and analysis of normality were conducted using the software SigmaPlot 

V.12.5 (SysStat, San Jose, California, USA). A significance level of 0.05 was used to infer 

statistically significant results. The relationship between the different 

treatments/concentrations of carbendazin and the overall behavioural and biochemical 

endpoints was investigated by a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Behavioural and 



Carbendazim effects on zebrafish embryos 

131 

 

biomarkers data were standardized (scaled into 0-1 range), in order to be used in the same 

ordination plot. PCA was performed using CANOCO 4.5 software (Lepš and Šmilauer, 

2003). 

3. Results 

3.1 Stability of carbendazim in the exposure medium 

Chemical analysis of the exposure media showed stable exposure concentrations 

and within 80 – 120% of the nominal concentrations in what refers the FET test (1.1 – 1.8 

mg/L). However, analysis of the exposure media of the sublethal range of concentrations 

(0.00016 – 0.5 mg/L) revealed some inconsistencies (Table S1, Supplementary data) 

probably because the tested concentrations were very close to the limit of quantification.  

3.2 Effects on embryos development 

The calculated LC50 and EC50 values for zebrafish embryos exposed to 

carbendazim are presented in Table 1. Carbendazim showed to be moderate to highly toxic 

to zebrafish embryos as can be observed in Fig S1, with a 96 h-LC50 of 1.76 mg/L (Table 

1).

Carbendazim effects on zebrafish embryos

Carbendazim also affected the development of embryos by triggering a series of 

developmental anomalies including the incidence of edema, spine, head and tail 

deformities and also reducing heart rate, body length and the rate of consumption of the 

yolk sac. Although carbendazim did not cause significant mortality at 24 hpf, embryos 

exposed to concentrations above 1.3 mg/L exhibited developmental anomalies such as tail 

and spine deformities presenting an EC50 of 1.48 mg/L (Table 1). At 48 hpf an increment in 

the frequency of edemas and spine curvature was observed with a EC50 of 1.26 mg/L and 

1.53 mg/L respectively (Table 1, Fig S2 a and b). Moreover, carbendazim induced a 

significant reduction in heart beat rate affecting even embryos exposed to the lowest 

concentration of 1 mg/L. Embryos exposed to control exhibited a heart beat around 180 

beats/min while embryos exposed to the highest concentrations presented a heart beat rate 

around 100 beats/min (Table 1, Fig S2 c).  

At 72 hpf besides the increase in malformations, carbendazim reduced hatching rate 

in exposed embryos. The calculated 72 h-EC50 was 1.57 mg/L (Table 1, Fig S3 a). 

Concerning body anomalies the calculated 72 h-EC50 were 1.52, 1.52 and 1.46 respectively 

for head, tail and spine deformities (Table 1, Fig 3). The most important anomalies found 

were head and eye malformation, and spine curvature as can be observed in Fig 1 A-F. 

Moreover, carbendazim caused an increase in edema formation (mainly pericardial edema, 

see Fig S3 b and Fig 1 B, C and D) and the calculated 72 h-EC50 was 1.24 mg/L.  

The same effects described above were still observed at 96 hpf (Fig S4), including 

hatching (96 h-EC50 =1.62 mg/L) where only around 50% of embryos exposed to 

carbendazim concentrations above 1.5 mg/L have hatched (Fig S4 a) and head, tail and 

spine deformities (96 h-EC50 = 1.53, 1.54 and 1.46 respectively) as can be observed in 

Table 1, Fig S4 b, d and f and Fig 1 G-I.  In relation to pericardial edema embryos exposed 

to concentrations above 1 mg/L were severely affected (96 h-EC50 = 1.08 mg/L, Table 1, 

Fig S4 c). In addition, carbendazim significantly affected body and yolk sac length of 

embryos as can be observed in Table 1 and Fig. S4 e. The body length of embryos 

decreased as carbendazim concentrations increased and embryos were affected even in the 

lowest concentration tested. The body length of control embryos was around 3.5 mm while 

exposed embryos showed body length around 3.0 mm. In contrast a significant increase 

was observed in yolk sac length in concentrations above 1.30 mg/L which may be related 

to a delay in the consumption of the yolk.

3.3 Biomarkers 

The effects of carbendazim on the activities of biomarkers ChE, GST, LDH and 

CAT, are presented in Figure 2. Exposure to carbendazim significantly induced ChE (F6, 

34= 5.18; P= 0.001), GST (F6, 28= 10.59; P&amp;lt;0.001) and LDH (H= 20.70; P=0.002) activities 

at concentrations ? 0.004 mg/L when compared to control group (Fig 2 a-c). Regarding 

CAT activity, although a slightly decrease in activity was observed at concentration below 

0.004 mg/L, no statistically significant differences were observed (F6, 33= 1.36; P=0.268).

3.4 Behavioural changes: locomotor response 

Results within the two periods of light and within the two periods of dark tested were very 

similar and thus, here, only the results of the first dark and light periods will be presented 

(Fig 3). Carbendazim induced changes in the locomotor activity of zebrafish larvae at 120 

hpf. Fig. 3 a-b shows the results for total distance moved (mm) in the dark and in the light 

period. During the dark period, no statistical differences were found on any treatment when 

compared to control although the One way Anova revealed an effect of carbendazim (H= 

16.49; P= 0.011). On the other hand, during the light period a significant (F= 2.13; P= 

0.002) decrease in the distance moved was observed at concentration above 0.0008 mg/L 

(Fig 3 b).

Carbendazim effects on zebrafish embryos 

137 

 

Small and large distances are complementary parameters as can be seen in Fig 3 c 

and e and d and f. Although an effect was observed for these parameters, they do not 

present a dose-response pattern. Generally, in the dark periods, organisms exposed to 

intermediate concentrations of carbendazim presented lower percentages of small distance 

movements (and higher % of large distance movements) when compared to control, Fig 3 c 

and e. In the light period only organisms exposed to the highest concentration presented a 

differentiated behaviour compared to control, translated by a decreased percentage of small 

distance movements (and increased % of large distance movement), Fig 3 d and f.  In 

relation to the relative swimming time, larvae exposed to carbendazim presented a longer 

swimming time when compared to control group in both dark (F= 27.44; P=&amp;lt;0.001) and 

light (H= 47.30; P=&amp;lt;0.001) (Fig 3 g-h). This effect was concentrations dependent and 

differences could be perceived even at the lowest concentrations tested either for dark or 

for light periods. 

 

3.5 PCA 

In the PCA related to the light period (Figure 4-A), the first two ordination axes 

explained 72.2% of the total variation. The primary axis represented 55.4% of the variation 

and described an increase on the activity of all the measured biomarkers and also 

swimming time (ST) along with the decrease of total swimming distance (TD). Higher 

enzymatic activity and longer swimming time are related with higher concentration of 

carbendazim, while control samples and lower concentrations of the chemical are related 

with greater swimming distance. The second axis explained a variation of 16.8% and 

described a gradient of increasing percentage of long distance swimming but there was no 

clear pattern between these behaviour parameter and carbendazim concentrations.     

The PCA for the Dark period (Figure 4-B) presented an overall similar pattern. The 

first two axes represented 75.0% of the total observed variation. Primary variation captured 

53.1% of the global variation and described an increase of the enzymatic activity, followed 

by swimming time (ST). Again, the increase of these parameters is associated to higher 

concentrations of carbendazim.  Secondary axis, that explains 21.9% of the total variation, 



Carbendazim effects on zebrafish embryos 

138 

 

describes an increase in both total distance (TD) and large distance percentage (LD), but 

without a clear relationship with carbendazim concentrations.     

 

 

Fig. 4 – Biplot of the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) performed on different concentrations of 
carbendazim (symbols). The ordination was made in relation to behaviour endpoints TD (Total distance), LD 
(Large distance) and ST (Swimming time) and biochemical (GST, LDH, ChE, CAT) response variables 
(arrows). 

 

4. Discussion 

Our study revealed effects of carbendazim at developmental, biochemical and 

behavioural levels. Lethality of carbendazim to zebrafish embryos did not increase with 

time and was fully established after 48 h of exposure. This is probably due to the mode of 

action of carbendazim that inhibits the assembly of tubulin and the formation of 

microtubules in fungi, and also in mammals (Davidse, 1986; Ireland et al., 1979; Lim and 

Miller, 1997). For instance, the lethal effects of carbendazim in Clawed frog (Xenopus 

laevis) at 4-cell stage embryos proved to be higher than in embryos exposed later in 

blastula stage as concluded by Yoon et al., (2008). In our study, zebrafish embryos were 

exposed as early as 2 - 3 hpf and possibly, the establishment of toxicity at the first 48 h is 

the result of carbendazim inhibition of microtubule assembly and mitosis in the early 

embryonic stages. One of the few studies conducted in fish early life stages available also 

demonstrated that carbendazim strongly affected survival of Prussian carp (Carassius 

gibelio) embryos by causing 100% of mortality after 24 h of exposure to 0.216 mg/L 



Carbendazim effects on zebrafish embryos 

139 

 

(Ludwikowska et al., 2013). Fingerlings of Milkfish (Chanos chanos) exposed to 

carbendazim showed a 96 h-LC50 of 0.013 mg/L (Palanikumar et al., 2014) which is very 

low compared to the one found in this study for zebrafish embryos (1.75 mg/L). Another 

study conducted in Tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) alevins showed a 96 h-LC50 of 

4.16 mg/L (Rico et al., 2011).  

Furthermore, carbendazim exposure strongly affected the development of embryos 

by triggering a series of developmental anomalies (spine curvature, head deformity), 

decreasing heart rate and body length; increasing pericardial edemas and delaying yolk sac 

consumption and hatching. This is consistent with studies conducted in amphibian (Yoon 

et al., 2008) and rodent embryos (Farag et al., 2011) where carbendazim showed to be 

teratogen increasing the incidence of malformations such as pericardial edema, spinal 

lordosis, elongated heart, narrowed head among others. The body length of Clawed frog 

(X. laevis) exposed to carbendazim were also shown to be significantly shorter at 

concentrations ? 0.38 mg/L (Yoon et al., 2008). A previous study carried out with the 

parent compound of carbendazim (benomyl) in zebrafish embryos also showed to decrease 

hatching and heart rate and increase incidence of malformations  causing the same type of 

anomalies observed in our study in concentrations as low as 30 µg/L (Kim et al., 2009).  

Regarding the effects of carbendazim on biomarkers, a significant induction of 

ChE, GST and LDH activities was observed in exposed embryos. To the best of our 

knowledge, there is no study available which describes alterations in the enzymatic activity 

in zebrafish embryos caused by carbendazim. AChE plays an important role in 

neurotransmission being responsible for the hydrolysis of acetyltiocholine at the 

cholinergic synapses and neuromuscular junction (Olsen et al., 2001). In addition, several 

studies have pointed out evidences of AChE being involved in other physiological process 

including the participation in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis as reviewed 

by Jiang &amp;amp; Zhang (2008). A recent study conducted in zebrafish has demonstrated that 

embryonic exposure to different carbendazim concentrations ranging from 0.004 to 0.5 

mg/L lead to significant changes in the expressions of many genes that play critical roles 

during cell apoptosis (Jiang et al., 2014). However, the mechanisms that regulate AChE 

expression and participation in apoptosis are not fully understood yet (Soreq and Seidman, 

2001; Zhang et al., 2002). Considering apoptosis is related to up regulation of 

acetylcholinesterase genes (Zhang et al., 2002), the overexpression of ChE activity in 



Carbendazim effects on zebrafish embryos 

140 

 

zebrafish embryos observed in our study is probably linked to carbendazim potential to 

induce cell apoptosis. 

GST activity was also induced after exposure to carbendazim. GST represent a 

family of enzymes with a central role in the biotransformation of xenobiotics and 

endogenic compounds and their activity can be enhanced in response to xenobiotics which 

make them a stress indicator that have been increasingly used as an environmental 

biomarker (Hyne and Maher, 2003). GST induction has also been observed following 

carbendazim and benomyl exposure (parent compound of carbendazim) in a midge species 

(Kiefferulus calligaster) and in adult Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) (Domingues et 

al., 2009; Min and Kang, 2008) respectively. 

Similarly, LDH activity was induced in embryos exposed to carbendazim. LDH is a 

key enzyme in the anaerobic pathway of energy production and is involved in the 

carbohydrate metabolism (Diamantino et al., 2001). Increased LDH activity levels have 

been observed in conditions of chemical stress when high levels of energy are required as 

demonstrated in Nile tilapia exposed to benomyl, the parent compound of carbendazim 

(Min and Kang, 2008). It is possible that a metabolic hypoxia due to detoxification process 

increases the anaerobic pathways causing the LDH induction. Our results showed no effect 

of carbendazim in the activity of CAT, indicating that the antioxidant response was not 

activated. This agrees with the current knowledge since oxidative stress is not pointed out 

as a mechanism of action of carbendazim.  

In our study, the locomotor response of zebrafish embryos was sensitive to the 

effects of embryonic exposure to carbendazim as observed by alterations in swimming 

activity of larvae even at the lowest tested concentration (0.00016 mg/L). Organisms 

exposed to carbendazim, spent more time swimming, either in the dark as in the light 

period. However, in both cases the increment of time spent swimming was not translated in 

an increment of the distance moved (meaning that organisms swam slower). In the light 

periods, unexpectedly, the total distance moved even decreased, suggesting that fish were 

not able to swim at their regular speed probably due to energy depletion or energy 

allocated to other physiological processes to cope with chemical stress or due to 

developmental impairment in key processes for the locomotion. To our knowledge the only 

study available concerning carbendazim effects on fish behaviour is the recent study 

conducted in juveniles of the African sharptooth catfish (Claria gariepinus). Fish exposed 



Carbendazim effects on zebrafish embryos 

141 

 

to sublethal concentrations of carbendazim (0.22 – 0.43 mg/L) showed abnormal 

behavioural responses such as spiral swimming, hyperactivity, frequent surfacing to gulp 

water, jerky movement and loss of equilibrium. The authors attributed this altered 

behaviour to the toxic action of carbendazim and its effect on the nervous system of 

exposed fish (Nwani et al., 2015).  

Behaviour effects measured as swimming time, are associated in the PCA, to the 

biochemical parameters ChE, GST and LDH. While ChE is probably involved in apoptose 

mechanism as suggested above, the GST and LDH, being general biomarkers of chemical 

and environmental stress, suggest that the metabolic cost involved on detoxification 

processes may be compromising other important functions such as behaviour including the 

locomotor response of zebrafish larvae. Results of previous study in fish exposed to copper 

related the partitioning of energy utilization (between metabolism maintenance and 

locomotion) to altered fish behaviour (Handy et al., 1999), corroborating this hypothesis.  

Changes on fish behaviour may also be caused by disruption of the hormonal 

system. Many studies have shown the correlations between endocrine disruption and 

abnormal behaviour in fish (Bell, 2001; Clotfelter et al., 2004; Sárria et al., 2011). 

Actually, behaviour has been proposed as an endpoint in the environmental risk assessment 

of endocrine disrupter chemicals (Sárria et al., 2011). As demonstrated by Jiang et al., 

(2014) carbendazim had the potential to induce endocrine disruption in zebrafish embryo. 

Their results showed that carbendazim exposure caused down regulation of estrogen 

receptors and also decreased vitellogenin (used as a biomarker indicator of endocrine 

disruption) expression at concentrations as low as 0.004 mg/L. The altered locomotor 

behaviour of zebrafish larvae observed in our study which used a similar range of 

carbendazim concentrations as Jiang and colleagues (0.004 – 0.5 mg/L),  may also be 

correlated to the effects of carbendazim on the endocrine system. However, our results 

showed that carbendazim affects behaviour even at lower concentrations (0.00016 mg/L).

effects of carbendazim in Danio rerio embryos. Values between brackets are Lowest Observed 
Effect Concentrations (LOEC). 

 

From an ecological point of view, the alterations in the swimming behaviour 

(which were observed at environmental relevant concentrations) can have important 

consequences for the fitness of the organisms as they can further originate feeding 

disruption (capability to capture prey) and increase vulnerability to predation (through an 

inability to remain inconspicuous) among other processes which may poses serious risks to 

the success of fish populations (Little and Finger, 1990). From Fig 5, which summarizes 

the Lowest Observed Effect Concentrations of the several endpoints analyzed in this work, 

one can easily observe that behavioural endpoints are several orders of magnitude more 

sensitive than developmental parameters and thus have the potential to work as an early 

warning signal for environmental stress. Further studies should focus on understanding 

how the behavioural disturbances measured translate into fitness impairment at the adult 

stage.

5. Conclusion 

To our knowledge, this was the first study to evaluate the effects of carbendazim at 

developmental, biochemical and behavioural levels in zebrafish early life stages. Data 

showed that carbendazim affects embryos survival and development causing a series of 

anomalies including pericardial edemas, body and tail deformities, decreased heart rate and 

body length among others. At the sublethal level, carbendazim induced alterations in ChE, 

GST and LDH activities. And at behaviour level caused increase in swimming times, but 

not increased swimming distances. Locomotory behaviour showed to be several orders of 

magnitude more sensitive that developmental parameters or lethality, highlighting the 

potential of behavioural endpoints as early warning signs for environmental stress. Since 

behavioural endpoints may translate in ecological relevant effects such as feeding 

behaviour of antipredatory behaviour disruption, these findings corroborate the importance 

of the emergent field of behavioural ecotoxicology as a relevant approach in ecological 

risk assessment strategies.

Aquatic Toxicology 

 

Abstract 

There are strong evidences that the climate is globally changing.  These changes are 
expected to modify water quality mainly by alterations in environmental parameters such 
as temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen. Slight shifts in these environmental factors may 
compromise the physiological performance of aquatic organisms and their capacity of 
response to additional stress.  In natural systems, organisms are very often are forced to 
cope with environmental and chemical stress simultaneously. Understanding how the 
environmental changes may determine the physiological response of aquatic life and 
interact with contaminants, must be considered in risk assessment. Therefore, in the 
present study, we aimed at assessing the joint effects of pH (acid and alkaline) and carbaryl 
to zebrafish embryos.In ecotoxicology, the prediction of combined effects is normally 
based on the effects of the individual components of the mixture by using the well-known 
pharmacological concepts of concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA). The 
toxicity of the binary combination was determined using the fish embryo toxicity test with 
zebrafish. Results showed that for the acid range the observed mixture toxicity was rather 
well predicted by CA. The median lethal concentration (LC50) of the mixture was predicted 
with an error of only 8%. Considering the alkaline range, both concepts underestimate the 
LC50 by a factor of 3 for CA and by a factor of 4.6 for IA. The increased toxicity of the 
combination of alkaline pH and carbaryl was likely due to the hydrolysis of carbaryl at 
elevated pH values generating the more toxic product 1-naphthol. Our results highlight the 
necessity of incorporating the effects of environmental factors such as pH in risk 
assessment procedures, in order to avoid underestimation of effects and adequately protect 
aquatic organisms. 

Keywords: carbamate pesticides, Danio rerio, concentration addition, independent action, 
mixtures. 



  Influence of pH on the toxicity of carbaryl

1. Introduction  

Currently, for the risk assessment of chemicals, aquatic toxicity tests are conducted 

according to established standard protocols where physicochemical – temperature, pH and 

etc. – conditions are maintained stable according to requirements for a given test species. 

Moreover, the risk management primarily focuses on the assessment of single/individual 

stressors while in the environment organisms are rather exposed to multiple mixtures of 

stressors (Altenburger and Greco, 2009). Furthermore, the problematic of climate change 

and global warming raises the idea that organism and biological systems may have to cope 

with multiple stressors including nonchemical adverse factors such as unfavorable pH, 

temperature and salinity in combination with chemical stress.  

pH is one of the most determinant parameters for any chemical reaction and has 

been pointed out as the most important factor conditioning survival and fitness of many 

freshwater species. Variations in pH showed to have a significant impact on survival, 

hatching success, reproduction, pigmentation, swimming performance behaviour and body 

chemistry of both fish and invertebrate aquatic species (Fromm, 1980; Haines, 1981; 

Havas and Rosseland, 1995; Ikuta et al., 2000; Jordahl and Benson, 1987; Lechleitner et 

al., 1985; Okland and Okland, 1986; Ye and Randall, 1991). The effects of pH on the 

toxicity of chemical stressors have also been explored in the past decades, however, the 

majority of studies focuses mainly on metals and phenols toxicity (Bervoets and Blust, 

2000; Dave, 1985; Dietrich and Schlatter, 1989; Grosell et al., 2006; Reader et al., 1989; 

Stouthart et al., 1996). Nevertheless, the toxicity of pesticides is also affected by pH 

(Mayer and Ellersieck, 1986) and only few studies evaluating the combined effects of these 

two stressors are available.  

Mayer &amp;amp; Ellersieck (1986) reviewed the effects of pH and other physicochemical 

factors on chemical toxicity and reported that of any toxicity modifying factor tested, pH 

caused the greatest average change in chemical toxicity (in 96 h-LC50’s). According to the 

studies reviewed, the toxicity of pesticides tended to increase due to the formation of more 

toxic hydrolysis products at high pH as in the specific case of mexacarbate zectarn, which 

was found to be 38 times more toxic at pH 9.5. Therefore, the effects of physicochemical 

factors such as pH, should be considered in hazard assessment in order to assess risk 

accurately and protect aquatic biota avoiding under or overestimation of effects. Within

this context, the present study aimed at investigating the influence of pH (acid and 

alkaline) on the toxicity of carbaryl to zebrafish embryos. 

In aquatic toxicology, our current understanding of mixture toxicity is adopted from 

pharmacology and it is based on the concepts of concentration addition (CA) (Loewe and 

Muischnek, 1926) and independent action (IA) (Bliss, 1939). These two concepts are based 

on the assumption that the composition of the mixture is known and are capable of 

predicting the toxicity of the mixture from the toxicity of the individual components 

(Altenburger and Greco, 2009). The concept of CA has been introduced by Loewe &amp;amp; 

Muischnek (1926) and is based on the assumption that the components of a given mixture 

act in the same way, by the same mechanisms (Groten, 2000). CA is mathematically 

expressed as: 

= 1 

where  is the number of mixture components,  is the concentration of the th 

mixture component that provokes x% of effect when applied singly, and  is the 

concentration of the respective component in the mixture. In contrast, the concept of IA is 

based on the idea that the compounds of a given mixture/combination have dissimilar 

modes of action and is mathematically expressed as follows: 

( ) = ( + ? + ) = 1 ? [1 ? ( )] 

where ( ) denotes the predicted effect (scaled from 0 to 1) of an -compound 

mixture,  is the concentration of the th compound, and ( ) is the effect of that 

concentration if the stressor is applied singly.  

Both concepts have been extensively used to study binary and multiple mixtures of 

various chemicals, using different organisms and endpoints demonstrating their predictive 

power (Altenburger et al., 2000; Backhaus et al., 2000; Deneer, 2000; Kortenkamp, 2007). 

For example, in the study of Altenburger et al., (2000), CA has been successfully used to 

predict the toxicity of 16 similarly and specifically acting chemicals and showed to have an

excellent predictive power. Likewise, independent action showed to have an excellent 

predictive power when used to predict the toxicity of chemicals with dissimilar modes of 

action (Backhaus et al., 2000; Faust et al., 2003). In this study, these two concepts were 

used to predict the combined toxicity of pH (acid or alkaline) and carbaryl to zebrafish 

embryos and to detect deviations to the expected toxicity. 

2. Materials and Methods 

2.1 Test organisms 

All the organisms (zebrafish embryos) used in this study were obtained from the 

zebrafish facility established at the Department of Biology, University of Aveiro 

(Portugal). Adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were maintained in a ZebTEC (Tecniplast, 

Buguggiate, Italy) recirculating system. Culture water was obtained through reverse 

osmosis and activated carbon filtration of tap water, complemented with 0.34 mg/L salt 

(“Instant Ocean Synthetic Sea Salt”, Spectrum Brands, USA) and automatically adjusted 

for pH and conductivity. Water temperature was 26.0 ± 1 ºC, conductivity 750 ± 50 µS, pH 

7.5 ± 0.5 and dissolved oxygen equal or above 95 % saturation. A 16:8 h (light:dark) 

photoperiod cycle was maintained. The adult fish were fed twice a day with commercially 

available artificial diet (ZM-400 fish food; Zebrafish Management Ltd) and brine shrimp. 

Eggs were obtained by breeding of fish in aquaria. The eggs collected were rinsed in water 

and checked under a stereomicroscope (Stereoscopic Zoom Microscope-SMZ 1500, Nikon 

Corporation). Eggs with cleavage irregularities, injuries or other kind of malformations 

were discarded.  

All tests were performed similar as described in the OECD testing guideline 236 

(OECD, 2013), in charcoal filtered and deionised water supplemented with 0.34 mg/L  sea 

salt (see above) at 26 ± 1 ºC and a 16:8 h (light:dark) photoperiod.  Exposure was 

conducted from 3 to 96 hpf.

2.2 pH effects on zebrafish embryos  

In order to derive concentration response curves, zebrafish embryos were exposed 

to acid pH ranging from 3 to 7 (0.1 to 1000 µM of H3O+) and to alkaline pH ranging from 

8 to 12 (1 to 1000 µM of OH-). A set of buffers in concentrations ranging from 17- to 64-

fold below concentrations that cause mortality (Fig S1, Supplementary Data (‘S’ before the 

number indicates that the figure or table respectively is provided in the ‘supplementary 

information’)) were used to prevent pH drifts during the assay (Table S1). HCl and NaOH 

(1.0 N) solutions were used for pH adjustment; a portable multiparameter device 

(ProfiLine Multi 332) was used for pH measurements. Test solutions were daily renewed. 

Embryos were exposed individually in 24-well plates for 96 h. For each test 10 embryos 

were used per replica and a minimum of 3 replicates were used per treatment. Survival was 

observed and registered daily until the end of the test.  

 

2.3 Carbaryl effects on zebrafish embryos 

To also derive concentration response curves for carbaryl, zebrafish embryos at 3 

hpf were exposed to eight concentrations of 1, 1.6, 2.6, 4.3, 7.0, 11.4, 18.5 and 30 mg/L. 

Ten eggs per treatment were distributed in 24-wells microplates in triplicate and run for 

96h. Embryos were observed daily under a stereomicroscope (Stereoscopic Zoom 

Microscope – SMZ 1500, Nikon Corporation, Japan). Survival was evaluated daily until 

the end of the assay at 96 h.  

 

2.4 Combined exposure to carbaryl and pH 

Once the LC50 values were calculated for the single exposures (pH and carbaryl 

separately), the mixture experiments were conducted following a fixed ratio design. For 

this, pH was converted into concentrations of ions H3O+ for acid and OH- for alkaline 

range. Therefore, the two stressors were mixed in a ratio corresponding to 50:50% of 

effect. The mixture ratio was kept constant and the total concentration of the mixture was 



  Influence of pH on the toxicity of carbaryl 

165 

 

varied in order to describe experimentally the complete concentration-response 

relationship of the mixture. For acid range only the MES buffer (4 mM) was used to avoid 

pH drifts likewise, for basic range, only CAPS buffer (22 mM) was used (please refer to 

Supplementary data). We aimed at using one buffer for the acid and one buffer for the 

basic pH range - albeit the buffers may have a limiting buffer capacity in part of the pH 

range (in order to avoid drifts, the test solutions were daily renewed). The advantage of 

using one buffer is that in mixture analysis and modelling only one buffer component 

would need to be considered. In order to discard any interference of the buffers on the 

combinations of acidic or alkaline pH and carbaryl, the tests were repeated using  buffers 

concentrations 10 times higher (40 mM for MES and 220 mM for CAPS). Results are 

presented in the supplementary data Figs S2. The zebrafish embryos to the combinations 

followed the described in section 2.2 (pH effects on zebrafish embryos).  

2.5-1-naphtol effects on embryos survival 

1-naphthol is the major hydrolysis product of carbaryl. As it has been proved that 

carbaryl is highly susceptible to hydrolysis, we also tested the effects of 1-naphthol in 

zebrafish embryos in order to better understand the combined effects of pH and carbaryl. 

Zebrafish embryos at 3 hpf were exposed to 1-naphthol concentrations ranging from 0.38 

to 30 mg/L following the same procedure described in the section 2.3 (Carbaryl effects on 

zebrafish embryos).  

2.6 Chemical analysis: analysis of carbaryl concentrations at different pH’s 

In order to check the stability of carbaryl under acidic and alkaline pH, chemical 

analysis of the exposure medium were carried out. Ten millilitres of each combined 

treatment were sampled at 0 and 24 h and preserved at -20 ºC until chemical analysis. The 

analyses were performed at Laboratory of Environmental Chemistry and Biochemistry, 

University of South Bohemia in ?eské Bud?jovice, Czech Republic. The results are 

presented in supplementary data (Table S2).

2.7 Data analysis 

Buffer LC50s could only be calculated for CAPS and CHES. For all other buffers 

tested the low mortality rates up to concentrations at the solubility limit did not allow 

obtaining LC50 values. For these buffers an ANOVA (one-way analysis of variance) with 

appropriate post hoc test (Dunnett’s or Dunn’s test) were conducted to potentially derive 

LOEC or NOEC values. The type of ANOVA (parametric or non-parametric) and post hoc 

test was chosen depending on whether normality and homocedasticity of data were 

demonstrated by analysis of the residuals with the Shapiro-Wilks test.  

The concentration-response relationships of the single stressors as well as of the 

combinations were obtained by fitting dose-response curves using the software SigmaPlot 

V.12.5 (SysStat, San Jose, California,USA). Model choice decision was made based on the 

the R2 and the estimated residual standard error. The concentration response relationships 

as well as the statistics and analysis of normality were conducted using the software 

SigmaPlot V.12.5 (SysStat, San Jose, California,USA) and a significance level of 0.05. 

 

2.7.1 Prediction of mixture toxicities 

For the prediction of mixture toxicity the two well-known conceptual models CA 

and IA were used. The calculation of the mixture effects followed the procedures described 

in Backhaus et al 2000 and Altenburger et al 2000. To calculate the predictions by CA 

model, equation 1 was used as a starting point. As the ratio of the mixture components 

(H3O+/OH- and carbaryl) is quantitatively known, the concentration of each component can 

be expressed as a fraction of the total concentration ( ).  Consequently, by rearranging 

Equation 1, the effect concentrations predicted by CA can be calculated as follows:  

 

=  (3) 



  Influence of pH on the toxicity of carbaryl 

167 

 

 

Where  is the total concentration of the mixture provoking x% of effect and 

 denotes de fraction of component  in the mixture. Using Equation 3, the total 

concentrations of each mixture giving 1.5 to 99% effect were calculated and the resulting 

concentration/effect pairs were connected by straight lines, providing a visualization of the 

predicted concentration-response curve.   

To calculate the mixture effects according to independent action, Equation 2 was 

rearranged so that the concentration response relationships  of the two individual 

components of the mixture could be used to calculate their effects ( ) as follows: 

 

( ) =  1 ? [1 ? ( )] = 1 ? [1 ? ( )] 

 

Again, the individual components of the mixture can be expressed as fractions, , 

of the total concentration, , therefore, the overall effect of the mixture concentration 

can be calculated by rearranging Equation 4 as follows:  

( ) = 1 ?  [1 ? ( )] = 1 ? [1 ? ( . )] 

 

Using equation 5, the total concentration of the mixture provoking up to 100% of 

effect was calculated. The calculated concentration/effect pairs were connected by straight 

lines, providing a graphical representation of the predicted concentration response 

relationship of the mixture predicted by independent action. To calculate an arbitrary effect 

concentration  according to independent action, Equation 5 can be rewritten and 

under the condition that total effect ( ) equals %,  is defined as 

(4) 

(5) 



  Influence of pH on the toxicity of carbaryl 

168 

 

,therefore, the overall effect of any given total mixture concentration can be 

calculated as:  

% =  1 ? (1 ?  

 

Equation 6, solved iteratively for a  that provokes an effect of %, implicitly 

provides a prediction of effect concentrations of a mixture under the hypothesis of 

independent action. 

3. Results 

3.1 Stability of carbaryl at acidic and alkaline pH 

In order to check the stability of carbaryl, chemical analyses were performed for the 

whole tested pH range. The analysis of the exposure media for acid condition showed 

stable exposure concentrations, remaining within 80 – 120% of the nominal concentrations 

with only two exception at pH 3.7 (129% of nominal concentration) and pH 4 (131% of 

nominal concentration). However, the measured concentrations were far below the nominal 

ones varying from 0.002 to 32% of the nominal concentrations. At pH above 9.5 the 

nominal concentrations could not be detected been below the limit of quantification (Table 

S1, Supplementary data).  

3.2 Single stressors toxicity 

Clear dose-response relationships were observed in the single exposure experiment 

as can be observed in Fig. 1. The toxicities of each stressor are summarized in Table 1. The 

pH effects were tested for both acidic and alkaline conditions (pH 3-7 and pH 7-12) 

Embryos exposed to pH below 3.5 or above 10.5 showed a 100% of mortality. The 

observed lethality was established within 24 hours and did not increase with prolonged 

exposure. For the acidic range, a 96 h-LC50 value of 225 ± 16.6 µmol/L was determined 

(6)

and for the alkaline range, a 96 h-LC50 of 160 ± 23.6 was calculated (Table 1). For carbaryl 

a time and dose dependent relationship was observed with a 96 h-LC50 of 14.9 mg/L (Fig.1, 

Table 1).

3.3 Combined experiments 

As stated in the methodology section, in order to discard any interference of the 

buffers used to stabilize the pH on the combined toxicity tests, two assays were conducted 

increasing 10 times the concentrations of the buffers used for acid and alkaline range. Fig. 

S2 shows the observed toxicity for acid range (MES concentration of 40 mM) and for 

alkaline range (CAPS concentration of 220 mM). When compared with the toxicities of 

assays using the lower buffer concentration (concentrations proved to have no toxicity to 

embryos) a slightly difference on the toxicity of 34% for MES and 35 % for CAPs was 

observed. Moreover, the concentrations used of 4 mM and 22 mM are far below the ones 

that pose risk to zebrafish embryos as demonstrated by the toxicity test conducted for each 

buffer used in the combined experiments (Table S1, supplementary data). For MES, the 

concentration of 4 mM is 64 fold less toxic than the established NOEC and for CAPS, the 

concentration of 22 mM is 17 fold less toxic than the LC50.

The results of the combined toxicity of pH (acid or alkaline) and carbaryl as well as 

the predictions made by CA and IA are shown in Fig. 2. Table 1 summarizes the 

concentration-response relationships for mixture predictions and experimental 

determinations. For both pH ranges CA predicts higher mixture toxicity than IA as can be 

observed in Fig. 2.  However, there is only a factor of ~1.5 between the LC50s predicted by 

CA (150 µmol/L for acid and 124 µmol/L for alkaline pH) and those predicted by IA (222 

µmol/L for acid and 192 µmol/L for alkaline pH).  

As can be seen from Fig 2a in the case of acid range, the mixture toxicity is rather 

precisely predicted by CA. The observed LC50 for the combination was 139 µmol/L, which 

is only a difference of 8% (a factor of 1.07) in relation to the predicted value of 150 

µmol/L. In contrast the IA underestimates the combination of acid pH and carbaryl at the 

LC50 level. The LC50 predicted by IA was 222 µmol/L which is a difference of 60% (a 

factor of 1.6) compared to the observed toxicity. 

Regarding the alkaline range, Fig 2b shows that both concepts underestimate the 

combined toxicity. The observed LC50 for the combination was 42 µmol/L which is a 

difference of 200% (a factor of 3.0) regarding the LC predicted by CA and a difference of 

356% (a factor of 4.6) regarding the one predicted by IA.  

Overall, both concepts (CA better than IA) adequately estimated the joint-effects of 

acid pH and carbaryl if the components were mixed in the ratio of their respective LC50s. 

However, for the combination of alkaline pH and carbaryl, an increase in the toxicity was 

observed due to the higher toxicity of the degradation product of carbaryl 1-naphthol.

values below 5 and above 10 demonstrated to decrease fish survival (Dave, 1984; Jordahl 

and Benson, 1987; Kaur and Toor, 1980; Le Louarn and Webb, 1998). The detailed 

toxicity profile of the entire pH range is subject of a separate chapter (chapter 3). The 

insecticide carbaryl showed to be moderately toxic to zebrafish embryos. The toxicity of 

carbaryl has been studied in several fish species including zebrafish where LCs varied 

from 5.3 to 44.66 mg/L (De Mel and Pathiratne, 2005; Lin et al., 2007; Mahboob et al., 

2014; Schock et al., 2012). As for pH, the detailed toxicity profile of carbaryl is also 

subject of a separated publication (chapter 4).  

The joint effect of carbaryl and acid pH was correctly predicted by the CA model as 

demonstrated in Fig. 2a. pH in the acidic range seems not to be a determinant factor on the 

toxicity of carbaryl. This has been shown by other studies investigating the effects of pH 

on the toxicity of carbaryl in invertebrates and amphibians. In the study of Lohner &amp;amp; 

Warwick Fisher, (1990) acid pH had minimal effects on the toxicity of carbaryl to the 

midge Chironomus riparius. Similarly, the study conducted by Relyea (2006) 

demonstrated that a decrease in pH from 8 to 6 had no effect on survival of Rana 

catesbeiana and Rana calmitans. Although these two stressors do not have the same mode 

of action, it seems that CA may quite precisely describe the combined effects of carbamate 

insecticides and acidic pH, probably due to the stability of carbaryl under these conditions 

(see Table S2).  

Regarding the alkaline pH range, both concepts clearly underestimated the toxicity 

of the combination at the ratio of LC50 as can be observed in Fig 2b. This strong deviation 

from the predicted toxicity is probably due to the higher toxicity of the main degradation 

product of carbaryl. The chemical analyses done (please refer to Table S2 in the 

supplementary data) have demonstrated that carbaryl undergo rapid degradation under 

alkaline pH confirming the findings of Aly and El-Dib (1971) which showed that carbaryl 

is susceptible to hydrolysis at alkaline pH with a half-life of only 2.5 h at pH 9. As 1-

naphthol is the main degradation product a toxicity test was conducted with this compound 

to assess  if the observed deviation in the toxicity could be due to the higher toxicity of 1-

naphthol when compared to carbaryl. The Fig S3 (supplementary data) shows the 

concentration-response curve for zebrafish embryos exposed to 1-naphthol (96 h-LC50 52 

µmol/L) which proved to be 42% more toxic than carbaryl (96 h-LC50 74.3 µmol/L).  The 

effects of alkaline pH on carbaryl toxicity have also been explored in the past in different 



  Influence of pH on the toxicity of carbaryl 

174 

 

experimental designs without the use of any approach for the calculation of the expected 

combinatory toxicity. Woodward &amp;amp; Mauck, (1980) investigated the effects of insecticides 

to the Cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii) and found that an increase in pH from 6.5 to 

8.5 was responsible for an increase in the toxicity of carbaryl by a factor of 5 and also for 

other carbamate insecticide aminocarb by a factor of 20. In another study also conducted 

with carbamate insecticide Mauck et al., (1977) demonstrated that at pH 9.5 mexacarbate 

(zectran) toxicity increased 38 times to the bluegills (Lepomis macrochirus). The authors 

attributed this high toxicity at alkaline pH to the breakdown product of zectran, 4-amino-

3,5-xylenol that was 70 times more lethal to bluegills than mexacarbate. From our results 

and from the literature, it seems that the impact of alkaline pH on the toxicity of carbamate 

insecticides is primarily due to hydrolysis of the compounds into more toxic products.  

As observed by our study, changes in environmental factors such as pH may 

enhance the acute toxicity of pesticides and underestimate their effects to aquatic biota. 

Some recent reviews have highlighted the importance of the possible interactive effects of 

environmental stressors and chemical pollution (Heugens et al., 2001; Holmstrup et al., 

2010; Laskowski et al., 2010; Noyes et al., 2009). Heugens et al., 2001 reviewed the 

combined effects of stressful environmental conditions (temperature, nutritional state and 

salinity) and various classes of chemicals including pesticides. They concluded that in 

general the toxicity increased with increasing temperature and decreasing nutrient supply. 

In other review conducted by Laskowski et al., 2010, natural environmental factors showed 

to significantly modify the effects of toxicants on the tested organisms and the authors 

argued the necessity of incorporating natural stressors in ecological risk assessment.  

Pesticides and environmental factors can “interact” in a variety of ways; natural 

factors can, for example, change the physicochemical properties of the pesticides 

modifying the adsorption, desorption, volatilization and degradation rates and directly 

influencing their bioavailability (Heugens et al 2001). Toxicokinetics may also be 

influenced by environmental factors through alterations in the uptake or detoxification 

rates (Løkke et al., 2013). Furthermore, the combined effects of natural stressors and 

toxicants can also affect the physiological state of organisms especially when the natural 

stressor reaches extreme levels such as extreme acidic and alkaline pH (see compilation of 

examples in Heugens et al 2001, Holmstrup et al 2010 and Laskowski et al 2010). This is 

particularly important when applying mixture concepts such as CA and IA for the 



  Influence of pH on the toxicity of carbaryl 

175 

 

prediction of combined effects of environmental factors and chemicals. Neither CA nor IA 

relates to biochemical and physiological process of exposed organisms, or consider 

physicochemical characteristics of chemicals pollutants (Backhaus and Faust, 2012). 

However, these concepts have been successfully applied to investigate the combined 

effects of natural stressors and chemical pollutants (Jonker et al., 2005).  

CA seemed to be the best model to predict the combined effects of pH and carbaryl. 

This model has proven to provide good to excellent predictions of mixture toxicities 

regardless the similarity or dissimilarity of the modes of action of the mixture components. 

Belden et al., (2007) reviewing the effects of mixture of pesticides concluded that for 88% 

of the cases CA model had observed effective independent of the  mode of action of the 

mixture components. On the other hand, for mixtures with different modes of action, they 

observed that IA was more accurate than CA; however, in most cases the differences 

between the two models were relatively small. Irrespective of the mode of action, CA has 

empirically shown to provide a more conservative combined effect estimations (Faust et 

al., 2003) and has been proposed as the general solution for mixture toxicity analysis even 

though the mechanisms of action are unknown (Backhaus and Faust, 2012; Backhaus et al., 

2000; Berenbaum, 1985). 

Nonetheless, when using either CA or IA for prediction of the combined toxicity of 

environmental factors and chemical stress this may not always be the case. In this type of 

combination these concepts must be used with caution and knowledge of physicochemical 

properties of a given chemical seems to be crucial for an accurate prediction of effects (at 

least for abiotic factors known to modify physicochemical properties of chemicals). For the 

risk assessment of binary and multiple mixtures of chemicals (with specific and unspecific 

modes of action) many scientific concepts have been developed and validated for use 

(Altenburger and Greco, 2009; Backhaus and Faust, 2012). However, when dealing with 

combination of chemical and nonchemical stress only few approaches are available but are 

not ready yet for extrapolation for risk assessment practice as pointed out by Altenburger 

and Greco (2009). There is an urgent need to improve our understanding of the effects of 

environmental factors and chemical pollutants as the rapid climate change process is 

already altering structure and function of natural ecosystems and also impacting the fate 

and behaviour of chemical pollutants.  



  Influence of pH on the toxicity of carbaryl 

176 

 

In this regard, the joint-effects of pH and carbaryl observed in this study raise the 

concern towards the risk assessment of pesticides. The potential toxicity of carbaryl is 

likely to be underestimated by established procedures where pH is held constant. Although 

in the climate change context such extreme scenario (alkaline pH) may be exception rather 

than the rule, our study - focusing in the lethal effects only – provide a first approach for 

effects screening. The use of sublethal endpoints would further give a more comprehensive 

understanding of the combined effects eventually detecting effects at pH levels more 

realistic in terms of ecological relevance.  

 

5. Conclusion 

We have shown that environmental factors such as pH can modify the toxicity of 

the pesticide carbaryl. The conceptual model CA allowed a precise prediction of the 

toxicity of the joint-effects of acid pH and carbaryl. Nevertheless, for alkaline condition 

both concepts failed in predicting the effects. Deviations to the model were however easy 

to explain as high pH values favour the hydrolysis of carbaryl with the consequent 

formation of the more toxic degradation product 1- naphthol. Although in the present study 

such explanatory process was easy to establish, for many other combinations the 

“interactive” nature is not so evident. In the context of the climate change few scenarios 

predict such increase in the pH of aquatic systems, however this was a first approach 

focused in the lethal effects only. In a second tier assessment effects at sublethal level 

would be sought and it is expectable that more subtle pH changes (more realistic in terms 

of climate changes scenarios) may also have an effect at physiological and biochemical 

levels with possible long term consequences for the population fitness.

The supplement provides additional data on the toxicity of acidic and alkaline pH, as well 

as for the combinatory effects of carbaryl and pH to zebrafish embryos. The effects of the 

buffers MES, MOPS, TRIS, CAPS and CHES on embryos survival are shown to indicate 

that the buffer concentrations selected neither compromise the analysis of pH effects 

(Table S1, Fig. S1) nor the combined effects. Table S2 shows the results of chemical 

analysis. Fig. S2 shows the predicted and observed effects of the combination of pH and 

carbaryl for both pH ranges increasing ten times buffer concentrations in order to exclude 

any possible effects of the buffer in the mixture. Fig S3 shows the concentration response 

curve for 1-naphthol, the main degradation product of carbaryl.

Discussion: combined effects of environmental factors and pesticides 

190 
 

7. General Discussion 
 

This thesis addressed the problem of environmental stress and its role on the 

toxicity of pesticides, more particularly under a scenario of global changes in which 

aquatic systems have to cope with multiple sources of stress simultaneously.  

In the last decades, the progressive changes on climate have had widespread 

impacts on natural systems changing not only the structure and function of many 

ecosystems (Benítez-Gilabert et al., 2010; Fenoglio et al., 2010; Mooij et al., 2005), but 

also impacting distribution and toxicity of chemical pollutants such as pesticides 

(Bloomfield et al., 2006). The assessment and prediction of effects elicited by many 

stressors (natural and chemical) acting simultaneously in a ecosystem implies a deep 

knowledge on the toxicity of the individual components. Thus, in this thesis, the zebrafish 

acute embryo toxicity test was firstly used to evaluate the effects of selected environmental 

parameters (pH, Dissolved Oxygen (DO) and UV radiation) and pesticides (carbaryl and 

carbendazim), providing a detailed and comprehensive analysis encompassing 

concentration-response curves and respective half-maximal effect concentrations (LC50, 

EC50) that can be  further used in the assessment of combined stress. Zebrafish embryos, 

the experimental model selected for this work, showed to be adequate to achieve the 

proposed objectives and showed to have advantageous features for the use in 

ecotoxicology. Particularly relevant is the high sensitivity of the locomotor assay deployed 

with the high throughput system Zebrabox. The analysis of the individual stress 

components at sublethal level provided information of effects at different levels of 

biological organization potentially contributing to the establishment of adverse outcome 

pathways of the compounds within the organism.  

Environmental components studied were selected based on the relevance in the 

context of the climate changes that have been verified. pH is one of the most determinant 

parameters for any chemical and biochemical effects and is pointed out as one of the most 

important factors conditioning survival and fitness of many freshwater species.  

As for dissolved oxygen, although hypoxia episodes may occur in the aquatic 

environments, their frequency have been increasing by anthropogenic activities related to 

organic and nutrient enrichment in a phenomenon known as eutrophication. Due to rapid

human growth and global warming, the problem of hypoxia is likely to worsen in the 

upcoming years. An increasing temperature will lead to a considerable reduction in oxygen 

solubility especially in freshwater systems.  

In aquatic systems, organisms may have to face the effects of another important 

environmental parameter: UV radiation. Projections show that the baseline levels of UV 

radiation will not be restored in the next decades (Weatherhead and Andersen, 2006). In 

addition, alterations in dissolved organic matter could affect UV transparency increasing 

the exposure of aquatic species to UV radiation specially vertebrates such as amphibians 

and fish that deposit their eggs in shallow surface waters.  

The effect of each environmental stressor was evaluated on the survival and 

development of zebrafish embryos. Changes in environmental conditions showed to 

greatly impact the performance of embryos by decreasing survival and inducing a series of 

effects such as hatching and developmental delay, decreased heart beat rate, increase 

incidence of deformities, reduced body length among others. This is the first 

comprehensive and detailed analysis on the effects of environmental parameters including 

a time-course analysis for both lethal and sublethal endpoints. These data give an important 

contribution in the field of mixture toxicity providing baseline information to study the 

interaction of environmental stress factors and toxic contaminants in the zebrafish embryo 

model. 

The evaluation of the toxicity of two widely used pesticides (carbaryl and 

carbendazim) using a multiple endpoint approach allowed the assessment of effects at 

several levels of biological organization including developmental, biochemical and 

behavioural. Behaviour and biomarkers were the most sensitive endpoints, been capable of 

detecting effects in very low concentration of pesticides, contributing to a mechanistic 

understanding of the effects.  

Environmental parameters can interact with chemical pollutants in a variety of 

ways. They can influence the degradation and/or bioavailability of chemical compounds 

and change the toxicokinetics. Temperature effects on uptake and detoxification rates are a 

classical example as reviewed by Heugens et al (2001). Furthermore, environmental 

factors can also compromise the physiological state of organisms, potentially impairing 

fitness and the capacity to cope with additional stress. Spurgeon et al., (2010) proposed a 

framework to investigate mixture effects that can also be applied to the study of multiple

stressors toxicity (chemical and nonchemical stress). The framework takes into account the 

three above mentioned process: the bioavailability, toxicokinetics and the sensitivity of the 

organism (toxicodynamics) (Fig 1).  

 

Understanding how the environmental factors may act in each of the above 

mentioned processes is essential to interpret the underlying mechanisms of the toxicity of 

mixtures when the combined effects deviate from either concentration addition (CA) or 

independent action (IA) (Spurgeon 2010).  

In this thesis we evaluated the combined effects of acidic and alkaline pH on the 

toxicity of the carbamate insecticide carbaryl by applying the well-known predictive 

models CA and IA. The results showed that concentration addition allows a precise 

prediction of the toxicity of the combination of acid pH and carbaryl. Nevertheless, for 

alkaline condition both concepts underestimated the effects, although the inaccuracy of the 

CA model was smaller than that of the IA model. In the case of alkaline level, high pH 

values played a crucial role by modifying the toxicity of carbaryl through hydrolysis and 

consequently increasing its toxicity to zebrafish embryos and may be the main cause of

deviation from CA and IA. Neither CA nor IA considers specific chemical characteristics 

of the components of the mixture as well as physiological process of the exposed 

organisms. This can be a drawback of these two models to evaluate combined effects of 

chemical and nonchemical stressors, but at the same time, the simplicity of these two 

concepts may allow the establishment of guidelines and frameworks for mixture toxicity 

assessment in general (e.g. Backhaus &amp;amp; Faust 2012).  

Mostly importantly, the results of this thesis demonstrated that pH can significantly 

affect the toxicity of pesticides to zebrafish embryos. The findings show that natural 

stressors and/or multiple stressors toxicities should not be neglected in the risk assessment 

of chemicals in order to avoid underestimation of risk and, therefore adequately protect 

aquatic ecosystems. Results presented here consist of a first tier assessment focusing at the 

lethal level only and although may not reflect a realistic environmental exposure scenario 

(except in extreme cases) highlight the importance of considering environmental variables 

as co-stressors in aquatic environments. Future approaches comprising also sublethal 

effects and therefore including realistic exposure scenarios may give a more sound 

perspective of risk in the context of climate changes. 

 Although the study of combinations of chemical and nonchemical stressors have 

progressed in the last few years, further research has to be conducted to evaluate and/or 

develop new approaches to describe this type of combination in order to detect deviations 

on the expected toxicity. Future work should focus on the evaluation of the potential 

impact of other important environmental stressors in the toxicity of chemical pollutants as 

dissolved oxygen, where a lack of studies has been identified (chapter 2). Moreover, the 

effects of combinations of more than two stressors should also be considered reflecting a 

more realistic scenario as in the environment. In addition, given that the assessment of 

every single pesticide under all exposure scenarios is unfeasible, the challenge for the 

future will be the identification and therefore prioritization of most relevant exposure 

conditions to be assessed.
