ABSTRACT 

The Patos Lagoon, the largest coastal lagoon in the world, has long been receiving 

considerable anthropogenic input resulting from urban, rural and industrial 
activities. Thus, sewage contamination possibly originating from the more than 2 
million inhabitants living within its drainage basin is examined in this study. 
Sediment samples collected from various points along the Lagoon were extracted, 

purified and analysed by GC-MS. Ten different sterols and ketones, including 
coprostanol and epicoprostanol, were identified and quantified. The highest 
coprostanol concentration was found near Porto Alegre City (1,423 ng g

-1
 dry wt.), 

whilst most sediment levels ranged between &amp;lt;DOL and 91.78 ng g
-1

. The highest 

concentrations were found at those three sites located closest to domestic outfalls 
though levels tended to decrease with distance from the sources. The 5?/(5?+5?) 

isomeric ratios indicated sewage-contaminated sediments near Porto Alegre City,

sewage input.

RESUMO 

A Lagoa dos Patos (RS), considerada a maior lagoa costeira do mundo, tem sido 

afetada por diversas atividades antrópicas. Um risco de contaminação por esgoto 
ocorre devido ao estabelecimento de mais de 2 milhões de habitantes ao longo da 
bacia de drenagem desta região. Amostras de sedimentos foram coletadas e 
analisadas por CG-EM. Dez diferentes esteróis, incluindo coprostanol e 

epicoprostanol (fecais), e cetonas foram identificados e quantificados. A maior 
concentração de coprostanol foi encontrada próximo à cidade de Porto Alegre 
(1.423 ng g

-1
). Nos demais pontos, a concentração variou desde o limite de 

detecção até 91,78 ng g
-1

. As maiores concentrações foram encontradas próximo à 

descarga de esgotos e os níveis diminuíram com o aumento da distância desde as 
fontes. As razões isoméricas 5? / (5?+5?) indicaram sedimentos contaminados 

próximo a Porto Alegre. A razão epicoprostanol/coprostanol mostrou valores 

característicos do aporte de esgoto sem tratamento ao longo da Lagoa dos Patos. 

 

  

  

Introduction 

Sterols have been used as molecular tracers to identify and distinguish between 
sources of contamination in various environmental compartments such as water 
and sediments because of their specificity as regards origin.

1
 They are persistent in 

anoxic sediments, easily associate with particulate material and sediments, and 
present notable resistance to anaerobic degradation.

2,3 

Faecal sterols, such as coprostanol and epicoprostanol, and the ketone 5?-

coprostanone present in human faeces have previously been used as tracers for 
human waste in coastal areas of industrial and urban centers in temperate regions

4-

7
 and also in the Brazilian tropical region.

8-10 

Coprostanol has been widely used as a marker of faecal contamination because it is 
produced in the digestive tracts of humans and higher vertebrates by the microbial 

reduction of cholesterol.
11

 It accounts for 40-60% of the total faecal sterols 
excreted in human wastes.

12
 As the main excretion product of humans, this sterol 

may be associated with anthropogenic sewage.
7 

Epicoprostanol, a coprostanol isomer, can be used as an indication of the level of 
treatment or age of the faecal matter because it is formed during treatment of 
wastewaters and sewage sludge digestion.

13
 Human faeces contain trace amounts 

of this isomer. During extensive anaerobic sewage treatment, however, 

epicoprostanol may be produced from cholesterol and the relative proportions of 
those compounds may be used to indicate the degree of sewage treatment, 
suggesting that this could be used as an indicator of the presence of untreated 



sewage in sediments.
11

 In combination with cholesterol and cholestanol, faecal 
sterols are a reliable marker of human sewage contamination.

2,14 

5?-coprostanone is present in significant amounts in human faeces, sewage sludge 

and sediments collected at sewage outfalls. It can also be useful biomarker to 

evaluate faecal contamination since the presence of this compound implies that at 
least part of the conversion of cholesterol into coprostanol in the intestine of 
humans occurs via the formation of an intermediary compound.

15 

Marine organisms, including cyanobacteria, microalgae, phytoplankton (diatoms, 
coccolithophorids, dinoflagellates) and zooplankton, widely distributed in biological 
systems, produce no coprostanol, epicoprostanol or 5?-coprostanone. So sterol 

profiles and the ratios of faecal sterols to other sterols may be useful in the 
discrimination of faecal and biogenic sources. 

The Patos Lagoon is the largest coastal lagoon in the world,
16

 with a surface area of 

10,360 km
2
. The entire system is connected to the Atlantic Ocean through a narrow 

channel, 750 m wide. The lower lagoon, also called the estuarine area, occupies 
approximately 10% of the total area

17
 (Figure 1). The system dynamics are 

essentially dependent on the wind and on the freshwater discharge.
18,19

 The 

estuarine region is mostly shallow (generally less than 2 m deep), except for the 
navigation channel (in which depths can reach more than 14 m). Normally much 
weaker in shallow regions, currents at the entrance channel can flow at up to 1.5 m 

s
-1

 during periods of high river discharge (ebb flow) or during meteorological events 
coming from the southern quadrant (flood flow).

This system suffers great anthropogenic pressure from urban, rural and industrial 

activities.
17

 Porto Alegre (&gt;1.5 million inhabitants), Pelotas (~350,000 inhabitants) 
and Rio Grande (~200,000 inhabitants) are the main metropolitan areas, which still 
dispose of a significant part of their untreated sewage in the lagoon. In addition to 
several diffuse urban inputs into the shallow marginal bays,

20
 the activities related 

to one of the biggest harbors of Brazil and numerous factories (oil refinery and 
terminal, fertilizer-producing plants, fishery industries) have an impact on the 
estuary.

21
 Table 1 summarizes the main sources of organic contamination at each 

site studied. 

Despite its ecological importance, the sources of the organic matter found in the 
Patos Lagoon have barely been examined.

22,23
 No previous studies using sterols as 

biomarkers, to distinguish between sewage and biogenic sources of the organic 
matter in the Patos Lagoon have previously been conducted. In this respect, 
coprostanol and other sterols have been analysed, in the study, in surface 
sediments at selected sites in the Patos Lagoon. 

  

Experimental 

Sampling and analytical procedures 

In order to evaluate sterols inputs from natural and anthropogenic sources in the 

Patos Lagoon, 17 sediment samples were collected at the sites shown in Figure 1, 
in 1997. Sediments were sampled utilizing a stainless-steel grab. Only the top 2 cm 
of undisturbed surface sediment was placed into pre-cleaned aluminum foils, and 
then stored at -15 ºC until laboratory analysis. 

The sediments were freeze-dried, dry/wet ratios determined and then sieved 
through a stainless steel mesh (250 µm). Each sediment sample (10 20 g) was 
spiked with an internal standard, 5?-androstan-3?-ol (Sigma). The samples were 

Soxhlet extracted for 12h into 200 mL of hexane/dichloromethane (1:1). The 
extracts were concentrated down to a few milliliters using rotary evaporation 

followed by gentle nitrogen "blow down". Sulphur was removed by shaking the 
extracts with activated copper. 

Clean-up and fractionation was performed by passing the extract through a 

silica/alumina column (the silica and alumina were activated at 200 ºC for 4 h and 
then partially deactivated with 5% Milli-Q water). The chromatography column was 
prepared by slurry packing 8 g of silica, followed by 8 g of alumina and finally 1 g of 
sodium sulphate. Elution was performed using 20 mL of hexane to yield the first 

fraction (which contains the aliphatic hydrocarbons), then 30 mL of 
hexane/dichloromethane (90:10) followed by 20 mL of hexane/dichloromethane 
(50:50) (a combination which contains the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). 
Sterols were then eluted with 50 mL of dichloromethane/methanol (90:10). All 

solvents were pesticide grade. 

The fractions containing the sterols were evaporated to dryness and derivatized to 

form trimethylsilyl ethers using BSTFA (bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide) with 
1% TMCS (trimethylchlorosilane) (Supelco) for 90 min at 65 ºC.

The sterols analyses were performed with an Agilent GC model 6890 coupled to a 
Agilent Mass Spectrometer Detector (model 5973) and an Ultra-2 capillary fused 
silica column coated with 5% diphenyl / dimethylsiloxane (50 m ? 0.32 mm ID ? 

0.17 µm film thickness). Helium was used as carrier gas. The oven temperature 
was programmed from 40 to 240 ºC at 20 ºC min

-1
, then to 255 ºC at 0.25 ºC min

-1
 

(holding for 10 min), and finally to 300 ºC at 20 ºC min
-1

 (holding for 5 min). The 
data acquisition was done in scan mode. Compounds were identified by matching 
retention times with results from standard mixtures of 8 sterols and 2 ketones. The 
HP Enhanced Chemstation G1701 CA was used to perform the quantification and 

this was undertaken by the comparison of GC/MS compounds and internal standard 
response factors in the total ion chromatogram. Calibration of the peak area to 
concentration was done using the sterols and ketones standards (Sigma) in the 
derivatized form within the range of 0.25 to 20.0 µg L

-1
 and the linear response was 

&gt;0.995. Procedural blanks were performed for each series of 10 extractions and 
interfering peaks did not interfere with the analyses of target compounds. Internal 
standard recoveries ranged from 70-120%. Detection limits (DOL), defined as three 
times the standard deviation of the signal in the same retention time of sterols in 

the blanks, was 1 ng g
-1

 for all compounds analysed. 

Principal component analysis 

Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using the Statistica package for 
Windows (Version 5.1, 1997) to identify similarities or distinctions among the 
different sterols in marine sediments. For treatment, samples were taken as cases 

and the sterols were the variables. The PCA datasheet consisted of the original 
values of sterols concentrations at each site. 

  

Results and Discussion 

Sedimentary concentrations (ng g
-1

 dry weight) of the following faecal sterols and 
ketones are reported in Table 2: coprostanol (5?-cholestan-3?-ol), epicoprostanol 
(5?-cholestan-3?-ol), 5?-coprostanone (5?-cholestan-3-one), cholesterol (cholest-
5-en-3?-ol), cholestanol (5?-cholestan-3?-ol) and 5?-cholestanone (5?-cholestan-

3-one). In addition, campesterol (24-methylcholest-5-en-3?-ol), stigmasterol (24-
ethylcholest-5,22(E)-dien-3?-ol), ?-sitosterol (24-ethylcholest-5-en-3?-ol) and ?-

sitostanol (24-ethyl-5?-cholestan-3?-ol) were also quantified (Table 2). 

Sewage markers 

The highest coprostanol concentration was found at site #2 (Porto Alegre City; 
1,423 ng g

-1
 dry wt.), while most sediment levels ranged between&amp;lt;DOL and 91.78 

ng g
-1

. The stations within the area of influence of Rio Grande city (#5-#9) 
presented a mean (± SD) concentration of 41.4 (± 31.4) ng g

-1
, while the highest 

coprostanol levels in this area were found at sites # 6 (Yacht Club; 91.8 ng g
-1

) and 
# 5 (North Channel; 64.6 ng g

-1
). The highest concentrations were found at those 

three sites located close to domestic outfalls. In general, levels decrease with 
distance from the sources and this is compatible with patterns associated with 
mixing/dilution processes. However, some of the stations located in front of the 
Patos Lagoon entrance (#12, Ocean 1 and #13, Ocean 2) presented coprostanol 

concentrations at the same levels (76.0 and 54.0 ng g
-1

, respectively) as those 
sites near Rio Grande city. Although these stations are located far from the main 
sources of sewage contamination, the coprostanol levels indicate the accumulation 
of coprostanol in these sediments. Since sterols may be found associated with 

suspended particulate matter
26,27

 and the deposition of fine sediments carried out 

http://www.scielo.br/img/revistas/jbchs/v18n1/11t2.gif
http://www.scielo.br/img/revistas/jbchs/v18n1/11t2.gif


from the Patos Lagoon onto the inner shelf is well known,
17

 it is expected that 
sterols originating from many diffuse sources, mainly adsorbed to fine particles, 

should be transported to the coast, where the sedimentation processes take place. 

  

 



  

Even though Gonzalez-Oreja and Saiz-Salinas
28

 have suggested that coprostanol 

concentrations greater than 500 ng g
-1

 may be used to indicate sewage 
contamination, there is no consensus as to the sedimentary level of coprostanol 
that is indicative of environmental contamination by sewage. Writer et al.

37
 have 

proposed that coprostanol levels above 100 ng g
-1

 should be associated positively 

with sewage input. Nichols et al.
29

 found values of coprostanol greater than 500 ng 
g

-1
 when analyzing sediments near a sewage outfall, although much higher levels 

could be found in heavily contaminated sediments (eg. &gt; 9,000 ng g
-1

).
30 

Although there is controversy as regards the value of coprostanol indicative sewage 
contamination, it may be defined as the presence of levels of coprostanol above 
1,000 ng g

-1
 and a potential source is enough preliminarily to confirm sewage 

contamination. 

Thus, only the sediments from the navigable channel near Porto Alegre city (#2), 
may be considered as greatly contaminated by sewage. The untreated sewage and 

industrial effluents of Porto Alegre that are still being partially discharged into the 
Lagoon might explain the high values of coprostanol found there. 

The coprostanol levels in the remaining sediments (100 ng g
-1

) were quite low as 
compared to those of sites near densely populated areas, such as the Venice lagoon 
Italy (&gt; 5,000 ng g

-1
),

30
 the Tan Shui estuary, Taiwan (33,300 ng g

-1
, 2 km from 

outfall),
2
 the San Pedro Shelf, USA (&gt; 1,000 ng g

-1
 at stations near outfall),

7
 Sochi, 

Black Sea, the Russian Federation (5,400 ng g
-1

).
32 

As compared with other Brazilian marine systems, the concentration of coprostanol 
in the Patos Lagoon was lower than that found in Guanabara Bay, Rio de Janeiro 

(40.0 µg g
-1

 site near the Iguaçú River),
9
 and that in the Capibaribe River, Recife, 

Pernambuco (mean value = 3,026 ± 2,322 ng g
-1

).
10

 It is possible that these 
results might be associated with an input flux of sewage at each place, higher in 
Recife and Rio de Janeiro cities. 

As an indication of the level of treatment or age of the faecal material,
13

 the 
concentration of epicoprostanol at site #2 (132.0 ng g

-1
) indicated limited sewage 

treatment at Porto Alegre. The much lower levels of epicoprostanol in the remaining 

sediments (&amp;lt;DOL to 11.7 ng g
-1

) are consistent with the levels of coprostanol and 
the very limited sewage treatment in the other urban areas along the Lagoon. Rio 
Grande, for instance, had less than 10% of its sewage treated before 2004. 

Concentrations of 5?-coprostanone ranged from &amp;lt;DOL to 55.0 ng g
-1

, except at 

site # 2 (420.6 ng g
-1

). This ketone, which has been used for sewage monitoring,
5
 

showed the highest values at the same sites at which coprostanol presented its 
maximum concentrations. 

The regions considered as affected by sewage (site # 2 and, in lesser intensity, 

sites # 6 and # 5), were clearly associated, on the basis of on faecal sterols and 
5b-coprostanone concentrations, with direct urban and industrial outfall discharges. 
Although no measurements were made of faecal sterols and microorganism 
indicators (e.g. faecal coliforms) in the water column, it is clear that sewage from 

Rio Grande
20

 and Porto Alegre cities is affecting the quality of these waters. The 
estuarine dynamics around Rio Grande, however, might not allow sterol 
sedimentation, and the resulting exportation of these biomarkers to the inner shelf 
(as detected in sediments from sites #12 and #13) is, therefore, keeping 

sedimentary levels low. 



Sterols from natural sources 

Cholesterol is the major sterol of most marine plankton. High concentrations of this 
sterol are, therefore, generally attributed to zooplankton, a wide diversity of 
phytoplankton, and other marine fauna.

33
 It may also be associated with sewage 

since this compound is a by-product of the excretion of higher mammals, such as 

humans.
12 

Concentrations of cholesterol, the only sterol present in all the samples, varied from 

4.45 to 474.1 ng g
-1

. The highest values of this sterol were found in stations close 
to the coast, indicating a considerable important marine organic matter contribution 
at sites # 12 (Ocean 1), # 16 (Control) and # 14 (Ocean 3) confirmed by the low 
values of campesterol/stigmasterol/?-sitosterol (discussed below). The high primary 

productivity due to nutrient fluxes from the Patos Lagoon sediment to the ocean 
from permeable sediments along the Rio Grande do Sul coast

34
 and the 

autochthonous origin of phytosterols (e.g. cholestanol) are the most probable 
reasons for the higher cholesterol concentrations at these sites. 

Cholesterol levels at those sites with no significant sewage contribution (e.g. Sites 
#3 – Camaquã river; # 8 - Channel junction; #9 – Oil terminal; #13 – Ocean 2) 

may also be attributed to biogenic sources, because the faecal contribution may be 
negligible (low levels of faecal sterols). 

Cholestanol has also been found in sediments influenced by the biosynthesis of 

plankton organisms.
10

 Sewage contaminated sediments, however, may also form 
this sterol through the diagenetic transformation of coprostanol to cholestanol 
(5??5?) and the hydrogenation of cholesterol in anoxic environments.

2 

The highest values of cholestanol occurred at sites close to the coast (e.g. # 12 - 
Ocean 1 and # 13 - Ocean 2), and near the sewage outfalls of Porto Alegre (# 2, 
998.3 ng g

-1
) and Rio Grande (# 5, 585.3 ng g

-1
). 

Campesterol, stigmasterol and ?-sitosterol have been commonly used as markers of 

terrigenous organic matter, although the origins remained largely uncertain since 

marine sources were associated with major occurrence in environments where 
organic matter from the land seemed unlikely.

33
 Other authors have already 

addressed the problems of the source specificity of these sterols.
10

 Volkman
33

 
proposed evaluating the ratio of campesterol/stigmasterol/?-sitosterol to overcome 

this limitation. Ratios close to 1:1.6:6.6 indicate inputs of these compounds from 
terrestrial vascular plant sources, while lower ratios suggest algae sources for these 
compounds. These compounds, mainly ?-sitosterol, are also present in 

contaminated sediments from urban centers, originating in domestic vegetable oils 
discharged in wastewater and sewage.

36 

The highest values of stigmasterol (321.4 ng g
-1

), campesterol (510.7 ng g
-1

) and 
?-sitosterol (758.7 ng g

-1
) were present at site # 12 (Ocean 1), which also received 

considerable marine contributions judging from the levels of cholesterol and 
cholestanol and the low value of the campesterol/stigmasterol/?-sitosterol ratio 

(1:0.6:1.5) at this station. The sites located near the sewage outputs of Rio Grande 
(#5) and Porto Alegre (#2) showed high concentrations of ?-sitosterol (219.5 and 

204.3 ng g
-1

, respectively), which probably originated in the urban effluents. 

?-sitostanol is found in marine sediments as a product of the hydrogenation of ?-

sitosterol.
13

 The highest values of ?-sitostanol occurred in sediments collected off 

the coast (# 12 and #13) and near urban wastewater discharges (#2 and #5), 



which was the same trend as that presented for cholesterol, cholestanol and ?-

sitosterol. 

The ratio between reduced and oxidized sterols has been used to indicate microbial 
reduction in anaerobic environments.

35
 The cholestanol / cholesterol and ?-

sitostanol / ?-sitosterol ratios were higher than 1.0 for most of the samples 

analysed, indicating anoxic conditions and microbial reduction (Table 2). This might 
have provided the conditions necessary for the generation of cholestanol and ?-

sitostanol, either by diagenetic or hydrogenation processes. 

The predominance of cholestanol over cholesterol and ?-sitostanol over ?-sitosterol 

for those sites, where high coprostanol levels were found (e.g. # 2 – Porto Alegre, 
# 5 - North channel and # 6 – Yacht Club), may be explained by the anoxic 
conditions (and microbial reduction processes) in the surface layer of these 

sediments as a result of the input of untreated sewage discharges. 

At stations # 4 (São Gonçalo output), # 7 (Shipyard), # 10 (East bar) and # 13 
(Ocean 2), the low concentration (# 13) and the absence of ?-sitosterol over ?-

sitostanol suggest the occurrence of microbial reduction processes. This may be 
confirmed by the higher values of the cholestanol / cholesterol ratio at those sites. 
However, this may not be conclusive because the algae input of cholestanol may be 

attributed to the high concentration of this sterol.
38 

?-sitosterol has been considered to come from terrestrial inputs,
33

 although this is 

not evident from the concentration values of this sterol and the low values of 
campesterol/stigmasterol/?-sitosterol found at the study sites. However, the 

strongly anoxic characteristic of the sediments studied (showed by reduced / 
oxidized sterol ratios) and the absence of potential sources of ?-sitostanol in the 
marine/terrestrial environment studied allowed us to take ?-sitostanol as a 
secondary biomaker of origin of ?-sitosterol

13
 and, in the area studied may be 

attributed to marine sources. 

Although only a reduced number of sterols have been analysed, we were able to 

carry out a preliminary study of autochthonous and allochthonous sources of 
organic matter. This initial evaluation showed that the main contribution of organic 
matter to the Patos Lagoon comes from the marine system and will be useful for a 
better characterization of this region in future studies. 

Qualitative evaluation of faecal contamination 

The use of ratios between selected sterols has been proposed to enhance the 
reliability of contamination assessments based on sterol markers. Some commonly 
used ratios in sediments are: (i) percentage of coprostanols/ total sterols;

4,39
 (ii) 

epicoprostanol/coprostanol;
13

 (iii) coprostanol/(coprostanol+cholestanol);
5
 (iv) 

5?/(5?+5?) isomeric ratios of cholestan-3-ol and cholestan-3-one.
5 

The percentage of coprostanols in total sterols (% (cop+e-cop)/?-OLs) has 

previously been considered to infer the degree of sewage contamination in marine 
sediments. The sewage effluents and strongly contaminated sediments generally 
show ratios of% (cop+e-cop)/?-OLs in the range of 50-80%. The majority of the 

Patos Lagoon sediments showed no predominance of coprostanols (ratios&amp;lt;10%). 
Higher relative contributions of coprostanols, indicating sewage contribution, were 
found at sites #2 (Porto Alegre, 37.3%) and #6 (Yacht Club, 25.6%) (Table 2). 

Mudge and Seguel
13

 proposed the ratio between epicoprostanol and coprostanol (e-
cop/cop) for the assessment of the degree of sewage treatment. Typically, 

http://www.scielo.br/img/revistas/jbchs/v18n1/11t2.gif
http://www.scielo.br/img/revistas/jbchs/v18n1/11t2.gif


sediments that receive untreated sewage effluents show lower ratios (&lt;0.2), while 
those higher than 0.8 are related to treated (primary or secondary) sewage. All 

sites (except those where coprostanols were not detected) have presented ratios 
characteristic of sewage inputs without treatment (Table 2). Even though there is 
no sewage treatment station in the vicinity, site #7 (Shipyard) presented ratio 
higher than 0.2. 

Sedimentary reduction processes, influenced by microbial communities, especially 
in recent sediments, form 5?-stanol and ketone, which are thermodynamically more 

stable than their 5? epimers. In contrast, 5? stanols are dominant in sewage 
sludge. Thus, the combination of coprostanol levels and 5?/(5?+5?) stanol 
(coprostanol/(coprostanol+cholestanol)) and 5?/(5?+5?) ketone (5?-

coprostanone/(5?-coprostanone+5?-cholestanone)) ratios can help better to 
elucidate sewage contributions.

5
 5?/(5?+5?) stanol and ketone ratios higher than 

0.7 have been reported to indicate sewage contamination, while values lower than 
0.3 are indicative of uncontaminated sites.

5
 Intermediate values (0.3-0.7) make it 

difficult to confirm faecal contamination since it may be considered a biogenic input 
of cholestanol, a diagenetic production of 5a epimers or simply a mixture of 

different sources of sterols. 

The 5?/(5?+5?) isomeric ratios are high at site #2 (Porto Alegre) (Figure 2), 

indicating, together with coprostanol levels (1,423 ng g
-1

), that this location is 
contaminated by sewage. Other sediment samples from the Patos Lagoon do not 
appear to be contaminated, having very low coprostanol concentrations (&lt;100 ng 
g

-1
) and 5?/(5?+5?) isomeric ratios (Figure 2). The dominance of the 5a isomer 

indicates a predominance of natural reduction processes and/or biogenic inputs 
over sewage contamination. In addition, the estuarine dynamics around Rio Grande 
might not allow sterol sedimentation and export these biomarkers to the inner shelf 

(as detected in sediments from sites #12 and #13), thus keeping sedimentary 
levels low.

Principal Component Analyses (PCA) 

The literature on biomarkers has highlighted the usefulness of multivariate 
statistical techniques to extract the maximum information from complex mixtures 
of lipid compounds.

40,41
 While individual compounds and ratios using two or more 

sterols can provide some information regarding the origin of the organic matter in 

the sediments, multivariate statistical methods are able to extract more information 
from the data in a single analysis. This more holistic approach can be very useful 
but care needs to be exercised in explaining the results and some knowledge of the 
likely origin of the compounds is needed.

42 

The sterol data were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) for the 
further investigation of the differences between the sources of the organic matter 

found in the Patos Lagoon sediments. This analysis was undertaken on the basis of 
the calculation of the coefficient of variation for each variable. The first two 
components (PC1, 56.9% and PC2, 32.9%) accounted for 89.8% of the total 
variance. 

The loadings for the variables and the scores of the sites are shown in Figures 3a 
and 3b. The PC1 axis (PCA loadings) showed a negative correlation with all 
compounds, especially with 5?-cholestanone, cholestanol and ?-sitostanol. The PC2 

axis showed a positive correlation with coprostanol, epicoprostanol and 5?-

coprostanone (faecal sterols and stanone) and a negative one with cholesterol, 
campesterol, stigmasterol and ?-sitosterol (biogenic sterols) (Figure 3a).

The main discrimination was presented by PC2, which shows positive correlations 

between faecal sterols (sewage inputs), while the compounds with negative 
correlations are associated with natural sources (marine or terrestrial organic 
matter). 

The PCA scores distinguished basically between two different groups of samples 
(Figure 3b). The PC1 scores grouped stations with high (&gt;850 ng g

-1
) and low 

(&lt;700 ng g
-1

) total sterols concentration (?-OLs). It possibly showed that the sites 

with the higher concentrations of ?-OLs were grouped by negative PC1 scores 1 

while the majority of stations had positive scores. On the basis of the PC2, only 
sites #2 (Porto Alegre) and # 12 (Ocean 1) were distinguishes from the other 
stations. Site #2 was separated because it is clearly contaminated by sewage 
presenting with high values of faecal sterols and 5?-coprostanone while the higher 

values of biogenic sterols detected at site #12 explain this separation.

Conclusions 

The present work is the first study ever made on the distribution and origin of 
sterols in the sediments of the Patos Lagoon. The results showed that the 
sedimentary sterols consisted of a mixture of compounds from both natural and 
anthropogenic sources. 

Coprostanol levels were comparable with the lower to mid-range concentrations 
reported for coastal sediments worldwide. In the majority of samples, levels were 

comparatively low (&lt;100 ng g
-1

), indicating lesser sewage contamination. However, 
the coprostanol concentration (&gt;1,000 ng g

-1
) and ratios between selected sterols 

confirmed sewage contamination in the sediment collected off Porto Alegre. 

The e-coprostanol/coprostanol ratio and low epicoprostanol concentration at sites 
where faecal sterols were detected shows that the wastewater discharge into the 
Patos Lagoon receives a poorly and inadequate sewage treatment. 

Anaerobic microbial reduction at most of the sites is confirmed by the cholestanol / 
cholesterol and ?-sitostanol / ?-sitosterol ratios. The PCA analysis shows a strong 
correlation with 5a-compounds (cholestanol, ?-sitostanol and 5?-cholestanone 

group), suggesting coincident sources and, most probably, the bacterial 
hydrogenation of 5?-isomers. 

Although the sterols and ketones data are related to the sample collection date 
(1997) and the distribution of these compounds may differ from the present time, it 
is the author's expectation that this study may contribute to the knowledge of these 

organic biomarkers in the area studied.
