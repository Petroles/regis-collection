11      "Eadem mutata resurgo" 
 

"Though changed I shall arise the same" 
 

“Embora em nova forma eu ressurjo novamente o mesmo” 
 

(Citação gravada na lápide do famoso matemático Jacques Bernoulli (1654-1705), e que 
acreditamos poder ser aplicada, para todos os Depósitos Minerais, que foram submetidos à 
severas modificações tectono-metamórficas ao longo do tempo geológico, independentemente 
de sua origem).

A JAZIDA DE NÍQUEL, COBRE E PLATINÓIDES DE FORTALEZA DE MINAS: 

ASPECTOS TECTÔNICOS, VULCANOLÓGICOS E TIPOS DE MINÉRIOS. 

 

 

1. Introdução 

 

 

O presente trabalho reunindo três artigos científicos sobre a Jazida de Sulfeto Maciço 

Cupro-Niquelífero de Fortaleza de Minas e já formalizadas para publicação em revistas 

internacionais, foi confeccionado para ser apresentado como Tese de doutoramento no 

programa de Pós-Graduação em Geologia Regional, que é vinculado ao curso de Geologia do 

Instituto de Geociências e Ciências Exatas da Unesp – Campus de Rio Claro. 

Distando cerca de 4 Km da pequena cidade de Fortaleza de Minas, localizada no 

Sudoeste do Estado de Minas Gerais, a Jazida de Fortaleza de Minas hospedada em rochas 

vulcânicas com quimismo komatiitico, foi descoberta em 1983, através de furos de sondagens, 

realizados em áreas portadoras de anomalias geoquímicas de Ni-Cu-Co e PGE em solos de 

natureza gossânica, localmente aflorantes no Greenstone Belt Morro do Ferro. Trabalhos 

prospectivos posteriores envolvendo trabalhos de geofísica e uma intensa campanha de furos 

de sondagens, detectaram em profundidade, a presença de um corpo de minério sulfetado 

maciço, com elevados teores de Níquel, Cobre, Cobalto e Platinóide, com espessura média de 

4 metros, mais de 1.500 m de comprimento e atingindo profundidades superiores a 500 m. 

O imenso acervo de informações de natureza geológica gerado desde a descoberta do 

Depósito até o presente, incluindo importantes informações concernentes à fase de Lavra a 

céu aberto, lavra subterrânea e até sobre o Beneficiamento do Minério, contou sempre com a 

participação do autor, que durante todo o período em questão, atuava como geólogo residente 

da Mina. 

Todas essas informações são agora reunidas pelo autor, com a finalidade de discutir a 

fenomenologia envolvida na gênese da jazida nos tempos arqueanos, e sua evolução a 

posteriori, para serem disponibilizadas para a literatura no formato de três artigos principais. 

O primeiro “The Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: Ore 

types distribution and genesis” faz uma abordagem sobre os tipos de minérios presentes na 

jazida, sua mineralogia e quimísmo e sua distribuição no depósito. São descritos os diferentes 

tipos de minério onde se identificam tipos primários razoavelmente preservados desde o 

Arqueano e tipos tectonicamente remobilizados por eventos paleoproterozóicos e 

neoproterozóicos. É também descrito um novo tipo de minério de natureza hidrotermal 



 

 

formado durante a última reativação no Neoproterozóico com forte enriquecimento em Ni e 

PGE. É apresentado o perfil de intemperismo do depósito com desenvolvimento de expressiva 

zona de gossan. É também discutida a distribuição dos diferentes tipos e minério no depósito, 

sua gênese e evolução. 

O segundo “Tectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) 

Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brasil” é consagrado à tipologia do minério 

resultante após sofrer sucessivas deformações. São discutidos o contexto geotectônico da 

região do depósito e os eventos tectono-metamórficos que afetaram o depósito e a 

mineralização. A geologia estrutural da jazida e dos tipos de minério é mostrada em suas 

feições macro e micro bem como a evolução tectono-metamórfica do depósito até a 

configuração espacial atual. Processos colisionais e transcorrentes afetaram sobremaneira a 

geometria do depósito e a tipologia do minério, mas o zoneamento primário da jazida foi 

preservado. 

No terceiro “The Fortaleza de Minas Nickel Sulfide Deposit: An Example of 

Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Deposit in Highly Fractionated Ponded Flows” são 

abordados os aspectos mineralógicos, petroquímicos e a faciologia vulcânica dos derrames 

komatiíticos que hospedam a mineralização e demais derrames do entorno da jazida. É 

apresentado o modelo genético para a formação do depósito mostrando que o depósito de 

Fortaleza de Minas se destaca como um raro exemplo de depósito de níquel vulcanogênico 

formado em fácies de lago de lava contrastando com a grande maioria dos depósitos 

komatiiticos mundiais formados em fácies de canal. Dados isotópicos apontam para 

evidências de assimilação crustal reforçando sua natureza distal, e seu quimísmo e 

fracionamento são comparados com outros derrames semelhantes.  É ressaltada também a sua 

particular assinatura geoquímica com implicações em modelos exploratórios para este tipo de 

depósito.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



THE FORTALEZA DE MINAS NICKEL, COPPER AND PLATINOIDS DEPOSIT: ORE TYPES, TECTONICS AND VOLCANOLOGICAL ASPECTS 1 

THE FORTALEZA DE MINAS NICKEL, COPPER AND PLATINOIDS DEPOSIT: 

ORE TYPES, TECTONICS AND VOLCANOLOGICAL ASPECTS 

 

 

1. Introduction 

 

 

The current work gathers three scientific papers on the Fortaleza de Minas Ni-Cu 

massive sulfide deposit already available for issueing in international magazines and prepared 

for submission as a PhD thesis. The thesis is part of the Regional Geology Post-Graduation 

Program linked to the Geology  Course from the Instituto de Geociências e Ciências Exatas of 

the State University of São Paulo - Rio Claro Campus. 

Located four kilometers to the South of the small Fortaleza de Minas village, in the 

SW of Minas Gerais State, the Fortaleza de Minas deposit, hosted by komatiitic flows, was 

discovered in 1983, through follow up diamond drilling to test Ni-Cu-Co and PGE soil 

anomalies associated to outcroping gossans in the Morro do Ferro Greenstone Belt. Further 

prospective geophysical works and massive diamond drilling campaignsoutlined at depth a 

massive sulfide orebody with average width of 4 meters, more than 1,500m long and 

achieving depths higher than 500m. 

The huge dataset of geological information generated since the deposit discovery until 

now, including important information from both openpit and underground mining and 

processing, had always the author`s participation, who, during all this period, acted as the 

resident mine geologist. 

All this information is now gathered by the author, in order to discuss the deposit 

gênesis during Archean times, and its later evolution, to make it available to the literature in 

the form of three major articles. 

The first “The Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: Ore 

types distribution and genesis” presents the deposit ore types, their mineralogy, chemitry 

and distribution throughout the deposit. The different ore types are described including well 

preserved Archean primary types and tectonically remobilised types during paleoproterozoic 

and neoproterozoic events. A new hidrothermal ore type is also described which was formed 

during the last reactivation in the Neoproterozoic associated with Ni and PGE enrichment. 

The weathering profile of the deposit is also described with its typical gossan zone. The 

distribution of the different ore types, their genesis and evolution are also discussed. 



THE FORTALEZA DE MINAS NICKEL, COPPER AND PLATINOIDS DEPOSIT: ORE TYPES, TECTONICS AND VOLCANOLOGICAL ASPECTS 2 

 

The second “Tectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) 

Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brasil” describes the resulting ore types after 

sucessive deformations. The geotectonic environment of the deposit and the tectono-

metamorfic events which affected the mineralisation are discussed. The deposit and ore types 

structural geology is presented in its macro and micro aspects. The tectono-metamorfic 

evolution of the deposit towards its current configuration is discussed. Colisional and 

transcurrent processes affected the deposit geometry and its ore types, but their primary 

zoning is still preserved. 

The third “The Fortaleza de Minas Nickel Sulfide Deposit: An Example of 

Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Deposit in Highly Fractionated Ponded Flows” describes 

the mineralogical and petrochemical aspects and volcanologic faciology of the komatiitic host 

flow and other neighbor flows. A genetic model for the deposit is discussed and shows that 

Fortaleza de Minas is an uncommon example of volcanogenic nickel deposit developed on a 

lava lake facies contrasting with the majority of komatiitic deposits, which are formed 

preferably on channel facies. Isotopic data show indications of crustal assimilation reinforcing 

its distal environment. Its chemistry and fractioning pattern are compared to other similar 

flows. The unique chemical signature of the deposit is highlighted with implications to 

exploratory models.

The Komatiite-Hosted Ni–Cu–(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: Ore types distribution and genesis          3 

Abstract 

After 20 years of exploration and mining in the Fortaleza de Minas nickel deposit (formerly 

known as O`Toole) a better understanding of the geological framework and the volcanic 

environment was achieved. The different ore types observed in the deposit and its distribution 

revealed the original volcanic setting for the ore formation and also the geological evolution 

and transformation of the different ore types. The nickel mineralization is classified as a Type 

1 deposit (Lesher and Keays, 2002). It is associated to an open trough structure of lava 

pathway. Later metamorphism and deformation obliterated most of the original volcanic 

textures and promoted a strong stretching of the ore zone and remobilization of the massive 

breccia ore along a major shear zone installed at the base of an upper fractionated host flow 

unit in contact with a footwall BIF. In the upper proterozoic Brasiliano Cycle (0.6 Ga) a new 

ore type was formed of hydrothermal origin with extremely high nickel grades and PGE 

nuggests. 

Introduction 

Having completed 20 years of continuous exploratory and infill drilling in the Fortaleza de 

Minas Ni - Fe sulfide deposit (Brenner et al. 1990), aided by the opening of both open pit and 

underground mines since 1998, a better understanding of the geological framework of its 

volcanic environment can now be achieved. Within this period several academical studies 

were carried out with under-graduated and graduated students from the University of São 

Paulo State – UNESP at Rio Claro Campus (Santos, 1996; Santos et al., 1997; Carvalho, 

1998; Carvalho et al., 1999). Detailed mapping and sampling in both mines in addition to core 

logging allowed the understanding of the geometry of the mineralized flow revealing troughs 

within a broader embayment structure similar to other Type 1 deposits related to komatiiites 

(Lesher and Keays, 2002).  The primary ore types typical of Type 1 deposits – disseminated, 

matrix and massive – were strongly affected by late metamorphism and shearing giving origin 

to other ore types and squeezed the sulfides away from the original trough environment along 

the olivine-cumulate host and footwall BIF contact. Strong squeezing associated to 

transcurrent shear displacement and the remobilization of the primary ore types masked the 

identification of the original trough structures. However, detailed mapping of the ore type 

distributions and modeling of footwall BIF thinning interpreted as an indication of 

mechanical-thermal erosion, led to the tentative identification of possible lava pathways in the 

deposit.

Geological setting 

The geology of the Fortaleza de Minas deposit area was described in Marchetto et al. (1984), 

Teixeira et al (1987) and Brenner et al (1990) and has been reviewed more recently with new 

studies (Zanardo et al, 1996; Zanardo, 1992; Zanardo, 1990 and Morales, 1993). The area is 

comprised by an archean crustal nuclei of granite-greenstone terrain within a broad nappe 

structure of proterozoic meta-sediments named as Passos Nappe. This block was once part of 

the Archean Paramirim Craton which was reworked during the Proterozic into the Araxá 

mobile belt. The Fortaleza de Minas Ni–Fe sulfide deposit is locate in the SW side of the 

northern portion of the Guariroba-Peroba segment (Fig. 1), considered to represent the basal 

part of the Morro do Ferro greenstone belt (Teixeira and Danni, 1979a,b). The upper portion 

being represented by the thick chemical-detritical sediments in the northeastern side of the 

Peroba area to the South. Sm/Nd isotopic results from the Ni deposit host flow revealed an 

age of ca. 2.86 Ga for the cristalization of the lavas (Pimentel &amp;amp; Ferreira Filho, 2002), 

suggesting that these rocks are coeval to the Piumhi greenstone belt (ca. 2.9–3.1 Ga). The area 

was esposed to regional metamorphism during the paleoproterozoic Transamazonian Orogeny 

(2.16–2.0 Ga), achieving high amphibolite facies in the deposit area, whith temperatures 

higher than 650 oC (Fernandes, 1998). The region was later affected by intense transcurrent 

shearing during the Brasiliano Cycle (900–520 Ma) with reactivation of major regional faults 

associated with retrograde metamorphism with temperature not higher than 300oC.

Geology of the Fortaleza de Minas deposit area 

Brenner et al (1990) identified four cicles or flow units in the deposit area of serpentinite- 

clino-pyroxenite- gabbro separated by banded iron formations. The nickel deposit occur in the 

uppermost flow unit (Fig. 2). The flow units were named ‘intermediate sequence` having a 

lower and an upper sequences represented by komatiitic basalt flows and subordinately 

komatiite flows and graphitic meta-cherts and tuffs (black shales). The upper and lower 

sequences represent the dominant units in the Guariroba-Peroba area. The intermediate 

sequence is currently interpreted as a thick highly fractionated flow (Hill et al., 1995; Hill, 

2001), where the individual cycles represent individual flow units separated by thin BIF. The 

volcanic environment of the Fortaleza de Minas deposit is interpreted as of a Ponded facies in 

a distal shallow lava lake (Brenner and Carvalho, 2006).

The Fortaleza de Minas Ni – Fe sulfide mineralization 

The Ni, Cu, Co, PGE deposit (Brenner et al, 1990) has a 1.5 km strike length and an average 

width of 5 meters. Reserves are indicated to a 500m depth below surface. The Ni – Fe sulfide 

mineralization occur along a sinistral shear zone installed at the base of a mineralized olivine-

cumulate in contact with a footwall BIF (Fig. 3). The typical hanging wall is represented 

currently by a massive serpentinite or a talc – carbonate schist both metamorphic products 

formed after an olivine-cumulate basal zone from a fractionated komatiitic flow. The most 

common footwall is a banded iron formation although it can be locally represented by talc-

carbonate schist, pyroxene-cumulates or sepentinite. The deposit displayed a global resource 

of the order of 6 Mt with an average grade of 2.5% Ni, 0.40 % Cu, 500 ppm Co and 0.7 g/t Pt, 

Pd, Au. The current underground mine has still one year of mine life after the start up in 1998. 

Major ore types  

Three major ore types have been defined in the Fortaleza de Minas deposit (Brenner et al, 

1990), from top to base, as follows: Disseminated ore (DS), Matrix ore (MX) and Breccia ore 

(BR) (Fig. 3). Other remobilized ore types has also been identifyied and include Sheared ore 

(SU), BIF hosted ore (SC) and a late hydrothermal massive sulfide (HMS).

From the different ore types the disseminated and matrix are considered to be primary 

magmatic ore types with variable degree of deformation but still preserving magmatic 

textures under superimposed cataclastic textures. The Breccia ore is fully recristalized with 

indications of polyphasic evolution from ductile to brittle regime. It is interpreted as derived 

after originally magmatic massive sulfides and, partially, after reworked matrix ore in 

intensely sheared zones. The distribution of breccia, matrix and disseminated ore follows the 

model proposed by Naldrett (1973) named as billiard ball model (Fig. 4).

deposit is shown in Table 1. The mean compositon is based in a detailed sampling program 

and petrographic work carried out in the open pit mine. The different ore types major

Disseminated ore (DS) 

The disseminated ore occurs as the first ore type developed towards the base of the 

differentiated flow in the trough zones. It is hosted by serpentinites and its defined by a 0.60% 

Ni natural cut-off. It has in average 15 to 25 wt% total sulphides with the following 

proportion: 65% pirrhotite, 30% pentlandite, 5% chalcopyrite (Table 1). It has an average 

grade of about 1% Ni and at depth, in the lower portions of the underground mine, it averages 

0.8% Ni. Like the serpentinite host it shows a magnetite content of 15 wt%. The sulfides are 

finelly grained and normally well disseminated through the serpentinite. In the hanging wall 

contact, transitional at a small scale, the sulphides start to concentrate into clouds or small 

nucleus but rapidly they tend to evolve into a well distributed dissemination. Tipical grades 

are: 0.95% Ni, 0.25% Cu, 260 ppm Co, 2.70% S, 0.13 g/t Pt, 0.24 g/t Pd, 0.08 g/t Au. It 

gradually but rapidly increase the sulfide content downwards to the matrix ore (Fig. 5a, 5b 

and 5c). 

 
Matrix ore (MX) 
 

The transition from disseminated ore to matrix ore is marked by the 2.00% Ni natural cut-off. 

Because of the intense shearing observed in the mine area most of the contacts observed 

between the disseminated and matrix ores are tectonic marked by a thin talcose fine grain 

mylonitic zone. Sometimes tectonic wedges or slabs of disseminated and matrix ore types can 

be intercalated. However, in many places, in both open pit and underground mine, a clear 

transition between the two ore types were mapped and sampled. The average sulfide content 

is 50 wt% with similar proportion as for the disseminated ore: 65% pirrhotite, 30% 

pentlandite, 5% chalcopyrite, and also same amount of magnetite (16 wt%). The average 

grade for the matrix ore is about 3.00 to 3.50% Ni. In the transitional contact zone the 

disseminated ore increases the grade to 1.60 and 1.80% Ni and gradually assumes the typical 

matrix ore texture achieving grades of 2.2 to 2.5% Ni and higher (Figs. 5b and 5c). The matrix 

ore has a distinctive fabric similar to many other net-textured ore from volcanogenic massive 

sulfide deposits (Lesher, 1989; Lesher and Keays, 2002). Rounded shaped serpentine 

magnetite gangue is involved by a sulfide network. The rounded masses of serpentine + 

magnetite are interpreted as metamorphosed cumulate olivine crystals surrounded by sulfide 

(Fig. 5d). This texture is interpreted as a primary magmatic texture. The matrix is a very 

isotropic and uniform ore type (Fig. 5e e g). Under the microscope and in hand specimen the 

matrix ore usually displays a cataclastic texture but still preserving its primary texture (Figs. 

5d and 5f). Variations in grain size may occur ranging from a fine to coarse texture. In some 



The Komatiite-Hosted Ni–Cu–(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: Ore types distribution and genesis          9 

places an alternation of finer and coarser ore were interpreted as primary flow layering 

structures. The matrix ore typical grade composition is: 3.40% Ni, 0.63% Cu, 724 ppm Co, 

13.2% S, 0.53 g/t Pt, 0.74 g/t Pd, 0.14 g/t Au.

Breccia ore (BR) 
 

Due to its high plasticity the breccia massive sulfide ore is the most widely spread ore 

type occurring throughout the entire deposit. It is commonly well recrystalized (Fig. 

6a) but can also be intensely sheared due to continuos processes of shearing and 

recrystalization under a transcurrent ductile-brittle regime. Its typical emplacement is 

at the hanging wall serpentinite and footwall BIF contact, usually extending beyond 

the primary embayment limits (Fig. 6b). It shows a gradational decay in both grade 

and amount of sulfide from the center to the lateral extensions of the deposit. When 

sheared it displays rounded and elongated fragments of wall rocks and occasionally 

segregation of pentlandite in layers along the foliation plane (Fig. 6c). 

The Breccia ore (BR) has been subdivided into BR1 and BR2 sub-types reflecting the 

remobilization process under transcurrent shear regime. The BR1 has higher Ni grade and 

occur in the central embayment structure, typically and commonly below the matrix and 

disseminated ores. An exception is the immediate North extension from the embayment 

zone where very high grade recrystalized BR occurs remobilized into the footwall BIF. 

BR1 has a clean recristalised groundmass where clasts of both serpentinite (fig. 6d) 

and BIF (Figs. 6e and 6f) are common. Minor fragments of talc schist may also occur. 

The fragments are usually rounded and slightly flattened but angular fragments are 

also common. They vary in size from milimetric to decimetric but can achieve metric 

sizes eventually. In some places fragments of disseminated ore and also matrix ore can 

be found in the breccia ore (Fig. 6c). At the footwall contact BIF fragments are more 

common and exposures in the open pit mine revealed a continuous process of 

fragmentation and incorporation of the footwall BIF into the brecciated massive 

sulfide along the sheared contact and fault offsets (Fig. 6g). The BR2 shows a dirty 

talcose sulfide matrix with consequently average lower Ni grades than the BR1 sub-

type.

The fragments are strongly deformed within the foliated BR2 matrix (Fig. 7a). Fragments are 

dominantly talc schist and BIF (Fig. 7b). Talc fragments are extremely flattened and in 

general the majority of the fragments are well oriented and of smaller size when compared to 

the BR1 ore sub-type. They BR2 typically occur at the lateral extentions of the embayment 

zone where the ore shows a consistent reduction in both width and grades. At the limits of the 

economic central shoots the BR2 gradually merge into the Sheared ore (SU) where the 

cataclastic texture typical of the BR2 ore remains quite unchanged but the total amount of 

sulfides drops considerably into the sheared low grade talcose ore SU (Fig. 7c). The breccia 

ore typical grade composition is: 4.14% Ni, 0.56% Cu, 870 ppm Co, 16.0% S, 0.42 g/t Pt, 

0.69 g/t Pd, 0.14 g/t Au. The average sulfide content is 65 wt% (BR1) and 62 wt% (BR2) with 

proportions of 65% pirrhotite, 25% pentlandite, 10% chalcopyrite, and the amount of 

magnetite (10 – 12 wt%) is also similar to the disseminated and matrix ore types. 

 
Sheared ore (SU) 
 

This ore type occurs outside of the trough zones where the disseminated and matrix ores are 

dominant. The sheared ore displays a flaser mylonitic fabric (Fig. 7c), and although 

displaying low grades similarly to the disseminated ore, it shows a clear relationship and 

gradation to the also sheared breccia ore (BR2 sub-type). Talc is the typical gangue mineral, 

and smaller amounts of carbonate, chlorite and magnetite are met with. The sulfides are 

interconnected as anastomosed veinlets with typical triangular cuspade junctions. Because of 

this interconnected mylonitic fabric this ore type behaves as massive sulfide in response to 

ground EM surveys. The distribution of this ore type is widespread troughout the external 

zones of the deposit extending hundreds of meters from the primary central embayment zone. 

It is positioned at the base of the hanging wall serpentinite or talc schist but sometimes it 

makes contact with pyroxenites when the serpentinite is pinched out by shearing. It may occur 

alone or intermixed with the BR2 ore and may also occur associated with the BIF hosted ore, 

sometimes tectonically intercalated. Based in it’s distribution and relationship to the BR2 ore 

it has been interpreted as a tectonically remobilized ore type derived after the BR2 ore 

originated by intense shearing with continuous decay in sulfide content from the massive 

sulfide ore and being squeezed along the talcose contact shear zone. In the outer limits of the 

deposit this ore type can be very persistent occurring as a continuous centimetric sheared 

talcose zone which can be traced by drilling hundreds of meters away from the mineable part 

of the deposit. The typical grades for the sheared ore are: 1.23% Ni, 0.22% Cu, 308 ppm Co, 

5.1% S, 0.23 g/t Pt, 0.32 g/t Pd, 0.09 g/t Au. The average sulfide content is 22 wt% with 

proportions of 65Po:25Pn:10Cp with magnetite content of 14 wt%.

BIF hosted ore (SC) 
 

The BIF hosted ore occur in the footwall contact zone between the Breccia and Sheared ore 

types and the footwall BIF. It is a remobilized ore type formed during transcurrent shearing 

polyphasic events. Ni sulfides in the BIF occur as massive or breccia sulfide veins, veinlets, 

stringers, tension gashes fillings or as disseminated banded sulfides (Figs. 7d, e, f, g). Most of 

the time, Ni sulfide stringers and veinlets invade a silicate facies baren BIF achieving 

economic grades. In places, banded exalative baren sulfides (Po) were locally replaced by Ni 

bearing sulfides along the original bedding (Fig. 7f). In the trough zones the SC ore is 

normally absent or rare. The footwall BIF is also absent or rare and thin in the trough zones. 

The absence or thinning of the BIF has been interpreted as result of thermal erosion of the 

thick BIF unit. In the North of the central embayment there is a gradation between breccia ore 

(BR1) and the BIF hosted ore. Bench exposures in the north of the open pit revealed a front of 

well recrystalised breccia ore being tectonically translocated into the footwall BIF along 

fractures and faults parallel to the foliation and bedding and breaking and absorbing BIF 

fragments. A continuous process of breccia ore veining along foliation with subsequent 

merging of the BR1 veins into a single massive sulfide body with fragments of the BIF walls 

can be observed in this area where the breccia ore occurs surrounded by a halo of BIF hosted 

ore (Figs 7d, e, g). The BIF hosted ore type is usually well recristalized with good liberation 

at the mill (Fig. 7h). In the underground mine, in highly folded areas in the footwall, massive 

sulfide offset veins can be squeezed into the footwall BIF along faults and fold nucleus (Fig. 

7i). The typical grades for the BIF hosted ore are: 1.00% Ni, 0.35% Cu, 239 ppm Co, 4.4% S, 

0.11 g/t Pt, 0.20 g/t Pd, 0.08 g/t Au. The average sulfide content is 28 wt% with proportions 

of 65Po:25Pn:10Cp similar to the  sheared ore. Magnetite is rare in the SC ore type, but 

locally can exceed 15 wt%. 

 

Hydrothermal massive sulphide (HMS) 
 

With the opening of the open pit mine a new ore type was identified with remarkably 

differences from the previous ore types. A high grade massive sulfide with characteristic 

coarse pentlandite crystals was mapped in steep oblique hanging wall faults and fractures in 

the southern portion of the open pit. This ore type displays a post-tectonic fabric with lack of 

metamorphic foliation although can be locally sheared. It occurs as typical fault plane or 

fracture infills in the immediate hanging wall of the ore zone (Fig. 8). It shows a clear 

relationship to the breccia ore (BR) from which it seems to be derived. It normally shows a 



The Komatiite-Hosted Ni–Cu–(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: Ore types distribution and genesis          15 

faulted contact to the BR including tectonic slabs of other ore types and host rocks like 

serpentinite and BIF. As it moves away into the hanging wall it looses gradually thickness 

acting a typical vein until it pinches out a few meters to tens of meters from the main ore 

zone. In some cases it can be split into smaller veinlets along vertical to horizontal fractures in 

a stockwork array. With continuous mapping and underground mine development this ore 

type proved to be persistent although intermittent towards the deeper portions of the deposit 

displaying sub-vertical plunges but moving south as it goes deeper as a broad en echelon 

structure.  

 

Fig. 8. Open pit 990 bench horizontal plan showing four offset bodies of HMS ore associated to 
oblique faults in the hanging wall olivine cumulate (serpentinite). 

 

 

Contrasting to the other ore types the HMS can display zoning structures in the contact with 

wall rocks with different phases of Pn rich ore bordered by a massive Cp zone and with a 

massive magnetite contact halo. Talc, carbonate and chalcopyrite hydrothermal breccias are 

commonly associated with the HMS (Fig. 9a). This ore type show a very high nickel grade (8-

14%Ni) when compared to the BR ore which usually displays grades between 3 and 5% Ni. It 

can exceed 90% wt% sulfides. It also shows an abnormal concentration of PGM achieving 

values of 5 g/t Pt and up to 40 g/t Pd. The Pn crystals are remarkably large where 

poikiloblastic decimetric crystals were recorded (Fig. 9b, c). The HMS ore shows a 

greenschist facies paragenesis and also uncommon minor element association for this type of 

deposit such as Ag, Mo, Bi. The typical grades for the HMS ore are: 9.10% Ni, 0.71% Cu, 

1650 ppm Co, 28.3% S, 0.35 g/t Pt, 4.44 g/t Pd.

Weathering profile 
 
The Fortaleza de Minas deposit display a typical weathering profile, previously described by 

Imbernon, (1998); Oliveira et al., (1995 and 1998); Marchetto, (1990), and Carvalho et al. 

(1998, 1999), common to most massive sulfide nickel deposits (Blain &amp;amp; Andrew, 1977; 

Nickel et al, 1977; Nickel &amp;amp; Daniels, 1985; Thornber, 1975, 1976 and 1981), encompassing a 

30m thick partially outcroping gossan followed by a 20m transition zone characterized by a 

violarite/bravoite zone above the fresh sulfide ore. The transition zone is herein defined on the 

basis of 25% of violarite concentration resulting from primary pentlandite substitution (Fig. 

9d). A typical exposure of the transition zone is shown in figure 9e (1000N bench), which is 

represented by stained violarite zone developed on breccia ore. The gossan zone occurs on top 

of the transition zone. Figure 9f shows a hand sample from the gossan zone with distinctive 

sub-horizontal hard massive limonite vein, which represents reprecipitation of iron along sub-

horizontal dilation fractures that cuts the friable gossan and weathered host walls. In the 

weathering process these hard iron oxide forms a typical gossan stone line over the deposit 

area which is responsible for a broad widespread Ni-Cu soil geochemical anomaly. The 

contact between the gossan and the sulfides (violarite zone) is quite irregular and often 

gradational with rounded blocks of matrix ore preserved within the gossan groundmass (Figs. 

9g and 3). The weathered zone longitudinal profile shows a more uniform distribution for the 

gossan cap, which follows the topographic surface (fig. 10). The transition zone forms a more 

irregular boundary due to a more complex control depending on ore type and structures 

(faults, fractures). Continuous mapping and sampling of the gossan zone during the open pit 

mine stripping revealed a vertical and horizontal transition in metal grades. In the massive 

breccia ore the grade can drop from 4-6% Ni in the fresh ore to 0.5% Ni in the gossan.  

 

Fig. 10. Longitudinal weathering profile showing the oxidized gossan zone (30m) followed by the 
transition zone (Pyrite - violarite) (20m). The lower limit of the transition zone was initially defined 
after downdip subvertical drilling and later confirmed by bench mapping and sampling in the open pit 
mine. The transition between fresh sulfides and the violarite zone was defined by the cut of 20% of 
pentlandite converted to violarite on polished sections. Outcroping gossans in the northern area played 
an important role in the discovery of the deposit. An old river channel buried by lateritic soil was 
exposed in the pre-stripping of the open pit which caused locally almost complete erosion of the 
gossan zone.

The different ore types also display different weathering profiles, where the amount of 

sulfides in the primary ore is directly related the depth of the gossan profile (Fig. 11). The 

sulfide mineralogy of the primary ore, basically pyrrhotite, pentlandite and chalcopyrite, is 

replaced by pyrite-marcassite, violarite-bravoite and chalcopyrite-(covelite) in the transition 

zone, and finally, in the gossan zone, by goethite-pyrite. 

 

Fig. 11. Schematic vertical cross-section through the gossan zone based on open pit mine bench 
mapping. The matrix ore is more resistant to weathering and display a typical onion shell structure 
where nuclei of resistant violaritic matrix ore remains preserved within the gossan. The Breccia ore is 
more suitable for weathering and show a deeper gossan profile. The disseminated ore with only 15% 
sulfides does not develop a true gossan but shows instead a stained mottled rock.

The sulfide mineralogy and the Po:Pn:Cp ratios are very uniform throughout the deposit with 

minor variations between the different ore types. Samples from the different high grade ore 

types were recalculated to 100% basis and the results are displayed in Table 5. Regardless the 

differences in the Fortaleza de Minas ore types the recalculated grades look very uniform. 

Comparing to other deposits the Fortaleza de Minas ore can be classified as a low tenor ore 

(&lt;10%Ni) which reflects a low R factor. Chemical data from different mineral phases, 

achieved through ion microprobe survey are summarized in table 6 for pyrrhotite, pentlandite 

and chalcopyrite for the most typical ore types.

the border of the field for the major komatiite deposits field (Fig. 13). 

 

 

Fig. 12. Ore types scatter plots from the Fortaleza de Minas deposit core samples. a Cu shows a poor 

correlation with Ni probably due to remobilization of Cu during shearing. b Co shows a strong linear 

correlation with Ni. c – d Pt and Pd show a reasonable correlation with Ni. In all charts there is a clear 

boundary between low grade ore types (disseminated-DS, BIF hosted ore-SC, sheared ore-SU) and 

high grade ore types (matrix-MX, massive breccia ore-BR). The hydrothermal massive sulfide (HMS) 

has been omitted from this dataset. The boundary between low grade ores and high grade ores can be 

placed about 2% Ni.

Ore Distribution 
 
The different ore types occur in an irregular pattern in the deposit. The different ore types 

layouts and their association give clues to the original distribution of the ore and also to it’s 

genetic model. There is a strong correlation between disseminated and matrix ore types and 

they both occur within or close to the breccia sub-type (BR1). On the other hand the 

disseminated and sheared ore rarely occur together. Sheared ore (SU) is associated with BIF 

hosted ore and to the breccia ore sub-type (BR2). The vertical longitudinal section (Fig. 14) 

shows a schematic distribution of the different ore types and grades in the deposit suggesting 

trough structures where primary ore originally formed. There is a clear grade variation in the 

breccia ore in respect to the occurrence of troughs as suggested by the presence of 

disseminated and matrix ores. Figure 15 shows the nickel grade distribution along mapped 

and sampled sublevels from the underground mine. A clear drop in nickel grade is observed 

as the ore is remobilized from the trough zones until the breccia ore sub-type (BR2) gradually 

changes into the sheared ore.

grades and 50% of breccia ore in the ore zone which corresponds to grade contour of 2% Ni. Thick 
line indicates presence of remobilized and sheared talc bearing ore (SU) indicating lateral thinning of  
mineralization along shear zone outside the central embayment. The outline of the shallow open pit is 
shown in black.

to troughs and gradually change into sheared low grade ore (SU) at orebody limits by continuous drop 
in sulfide content. A richer recristalized breccia ore (2) occurs at about 1900N local coordinate in a 
BIF tensile zone. Sublevel names 900L and 750L refer to true elevation above sea level. 

Ore types evolution 
 
The Fortaleza de Minas nickel sulfide mineralization was initially formed at the basal portion 

of a olivine-cumulate unit trapped in a lava channel or trough. The mineralization is similar to 

the Lesher and Keays, 2002 Type 1 classification. Ore settled as a basal massive sulfide 

followed by matrix ore and disseminated ore in a olivine-cumulate host. Folding and regional 

metamorphism, promoted recrystalization and remobilization of the ore destroying much of 

its primary texture. The gangue minerals in the ore reflect the host rock mineralogy with 

paragenesis compatible with the amphibolite facies for the major syn-tectonic metamorphic 

event assumed to be of paleoproterozoic age (circa 2Ga). This age is supported by a Rb/Sr 

isocron obtained after amphiboles from the mine footwall BIF. At the closure of the 

Transamazonian Cycle the host olivine-cumulate and both disseminated and matrix ore were 

completely serpentinized. During the Neoproterozoic Brasiliano Cycle a system of 

transcurrent faults affected the ore zone promoting stretching and shearing of the ore under 



The Komatiite-Hosted Ni–Cu–(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: Ore types distribution and genesis          24 

brittle-ductile regime. Retrograde metamorphism affected the ore and wall rocks. High CO2 

fluid pressure were responsible for partial transformation of serpentinites into talc-carbonate 

schist. Evidences of retrograde metamorphism associated with strong shearing are present in 

the ore. Most of the talc observed in sheared ores is interpreted to have formed during the 

Brasiliano Cycle (900 – 520 Ma), where the major shear zones where active under greenschist 

facies metamorfic conditions achieving temperatures about 300oC. At this time probably the 

breccia ore was remobilized along the serpentinite / BIF sheared contact forming the sheared 

breccia ore sub-type (BR2), and finally into the low grade sheared ore towards the deposit 

lateral extensions. A new ore type was fully formed during the Brasiliano Cycle, the 

hydrothermal massive sulfide (HMS) associated with carbonate breccias along late oblique 

faults that cuts the hanging wall. Due to field contact relationships it is assumed that the HMS 

ore is derived after the breccia ore as a hydrothermal remobilization which achieved ore grade 

as high as 14% Ni with high PGE nuggets up to 40 g/t Pd. 

 

Origin of the Breccia ore 
 

The breccia ore is the most continuous and widespread ore type in the deposit. Its current 

fabric is unquestionably tectonic showing evidences of several phases of shearing and 

recrystalization in both ductile and brittle regimes. However the high amount of wall-rock 

fragments and the dominance of footwall BIF fragments suggest that some of these fragments 

may have been incorporated into the massive sulfide by thermal erosion processes. It is very 

clear that in the trough zone defined by the presence of thick breccia, matrix and disseminated 

ores the footwall BIF is either absent or much thinner than normal. 

It is reasonable to conclude that a considerable part of the footwall BIF in the embayment 

zone was taken by thermal erosion incorporating BIF fragments into the massive sulfide. 

Later tectonic events promoted more breciation at the interface between the brittle BIF and 

the easily remobilized massive sulfide. In bench exposures in the northern side of the open pit 

a thick “vein” of breccia ore was mapped as a shortcut into the footwall BIF leaving apart 

from the normal BIF / serpentinite contact zone. Smaller veins and stringers of massive 

sulfide where remobilized from the main breccia ore into fractures and faults breaking and 

incorporating new angular BIF fragments into the massive sulfide groundmass (Figs. 7e – 7g). 

Although fully injected into the footwall BIF for more than 50 meters, until it comes back to 

the normal BIF / serpentinite interface, the breccia ore also carried large fragments of matrix 

ore, and smaller fragments of serpentinite and eventually talc schist among the dominant BIF 

fragments. It is considered that the wide extension of the breccia ore outside the embayment 



The Komatiite-Hosted Ni–Cu–(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: Ore types distribution and genesis          25 

zone is due to tectonic remobilization of sulfide along a contact shear zone under high 

temperature and high CO2 fluid pressure. The breccia ore gradually changes to the breccia ore 

sub-type (BR2), with more talc schist fragments and less sulfides assuming a flaser mylonitic 

structure. At the deposit limits this talc bearing ore gives place to the low grade sheared ore 

with the same flaser mylonitic structure but with much lower grades until it becomes 

uneconomic (Fig. 15). Marginal  sheared ore has been identified by drilling as far as 600m 

away from the embayment zone along the major contact shear zone. 

Source of Sulfur 
 

The footwall BIF can be quite thick outside the embayment zone. It displays a distinctive 

zoning from a thin oxide facies at the base (as the other lower BIFs) into a broad zone of 

silicate facies BIF with alternating layers of silica, actinolite and cummingtonite/ grunerite 

(Fernandes et al., 1998a and 1998b; Fernandes et al., 2004). At the top, in the contact zone 

with the ore it can display a discrete amount of exalative banded baren sulfide (Fig. 7f). 

However, the small amount of sulfides do not suport the footwall BIF as a sulfur supplier.  It 

is considered then that the source of sulfur would be placed far upstream in the lava channel. 

In the southwestern limb of the syncline the footwall BIF oxide facies shows a lateral change 

to a graphite-bearing sulfide BIF. These graphite cherts or BIFs can display considerable 

amount of baren sulfide, dominantly pyrrhotite with subordinate chalcopyrite and minor 

sphalerite. Most of the komatiite hosted Type 1 deposits show indications of local 

contamination processes related to thermomechanical erosion of S-rich banded iron 

formations beneath lava channels (Lesher and Keays, 2002; Lesher and Arndt, 1995; 

Beresford, 2005; Naldrett, 2005). Indications of crustal contamination such as enrichment in 

light rare-earth elements (Fig. 16) can be found in many komatiite lava flowing conduits by 

thermomechanical erosion and assimilarion of banded iron formations. Extensive sulfide/ 

oxide bearing banded iron formations in the Fortaleza de Minas deposit area are interpreted as 

the major source for crustal contamination.

Conclusions 

The deposit is hosted by a basal olivine-cumulate (now serpentinte) from an upper flow unit 

of a thick and highly fractionated komatiite flow. The deposit has been highly deformed, 

sheared and metamorphosed since the lower proterozoic developing other remobilized ore 

types but still preserving some of it’s primary cumulate textures and embayment structures. 

Disseminated, matrix and breccia massive sulfide are the major primary ore types  similar to 

other Type 1 deposits. Average grades are 2.5%Ni, 0.4%Cu and 0.7g/t Pt,Pd,Au. It is a low 

tenor ore (9%Ni) with Ni:Cu ratio of 7.5 and S:Ni ratio of 3.85. A high grade hydrothermal 



The Komatiite-Hosted Ni–Cu–(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: Ore types distribution and genesis          27 

massive sulfide ore type was formed during tectonic reactivation during the upper proterozoic 

Brasiliano Cycle (0.6Ga) with abnormal PGE nuggets. 

The Fortaleza de Minas deposit is interpreted as a komatiite hosted Type 1 deposit formed by 

thermomechanical erosion of sulfide-bearing banded iron formations within an open 

embayment structure and ponded lava lake volcanic facies environment.

Tectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 32 

Abstract 

The granite-greenstone terrain of the southwestern Minas Gerais was affected by the sinistral 

Campo do Meio Strike-Slip System, having acquired a regional structure of anastomosed 

sigmoids. One NW-trending sigmoid at south of Fortaleza de Minas is a transtensive segment 

where the Ni-Co-Cu sulfide mine covered in this paper is located. The sigmoid inner structure 

involves several more discrete brittle-ductile shear zones of P, R, R’ and Y types and T 

fractures, as well as younger strike-slip and normal brittle shear zones, all of which related to 

the Campo do Meio System. The shear zones controlled sulfide deformation, remobilization 

and reconcentration, more actively in the breccia ore and sheared types, and less actively in 

matrix and disseminated ores. Primary basal massive sulfides concentrations, changing 

gradually at the top to matrix ore, and this to disseminated ore still preserve the original 

zoning of the deposit. The footwall banded iron formation hosted-ore was entirely formed by 

tectonic-metamorphic processes. 

 

Introduction 

The first economically significant massive sulfide deposit of Ni-Cu in Brazil was discovered 

in 1983 at the southwest of the State of Minas Gerais (Fig. 1), the Fortaleza de Minas deposit 

(formerly named O`Toole). It is a medium size deposit of about 6 Mt of ore with an average 

grade of 2.5 % Ni, 0.4 % Cu, 0.05 % Co and 0.7 g/t PGM. Mining was started by Mineração 

Serra da Fortaleza (Rio Tinto Group) in 1998 and the deposit should be depleted by mid 2007.

Fig 1. Location map of the Fortaleza de Minas Ni-Cu-Co deposit and litho-structural framework of 
southwestern Minas Gerais region. 

The deposit was firstly described by Brenner et al. (1990). It is associated to a volcano-

sedimentary sequence which is part of the Morro do Ferro Greenstone Belt in the granite-

greenstone terrain of the southwest of Minas Gerais (Teixeira and Danni, 1979a,b). When 

compared to other similar deposits described in worldwide literature, significant similarities 

can be noted of geological context, embedding lithotypes, mineralization, chemistry of host 

rocks, volcanogenic aspects, ore types and geological evolution (Marston et al., 1981; 

Naldrett and Campbell, 1982; Hutchinson et al. 1982; Marston, 1984; Hill et al., 1995; Barnes 

et al., 1995; Riganti and Wilson, 1995; Perring et al., 1995). It has been acknowledged that 

the geometric configuration of the orebody reflects a tectonic remobilization and 

reconcentration of ore overprinted on a recognizable primary mineralization setting (Brenner 

et al., 1990). This is demonstrated by detailed litho-structural surveys carried out on land 



Tectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 34 

surface and in a 650 m long exploratory drift, as well as new assays of borehole samples. 

Results are explained in this article. 

Regional Geology 

The regional geology is summarized in Fig. 1. The Paleozoic-Mesozoic sedimentary cover 

and associated Mesozoic diabase sills from the Paraná Basin are shown in the western side. 

The pelites and limestones in the north are related to the Bambuí Group; they represent the 

filling of a Neoproterozoic basin which was inverted, with shearing and metamorphism of 

greenschist facies during the Brasiliano Cycle (0.6-0.5 Ga), as a part of the Brasília Belt. In 

addition to these units, a volcano-sedimentary sequence, an older granite-gneissic complex 

and a greenstone belt are present in the region, as follows: 

 

The metavolcano-sedimentary sequence of Araxá and Canastra groups are represented by 

micaschists, quartzites, metagraywackes, paragneisses and secondly by metalimestones, calc-

silicate rocks, amphibolites and metaultramafic rocks, the latest interpreted as ophiolites. The 

two units were not fully detailed and are referred to herein as Araxá/Canastra. They 

experienced greenschist to amphibolite facies metamorphism, with isogrades inversion, and 

were displaced together by thrust zones overlying against the older complex, which is now 

exposed in the core of an deeply eroded anticlinorial structure (Zanardo, 1992; Morales, 1993; 

Zanardo et al., 1996). Their age has been considered as Neoproterozoic, related to a basin 

filling and inversion during the Brasiliano Cycle (900 - 520 Ma), (Trouw and Pankhurst, 

1993; Soares et al., 1994). 

 

The oldest units are represented by the Varginha and Barbacena Complexes both including 

remnants of metavolcano-sedimentary supracrustals. The Varginha Complex is made up of 

tonalitic to granitic gneisses metamorphosed in the granulite facies and retrometamorphosed 

in medium to low grades. The associated supracrustals are paragneisses, kinzigites, quartzites, 

micaschists, marbles, calc-silicate rocks, magnetite-bearing BIFs, amphibolites and 

metaultramafic rocks, and were described as Caconde Group (Zanardo, 1992). The Varginha 

Complex represents the high-grade terrain of the Alfenas Granulitic Belt (Hasui et al., 1993). 

The Barbacena Complex gathers (1) more or less migmatized monzogranitic to granodioritic 

gneisses, (2) banded, augen and laminated biotite and/or hornblende gneisses, and (3) sparse 

bodies of orthoamphibolitic rocks, like amphibolites, amphibole schists and amphibole 

gneisses (Hasui et al., 1993). Metamorphism of high amphibolite facies and 

retrometamorphism occurred. The associated supracrustals are essentially metaultramafic and 



Tectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 35 

metamafic rocks, BIFs, schists and varying quartzites, deemed to be portions of a greenstone 

belt. The older units display a complex structural pattern and its understanding has been 

sought since early '60s (Ebert, 1968; Hasui and Oliveira, 1984). Most recent geological and 

geophysical studies show that the general structural framework corresponds to a joining zone 

of two crustal blocks, named Brasília and São Paulo, which represent two paleo-plates 

separated by the Alterosa Suture Zone (Fig. 1); the Araxá/ Canastra sequence is interpreted as 

deposited in a passive margin basin of the Brasília block (Hasui et al., 1993; Ebert and Hasui, 

1998). 

 

The collisional processes have developed a thrust system, which was affected by a late or 

subsequent strike-slip belt, the prevailing conditions varying from ductile to brittle, under 

temperatures of amphibolite facies/kyanite zone, having attained anatexis, decreasing to that 

of low greenschist facies (Zanardo, 1992; Morales, 1993). In the thrust system, there was 

segmentation and transport of the units to form an assemblage of alloctonous, and 

anastomosing, lentiform or sigmoidal masses. Foliation of several kinds (layering, 

compositional banding, schistosity, gneissosity, mylonitic foliation), mineral and stretching 

lineations, countless shear zones and shear bands, and folds of different styles and directions, 

are the most significant features observed in the area. Movement is connected to the 

subduction nearly southwestward of the Brasilia paleo-plate under the São Paulo paleo-plate, 

and lifting of the upper block crust base, represented by the Alfenas Granulitic Belt. The 

strike-slip system, known as Campo do Meio, is a series of sinistral NW-trending strike-slip 

zones, responsible for the sigmoid-shaped domains observed from regional to microscopic 

scale in all lithotypes (Morales, 1993). A number of lens-shaped bodies of metavolcanic and 

metasedimentary rocks of two assemblages can be distinguished (Fig. 2a). 

 

The northernmost bodies in the Fortaleza de Minas-Alpinópolis region represent parts of the 

Morro do Ferro Greenstone Belt, which, together with the Barbacena Complex, configure a 

granite-greenstone terrain of Archean age. Sulfide mineralization and ultramafic flows appear 

in this greenstone belt, the latter with thicknesses of some hundred meters and even more, 

displaying spinifex textures and predominant komatiitic chemistry, in addition to BIFs of 

oxide, sulfide, silicate facies, and graphitic cherts (Teixeira et al., 1987; Brenner et al., 1990; 

Carvalho, 1990; Carvalho et al., 1996). Metamorphism was of amphibolite facies. Fig. 2b 

shows a detail of the area where the Fortaleza de Minas deposit is located.

Fig 2. Geological map of Fortaleza de Minas area. 

The assemblage of the Jacuí-Petúnia-Nova Resende region is related to the Araxá/Canastra 

groups, and display mafic-ultramafic rocks interpreted as ophiolitic, associated to quartzites 

and schists. Several uneconomic bodies of asbestos and podiform chromite are present, and 

also alluvial gold old workings (Carvalho, 1990; Zanardo, 1992; Zanardo et al., 1996). In 

some places, in special in the Jacuí region, the thickness of flows can be seen, as well as 

intermingled meta-sediments, metamorphism of amphibolite facies, chemistry of mafic-

ultramafic rocks and metallogenetic patterns different from those which can be noticed in the 

northernmost bodies.

Local Geology 

The Fortaleza de Minas deposit is located near the homonymous village (Fig. 2b). It is over 

1,700 m long, varying from 2 to l5 m in thickness, and known depths of more than 700 m, 

displaying a sinuous tabular form with dips varying from vertical to 70° SW. Fig. 3 shows a 

NW-SE cross-section to illustrate the general stratigraphy and structure deduced by field data 

and supported by exploration drills. The ore host rocks form the O`Toole Sequence and 

comprises three stratigraphic units referred to as Lower, Intermediary and Upper (Brenner et 

al., 1990). 

 

Fig 3. Litho-structural SW-NE cross-section interpreted after drilling and gravimetric profiles. 

The Upper and Lower units show several similarities. These start as basalt flows of komatiitic 

composition, containing restricted tholeitic basalt insertions and sulfide-bearing basaltic 

metatuffs, closely associated to sulfide graphitic metacherts. Rarely flows show a spinifex 

texture and the top of the lower unit is marked by BIF of oxide facies. The Intermediate Unit, 

informally known as the O’Toole Sequence, consists of four differentiated ultramafic volcanic 

flows. Cyclicity of volcanic processes is well individualized thanks to the presence of a BIF at 

the top of each one. All flows begin with serpentinites after olivine cumulates at the base, 

followed by clinopyroxenite with high Ca contents, low contents of Al and horizons of 

orthocumulate texture; the pyroxenite grade up to metagabbros (amphibolites) in the upper 



Tectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 38 

portion, which are on their turn covered by BIF a few centimeters up to 20 m thick. The upper 

cycle, informally known as the O’Toole Mineralized Cycle, which is more uniform and 

persistent on the sides, hosts in its base portion, the Fortaleza de Minas massive sulfide 

deposit. The ore body, at the footwall, shows a basal contact with the preceding BIF cycle, 

and is covered by massive serpentinite (average thickness of 13 m), which are followed by 

clinopyroxenite (up to l5 m thick), subsequently by amphibolite, representing the thickest unit 

of such cycle (thickness of approximately 20 m), and lastly by a BIF (about 12 m thick), as 

shown on Fig. 4. The contacts between ore and hosts and among the different ore types are 

predominantly sheared. Recently the Inermediate Unit described in Brenner et al., 1990 has 

been interpreted as thick higly fractionated flows formed in a lava lake distal environment 

(Brenner and Carvalho, 2006).

Ore Types 

Four main ore types are identified from hanging wall to footwall: disseminated, matrix, 

breccia and BIF-hosted ore. They can be distinguished by their sulfide content and grades, 

host rock and gangue mineralogy and by textural and structural features. The fine grain 

disseminated sulfides that occur in the serpentinite host in the upper limit of the mineralized 

zone form the disseminated ore. It is composed of 5 to 7% sulfides, 8 to 10% magnetite and 

85% silicate gangue, the silicate gangue being dominantly antigorite with minor talc, 

tremolite and chlorite. Photo 1 (Plate 1) displays fine grain sulfide dissemination in an 



Tectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 39 

antigorite matrix with local concentrations of sulfide along the foliation and P, X, R and T 

type discontinuities. Laterally, along sheared contact zones, this ore type becomes strongly 

deformed, giving rise to a sub-type called sheared ore (Photo 2, Plate 1).

and show no orientation at the borders indicating sulfide flow, interpretation supported by thin and 
continuous layers of pentlandite. Photo 6 - Typical framework of the BIF-hosted ore with sulfides 
being controlled by discontinuities of several types. Note fine grain sulfides following banding and

broken apart and assimilated by the breccia ore. 
 



Tectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 40 

The matrix ore is characterized by a sulfides and oxides matrix involving serpentine 

pseudomorphs of cumulus olivine. The original cumulus olivines were fully replaced by 

antigorite. The typical ore composition includes 30% sulfides, and 10% magnetite in a 

serpentine groundmass. Photo 3 (Plate 1) shows interstitial sulfides in an antigorite 

groundmass. This ore type is also known as net textured ore. 

 
The breccia ore is a tectonic breccia with a massive sulfide matrix and lithic fragments of 

varied proportions and sizes of BIF, serpentinite and talc schist. Its matrix is made up of 60 to 

70% sulfides, 10% oxides and 10 to 20% silicates. They represent the highest grade ore in the 

deposit. Photo 4 (Plate 1) displays a typical breccia ore with a BIF fragment with internal 

folding and small faults from a former deformation. Photo 5 (Plate 1) shows breccia ore with 

rock fragments in a sulfide matrix. 

 
The BIF-hosted ore corresponds to sulfide concentrations along bands and discontinuities in 

the footwall BIF, commonly in contact with the breccia ore. It has a variable composition, 

normally 65 to 90% silicate gangue, 5 to 15% sulfides and 5 to 20% magnetite. Photo 6 (Plate 

1) shows sulfides along discontinuities and intergranular spaces in the BIF-hosted ore. 

According to the Ni grade and total sulfide content, ore types can be grouped into high grade 

ore (&gt; 2% Ni), represented by matrix and breccia ore types, and low grade ore (&amp;lt;2% Ni), 

represented by disseminated, sheared and BIF hosted ore types. Mineralogical studies 

indicated three main mineral phases: the sulfides, the oxides, and the silicates. Pyrrhotite, 

pentlandite and chalcopyrite dominate the sulfide phase. The oxide phase is largely magnetite, 

locally Cr-bearing, and subordinate Ti-magnetite, Mg-ferrite, ilmenite and Fe-chromite. The 

silicate gangue comprises a Mg-rich and a Fe-rich types. The Mg-rich gangue is, in 

decreasing order, serpentine (antigorite), tremolite, actinolite, clinochlore, magnesite and 

dolomite. It occurs dominantly in disseminated, matrix and breccia ore types. The Fe-rich 

gangue is represented by amphiboles, such as cummingtonite, Fe-actinolite, typically in the 

BIF hosted ore and in the BIF fragments from the breccia ore. In addition to the major ore 

minerals, there occurs on an accessory basis a wide variety of minerals of the cobaltite group 

(cobaltite-gersdorffite series) included in pyrrhotite, pentlandite and magnetite, nickel 

telluride (melonite) and bismuth, and traces of platinum group minerals (PGM) included in 

magnetite and pyrrhotite. Sphalerite, galena, tetradimite, nicolite and more scarcely valerite-

maaknawite also appear as accessories. 

 

 



Tectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 41 

The surface alteration processes, acting on the orebody, generated an assembly of 

supergenous minerals, represented by the general development of violarite at the expenses of 

pentlandite and pyrrhotite, and specifically in the location by the formation of pyrite and 

marcasite from pyrrhotite. Closer to the surface, the ore changes to a mass of limonite/goethite 

with a cellular texture and other mineral residue characteristically generated as a product of 

weathering, constituting a typical gossan. Fig. 5 presents the map of the deposit (5a) and a 

detail of the northwestern third (5b). The different ore types can be individualized in the form 

of lenticular bodies of varying sizes, irregularly distributed along the deposit. The 

disseminated and matrix ore types are restricted to the central portion of the deposit between 

sections 1,300N and 1,900N and above level 800 m in the area identified as embayment. They 

occur typically above the basal breccia ore, and the disseminated ore is, most of the times, in 

contact with the hanging wall serpentinite. Local shearing, however, may affect the original 

distribution by inter-layering the ore types or by truncating one or more of them. Broad pinch-

and-swell and necking structures are also common where the overall ore width may vary from 

1 to 13 m. These ore width variations occur very rapidly along strike and down dip an eggbox 

pattern. In this central area the BIF-hosted ore is often limited or absent. However, to the 

north of 1,900N and to the south of 1,300N the BIF hosted ore is well distributed and occurs 

typically associated with sheared ultramafic ore and breccia ore.

The breccia ore is well spread over almost the entire deposit. It forms the basal ore type 

associated with matrix and disseminated ores in the central zone of the deposit or lays within 

BIF-hosted and sheared ores in the lateral extensions and at depth. This spatial placement of 

the different ore types and the distribution of their host rocks indicates the presence of a 

central primary embayment-like structure outlined by the association 

disseminated/matrix/breccia ores and a broader zone of remobilized ore types represented by 

the association BIF-hosted/sheared/breccia ores (Fig. 6). Both ore width and metal content 

decreases from the central embayment zone away, laterally and at depth. The exploratory drift 

was developed along the northern side of the embayment zone until its limits with the 

remobilized zone to the north, from section 1,650N to 2,015N covering different ore types 

associations and tectonic environments. 

 
 

 
Fig 6. Sketch of the embayment structure and main primary ore types. Note paucity of chemical 
sediments (BIF) in the embayment domain. Scale only for reference. 

The word embayment is used here in a broad sense referring to the central thick and rich zone 

were primary ore types were identified. It differs from the typical embayment structures of the 

Western Australian volcanogenic Ni deposits in a few aspects, as follows: (1) the absence of 

steep structures like faults in the lateral limits of the embayment; (2) the presence of Ni ore, 

although weaker, outside the embayment limits; (3) the lack of a clear elongated shape like 

the structures in the Kambalda area (Stone, 2005; Beresford, 2005). These differences could 

be at least partially explained by the intense deformation and shearing that took place in the 

Fortaleza deposit. However, it could also indicate that the Fortaleza deposit is in some way 



Tectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 43 

different from the classic Australian komatiite-hosted volcanogenic Type 1 deposits (Hill and 

Gole, 1990; Hill, 2001; Lesher and Keays, 2002). The komatiite-hosted Type 1 deposits refer 

to the original therminology volcanic peridotite associated deposits (VPA) in opposition to the 

intrusive dunite associated deposits (IDA) (Marston et al., 1981; Marston, 1984), later 

reviewed as Type 2 deposits. Type 1 deposits are characterized by accummulations at the base 

of komatiite lava flows of massive and matrix or net-textured ores with 40-60wt% of sulfides 

as a matrix to original olivines. Type 2 deposits are large low grade sulfide disseminations 

commonly formed in the core of thick olivine cumulate undifferentiated sills. The Ni/Cu ratio 

from Fortaleza is about 6:1 which places it in between the typical Type 1 deposits (Ni/Cu &gt; 

20:1) and the intrusive gabbroic type deposits (Ni/Cu &amp;lt;3:1). Another indication for the 

embayment structure is given by the paucity of footwall sulfidic sediments (BIF) in the 

embayment area (Fig. 6) and the distribution of the S/Ni ratio in the ore. The S/Ni ratio is 

typically 3.5:1 or 4.0:1 in the central embayment zone and gradually increases to 6:1 and 

higher as we move laterally and also downwards (down dip and along strike) from the 

embayment zone.

general NW-SE trend are delimited by sinistral brittle-ductile strike-slip shear zones. In the 

deposit area there appears one such feature (Fig. 2). The supracrustals are bounded by a 

principal strike-slip shear zone at southwest and another one in the northeastern side (Fig. 3); 

the last one and several inner secondary shear zones have slip with dip components, to which 

is related the tilting of wedge-shaped blocks towards southwest and the distribution of the 

stratigraphic units in the section. The general framework is a negative flower structure, a 

transtensional feature related to the Campo do Meio Strike-Slip System. 

 

The sketch of Fig. 5c is the Riedel model for a left-hand NW-SE simple shear recognized in 

regional scale (Fig. 1), indicating the direction of the several types of shear zones (P, Y or D, 

R, X and R’) and tension fracture (T). Host rocks and parts of the ore body are broken up into 

other smaller bodies through several smaller strike-slip zones, so that the structure is marked 

by anastomosed pattern of juxtaposed lentiform portions, which is reflected in the sinuous 

tracings of the several lithotypes and ore, and may be observed from large to microscopic 



Tectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 44 

scales (Santos 1996). 

In addition to the shear zone of the southern border, of general direction N45W and high dip 

towards southwest, such smaller strike-slip zones have general directions around NNW-SSE, 

WNW-ESE, NW-SE and NE-SW, and high-angle dips, which correspond respectively to P, 

R, Y e R' in the Riedel model. Kinematic indicators show that displacements were dextral for 

R' zones and sinistral for the others, consistent with the overall sinistral movement of the 

Campo do Meio Strike-Slip System. 

 

The ore shows a mylonitic foliation, as a rule parallel to the schistosity, layering and 

compositional banding of the lithotypes present therein. This foliation has a preferred 

direction about N47W/sub-vertical (Fig. 7a), with anastomosed fabric around smaller 

lenticular bodies. To this foliation are associated mineral and stretching lineations defined by 

the direction and elongation of amphibole, quartz, magnetite e sulfide, with general 

N47W/sub-horizontal orientation (Fig. 7b). A stretching lineation around N30E/85SW can 

also be observed (close to the center of the Fig. 7b stereogram), and which is parallel to axis 

Y of the finite deformation ellipsoid; it is interpreted as a structure generated during the 

earlier thrust movement and rotated by the later strike-slip displacement.

Folds are not rare in the area. Those of the intrafolial type may be better noticed in the BIFs, 

displaying sizes ranging from millimeters to centimeters, styles from closed to isoclinal, axial 

planes parallel to the mylonitic foliation and axis parallel to the stretching lineation. Drag 

folds are common in the exploration drift, both on the ore and also in the host rocks. In 



Tectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 45 

addition to these features, crenulations and kink bands also appear, following in one or more 

directions in the schistified portions of hosts. Besides these brittle-ductile deformation 

features, another important assembly of structures generated in a last brittle regime can also 

be seen, represented by faults and joints. 

 

Faults are noticeable features, marked by cataclastic rocks and slickensides, continuous for 2 

to 3 m and in directions NW-SE, WNW-ESE, NE-SW e NNE-SSW, predominantly of strike-

slip type and sub-vertical. To these are associated remobilized sulfides, particularly pyrrhotite 

and chalcopyrite, with a frequent presence of carbonates, forming sigmoids and filling tension 

gashes. There are also normal faults with direction WNW-ESE and subordinately NW-SE, 

frequently filled with chrysolite, carbonate, pyrite or limonite. Fault surfaces were preferably 

nucleated along the existent shear zones. 

 

Several crossed joint sets are present in the deposit area, particularly with NW-SE, WNW-

ESE, NE-SW and NNE-SSW directions. The NW-SE and WNW-ESE sets are mainly 

responsible for water percolation and supergenic alteration of the deposit. This two joint sets, 

along with NNE-SSW faults, are coincident with the Y, R and R´ Riedel directions 

determined for the area. All such features may be attributed to the same tectonic system which 

originated the Campo do Meio Strike-Slip Belt, which allows to consider that the strike-slip 

movement event began under amphibolite facies temperature conditions and progressively 

went on until reaching the stage of brittle behavior. 

Smaller Structures 

The shear zones and faults have deeply affected the original mineralization, by introducing 

new structures, remobilization, transformations and reconcentration of ore, in a transtensive 

context, that is to say, tectonic and metamorphic processes were important in the 

conformation of the deposit. The different ore types are greatly affected by brittle-ductile 

shear zones P, Y, R e R'. T surfaces have also developed in more competent lithotypes. The 

several types of surfaces do not appear separately, but show overlaying and interactions which 

may be rather complex, as is normal in deformation by non-coaxial shear. Simpler situations 

of two sets of surfaces successively developed can be better seen on disseminated ore, where 

sulfides tend to be arranged according to an anastomosed structure, mainly defined by 

surfaces R e P (Photomicrography 1, Plate 2). In the remnants of serpentinites one can clearly 

identify structures of the S-C type, defined by large and sigmoidal serpentines (S) and by 



Tectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 46 

planes and overlaying brittle-ductile shear zones (C). More complex situations result from the 

intervention of more than two types de planes: structures developed by surfaces R, intersected 

by other surfaces P and subsequently by R’ zones, stand out since the last two delineate a 

nearly orthogonal reticular structure (Photomicrography 2, Plate 2). In these events, features 

of the S-C-type tend to be destroyed.

Tectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 47 

Along surfaces there occurred a general recrystallization of antigorite which shows 

intergrowth with other pre-existing serpentines. Inside some lenses one can notice 

recrystallization of the serpentine along planes perpendicular to the stretching lineation, with 

the development of an intergrowth texture of sulfide and magnetite, suggesting that this 

texture occurs in portions less damaged by shear. As a rule, sulfides and oxides have also 

suffered from recrystallization, with an increase in granulation. Sulfides are represented 

predominantly by pyrrhotite displaying intergrowth with flake-like crystals of antigorite well 

developed and secondarily with magnetite. Pyrrhotite masses show evidence of mobility, 

whereas the pentlandite aggregates, with a less ductile behavior, acquire lenticular shapes 

(Photomicrography 3, Plate 2). 

Disseminated Ore 

Dissemination occurs under the form of intergrowth textures of silicate+sulfide, 

silicate+sulfide+magnetite, or silicate+magnetite, preferably oriented along brittle-ductile 

shear planes. Silicate in the intergrowth textures is predominantly serpentine, but may also 

occur as carbonate e chlorite (Photomicrography 4, Plate 2). Two types de microstructures are 

present, orthogonal reticular and anastomosed, the first predominating. In the sheared ore, the 

orthogonal reticular pattern tends to give way to the anastomosed oriented according to the 

major foliation and transitional features are rather common. Late right or left-lateral faults and 

some veins filled with chalcopyrite and/or magnetite and/or pyrrhotite and recrystallized 

carbonate are relatively common. Pyrrhotite forms lenses oriented parallel to foliation, 

migrating in the direction of these faults and veins. Lenses occur in an aggregate manner, with 

pyrrhotite showing a polygonal texture resulting from annealing, with intergranular 

pentlandite (locally altered to bravoite-violarite), sometimes sphalerite, and also by 

chalcopyrite. The disseminated ore behaved in a stiffer manner toward deformation, due to its 

lesser quantity of sulfides, presenting only an inner rearrangement of the latter at a 

microscopic level and without the evidence of deformation noticed in massive breccia ore. 

Matrix Ore 

Although displaying a geological and mineralogical evolution similar to the disseminated ore, 

the matrix ore behaved in a more ductile manner toward regional deformation. Such behavior 

is due to the greater proportion of the sulfide and oxide phases, which originally surrounded 

individual olivine cumulate crystals (forsterite), magnetite and chromite. Continuous 

movement along the shear zones promoted extensive recrystallization and mineralogical and 



Tectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 48 

textural changes in the ore. Thereby sulfides, specially pyrrhotite, pentlandite and 

chalcopyrite form chained arrangements, intergranular to antigorite, Fe-chromite and 

magnetite, which represent respectively the original olivine, chromite and magnetite 

(Photomicrography 5, Plate 2). Recrystallizations are noticed particularly in pentlandite, 

which forms coarse grain lentiform aggregates parallel to the mylonitic formation. Pyrrhotite 

occurs in polycrystalline aggregates with polygonal contacts due to annealing; pyrrhotite, 

contrary to pentlandite, had a more mobile behavior, adjusting among silicate and oxide 

minerals. Antigorite, iron-chromite and magnetite also as a rule present lenticular forms and 

textures of intergrowth with sulfides. These features occur controlled by zones R or P and, 

locally, Y. The orthogonal reticular pattern is visible only in lenticularised antigorite masses, 

which show a stiffer behavior toward deformation. In addition to the lenticular aspect, 

antigorite also displays sigmoidal forms at places saved from intense deformation. Small 

concentrations of sulfides, magnetite and Fe-chromite intergrow with antigorite, occur in the 

inner shear planes of such lenses, subdividing it into smaller lenses. In some places one can 

note predominance, stronger persistence and continuity of the R shear zones as compared to 

P, or vice-versa. In all shear zones R, P and Y, which control the matrix ore, small quantities 

of talc and carbonates (magnesite) occur, exhibiting strong deformation (mylonitic and 

schlieren type structures). Late ore occurs filling extension fractures T, generally consisting 

only of chalcopyrite and sporadically pyrrhotite in the central region and chalcopyrite (later 

on) or magnetite and chalcopyrite at the ends. Chalcopyrite is frequently presented as millerite 

along the cleavage planes and fractures, or as small-embedded grains; it shows gemination, 

orthogonal spear-shaped flakes in between, and also recrystallization forming a 

polycrystalline mass consisting of polygonal sub-grains. Pyrrhotite in these veins frequently 

occurs as polygonal sub-grains, in general associated with pentlandite also as polygonal sub-

grains, and likewise with exsolutions of a flame pentlandite, partially altered to bravoite-

violarite. Traces of cobaltite can be noticed, particularly included in magnetite. Frequent 

sulfide inclusions are present in magnetites. Sphalerite occurs in small quantities included in 

magnetite or as exsolution flakes in pentlandite. 

Breccia Ore 

As happens with the other types, the massive breccia is presented metamorphosed, deformed, 

recrystallized, and with silicate-sulfide, oxide-sulfide and silicate-oxide intergrowth textures, 

always controlled by shear zones, in a manner similar to what is seen in the richer portions of 

matrix ore. Ratios between the limits of sulfide, silicate and oxide grains are more varied, 



Tectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 49 

reflecting the nature of inclusions and/or lithic fragments present in it. Such fragments are 

mineralogically heterogeneous and derivate, in varying proportions, from ultramafic rocks 

and from BIFs, both metamorphosed and tectonized. Normally they show ductile and brittle 

deformation prior to their engulfing by massive sulfide (Photo 4, Plate 1). As a rule, pre-

existing fractures in these clasts are filled by chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite and secondarily by 

pentlandite, which represent remobilization processes subsequent to the formation and 

deformation of the major ore which occurs as the matrix for the clasts. However, they also 

show evidences of recrystallization and deformation. Mineralogically, inclusions consist of 

serpentines, chlorites, various types of amphibole of the tremolite/actinolite/iron-actinolite 

and cummingtonite/grünerite series, and fine elongated aggregates of talc and chlorite. The 

sulfide phase (pyrrhotite, pentlandite) occurring as a matrix presents intense recrystallization, 

constituting crystalline aggregates with polygonal arrangements. Intergrowth textures of 

sulfides with antigorite, magnetite and iron-chromite are common and similar to those 

occurring in matrix ore. Pyrrhotites in particular host outer granular exsolutions of 

pentlandite, developed in the interface with the silicate phases, acquiring larger sizes at 

contact points and triple seams of polycrystal aggregates (Photomicrography 6, Plate 2). More 

rarely there occur small quantities of pentlandites, developed as exsolution bodies in the shape 

of a flame within pyrrhotites. Both such types of exsolution are recrystallized and are 

common features in this type of ore. These features exhibited by the massive breccia ore, like 

all others, indicate the operation of successive tectonic events upon a pre-existing 

monosulfide solid solution and its derivates. Such modifications are particularly outstanding 

at places where the brittle-ductile shear zones R, P and Y, as well as the extension zones T, 

have enabled ore remobilization and reconcentration. Millimetric and centimetric size 

lenticular fragments of serpentinites and BIF, lodged and oriented by sulfide flows in Y shear 

zones, laterally grade toward regions where the flow was less intense and as a result 

fragments are less oriented (Photo 6, Plate 1). Such features show that the sulfide 

remobilization at first penetrated in the host walls controlled by structures R and P, which 

progressively have engulfing and tearing out the almond-shaped fragments from the host, 

which then become a part of the ore body. At places, where these fragments are incorporated 

by Y shear zones, they are presented disperses and/or oriented parallel to mylonitic foliation. 

In lenses new subordinate penetrations of sulfides, predominantly chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite, 

can occur along the inner foliation, zones R and P, and subordinately from fractures; such 

sulfides also present recrystallizations, and seem to be associated to the last deforming event 

which operated upon the deposit. In those areas showing more active remobilization 

processes, one can notice in microscopic and mesoscopic scale, narrow and continuous 



Tectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 50 

parallel beds of recrystallized pentlandite, of a more brittle behavior than pyrrhotite. It can 

also be noticed in serpentinite fragments the presence of pressure shadows of the ? and ? 

types filled by pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite and pentlandite. Magnetite, Fe-chromite and antigorite, 

occurring as small anastomosed grains inside the sulfide matrix and inside serpentinitic 

lenses, progressively migrate toward the shear planes. When present inside Y zone, magnetite 

and iron-chromite are drawn. Platinoids occur as small inclusions in magnetite and pyrrhotite. 

It is relatively frequent the presence of extensional fractures and microscopic recrystallized 

carbonate veins (magnetite and Fe-dolomite), with elongated sub-grains and wavy extinction, 

having associated sulfides and magnetite; such fractures and veins show that they have been 

affected by a left- or right-lateral strike-slip movement. This carbonate is encompassed by the 

sulfide mass in some places. 

BIF-hosted Ore 

This ore type, of local occurrence, in the embayment area, genetically differs from the 

magmatic disseminated, matrix and massive breccia ores. In this case, mineralization takes 

place by filling cracks, fractures, faults and other structures existing in BIFs (oxide, silicate, 

sulfide facies) that are in contact with massive breccia ore in the footwall (Photomicrography 

5, Plate 2). This is a mineralization process whose origin is related to metamorphic and 

tectonic processes that have provoked and controlled mobilization of pre-existing sulfides 

(magmatic) on the basis of ultramafic flows for the BIF, their current hosts. Mineralogical 

associations which constitute this ore, except for the silicate association introduced by the 

BIF, are strictly the same which constitute the other ore already described herein, with a 

predomination of pyrrhotite, pentlandite, chalcopyrite, magnetite, Fe-chromite etc. The new 

silicate phase is mainly formed by amphiboles, such as cummingtonite and/or Fe-actinolite, in 

addition to quartz, and more locally carbonate, Fe-pyrosmalite and chlorite. Despite occurring 

late, it can be noticed in the ore complex intergrowth textures among sulfides, oxides and 

silicates, a general recrystallization of sulfides and quartz, evidencing that it same have 

suffered at least partially a tectonic and metamorphic evolution similar to that of magmatic 

ore. The major structural control in the formation of this ore is related to shear zones R, P and 

Y, which serve as main conduct for sulfide mobilization. Such deformation, visible in all 

observation scales, led to the formation of varying size lenses of a BIF, which on its turn may 

be subdivided into smaller lenses. Depending on the continuity of this process and the 

proximity of massive breccia ore, these lenses have been incorporated and absorbed by this 

ore, or were replaced, in part or fully in situ. Sulfide ore, in particular concentrated along the 



Tectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 51 

tension gashes, spaces between boudins and along faults, display to be strongly recrystallized, 

intergrowth textures and polygonal textures of pentlandite exsolution in pyrrhotite, similar to 

that described above in disseminated, matrix and breccia ore. 

Tectono-metamorphic evolution of the  deposit 

Despite the transformations suffered by the Fortaleza de Minas deposit and its host, the 

mineral paragenesis by pyrrhotite-pentlandite-chalcopyrite and magnetite, present all around 

the massive breccia, matrix and disseminated ore, constitutes a strong evidence indicating that 

the formation of same is connected to ultramafic lava fractionating processes. Furthermore, 

textural and phase relations among such sulfides, in conformity with modern genetic models, 

e.g., the billiard-ball model (Naldret, 1973; Naldrett and Campbell, 1982; Lesher et al., 1984; 

Lesher and Stone, 1996; Naldrett, 2005), prove that they represent solidification products 

from a monosulfide solid solution (MSS), subsequently modified by metamorphism and 

deformation. These tectonic processes recorded on the ore and its hosts due to the presence of 

shear zone, mylonitisation, cataclasis, recrystallization and textural modifications, indicate the 

evolution history of the deposit, affecting the primary embayment structure proposed by 

Brenner et al. (1990), schematically presented in Fig. 6. The first transformations could 

perhaps be related to the brittle-ductile thrust in the beginning of the collisional process; 

however, despite deformation and metamorphism having taken place under thermal 

conditions of amphibolite facies, no mineral transformations nor changes in the primary 

stratigraphic disposition of the deposit was not identified. This difficulty is due to the marked 

operation of the Campo do Meio Strike-Slip System, which later on superimposed the 

collisional process. Strike-slip displacements imposed a near verticalization of lithotypes and 

the deposit, as well as the now noted transformations, which took place under temperatures 

consistent with the greenschist and lower facies. In addition to one of the larger shear zones, 

in the deposit can be seen several smaller zones of varying orientations, besides all kinds of 

discontinuities, features which have developed in succession and involved repeated sulfide 

remobilization and mineralogical alterations. 

Conclusions 

Collisional processes in southwestern Minas Gerais have developed an extensive thrust 

system, upon which later on the Campo do Meio Strike-Slip System superimposed, which 

imposed upon the region a structure of varying size wedge-shaped bodies, including to the 

Morro do Ferro Greenstone Belt. The belt located to the south of Fortaleza de Minas, which 



Tectonics and Mineralization of the Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Fortaleza de Minas Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil 52 

hosts the Ni-Cu-Co deposit, has a general orientation around NW-SE, is delimited by an 

anticlockwise strike-slip shear zone at the southwestern border, and has a rather complex 

inner structure, involving several other shear zones with slip having significant dip component 

in a transtension context, and minor brittle-ductile shear zones of types P, R, Y e R', as well as 

discontinuities of type T. These structures are related to the sinistral Campo do Meio 

Transcurrent System. The thermal conditions of this tectonic event were of the greenschist 

facies, going down to lower levels, where the rocks acquired a brittle behavior. Some 

subsequent strike-slip and normal faults are also observed. 

Anastomosed geometry of the brittle-ductile shear zone can be noticed as from the scale of 

host masses and the several ore types (breccia, matrix, disseminated and BIF hosted ore), 

down to microscopic lenses of mineral grains. It is admitted that primary sulfides, of 

magmatic origin, should already have been settled as masses of massive type at the base, and 

gradually and transitionally passed on to matrix and from this to disseminated at the top. 

Upon this assembly processes of strong deformation, remobilization and reconcentration have 

operated, controlled by the shear zones and faults. Remobilization on the breccia ore and 

locally on the more sheared terms was more active than on the matrix and disseminated ore, 

having generated the banded iron formation ore, although the original zoning was maintained.

The Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: An Example of Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Deposit in Highly Fractionated Ponded Flows 56 

Abstract 

The Fortaleza de Minas nickel sulfide deposit (formerly known as O`Toole) is hosted by a 

highly fractioned thick flow within komatiitic sheet flows of the Guariroba-Peroba segment of 

the archean Morro do Ferro Greenstone Belt. The fractionated flow has been affected by high 

grade metamorphism, folding and intense shearing destroying almost completely its primary 

volcanic textures. Whole rock chemistry  indicates a komatiitic composition although no 

spinifex texture has been found so far. Each individual flow unit is fractionated into a basal 

olivine-cumulate, a pyroxene-cumulate zone and an upper gabbro zone. The upper flow unit 

hosts a Type 1 nickel sulfide mineralization. This flow shows similarity with other 

fractionated thick flows (e.g. Fred’s flow from Munro, Township) and contrasts with the 

majority of komatiite related nickel sulfide deposits hosts; normally a thick and channelized 

ortho-cumulate flow laterally capped with spinifex textured thin flows. The volcanic 

environment for the Fortaleza de Minas fractionated flow is interpreted as a distal lava lake 

ponded facies. The Ni deposit host is characterized by a high Cr x Ni signature which 

contrasts with the common low Cr x Ni mineralized channelized flows from the majority of 

Type 1 deposits. 

 

Introduction 

Since the start up of the mine a great ammount of new data became available regarding the 

volcanic host rocks of the Fortaleza de Minas (formerly O`Toole) deposit (Brenner et al. 

1990).  The highly fractionated flow that host the nickel mineralization was strongly affected 

by metamorphism and intense deformation resulting in almost complete obliteration of 

primary volcanic textures. The original volcanic rock types were completely transformed 

during metamorphic events but their major chemical composition is considered to be roughly 

preserved and still valid for characterization of its original composition. The mineralogical 

and petrochemical characteristics of the deposit komatiitic host flow is discussed herein and 

compared to the barren komatiitic flows from the Morro do Ferro greenstone belt in the 

Guariroba-Peroba segment. The fractionated flow shows a distinctive mineralogical and 

chemical composition when compared to the majority of the komatiite related nickel sulfide 

deposits. For the discussions on komatiite lithologies the igneous terminology is adopted and 

the term meta- is assumed.

Geological setting 

The regional geology of the deposit area was described in Brenner et al (1990), Teixeira et al 

(1987) and Marchetto et al (1984) and has been reviewed more recently (Zanardo et al, 1996; 

Zanardo, 1992 and Morales, 1993). The archean Morro do Ferro greenstone belt (Teixeira &amp;amp; 

Danni, 1979) occurs at the southern limit of the archean Paramirim craton along a EW 

trending block of granite-greenstone terrain cut by a system of sinistral transcurrent shear 

zones (Fig. 1). Sm/Nd isotopic results from the Ni deposit host flow revealed an isochron age 

of 2.86 + 65 Ga for the cristalization of the lavas (Pimentel &amp;amp; Ferreira Filho, 2002). 

Migmatites from the same area have a Rb/Sr isochron age of 2.92 + 0.11 Ga (Schrank and 

Silva, 1993). These ages are compatible to the Piumhi greenstone belt (ca. 2.9 – 3.1 Ga), 

(Machado and Schrank, 1989). The granite-greenstone terrain is limited in the South by the 

archean Alfenas granulite belt and to the North by Proterozoic supracrustal sediments. In the 

Guariroba-Peroba segment, where the Ni deposit is located (Fig. 2), a thick pile of komatiites 

and komatiitic basalts occur with subordinate horizons of banded iron formation. The SW 

margin of this greenstone segment is interpreted as the lower portion of the belt which hosts 

the fractionated flows and related Ni sulfide deposit, and the upper portion being represented 

by the thick chemical-detritical sediments at the NE margin of the belt in the Peroba area (Fig. 

2). The SW margin of this segment is characterized by strong airborne magnetic anomalies 

reflecting the higher proportion of komatiites and olivine-cumulates. The Ni deposit is 

associated with a large and strong magnetic anomaly (Fig. 2b).

The major event of folding and regional metamorphism is assumed to be occurred during the 

paleoproterozoic Transamazonian Orogeny (2.16 – 2.0 Ga). Metamorphism achieved high 

amphibolite facies in the deposit area, where temperatures higher than 650 oC are indicated by 

amphibole paragenesis from the deposit footwall BIF (Fernandes, 1998).  In the Alpinópolis 

area, to the northeast, Szabó, (1996), reports temperatures for peak metamorphism between 

720 to 780 oC and pressures between 3 to 6 kbar. Amphiboles from the footwall banded iron 

formation indicated an Ar/Ar cooling age of ca. 2.0 Ga (Fernandes, 1998). By the closure of 

the peak metamorfism the olivine-cumulates were fully converted to massive serpentinites. 

Olivine pseudomorphs are the only indication of original olivines. Original chromites were 

transformed into Cr-magnetite. Despite the high metamorphic grade and the intense shearing 

observed in the area, primary cumulate textures have been observed in drill cores and 

underground exposures, mostly in pyroxene-cumulate rocks. Outside the deposit area, where 

shearing was less intense, spinifex textures, flow breccia and nodular peridotite can be seen in 

scattered outcrops (Brenner et al, 1990). The region was later affected by intense transcurrent 

shearing during the Brasiliano Cycle (900 –520 Ma) with reactivation of major regional 

faults. Retrograde metamorphism with temperature not higher than 300oC associated with 

intense ductile-brittle shearing promoted partial transformation of serpentinites into talc-

carbonate schists with high CO2 fluid pressure. Fractionated gabbros from the deposit area 

were converted into actinolite-albite-epidote schist or fels. Undeformed post-tectonic gabbro 

and diabase dykes were fully retrograded to greenschist paragenesis in the Brasiliano Cycle 

without loosing their original magmatic textures (Fig. 3a). These basic dykes are common in 

the region and are assumed to be of mesoproterozoic age. Similar basic dykes, in the São João 

del Rei area, have a Sm/Nd model age of 1.7-1.3 Ga, which dates the beginning of the 

Brasiliano neoproterozoic sedimentation (Heilbron et al, 2004).

Komatiitic flows in the deposit area 
 
Brenner et al (1990) identified four cycles or flow units comprising serpentinite - clino-

pyroxenite - gabbro separated by usually thin banded iron formation horizons. These flow 

units defined the intermediate sequence or O’Toole sequence, which lies in a thight syncline 

between a lower and an upper sequence represented by komatiite and komatiitic basalt flows 

with interbedded horizons of graphitic meta-chert, BIF and cherty-tuffs (black shales). The 

nickel deposit is hosted by the uppermost cycle or flow unit from the intermediate sequence 

(fig. 4). The upper and lower sequences represent the dominant units in the Guariroba-Peroba 

area. The intermediate sequence is currently interpreted as a thick highly fractionated flow 

where the individual cycles represent individual flow units separated by thin BIF. (fig. 5). The 

flow units are commonly 50 to 100m thick, except when intensely sheared, and several km 

long, being laterally truncated by shear zones in contact with granitic basement (fig. 6). 

Although intensely sheared, folded and laterally truncated the Fortaleza de Minas fractionated 

flow displays a minimum unfolded length of about 7km long by 2km wide with an average 

width of 150m.

The Guariroba – Peroba komatiitic flows 

The komatiites from the Guariroba-Peroba segment are dominantly fine grained rocks 

exhibiting foliated textures and subordinate massive textures where volcanic textures such 

as spinifex, pillow lavas and flow tops, were mostly destroyed by metamorphism and 

shearing. They range from chlorite-tremolite schists and chlorite-talc/serpentine-tremolite 

schist to massive serpentinites and talc schists from ortho-cumulates. Metamorphic or 

magmatic olivines are extremely rare in the cumulates. Most of the komatiites of peridotitic 

and olivine-peridotite composition are now chlorite-carbonate-talc schists. The komatiitic 

basalts are represented by chlorite-actinolite schists, chlorite-tremolite schists and 

plagioclase-actinolite schists where most of the plagioclase is now replaced by epidote and 

carbonate. Common BIF assemblages are quartz-cummingtonite-actinolite-(magnetite) and 

cummingtonite-tremolite-magnetite. These assemblages indicate a progressive amphibolite 

metamorfic facies with superimposed retrograde greenschist facies paragenesis. Primary 

volcanic textures such as spinifex and pillow lavas are locally preserved (Fig. 3b).  

Mineralogy of the thick fractionated flow 

The Fortaleza de Minas deposit host flow has fractionated into three distinct rock types: a 

basal olivine-cumulate zone (SS/TT), an intermediate pyroxene cumulate zone (PI) and an 

upper gabbroic zone (AT) (fig. 5). The gradational change from the pyroxene cumulate to 

gabbro is marked by the appearence of porfiritic plagioclase building up to a medium 

massive gabbroic texture. The pyroxene cumulate zone is normally quite massive, (except 

for highly sheared zones in the lower flows) and often display one to two internal sub-zones 

of preserved adcumulate to meso-cumulate texture. The lower olivine cumulate zone has a 

massive texture and has been fully serpentinized and partially talcified. It is interpreted to 

correspond to an ortho-cumulate based on its MgO content (33–38%) but also by preserved 

ortho-cumulate texture from the matrix ore. The contact with the upper pyroxene cumulate 

zone is sharp and commonly slightly sheared but continuous gradational contact has been 

also observed in a few bore holes. The metamorphic mineralogical composition of the 

different fractionated zones is shown in Table 1.

The olivine-cumulate zone is represented by massive serpentinites (SS) with 50-90 wt% 

antigorite and 10-15 w% magnetite displaying typical mesh texture (Fig. 3c). Particularly in 

sheared or pinching zones the massive serpentinite can be replaced by chlorite – carbonate - 

talc schists (TT) with talc ranging from 30-60 wt%, carbonate (dolomite) from 20-50 wt% and 

chlorite from 5-20 wt% (Fig. 3d).  Like in the serpentinites magnetite ranges between 10-15 

wt%. Intermediate members between TT and SS are found in transition zones. The 

intermediate pyroxene-cumulate zone (PI) is dominantly represented by massive and poorly 

foliated chlorite-tremolite-actinolite schist or fels where tremolite-actinolite normally range 

from 75-90 wt% (Fig. 3e). Tremolite is much more common but actinolite and hornblend may 

be present. Pyroxene occurs as coarse crystals (augite – diopside) or as pseudomorphs being 

replaced by tremolite and hornblend. This zone displays one to two internal sub-zones of 

meso-cumulate to ad-cumulate textures with coarse augite – diposide cumulus within a 

hornblend tremolite fine grain matrix with magnetite. Rare plagioclase and talc may be found 

in this zone. Petrographic evidences indicate processes of mineral transformation as follows: 

Pyroxene &gt; hornblende &gt; actinolite-tremolite &gt; chlorite. The upper gabbro zone (AT) is 

represented by medium grain massive anfibolites where actinolite is dominant (75-85 wt%) 

followed by plagioclase and/or epidote – carbonate (Fig. 3f). The original andesine has been 

almost completely transformed into albite + epidote + carbonate. Due to the metamorphic and 

shearing processes typical flow tops can no longer be identified. However in the upper contact 

with the chemical sediments, typically oxide facies banded iron formation (Figs. 3g, h), a 

zone of fine to very fine grained actinolite-tremolite schist is observed in many places and are 



The Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: An Example of Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Deposit in Highly Fractionated Ponded Flows 65 

also commonly associated with carbonate veinlets or stringers. These features are interpreted 

as possible metamorphic equivalents to flow tops (Fig. 3i). 

Petrochemical characteristics of the komatiitic flows 

The komatiitic lavas in the Guariroba-Peroba greenstone segment are represented by typical 

komatiites (18-25 wt% MgO) with subordinate cumulates (34 wt% MgO) and komatiitic 

basalts (10-15 wt% MgO). They show a differentiation trend similar to other archean 

komatiitic flows (Fig. 7a, b). Some samples display local drift to the CaO side as shown in 

figure 7a. Due to the high amphibolite facies metamorphism, intense weathering, deformation 

and shearing, volcanic textures such as spinifex, pillow lavas and flow tops are normally 

absent. With the escavations for the construction of the Ni plant site several exposures of 

spinifex texture and pillow lava were shown north of the nickel deposit (Fig. 3b). However, 

the outcrops are scarse and preclude any reconstruction of the entire flow structure. Most borehole 

cores show recristalized fine to medium grained foliated rocks. The fractionated deposit rocks 

have a distinctive massive texture and, regardless the intense drilling carried out in the mine area, 

they do not show spinifex textures. Chemical data show a marked switch towards the CaO side in 

the MgO-CaO-Al2O3 ternary diagram with a bended differentiation trend (Fig. 7a). The Fortaleza 

de Minas trend is similar to the Barbeton trend (Viljoen et al, 1982; Viljoen and Viljoen, 1982), 

rather than the Western Australian komatiites behaviour (Lesher and Keays, 2002; Hill, 2001).

Whole rock composition of major rock types from the Guariroba-Peroba segment is shown in 

Table 2. Whole rock composition of major rock types from the thick fractionated flow is 

shown in Table 3. The olivine-cumulate zones from the lower individual flow units are listed 

apart from the upper mineralized flow unit and this is also split into trough and flank 

environment. The olivine-cumulate zone from the trough environment shows higher MgO 

values and also higher Ni, Cr, Cu, Co values. Only non mineralized samples were used 

(S&lt;0.30 wt%). Table 4 display olivine-cumulates for different individual flow units in both 

limbs of the syncline structure. The dataset summarized on these tables are displayed as 

scatter-plots on figure 8 highlighting the fractionation trend for the fractionated flow. SiO2 

and Al2O3 show a typical negative correlation with MgO.

The fractionated flow gabbro zone may plot partially out of the original limit between 

komatiitic and tholeitic basalts as defined by Jensen (1976) for the Jensen cation plot. Viljoen 

et al (1982) proposed a revision of Jensen limits for the Barbeton komatiites (Fig, 9). The data 

fits better to the limits proposed by Viljoen as it moves towards the field of tholeitic high Mg 

basalts. The proposed limit for komatiites and komatiitic basalts falls within the pyroxene-

cumulate zone. The observed boundaries for the fractionated flow is shown as a dotted line. 

The higher dispersion of the data for the gabbro zone can be related to modifications of 

original composition during metamorphism. However, for the olivine-cumulate zone - where 

processes of retrograde metamorphism with high CO2 pressure formed talc-carbonate rocks 

after serpentinites derived from primary olivine-cumulates - the dispersion of the data is 

considered to be negletable even considering the high amount of volatiles in the serpentinite 

(SS) and talc-carbonate schist (TT) (average 11% (SS) and 13% (TT), maximum 21% (SS) 

and 23% (TT)).

Due to metamorphism and shearing no olivine and cromite were preserved. The olivine 

cumulates have been completely transformed into serpentinites and talc carbonate rocks. The 

estimation of the original bulk composition was inferred from the proportions and average 

MgO contents of each fractionated zone of the flow. From a comprehensive borehole database 

the weighted average bulk MgO content was estimated, ranging between 18 and 23 wt% MgO 

(Appendix 1).  

Geological model for volcanogenic komatiitic related Ni - Fe sulfide deposits 

The most accepted model today for this type of mineralization is well documented in many 

recent papers (Lesher and Keays, 2002; Lesher, 1989; Hill, 2001; Hill et al, 2004; Barnes et 

al, 2004; and Nadrett, 2005) and is related to assimilation of sulfides by thermal erosion 

processes in channelized komatiite flows. The different volcanic environment show 

distinctive features as function of the proximity to the feeder area for the lava flows. Lesher 

and Keays (2002) and Hill (2001) classified the komatiite related sulfide deposits into 

different types regarding their volcanic setting. The Fortaleza de Minas deposit shows 

characteristics of a Type 1 mineralization of distal facies with a shallow thermal erosion 

trough in a thick highly fractionated flow. The major characteristics of Type 1 deposits 

described in Lesher and Keays (2002) are the presence of a basal massive sulfide followed by 



The Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: An Example of Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Deposit in Highly Fractionated Ponded Flows 71 

matrix and disseminated ores in an ortho-cumulate thick zone associated with a trough or 

channel formed by thermal erosion (fig. 10).

Cowden and Roberts 1990 in Hill 2001. c schematic cross-section illustrating  the formation of Type 1 
Ni deposit through thermal-mechanical erosion of sulfidic sediments after Hill 2001. 
 
 
Most of the Type 1 deposit flows show indications of local contamination processes related to 

thermomechanical erosion of Sulfur-rich rocks beneath lava channels (Lesher and Keays, 

2002; Lesher and Arndt, 1995). Indications of crustal contamination such as enrichment in 

light rare-earth elements (Fig. 11) can be found in many komatiite lava flowing conduits by 

thermomechanical erosion and assimilation of felsic tuffs and banded iron formations. 

Extensive sulfide/ oxide bearing banded iron formations in the Fortaleza de Minas deposit 

area are interpreted as the major source for crustal contamination. Sulfur isotopes and S/Se 

ratios (Choudhuri et al., 1997) and Re-Os isotopes (Correia et al., 2001) from the Fortaleza de 

Minas deposit show similar values from other komatiite hosted type 1 deposits. Although the 



The Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: An Example of Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Deposit in Highly Fractionated Ponded Flows 72 

above mentioned authors argued against thermomechanical erosion, we agree with Lesher &amp;amp; 

Keays, (2002) that the best interpretation of the S and S/Se variations in Type 1 deposits is in 

favour of assimilation of crustal metasedimentary rocks. S/Se ratios (4810-17540) from the 

Fortaleza de Minas ores are higher than the mantle value and, like other Type 1 ores, are 

consistent with the interpretation that most of the S in the ores has been derived from 

assimilation of sulfidic sediments (Lesher &amp;amp; Keays, 2002). The high Os initial ratio and ?Os 

values in the Fortaleza de Minas ores is interpreted herein as related to crustal assimilation 

and not to metamorphic and remobilization processes as suggested by Correia et al., (2001). 

Lesher and Keays, (2002) pointed out that the observed Os isotopic compositions can be 

attributed to variations in the R factor, resulting from mixing of highly radiogenic crustally-

derived Os with less radiogenic mantled-derived Os.

Hill et all, (1995) proposed a classification of komatiite flow faciology based on the degree of 

internal differentiation, proportion of cumulate material and characteristic thickness of  flow 

units. The “Thick fractionated flow units” are up to 150 m thick and several km wide and are 

characterized by in situ differentiation of ponded komatiite lava containing pyroxenitic and 

gabbroic cumulates in lava lakes. Commonly the lower part of these units are occupied by 

homogeneous olivine orthocumulates and meso cumulates assumed to be formed during an 

early flow-trough stage in a lava channel, which subsequently became dammed up.  A typical  

example of this type of flow being Fred`s flow at Munro Township (Arndt et al., 1973). The 

Fortaleza de Minas highly fractionated flow units has similar thickness and widths (fig. 6) and 

also similar fractionation products – olivine-orthocumulate, pyroxene-cumulate and gabbro - 

and is considered to be formed in a ponded lava lake facies environment similar to Munro 

Fred’s flow (fig. 10).  Figure 12 shows a schematic cross-sections illustrating the volcanic 

structures and lithologies of type 1 (Fig. 12a) and type 2 (Fig. 12b) deposits, after Hill, (2001), 

and the schematic diagram proposed for the Fortaleza de Minas ponded type 1 mineralization 

(Fig. 12c).

Interflow sediments faciology 

 

The Guariroba-Peroba greenstone segment has a distinct zonation of chemical sediments. 

In the NE margin of the Peroba area a thick pile of chemical sediments with minor 

contribution of detritic sediments is interpreted to represent the upper sequence of this 

greenstone segment, which is estimated to be 200m thick. They are typically banded 

cherts and hematite bearing banded iron formation with thin komatiitic inter-sediment 

flows. In the central portion of the Guariroba-Peroba segment the komatiites and 

komatiitic basalt flows are often separated by thin cherty black shale horizons, banded 

cherty graphitic meta-tuffs and sulfide facies banded iron formations. Laterally they 

gradually merge to oxide facies magnetite bearing BIFs. Pyrrhotite is the dominant sulfide 

followed by chalcopyrite, sphalerite and arsenopyrite. The same carbonaceous banded iron 

formation and tuffs also occur in the SW portion of the segment as interflow sediments in 

the upper and lower sequences from Brenner et al, (1990). The Fortaleza de Minas 

fractionated flow (formerly intermediate sequence) has distinctive oxide and silicate facies 

BIF horizons within the individual fractionated flow units. The lower flow units are 

separated by thin (0.5 to 5m) horizons of oxide facies with a tremolitic/ actinolitic 

groundmass finelly or coarsely banded with magnetite layers where free silica is absent or 

rare (Figs. 3h and 5). The interflow sediment horizon that separates the ore bearing upper 

flow unit to the lower ones is abnormally thick (up to 50m) and starts with a silica rich 

oxide facies BIF (with fine magnetite bands) evolving to a silicate facies with banded 

cummingtonite, actinolite and silica displaying banded disseminated sulfides towards the 

top. The width of this horizon becomes very narrow and eventually discontinues in the 

central part of both openpit and underground mines along a steep plunge and has been 

interpreted as due to thermal erosion processes along a lava flow channel (Fig. 12c). In the 

SW limb of the Fortaleza de Minas Syncline some of the lower BIF horizons show 

gradational contacts to graphitic banded iron formations and cherty-tuffs indicating a 

change to deeper water environment. The facies distribution suggests a shallow water 

environment for the fractionated flow changing laterally to deeper water environment.

Embayment and Trough structures 

 

Similarly to other komatiite volcanic Type 1 Nickel deposits (Lesher and Keays, 2002; Hill, 

2001; Beresford, 2005) the Fortaleza de Minas deposit is also related to trough or embayment 

structures. Evidences for such structures are: 

 

- The presence of high MgO ortho-cummulates (B zone) and the absence of spinifex 

zones (A). (Not applicable for the Fortaleza de Minas highly fractionated flow). 

- Presence of cumulate and massive textures in highly fractionated flows. 

- Lateral changes to thinner sequences with spinifex textures. 

- Evidences of thermal erosion (lack of footwall BIF). 

- Presence of massive, matrix and disseminated ores in these troughs. (Massive ore has 

been recristalized and remobilized as breccia ore prograding the trough limits at 

Fortaleza de Minas).  

 

Although the deposit has been affected by intense folding and shearing indications of trough 

structures can still be recognized. Figures 13 and 14 show trough structures with primary 

disseminated and matrix ores associated with thinning of the footwall BIF interpreted as 

caused by thermal erosion. The intense shear associated with the sinistral transcurrent faults 

that affected the deposit and the greenstone belt segment as a whole promoted a strong 

flattening of the rocks in the mine area where the flattening effect seems to have been much 

more intense than the horizontal displacement along the ore contact fault (Rosas, 2003; 

Brenner et al, 2006 – in press). Figure 15 shows the 900m sublevel where up to five 

individual flow units can be outlined. The deposit is hosted by the upper V flow unit. Despite 

the strong shearing, the trough zone is clearly defined by the presence of disseminated and 

matrix ore types and the sudden pinch of the footwall BIF. Figure 16a show the 990m bench 

from the open pit mine and a simplified reconstruction of the overall shape of the embayment 

structure in the central portion of the deposit prior to deformation by shortening the 990m 

bench plan view by 7 times (Fig. 16b). The trough is indicated by both the thinning and lack 

of the footwall BIF and the presence of disseminated and matrix ores.

and separated by thin but continuous horizons of Banded Iron Formation with clear facies change from 
oxide (BFo) to silicate (BFs) and graphitic sulfide facies (BFg) indicating change from shallow to 
deep water environment to the top. Each flow has a distinctive olivine-cumulate basal zone (now 
represented by serpentinite – SS and talc schist – TT), followed by an intermediate pyroxene-cumulate 
(PI) and an upper gabbro zone (AT). Concentrated shearing in the footwall side of the ore zone has 
promoted pinching and stretching of the olivine-cumulates in the footwall flows followed by 
incomplete talcification of serpentinites leaving remaining nuclei in the thicker zones.

be also caused by large scale pinch and swell along the major shear zone. 
 
 
A vertical longitudinal section including both open pit and underground mine also reveals 

clearly the trough structure where two interpreted separate troughs open apart at depth (Fig. 

17). The troughs are revealed by the outlines of both disseminated and matrix ores and also, 

indirectly, by the lack of remobilized ore in the footwall BIF as a consequence of thermal 

erosion of the banded iron formation. The trough structures also coincide with higher ore 

widths and higher average Ni grades. Major displacements are tentatively interpreted as 

resulting from primary faults that could have controlled the trough structures and 

consequently the ore distribution. It is difficult to confirm that these structures were not 

settled much later during folding and shearing, however, minor faults and shears observed at 

underground exposures do not seem to relate to these major structures.

Geochemical signature as a genetic indicator 

 

A strong effort has been focused in finding geochemical indicators to determinate between 

mineralized komatiites sequences from barren sequences. Barnes &amp;amp; Brand (1999) looked at 

komatiites Ni and Cr data from a compreensive literature review.  Although roughly 75 

percent of the data fall in a low Cr low Ni cluster of less than 4.000 ppm, -the “olivine-

liquid field”-, they observed that barren and mineralized komatiite sequences show 

contrasting trends on plots of Cr versus Ni (Fig. 18). A high Ni low Cr ‘mineralized field` 

composed of sulfide bearing samples, with low Cr values, is strongly associated with lava 

pathways. Channelized and related thin flows are systematically depleted in cromite as 

channelized flow environments are dominated by more primitive magmas usually not 

saturated in cromite. Ponded flow facies rocks from lava lakes tipically contain cumulus 

chromite resulting from crystal segregation during fractionation in evolved liquids saturated 



The Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: An Example of Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Deposit in Highly Fractionated Ponded Flows 81 

in chromite. A high Cr low Ni ‘barren field` is largely made up of samples from highly 

fractionated lava lakes. The strong association of the barren and mineralized fields to 

volcanic facies indicated that ponded sheet flow and lava lake sequences would be of 

low potential for economic Ni deposits in contrast with the more prospective sequences 

from channelized flow facies (Hill, 2001, Barnes &amp;amp; Brand, 1999). 

 

 

The Fortaleza de Minas mineralized flow has a typical high Cr ‘lava lake` signature. 

Even the higher Ni samples, towards the disseminated ore type, have high Cr values 

(Fig. 18b). The Guariroba – Peroba komatiite barren sheet flow samples fall mostly in 

the low Cr low Ni ‘olivine-liquid field` cluster. The Fortaleza de Minas deposit as a 

ponded flow facies does not support the low potential of lava lake sequences as an 

exploratory geochemical tool. In the same way, the Cr versus MgO plot reveals that the 

Fortaleza de Minas flow has a high Cr/MgO signature (Fig. 18c), in contrast with many 

komatiite hosted Ni deposits from Western Australia where a low Cr high MgO 

mineralized trend associated with channelized high MgO cumulates has been reffered to 

as the “Kambalda trend”. 

 

 

Progressive fractioning of olivine from barren komatiite lava depletes the lava in Ni 

resulting in a linear positive correlation of Ni with MgO. In dynamic extrusive systems 

the overall level of Ni depletion is usually low and high levels of Ni depletion in host 

lavas are a positive sign for exploration, although little or no Ni depletion may not be a 

negative sign (Hill, 2001). Figure 18d shows that no signifficant Ni depletion is 

observed in the Fortaleza de Minas ore host flow, and there is no discriminating Ni 

versus MgO signature for the mineralized flow when compared with the barren sheet 

flows from the Guariroba – Peroba area.

Discussion 

 

The thick fractionated ore host flow shows remarkable differences to the typical komatiite 

related type 1 and type 2 deposits described in Western Australia and seems to have been 

formed in a large pond or lava lake oscilating from shallow to deep water environment 

probably at the distal portions of a lava channel (Fig. 10). Most deposits display a thick ortho-

cumulate or adcumulate channelized flows with lateral thinning and development of olivine or 

pyroxene spinifex top zones. Most of these channelized flows are poorly fractioned. Well 

preserved lava channels associated to both type 1 and type 2 deposits have been recently 

described in the Black Swan area, Western Australia (Hill et al, 2004; Barnes et al, 2004; 

Dowling et al, 2004), and has also been identified in many komatiite hosted deposits 

(Kawahikawa et al, 1998; Barnes et al, 1998; Dowling et al, 2002; Lesher &amp;amp; Keays, 2002; 



The Fortaleza de Minas Deposit: An Example of Komatiite-Hosted Ni-Cu-(PGE) Deposit in Highly Fractionated Ponded Flows 83 

Beresford, 2005; Stone, 2005). Although the ore formation is essencially related with very 

similar ore types, the Fortaleza de Minas flow shows a significantly different environment 

of ore formation.  

 

 

Similar highly fractionated flows are also found in Munro, Township where two thick 

fractionated flows occur in the same area, one komatiitic (Fred’s Flow) and the other 

tholeitic (Theo’s Flow) (Arndt, 1977; Arndt et al., 1977). They both display equivalent 

fractioned products ranging from olivine-cumulates to pyroxene-cumulates and gabbro. 

The major differences between them are shown in figures 19 a-b. Same chemical profiles 

were provided for the Fortaleza de Minas fractioned flow from selected drill holes (Fig. 

19c). Although the amount of pyroxene-cumulate is close to the tholeitic flow, the MgO 

fractionation trend is even closer to the komatiitic Fred’s Flow. The MgO profile from 

Fortaleza de Minas shows a fractionation trend similar to the komatiitic flow for the 

olivine-cumulate. Due to metamorphism and strong shearing most of the original textures 

and magmatic mineralogy has been obliterated. The fine-grained zone at the top of the 

gabbro unit is tentatively correlated to the flow top units. The possible metamorphic 

equivalent of flow tops observed in cores is more likely to be derived from aphanitic 

pyroxenite than to spinifex. Interpreted flow tops are quite thin and were not sampled. The 

drop in MgO trend at the border zone (base of flow) is similar to the komatiitic Fred’s 

flow. Fractionated trends from the deposit lower flow units are analogous to those of the 

uppermost mineralized flow unit. The different flow units are always separated by thin to 

thick horizons of chemical sediments (BIF) and also show equivalent differentiation trend 

in the western limb of the syncline. They are considered all together as part of a thick 

highly fractionated flow.

tholeitic profile display a much thicker pyroxene cumulate zone than the komatiitic profile. The thick 
pyroxene cumulate zone at Fortaleza de Minas display similarities with the tholeitic flow. The 
proportion of olivine cumulate at Fortaleza is somewhere in between the two types of flow at Munro.

Figure 20 shows the whole rock composition of Fred’s and Theo’s flows from Munro and 

their distinctive fractionation trends, and the Fortaleza de Minas fractionated flow for 

comparison. The skew to the CaO side in the pyroxene-cumulate zone from the 

fractionated flow is also observed in other komatiitic known areas like Barbeton (Viljoen 

and Viljoen, 1982).

Figure 21 plots TiO2 versus MgO data for the fractionated flow with comparison to Munro 

komatiites and picrites from different volcanic environments. The highly fractionated flow 

had generated a large variation of rock types exhibiting a wider span of MgO content. 

According to the original Jensen classification (Fig. 9) part of the gabbro zone would fall into 

the tholeitic field, however this limit was later reviewed by Viljoen and Viljoen, 1982. The 

TiO2 content indicates a good fit to the komatiitic field from Munro Township.

In Type 1 deposits the massive/ matrix ore hanging wall rock is typically an olivine-cumulate 

that occupied the lava pathway after the settling of the Ni sulfide orebody, being also 

chemically distinctive (Hill, 2001; Lesher and Keays, 2002). But at Fortaleza de Minas, in a 

lava lake environment, indications are that the deposit host is intimately related to the Ni 

mineralisation and there is a continuous transition of both Ni grades and sulfide content from 

the barren host to disseminated ore and from this to matrix ore. The ponded environment 

suported the high degree of fractionation and the settling of disseminated, matrix and massive 

ores along an open trough, possibly at the end of a lava channel in a shallow lava lake. The 

high Cr and the lack of Ni depletion pointed out by Oostindier et al., (1990) and the 

stratigraphic argument against crustal assimilation (Choudhuri et al., 1997) should be 

reviewed considering the distal ponded environment for this deposit, where many evidences 

points towards crustal assimilation related to thermo-mechanical erosion. 

Conclusions 

 

The Fortaleza de Minas deposit can be described as a Ni – Fe sulfide mineralization of Type 1 

associated with komatiite flows (Lesher and Keays, 2002). The mineralization occur at an 

inner top zone of a thick highly fractionated flow, which has a very distinctive fractionation 

pattern and is distinctive from most of the typical Type 1 deposit hosts. Instead of being

de Minas deposit is associated with an olivine-cumulate, pyroxene-cumulate and gabbro. The 

high fractionation pattern observed troughout the thick flow suggests a lava pond or lava lake 

environment. The original composition of the magma is inferred to be positioned at the lower 

limit of typical komatiites, and can be classified as a pyroxenitic komatiite or a transitional 

type, encompassing komatiitic and basaltic komatiite composition. The pyroxenitic 

composition (tremolite – chlorite) of the fine grained flow top reinforces that conclusion. 

 

Komatiite hosted deposits are not common in ponded flow facies or lava lakes and this has 

been reinforced in the literature by the ‘barren` Cr versus Ni signature of lava lake 

environment. The Fortaleza de Minas deposit has a distinctive high Cr prospective chemical 

signature and also a distinctive ponded facies volcanic environment with aplication in the 

construction of a new exploratory model for this type of deposit (high Cr and lack of Ni 

depletion in highly fractionated flows, associated with open embayments). In this sense lava 

lakes can not be excluded as a favourable environment for Ni deposits and must be 

reassesed worldwide.

APPENDIX 1 - Estimation of bulk MgO composition of the fractionated flow 

 

The Fortaleza de Minas fractionated flow has been intensely sheared and metamorphosed and 

therefore the olivine cumulates have been completely transformed into serpentinites and talc 

carbonate rocks. No original olivine and cromite has ever been detected so far in both open pit 

and underground mine samples or cores. The estimation of the original bulk composition must 

then be inferred from the proportions and average MgO contents of each fractionated zone of 

the flow. From the borehole database a total of 182 individual flow intersections were 

investigated. The true width of each flow was calculated along with true widths for the 

gabbro, pyroxene-cumulate and olivine-cumulate zones. The individual flows were classified 

into lower, intermediate and upper flow units for the SW and NE limbs of the Fortaleza de 

Minas Syncline. The NE limb being the mine limb and the upper flow unit the mineralized

flow unit. The proportion of each fractionated unit was then calculated for each flow with the 

caution to minimize the effect of shearing which can be responsible for pinching out and 

thinning of individual units. This is particularly true for the base of the upper flow and the top 

of the intermediate flow in the mine NE limb. To estimate the correct proportions of primary 

fractionated units we should look for the less deformed zones of the flows, that is where the 

flows should have the fully preserved fractioned sequence. For that purpose it was considered 

a minimum width of 5m for each unit for average width calculation. The results are tabulated 

in table 5 for the major flow units for both SW and NE limbs of the Fortaleza de Minas 

Syncline. The average bulk MgO content was calculated weighting the proportion of each unit 

by its average MgO content. The data suggests that the original komatiitic magma of the 

Fortaleza de Minas flow should have a bulk MgO content between 18 and 23 wt% MgO. 

Table 5 indicates that the lower flows in the two limbs display the higher MgO content (22 

wt%), followed by the intermediate flows (20 to 23 wt% MgO). The mineralized flow show 

lower MgO content (18 to 19 wt%) than the previous flow units. One interpretation for this 

gradual change in composition could be related to magma contamination by assimilation of 

lower MgO units. The intense deformation and shearing observed in the area severely 

impacted on the original distribution of the fractionated units. Although this effect was 

tentatively minimized by filtering the data set it is not guaranteed that this proportion is fully 

reliable. However the upward MgO decreasing trend in both limbs are consistent and may 

well reflect magmatic contamination.
