The incompatible behaviour of gold in reduced magmas:
a working hypothesis

D. R. N. ROSA*/**

Key-words: Gold; oxygen fugacity; reduced/oxidized; magnetite/ilmenite series.

Abstract: Gold seems to show contrasting behaviours during magmatic evolution according to the f0 2 of the melts. In more oxidized
conditions, characterized by the presence of magnetite as the main Fe-Ti oxide, gold content in plutonic rocks decreases with increasing differentiation. On
the other hand, in more reduced conditions, characterized by the predominance of ilmenite, gold content in plutonic rocks increases with increasing

differentiation.
The mineral structures of the intervening minerals (magnetite and ilmenite) are compared with the possible different gold ions (aurous, Aut;

and auric, Au 3+). It is hypothesized that under more oxidizing conditions auric gold is present, which is easily incorporated in the crystallizing
magnetite due to its similar size to ferrous and, to a lesser degree, ferric iron; magnetite effectively acting as a sink for the gold and causing its early
removal from the melt. Under more reducing conditions, aurous gold is the only gold cation present and its larger size prevents it from being incor-
porated into the ilmenite (and possibly magnetite). Therefore gold behaves as an incompatible element and tends to concentrate into the late fluids,

possibly leading to gold mineralization related to highly evolved fluids.

INTRODUCTION

In order to help understand granite magmatism and
metallogeny, ISHIHARA (1977; 1981) developed the
magnetite-series and ilmenite-series classification scheme,
based on the f0 2 of the melts and summarized in Table 1.
According to this scheme the magnetite-series granitoids
would have been derived from more oxidized magmas
and are recognizable by the presence of significant
amounts (&gt;0.1 vol. %) of magnetite (Fe2+Fe3+204)' The
ilmenite-series granitoids, on the other hand, would have
been derived from more reduced magmas and have much
less opaque minerals «0.1 vol. %), ilmenite (Fe2+Ti4+0 3)

Work by McCoy et at. (1997) on North American
plutons, has shown that the association of plutonic related
gold mineralization with ilmenite-series plutons is due to
the incompatible behavior of gold in ilmenite-series
magmas. These authors have compared the gold content

, along the differentiation trend for gold favorable plutons
(where gold mineralization is known to be present) and
for gold devoid plutons (where gold mineralization is
absent). The contrasting trends are shown in Fig . 2. Gold
correlates positively with silica in ilmenite-series plutons
and correlates negatively with silica in magnetite-series
plutons .

being the dominant one. The primary ratio Fe203IFeO
can be used as a parameter to distinguish the two series,
if it is higher than 0.5 a rock can be classified as belonging
to the magnetite series while if it is lower than 0.5 it can
be classified as belonging to the ilmeni te-series. Due to
the different opaque mineralogy, plutons can also be
classified based on their magnetic susceptibility.

According to ISHIHARA (1981) these two distinct
granitoid series have substantially different origins and
modes of emplacement and thereby their distribution in
time and space is quite distinct. Magnetite-series
plutons are generally originated at greater depths than
ilmenite-series plutons. Additionally, magnetite-series
plutons broadly correlate with I-type granites (igneous
source rock) while ilmenite-series plutons broadly
correlate with S-type granites (sedimentary source rock) .
Their distinct oxygen fugacity is related to the dissocia-
tion of water that acts as an oxidizing agent for magnetite
series magmas or to the incorporation of crustal carbon
that acts as a reducing agent for the ilmenite-series
magmas. To prove the occurrence of carbon incorporation,
ISHIHARA &amp;amp; TERASHIMA (1989) have analyzed granitoids
for non-carbonate carbon, hereby showing that carbon
content is appreciably higher in the ilmenite-series than
in the magnetite-series granitoids .

From the metallogenetic point of view, ISHIHARA et
at. (1985) have shown that f0 2 significantly affects the
gold con tent of granitoid rocks. In their study, based
on granitoid plutons from Japan, they concluded that
the average gold content of the magnetite-series rocks
(4.3ppm) is almost double that of rocks of the ilme-
nite -series (2.5ppm). This may be interpreted as being
the result of compatible behavior of gold in magnetite-
series magmas, in contrast to a possible incompatible
behavior of gold in ilmenite-series magmas.

As an obvious result of this interpretation, several
authors have noticed the tendency of plutonic-related
gold mineralization to be related to more reduced
magmatic plutons, belonging to the ilmenite-series.
LEVEILLE et at. (1988) and later McCoY et at. (1997)
have shown this empirical relationship by plotting
composition data for both gold associated and gold devoid
plutons from Alaska, Idaho and Montana (Fig. 1).



The incompatible behaviour of gold in reduced magmas: a working hypothesis 77

The enrichment in gold along differentiation trend for
the studied ilmenite-series plutons is in contrast with what
was generally thought to happen during magmatic evolu-
tion (TILLING et al, 1973). However, KOROBEYNIKOV
(1980) has already referred the tendency for gold accumu-
lation in accessory minerals of late differentiates of some
plutons, suggesting that it could behave incompatibly and
concentrate in residual melts and fluids.

WORKING HYPOTHESIS

Although the gold content from the magma source
rock might significantly affect the gold content of the
magma and ultimately control the presence of mineraliza -
tion, it is obvious that the magma evolution process will
play an even more important role. In this paper, only the
magma evolution process is addressed and it is assumed
that some gold is present in the magma since the begin-
ning, which does not necessarily have to be always exact.

It is assumed that the evolution of the magmas related
to the intrusion-related Au deposits described is essen-
tially controlled by fractional crystallization. In this case,
the empirical observations described above are certainly
due to the fact that reduced magma (ilmenite-series)
inhibits the incorporation of gold into crystallizing
phases and resulting plutonic rocks. This will promote
gold concentration in the latter stages of differentiation
and ultimately allowing the highly evolved fluids to act
as mineralizing hydrothermal fluids.

The reason for this contrasting behaviour must be
associated with the structure of the minerals that form in
the two different magma series, their available cation
sites and/or with the dominant gold species present under
different f02 conditions. The radii of the cations
involved are shown in Table 2.

TABLE 2

Cation radii

Cation: Fe2+(ferrous) Fe 3+(ferric) Au+(aurous) Au 3+(auric)

Radii (A) : 0.92 0.785
1.46-1.49 0.910

DATA FROM SHANNON &amp;amp; PREWITT (1969)

From the analysis of the cation radii, the factor that
most affects their distribution into mineral phases, it is
apparent that Au3+ is very similar to Fe2+ and therefore
might substitute for it. Applying Paulings' 1st rule:

Au
3
+ Rcation/Ranion = 0.910/1.26=0.722 } 6 " Id d"

-10 coor matron
Fe2+ RcationlRanion = 0.92/1.26=0.730

Au" RcationlRanion = 1.46/1.26=1.159 12-fold coordination

It is evident, from the above, that Au3+ can substitute
for Fe2+ in 6-fold coordination positions of the magnetite
and ilmenite structures, which is not possible in the case of
Au" because no 12-fold coordination positions are avai-
lable in these minerals.

It might therefore be concluded that it is not the
crystallizing oxide mineral that controls the incompatible
behaviour of gold, but rather the gold species present.

Although never dominant under typical magmatic
conditions, minor amounts of Au3+ might be present
under relatively oxidizing conditions, characteristic of
magnetite-series magmas (ROMBERGER, pers. comm.)
Therefore, it is proposed that in magnetite-series
magmas , this available Au3+ will readily fit into the Fe 2+
site of magnetite, or eventually into the Fe3+ site if a
coupled substitution is to be avoided. It is for this reason

.that magnet ite of granitoid rocks has been reported to
contain up to I ppm Au (LEVEILLE et al, 1988) .
Supporting this, work by MIRONOV &amp;amp; ZHMODIK (1980)
using gold radioisotopes established that gold enters the
lattice of magnetite, as well as the lattice of some
sulfides . Furthermore, as Au3+ gets incorporated into the
crystallizing magnetite it promotes the oxidation of Au"
to Au3+ so that, if this happens for a long enough period
of time, all the gold will end up in magnetite. This model
assumes that species equilibration is more rapid than
mineral growth and diffusion . In this way, gold will not
be available to concentrate in residual fluids that could
lead to mineralization.

On the other hand, under more reduced conditions
(characteristic of ilmenite-series magmas), the only gold
ion present will be Au+, with its large size preventing its
incorporation into any of the oxide minerals or possibly
sulfides. The preference of gold for establishing covalent
bondings will also prevent it from being incorporated
into ionic cation sites, even if their size is adequate, as
would be the case for replacing K+ in biotite or K-
-feldspar. This will promote the concentration of gold
into highly evolved magmatic fluids, ultimately leading
to mineralization.

As proposed, gold speciation is intimately related
to the oxidation state of the magma, whereby f0 2
effectively controls the behaviour of gold. NECRASOV
(1996) compared the speciation of gold with the activity



78

ratios of Fe3+ and Fe2+. Thi s author refers to a work by
LETNlKOV &amp;amp; VILOR (1981) that demon strated that the
increm ent of the activity of Fe2+ (reduction) tend s to
stabilize Au" while the increment in the activity of Fe3+
(oxidation) will promot e the stabilization of Au3+.

COMPARISON WITH OXIDATION STATE
RELATIONSHIPS IN BASIC MAGMAS
(C ARMICHAE L &amp;amp; GHIORSO, 1986)

As CARMICHAEL &amp;amp; GHIORSO (1986) have not iced ,
melts tend to evol ve alo ng paths with constant
Fe203 /FeO as fractionati on proceed s. Since Fe2+, rathe r
than Fe3+, tends to be used up earl y (in olivine and
pyroxenes) one would expect that the melt' s oxidation
state would increase. The authors' explanation for this
considers that the iron redox system is coupled with the
sulfur redox system that will act as a self-regulating inter-
nal oxygen reservoir, thereby constraining the evolving
melt to a constant Fe20 3IFeO by means of the reaction:

Gold may be involved in a similar coupling of redox
systems allowing the gold in the melt to oxidize as auric
gold is being incorporated into crystallizing phases.

REMARKS

As a concluding remark it should be referred that
HEDENQUIST &amp;amp; LOWENSTERN (1994) consider that
pyrrhotite constitutes a common pheno cryst host for gold
in granites . Thi s is supported by the radioisotope work by
MIRONOV &amp;amp; ZHMODIK (1980), described earlier.

Therefore, it should be pointed out that for gold to
behave as an incompatible element, besides the relatively
reduced nature of the magma, it might be important that its
sulfur content is low enough so that no sulfides crystallize,
since sulfides (namely pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite) act as
sinks for gold, even more effectively than magnetite .

CONCLUSIONS AND EXPLORATION
IMPLICATIONS

The empiri cal data presented indicates that gold
behaves incompatibly only if magma s are sufficiently

D. ROSA

reduced (ilmenite-series magmas). This is caused by the
large size of the only gold cation present under these
conditi ons (Au" ) that prevents it from being incorporated
into the crystallizing oxides and, poss ibly, sulfides.

Thi s has major implication s in the explorati on of
plutonic- related gold deposits since the metallo genetic
model for this type of deposits implies that gold has to
behave incompatibl y, thereby exclud ing magnetit e-series
plutons as adequate targets. Explorat ion efforts should
therefore be focused on ilmenite-series pluton s.
