Resumo 

 

 O lixo marinho é uma das ameaças mais preocupantes à conservação dos Oceanos 

embora os estudos sobre este problema só tenham começado há relativamente pouco 

tempo. Na década de 30 foram avistados os primeiros animais emaranhados e, na década 

de 60, começaram a ser reportados animais mortos pela ingestão de plástico. Atualmente, 

este problema afeta todos os oceanos em todas as profundidades e uma quantidade 

significativa de lixo continua a ser produzida diariamente. Esta ameaça, resultado de anos 

de um deficiente tratamento de resíduos e da ignorância face ao destino dos materiais 

depositados no mar de forma descontrolada, tem-se tornado mais conspícua. Isto deve-se 

à acumulação de resíduos sólidos nas zonas costeiras, provenientes tanto de terra como 

de mar. Assim, o aspeto estético do lixo acumulado nestas zonas, juntamente com o 

aumento de avistamentos de animais emaranhados atraiu, nos últimos anos, a atenção da 

população e da comunidade científica. O problema do lixo marinho intensificou-se devido 

à evolução da composição dos materiais descartados. Antigamente, apesar dos materiais 

serem descartados de forma imprópria, estes eram biodegradáveis, o que provocava 

impactos reduzidos para o ecossistema. Com a intensificação do uso do plástico como 

material de baixa densidade, duradouro, resistente, relativamente barato e extremamente 

versátil, o ato de descartar incorretamente estes resíduos passou a ter graves 

consequências. A lenta degradabilidade do plástico, o facto de a maioria ser constituído 

por poluentes orgânicos persistentes (POP) e de apresentar uma elevada toxicidade, são 

algumas das características que tornam o material mais usado atualmente, uma grave 

ameaça ao meio ambiente. Apesar da relevância dada ao plástico, o lixo marinho, de 

origem antropogénica inclui muitos outros materiais, também prejudiciais ao meio 

ambiente, como o vidro, papel, resíduos sanitários, resíduos médicos, metal, vestuário, 

olaria e outro tipo de poluentes. Esta problemática tem-se revelado de tal forma 

importante que a sua monitorização é essencial para avaliar a quantidade, o tipo, a 

distribuição e a origem do lixo marinho. É neste sentido que o lixo marinho foi designado 

como um dos descritores da Diretiva Quadro Estratégia Marinha (DQEM), diretiva esta 

que tem como principal objetivo alcançar ou manter o Bom Estado Ambiental das águas 

marinhas e costeiras até 2020. O descritor 10 da DQEM, que indica que as propriedades 

e a quantidade do lixo marinho não prejudicam o meio costeiro e marinho, necessita de 

uma boa caracterização do mesmo. Para tal, a diretiva estabelece dois grandes 

indicadores: as características do lixo marinho no meio costeiro e marinho e os impactos 



iv 

 

do lixo na vida marinha, sendo a monitorização um dos principais componentes deste 

primeiro indicador. Atualmente, as amostragens realizadas na praia são o tipo de 

monitorização mais comum da zona costeira, uma vez que estas não só permitem a 

recolha de uma grande quantidade de informação, como podem ser realizadas sob 

praticamente quaisquer condições atmosféricas, apresentando custos reduzidos. Existem 

vários fatores que influenciam a ocorrência do lixo marinho nas praias, sendo que as 

principais são: as características do lixo; a dinâmica das praias; as condições atmosféricas; 

os padrões de circulação oceânica, a limpeza das praias e as práticas recreativas e 

comerciais realizadas em águas oceânicas. Neste âmbito foi realizado um estudo para 

relacionar a presença do lixo marinho com as características da costa, de modo a perceber 

como esta relação pode influenciar possíveis programas de monitorização, enquadrando 

a necessidade de monitorizar o lixo marinho no âmbito da DQEM. Esta dissertação de 

mestrado teve também como objetivo relacionar os diversos tipos de lixo marinho 

encontrados com as suas fontes, encontrando indicadores que auxiliassem essa 

identificação. Foram assim amostradas onze praias em Portugal, entre o outono de 2014 

e a primavera de 2015. A quantidade e o tipo de lixo foram amostrados adaptando o design 

da Convenção para a Proteção do Meio Marinho do Atlântico Nordeste (OSPAR). Foram 

atribuídas determinadas características às praias como a extensão da praia; o tipo de 

substrato (classificado de acordo com a sua granulometria) e a existência de urbanização 

(se as praias eram ou não urbanizadas). O declive e a distância ao estuário foram 

caracterizadas por comparação entre as diferentes praias. Estas características foram 

posteriormente relacionadas com a quantidade do lixo através de uma PERMANOVA. 

As diferenças significativas obtidas na análise anterior foram exploradas utilizando o teste 

SIMPER. Para visualizar estas relações foi realizada uma Análise de Coordenadas 

Principais (PCO). Para identificar as possíveis fontes do lixo encontrado, foram 

estabelecidos indicadores baseados nos três principais tipos de lixo encontrados para cada 

praia e para cada estação do ano. A principal categoria de lixo encontrado nas praias foi 

o plástico (plástico &amp;lt;2.5cm e os pellets), sendo seguido pelo papel (beatas) e pelos 

resíduos sanitários (cotonetes). A quantidade de lixo foi influenciada tanto pelas 

diferentes praias como pelas diferentes estações do ano. Todas as estações do ano 

apresentaram também diferenças significativas e as praias com uma maior média de 

dissimilaridade foram Sesimbra e Maçãs, Maçãs e São Lourenço e, por fim, Figueirinha 

e Maçãs. O plástico foi o principal tipo de lixo responsável por estas diferenças. A PCO 

não mostrou uma boa relação entre as diferentes características das praias e o lixo, 



v 

 

destacando, no entanto, a praia das Maçãs das restantes. As praias que foram classificadas 

como urbanas apresentaram maior quantidade de lixo, bem como as praias que se 

encontravam mais perto de estuários. No geral, verificou-se uma maior quantidade de lixo 

no outono e na linha da maré alta, e não na linha da vegetação como aconteceu noutros 

estudos desta temática. Embora não tenha sido possível identificar a maioria da origem 

do lixo, que foi, na generalidade, considerado como lixo de origem mista, as categorias 

de lixo que corresponderam ao conjunto de indicadores específicos, propostos pela 

OSPAR, foram os cotonetes (resíduos sanitários) e as linhas de pesca e caixas de 

pescadores (pescas, incluindo aquacultura). É ainda de salientar a elevada presença de 

beatas de cigarros, cuja origem foi atribuída, por experiência dos investigadores, à 

restauração e às pessoas que frequentaram as praias. Estes resultados demonstram que o 

lixo identificado como terrestre teve maioritariamente origem na restauração e nos 

frequentadores das praias e num potencial défice na gestão de tratamento de águas. No 

lixo identificado como de origem marinha, a maioria foi devida à atividade pesqueira e 

ao transporte de mercadorias por via marítima, devido à quantidade de pellets 

encontrados. Devido à elevada quantidade de lixo de reduzidas dimensões encontrada 

(como pedaços de plástico &amp;lt;2.5cm, pellets, beatas e cotonetes), pode-se deduzir que a 

limpeza da praia é, de certa forma, ineficaz para o lixo de reduzidas dimensões. É 

importante referir que também foram identificados vários tipos de embalagens 

alimentares e de bebidas, bem como copos de plástico e palhinhas. Estes items, embora 

não tenham correspondido à maior percentagem dentro da categoria de plástico, 

evidenciam a falta de sensibilização da população para o problema do lixo marinho. 

Considerando a enorme importância da monitorização do lixo marinho e da determinação 

da sua fonte é interessante realizar estudos futuros de modo a eliminar o problema na 

origem. Estes estudos poderão relacionar os diferentes transportes do lixo marinho, como 

o vento e as correntes, com a sua distribuição. Analisar em que medida as condições 

atmosféricas influenciam a quantidade de lixo na zona costeira é também um dos 

possíveis objetos de estudos futuros.

Abstract 

 

Marine litter has been recognized as a serious environmental problem and 

therefore, it has become an important field of study. With an estimated eight million items 

being discarded, every day, in oceans and seas, marine litter represents a threat to the 

marine environment. Monitoring marine debris became a relevant topic of research as 

marine litter is one of the descriptors of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. This 

study relates the different characteristics of the coast of Portugal (urbanization, slope, 

distance to estuary and length) with the type and abundance of marine litter found on 

eleven beaches. The surveys were conducted following a transect approach method, 

according to the OSPAR design. After identified, the litter was related to the coast 

characteristics through a PERMANOVA, a SIMPER and a PCO analysis. Specific 

indicators were established in order to determine the source of the litter. The main types 

of litter found were plastic, paper and sanitary waste. The majority of litter was classified 

as having mixed origin, despite some litter could be identified as having land and marine 

origin. The sources of marine litter identified were sanitary and sewage-related waste, as 

well as fisheries, including aquaculture. This study related the assessed litter with the 

characteristics of the coast and, when possible, attributed their sources.

Chapter 1: General Introduction 

 

Marine litter is defined as items that were made and used by people and that were 

deliberately discarded into the rivers, sea or on beaches; that were brought indirectly to 

the sea with sewage, rivers, winds or storm water; that were accidentally lost (including 

material lost at sea in bad weather conditions), or that were deliberately left by people on 

beaches and shores (UNEP 2009). This problem started to receive more attention in the 

60s and nowadays it is well visible in all oceans and in almost all depths (Ryan, 2015) 

being recognized as one of the most insidious ocean pollution issues (Sheavly, 2005). A 

significant amount of litter is produced every day and the trend is an increase in the overall 

production (Bergmann et al., 2015).  

Marine litter can have its origin in either land or ocean-based sources, although it 

is estimated that about 80% of the litter existing in the ocean comes from land (Sheavly 

et al., 2005). The litter originated on land can come from multiple sources and sites near 

the coast, normally associated with activities related to the sea, such as ports, marinas and 

docks. The litter that is transported by rivers, the one that comes from the waste water 

treatments and the one that comes from untreated sewage can also be considered as land 

origin. The litter that is brought by storms, winds and rain is also considered of land 

origin, since it is washed from coastal areas and can end in the marine environment. 

Ocean- based litter comes mainly from the various activities that occur in the sea, such as 

touristic related activities like personal watercraft and cruises, and transportation of goods 

and fishing (UNEP, 2009).  

Marine litter can be classified into several categories like plastic, wood, medical 

and sanitary waste, clothes, metal, glass and paper. Each type has its own properties and 

therefore they are usually found in different sites, wherein plastic is undoubtedly the most 

common type (Derraik, 2002; Santos et al., 2008). Due to its characteristics, such as light 

weight, durability, strength and buoyant properties (Andrady and Neal, 2009), plastic was 

considered by Madzena and Lasiak (1997) the most difficult type of debris to control, 

since it disperses far from origin. Plastics are usually found in all sites, from the bottom 

to the surface of the seas, as well as on beaches (Galgani et al., 2000; Moore et al., 2001; 

Reisser et al., 2013).  

Over the years the impacts caused by marine litter have been documented 

worldwide. Entanglement and ghost fishing can cause superficial injuries but it can also 



2 

 

lead to more serious problems as injuries that, although not causing death, damage the 

animals’ feeding and reproductive abilities. What started as superficial injuries can also 

develop to serious infections. These impacts can also decrease the ability to escape from 

predators and cause changes in the behavior of animals.  

(Lais, 1997; Trouwborst, 2011). Over the years, the entanglement problem has been 

documented in multiple studies and organisms, such as in marine mammals (Henderson, 

1985; Kraus, 1990); in marine birds (Day et al., 1985) and turtles (Balaz, 1985). The ghost 

fishing problem has also been reported in a few studies as Carr et al. (1985) showed for 

New England. The ingestion of debris, mainly of plastics, is also worrying since the 

animals can get a false sense of satiation (Secchi and Zarzur, 1999). This ingestion can 

also be responsible for the introduction of toxic chemicals into the marine food webs, 

such as Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP) that affect not only those who ingest them 

but also top predators (Trouwborst, 2011).  

Marine litter can also be a transport and dispersion vector of invasive species, 

which can jeopardize the endemic species of certain regions (Gregory 2009). The 

smothering of the ocean floor caused by the litter that sinks is also a less known but also 

important impact (Trouwborst, 2011), as well as the public safety that can be threatened 

by injuries caused on beaches or by leaching of poisonous chemicals (Cheshire et al., 

2009). It is also relevant to consider that the aesthetic impact caused by marine litter 

diminishes the well-being of the population and that can cause negative impacts in the 

tourism of the affected area (Cheshire et al., 2009).  

The rate at which litter enters the system and at which it is removed influences the 

litter accumulation (both in seas and beaches) (Cheshire et al., 2009). Besides that, the 

proximity to large cities, the occupation and use of the shore and the maritime and 

hydrodynamics activities can also influence the accumulation rates of debris (Galgani et 

al., 2015). Tidal cycles, ocean currents, winds and regional-scale topography are 

responsible for marine litter deposition and distribution (UNEP, 2009). Coastal regions 

are where litter accumulates the most, since they suffer an extreme pressure with the 

population growth and with the uncontrolled development that are related to estuaries 

activities (Kennish, 2002). Estuaries do not escape from marine litter, what is worrying 

considering their ecological importance (Blaber et al., 2000).  

Considering that when the litter that reaches the sea becomes part of the common 

ocean, Thor Heyerdahl (1971) stressed out the importance of the mistake of considering 

the existence of territorial waters when it comes to this problem, highlighting the 



3 

 

importance of international agreements to protect the common ocean for future 

generations (Morrison, 1999). It is important to consider this question since, from the 

moment that litter reaches the sea, it becomes an international problem. Therefore, the 

litter has no owner and no one can be legally responsible for it (McIlgorm et al., 2011).  

As a result, it is crucial to monitor this problem in order to identify the source and 

minimize or reduce the problem. Therefore, marine litter was considered one of the eleven 

descriptors used to define the Good Environmental Status until 2020, under the Marine 

Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). Acting as a binding directive, MSFD can be 

considered as a supplementary community legal framework that can be used by present 

and future community members to develop new conservation measures, or enhance 

existing ones (Markus et al., 2011). This directive is the pillar of the Integrated Maritime 

Policy (IMP) of the European Union (Markus et al., 2011) and obliges the member states 

to follow an action plan that includes the initial assessment of the environmental status 

and to establish a series of environmental goals and the associated indicators (Van 

Franeker et al., 2010; Galgani et al., 2014). The Descriptor 10 of the MSFD defined good 

environmental status as the situation when properties and quantities of marine litter do 

not cause harm to the coastal and marine environments. To support the characterization 

of this descriptor, four indicators were described: trends in amount of litter washed ashore 

and/or deposited on coastlines; trends in amount of litter in water column (including 

floating on the surface) or deposited on sea floor, trends in amount, distribution and, when 

possible, composition of micro-particles and, finally, trends in the amount and 

composition of litter ingested by marine mammals (Galgani et al., 2013).  

Despite the consensus in monitoring marine litter, to assess the status of debris 

found on beaches, the method to be applied can be variable (Araújo &amp;amp; Costa, 2007). 

Studies on marine litter have been conducted on beaches (e.g. Caulton &amp;amp; Mocogni, 1987; 

Ross et al., 1991; Moore et al., 2001), on the sea floor (e.g. Watters et al., 2010; Mordecai 

et al., 2011) and in open waters (Thiel et al., 2013). However, to monitor trends in the 

amount of litter washed ashore and/or deposited on the coastline (as described in one of 

the indicators of Descriptor 10), beach surveys are the approach used since it allows a 

larger sample size at minimal cost and it can be done in almost all weather conditions. 

Beach surveys are also cheaper since they require very little equipment (Rees &amp;amp; Pond, 

1995) and have an important role in raising awareness of the population to this problem, 

since they can use volunteer work. Besides, debris tends to accumulate on beaches and 

when there is non-floating debris, it can be stranded on the shore (Dixon &amp;amp; Dixon, 1981). 



4 

 

In this way it is possible to assess the quantity of types of litter that would be difficult to 

assess in any other way (Dixon &amp;amp; Dixon, 1981). Although having these numerous 

advantages, this type of survey has its flaws. Dixon and Dixon (1981) referred that beach 

surveys gives a distorted picture of the composition of marine litter, because each type of 

litter has its own characteristics, which means that some litter tends to accumulate on 

beaches whilst other types degrade more easily, never reaching the beaches. This can 

cause an underestimation of the surveyed litter.  

Many different beach methodologies have been used, ranging from different types 

of transects (e.g. Rosevelt et al., 2013; Frost &amp;amp; Cullen, 1997), to the identification of 

specific (e.g. Martins &amp;amp; Sobral, 2011; Wright et al., 2013) and/or all types of litter (e.g. 

Moore et al., 2001). This causes an incompatibility problem since the results with 

different methodologies can hardly be compared (OSPAR, 2010). Taking into 

consideration, programs have been created to try to unite countries regarding this matter 

and to try to create a single methodology that can effectively enable comparison of the 

results.  

OSPAR, the Convention for the Protection of the marine Environment of the 

North-East Atlantic, is a conventiom to which Portugal is a signatory country. Under this 

framework the signatory parts have the obligation to fight and prevent the pollution, as 

well as to protect the seas against the human activities. The convention released a 

guideline for monitoring litter that was tested in OSPAR Pilot Project 2000-2006 

(OSPAR, 2010). This was an important step to survey and monitor marine litter, guiding 

the North-East Atlantic countries in monitoring of marine litter of MSFD.  

Given the importance of monitoring marine litter, and the fact that the Portuguese 

coastline is vulnerable to the accumulation of plastic (Martins &amp;amp; Sobral, 2011) and 

possibly to other types of litter, it is important to analyze the influence of the different 

types and characteristics of the coastline in the abundance of marine litter. This is the 

fundamental objective of the present study, since the purpose was to analyze the main 

patterns of occurrence throughout the year, in coastal areas with different characteristics, 

aiming to provide recommendation for monitoring plans design.

Chapter 2: Relationships between marine litter and type of coastal 

area: implications for the design of monitoring plans 

 

2.1. Introduction 
 

In recent years, marine litter has become an extremely important issue that has 

promoted studies with the purpose of understanding the effects of marine debris in 

organisms and to assess the damages in the marine ecosystem, at a short and a medium 

term. This problem has been neglected for a long time as a result of the common practice 

of ocean dumping. In the past decades, this practice was not so harmful because the 

residues then were biodegradable (Sheavly &amp;amp; Register, 2007), contrary to today. It was 

the aesthetic aspect that initially brought the attention of the scientific community and 

general public (Gregory 2009).  

Marine debris has been defined as items that were made and used by people and 

that were deliberately discarded into the rivers, sea or on beaches; that were brought 

indirectly to the sea with sewage, rivers, winds or storm water, that were accidentally lost 

(including material lost at sea in bad weather) or that were deliberately left by people on 

beaches and shores (UNEP, 2009). It is estimated that 8 million items are being dumped, 

every day, in oceans and seas, accumulating 6.4 million tons per year 

(www.unep.org/regionalseas/marinelitter - accessed 28/09/2015, 22:07; www.ospar.org 

– accessed 28/09/2015, 22:23).  

Marine litter can originate from two major sources: the ocean-based sources and 

land-based sources. The ocean-based sources are all the activities that take place at sea, 

such as merchant shipping, ferries and cruise liners, including fishing and aquaculture. 

Litter from all the land-based sources come from coastal or inland areas, as well as from 

rivers or other water bodies (UNEP, 2009). However, whichever the source, marine litter 

can have various impacts on the environment. Serious impacts on wildlife have been 

reported, such as entanglement of many marine species, which is a serious mortality factor 

(Gregory, 1999; Galgani et al., 2010). The accidental ingestion of plastic that mimic prey 

causes serious injuries (in special the ingestion of microplastics) and the consequent entry 

and input on the food chain of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP) and other chemicals 

(Katsanevakis et al., 2007; Martins &amp;amp; Sobral, 2011). The dispersion and the spread of 

invasive alien species caused by floating debris and the accumulation of litter on the 

seabed are also of concern. This accumulation, sometimes in large quantities, changes the 

local biotope characteristics, affecting the benthic communities and consequently the 



6 

 

mobile communities that depend on them (Sheavly &amp;amp; Register, 2007; Martins &amp;amp; Sobral, 

2011). Besides all the impacts to the wildlife, marine litter is also a serious problem 

regarding the presence of medical and hygiene wastes that are not retained in the 

treatment system of wastewater, which represents a risk to public health (Sheavly &amp;amp; 

Register, 2007). Tourism is also very affected by this problem, which leads to economic 

losses, especially due to beach cleaning activities of the bathing areas (Corbin &amp;amp; Singh, 

1993; Galgani et al., 1995; Sheavly &amp;amp; Register, 2007). 

The type and abundance of marine litter found on the coastline depends on several 

factors, among which are the proximity to urban and industrial centres, the circulation 

patterns of the oceanic currents and the shipping routes (Sheavly &amp;amp; Register, 2007). The 

coastal waters are the most critical areas regarding this problem. According to Dixon &amp;amp; 

Dixon (1981), the composition of marine litter is also more variable closer to the shore, 

because coastal waters are normally shallower, directly affected by the river flows 

(Holdgate &amp;amp; McIntosh, 1986) and because they have the pressure from urban and 

industrial centres (Santos et al., 2005).  

Marine litter can be classified into several categories: plastic; wood; medical and 

sanitary waste; clothes; metal, glass and paper. The majority of studies shows that the 

major type of residues is plastic, that have many forms and sizes (Derraik, 2002). Due to 

their abundance (Rees &amp;amp; Pond, 1995) and non-degradable nature (Laist, 1987), plastics 

deserve a special attention, since these properties enhance the severity of its impacts. 

Considering the widespread distribution of litter (e.g. Carpenter &amp;amp; Smith Jr.., 1972; Dixon 

&amp;amp; Cooke, 1977) and the need to protect and conserve the marine environment, a series of 

conventions and initiatives at an international level was triggered. The Convention on the 

Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (London 

Convention), signed in 1972, was the first international convention for the protection of 

the marine environment from human activities. The aim of this convention was to 

promote the control of all sources of marine pollution and the prevention of pollution by 

dumping of wastes and other materials in the sea (www.imo.org,- accessed 11/08/2015, 

10h50). The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships 

(MARPOL), adopted in 1973, is the main international convention that covers marine 

pollution by ships. Its Annex V (Prevention of Pollution by Garbage from Ships) defines 

the different types of litter whose discharged is prohibit and specifies the distances to the 

coast and the methods used to dispose of residues. (www.imo.org – accessed 11/08/2015, 

17h10).

At the regional level, the Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment 

of the Baltic Sea Area (Helsinki Convention), was signed in 1974 and it is governed by 

the Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission (HELCOM). It has the purpose 

of protecting the marine environment from all types of pollution (www.helcom.fi - 

accessed 10/08/2015, 13h12). The Mediterranean Countries adopted, in 1976, the 

Convention for the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea against Pollution (Barcelona 

Convention). Among the various objectives, this convention aims to assess and control 

marine pollution (http://www.unepmap.org – accessed 10/08/2015, 14h00).  

A mechanism to approach marine litter problems was created, in 1992, through 

the establishment of a cooperation between fifteen Governments and the European Union 

to cooperate in the protection of the marine environment of the North-East Atlantic. It is 

the result of the union of the Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution by 

Dumping from Ships and Aircrafts (Oslo Convention, 1974) and the Convention for the 

Prevention of Marine Pollution from Land-Based Sources (Paris Convention, 1978) 

(Galgani et al. 2010; www.ospar.org – accessed 5/07/2015, 10h48). The signatory parts 

of OSPAR (Convention for the Protection of the marine Environment of the North-East 

Atlantic) have the obligation to fight and prevent the pollution, as well as protect the seas 

against the human activities (http://www.dgrm.mam.gov.pt – accessed 05/07/2015, 

11h40; http://www.ospar.org – accessed 05/07/2015, 12h01). The United Nations 

Environment Programme (UNEP) was created as a global environmental authority that 

promotes the implementation of the environmental dimension of sustainable development 

within the United Nations system, acting as an authoritative advocate for the global 

environment (http://www.unep.org - accessed 05/07/2015, 14h56). 

Considering that the most effective measure to reduce marine litter is to find the 

source and reduce it (Gilligan et al., 1992; Cullen &amp;amp; Frost, 1997; Earll et al., 2000; 

Williams &amp;amp; Tudor, 2001; Cunningham &amp;amp; Wilson, 2003; Santos et al., 2005; Araújo et 

al., 2006; Araújo &amp;amp; Costa, 2007), linking the marine debris to their source is an extremely 

difficult task that can only be achieved with monitoring actions. Thus, marine litter is one 

of the descriptors of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), which is 

fundamental to achieve the good environmental status of marine waters until 2020 

(Directive 2008/56/CE; Galgani et al., 2013). This descriptor is referred as Properties and 

quantities of marine litter do not cause harm to the coastal and marine environments. One 

of the steps to characterize it is assessing the trends in amount of litter washed ashore 

and/or deposited on coastlines (Galgani et al., 2013).

There have been multiple monitoring studies with the purpose of assessing marine 

litter, wherein beach surveys have been the most chosen methodology to assess coastline 

(Ribic, 1990; Ribic et al., 1992). This method allows a reproducible and representative 

sample (Cunningham &amp;amp; Wilson, 2003), guaranteeing a large amount of samples at a 

minimum cost, since the equipment required is minimal. These surveys can also be 

performed virtually under any weather conditions (Rees &amp;amp; Pond, 1995; Cuomo et al., 

1998) and it is a place that tends to accumulate several objects that come from different 

sources, through the action of winds, waves and currents (Martinez-Ribes et al., 2007). 

Despite these numerous advantages, this method also has some disadvantages, like the 

underestimate of the amounts of debris, since not all litter items reach the shore (Dixon 

&amp;amp; Dixon, 1981). The data collected on beach surveys can also be considered non 

representative of the condition of the coastline, because the choice of beaches depends on 

its easy access (Rees &amp;amp; Pond, 1995).  

Because the quantity of debris on a beach depends on debris characteristics, beach 

dynamics, weather conditions, oceanic circulation patterns, beach cleaning and the 

offshore recreation and commercial practices, there are different sampling strategies 

accordingly to the various types and sizes of debris (Rees &amp;amp; Pond 1995). Gilligan et al. 

(1992) surveyed the litter in all the length of the surveyed sites, from the low tide line to 

the high tide line. Frost &amp;amp; Cullen (1997) established 5 transects with a width of 10m, from 

the low tide line to the vegetation line, separated 10m from each other. Valender &amp;amp; 

Mocogni (1998) assessed marine litter within the 5 main strand lines that are formed as 

the tide recedes. Debrot et al. (1999) also surveyed transects that were placed in the 

middle of the beach, with a width of 8.5 to 150m. Cunningham &amp;amp; Wilson (2003) 

established 27 parallel to the shoreline transects of 5m width and Araújo et al. (2006) 

used 4 transects of 50m width, placed from the low tide line to the vegetation line. Araújo 

et al. (2007) observed the entire study area by walking along the shoreline, starting the 

survey two hours before low tide. Ribic et al. (2010) sampled 500m and Topçu et al. 

(2012) placed 2m width transects parallel to the coast. Finally, Rosevelt et al. (2013) 

established 2 transects against the wrack line, separated by 5m. Given the variability of 

each site features, the methodologies applied varied relative to the extension of the 

sampling area and the way marine debris was surveyed (Quintela et al., 2012).  

Considering the non-comparability of the results obtained in many of the previous 

studies, in 2010, OSPAR published Guidelines for Monitoring Beach Litter, as a formal 

monitoring instrument (Galgani et al., 2010), based on a pilot project. This instrument 



9 

 

was delineated to generate data on marine litter, following a standardized methodology, 

ensuring a practical and cost-effective way to conduct monitoring. The selection of the 

beaches should take into account that beaches should be composed by sand or gravel, as 

well as being exposed to the open sea; be of easy access to the removal of litter and be 

accessible all year round; have a minimal length of 100m or over 1km, be free of buildings 

all year round and, ideally, should not be subject to other litter cleaning activities. 

However, in this document it is also noted that each coastal area has its own 

characteristics and that this protocol should be adjusted if necessary (OSPAR, 2010). 

According to OSPAR, the researchers should choose one of the survey lengths (100m or 

1km). If the chosen one was the 100m survey, all the surveyed litter has to be removed 

from the site and, in case it is large object, it should be marked to avoid being surveyed 

again. This guideline recommended that the surveys should be done four times per year, 

according to the seasons and also provided a survey form, a multilingual photo guide, a 

photo guide for regional and unusual items and a practical field photo guide to assist the 

fieldwork.  

The OSPAR Pilot Project on Monitoring Marine Beach Litter (2007) was the first 

region-wide project in Europe to develop a unique methodology for monitoring the debris 

on North-East Atlantic beaches (Galgani et al., 2010). This study presented the results of 

the types and amount of litter surveyed in six years, including the description of indicator 

items that could correspond to a specific source. Although this study has showed that the 

Iberian coast did not register as much litter as the northern regions, it was registered that 

Portugal has canyons with large quantities of litter (Mordecai et al., 2011), despite being 

as distant as  is the case of the seamount in Açores (Pham et al., 2013). Martins &amp;amp; Sobral 

(2011) also referred the vulnerability of the coast of Portugal to plastic accumulation on 

beaches (both from land and marine sources). Therefore, Portugal is no exception 

regarding the influence of marine litter and it is important to monitoring this problem. As 

such, the purpose of this work is to relate the presence of marine litter with some coastal 

characteristics, in order to analyze how this relationship influences the monitoring that 

should exist within the scope of Marine Strategy Framework Directive (following the 

methodology of OSPAR) and assess the main origins of the surveyed litter.

2.2. Material and Methods 
 

2.2.1. Study Area 

 

 In order to assess the type and amount of marine litter, beach surveys were 

conducted, similar to what has been done in several other studies (e.g. Frost &amp;amp; Cullen, 

1997; Cunningham &amp;amp; Wilson, 2003; Araújo et al., 2007; Ribic et al., 2010; Topçu et al., 

2012; Rosevelt et al., 2013). These surveys have been accepted as the best cost-effective 

methodology to study marine litter (Rees &amp;amp; Pond, 1995) because of the simple logistic 

involved and because beaches allow accumulation of litter that does not float. 

Considering the importance of relating the amount of marine litter with some 

characteristics of the coast, eleven beaches (Figure 1) were randomly chosen and 

surveyed.  

Almost all surveyed beaches had sandy substrate and they all are highly 

frequented in the summer. Santo Amaro, Carcavelos, Sesimbra, Portinho da Arrábida and 

Figueirnha are facing south, while São Lourenço, Maçãs, Grande, Castelo and Fonte da 

Telha are facing West. São Lourenço, Maçãs, São João, Castelo and Fonte da Telha have 

North/Northeast prevailing winds, while the others had Northeast as prevailing winds 

(APA, 2013). Two beaches belong to the Arrábida Marine Protected Area, which 

highlights the importance of marine conservation. The selected beaches also presented 

the recommended characteristics by OSPAR to monitor the marine litter (Guideline for 

Monitoring Marine Litter on the Beaches of the OSPAR Maritime Area, 2010).  



11 

 

 

 

Since the type and abundance of marine litter are influenced by the morphology 

and topography of the beach (Valender &amp;amp; Mocogni, 1999), a good classification of the 

surveyed sites allows a better understanding of the litter present in the coast. Considering 

this, the surveyed beaches were characterized according to length, substrate, slope, 

distance do estuary and urbanization, as shown in Table 1. For such characterization, it 

was used information of the “Perfil de Água Balnear do Ministério da Agricultura, do 

Mar, do Ambiente e do Ordenamento do Território”. The features slope and distance to 

the estuary were defined, through comparison between the surveyed sites, since the 

purpose was to classify the beaches in groups.

The sampling scheme followed in this study was adopted from OSPAR. Transects 

were used to survey the beaches, as done in multiple studies such as Thornton &amp;amp; Jackson 

(1998) and Williams &amp;amp; Simmons (1999). The three transects were placed in the centre of 

the beaches, separated by 50 m, from the low tide line to the vegetation line. The 

placement of these transects was recorded by photograph in order to assure that the same 

stretch of the beach was consistently surveyed during the study period. Each transect was 

marked by a nylon cable of 4/5mm thickness and distance was measured with a measuring 

tape. It is important to notice that each beach had different widths and that, in order to be 

possible to compare the amount and type of litter present in the different zones of the 

beach (low tide line, high tide line and vegetation line), it was necessary to divide each 

transect into areas of twenty square meters (10 m x 2 m). These areas were marked 

directly in sand and this scheme is represented in Figure 2.

The fieldwork consisted in scraping the sand with a rake, covered with a 5 mm 

mesh in order to retain the smaller objects, in each area, in order to collect the litter in the 

surface as well as the litter buried in the shallow sand. The buried litter was considered 

important since it is significant and has to be considered for a more correct analysis and 

monitoring of the marine litter in beaches (Kusui &amp;amp; Noda, 2003). The litter was collected 

and stored for later analysis in the laboratory, following the Guideline for Monitoring 

Marine Litter on the Beaches in the OSPAR Maritime Area (2010). 

With the purpose of sampling the maximum area possible, the surveys were 

conducted on days with equinoctial tides, according to the methodology of Frost &amp;amp; Cullen 

(1997) and Rosevelt et al. (2013).The beaches were also sampled one hour and a half 

before the low tide, since this time was enough to cover all the extension of the selected 

beaches. The surveys were conducted quarterly from September, 2014, to June, 2015. 

The OSPAR Marine Litter Monitoring Survey Form was followed in order to 

identify and register the type of debris. However, after the survey trial it was verified that 

some amendments to the survey form were necessary. The category plastic/polystyrene 

pieces (0-2.5 cm; 2.5-50 cm and &gt;50 cm) was separated into two different categories due 

10m 

Figure 2 - Survey’s scheme representing the three transects (distanced by 50m each), 

established from the low tide to the vegetation line. Each transect was divided into squares 

of 10x2m.

to the high number of individual polystyrene pieces encountered, which could influence 

the final results. Considering its relevance in recent marine litter studies (Carpenter &amp;amp; 

Smith Jr., 1972; Andrady, 2011; Claessens et al., 2011) and because a high number of 

this type of item was recorded during the trial survey, the category pellets was added to 

the list of marine debris. Thus, the material required for this work was three nylon cables; 

two rakes with a net covering of 2x2 mm; plastic bags to collect the litter items; labels to 

identify the bags, gloves to catch the litter and a measuring tape. 

 

2.2.2. Sampling method 

 

To assess the influence of the characteristics of beaches and season in the marine 

litter recorded, a permutational multivariate ANOVA (PERMANOVA) was done (using 

the program Primer 6 version 6.1.13 &amp;amp; Permanova + version 1.0.3). The data was 

transformed using a square root transformation, so that the results were not influenced by 

the dominant or rare categories. A resemblance matrix was built using Bray-Curtis 

similarity (Mckinley et al., 2011; Castro et al., 2013;). If PERMANOVA showed 

significant effects, pair-wise tests were carried out, among all factors. A SIMPER test 

was made to identify the types of litter responsible for the significant differences among 

beaches and seasons. A PCO was made to visualize the relationship between litter and 

the beach characteristics. All this analysis were done using the Primer 6 version 6.1.13 &amp;amp; 

Permanova + version 1.0.3.Sesimbra and Grande beaches were withdrawal of the analysis 

for Winter and Spring for having too many null values that affected the results. 

 Considering that tackling the source is probably the most important outcome of 

monitoring marine litter, in order to identify possible sources of the litter surveyed in this 

study, indicator objects for land and marine activities were used. The objective was to 

find some specific type of litter that could be considered an indicator, representing 

possible sources for marine litter. To consider a litter item as a marine litter indicator, the 

items should be typical for the source it represents, common and frequent in the survey 

area and easy to identify, find and count (OSPAR, 2007). 

First, for each beach and each season, the most abundant type of litter was 

determined. Thereafter, this type was identified as having either a terrestrial or a marine 

origin, following the methodology of Silva-Iñinguez et al. (2003). When the items had a 

doubtful origin, they were designated as having mixed origin. After this general 

characterization, general and specific indicators were identified, with the purpose of 



15 

 

assessing the origin of the litter surveyed. These indicators were established following 

the criteria of OSPAR (OSPAR Pilot Project on Monitoring Marine Beach Litter - 

Monitoring of marine litter in the OSPAR region, 2007), taking into account the 

information from Ribic et al. (1998). This characterization was done based on the three 

most abundant types of debris found on each beach and at each season. The litter that was 

more represented in a particular beach and that was an important indicator of the origin,  

was also taken into account. .If some type of litter was not dominant but it was distinctive 

of a specific beach, it was also taken into account. 

  



16 

 

2.3. Results 
 

 A total of 7 743 items belonging to eleven litter categories were collected from all 

beaches (0.55 item m-2). Plastic, paper and sanitary waste were the predominant types of 

litter in this study, with plastic as the most abundant item (Table 2). The litter showed a 

clear spatial pattern whereas the high tide line was the one with more litter, with a total 

of 4 783 items (2.3 items m-2), followed by the vegetation line, with 1 681 items (1,50 

items m-2) and by the low tide line, with 1 279 items (0.58 items m-2) (Table 3). Only the 

low and high tide lines had statistical significant differences (H (2, N=33)=6.2494; 

p=0.044)), with a p-value of 0.048. The amount of litter was higher in the autumn season 

(4569 items), followed by winter (2269 items) and spring (905 items). 

Of the 11 surveyed beaches, Maçãs was the one with a higher number of marine 

of litter (3 483 items), followed by Carcavelos (987 items). São Lourenço and Sesimbra 

were the beaches with less litter registered (201 and 113 items, respectively). 

Maçãs had the greatest amount of plastic (2817 items) and sanitary waste (382 

items), whereas Santo Amaro had the greatest amount of paper (327 items) and presented 

the highest diversity of types of litter, along with Fonte da Telha (Table 2).

Table 3 - Number of items of marine litter found in each beach zone (low tide line, high 

tide line and vegetation line) 

 

The PERMANOVA results show that both the beaches (Pseudo-F = 7.675, p = 

0.001) and the seasons (Pseudo-F = 8.281, p = 0.001) have an influence in the amount of 

litter found (Table 4). Regarding the seasonal variation, there were significant differences 

between the amount of litter in all the seasons (p&lt;0.05), as presented in Table 4. The 

majority of beaches, when compared with each other, showed significant differences in 

the amount of the surveyed litter (p&lt;0.05). However, there were some exceptions: Fonte 

da Telha showed no significant differences with Figueirinha (p=0.104), São João 

(p&lt;0.115), Castelo (p=0.063) and Santo Amaro (p=0.063); Figueirinha showed no 

significant differences with Sesimbra (p=0.075), Castelo (p=0.115) and Portinho da 

Arrábida (p=0.051); Portinho da Arrábida showed no significant differences with Grande 

(p=0.166); Sesimbra showed no significant differences with Castelo (p=0.119) and 

Grande (p=0.061); São João showed no significant differences with Castelo (p=0.889). 

To Fonte da Telha, Figueirinha, Sesimbra, São João, Castelo and Santo Amaro, the 

amount of litter showed seasonal homogeneity (Table 5). Autumn was significantly 

different from winter (p=0.027) and winter was significantly different from spring 

(p=0.039) in Portinho da Arrábida. Autumn was significantly different from spring and 

winter from spring in all the other beaches: Carcavelos (p=0.011; p=0.017), Maçãs 

(p=0.003; p=0.045) and São Lourenço (p=0.017; p=0.033) (Table 6).

The results of the Simper test revealed that the most different beaches, with the higher 

average dissimilarity value, were Sesimbra and Maçãs (72,05%), Maçãs and São 

Lourenço (66.28%) and Figueirinha e Maçãs (63.08%). The beaches with the lowest 

average dissimilarity were São João and Castelo (32,62%) (Table 7). The main type of 

litter responsible for the dissimilarity in the surveyed beaches was plastic, with the 

exception of Fonte da Telha, São João and Castelo, in which paper was the main reason 

of dissimilarity. Regarding the seasonal variability, plastic was the major responsible for 

the dissimilarities between seasons.

The PCO analysis does not show a very clear separation between beaches. PCO 

axis 1 explained 39.4% of total variation inherent in the resemble matrix, and slightly 

separated Maçãs from the bulk of the other beaches. PCO axis 2 explained 16.7% of total 

variation. This analysis explains 56.1% of total variation. It is possible to observe that 

urbanization is negatively correlated with PCO1, and that distance to estuary, length, 

slope and substrate are positively correlated with PCO1. Maçãs showed a relation with 

the variable urbanization (Figure 3).

Regarding the sources of marine litter, the majority of items was considered to have 

mixed origin, since the most abundant type of debris was plastic and polystyrene pieces 

(0-25cm). In autumn, litter collected on the beaches of Portinho da Arrábida and Sesimbra 

were identified as having marine origin (since pellets were the most common item). In 

winter, litter found in Santo Amaro was considered of land based origin, since the main 

litter item was cigarette butts. Maçãs‘s litter was considered of marine origin (main type 

was pellets). It is important to point out that the litter found in Fonte da Telha, Portinho 

da Arrábida, São João, Castelo, Carcavelos and Grande had land-based origin, due to the 

presence of cigarette butts found, that were related to beachgoers and the presence of 

restaurats.  

It is important to point out that with the exception of Sesimbra a lot of debris  was 

from land-based origin, including the amount of cotton bud sticks found in all beaches,.

beaches: urbanization, distance to estuary, length, slope and type of substrate.

The majority of cigarette butts was found in the last squares, what can be due to 

beachgoers. Maçãs was the site where the largest amount of fisheries and aquaculture 

related waste was recorded, since a large number of fish boxes, rope (with a diameter 

bigger than 1cm), string and cord (diameter less than 1cm), nets and pieces of net &amp;lt;50cm 

and light sticks (tubes with fluid) was collected from this beach. Figueirinha, where a 

large number of stripping bands was found, had a considerable amount of litter from 

shipping, including offshore activities

2.4. Discussion 
 

 The purpose of this work was to relate the presence of marine litter with some 

coast characteristics, in order to understand how this relationship influences the 

monitoring that should exist within the scope of Marine Strategy Framework Directive 

(following the methodology of OSPAR) and assess the main origins of the surveyed litter. 

 The amount of litter found along the coastline was inferior to the values of litter 

registered in other studies, as registered by Silva-Iñinguez et al. (2013), 1.52 items m2, 

and it was superior to others studies such as Smith &amp;amp; Markic (2013), with 0.24 items m2. 

The surveyed sites in this study suffered the influence of Tejo and Sado estuaries which, 

according to Vasconcelos et al. (2007), are subject to high pressure, with Tejo being more 

affected by population and industry and Sado, from port activities and resource 

exploitation. Tejo also has the port of Lisboa, which is the second largest port in Portugal 

(Vasconcelos et al., 2007), which has a strong influence in the pollution verified. 

Considering these characteristics, it was expected that the beaches closer to the estuaries 

had more litter than the others (Araújo &amp;amp; Costa, 2007).  

 In general, the group of beaches that were classified as far from the estuary, that 

included three beaches (Maçãs, São Lourenço and Grande), revealead a higher abundance 

of litter than the group of the remaining six beaches (Figueirinha, Portinho da Arrábida, 

São João, Castelo, Santo Amaro and Carcavelos) classified as closer to estuaries. This 

result can only be explained by the high amount of litter found on Maçãs since, if Maçãs 

was removed from the analysis, the group of beaches closer to the estuary would have 

more debris,  as expected. However, there is not an explanation for Maçãs to have more 

debris than the beaches closer to estuaries, such as Carcavelos because, even with Colares 

stream reaching the sea next to Maçãs beach, the beaches closer to estuaries should have 

more litter. Two possible explanations could be the behaviour of the beachgoers and the 

fact that the other beaches, due to their proximity to a large urban tourist centre, like 

Cascais, are cleaned more regularly contributing to minimizing the accumulation of 

marine litter. Another possible explanation can be simply because Maçãs is located in the 

West coast, more exposed to prevailing winds that come from North and to wave 

influence (Instituto Hidrográfico, 2013). Sesimbra and Grande were interesting cases 

because both of them did not have litter in winter and, in spring, low amounts of litter 

were recorded.  



23 

 

 The beaches that were considered urban were expected to have more litter than 

the non-urban (Ariza et al., 2008). This was verified in Maçãs, Carcavelos and Santo 

Amaro. Sesimbra beach was an exception since, although it was classified as urban, it 

was the one with less abundance of marine litter. This can be due to Sesimbra having a 

smaller width, when compared to the others, which implies that the litter does not have 

time to accumulate on the beach, due to influence of the tides.  

 Determining the source of debris was extremely difficult because all beaches had 

almost all types of litter, which meant all types of origin. So, in general, the majority of 

litter was designated as mixed origin. However, it was possible to identify the specific 

sources of the most common litter in some beaches. In Sesimbra (autumn) and Maçãs 

(winter), the source of litter was identified as marine origin, which could mean that, in 

these sites, there is a high influence of ocean currents or winds. On the contrary, Santo 

Amaro’s litter (winter) was identified as land origin, which demonstrates a clear terrestrial 

influence, mainly from the beachgoers. It is interesting to notice that, the source of litter 

found in Portinho da Arrábida, varied according to the season. In winter, it was identified 

as marine origin and in autumn as land origin. This could mean that this beach may be 

more influenced by winds and/or currents in winter that in autumn, bringing during this 

season the litter from marine origin. A great number of cotton buds was collected in 

almost all beaches,  which shows that as in other countries (e.g. Moore et al., 2001; Santos 

et al., 2005), this is a problem, and the same happens with the presence of medical waste. 

This is worrying since syringes and medication packages found, can cause injuries in 

beach goers and, ultimately, represent a risk to human health. Plastic was the most 

abundant item, as in other studies (e.g. Santos et al.,2009; Gago et al.,2014).. 

 It was not possible to obtain a good relationship between the surveyed litter and 

the beach characteristics. This lack of relation can be due to the homogeneity of the 

surveyed litter. The only identifiable pattern was Maçãs that showed a clear separation 

from the other beaches. Maçãs was also related to the urban occupation, which 

corresponds to its characterization as an urban beach.  

 It is important to notice that, as expected, a spatial pattern along the coastline was 

observed. The high tide line was expected to have more litter, as well as the vegetation 

tide line, due to the fact that in the first case the tide tends to bring the litter to the beach 

(Valender &amp;amp; Mocogni, 1999) and in the second ,because the vegetation usually traps and 

retain debris (Araújo &amp;amp; Costa, 2007).  



24 

 

 The seasonal variability observed in the abundance of marine debris on beaches 

was not in agreement with the expected one since it was expected to collect more litter in 

winter due to the periods of heavy seas, storms and rain, as registered by Ribic et al. 

(2010). The higher abundance of litter during autumn may be a consequence of the 

exceptional good weather conditions that were registered in the autumn if 2014, which 

brought beachgoers to visit the beach, when the cleaning operations were not so common.  

 It is important to notice that despite the recommendations of OSPAR, the 

surveyed beaches were cleaned by the municipality during the time of the experience. 

However, this situation was minimized by the fact that, in the period of the surveys, the 

beaches were only cleaned sporadically. Also, if there was evidence that the beach had 

been clean, the sampling was carried out on another day. In this way, it was guaranteed 

that the beaches were not surveyed in the same day that were cleaned.  

 There are also some aspects related to the methodology chosen to survey the 

beaches, i.e., the width and number of transects, that need to be discussed. Several studies 

have used transects wider than the ones used in the present study, as was the case of 

Debrot et al. (1999), who used a 8.5 to 150 m width transect, as Kusui &amp;amp; Noda (2003) 

with 10 m width transect and as Bravo et al. (2009), with 3 m width transects. In the case 

of Araújo et al. (2006), it was demonstrated that it was necessary to have a transect with 

minimum 20 m width to qualitatively characterize the plastic items. Despite Araújo et al. 

(2006) study focused on plastics, their results may be applied to other types of litter. As 

for the number of the transects, although this study had only three, Valender &amp;amp; Mocogni 

(1999) showed that for a medium panorama evaluation 10 transects would be acceptable, 

from the vegetation line to shoreline. Despite all of this, the methodology of this study 

was adopted because there were only two investigators and, if there were more and wider 

transects, the effort would be enormous.  

 It is also important to notice that as demonstrated by Williams &amp;amp; Tudor (2001), 

the beaches have the capacity to bury the debris. Therefore it is necessary to be cautious 

about this study’s results since the litter that was considered as a new input could only be 

buried and for some reason have been unearthed (due to tides or winds). So it is relevant 

to bear in mind that beach surveys do not give a full representation of the marine litter 

(Thiel et al., 2013), being important to relate this study’s findings with others, such as the 

one made by Mordecai et al., 2011, in submarine canyons.  

 As UNEP (2009) referred, there has been a lack of political commitment regarding 

this problem. Therefore, more political efforts must be done, as well as a more 



25 

 

involvement of the population in this matter is very important, in order to raise awareness 

to the fact that marine litter is a global problem, and not just a regional one, and that the 

sea is a valuable natural and economic resource that needs to be protected.  

 With this study, despite the lack of a clear relation between the characteristics of 

the beaches and the amount of litter collected, it was possible to identify some of the 

origins for the litter present in the coastline. It is important, in future studies, to relate the 

litter distribution with the different types of marine litter transports vectors (such as winds 

and currents). It is also important to understand how atmospheric conditions influence the 

amount and distribution of litter in the coastline.

Chapter 3: Final Remarks 

 

The purpose of this work was to relate the different characteristics of coastal areas 

with the occurrence of marine litter and to learn the implications for the design of 

monitoring plans. Plastic, paper and sanitary waste were the predominant types of debris 

found in the study area. In general, the main items were plastic (0-2.5cm), polystyrene 

(0- 2.5cm) and cigarette butts, also considering the high number of cotton bud sticks 

collected. The high amount of the last items, demonstrates that it is necessary to educate 

the population and evaluate the flaw in the water waste treatment, in order to find a 

practical way of stopping the cotton bud sticks to enter the sea. 

Regarding the sources of the marine debris collected, the majority was considered as 

having a mixed origin. However, the litter identified as having a land origin was mainly 

due to the beachgoers and the litter identified as having a marine origin was mainly due 

to the item pellets, which can originate from spillage of cargo in oceanic waters, during 

transportation.  

Maçãs was the beach with the highest quantity of marine litter, contrary to 

Sesimbra where the lowest values were observed. The analysis of the quantity of litter 

along the beach showed that the highest number of debris was found in the high tide line, 

followed by the vegetation line. This suggests that if the monitoring studies focus on this 

part of the beach, the survey would catch an important amount of litter and it would reduce 

the costs and effort to survey the entire beach. Autumn was the season with the highest 

amount of litter. Despite considered in the OSPAR Guideline, monitoring beaches during 

summer in Portugal proved to be a difficult task. It was not possible to conduct the 

summer survey due to the strong and constant presence of beachgoers and to the fact that 

the beaches are cleaned every day. Thus, monitoring marine litter in Portugal, in this 

season, would be strongly affected by both aspects influencing the data obtained.  

The baseline is that there is a need for more relevant information, considering the 

objectives of Marine Strategy Framework Directive, that faces the challenge to achieve 

good environmental status by 2020 (Galgani et al., 2013). To do so, it is necessary to 

evaluate the main problems of each European Union Member State, which can only be 

achieved with the recognition of the seriousness of the marine litter problem. In Portugal, 

within the framework of the implementation of MSFD, an effort to put into practice 

projects as BDLixList and LiMar, that have the purpose of quantifying the marine litter 

on the coast (creating a national database), and to determining bioindicators for the 



27 

 

Descriptor 10 to be applied to Portuguese marine waters (Programa de Monitorizaç ao? e 

Programa de Medidas - Annex IV (2014).  

It is important to complement the present study in order to understand the 

dynamics of marine litter in Portugal. Similar monitoring studies should be done 

encompassing a higher time period, as done by Ribic et al 2010, and considering others 

factors, such as the weather and current information at the time of the survey, considered 

a week or two before and as done by Cunnigham &amp;amp; Wilson (2003). Further studies could 

also apply different methodologies, in order to understand how effective a type of survey 

for the site particular characteristics is. Relate the different types of litter transport with 

the amount of litter, establishing a relationship of cause and effect could be an interesting 

study, as well as to assess how the oceanic currents influence the coastline litter, 

identifying the nationality of the litter. As most marine debris are land-source it is 

important to  dedicate studies to estuaries and rivers in order to quantify how much litter 

(and what type) is transported down the river to reach the sea, as done in Moore et al., 

(2011).
