Abstract
Catalysts based on molybdena supported on gamma-Al2O3, containing between 5 and 20wt% MoO3, were prepared and characterized by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption (BET method) and Acoustophoresis. This latter technique was applied to determine the Isoeletric Point (IEP) of the catalysts and their separate constituents: molybdenum and aluminum oxides. The results were compared to those previously obtained via Electrophoresis by Llambias at al. (1984). Accordingly, the IEP values of the supported catalysts were between the isoelectric points of Al2O3 and MoO3 . However, the IEP value of MoO3 measured by acoustophoresis as 0.6, was significantly lower than the figures earlier reported by those researchers. This value is closer to those cited by other references and to the predicted value estimated from IEP correlations. The apparent surface coverage (ASC) calculated from acoustophoresis data was equivalent to the one from electrophoresis, in spite of the differences in the absolute IEP values of MoO3 and corresponding supported catalysts. It is proposed that, in this case, acoustophoresis is a more adequate technique for measuring the IEP, minimizing or avoiding a probable effect of specific adsorption of cations on the surface of molybdenum oxide.

Resumo
Os pontos isoelétricos (PIE) de catalisadores à base de óxido de molibdênio suportado em alumina foram determinados por meio de acustoforese e comparados com os resultados obtidos por eletroforese por Llambias et al. (1984) para sólidos similares. Foram preparadas amostras com teores de MoO3 entre 5 e 20% m/m, as quais foram caracterizadas quanto à textura, padrão de difração de raios X e PIE. Os resultados foram comparados com os obtidos para os sólidos componentes de referência, alumina e MoO3. Os valores de PIE dos catalisadores suportados situaram-se, como esperado, entre os pontos isoelétricos da alumina e do óxido de molibdênio. No entanto, o valor do PIE do MoO3 obtido por acustoforese foi igual a 0,6, muito inferior ao relatado anteriormente por aqueles autores. Este valor é mais próximo aos citados em outras referências na literatura e compatível com correlações para previsão de PIE. A cobertura aparente de superfície (CAS) calculada a partir dos PIE determinados por acustoforese foi igual à obtida por eletroforese, apesar das diferenças nos valores absolutos de PIE do MoO3 e dos catalisadores suportados. Propõe-se que a técnica de acustoforese proporciona, neste caso, uma medida mais adequada do PIE, minimizando ou evitando um provável efeito de adsorção específica de cátions na superfície do óxido de molibdênio.

Introduction
Hydrotreating catalysts are employed in refining processes aiming at reducing contaminants and pollutants in fuels. These catalysts are constituted by sulfides of group VIB elements (Mo or W) promoted by sulfides of group VIII elements (Ni or Co) and supported on a refractory oxide, like alumina or silica-alumina. They are most commonly prepared in the oxide form by impregnation of aqueous solutions of metals precursors followed by drying and calcination. The active phases are obtained by sulfidation in presence of hydrogen and sulfur compounds.
The activity of these catalysts in the sulfided form depends, among other properties, on the interaction between the metal precursors and the support as well as on the dispersion of the oxide-supported phase, which will be the subject of the present paper.
The dispersion of alumina-supported molybdenum oxide catalysts has been studied by different methods such as XPS (Dufresne et al. 1981, Quincy et al. 1989), Raman (Dufresne et al. 1981, Quincy et al. 1989, Hu et al. 1995), oxygen chemisorption (López-Agudo et al. 1981) and electrophoresis (Gil-Llambias et al. 1982, Gobolos et al. 1984). Llambias and co-workers dedicated a notable effort on the use of this latter technique to investigate hydrotreating catalysts and succeeded using electrophoresis to study Mo/alumina catalysts prepared by aqueous impregnation with different additives (Gil-Llambias et al. 1984) (H2O2 or NH3), by calcination of mechanical mixtures of alumina and molybdenum oxide (Delarco et al. 1993) and magnesia supported catalysts (Llorente et al. 1992). Their work was mainly focused on the determination of the IsoElectric Point (IEP) of the catalyst, which is a function of the individual IEPs of the support and supported phase, as well as of their relative concentration on the surface of the catalyst.
The determination of IEP by electrophoresis is based on the principle that every surface in contact with an electrolyte tends to present a net electric charge. In the case of some metal oxides, this charge results from the amphoteric dissociation of oxi-metal groups on the particle surface. The charged surface facing with the counter-ion shell surrounding the particle is called
electric double layer, which is described by Gouy-Chapman's Diffuse Layer Theory (James and Parks 1982). For amphoteric oxides, like alumina, the intensity and the sign of this surface charge is a function of the suspension pH.
More recently, Oja et al. (1995) developed an alternative technique that allowed measuring IEP based on electroacoustic effects. When a solution containing charged particles is submitted to an oscillating electrical field, an acoustic wave of the same frequency is formed, resulting from the vibration of the particles, provided there is a difference between the liquid and the particles densities. This is the principle of the Electrokinetic Sonic Amplitude (ESA), defined as the pressure of the generated wave per unit of applied electrical field (O'Brien et al. 1990). If the charge of the particle is zero, the ESA value will also be zero, indicating the IEP of the solid. According to Maier et al. (1987) there are several advantages of the electroacoustic technique (acoustophoresis) over the electrophoresis: faster analysis, broader range of particle sizes (1 nm to 150 ;um) and the use of opaque and concentrated suspensions, which are more representative of real systems. Typically, electrophoretic measurements require solid contents as low as 0.01% in order to allow an adequate assessment of the particles velocity. In contrast, ESA measurements can be carried out with suspensions containing up to 50% solids, provided it flows easily.
While Llambias et al. (1984) have used their electrophoresis data to determine the surface coverage of MoO3, no reference has been found on such determination based on IEP data measured by acoustophoresis. Besides, the IEP value for bulk MoO3 obtained by Llambias et al. (1984) based on their electrophoretic measurements was higher than the values reported by other authors and that one obtained by correlations between the IEP and the electronic properties of the solids (Parks, 1965).
The objective of this work was to evaluate the ESA technique for studying alumina-supported MoO3 catalysts and compare the results with those obtained by electrophoretic mobility.
Experimental
Catalyst preparation
The alumina support was obtained by calcination of a commercial pure pseudoboehmite (Pural SB from Condea GmbH) at 823 K. Catalysts containing supported molybdenum oxide were prepared by wetness impregnation of alumina with ammonium heptamolybdate (HMA - Vetec p.a.) (Gobolos et al. 1984). After impregnation, the solids were kept at ambient temperature for 1 h, followed by drying at 393 K and calcination at 673 K. Two samples of bulk MoO3 were used: a commercial one supplied by Molymet and another prepared by calcination of HMA at 773 K. The diffraction patterns of these both samples confirmed the presence of crystalline MoO3.
Textural and structural characterization
The specific surface area was determined by the BET method in a ASAP 2400 equipment from Micromeritics. The X-ray patterns were obtained with a Rigaku diffractrometer with a monocromatic beam operating a 40 kV and 30 mA and using Cu Ka radiation.
Acoustophoresis
The ESA measurements were carried out in a ESA-8000 system (Matec Instruments), for which theory and operation have been earlier discussed (O'Brien et al. 1995). Basically, this equipment comprises an electronic control unit connected to a titration system and a sample cell assembly. This latter is composed of a Teflon sampler holder with pH, temperature and conductivity probes and an electroacoustic sensor for instantaneous detection of the sonic amplitude generated. The suspension was kept under stirring and an automatic burette was used for potentiometric titrations. The polarity of the oxide suspensions was established after calibrating the instrument with colloidal silica (Ludox TM 10 vol. % from DuPont). All the tests were carried out at 298 K.
Typically, 11 grams of catalyst were suspended in 200 mL of distilled water and the ESA signal was recorded as a function of pH using HNO3 1M or KOH 1M as titration agents.
Initial measurements with the alumina support indicated that the absence of electrolyte (KCl) was not affecting the IEP determination with the ESA method. This result encouraged us to carry out the experiments without electrolyte added to the suspension, despite the common recommendation for the use of an electrolyte for electrokinetic potential measurements. In this case, ions present in solution would come only from titration agents.
Results
The MoO3 contents and specific surface areas of the catalysts are shown in table 1. The molybdenum oxide contents of the catalysts correspond to the surface coverage range from 0.95 to 3.8 Mo atoms per nm2 of support surface area. 3.8 Mo atoms/nm2 is lower than the value corresponding to a MoO3 monolayer on alumina, i.e., 4.6 Mo atoms/nm2 as reported by Hu et al. (1995).
The XRD patterns of some catalysts and reference samples are presented in figure 1. Up to 18 wt.% of MoO3, no crystalline molybdenum oxide was detected and only the diffraction bands of gamma alumina could be observed. This result can be considered as an evidence of a good dispersion of the supported phase. The sample Mo20/Al2O3 showed small diffraction bands in the 20 region between 24 and 28°, which were attributed to bulk molybdenum oxide, indicating that at least part of the supported molybdenum oxide species could be not so well dispersed.

The calcination of HMA at 773 K gave a well crystalline MoO3 sample, adequate to be used as reference material for the acoustophoresis measurements.
Concerning the textural properties of the catalysts, it was observed a slight decrease in surface area with increasing molybdenum oxide content, basically due to the lower relative weight of the support (alumina). There was no evidence of surface area loss of the support during the catalyst preparation.
The ESA potential vs pH curves for Mo/alumina catalysts and reference materials are presented in figure 2. The measured isoelectric points, corresponding to the pH at zero ESA potential, are summarized in table 2.
An IEP value of 8.23 was found for pure alumina, which is comparable to other results reported in the literature. This value is also similar to the figures obtained for other commercial aluminas analyzed in our laboratory with the ESA-8000 system. For bulk MoO3, it was not possible to obtain positive values of ESA, even at very low pH, due to dissolution of this compound in strong acidic medium. In this case, the IEP value was estimated by extrapolation of the linear part of the potential curve and the following IEP values were found: 0.66 for commercial pure MoO3 and 0.48 for the MoO3 prepared by HMA decomposition. These values are significantly different from the ones reported by Llambias et al. (1984) (6.25), in a similar study with Mo/ alumina catalysts.

Assuming that the electrical behavior of the molybdenum oxide species on the supported catalysts is the same as in the bulk MoO3 one could expect their IEP values between those of the support and the supported phase (Llambias et al. 1984). Indeed, the measured IEP of the catalysts ranged from 6.1 to 1.8, between the mentioned reference values. Also according to expectation, the higher the MoO3 content, the lower was the IEP of the catalyst, approaching the value for bulk MoO3 as shown in table 2.
The IEP of the supported catalyst is a function of the weighted contributions of the IEP of the support and the supported phase. Therefore, it is possible to relate the IEP of the catalyst with the fraction of the alumina surface covered by the molybdenum oxide species. According to Llambias et al. (1982), the apparent surface coverage (ASC) may be calculated as follows:
ASC = MS -1 (IEPS - IEP)/[(Mm1 - MS-1) (IEP - IEPS) + Mm 1(IEPS - IEPm)] . 100 (eq.1)
Where:
M is the molecular weight and the subscripts S and M are related, respectively, to the support and to the supported phase.
The ASC numbers, as calculated from the corresponding experimental IEP values, are shown in table 2. As expected,
the ASC increased with the molybdenum oxide content in the catalyst, so as the sample Mo20/Al2O3 showed 89% of the support covered.
Discussion
The IEP of the alumina support measured by acoustophoresis (8.23) were in accordance with those reported in literature (Llambias et al. 1984, Delarco et al. 1993, Gonzáles et al. 1994) and determined by other methods. Moreover, this value is within the range of IEP found for other commercial aluminas tested in the same electro-acoustic equipment (8.0 - 8.7).
There are very few data in the literature concerning the IEP measurement of MoO3. Llambias et al. (1984), Llorente et al. (1992) found a value of 6.3 by electrophoretic mobility experiments. In a later paper (Delarco et al. 1993), they obtained a lower value (2.9) with the same technique; however, no explanation for such difference was given.
Parks (1965) in his classical paper about the IEP of solids, hydroxides and metal complexes in aqueous solution, reported values between 0.9 and 1.5 for MoO3.
Some authors suggested correlations for the calculation of the IEP of oxides (O'Brien et al. 1990, Gonzáles and Saraiva,
1994). Tanaka and Ozaki (1967) reported a correlation based on the Pauling electronegativity (Xo) and the charge in the metal ion (z), according to the following expression:
IEP = 14.43 - 0.58 * X
Where:
X = (1 + 2z) * Xo
Considering the electronegativity for the Mo as 1.8 (Lee, 1965) and the metal charge in the molybdenum oxide as +6, the calculated IEP for MoO3 is 0.86.
As it can be seen, the IEP obtained experimentally by acoustophoresis (0.48-0.66) agrees very well with the values estimated by correlation or referred by Parks (1965), but it is substantially different from the results reported by Llambias et al. (1984), Delarco et al. (1993), Llorente et al. (1992).
The IEP results obtained by acoustophoresis for the supported catalysts and for the reference bulk MoO3 are in perfect agreement, as it can be inferred from the IEP trend shown in table 2.
However, it is important to stress that the results obtained by electrophoresis and reported by Llambias et al. (1984) for similar supported catalysts and bulk MoO3 were also in relative agreement, even though the absolute IEP values were completely different from those obtained in the present work. Both acoustophoresis and electrophoresis, for the same catalyst preparation method, led to equivalent values of ASC (eq. 1) as shown in figure 3.
It suggests that for some reason, during the electrophoretic measurements, the IEP of both MoO3 and supported catalyst were equally affected by some physico-chemical phenomenum, which influenced their absolute IEP values. However, as equation 1 does only take into account the IEP differences (deltas), the calculated ASC resulted in corrected values.
Comparing the experimental conditions of the two techniques, they differ essentially in two aspects: (i) the solids content in the electrophoretic measurements was 0.01 wt% instead of 5 wt% for the acoustophoresis measurements and (ii) a 10-3 M KCl solution was used as electrolyte in the electrophoresis tests whereas no electrolyte, besides the added titration agent, was used during the acoustophoresis measurements.

In the electrophoretic measurements, the solids content is very low and electrolyte exists in significant concentration. There is a much higher excess of electrolyte pressing the Mo ions on the solid surface of MoO3 and related catalysts. This could have caused some specific ion adsorption and a shift in the determined IEP to higher values. In fact, for the same electrolyte (KCl) concentration, Delarco et al. (1993) found for MoO3 an IEP of 2.9 working with 0.1%solids, where as their co-workers (Llambias et al. 1984) had earlier found a value of 6.3 working with 0.01%solids.
The effect of the electrolyte concentration has also been investigated in some accoustophoresis experiments with MoO3. By using a 10-3 M KCl solution, the IEP value for the MoO3 was 0.89, close to the value of 0.66, measured without electrolyte addition. Increasing the electrolyte concentration up to 10-1 M, and hence the ratio of K+ or Cl-ions to the surface Mo ions, the IEP increased to 1.9. There is, therefore, a clear dependence of the electrolyte concentration on the IEP determination when dealing with molybdenum oxide surfaces.
According to the literature, specific adsorption of cations may occur on solid surfaces, leading to a shift towards increased IEP values and meaning that a larger amount of OH- ions will be needed to neutralize the surface. The opposite effect is expected for the specific adsorption of anions.
The specific adsorption of alkaline and alkaline-earth cations on the surface of bulk MoO3 and Mo/alumina catalysts has been reported by Escudey and Llambias (1985). They studied the effect of the electrolyte nature on the electrophoretic measurements for a Mo5/Al2O3 catalyst, using different electrolytes at a constant concentration of 10-3 M. It was concluded that the formation of a surface complex of K+ with MoO3 generated an excess surface positive charge which could not be compensated by the increase in the pH.
These results indicate that the acoustophoresis technique leads to a more realistic determination of IEP for MoO3 based catalysts, due to the possibility of operating at relatively high solids content and avoiding the use of electrolyte, thus minimizing the effect of specific adsorption.
The specific adsorption, however, do not interfere in the ASC determination by electrophoresis probably because both bulk MoO3 and supported catalyst are equally affected by the phenomenum.
The values of ASC for the supported catalysts indicate that for MoO3 contents between 5 and 20 wt % there is a homogeneous dispersion of the molybdenum oxide species on the alumina surface. For the Mo20/Al2O3, although the XRD analysis indicated the presence of some bulk MoO3, this phase should be present in very low concentration since the dispersion for this catalyst was not significantly affected (still within linear behavior in figure 3). By extrapolating the ASC curve of figure 3 to 100%, a MoO3 content of 23.8 wt% was obtained for full coverage of the alumina support. This value corresponds to 4.3 Mo atoms/nm2 which is very close to the monolayer coverage factor of 4.6 found by Hu et al. (1995) by Raman spectroscopy.
Conclusions
The acoustophoresis method has proved to be an appropriate tool for studying the surface of supported Mo/ alumina catalysts. As this technique allowed operating with high solids content and without electrolyte, a likely phenomenum of specific adsorption of cations on molybdenum oxide surfaces (bulk or supported) could be avoided or minimized. This resulted in IEP values for MoO3 comparable to the values reported by Parks or calculated by correlations between IEP and chemical properties of metal oxides. In contrast, previous eletrophoretic experiments operating at conditions that favors such specific adsorption, led to absolute IEP figures probably far from reality.
On the other hand, the apparent surface coverage of the support by Mo oxide species, here calculated from IEPs measured by acoustophoresis, showed excellent correlation with the data obtained by Llambias et al. (1984) using electrophoretic measurements.
The monolayer theoretical coverage for MoO3 determined in the present work (4.3 Mo atoms/nm2) is comparable to the value reported in the literature (4.6 Mo/ nm2), as obtained by Raman spectroscopy.
