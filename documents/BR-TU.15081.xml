ABSTRACT: The development of new methodologies and tools that enable to determine the water 

content in soil is of fundamental importance to the practice of irrigation. The objective of this study 

was to evaluate soil matric potential using mercury tensiometer and puncture digital tensiometer, 

and to compare the gravimetric soil moisture values obtained by tensiometric system with 

gravimetric soil moisture obtained by neutron attenuation technique. Four experimental plots were 

maintained with different soil moisture by irrigation. Three repetitions of each type of tensiometer 

were installed at 0.20 m depth. Based on the soil matric potential and the soil water retention curve, 

the corresponding gravimetric soil moisture was determined. The data was then compared to those 

obtained by neutron attenuation technique. The results showed that both tensiometric methods 

showed no difference under soil matric potential higher than -40 kPa. However, under drier soil, 

when the water was replaced by irrigation, the soil matric potential of the puncture digital 

tensiometer was less than those of the mercury tensiometer. 

 

KEYWORDS: tensiometer, digital tensiometer, neutron attenuation technique.

AVALIAÇÃO DA UMIDADE DO SOLO SOB DIFERENTES LÂMINAS DE IRRIGAÇÃO 

 

RESUMO: O desenvolvimento de novas metodologias e instrumentos que possibilitem determinar 

o conteúdo de água no solo é de fundamental importância para a prática de irrigação. O estudo teve 

por objetivo avaliar a eficiência do tensiômetro de punção e a leitura digital em relação ao 

tensiômetro de coluna de mercúrio e leitura analógica, na obtenção do potencial mátrico, e 

comparar os valores da umidade do solo obtidos a partir da tensiometria com a técnica da 

moderação de nêutrons. Foram aplicadas em quatro parcelas experimentais as lâminas de água (de 

238,9; 159,8; 118,2 e 65,0 mm). Três repetições de cada tipo de tensiômetro e o sistema de leitura 

foram instalados na profundidade de 0,20 m. A partir dos valores do potencial mátrico obtidos pelos 

tensiômetros e pela curva de retenção de água no solo, foi determinada a umidade do solo, e os 

dados foram comparados com a técnica da moderação de nêutrons. O potencial mátrico da água no 

solo, medido pelo tensiômetro de punção de leitura digital, não apresentou diferença em relação aos 

valores obtidos pelo tensiômetro de mercúrio, em potenciais mátricos maiores que -40 kPa. Com 

ciclos de umedecimento e secamento do solo, o potencial mátrico obtido pelo tensiômetro de 

punção com leitura digital foi menor do que os valores obtidos pelo tensiômetro de mercúrio. 

 

PALAVRAS-CHAVE: tensiômetro, tensímetro digital, técnica de moderação de nêutrons.

INTRODUCTION 

The soil has the capacity to store water in its pores and provide part of it to the plants to the 

extent of their needs. Through monitoring of matric water potential in the ground, it is possible to 

determine the amount of water needed to be replaced to the plants by irrigation. The appropriate 

irrigation can significantly reduce the amount of water applied, in order to minimize loss of water 

and soil, increase crop yield and reduce production costs. 

There are direct and indirect methods to determine soil moisture. The best known direct 

method is the gravimetric method and, among the indirect, it has the electrical resistance blocks, 

neutron probe, gamma radiation, tensiometry, psychrometrics, computed tomography and time 

domain reflectometry (ALBUQUERQUE &amp;amp; DURÃES, 2008). 

The gravimetric method is considered standard, however, involves collecting soil samples for 

each measure, making it laborious and impacting to the environment, because of the constant 

removal of soil from the area. This method does not allow the measure replicates in the same place, 

therefore, it is not suitable for evaluation which require many steps over time (CICHOTA et al., 

2008). 

There are three direct ways to measure the influence of soil water content on matric potential. 

They are: Richards pressure chamber, Haines funnel and tensiometer (LIBARDI, 2005). 

Although the three methods use a porous plate, the only one that allows direct measurement in 

the field is the tensiometer. Its working principle is based on the balance between the capillary 

forces and adsorption which occur because of the interaction between water and solid soil particles. 

The use of a tensiometer has the advantage of indicating the time and amount of irrigation 

water to be applied to the soil, which requires knowledge of soil water retention curve. 

Since its inception, the original version of the tensiometer has been showing modifications 

(WHALLEY et al., 2009), especially in the reading system and the constituent materials, which 

have as their objective to facilitate the installation of equipment in the field, improve its operation, 

maintenance and response time, and facilitate reading by the operator. 

The reading system may be indicated by a manometer in the form of U-tube with water or 

mercury, or a mechanical or electrical indicator (REICHARDT &amp;amp; TIMM 2004). 

The conventional tensiometer uses as reading system the mercury column manometer, and a 

direct measurement of matric potential. However, it has disadvantages, such as toxicity of mercury, 

the manual accomplishment of readings, with the possibility of visual error in reading by the 

operator, and the need for constant maintenance of the apparatus to eliminate air bubbles inside the 

tensiometer. 

The tensiometer of mercury manometer is used for research purposes, however, for practical 

purposes, as its use in the field, presents operational difficulties. Thus, it is necessary to evaluate a 

reading system that facilitates its use. 

To facilitate the operation and maintenance of a tensiometer, a pressure transducer with 

digital reading (MARTHALER et al., 1983) has been developed, which measures the tension in the 

tensiometric tube, and whose values are displayed on a digital display. 

The development of new methodologies and tools that allow determining the soil water 

content is of great importance for agronomic knowledge and scientific research (TEIXEIRA et al., 

2005). 

Another technique for determining the soil water content is the neutron moderation, which 

allows the soil water content to be obtained directly, with minimal change in the soil profile, at any 

time and in a fast and practical way. Its disadvantage is the cost of equipment. However, few studies 

in the literature compare the effectiveness of these technologies in the determination of soil water 

content. 



Measurement systems of soil water matric potential and evaluation of soil moisture under different irrigation depths 

Eng. Agríc., Jaboticabal, v.32, n.3, p.467-478, maio/jun. 2012 

469 

Given the above, the hypothesis of this study is that the soil water matric potential measured 

by puncture digital tensiometer shows no difference compared to values obtained by mercury 

tensiometer and soil moisture determined by tensiometry and soil water retention curve does not 

differ from that obtained by the technique of neutron moderation. 

The objective was to evaluate the efficiency of digital tensiometer in relation to an analog 

mercury tensiometer, in obtaining the matric potential, and compare the values of soil moisture 

obtained from tensiometry with the technique of neutron moderation. 

 

MATERIAL AND METHODS 

The experiment was conducted in an experimental area of Faculty of Agriculture and 

Veterinary Sciences (FCAV), UNESP, Jaboticabal, State of São Paulo, Brazil (21°14’51” S and 

48°16’58” W). The experimental area was classified as an Oxisol (EMBRAPA, 2006), whose 

physical attributes are presented in Table 1. 

For determination of granulometric fractions of soil samples, it was used the pipette method 

(GEE &amp;amp; BAUDER, 1986). For analysis of soil bulk density, total porosity, macroporosity and 

microporosity of the soil, it was used the method proposed by EMBRAPA (1997). 

To conduct this study, it was selected four plots (P1, P2, P3 and P4) of a larger experiment 

which aimed to evaluate different methods to determine the height of the irrigation depths for 

irrigation of common bean. The culture was established in June 2008, conventional tillage in the 

conventional manner (chiseling and disking). The bean cultivar Carioca was used, spaced 0.45 m 

between rows.

*The values are mean of 3 repetitions per plot.  

 

Each plot occupied an area of 864 square meters (54 m long by 16 m wide). The borders of 

the plots corresponded to the initial and final 9 m length and 4 m from the sides, leaving the floor 

area of each plot with 288 m² (36 m x 8 m). 

In the plots P1 and P2, the irrigation depths were determined by estimating the maximum 

evapotranspiration of the bean and tensiometry. The methodology adopted for the onset, frequency 

and volume of irrigation depths applied to the plots is described in FERNANDES (2008). 

The plots P3 and P4 were subjected to four and two irrigations, as shown in Table 2, in order 

to obtain variation in soil water content in relation to other plots. 

The amounts of water, applied to each portion (irrigation depth) by a conventional irrigation 

system, were measured using a set of twelve manometers and their mean values, as well as 

precipitation occurred during the experiment (Table 2). 

To evaluate the uniformity of water distribution, it was used the uniformity coefficient of 

CHRISTIANSEN (1942), whose mean value was 87.9%, therefore, within the minimum value 

adopted as reference for the system of irrigation, which is 80%.

15 days after crop emergence, it was installed in the center of the plots and between the crop 

rows, three repetitions of the column analog mercury tensiometer and three digital tensiometer, 

totaling four parcels, 12 tensiometers of each reading system. 

The tensiometer was installed at a depth of 0.20 m with the aid of an auger screw, one beside 

the other, in row, 0.15 m apart from each other, alternately (in pairs), i.e., a mercury tensiometer 

followed by a digital tensiometer. The repetitions were far apart in the 9 m plot. 

The capsules of the ceramic tensiometers were submitted to bubbling test, which was 

consisted of subjecting the capsules to pressure increases, with the reference values of more than 

100 kPa. 

The readings of matric potential began 20 days after crop emergence, held daily from 7:00h 

and 8:00h, for a period of 52 days. The values of soil water matric potential, measured in mm of Hg 

with the mercury tensiometer, were processed and corrected to kPa by eq.(1): 

?m = (-12,6 h1 + h2 + h3 ) 0.0981          (1) 

 

In which:  

?m - soil water matric potential, kPa;  

h1 - manometric height of the mercury column, cm;  

h2 - height from the mercury surface in the recipient to the soil surface, cm; and  

h3 - tensiometer installation depth considered from the soil surface to the porous capsule 

center, cm. The value 0.0981 represents the transformation factor from cm of water 

column to kPa.  

 

The values of soil water matric potential measured with the puncture digital tensiometer were 

converted to kPa and corrected by the eq.(2): 

?m Dig = [(1019L) + (h1 + h2 )] 0.0981         (2)

In which:  

?m - soil water matric potential, kPa;  

L - tensiometer reading, bar; 

h1 - water column of the soil surface until the water level of the transparent tube, cm; and  

h2 - tensiometer installation depth from the soil surface to the porous capsule center, cm. The 

value 0.0981 represents the transformation factor from cm of water column to kPa. 

  

The puncture digital tensiometer used was of the Hydrodynamics brand, whose voltage-

reading unit is provided in CBAR by means of a digital display. 

In order to assess the reliability of the values of soil water matric potential obtained by 

puncture digital tensiometer, it was made its calibration in the laboratory. For this, a tensiometer 

was constructed to allow both reading systems, mercury manometer and puncture digital 

tensiometer, to work together in the same tensiometric tube. The matric potential values measured 

by both reading systems were equivalent, indicating reliability of the values obtained by the digital 

tensiometer (Figure 1).

FIGURE 1. Calibration of digital tensiometer reading system. 

 

As the tensiometer does not provide direct reading of soil moisture, it was determined 

indirectly from the characteristic curve of soil water retention. For this, it was collected undisturbed 

soil samples from each experimental plot in a depth of 0-0.20 m in three replications. The samples 

were subjected to the tensions progressively 0.001; 0.002; 0.003; 0.004; 0.005; 0.006; 0.007; 0.008; 

0.009 and 0.01 MPa, using a tension table, and to the tensions of 0.03; 0.06; 0.1; 0.3 and 1.5 MPa 

using the Richards pressure chamber with the porous plate (KLUTE, 1986). 

The water retention in tension of 1.5 MPa was determined in deformed samples of soil, 

following the method proposed by EMBRAPA (1997). Subsequently, an adjustment was made of 

data of the water content retained in the different tensions by the model of GENUCHTEN (1980). 

Additionally, with the aim of measuring soil moisture by neutron moderation technique, an 

aluminum access tube was installed with internal diameter of 0.048 m and length of 1.9 m in each 

experimental plot. The access tube was installed on the same line where the tensiometer were 

installed and located between the second and third repetitions of tensiometers, i.e., 4.5 m away from 

each tensiometers repetition. The model of the neutron probe equipment used was 503 DR 

Hydroprobe of CPN Corporation, 
241

Am/Be source of neutrons and radioactive intensity of 

1.85 GBq. The time to obtain neutron counts was 32 seconds and was based on experimental results 

obtained by BERALDO et al. (2009). 

The methodology for calibration of a neutron probe consisted primarily of counting neutrons 

in water, as standard, and then in the soil, to obtain the relative neutron count (RC), which is 

defined as the ratio of soil neutron count and water neutron count.

The neutron probe calibration was performed under field conditions. Two access tubes were 

installed, one irrigated with frequency and the other kept free of irrigation, in order to obtain 

variations in the soil water conditions. The RC measurements were obtained at a depth of 0-0.20 m, 

with eighteen repetitions. After the determinations, deformed soil samples were taken using 

volumetric rings to determine the gravimetric soil moisture in the laboratory. 

From the values of RC and gravimetric soil moisture (average of 18 data pairs), the linear 

regression equation was obtained, as shown by equation 3: 

? = - 0.068 + 0.7802 RC R
2
 = 0.95         (3) 

 

In which:  

? - gravimetric soil moisture in the layer of 0-0.20 m, and  

RC - relative neutron count.  

 

It was performed analysis of correlation and regression between the matric potential values 

obtained by the mercury tensiometer and the puncture digital tensiometer. Two statistical indices 

were used to quantify the differences between changes in soil water matric potential obtained by the 

two reading systems, they being the correlation coefficient (r) and the concordance index (d), 

proposed by WILLMOTT et al. (1985). 

Because the statistical indexes do not quantify the errors, the indicators of mean absolute error 

(MAE) were certain, the square root of mean square error (SRMSE) and efficiency (EF) as 

ZACHARIAS et al. (1996). The matric potential values obtained from the mercury tensiometer 

were considered as reference for comparison between the reading systems. 

 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

The values of soil water matric potential obtained by the tensiometers ranged from -5 to -80 

kPa (Figure 2). From values of matric potential lower than -80 kPa it was not possible to obtain 

readings measured by tensiometry. This is due to the action of matric forces acting on the soil, 

causing a gradient of potential energy which causes water to flow from within the capsule into the 

soil, i.e., from a higher energy place to a place with lower energy. As a result of transfer of energy, 

the air contained in the soil is able to pass through the porous capsule wall, causing breakage of the 

equilibrium column between the water contained inside the tensiometric tube and the soil water. 

This was observed in plots P2, P3 and P4 in the period between July 21
st
 and 29

th
, 2008, because, in 

this period, values of soil water matric potential lower than or equal to -80 kPa were recorded, the 

limit value of reading tensiometer (Figure 2). 

The values of soil water matric potential in P1 remained the same, with greater frequency in 

potential greater than -40 kPa, i.e., more humid conditions, as was expected due to the higher 

frequency of irrigation and greater irrigation depth applied in this plot. 

It was observed similar values of water matric potential between the reading systems when 

these were kept at up to -40 kPa (Figure 2). In periods in which occurred soil drying with 

subsequent replacement of the water, the greatest differences were observed between the values of 

the readings of tensiometers with different reading systems, as may be seen on July 25
th

, shortly 

after irrigation (Figure 2) and in the evaluation period from June 25
th

 to July 15

FIGURE 2. Soil water matric potential measured by the mercury tensiometer (Tens Hg) and 

puncture digital tensiometer (TensDig) in plots P1 (a) P2 (b), P3 (c) and P4 (d). 

 

ASSIS JÚNIOR &amp;amp; REICHARDT (1997) observed in field work that the response of the 

mercury tensiometer and the air chamber tensiometer was similar, but in a condition in which the 

values of soil water matric potential were greater than -40 kPa. 

It was observed lower amplitude between the values obtained by the mercury tensiometer and 

puncture digital tensiometer when the matric potential was less than -40 kPa when compared with 

the mean amplitude during periods where the value of matric potential was higher than -40 kPa 

(Table 3). 

In periods in which the value of matric potential was lower than -40 kPa the mean amplitude 

(in modulus) ranged from 1.3 to 2.1 kPa, whereas when the value of matric potential was higher 

than -40 kPa, the mean amplitude ranged from 8.0 to 12.9 kPa, so a great difference between 

reading systems for the matric potential, when one takes into account the ranges above and below 

-40 kPa. With progressive cycles of wetting and drying, the air volume inside the tensiometer 

changes, which causes a failure of the device response (MARINHO et al., 2008). 

COELHO &amp;amp; TEIXEIRA (2004) found that errors in the values of matric potential, obtained 

by mercury tensiometer, as well as a tensiometer comprising an electronic circuit and a differential 

pressure sensor, tend to be more evident as the matric potential decreases, i.e., when the soil dries. 

Under conditions of wetting and drying of the soil, the utilization of a capacitive sensor which 

has extreme values of dielectric constant in different environments (air and water) showed low 

response time to variations in soil water content (CRUZ et al. 2010), thus constituting an alternative 

to estimating the soil water content under conditions of wetting and drying soil.

In most of the dates evaluated in this study, the values of the matric potential measured by the 

puncture digital tensiometer were higher (less negative) when compared with those obtained using 

the mercury tensiometer (Figure 2). Similar results were observed by MORAES et al. (2006) and 

BRITO et al. (2009). This result may be attributed to a slight increase in potential, in the moment 

the silicone rubber is pierced by the needle of the tensiometer, because, with the insertion of the 

needle, the volume of air inside the tensiometric tube is changed. 

The lowest and highest coefficient of determination (R
2
) between the values of soil water 

matric potential measured by the two reading systems have been observed in the plots P1 and P4, 

respectively. This fact shows that the potential values observed are similar when the soil is more 

humid and they are most disparate in drier soil conditions (Figure 3). 

These results corroborate the results found by MARTHALER et al. (1983), who obtained a 

high coefficient of determination (R
2
 = 0.99) between the readings of soil matric potential measured 

with a mercury tensiometer and digital pressure transducer. The authors attributed the results to 

higher frequency of irrigation that kept the soil moist. 

Also in Figure 3, it can be observed that the greatest data scattering in relation to the line 1:1 

occurred for values of matric potential lower than -40 kPa, confirming that this was the value from 

which occurred the greatest differences between the values of soil matric potential measured by the 

two systems.

FIGURE 3. Regression and correlation analysis between the soil water matric potential (module) by 

mercury tensiometer and puncture digital tensiometer in plots P1 (a) P2 (b), P3 (c) and 

P4 (d). 

 

The observed values of the concordance indexes and linear correlation used (d, r, EF, MAE 

and SRMSE) were high, indicating that the results obtained with puncture digital tensiometer 

correspond to the values obtained with the mercury tensiometer (Table 4). However, the highest 

values were observed in the plot P1 and the lowest in the plot P4, which suggests that, with the 

wetting of the soil, the value of matric potential obtained from the two reading systems tend to have 

more similar results. A perfect match occurs when d, r and EF are equal to 1.00 and MAE and 

SRMSE are equal to zero. 

Considering the evaluation period and the values of soil moisture obtained by tensiometry and 

by the technique of neutron moderation, it appears that both methods respond similarly to changes 

(increase or decrease) in their values. However, soil moisture measured by the two systems of 

tensiometry showed more similar values between each other and, in most cases, higher when 

compared to those obtained with the technique of neutron moderation (Figure 4). The radius of 

influence of the neutron probe is higher when compared to that of the porous capsule of the 

tensiometer, providing measures in a larger volume of soil. 

The major difference between moisture values obtained by the tensiometry and by the 

technique of neutron moderation was observed in P4 (Figure 4). This result indicates that the 

response between the methods may differ, especially at lower soil moisture, whose replacement of

water was not sufficient to raise the values of soil moisture. Near the operation limit of the 

tensiometer, the differences between the readings of the tensiometer and the probe are greater than 

the differences when the soil was humid. 

It is observed that the values of soil moisture obtained by the technique of neutron moderation 

decreased from August 15
th

 at P4, whereas the values did not vary by tensiometry. Under these 

conditions, the tensiometer has a limitation, because its use is restricted in measuring potential 

values up to approximately -80 kPa. 

Under high soil moisture conditions, the tensiometry was adequate for their indirect 

estimation. However, the puncture digital tensiometer stood out in relation to mercury tensiometer 

because it presents simpler operation and maintenance, provides reading less influenced by the 

operator and do not use toxic product.

Measurement systems of soil water matric potential and evaluation of soil moisture under different irrigation depths 

Eng. Agríc., Jaboticabal, v.32, n.3, p.467-478, maio/jun. 2012 

477 

The results of this study indicate that the puncture digital tensiometer may be used to monitor 

the soil water matric potential under field conditions, with similar results to those obtained with the 

mercury tensiometer. However, it is recommended periodic maintenance of the silicone rubber to 

prevent air entering the system. 

 

CONCLUSIONS 

The soil water matric potential measured with the puncture digital tensiometer showed no 

difference compared to values obtained by mercury tensiometer for potential greater than -40 kPa. 

With cycles of soil wetting and drying, the matric potential obtained by puncture digital 

tensiometer was lower than the values obtained by mercury tensiometer.
