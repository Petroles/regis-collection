ABSTRACT

Short-term variability in composition and abundance of copepod populations were studied during the
dry (winter) and rainy (summer) seasons, at the dam region of Jurumirim Reservoir, São Paulo, Brazil.
An intensive sampling program was carried out during 30 days in each period of the year. Samples
and measurements were taken every other day at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 m depths. The relationship
between variability of the populations and some environmental factors was analyzed. The main species
were: Argyrodiaptomus furcatus (Sars), Notodiaptomus iheringi (Wright), Mesocyclops longisetus
(Thiébaud), Thermocyclops decipiens (Fischer), and T. minutus (Lowndes). Thermocyclops minutus
was the most abundant species in dry season and its abundance varied significantly between sam-
pling days. A large increase in abundance of calanoids occurred during the rainy season. This increase
was correlated with higher temperature values. At that time, Notodiaptomus iheringi was dominant.
This species showed significant short-term variations in abundance in both dry and rainy seasons.
Significant variation in density of populations within the same sampling period might result from
either the dispersion pattern of the populations or continuous substitution of the water masses. Sig-
nificant correlation was observed between copepod abundance and temperature, especially for species
of calanoids and there was also some correlations between densities of particular species of cope-
pods and some phytoplankton taxa, mainly during the dry season. As for vertical distribution, most
organisms were found between the surface and 15 m deep. During the rainy season, there was some
evidence of the occurrence of spatial segregation between species of cyclopoids and calanoids, with
the cyclopoids in a deeper position within the water column.

Key words: short-term variability, copepod, Calanoida, Cyclopoida, tropical reservoir.

RESUMO

Variabilidade em curto prazo na abundância de copépodos na Represa de Jurumirim,
São Paulo, Brasil

O presente estudo examinou a variabilidade na composição e na abundância das populações de
copépodos, em dois períodos do ano, seco (inverno) e chuvoso (verão), na região da barragem da
Represa de Jurumirim, São Paulo, Brasil. Foram realizadas coletas a cada 48 horas, durante 30 dias,
em cada período; a amostragem da comunidade e as medidas das variáveis ambientais foram feitas
a 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 e 25 metros de profundidade. As relações entre a variabilidade das populações e
alguns fatores ambientais foram analisadas. As principais espécies encontradas foram: Argyrodiaptomus
furcatus (Sars), Notodiaptomus iheringi (Wright), Mesocyclops longisetus (Thiébaud), Thermocyclops
decipiens (Fischer) e T. minutus (Lowndes). Thermocyclops minutus foi a espécie mais abundante
no período seco e sua densidade variou significativamente entre os dias de amostragem. Ocorreu um
grande aumento na abundância de Calanoida durante a estação chuvosa. Esse aumento foi correla-

cionado a maiores valores de temperatura. Nessa época, Notodiaptomus iheringi foi dominante, a
densidade dessa espécie apresentou variações de curto prazo significativas em ambos os períodos de
estudo. Variações significativas na densidade das populações dentro de um mesmo período de estudo
podem ser resultado do padrão de dispersão das populações ou da substituição contínua das massas
de água. Foram observadas correlações significativas entre a abundância de copépodos e a temperatura,
especialmente para as espécies de Calanoida; também foram observadas correlações entre algumas
espécies de copépodos e alguns táxons fitoplanctônicos, principalmente durante a estação seca. Durante
a época chuvosa, notaram-se evidências de segregação espacial entre as espécies de Cyclopoida e
Calanoida; os Cyclopoida, algumas vezes, foram encontrados em maior densidade na camada mais
profunda da coluna d’água.

Palavras-chave: variabilidade de curto prazo, Copepoda, Calanoida, Cyclopoida, reservatório tropical.

INTRODUCTION

Population adaptation to the limnetic environ-
ment is the result of a complex evolutionary process
mediated by interactions between biotic and abiotic
factors. Variations in the environment can promote
cyclic or erratic changes in the activities of the
organisms, short-and long-term fluctuations in the
abundance of populations or even substitution of
the species. Information on how the structure of
a community changes, at different temporal scales,
can contribute to a better understanding of the
functioning and evolution of the ecosystem.

Several researchers in Brazil have inves-
tigated patterns of temporal variations of the
zooplankton, including populations of Copepoda.
Most of the studies have considered diurnal rhy-
thms and seasonal fluctuations (Tomm et al.,
1982; Fisher et al., 1983; Infante, 1982; Matsu-
mura-Tundisi &amp;amp; Okano, 1983; Matsumura-Tundisi
et al., 1989; Lansac-Tôha et al., 1995; Nogueira
&amp;amp; Matsumura-Tundisi, 1996; Nogueira &amp;amp; Pana-
relli, 1997). However, information about short-
term fluctuations in density are scarce, despite
the fact they can have an important role in
plankton dynamics in tropical zones. According
to Nilssen (1984), higher velocities of biological
processes in the tropics are the main difference
between temperate and low latitude lakes. Moreover,
reservoirs built for hydroelectric production tend
to show lower hydrodynamics stability, due to the
shorter water retention time, than natural lakes. Thus,
studies on short-term variability are of major impor-
tance for understanding the dynamics plankton
communities in this kind of ecosystem, which can
be subject not only to the natural variations but

also to variations imposed by the operational
system for electricity production.

The aim of this study is to investigate patterns
in short-term variability of zooplancton abundance
in the lacustrine zone of a tropical reservoir (Juru-
mirim Reservoir), located in the State of São Paulo,
Brazil. Sampling was carried out in the dry (winter)
and rainy (summer) seasons in order to discriminate
the influence of seasonal effects. In this paper we
present data on Copepoda populations while data
on Cladocera and Rotifera are being analyzed to
be published opportunely.

STUDY AREA

Jurumirim Reservoir (Fig. 1) is a large reser-
voir built in 1962 for generating hydroelectricity.
It is located in the upper region of the Parana-
panema River (Upper Paraná basin), State of São
Paulo, Brazil. The main water body is positioned
between latitudes 23o08’ and 23o35’S and longi-
tudes 48o30’ and 49o13’W. The reservoir receives
two large tributaries on its southern side, the
Paranapanema and Taquari rivers, and several small
rivers and streams enter the northern shore.

The zone of the reservoir near the dam is oligo-
trophic with characteristics of a warm monomictic
system. Thermal stratification is observed during
the rainy season and a mixing period occurs during
the dry season. Further information on primary
production, as well as physical and chemical cha-
racteristics of this reservoir, including its different
spatial compartiments can be found in Henry (1990,
1992, 1993a, 1993b); Henry &amp;amp; Gouveia (1993);
Henry &amp;amp; Maricatto (1996); Henry &amp;amp; Nogueira
(1999); Nogueira et al. (1999).

SHORT-TERM VARIABILITY OF COPEPOD ABUNDANCE IN JURUMIRIM RESERVOIR 579

Some morphometric characteristics, including
outflow during the sampling periods, are shown
in Table 1.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

The data were obtained in the lacustrine zone
of the Jurumirim Reservoir (Paranapanema River,
State of São Paulo), at a sampling station located
3 km from the dam. Local depth was 30 m. Physical
and chemical measurements and zooplankton sam-
ples were taken every 5 meters from the surface
to 25 m. Field work was carried out every other
day (in the morning) from 1 to 29 July 1993 (dry
season winter) and from 11 January to 8 February
1994 (rainy season summer).

Water transparency was measured with a Sec-
chi disk; water temperature with a Toho Dentan
thermistor (ET-3); dissolved oxygen by the Winkler
method (Golterman et al., 1978); pH with a Mi-
cronal B380 pHmeter; conductivity with a Hatch

conductivimeter (model 2511); suspended solids
by gravimetry, as described in Cole (1979), and
the phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll-a con-
centration) was estimated according to Golterman
et al. (1978), using cold acetone as solvent. Cli-
matological data (air temperature, wind speed and
precipitation) acquired from a meteorological
station located near the dam were supplied by the
electric company, Cesp (Companhia Energética
de São Paulo).

For quantitative analysis of the zooplankton,
300 liters of water were collected at each sampling
layer using a gasoline pumping system connected
to a hose 38 mm in diameter. This volume was filtered
using a plankton net of 55 µm mesh size. A net with
the same mesh size was used in vertical hauls for
taking samples for qualitative analysis. All samples
were preserved in 4% formalin. Papers of Matsumura-
Tundisi (1986); Reid (1985, 1988, 1989); Rocha &amp;amp;
Matsumura-Tundisi (1976); Sendacz &amp;amp; Kubo (1982)
were used for fying species.

Calanoida (nauplii, copepodids and adults)
and Cyclopoida (adults and copepodids) were
counted on a stereo microscope (ZEISS, Stemi
SV6), using sub-samples with at least 150 indi-
viduals or the entire sample, when the density of
organisms was low. Sub-samples (with at least 150
organisms) were used to count nauplii of Cyclo-
poida in Sedgwick-Rafter chambers, using an opti-
cal microscope (ZEISS, Standard 25). Schematic
drawings (camara lucida) and pictures (scanning
microscopy) of the species are showed in Figs. 4,
5, 6, 7, and 8.

Statistical analyses were performed to verify
short-term variability of copepod abundance (ANO-
VA), and also to detect correlation between abiotic
factors and population densities of copepods and
phytoplankton (Pearson correlation). The values
of abundance for phytoplankton taxa were obtained
from Ferreira (1998), who analyzed the total phy-
toplankton collected at the same sampling station,
in the same depths and on the same days when the
zooplankton were sampled. For both analyses SAS
software was used.

RESULTS

Environmental factors
For some variables, e.g., precipitation, water

temperature, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll-

a the differences between the periods studied were
evident.

The data on precipitation and wind speed are
represented in Fig. 2. During the sampling period
corresponding to the dry season the rainfall was
low, 1.13% of total precipitation for 1993. During
the sampling period corresponding to the rainy
season, precipitation was relatively high but not
frequent and constituted 23.76% of the total for
1994. Wind speed showed high daily oscillations
for both periods of the year. During the rainy season
the daily mean was 139 km per day–1 (1.61 m. s–1).
In the dry season there were longer periods of low
wind speed and the daily mean was 116 km per
day–1 (1.35 m.s–1).

Some vertical profiles of water temperature
and dissolved oxygen are shown in Fig. 3. In the
dry season the water column remained isothermal
and the profiles varied between 19oC and 21oC for
most of the period; there were also some near-
surface microstratifications. During the rainy season
a thermocline was generally observed below 20 m
and occasionally some secondary stratification
occurred in the superficial layers. Temperature
ranged between 24oC and 27oC in the epilimnion
and between 21oC and 23oC in deeper layers. High
oxygen concentrations were observed, with a rela-
tively homogeneous vertical distribution during
the dry season.

SHORT-TERM VARIABILITY OF COPEPOD ABUNDANCE IN JURUMIRIM RESERVOIR 581

In the rainy season there was a significant
oxygen decrease below 20 m in the meta and hypo-
limnetic zones.

The chlorophyll-a concentrations (Fig. 9)
were higher in the dry season. During this period
there was a remarkable daily variation in the values
measured in the water column. In the rainy season
a relatively low variation in chlorophyll con-
centration was observed, except for the first ten
days.

The results of the variance analysis performed
in order to identify differences between sampling
days and between depths are shown in Table 2.
There were significant differences, between sam-
pling days for both periods studied. There was no

significant variation for vertical distribution of the
environmental variables during the dry season.
However, most variables showed significant
differences in the water column during the rainy
season.

Copepoda
Copepoda is an important group in the zoo-

plankton of Jurumirim Reservoir. They constituted,
in terms of mean density, 26% and 27% of the total
zooplankton (Cladocera 6% and 9%; Rotifera 64%
and 63%) in the dry and rainy season, respectively
(Panarelli, 1999). The abundance of Copepoda
varied significantly within the same sampling pe-
riod, for both dry and rainy seasons.

However, a greater variation was observed
during the dry season, when there was lower density
at the beginning of the sampling period and an
increase in the number of organisms in the second
half of the period. During the rainy season a peak
of abundance occurred in 25 January. In the other

days relatively lower values were found with some
moderate variation (Fig. 10).

During the dry period, Cyclopoida was more
abundant than Calanoida and from 3 to 9 July cons-
tituted more than 90% of the copepods. During the
rainy season, it a large increase of Calanoida was

observed and also some alternation in the proportion
of abundance between the orders (Fig. 11). Figs.
12 and 13 show the relationships among the deve-
lopment phases of Calanoida and Cyclopoida,
respectively. Proportions among nauplii, copepodid
and adult were more stable for the cyclopoids,

mainly in the rainy season, when the nauplii had
a relative abundance larger than 80%, during the
whole sampling period. Larger proportion of cope-
podids and adults of cyclopoids was noted during
the dry season. Nauplii of calanoids were propor-
tionally more abundant during the dry season.

In the rainy season the copepodids of cala-
noids showed larger abundance. The species of
Copepoda found in this study are the calanoids
Argyrodiaptomus furcatus (Sars) and Notodiap-
tomus iheringi (Wright), and the cyclopoids Meso-

cyclops longisetus (Thiébaud), Thermocyclops
decipiens (Fischer), and T. minutus (Lowndes)
(Figs. 4 to 8). Variations in abundance of the
species of Calanoida and Cyclopoida for both
seasons are shown in Figs. 14 and 15, respectively.



Braz. J. Biol., 61(4): 577-598

588 PANARELLI, E. A., NOGUEIRA, M. G. and HENRY, R.

During the dry season, T. minutus dominated
among Copepoda adults.

The pattern of variation in this period was si-
milar for the three species of Cyclopoida, M. lon-
gisetus, T. decipiens, and T. minutus. There was also
a certain similarity in patterns for A. furcatus and
N. iheringi. The Calanoida variation coincided with
the variation pattern of all copepods, which indicates
that this suborder had an important influence in fluc-
tuation of the group as a whole.

The variance analysis detected significant
differences in abundance variation for T. minutus
and N. iheringi. In relation to vertical distribution,

only T. minutus showed significant variation bet-
ween depths (Table 2).

During the rainy season, N. iheringi was do-
minant among the adults of Copepoda. T. decipiens
and T. minutus showed similar variations in abun-
dance. On some days, the numerical increase of
the species of Thermocyclops coincided with a
decrease in the density of M. longisetus. The den-
sity of N. iheringi varied significantly with days
and depths, but T. minutus did not.

As to the proportion between male and
female, N. iheringi showed similar values for both
sexes in the two seasons studied (Fig. 16).

SHORT-TERM VARIABILITY OF COPEPOD ABUNDANCE IN JURUMIRIM RESERVOIR 589

T. minutus showed higher female proportion
in most sampling days, mainly in the rainy season.
Male of T. decipiens were generally absent or in
density very inferior to that found for the females
(Fig. 17). In Fig. 18 presents some selected profiles
on vertical distribution of the main copepods spe-
cies. A larger number of organisms was found
within the first 20 m of depth during the dry season.
A higher abundance of T. minutus was found bet-
ween 0 and 10 m. During the rainy season Noto-
diaptomus iheringi exhibited larger densities of
individuals above 15 m. At that time, the species
of Thermocyclops were generally more abundant
between 10 and 25 m (Fig. 18).

Analysis of correlation between the species and
the environmental variables

Water temperature showed higher corre-
lation with density of the species of Calanoida,
especially with N. iheringi during the dry season
(Table 3).

Some correlation between densities of zoo-
plankton and phytoplankton was especially evident
in the dry season, when A. furcatus was positively
correlated with Cryptophyceae, and most Calanoida
showed negative correlation with Aulacoseira spp.,
Cyclotella stilligera, and Monoraphydium mi-
nutum.

During the rainy season, for only N. iheringi
was there a positive correlation with Microcystis
aeruginosa and Chroomonas acuta, while M. lon-
gisetus showed a negative correlation with Mono-
raphydium minutum (Table 3).

DISCUSSION

During both dry and rainy periods the zoo-
plankton community in Jurumirim Reservoir was
dominated numerically by rotifers (Panarelli, 1999).
Copepoda was the second group in abundance, and
constituted, on the average, 26% of total zoo-
plankton.

However, if the same results were expressed
in units of biomass, probably the importance of
the copepods in the community structure would
be even more prominent. Numerical dominance
in the zooplankton community by rotifers was also
found in another oligotrophic reservoir, Broa
Reservoir, in the State of São Paulo (Matsumura-
Tundisi et al., 1989). Rotifers constituted 65.5%
of total zooplankton, followed by cladocerans

(17.2%) and copepods (16.9%). However, when
these values were expressed in terms of dry weight,
the copepods exhibited the largest proportion of
total biomass, 80.8%, followed by cladocerans,
13.8% and rotifers, &amp;lt;5%.

Major differences were observed in population
abundances and dominance between dry and rainy
periods, which indicates that seasonal effects are
important factors in the dynamics of these populations.
The dominance of Cyclopoida, especially T. minutus
during the dry season, and the numerical increase
of Calanoida, mainly N. iheringi in the rainy season,
were probably related to temperature variation and
the phytoplankton community structure. The species
of Calanoida showed a significant correlation with
water temperature.

Espíndola (1994) verified experimentally, that
the development of N. iheringi from egg to phase
nauplius I decreased with temperature increase, from
4.3 days at 18oC to 1.1 days at 28oC. The deve-
lopment time from egg to egg significantly
decreased as well, from 17.6 days at 23oC to 9.7
days at 28oC. At a lower temperature (18oC) there

was an increase in mortality rate and a decrease
in reproductive efficiency for these species. These
data show that a considerable increase in number
of copepods can occur due to fast development
in high temperature conditions. On the other hand,
Rietzler (1995) observed in experiments with T.
minutus a decrease in longevity with temperature
increase, from 37 days at 18oC to 7.7 days at 28oC.

The results of the experiments mentioned above
show that N. iheringi and T. minutus seem to have
better physiologic performance (longevity and
development time) in different temperature ranges.
This fact contributes to understanding the pattern of
variation in calanoid and cyclopoid abundance obser-
ved in the present study, with higher density of
calanoids during the rainy season (with temperature
near 24.6oC) and higher density of cyclopoids in the
dry season (temperature near 19.8oC).

Higher proportions of copepodids and adult
calanoids observed during the rainy season can be

associated with greater longevity in high temperature
conditions. The same can be inferred for cyclopoids
in lower temperature conditions. The higher density
of nauplii in possibly adverse conditions (cyclopoid
in warmer and calanoid in cooler periods) can be
a strategy of these populations for remaing in the
environment with the generation of great numbers
of descendents, even so a small only a small part
of these reach the adult phase. Nogueira (1996),
Nogueira &amp;amp; Panarelli (1997), and Mitsuka (1998)
verified the same variation pattern in the ratio of
Calanoida/Cyclopoida abundance when compared
to the dry (winter) and rainy (summer) seasons in
Jurumirim Reservoir. The male/female relation was
more stable for N. iheringi in both seasons, with
similar values for male and female density. The male/
female ratio was stable for T. minutus during the
dry season, but a high was obser ved in the rainy
season, when this species was less abundant. Males
of T. decipiens appeared only sporadically.

In the dry season there was a tendency towards
spatial segregation between N. iheringi, which
generally occupied superficial layers (between 0
and 5 m), and the two species of Thermocyclops,
which were more abundant below 5 m.

Probably the species of Cyclopoida are distri-
buted preferentially in layers where temperature
values are lower, whereas during the period of iso-
thermal conditions these species showed higher
abundances between 0 and 10 m depth. The presence
of the species of Thermocyclops in deeper layers
during the thermal stratification period, also indicates
that they can tolerate lower concentrations of dis-
solved oxygen, which are observed in the region
near the hypolimnion. In a study on vertical mi-
gration of zooplankton in Jurumirim Reservoir, No-
gueira &amp;amp; Panarelli (1997) verified preferential
distribution of T. minutus in the hypolimnion, espe-
cially during the day and in stratified conditions.

Ferguson et al. (1982) considered temperature
and food resources as the main factors responsible
for changes in population densities and in the age
structure of zooplankton communities. The chlo-
rophyll-a values did not show significant correlation
with the zooplanktonic population, however when
analyzed the phytoplanktonic groups showed cor-
relations mainly in the dry season. For copepods,
we should consider that calanoids and cyclopoids
have different feeding preferences. Calanoids are
filter-feeding and cyclopoids capture alimentary
particles. Esteves &amp;amp; Sendacz (1988) suggested that
cyclopoids can ingest portions of filamentous and
colonial algae, which may be inadequate as a food
resource for the calanoids. On the other hand, Fulton
(1988), based on experimental results, proposed that
the inhibitor effect of blue-green algae for the
development of zooplankton, would be more related
to toxicity than to morphology of these algae. In
an experimental study on feeding processes of
Argyrodiaptomus furcatus using five phytoplankton
species, Tavares &amp;amp; Matsumura-Tundisi (1984),
verified that Scenedesmus quadricaudata was filte-
red at higher rates than Chlorella zoofingensis,
although the latter species was present in a higher
concentration. According to these authors, diffe-
rences in filtration and assimilation rates for different
algae may be associated with differences in nutrient
content and cell morphology, palatability, and even
toxicity. Rietzler &amp;amp; Espíndola (1998) analyzed the
gut content of copepods and verified for the cy-

clopoids Mesocyclops kieferi and Thermocyclops
decipiens ingestion of a high percentage of organic
detritus besides consumption of colonies of
Cyanophyceae (mainly Microcystis); for calanoids
(Notodiaptomus) the main food items were diatoms
and phytoflagellates. They concluded that colonies
of Microcystis provided (directly or not) an alter-
native food resource for cyclopoids.

During the dry season, for the same sampling
days, Ferreira (1998) found higher densities of Micro-
cystis. The capacity of the cyclopoids to use colonies
of Microcystis, or organic detritus associated with
them, can explain their dominance in Jurumirim
Reservoir in this period. Species of Cryptophyceae,
known as an edible food resource for zooplankton
(Klaveness, 1988), were positively correlated with
A. furcatus during the same season. Significant
correlations between zooplankton and phytoplankton
populations were not detected during the rainy season,
despite presence of the same species. Therefore,
abiotic factors may play a determinantal role in the
dynamics of plankton communities in Jurumirim
Reservoir during certain periods of the year.

Short-term variations in abundance of cala-
noids were observed in both periods of the year.
However, for cyclopoids, conspicuous daily varia-
tions occurred only in the dry season, when out-
flow was higher (Table 1). Zooplankton opulations
can exhibit aggregate patterns of distribution, in
patches with a large number of organisms. The
advective currents as much as the action of the
wind can promote displacement of these aggre-
gates of individuals. In spite of unverified direct
relation between wind speed and abundance
variations, it is important to notice that daily oscil-
lations in the wind speed occurred and that these
induce movements of water masses. In the present
study, the main cause of density variations of
populations during short time inter vals was
probably the transportation of organisms due to
water mass movements, as indicated by great
changes observed in density. For instance, the
fivefold increase in abundance of N. iheringi,
between 7 and 9 July, when water temperature
was relatively low (19.5oC), seems incompatible
with natural changes in the dynamics of a single
population. According to Espíndola (1994), in
these temperature conditions, increases in mor-
tality and development time rates for this species
would be expected.



Braz. J. Biol., 61(4): 577-598

SHORT-TERM VARIABILITY OF COPEPOD ABUNDANCE IN JURUMIRIM RESERVOIR 597

In reservoirs with continuous water flow,
displacement of water masses certainly contribute
to variability in population abundances. Nogueira
&amp;amp; Panarelli (1997) in studying zooplankton vertical
distribution at the dam region of Jurumirim Re-
servoir, also related a great increase in density with
displacement of adjacent water masses. They ve-
rified an increase of more than 100% in abundance
of total zooplankton within an 8-hour interval.
According to Lewis Jr. (1978), some sophisticated
information is available on zooplankton patch
structure at given instants in time, but knowledge
about the behavior of patch structure in tempo-
ral scales is still not sufficient for better unders-
tanding the relationship between temporal and
spatial variation of planktonic populations. The
movements of patches of zooplankton can have
an important role in community dynamics. The
same site can be exploited by a large number of
individuals at different times, and the same set of
organisms can exploit several parts of the eco-
system during short periods of time.

Some abiotic variables, such as temperature,
dissolved oxygen and pH, as well as abundance of
taxa of phytoplankton (Ferreira, 1998), showed signi-
ficant variations between days for the same sampling
period. This environmental variability seems to have
influenced organism distribution or even fluctuation
in abundance of copepod populations, promoting
either organism increase or decrease in distinct inter-
vals of time.

Our data showed that variations in abundance
of copepod populations, within a relatively short
interval of time, can be as great as, or even greater
than, fluctuations observed in seasonal series. This
reinforces results obtained by Twombly (1983) and
Pinto-Coelho (1987), who have emphasized the
importance of short-term fluctuations in zooplankton
community dynamics.

Our results also indicate that future inves-
tigations, in order to contribute to better unders-
tanding of zooplankton community ecology in
Jurumirim Reservoir, should include some expe-
rimental work on particular biological and ecolo-
gical responses of the main zooplankton species
to a range of variations in some determinantal
environmental variables.
