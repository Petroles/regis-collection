summary Calcium oxide (CaO) powder targets have been successfully used at CERN-
ISOLDE to produce neutron deficient exotic argon and carbon isotopes under 
proton irradiation at high temperatures (&gt;1000oC). These targets outperform 
the other related targets for the production of the same beams. However, they 
presented either slow release rates (yields) from the beginning or a rapid 
decrease over time. This problem was believed to come from the target 
microstructure degradation, justifying the material investigation. 
In order to do so, the synthesis, reactivity in ambient air and sintering kinetics of 
CaO were studied, through surface area determination by N 2 adsorption, X-ray 
diffraction for crystalline phase identification and crystallite size determination, 
and scanning and transmission electron microscopy to investigate the 
microstructure.  
The synthesis studies revealed that a nanometric material is obtained from the 
decarbonation of CaCO 3 in vacuum at temperatures higher than 550

oC, which 
is very reactive in air. This reactivity was studied, and it was observed that the 
CaO powder microstructure is changed through the reaction with air (hydration 
and carbonation of the oxide) and that this change is not completely reversible 
after thermal decomposition of the reaction products. Therefore, special care 
was taken in the target handling at CERN-ISOLDE. From the sintering kinetics, 
studied in the range of 1000-1200oC, it was determined that this material’s 
microstructure degrades, with the reduction of the specific surface area and 
decrease of the powder porosity. At 1200oC, the specific surface area reduction 
is accentuated, reaching values of 50% of surface area reduction in 10h. These 
results suggest that the use of high temperatures, equal or higher than 1000oC 
must be avoided, if the microstructural characteristics of the targets are to be 
preserved. 
At CERN-ISOLDE, selected conditions for synthesis, handling of the target and 
target operation temperatures were chosen, based on the previous material 
research, and the obtained target material was tested under proton irradiation. 
From the online studies, the newly developed target proved to show better 
initial and stable over time release rates of almost all isotopes investigated and 
especially the exotic ones. These results are essentially due to the nanometric 
characteristics of the produced target and to the use of operation and handling 
conditions that decreased the degradation of the microstructural characteristics.  
Diffusion studies of Ar and Ne were also done in CaO through the application of 
a mathematical model, to the release curves of the respective isotopes at 
different temperatures, which enables the determination of the respective 
diffusion coefficients and activation energies.

resumo Alvos de pós de oxido de cálcio (CaO) têm sido usados, com sucesso, no 
CERN-ISOLDE para produzir isótopos de Árgon (com défice de neutrões) e de 
carbono, sob irradiação com protões a alta temperatura (&gt;1000oC). Estes alvos 
têm mostrado um desempenho superior a outros alvos usados para produzir 
os mesmos feixes. Contudo, apresentam baixas taxas de libertação de 
isótopos desde o início de operação ou uma redução rápida com o tempo. 
Suspeitou-se que este problema se devia à degradação da microestrutura do 
material, justificando a sua investigação. 
Assim, a síntese, reatividade em ar ambiente e a cinética de sinterização do 
CaO foram estudadas, nomeadamente através da determinação da área 
superficial especifica por adsorção de N2, difração de raios-X para 
identificação de fases e determinação do tamanho de cristalite e microscopia 
eletrónica de varrimento e transmissão para o estudo da microestrutura. 
Os estudos de síntese do CaO revelaram que um material nanométrico, e 
muito reativo em ar, é obtido através da descarbonatação do CaCO3 em vácuo 
a temperaturas superiores a 550oC. Esta reatividade foi estudada e observou-
se que a microestrutura do pó de CaO é alterada por reação com o ar 
(hidratação e carbonatação do óxido) e que esta alteração não é totalmente 
reversível após decomposição térmica dos produtos de reação. Assim, foram 
tomados cuidados especiais no manuseamento dos alvos de CaO. Da cinética 
de sinterização, estudada na gama de 1000-1200oC, foi concluído que a 
microestrutura deste material se degrada com redução da área superficial 
específica e diminuição da porosidade do pó. A 1200oC, a redução da área 
superficial específica é acentuada, atingindo-se valores de 50% de redução em 
cerca de 10h. Estes resultados indicam que a utilização de temperaturas 
elevadas, iguais ou superiores a 1000oC, devem ser evitadas se se pretendem 
preservar as características microestruturais dos alvos. 
No CERN-ISOLDE, as condições de síntese, de manuseamento do material e 
temperatura de operação do alvo foram escolhidas, com base nos estudos 
anteriores, e o material resultante foi testado sobre irradiação de protões. 
Dos estudos online, o alvo desenvolvido provou ter melhores taxas de 
libertação iniciais e que se mantêm ao longo do tempo de libertação, 
comparativamente a outros alvos de CaO previamente usados no CERN-
ISOLDE. Isto verificou-se em praticamente todos os isótopos estudados, 
especialmente nos exóticos. Estes resultados foram atribuídos às 
caraterísticas nanométricas do alvo produzido e à utilização de condições de 
manuseamento e de operação, tais que a degradação das características 
microestruturais do alvo é reduzida. 
Estudos de difusão de Árgon e Néon foram feitos no CaO através da aplicação 
de um modelo matemático às curvas de libertação dos respetivos isótopos a 
diferentes temperaturas de operação, que permitiram a determinação dos 
respetivos coeficientes de difusão e energias de ativação.

CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, is a well-known centre 

for fundamental physics research and hosts the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the highest 

energy particle accelerator presently in operation. The beams produced with different 

energies in the large accelerator complex at CERN are available to numerous experiments. 

One of such facilities, ISOLDE (acronym for Isotope Separator On Line Device), aims at 

the production of beams of radioactive isotopes. 1,2 

The ISOLDE facility is located near the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB) at 

CERN, which supplies the facility with a pulsed proton beam 1. The proton beam is then 

conducted by a series of (bending and focusing) magnets to two separate target stations. 

Through this method, thick targets are bombarded with high-energy protons and nuclear 

reactions of spallation, fission and fragmentation occur inside the target. The reaction 

products are stopped in the bulk of the target material, diffuse out, are pumped into an ion 

source and are accelerated to form a secondary radioisotope beam. Different target/ion 

source units can be coupled to the ISOLDE front-ends for the production of the different 

radioactive ion beams (RIB). This technique is a particularly good and powerful method 

for the production of pure low energy RIB. 3 To date, ISOLDE is the facility which offers 

the largest number of different beams (eg. more than 1000 isobars of 73 chemical 

elements) in an ISOL-type facility, resulting from constant target and ion source 

developments over the last 40 years. 2 

The targets used are made of refractory materials assembled in thick targets, such 

as pure metals (molten, powder, foils), oxides (powder, fibers), carbides and other 

compounds. 4,5 These targets must be designed with important considerations: (i) target 

material must be chosen to optimize the release rate (yield) of the required isotope; (ii) 

rapid diffusion rate is important when short lived isotopes are required, or else the nuclei 

would have decayed before getting to the ionizer; for a rapid diffusion rate a high 

temperature and a material with minimal diffusion lengths (like fine powder or thin foil) 

are required; (iii) rapid effusion rate, for example, through a material with an open internal 

structure permitting the nuclei reaching the ionizer quickly; (iv) good structural strength at 

high temperatures; (v) uniform temperature in the target to prevent condensation of the 

required radioactive species and to reduce the thermal stresses in the target; this translates 

into good thermal conductivity of the target material for high intensity primary beam. 6

As referred before, target operating temperatures must be as high as possible to 

reduce the time constants of the isotope diffusion and effusion release processes, 

minimizing decay losses before extraction. The maximum operating temperature is 

constrained by the following requirements: (i) limited sintering to preserve the target 

release performance under pulsed and intense proton beam irradiation; (ii) reduced stable 

beam contaminants coming from chemical impurities; (iii) a moderate equilibrium vapour 

pressure (~10-2 Pa) compatible with the ion source operation. 4 

As so, the best target microstructure was defined as the one having a high porosity 

(&gt;30%) in the macrosize range (&gt;100 nm) within a narrow size distribution, nanosized 

grains, and stability at high temperatures. 7,8 

Calcium Oxide (CaO) targets have been successfully used at ISOLDE to produce 

neutron deficient exotic argon isotopes and carbon isotopes, released as CO and CO2 

molecules. Such targets outperform other related targets used to produce the same beams, 

such as MgO sintered powder or TiOx fibers. However, either some CaO target units 

display a slow release rates from the beginning or a rapid decrease over time when 

operated under proton irradiation. This is believed to come from a degradation of the initial 

microstructure of the targets, caused by pre-sintering effects. 9 

The large potential of these targets, for the production of exotic isotopes and the 

drawbacks detected in the release process, justifies the need to investigate the 

microstructure evolution of CaO targets, using conditions of temperature and pressure 

close to that of target operation under proton irradiation and its effect on the isotope 

diffusion.

I.1 Radioactive Ion Beams 

Radioactivity, which was first discovered by Henri Becquerel in 1895, is the 

spontaneous emission of radiation by an atomic nucleus. The emitted radiation can be of 

different types, most prominently in ascending order of penetration and descending order 

of energy: alpha (? - 4He nuclei) that can barely penetrate a sheet of paper, beta (?  - 

positrons or electrons) that can penetrate a few millimeters of aluminum and gamma (? – 

high energy photons) which can penetrate several centimeters of lead. 10 The emission of 

the radioactivity from a specific nucleus can reveal much about it, depending on the types 

of radiation and energy. It is by this emission of radiation that the less stable nuclei get to a 

more stable state, and thus this process is called decay. 

The short ranged, nuclear force keeps the nucleus together, otherwise it would 

break apart due to the very large repulsive Coulomb forces between protons, which is 

partly compensated by the number of neutrons in the nucleus, since they experience only 

attractive nuclear forces. The balance between the Coulomb force and the nuclear force, or 

the ratio of protons and neutrons for a certain isotope is what defines the stability of a 

nucleus. 10  This leads us to the question: how many nuclides exist, how many have been 

observed and which ones are stable? First of all, stable nucleus and very long lived 

isotopes, the nuclei which “natural” mater is made of, mean that a possible decay process 

occurs in the time scale of the universe or larger. 11 The other nuclei are called radioactive 

isotopes, or simply radioisotopes. 

In order to study in detail nuclear subnuclear elementary particles and high energy 

physics particle accelerators are continuously developed, constructed and operated. A 

particle accelerator is a device in which charged particles (beam) are accelerated with 

electromagnetic fields to high energies. These particles can then be sent onto a fixed target 

or brought to collide with another particle beam in the opposite direction. Advancements in 

technology allow to build more powerful accelerators, to study the elementary particles 

and their interactions. Usually, the charged particles that are accelerated are: protons, 

electrons, positrons, antiprotons, ions and even unstable isotopes, which is the case of 

ISOLDE (acronym for Isotope Separator Online Device) at CERN. 12

I.1.1 The Chart of the Nuclides 

The chart of nuclides, shown in Figure I-1, displays all the presently known nuclei 

in a grid of proton number (Z) versus neutron number (N). There are 186 stable nuclei and 

around 3600 observed radioactive isotopes, although 6000 are believed to exist in total. 11 

Standard databases also include for each nuclide the measured properties, among which 

are, relative abundance (for stable nuclides), decay modes, half-lives (for the radioactive 

ones) and masses. 13 Databases of known nuclides and the chart itself can be found on the 

Karlsruher Chart 14 or on the internet in the websites of the International Atomic Energy 

Agency 15 and the National Nuclear Data Center 16 (both of them use several sources to 

keep the data up to date). Obviously this chart is a very useful tool for physicists in these 

related fields and a good overview of what are the known nuclides and which are their 

properties. 

 
Figure I-1 - Chart of the nuclides, where the proton, neutron and fission driplines (B p , B n , B F) can be seen. 
Vertical and horizontal lines represent the magic numbers and the colors the decay modes of radioactive isotopes. 
11 

In Figure I-1, the stable nuclei (black squares) form the backbone of chart, and the 

color squares represent the radioactive isotopes (colors represent each type of decay 

mode). The vertical and horizontal thick lines provide the so-called magic numbers of 

protons or neutrons where the nuclides are especially stable. While the N=Z line follows 



 
 
 

Chapter I – State of the Art  
 

 

9 

 

the “valley of stability” for light masses, this does not apply for heavy nuclei anymore: 

they have more neutrons than protons. This can be explained by the increase of Coulomb 

forces with increasing Z as mentioned above. The neutron (Bn=0) and proton driplines 

(Bp=0) represent the theoretical limit at which nuclei are believed to exist. Also the 

theoretical fission barrier line (BF) at which no nuclide can exist without spontaneously 

fission to form smaller nuclei. The white zones represent regions where nuclei are believed 

to exist but still unknown. The isotopes that are away from the zone of the stability of the 

nuclear chart have very small half-lives and are very unstable, and therefore are much 

more difficult to produce and study. These are called the exotic nuclei. 

I.1.2 Radioactive Ion Beam Applications 

The research program based in radioactive ion beams (RIB) facilities aims at 

discovering fundamental properties of nuclear structure and at explaining the nuclide chart 

up to the predicted frontier. This covers, for example, the precise determination of nuclear 

masses, research on the properties of excited nuclear states, studies of radioactive decay 

modes, the precise determination of nuclear radii, spins and moments and also the 

investigation of atomic structure of radioactive elements. Fundamental interactions are also 

studied by RIBs, providing a contribution to the understanding of the Standard Model at 

low energies. RIBs are as well extremely useful in other fields like in astrophysics, trying 

to understand the constituents and the nuclear genesis in the stars, in which the energy is 

generated though nuclear reactions amongst stable and radioactive nuclei, and which can 

last for billions of years or explode in a few seconds. Life sciences are investigated with 

RIBs, in biochemistry and especially in the field of nuclear medicine studying the use of 

radioisotopes in medical diagnostics and therapy. Finally, an important field of research is 

solid state physics, in which radioisotopes are implanted as probes and act as diagnostic 

tools to deliver information about the environment in which they are implanted. In this way 

these radiotracers are used to study diffusion dynamics, surface, interface and bulk 

properties, spintronics and semiconductors. 11,2 

I.1.3 Production of Radioactive Ion Beams 

RIBs are produced by different techniques where a beam of protons, neutrons, 

electrons, light or heavy ions are brought to collision with a target. 11 Several reactions and 



 
 
 
Effect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes 

 

10 

 

beam target combinations are used to produce the required radioactive isotopes. 17 There 

are 3 major types of such reactions used at CERN-ISOLDE: 

• Spallation - it happens when a proton with high kinetic energy (between hundreds 

of MeV and a few GeV) hits a target. This reaction can be described in a two-step reaction: 

first a particle is made to collide with the nucleus exciting it to a high energy state. In the 

second step, the excited nucleus emits single nucleons to lower its excitation state. This 

reaction is best suited to produce proton-rich isotopes, with a few protons and/or neutrons 

less than the original element. 18 

• Fragmentation - projectile fragmentation reactions are induced by a high-energy 

heavy ion beam with energies above 50 MeV per nucleon. 17 It implicates heavy-ions being 

broken up into lighter elements, on a target. The fragmentation reaction can also happen in 

target nuclei, when high energetic protons hit a heavy target. 18 This reaction produces a 

wide range of nuclei, both neutron and proton-rich, and also light nuclei.  

• Fission - it happens when an incident particle, proton, neutron, electron or 

photons is absorbed by the nucleus. If the incident energy is high enough, two nuclei and a 

number of free nucleons are formed. In “cold fission” (no neutrons or gammas are emitted) 

a big nucleus is split in two other nucleus of smaller mass. 10 One of the produced nuclei 

will have a mass of about ?, and the second of roughly ? of the mass of the original 

element. 13 

• Fusion-evaporation – a 4th reaction, used throughout different ISOL facilities (and 

not at ISOLDE) consists on inducing two nucleus to be brought together overcoming the 

energy of the Coulomb barrier. The resulting nucleus evaporates nucleons. This method 

produces highly excited nuclei in the neutron-rich side of the stability region and super-

heavy elements. 

The nuclear reactions described above are influenced by the nature of the projectile, 

its energy and nature of the target. 17 To meet the demand of ever increasing RIB 

intensities, new accelerators that can deliver higher intensities and target systems to handle 

the power deposition, resulting from the later, are under development. The production of 

unwanted species is often more intense compared to the desired exotic nuclei. For this, 

selectiveness has to be improved to separate the wanted species from the unwanted ones 

(contaminants). By the very definition of exotic nuclei, it is known that they have very 

short half-lives. As the isotopes decay, the production and the transport from the target to 



 
 
 

Chapter I – State of the Art  
 

 

11 

 

the experimental setup has to be fast. The efficiency has also to be promoted by developing 

better ionization, acceleration and transport systems of the isotope beams. 17 

There are two methods to produce RIBs: the in-flight separation technique 19 and 

the isotope separator online (ISOL) technique. Both methods transport the produced nuclei 

out of their production zone, where there is a large radiation background due to nuclear 

reactions, to a well shielded experimental setup. This has two advantages: creating low 

radiation background conditions for the experiment, and to purify and prepare the beam 

with respect to its necessary conditions: energy, time and ion optical properties for the 

following experiments. 17  

The ISOL technique uses production methods in a thick target, thermalization in a 

solid, liquid or gas catcher, which often is the same as the target, as in the case of ISOLDE 

at CERN. The radioactive isotopes are then extracted from the catcher material and ionized 

in an ion source. After being extracted from the ion source the isotopes are mass analyzed 

by a dipole magnet and afterwards post-accelerated to the required energies for use in 

experiments. 17 The beams resulting from this technique are of excellent ion optical quality 

(energy resolution, time structure and emittance) but the thermalization process described 

and the eventual re-acceleration slow down the delivery of isotopes and causes additional 

losses for short lived isotopes. 11 

Besides ISOLDE at CERN, which is a leading ISOL facility, there is also much 

development ongoing on other facilities like: GSI at Germany, LISOL at Belgium, IGISOL 

in Finland, ISAC-TRIUMF in Canada, GANIL in France, IRIS in Russia and JAERI in 

Japan. 17  

The quality of a RIB facility is mainly determined by the intensity and purity of its 

beams. For an ISOL facility the beam intensity can be theoretically described by the 

expression 20: 

 ? = ?. ?. ?. ????. ???. ????. ?????? (I.1)  

where i, is the beam intensity in ions per second per µA of the incident beam, ? is 

the flux of the incident beam in particles per second per µA, n is the number of target 

atoms exposed to the primary beam per unit of area and ? is the cross-section to produce 

the desired isotope (cross section is considered to be the effective size of a nucleus for a 

certain nuclear probabilistic reaction to happen). ?rel is the release efficiency of the target, 

?is is the ion source efficiency and ?sep and ?tranp are the efficiencies of the transmission of

12 

 

the mass separator and of the transmission to the users experimental setup, respectively 

(these last two efficiencies are normally close to unity). The ?rel is directly related to 

diffusion through the target material and effusion through the material porosity to the ion 

source.  It can be greatly improved by developing the target material. By investigating the 

microstructure and the diffusion and effusion of the isotopes on the target material, these 

properties can be vastly improved and in this way, the target release efficiency would be 

increased too, promoting the overall beam intensity, as will be seen later in this work. 

I.2 ISOLDE at CERN 

CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research is the biggest 

experimental laboratory center for fundamental particle physics research. It presently hosts 

the LHC (Large Hadron Collider), the highest energy and largest particle accelerator in 

operation in the world.  CERN was founded in 1954, and it is located across the Franco-

Swiss border area near Geneva and is operated by 21 member states (Portugal being one of 

them). Other non-member states and organizations are also involved in the numerous 

experiments taking place at CERN. CERN is a global example of successful international 

collaboration for scientific interests. CERN’s mission is defined in four levels: (i) 

educating the scientists of tomorrow; (ii) fundamental research; (iii) promoting 

international collaboration and (iv) promoting the transfer of technology. At CERN beams 

of particles are accelerated to high energies and are brought to collide between themselves 

or with targets. By doing this, scientists expect to understand better the fundamental laws 

of nature. 1 

The beams produced at the large accelerator complex at CERN are delivered at 

various energies to numerous experiments. One of such facilities, ISOLDE, has the aim of 

producing beams of radioactive isotopes.  

It was in 1964 that ISOLDE was originally proposed at the 0.6GeV Proton-

Synchro-Cyclotron (SC) at CERN. The first experiments started in 1967 and since then, 

the ISOLDE facility has suffered several upgrades. Since 1989 that ISOLDE is supplied by 

the 1-1.4GeV Proton-Synchrotron Booster (PSB), as Figure I-2 shows. 2 This not only 

provides ISOLDE with more energetic protons but also the proton intensity was increased 

up to 2µA. This, together with different technological developments, increased the 

intensities and the number of accessible isotopes. Right now ISOLDE is the world-leading 



 
 
 

Chapter I – State of the Art  
 

 

13 

 

facility of its type, which can provide more than 1000 isotopes with half-lives down to 

milliseconds out of 73 chemical elements, from Z=2 to 92, with intensities up to 1011 atoms 

per second. 

 
Figure I-2 - CERN accelerator complex. The types of beams (different colors) produced at CERN and their paths, 
can be seen, as well as the main experiments. 1 

I.2.1 Layout of ISOLDE Facility 

The ISOLDE experimental facility, runs between 350 and 400 shifts of 8 hours of 

online operation every year 21. The PSB supplies the ISOLDE facility (Figure I-3) with 

about 30-40% of CERN’s protons. The proton beam can then be redirected by a series of 

focusing and bending magnets to two different front ends, which supply the fixed targets. 

The protons are delivered either in pulse sharing mode, sharing the supercycle between the 

two, or individually. Some targets can have a converter that is used to transform a beam of 

protons into a field of neutrons. With this technology, neutron-rich isotopes with low level 

of contaminants can be obtained from actinide targets. 17 



 
 
 
Effect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes 

 

14 

 

When the high energy primary beam hits the target, spallation, fragmentation and 

fission reactions take place producing radioactive nuclei that are stopped (also called 

thermalization) in the bulk of the target material and then diffuse out of it. The isotopes 

then travel through so-called processes of effusion through the transfer line to the ion 

source, where they are ionized. An extraction electrode accelerates them at a potential up 

to 60 keV, producing the secondary beam. In the ion source, several ionization 

mechanisms are used, but generally singly positively or negatively charged ions are 

produced 17. Usually the target, transfer line, ion-source and, if installed, the neutron 

converter are referred to as the target unit or simply as target 3. 

 
Figure I-3 - Layout of the ISOLDE facility, describing all the steps of the process and zones. 17 

To mass analyze and separate the isotopes each target station, also called frontend, 

is connected to a mass separator magnet: the General Purpose Separator (GPS) or to the 

High Resolution Separator (HRS). The magnets separate the different masses according to 

the Lorentzian magnetic principle 22 and both can feed a common beam distribution system 

which connects to the different experiments in the ISOLDE hall. The GPS has less 

resolution than the HRS, but allows for the separation and use, in parallel, of three beams 



 
 
 

Chapter I – State of the Art  
 

 

15 

 

of different masses to three different experiments at the same time. The separation of 

different masses with HRS can provide the facility with one high resolution beam and is a 

more complex system with 2 magnets with ion-optical systems for corrections. 3  

Some experiments get the beam directly from the mass separators while others need 

the beam to be stopped and cooled to be highly ionized and/or post accelerated. The Radio 

Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) cooler, cools down the ion beam to improve its ion-optical 

properties and bunches the beam. This is done to improve the peak to background ratio that 

is required in some experiments, or to inject the beam into the charge state breeder. The 

charge state breeder is an electron beam ion source (EBIS) that changes the singly charged 

radioactive ions to multiple charged ion state, as required for post acceleration. Finally, the 

highly ionized beam can be accelerated to several MeV per nucleon and sent to 

experimental setups which require high kinetic beam energies 17. 

There is big concern and legal obligation about radiological protection at ISOLDE, 

since there are high amounts of radioactivity that originates from normal operation of the 

targets and by the RIB itself. To comply with the legislation aiming to protect the ISOLDE 

group and its users, who have to use a dosimeter on the ISOLDE experimental hall, the 

strong radioactive target zone is completely separated from the hall. It has dedicated 

ventilation, is separately pumped and is highly shielded with steel, concrete blocks and 8m 

of soil. The targets are manipulated, stored and changed by industrial robots without the 

need for human physical presence. The target zone is also equipped with a class A 

radioactive laboratory to safely and correctly handle any radioactive materials. 3 After the 

irradiation and operation time, the targets are disposed as radioactive waste. 23 

An important part of the ISOLDE infrastructure is made of beam diagnostics, since 

it permits the delivery of good quality RIB to the physics experiments. Part of these 

instruments, are the wire scanners and grids that permit to see the position and the profile 

of the beam, faraday cups that measure the overall intensity of the beam in several 

positions along the beam line, tape stations through which we can measure the release rates 

(yields) and obtain the release curve of radioactive isotopes. There are gamma detectors 

that allow the identification of the produced isotopes through a gamma spectrum. Some of 

these instruments will be described in larger detail later, in the experimental procedure 

chapter (see section II.7).

16 

 

Furthermore, the operation of the entire ISOLDE facility, from the vacuum 

systems, to the beam distribution system and diagnostics, and all target parameters, with 

exception of the experiments, is done in the control room, by several computers and other 

control systems in a user friendly environment. 3 

I.2.2 Target Unit 

The heart of an on-line isotope separator is its target and ion source. The 

performance of these components is an essential part for the delivery of high quality beams 

in a facility like ISOLDE. Yearly, in average, ISOLDE produces 30 target units with 

typical utilization from 24h to 300h with an average of 64h 23. Around 30 different target 

materials, 5 transfer lines and 5 types of ion-sources are available at ISOLDE, making 

nearly 100 different possible combinations, which are chosen depending on the required 

radioactive ion beams. The targets can be either made of solid or liquid materials. 

  
Figure I-4 – Target unit MK7 with VADIS ion source in 3D (a) and cut (b) – courtesy of Stefano Marzari. The 
numbers indicate the target container (1), the transfer line (2) and the ion source (3). The arrow indicates how the 
proton beam is made to collide with the target material, which is inside the target container. 

As can be seen in Figure I-4, the ISOLDE standard target container has a 

cylindrical shape (200mm long, 20mm of diameter) and is made of tantalum, a refractory 

metal, which is then filled with the target material. To enhance the diffusion and effusion 

processes the target container can be heated by ohmic resistance up to 2200oC by providing 

a) b)

17 

 

a current up to 1000A. As referred, a neutron field can be made by redirecting the proton 

beam to hit tantalum or tungsten rods, that are usually below the target (not present in the 

figure), serving as neutron converters. 

The electrical connectors in both ends of the target container are specially designed 

to accommodate the thermal expansion of the target during its operation, reducing the 

mechanical stress on the target unit. The transfer line is the only opening of the target 

container through which the produced isotopes effuse to the ion source. By inserting cold 

parts into the hot transfer line some elements can be actively condensed or selectively 

adsorbed, providing a way to chemically select the reaction products that come out of the 

target.  

Another very important part of the target unit is its ion source. Different ion sources 

can be mounted on the target for the best ionization efficiency, depending on the isotope to 

be ionized and its best ionization mechanism: (i) surface ionization, for elements with low 

ionization potential or high electrical affinity (for negative ion sources); (ii) plasma 

ionization, with a large efficiency but no selectivity; or (iii) resonant laser ionization for 

selective ionization of metallic elements. 24  

I.2.3 ISOLDE Pulse Shape 

As soon as the proton beam hits the target, the isotopes produced through nuclear 

reactions, diffuse out of the material grains and desorb from the surface. Then, the species 

effuse through the porosity of the material (hitting the walls and being possibly adsorbed 

again) to the transfer line and then to the ion source where they are ionized. 25,26 The 

isotope release from the target after proton impact shows a sharp rise and a sudden fall, 

ending with a tail (see Figure I-5). The release can be defined as a probability function, 

p(t), also called release curve or delay curve. To mathematically describe this behavior a 

three exponential function was chosen: 25  

 ?(?) =
1

????
?1 ? ??????. ??????? + (1 ? ?)?????? (I.2)  

where t is the time, and ?r (rise), ?f (fast fall) and ?s (slow fall) are three time-constant: 

 ?? =
ln 2
??

 (I.3)  

? is a weighting factor between the slow and fast fallings components. In order to compare 

the release figures and their time constants, the integral of this function is normalized

18 

 

(Norm) to 1. The fit function of equation (I.2) describes numerically the experimental 

curves, and its time parameters are not easily linked to specific physical phenomena. 

 
Figure I-5 - Theoretical release curve, where final release curve display a fast and a slow component (courtesy of 
Alexander Gottberg). 

The intensity curve is calculated by multiplying equation (I.2) per N0 which 

corresponds to the number of isotopes produced at t=0 (proton impact). The total yield is 

then calculated from the area under release intensity curve normalized to the proton current 

(ions/µC). 25 

To characterize the release characteristics, a useful parameter is the release 

efficiency (?rel). It is defined by the probability (dependent on half-life) that a certain 

isotope has to be released out of the target 27. The release efficiency depends on each 

material, its respective operation temperature and of the target unit geometry. The release 

efficiency is lower for short-lived isotopes and approaches 1 for longer lived ones, since 

during effusion and diffusion delay processes part of what was produced, after the proton 

impact, is lost. The release efficiency is function of the isotope half-life (T1/2) and is 

derived from equation (I.2) by the following relation: 

 ??????1 2? ? = ? ??(?)?
?ln2?1/2

I.3 Target Materials 

For more than 40 years target materials have been developed at ISOLDE searching 

constantly for fast release properties in order to promote the production of exotic nuclei. 9 

Different materials are used as ISOLDE targets either in solid or liquid state. The materials 

in solid state can be shaped as pressed pills, powders, fibers or foils of metals, carbides or 

oxides. The liquid targets are made of metals or salts of low melting points. Details about 

some of these materials can be seen in Table I-1. 
Table I-1- Table with target materials most used at ISOLDE: T m  is the melting point temperature, T max  is the 
maximum operation temperature, p vap  is the vapor pressure, ? is the theoretical density and ? is the target 
thickness. 28

Metals are used in form of foils or powders, creating target densities near one third 

of the bulk density. These forms are used to keep diffusion lengths short. Furthermore, 

diffusion in solid metals is slow for some elements so, often, oxides or carbides are 

preferred where higher temperatures can be applied. Although carbides are very stable, 

they are limited in operation temperatures by their vapor pressures or their level of 

impurities. The advantages and disadvantages of oxides are explained later in this work. 28 

Beyond solid targets, molten targets are also used at ISOLDE. These have a slightly 

different way of operation. They operate with larger pulse structure (3 bunches separated

by 16µs, instead of the normal set of 4 bunches separated by ~90ns) of the primary beam, 

that generate shockwaves in the molten material, promoting the release of the isotopes. 29 

These targets produce RIBs of higher intensities of not too shorted-lived isotopes, due to 

their high densities. 28 

A solid material must fulfill several requirements to be selected as a target material 

for the production of RIBs at CERN-ISOLDE.  The most important requirements and the 

ones that contribute more to the isotope release are the diffusion, effusion and adsorption. 

For ISOL applications the best target microstructure was described before as the 

one having high open porosity (&gt;30%) in the macrosize range (&gt;100nm), nanosized grains, 

and stability at high temperatures. 7 Tortuosity should be minimized, and the pore size 

distribution must be narrow, minimizing the resistance to gaseous flow (effusion). 7,8  

Additionally, the surface area is a very important parameter to control. Nanometric 

scale materials with high surface area are envisaged, since not only diffusion lengths are 

shortened but also the release surface is increased. Nevertheless, a high surface area 

nanometric material will sinter at lower temperatures. Therefore, the temperature effect 

over time on the microstructure has to be well known (e.g. through sintering kinetics) in 

order to operate the target with temperatures high enough to promote diffusion and 

effusion phenomena but not degrade the microstructure of the material. 

The production method of the target material defines the target final properties: 

different methods lead to different microstructures and different material properties.  

In this section the most important properties will be described as well as their 

relation to the release process. 

I.3.1 Diffusion 

As diffusion remains one of the most important and most limiting factors involved 

in release properties from an ISOLDE target, it will be further detailed. 

Fick’s first law (in one dimension) is the simplest way of describing diffusion, for 

steady concentration conditions of the diffusing species: 30 

 ?? = ??
??
??

 (I.7)  

where Jx is the flux of the diffusing species, dC/dx is the concentration gradient and D is 

the diffusion coefficient. When concentration varies with time Fick’s second law (also in 

one dimension) applies instead: 30

 (I.8)  

These laws can be used to determine the diffusion coefficient of a diffusing element 

in a host lattice from experimental data. To this end, a usual technique consists in the 

implantation of a radioactive isotope in a sample. Then, by heating at fixed temperatures 

for different delays, the diffusion coefficients can be determined as well as the diffusion 

pre-exponential factor (D0) and the activation energy (Q). 

I.3.1.1 Main Diffusion Mechanisms 

The mechanisms of diffusion are the paths that the atoms preferably move in the 

crystal lattice. These are mainly influenced by the types of defects present in the material 

crystal lattice. The three principal mechanisms are: lattice diffusion (or volume or bulk 

diffusion), grain boundary diffusion, and surface diffusion. 30 

Lattice diffusion can occur either from a vacancy or by interstitial mechanism. 

Other mechanisms like interstitialcy and direct exchange (or ring mechanism) can also 

happen. Vacancies are part of the equilibrium point defects so they are always present in 

the material 31. Their movement is in the opposite direction and the motion equivalent to 

that of the atom. The concentration of vacancies is determined by the temperature, solute 

and atmosphere. Another important mechanism is defined by atoms small enough to travel 

in the interstitial sites of the crystal lattice, which are said to move through the interstitial 

mechanism. Less important, interstitialcy mechanism happens when the distortion of the 

lattice is too large for the interstitial diffusion to happen. So a neighboring atom exchanges 

position with a lattice atom. The later, direct exchange or ring mechanism is defined by 

rotation of a group of atoms without participation of a defect. 30 

The grain boundaries of polycrystalline material are highly defective zones by 

nature. Because of that, grain boundaries are often zones of faster diffusion. This type of 

diffusion is dependent on the grain size, since higher grain sizes have reduced grain 

boundaries areas. 30 

Surface diffusion happens because the free surface of a solid is a perturbed region 

where kinks, edges, terraces and also vacancies and adatoms are formed. The migration of 

those last two is what provides the main mechanism of surface diffusion. 30

I.3.1.2 Factors Influencing Diffusion 

The diffusion coefficient depends greatly on the diffusing species, their 

concentration and the host material 31,32 and consequently on the diffusion mechanism 31.  

The temperature has a large influence on the diffusion coefficients and diffusion 

rates. The diffusion coefficient varies with the temperature following an Arrhenius 

equation: 32 

 ? = ?0?????
?
??

? (I.9)  

where D0 is the temperature independent pre-exponential factor, Q is the activation energy 

for the diffusion (both dependent on the host material and diffusion species), R is the 

universal gas constant and T is the absolute temperature. 

The type of the crystal phase (or lattice) of the host material is important in terms of 

atomic packing factor. For example, a face-centered cubic crystalline system has an atomic 

packing factor higher (0.74) than the body-centered one (0.68) so, typically, for the same 

host and diffusion species the diffusion coefficient is higher in the case of the later, 

because the atoms can move more freely. 31 

Diffusion is also influenced by defects present in the material crystal lattice. These 

defects influence transport phenomena, affecting for instance the rates sintering. 33 Proton 

irradiation is known to induce defects on the crystal structure such as voids, flaws and 

point defects, and this may affect the release processes by promoting diffusion 34. Since at 

ISOLDE the proton beam is pulsed, this will induce high temperature spikes due to the 

deposited energy. These high temperatures, together with the temperature set in the target 

container, promote the annealing and sintering of the material. Therefore the best 

conditions in terms of temperature and proton intensity are those for which the 

microstructure is stable, defining the release properties achieved in operation over time. 

Only a post irradiation study would reveal the precise influence of all of these factors on 

the material microstructure 34. 

I.3.1.3 Diffusion and ISOLDE Release Curve 

Analyzing the ISOLDE release curve it is possible to obtain meaningful physical 

parameters about the release characteristics of the target material and also about the 

surrounding geometric components of the target. Effusion and diffusion time constants can 

be obtained through the release curve by using a model first proposed by R. Kirchner 27.

This model defines the probability of a given isotope to diffuse out of the material grains 

and effuse through the material porosity and to the ion source. 

The effusion delay function, pv(t), can be defined analogously to the evacuation of 

a certain volume through an opening, which can be described by an exponential function 27: 

 ??(?) = ????? (I.10)  

where v is an effusion delay parameter. The diffusion delay function, pµ(t), was derived 

from Fick’s Law for infinite foils of thickness d:

 (I.11)  

where µ is the diffusion delay parameter, which can be related to a diffusion coefficient 

(D):

 (I.12)  

By a convolution of effusion and diffusion (equations (I.10) and (I.11)) the 

following equation, for the geometry of infinite foils, is obtained 27:

 (I.13)  

E. Bouquerel et al. 35 developed a more accurate equation for effusion delay 

function in an ISOLDE target unit by adding a second exponential function, to account for 

effusion of atoms from the target container to the ion source through a transfer line:  

 ??1,?2(?) =

????
(1 ? ???2?)???1? (I.14)  

where v1 and v2 are effusion time parameters. By convoluting equation (I.14) with (I.11), 

the following equation for effusion and diffusion was obtained:

 (I.17)  

A equation similar to the one obtained by E. Bouquerel et al. (equation (I.15)) can 

be derived for spherical particles by convoluting equations (I.14) and (I.16):

 (I.18)  

The release efficiency, ?rel, can also be related to physical phenomena like effusion 

and diffusion by the following equation, which was derived from the equation (I.18) 

similarly to the deduction of equation (I.5) 35,37: 

 
??????1 2? ? =

3?(?1 + ?2)?2 ???
??
? coth ???

??
?? ? 1?

???(?? + ?2)(?? + ?1 + ?2)
 

(I.19)  

where ?i is defined on equation (I.6). 

The delay parameters of diffusion and effusion, v1, v2, µ  can be deduced from the 

parameters in equation (I.18) or (I.19) by a fit to the experimental release curves. 

Determining µ and knowing the particle radius, one can extract the diffusion coefficient, 

D, through equation (I.17) and D0 and Q values from equation (I.9) if measured for 

different temperatures. 

The release efficiency can also be simply taken from the ratio between the yield 

observed experimentally (Yobs) and the in target production yield (Y prod), that would be 

obtained if the isotopes wouldn’t decay over time. Yprod , which is only mass dependent, 

can be obtained through simulations with programs like ABRABLA 38,39. So, ?rel can be 

obtained through the equation: 

 ???? =
????

????????
 (I.20)  

where ?is is the ion source efficiency. From this using the release efficiency equation, 

deduced similarly to equation (I.5), from equation (I.16), just for diffusion, µ can be known 

27: 

 ???? =
 3????2/? × tanh???2/? ? 1?

??2/?
 (I.21)  

This method is less accurate and underestimates µ since losses due to effusion are 

neglected.

25 

 

Attempts to calculate the diffusion parameters and constants and/or activation 

energies from the detailed models have been successful in various works 27,35,36,40,41. 

I.3.2  Effusion 

After the isotope diffuses out of the target, effusion processes are responsible for 

transporting the isotope of interest to the ion source. Effusion can be defined as the 

molecular dynamics where a gas molecule doesn’t hit another gas molecule. Effusion is 

mostly dependent on the temperature and on the target surface physico-chemical 

properties.   

The effusion step is also dependent on the following parameters 27: (i) the average 

number of collisions of the isotope with the surface of the target or the surrounding 

materials until it is ionized; (ii) the average sticking time in each wall collision, which is 

mainly  dependent on the temperature and on the adsorption enthalpy of the target material 

or surrounding materials; (iii) and also the average flight time between each wall collision. 

The defined parameters are very dependent on the type of materials that are chosen 

for the target unit. Furthermore, by increasing the temperature and reducing the total 

volume of the target the effusion speed is enhanced 7.  

I.3.3 Other Important Material Requirements 

Besides fast diffusion and effusion, other important characteristics for a target 

material must be considered and they are as S. Fernandes 7 described: high production 

cross section, high operational temperature, high resistance to radiation damage, high 

thermal conductivity and high resistance to fatigue, creep, thermal shock and corrosion. 

A high isotope production cross section is related to the target material, the primary 

beam energy and is the probabilistic event of a certain nuclear reaction to occur. The 

amount of material exposed to the beam can be increased, increasing the production rate. 5 

One of the most important properties is the refractory characteristics of the 

material. A high operational temperature is required to reduce the time constants of the 

diffusion and effusion, and usually, the target temperature is set a few hundred degrees 

below the material melting point 4. The maximum temperature is constrained by the 

evaporation of the target material and/or its impurities, degradation and sintering effects. 

The temperature is also limited by the vapor pressure of the material, which has to be 



 
 
 
Effect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes 

 

26 

 

compatible with the ion source (less than 10-2 Pa), from which the ion source efficiency 

starts to fall 4. 

Due to exposition of the target to high levels of radiation, high resistance to 

radiation damage of the material is needed. Radiation can induce changes in the physico-

chemical characteristics (atomic, microstructural and electric, thermo-mechanical 

properties). These effects are dependent on the type, energy and the dose of particles which 

irradiates the material, its impurities, the surrounding atmosphere and temperature. Target 

deterioration by radiation is not a simple time effect. It mainly depends on the intensity of 

the beam, but on the bunch characteristics, which is deleterious for the target 20. 

Both target material and target container must have a high thermal conductivity and 

high emissivity. When the primary beam pulse collides with the target, some fraction of 

energy is deposited in the target and in the target container, generating loads of high 

temperature in the target. Efficient cooling systems and good thermal conductance between 

the target and the container are needed for preserving the mechanical integrity of the target 

and also its microstructure. 5 

High resistance to fatigue, creep, thermal shock and corrosion is needed since the 

target is subjected to thermal gradients induced by the pulsed proton irradiation and ohmic 

resistance heating, thus requiring a high fatigue resistance. Fracture failure of the target can 

be induced by creep and corrosion in the target material. 

I.4 Calcium Oxide Nanopowders 

Since the early days of ISOLDE that ceramic powders or loose compacts have been 

used as target materials; firstly hydroxides (1970) 42, then oxides and carbides (1975) and 

later borides (1986) 43, since higher target temperatures could be reached. 

Calcium oxide (CaO) has been used at ISOLDE for a long time, providing good 

yields of argon isotopes. Around 1 to 2 CaO targets are produced every year, representing 

3.3% of the total ISOLDE RIB time – data from the last 5 years 44. 

Alkaline earth materials are known for the production of good yields of noble gas 

isotopes through spallation nuclear reactions. 42 Calcium oxide is too corrosive to be used 

as a target material at high temperature directly in a tantalum (Ta) container, so it’s 

covered, therefore protected, by a rhenium (Re) foil 43. Submitted at high temperatures 

(&gt;1050oC), it gives fast release of some of the elements. Proton induced reactions of 



 
 
 

Chapter I – State of the Art

spallation and fragmentation mainly produce the isotopes as showed from the ABRABLA 

simulation plot of Figure I-6 a). 

This target is operated with a Versatile Arc Discharge Ion Source (VADIS) plasma 

ion source which is especially designed for the production of noble gas RIBs, when 

coupled via a cold transfer line (cooled by water) in order to trap condensable elements and 

improve the chemical selectivity 43. The yields provided by the different CaO target units 

can vary by more than one order of magnitude, only the best historical values at ISOLDE 

are shown in Figure I-6 b). 

 

 
Figure I-6 – (a) Simulation of the ISOLDE in-target isotope production yields for calcium oxide material with a 
thickness of 7g/cm2 done with ABRABLA. (b) Best historical experimental yields obtained by the CaO target 
material at ISOLDE. The filled marks were measured at the actual ISOLDE installations (PSB), the unfilled 
marks were measured in the old ISOLDE installation near the SC. 45 

At ISOLDE, as referred in the Introduction, CaO targets outperform other target 

material to produce similar beams but the material degrades in operation, either showing 

low yields from the beginning or a decrease over time. This effect is believed to be either 

due to sintering effects on the material due to high operation temperatures, to the proton 

pulses, or both.

Since CaO, as a target material, has never been characterized at ISOLDE, and the 

reduction of the grain size of other materials has been proved to enhance their release 

properties 8,7, the state of the art of calcium oxide nanopowders in terms of its production, 

reactivity in air and thermal behavior, is presented in the following sections, in order to 

provide a background for this study. 

I.4.1 General Characteristics

The calcium oxide (CaO) also called lime, calcia, quicklime or unslaked lime, has 

many uses in the current industrial world such as in mortars and cements, in the 

manufacturing of steel, plastic and glass, in food processing such as sugar refining, in 

disinfecting and disease control, in many chemical processes, as an absorbent, in water 

treatment, air pollution control as in flue-gas desulfuration and in agriculture for soil 

conditioning. 49,46  

Nanocrystalline CaO is also used, since its large specific surface and high 

interfacial energies have superior material properties required to improve the performance 

in many applications, especially in applications as catalysts, sensors and oxide dispersion 

strengthened alloys. 50  

CaO, as powder, is also very interesting as a target for proton irradiation for isotope 

production through the ISOL method, as referred before.

I.4.2 Calcination 

The production of CaO through the decomposition of calcium carbonate (CaCO3, 

calcite) has been object of study for the past 100 years 51. The chemical decomposition 

reactions are within the most common solid state reactions. A different solid gas phases are 

produced by heating up another solid, producing simple oxides from carbonates, 

hydroxides, nitrates, sulphates and other metal salts. 30 The calcination, lately generalized 

to the chemical reaction between solids or decomposition of solids through heating, is the 

decomposition of the calcium carbonate, by supplying heat, into calcium oxide (CaO) and 

carbon dioxide (CO2): 

 ????3 ? ??? + ??2 (I.22)  

By having a look into the reaction thermodynamics, in Eq. (I.22), it is known that 

the reaction is strongly endothermic, because the calculated standard enthalpy of the 

reaction is high and positive, ?Ho R=42.6kcal/mol 52. From the calculation of the Gibbs free 

energy change from the reaction, the temperature at which the CaCO3 begins to become 

unstable can be known. Equivalent information can be taken from data of the partial 

pressure of the gaseous product – CO2 (???2).  

 
Figure I-7 - Standard free energy of a reaction in function of the temperature. The dashed lines represent the 
equilibrium of the gas pressure above the reactions. 30 



 
 
 
Effect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes 

 

30 

 

A graphic representation of the variation of the Gibbs free energy with temperature 

and the equilibrium gas pressure can be seen in Figure I-7. This figure is a very important 

theoretical asset for this work since from it, one can assess the theoretical temperature at 

which the CaCO3 starts to decompose at a specific partial pressure of CO2. This can be 

done by drawing a vertical line which intercepts the point where the CaCO3 reaction line 

meets the dashed line of the determined ???2. It can be seen that, for the decomposition in 

air, the reaction starts at ~800oC, whereas for reduced CO2 pressures, lower temperatures 

are required. For instances, when ???2=10
-7atm (10-2 Pa) the reaction is shifted to ~610oC.  

To achieve the desired properties and a high quality oxide product, a precise control 

of the CaCO3 thermal decomposition is necessary.  The characteristics of the precursor, 

such as the particle size, porosity, purity, calcination temperature, holding time and CO2 

pressure all influence the final characteristics of the synthetized CaO. 49 An understanding 

of these factors along with their influence on the kinetics of the reaction is, therefore, 

important and has been undertaken in various works which will be reviewed here. 

 
Figure I-8 - Representation of the CaCO3  decomposition and the formation of the porous layer of CaO.

 30 

In this heterogeneous reaction, as the molar volume of the solid reaction product 

(CaO) is less than the one of the reactant (CaCO3), the product forms a porous layer 

around the nonporous reactant core, which interface moves inward 30. This is also called 

the calcination shrinking core model, illustrated in Figure I-8 53. The kinetics of the 

reaction can be either controlled by the reaction at the interface between the CaO and the 

CaCO3, by heat transfer to the reaction or gas diffusion (or permeation) from the reaction 

surface through the porous product layer 30. 

The difference between the molar volumes indicates that the CaO should have a 

porosity around ~55% for the CaO produced from CaCO3 and around 50% for the one 

produced from Ca(OH)2, but slightly lower porosities (~15% less) in both cases were

obtained by D. Beruto et al. 54. This means that the calcite particle aggregates must 

experience some shrinkage due to sintering effects during the decomposition step 55. This 

can either be due to sintering of CaCO3 before or of CaCO3/CaO during the 

decomposition, or both 56,57. 

Through the last decades an effort has been made to understand the kinetics, 

mechanism, and the rate limiting step of the decomposition reactions under different 

conditions to create adequate kinetic models. However, no agreement among authors has 

been reached, specifically in the case of the decomposition reactions to obtain CaO, which 

is by far the most studied one. 49,58 Studies on the decomposition of CaCO3 and Ca(OH)2 

powders or large single crystals in some various atmospheres, have been made, as 

summarized in the Table I-3. 

The kinetics of the CaCO3 decomposition follows a linear law accordingly to the 

geometrical model of the contracting thickness: 30

where w is the weight loss, kr is the rate constant and t is the time. This relation is verified 

experimentally in several works 49,51,58-61. 49,51,58,59,60,61 

I.4.2.1 Effect of the Atmosphere and Temperature 

In 1958, D. Glasson 56 first reported that CaO produced through decomposition of 

micrometric CaCO3 powders in vacuum yielded higher surface areas than in air. It is by 

creating non-equilibrium conditions that the reaction of the equation (I.22) is shifted to the 

right hand side promoting the fast nucleation of CaO 57 and thus the formation of very 

small crystallites. Several other studies, resumed in Table I-3, report the obtainment of 

nanocrystalline CaO and decomposition reactions happening at much lower temperatures 

than the decomposition in air. For example, D. Beruto et al. 54 reported complete 

decomposition of CaCO3 micrometric powder (3 to 10 µm) at only 510oC under 7x10-4 Pa 

(7x10-9 atm), to give 15 nm crystallites of CaO with 78 m2/g of specific surface area. This 

is coherent with Figure I-7, where thermodynamically, for ???2=10
-8 atm) the reaction 

happens at less than 600oC. Furthermore, E. Powell and A. Searcy 61 report decreasing 

surface areas for increasing temperatures of decomposition. 

In most of the studies, the obtained CaO crystallites are too small to be analyzed by 

SEM and the characterization of CaO powders for Transmission Electron Microscopy

(TEM) is difficult mostly due to the powder instability in air atmosphere 61. K. Towe 64, A. 

Singh et al. 50 and C. Rodriguez-Navarro et al. 49, could analyze the nanostructured CaO by 

decomposing CaCO3 in situ in a Transmission Electron Microscope, with the electron 

beam under vacuum. The type of used energy to decompose the CaCO3 (electron 

irradiation or heat) was reported to have not a significant influence on the decomposition 

mechanism. 49 K. Towe 64 and C. Rodrigez-Navarro et al. 49 observed rod-shaped 

nanocrystallites with preferred orientations, produced from large calcite single crystals, 

with dimensions of about 10x100 nm and 5-10x25-75 nm, respectively. The later could 

also determine the pore size, from 5 to 10 nm. A. Singh et al. 50, instead of using large 

calcite crystals, as in the previous studies, used a calcite micrometric powder and observed 

plate-like nanocrystals of calcia with 5-10 nm and preferred orientations.

CaCO3 by means of decreasing the surface areas, increasing the crystallinity of CaO 

produced, with the increase of ???2 (for values, see Table I-3). He also reported that 

sintering happened already at 650oC, for 1200Pa of CO2 pressure, and the resulting CaO 

particles showed coalescence, dimpling and rounding. The effect of CO2 in sintering will 

be better detailed ahead. 

Decomposition of CaCO3 under N2 atmospheres showed microstructures and 

morphologies identical to those observed in air decomposition. These microstructures 

showed rounded grains and coalescence between them. This was observed by J. Ewing, D. 

Beruto 63, M. Maciejewski and R. Oswald 57. The former attributes this result to the partial 

increase of the CO2 pressure in the decomposition atmosphere up to values comparable to 

those attained in air decomposition. 

I.4.2.2 Influence of the Precursor 

Calcium oxide has been obtained by decomposition of micrometric powders of 

Ca(OH)2 and CaCO3 in vacuum by D. Glasson 56 and D. Beruto et al. 54 They both report 

higher surface areas in the case of decomposition of Ca(OH)2 comparing with the 

decomposition of CaCO3. Furthermore, D. Beruto et al. 54 reported that the reaction is 

pseudomorphous for the decomposition of both precursors. This author obtained calcia 

particles with different porosities for different precursors (higher in case of decomposition 

from CaCO3, because the molar volume of water is less that the molar volume of CO2. 

In other study done by D. Beruto and A. Searcy 60 the morphology of the obtained 

calcia particles from calcite large single crystals as precursors, was studied. Two 

microstructures were reported to be present in the obtained CaO crystals: an inner layer of 

about 10 to 50 µm, made of rods typically separated from their neighbors by very small 

pores, and an outer layer where the rods are typically collapsed into bundles of ~1 µm 

cross section separated by ~1 µm pores. This indicates that the outer layer, which is an 

open structure of the inner unbundled rods, is mechanically unstable and that strains can be 

induced in it. It is thought that this strain is due to the low mobility of the CaO species in 

the reaction interface. 58 The transition between the two layers lead to changes in the pore 

size and distribution as suggested by E. Powel and A. Searcy 61 and later proved by D. 

Beruto 62:  the transition happens, when the intermediate layer has more than ~10 µm, by 

difusionless repacking into bundles, reducing the surface area and creating a duplex pore 



 
 
 
Effect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes 

 

34 

 

structure, with the larger pores being in the micrometric range. A consequence of this type 

of structure, with bimodal pore-size distribution, is that by heating, coarsening with very 

little shrinkage is observed, with decrease in the mesopore* volume being balanced by 

increase in the macropore* volume 65. 

In the case of decomposition of micrometric calcite particles, no macropores are 

observed in CaO. This proves that re-packing into bundles is size dependent. The strain 

accumulates on the calcite-CaO rod interfaces, but when the stress exceeds a critical value 

the mechanical stability of the CaO aggregate is broken. The formation of macropores is 

thought to relieve the stresses. The CaO produced from small calcite particles does not 

reach this critical level of stress. 58 

I.4.3 Reactivity in Air 

Calcium oxide produced from powders or single crystals in vacuum is very reactive 

and hydrates very fast compared to the ones produced in air. 66 This very high reactivity is 

due to their higher surface areas because of high porosity and low crystallite size. There is 

also evidence that this product (the formed hydrate) is nanocrystalline and forms 

instantaneously when high reactive CaO is exposed to air. 51 

There are three possible reactions (I.24),(I.25) and (I.26), that can happen when 

CaO is exposed to air: 

 ??? + ?2? ? ??(??)2 (I.24)  

 ??? + ??2 ? ????3 (I.25)  

 ??(??)2 + ??2 ? ????3 + ?2? (I.26)  

Which reaction happens will be decided not only by thermodynamics but also by 

kinetic factors. The calculated standard free energy for the reactions (?Go R) in equations 

(I.24), (I.25) and (I.26) are respectively -15.8 kcal mol-1, -31.2 kcal mol-1 and -15.4 kcal 

mol-1. 52 These values show that the reaction is spontaneous in all the cases (the more 

negative the more spontaneous). The calculated standard enthalpy of the reactions (?Ho R) 

in equations (I.24), (I.25) and (I.26), are respectively -26.8 kcal mol-1, -42.6 kcal mol-1 and 

-15.9 kcal mol-1, showing that all the reactions are exothermic 52. 

                                                 
* Accordingly to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the pore size is 

defined in three categories: micropores have less than 2nm, mesopores have between 2 and 50nm and 
macropores have more than 50nm. 62

Hydration studies in CaO shows that this step leads to loss of specific surface area 

and increase in particle size, due to agglomeration 56 and to an increase of volume almost to 

double, creating internal strains in the material 67. The roughness is reported to increase 

with the time of exposure to moisture 68. A study reports that just by quick transferring a 

high surface area CaO (78 m2/g) from the decomposition furnace to a thermogravimetry 

apparatus, caused sample hydration to an extent of 15 to 18% 54. The hydration resistance 

of CaO sintered samples is reported to be enhanced with the sintering temperature. 69 

While the hydration is reported to almost double the volume, the carbonation is 

reported to only increase the later by 12%. The number of crystallites formed by 

carbonation is lower than by hydration. 70 The carbonation proceeds to the interior of the 

particle by an advancing interface. The newly formed CaCO3, starts to inhibit the progress 

of the reaction because of its very low porosity which implies a large loss of surface area. 
71 This finding has been studied in order to improve the hydration resistance of CaO by 

forming a layer of the carbonated product. 72  

With the increasing interest for the greenhouse effect over the last years, there has 

been several studies defending the use of calcium oxide for high temperature CO2 

sequestration and its performance after several cycles of decomposition and carbonation.  

I.4.4 Sintering of Calcium Oxide 

Sintering is a processing technique which is used to produce density controlled 

materials and components from ceramics or/and metal powders by applying thermal 

energy. It is a process that is influenced by the powder and compact characteristics 

(impurities, morphology, particle size distribution, agglomeration, green density, etc.) and 

by the sintering conditions (heating and cooling rates, maximum temperature, holding 

time, pressure, atmosphere, etc.). 33 The solid state sintering comprises three main phases: 

(i) the initial stage, which is characterized by rapid inter-particle neck growth and 

corresponds to shrinking values up to 3%, (ii) the intermediate stage which goes until 90-

95% of the theoretical density and is characterized by continuous pore phase at an 

equilibrium of their shape, and (iii) the final stage for densities higher than 95% and the 

goal is to remove all porosity ending most of the times as isolated pores. 30 

The mechanisms of sintering in polycrystalline ceramics are the paths through 

which transport of matter happens. This happens from regions which have higher chemical

potentials towards regions with lower chemical potentials. 30 At least 6 mechanisms of 

sintering exist in solid state sintering and they are illustrated in the Figure I-9. 

 
Figure I-9 - Mechanisms of solid state sintering. Only 4 to 6 cause densification, but all cause neck growth 
influencing densification. 30 

The specific surface area is a much sensitive parameter in the evaluation of 

sintering and can be used for studying the kinetics of the initial sintering. The following 

equation was proposed in a model developed by R. German and A. Munir 73 for the surface 

area reduction in the initial stage sintering, under isothermal conditions:

? ???

 (I.28)  

being k0 a constant term of a given material, Q the activation energy, R the gas constant, T 

the temperature, r the particle radius, and m the Herring scaling exponent. This kinetic 

model is also called the German and Munir model. It is only valid for ?S/S0&lt;0.5, until 

necks start to touch each other, marking the end of the initial stage sintering.  There are 

also other assumptions like dense and spherical monosized particles. 

Shrinkage is another kinetic parameter for the first stage of sintering and the 

following equation was derived, under isothermal conditions 33:

transport terms. 

The theoretical values of ? are shown in the Table I-4, for different particle 

coordination numbers, related with the particle packing, and for different sintering 

mechanisms. Theoretical values of the exponent s can also be seen in the same table.

The sintering of calcium oxide powders having high specific surface areas was 

investigated taking as variables the oxide precursors 74,75,69, either the carbonate or the 

hydroxide and the sintering atmospheres: air 75,69, N2 74, H2O and CO2 76 . 
W. De Keyser et al. 75 studied CaO sintering in air atmosphere, reporting much 

higher sintering speeds of CaO produced from Ca(OH)2, CH, than from CaCO3, CC, both 

calcined at 1000oC (CH precursor was 0.45 µm and CC was 2.7 µm particle size powders). 

Main shrinkage is observed in both cases after 1100ºC, and for the CaO produced from 

Ca(OH)2 shrinkage is much higher than the one produced from CaCO3 case. It is 

suggested that the production of CaO from the hydroxide introduces in the CaO lattice a 

large number of excess vacancies. These vacancies enhance the mater transport during the 

sintering process. 

R. Borgwardt 74 investigated the sintering of high surface area CaO powders 

produced from CaCO3 (S=104 m2/g) and Ca(OH)2 (S=76.7 m2/g) in a flowing N2 

atmosphere. The reduction SSA was followed between 700oC and 1100oC and the kinetic 

analysis, using the German and Munir model 73, was applied. The calculated average ? 

exponent value of 2.7, agreeing with lattice diffusion as sintering controlling mechanism. 

The CH, also showed in this study, a much faster sintering rate than CC which was 



 
 
 
Effect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes 

 

38 

 

attributed to its lower porosity, leading to a denser compact with more contact points 

between the particles. Finally, by decomposing CaCO3 pure and with impurities he 

observed a higher sintering rate for the latter, which was explained by the effect of 

impurities creating lattice defects and therefore, accelerating solid-state diffusion 

processes. 

R. Borgwardt 76 also studied the influence of presence of H2O and CO2 in the 

sintering atmosphere of the same CaO powders used in the previous study 74, from 350oC 

to 1150oC, and partials pressures up to 1.5x103 Pa of H2O and up to 1.2x103 Pa of CO2. 

Both types of gas are reported to strongly catalyze the sintering process and, furthermore, 

their effects are additive. The kinetic analysis taking the German and Munir model 73 

couldn’t identify the mechanism, since the values of ? exponent increased by increasing 

H2O or CO2 pressure and the values are higher than the theoretical ones, in Table I-4. 

Other mechanisms, than lattice diffusion may be operating and it was proposed that the 

presence of CO2 and H2O on free surfaces and interfaces activates the surface and grain 

boundary transport.  

D. Beruto et al. 65 studied the influence of the CO2 pressure in the sintering of CaO 

with ~120 m2/g. He observed that a CO2 pressure around 1330 Pa greatly increases the 

sintering of CaO at a low temperature of 686oC which is in accord with the activating 

effect of CO2 in the matter transport for sintering also reported by R. Borgwart 76. The 

surface area reached more than 50% of reduction after 10h, at this temperature.

II.1 Characterization Techniques 

The different techniques and experiments used for material characterization, both in 

University of Aveiro and CERN will be shortly described in this section.  

II.1.1 X-Ray Diffraction - XRD 

X-Ray diffraction was a very useful technique in this work, enabling a qualitative 

analysis of the crystalline phases in the powder and pre-sintered samples. The 

determination of the crystallite size was done using this technique. 

By exposing a crystalline sample to a X-ray beam, some of those X-rays are 

diffracted according to a certain angle (2?) matching characteristic crystallographic 

directions of the material as given by the Bragg’s Law 31. This diffracted X-rays are 

detected, generally, by a moving counter in a goniometer, giving origin to more counts at 

the certain angles, producing peaks in a plot of counts per second versus the diffraction 

angle (2?). 

At the University of Aveiro, the equipment used was a Rigaku® D/Max-B with an 

X-ray source (?CuK?=1.54056Å), in which a potential of 40kV and a current of 30mA is 

applied. Another similar equipment, at CERN, Siemens D-5000 Diffractometer, was used. 

The tests were done by grinding, when needed, the samples to powder in an agate mortar. 

The sweeping angles used were from 10o2? to 80o2? and a step of 0.02 o2?, with a speed of 

3o2?/s was used. This equipment is connected to a computer which records the results and 

helps in the phase identification through the X-ray diffraction peaks. For this, in the case of 

the Rigaku® D/Max-B, a software named Jade (version 9.3.4 – 05-02-2011) was used 

which has an integrated database of Powder Diffraction Files (PDF) from the International 

Center of Data Diffraction (ICDD). For the Siemens D-5000 Diffractometer a software 

named TOPAS P v2.0 was used.  

Through the broadening of the X-ray diffraction peaks, crystallite sizes of less than 

~0.1µm can be conveniently measured. 30 The crystallite size is given by the Scherer 

equation: 77 

 ? =
??

? cos ?
 (II.1)  

where ? is the breadth usually expressed as the full width at half maximum (FWHM), ? is 

the diffraction angle, ? is the wavelength of the X-rays, G is the crystal size and K is a 



 
 
 
Effect of Calcium Oxide Microstructure on the Diffusion of Isotopes 

 

42 

 

constant to account for particle shapes (close to unity, usually 0.9). The broadening is also 

affected by instrumental factors. Such factors have to be subtracted to correctly calculate 

the crystallite size. To measure the instrumental broadening a macrocrystalline material in 

which the broadening is negligible can be used. 77 In this case, the instrumental broadening 

was determined with a macrocrystalline lanthanum hexaboride (LaB6). 

To measure the FWHM a mathematical treatment has to be done to the 

diffractograms peaks. There are 4 empirical peak shape functions: Gauss, Lorentz, Pseudo-

Voigt which is a convolution from the last two and Pearson-VII. The latter two are the 

most used, 78 and accordingly the mathematical treatment was done using the software 

Jade or TOPAS with the Pearson-VII to do the fitting. The peaks were considered to be 

symmetric and to subtract the background a 4th order polynomial function was chosen.  

II.1.2 Surface Area and Porosity Measurements through Isotherm 
Determination – BET/BJH 

Adsorption measurement based on the Brunauner, Emmet and Teller (BET) 

isotherm is a method commonly used to determine the specific surface area (SSA) of a 

powder or porous material. 79  

This measurement is done at 77K in which N2 adsorption, the most common gas 

used in BET, is easier to measure.  By putting a solid of a known mass in contact with a 

known volume of gas, it adsorbs creating a decrease in the pressure, from which the 

amount of adsorbed gas can be calculated. From this measurements a plot of the amount of 

gas adsorbed versus the relative pressure (p/p0, p0 being the saturation vapor pressure of 

the adsorption gas used) is represented, which is called the adsorption isotherm. The BET 

equation that can be applied to the isotherm curve, which is only valid for lower values of 

p/p0 (usually between 0.05 and 0.3) and is used in this form: 79

 (II.2)  

where V is the volume of gas adsorbed, Vm is the monolayer volume and C is a constant.  

By this procedure the Vm can be calculated (from the slope and the intercept) and applied 

in equation (II.3) to calculate the surface area: 79 

 ? =

where the S is the surface area, NA is the Avogadro number, ? is the area of an adsorbed 

gas molecule and V0 is the volume of 1mol of gas at STP (Standard Temperature and 

Pressure). 

The average particle size (GBET) of a powder can also be known, assuming a certain 

particle shape, and dense and unagglomerated particles, by the following equation: 80 

 ???? =
?

? × ??
 (II.4)  

where ds is the theoretical density of the solid material and f is a particle shape factor 

defined in Table II-1.

Cube 7.4 0.72 
Parallelepiped (1:4:4) 9.4 0.68 
Flake (1:10) 24 0.55 

 

The very initial part of an isotherm and its end may also give information about the 

material porosity. There are 6 different main types of the isotherms accordingly to 

Brunauer, Emmet and Teller. 30 The different isotherms represent different properties of a 

material, also the different type of hysteresis on adsorption and desorption measurements 

reveals much about the type of porosity. From the isotherms the pore size distribution 

(PSD), pore volume and pore area can be obtained, using either the nonlinear high p/p0 

zone of the isothermal or the low one, through methods such as the t-plot (for 

microporosity area) and the Barret-Joyner-Halenda method (BJH) for the PSD, pore 

volume and pore area. For further reading refer to the bibliography. 81,79 

The equipment used was a Micromeritics® – Gemini 2370 V5, in the University of 

Aveiro, and a Quantachrome® eNOVA2200, at CERN, which both use N2 as the 

adsorption gas and liquid N2 to cool down the samples. 

Before every test the samples were degased at 200oC for 4-6h in flowing nitrogen.

II.1.3 Differential Thermal and Thermogravimetric Analysis – DTA/TGA 

Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) is a technique that permits to know the 

thermal behavior of a material and the transformations it goes through.  

This is done by heating up the material, registering the temperature difference 

against an inert material (reference, normally pure alumina), which is being heated 

simultaneously. The temperature difference (in ?V) is then plotted against the temperature 

of the furnace and positive differences between them indicating exothermal 

transformations or negative ones, endothermic transformations. 

It’s usual in this kind of tests to record the weight variation during DTA test, which  

technique is called thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). This provides additional 

information about the transformation that is occurring, by overlapping the weight loss 

curve (TGA) with temperature to the thermal energy curve (DTA). 

The equipment used was a Shimadzu® TGA-50. It’s a DTA/TGA equipment with 

the capability of doing the tests under a flowing gas of choice. The tests were done under 

flowing Argon. All tests were done in the same conditions: heating from room temperature 

to 1000oC at a rate of 10oC/min. 

II.1.4 Scanning Electron Microscopy – SEM/STEM 

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is a widely used technique to study the 

microstructure and morphology of materials. An electron gun generates a beam of 

electrons inside a vacuum column which is then focused and driven to collide with a target, 

the sample. An image is possible due to the electronic signal generated by the low angle 

backscattered electrons, which are created by electron interactions with the material 

surface. 31 

The SEM equipment used was a Hitachi® model SU-70, in the University of 

Aveiro, that has a maximum electron acceleration potential of 30 kV, a point-to-point 

resolution of 1 nm at 15 kV and an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). This 

equipment also permits transmission electron microscopy by putting a detector below the 

sample. This technique is often called scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). 

The powder samples were prepared by making a diluted suspension of powder in 

pure ethanol (99%) followed by deposition of a drop in a copper micrometric grid. The 



 
 
 

Chapter II – Experimental Procedure  
 

 

45 

 

support was then put inside the microscope before the drop dried to minimize the powder 

contact with air. Both SEM and STEM observations were done. 

To observe the thermal treated pellets, they were fractured and put on carbon tape 

and then coated with gold to make them conductive and prevent hydration. 62,63 

At CERN, SEM was done in a Link Leo Oxford Instruments®, model LEO 430I. 

This microscope has a maximum resolution of 4 nm and an electron potential acceleration 

up to 40 kV. It is also equipped with EDS. The same sample preparation techniques were 

used but instead of a cooper grid, carbon tape was used. 

II.1.5 Transmission Electron Microscopy - TEM 

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has the same operation principle of SEM 

(see section II.1.4), but in this case the electrons are accelerated at a much higher potential 

to pass through the sample towards the detector below it. The electrons, passing through 

the sample, which has to be very thin to allow it, are either absorbed or dispersed changing 

their directions. This dispersion is influenced by the atomic arrangement of the material. 

Afterwards they are focused again, amplified and projected in a fluorescent screen or in a 

monitor. 31 

TEM was done in a Hitachi® model 9000, in the University of Aveiro, with an 

acceleration potential of 300 kV. The samples for TEM were prepared by depositing a drop 

of a diluted powder suspension in pure ethanol (99%) in a micrometric copper grid. After 

drop dried, the grid was inserted in the support of the TEM sample chamber. 

II.1.6 Tape Station – Release Curves Measurement at ISOLDE 

In order to measure the yield and the release curve of a specific isotope, a device 

called tape station is used. This device transports implanted isotopes from the beam 

towards ?(?) and ? detectors. They are made of a plastic scintillator in the case of detector 

for ? particles and a Germanium crystal for ? detection. 

A release curve and yield are characteristic of a defined isotope and target unit. In 

order to accurately measure those, the beam has to have a high isotope to background noise 

ratio. The background is referred as being other isotopes produced and/or radiation 

resulting from the experimental hall or natural radiation. By increasing the isotope to

46 

 

background ratio, the background can be minimized until a point where the decay detected 

can be assumed to be all resulted from the isotope being produced. 

The tape station has two detectors and a metallic mylar tape that moves the atoms 

collected for a certain time (tcollection) to a measurement zone where the decay is measured 

for defined time (tmeasurement). By separating the measurement zone from the detection zone 

an adaptable system is obtained. Either high beam intensities which would saturate the 

detectors can be measured by reducing the tmeasurement or the tcollection, or low beam 

intensities in which to get some statistics those times have to be increased. In Figure II-1 

a), the different elements of a tape station can be seen. 

The obtained values have to be corrected for the losses of isotopes during all this 

processes, if they have short half-lives, in such a way that this corresponds to the release 

curve of the isotope right after its production. For this tcollection, tmeasurement, tdelay and the 

time that the tape takes to transport the atoms from the detection zone to the measurement 

zone (ttransport) have to be recorded. This curve is then fitted and corrected by a dedicated 

program to get the time constants from equation (I.2) from the pulse shape and then finally, 

the yield. The process of the obtainment of the beam and its way to the tape station can be 

seen in Figure II-1 b) and the steps for the measurement of a release curve are schematized 

in Figure II-1 c).

For isotopes which don’t have characteristic gamma decay another type of test can 

be done using ? decay properties. After collection, the tape is transported to the detector 

and the decay is measured over time, building a decay curve. This permits the 

identification of an isotope through its characteristic half-life.  

There are two tape stations at ISOLDE which ares located at different beam lines 

after the mass separator. The main difference between them is the minimum possible time 

that the tape takes to move from the detection zone to the measurement zone. Because of 

that, one is called the fast tape station (ttransport,min=200 ms) and the other the old tape 

station(ttransport,min=900 ms). 

To evaluate if there are contaminations in the beam after separation, gamma 

spectroscopy can be done, in which the different isotopes are assessed by their gamma 

decays. The peaks obtained are then compared (energy and relative intensity) with 

references in databases 14,82 to identify the isotopes. 

II.2 Raw Material 

For the material characterization studies done at the University of Aveiro, the raw 

material used to produce the calcium oxide (CaO) was a&amp;lt;5µm calcium carbonate (CaCO3) 

powder, with 99.5% chemical purity (metal basis) that was acquired from Alfa Aesar®. 

Characteristics of the material were retrieved from the supplier and additional 

characterization was also done, such as SEM, Coulter, XRD and DTA/TGA analysis 

(whose technique details are described ahead (Section II.1)), which results are presented in 

Figure II-2 to 3 and resumed in Table II-2.

As expected, calcite and traces of aragonite, a polymorph of calcite, were detected 

by XRD on CaCO3 (Figure II-2). 

 
Figure II-3 - Thermal analysis of calcium carbonate in air atmosphere. 

The DTA/TGA done on the raw material (Figure II-3) in air also confirms the 

presence of calcite by the high loss of mass between ~680oC and ~890oC and the 

coincident endothermic peak in the DTA curve. This analysis showed no signs of aragonite 

that should be seen in DTA by a peak at around 520oC 52, which confirms that it is present 

in small quantities. 

  
Figure II-4 – SEM observation of the CaCO 3  powder (a) and particle size distribution determined by laser 
diffraction (b).  

The morphology of CaCO3 particles was observed in SEM. As can be seen, in the 

Figure II-4 a), they are cubic shaped, like NaCl, and their sizes are less than 0.5 µm to 3 

µm. This is confirmed by the particle size distribution determined by laser diffraction in 

Figure II-4 b) which average value, GCoulter is given, together with other characteristics, 

such as density, specific surface area, SSA, and equivalent spherical diameter calculated 

from the SSA value, GBET, is indicated in Table II-2.

II.3 Calcination 

The decarbonation of CaCO3 to obtain CaO was done in a Termolab® vertical 

alumina furnace with a Eurotherm® PID (proportional – integral – derivative) controller in 

the University of Aveiro. A vacuum system was coupled to the furnace, which consisted in 

a vacuum pump Adixen® Pascal 2010 SD with a nominal pumping speed of 8.3m3/h, a 

pirani gauge Adixen® AP 2004 to measure the pressure (p) and a pressure display Adixen® 

ACS 2000 connected to a computer to register the pressure during the thermal cycle with 

the software AVG View provided by Adixen®. The vertical tube had steel flanges cooled by 

a circuit of water to avoid the deterioration of the rubber o-rings. In the connection of the 

pump to the tube there was a valve to control the pumping speed at the beginning of the 

cycle. A needle valve was installed in the furnace to break the vacuum slowly, when the 

calcination was finished. The sample holder made of alumina foam and mulite served as 

support to a cylindrical crucible with a lid for keeping the powder inside during the initial 

stage of the pumping of the furnace.  

Before calcination of the powder, tests of the furnace hot zone, heating and cooling 

rates, holding temperature and cycle duration were done. To accurately measure the 

temperature, a type-R thermocouple (Platinum/Platinum-13%Rhodium) was placed in the 

base of the sample holder and connected to a two channel Zipp &amp;amp; Zonen® recorder. As the 

furnace doesn’t have forced cooling, at the cooling rates used (10oC/min) it enters a natural 

cooling rate from 700ºC to room temperature (RT) taking about 7h. 

A test to the vacuum conditions was done too to optimize the vacuum system and 

detect eventual leaks. In the end of the tests, the minimum vacuum pressure achieved by 

the system after 6h of pumping was in the order of 10-1 to 1 Pa at room temperature and 

10Pa at 1100ºC.

50 

 

In the following table (Table II-3) are summarized the calcination conditions. The 

calcined powders were characterized by XRD, BET and SEM. The sample weight loss 

(WL) was always taken to evaluate the extent of the decomposition. 
Table II-3 - Experimental conditions used to decompose CaCO 3  into CaO, in vacuum.

Heating Speed 10ºC/min 
Cooling Speed 10ºC/min to 700ºC followed by natural cooling

Pressure ~1 Pa 

 

By plotting the furnace readout pressures during the thermal cycle versus time for 

different temperatures, useful information about the decomposition reaction can be 

obtained, as illustrated in Figure II-5 for calcinations at 600, 700, 800oC.

In Figure II-5 the time window, where the reaction happens, can be roughly 

estimated by the rising pressure zone, indicated as A in the figure, which corresponds to 

the production of CO2. The duration of this zone (time between A and B) and its maximum 

pressure is clearly influenced by the temperature of the holding time, showing that the

reaction is much faster for high temperatures, since the maximum attained pressure is 

higher and the duration is shorter. 

II.4 Calcium Oxide Reactivity Tests 

Nanometric calcium oxide powder is reported to be very reactive when exposed to 

air at usual RT conditions. 61,66 To study the reactivity of the produced calcium oxide, 

somea samples of the synthetized powder with different SSAs were exposed to air during 2 

days and the weight gain was taken along the exposure time. The powder specific surface 

area, XRD phase identification and crystallite size (before and after exposure) as well as 

DTA/TGA of the reacted powders, were performed. 

To evaluate the reversibility of the air reaction, the exposed powders were thermal 

treated in vacuum at 800ºC for different times (5, 15 and 40 min) and the SSA and 

crystallite size were determined. Also DTA/TGA was done to the “recovered” ones to 

evaluate if the conversion to CaO was complete. 

II.4.1 Sample Storage 

Due to the observed high reactivity of the produced CaO powders to moisture and 

CO2, the samples were kept under special conditions, reducing the pressure of these gases 

in the surrounding atmosphere. This was achieved by using a 2l Nahita® glass desiccator 

with a valve which could be connected to a pump to evacuate the system, storing the 

samples under vacuum.  

The need to open the desiccator during the studies exposed the samples to air and 

so, a desiccant, silica gel, was used to reduce the hydration. Afterwards, the nanometric 

CaO powder itself (produced in house by decomposition of CaCO3 in vacuum at 700ºC), 

was used as a desiccant. 61 This powder proved to be much more effective, greatly 

reducing the weight gain of the samples, as can be seen in Table II-4.

II.5 Microstructural Evolution During Vacuum Sintering 

The obtained CaO powder was compacted and thermal treated in a furnace at the 

University of Aveiro, under a temperature range and vacuum pressure equivalent to those 

used during CaO target operation at ISOLDE, CERN.   

In order to study the microstructural evolution during sintering, cylindrical 

compacts, 10 mm diameter, 2-3 mm in thickness were pressed by using a hydraulic 

Carver® Laboratory Press – Model C. A small study of the press conditions was done just 

in order to evaluate the pressure required to give the compact some mechanical integrity 

for normal handling and having at the same time a high porosity. It was concluded that the 

best settings were pressing ~0.25 g of powder at 125 MPa for 5 s, resulting in a compact 

with high porosity, P~60%. 

Since the target units are operated at pressures of ~10-4 Pa, a furnace which could 

achieve approximate vacuum conditions was used. A Thermolab® FTV 213/2007 furnace 

was used, which could reach pressures of 10-4 Pa at RT and from 10-3 to 10-2 Pa 1200ºC. 

This furnace is composed of a small chamber, with a tungsten heating element, which was 

pumped by a rotary and an oil diffusion pump. Both chamber and diffusion pump were 

cooled by a water circuit. 

The handling of powder and compacts revealed to be a very challenging process, 

since hydration and carbonation occurs very fast, affecting the powder characteristics and 

causing break of compacts. Therefore, immediately after pressing, the compacts were 

maintained under vacuum. Nevertheless, some samples were found broken after the 

thermal cycle. 

A summary of the sintering conditions can be found in the Table II-5. After 

sintering, the specific surface area (SSA) the shrinkage (whenever possible) and crystallite 

size were determined.  
Table II-5 - Experimental conditions in CaO sintering experiments.

The obtained SSA reductions and shrinkage were then plotted vs. holding time and 

fitted accordingly to the model presented in equation (I.27), using the program Origin 

v8.5.1. Identically, the same data treatment procedure was done to the shrinkage. 

II.6 Material Testing at ISOLDE-CERN 

After the synthesis of CaO from calcium carbonate, the respective powder 

characterization and sintering kinetic studies at the University of Aveiro, this investigation 

proceeded at ISOLDE. Before online operation, studies were performed on the CaO 

synthesis at ISOLDE to evaluate the powder microstructure. This was done using the 

established conditions for CaO target production, named “old procedure”, and to compare 

the microstructure of the calcinated powder obtained at ISOLDE using an equivalent 

thermal cycle as used in Aveiro, calling it “new procedure”. 

In consequence of the investigation done, new conditions for the target preparation 

and handling could be implemented. 

II.6.1 CaO Target Production at ISOLDE: “Old Procedure” 

In order to produce and characterize the CaO used in the past at ISOLDE, the “old 

procedure” was done. The raw material (CaCO3) was first dried by heating it in a porcelain 

crucible at 200ºC for a day. A rhenium (Re) boat with approximately the dimensions of the 

target (195 mm long and 20 mm diameter) was filled with the powder and put in a 

dedicated oven (see Figure II-6), similar to a target unit, in high vacuum (10-3&lt;p&lt;10-2 Pa) 

using a turbo and a rotary pumps. The temperature was then increased (measured with an 

optical pyrometer), until pressure reached 10-2 Pa, up to 1200oC. The process took about 

24h and was over when the pressure reached a value lower than 10-3 Pa, indicating that the 

decarbonation reaction is finished. To make sure that the decarbonation was complete the 

oven was kept at the final temperature for some hours, after reaching 10-3 Pa. Afterwards, 

the oven was cooled down and purged with Ar and the Re boat was refilled - due to the 

high loss of mass (~44%) - with CaCO3, maintaining the CaO produced so far. The whole 

process was then repeated one more time.

and below a rotary pump (c), the controls for the water cooling and others (d), the bottle of Ar to purge the system 
(e) and the window used to measure the temperature with the pyrometer (f). 

At the end of the process (which takes around 48h) the oven was purged again with 

Ar and the Re boat was taken out of the oven and kept in a desiccator for material 

characterization testing. During the whole process the Re boat was weighted whenever 

possible to assess the reaction completion. Since the oven is known to have a thermal 

gradient from the sides to the center of it, samples were taken separately in both 

temperature zones for characterization by SEM, XRD and BET. 

These synthesis conditions were applied to another carbonate powder (see its 

characteristics in Appendix (Table A-1)) previously used at ISOLDE in the preparation of 

the CaO targets. This sample was designated T12 and was characterized through BET, 

XRD and SEM. The calcination conditions are summarized in Table II-6.

II.6.2 CaO Target Production at ISOLDE: “New Procedure” 

Based on the obtained results for CaO synthesis, handling and sintering in this 

research, adjustments for the production method were proposed and applied. Further 

changes in the target unit were also done.

To produce the new target, the raw material used at the UA studies was used. The 

process was very similar to the old one, but the following changes were made: (i) the 

heating and cooling rates were fixed at 10oC/min; (ii) the temperature was risen in one step 

to 800oC (overriding the pressure interlock at 10-2 Pa) and the pressures rose up to a 

maximum of 160 Pa, similarly to the synthesis studies at the University of Aveiro (see 

Figure II-5); (iii) instead of a pyrometer to measure the temperature, a thermocouple type 

K was installed for a more accurate control; (iv) the material was kept at 800oC, for 48h, in 

order to insure a complete reaction and to outgas the impurities; (v) no refill was done to 

avoid unnecessary material hydration (vi) and the transfer of the material to the target unit 

was done in a gloves box in a controlled Argon atmosphere (as seen in Figure II-7). 

Afterwards, as usual for every target at ISOLDE, the target and the ion source temperatures 

were calibrated against input voltage and current, and the target was mounted on the 

offline separator for further tests and outgasing of impurities. The newly produced CaO 

was likewise characterized by BET and XRD. Two powder samples, named S80, were 

taken, one from the center and another from the side of the target. The calcination 

conditions can be seen in Table II-7. 
Table II-7 - Calcination conditions for the "new process" of the CaO target production at ISOLDE.  

Calcination Temperature 800oC 
Heating and Cooling Speed 10oC/min 
Holding Time ~48h 
Pressure 10-3 to 160 Pa 

 

The new target unit has also undergone some evolution: two type C thermocouples 

were installed in order to measure the current temperature at the center of the container and 

at the sides, during online operation. A different heat shielding was installed in order to 

reduce the temperature gradient along the container. A different ion source with improved 

ionization efficiency of argon was used. 

To assess the reproducibility of the process at ISOLDE and characterize the new 

target material, a calcium oxide sample was produced in the same target oven with the 

same thermal cycle used at the UA (2h of holding time at 800oC, with 10oC/min of heating 

and cooling rates). The resulting sample was named T80 and characterized in terms of 

surface area and porosity.

II.7 Beam Tests at ISOLDE-CERN 

II.7.1 Offline Measurements 

The target unit was tested at the offline mass separator to evaluate if there were no 

leaks and if the electrical, gas and water connections were working, as is usual procedure 

at ISOLDE. The target unit was then heated up to operation temperatures (up to 800oC), 

which in the case of the old CaO targets was around 1100oC to 1200oC. Stable beams were 

assessed for different masses to evaluate the level of impurities produced by the target 

material and ion source. The ion source efficiency was then tested by injecting known 

quantities of noble gases through a calibrated leak, and monitoring the mass separated in 

the beam. The target was left for 3 days at the operation temperatures to outgas impurities. 

Before the transport to the ISOLDE frontend, the target unit was filled with argon and 

sealed. 

II.7.2 Online Operation 

The new target was mounted in the front end of ISOLDE, pumped and operated at 

temperatures up to 800oC with low proton intensities, 8x1012 protons per pulse (usually its 

3x1013). The new target was labeled with the reference CaO#469. 

Since there was a thermal gradient on the container of the target CaO#469, a 

weighted average, to determine a representative (rounded) temperature given by the 

thermocouples (T), was taken into account according to the following formula:

where TS is the temperature at the sides of the container, TC is temperature at center of the 

container, as schematically represented in Figure II-8. The calculated temperatures varies 

from 520oC (see Table II-8), with temperature differences from the center to side of 190oC 

to 840oC where this difference was only 40oC.

Release curves were done using the tape station (described in the following section) 

and gamma spectroscopy (also described ahead) in order to assess radioactive isobaric 

impurities in the beam. For the tests on the very short lived isotopes such as 31,32Ar the tape 

station is not able to measure. For this a special experimental setup (IS476 2) was used. In 

order to compare and scale the values 33Ar was measured in both systems.  The tests done 

are summarized on the Table II-8.

CaO#123 was operated in November 1999 and was the best calcium oxide target to be 

operated at ISOLDE, since its yields on several isotopes were the highest registered 45. This 

target was operated at 1050oC. Two recent targets were also compared: the targets 

CaO#408 operated in August 2009 and CaO#419 in November of the same year. The latter 

is representative of a standard CaO target. All of the old targets were run at 3x1013 protons 

per pulse.

Chapter III – Results and Discussion

III.1 Material Characterization Study 

As referred before, in order to improve the intensities of beams at ISOLDE, the 

target material has to be improved mainly in terms of the diffusion properties. To attain 

this goal, the microstructure of the target material had to be investigated aiming at 

controlling it. This section presents the results of the CaO synthesis from the respective 

carbonate, powder characterization, and powder microstructure evolution during thermal 

treatments. 

III.1.1 Synthesis of CaO 

In order to study the influence of the thermal cycle in the decomposition reaction of 

CaCO3, different conditions were tested. The summary of the decomposition conditions 

and characteristics of the obtained CaO powder can be seen on Table III-1. A holding time 

of 2h was used for the majority of experiments, which was increased for lower 

temperatures in order to achieve total decomposition. A long duration cycle of 48h, at 

1000oC, was also tested in D10 sample. The main parameters to characterize the obtained 

powder were the crystallite size, by XRD using the most intense peak (200), and the 

specific surface area. From the surface area, applying equation (II.3), the particle size 

could be estimated.

For a total CaCO3 decomposition, 44% of weight loss (WL) is expected taking the 

stoichiometry expressed by equation (I.22), but in some cases, higher values of WL were 

observed due to losses of powder from the crucible during the furnace operation. The 

sample D55, calcined at 550oC, had a lower value of WL (36%) suggesting incomplete

decomposition (confirmed by XRD) which matches the low value of SSA, due to the 

presence of low SSA CaCO3 (2.80 m2/g). In the case of D65, the decomposition was 

complete but significant hydration had occurred, as confirmed by the detection of Ca(OH)2 

by XRD, leading to a lower SSA value. The effects of powder hydration on the SSA will 

be further detailed ahead. In all other samples no CaCO3 phase or traces could be detected 

on the XRD, confirming the full decomposition, but often traces of the Ca(OH)2 could be 

detected. These results are similar to those obtained by D. Glasson at the same 

temperature, as can be seen in Table I-3, page 32. 

 After the optimization of the furnace operation, to operate under lower vacuum 

(p~10-1Pa), the samples produced at 800oC (N80) yielded an average SSA value of 58±4 

m2/g with XS being 32±2 nm in agreement with GBET (31±3 nm).  

In order to better visualize the effect of the decomposition temperature on the 

surface area and crystallite size, for similar vacuum conditions, the plot of the Figure III-1 

was done. 

 
Figure III-1 - Plot of the specific surface area (SSA) and the crystallite size (XS) versus temperature for the 
calcined powder, obtained under similar vacuum conditions, and 2h of holding time. 

In Figure III-1 a linear decrease of the SSA with the increase of the decomposition 

temperature can be seen. The behavior is in agreement with the results of E. Powell 61.  D. 

Glasson’s 56 results showed increasing surface area until 800oC and then fast decreasing of 

SSA, claimed to be due to sintering of CaO, he stated. This behavior doesn’t match the 

obtained results in this work. No tendency was found for the variation of the determined 

crystallite size. The XS values present a fairly good agreement with the obtained GBET, 

value and confirm that a nanometric material is obtained by decomposing CaCO3 under 

vacuum, in this range of temperatures, as confirmed by other authors 50,51,54,55,57.

Despite the fact that the obtained powders were nanometric, the obtained surface 

areas are somehow lower than those obtained in the literature (see Table I-3, in page 32). 

This differences may come from the better vacuum conditions reported in the literature 

(10-2&lt;p&lt;10-5 Pa), lower temperatures used for decomposition and better storage/transport 

conditions up to the material analysis equipment. Furthermore, J. Ewing 63 and D. Beruto 58 

reported that in powder beds, residual pressures of CO2 decreases the surface areas 

obtained, by enhancing sintering. Maximum pressures over 100 Pa were measured during 

the decompositions, as can be seen in Figure II-5 in page 50, which according to J. Ewing 
63, can lower the SSA. This reduction of surface area is due to the catalytic effect of CO2 

on the sintering of the samples. 63 The improvement of the vacuum conditions in this work 

(with the change of the powder support from porous to denser parts and other adjustment 

in valves and o-rings), led to the attaining of SSA and XS closer to those in the literature 

values, as can be exemplified by sample N80 when compared with D80 (higher pressure, 

see Table III-1).

expected, lower values of SSA and higher values of XS were obtained, but the material 

was still able to keep its nanometric size. 

SEM and STEM was used to analyse the microstructure of the N80 powder, as 

presented in Figure III-2. Observing the microstructures of the raw material in the Figure 

III-2 a) and the N80 sample in Figure III-2 b), the decomposition reaction can be classified 

as pseudomorphous due to the small changes in the particle size and shape. This was also 

observed by D. Beruto 54 and others 55,49,63. The CaO powder presents a higher degree of 

agglomeration and rounded edges that may come either from hydration during handling 

or/and transport to the microscope 68. 

The CaO nanograins were hard to see in SEM. The apparent orange-peel roughness 

observed at the surface of the particles in the SEM microstructure of Figure III-2 c), and in 

the STEM observation of a thin agglomerate in Figure III-2 d), was reported to correspond 

to the image of nanosized CaO grains 55. The SEM and STEM observations permit to 

conclude that the CaO powder is constituted by agglomerates of identical shape and size as 

the initial CaCO3 particles and that these agglomerates are constituted by nanograins 

smaller than 70 nm. The particles seem to be more like plate shaped, agreeing with what 

was observed for CaO powder obtained by CaCO3 in other studies 50,64.The porosity inside 

the agglomerates couldn’t be resolved by SEM. 

  
Figure III-3 – TEM observations of CaO sample, N80. 

By taking a look in the TEM micrographs presented in Figure III-3, the cubic 

shaped CaO agglomerates can be observed in the left and on the right a high magnification 

image shows that they are constituted by very fine grains, confirming the previous 

observation in SEM/STEM. One of the limitations in the TEM analysis came from the

significant hydration of the sample due to the drying of the alcohol suspension drop before 

the microscope observation. 

Taking the adsorption of N2 gas at 77K on the powder samples N80 (800oC) and 

D10 (1000oC, 48h), the whole isotherm was determined for each powder in Figure III-4. 

 
Figure III-4 - Isotherms obtained by adsorption of N 2  for the samples D80 and D10. 

Both isotherms are of type IV and present hysteresis 81. These types of isotherms 

are associated with materials that have mesoporosity. 81 The software of the BET 

equipment was used to calculate of the pore size distribution using the Barret-Joyner-

Halenda (BJH), giving also the pore volume. In Figure III-5, the determined pore size 

distribution for the N80 and D10 samples is represented. 

 
Figure III-5 - Pore size distribution of the samples N80 and D10. 

 From Figure III-5 it can be seen that both pore size distributions are unimodal and 

that the porosity of the sample D10 is lower and slightly shifted to lower pore sizes, 

comparing to the N80 sample. In Table III-1, the values of porosity and average pore size 

calculated from the curves of Figure III-5 are presented. The lower average pore size and

lower porosity at the sample D10 calcined at 1100oC, 48h, when compared with the N80 

sample calcined at 800oC, 2h, are in accord with the reduced SSA value in that sample and 

show that at 1000oC sintering effects are already relevant.  

The values obtained for the porosity of N80 sample were consistent with the ones 

published in the literature 54 (41.5% of porosity and 10 nm of pore average size in CaO 

obtained from CaCO3 vacuum calcination). Assuming that the reaction is pseudomorphous 

and taking the molar volumes of CaO and CaCO3 one could expect a porosity of ~55%. 

This is probably related to some sintering either of CaCO3 before the decomposition 56 or 

of the CaO during the calcination, possibly catalyzed by the presence of the CO2 resultant 

from the decomposition 55. 

III.1.2 Reactivity in Air 

As stated in section I.4.3, the calcium oxide reacts, spontaneously, with H2O and 

CO2 in air. The high surface area of the CaO powders in this study will enhance the 

reactivity, as reported by D. Beruto 66 and E. Powel 61, affecting powder characteristics. 

Therefore, the kinetics of the reaction between the nanometric CaO powder and air and the 

effect on the powder characteristics needs to be investigated, prior to the powder 

processing.  

In order to know the extent of the hydration/carbonation reactions, DTA/TGA tests 

under Ar flow, were done in N80 sample, as shown in the Figure III-6 a) after normal 

handling* and b) intentionally left at air for 2 days.  

As can be seen in the TGA curve presented in Figure III-6 a), the sample, after 

normal handling, keeps reacting until 330oC (rise in weight of 1.2%). This is probably due 

to residual water/carbon dioxide coming from its surface (adsorbed), from the gas bottle 

(residuals) or even air leaks in the system. Around 400oC the decomposition of Ca(OH)2 is 

happening (DTA endothermic peak and TGA loss of mass). The %H2O is about 4.5 wt.% 

which corresponds (equation (I.24)) to a conversion of ~18 wt.% of CaO in Ca(OH)2 

during air exposure. Similarly, from the slight weight loss (~2%) around 600oC, which is 

most likely due to loss of CO2 (%CO2) due to the CaCO3 decomposition, one can estimate 

~4 wt.% (from the reaction (I.25)) of carbonate in CaO. In the XRD of the powder after 

                                                 
* A “normal handled” CaO powder corresponds to an exposure at air variable between 5 and 10min, 

due to the purge and opening of the calcination furnace, weighting and transport to the desiccator.

normal handling (Figure III-7 a)) no CaCO3 and only small traces of Ca(OH)2 were 

detected. D. Glasson 83 reported that values up to 20 wt.% of Ca(OH)2 in reacted CaO 

couldn’t be detected in XRD. He attributes this to a fast reaction which has a time lag in 

recrystallization, giving a poorly crystalline phase. 

 

 

Figure III-6 - Thermal analysis of the N80 sample after decomposition and normal handling (a) and after 
intentional exposure at air for 2 days (b). 

From the DTA/TGA of the Figure III-6 b) the total weight loss (~32%), is 

equivalent to the weight gain after air reaction for 2 days (~49 wt.%) by changing the base 

of calculation from reacted CaO mass to non-reacted one. From the DTA/TGA curves, the 

CaO hydration and carbonation extent are calculated to be ~70 wt.% and ~30 wt.%, 

respectively (correcting already for weight loss due to adsorbed molecules from 60 to 

250oC, as seen in the TGA curve of Figure III-6 b)). These results are consistent with the 

XRD results (see Figure III-7 b)), where no peaks of CaO were detected, confirming the 

depletion of CaO, and the intense peaks of Ca(OH)2, whereas only small CaCO3 peaks are 

detected.

Figure III-7 - XRD of the N80 powder after normal handling (a) and left at air for 2 days (b). 

To study the rate and extent of the CaO reaction in air, three samples of different 

initial SSA (25, 47 and 59 m2/g) were left at air during Summer time and periodically 

weighted. The results are presented the Figure III-8 a). 

 
Figure III-8 - Plot of the weight gain over two days for three samples of CaO with different initial surface areas (a) 
and respective amplification for shorter times (b). The dotted line represents the weight gain if the powder would 
be completely hydrated.  

It can be seen that the kinetics of the reactivity of the CaO in air is divided in two 

regimes: the initial one with a higher reaction rate, until ~5h, and another slower for longer 

times. As expected the powders with higher SSA were the most reactive ones, gaining 

weight faster and attaining larger values of weight gain which are probably related with the 

interference of the adsorption phenomena. After 2 days, the weight gain was unnoticeable 

for all the samples, indicating that the reaction was finished. In order to confirm this 

DTA/TGA would have done, to check for CaO for the samples (47 and 25 m2/g). The fast 

hydration when exposed to air, of high surface area CaO powders was previously reported 

by other authors 54,61 but nothing was referred about carbonation in their studies. Since in

the reacted samples, only a small quantity of CaCO3 was detected (see Table III-2 below) 

comparing to the Ca(OH)2, the faster regime is assumed to be mainly controlled by the 

hydration reaction, defined by the equation (I.24).  

For shorter times the reaction is nearly linear with time (see Figure III-8 b)). The 

rate of weight gain is, in average, ~0.3 wt.% min-1. If one, considers this weight gain for 

shorter times to be essentially due to hydration, the average “hydration rate” can be 

roughly defined as 1 wt.% min-1 of conversion of CaO into Ca(OH)2. 

From the above results and using some speculation, the reaction of CaO with air 

can be described by the following steps: (i) as soon as CaO is in contact with air, it reacts 

both with H2O (equation (I.24)) and CO2 (equation (I.25)) to form spontaneously at the 

same time respectively, Ca(OH)2 and CaCO3. It also starts to adsorb, gaining additional 

weight. As shown before, the hydration reaction dominates the faster regime; (ii) as soon 

as Ca(OH)2 is formed, another spontaneous (accordingly to thermodynamics) reaction can 

start to form CaCO3 from the hydrate (equation (I.26)); (iii) when most of the CaO is 

consumed by the hydration reaction, the slower regime starts: the reaction of carbonation is 

known to form a low porous product slowing down and preventing further reaction 71. As 

the reaction progresses more and more, and CaCO3 is being formed, it creates an 

impermeable layer, slowing down the process and eventually stopping the transformation 

of Ca(OH)2 into CaCO3. 

Since it was observed that during the hydration of CaO there is also carbonation the 

chosen temperature to test reversibility and to accomplish complete conversion back to 

CaO needs to be high enough to decompose the formed CaCO3. The selected temperature 

was 800oC and different times at this temperature were tested. Results for powder 

characteristics before and after the hydration and reversibility thermal tests can be seen in 

the Table III-2.

From the presented results it can be seen that the initial material is not totally 

recovered in terms of surface area, although the crystallite size is almost the same as that of 

the initial powder. The SSA decreases significantly during the powder exposure and 

increases after the thermal treatment, although, the attained values are less than half of the 

initial SSA. The time increase at 800oC brings a fast reduction of the SSA values. Not 

enough studies were made in this work to assess the sintering kinetics of the CaO obtained 

from Ca(OH)2 but the literature reports higher sintering rates than the one produced from 

CaCO3 74. 

To evaluate the difference in the microstructure of the material, SEM analysis was 

done before the powder was left at air and after the thermal treatment. The differences seen 

in the micrographs were not conclusive enough, but in the literature the hydration reaction 

is reported to be followed by a volume expansion 70, which would change the morphology 

of the microstructure. 

III.1.3 Sintering Kinetics of CaO 

In order to study the thermal behavior of the CaO powders, pressed compacts with 

a relative density, ?0=0.4, were used. Several thermal treatments (TT) were done in a high 

vacuum furnace using atmosphere and temperature conditions close to those used during 

target operation. The samples were handled* in order to minimize contact with air, to 

enhance the reproducibility of the results. Even though all the precautions were taken an 

error of ~20% is expected from the obtained results, due to some air exposure.

In the plot of the Figure III-9, the results of surface area reduction after sintering 

the powder compacts for the shortest - 3min - and longest times - 10h - can be seen. From 

this plot it can be observed that for T&gt;1000oC there are net sintering effects which brings a 

significant surface area reduction from the initial powder (more than one half, in the case 

of 10h at 1200oC).  

It was possible to apply the German and Munir model 73 to the values of SSA at 

1200oC by fitting equation (I.27), through iterations, finding S0 and ? as represented in 

Figure III-10. 

 
Figure III-10 - Plot of the surface areas versus temperature for several temperature and respective fits. 

The obtained value for the kinetic exponent, ?, was 2.1. By checking Table I-4 it 

can be seen that for Nc=4, ?0=0.32, close to the fractional density, ?0=0.4, of the green 

compacts, the determined ? value lies between 1.6 for the mechanism of evaporation-

condensation and 2.7 corresponding to volume diffusion. 

Since at 1200oC the SSA values were the ones that were obtained with less 

scattering, the exponent ?=2.1, determined at that temperature, was assumed for the 

variation of SSA at lower temperatures. The calculated curves could reasonably fit the 

points, as seen in Figure III-10 (values of R2 from the fit are presented). This means that 

the same mechanism may control the matter transport for sintering. From the same plot, it 

can be seen that the higher degree of sintering happens at 1200oC, and at 1000oC and 

1100oC the sintering rate is much lower, as expected from a thermal activated mechanism 

as diffusion is. 

To help the identification of the controlling mechanism of matter transport, the 

linear shrinkage (?l/l0) at 1200oC was determined for the pressed samples. The diameter 

values are plotted versus time at 1200oC, Figure III-11, accordingly to equation (I.29).

Figure III-11 - Plot of the diameter variation with time at 1200oC. 

Since this model also applies for isothermal conditions, l0 was also taken from the 

fit. Figure III-11 shows that the reduction of SSA is accompanied by shrinkage of the 

compact (a maximum value of ?l/l0=2.7% was obtained at 600 min). This observation 

leads to the conclusion that the sintering mechanism can be identified with volume 

diffusion, since evaporation-condensation doesn’t bring densification of the compact. 

Furthermore, the determined value for the kinetic exponent is s=1.96, and by comparing 

this result to the theoretical ones in the Table I-4, one can further confirm that the sintering 

mechanism is identified with volume diffusion (s=2). This conclusion is consistent with the 

studies of R. Borgwardt 74 in which for sintering in N2 atmosphere the value of ? obtained 

was 2.7, identifying volume diffusion as the main sintering mechanism.

activation energy for the mass transport during CaO sintering. The calculated values of 

Q=155 kJ mol-1 can be compared with the literature values for auto diffusion in CaO. From 

the literature, values of Q=339 kJ mol-1 for the diffusion of 45Ca in CaO polycrystalline 

samples within the temperature ranges of 1000 to 1600oC, 84 and Q=142 kJ mol-1 for the 

diffusion of 45Ca in CaO single crystals from 1000 to 1400oC 85 can be found. The 

calculated value for the apparent activation energy in the sintering of CaO, in this work, 

seems consistent with the published results for Ca diffusion in CaO single crystals and may 

be indicative of sintering controlled by the cation volume diffusion.

SEM observations were done in samples heated at 1200ºC for 3min, 2h and 10h, as 

can be seen in Figure III-13. By observing those, and despite the low quality of the images 

caused by the reaction with air, there is no significant change. The sintering may first occurs 

among the nanometric grains, inside agglomerates, since ~45% of porosity was determined to 

exist in the powder particles. 

III.2 Material Testing at ISOLDE-CERN 

As referred in the experimental section II.6, page 53, the raw material used at 

ISOLDE to produce the old targets (henceforth CC2) was different from the one used in 

this study and its characteristics are presented in Table A-1 in the Appendix. A CaO 

powder target (T12) was produced from the CaCO3 used in the past (CC2) and following 

synthesis conditions named “old procedure” (detailed in section II.6.1, page 53). The

microstructures of this powder before (T12, Table III-3) and after thermal treatment (S12, 

Table III-3) at 1200oC, for 48h, were characterized to have a comparison with the 

characteristics of the target produced with the “new procedure”, ahead in this section.  

In the “old procedure”, samples from the center of the container (T12 – Center) and 

from the side (T12 – Side) were taken. The obtained results can be seen in Table III-3.

The difference between the center and side T12 samples is probably due to the 

thermal gradient in the target oven. Despite the high temperatures used, a nanometric 

powder was obtained. The difference between the samples T12 – Center and S12 show 

high sintering of the CaO powder: larger crystallite size, and a pore size and volume 

decrease. These results can explain the bad performance of these targets after some time of 

operation. 

A sample of CaO (sample T80 in Table III-4) with the actual carbonate powder and 

the “new procedure” was prepared with equivalent thermal cycle conditions (temperature 

and time) of those used in University of Aveiro (UA), N80, to assess if the synthesis 

process was reproducible at ISOLDE.

There are some differences between the powder samples produced in UA and in 

ISOLDE, most probably due to the different equipment used to produce the CaO. A finer 

CaO is obtained through the “new process” as expected already (smaller grain size, higher 

surface area, porosity and pore volume). A long duration calcination cycle, 800oC, for 48h, 

was also done, sample S80, Table III-4, and small changes in the microstructural 

characteristics were observed when comparing it with sample T80, showing that the 



 
 

 
Chapter III – Results and Discussion

produced microstructure is relatively stable at 800oC. From these results, the online 

operation temperature of this target was set to a maximum of 800oC. The new target 

material doesn’t comply with the defined requirement of pore size 7,8 (&gt;100 nm comparing 

to the obtained 20 nm), but this parameter is hard to control since it is characteristic of the 

CaCO3 decomposition. One can also see that the CaO obtained from the “new procedure” 

(Table III-4) is finer and has larger pore size and volume than the one produced through 

the “old procedure” (Table III-3). The CC2 was also a coarser and less pure raw material. 

A nanostructured material was already produced before at ISOLDE (as seen in the 

reproduced results in Table III-3), but this nanostructure was most of the times lost 

depending how the material was produced, handled and operated. Since no study or 

knowledge about this material didn’t exist (or was lost) and since production, degas and 

handling phases were not controlled, it would be a coincidence for all the conditions to be 

combined in order to obtain a material with good release properties of isotopes. This 

explains the (sometimes) good isotope yields for this target, and the reported drop on them, 

meaning that the target was being heated to high, degrading the microstructure and so the 

yields over time.  

A new target material was then produced according to “the new procedure” 

(detailed in section II.6.2 on page 54), and the new target was labeled with the reference 

CaO#469. The sample S80 (in Table III-4) was extracted from the center of the container, 

while the side sample indicated a very low surface area (4.5m2/g) and also the XRD 

showed CaCO3 peaks only, stating only little or no decomposition. This is again a sign of a 

thermal gradient between the center and the side of the target oven. In section III.1.1, 

temperature influence studies on the CaCO3 decomposition were done. This was further 

confirmed when weighting the Re boat, showing that the reaction was 95% complete, 

meaning that only a little quantity didn’t decompose. 

The material was transferred from the oven to the target container, in a gloves box 

under an Argon atmosphere in order to avoid exposure to air. This method proved to be 

effective, since no peaks from the Ca(OH)2 phase were detected in the XRD, unlike most 

of the tests done in this study. 

In this target unit, an inverse gradient to the one of the oven is formed. The 

temperature is lower at the center and higher at the sides as measured by two 

thermocouples. This was caused by a water cooled copper block around the transfer line

(see Figure I-4) in the center. As soon as temperatures approached 500oC at the sides of the 

container, there was a sudden increase of the pressure (up to 10-1 Pa), showing the 

decomposition of the remaining CaCO3, which was completed after 50 min as the pressure 

went back to initial low pressures. 

Afterwards, the normal procedure followed up (offline operation and outgassing for 

3 days) at temperatures lower than 800oC to avoid any nanostructure degradation. 

III.3 Online Studies 

In order to test the impact of a nanostructure on the isotope release properties with 

respect of other calcium oxide targets, a benchmark of this material was obtained by 

testing the new unit CaO#469 in comparison with others previously used at ISOLDE. The 

release curves for several isotopes were monitored. Yields on 35Ar were probed throughout 

the target run to check for possible yields drop. Also, release curves for 35Ar and 19Ne at 3 

different target temperatures were taken in order to assess effusion and diffusion properties 

of the material. The release efficiency was calculated with values obtained from other CaO 

targets used before at ISOLDE. 

III.3.1 Isotope Yields 

The yields for 6He, 10,15C, 19Ne, 31-33Ar and 35Ar were measured and compared with 

a database compiling historical data of the best targets produced at ISOLDE 45, as seen in 

Table III-5.

yields.

Table III-5, shows a match or a significant increase of the yields of CaO#469 for 

most of the isotopes, versus the database yields. One of the main differences is the 



 
 

 
Chapter III – Results and Discussion  

77 

 

temperature at which the target CaO#469 operated, relatively to the old targets. Since 

proton impact effect at ISOLDE is unknown for this material, the temperature was set to 

650oC as regular operation temperature in order to partially compensate for the spike 

heating caused by the proton pulses. Whenever the target temperature was risen, it was 

only for the measurement in question, being lowered right away. 

Clear improvement was obtained on 35Ar yield, being 5 times superior to the one in 

the database, and the highest in all history of ISOLDE. This is consistent with the previous 

hypothesis that a controlled microstructure (nanostructure), leads to better yields. The good 

value for 35Ar is even underestimated since part of the release curve was cut away, and 

only partly compensated by the fitting program.  The 31Ar yield measurement is probably 

the best achievement, being 8 times higher than database values, confirming again that a 

microstructure with smaller grains which have shorter diffusion lengths enhances the 

release, as will be discussed further ahead. The measured yields for 31,33,35Ar and 10C were 

all higher than database values, compared to any of the target materials used so far at 

ISOLDE. 19Ne and 15C isotope yields were the highest of all CaO past target units. Most of 

the yields were obtained with conservative running parameters to preserve the target 

nanostructure, which means that probably they can be further enhanced by increasing the 

target operation temperature, without compromising it. 

The high yields, on the measured isotopes on the database 45, were mostly provided 

by target CaO#123 operated in 1999. Since then, these results were hard to reproduce 

mainly for the reasons detailed before (section III.2). The results of target CaO#123 were 

probably of such a good quality due to the use of a different production process 9, 

decomposing the CaCO3 at a lower temperature (1000oC, instead of 1200oC used 

afterwards) in a single batch instead of 2, obtaining smaller grain sizes. Additionally, lower 

operation temperatures were used (1050oC), helping to keep the microstructure for longer 

times, comparing with other standard CaO targets which were operated at temperatures 

between 1050 and 1150oC 45 and also at 1340oC 9. 

III.3.2 Yields Over Time 

The CaO targets at ISOLDE, are reported to have low yields of exotic Ar isotopes 

from the beginning, or a fast drop when operated under proton irradiation. In this work it is 

shown that it can be avoided by maintaining the microstructure without significant

degradation due to sintering. An example of a relative drop on the yields for precedent 

targets is shown in Figure III-14 for 31,32Ar. 

 
Figure III-14 - Yield evolution on 32Ar on target CaO#191 in 2001 at ISOLDE (courtesy of Susanne Kreim) and 
31Ar in CaO#408. 

As can be seen in Figure III-14, the yields dropped to 30% of the initial value in 

only 15h of operation time. The yield of this isotope is a good benchmark of the 

microstructure degradation since it is very short lived (98ms), so any increase on the grain 

size would increase the diffusion lengths that would directly affect the total release of 32Ar. 

On another target, CaO#408, the yield on 31Ar dropped by a factor 5 from 5 ions/µC after 8 

hours of operation time. On the new target, CaO#469, the yields on the very short lived 

isotopes (31-33Ar) were measured after 80 hours of operation. The measured numbers 

proved to be higher than in any previous target (especially for 31Ar, see Figure III-14), but 

no measurements along time could be done. 

The yield of 35Ar was taken throughout the run, for target CaO#469, and compared 

to the yield drop on a standard target (CaO#419) as can be seen in Figure III-15.

A drop of ~80% on the yield could be noticed on target CaO#419 after 120h, most 

probably related with the material microstructure degradation, even though this isotope is 

not a very short-lived one. On target CaO#469, one notices that, the yields are higher and 

there is no drop until the end of the run.  

The stable yield indicates that the calcium oxide microstructure is stable. A 

confirmation of this comes with the measurement of the very short lived isotopes, 31-33Ar 

after 80 hours of operation. This means that the used settings (650oC and 8x1012 protons 

per pulse) are appropriate to obtain stable CaO release properties, even though the 

temperature was risen to 730oC and 840oC for some hours to do some of the 

measurements. Since there was no degradation of the target release properties, studies with 

higher temperatures and/or proton intensities can be done in the future in order to provide 

better yields for beams delivered to experiments. 

III.3.3 Isotope Release Properties 

The calcium oxide release properties were assessed by measuring delay curves of 
35Ar, on targets CaO#469 and CaO#419 and fitted accordingly with equation (I.2) and the 

results are presented in Table III-6. 

Parameters of the curves obtained at 950oC for target CaO#419 are shown in table 

Table III-6, in which the 35Ar yields dropped to 20% of the initial value during the run. In 

the case of CaO#469 the overall yields are higher, but the release (as can be seen by tr, tf  

and ts in Table III-6) seems to be slower. This shows that the apparent time constants (tr, tf 

and ts) are not easily related to effusion and diffusion phenomena and their time constants. 
Table III-6 - Release time constants obtained by fitting the data with equation (I.2) for target CaO#419 and 
CaO#469 for 35Ar.

In Table III-7, for target CaO#469 the release efficiency of 35Ar increases with the 

temperature. This is to be expected since this should increase the rates of effusion and

diffusion phenomena. For CaO#419, which represents a standard ISOLDE CaO target, the 

release efficiency for 35Ar is 1/5 of that of CaO#469, and it decays over the run to 1/35. For 

the very short lived isotopes, the release efficiency is higher in the case of CaO#469, than 

other targets (CaO#123 and CaO#408). Surprisingly, the same could not be seen for 32Ar.

It is important to note that the ?rel of the isotopes produced by CaO#123 are 

somehow close to the ones produced by CaO#469, at different operation temperatures with 

the exception of 31Ar. Nevertheless, this shows that the good performance of these old 

targets (CaO#123) is possibly related, as explained before, to a better controlled 

microstructure. However degradation of the initial microstructure was experienced due to 

higher operation temperatures. 

III.3.4 Diffusion and Effusion of Isotopes 

Diffusion and effusion parameters can be extracted from the experimental release 

efficiency (equation (I.5)) of isotopes with different half-lives, using a fit of equation 

(I.19). To calculate the diffusion coefficient, the equation (I.17) was used and a particle 

size of 40 nm was considered from the sample S80, considered to be representative of the 

target material (see Table III-4, on page 74).

efficiency obtained through the fitting of the experimental release curves of 35Ar for three different temperatures 
(b) in target CaO#469. 

A representative example of a release curve fit of 35Ar can be seen in Figure III-16 

a). It can be seen that the fitted function does not match the first part of the release curve, 

which normally corresponds to where effusion phenomena is predominant. This induces an 

inconsistency later when obtaining the release efficiency curves, as can be seen in Figure 

III-16 b), where the release efficiency should be higher as higher is the temperature 

because effusion and diffusion rates are faster, improving the release efficiency. This 

especially fails in the case of the release efficiency at 520oC, also confirmed by the values 

in Table III-8.

By comparing the values of µ and calculated D (in Table III-8), one can see that 

there is a logic tendency between the temperatures of 650oC and 730oC, which is not the 

case at 520oC. For the values of v1 and v2 there is no large evolution, whereas these should 

get higher as the temperature is increased. It shows that the difference between the fit and 

the data indeed affects the proper extraction of these parameters.  

The diffusion delay parameter was alternatively deduced from the release 

efficiency by using equations (I.20) and (I.21), neglecting contributions from effusion as 

shown in Table III-9. The values are expected to be lower estimates of µ and D, since all 

losses are assumed to come from diffusion. 
Table III-9 - Obtained diffusion parameters (neglected contribution from effusion) through the release efficiency

By looking at the values of µ in Table III-9, one can see that they are much lower 

than those obtained in Table III-8. The difference results from the disagreement between 

the release efficiencies determined by the two different methods (as seen in the values in 

Table III-9 and Figure III-16). These methods were already applied successfully before 37, 

which can means that a potentially error in the determination of the system efficiency 

might be in play: (i) it was detected that part of the beam was not being totally separated 

and lost in the way before or in the separator; (ii) the ion source efficiency can also be 

another source of the error since it can be overestimated, as seen already in past targets; 

(iii) experimental issues with the extraction and acceleration of the RIB were reported 

throughout the release measurements. All of these can have a strong influence on the 

proper assessment of the release process and efficiencies during the experimental tests. 

Another possible explanation may be related with a slow diffusion process (trapped or very 

slowly released Ar) which is in play (as shown in Table III-9 by the low values ofµ) which 

cannot be resolved by the current model, leading only to apparent diffusion values. 

As expected the yield increases with the temperature, as can be seen in Table III-8.  

This is especially true in the case of diffusion which is the most limiting step, as can be

seen by the orders of diffusion and effusion time constants, v1, v2, and µ at 650oC and 

730oC. 

In the case of 19Ne (T1/2=17.22s), a representative example of a fitted release curve 

is also shown in Figure III-17 a), which fit agrees generally well with the data. The 

resulting release curves show, as expected, in Figure III-17 b), higher efficiencies for 

higher temperatures.

From the Table III-10 one can see that the values of v1 and µ are increasing as the 

temperature increases, showing that temperature has a large influence on both diffusion 

and effusion. In the case of v1 the values are unrealistic because of the rising part on the 

release curve could not be experimentally determined (see Figure III-17 a)) and respective 

tr). 

Calculations about release efficiency, similar to those made in Table III-9, cannot 

be done in the case of 19Ne, since the ion source efficiency was not known. In terms of

high voltage of the extraction and acceleration of the RIB lead to beam losses, leading to a 

lower yield.

The values of D for both Ar and Ne on CaO cannot be compared to published 

figures in the literature. In both cases the release is limited by diffusion, except for the 

cases of the very short lived Ar isotopes, where it is also limited by effusion. Diffusion 

coefficients are in the order of 10-17 m2/s for Neon and 10-18 m2/s for Argon (or between for 

10-20 and 10-19 m2/s) in calcium oxide between 520 and 730oC. This was expected since 

neon is a smaller atom than argon and since they are both noble gases, neon should diffuse 

faster in the same matrix. The values of the diffusion delay time, µ, obtained by E. 

Bouquerel 35, were determined to be 1.79 s-1 for Ar in CaO at 1400oC. This value was taken 

in an old standard CaO target with a grain size at least one to two orders of magnitude 

larger (as discussed before). The diffusion delay time parameter is also compensated by the 

much higher temperature used. Further knowledge about the data treatment and the grain 

size would have to be known at this kind of temperatures for further conclusions. This 

value was also taken considering the equation (I.15), which is not for the spheres 

geometry, but for infinite foils. The diffusion values obtained in this study can also be 

influenced by the proton irradiation generated defects in the crystal structure. The effusion 

delay times obtained by E. Bouquerel 35 are 100 and 10.5 s-1, which are in the same order 

of magnitude of the ones obtained in this work.  

The values of diffusion coefficient of neon in aluminum oxide taken from the 

release fractions in a target for EURISOL 86, that is a close situation (neon in an oxide), 

they were, for the temperatures of 1100oC and 1450oC, 1x10-17 m2/s and 7x10-17 m2/s, 

respectively, which are very close to the ones obtained in this work. Furthermore from the 

diffusion coefficients of helium in a beryllium oxide target operated at ISOLDE 37, which 

is also a noble gas in an oxide, for temperatures between 800oC and 1400oC the diffusion 

coefficients were measured to be 10-13 to 10-14 m2/s, which are still some orders of

magnitude higher than the ones obtained. Since helium is a much smaller atom than neon, 

and both are noble gases, helium diffusion coefficients are expected to be higher. Since the 

matrix in both cases is different further comparisons are not attempted. 

From the calculated diffusion coefficients for 35Ar and 19Ne one can infer Q from 

equation (I.9) and the Arrhenius plot in Figure III-18. The calculated Q values are 

presented in Table III-11 for 35Ar and 19Ne. In the case of 35Ar it is presented only for the 

first method (equation (I.21)).  

 
Figure III-18 - Plot of the ln(D) vs 1/T in order to determine D 0  and Q for 

19Ne and 35Ar (the latter by a different 
method. 

The fit to obtain Q is acceptable since the values of R2 are close to 1 (Table III-11), 

even though there are few data points for each. It can be seen that the values of Q are low 

compared to the global activation energies (not the case of 35Ar – equation (I.21)) obtained 

for diffusion which are generally in the order of hundreds of kJ/mol 48. However in case of 

the diffusion of Ne in GeO2 the reported activation energies in the temperature range of 37 

to 400oC are comprised between 37 to 55 kJ mol-1 which are in the same order of 

magnitude than the ones obtained in this work 48.

19Ne (equation (I.19)) 21 0.999 

 

Despite the disagreement obtained on 35Ar, this is an attempt to take diffusion data 

out of online release curves. More accurate models and methods in terms of diffusion 

coefficients determination exist, but they are out of the scope of this work. Since there is 

no published data for Ar and Ne diffusion on CaO, no comments can be made about the

reliability of this method on this material. One should know that there are other errors 

associated to this method: grain size with direct impact on the values of D, since it is most 

probable, because of the thermal gradients during production and operation that the grain 

size varies. Another source of error can be the operation temperature which is not 

homogeneous throughout the target material. Further attempts in the future should be taken 

to explore and improve this process to study diffusion on target materials.

Chapter IV - Conclusions  

89 

 

IV.1 Conclusions 

From the decomposition of CaCO3 micrometric powder in vacuum (p?1 Pa), at 

temperatures higher than 550oC, a mesoporous and nanometric (?40 nm) powder could be 

obtained. For the same vacuum conditions, the powder crystallite size is lower and the 

surface area is higher as lower is the temperature used in the calcination process. The 

obtained CaO powders proved also to be very reactive in air to H2O and CO2 gases and 

special care was needed to be taken in storage and transport.  

The vacuum sintering studies in nanometric CaO showed that the surface area has a 

net decrease from 1000oC which is accompanied by shrinkage. The kinetic analysis of the 

sintering results points to volume diffusion as controlling mechanism of matter transport 

during sintering at 1000-1200oC. The apparent activation energy was determined to be 155 

kJ mol-1 close to the value of diffusion of Ca in CaO monocrystals, in the literature. From 

this study, one can also conclude that the temperatures used before for the target operation 

at ISOLDE, T&gt;1050oC, degrade the CaO microstructure. 

The CaO target material at ISOLDE-CERN was investigated. Based on the 

synthesis, reactivity and sintering results, changes were proposed for the production, 

operation and handling of the target material. The target was produced and operated at 

lower temperatures (T&lt;800oC) and special care was taken due to the very fast hydration of 

this material. 

The performance of the as produced CaO target material proved to be much higher 

and stable than standard CaO targets. The obtained yields for 31-33,35Ar, 19Ne, 6He, 10,15C 

were higher than recent CaO targets, also higher or equivalent to the old (from 1999) CaO 

targets, and sometimes higher than any other target. No drop of the yields was seen. These 

results showed that choosing synthesis conditions to get a nanometric CaO powder and 

keeping its nanostructure during handling and operation, the release properties could be 

maintained over time. 

By applying a mathematical model taking into account effusion and diffusion 

physical phenomena in the release curves at different temperatures, information on these 

parameters, for 19Ne and 35Ar in CaO, was extracted. As expected the diffusion times are 

much higher than effusion times, and diffusion is limiting most of the release. Diffusion 

coefficients were found to be in the order of 10-17m2/s for Neon and in between 10-20 and

10-18m2/s for Argon in calcium oxide between 520 and 730oC. Activation energies for 

diffusion of Ne in CaO were found to be 21 kJ mol-1 and of Ar in CaO to be 101 kJ mol-1. 

IV.2 Outlook 

A good improvement of the release properties of the calcium oxide as target 

material was achieved with this study. The target material development in this work is not 

only important to ISOLDE, but also for all other ISOL facilities throughout the world. 

Further investigation can still be done to further improve the release properties. 

The improvements on this target material, permitted the WITCH experiment (Weak 

Interation Trap for Charged particles) at ISOLDE to obtain a yield good enough on 35Ar 

and have results with good statistics, which they were attempting, unsuccessfully, for the 

last couple of years. It also improved the yield of the very exotic Ar isotopes which can be 

used for future experiments. 

A nanometric material yet finer can be produced, but the sintering rates of this 

material, since it will be more reactive, have to be assessed before online operation. A 

good balance must be reached in terms of the nanostructured characteristics of the material 

and the temperature of online of operation, since both influences the diffusion times. 

Further studies on the limit operation temperature should be made, in order to keep the 

microstructure over time and tentatively increase the yields. 

In this study, the CaO reactivity in air was only studied in order to prevent it. 

Further studies can still be done in this subject, especially in the kinetics of the reactions in 

air atmosphere, and determine when, with precision, either is the hydration or the 

carbonation reaction predominant. 

The proton intensity used to operate this target was set to be low (8x1012 protons 

per pulse). Studies with higher proton intensities can be done in order to study its influence 

on the release properties and on the degradation of the target material. 

The method to obtain diffusion and effusion times from an online release curve, 

show be further explored in the future, in order to better study effusion and diffusion 

phenomena in target materials at ISOLDE. 

Further improvements can be done in the target container design and in the oven to 

reduce the existent temperature gradient and avoid the creation of different microstructures 

along the material container. 



 
 
 

Chapter IV - Conclusions  

91 

 

The material study done on CaO clearly showed that better and stable isotope 

yields could be obtained, by knowing better how to produce, operate and handle the 

nanostructured material. Similar studies can be done for other oxide materials used at 

ISOLDE, certainly gaining in the release properties.
