Resumo
A pegada humana nos ecossistemas terrestres e a forma como o Homem influencia a sua dinâmica sugerem a necessidade de integrar os esforços de conservação com as actividades humanas para que os primeiros sejam eficazes. É, por regra, aceite que as Áreas Protegidas são uma componente imprescindível numa estratégia de conservação, mas ainda assim insuficiente para a salvaguarda do futuro dos ecossistemas e da biodiversidade. Inúmeras espécies ameaçadas e seus habitats não são abrangidos por Áreas Protegidas ou dependem não apenas destas mas também dos habitats circundantes. Apesar do seu vasto impacte, o Homem soube, por vezes, alterar os ecossistemas de uma forma mais sustentável e até importante do ponto de vista da biodiversidade. De facto, existem áreas em que a influência antropogénica é histórica e foi mantida a um nível de perturbação intermédio, permitindo criar um novo sistema onde as actividades humanas e os processos naturais são interdependentes, maximizando a rentabilidade, a biodiversidade e os interesses culturais aí contidos. Exemplos são os montados e as pseudo-estepes cerealíferas do Alentejo português. Estas paisagens antrópicas são economicamente viáveis, detentoras de um elevado valor paisagístico, cultural e de lazer e ainda ricas em biodiversidade. Fica assim claro que as paisagens modificadas são importantes para a conservação da biodiversidade e que não devem ser abandonadas ou exploradas a níveis de intensidade que destruam o efeito benéfico do nível intermédio de perturbação tradicional. O entendimento de quais os regimes de gestão em que as espécies nativas podem manter populações viáveis é um dos maiores desafios contemporâneos da conservação da natureza. Além de definir os regimes de gestão onde as espécies são capazes de sobreviver, é igualmente importante evitar e/ou conciliar os conflitos que surgem do uso compartilhado do espaço e dos recursos. Os conflitos podem ser particularmente controversos quando os recursos em causa têm valor económico e as espécies envolvidas são legalmente protegidas.
A lontra Euroasiática (Lutra lutra Linnaeus, 1758), cuja distribuição abrange quase toda a região Paleártica, é um carnívoro terrestre na sua essência, mas que se adaptou a ambientes aquáticos (rios, lagos, reservatórios, estuários e águas costeiras), onde se movimenta e alimenta, maioritariamente de peixe.
A lontra, na totalidade da sua distribuição, tem o estatuto de ameaça de "Quase Ameaçada" atribuído pelo IUCN -União Internacional para a Conservação da Natureza (2011). Além disso, está listada em várias convenções internacionais sendo uma espécie estritamente protegida a nível europeu: Anexo II da Convenção de Berna, anexos B-II e B-IV da Directiva Habitats e Anexo IA da Convenção de Washington (CITES). A nível nacional, onde a população de
lontras é aparentemente estável e abundante, a espécie está classificada como "Pouco Preocupante" (2005).
Sendo um predador piscícola amplamente distribuído, mas protegido, a lontra é um bom modelo para abordar conflitos entre a conservação de vertebrados e o uso dos recursos biológicos pelo Homem.
Os ecossistemas de água doce do Mediterrâneo sofrem eventos sazonais de seca no verão e enchentes na estação chuvosa, que variam muito numa escala multi-anual e contribuem para uma elevada variabilidade natural das condições de caudal. As espécies nativas são historicamente resistentes a este sistema altamente variável, mas, cenários de mudança climática futura indicam uma tendência de redução da precipitação global e aumento da variabilidade inter-anual. Este factor de stress é certamente exigente para as populações de lontra e actua sinergeticamente com outras alterações impostas pelo Homem aos ambientes aquáticos. A gestão dos cursos de água e das actividades humanas, certamente influenciam a persistência de água nos leitos na época seca e, consequentemente, a manutenção de populações viáveis de espécies aquáticas, inclusive a lontra, e a sua viabilidade a longo prazo.
As interacções Homem-lontra incluem assim competição por água, nas regiões mais secas, e pelo peixe em áreas de pesca de rio ou de piscicultura.
Em áreas de piscicultura em Portugal, maioritariamente viveiros de trutas em rios da montanha e tanques de criação de peixes marinhos em estuários e rias, os prejuízos causados pela lontra podem influenciar a gestão e os lucros dos piscicultores, pelo que muitas vezes a presença espécie não é apreciada.
Esta dissertação aborda o conflito entre a conservação da lontra e o uso dos recursos biológicos pelo Homem, através da análise e avaliação da: i) distribuição e persistência de lontra numa bacia hidrográfica com escassez natural de água, potencialmente agravada pela acção humana e da ii) predação e prejuízos causados por lontra em áreas de piscicultura marinha, nível de conflito e acções necessárias com vista à reconciliação.
Estuário do Sado e também internacionalmente classificado como: Sítio Natura 2000, parcialmente por causa da presença de lontras; zona de Protecção Especial de Aves; e Sítio Ramsar. É também aqui que está licenciada uma parte significativa das pisciculturas marinhas do país.
Avaliar se a resolução a que são feitos os estudos de distribuição de lontra poderá estar a inspirar um excesso de confiança sobre o estado da população face às ameaças existentes, incluindo a escassez de água em ambientes com linhas de água intermitentes e previsivelmente sujeitos a um aumento das pressões climática e antropogénica, é a primeira questão abordada no âmbito desta dissertação - Tema 1.
Trabalhos recentes em ecologia da paisagem sublinham a importância das considerações de escala em estudos de diversidade biológica e conservação. O IUCN Otter Specialist Group (OSG), com o intuito de padronizar resultados e assim melhor avaliar o efeito conjunto das tendências populacionais de lontra existentes nos vários países onde a espécie ocorre, recomenda o uso da grelha UTM de 10x10 km para aferição das distribuições nacionais da espécie e monitorização das populações. A recente classificação com o estatuto de ameaça de “Pouco Preocupante” em Portugal resulta maioritariamente da ampla distribuição da espécie a nível nacional à escala de 10x10 km e contrasta com o estatuto “Vulnerável” que lhe fora previamente atribuído e que justificava a sua utilização como uma espécie-bandeira na conservação dos ambientes aquáticos. No entanto, ao interpretar a distribuição como continua à escala de resolução de 10x10, o novo estatuto de ameaça pode estar a induzir despreocupação e, como resultado, podem ser ignoradas algumas ameaças a nível regional.
Para avaliar o efeito da escala de resolução nos resultados da distribuição de lontra na bacia do rio Sado esta foi avaliada em ambas as estações, húmida e seca, fazendo variar o tamanho da quadrícula usada para dividir a área a amostrar. Foram efectuadas prospecções utilizando o método aconselhado pelo IUCN OSG (máximo de 600 m prospectados por linha/massa de água considerando a quadrícula positiva para lontra assim que um indício é encontrado) em três escalas de resolução diferentes: 10x10, 5x5, e 2.5x2.5 km (Artigo 1). Os resultados validam a preocupação que originou o estudo. A resolução da escala de amostragem teve efeitos significativos na avaliação da distribuição da lontra com o número de presenças a diminuir com o aumento da resolução da escala de amostragem. Tornou-se claro que não há uma só escala de resolução ou extensão correcta, mas claramente é importante fazer corresponder a resolução aos padrões e processos que estão a ser avaliados. Os dados indicam que, no Alentejo, a lontra distribui-se no ambiente de uma forma só detectável utilizando uma resolução maior do que a
resolução padrão recomendada pelo IUCN OSG. Além disso, as mudanças observadas na ocupação de lontra entre as épocas húmida e seca reforçam a importância dos habitats com água persistente ao longo de todo o ano (ex., os rios maiores e os pêgos que se formam no verão) e da sua gestão cuidada. As alterações climáticas previstas agravarão a época de seca nesta bacia, pelo que a gestão da água é uma questão crucial para todo o ecossistema de água doce do Sado e para a conservação da lontra.
As acções humanas podem influenciar positiva ou negativamente a presença e persistência de lontra numa área. O uso e gestão da água em ribeiras de menor caudal podem alterar drasticamente a resistência natural das linhas de água à seca (ex., captação de água para as culturas). A lontra reproduz-se com maior frequência em habitats complexos e estáveis. Assim, sendo impossível manter água nas linhas de água de menores dimensões (por pressões e uso humano), os esforços de conservação devem concentrar-se nas zonas intermédias da bacia, de forma a assegurar a viabilidade da população local de lontra. Portugal é considerado ter uma das populações de lontra mais viáveis na Europa, sugerindo alargadas responsabilidades e obrigações na conservação da espécie. O recente e inesperado decréscimo abrupto da população de lontras das ilhas Shetland, Escócia (outro local considerado como tendo um a população saudável de lontra) mostra como é importante monitorizar as populações de lontra e suas presas e tentar prever possíveis ameaças.
A resolução padronizada de 10x10 km é útil quando se tenta avaliar a evolução da população europeia ou nacional de lontra mas, com base no presente trabalho, pode ser demasiado optimista quando as decisões de gestão regional/local estão envolvidas e é necessário planeamento para conservação da espécie. A escala de resolução de 10x10 km é eficaz na detecção de mudanças positivas na distribuição, isto é quando a população está em expansão; inversamente, no entanto, pode ser muito lenta na detecção do declínio da população. O argumento é baseado na territorialidade da lontra e na presunção abalizada de que as lontras, em situação de escassez de água, primeiro ocuparão os habitats mais estáveis, ou seja, os rios de ordem superior, onde são também mais facilmente detectadas, dado que a prospecção na quadrícula se inicia normalmente pelos habitats com maior potencialidade de ocupação. No entanto, quando as populações estão em decréscimo, ficarão ausentes primeiros nos habitats de menor qualidade, onde usando uma baixa resolução a ausência é dificilmente detectada. Assim, se apenas usada a escala de 10 x 10 km, a quadrícula pode ser considerada positiva para lontra, mesmo quando as condições dos rios e população de lontra estão em declínio. Se isso ocorrer, a aplicação de medidas de conservação num período de tempo útil e enquanto economicamente eficientes podem ser mais difícil.
Uma abordagem viável para o problema da escala de monitorização evidenciado com o presente trabalho seria identificar áreas onde a espécie é mais vulnerável a ameaças naturais e antrópicas (aplicável também a outras áreas do Mediterrâneo com caudais intermitentes) e avaliar a distribuição de lontra nessas zonas a uma escala mais fina de resolução, e no período mais detrimental (estação seca). Na bacia do Sado a grelha de 2.5x2.5 km parece a escolha mais apropriada para uma subamostra focada no controlo eficaz das populações de lontra, quando são necessárias informações sobre o estado da população local, face a ameaças reais e potenciais, e estão envolvidas decisões de gestão local relativas a linhas de água e habitats ribeirinhos. A subamostragem a escala mais fina deve ser coordenada com a pesquisa a nível nacional, seguindo a metodologia estandardizada do IUCN OSG, que é repetida, na maioria dos países, no máximo a cada 10 anos. O investimento na pesquisa a maior resolução é justificado, no caso do Sado, pela combinação de factores que estão aí a actuar: i) aumento da variabilidade inter-anual e redução da precipitação total, o que prorroga o período de seca; ii) consequentes alterações nas comunidades de presas, na dieta da lontra e na carga de poluição, com efeitos desconhecidos sobre a persistência e viabilidade da população de lontra.
Com o declínio dos stocks populacionais de peixe de todo o mundo, a importância das actividades de aquicultura, em particular naquelas regiões onde os peixes são uma importante fonte de alimento humano, ganhou relevância, tanto em termos económicos como de bem-estar humano (por exemplo, acesso mais fácil e barato aos produtos de peixe), e isso foi reconhecido através dos incentivos da União Europeia a esta actividade económica. Tais incentivos foram aplicados na região do Mediterrâneo, onde as pisciculturas podem ser encontradas tanto em terra como em áreas costeiras. A região, no entanto, também é rica em espécies predadoras de peixe (ex., lontra, corvo-marinho, garças) e, portanto, as pisciculturas são altamente propensas a predação, levando a conflitos entre a produção e os interesses de conservação.
Esta potencialidade para o conflito levou Portugal a ser um dos oito países incluídos num projecto Europeu cujo objectivo foi desenvolver um quadro processual para a elaboração de planos de acção para conciliar os conflitos entre a conservação de grandes vertebrados e o uso dos recursos biológicos (FRAP - Framework for Biodiversity Reconciliation Action Plans -EU Contract EVK2-CT-2002-00142), usando vários tipos de pesca e três espécies piscívoras de predadores vertebrados como casos-modelo. Portugal, a Alemanha e a República Checa analisaram o caso da lontra e da piscicultura.
Abordar o impacte da predação de lontra sobre a piscicultura em Portugal e tentar quantificar os danos específicos causados numa zona de conflito, o estuário do Sado, foram os objectivos do Tema 2 desta dissertação.
Para avaliar o nível de conflito existente em Portugal, foi feito um inventário das explorações piscícolas e, seguidamente, realizadas entrevistas aos proprietários, e algumas visitas a instalações, para avaliar a presença de lontra e a percepção dos danos causados pela espécie (Artigo 2). Os resultados mostraram que a lontra é uma presença frequente em áreas de piscicultura (40% dos resultados positivos para a presença de lontra) e que os piscicultores consideram a sua presença um problema, usando diferentes métodos de protecção e/ou dissuasão (ex. sebes, cães) ou a perseguição directa (tiro, armadilhas, ou veneno) para reduzir o impacte deste predador.
Em Portugal a maior parte da produção em piscicultura é referente a peixes marinhos e feita em estuários e rias, em regimes semi-intensivos, em tanques de terra, muitas vezes anteriormente utilizados para produção de sal. Muitas destas pisciculturas estão localizadas em Áreas Protegidas e a produção é feita com a imposição de algumas regras restritivas, dado o enquadramento numa área classificada. O estuário do Sado alberga uma parte significativa das pisciculturas marinhas de regime semi-intensivo existentes e foi por isso escolhido como área de estudo.
No estudo foram integradas 14 pisciculturas que produzem em policultura de regime semi-intensivo maioritariamente as seguintes espécies: dourada Sparus aurata, robalo Dicentrarchus labrax, e linguado Solea senegalensis e Solea solea.
O objectivo do estudo foi avaliar a frequência com que cada piscicultura foi visitada por lontra, quantificar o consumo de espécies comerciais de peixe (espécies produzidas com investimento financeiro dos piscicultores) por lontra, quantificar os prejuízos causados e analisar a relação da localização da piscicultura como nível de prejuízo.
Durante um ano, a taxa de visitação de lontra (VR = n° de visitas positivas /n° total de visitas; visita positiva = presença de lontra) foi avaliada através da prospecção semanal do perímetro de cada piscicultura por indícios de lontra (e.x. dejectos e pegadas). Os dejectos foram analisados em laboratório para determinação da dieta da lontra. Sempre que possível as presas foram identificadas à espécie e calculado o número mínimo de indivíduos consumidos. Para estimar o tamanho das presas consumidas foram utilizadas rectas de regressão (Artigo 3).
nascer do sol e foram recolhidos dejectos frescos de lontra para análise molecular e identificação genética ao indivíduo com recurso a microssatélites (Artigo 4).
O impacte da predação da lontra (prejuízos) em cada piscicultura foi avaliado através da combinação da percentagem de consumo de espécies produzidas, do consumo médio de uma lontra por dia (peso ingerido), das taxas de visitação e do número de lontras a utilizar cada piscicultura (Artigo 4).
Foram também analisados, através de Regressão Linear Múltipla, os factores de paisagem com influência nos danos causados para identificar os factores-chave para o nível de prejuízo (Artigo 4).
Os resultados indicam que o conflito tem uma base ecológica, embora existam grandes diferenças entre a predação real e a percepção da mesma. Na maioria das pisciculturas os resultados indicam elevadas taxas de visitação por lontra (média: 76%), embora em apenas 29% as espécies produzidas tenham sido as presas mais consumidas. Outras espécies marinhas e de água doce foram as presas base da dieta de lontra nas pisciculturas restantes.
Dados ecológicos sugerem que o linguado é a principal presa em termos de biomassa para as lontras no estuário do Sado. A disponibilidade de linguado fora das pisciculturas sugere que as lontras estão a capturá-lo também no estuário. No entanto, não foi possível confirmar se estes são capturados maioritariamente fora ou dentro das pisciculturas. Ainda assim, como essa espécie não representa uma parte significativa da produção de peixe, esta perda por predação não está a ameaçar a viabilidade económica da actividade.
As perdas na produção de peixe variaram entre 0.01 e 0.30% para dourada, entre 0.03 e 0.11 % para robalo, e entre 1.04 e 28.20% para linguado. O impacte da predação por lontra no total da área de produção, tendo em conta a densidade dos stocks, de peixe nos tanques, a taxa média de visitação por lontra e a densidade local obtida para a espécie, representa unicamente 0.60% da produção total. Os resultados mostram, assim, que o impacte da lontra não é importante a nível da área de estudo, mas varia entre pisciculturas e pode ser de importante ao nível da produção de estabelecimentos específicos.
Esta situação sugere que diferentes soluções devem ser recomendadas para cada piscicultura, promovendo o uso de medidas de mitigação nas explorações em que os prejuízos são elevados, e investindo em actividades educativas sobre aqueles em que os prejuízos não são significativos, mas percepcionados como tal. Embora isto possa ser visto como a abordagem mais eficaz para resolver o conflito na perspectiva ecológica, pode ser inaceitável em termos sociais.
No actual cenário ambiental e económico, a predação por lontra em áreas de piscicultura deve ser visto como um verdadeiro problema de conservação e gestão, sendo essencial desenvolver estratégias capazes de proporcionar uma efectiva reconciliação deste conflito (Artigo 5).
A questão da predação nas pisciculturas do Estuário do Sado poderá ser responsável por um conflito social notoriamente bipolarizado em torno de dois grupos-chave. Por um lado os piscicultores estão cientes da existência de predação por lontra e utilizam meios, por vezes ilegais, para manter as lontras à distância. Por outro lado, os técnicos e gestores da Reserva Natural do Estuário do Sado, a autoridade responsável pela gestão da área protegida, também estão cientes da predação, bem como da fragilidade do sistema de fiscalização e controle de acções ilegais decorrentes da proibição do uso da maioria das medidas para prevenir a predação dentro da reserva.
Como consequência do projecto FRAP, as partes interessadas consideram que é importante encontrar novas soluções e aumentar o diálogo entre os diferentes intervenientes, mas também chegar a acordo sobre a existência de uma incerteza significativa sobre a capacidade de colocar em acção novos instrumentos de gestão (por exemplo, medidas de redução da predação).
Recomendamos que os piscicultores sejam autorizados a utilizar cercas eléctricas em torno das lagoas de produção, para evitar a predação, talvez até mesmo quando os prejuízos reais não são elevados, uma vez que este não terá um grande efeito sobre a população de lontra, razoavelmente bem distribuída e aparentemente abundante, que habita a área.
O caminho a seguir é o de promover orientações sobre melhores práticas que irão aumentar a conscientização sobre a necessidade de conservação da biodiversidade e impedir as operações que teriam um impacte adverso sobre a população de lontras e outros valores da vida selvagem importante. A piscicultura, especificamente em regime semi-intensivo, é conciliável com a conservação, se algumas medidas de gestão forem tomadas em termos de salvaguarda do ambiente e do desenvolvimento da actividade.
produtos, ganhando vantagens competitivas no mercado. Neste contexto de dificuldades económicas, é mais difícil para os piscicultores entender a necessidade de preservar a lontra, que sentem como uma ameaça à sua actividade económica, por causar prejuízos. Tendo isso em mente, bem como a necessidade de conciliar esta actividade económica com a conservação, esta é uma boa oportunidade para a criação de um esquema destinado a promover a sustentabilidade ecológica e económica da piscicultura no estuário, como por exemplo a criação de um sistema de rotulagem de peixe de "produção sustentável". A eco-rotulagem e os esquemas de certificação começaram recentemente a ser usados em aquacultura e poderão ser uma opção.
A lontra, como os golfinhos, têm uma imagem pública popular no estuário do Sado. A educação ambiental pode contribuir para mudar a atitude para com as lontras. Se os piscicultores considerarem a protecção da lontra como um estorvo na produção de peixe, o objectivo simples de protecção será colocado em risco. Idealmente os piscicultores devem ser capazes de valorizar a existência da espécie, mesmo que medidas de mitigação devam ser aplicadas para evitar que cause prejuízos. Isto pode ser conseguido quando os sistemas de certificação associados às questões ambientais são implementados, como mencionado acima, ou aumentando o potencial para o desenvolvimento de novas actividades paralelas, como resultado da presença de uma biodiversidade elevada (por exemplo, turismo de natureza).

Summary
The Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra), a protected predator, competes with man for water, in drier regions, and for fish in important fish rearing areas. This thesis addresses man-otter conflicts, by examining: i) otter distribution and persistence in a waterscape facing natural water shortage, yet aggravated by human activities; and ii) otter damages in fish rearing areas, to further understand the level of conflict and of reconciliation needed.
The IUCN Otter Specialist Group recommends a standardized 10x10 km UTM grid for monitoring otter distribution and trends. As a result of the national survey, otters were downgraded to a “Least Concern” category in the 2005 Portuguese Red Data Book. However, by interpreting a continuous distribution at the coarse 10x10 km resolution, serious threats to local otter populations, like climate change and increased water scarcity, may be overlooked. To assess the effect of survey resolution, otter distribution in the Sado river basin was evaluated at three scale resolutions (10x10, 5x5, and 2.5x2.5 km). Results confirmed that even though otters were widely distributed, the 10x10 grid cell protocol is too optimistic and misleading when local management decisions are involved and conservation planning is needed. A monitoring protocol is suggested to improve conservation management in Mediterranean areas of intermittent water flow.
Many Portuguese fish farms are located in estuarine protected areas. The degree of conflict between otter conservation and fish farming was assessed at Sado river estuary by using otter visiting rates to fish farms and the otter consumption of commercial fish. Otter damage was assessed by combining the percentage of consumption of reared species with otter daily food consumption, daily visitation rates and number of otters visiting each fish farm. Landscape descriptors were analyzed to identify key landscape factors for damage. Results indicate high visiting rates to most fish farms although in only a few commercial fish were the most consumed prey. Distance to streams and refuge cover areas were identified as key landscape features to damages. This information can be used as a management tool in landscape planning as high risk farms can be identified and selectively protected, diminishing other hostile actions towards the otter.

I.1.	Wildlife conservation in humanised landscapes
Human beings have influenced ecosystems for many millennia. Anthropogenic influences, including ancestral uses of the land (Foster et al. 2003), affect most ecological communities and progressively have become an integral dynamic of many ecosystems (Koh &amp;amp; Gradner 2010).
A quantitative evaluation of human impacts on the landscape revealed that 83% of the land’s surface is directly influenced by human beings (Sanderson et al. 2002). Efforts to improve human welfare have led to landscapes and ecosystems worldwide being extensively modified to increase food supplies and reduce exposure to natural dangers (Kareiva et al. 2007). Some areas suffered rapid and/or intense changes that did not allow the systems to adapt. Those areas are dramatically and negatively impacted with a consequent decrease in species richness. Nevertheless, landscapes changed by man can also have significant biodiversity and conservation interest as sometimes Man has managed to alter the landscapes in a sustainable and biodiversity wise interesting way. Thus, systems that have had a long history of anthropogenic disturbance but at a low enough level that the human dynamics have become part of the day to day ecosystem dynamics, maintain high species richness and even conservation interest values. These ecosystems, henceforth referred to as conservation value human shaped ecosystems (following Bugalho et al. 2011), are interdependent on human activities and natural processes and their preservation is important. If suddenly depopulated by humans or submitted to significant changes in the intensity and area of human activities, the systems will change into something different and possibly less biodiversity and/or culturally-rich (Bugalho et al. 2011). Conservationists need therefore to consider and manage conservation issues in these modified systems that are now changing even faster than before.
Human shaped systems can be found worldwide but Europe, due to its long history of humanisation, is prone of such examples as described below.
The Mediterranean area, where several societies have managed the natural ecosystems and its resources, and shaped its current landscape diversity, is a notable example for conservation value human shaped ecosystems (Blondel 2006, Bugalho et al. 2011). Forest management through wood-cutting, controlled burning, plant domestication and cultivation, livestock farming, grazing, as well as water management and terracing, have been the main drivers of growth of Mediterranean civilizations for centuries (Blondel 2006). This resulted in the establishment of long-term, stable, and sustainable agro-silvo-pastoral ecosystems. The contemporary Montado in Portugal (Dehesa in Spain), and especially the cork-oak (Quercus suber) montado, is an area where forest product harvesting, livestock rearing, and agriculture
are pursued simultaneously. Traditionally, cork oak montados are low-input management systems. Cork is manually harvested from living trees once every 9-12 years. A shifting rotation is generally practiced, where shrubs are cleared each 4-7 years to reduce the risk of fire and to promote the establishment of grazing fields or annual crops (Pinto-Correia 2000). This rotation has created a mosaic of land uses and habitat types that coexist and support a diversity of animal and plant species with high conservation value (Bugalho et al. 2011), like the Iberian imperial eagle (Aquila adalberti). The Montados have shown remarkable stability, biodiversity, and sustained productivity for more than 800 years. At the regional scale extent, the relationship between tree density and mean annual precipitation suggests that the structure of these human shaped systems is controlled by edaphic and climatic factors. Such an adjustment over the long term corresponds to an optimal functional adaptation between water demand and supply. This is particularly important as water shortage has always been a vital issue in the history of Mediterranean peoples (Blondel 2006). The cork oak montados of the western Mediterranean Basin are recognized as well-adapted biodiversity-rich cultural landscapes, with high scenic and recreational value. They can also be considered economically viable multipleuse agro-ecosystems that promote sustainable modern development in many farming areas of the Mediterranean Basin (Santos-Reis &amp;amp; Correia 1999, Blondel 2006, Rosalino et al. 2009, Bugalho et al. 2011). Additionally, cork oak montados are protected under the Habitats Directive (Council Directive 92/43/EEC), included in several areas of the Pan-European network of protected areas Natura 2000 (www.natura.org) and the Mediterranean Basin is one of the world’s biodiversity “hotspots” (Myers et al. 2000, Brooks et al. 2006; Lopez-Lopez et al. 2011).
Another example of conservation value human shaped ecosystem is the pseudosteppes, low-intensity farming systems that, in the Iberian Peninsula, hold a large proportion of species with unfavourable conservation status (Suarez et al. 1997, Tucker 1997). The most common pseudosteppe in western Spain and Portugal is the cereal steppe, created in flat, open landscapes by the extensive cultivation of cereals on a rotational basis, resulting in a mosaic of cereal fields, stubbles, ploughed and fallow land (usually used as sheep pastures) (Suarez et al. 1997, Moreira 1999). Cereal steppes constitute a stronghold for several threatened bird species, such as the great bustard, Otis tarda L., the little bustard, Tetrax tetrax L., the sandgrouse, Pterocles spp. and the lesser kestrel, Falco naumanni Fleischer (Tucker &amp;amp; Heath 1994, Suarez et al. 1997). The present Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union promotes the maintenance of such farmed landscapes through agri-environmental regulation based on the compensation of farmers for maintaining agricultural practices allowing the conservation of threatened species (Delgado &amp;amp; Moreira 2000). The agri-environmental program implemented
in 1995 over an extension of 64,000 ha in Southern Portugal, mostly within the Municipality of Castro Verde, is one good example. The bird diversity of the farmed landscape of Castro Verde depends on the maintenance of a diverse agricultural mosaic, as promoted by the extensive cultivation of cereals in a rotational system (Delgado &amp;amp; Moreira 2000). However, research conducted in several Mediterranean areas indicates that most populations of steppe birds are currently experiencing population declines associated with intensification of traditional agricultural practices (Marta-Pedroso et al. 2007).
Further examples of conservation value human shaped ecosystems are found in the lake regions in central Europe (e.g., Germany, the Czech Republic and Austria) where man-made fishponds, used to raise carp (Cyprinus carpio), have a long history that can be traced back to the 13th century. These regions are large interconnected lake areas where the ponds appear to be almost natural structures providing habitat to many aquatic and terrestrial species (Gossow &amp;amp; Kranz 1998). Some lake areas are even classified as Biosphere Reserves. One good example is the Trebon Basin Biosphere Reserve, located in South Bohemia in the Czech Republic near the Austrian border. The region has been modified by human activities for more than eight centuries. This semi-natural landscape is comprised of 460 artificial fishponds and lakes that were constructed in the 15th and 16th centuries and now constitutes the centre of Czech fishfarming industry. The Trebon fishponds and peatlands are also listed among wetlands of international importance within the Ramsar Convention and the biosphere reserve is also classified as a European Important Bird Area (IBA), providing suitable habitats and food sources both for nesting and migratory birds (e.g., ducks, geese, white-tailed eagle). The main economic activities of the 26,000 inhabitants of the biosphere reserve are agriculture, forestry, fish-farming, the extraction of sand, gravel and peat and light industry (www.unesco.org). Another example is the Oberlausitzer Heide-und Teichlandschaft, also a Biosphere Reserve and Germany’s largest pond region. It is characterized by a vast diversity of habitats in a small area, with ponds located next to sandy dunes, and hence holding high species diversity. Approximately 10,000 people live in the area and maintain this unique man-made landscape by combining sustainable agriculture, forestry, fishery, tourism and industry (www.unesco.org).
The extent to which people have dominated the biosphere (terrestrial, freshwater, and marine environments) suggests that a sensible approach is to integrate conservation efforts with human activities (Koh &amp;amp; Gradner 2010). It is generally accepted that strictly protected areas provide a necessary, yet insufficient, component of a broader strategy to safeguard the future of the world’s biota. Approximately one quarter of the world’s threatened species live outside protected areas (Rodrigues et al. 2004). It is clear that modified landscapes are an important
asset for biodiversity conservation and should not be abandoned or explored to yet further levels of intensification (Koh &amp;amp; Gradner 2010, Bugalho et al. 2011). Human activities are important components of ecosystems, and understanding how natural values persist given extensive human use is important (Palmer et al. 2004). Furthermore, understanding how native species can maintain viable populations in modified landscapes, and under which management regimes, is one of the greatest challenges currently facing conservation biologists (Fischer &amp;amp; Lindenmayer 2007).
I.2.	Human-wildlife conflict framework
The examples of anthropogenically-integrated ecosystems given in the previous section are, however, not the common pattern of the human footprint on natural ecosystems (Sanderson et al. 2002). Moreover, where humans and wildlife co-exist in close proximity, conflicts are often unavoidable. In addition to the well-known and on-going problems of wildlife damage to agricultural crops (e.g., rodents, wild boar, birds) and the problems caused by commensal rodents, birds, and also snakes in urban and rural areas, new concerns for management of wildlife conflicts have emerged in recent years (Fall &amp;amp; Jackson 2002). These include problems arising from the success of efforts to recover endangered or extirpated species populations (e.g., wolves Canis lupus in Alasca, USA), the global expansion and increased recognition of wildlife-borne diseases (e.g., avian influenza, worldwide), the increased recognition of environmental damage caused by invasive or alien species (e.g., Asian clam Corbicula fluminea in Europe), and the growing problems with wildlife in residential areas (e.g., stone martens Martes foina in Luxemburg) (Fall &amp;amp; Jackson 2002, Herr 2008). Nevertheless, with the increasing awareness of the importance of biodiversity value, attitudes have been changing, favouring the conservation of wildlife and safeguard of viable populations of endangered species, and allowing the creation of legal and institutional frameworks to conserve wildlife. Concomitantly, dedicated conservation work has, for some species and areas, been successful. Rare or locally extinct wildlife species have recovered towards their previous abundance and reclaimed areas from which they were exterminated, or even occupy new habitats, reigniting old conflicts between humans and wildlife or creating new ones (e.g., recovery of the Asian lion Panthera leo persica in India). As a consequence conflicts between humans and wildlife and the use of biological resources are on the rise in many parts of Europe and throughout the World (Ring et al. 2008).
Human-wildlife conflicts are a growing global problem, and not restricted to particular geographical regions or climatic conditions, but common to all areas where wildlife and human population coexist and share resources (Distefano 2005). A set of global trends has contributed to the escalation of human-wildlife conflicts: human population growth; land use transformation; species habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation; growing interest in ecotourism and increasing access to nature reserves; increasing livestock populations and competitive exclusion of wild herbivores; declining abundance and distribution of wild prey; increasing wildlife population as a result of conservation programmes; climatic factors and stochastic events (Woodroffe 2000, Distefano 2005). The conflicts can be particularly
controversial when the resources concerned have economic value and the animals involved are legally protected.
Human-wildlife conflicts in developing countries are somewhat different than those occurring in developed countries. Competition between rural communities and wild animals over natural resources is more intense in developing countries, where local human populations tend to suffer higher costs but also where most endangered wildlife still exists. Here conflicts undermine human welfare, health, and safety, and have high financial costs for individuals and society (Distefano 2005). On the other hand, these conflicts are becoming a threat to the survival of many globally endangered species; e.g.; elephants (Loxodonta africana) in Africa for crop raiding (Naughton-Treves 1997); the Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae) for human attacks (Nyhus &amp;amp; Tilson 2004); the Asian lion for the use of the extensive plantations of sugarcane and mango as favourable habitat (Vijayan &amp;amp; Pati 2002); the snow leopard (Uncia uncia) in India for killing livestock (Mishra et al. 2003); the red colobus monkey (Procolocus kirkii) for the consumption of coconuts in Zanzibar (Siex &amp;amp; Struhsaker 1999); jaguars (Panthera onca) and pumas (Puma concolor) for cattle depredation in South-America (Naughton-Treves et al 2003) and bats, lemurs, and turtles used as bushmeat in Madagascar (Jenkins &amp;amp; Racey 2008).
Human-wildlife conflicts in developed countries are more linked to economic losses (Distefano 2005, Graham et al 2005). Many wild animals kill prey species that humans hunt, harvest or farm for consumption or recreation. Wolf, Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) and bear (Ursus spp.) predation of sheep and ungulate game species (e.g., Cervus spp.) in Europe and North America, is a commonly used example (Graham et al 2005). Avian predators prey on game species: hen harriers (Circus cyaneus) and peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) on red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus) in the United Kingdom (Thirgood et al. 2000); raptors (e.g. Buteo buteo) on pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) and grey partridge (Perdix perdix) in France, England and Sweden (Kenward 2001); and red kites (Milvus milvus) on European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in Spain (Villafuerte et al. 1998). Smaller carnivore species (e.g., red fox Vulpes vulpes) have also long been involved in competition with humans over game species, crops, apiaries, and poultry (Treves &amp;amp; Karanth 2003). Predator control is widely used in small game management for improving reproduction success and reducing natural mortality rates of harvested populations (Virgos &amp;amp; Travaini 2005). This management practice is, however, a human-wildlife conflict in itself as there are concerns, from the conservation society, that excessive control may be detrimental to predator populations (Beja et al. 2009).
Human-wildlife conflicts also occur in urban areas. Stone martens in Central Europe often climb under the bonnet of parked cars and strip cables, wiring, and insulation causing substantial damage (Kruuk 2002). In some German towns, raccoons (Procyon Lotor) occur at high densities and in addition to being a health hazard (e.g., rabies), raid fruit trees, devastate gardens, and damage roof insulation when using attics as dens for cub-rearing (Herr 2008). Also, the red fox is among the most successful of non-domesticated carnivores to have established breeding populations in urban areas and they occasionally attack or prey on pets (Herr 2008). In North America, most damage to households is caused by mice, squirrels (Sciuridae), raccoons, and moles (Talpidae) (Herr 2008).
The value of fish for humans and wildlife is also a trigger for conflict. Fish predators like herons, cormorants, otters, seals and dolphins compete with humans by eating species of interest to, or reared by, man (Skaren 1990, Trindade 1991, Kloskowski 2000, 2005a, Lekuona 2002, Silva et al. 2002, Carss 2003, Opacak et al. 2004, Quick et al. 2004, Freitas et al. 2007, Brotons et al. 2008, Klenke et al. in press). Cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo) and grey herons (Ardea cinerea) have a high impact on fish farming in southwest France (Lekuona 2002) and harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) and grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) predate frequently on marine salmon farms in Scotland (Quick et al. 2004). Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra) preying on carp production ponds in Central Europe is another example of a widely recognized conflict (Bodner 1995a,b, Gossow &amp;amp; Kranz 1998, Kloskowski 2000, 2005b, Adamek et al. 2003, Lanszki &amp;amp; Molnar 2003, Leblanc 2003, Jacobsen 2005, Polednik 2005, Schwerdtner &amp;amp; Gruber 2007, Klenke et al. in press) occurring inclusively in Biosphere Reserves.
In Portugal, concerns with wildlife are mostly related to general conservation issues and environmental impact assessment of infrastructures such as highways, dams, wind farms and tourist enterprises. Conflicts also relate to predators (carnivores and birds of prey) and their effect on small game species, such as European rabbit, and attacks on henhouses and pigeonries (Martins 2009). Nevertheless, there are also some species specific human-wildlife conflicts. The best known example is that of the Iberian wolf (C. lupus signatus). Some packs of wolves still exist in the north of the country where wild prey are scarce and complains about wolf attacks on cattle, mostly sheep are common (Petrucci-Fonseca et al. 2000). Another example relates to otters and their predation on farmed fishes, namely, brown and rainbow trout (Salmo truta fario and Oncorhincus mykiss) that are raised in concrete tanks in fishfarms located in northern rivers, and marine fish species, like sea bream (Sparus aurata) and sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), raised in estuarine earthponds (Trindade 1991).
Historical attempts to manage conflicts with predators have involved decisions that were biased towards social and economic values of stakeholders which, in many cases, have led to a range of negative effects on predator populations (Berger et al. 2001). However, as conservation issues increasingly gain importance and changing attitudes favour non-lethal approaches to wildlife management, a shift, from decisions based primarily on economic interests to those based on reconciling the ecological and socio-political interests, is occurring (Graham et al. 2005). Reconciliation implies managing the competition between people and wildlife (Ring et al. 2008) and requires a comprehensive approach that includes field surveys of the target species, the identification of local human interests, and the recognition of the need for cooperation across political lines (Graham et al. 2005). Attempts to reconcile conflicts are usually developed on a case-by-case approach. As a consequence reconciliation activities differ greatly among conflicts and among countries both in approaches followed and in their successes and failures. Many of the measures taken are preventive measures but mitigation measures are also being developed and applied.
Many preventive measures involve the use of artificial or natural barriers to exclude wildlife from the area or resource of interest. In Africa, effective Acacia bush corrals are used for cattle to prevent depredation during the night time (Ogada et al. 2003). In India, apart from walls, some corrals also have a chain-link ceiling to prevent leopards (Pantherapardus) from jumping into the enclosures; the villagers consider this anti-predator management technique very significant in reducing livestock kills (Vijayan &amp;amp; Pati 2002). In addition to more conventional types of fences, beehive fences have also proved effective at deterring elephants and may have a role to play in alleviating farmer-elephant conflict in Kenya. Additionally, the harvesting of honey also improves crop production and enhances rural livelihoods through honey sales (King et al 2011). Electric fencing can be considered as a more sophisticated solution. In Namibia, electric fencing is an effective strategy in reducing human-elephant conflicts (O'Connel-Rodwell et al. 2000).
Other more original and conflict-specific measures have also been reported. In India, official government statistics showed that in 1902 as many as 1046 people were killed by tigers (Panthera tigris); elsewhere scientists have reported a minimum of 189 tiger attacks on people between 1979 and 1984 (Kruuk 2002). Today man-eater cats are shot before their depredations become extensive but other protective measures have also been allegedly successful. Highly-charged electrified dummies of people have been installed in problem areas and, as tigers usually attacked people from behind, people started wearing face masks on the back of their necks when out in the woods; the number of people killed dropped considerably since the introduction of these measures (Kruuk 2002).
The fladry barrier, hanging flags from ropes, placed a short distance from the floor and not far apart, was a technique traditionally used in Eastern Europe and Russia to lead and hunt wolves that is nowadays used to protect domestic animals from wolf attacks (Musiani et al. 2003). The use of livestock-guarding dogs appears to be a successful strategy for diminishing predation risk from coyotes (Canis latrans), black bears (Ursus americanus) and even cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), but less effective with wolves and grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) (Treves &amp;amp; Karanth 2003). In North America dogs are often left alone to safeguard domestic animals and are not as effective as in Europe, namely Portugal. Here, the dogs are raised since pups with the sheep and regard them as pack, being very protective of them. Also, shepherds work directly with their dogs that are usually not left alone to safeguard, although they wear a spiky collar to protect the neck in case of confrontation with a wolf (Ribeiro &amp;amp; Petrucci-Fonseca 2005).
These are some examples of a myriad of measures that go from dramatic actions of relocating local communities to areas offering better access to natural resources and socio-economic opportunities (Treves &amp;amp; Karanth 2003) to simply good standards of waste management to avoid attracting wild animals to human settlements and to prevent wild populations being augmented and artificially sustained (Distefano 2005).
When preventive measures are not easy or effective, and the conflict carries significant economic costs to humans, compensation measures are sometimes put to place to relieve the conflict by reimbursing people for their losses. An example is the case of otter damages in Upper Lusatia, Germany, one of the biggest pond regions in Europe, where fish farming has a tradition of more than 750 years (Schwerdtner &amp;amp; Gruber 2007). Because the otter is a protected species under European and national laws, and in order to raise the acceptance of the species and to prevent illegal killing, the state uses damage compensation schemes as an instrument to reimburse fish farmers for their economic losses (Schwerdtner &amp;amp; Gruber 2007). In Austria, where government compensation is paid for confirmed otter damage (ex post facto compensation scheme), and where a highly skilled team establishes the cause and the extent of damage, annual amounts paid in 1995 reached the equivalent of almost 164 000€ (Bodner 1998). In Portugal there is also an ex post facto compensation scheme for damages caused by Iberian wolf (Law 90/88, August 13th 1988) that is supervised and controlled by the Portuguese Institute for Nature and Biodiversity Conservation. This is the only compensation scheme existing in Portugal.
Other innovative measures are being evaluated in Africa and Asia, and include livestock and crop insurances, which require villagers and local governing bodies to pay a premium share of the insurance and allow rural inhabitants to pay a minimum annual cost and to be reimbursed of
damages in the event of crop or livestock losses. In addition, the local governing bodies or the forest department are relieved of significant financial expenses, from not having to administer compensation schemes (Distefano 2005).
Some incentive programmes are also being used. These are based on subsidies to balance the cost of conservation and the adoption of conservation-friendly practices to create tolerance towards wildlife through the exchange of benefits. In India, in snow leopard territory, a programme succeeded in reducing the forage overlap between wild herbivores and livestock through the clearance of 500 ha from grazing and other human use. The villagers received financial benefits for their loss of herding land and the money was used for collective work; as a consequence, wild herbivore densities increased, resulting in more naturally available prey for predators and thus reducing the pressure of carnivores on livestock (Mishra et al. 2003).
Controlled hunting is a low cost technique that has the potential to raise public tolerance towards wildlife. The money raised from the sale of licences can fund conservation activities and the protection of human settlements. To be viewed as a legitimate management practice, hunting should to be based on scientific monitoring of population sizes that ensures sustainable harvests and regulated by policies that address the timing, location, and methods of hunting, as well as the distribution of benefits to all stakeholders (Treves &amp;amp; Karanth 2003).
Finally, translocation of a certain number of animals from problem zones is usually not effective as there is the risk of exporting the problem to another site, although it may be a practical and acceptable approach in some cases and where there is the availability of suitable habitat (Treves &amp;amp; Karanth 2003).
Such broad environmental, human health and safety, economic, and social impacts suggest that governments, wildlife managers, scientists and local communities need to recognize existing human-wildlife conflicts and adopt measures to resolve them in the interest of human and environmental well-being (Distefano 2005). Surprising solutions that allow people and wildlife to coexist have been revealed, and investing resources to reclaim a more balanced relationship with the natural world and conserve across the gradient of human influence is a worthwhile goal (Sanderson et al. 2002)
I.3.	Thesis Rational, Structure and Aims
As illustrated previously, humans have had long term influences on ecosystems. Unmodified landscapes and “pristine” areas are rare particularly in Europe. Because nature reserves and protected areas do not encompass most protected species, modified landscapes that constitute most of the land surface are very important for wildlife conservation.
Examples given in previous sections show that anthropogenically-altered landscapes can be economically viable and yet biodiversity-rich cultural landscapes, with high scenic and recreational value. Retaining viable species populations in modified landscapes is a tough contemporary challenge because human-wildlife conflicts are often unavoidable.
Aside from defining management regimes where species are able to strive, it is equally important to avoid and/or reconcile the conflicts that arise from the shared use of space and resources.
The Eurasian otter, a widely distributed but protected predator, was considered a good example to address human-wildlife conflicts as it lives in waterscapes and eats mainly fish. Man-otter interactions include competition for water, in drier regions, and for fish in important fishing or fish rearing areas.
In the Mediterranean basin, water ecosystems inherently suffer seasonal events of summer drying and wet season flooding, which vary markedly on a multi-annual scale and contribute to a high natural variability of flow conditions (Magalhães et al. 2007). Native aquatic species are historically resistant to these harsh and highly variable systems but, scenarios of future climate change indicate a trend towards reduced overall precipitation and increased inter-annual variability (Santos &amp;amp; Miranda 2006, Hall et al. 2008, Kundzewicz et al 2008, Bloschl &amp;amp; Montanari 2010) which, aggravated by increasing demands for water by agricultural, industrial, and tourist activities (Rodríguez-Diáz &amp;amp; Topcu 2010), may have extensive impacts on Mediterranean freshwater ecosystems (Magalhães et al. 2007, Cianfrani et al. 2011). In the southern Portuguese river basins, where rivers commonly have an intermittent water regime and form water pools in summer, some fish species may already be living at the edge of their tolerance limits due to anthropogenic impacts like river impoundment (water removal and transfer, and dams), water quality deterioration (pollution, eutrophication, acidification), the spread of exotic fish species, and habitat degradation and fragmentation (Collares-Pereira &amp;amp;
Cowx 2004). Here, water and river management and human activities surely influence the viable maintenance of many water related species, including the otter.
In fish farm areas, trout farms in mountain streams and marine fish farms in estuaries, otter damages may influence management and profits and fish farmers often do not welcome the species presence. The shortage of water in summer and the shared use of fish by humans and otters have set therefore the stage for conflict.
This thesis addresses man-otter conflicts, by examining and evaluating: i) otter distribution and persistence in a waterscape facing natural water shortage, yet aggravated by human activities; and ii) otter damages in fish rearing areas, to further understand the level of conflict and of reconciliation needed.
Lawton et al. (1994) suggested that the abundance of a species and the size of the area over which they are found were not independent. Species with greater distributions tend to have greater local abundances (Brown 1984, Gaston &amp;amp; Lawton 1990, Gaston 1994, 1996, Warren &amp;amp; Gaston 1997). This positive relationship has a long history but is still not well understood (Hartley 1998, Gaston et al. 1998). Species that extend over wide ranges tend to have large niche breadths, and presumably some adaptive advantage over species having narrower niches. Otters, being restricted to aquatic environments and eating mainly fish, are considered to have narrow niche breadths, at least by the classical measures. From these observations, an apparent contradiction emerges between currently accepted theory and empirical observations. Data from Portugal demonstrated a very wide distribution of otters (Trindade et al. 1998). How can this be so if otters have narrow niche breadths? Is the distribution of otters scale dependent in a way that leads us to believe that otters have wider tolerances than they really do? Do coarse resolution assessments provide misleading information and inspire overconfidence about population status in the face of existing threats, including water persistence in intensively unstable stream water regimes? This is the first issue that will be addressed in the framework of this thesis - Theme 1. The Sado River basin, located in the Southwest of Portugal in a typically Mediterranean setting, characterized by an intermittent water regime and facing high water agriculture demands, was chosen for a multi-scale analysis of otter distribution.
Conflicts between the conservation of large vertebrates and the use of biological resources are common and affect many species and activities. Among acknowledged conflicts, those between fisheries and fish-eating predators are one of the most often addressed (Skaren 1990, Trindade 1991, Kloskowski 2000, 2005a,b, Lekuona 2002, Silva et al. 2002, Carss 2003, Opacak et al. 2004, Quick et al. 2004, Freitas et al. 2007, Brotons et al. 2008, Klenke et al. in press, Vaclavikova et al. 2010). For a quarter of century, fish farming has been the world's fastest
growing food production sector, sustaining an annual growth rate of 8.8% since 1970 (FAO 2007). In southern European areas, fish consumption to meet human needs reaches the highest levels in Europe (Welch et al. 2002) and inland and coastal fish farms are numerous. Otter damage in Central European fish pond areas have been intensely studied but relatively little work has been done in southern European countries, namely in Portugal where the healthy otter population is likely to increase the chances of conflict. This potentiality for conflict between the use of biological resources (farmed fishes) and conservation of a large vertebrate, leaded Portugal to be one of the eight countries included in an European project to develop a procedural framework for action plans to reconcile conflicts between the conservation of large vertebrates and the use of biological resources, using fisheries and fish-eating vertebrates as a model case (FRAP - Framework for Biodiversity Reconciliation Action Plans - EU Contract EVK2-CT-2002-00142).
Are interactions between the Eurasian otter, a protected species, and the exploitation of biological resources raising conflicts with humans, namely fish farmers in Portugal? Is the stakeholders’ perception of damages real? Can damage surrogates be defined to be used as a management tool? This is the second and most extensively issue that will be addressed in this thesis - Theme 2. To set the conflict scene, a nation-wide inquiry of fish farmers was first conducted, but survey efforts were then concentrated in river Sado estuary, a wildlife-rich protected area (Sado Estuary Nature Reserve) that includes otters (Trindade et al. 1998).
Lessons learned from the pattern of otter distribution at river Sado Basin and the species interactions with fish farmers and farms at the river estuary, allowed the definition of guidelines and recommendations for man-otter conflict resolution and the proposal of future research needs. This is the frame of the concluding chapter of this thesis - Part IV.
This Ph.D. dissertation includes a proceedings article, three papers in scientific journals, and one book chapter; all peer-reviewed publications. One paper relates to theme 1 and the remaining to theme 2. Of necessity, theme 2 publications are not independent of each other; although intertwined, all add new information to the problem addressed and were designed in a “snowball” strategy that helps to link field-work, conclusions, and applications for use in conservation.

II.l.The Eurasian otter Lutra lutra Linnaeus, 1758 as a case-study
The Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra Linnaeus, 1758 - Class Mammalia; Order Carnivora; Family Mustelidae) distribution covers almost the entire Palearctic region (Chanin 1993, Kruuk 2006) and is the single otter species existing in Europe. Terrestrial carnivores in its essence, otters have however evolved to an aquatic life-style using many freshwater and coastal environments (rivers, streams, ponds, reservoirs, estuaries and sea-coast) moving and foraging in the water. Nevertheless, the large array of habitats used by the otter is somehow misleading since the actual living space for otters is quite confined. Otter habitat can be characterized as a narrow strip on either side of the interface between water and land (Kruuk 2006). It differs therefore from that of other mesocarnivores in the sense that it necessarily includes both water and land and is, to some extent, linear.
Otter optimal habitat is traditionally associated with dense riparian vegetation cover, numerous potential dens (e.g., roots, boulders) (IUCN 2011, Ruiz-Olmo &amp;amp; Jiménez 2009), high prey abundance (Prenda &amp;amp; Granado-Lorencio 1995) and low levels of pollution and human disturbance (Robitaille &amp;amp; Laurence 2002). However otters have proved to be resilient to changes and persist in humanized landscapes as long as a minimum of conditions are met, this being the case of the Iberian Peninsula, Portugal in particular (Trindade et al 1998).
Between the 1950’s and the 1980’s the species range diminished drastically in large areas of Europe (MacDonald &amp;amp; Mason 1994). The pollution of waters, that occurred in the mid-1900s, with compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), dieldrin, and dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane (DDT), affected otter numbers, reducing the species occupancy in several countries (Mason &amp;amp; MacDonald 1986, Olsson &amp;amp; Sandegren 1991). Like other top-predators, otters are particularly exposed to accumulation and biomagnification of toxic compounds in the food web (Yamaguchia et al. 2003). These, reduce fertility and cub survival (Olsson &amp;amp; Sandegren 1991, Roos et al. 2001) and several studies have demonstrated the contamination of the main preys of the otter, like fish or amphibians, especially by organochlorine compounds (Mazet et al. 2005, Boscher et al. 2010, Roos et al. 2010). Fortunately many of these highly damaging compounds were prohibited by legislation in Europe (European Council Directive 79/117/EEC; EC Regulation No 850/2004).
As a consequence of the observed severe decline, in 1999 the Eurasian otter was listed as Vulnerable (VU) by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) Red List of Threatened Species (Hilton-Taylor 2000) and, although nowadays expanding due to multiple recovery efforts across Europe, otters are still considered vulnerable throughout their range
(“Near Threatened” - IUCN 2011). Moreover, the otter is still listed in several International Conventions being a strictly protected species European wide: Annex II of the Bern Convention, Annexes B-II e B-IV of the Habitats Directive and Annex I-A of the Washington Convention (CITES).
Portugal was an exception in the species decline scenario. Known in Portugal since historical times (see Santos-Reis et al. 1995 for a review) the otter was considered frequent in all Portuguese rivers at the end of the XIX century (Bocage 1863). For long time data on the species remained scattered over space and time but, since the 1980’s, a more comprehensive analysis of the species status was accomplished by means of unpublished reports (technical reports and thesis) of short-term studies carried out in different aquatic environments: rivers (Trindade 1990, Florencio 1994, Afonso 1997, Chambel 1997a, Freitas 1999, Lopes 1999, Bernardo, 2008), small streams (Matos 1999, Salgueiro 2009, Marques 2010), rice fields (Trindade 2002), high altitude lagoons (Sousa 1995), small reservoirs (Basto 2006, Basto et al. 2011), large dams (Pedroso 1997, Sales-Luís 1998, Pedroso &amp;amp; Santos-Reis 2006, Pedroso et al. 2007, Sales-Luís et al. 2007, Santos et al. 2008), estuaries (Campos 1993, Trigo 1994, Chambel 1997b, Trindade 1996, Freitas et al. 2007, Sales-Luís et al. 2009) and coastal environments (Beja 1989, Beja 1992, Gomes 1998, Pedrosa 2000, Cerqueira 2005). A major contribution to the understanding of the species status in Portugal was the nation-wide survey led by the Portuguese Institute for Nature Conservation and Biodiversity (ICNB) that through standardized spraint (a term used specifically for otter scats) surveys confirmed the presence of otters across the whole country and allowed the mapping of the species distribution at a 10x10 km UTM resolution (Trindade et al. 1998). The overall results of available studies indicate the existence of a healthy population of otters, with suspected high abundance and, as a consequence, the species was nationally included in the “Least Concern” category (Cabral et al. 2005).
Otters are solitary and intra-gender territorial animals. As a result, spraint deposition is associated with territoriality and resource defense, and it is a powerful intraspecific means of communication (Kruuk 1992). Spraint surveys have been widely used over the years to assess otter distribution, identify habitat features considered of importance to otters, and to indicate population status. Nevertheless the relationship between the number of spraints found and the number of otters in that particular site has always been a controversial issue (Mason and Macdonald 1987, Kruuk et al. 1986, Jefferies 1986, Kruuk 1995, Kranz 1996). Moreover, most authors agree that sprainting activity varies with sex, season, and social and reproductive status (Macdonald 1983, Kruuk 1992, Kranz 1996). These observations lead to the conclusion that the number of spraints cannot be used to assess otter densities, although it is a useful tool for
comparing relative abundance between sites and the degree of defence of resources (Kruuk, 1992).
Live trapping and radio-tagging of otters is a more reliable method to assess home ranges and abundance but existing data sets in Portugal refer only to opportunistic captures of: i) coastal otters to be radio-tagged and monitored to assess dependency of freshwater (Beja 1995); ii) river otters to be translocated to Spain in the frame of a re-introduction programme (Santos-Reis et al. 2003) and, more recently, iii) river otters to be radio-tracked to investigate the use pattern of small reservoirs vs riverine habitats (Bernardo 2008). Hence, although available data suggest that otters are abundant, few attempts have been made to quantify population density in Portugal. In Spain otter density in fresh water streams habitats varies between one and seven otters per 10 km stretch of river (Bravo et al. 1998, Ruiz-Olmo et al. 2007, López-Martín &amp;amp; Jiménez 2008).
Apart from the nation-wide survey (Trindade et al. 1998), the majority of studies conducted in Portugal aimed at providing distribution data at a local/regional extent and relate sprainting activity with habitat features and food habits. The Eurasian otter behaves mostly as a piscivorous predator but has an opportunistic character, taking advantage not only of the most abundant fish prey but also of seasonal peaks of other classes of prey like amphibians and crustaceans. Reptiles, birds, and even mammals are also occasionally consumed (e.g., Kruuk 1995, Clavero et al. 2008). In the Iberian Peninsula, the introduction of the American crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) in the 70’s, significantly altered the diet of the otter. This species rapidly invaded most of the peninsula, reaching high densities in some areas (Correia 1995) and soon became an alternative prey for several predators including the otter (Delibes &amp;amp; Adrian 1987, Beja 1996, Matos 1999, Pedroso &amp;amp; Santos-Reis 2006, López-Martín &amp;amp; Jiménez 2008). Nevertheless, although important in the otter diet, especially in the south of the peninsula, the crayfish generally does not replace the leading role of fishes, being fish abundance an important limiting factor to otter abundance (Beja 1996, Ruiz-Olmo et al. 2001, Clavero et al. 2008, López-Martín &amp;amp; Jiménez 2008).
The historically significant direct persecution and hunting of otters still happens, for the fur and legally in some countries (e.g. Russia), but is otherwise less significant and related to the species being considered a threat to fish populations. This is sometimes true for important fish farming or fishing areas where large amounts of money are claimed as otter damages, especially in the Central Europe carp raising pond areas (Kranz 1994, Bodner 1995a, b, Gossow &amp;amp; Kranz 1998, Kloskowski 2000, 2005a,b, Adámek et al. 2003, Lanszki &amp;amp; Molnár 2003, Leblanc 2003, Jacobsen 2005, Poledník 2005, Schwerdtner &amp;amp; Gruber 2007, Klenke et al.
in press). Elsewhere in Europe, significant quantities of salmonid fish are being preyed in Finland (Ludwig et al. 2002), England (Morgan 2003 in Kruuk 2006) and France (Leblanc 2003). In Scotland otters took 28% of tagged adult salmons within a few weeks and, as salmon populations have seriously declined for unknown reasons, this predation pressure is a concern (Kruuk 2006).
In Portugal, in the 1990’s, with the decline of sea stocks worldwide and the EU incentives to aquaculture, the importance of this economic activity gained relevance. Freshwater farm units produce mainly trout in an intensive production system targeting food production and river stocking. Coastal fish farming activities are more significant in economic terms and are done mostly in semi-intensive production regimes in earth ponds. This growth in fish farming, the widespread distribution and suspected high abundance of otters, together with the records of damages that resulted in direct persecution (Trindade 1991), suggest a high potential for conflict.
Undoubtedly, some fundamental aspects of otter biology and ecology relate to the fact that otters spend much time in water. Their shape, metabolism, locomotion, food preferences, foraging behavior, social organization, survival and mortality are conditioned by this circumstance (Kruuk 2006). Also, they have evolved in habitats that are now more threatened than most. Otter presence, apart from all the perils the species naturally faces due to the fact that it lives in an unstable environment where floods, droughts and / or ice covers are common events, is also influenced by human presence and use of aquatic habitats.
In the Southern Mediterranean part of Portugal, most streams have an intermittent regime and dry out partially or completely during summer. This natural fluctuation conditions water and, consequently, prey availability. This stress factor is surely demanding for otter populations and acts synergistically with other drives of change that man imposes to aquatic environments (Beja 1992, Matos 1999, Basto 2006, Ruiz-Olmo &amp;amp; Jiménez 2009, Marques 2010). Increasing demand and management of watercourses can influence otter distribution and affect populations long term viability (Barbosa et al. 2003) as otters breed more frequently in complex and stable habitats (Ruiz-Olmo &amp;amp; Jiménez 2009). As summers become hotter and longer (Santos et al. 2002, Santos &amp;amp; Miranda 2006), and water demand increases (e.g., abstraction of water for agriculture, daming for electricity production and recreational uses), threats to otters will increase.
For all the above mentioned the otter is a good model species to assess constrains between the conservation of a protected species and human activities, namely river water use and management and estuarine fish farming, and develop recommendations for reconciliation.
II.2.	The river Sado basin: a gradient of salt and human uses
Situated in the extreme southwest of Europe, in the Iberian Peninsula, continental Portugal covers an area of about 89,300 km2 located between meridians 6° and 10°W and between latitude 37° and 42°N. (http://www.inag.pt). The geography of continental Portugal is a mixture of Atlantic and Mediterranean influences, with the former dominating the north the country and the second the south, this being reflected in its climate, flora, and fauna. The Atlantic influence is felt especially during the winter and is responsible for heavy rain, mainly in the northwest (Minho), and by easing the effects of cold and dry winds coming from the continental Iberian Peninsula. The Mediterranean influence is felt primarily during the summer in the south and east regions (Alentejo and Algarve) causing high temperature and low precipitation. The annual average temperature varies from 13 °C, in the mountainous interior north, to over 18 °C in the south. Annual average temperatures can be as high as 20 °C, but summer temperatures may reach 45°C. The country has around 2500 to 3200 hours of sunshine a year, an average of 4-6 h in winter and 10-12 h in summer, with higher values in the southeast and lower in the northwest (http://www.meteo.pt/pt/oclima).
The region with the most rain in Portugal is the Alto Minho, with average annual precipitation of more than 2800 mm. To the south of river Tejo, the yearly average precipitation varies between 800 and 1200 mm in mountainous areas and between 500 and 800 mm in Alentejo plains and down to 400 mm in the Algarve coast. The precipitation at a given location varies over the years, but is concentrated mostly during the October to March period. Generally, the months of December and January have the highest rainfall values with the lowest occuring in July and August. Rainfall in Portugal, besides being irregularly distributed in space, shows also a great variability within and among years (http://www.inag.pt).
In 2006, about 48% of the soil was covered by forests and 48% by agriculture. The remainder was divided between uncultivated areas and towns and cities, which are less than 5% of the area of the country (Caetano et al 2009). The population distribution is uneven. The coastal areas in the centre and north of the country, together with the Algarve, hold a high population density (250 to 7200 inhabitants/km2), unlike inland and the Alentejo region with 5 to 50 inhabitants/km2 (INE 2011).
The country is divided into 15 river basins of variable area (Figure II.2.1). The most important rivers flowing in Portugal - the Minho, Douro, Tejo and Guadiana - are international basins originating in Spain. The largest watersheds entirely located in Portuguese territory are the rivers Sado, Mondego, and Vouga. Of these, the longest river is the Mondego with about 240
km (http://snirh.pt/). River flow variability along the year, as well as in a year to year basis, is influenced by precipitation and greater variation occurs in dryer regions. Northern rivers, located in higher precipitation areas, have a more permanent and stronger flow rate while rivers in the south tend to dry partially or completely in summer.
The data for most of the thesis was collected in the river Sado basin (Figure II.2.1). Technical information presented derives from the River Sado Basin Plan compiled by the Alentejo state commission in the “Plano de Bacia Hidrográfica do Sado” (CCDR_Alentejo 2001) and the “Plano de Gestão das Bacia Hidrográficas integradas na Região Hidrográfica 6” (MAOT/ARH_Alentejo 2011).
Figure II.2.1 - Sado River Basin: a) location in Portugal; b) main sub-basins (large reservoirs in black); c) nationally and internationally classified natural areas; d) Sado Estuary Nature Reserve, Natura 2000 Site PTCON0011 Estuário do Sado, Special Bird Protection Area PTZPE0011 Estuário do Sado and PTZPE0012 Açude da Murta, and a Ramsar Site 7PT007 Estuário do Sado.
The river Sado basin is located in Alentejo, the largest Portuguese district, characterized by its vast plains, and almost exclusively moulded from schist rocks. Mountains are scattered throughout Alentejo and do not exceed 650m in elevation. The river Sado rises in the Serra da Vigia, about 230 meters above sea level, and after a path of 175 kilometers flows into the Atlantic ocean near the city of Setúbal through a broad estuary with about 100 km2 (INAG/MAOT 2004). This river features an unusual orientation in Portugal, running nearly south to north. It is considered a lowland river, since more than half of its course falls below 50 meters in altitude. The entire basin covers an area of about 7692 km2 (37°38’-38°38’N, 8°59’-7O50’W), making it the largest of the exclusively Portuguese rivers (INAG/MAOT 2004). The annual runoff of the river Sado averages 1000 hm3. The Sado river basin is the Portuguese watershed with fewer mean annual water surface resources per unit area (INAG/MAOT 2004). Many of the small streams in the basin are of Mediterranean-type and are ephemeral drying partially or even completely during summer. The estuary is large, having a southeast channel directly connected to the main river and its fresh water; and a north channel and central bay dominantly influenced by the tides. The estuary is separated from the sea in its final section by an inlet of dunes (Tróia Peninsula) and so the connection with the ocean is made through a narrow strait. The seawater entering the estuary is diluted by the freshwater flowing from the river and streams. The pattern of dilution varies and is dependent on the volume of freshwater, tidal amplitude range, and the extent of evaporation from the water within the estuary. Since the average runoff of the river Sado is fairly low, the salt intrusion in this basin is extensive, reaching Alcácer do Sal, 10 km up river. This gradient of salt affects human uses and so the Sado river basin encloses several types of habitats and activities, e.g., saltmarshes, salines (salt production), fish farms and important areas of rice fields along the main stream. Fish farming in these marine and brackish waters is a semi-intensive fish polyculture done in in earth ponds, often recovering old salt production ponds, and besides being an important local economic activity is also nacionaly relevant (INE 2003). Inland, the surrounding landscape is mostly covered by Mediterranean cork (Quercus suber Linnaeus, 1753) and holm (Quercus ilex Linnaeus, 1753) oak woodlands and agriculture fields but there are also considerable areas of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton, 1789) and eucalyptus (Eucaliptus globulus Labill, 1800) plantations.
The estuary has a strong human influence due to the vicinity to Setúbal, a densely populated city with an associated large industrial complex. Nonetheless, it’s ecological, scientific, and economic value is recognized nationally and internationally because it is highly valuable as wintering, nesting, and feeding zone for migratory birds and is included in a 23971,34 ha National Nature Reserve, the Sado Estuary Nature Reserve and also internationally classified
as: a Natura 2000 Site (EC Habitats Directive - PTCON0011 Estuário do Sado), partially because of the presence of otters; a Special Bird Protection Area (EC Birds Directive -PTZPE0011 Estuário do Sado and PTZPE0012 Açude da Murta); and a Ramsar Site (7PT007 Estuário do Sado) (Figure II.2.1).
The highest elevations in the Sado basin are associated with coastal relief Serra da Arrábida, Serra de Grândola and Serra do Cercal and the inner relief Serra da Vigia, horst de Relíquias and Serra de Portel. The main tributaries and sub-tributaries of the river Sado are: in the right margin the Marateca, São Martinho, Alcáçovas, Xarrama, Odivelas and Roxo streams; and in the left margin Grândola, Corona and Campilhas streams. The basin has eight large dams and several smaller reservoirs (Figure. II.2.1). Large reservoirs vary between 3.65 hm3 and 132.5 hm3. The weighted average annual rainfall over the Sado river basin is 624 mm, the highest values occurring annually on the hills of Sines and the lowest in the entire valley area of Sado and along the coastline. The wet period is concentrated between October and March, representing about 86% of mean annual precipitation. Given the climatic characteristics of this region, its hydrological regime is torrential, characterized by the occurrence of floods after the heavy rains, diminishing or even with nil flows, in the dry season. Due to the extensive catchments of the river Sado, the main river usually maintains flow.
Global water needs in the Sado River Basin is distributed as follows: 80.4% for agriculture and livestock; 9.5% for urban supply; 7.6% to industry; and 2.5% for other uses. Most of the demand is covered with surface water as only 23% represents abstractions from ground water. The available surface water, based also on the adjustment capacity of reservoirs, varies immensely from dry, to average to wet years, and the satisfaction of all consumptive uses exceeds the amount of surface water available every dry year.
According to the application of Water Framework Directive (WFD - Directive 2000/60/EC) classification, approximately 29% of the surface waters of Sado basin are ranked as “Good”, 48% as “Reasonable”, 19% as “Mediocre” and 3% as “Bad” (inferred from RH6 data -MAOT/ARH_Alentejo 2011). The aim is to achieve the status “Good” for most water lines.
Water quality in Sado watershed is strongly conditioned by the seasonal character of its flow and the regional variation of its climatic conditions. Most streams suffer a dry period of varying length, reaching on average two months in the case of right bank tributaries of the downstream section of the river Sado and surpassing the five months in the headwaters of the streams of the southeast of the basin. The river Sado, mainly due to receiving "artificially" generated flows from waste water and irrigation runoff, combined with high temperatures and degree of insulation in summer, provide a high primary production and the frequent occurrence of blooms
of microalgae (cyanobacteria). These blooms may negatively impact water quality, especially with regard to the aquatic fauna. This situation is also observed in other water bodies, like coastal lagoons (e.g., Sancha, Melides, and St. André) and reservoirs. This intrinsic condition, favouring water quality degradation and inducing a high vulnerability to other pollution sources, may aggravate this situation. Particularly critical in this context are the significant additional loads of organic matter and nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorus, the main drivers of algal growth (a situation that may occur with increased pollutant loads from irrigation), enhancing eutrophication. Identified sources of nitrogen and phosphorus belong mainly to the agricultural and livestock sector (&gt; 95%).
Overall the river Sado has significant problems of water quality degradation, associated essentially with eutrophication, but triggered by natural and anthropogenic factors. It is possible to recognize a large temporal and spatial variability associated mainly with the seasonal pattern of river flow, the strong irregularity of the basin physiography and an irregular distribution of pollution sources.
The first studies on otter in river Sado basin relate to its presence in specific streams (Beja 1989, Farinha &amp;amp; Trindade 1994) and in the Sado Estuary Nature Reserve (Campos 1993). The 1995 the nation-wide otter survey conducted showed a continuous distribution in the river Sado basin with only two absences recorded at the 10x10 km UTM squares (Trindade et al. 1998). Subsequent studies, conducted in streams of the Grândola Mountain (Matos 1999, Salgueiro
2009), large dams (Pedroso &amp;amp; Santos-Reis 2006), and the basin rice fields (Trindade 2002), confirmed this broad distribution. Most of these studies included diet assessement and confirmed the American crayfish as significant prey for otters, especially in the rice fields and the small streams of Grândola Mountain.

Abstract
Recent work in landscape ecology has stressed the importance of scale considerations in studies of biological diversity and conservation. The IUCN Otter Specialist Group has recommended a standardized 10x10 km UTM grid for monitoring Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra) distribution and trends. As a result of subsequent surveys, otters were downgraded to a “Least Concern” category in the 2005 Portuguese Red Data Book, primarily because of its broad distribution at the 10x10 km scale. Previously, otters were considered threatened and used by conservationists as a flagship species in river conservation. However, by interpreting a continuous distribution at the coarse 10x10 km resolution, the new status assessment can be misleading and, as a result, managers may ignore serious threats to local otter populations. To assess the effect of survey resolution, we evaluated otter distribution in the Sado river basin (Alentejo, Portugal) during both wet and dry seasons at three scale resolutions (10x10, 5x5, and 2.5x2.5 km). Stream length, as well as reservoir edge and area were measured at each grid cell size and compared for grid cells with and without otter presence. our results confirmed that even though otters were distributed widely, the 10x10 grid cell protocol overestimated the area actually occupied. Seasonal effects were also very significant. The 10x10 km grid resolution may be useful when trying to assess European or national population trends but is too optimistic and misleading when local management decisions are involved and conservation planning is needed. We suggest a monitoring protocol to improve conservation management in Mediterranean areas of intermittent water flow.
Keywords: Lutra lutra, population distribution, season, water availability, management decisions.
Introduction
Several authors have stressed the importance of integrating scale considerations into studies of biological diversity (Beever et al. 2006, Hess et al. 2006) and conservation (Nams et al. 2006).
These concerns commonly address whether correlates of species distribution vary with the scale resolution of measurement. Typically resource selection functions are used to map suitable habitat based on predicted probability of use but the spatial resolution selected to obtain data to enter the models influences the accuracy of predictions (Meyer &amp;amp; Thuiller 2006, Baker et al. 2007) and does not affect models equally across regions, techniques, or species types (Carter et al. 2006, Guisan et al. 2007). Consequently, failure to consider and select the most appropriate scale or suite of scales (domain) may lead to incorrect interpretations of data and consequently the mismanagement of critical natural resources (Bowyer &amp;amp; Kie 2006, Bombi et al. 2011).
A coarse resolution standardized approach is effective at large scale extents (e.g., Europe or nationwide) to map species distribution (Araújo et al. 2005) and assess general trends in population status (Linkie et al. 2007). However, pattern is linked inexorably to study resolution (Turner et al. 1989, Qi &amp;amp; Wu 1996, Wu 2004, Guisan et al. 2007). Further, life history requirements of species are expressed at various spatial and temporal scales (May 1994, Bissonette &amp;amp; Broekhuizen 1995, Bowyer &amp;amp; Kie 2006) and linked closely to the heterogeneity of different resources needed for existence that may be distributed at finer or coarser scales of resolution. The World Conservation Union (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species provides taxonomic, conservation status, and distribution information on taxa that are globally evaluated using IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria. In the past these criteria were more subjective, but now are based on quantitative parameters; e.g., geographic range size, population size, and probability of extinction risk (IUCN 1994, 2001, 2011). One criterion requires assessment of population decline that, in practice, is often based on observed changes in species distribution as more reliable data are difficult or impossible to collect over wide areas.
Questions of scale and the management of Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) have attracted attention (Foster-Turley et al. 1990, Robitaille &amp;amp; Laurence 2002, Barbosa et al. 2003). Historically, Eurasian otter distribution extended across Europe and Asia, but after the 1950s declined in Western Europe, becoming absent from large areas of their former range (Mason &amp;amp; Macdonald 1986, Foster-Turley et al. 1990). In face of this decline, the IUCN Otter Specialist Group (OSG) argued for a standardized, comparable sign survey-based method for monitoring the distribution and population trends of all otter species. Standard surveys, using a 10x10 km Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid system and based on a method developed and tested for L. lutra (Macdonald 1983), were recommended (Foster-Turley et al. 1990, Reuther et al. 2002), and are followed in most European countries.
Due to the approximately 20% population decline across Europe over three generations, the Eurasian otter was listed in 1999 as Vulnerable (VU) by the IUCN Red List of Threatened
Species (Hilton-Taylor 2000). Otter populations have recovered in Western Europe and are still viable in the former USSR (Kranz 1994, Macdonald 1994, Macdonald &amp;amp; Mason 1994, Romanowski et al. 1997, Cortés et al. 1998, Ruiz-Olmo &amp;amp; Delibes 1998, Kranz &amp;amp; Toman 2000, Conroy &amp;amp; Chanin 2002, López-Martín &amp;amp; Jiménez 2008); however given the lack of information from huge parts of their former range and coupled with their recent history of decline, otters are still considered “Near Threatened” throughout their range (IUCN 2011).
In Portugal, given the paucity of data (Ferrand-Almeida 1980, Macdonald &amp;amp; Mason 1982, Santos-Reis 1983, Simoes-Gra^a &amp;amp; Ferrand-Almeida 1983, Beja 1989, Trindade 1991, Santos-Reis et al. 1995), otters were first listed as “Insufficiently Known” in the Red Data Book of Terrestrial Vertebrates (SNPRCN 1990). Then, following the OSG recommendations, a nationwide survey was conducted in 1995 by the Portuguese Institute for Nature Conservation (ICN) that demonstrated a broad distribution across the country at the coarse grid resolution of 10x10 km (Trindade et al. 1998). Consequently, given its broad distribution and inferred high abundance (Santos-Reis et al. 2003), otters were downgraded in Portugal to the “Least Concern” category (Cabral et al. 2005).
Otters scale allometrically (based on their mobility and size) to a putative patchy and heterogeneous resource base for which water is a major driver and constraint. We argue that a survey at a finer scale resolution seems appropriate and needed to detect if real discontinuities in otter distribution exist and to allow a realistic perception of scale and seasonal effects in the distribution pattern. This paper explores the effects of scale resolution on otter distribution assessments in Mediterranean-type ecosystems, which are characterized by a highly marked seasonal climate (Santos et al. 2002, Santos &amp;amp; Miranda 2006). We predicted that otter distribution would change not only with scale resolution but also with survey season. Specifically, we expected a much more discontinuous distribution than the 10x10 km resolution suggested. If correct, then our results will have important implications for conservation management. We suggest a scale-based monitoring protocol that will help ensure accurate interpretation of monitoring results.
Methods
Study Area
The Sado River has the largest exclusively Portuguese basin (Trindade et al. 1998). Located in southwestern Portugal (Alentejo region) the main river flows south to northwest with a length of 175 km and a basin area of 7692 km2 (37O38’-38O38’N, 8O59’-7O50’W) (CCDR_Al entejo
2001). Climate is Temperate Mediterranean with mild winters and very hot summers. Annual precipitation is around 700mm. Many of the small streams in the basin dry partially or completely during summer. The basin has 8 large dams (WCD 2000), several smaller reservoirs, and a considerable area of rice fields along the main river channel. The surrounding landscape is typically Mediterranean cork (Quercus suber Linnaeus, 1753) and holm (Quercus ilex Linnaeus, 1753) oak woodlands, but with considerable areas of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton, 1789) and eucalyptus (Eucaliptus globulus Labill, 1800) plantations.
This region has had a strong human influence. Setúbal (Figure III.1.1) is a densely populated town with an associated industrial complex. Over time, the estuary has become one of the most polluted areas in the entire basin. Nonetheless, it’s ecological, scientific, and economic value is recognized nationally and internationally. A large part of the Sado estuary (2.3 km2) is a Nature Reserve because of its high biodiversity values, including salt marshes, salt production ponds, fish farms, freshwater lagoons, marshes, and rice fields. Moreover, the estuary is a special bird protection area (EC Birds Directive), a Ramsar Site, and is included on the national list of Natura 2000 Sites partially because of the presence of otters.

Otter Surveys
To allow a realistic perception of scale effects, we overlaid a GIS map of the Sado basin with a 10x10 km grid system (Figure III.1.1). At this resolution, the study area included all or part of 76 grid cells. To keep survey effort feasible, 50% (n = 38) were randomly selected for survey (Figure III.1.1). This approach allowed comparisons with previous assessments (Trindade et al. 1998). We then divided each 10x10 km cell into four 5x5 km cells, and each 5x5 km cell into four 2.5x2.5 km cells. Within each selected 10x10 km cell, two 5x5 km grid cells were randomly chosen for survey (n=76) and within each chosen 5x5 km grid cell two 2.5x2.5 km cells were randomly selected (n= 152) and independently surveyed to explore if changes in distribution existed at finer grid cell resolutions (Figure III.1.2). This restricted random selection procedure allowed us to assess the scale resolution at which the discontinuities, if present, would appear. We nested the smaller grid cells to determine if the putative transition to a discontinuous habitat (from otter presence to otter absence) was due to the grid resolution change or to the absolute randomness of the selection of the specific smaller grid cell.
Figure III.1.2 - Example of the sequential random sampling design: □ - survey grid cells.
We then followed IUCN OSG guidelines and used a maximum transect length of 600m per site (Macdonald 1983) to conduct stream, river, and reservoir surveys to determine otter presence/absence. We sampled for each grid cell size independently, starting at the coarsest resolution and with the most accessible water line in each cell. As soon as we found an otter sign, the grid cell was classified as positive. If no sign was found in the first transect, another suitable habitat was surveyed within the same cell until all options had been investigated. Only then, if still no otter sign had been found, was the grid cell considered negative. It is seldom possible to assure a true absence, but with this method the probability that a negatively classed grid cell corresponded to a real absence is enhanced.
Surveys were conducted twice in 2002, once during the wet (March - May) season and once during the dry (August - September) season (SNIRH/ INAG 2006) in order to evaluate if seasonal discontinuities in distribution existed. The wet season was sampled at the end of the rainy period to ensure that rivers were flowing, but that rain did not affect survey effectiveness by washing away otter signs. The dry season was sampled at the end of summer to ensure that we surveyed during the harshest period when river and stream flow was lowest or absent. Existing streams, rivers, and reservoirs were identified from 1:25 000 military charts (IGEOE -Portuguese Geographic Military Institute).
Water systems characterization
All reservoirs in the Sado Basin were mapped from digitized military charts (1:25 000 -IGEOE - Portuguese Geographic Military Institute). Stream and river courses were mapped and classified following Strahler's (1952) stream order system with a scale resolution of 1:1 000 000 (I.A.- Portuguese Environment Institute) to provide insight into areas more prone to drought. Total length of water lines, total length of each stream order, total area of ponds, and total area of large reservoirs were calculated for each surveyed grid cell across the three resolutions (2.5x2.5, 5x5, 10x10 km).
Data analyses
Statistical differences in counts of negative grid cells for otter presence were assessed with crosstabs chi-square tests across the three grid resolutions and with a McNemar test for the wet and dry seasons (Zar 1999). Differences in counts of grid cells with water (that is, at least one first order stream) across the three grid resolutions were assessed with chi-square tests using the mean percentage of cells with water (3 resolutions summed) as the expected value.
Because each smaller grid cell represented a quarter of the area of the larger cell in which it was embedded, differences in the mean values of pond and large reservoir areas, length of all streams, and length in each stream order across grid resolutions were assessed with chi-square tests using a fourth of the mean value of the next highest grid resolution as the expected value. Bonferroni corrections (Sokal &amp;amp; Rohlf 1995, Brown &amp;amp; Russel 1997) were carried out for multiple testing. Significant differences between grid cells with and without otters also were assessed through non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-tests (Siegel &amp;amp; Castellan 1988). This approach helped verify if differences observed in otter distribution were related to changes in grid cell resolution vs. being influenced only by water resource distribution. We used ArcView
version 3.1 (ESRI, California, USA) to conduct the GIS analyses and SPSS 14.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) for the statistical analyses.
Results
In total, we independently surveyed 38 10x10 km, 76 5x5 km and 152 2.5x2.5 km grid cells to evaluate otter occupancy discontinuities. We found a wide distribution of otter. Grid cells without otters were not clustered, although they were more pronounced around the estuary (Figure III.1.3).
The change from 10x10 km to 5x5 km resolution increased otter absences from 0 to 9% in wet season and to 13% in dry season (Figure III.1.3, Table III.1.1), and the difference was statistically significant (%2= 6.58; p = 0.01). When the 5x5 km and the 2.5x2.5 km grid resolutions were compared, highly significant changes in the number of grid cells where otters were absent was observed (%2 = 10.9; p = 0.001) (Figure III.1.3, Table III.1.1). This difference was even more pronounced and significant when the finest grid cell resolution (2.5x2.5 km) was compared with the coarsest (10x10 km) resolution (%2 = 22.1; p &amp;lt;0.001) (Figure III.1.3, Table III.1.1).
Regardless of resolution scale, the dry season survey resulted in a highly significant 8% increase in absences (McNemar test %2 = 120.8; p &amp;lt;0.001). For example, during the wet season otters were detected in all of the 38 selected 10x10 km grid cells, similarly to the situation found in 1995 (Trindade et al. 1998). Nevertheless, in the dry season, occupancy dropped to around 92% at that coarse resolution (Figure III.1.3, Table III.1.1).

Stream order in Sado basin varied between 1 and 4. The only class 4 river was the Sado. Presence and length of streams and area of small ponds did not vary significantly among grid resolutions. However, and as expected, large reservoirs were not evenly distributed and so their area showed statistical differences among grid resolutions (Table III.1.2).

Similarly, between negative and positive grid cells for otter presence, reservoir area was the only consistently significant difference in all three grid resolutions (Table III.1.3). The 2.5x2.5 km grid revealed significant differences between negative and positive grid cells for otter presence in second and third order streams and in total length of streams per grid cell (Table III.1.3). These 4 variables were positively related to otter presence. First order streams were significantly negatively related to otter presence at the coarsest resolution (Table III.1.3).

Discussion
The problem of scale in ecological studies has been called the most important problem in all of ecology, having fundamental significance for ecological studies because patterns discovered at different scale resolutions and extents will have “unique causes and biological consequences” (Levin 1992). Ecologists have been trying for several decades to find the ‘right’ scale. It has become clear that there is no one correct scale resolution or extent (Turner et al. 2001). Equally clear is that even though not all singly unique scales serve equally well; ecological neighborhoods (Addicott et al. 1987) and scale domains (Wiens 1989) are multi-scale approaches that have used the behavior of animals to assess scale-sensitive responses to environmental pattern and processes. Initially, there were early arguments regarding the value of larger scale studies but those questions have been largely resolved (Blackburn &amp;amp; Gaston
2002). However, the scale choice problem remains recalcitrant to solution. Disentangling ecological complexity is a complicated task in which many approaches are required (Hanski
1999). Even something seemingly as simple as determining species distributions involves scale decisions. For example, distribution atlases have been widely used to study patterns of abundance, rarity, richness, turnover, and assemblage composition at varying spatial scales because they provide practical representations of species distributions with similar area grid cells (Araújo et al. 2005). However there is the concern that the scale of most atlases (50 x 50, 10 x 10 km) is too coarse for real-world conservation planning (e.g., Hopkinson et al. 2000, Hulme 2003). For example, Hulme (2003) recognized that invasive species distribution maps were often as misleading as they were instructive. Coarse resolution data overestimated the role of climate in the invasion process and this influenced subsequent invasive species management programs. Attempts have been made to use multiple regression to quantify the explanatory power of a set of variables at several different scale resolutions (Turner et al. 1989, Pearson et
al. 1995), and to downscale species distributions to finer resolutions by combining remotely sensed data and expert opinion (Carter et al. 2006), or by modeling techniques that explore the correlation between species occurrence and environmental predictor variables (Bombi et al. 2011), but these approaches are usually limited to a few, well known species (Araújo et al. 2005). An extrapolation model of otter distribution in Iberian Peninsula (Barbosa et al. 2003), based on the 10x10 km Spanish otter survey (Ruiz-Olmo &amp;amp; Delibes 1998) and having as explanatory variables environmental data (air humidity, temperature, precipitation, soil permeability, etc.), as well as indicators of human activity (e.g., distance to highways and towns), classified Alentejo as the lowest probability area for otter presence in Portugal. The same authors concluded that human intervention was more likely to produce non-viable local otter populations in areas where they were isolated from nearby suitable habitats and restricted to mainstream rivers.
Our results lend credibility to this concern. The scale resolution of sampling had very important effects on the distribution assessment: otter distribution and presence decreased as grid resolution increased. Even during the wet season, the continuous distribution apparent at 10x10 km showed gaps at the finer resolution sampling grids. These effects were real and not an outcome of the absence of otter habitat at higher resolutions (Table III. 1.2). Clearly it is important to match the scale resolution to the patterns and processes being assessed. Our data indicate that, in Alentejo, otters scale to the environment at a finer resolution than can typically be detected using the standard survey scale recommended by IUCN Otter Specialist Group.
The increase in otter absences from wet to dry season is related to the almost complete absence of water in many stream beds during summer; indeed, some water related variables were positively associated with otter presence. Grid cells with greater length of second and third order streams and with a higher number of water reservoirs were more likely to be positive for otter presence. The shift from otter presence to absence with season of survey revealed the adaptive response of otter to intermittent stream habitats. During periods of water shortage, otters tended to be found in high-order streams and reservoirs. López-Martín et al. (1998) also showed that otter activities during the dry season tended to concentrate around remaining running waters, pools, and small reservoirs, effectively reducing territory size and reducing scent marking boundaries (Ruiz-Olmo et al. 2007 ). Prenda et al. (2001) concluded that as water availability increased so did otter distribution; during these periods otters tended to re-colonize low-order streams. It is clear that the carrying capacity of smaller streams varies immensely across seasons and that otters in the landscape might very well be organized according to ephemeral source-sink dynamics.
Otter behavioral response, including changes in area occupied during wet and dry periods, places a much greater importance on the management of year round wet habitats (e.g., large streams and river pools) that are also the most susceptible to human influence. Increasing demand and management of water can influence otter distribution and affect long term viability (Barbosa et al. 2003). As summers become hotter and longer (Santos et al. 2002, Santos &amp;amp; Miranda 2006), and water demand becomes higher (e.g., pumping water for agriculture), threats to otters will increase.
Cianfrani et al. (2011), using otter distribution data, climate change scenarios and several forecasting approaches, predict a shift in the otter distribution in Europe and a decrease in otter habitat suitability in the Iberian Peninsula, linked to a potential increase in droughts as the climate warms. A decrease in the fitness of Iberian otter populations can compromise future dispersal potential and prevent colonization of new areas that may become suitable after climate change (Cianfrani et al 2011). Additionally Mucci et al. (2010) conducted a European wide otter molecular study and indicated that some local populations are genetically differentiated. Otters from Alentejo are included in the south cluster from Iberia that it is split into two sub-populations. These findings mean that the genetic variability existing in each cluster should not be lost. If it is impossible to defend keeping enough water in the lower order streams due to social pressure, conservation efforts will more profitably be directed to middle reaches of the watershed (Jiménez &amp;amp; Lacomba 1991) as otters breed more frequently in complex and stable habitats (Ruiz-Olmo &amp;amp; Jiménez 2009).
Our results suggest when surveys for otter monitoring might be most appropriately conducted. Clearly, consideration of season is important in rivers with intermittent water regimes. Summer surveys are likely to give a more realistic perspective of otter distribution.
The “otters everywhere” perception offered by the ‘black’ map at 10x10 km resolution can greatly influence conservation initiatives. The use of a finer resolution is most appropriate when regional/local management decisions on waterlines and riparian habitats are to be made. Nevertheless, even complete 10x10 km surveys are economically difficult or even impossible for most species and countries. Strong investments in the conservation of a species, such as those necessary for surveys at such fine spatial scales, should therefore be carefully justified.
Investment in fine-coarse surveys in Mediterranean-type ecosystems, especially when otters are widespread such as in Portugal, is important because: i) otters are still globally threatened and represent an effective flagship species in river conservation; ii) the current scenario of climate change in Europe affects primarily the riverine systems in Mediterranean regions, namely by extending the drought period; iii) coarse-scale resolutions may be inefficient in detecting otter
population declines. The third reason is perhaps the most important. By the time that an otter decline is detected using the 10x10 distribution map, it may be much more complex and expensive to effectively recover the population to a viable, self-sustainable situation. Our rationale is that when otter numbers are increasing, the 10x10 coarse scale resolution is effective in detecting positive changes in distribution; inversely, however, it may be too slow in detecting population declines. Our argument is based on otter territoriality and the assumption that otters first occupy optimal habitats, i.e., the higher order streams and rivers, and are more easily detected there. However, when populations are decreasing, they are lost first in lower order stream habitat, and the loss is less easily detected. Hence, if only a 10 x 10 km monitoring protocol is used, the cell could be considered otter positive even as river and otter population conditions are declining. If this occurs, applying conservation measures in a time frame when they still are cost-effective may be most difficult.
A feasible approach to the problem, and that may apply to many other species as well, is to identify areas where the species is more vulnerable to increasing threats (e.g., the Alentejo in Portugal - Barbosa et al. 2003) and survey a subsample of that area at a finer scale resolution in the most environmentally stressing season. The average territory size of a species is a good surrogate for identifying the appropriate finer sampling scale. The survey frequency should be adapted to the target species ecology, possibly following the species distribution atlas regularity. With otters, finer scale sampling is best coordinated with the OSG advised nationwide coarser grid survey (e.g., the Spanish national otter 10x10 km grid survey is conducted every 10 years - Ruiz-Olmo &amp;amp; Delibes 1998, López-Martín &amp;amp; Jiménez 2008).
As long as there are sensible reasons for using the scale chosen, studies at any scale resolution and extent have the potential to provide useful information about population distribution (Blackburn &amp;amp; Gaston 2002). A 10x10 km grid resolution is useful when trying to create otter distribution maps to assess national or European population trends; however a 2.5x2.5 km grid should be the logical choice when information about the local population status, in face of existing threats, is needed and local management decisions are involved.
The combined monitoring approach we suggest in this paper is important for the effective monitoring of otter populations. From our results it is clear that local management decisions that impact otter in the dryer regions of Portugal cannot be based on coarse resolution distribution data. Scale and season do matter when otters in the Mediterranean basin are the issue.

Abstract
Due to the financial incentives of the EU the number of fish farms in Portugal has increased in the last decade. While this economic activity grew, so too did the problems between fish farmers and the otter. Such conflicts, between protected species and the exploitation of biological resources, are common and can affect several different economic activities and species. Hence, a European project for the development of a procedural framework for action plans to reconcile conflicts between the conservation of large vertebrates and the use of biological resources (FRAP), using fisheries in several countries and three species of fisheating vertebrates as a model case, was established. Portugal, Germany and the Czech Republic are responsible for analyzing the otter/fish farm conflict. This paper aims to introduce the conflict in Portugal by focusing on the inventory and distribution of fish farms, related to otter distribution and otter damage. Interviews with fish farmers were conducted, focusing on the presence or absence of otters at the farms and the perceived damages caused by the otters. Overall, 13.2% of the fish farms involved were not in use, 47.4% were considered negative for otter presence and 39.5% positive. Otter presence at fish farms is quite common and conflict with fish farm owners exists, but this is usually taken care of privately by owners who test different methods of deterrence, such as fencing, electric fencing and the use of dogs, but also traps, shooting or even poison. Preliminary results are presented but additional data on predation impacts are certainly necessary and the FRAP project will be a good step in that direction.

Introduction
With the financial encouragement of the EU, the number of fish farms in Portugal has increased in the last decade. such a Community structural Policy is a means to reduce pressure upon sea fish stocks. While this economic activity grew, so to did the problems between fish farmers and the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) a fish-eating vertebrate. Also, most of the Portuguese fish
farms are located in estuaries, the majority of which are protected areas with high biodiversity values, which should be preserved, such as the otter.
In 1990, a questionnaire was sent by the Portuguese Institute for Nature Conservation (Trindade 1991) to 208 fish farmers, aiming to determine the impact of predation on their businesses and the financial losses, attributed mostly to otter activities. Although the response was relatively low (29%), some indications were obtained about the emerging conflict between fish-eating predators and fish farm owners. The otter was the most commonly referred predator, causing damages all year round and some fish farmers perceived the species as a pest. Complaints referred to predation and stress imposed on the fish, and the losses reported were high. However, producers could not quantify ‘damage levels’, and nearby productions reported very contrasting damages. The inexistence of a compensation system, the perceived high otter numbers, its legal status and the constraints imposed by the protected areas to prevention measures led to a conflict that continues to exist, the impact of which remains largely unknown.
This type of conflict between protected species and the exploitation of biological resources is common and affects several different economic activities and species. In an attempt to solve, or at least minimise, this problem, a European project was designed for the development of a procedural framework for action plans to reconcile conflicts between the conservation of large vertebrates and the use of biological resources, using fisheries and fish-eating vertebrates as a model case (FRAP - Framework for Biodiversity Reconciliation Action Plans - contract number EVK2-CT-2002-00142-FRAP).
The project, initiated in February 2003, includes two approaches (ecological and socioeconomic) and uses three fish-eating species and different fishery types in eight European countries. The three model species, selected as representatives of the fish-eating vertebrates, are the Eurasian otter, the great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis) and the grey seal (Haliochoerus grypus). For each model species at least two countries were selected representing different population status and/or levels of conflicts with fisheries (www.frap-project.net).
Portugal, Germany and the Czech Republic are responsible for analysing the otter conflict, using an ecological approach that aims to quantify otter visiting rates to fish farms and commercially important fish consumption, as well as to identify landscape factors affecting those parameters. Complementarily, a socio-economic approach involves the analysis of instruments/policies that address the conflict and a social impact assessment, with a discourse analysis of involved stakeholders.
Portugal is considered to have one of the most viable otter populations in Europe (Foster-Turley et al. 1990). In 1995, a nation-wide otter survey was conducted using a 10x10 km UTM grid system and the resulting map showed a continuous distribution with very few absences, mainly in the coastal area around the main urban centres (Trindade et al. 1998). Otters occupy a wide range of aquatic environments ranging from rivers, very small streams, to reservoirs, but also coastal and estuarine environments (Beja 1989, Chambel 1997, Macdonald &amp;amp; Mason 1982, Trindade 1996, Trindade et al. 1995, Trindade et al. 1998). Densities are unknown, but suspected to be high on the basis of the abundance of otter signs found in different studies conducted all over the country (Beja 1992, 1995, Macdonald &amp;amp; Mason 1982, Trindade et al. 1998).
This paper aims to introduce the conflict at a national scale by focusing on the inventory and distribution pattern of fish farms, related to otter distribution and on the selection of specific study sites to address the conflict from an ecological perspective, as well by presenting the methodology to be followed and the first results.
Methods
In the frame of FRAP, an attempt was made, at a national level, to contact as many licensed fish farms as possible. Interviews with owners focused on the presence or absence of otters in the vicinities of fish farms, the actual use of the fish ponds and perception of the damages caused. Inquiries were performed by phone and whenever necessary (existence of preventive measures, outdoor facilities, claims of otter presence by owner) a visit was conducted to the fish farm to survey for otter signs.
The underlying questions of the FRAP project related to otter predation on fish farms aim to identify the landscape factors influencing otter visiting rates to fish farms and to assess the loss of commercially important fish. To do so, intensive study areas were selected on the basis of the inventory/inquiries results.
Results
Inventory and distribution pattern offish farms
In Portugal, two types of fish farms can be found, having different ecological characteristics and socio-economic impacts: coastal farms, ponds built according to the features of old salt
marshes and producing marine fish species, and inland farms that are directly related to freshwater streams and produce mainly trout.
According to the National Statistics Institute (INE), until the mid-1980s aquaculture production consisted in the rearing of fresh water fishes like trouts (Oncorhincus mykiss and Salmo truta fario) and the culture of marine bivalves, mainly clams (Ruditapes decussatus; Venerupis pullastra), oysters (Crassostrea gigas; C. angulata.), mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis; M. edulis) and cockles (Cerastoderma edule), in tidal estuaries. The culture of marine fish species was practically insignificant and restricted to saline reserve tanks. When the Community Structural Policy was applied in Portugal, (mid 1980s), aquaculture began to be seen as an alternative method for the production of animal protein for human consumption and even as a complement of the traditional fishery production. As a result of the EU subsidies, many saline areas in estuaries were converted to commercial fish farms and aquaculture production increased.
In 2001, there were 1,412 licensed operators (INE 2002). The number of marine and brackish water farms is far larger than that of freshwater farms: 1,392 licensed marine farms, covering an area of 1,549 hectares, and only 20 freshwater farms, established in 38 hectares.
Coastal aquaculture comprises two sectors: bivalves bottom culture with 1,289 licenses, and marine fish farms with about 103 registered establishments (6 of which are hatcheries). Most are in extensive regime tanks ranging from 0.5 to 74.0 hectares, with an average size of 10 hectares.
Marine fish culture accounts mainly for the production of sea bream (Sparus aurata) and sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), having in 2001 an output of 1,762 tonnes and 925 tonnes respectively and worth € 13.7 millions.
For geographical reasons, most of the freshwater farms are located in the centre (30%) and north (65%) of the country where temperature and water availability are more adequate. This represents 98% of the total fresh water production in 2001 and accounted for 1,213 tonnes worth € 2.9 millions.
Marine fish farms are distributed in estuarine areas along the coast but with an uneven distribution, with the higher proportion of production units located in the Tejo and Sado estuaries (Central Portugal), where, in 2001, they reached 56% of all marine fish farms in Portugal. These sites are located in Nature Reserves, which are also some of the best preserved areas for otters.
Otter impact on fish farms
FRAP inquiries
From the 123 known fish farms owners 76 (61.8%) were interviewed. Of these, 32 (42.1%) were questioned by phone, while the remaining 44 farms were visited and surveyed for otter signs. Overall, ten (13.2%) fish farms were inactive, 36 (47.4%) considered negative for otter presence and 30 (39.5%) positive.
Of the 32 fish farms not visited, nine (28.1%) were inactive, two (6.3%) considered positive to otter presence (but survey visits were not possible) and 21 (65.6%) considered negative, mostly because they were fenced or inaccessible to otters (n = 8: 38.1%), or the owner demonstrated a fairly good knowledge of otters and was convinced of their absence.
Of the 44 fish farms visited, one (2.3%) was inactive, 15 (34.1%) had no otter signs and 28 (63.6%) had signs.
Of the 20 trout farms known in Portugal, 19 were contacted: two (10.5%) were inactive, eight (42.1%) considered to have no otter presence (but only 2 were visited) and nine (47.4%) were confirmed positive by survey.
Of the 57 marine fish farms (55.3% of the 103 known in Portugal) contacted, eight (14%) were inactive, 28 (49.1%) considered negative (13 visited) and 21 (36.8%) were positive (19 surveyed).
In the trout farms, all producers referred to otters, but also mentioned herons (Egretta garzeta, Ardea cinerea} predation upon trout. The small trout (up to 6cm) ponds, when not protected by overhead wire, line, screen or netting, were also highly impacted by smaller birds. In the marine fish farms predation is attributed to otter, and herons, but particularly heavily to cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis), especially in winter. When fish are small, the tern (Sterna hirundo} also seems to be important predator. Also, in general fish farmers’ perception of otter daily consumption of fish was greatly overestimated reaching values as high as 10 kg per day. Some producers also claim negative impacts of pollution on water quality caused by bad agricultural practices and industry wastes.
Intensive study sites
To fulfil the aims, and based on the results of the inquiries and on fish farms distribution, two study areas were selected for implementation of the project: the Sado estuary for marine fish farms and Central Portugal for trout farms (Figure III.2.1).
Figure 111.2.1 - Location of the marine fish farms at the river Sado estuary (-) and of the trout farms (•) in central Portugal.
In summer 2003, these two areas were surveyed on a weekly basis to determine otter presence and to assess visiting rates (VR). Scats were collected for diet analysis. Evidence and abundance of alternative prey and size distribution of fish species in the foraging area were evaluated for comparison with otter consumption. Also, a list of landscape factors that might influence otter visiting rates and, consequently, predation on commercially important species and thus the level of the otter-fishery conflict, was prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the species requirements as well as on the peculiarities of each study site. Four key factors were identified (Table III.2.1) and are currently being evaluated. (Data presented in this paper refers only to summer 2003 results).

Sado Estuary - marine fish farms
Fourteen extensive fisheries, each with a variable number (1 to18) and size (0.5 to 50ha) of ponds (Figure III.2.1) were selected in the estuary. These farms produce mainly four marine fish species: sea bream, sea bass and sole Solea senegalensis and S. solea, all potential otter prey.
Vegetation in the tidal area is typical of marshland areas, with dense low halofitic shrubs (e.g. Arthrocnemum sp, Halimione portulacoides, Sarcocornia sp, Atriplex sp).
Around the estuary, cork oak (Quercus suber) woodlands and pine tree plantations (Pinus pinaster, P. pinea) dominate the landscape. The soil is mostly sandy with low capacity to retain water. Human population density is high, but concentrated in the main city (Setúbal) and other smaller urban areas. Freshwater resources include the main river (Sado), four streams (Comenda, Marateca, Vale de Cão and S. Martinho) and several smaller drainage lines.
Otter visiting rates (VR= number of surveys positive to otter presence/total number of surveys) were very high, with half of the fish farms reaching values above 80% (Figure III.2.2). This means that that in general otter signs were found in 8 out of 10 weekly surveys. Even so, the otter never visited one of the selected farms. It appears that the eight dogs present in the facility may be the proximal factor for such result.
Figure III.2.2 - Otter visiting rates to marine fish farms at the River Sado estuary
Landscape variables were not yet fully analysed but distance and width of the nearest stream seem to be correlated to damages.
A total of 619 scats were collected during the summer, and of these, 288 were analysed. Prey items were identified, whenever possible, to species level and the minimum number of consumed individuals per spraint assessed. Results were calculated as percentage of occurrence (number of consumed individuals from a particular prey item in all spraints/ sum of consumed individuals of all prey items *100).
Fish form the bulk of the diet representing 87% of the occurrences (Figure III.2.3), and of these, 24% were commercially important fish species (produced), mainly sea bream (Figure III.2.4). Distinctions of commercial species consumed by the otter in nature and inside the farm were done using species abundance (sea bream and sea bass are almost absent in nearby areas of the estuary) and sizes distribution evaluated in the foraging area.

Central Portugal - trout farms
In the central region, trout farms are spread further apart and only four could be selected for monitoring (Figure III.2.1). All have fewer (5 to 12) and smaller (0.5 to1.0 ha) man-made ponds, built of concrete. These inland fisheries only produce brown trout (Salmo trutta fario) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and are always located near a stream.
Human population densities vary with each farm location, but are never high. Nearby rivers are usually fairly well preserved and have good riparian galleries dominated by woody (Populus spp, Fraxinus angustifolia, Alnus glutinosa) or shrubby (Rubus spp, Nerium oleander, Arundo donax} vegetation. In these rivers, only the brown trout occurs naturally along with several cyprinids (e.g. Squalius pyrenaicus, Chondrostoma sp, Barbus sp). Rainbow trout can also occasionally be found, but these individuals either escaped from fish farms, or were introduced by man.
Otter visiting rates were uneven, with a mean value of 59%, but forming two distinct groups: one with a rate above 80% and another around 35% (Figure III.2.5).
Figure III.2.5 - Otter visiting rates to the trout farms in central Portugal.
Of 142 scats collected, 30 were randomly selected for this preliminary evaluation. Otter diet in the trout farms is entirely composed of fish. Salmonids, corresponding to brown trout and rainbow trout, form the bulk of the diet representing 73% of the occurrences (Figure III.2.6). The remains of these two species in the scats are too difficult to distinguish and moreover as the sizes of brown trout existing in the ponds and in the river are quite similar (enclosing from small to big fishes) it is impossible to confirm, without using other elaborate fish bone analyses, if the origin of the consumed brown trout is the river or the trout farm.

Conclusions
Otter presence in Portuguese fish farms is quite common and conflicts with fish farm owners exist but are usually taken care of privately by the owners who test different methods such as the use of dogs, fencing, and electric fencing but also traps, shooting or even poison.
Although results are preliminary, the conflict seems to have an ecological basis for more then half of the investigated fish farms.
Diet results and landscape analyses in marine fish farms indicate the importance of alternative prey as, in fish farms located in richer food resource areas, even with higher visiting rates, the diet is less based on commercially important prey. Nevertheless, the perceived high damages (by the fish farmers) and the prohibition of use of most mitigation measures (by the nature reserve) is increasing species aversion and may lead to an increase in poaching.
In the trout farms, although otter diet is based on commercially important fish species (trout), its impact on production is, probably, not as high as these preliminary results seem to imply because, as mentioned, it has been impossible to confirm if the origin of the consumed brown trout is from the river or the trout farm without using other elaborate fish bone analyses. For
example, as raised trouts are usually feed with rations that include marine fish flours, strontium (Sr) a metal much more abundant on marine water then on fresh water (Huheey et al. 1993) would probably accumulate on the trout bones of the raised trouts but not of the free ranging ones. Being so, theoretically strontium content analyses (spectrometry) could be performed in trout bones collected from faeces to pin point the trouts origin. This possible method was suggested to us by Dr Lene Jacobson (DIFRES - Denmark) but is yet to be tested.
Additional data and analyses on the fish farms and on predation impacts is certainly necessary for the implementation of effective conflict mitigation strategies and the FRAP project will be a good step on that direction.

Abstract
The degree of conflict between otter conservation and fish farming was assessed at Sado estuary (SW Portugal), using ecological (otter visiting rates to fish farms and consumption of commercial fish) and socio-economic (past and current instruments and policies addressing the conflict and a social impact assessment, including a discourse analysis of relevant stakeholders) parameters.
The study concerned 14 fish farms producing Sparus aurata, Dicentrarchus labrax, Solea senegalensis and Solea solea. Results indicate high visiting rates in most fish farms (average: 76%), although in only 29%, species stocked were the most consumed prey. Other marine species and freshwater prey were the basis of otter diet in the remaining fish farms.
The conflict is quite consensual among most fish farmers, and the results indicate that the perceived conflict by fish farmers has an ecological basis, although there are large gaps between effective and perceived predation.
No specific instruments exist in Portugal to address the conflict, but some not specifically targeted can have an effect (e.g. species protection legislation and aquaculture licensing), although with limitations to effectively contribute to its mitigation (e.g. lack of enforcement and supervision). Formulating and assessing solutions is the following step, using a participatory approach to the development and evaluation of mitigation/compensation strategies, capable of providing an effective reconciliation of the conflict.

Introduction
Conflicts between animal species and humans are well documented and are unavoidable in areas where there is a clear conflict of interests such as the sharing of common resources like space and/or food. Interactions between protected species and the exploitation of biological resources affect several different economic activities and species (e.g. wolfs and cattle raising -Petrucci-Fonseca et al 2000; elephants and crop raiding and infrastructural damage - Sitati et al. 2003; birds and fish farms - Cowx 2003) and, from an ecological perspective, should be viewed as a competition process (Plaganyi &amp;amp; Butterworth, 2002). Fish farming areas and fish eating vertebrates have been widely used to illustrate the nature and extent of such type of conflict (Carss 2003), as well to target the development of solutions to the conflict.
This is the frame of an European project that was designed for the development of a procedural framework for action plans to reconcile conflicts between the conservation of large vertebrates and the use of biological resources (FRAP - Framework for Biodiversity Reconciliation Action Plans - contract number EVK2-CT-2002-00142). The project focuses on fisheries and fisheating vertebrates as a model case and includes an ecological and socio-economic approach using three fish eating species [Eurasian otter Lutra lutra Linnaeus, 1758, great cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis (Blumenbach, 1798) and grey seal Halichoerus grypus (Fabricus, 1791)] and different types of fishery in eight European countries (Klenke 2004).
Portugal is considered to be one of the strongholds of otters (Lutra lutra) in Europe (MacDonald &amp;amp; Mason 1994) and fish farming is a growing economic activity leading to a scenario of conflict of interest. Moreover, otters benefit from a protection status (SNPRCN 1990) and the vast majority of the operative fish farms are located in estuarine areas, which in turn are included in the national network of protected areas due to its high conservation value (ICN 2004). This has resulted in restrictive attitudes to fish farming related activities and adds another conflict element to that scenario. Furthermore, escalating pressures are expected in the future due to the depletion of marine fish stocks and the need to increase fish farming production. Fish farming has been financially encouraged by the EU Community Structural Policy as a way to reduce pressure upon sea fish stocks and, therefore, in Portugal this economic activity grew significantly in the last decade.
The management options in such a many-sided conflict requires an interdisciplinary approach, during the analysis and evaluation of the conflict and when developing a conflict resolution
strategy. The objectives of the study herein reported, that refers exclusively to the Portuguese situation, are to improve the understanding on the predation of otters in fish farms and on the perception of the conflict by the various interest groups, to find sustainable solutions. To achieve such objectives, an integrated approach was adopted, considering ecological and socioeconomic aspects. Formulating and assessing solutions for the local conflict is the expected output of this project. This process will rely on a participatory approach to the development and evaluation of mitigation or compensation strategies, capable of providing an effective reconciliation of the conflict (Santos et al. in press).
Material and methods
Study Area
The Sado river estuary was selected as the FRAP research area in Portugal, as it accounts for almost half of the existing marine fish farms in the country (INE 2002). This area is a good example of a region with a strong potential for the occurrence of conflicts between nature conservation and socio-economic development.
Although this region has a strong urban and industrial occupation, a large part of the Sado estuary is classified as a Nature Reserve due to high biodiversity values. The area supports an extremely important fauna including a resident population of bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus (Montagu, 1821), greater flamingos Phoenicopterus ruber Linnaeus, 1758, water birds [e.g. black-winged stilt Himantopus himantopus (Linnaeus, 1758), curlew Numenius arquata (Linnaeus, 1758), dunlin Calidris alpina (Linnaeus, 1758), grey pluver Pluvialis squatarola (Linnaeus, 1758)] and birds of prey [e.g. marsh harrier Circus aeruginosus (Linnaeus, 1758)], along with the Eurasian otter (ICN 2001). The Sado estuary is also highly valuable as wintering, nesting and feeding zone for migratory birds, being classified also as a special bird protection area (EC Birds Directive) and as a Ramsar Site. Moreover, the area is included in the national list of Natura 2000 Sites, partially due the presence of otters. According to ICN (2004) nation-wide otter survey conducted in 1995 (Trindade et al. 1998), L. lutra is considered a common species in the Sado River Estuary, where the species occupies the full range of 10x10 km UTM squares, being considered a priority area for the otter conservation in national terms (Trindade et al. 1995).
An important area of the Sado estuary is used for fish farming, salt production and intensive agriculture, especially rice plantation. There are extensive salt marshes with many salines still operating in a traditional way, being others converted to commercial fish farms. Other
important economic activities at the study area are forestry and professional fishing, along with manufacturing and services (INE 2002). There is also the presence of industrial plants, such as chemical, electric energy, paper production and naval.
Fish farms in the Sado estuary produce four marine species - gilthead sea bream Sparus aurata Linnaeus, 1758, European sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax (Linnaeus, 1758), Senegal sole Solea senegalensis Kaup, 1858 and common sole Solea solea (Linnaeus, 1758). Gilthead sea bream is the main product (INE 2002). Production is mainly in semi intensive regimes, often recovering old salt production tanks. However, due to the protection statute of the estuary, some constraints on land-use and management practices are enforced in order to preserve habitats and species. A 1990 ICN’s inquire describes that fish losses caused by otter predation are considered very important by fish farmers, although most producers could not quantify them (Trindade 1991). Thus, besides pollution from urban centres and industry, otters also face the threat of disturbance and persecution by fish farmers. However, specific instruments for otter protection are not in place, as a result of its suspected abundance.
Ecological approach
Fourteen semi-intensive fish farms were selected for study (Figure III.3.1) with the aim of assessing otter visiting rates to fish farms and quantifying otter consumption of produced fish species (fish produced with fish farmers’ financial investment). From July 2003 to June 2004, otter visiting rates (VR = number of positive visits /total number of visits) were assessed with weekly surveys for otter signs (e.g. spraints and footprints) along the fish farms perimeters, and at each visit all spraints were collected and footprints destroyed. Seasonal differences in VR were assessed using Friedman test and the spatial ones using the standard chi-square test (Zar 1984).

Figure III.3.1- Surveyed fish farms and fishing sampling sites River Sado estuary: fish farms are identified with codes for purposes of comparison with the socio-economic approach.
A minimum sample of 30 spraints per season per fish farm was used for diet analysis, using laboratorial standard procedures (e.g. Beja 1997). Fish remains were identified using a reference collection made from fish species occurring in the study area. Whenever possible, identification was to the species level and minimum number of individuals consumed was calculated through matching of paired diagnostic bony/skeletal structures (Hansel et al. 1988, Jacobsen &amp;amp; Hansen 1996).
To estimate size of fish consumed by otters, regression equations were used, that allow estimating length and weight based on the dimensions of non-digested fish remains such as jawbones, operculae, vertebrae and other diagnostic bony structures. For some freshwater and brackish water fish species these equations were available in the literature (Prenda et al. 2002). New regression equations were however computed (unpublished data) for gilthead sea bream, European sea bass and soles, the primary focus of this study, and also for black goby Gobius niger Linnaeus, 1758, one of most important alternative prey in terms of biomass in otter diet. The length and weight of ingested crayfish were estimated likewise, using previously available regression equations (Freitas 1999).
Results were calculated as percentage of occurrence (P.O. = number of a particular prey item in all spraints / the sum of all prey items x 100) and as percentage of biomass (P.B. = biomass of a particular species in all spraints / the sum of biomass of all species x 100). Average weights, obtained during fieldwork or through literature (Beja 1996), were assigned for remaining prey.
Statistical tests used to assess seasonal and spatial differences in otter diet were the same as for VR.
The association between otter visiting rates to each fish farm and the consumption of the reared species (P.O.; P.B.) was tested using Spearman correlation coefficients (Zar 1984). This association was also tested seasonally using the mean value of the visiting rates.
All statistical calculations were performed using STATISTICA 6 software and a probability level of a = 0.05.
P Prey availability and prey size range were assessed in the estuary in winter and spring, in 6 sampling sites close to fish farms (Figure III.3.1) using a 4 m beam trawl that was towed for 15 minutes. This technique has been used to characterize the fish assemblage in Sado estuary (Lopes da Cunha 1994, Cabral 1999), and was chosen due to its low selectivity and to allow future comparisons. After collection, specimens were identified and their total length and weight were measured. The abundance was expressed in number of individuals per 1000 m2. Reared fish stocking levels were obtained on the basis of the fish farmers’ information.
Socio-economic approach
The socio-economic approach was developed along two complementary lines: an analysis and evaluation of the instruments and policies that address (directly or indirectly) the conflict and a social impact assessment, with an analysis of the discourse of most of the involved stakeholders.
In order to identify the conflict’s socio-economic context, a study of the institutional and legal framework of relevant sectors (aquaculture and nature conservation) was carried out. To assess the role that fisheries and conservation of biodiversity play within the national, regional and local context, a socio-economic analysis of the study region was also developed considering descriptors such as the general economic structure, the fisheries sector, population, income, labour market and nature protection status. A preliminary analysis of past and current instruments and policies used in Portugal, that might affect the reconciliation between economic activities and nature conservation, was also carried out.
The instruments, classified into three main types - command and control, economic and action directed at civil society - were analysed considering criteria such as cost-effectiveness, dynamic efficiency, management requirements, involvement of stakeholders, perception of fairness and acceptance and compatibility with existing policy framework (OECD 1997, Santos &amp;amp; Antunes 1999).
The social impact assessment, based on open format inductive interviews performed to 31 stakeholders (according to the methodology proposed by IAICGP 1994), provided the basis to perform a discourse analysis of the interviews, known as “critical discourse analysis” (Wood &amp;amp; Kroger 2000). Discourse analysis can help in illuminating the different interests being articulated and struggles between interest groups thus providing a starting point for a negotiation process (MacDonald 2003). This was followed by an exercise aimed to aggregate stakeholders with similar positions around a set of themes, providing ground for a future consensus building process. The NUD*IST1 text analysis software package was used to perform the discourse analysis.
A set of five base groups was created according to their background - fish farmers, other economic agents, governmental, environmentalists and scientists. Thirteen themes were chosen according to the subjects that were more frequently brought up during the discourse by stakeholders: 1. Quality offish produced in the Sado Estuary should be promoted, 2. There is a misunderstanding between fish farmers and the Reserve Administration, 3. The Reserve Administration escalates the conflict, 4. Fish farming is compatible with nature conservation, 5. Fences should be allowed, 6. Otters are a threat to fish farms, 7. Pollution from industries is a major problem, 8. There's a lack of well defined rules for aquaculture, 9. The Reserve Administration lacks means to enforce the law, 10. Cormorants are the real threat to fish farming, 11. Aquaculture is an activity with potential, 12. Fish farmers should get monetary compensations for otter predation, and 13. Only extensive fish farming is compatible with nature conservation.
The following scale was used, to classify the opinion of each stakeholder around each theme:
Agreement: 1; Not clear agreement or disagreement: 0; Disagreement: -1.
For each group, a standard deviation per theme was calculated and the average variability within the group computed as the mean of the standard deviations of the themes. The average variability within groups was discussed considering also the analyst’s perception from the interviews.
A graphical illustration of the positioning of stakeholders towards each theme was performed, in order to understand the variability among groups, i.e. how do they cluster around each theme. A set of graphs (one per theme) were developed, depicting in the XX axis the importance given to a particular theme during the interview (which is assessed through a subjective analysis based on the analyst sensibility) and in the YY axis the frequency with
1 QSR Software, La Trobe University, Australia (http://www.qsr.com.au/software/n4/n4.htm)
which the theme was brought up. Each stakeholder is represented as a numbered and coloured box, representing the number the stakeholder code and the colour the agreement (white), disagreement (black) or lack of opinion (grey) towards the sentence which describes the theme.
Integrated approach
Otter visiting rates to fish farms and consumption of the reared species (P.O. and P.B.) were compared with the conflict perception of the fish farm owners. Fish farmer’s conflict perception was considered “low” when fish farmers were aware of the predation, but did not find it considerable or harmful; “high” when considered harmful; and “none” when the fish farmer was not aware of predation in the fish farm. This classification was used as rank data to relate to VR, P.O. and P.B. using Spearman correlation coefficients (Zar 1984).
Results
Ecological approach: Visiting rates
Otter visiting rates were very high, with half of the fish farms reaching values above 0.8 (80% of the weekly surveys were positive for otter presence) (Table III.3.1). Differences between fish farms were highly significant (/2 = 12.83, p = 0.00), and there were also differences observed among seasons (Friedman’ s /r2 = 9.6, p = 0.02), with autumn and winter showing the highest mean visiting rates (0.82) and spring the lowest (0.69).

Ecological approach: Consumption of produced fish species
Fish were undoubtedly the main component of otter diet at Sado Estuary, representing 87 % of percentage of occurrences and 96 % of biomass (Table III.3.2). Crustaceans, such as the European shore crab Carcinus maenas (Linnaeus, 1758) and especially the American crayfish Procambarus clarkii (Girard, 1852) were the next most consumed prey, representing 11% of all occurrences but only 3% in terms of biomass. Amphibians only represented 2% of percentage of occurrence and lesser than 1% as for biomass. Reptiles were almost absent and insects were excluded from this study since they can be preyed either by fish or amphibians.
In what concerns the percentage of occurrence of fish species, otters seemed to concentrate in non produced species, since the two major groups (freshwater and other marine fish species) represented 56% in otter diet and only 31% of occurrences corresponded to those produced in fish farms (Table III.3.2). However, in terms of percentage of biomass, a fish categories analysis revealed different results: produced fish species, Solea spp., S. aurata and D. labrax were more important (61%) than other marine and freshwater fish species, that together only represented 36% in otter diet.

The greatest contribution in P.O. to wild marine fish species was from Pomatoschistus microps (Kroyer, 1838) (8.9%), Anguilla anguilla (Linnaeus, 1758) (6.6%) and G. niger (6.5%), while Gambusia holbrooki Girard, 1859 (19.8%) and P. clarkii (10.2%) were the most important freshwater species (Table III.3.1). Biomass analysis revealed a different importance rank: mugilids and A. anguilla, both almost with 14%, and G. niger, with 5%, contributed the most within marine fish species, while P. clarkii and black bullhead Ameiurus melas (Rafinesque, 1820) were the most consumed among freshwater species.
In seasonal terms the differences in consumption of produced species was not significant both in P.O. and P.B. terms (Friedman’s P.O.: /r2 = 7.7, p = 0.054; P.B.: /r2 = 5.55, p = 0.14).
The spatial variation analysis (Table III.3.1), however, detected significant differences in diet (P.O.: /2 = 127.9, p = 0.00 P.B.: /2 = 125.15, p = 0.00. In our fish farms otter diet was based in produced fish species (P.O. &gt; 50%) but in four other, their values were below 20%, with one fish farm reaching less than 2%. Considering percentage of biomass, most of the fish farms (10) had P.B. values above 50%, and only one fish farm was below 20%.
No clear relation was observed between otter visiting rates and the consumption of the reared species, either considering seasonal variation (P.O.: rho = -0.738; p = 0.262; P.B.: rho = -0.211; p = 0.789) or spatial variation (P.O.: rho = -0.106; p = 0.718; P.B.: rho = -0.236; p = 0.417).
In view of the results of our sampling approach, fish species assemblage in this area of Sado estuary was not diverse, since only 14 species were captured (Table III.3.3), but clearly dominated by Senegal sea bream Diplodus bellottii (Steindachner, 1882) and golden grey mullet Liza aurata (Risso, 1810). On the other hand, D. labrax was not detected during sampling procedures in 2004, S. senegalensis was 10 times less abundant than the Senegal sea
bream, although being the third most common species. S. aurata was one of the least abundant species in Sado estuary (Table III.3.3).

Socio-economic approach: Socio-economic context and policy analysis
The Portuguese study region can be described as part of an economically depressed area, with a strong environmental protection status although close to urban and industrialized areas. Coastal aquaculture, producing mainly marine fish species, is considered important in the estuarine area, with significant socio-economic impact at the local level2, contrasting with the modest role the sector plays in national terms.
The policy analysis concluded that no specific instruments exist in Portugal to address the FRAP conflict. However, some instruments not specifically targeted to address it can have an effect on the conflict (e.g. species protection legislation, aquaculture licensing, designation of protected areas and EU financial support to aquaculture), although with several limitations to effectively contribute to its mitigation, such as lack of enforcement and supervision and excessive bureaucracy.
2 Six percent of both total and marine fish farms in Portugal are set up in the “Lisboa e Vale do Tejo” (LVT) region. But considering only marine fish farms (i.e., excluding bottom culture and cages), the proportion of units in the LVT region rises up to 56 %, meaning that the region concentrates the largest number of these type of sites in the country (58).
Socio-economic approach: Stakeholders’ discourse analysis
The average variability of opinions towards themes within base groups (e.g. fish farmers, environmentalists) was relatively high (Table III.3.4), which is not surprising, as some of the groups contain actors with a broad spectrum of professional experiences, and some of them contain very few actors.
Table III.3.4 - Number of actors and average variability of opinions within base groups submitted to discourse analysis
	Environmentalists	Scientists	Economic Agents	Governmental	Fish Industry
Number of actors	4	3	2	12	10
Average variability	0.57	0.32	0.85	0.73	0.37
The storylines (themes) have been analysed in detail, in order to perceive how stakeholders gather around each one of them. This analysis allows the identification of clusters of agreement/disagreement towards each of the relevant themes, which is essential in order to identify a consensus basis to start the participatory process.
In what concerns the existence of a conflict between the otter’s presence and fish farms, which was the most important theme as it was the core of the discussion and as it will divide actors in the search for a conflict solution, opinions are severely bipolarized, as almost all fish farmers and related government actors believed the activity is being strongly damaged by otter’s predation, while environmentalists, the Reserve Administration and related government actors believed that the predation is not considerable (Figure III.3.2). Some of the themes pointed out that the lack of well-defined rules and communication between stakeholders are also some of the greatest obstacles for attaining solutions for this conflict.
Figure 111.3.2 - Positioning of stakeholders towards the theme “Otters are a threat to fish farms”. White boxes represent stakeholders who agree with the theme, black boxes represent those who disagree, and grey boxes represent stakeholders who do not have a clear opinion or do not know whether the theme is true or not. The codes are used in order to keep the anonymity of the stakeholders, and are related to the base group from which the stakeholder comes from (F - Fish farmers, S - Scientists, E - Environmentalists, G - Governmental).
Integrated approach
Otter visiting rates to fish farms, consumption of reared species and conflict perception results are presented in Table III.3.1. There was no correlation between perception and any of the otter damage surrogates (VR: rho = -0.274, p = 0.343; P.O.: rho = -0.231, p = 0.427; P.B.: rho = -0.034, p = 0.909).
It is noticeable that from the three fish farms with the highest otter visiting rates (P2, P4, P10), only one of them (P4) coincides with one of the highest fish farmers’ conflict perception, but, on the other hand, is one where the consumption of produced fish species attains the lowest values. At P4 the consumption of the produced species is the lowest verified but the fish farmer believes he is being highly predated, while the P10 owner believes that no considerable predation is being done in his fish farm, although it has the highest value of consumed biomass of produced fish species. On the other hand, E3 perception results are in agreement with VR but not with P.B. (Table 111.3.1), although these were not considered reliable due to the reduced number of scats (n = 12) used to ascertain predation.
Discussion and Conclusion
Otters were feeding in the fish farms, but also in the estuary and in the surrounding freshwater bodies. Although visiting rates were high and more or less constant throughout the year they do not reflect predation upon stocks. Therefore, reasons for otter marking behaviour at fish farms must be further explored along with landscape analysis. Nevertheless, the conflict seems to have an ecological basis for more than half of the investigated fish farms. That is, even if considering that not all produced species consumed by otters were captured inside the fish farms (e.g. soles), and thus excluding those fish farms that have high P.B. but low VR, nearly 65% of the studied fish farms are probably being damaged by otter predation. The level of damage is dependent on how many otters are visiting each fish farm, and although efforts are being done in assessing those numbers, using molecular analysis of faecal material, results are still preliminary.
Diet results suggest the importance of alternative prey, since fish farms located in areas with high alternative food availability, even when being highly visited by otters, have a diet less based on produced fish. Moreover, preliminary analysis of landscape features, which are additionally being assessed in this study, seem to indicate that the existence of preventive measures (fences, electric fences, dogs), together with the abundance of alternative prey, which in turn is related to a low distance to freshwater, influence otter damages by reducing its impact.
Most of the available information on otters in Portugal is spread in technical national reports and concern otter distribution and food habits. Some of these studies analysed otter diet in estuarine and marine environments (e.g. Gomes et al. 1989, Beja 1991) but only one focused on otter predation in fish farms and in a different river basin - Mira estuary (Trigo 1994).
Like in the vast majority of the published diet studies (for a review see Kruuk 1995), including those in fish farming areas (e.g. Knollseisen &amp;amp; Kranz 1998, Adamek et al. 2003, Lanszki &amp;amp; Molnar 2003), the otter diet in Sado estuary was clearly dominated by fish both in terms of percentage of occurrence and biomass. The diet analysis revealed a high variety of fish species, which reflects the diversity of the fish community at Sado estuary (Amorim 1982, Lopes da Cunha 1994, Cabral 1999). Nevertheless, produced fish species were undoubtedly the most important food source, especially Solea spp. Similar results have been observed on fish ponds of Central Europe where the carp, Cyprinus carpio Linnaeus, 1758 stocked in open ponds at high densities, is the main prey consumed throughout the year (Geidezis 1998, Adamek et al
2003). However, they contradict those obtained by Trigo (1994) in the Mira estuary, where the
presence of produced fish in the diet (sea bream, sea bass and soles) was extremely reduced, but this might result from the fact that fish farms were partially fenced.
Although the presence of soles in Sado estuary used to be relatively common, especially S. solea (Cabral 1999, 2000), more recent surveys (e.g. Amaral 2001) indicate a marked population decline that can be the result of anthropogenic actions, such as pollution and illegal fishing (Costa &amp;amp; Cabral 1999) or naturally induced fluctuations (e.g. recruitment success due to environmental determinants) (Cabral 1998). Despite the previously reported presence of a high flatfish community diversity (Cabral 2000), during the present study only one species was found, S. senegalensis. Although soles stocks inside fish farms are low, their consumption is very high. This may be related to its availability outside the fish farms, suggesting that otters are catching soles also from the estuary.
S. aurata, was the second most important prey for otter and D. labrax was almost absent in the otter diet. Since these two species proved to be less abundant in the study area, and some other studies carried out in this region have showed similar results (Lopes da Cunha 1994), even when using a different, and perhaps more appropriate fishing gear, like a trammel net (Amorim 1982), it can be assumed that otters are capturing these species inside the ponds.
Eels and mugilids, together, form a substantial proportion of the diet in terms of biomass, a result already reported in areas near coastal lagoons, marshes and estuaries (Beja 1991). The importance of both species can be explained either by otters preference for foraging near the bottom (eels) or by the high fish availability (mugilids).
The small importance of freshwater species can be explained by the low freshwater availability in the estuary and consequently, low number and small size of freshwater prey, like the most common prey, namely G. holbrooki and P. clarkii. Their importance to otters in terms of energy is low, especially when compared to larger sized fish that have a lower percentage of occurrences such as the eel, mugilids and the black goby. Despite American crayfish being an important component of otter diet in Iberian streams (e.g. Beja 1996) and, according to Trigo (1994) at another fish farming area, the second most consumed prey group, its importance in the present study was reduced.
Also worth discussing is the great variability observed in the produced fish consumption among fish farms. As mentioned previously, this spatial variability may be explained by landscape factors, which are being investigated in the frame of FRAP project. In spite of this effect of the spatial scale, considering the total consumed biomass of stocked fish, as reported by fish farm owners, it seems to be neglectful in relation to the overall production, even assuming high otter densities (16 individuals per 100 km2, the highest reported density in a fish farming area within
FRAP areas resulting from our preliminary molecular results), and knowing that the daily food consumption of an adult Eurasian otter is 0.6 kg day-1 (Reuther 1993), we end up with a total consumption of3.5 tons per year which represents less than 1%of the reported overall production.
The social analysis of the conflict enabled to conclude that there are serious communication gaps and problems between key stakeholders of the process, such as between fish farmers and the officials from the Reserve, which might seriously difficult the attaining of solutions to the conflict, as the Reserve has legal power above a whole set of aspects related to fish farming activity in the Sado estuary (licensing, land-use change, construction of fences, effluents).
It was observed that some actors’ positions are closer to actors that do not belong to their base groups (e.g. fish farmers, environmentalists), which may point to the conclusion that opinions are divided in the whole, more because of different ideas towards the management methods and solutions to solve the conflict, than because of a conflict of interests, which would deepen the differences of opinion between base groups.
The geographical scale of the model conflict is still rather small and therefore the existence of effective mitigation measures is for now relevant only for local level socio-economic development. However, if fish farming is to be developed and increased in the future, as some stakeholders believe, impacts on the socio-economic context of the Setúbal Peninsula subregion might start to gain importance leading to an urgent call for the development of measures to deal with this type of conflicts. Therefore, a scientific assessment of the real degree of conflict is of most importance.
The socio-economic analysis also showed that there are no environmental policy instruments that specifically address this conflict. The identification of instruments to address this specific conflict will be performed through a participatory decision-making process, involving main stakeholders. A good scientific basis, improvement of communication and the establishment of well-defined rules for the economic activity in the area seem to be key factors to explore in the participatory process of the final phase of the project.
The integrated results show that, although a significant number of fish farmers, who suffer from otter predation, were aware of their existence, there are large gaps between effective and perceived predation. Moreover, two of the fish farmers with the higher otter visiting rates do not perceived any predation in their fish farms. Nevertheless, it should be stressed, that there were no correlations between visiting rates and consumption of reared species, and that, for now, the best measurement of damage is P.B. But true impact on fish stocks would require far more data than is available to the authors, including the already referred information on otter
numbers, and far more precise data on fish stock numbers. Meanwhile, the perceived high damages (by the fish farmers) and the prohibition of use of most mitigation measures (by the nature reserve) contribute to a rise in species aversion and may lead to an increase in poaching. Although there are many otter impact studies on inland fish farms in Europe (Adámek et al. 2003, Lanszki &amp;amp; Molnár 2003), this is the first published study on marine fish farms in Portugal and the methodology and results reveal the added complexity found in estuaries. This is also the first integrated socio-economic and ecological approach on the theme and the overall result reveals the importance of this combined effort as certainly more effective and acceptable solutions for the conflict will arise.

Abstract
Conflicts between the conservation of large vertebrates and the use of biological resources are common and affect many species and activities. The vast majority of the Portuguese fish farms are located in estuarine protected areas and production of marine fish species is done mostly in semi-intensive regimes and with the imposition of some restrictive rules. This exposed form of production is prone to predation by wild animals. The Eurasian otter Lutra lutra is widely distributed in Portugal and this combination of factors has led to a conflict scenario between fish farming and the conservation of otters. This study aimed to determine the influence of landscape factors in otter damages in fish farms of Sado estuary (SW Portugal) and the usefulness of visiting rates and otter diet as surrogates for damage assessment. The impact of otter predation (damage) in each fish farm was assessed by combining the percentage of consumption of reared species with otter daily food consumption, daily visitation rates and number of otters visiting each fish farm. Landscape descriptors were recorded in the field and several landscape metrics were calculated using a geographic information system. Multiple linear regressions were used to identify key landscape factors for damage and for damage surrogates. Distance to streams and refuge cover areas were identified as key landscape features to damages. This information can be used as a management tool in landscape planning, specifically in estuaries with fish farming activity, as high risk farms can be identified and selectively protected.
Keywords: otter diet, otter numbers, damages, conflict, risk assessment.
Introduction
Conflicts between the conservation of large vertebrates and the use of biological resources are common and affect many species and activities. The use of fish by humans and animals has set the stage for conflict. Many large fish predators (e.g. seals, dolphins, otters, cormorants, and herons) compete with humans by eating species of interest to man (Silva et al. 2002, Carss
2003,	Klenke et al. in press, Brotons et al. 2008) including reared fish (Skaren 1990, Trindade 1991, Kloskowski 2000, 2005a, Lekuona 2002, Carss 2003, Opacak et al. 2004, Quick et al.
2004,	Freitas et al., 2007, Klenke et al. in press). Harbour seals Phoca vitulina and grey seals Halichoerus grypus were reported to predate on 81% of the marine salmon farms in Scotland (Quick et al. 2004) and the impact of cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo, and grey herons Ardea cinerea was estimated to be 53% and 11%, respectively, of the annual fish farming yield in the Arcachon Bay of southwest France (Lekuona 2002). Damage assessments are mostly based on diet results or stakeholder information (Kloskowski 2005a,b, Lekuona 2002, Quick et al. 2004, Opacak et al. 2004), but more complex approaches combining species ecology and numbers, landscape ecology, and stakeholders perception have also been pursued (Carss 2003, Klenke et al. in press). For example, for cormorant damage, large scale landscape approaches have identified the key factors involved. Cormorant conflicts on a pan-European scale showed similar distribution patterns: low altitudes (&amp;lt;500m); wide (10-50m) lower and middle river stretches; and access to shallow (&amp;lt;50m deep) inshore waters in coastal areas. Overall, most conflict cases were reported in nutrient-rich (i.e. eutrophic) waters, particularly in freshwater aquaculture ponds, lakes, and coastal areas, supporting the idea that cormorant distribution is, in part at least, determined by the nutrient status of these waters (Carss 2003). Eurasian otters Lutra lutra and managed fisheries in Central Europe, mostly carp Cyprinus carpio production, is another example of a widely studied conflict, focusing on otter diet (Gossow &amp;amp; Kranz 1998, Kloskowski 2000, 2005b, Adamek et al. 2003, Lanszki &amp;amp; Molnar 2003, Jacobsen 2005, Polednik 2005), damage assessment (Bodner 1995a, Gossow &amp;amp; Kranz 1998, Kloskowski 2005b, Polednik 2005, Klenke et al. in press), damage prevention (Bodner 1995b, Gossow &amp;amp; Kranz 1998, Leblanc 2003, Klenke et al. in press), and compensation schemes (Gossow &amp;amp; Kranz 1998, Schwerdtner &amp;amp; Gruber 2007, Klenke et al. in press). This type of biological and socio-economic information is critical for resource management, conflict resolution and species conservation, because it allows a wise application of mitigation, compensation, and species protection measures.
For a quarter of century, fish farming has been the world's fastest growing food production sector, sustaining an annual growth rate of 8.8% since 1970 (FAO 2007). Aquaculture has also been financially encouraged by the European Union Structural Policy as a way to reduce pressure upon wild stocks. As a result, this economic activity grew significantly in Portugal in the early 1990s (INE 2007). The vast majority of Portuguese fish farms are located in estuarine areas and production is a mixture between traditional and modern methods. The rearing of marine fish species is done in extensive or semi-intensive regimes by recovering old salt production ponds and using the tidal cycles to circulate water in the tanks but it also includes
pre-timed mechanical feeders and electric devices to keep water oxygen and temperature levels. Most estuaries where production occurs are included in the national network of protected areas due to their high conservation value (ICN 2004); in 2001, 56% of all marine fish farms in Portugal were located in the Tejo and Sado river estuaries (INE 2002), both classified as Nature Reserves. This has resulted in the imposition of some restrictions on fish farming management (e.g. fencing of property is prohibited).
This exposed form of production is prone to predation by wild animals and so, in 1990, a questionnaire was sent by the Portuguese Institute for Nature Conservation (Trindade 1991) to fish farmers, with the intent of determining the role of predation on fish losses. Response rate was relatively low (29%) but revealed the emerging conflict with fish-eating predators. The Eurasian otter was the most commonly mentioned predator, causing damages all year round. Some fish farmers perceived the species as a pest. However, producers could not quantify their losses and nearby farms reported contrasting damages. Similar results were obtained by Santos -Reis et al. (2007) who found that, overall, 40% of the marine and trout farms were visited by otters and that fish farmers used preventive methods, including dogs, net and electric fencing, but also illegal trapping, shooting, and poisoning. The Eurasian otter is widely distributed in Portugal and is listed in the Portuguese Red Data Book of Terrestrial Vertebrates in the “Least Concern” category (Cabral et al. 2005). Nevertheless, in Europe, the species is still a matter of concern and therefore considered “Near Threatened” (IUCN 2006).
This combination of factors: extensive fish production, estuaries as protected areas, production restrictive rules, otter nation-wide distribution, the use of illegal predation preventive measures and conservation status has led to a conflict scenario between fish farming and the conservation of otters. Furthermore, escalating pressures are expected in the future due to the continuous depletion of marine fish stocks and the desire to increase fish farming production.
We conducted this study to determine the influence of landscape factors on otter visiting rates and fish losses at fish farms. We also assessed the usefulness of visiting rates and/or otter diet as a surrogate for damage assessment. We expected that key landscape features might be used as a management tool in landscape planning, specifically in estuaries with fish farming activity, to identify and protect high risk farms.
Materials and Methods
Study Area
The river Sado estuary was selected as study area. An important part of this estuary is used for fish farming, salt production and agriculture, especially rice plantations. Fish farms in the Sado estuary are managed semi-intensively and primarily involve four marine fish species - gilthead sea bream Sparus aurata, European sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax L, Senegal sole Solea senegalensis, and common sole Solea solea (INE 2002, 2007). Although this region has a strong urban and industrial influence, viz., Setúbal, a densely populated city with its associated industrial complex, a large part of the estuary (2.3 km2) is classified as a Nature Reserve (Sado Estuary Nature Reserve - 38O27’34.09”N 8O45’39.44”W). The area is highly valuable as a wintering, nesting and feeding zone for migratory birds and is classified as a Special Protection Area (EC Birds Directive), a Ramsar Site and included in the national list of Natura 2000 Sites, in part because of the presence of otters. The protection statute of the estuary imposes some restrictions on land-use and management practices are enforced to preserve habitats and species (e.g. fencing and construction on wetlands is not allowed).
Otters are common in the estuary (Trindade et al. 1998) and produced fish species are part of their diet (Freitas et al. 2007). Damages are reported by local fish farmers as significant, and form the basis of an escalating conflict (Freitas et al. 2007).
For this study 14 fish farms were selected (Figure III.4.1), varying in size, number of ponds and stocking levels (Table III.4.1). Their distribution is clustered, a common pattern in estuaries and particularly in the study area.

Field Data sampling
Surveys of the fish farm outside perimeter (enclosing all ponds) were conducted weekly from July 2003 to June 2004 to assess otter visiting rates to the fish farms and to collect spraints for otter diet analysis. Every sign of otter presence (e.g. spraints and footprints) was recorded for a posteriori mapping of marking points. In each survey, all spraints were collected and labelled and footprints destroyed. Spraints were classified as fresh (from the previous night) or old (up to one week old). Old spraints can be determined by their dried surface and solid consistency, whereas fresh spraints from the previous day still have a wet and soft consistency (Mason &amp;amp; Macdonald 1987). Bank vegetation, bank structure, hinterland use, alternative (non-reared) prey availability (empirical assessment based on the hinterland - e.g. estuary vs dense marsh - and on the existence and prey carrying capacity of close-by fresh water sources) and existence of preventive measures (wire-mesh or electric fences, dogs) were recorded in each fish farm for use as descriptive factors in our landscape analyses (Table III.4.2).

Data analyses
Otter visiting Rates
Weekly otter visiting rates (VR) were calculated for each fish farm (VR = number of positive surveys for otter presence /total number of surveys*100). Daily otter visiting rates (VRMLE) were estimated using the spraint categories described earlier (fresh or old) and a maximum likelihood function estimate developed by Gruber et al. (2008) that gave us a measurement of the probability of otter visit per day.
Otter diet
Prey remains obtained from otter spraints were identified using a reference collection. Whenever possible, identification was made to species level and minimum number of individuals consumed was calculated through matching of paired diagnostic bony/skeletal structures. Size of prey consumed by otters was assessed using regression equations that allow estimating length and weight based on the dimensions of non-digested remains (for details see Freitas et al. 2007).
Otter diet results were calculated as percentage of occurrence (P.O. = number of individuals of a particular prey item in all spraints / the sum of individuals of all prey items x 100) and as percentage of biomass, i.e. weight consumed (P.B. = biomass of a particular species in all spraints / the sum of biomass of all species x 100). Size of fish consumed at each fish farm in each season was compared to prey availability in the estuary (fish size and abundances sampled using a beam trawl, in sites close to fish farms) and in the fish farms (sampling inside the ponds with a drag net and fish farmers’ stocking information) to assess the origin of the prey captured by the otter (fish farm vs estuary) and to estimate otter predation (P.O. and P.B of reared fish) in each fish farm (for details see Freitas et al. 2007).
Number of otters
Dallas et al. 1999), were used for individual typing. The primers were fluorescently labelled and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products of microsatellite loci were genotyped on ABI 310 sequence analyser (Applied Biosystems), with a fluorescently labelled size standard (Rox 350).
To reduce the errors of mistyping, each locus was amplified by PCR at least 4 times following the multiple tubes approach (Taberlet et al. 1996, Gagneux et al.1997).
Only genotypes that achieved 95% estimated probability of reliability (software RELIOTYPE -Miller et al. 2002) were accepted. As the same individual can be sampled more then once (several spraints from the same otter) software GIMLET (Valiere 2002) was used to group data and identify individual genotypes. The typing process was calibrated using a genetic profile of the species obtained from 20 individuals found dead (mostly road kills) in southern Portugal (Beja et al. 2004) and stored at the “biological samples databank” of the Centro de Biologia Ambiental - Carnivore Conservation Research Group (Lisbon). The rate of genotyping success was assessed by dividing the number of faecal samples yielding reliable genotypes by the number of samples yielding a successfully DNA extraction (Prigioni et al. 2006).
Damage assessment
The impact of otter predation in each fish farm represents the sum of the losses of each of the three reared species (sole, sea bream, sea bass). Results are expressed in kg of lost produced fish (D_Kg) and in economic loss (D_Euros). D_kg was assessed by multiplying: i) the P.B. of each of the three produced species (sea bream -P.B.Sa; sea bass - P.B.Dl and soles P.B.Ssp); ii) the daily food consumption of an adult Iberian otter (DFC) (0.75 kg/day - J. Ruiz-Olmo pers. com. using captive individuals.); iii) otter daily visiting rates (VRMLE) to each fish farm; iv) 365 days and v) the respective number of otters visiting the fish farm (NbLl) (Table III.4.2). The economic loss was calculated by multiplying the D_Kg of each fish species by its price on the local market (Table III.4.2). An overall value, that is, the losses of the three produced species, was then summed for each fish farm.
Landscape descriptors
In addition to the descriptors recorded in the field (bank vegetation and structure, hinterland, preventive measures, alternative prey), several landscape metrics (distances, areas in buffers) were calculated using a geographic information system (GIS) containing digitized military charts (1:25 000 - IGEOE - Portuguese Military Institute), aerial photographs, GPS field
information and several constructed information layers, specifically a theme with all existing fish farms, freshwater pools, rivers, streams, brooks and ditches (Table III.4.2).
Statistical Analyses
Spatial variation in otter visiting rates, consumption of reared species in terms of occurrences (CPsp_P.O.) and biomass (CPsp_P.B.) and damages in terms of fish (D_kg) and economic loss (D_Euros) was assessed using standard chi-square tests (Zar 1999). The association between these variables was tested using Spearman correlation coefficients (Zar 1999).
VR, VRMLE, CPsp_P.O. and CPsp_P.B. were considered potential surrogates for otter damage and used as dependent variables. Correlation results to these variables were used to select landscape descriptors for further analyses. Normality of all selected variables was tested using the Shapiro-Wilks statistic (w-statistic) (Zar 1999), and, when needed, variables were transformed to provide the best w-statistic value. Selection among correlated explanatory variables to include in the regression analyses was done according to their relation to the dependent variable. Multiple linear regression (backwards stepwise) (Sokal &amp;amp; Rohlf 1995) was used to identify key landscape factors for damage and for damage surrogates.
All statistical calculations were performed using SPSS 15 software.
Results
Otter visiting rates
Weekly otter visiting rates (Table III.4.3) were very high, with half of the fish farms showing VR values above 0.8 (80% of the weekly surveys were positive for otter presence) and only two, values below 0.5. The probability of daily visits by otters, although also relatively high, best represents the highly significant spatial variability (Table III.4.3) (VR - /2 = 84.0; p &amp;lt;0.0001; VRMLE - /2 = 165.2.0; p &amp;lt;0.0001).

Otter diet
Fish were the main component of otter diet at the studied fish farms, representing 87 % of occurrences and 96 % of consumed biomass. Although otters seem to concentrate on wild fish species (P.O.= 56% - freshwater and other marine fish species), 31% of occurrences corresponded to reared species (CPsp_P.O.) and the importance of produced fish species increased when biomass was considered (CPsp_P.B.= 61%), although a significant spatial variation was observed. (CPsp_P.O.: /2 = 127.9; p &amp;lt;0.0001; CPsp_P.B.: /2 = 125.15; p &amp;lt;0.0001) (for detailed results see Freitas et al. 2007, Santos-Reis et al. in press).
Otter abundance
molecular analysis revealed that the minimum number of otters visiting each of the studied fish farms varied between 1-7 individuals (Table III.4.3).
Damage assessment
The yearly impact of otter predation (D_kg, D_Euros) was significantly different across fish farms (/2 &gt; 1500; p &amp;lt;0.0001) and ranged from irrelevant (12kg - 150€) to fairly high (434kg -5,775.52€) (Table III.4.4) with an average of 100kg - 1,685.00€/year. Additionally, some farms may have similar damages in weight consumed but very different economic losses (P2 and P6) or vice-versa (P6 and P16) due to differences in the market prices of each produced species.

Key landscape features for damages
Because weekly and daily otter visiting rates and consumption of reared species in occurrences and biomass were highly correlated (Table III.4.5), for the follow-up analyses, we first selected the response variables with higher correlation to the explanatory variables. These were otter daily visiting rates (VRMLE) and consumption of reared species in biomass (CPsp_P.B). Moreover, otter daily visiting rates best represent the variability between fish farms and consumption of reared species in biomass more realistically defines otter consumption in terms of size of fish (which in turn influences losses to fish farm) (Freitas et al. 2007).

Contrary to the expectations, no clear relation was found between visiting rates (VRMLE) and the consumption of the stocked species (CPsp_P.B.) (Table III.4.5).
The landscape descriptors with the highest associations (r &gt; 0.6; p&lt;0.03; a = 13) to CPsp_P.B. were: distance to running fresh waters [ditches (-); streams and brooks (+)]; distance to refuge cover areas (+); area of fish farms (+); area of villages (+); natural bank structure (+); and alternative prey (-) (Table III.4.5). Nevertheless, the best model for key landscape features only included the positive influence of distance to the nearest refuge cover areas and the negative influence of the distance to the nearest ditch:
CPsp_P.B. = 53 + 66 Me_5NRCA - 65 Me_5ND (R2 = 0.84; F1;13 = 30.6; a &amp;lt;0.0001).
The landscape descriptors most associated to otter visiting rates (VRMLE) were semi-natural bank structure (+), alternative prey (+), area of refuge cover area in a 1 km buffer around the fish farm (+) and preventive measures (-), but none of these associations were significant (r &gt; 0.4; p&lt;0.25; a = 13) (Table III.4.5). Additionally, preventive measures (PM) could not be normalized and so, although it is the variable with the highest negative correlation to VRMLE, it was excluded from the analyses. As a result, the best model for explaining otter visiting rates is significant but weak and includes the positive influence of near by refuge cover areas: VRMLE = 0.173 +0.026 A1KM_RCA (R2 = 0.54; F1;13 = 10.0; a = 0.014).
Most probably because the formula for calculating “real” damages (see Methods -Damage assessment and Table III.4.2) uses both VRMLE and CPspP.B., the landscape descriptors significantly associated to the calculated damages (D_kg; D_€) were a mixture of the ones associated to those surrogate variables when considered independently: bank structure [natural (-), semi-natural (+) and artificial (-)]; preventive measures (-); distance to ditches (-); and width of the nearest stream (-) (Table III.4.5). Both expressions of damage (kg and euros) revealed similar explanatory models, being the one using D_kg as dependent variable the strongest and including the positive influence of semi-natural bank structure and of near by brooks, and the negative influence of ditches:
D_kg = -1.56 + 0.01 SNBS + 1.77 M_5NB - 1.09 Me_5ND (R2 = 0.59; F1;13 = 6.25; a = 0.017).
Discussion
Estuaries are highly productive with high levels of biodiversity, including otters. Their conservation role has been recognised, benefiting, nowadays, often from the classification of protected areas. Additionally, these areas have attracted many important economic activities that generate significant income and employment (e.g. as salt producers). Currently, they have a high potential as semi-intensive fish farming areas that may produce fish and reduce pressure
over the depleted sea stocks. Safeguarding and managing these estuaries depends therefore on the ability to find solutions that reconcile both nature conservation and sustainable economic development. Fish farming, and specifically semi-intensive fish farming, may be reconcilable with conservation if some precautionary management measures are taken in terms sustainable development of the farming activities.
The issue of predation on fish farms in the Sado Estuary is bipolarizing. On the one hand fish farmers are aware of the existence of otter predation and privately use whatever means they can to keep otters out (including illegal killing). On the other hand, managers of the Sado Estuary nature reserve, aware of the predation as well as of the weakness of the monitoring system for the control of illegal actions, still forbid the use of any mitigation measures to prevent predation. The Nature Reserve has legal jurisdiction over licensing, land-use change, construction of fences and effluents, and hence conservation decisions can impact fish farming activity in the Sado estuary. There are no instruments in place to ensure the attainment of the objectives of maintaining viable species population and sustainable economic activities (Freitas et al. 2007, Santos-Reis et al. in press).
Damage assessment is a laborious task, depending on difficult-to-obtain ecological data (e.g. predator diet and average consumption per day, number of predators and number of their visits to production site). In our approach, the impact of otter predation in each fish farm, in each year, was assessed by combining the percentage of consumption of reared species with otter daily food consumption, daily visiting rates and number of otters visiting each fish farm. With this elaborate and complete approach we wanted to identify not only the real damages, but also the best surrogate measure so that the issuing of mitigation or compensation measures permits could be based on an effective and easily obtained measure of suffered damage or predation risk.
Produced fish species in the Sado estuary are undoubtedly an important otter food source and otters are feeding in the fish farms, as nearly 65% of the studied fish farms are being damagedin some way by otter predation, nevertheless otters are also feeding in the estuary and in the surrounding freshwater bodies (Freitas et al. 2007). Visiting rates were quite high and the fact that there were significant spatial differences, both in the consumption of the reared species and otter visiting rates, enhanced the probability of existence of important explanatory landscape variables that were pinpointed by the regression models. Both dependent variables were influenced, although on different levels, by refuge cover areas, alternative prey, streams, ditches and bank structure. Surprisingly, visiting rates did not reflect predation upon stocks and shared landscape descriptors frequently had opposite effects. A possible explanation to why
visiting rates do not correlate with consumption of reared species is that otters may regularly visit fish farms, not to predate, but to scent mark. That is, some fish farms might be important territory sites, but not as feeding areas, and are therefore territorially marked but not heavily predated. This rationalization is supported by the results: fish farms located in areas with high alternative food availability and refuge (typically near streams), even when being highly visited by otters (VRMLE positively influenced by near by refuge cover areas), had a diet less based on produced fish (CPsp_P.B. positively influenced by the distance to streams and refuge cover areas). This contrasting result revealed, and helped explain, key landscape factors to damages in general. Thus, damages are higher in fish farms further away from water lines of some importance (streams and brooks), especially if the fish farm is close to ditches that may act like “roads” for otters, but which alone do not have enough carrying capacity.
Moreover, the existence of preventive measures (fences, electric fences, dogs) influenced otter damages by reducing its impact. Mitigation methods, such as ordinary and electric fencing, are available and fairly efficient when correctly applied.
Estuaries are complex and productive systems and that usually makes any management task very difficult to keep simple. Being so, and although being the easiest to assess, otter visiting rates to fish farms were not correlated to the predation of reared fish species and, therefore, not a very accurate surrogate for damages (the fish farm with the lowest level of predation was the second most frequently visited by otters - P2). Nevertheless, it was highly correlated to the number of otters visiting each fish farm (Table III.4.5) which also greatly influences damages. Even so, it seems necessary to look at otter diet as the best surrogate to otter damages.
Meanwhile, the perceived high damages (by the fish farmers) and the prohibition of use of most mitigation measures (by the nature reserve) contribute to enlarge species aversion and may lead to an increase in illegal killing. If fish farming is to continue to rise in importance in the future, as some stakeholders believe, impacts on the socio-economic context might start to gain importance leading to an urgent call for the development of measures to deal with this type of conflicts.
fish-eating predators, would be informative to fish farmers and the nature reserve administration, helping to decide about the adequate mitigation measures or to give guidelines during site selection for the installation of new fish farming facilities.

Abstract
With the decline of sea stocks worldwide, the importance of aquaculture activities, particularly in those regions where fish are an important human food source, gained relevance both in economic terms and human well-being (e.g., easier and cheap access to fish products) and this has being acknowledged through the present EU incentives to this economic activity. This is the case of the Mediterranean region, where fish farms can be found both inland and in coastal areas. The region, however, is also rich in fish-eating predators and therefore farmed fishes are highly prone to predation leading to conflicts between production and conservation interests.
To address this human-wildlife conflict, and contribute to a reconciliation strategy, a study was undertaken focusing on the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) a species of conservation concern particularly in the Mediterranean region, but that in Portugal shows a widespread distribution and a high abundance, suggesting a higher potential for conflict.
To assess the existing level of conflict in Portugal, an inventory of fish farms was conducted, followed by interviews to farm owners to evaluate otter presence and damage perception. Results showed that otters frequently used fish farming areas and fish farmers perceived them as a problem, and use different methods of deterrence (e.g. fencing, and dogs) or direct persecution (trapping, shooting or even poisoning) to reduce the predator’s impact.
To further understand the predation/reconciliation issue (namely the real predation impact and factors that might influence it), two areas, representing the two existing types of production, were further studied: a freshwater trout farm (Côa River, Central E region - one fish farm) and a group of estuarine fish farms (Sado estuary, SW - 14 fish farms). In both areas, consumption of commercial fish species was used as a surrogate for otter damage. Thus, otter diet and the influence of the surplus of trophic resources, represented by the presence of farmed fishes, cumulatively to natural prey found either in the river or in the estuary, were evaluated. In the Sado estuary we further assessed otter visiting rates to fish farms and related it to landscape
factors and other resources availability. Consumption of commercial species by otters was confirmed in both areas, but the impact, and therefore the potential for reconciliation, differs. Due to the seasonal constancy in the availability of trouts at Coa inland farm, the observed otter specialization in rainbow trout represents an extreme opportunistic behavior, suggesting the need of an effective mitigation strategy. At Sado estuary, results indicate that although the perceived conflict by fish farmers has an ecological basis, there are large gaps between effective and perceived predation based both on otter visiting rates and farmed fish consumption at the fish farm level; furthermore, distance to rivers and better refuge cover areas were identified as key landscape features promoting damage. This suggests different reconciliation strategies in both farm types which may vary from mitigation, to compensation and educational efforts. Moreover these results provide a management tool in landscape planning, as high risk farms can be identified and selectively protected. In the current environmental and economic scenario, otter predation in fish farming areas must be viewed as a true conservation and management problem, being crucial to develop strategies capable of providing an effective reconciliation of this conflict. Insights resulting from the studies herein described represent a major contribution but, to propose adequate management measures, further knowledge is still needed.
Introduction
Landscape humanisation is a key underlying process in human-wildlife conflicts due to the direct consequence of habitat loss/degradation and also the repulsive (increased persecution) or attractive (resource surplus) effect it may have on wild species inhabiting the areas subject to these anthropic influences, as well as its surroundings. Conflicts of this sort are described wherever human footprint reaches moderate to high levels and reconciliation emerges as the best solution for long-term sustainability. However, reconciliation is a complex issue and depends on the nature and extent of the conflict which in turn is determined by the natural characteristics of the landscape and the management choices made by man in view of his needs. Examples of conflicts are numerous and increasing, widely documented in literature and for many the key-actors and causes of conflict have already been identified (e.g. Colobus monkeys and coconut harvesters - Siex &amp;amp; Struhsaker 1999; wolfs and cattle breeders - Mech et al. 2000; Petrucci-Fonseca et al. 2000; birds and wine grape producers - Somers &amp;amp; Morris 2002; lynx and sheep breeders - Stahl et al. 2002; African carnivores and cattle breeders - Ogada et al. 2003; birds and fish farmers - Cowx 2003; elephants and farmers - Sitati et al. 2005). Effective reconciliation strategies are, however, fewer because its design requires a high level of
ecological knowledge, a comprehensive social and socio-economic evaluation, a strong degree of public involvement and willingness, and appropriate policies and instruments.
Among acknowledged conflicts, those between fisheries and fish-eating predators are one of the most often addressed (Skarén 1990, Trindade 1991, Kloskowski 2000, 2005, Lekuona 2002, Silva et al. 2002, Carss 2003, Opacak et al. 2004, Quick et al. 2004, Freitas et al. 2007, Brotons et al. 2008, Klenke et al. in press, Václavíková et al. 2010) and some conflict reconciliation measures/plans have already been proposed (Carss 2003, Klenke et al. in press).
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, 80% of the world sea fish stocks are already fully exploited or depleted (FAO 2009). In face of this decline, the importance of aquaculture activities, particularly in those regions where fish are an important human food source, gained relevance both in economic terms and of human well-being (e.g., easier and cheap access to fish products). This importance has been acknowledged through the present EU financial incentives for industrial fish production (INE 1998, DM &amp;amp; IAUS 2004, European Commission 2009). This is the case of the Mediterranean region, where today’s landscape is the result of a long history of human occupation (Blondel 2006). In these southern European areas, fish consumption to meet human needs reaches the highest levels in Europe (Welch et al. 2002) and inland and coastal fish farms are numerous. However, this region is also rich in fish-eating avian (e.g., cormorant, Phalocrocorax carbo, Carss 2003) and mammal predators (e.g., Bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, López, 2006) and therefore farmed fish is highly prone to predation leading to an escalating conflict between fish rearing and conservation interests.
Within the Mediterranean region, Iberia (and Portugal in particular) and the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) an aquatic medium-sized mustelid (order Carnivora), play a model role in conflict assessment between fisheries and fish-eating predators, due to several interacting factors: i) human fish consumption is particularly high - the Portuguese are Europe’s highest consumers of fish and shellfish with an annual per capita consumption of 56.5 Kg (SPOCE 2006, Welch et al. 2002); ii) fish is the main food resource for otters - analyses of otter diet composition in 200 Iberian localities identified fish as the most frequent otter prey (65%), with maximum consumption in rocky coastal areas (Clavero et al. 2008); iii) otters are widespread, fairly abundant and of conservation interest - Portugal is considered to be one of the species strongholds in Europe (Macdonald &amp;amp; Mason 1994, Trindade et al. 1998), occupying all aquatic systems (Santos-Reis et al. 1995) and Spain denotes today a recovery trend after a sharp decline traced back to the mid 1960s (Conroy &amp;amp; Chanin 2002, López-Martín &amp;amp; Jiménez 2008 ); and iv) fish farming is a promising food provisioning ecosystem service in Portugal - in the current scenario of depletion of sea stocks, fish production in brackish and marine waters, where fish
and shellfish production already accounts for more than 88% of overall aquaculture production, is likely to increase (INE 2010).
In this chapter, we address the conflict by reviewing and combining available data on otter predation in freshwater and marine fish farms and discussing the role of environment and management options. We further propose a mandate for the future in what regards research and management actions, aiming to a better understanding of the conflict and conflict solving.
Portuguese fish farming in numbers
Fish farming activities in Portugal can be traced back to the beginning of the 1980’s when most salt ponds were abandoned (the country was one of the most important salt producers up to the 70’s but this activity ceased to be profitable - IPIMAR 1994) and converted to rear fish.
Recognition of sea stocks depletion promoted the development of aquaculture activities and since the 1990's the number of aquaculture farms in Portugal started to increase. More recently, somehow unexpectedly, aquaculture production has not followed the same increasing trend in spite of the country advantageous natural conditions for this activity. An unfavorable economic situation, especially for the marketing of traditionally produced species, together with reduced investment in the diversification of species and products, alongside with the lack of products and production processes certification, contributed to the underdeveloped status quo of the sector (INE 2010). Moreover, the predominance of small business enterprises, with size and management limitations, makes the industry uncompetitive, particularly due to the inability to reduce production costs (INE 2010). One of the major impediments for the growth of aquaculture activities is the fact that high potential areas (e.g., estuaries) are under strong environmental restrictions (http://portal.icnb.pt - Protected Areas National Network).
Fishery products occupy an important place in the European diet, representing a valuable source of protein and contributing to a healthy diet. Although Portugal is one of the most important European fish consumer, its demands are only completely fulfilled by the importation of fish products (FAO 2008). Indeed, Portugal is a small producer, with a production of 7987 metric tons in 2008 (INE 2010). This value is almost residual when compared to Spain, France, Italy, United Kingdom and Greece which in 2007 together accounted for three quarters (75.8% - 990809 metric tons) of total aquaculture production in the EU-27 (Eurostat 2010a, 2010b).
Since 1997, Portuguese fishery catches and aquaculture production registered an increase of 5.6% and 11.2%, respectively, with the highest production period between 2001 and 2003 -more than 8000 metric tons (Figure III.5.1, INE 2010).

However, aquaculture production, as well as profits, suffered a decrease of 3.6% from 2002 (the year with the highest production value) to 2008 (the latest available data) (Figure III.5.2). When compared with the rest of Europe, the importance of aquaculture fishery products in Portugal revealed and inverse pattern, with a decrease of importance of 1% while in Europe it increased 3% since 2002 (INE 2004, 2010 and EUROST 2010a, 2010b).

In 2002, 1438 aquaculture farms were licensed and actively producing in Portugal. Of these aquaculture units, 140 were licensed to produce marine fish species (110 rearing ponds, 10
hatcheries and 20 cages), covering an area of 1113 hectares, and 21 were licensed to produce freshwater fish species (15 rearing raceways, 5 hatcheries and 1 cage), totalizing 15 hectares. The rest of the farms were bottom culture beds in tidal areas, called “viveiros”, mostly producing shellfish (INE 2004). By 2008, the number of licensed farms increased slightly to 1472. Of those, 118 were licensed for marine fish production (91 rearing ponds, 4 hatcheries and 23 cages), representing 1031 hectares, and 11 for fresh water production units (8 rearing raceways, 2 hatcheries and 1 cage), which together occupied 24 hectares (INE 2010) (Figure III.5.3).
Figure III.5.3 - Portuguese aquaculture facilities in 2002 and 2008. Source: INE 2004, 2010
Considering only fish farming facilities, those located in brackish and marine waters account for most of the production, since only 15% and 12% of the total production derived from freshwater fish farms in 2002 and 2008, respectively (Figure III.5.4).
Whether located inland or in coastal waters, production follow three regimes, characterized by a continuous increase of human control over the production: i) extensive low inputs, maximum use of natural processes for food production, low stock density and low harvest per unit of area under culture, ii) semi-intensive - intermediate stock density and access to natural food sources, thus reducing production costs by lowering the need to purchase commercial food, or iii) intensive - higher stock densities, hatchery production of seed where feasible, greater human control of environmental conditions, at least supplementary feeding, and higher yields per unit area (Pillay &amp;amp; Kutty 2005). Freshwater production derive mainly from intensive regimes, while facilities located in marine and brackish waters are predominantly exploited in extensive systems, especially those focused on shellfish production (viveiros). However, fish production
in coastal waters is mostly done on semi-intensive or intensive regimes (INE 2010) (Figure III.5.4).
Figure III.5.4 - Portuguese aquaculture production, represented as percentage of live weight, by environment and regime in 2002 and 2008.Source: INE 2004, 2010
In what concerns species production, the bivalve mollusc Ruditapes decussatus, produced exclusively in coastal extensive regime, represents the majority of aquaculture production and the marine fish gilthead sea bream Sparus aurata and European sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax together account for more than 30% of fish farming production. Freshwater farms produce mainly river trouts, especially the rainbow trout Onchorynchus mykiss. Other species such as soles Solea spp. (&lt;0.2%) are also produced in coastal farms, although their economic importance is negligible by the time being (Figure III.5.5).

Considering only fish, most of the farms’ production in Portugal originates from semi-intensive regime facilities, which account for more than 95% of the total fish production (Figure III.5.6).
Even so, about 30% of gilthead sea bream and European sea bass production derives from intensive systems and the importance of this regime is increasing. Rainbow trout is almost exclusively reared in intensive regimes and the species production has shown a decrease in recent years (Figure III.5.6).

Coastal fish farms in Portugal
In marine and brackish waters, production is divided into semi-intensive polycultures, generally of gilthead sea bream, European sea bass and soles, in earth ponds, and intensive monoculture in concrete ponds or cages either inshore or offshore (e.g., gilthead sea bream). These semi-intensive systems are located in sheltered coastal areas and in estuarine regions. Fish farms distribution along the Portuguese coast is uneven, with the higher proportion of production units located in the Tejo and Sado estuaries (central Portugal), which represented, in 2002, 53% of all marine fish farms in Portugal (INE 2003) (Figure III.5.7). In 2008, the production of the main fish species sea bream and sea bass, whose juveniles are supplied by industrial hatcheries, reached 2704 metric tons (INE 2010), representing a slight increase of 17 metric tons when compared with the 2002 production. Other marine species, such as the common sole (Solea solea} and the Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis} are stocked as wild-caught young fish and generally reared at low densities in a polyculture system (simultaneous production with the sea bream and the sea bass) and have less economic importance - 6 metric tons in 2002 (INE 2004) and 13 metric tons in 2008 (INE 2010).

Inland fish farms in Portugal
Freshwater farm units produce mainly trout in an intensive production system aiming food production and stocking for recreational fisheries. Currently, 98.8% Portuguese trout production is focused on the introduced rainbow trout being the native species brown trout (Salmo trutta) less produced. Trout production in 2002 reached 1233 metric tons (INE 2004), but production decreased towards 2008 - 941 metric tons (INE 2010).
Due to their need for year-round supply of high quality water, trout farms are mostly located in the mountainous areas of the center and north of Portugal, in the vicinity of rivers whose characteristics fulfill the trout bio-ecological requirements regarding low temperature, high flow rates and levels of oxygen and water transparency (Molony 2001). Trout farms are usually composed by raceways and small tanks made of concrete material, supplied with flowing water, derived from the river. Trout juveniles are supplied by industrial hatcheries.
Otters in Portugal
The Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra Linnaeus, 1758) is a medium size carnivore (6 -10 kg), with a fusiform body, a long strong tail, short legs and interdigital membranes, that allow this predator to swim and forage in the water (Nowak 2005). Otters eat mainly fish, although their diet may also include crustaceans, amphibians, birds and small mammals (Clavero et al. 2008). This carnivore is territorial, solitary and nocturnal, and each territory occupies a specific area of a river, a piece of shoreline along the sea coast or the margins of a freshwater lake; a male otter territory will overlap those of a few females, whose territories are often smaller (Kruuk, 2006).
The Eurasian otter distribution originally extended across Europe and Asia, but after the beginning of the 20th century, due to pollution, habitat destruction and human activities, such as traffic, the population declined in most Western Europe (Mason &amp;amp; MacDonald 1986, FosterTurley et al. 1990, MacDonald &amp;amp; Mason 1994, Romanowski et al. 1997, Cortés et al. 1998, Ruiz-Olmo &amp;amp; Delibes 1998, Kranz &amp;amp; Toman 2000, Conroy &amp;amp; Chanin 2002). Otter populations have recently recovered due to the improvement of natural conditions, conservation projects and reintroduction programs (Kranz 1994, Macdonald 1994, Romanowski et al. 1997, Cortés et al. 1998, Ruiz-Olmo &amp;amp; Delibes 1998, Kranz &amp;amp; Toman 2000, Conroy &amp;amp; Chanin 2002). However, given the lack of information from parts of their former range and their recent history of decline, otters are still considered “Near Threatened” (IUCN 2006) and otter capture and habitat destruction is interdicted by the Berna and Washington Conventions and the European Union Habitat Directive (IUCN 2006).
As otters are nocturnal elusive animals, otter scats, identifiable to the trained eye, have been extensively used in ecology studies to access otter distribution, habitat use and diet (Kruuk 2006). The Portuguese Institute for Nature Conservation conducted in 1995 a nation-wide otter survey that demonstrated a broad distribution across the country as otters were found in a wide range of aquatic environments, from very small streams to large rivers, dams and, also, coastal and estuarine environments (Trindade et al. 1998). Consequently, and as populations are considered stable, the national status of the species is of “Least Concern” (Cabral et al. 2005).
Potential for conflict
The potentialities to address the conflict between the use of biological resources (farmed fishes) and conservation of large vertebrates, leaded Portugal to be one of the eight European countries that, during a four-year period, developed a procedural framework for action plans to reconcile such conflicts (FRAP - Framework for Biodiversity Reconciliation Action Plans - EU Contract
EVK2-CT-2002-00142) (see the project’s main outcome - Klenke et al. in press). In Portugal, the conflict analysis was focused, on an early phase of the project, on the inventory and distribution pattern of fish farms, and its relation to otter distribution, aiming to understand the perceived conflict at the national level (Santos-Reis et al. 2007). As a second step, focal study sites were selected, both in inland and coastal areas, to evaluate how otters were using the fish farms. In what regards inland farms, attention was given to river trout predation and the influence of the proximity to a surplus source of trout on the otter diet, in Coa river, central Portugal (Marques et al. 2007). For coastal areas, 14 fisheries in river Sado estuary (SW Portugal) were monitored using an integrated approach that combined ecological data (otter visiting rates to the fish farms, reared fish consumption vs. fish availability) with a socioeconomic evaluation (available policies and instruments; stakeholders discourse analysis), to assess the real and perceived impact (by fish farmers) of otters on fish production. Otter diet results obtained (Freitas et al. 2007) together with an evaluation of the role of key landscape features explaining observed visiting rates of otters and fish loss (Sales-Luís et al. 2009), allowed a deeper understanding of the ecological basis of the conflict that, related with the conflict perception showed by stakeholders (Santos et al. 2006), resulted in the definition of a reconciliation action plan with lessons that can be generalized to similar conflicts (Santos-Reis et al. in press).
Otter Presence in Portuguese fish farms and perceived damage
Nation-Wide Approach - Inquiries
In 1990 the Portuguese Institute for Nature Conservation (ICN) sent a questionnaire to fish farmers regarding the impact of predation on their businesses and consequent financial losses (Trindade 1991). Otters were the most referred predator and some fish farmers perceived the species as a pest and claimed the otter was causing damages all year round. Complaints referred not only to predation but also to the stress imposed upon the fish when the otter entered the ponds, and the losses reported were high. However, producers could not quantify the damages and nearby production farms reported very contrasting damages (Trindade 1991).
Pursuing this same aim, in 2003, we performed phone inquiries at the national level, to both marine and freshwater farms, and visited some fish farms to survey for otter signs and verify the owners’ evaluation of otter presence (Santos-Reis et al. 2007). The inquiries allowed detecting whether fish farms were still operational and to identify those in which otter was present. According to the 2001 statistics (INE 2003), 103 brackish/marine and 20 freshwater (trout farms) fish farms were registered. Of these, 76 (61.7%) fish farm owners were
interviewed covering 57 marine farms and 19 trout farms. Thirty two owners were questioned only by phone, while the remaining 44 farms were visited and surveyed for otter signs. Overall, 36 (47.4%) fish farms were considered negative for otter presence and 30 (39.5%) positive (Table III.5.1). Only eight of the farms classified as having no otters (22.2%), were considered so because the farm was fenced or inaccessible to otters (Santos-Reis et al. 2007).

These results showed that, as expected, otter presence in Portuguese fish farms is quite common and the conflict seems to have an ecological basis for more than half of the investigated fish farms (Santos-Reis et al. 2007). In the freshwater farms producers referred to predation by otters, herons (Egretta garzeta, Ardea cinerea) and, in the small trout (up to 6cm) tanks, smaller birds (e.g., common kingfisher Alcedo atthis}. In the marine fish farms, predation is attributed, particularly in winter, to cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis) and, when fish are small, to terns (Sterna hirundo) but, all year round, to otters and herons.
In general, fish farmers’ perception of otter daily consumption of fish was greatly overestimated, reaching values as high as 10 kg per day, contrasting to the 0.75 to 1 kg/day estimated for Spanish captive individuals (J. Ruiz-Olmo personal communication). When confronted with losses attributed to otters, farm owners stated that they use different legal protection methods such as fencing, electric fencing, and dogs, but also confessed the use of illegal approaches such as traps, shooting or even poisoning (Santos-Reis et al. 2007).
Hence, there was evidence that otters are a potential threat for the fish farming activity (Santos-Reis et al. 2007) as already reported by Trindade (1991) and Trigo (1994). However, the available information was not sufficient to support damages quantification.
On one hand fish farmers have the perception, sometimes overestimated, that there is considerable predation. Inversely, nature conservationists perceive that aggressive unauthorized measures, namely illegal killing, are sometimes taken against these predators. To be able to reduce the conflict, several aspects need to be taken into account to identify the real scope of the damages.
To overcome this gap, in the frame of the FRAP project, focal study sites were selected in fish farming areas, to evaluate otter predation, fish loss and damages. Results on these focal studies are given in the next chapter sections.
Otter predation on fish farms
Freswater Fish Farm - Côa River
The inland focal study was implemented in central east Portugal (40o17’N/6o57’W), near the Spanish border and within the northern range of a protected area (Malcata Nature Reserve). The selected area comprises a permanent river (Côa river) and a trout farm which started producing fish in 1988 (Figure III.5.7). This trout farm (‘Trutalcôa’) has an area of almost one hectare and includes three main production raceways (1m x 7m x 30m each), eight nursing concrete tanks (1m x 2m x 10m each) and a naturalized pond (706.5m2), which contains larger sized trouts and is used for recreational activities. All these structures are linked to each other and to the River Côa by water channels.
During the study period no natural (e.g., vegetation fences) or artificial (e.g. wall, electric fencing) barriers separated the trout farm from the contiguous river.
The farm produces rainbow trout, an exotic species (Cabral et al. 2005) whose individuals can seldom escape to the river, by gaps in the water channels metal fences or in big floods. Fish numbers and density in the raceways vary throughout the year, reaching as much as 150000 individuals (± 238 ind/m3).
To test the importance of the artificial food surplus provided by the non-fenced trout farm to otters, spraints were collected over two years and otter diet assessed on the basis of faecal prey remains (see Marques et al. 2007 for methods details) and live-weight of fish consumed was compared with fish availability in the river assessed by Soares (2000). The spraint analysis revealed that otters subsisted in the region by consuming almost exclusively fish (94% of P.B. or consumed biomass - for definition see Marques et al. 2007), especially the rainbow trout (P.B.=87%), although in summer this consumption was lower and complemented with reptiles and amphibians (Figure III.5.8). In summer, river water warmed up, inducing higher fish mobility (Coutant 1999), with the consequent decrease in the trout capture success rate by otters, which might lead to the consumption of alternative prey.

Figure III.5.8 - Otter diet in Coa river fish farm expressed as percentage of biomass.
The apparent fish specialization by River Côa otters in the vicinity of Trutalcôa was due to trout consumption, which was positively selected (i.e., its consumption was significantly higher than its availability in the river).
The trigger factor that might shade some light into this peculiar result (i.e., high consumption of a species absent from the river) is the presence of the unfenced trout farm. This anthropic environment biased fish availability towards the trout that acted as “fast food” (Marques et al. 2007): highly abundant and easy to get food. Due to the characteristics of the trout farm, and to the fact that only a few escaping individuals may be found on the river (since rainbow trout is not a native species in the studied river, and no direct introduction was ever conducted), we assumed that the great majority of the rainbow trout consumed by otters was predated inside the fish farm pond/raceways.
Instead of revealing a specialized feeding behaviour, the results attest an extreme opportunistic behaviour of this predator as it takes advantage of a local increase of food availability, in particular of prey with a poorly developed anti-predator behaviour, as is characteristic of hatchery reared fish (Eklov &amp;amp; Greenberg 1998, Ferno &amp;amp; Jarvi 1998), living in extreme high densities.
Another data that corroborates the regular use of the trout farm by otters are the collected spraints location. Most of the spraints used to assess otter’s diet were collected within the fish farm, which proves that the pond and raceways are often visited by otters. Moreover, the regular use of the trout farm was confirmed by the fish farm owner observations and by our own video recording data. We set four night vision cameras aiming to confirm the presence of
the otters inside the trout farm and evaluate a minimum number of animals that simultaneously used the farm. These cameras were set in strategic places around the pond margins, all connected to the video recorder. During a two week monitoring period, the trout farm was visited daily by researchers, and we were able to collect about 120 hours of nocturnal recordings. A maximum of four otters were viewed in the same night, probably a female and three almost fully grown cubs. The animals came from the river and dove into the raceways or the pond, probably searching for fish (Figure III. 5.9). These evidences confirm that otters are thus taking profit of a surplus of trophic resources provided by the trout farm.
Figure III.5.9 - Otters movements inside Côa fish farm detected by video recording.
Our study in the Côa river seems to corroborate the hypothesis that relative availability of alternative prey, together with the anti-wildlife protective measures taken by trout farm managers, might determine the frequency at which otters visit fish farms (Ludwig et al. 2002). The fact that the monitored trout farm has no otter-predation preventing measures, may be one of the reasons why the visiting rates of the farm are so high and the consumption of reared fish assumes a predominant role in the otter’s diet. This predation is acknowledged by the owners since they reported seeing the animals hunting inside the farms several times, especially during dawn. However their attitudes towards this predator were not too negative since they consider
that damages due to otters were almost negligible when compared to the lost associated with the variation of environmental factors (e.g., water availability and temperature). Moreover, farmers also pointed out that the otters’ presence might have one positive effect, which was related with the possibility of enhancing the farms eco-tourism associated with the possibility of “otter watching” activities. According to the first phase inquiries described above, this is not the perception shared by most fish farmers and is most probably linked with the exploitation regime imposed by the owner that uses the fish farming area not only to produce trout but also as a recreational area where people can go to angle or have lunch/dinner.
Estuarine Fish Farming Area - Sado Estuary
As mentioned previously the Sado estuary, located in central west Portugal (Figure III.5.7), is an important coastal aquaculture area as this region accounts for a significant number of the marine fish farm units existing in the country and this activity has a significant socio-economic impact at the local level (INE 2002). Fish farm distribution in this area is clustered, a common pattern in estuaries, and farms operate mainly in semi-intensive regime, often recovering old salt production ponds and using the tidal cycles to circulate water. However, they also include pre-timed mechanical feeders and electric devices to keep water oxygen and temperature levels. Four marine species are produced - gilthead sea bream, European sea bass, Senegalese sole and common sole.
Although under urban and industrial influence, the Sado estuary has a strong environmental protection status as a large part of the estuary (230 ha) is classified as a Nature Reserve (Sado Estuary Nature Reserve - 38°27’34.09’’N 8°45’39.44’’W) and is also a special bird protection area (PTZPE0011 - Sado Estuary Special Protection Area - EU Birds Directive) and a Ramsar Site. Moreover, the area is included in the national list of NATURA 2000 sites (PTCON0011 -Sado Estuary Site), partially due to the presence of otters (ICN 2001, http://portal.icnb.pt).
Due to the protection status of the estuary, some constraints on land use and management practices are enforced in order to preserve habitats and species.
Such an area has a strong potential for the occurrence of conflicts between nature conservation and socio-economic development and was therefore chosen as the main study area for FRAP project. Fourteen semi-intensive fish farms were selected (Figure III.5.7) to assess predation in fish farms, by focusing on otter diet and loss of commercial fish (Freitas et al. 2007).
During one year, weekly surveys for otter signs (e.g., spraints and footprints) were conducted along the selected fish farms perimeters. At each visit, all otter spraints were collected and a
minimum sample of 30 was analyzed, per season and fish farm, to assess otter diet and, as in Trutalcoa, to estimate live-weight of fish consumed (for methodological details see Freitas et al. 2007).
Prey diversity and size range in the estuary were assessed using a beam trawl, and abundance data of commercial fish inside ponds was provided by fish farmers. Size range inside ponds was evaluated using a small seine net, called “chinchorro”. This procedure allowed to evaluate whether consumed commercial fish species (gilthead sea bream and sea bass) had similar sizes to those existing in the ponds, in an attempt to understand where predation occurred, i.e. if fish had been consumed inside or outside the fish farms (for details see Freitas et al. 2007).
As expected, fish dominated otter diet (PB=96%); 61% corresponded to species produced in the fish farms and 36% to wild, marine and freshwater, species (Figure III.5.10). The most frequent commercial species preyed upon was the gilthead sea bream, being only surpassed by the soles in terms of biomass (for further details on otter diet see Freitas et al. 2007). A significant spatial variation in otter consumption was also observed. Considering percentage of biomass, most of the fish farms (N=10) had PB values of produced fish above 50%, and only one fish farm was below 20% (for details see Freitas et al. 2007, Santos-Reis et al. in press) (Table III.5.2).

Figure III.5.10 - Otter diet in Sado estuary fish farms expressed as percentage of biomass.
Gilthead sea breams and sea basses were low abundant species in the estuary being therefore assumed that otters were capturing these species inside the fish farms where stocks were high.
Inversely, soles stocks inside fish farms were low and otters were considered to probably be catching soles also from the estuary. The importance of soles in otter diet is also strengthened by the concurrent effects of otter preference for foraging near the bottom and by the demersal behavior of this prey.

The weekly surveys for otter signs (footprints included) further allowed the calculation of otter visiting rates (VR = number of positive visits / total number of visits) and the estimator developed by Gruber et al. (2008) (a maximum likelihood function estimate - VRMLE) was used to maximize weekly information collected, by transforming it into daily visiting rates (for details see Sales-Luís et al. 2009).
Results obtained showed that half of the fish farms were visited by otters in more than 80% of the occasions and weekly visiting rates were, on average, very high (VR=0.76). Estimated daily visiting rates, however, best represented the variability observed among fish farms (VRMLE=0.03-0.68) (for details see Sales-Luís et al. 2009) (Table III.5.2).
In the 2004/05 winter, additional surveys were conducted to evaluate the number of otters visiting each fish farm. For an average of 8 days, less than 18 hours old spraints were collected for molecular analyses to achieve individual identification of the otters by DNA typing. The molecular spraint analysis, using 5 microsatellites and a success rate of 25%, revealed that the
number of otters visiting each of the studied fish farms varied from 1 to 7 individuals (Table III.5.2). Overall a minimum number of 15 individuals were identified in a 100 km2 area, indicating a high density otter population (for details see Sales-Luis et al. 2009).
The yearly impact of otter predation in each Sado estuary fish farm was considered the sum of the losses of each of the reared species (sea bream, sea bass and soles) and damage results were expressed in kilogram of lost produced fish (D_kg) and in economic loss (D_Euros). D_kg was assessed by multiplying: (1) the P.B. of each of the three produced species (sea bream PBSa; sea bass PBDl; and soles PBSsp); (2) the daily food consumption of an adult Iberian otter (0.75kg/day, as obtained for captive individuals - J. Ruiz-Olmo pers. com.); (3) the VRMLE of each fish farm in one year (365 days); and (4) the number of otters visiting the fish farm. The economic loss was calculated by multiplying the D_kg of each fish species by its price on the local market (Table III.5.2) (Sales-Luis et al. 2009).
Otter damage on production (production loss - PL) was assessed per fish farm by comparing the annual overall biomass loss (D_Kg) with the expected production [stocking level reported by fish farmers (gilthead sea bream: 12045-46428 ind./ha; sea bass: 1852 - 19358 ind./ha; soles: 100 -1090 ind./ha) x production area of each fish farm] (Santos-Reis et al. in press).
The production loss per fish farm varied between 0.01 - 0.30% for gilthead sea bream, 0.03 -0.11 % for sea bass, and 1.04 - 28.20% for soles (Table III.5.2). The impact of otter predation on the whole of the fish farming area (347.5ha), taking into account the average stocking level for the produced species, the average daily visiting rates (0.28) and the local otter density (15 ind./100 km2), just represented 0.60% of the overall production (Santos-Reis et al. in press).
Although damage assessment in economic terms should consider the balance between costs and benefits, data considering just fish weight loss suggest that the total damage on commercial fish, considering the overall area, is meaningful, especially because fish farmers expect an overall mortality (predation, diseases, etc.) of up to 10% of stocked fish. At the fish farm level, otter predation varied significantly between fish farms, but it was low in all cases, especially for gilthead sea bream and sea bass. Despite greatest damage being observed in soles stocks, at a first glance, it must be kept in mind that operation costs are low for the fish farmer, since the majority do not buy juvenile soles from hatcheries but capture them opportunistically in the estuary in the course of other fishing operations. However, damage may be considered as locally high due to the high market value of soles.
The role of environment: key landscape features for damages
Damage assessment is a laborious task, depending on difficult-to-obtain ecological data. In the Sado Estuary described approach, the yearly impact of otter predation at the fish farm-level, was assessed by combining the percentage of consumption of reared species with otter numbers, daily food consumption and daily visiting rates, and also stocking densities and production. This elaborate and complete approach proves that good surrogate measures, like consumed biomass (P.B.) or daily visiting rates (VRMLE), are needed so that mitigation or compensation permits could be based on an effective and easily obtained measure of suffered damage or predation risk.
Additionally, the significant variation found in losses at the fish farm-level in a clustered situation, led to the expectation that key landscape features might be used as a management tool in landscape planning to identify and protect high-risk farms. To test this hypothesis, otter visiting rates and otter diet were used as surrogates for damages and an assessment was made to determine key landscape and trophic resource features that might promote damage (Sales-Luís et al. 2009). In the 14 fish farms studied, bank vegetation and structure, hinterland use, alternative prey availability, and existence of preventive measures (e.g., fences, electric fences, dogs) were recorded as descriptive factors for landscape analyses. Several metric variables (distances, habitat areas in buffers) were also assessed using a Geographical Information System (GIS) data base (for details see Sales-Luís et al. 2009).
Correlation analyses were used to test the association between landscape descriptors and potential surrogates for otter damage (visiting rates and P.B. or P.O. - percentage of prey occurrence in diet of stocked species - as defined by Freitas et al. 2007). No clear relation was found between visiting rates (VR, VRMLE) and the consumption of the reared species (neither P.O. nor P.B.) (r&lt;0.25; p&gt;0.37; a=13). This can only be understood if otters are regularly visiting fish farms, not only to predate. Some fish farms might be important territory sites, such as passing ways to other important resource areas (e.g., their home fresh water streams or refuge nearby). This explanation is supported by data, as the visiting rates to a fish farm are negatively influenced by its distance to the nearest streams and positively related to the refuge cover area in a 1 km buffer around the fish farm (for details see Sales-Luís et al. 2009).
Because the percentage of biomass of reared species consumed (PBcsp) best reflected the real damage inflicted by otters, it was used as the surrogate for damage in the multiple linear regression (backwards stepwise) utilised to identify key landscape factors for damage. Nevertheless, the best model only included the positive influence of the distance to the nearest
stream (DNS) and the distance to refuge cover areas (DRCA) [PBcsp = 13.7 DNS + 68.1 DRCA with R2 = 0.84; F(113) = 28.2; a = 0.0001] (for details see Sales-Luis et al. 2009).
Damage is higher in fish farms further away from water lines of some importance (streams and brooks) that usually offer better refuge and alternative prey, especially if the fish farm is close to ditches that may act like “roads” for otters, but which alone have a lower carrying capacity.
This suggests that in fact, different solutions should be recommended for each fish farm and key landscape features can be used as a management and planning tool.
Mangement preventive measures for otter predation: an overview
To avoid otter predation, several preventive methods are available and some already proved to be fairly effective when correctly applied. Their efficiency, acceptability and costs may vary considerably. Frequently, a combination of several strategies has to be used in order to achieve a better result. In addition, many strategies are only useful under certain ecological or legal conditions. The choice depends on several environmental factors which have to be checked and also on what the fish farmer is willing to do. The data here presented was compiled in the frame of FRAP project (Kranz in press) and relates to the most common methods used around Europe, in estuarine fish farms, trout farms and inland Central European carp ponds.
One of the most common preventive methods is pond-fencing (ordinary and electric fencing), using several types and heights of fences, including fishnets.
Normal fences are effective and need less maintenance, but are expensive and may have legal limitations (a permit might be required from the relevant governmental office to build a permanent fence) and/or low acceptance by people since fences may obstruct access and work. Fish farmers usually consider the method to be expensive but prefer installing a fence to having the otters causing damage. Normally ponds are fenced when they are stocked with particularly valuable fish, such as in the case of hatcheries or temporary ponds for manipulating and/or short term stocking for selling.
Mesh size has to be fairly small, less than 10 cm2, to prevent otters from going through the fence. However, otters may still dig under the fence or climb over it. Therefore fences should be at least 1m high and buried 20 cm under the ground. Smaller meshes and burrowing deeper the net increase the costs. The more natural the banks of a pond, the more difficult it is to keep the fence otter prove. The pond inflow, if above ground, is critical as it is difficult to install the fence due to the water current and floating material. The existence of trees and bushes also reduces the efficiency of the fence due to root holes, which otters may profit to enter the pond
area. Considering the cost and efficiency of an otter prove fence, fences are usually only applied to small ponds (up to 1/2 ha). In Portugal, old fishnets are sometimes used as fences and prove to be very effective, but have the side-effect of putting in danger birds which get entangled in the net. Common fencing is the most common method to prevent damages in trout farms as facilities are fairly small and ponds usually artificial.
Electric fences for otters consist of two lines of electric wires, similar to those used for fencing cows or horses, one near the ground and one half meter above ground. In some environmental conditions however, it may be difficult to provide the power and to keep it available. Growing vegetation in contact with the electric lines reduces the conductivity and hence the efficiency. The investment costs are lower than for a normal fence, if power supply is available and no battery or solar panel is needed. However, running costs are higher, since the fence has to be checked frequently and, in addition, maintained, particularly in winter under snow and ice conditions and in summer, where vegetation is quickly growing. Also it cannot stop otters entering through an unprotected water in - or outflow of the pond. Electric fences are not considered to be permanent constructions and therefore in most places no permits are required. In practice, electric fences will also be more efficient in artificial banks and are limited to ponds up to 1 ha. In Portugal this method has been tried in fairly large ponds in estuarine fish farms and, although efficient, was not kept operational due to the absence of maintenance.
Fencing with scaring devices such as human hair or sheep wool in nylon bags, lids and bands of foil on ropes, scarecrows is also a common practice. A rope is stretched 20 cm above the ground around the pond banks to ensure that an otter attempting to enter the pond would encounter the rope. On the rope, the scaring devices are placed at a small distance of 0.5 m. There are generally no limitations for applying such devices, the acceptability is high and costs are very low, but so is the effectiveness of most devices. Although common in Portugal for the protection of other types of production from birds, like crops and gardens, it was not recorded in fish farms. Nevertheless, it is frequently used in central Europe sometimes with rags embed in the scent of other predators but with no proven results.
Other less efficient deterrent methods include sound or visual stimuli and the use of free running guarding dogs or geese.
The first (e.g., recorded alarm or distress calls, gas cannons) are used to discourage predators but its effect is short-term since they become easily familiar with the stimuli and soon after ignore them. In Portugal, professional blast cannons are applied to scare cormorants, but fish farmers believe that they scare also otters. These devices have short term efficiency and are then usually ignored by otters.
The use of free running dogs and geese at the ponds to deter otters require the ponds to be fenced, although not otter prove fenced. This reduces the cost of fences and has also the positive effect of preventing people from entering the farm and steeling fish. Nevertheless, the efficiency of this measure is questionable as pond areas are sometimes large and otters eventually learn to be more discrete and/or approaching the pond when the dogs/geese are sleeping. In Portugal dogs are known to be used (including some farms at Sado estuary) but strangely sometimes the dogs are chained which reduces the method efficiency drastically.
It is assumed that the higher the stocking level of a pond, the more attractive it will be to an otter due to the higher hunting success it provides. This means more predation pressure and higher direct losses, but maybe also higher secondary damages by fish stress or wounds to fish not captured. Any reduction of stocking level may therefore be considered as a straight forward approach to reduce losses. The only serious disadvantage is that this may cause also profit reduction on its own, since the productivity of a pond may not be fully used. The decision of reducing the stocking level may be one of estimating risks. Production areas enclosed in high density otter areas that have restrains or difficulty in applying other preventive measures may consider this a valid strategy. To our knowledge this has not been applied in Portugal.
According to the optimal foraging theory, otters will choose the area where hunting success is highest. Therefore, the option of having alternative food sources besides the stocked fish in ponds with high predation risk may be valuable under certain circumstances. The establishment of deviation ponds requires additional but smaller ponds where the hunting success of otters is increased by stoking it with, generally, coarse fish. This means losing production area, and therefore is a positive measure for reducing fish loss, but also raises fish welfare issues. In addition, deviation ponds may also increase the carrying capacity of the habitat for otters and may lead to an increase of otter numbers in the area and then lose their immediate function. It is therefore essential that they are not stocked permanently, but only if valuable commercial fish has to be protected in a neighbouring pond. Deviation ponds efficiency may be increased by reducing the stocking level in the commercial ponds which would then be a combination of two mitigation strategies. Again, these strategies are dependent of risk estimations and should only be considered in high risk predation areas. To our knowledge this has not been applied in Portugal, although out flow ditches in semi-intensive regimes using the tidal cycles are sometimes stocked precisely with the intent of trying to deviate the predators’ attention.
Small commercial fish species are an easy prey, not only for otters but also for many fish-eating birds. Location of juvenile ponds inside the fish farm is also a factor to take into account, since
it influences the risk of predation. Peripheral ponds are visited more frequently by predators, so keeping juveniles in the interior ponds can contribute to reduce predation.
Conclusion
Otters impact upon farmed fish populations has long been debated but little studied because of the requirements of sound data that are often hard to fill.
Fish produced in farming activities in the beginning of the 21st century already accounted for over one quarter of all fish directly consumed by humans (Naylor et al. 2000), Portugal being no exception (SPOCE 2006, Welch et al. 2002). Additionally this production also represents an ‘add-on’ resource to fish-eating predators such as the otter. Their importance however, as illustrated in the ‘snap-shot’ examples explored above, varies in time and space; in particular locations/situations otters seem to quickly adapt to these new anthropic environments and rely almost exclusively in cultured fish, as shown in the isolated trout farm located nearby the preypoor environment of Côa River. On the other hand, in the clustered coastal fish farms of Sado estuary, evidences further suggest variation in small-scale responses of otters, with individuals either heavily preying fish stocks inside some ponds or using other pond verges as movement routes to wild prey-rich feeding grounds. These findings not surprisingly support former studies that describe the otter as an opportunistic predator (Kruuk 2006) but we further concluded that otters, although important predators for farmed fishes, do not pose an immediate threat to the regional stocks, production standards and economical viability of investigated fish farms.
The key questions that remained unanswered were: i) whether particular environmental features enhance (or diminish) predation pressure; and ii) which management options better minimise predation impact. These are important scientific and policy issues once the common perception is that of a conflicting use of resources by man and wildlife. This conflict derives from the conservation focus of the areas where most production farms were established (most estuarine areas are nature reserves). However, and in spite of restrictions imposed by the areas’ protection status, otters are still persecuted in a society with a growing conservation ethic, and sustainability in these human-dominated landscapes is a challenging prospect.
Environmental Issues
As expected in high-dense regions of fish-eating predators, such as the Mediterranean, visiting rates of otters to fish-farms were quite high. The fact that significant spatial differences were found, both in the consumption of the reared species and in visiting rates itself, suggested that
landscape variables might explain the variations found and these were pinpointed by the modelling procedures: refuge cover areas, alternative prey, streams, ditches and bank structure. Surprisingly, however, visiting rates did not reflect predation upon stocks (Sales-Luís et al. 2009).
A possible explanation to why visiting rates do not correlate with consumption of reared species is that otters may regularly visit fish farms, not to predate, but to scent mark. That is, some fish farms might be important territory sites, but not as feeding areas, and are therefore territorially marked but not heavily predated. This rationalization is supported by the results: fish farms located in areas with high alternative food availability and refuge (typically near streams), even when being highly visited by otters, had a diet less based on produced fish. This contrasting result revealed, and helped to explain, key landscape factors to damages in general (Sales-Luís et al. 2009). Thus, damages are higher in fish farms further away from water lines of some importance (streams and brooks), especially if the fish farm is close to ditches that may act like “roads” for otters, but which alone do not have enough carrying capacity.
Management Issues
The issue of otter predation on fish farms is bipolarizing around two key actor groups: i) fish farmers, who are aware of the existence of otter predation and privately use whatever means they can to keep otters out (including illegal killing), and ii) governmental institutions, that are aware of the predation as well as of the weakness of the monitoring system for the control of illegal actions and impose restrictions to mitigation measures in areas of conservation interest.
The perceived high damages (by the fish farmers) and the prohibition of use of most mitigation measures contribute to enlarge species aversion and may lead to an increase in illegal killing. If fish farming is to continue to rise in importance in the future, as some stakeholders believe, impacts on the socio-economic context might start to gain importance leading to an urgent call for the development of measures to deal with this type of conflicts.
Scientific results proved that the impact of otters is not important at the study area level but may be of significance at the farm level (Freitas et al. 2007, Marques et al. 2007). This suggests that different solutions should be recommended, such as to promote the use of mitigation measures in those farms where damages are high, no matter how they are perceived, and to invest in educational activities on those in which damages are not significant, but may be perceived as such.
Sustainability depends therefore on the ability to find solutions that reconcile economic development with nature conservation. Fish farming, and specifically semi-intensive fish farming, may be reconcilable with conservation if some precautionary management measures are taken. These include the use of key landscape factors to elaborate predation risk maps that will inform fish farmers and administrative bodies of the location of low risk areas during site selection for the installation of new fish farming facilities. Moreover, for each area, it should be possible to identify adequate mitigation measures.
Further Research/Management Needs
Results herein presented are just indicative but we hope that they illustrate the major issues, and provide some insights as to how otters can survive in fish-farming landscapes, without causing too much damage. Problem-solving will require further research and a shared vision between the public and the private sectors in which cautionary principles have to be applied until sufficient information is available. Meanwhile research/management proposals in fish-farming areas should include the following topics, most of it previously summarized in Santos-Reis et al. (in press):
i.	determine space use by otters, either using conventional radio-telemetry techniques or modern molecular tools to elucidate why otters heavily mark some fish pond boundaries if not by feeding purposes;
ii.	promote deeper understanding on farmed fish consumption by otters integrating prey availability, diet and field metabolic rate in bioenergetics models (e.g. Dekar et al. 2010);
iii.	accurately identify otter feeding grounds by using more informative methodologies such as fatty acid (e.g. Iverson et al. 2004) or isotopic signatures (Brischoux et al. 2010) this being particularly important in areas were species being reared can also be found in the wild surroundings of the fish farm. This it is essential for assessing the origin of consumed prey (i.e. captured by the otters inside or outside the farm);
iv.	assess seasonal dynamics of otter population density and structure by increasing the number of molecular markers used and optimising the sampling scheme;
v.	construct maps of otter spatial predation risk, such as illustrated with squirrels and bird nests predation (Wilson et al. 2003) or, more informatively, utilizing hierarchical models of individual movement based on data gathered in i);
vi.	investigate synergistic effects of sympatric fish-eating predators using multi-species approaches in a common time-frame;
vii.	evaluate otter response to mitigation measures using experimental designs;
viii.	assess cost-effectiveness and feasibility of the use of compensation instruments, mainly those directed to compensate for the provision of environmental services.

IV.1. Thresholds of resistance and resilience in a scenario of water shortage
Highlighting the importance of regular otter monitoring and demonstrating that coarse-scale resolution otter surveys are inefficient in detecting otter population declines in the dryer regions of Portugal are major contributions of this dissertation (Theme 1). It was also demonstrated that ‘seasonal’ effects are a key issue when planning monitoring actions to assess species status and trend and to predict long-term species response to changes imposed by intermittent riverine habitats. Additionally, observed changes in otter occupancy between wet and dry periods, reinforces the importance of year round wet habitats (e.g., large streams and river pools) and of its careful management. Applying conservation measures in a time frame when it is still costeffective is crucial and may be more difficult if applied later.
Human activities can result in systems that are resistant and stable over time and space if the disturbance intensity and extent does not exceed system recovery times and spatial extent (Turner et al. 1993). These systems, e.g., the traditional Montado and the low-intensity farming pseudosteppes that are common landscapes in the Sado river basin, demonstrate that ecological sustainability can be achieved, provided those activities do not result in dramatic changes that overpower ecosystem functioning. The observed high diversity within these landscapes can be explained in the context of disturbance theory and is the result of a nonequilibrium state which, if not continuously disturbed, would progress toward a lower-diversity equilibrium community. According to the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis (Connell 1978), species diversity is maximum where environmental disturbance is at an intermediate level of intensity and frequency (relative to the recovery time and areal extent of the system being disturbed). Low species diversity is expected in habitats exposed to high levels of disturbance, where only highly tolerant/rapid colonizing species occur, and under very low levels of disturbance, where dominant species constrain inferior competitors. This means that human induced changes must not go beyond the thresholds of recovery and resilience that characterize arid Mediterranean ecosystems (Blondel 2006). This is particularly true for Iberian riverine systems, due to the conjunction of intermittent regimes and the long lasting human colonization of the area.
Water scarcity has been a vital theme in the history of all Mediterranean peoples (Blondel 2006). Native wildlife have also evolved and/or adapted to limited availability of water, especially those species more dependent on waterscapes. The Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis has also been used to provide an explanation for species diversity patterns in
riverine landscapes (e.g., Ward 1998, Ward &amp;amp; Tockner 2001). Mediterranean native fish species are adapted and thus resistant to the highly variable water flow: present-day droughts have been causing relatively small and transient changes to these stream fish assemblages (Magalhães et al. 2007). Nevertheless, certain consistent trends that show that the earth’s climate is warming have implications for water availability (Hall et al. 2008). Climate change scenarios predict an increased inter-annual variability and a change in total precipitation (Santos et al. 2002, Santos &amp;amp; Miranda 2006, Hall et al. 2008, Kundzewicz et al 2008, Bloschl &amp;amp; Montanari 2010). Depending on location, precipitation is predicted to either increase (e.g., in tropical and high latitude areas) or decrease (e.g., in the Mediterranean basin and western and southwestern USA), and may also fluctuate more through time or occur with more frequent extreme events (Santos et al. 2002, Hall et al. 2008, Kundzewicz et al 2008). This means that when it rains there will be a higher probability of flood events and in the absence of rain drought is likely (Hall et al. 2008). Potential implications for water availability will be very important, with huge impacts on freshwater ecosystems (Santos et al. 2002, Hall et al. 2008, Kundzewicz et al 2008) and stream and ground water temperatures (Bloschl &amp;amp; Montanari
2010). These changes will affect river flow (Hall et al. 2008, Kundzewicz et al. 2008, Bloschl &amp;amp; Montanari 2010) even further in already highly variable water flow areas like the Mediterranean basin.
Cianfrani et al. (2011) assessed climate change threats to the European otter using two climate change scenarios and several forecasting approaches and climate models. They predicted shifts in the species distribution caused by climate change and assessed the efficacy of the current protected areas network for long-term otter conservation. Results for the Mediterranean bioregion suggest that there will be a decrease in otter habitat suitability in the Iberian Peninsula, probably linked to a potential increase in droughts as the climate warms (Cianfrani et al 2011). Also, as shown by Mucci et al. (2010) in a European wide otter molecular study, some local otter populations are genetically differentiated, perhaps as a consequence of postglacial demographic fluctuations and recent isolation. This is the case of Iberian otters that although not separated by any obvious physical or habitat barrier are split into two subpopulations that are divided in north-south clusters in Portugal, with Alentejo, and hence the Sado basin completely included in the south cluster. Despite the species potential for high dispersal and the apparent absense of extrinsic habitat barriers (e.g., topography and watershed structure, regions of unsuitable habitats), intrinsic factors, such as natal philopatry and polygyny can hinder gene flow and dispersal (Mucci et al. 2010). Although the adaptive consequences of otter isolation in different habitats types are, at the moment, unknown, distinct
populations might be better suited to survive in particular habitats (Mucci et al. 2010) and, a better identification of eventual genotype-habitat covariance is needed.
Predicted decreased in river flow due to climate constraints will further be aggravated by growing demands of water, mostly for agriculture (Bloschl &amp;amp; Montanari 2010, Rodríguez-Diáz &amp;amp; Topcu 2010). In Alentejo, the total area under irrigation has been increasing and replacing traditional extensive cereal steppes (Caetano et al. 2009, INE 2011). This is projected to continue as the Alentejo Irrigation Plan forecasts the development of a set of hydraulic works for inter-basin water transfer between Sado and Guadiana rivers (Figure II.2.1), with the Alqueva dam (Guadiana basin) as the main water provider. The final inter-basin diversion will be made to the Alvito dam (Sado basin) and from there the water will be distributed by a channel system that extends west and south to other Sado basin dams (CCDR_Alentejo 2001). These developments are predicted to increase the irrigation area from 40 000ha to 60 000ha. This water diversion was vigorously questioned by the scientific community and NGOs, not only because the ichthyofauna of each of the basins is clearly differentiated, but also because the water quality in Alqueva dam is classified as “Bad” (INAG/MAOT 2004, MAOT/ARH_Alentejo 2011), and will further contaminate the Alvito dam water, compromising its future use.
Increased irrigation imposes significant water demand problems because unlike other water withdrawals that return most of the water to the watershed, water withdrawn for irrigation returns less to the aquifer (Hall et al. 2008). Even so, agricultural intensification will also result in non-negligible risk of simultaneous degradation of surface and ground water reserves due to additional loads of organic matter and nutrients, pollution and eutrophication. Climate change and agricultural changes are therefore expected to put more demand on already limited water resources and that may result in declines or local extinctions of species, including the most sensitive fish species (Magalhães et al. 2007). As a result, in the southern Portuguese river basins, such as Sado Basin, the viable maintenance of many water related species, including the otter, may became particularly challenging (Barbosa et al 2003, Cianfrani et al 2011).
as grid resolution increased. It has become clear that there is no one correct scale resolution or extent (Turner et al. 2001) but clearly it is important to match the scale resolution to the patterns and processes being assessed. Data indicates that, in Alentejo, otters scale to the environment at a finer resolution than can typically be detected using the standard survey scale recommended by the IUCN Otter Specialist Group. It is estimated that the Sado river basin is the Portuguese watershed with fewer mean annual water surface resources per unit area; most tributaries remain dry and/or with pools from two to five months annually (CCDR Alentejo 2001, Moreira et al 2004). Moreover, climate change is predicted to worsen droughts in this basin, so water management is a crucial issue for the entire Sado freshwater ecosystem.
Human actions can positively or negatively influence otter presence and persistence in an area. The influence of human actions in water management (e.g., water abstraction for crops) in smaller streams can drastically alter water lines natural resilience to drought. Otters breed more frequently in complex and stable habitats (Ruiz-Olmo &amp;amp; Jiménez 2009) so, if it is impossible to keep water in the smaller streams, conservation efforts should focus on middle reaches of the watershed (Jiménez &amp;amp; Lacomba 1991) to ensure population viability.
Besides water shortage, otters in the Sado basin are subjected to pollution. Water quality is strongly conditioned by the seasonal nature of its flow (CCDR Alentejo 2001, Moreira et al 2004) but, again, the influence of human actions can severely alter water quality: i) waste water and irrigation runoff (INAG/MAOT 2004) induce blooms of cyanobacteria that may have an extremely negative impact on water quality and the aquatic fauna (CCDR Alentejo 2001); ii) water quality degradation increases vulnerability to other pollution sources, resulting in a higher probability of eutrophication (MAOT/ARH Alentejo 2011) and reduction of overall prey availability.
Although many toxic compounds have been banned (European Council Directive 79/117/EEC; EC Regulation No 850/2004), contamination from heavy metals and other sources of pollution still exist in the Sado (Moreira et al. 2004, MAOT/ARH Alentejo 2011). Henriques (2010) studied the presence of cadmium and mercury in otter spraints in the river Sado basin and reported that cadmium contamination levels seem to follow a spatial pattern while the mercury results indicate a time pattern related to shifts in the diet. Metal accumulation in American crayfish suggests a potential relationship between predator and dominant-prey and so otters may be highly vulnerable to the contamination of this crustacean (Henriques, 2010), a prey of high importance for Iberian otters (Matos 1999, Pedroso &amp;amp; Santos-Reis 2006, Clavero et al. 2008). Bioaccumulation through the aquatic food chain affects otter breeding success and cub survival (Olsson &amp;amp; Sandegren 1991, Roos et al. 2001) and influences otter population
persistence and viability. As seen, water flow and prey availability during the dry season are key factors to otter presence (Paper 1). Otter diet is well known. In contrast, the knowledge on the status of the resources and the effects of drastic diet changes (e.g., the dominance of American crayfish over fish) is limited. This concern is justified by the recent dramatic decrease of the Shetland otter population, one of the strongholds of otters during the population crash of the 1950-80’s. Preliminary estimates of the populations occurring along the entire coastline suggest that less than one-third of the population remains, and with little reproduction (Kruuk 2006). Currently, Shetland otters eat mostly crabs, a prey previously largely avoided. Most likely, there have been significant changes in the fish populations around the islands, largely unrecorded (Kruuk 2006).
The gap in knowledge about effects of significant diet changes and pollution are of major concern and will shape future research, if only because of the importance of resources as determinants of otter numbers. The Water Framework Directive (WFD - Directive 2000/60/EC) is an important step in that direction. The WFD is one of the most ambitious and complete pieces of EU legislation ever. The legal framework involves assessment of chemical pollution of surface waters, groundwater protection, and advice for establishing the ecological status of the aquatic environments. The WFD definition of ecological status is based on the quality of the biological community and takes into account specific aspects such as the abundance of aquatic flora or fish fauna. Quality elements affecting fish and aquatic flora, such as the availability of nutrients, salinity, temperature, and pollution are required to be monitored. Importantly, morphological features like quantity, water flow, water depths, and structure of the river beds are also part of what defines ecological status. The WFD requires Member States to establish or adapt monitoring procedures for gauging the status of waters. Portugal has already started to monitor its ten river basin districts (http://dqa.inag.pt/). Monitoring aquatic pollution is a crucial step in controlling water quality and in the management of aquatic and semi-aquatic wildlife. For the Sado river basin, only approximately 29% of the surface waters are ranked as “Good” and the aim of the Basin Management Plan is to sequentially achieve the status “Good” for most water lines, although 2015 expected results are still not encouraging (MAOT/ARH_Alentejo 2011). To achieve this aim a better oversight of the water withdrawal rules enforcement (including allowed amounts) and a reinforcement of the control actions over discharges, especially from the industry and agricultural sector, is planned.
Portugal is considered to have one of the most viable otter populations in Europe (Foster-Turley et al. 1990, Trindade et al. 1998) suggesting enlarged responsibilities and obligations in the species conservation. The crash of the Shetland population (Kruuk 2006) shows how important it is to regularly monitor otter populations and their prey and to try to forecast possible threats.
Climate change will put additional pressure in an already stressed environment. Having the environmental context, it is now needed to maintain otter surveys and to relate distribution and WFD results.
It is clear that local management decisions that impact otters in the dryer regions of Portugal cannot be based on coarse resolution distribution data (Paper 1). A feasible approach to the otter scale-related monitoring problem is to identify areas where the species is more vulnerable to natural and anthropogenic threats and to survey a subsample of that area at a finer scale resolution during the dry season. In Sado basin that would clearly be the dryer areas of the basin. Monitoring priorities include: i) the headwaters of the streams of the southeastern basin for drought risk, and ii) the Marateca and Xarrama river sub-basins for pollution and human pressure. The 2.5x2.5 km grid seems to be the logical choice for a subsample for effective monitoring of otter populations when information about local population status, in face of existing and future threats, is needed and local management decisions on waterlines and riparian habitats are involved. The finer scale sampling should be coordinated with the OSG nation-wide coarser grid repeated survey (in most countries conducted every 10 years). The investment in combined fine-coarse resolution surveys is justified because of the combination of stress factors that are acting there: increased inter-annual variability and reduction of total precipitation extending the drought period; consequent shifts in prey communities, otter food requirements and pollution load with unknown effects on otter population persistence and viability. A coarse-scale resolution survey may be inefficient in detecting otter population declines early. Clearly, consideration of season is important in rivers with intermittent water regimes. Summer surveys are likely to give a more realistic perspective of otter distribution constrains.
IV.2. Guidelines and recommendations for conflict reconciliation
By readdressing the impact of otter predation on fish farming activities and quantifying damage in a conflict prone zone (Sado estuary) it was shown that although the conflict has an ecological basis, there are large gaps between effective and perceived predation (Theme 2). Furthermore, key landscape features promoting damage were identified and different reconciliation strategies from mitigation, to compensation and educational efforts were recommended as management actions for landscape planning. Nevertheless, further understanding of the changing system is still needed.
The otter is one of the few Eurasian mammalian predators that evolved the ability to actively forage in water. However, this same capacity often brings otters in direct competition with humans, since they eat mainly fish, a resource managed by humans (e.g., aquaculture, angling). For some stakeholders the presence of otters in fish farming areas is an indicator of environmental preservation and a value of biological diversity, but for other it is a pest that should be controlled or even eradicated. Because otters are legally protected by international and national laws, these different viewpoints have led to a long lasting conflict of interests that has resulted in illegal persecution, with undocumented effects to otter populations.
In important fish farming or fishing areas, and especially in Central Europe carp raising pond areas, the species is considered a threat to farming activity. Carp are usually stocked in spring and harvested in autumn. During winter many ponds remain empty, while carp that have not been sold are kept in ponds suitable for over-wintering restricting their activity and congregating at the bottom, scarcely moving (Bauer &amp;amp; Schlout 2004). Wintering ponds represent an essential component of the carp pond culture system (Polednik et al. 2008). Otter damages in winter are considered a major problem by fishermen once they are the combined result of predation and secondary losses caused the otters disturbance of over-wintering carp (Kranz 2000). In the case of otter damages in Upper Lusatia, Germany, the state uses damage compensation schemes as an instrument to reimburse fish farmers for their economic losses (Schwerdtner &amp;amp; Gruber 2007). Similarly, in Austria, government compensation is paid for confirmed otter damage (ex post facto compensation scheme). A highly skilled team establishes the cause and the extent of damage (Bodner 1998). Large amounts of money are claimed as otter damages and there is a considerable amount of information on the subject (Kranz 1994, Bodner 1995a, b, Gossow &amp;amp; Kranz 1998, Kloskowski 2000, 2005, Adamek et al. 2003, Lanszki &amp;amp; Molnar 2003, Leblanc 2003, Jacobsen 2005, Polednik 2005, Polednik et al 2008,
Schwerdtner &amp;amp; Gruber 2007, Klenke et al. in press). Elsewhere in Europe, significant quantities of salmonid fish are reported as taken by otters in Finland (Ludwig et al. 2002), England (Morgan 2003 in Kruuk 2006), France (Leblanc 2003) and Scotland (Kruuk 2006).
In Portugal, as elsewhere, in the 2003 inquiries and visits to both marine and freshwater fish farms (Paper 2) there was evidence that otters are a potential threat for the fish farming activity, as already reported by Trindade (1991) and Trigo (1994). However, the available information was not sufficient to support damage quantification.
The issue of predation in the Sado Estuary fish farms may be responsible for a social conflict notoriously bipolarized around two key groups (Paper 3). On the one hand fish farmers, mostly owners of small or medium-size production facilities, are aware of the existence of otter predation and privately use means, including occasionally illegal killing, to keep otters away. On the other hand, technical staff and managers of the Sado Estuary Nature Reserve, the authority responsible for the management of the protected area, are also aware of the predation as well as of the weakness of the monitoring system for the control of illegal actions, but forbid the use of most measures to prevent predation within the borders of the reserve.
Ecological data suggests that soles are the main prey in terms of biomass for otters in the Sado estuary (Paper 3). However, as these captures do not represent a significant part of the fish farm production and otters catch soles also from the estuary, this loss is not threatening the economic viability of fish farmers. It is nevertheless uncertain whether predation on the other commercially valuable species might threaten economic sustainability.
Scientific results showed that the impact of otters is not important at the study area level but varies from one fish farm to the other and may be of significance at the fish farm level (Paper 4). This suggests that different solutions should be recommended for each fish farm, such as to promote the use of mitigation measures at those farms in which damages are high, and to invest in educational activities on those in which damages are not significant but perceived as such.
Although this may be seen as the more effective approach to reconcile the conflict in the ecological perspective, it may be unacceptable in social terms. Fish farming in the Sado estuary is highly clustered and fish farming owners, although not working cooperatively, do interact with each other and even with additional explanation will not easily accept different individual solutions.
Frist the inexistence of a management plan by local authorities and now the prohibition from using most mitigation measures in the Nature Reserve plan (ICN 2008) have been the main causes of the lack of dialogue among the main stakeholders. The establishement of clear rules
was a very important step to prevent conflict escalation and improve the relation between the interest parties and it opened ground for the development of other short- to long-term approaches for conflict reconciliation. This is especially important considering that the otter conservation status was downgraded at a national level to the category of Least Concern (Cabral et al. 2005) and that, as a consequence of the FRAP project, fish farmers are informed about the potentially high visiting rates of otters to their premisses and of the potentialities for moderate/high levels of consumption of farmed fishes. This knowledge may stimulate persecution by lethal methods, such as traps, shooting, or even poisoning, that, although illegal, never ceased to be used. However, dialogue established in the frame of the project increased receptivness for proposals to mitigate the problem and conciliate their interests with the conservation objectives.
The use of compensation measures such as the ones used in Central Europe would not be feasible in Portugal, due to the species status and the current economic situation, but mostly due to the difficulty in accessing damages in this type of systems. It was recommend that fish farmers be allowed to use electric fences around production ponds, to prevent predation even when real damages are not high, since this will not have a major effect on the fairly well distributed and apparently dense otter population inhabiting the area (Paper 5).
The way forward is to promote best practice guidelines that will raise awareness of the need for biodiversity conservation and prevent operations that would have an adverse impact upon the otter population and other important wildlife values. Fish farming, and specifically semi intensive fish farming, may be reconcilable with conservation if some precautionary management measures are taken in terms of site safeguard and of precautionary development of the farming activities. Moreover, it is recommended evaluating the cost-effectiveness and feasibility of the use of instruments to compensate for the provision of environmental services.
An initiative taken by the nature reserve authority requires the largest fish farms to leave a pond for bird use. This is a compensation measure with clear benefits in terms of bird biodiversity. However, fish farmers must be informed of its usefulness, namely that they may also have something to gain with it (e.g., bird watching may be a complementary income source that could be promoted and organized). Some instruments are only cost-effective in a long-term perspective. Consequently, the time horizon adopted to evaluate the different measures (e.g., electric fencing as a predation deterrent) and instruments (e.g., site-specific predation risk maps) is a key variable in assessing effectiveness.
Fish farmers in the Sado estuary are in a difficult economic situation and their survival depends on the capacity to differentiate their products, gaining competitive advantages in the market. In
this context of economic difficulties, it is more difficult for the fish farmers to understand the need to preserve otters, which they feel as a threat to their economic activity and as causing economic losses. Having this in mind, as well as the need to conciliate this economic activity with conservation, there is a good opportunity for the creation of a scheme aimed at promoting the ecological and economic sustainability of fish farming in the estuary as for example the creation of a “sustainable production” fish labeling scheme. Eco-labelling and certification schemes cover a range of product claims from benefits for fishsafety and quality, to improved legality, transparency and sustainability (OECD 2009). This type of approach has been more commonly used in fisheries but has recently started to be used in aquaculture, mostly by big enterprises. In Spain and Italy certified production of seabream and seabass following the FAO guidelines can already be found (e.g., http://www.friendofthesea.org/certified-products.asp).
Otters, like dolphins, have a popular public image in the Sado estuary. If fish farmers consider otter protection as a setback in fish production and management, the mere aim of protection will be put at risk. Ideally fish farmers should be able to value the existence of the species even if mitigation measures have to be applied to prevent it from causing damages. This can be achieved when certification schemes associated to environmental issues are implemented, as mentioned above, or by increasing the potential for the development of new activities as a result of the presence of a high biodiversity (e.g., nature-based tourism).
IV.3. Future needs of research
IV.3. Future needs of research
Our results represent progress in understanding the patterns of otter distribution and predation and its consequences for the human-wildlife conflict that exists in the Sado estuary. However, for an effective reconciliation of conservation and economic interests, further research is required.
The long-term effects of several potential changes occurring (e.g., decrease in rainfall, longer and hotter summers) on otter population dynamics is still unknown and adptative monitoring is needed. Repeated surveys at a finer scale resolution during the dry season (at least in a subsample) would be important in future monitoring actions, because changing drought regimes, water abstraction and pollution, and prey changes pose a hazardous combination of threats. Also, the previous national otter survey dates from 1995-1998 (Trindade et al. 1998). Since that time, much regional development has occurred and has lead to significant changes in many parts of the country in many cases impacting otter habitats (e.g. dams construction) or the species itself (e.g. increasing road network and.higher number of roadkills). These developments suggest another nationwide survey would be most informative.
Although available data for Portugal suggest that otters are abundant, few attempts have been made to quantify population density, particularly in areas of high seasonality. During the time frame of this thesis a molecular approach allowed the genetic identification of individuals through fresh spraint. Data for the fish farms in Sado estuary (Paper 4) suggest an abundant population. Although the molecular approach was not restricted to the estuary fish farms, the results obtained for other locations along the basin fresh water streams were not as consistent and the proportion of spraints yielding preserved DNA was lower, requiring still a more focused effort in field sampling and DNA typing. Reliable data on otter density in the Sado basin is therefore still an important missing element as are the sizes of territories. Although assessing density of otters is a difficult task, and territory sizes tend to fluctuate, some assessment of these natural history parameters is most helpful. To assess these types of data it is required to select a sub-basin extent for intensive sampling and cover a significant part of it in consecutive days to collect fresh spraints for DNA analyses. This represents a large effort both in field and in the laboratory work but essential for the fuller understanding of the population viability challenges.
IV.3. Future needs of research
It is also important to understand to what degree fish farming activities in the estuary are attracting otters and contributing to an increase in their carrying capacity in the Sado estuary. These concerns suggest an urgent need to evaluate the spacing patterns of otters.This could be achieved by using molecular tools over a large extent area centered in the farming area or by using radio-tracking techniques preferably with GPS-capable transmitters.
In addition to otters, several fish-eating birds are attracted to fish farms and also cause damage to fish production. To fully quantify the impact of predation on fish losses, including the share of otter predation, a multi-species assessment is a priority. The physical relation between fish farming ponds and the estuarine environment and the fact that the species stocked in the ponds were also present in the estuary were major constraints in the otter damage assessment in this study. Accurately identifying otter feeding grounds by using fatty acid or isotopic signatures is essential for assessing the origin of consumed prey.The finding that otters regularly visit fish farms and that they apparently are not going there just for feeding purposes (visiting rates do not correlate with diet results - Paper 3) is a puzzling result of the study. A combination of radio-tracking and video surveillance techniques could be a useful tool to study otter behavior inside fish farms and indirect damage, such as fish disturbance. More research is also needed to improve the exclusion of predators by non-lethal methods and this can be achieved by evaluating otter response to mitigation measures using experimental designs (e.g., of electric fences).
The elaboration of a predation risk map of Sado estuary, preferably involving not only the otter but other predators as well, would be informative to fish farmers and the nature reserve administration, helping to decide about the adequate mitigation measures or compensation schemes, mainly those directed to compensate for the provision of environmental services, or to give guidelines during site selection for the installation of new fish farming facilities.
IV.3. Future needs of research
Recent work developed by Oliveira and collaborators (2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011) with data from Sado basin has shown high levels of resistance in bacterial isolates from fecal microbiota (e.g., salmonella, aeromonas) of free-living otters. Environmental contaminantion and the role of free-ranging wildlife animals as potential vectors of pathogenic bacteria and antimicrobial resistance determinants to the environment is an important emerging aspect related to otter conservation. Of particular concern were the isolates with a multiresistant profile, indicating resistance to more than one antimicrobial class. These results suggest that antimicrobial resistant bacterial strains may also be selected by environmental exposure to antimicrobial agents, since the samples may derive from otters that were probably exposed to antimicrobial drugs existent in their aquatic habitats previously contaminated by animal and human wastes (Cole et al. 2005, Sayah et al. 2005, Salyers &amp;amp; Shoemaker 2006, Skurnik et al. 2006), rendering them new reservoirs for resistant bacteria. Also, although bacterial diseases have been detected in otters (e.g., Hoover &amp;amp; Tyler 1986, Nikolova et al. 2001), little is also known about the clinical significance of otter bacterial diseases and their impact in the overall otter populations.
Overall, the near future of otters in Sado Basin seems safe from major disrupting events. However, effective monitoring should continue while the species is viable and widely distributed in order to detect any trend of decreasing population. Population decline can be a fast event, contrasting with recovery, which may be a slow and not always successful process.
