ABSTRACT 
 
The use of ethyl-cyanoacrylate and octyl-cyanoacrylate were clinically and histopathologically compared 
on the corneas of 36 rabbits after lamellar keratectomy (standardized diameter and depth). The animals 
were distributed into two groups, one for each type of adhesive. From each group, six subgroups were 
histopathologically evaluated on the 3rd, 7th, 14th, 21st, 30th, and 60th day post-operative. General (daily) 
and ophthalmic (days 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, 30, 44, and 60) evaluations clinically indicated that there were 
significant differences for the variables water intake, attitude, blepharitis, corneal edema, and fluorescein 
test. The adhesive permanence time for octyl-cyanoacrylate (17.22 days) was greater than that for ethyl-
cyanoacrylate (7.66 days). With respect to the histopathological evaluation, corneal epithelization and 
collagen organization occurred without severe complications. However, treatment with ethyl-
cyanoacrylate led to a moderate inflammatory reaction in the initial phases. With octyl-cyanoacrylate, re-
epithelization and collagen organization proceeded more slowly with a discrete inflammatory reaction in 
the initial phases. From clinical and histopathologic points of view, octyl-cyanoacrylate showed 
advantages over ethyl-cyanoacrylate, whereas wound healing was achieved in both groups without major 
complications.

RESUMO 
 
Comparou-se o uso do etil-cianoacrilato e do octil-cianoacrilato em córneas de 36 coelhos após 
ceratectomia lamelar (diâmetro e profundidade padronizados). Os animais foram distribuídos em dois 
grupos, segundo o tipo de adesivo, e redistribuídos em seis subgrupos com três animais cada, para as 
avaliações histológicas aos 3, 7, 14, 21, 30 e 60 dias de pós-operatório. As avaliações clínicas gerais 
(diárias) e as oftálmicas (dias 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, 30, 44 e 60), indicaram diferença entre os dois grupos, 
quanto ao consumo de água, atitude, blefarite, edema da córnea e teste da fluoresceína. O Tempo de 
permanência, sobre o leito corneal, do adesivo octil-cianoacrilato (17,22 dias), foi maior que o do etil-
cianoacrulato (7,66 dias). A histopatologia, para ambos os grupos, mostrou que a re-epitelização e a 
organização do colágeno ocorreram sem graves intercorrências. O grupo tratado com o etil-
cianoacrilato apresentou, nas fases iniciais, reação inflamatória mais evidente que o tratado com octil-
cianoacrilato. Neste, a re-epitelização e a organização do colágeno ocorreram mais lentamente e com 
reação inflamatória discreta. Sob os pontos de vista clínico e de avaliação histológica simples, os 
resultados mostraram vantagens do octil-cianoacrilato, entretanto, a cicatrização da córnea ocorreu em 
ambos os grupos.

INTRODUCTION 
 
The cornea, because of its functions, is one of the 
group of structures most studied with regard to 
the vision apparatus (Samuelson, 1999). Deep 
ulcerations and traumatic perforations are among 
the illnesses of greatest morbidity that affects it.  
 
Because of the need for sophisticated equipment, 
highly capable professionals, and training in 
micro-surgery, the use of classical techniques in 
keratoplasty is limited to specialized centers. 
Therefore, the study and development of new 
procedures that are simple, effective, and easy to 
perform are daily challenges.  
 
Adhesive tissues, tested since the 1960s, are 
defined as polymerizeable substances with the 
capacity to keep tissues together or to cause a 
barrier against extravasation. These are materials 
that have undergone development and currently 
offer biocompatibility and efficacy (Reece et al., 
2001). Such desirable characteristics are notably: 
provide local action for the period necessary for 
their effective function; degrade without the 
production of fragments; adhere to surfaces at 
body temperature; create a strong, flexible bridge 
between tissues; tolerate moisture; and have the 
capacity to spread out (Donkerwolke et al., 1998; 
Reece et al., 2001).  
 
Cyanoacrylates belong to a group of materials 
derived from cyanoacrylic acid. Their liquid 
monomers solidify by polymerization after 
contact with a weak base released by a little heat 
(Watte et al., 2004). It is known that the 
biocompatibility of cyanoacrylates is strongly 
related to the number of carbons present in its 
side chain, and that the longer it is, the less tissue 
reaction will be expected (Woodward et al., 
1965; Pani et al., 1968; Dellevigne et al., 1971; 
Vote and Elder, 2000).  
 
Greater tissue reaction after subcutaneous 
implantation of short-chain cyanoacrylates was 
due to the release of toxic substances resulting 
from their degradation, notably cyanoacetate and 
formaldehyde. Difference related to tissue 
vascularization, variable among tissues, also 
equally contributes to the occurrence of such 
events (Trott, 1997). 
 
Infiltration of eosinophils and neutrophils after 
the application of cyanoacrylates has been 

reported in different tissues like muscle 
(Woodward et al., 1965), subcutaneous (Pani, et 
al., 1968), and equine intestine (Duarte et al., 
2007). The occurrence of severe infiltrate 
inflammation was also reported by Laus et al. 
(1993) when using a gel adhesive in healthy 
corneas of dogs.  
 
In human ophthalmology, there are reports 
describing the application of cyanoacrylates in 
practice, with satisfactory results (Boruchoff et 
al., 1969; Hirst et al., 1982; Taravella and Chang, 
2001; Setlik et al., 2005). However, in veterinary 
ophthalmology, the lack of technical knowledge 
of these products, the little experience with 
regard to their manipulation, and the costs 
involved have limited their utilization.  
 
The aim of this study was to compare the clinical 
and histopathological results between ethyl-
cyanoacrylate and octyl-cyanoacrylate when 
applied in lamellar keratectomy in rabbits. 
 

MATERIAL AND METHODS 
 
Thirty-six adult male New Zealand rabbits were 
used. They were 120-day-old and averaged 3kg 
b.w. The study rigorously followed the bioethical 
guidelines of the Association for Research in 
Vision and Ophthalmology. After a clinical and 
ophthalmic examination based on Shirmer’s 
lacrimal test,1 slit-lamp biomicroscopy2, and the 
fluorescein test3, the animals were kept in 
individual cages, in a ventilated environment that 
was clean and dry, where they were fed on 
commercial ration4 and water ad libitum.  
 
The adhesives were evaluated in the right eye of 
the animals, separated into the ethyl-
cyanoacrylate5 and octyl-cyanoacrylate6 groups. 
The rabbits from both groups were evenly 
matched and randomly distributed into six 
subgroups of three animals, for different 
intervals for evaluation of the corneas, after the 
application of the adhesives.

Anesthesia was induced with the use of a 
combination of ketamine7 and midazolam8, at a 
dose of 40 and 0.2mg/kg, respectively, 
intramuscularly administered. It was maintained 
by inhalational halothane9, supplied with face 
mask, in a semi-closed circuit. Immediately 
before lamellar keratectomy, two drops of 
tetracaine anesthetic with 0.1% phenylephrine 
were instilled10.  
 
The surgical procedures were carried out using a 
surgical microscope11, at 10 times magnification. 
After routine antiseptic measures, protection of 
the operating field, blepharostasis, and fixation 
of the eyeball; a lamellar button was created by 
3mm in diameter trepanning12, composed of 
epithelium and about half the thickness of the 
stroma in the central region of the cornea. It was 
excised with an angled scalpel13 and in its place, 
one of the two adhesives was deposited using a 
syringe14 with a hypodermic needle15. The area 
was then covered with a 3mm diameter cellulose 
sterile film16, for the purpose of creating a 
smooth surface over the lesion. 
 
In the postoperative period, 0.3% tobramycin17 
was instilled every 6h for 10 days and systemic 
analgesia was subcutaneously administered with 
buprenorphine18, at a dose of 0.02mg/kg, at 
intervals of 12 hours, for five consecutive days. 
The animals were fitted with an Elisabethan 
collar. 
 
In the postoperative period, ophthalmic 
evaluations were performed on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 
10, 14, 21, 30, 45, and 60, at night, and consisted 
of Shirmer’s lacrimal test, determination of the 
degree of blepharospasm, ocular discharge, 
conjunctival hyperemia and chemosis, and 
fluorescein test. Parameters related to corneal 
conditions (edema, vascularization, and

pigmentation) and to the anterior uvea were 
evaluated. In addition, in the first 10 days of the 
postoperative period, on a daily basis and in the 
morning, the animals were observed for 
behavior, and food and water consumption. 
Retention of the adhesives on the cornea was 
daily evaluated in the morning. Scores were used 
for data compilation and statistical study with 
regard to each evaluated event (Table 1). 
 
At the end of the each histopathological study 
period, the animals were sacrificed with letal 
dose of barbiturate19 (100mg/kg) intravenously 
applied. Subconjunctival enucleation was 
performed and the eyes were kept in modified 
Karnovsky fixative for histological examination. 
The used stains were hematoxylin-eosin and 
Masson’s trichrome. The preparations were 
analyzed and the most important events 
documented by photomicroscopy20. 
 
The experimental design was based on the 
factorial arrangement of two treatments x six 
periods with three repetitions (36 animals). The 
data for the different studied parameters were 
examined by analysis of variance and the means 
were compared by a t-test, at 5% level of 
significance, utilizing generalized linear models 
and chi-squared test on Statistical Analysis 
System.  
 

RESULTS 
 
Table 2 presents the means determined for the 
variables behavior, and food and water 
consumption for the two treatments. Animals 
that received octyl-cyanoacrylate were more alert 
and consumed more water (P&lt;0.05). 
 
The lacrimal production showed a mean baseline 
level (day 0) of 6.2±0.6mm/min. There was no 
significant difference between the treatments. 
Ethyl-cyanoacrylate showed a mean of 
8.55mm/min and octyl-cyanoacrylate a mean of 
9.04mm/min, but these values did significantly 
differ from the baseline value.

In the postoperative period, no significant 
differences were found between the two 
treatments with regard to extent of 
blepharospasm, ocular discharge, conjunctival 
hyperemia, and chemosis. About the clinical 
postoperative evaluation, there was a significant 
increase on the first day for all the variables, with 
a tendency for their normalization in the course 
of the postoperative period and return to baseline 
values by day 45. Ocular discharge, 
predominantly of the mucoid and/or seromucoid 
type, was observed in all the animals, with the 
greatest intensity on days one and three 
postoperative.  
 
Corneal edema was peri-lesional and discrete. 
This was seen on the first day postoperative in 
61% of the rabbits that received ethyl-
cyanoacrylate. At three days, 11% of the animals 
of this group still manifested edema.  In those 
that received octyl-cyanoacrylate, corneal edema 
was found in only 16% of the animals in the first 
day postoperative. At the fifth day postoperative, 
no more edema was observed in animal from 
both groups. 
 
Uveitis occurred in animals from both groups 
and it was considered discrete when there was 
observed just iris hyperemia. When this signal 

was accomplished with edema and miosis, the 
uveitis was considered moderate. There was no 
significant difference in mean frequency of 
anterior uveitis between treatments with octyl-
cyanoacrylate (m = 0.75) and ethyl-
cyanoacrylate (m = 0.76). 
 
The fluorescein test was positive in 61% of the 
animals of the ethyl-cyanoacrylate group on day 
one, 3% on day three, 2% on days five and 
seven, and 11% on day 10. With regard to octyl-
cyanoacrylate, 33% of the animals showed a 
positive result on the first day postoperative and 
5% on the second. There was a significant 
difference in the mean frequency of positive 
fluorescein test between the octyl-cyanoacrylate 
(m = 0.72) and ethyl-cyanoacrylate groups (m = 
0.79) (P&lt;0.05).  
 
The estimated means (for all the periods) for 
retention time of the adhesive on the cornea were 
17.22 days for the octyl-cyanoacrylate group and 
7.66 days for the ethyl-cyanoacrylate group. 
There was a significant difference between the 
two treatments (P&lt;0.05). The observed means 
(simple means for each time. each period) are 
presented in Table 3.

Means followed by the same letter did not differ at the 5% level of significance by the t-test.  
 
In corneas evaluated at three days postoperative, 
the treatment with ethyl-cyanoacrylate showed a 
fracture of the adhesive corresponding to a third 
of the corneal thickness, which was filled with 
fragmented be-refringent material, covered by an 
acellular layer on which there was a neutrophilic 
exudate; the corneal stroma on the adhesive was 
shown to be edemous (Fig. 1). Treatment with 
octyl-cyanoacrylate showed a fractured space, 
which was filled by adhesive, appeared 
transparent, with protuberances and recesses at 
the stromal edges, suggesting possible 
penetration of the biomaterial. Scarce exudate 
rested on an acellular layer that covered the 
biomaterial. A reduced area of stromal edema 
was demonstrated on the adhesive (Fig. 2). 
 
At seve days postoperative, animals from both 
groups exhibited hyperplasia and hypertrophy of 
the germinative cells of the epithelium on the 
edges of the lesion, which had migrated over the 
lesioned stroma. In the animals from ethyl-
cyanoacrylate group, there was a mixed 
inflammatory infiltrate represented by 
polymorphonuclear (neutrophils) and phagocytic 
mononuclear cells. At 14 days postoperative, the 
corneas of the animals from ethyl-cyanoacrylate 
group showed complete re-epithelization, while 
the stroma, still disorganized, was permeated by 
various keratocytes and the neo-epithelium still 
displayed cellular hyperplasia (Fig. 3). 

Attenuation of hyperplasia and organization of 
collagen fibers were gradually seen in 
subsequent evaluations (21 and 30 days 
postoperative). In the animals from octyl-
cyanoacrylate group, at 14, 21, and 30 days, 
there was a slow migration of hyperplastic 
epithelial cells and moderate number of 
inflammatory cells (neutrophils), intact and in a 
state of degeneration, on the detached portions of 
the adhesive. The stroma, despite remaining 
relatively organized, showed a discrete 
concentration of keratocytes in the portions 
immediately subjacent to the adhesive (Fig. 4). 
By the 60th day postoperative, the animals from 
both groups showed complete re-epithelization 
and organized stroma (Fig. 5).  
 

DISCUSSION 
 
The evaluations relative to food and water 
consumption and behavior were devised for the 
purpose of identifying some indication of ocular 
pain, since the cornea has nociceptive 
innervation on its surface. According to Johnston 
(2005), the ingestion of food and water, and 
consequently body weight, tend to decrease 
notably in cases of pain. Regarding water 
consumption and behavior, it can suggest that 
octyl-cyanoacrylate induced less discomfort.

The mean baseline value for the Shirmer lacrimal 
test was 6.20.6 mm/min. The result is similar to 
that reported by Abrams et al. (1990), who 
evaluated 142 healthy rabbits and obtained a 
mean of 5.32.96. The increase observed in both 
treatments which did not significantly differ, is 
believed to be due to conjunctival and corneal 
irritation after the surgery procedure.  
 
About blepharospasm, ocular discharge, 
hyperemia, and chemosis, the findings were 
similar to those of Ollivier et al. (2001), who 
tested butyl-cyanoacrylate in rabbit corneas and 
showed a significant increase on the first day 
postoperative, with gradual decline to levels not 
significantly different than baseline levels. 
According to these authors, the tendency toward 

normalization is due to the fact that the surface 
over the adhesive becomes less irregular with 
time, causing less discomfort. Using butyl-
cyanoacrylate in dogs, Bromberg (2002) and 
Watte et al. (2004) observed discrete 
blepharospasm which disappeared over a course 
of two to three days. In human patients, 
protection with a contact lens reduced the 
occurrence of such symptoms (Taravella and 
Chang, 2001; Feldberg et al., 2003; Setlik, 2005). 
 
Peri-lesional corneal edema was observed on the 
first day postoperative in 61% of the animals 
treated with ethyl-cyanoacrylate and in 10% of 
those who received octyl-cyanoacrylate. These 
observations suggest that octyl-cyanoacrylate 
produced a better impermeabilization of the

cornea in the lesioned areas.  Mota et al. (2004) 
showed less occurrence of edema in lesions 
treated with butyl-cyanoacrylate compared to the 
sutured cornea. According to the authors, the 
adhesive provided better apposition between the 
edges of the lesion, impermeabilizing it and 
aiding in stromal re-organization.  
 
Feldberg et al. (2003) studied ethyl-
cyanoacrylate in 22 human patients, to whom a 
second application was needed in 50% of the 
cases. This group found a significant difference 
between treatments in the fluorescein test. Such a 
finding, together with corneal edema, indicated 
that octyl-cyanoacrylate provided better 
plasticity and adherence to the tissue receptor. 
 
The uveitis identified in both groups, did not 
show significant differences and was a reflex 
response to corneal irritation. Gasset et al. (1970) 
demonstrated minor iritis after intracorneal 
application of butyl-cyanoacrylate in rabbits.  In 
humans, the utilization of therapeutic contact 
lenses in the postoperative period has been 
shown to minimize mechanical irritation and 
consequently reflex uveitis. 
 
With respect to the mechanical function of 
adhesives as a temporary tectonic procedure, 
there was a difference between the estimated 
mean (which involved all the periods) and the 
observed mean (simple mean for each individual 
period). For the treatment with ethyl-
cyanoacrylate, the estimated mean retention time 
was 7.66 days. When considering only the period 
of 60 days, the mean was 11.6 days. This finding 
is in contrast to that of Feldberg al. (2003), who 
found a variation of three days to five months in 
humans. The difference among species, size and 
depth of the lesions, as well as the utilization of 
therapeutic contact lenses which limit friction by 
the eyelids on the adhesive could have accounted 
for the differences.  With regard to octyl-
cyanoacrylate, the estimated mean was 17.22 
days and that observed at 60 days was 32 days. 
Bromberg (2002) reported a mean of 247 days in 
a study on the use of butyl-cyanoacrylate in the 
treatment of refractory ulcers in dogs. Watte et 
al. (2004), in conditions of clinical application in 
dogs, found values varying form one week to six 
months. Mota et al. (2004) reported no 
detachment of butyl-cyanoacrylate for up to 30 
days of observation in rabbits. 
 

To make use of a corneal adhesive, it is 
necessary that it remain until tissue repair is 
complete. The fact that octyl-cyanoacrylate 
remains on the corneal surface 2.5 times longer 
than ethyl-cyanoacrylate, together with the 
significant difference in fluorescein test, 
demonstrates the advantages of the octyl-
cyanoacrylate. 
With regard to histopathology, the presence of a 
considerable amount of exudate, predominantly 
neutrophilic, on the acellular film on the third 
day postoperative in the animals treated with 
ethyl-cyanoacrylate, resulted in an acute 
inflammatory response of the conjunctiva, as a 
reflex of corneal irritation. In the group that 
received octyl-cyanoacrylate, a very slightly 
amount of neutrophilic exudate was found. 
Inflammatory infiltrate is a common report when 
cyanoacrylates (Woodward et al., 1965; Pani, et 
al., 1968; Duarte et al., 2007) or other types of 
adhesives were used in tissues (Laus et al., 
1993).  
 
Differences were found with respect to the 
appearance and bi-refringence of the adhesives 
by light microscopy. Ethyl-cyanoacrylate 
showed little advantage due to elevated bi-
refringence and blotchy appearance. According 
to Reece et al. (2001), the adhesive should 
degrade without leaving fragments. Octyl-
cyanoacrylate expressed minimal bi-refringence 
and showed no fragments. It was found to be 
interwoven with and fixed to the corneal stroma, 
with protuberance and recesses. Donkerwolke et 
al. (1998) reported the importance of a strong 
and flexible bridge to allow tissue migration.  
 
Hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the epithelial 
cell layers, in migration, separated the adhesive 
from the corneal stroma in both treatments by the 
seventh day postoperative. Similar results were 
described in rabbits by Gasset et al. (1970) and 
Mota et al. (2004), after the corneal application 
of cyanoacrylates. For the same period, 
inflammatory infiltrate containing neutrophils 
and some macrophages in the subjacent stromal 
portion was found in the animals that received 
ethyl-cyanoacrylate.  
 
Two weeks after the application of the adhesives, 
hypertrophy and cellular hyperplasia were 
present in animals from both groups. In the 
treatment with ethyl-cyanoacrylate, re-
epithelization of the lesion was evident. The

subjacent stroma showed intense fibroplasia and 
substantial disorganization. In animals from 
octyl-cyanoacrylate group, hyperplasia and 
hypertrophy were observed with epithelial 
migration of considerably less intensity. There 
was organization of the stromal collagen fibers 
which were found to be permeated by new 
keratocytes. These findings are similar to those 
reported by Vote and Elder (2000) describing the 
slow degradation of octyl-cyanoacrylate.  
 
Histopathological changes at 21 and 30 days 
postoperative for ethyl-cyanoacrylate included 
stromal organization with a gradual decrease in 
intensity of epithelial hyperplasia and 
hypertrophy, and keratocytes infiltrating the 
stroma undergoing repair. In the group of  
animals that received octyl-cyanoacrylate, at 21 
and 30 days postoperative, the observation of 
inflammatory cells, intact and undergoing 
degeneration at the interface between adhesive 
and tissue, already noted, and of the re-structured 
epithelium, emphasizes the necessity of 
monitoring individuals who are treated with slow 
degrading cyanoacrylates, in light of the 
possibility of development of infections. Such 
reservations were also noted by Gasset et al. 
(1970), Vote and Elder (2000), and Bromberg 
(2002).  
 
At 60 days postoperative, corneal re-structuring 
was seen in both groups, without differences 
with respect to cellular pattern. Gasset et al. 
(1970) and Ollivier et al. (2001) reported similar 
findings in experimental studies of 
cyanoacrylates. 
 

CONCLUSION 
 
It is concluded that octyl-cyanoacrylate is more 
advantageous than ethyl-cyanoacrylate in the 
repair of lesioned corneas, whereas both 
adhesives showed final satisfactory results when 
performed with the objective of an emergency 
tectonic coverage for this clinical situation.
