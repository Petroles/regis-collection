RESUMO

Cabeçote de Motor. 2011. 201p. Tese (Doutorado) – Escola de Engenharia de São Carlos,

Para caracterizar componentes usados em aplicações de alta responsabilidade não basta 

apenas conhecer a composição química e os resultados de ensaios de tração, impacto e dureza, 

pois estes podem não fornecer os subsídios necessários que permitam prever, de maneira 

confiável, o comportamento dos componentes nas condições reais de trabalho. Exemplo disto 

são os cabeçotes de motor automotivos, submetidos a tensões térmicas e mecânicas 

relativamente altas durante seu uso normal e altíssimo em condições extremas. Durante longos 

tempos de funcionamento e eventuais falhas na refrigeração e ou lubrificação a temperatura 

pode chegar a valores próximos de 300ºC. Esta variação de temperaturas provoca choques 

térmicos que podem gerar trincas e/ou uma grande quantidade de deformação plástica em 

regiões próximas aos pistões. Desconsiderando a presença de choques térmicos provocados 

por falhas, ainda assim, uma pequena quantidade de ciclos de acionamento e parada do motor, 

é considerada como os principais causadores de pequenas trincas. Isso indica que o 

surgimento de trincas em cabeçotes de motor deve ser considerado um problema de fadiga 

termomecânica de baixo ciclo. Outro problema é a heterogeneidade microestrutural no 

componente devido ao processo de fundição, levando a propriedades mecânicas e físicas 

diferentes em uma mesma peça. Além da presença de porosidade gerada por bolhas de gás e 

vazios de solidificação, que podem adquirir tamanho tal que se aproximem de pequenas 

trincas, diminuindo a vida para a nucleação e assim mudando o foco do problema para o de 

propagação de trinca por fadiga. A proposta deste trabalho foi a de determinar as propriedades 

de fadiga isotérmica e termomecânica através de ensaios de fadiga de baixo ciclo, bem como 

as propriedades de propagação de trinca por fadiga, relaxação, caracterização microestrutural 

e modelagem do comportamento mecânico por elementos finitos para a liga de alumínio 

utilizada na fabricação de cabeçotes de motores automotivos pela indústria nacional. Todos os 

ensaios e análises computacionais foram realizados nos laboratórios da Universidade de São 

Paulo (EESC-USP) e da École Normale Supérieure de Cachan (ENS-LMT). Os ensaios de 

fadiga isotérmica foram realizados nas temperaturas de 120ºC e 280ºC e os ensaios 

termomecânicos foram realizados em fase entre as temperaturas de 120ºC e 280ºC. Os ensaios 

de relaxação foram realizados em várias temperaturas com carregamento de onda trapezoidal, 

enquanto que os ensaios de propagação de trinca por fadiga foram realizados nas temperaturas 

de 120ºC, 200ºC e 280ºC para carregamentos de onda senoidal e trapezoidal em controle de 

carga e de deslocamento. Foi feita também análise microestrutural nos corpos de prova, após 

os ensaios de fadiga, por microscopia óptica e por microscopia eletrônica de varredura MEV. 

Os resultados destes ensaios mostraram que os defeitos de fundição e a falta de 

homogeneidade no material, aliados a longos tempos de exposição a carregamentos e em altas 

temperaturas, constituem um fator crítico no desempenho do componente. Estes resultados 

ajudarão a estabelecer modelos precisos de previsão de vida para os cabeçotes de motor.

ABSTRACT 

 

ANGELONI, M. Fatigue Life Evaluation of A356 Aluminum Alloy used for Engine 

Cylinder Head. 2011. 201p. Tese (Doutorado) – Escola de Engenharia de São Carlos,

Paulo, São Carlos, 2011. 

 

In order to characterize mechanical components used in high responsibility applications, the 

knowledge of chemical composition and results from regular experiments such as traction, 

impact and hardness tests is important, but not sufficient. They cannot supply the necessary 

information that permit anticipating, in a reliable way, the components’ behavior in actual 

working conditions. As an example, there are engine’s cylinder head submitted to mechanical 

and thermal tensions that are relatively high during the in service use, and very high in same 

very demanding condition. During long run times and any failure in the cooling and/or 

lubrication the temperature may reach 300ºC. This temperature variation causes thermal 

shocks which may generate cracks and/or a wide ranging of plastic deformation in regions 

close to the pistons. Even not considering the thermal shock effects caused by failure, even so, 

a short number of start-up and shutdown cycles of engine, are considered the main cause of 

small cracks. This indicates that the generation of cracks in cylinder head may be considered 

as low cycle thermomechanical fatigue problem. Another problem is the microstructure 

heterogeneity in the component due to the casting process, leading to different physical and 

mechanical properties in the same piece. Besides the presence of porosity generated by gas 

bubbles and voids of solidification, which may be as great as short crack, reducing the 

nucleation life and changing the problem’s focus for the fatigue crack growth. The purpose of 

this study was to determine the isothermal and thermomechanical fatigue property through 

low cycle fatigue, as well as the fatigue crack growth, relaxation, microestrutural 

characterization and modeling of mechanical behavior by finite element for the aluminum 

alloy employed in the manufacture of engine cylinder head by the national automotive 

industry. All tests and computer analysis were performed in the laboratories of the University 

of São Paulo (EESC-USP) and the École Normale Supérieure de Cachan (ENS-LMT). 

Isothermal fatigue experiments were carried out at temperature of 120ºC and 280ºC and the 

thermomechanical performed in phase between the temperatures of 120ºC and 280ºC. The 

relaxation experiments were performed at some temperatures with trapezoidal wave loading, 

whereas the experiments of fatigue crack growth carried out at temperatures of 120ºC, 200ºC 

and 280ºC for sine and trapezoidal wave loading in displacement and load control. The 

microstructure analysis was also made in the specimens after the fatigue test by optical 

microscopy and scanning electron microscopy SEM. The results of these experiments showed 

that the casting defects and material’s inhomogeneities, coupled long run times in high 

temperatures and loads, are a critical factor in the component performance. These results help 

us to establish accurate models for life prediction of the engine cylinder head.

RÉSUMÉ 

 

ANGELONI, M. Évaluation de la Vie en Fatigue en Alliage d’Aluminium A356 utilisés 

pour la Culasse du Moteur. 2011. 201p. Tese (Doutorado) – Escola de Engenharia de São 

Carlos, Instituto de Física de São Carlos, Instituto de Química de São Carlos, Universidade de 

São Paulo, São Carlos, 2011. 

 

Afin de caractériser les composants qui demande de haut-responsabilité ne suffit pas de 

connaître la composition chimique et les résultats des essais de traction, impact et dureté, car 

ils ne peuvent pas fournir des données nécessaire qui permettent de prédire avec certitude le 

comportement des composants dans les conditions réelles de travail. Des exemples sont des 

culasses du moteur, soumis à des contraintes thermiques et mécaniques relativement élevé en 

utilisation normale et très élevé dans des conditions extrêmes. Pour de longues périodes de 

fonctionnement et pour d’eventuels défauts de refroidissement ou de lubrification la 

température peut atteindre des valeurs proches de 300°C. Cette variation de température 

provoque un choc thermique qui peut provoquer des fissures et/ou une grande quantité de 

déformation plastique dans les régions proches des pistons. Sans tenir compte la présence de 

chocs thermiques causés par des défaillance, encore,  une petite quantité de cycles de démarrer 

et d'arrêt du moteur, est considérée comme la principale cause des fissures petites. Cela 

indique que l'apparition de fissures dans la culasses du moteur doivent être considérés comme 

un problème de fatigue thermomécanique oligocyclique. An autre problème est la 

hétérogénéité de la microstructure du composante en raison du processus de fonderie, 

conduisant à des différents propriétés physiques et mécaniques dans la même pièce. De plus, 

la présence de porosité généré par les bulles de gaz et les vides de la solidification, qui peut 

obtenir une telle taille qui viennent à proximité des petits fissures, réduisant la vie à la 

nucléation et donc changer le centre de l'attention pour la propagation des fissures par fatigue. 

Le but de cette étude était de déterminer les propriétés des essais de fatigue isotherme et 

thermomécanique utilisant de fatigue oligocyclique, ainsi que les propriétés de propagation 

des fissures de fatigue, la relaxation, la caractérisation et la modélisation du comportement 

mécanique par éléments finis pour une alliage d’aluminium utilisé dans la fabrication de 

culasse du moteur automobile par l’industrie nationale. Tous les essais et l'analyse numérique 

ont été effectuées dans les laboratoires de l'Université de São Paulo (USP-EESC) et l'École 

Normale Supérieure de Cachan (ENS-LMT). Les essais de fatigue isotherme ont été effectués 

à des températures de 120°C et 280°C et les thermomécanique ont été réalisées en phase entre 

les températures de 120°C et 280ºC. Les essais de relaxation ont été effectués à différentes 

températures avec des chargement d’ondes trapézoïdale, tandis que les essais de propagation 

des fissures de fatigue ont été réalisés à des températures de 120°C, 200°C et 280°C avec des 

chargement d’ondes trapézoïdale et sinusoïdales sûr le contrôle de charge et de déplacement. 

A été faite l’analyse des microstructures dans les échantillons, après les essais de fatigue, pour 

microscopie optique et microscopie électronique à balayage MEB. Les résultats de ces essais 

ont montré que les défauts de fonderie et le manque d'homogénéité dans le matériau, couplé 

avec des longue temps de exposition à des températures élevées et des charges, constituent un 

facteur critique dans l'exécution de la composante. Ces résultats aideront à établir des modèles 

précis de prédiction de la vie pour les culasses de moteur.

INTRODUCTION 

 

Many machines have several types of components subjected to variations in 

temperature or load during operation. The induced thermal gradient inside these components 

can promote internal stresses and strains and repeated thermal cycles may lead to crack 

nucleation and propagation by a process known as thermo-mechanical fatigue (TMF). 

This process can be clearly seen in internal combustion engines. When this type of 

engine is started, the temperature of the head and valves increases rapidly at the same time 

that the nearby material, which is water cooled, restrains the thermal expansion of the 

material. As a result, there is an increase in thermal stress and significant plastic deformation 

may occur at high temperatures if it exceeds the elastic limit under compression of the 

material. 

Moreover, upon cooling to room temperature, tensile stresses are created and may 

promote cracks and be conducive to component failure (Figure 1). Repeated engine startup-

shutdown cycles can cause these components to undergo plastic deformation, leading to 

stress-strain hysteresis loops and, consequently, TMF. Therefore, the study of the material 

mechanical behavior and fracture mechanisms is vital to a proper engineering design of these 

components.

Materials employed in the making of automotive engine cylinder heads are often 

submitted to critical thermo-mechanical efforts. The development of new materials for the 

automotive industry has been hitherto based almost exclusively on laboratorial specimen 

testing. The financial cost and time expenditure involved in the process, from selection of 

materials to approval for serial production, are high, demanding a wide array of mechanical 

tests. From project planning to production, there is a series of stages before the component is 

approved. 

For example, in the case of an engine cylinder head, some of these steps comprise 

dynamometer tests, whose cost is around R$ 140,000, durability tests (R$ 150,000), piloting it 

in some 300 vehicles, and so forth. Therefore, minor project faults may cause huge financial 

losses and waste of time, which can be minimized by computational simulation. Nowadays, 

there are several models that enable the accurate modeling of the behavior of many materials 

submitted to isothermal loading. However, only recently has intensive development of 

behavior laws under anisothermal conditions started. In some cases, isothermal models can be 

extrapolated for anisothermal solicitation, but some materials display interaction effects 

during the thermal cycle, which can alter their mechanical behavior and lead to non-

conservative predictions of residual lifetime. In this context, it is fundamental to conduct 

anisothermal testing.  

Another problem is the casting-related microstructural heterogeneity, which can give 

rise to different mechanical and physical properties in the same component. Finite elements 

analysis have been used to model casting processes as well as components under real-life 

operational conditions so as to build satisfactory predictive mathematical models capable of 

determining fatigue lifetime of components, thereby diminishing the cost of material selection 

and/or improvement. This study deals with this problem by investigating its influence on the 

component under loading conditions closest to those observed in real life. Therefore, 

investigating the mechanical behavior and developing constitutive equations for these 

materials are vital to better determine their residual lifetime and implement projects of 

components more effectively.  

In the industrial context of this study, i.e., production of cylinder heads of automotive 

engines, the choice of aluminum alloys is based on their good thermal conductivity (better 

engine cooling), good fluidity (implementation of part in casting), easy machining, and low 

weight. However, increased engine performance produces ever-higher operating 



24 

 

temperatures—particularly with diesel engines—between intake valves, the warmest areas of 

the head. 

Although there are studies on the morphology and development of cast aluminum 

alloys, the literature is deficient with regard to cyclic mechanical behavior of these alloys 

under varying temperature conditions, such as those found in transmission housings and 

cylinder heads of engines. 

Numerical simulation is a useful tool for solving equations that predict material 

behavior. The finite element method (FEM) has been developed and applied very 

satisfactorily. Basically, micro-structural features and thermal, mechanical and geometrical 

aspects should be incorporated into TMF process modeling. There are two approaches to 

understanding the TMF process: (1) by modeling crack initiation and propagation at the 

microscopic level, and (2) by taking into account the material macroscopic behavior. 

This study aimed to characterize the mechanical behavior of an aluminum alloy used 

in the production of automotive engine cylinder heads through mechanical testing laboratory 

conducted under conditions of loadings closer to reality of component operation and 

numerical simulation using a Finite Element Software. It is expected that the results presented 

in this study will provide support to product development areas in industry.

CHAPTER 1: MATERIAL 

 

1.1 Metal Alloys in Molten State 

 

Casting is defined as the process of manufacturing metal parts from the liquid state. 

After melting, the metal is poured into molds to obtain components with complex geometries 

and/or close to final measures, in order to avoid waste of raw material and excessive 

machining costs. It is the oldest manufacturing process in recorded history, known for 

thousands of years. Even today it is one of the most widely used processes because it is 

relatively simple and comparatively inexpensive, though it may require the control of a large 

number of variables. 

The production of most metal components involves solidification, a cooling 

phenomenon during which liquid metal is transformed into finished solid objects or ingots, 

which are then processed by other forming means. Basically, the solidification process can be 

divided into nucleation and growth stages. 

During nucleation, liquids present a disordered structure, in which atoms and 

molecules are in constant motion, with no fixed positions. As temperature drops, the total 

energy of atoms decreases thereby increasing the force of attraction among them. At a given 

point, a set of atoms may arrange themselves according to metal crystallographic rules in a 

small area of the liquid, forming a solid nucleus. The development process of stable nuclei 

requires that the system temperature be below the metal solidification point for the energy 

balance to promote its stabilization. 

If the super-cooling level is not sufficient, the nucleus can become unstable and melt 

again. The process may repeat until the temperature is low enough for the formed nuclei to 

display a minimum curvature radius, one that results in an energetically stable structure, as 

shown schematically in Figure 2a. This process is known as homogeneous nucleation. In pure 

metals, the super-cooling temperature needed for stable nucleation to occur may be in the 

order of hundreds of degrees Celsius, e.g., development of stable nuclei in iron only occurs at 

approximately 300°C below its solidification temperature. 

Nevertheless, under real conditions, the presence of impurities and the mold walls 

containing the liquid advance nucleus development. In this case, nucleation is called 

heterogeneous. The presence of elements foreign to the liquid diminishes the amount of 

ordered atoms needed to develop into a solid particle with the minimum curvature radius 



26 

 

required for stabilization (Figure 2b). Most cases of inoculation during casting are based on 

the principle of heterogeneous nucleation, in which particles are intentionally introduced into 

the liquid in order to act as nucleation substrates. The result is a structure with fine particle 

size and better mechanical properties. 

 

 
Figure 2: (a) Homogeneous nucleation and (b) heterogeneous nucleation (Milan, 2004). 

 

After being formed, nuclei tend to grow by accumulation of more solid matter around 

them. This growth may be planar or dendritic. 

If the liquid beyond the solid/liquid interface is at a temperature above fusion, the 

development of protuberances is inhibited and there occurs planar growth of the crystal solid, 

as shown in Figure 3a. Latent solidification heat is removed by thermal conduction through 

the mold walls and, consequently, through the solid formed. 

Dendritic growth is favored when the liquid is in a super-cooled state, i.e., at a 

temperature (Tl) below its melting point (Tf). In this case, the removal of latent heat needed 

for solidification of the liquid occurs by heat transfer, from the interface area to the super-

cooled liquid beyond. This mechanism favors the development of tree-shaped protuberances 

in the solid/liquid interface, called dendrites, as represented in Figure 3b. Development and 

growth of dendrites continue until super-cooling of the liquid continues or when they are 

blocked by the development/growth of other adjacent dendrites. Figure 4 shows the 

appearance of dendritic solidification on the fracture surface of an aluminum alloy with high 

silicon content.

1.2 Cast Aluminum Alloys  

 

Pure aluminum is seldom used because its physic-chemical properties are poor. 

Nonetheless, its alloys are employed widely in automotive and aeronautical industry. 

Aluminum alloys—due to their good mechanical properties and low specific weight—

have been increasingly employed in the production of molded parts, especially in place of iron 

alloys. The specific weight of aluminum is approximately one third that of iron. Another 

important aspect favoring the use of aluminum is related to its recycling, which allows an 

overall assessment of costs compatible to iron components. 

The structure of aluminum alloys comprises solid solutions in the form of more or less 

complex (binary and tertiary) dendrites (hypo-eutectic) and inter-metallic liquid components.

In the Al-Si system, solid crystals of aluminum are formed on the metal mold walls and grow 

inwardly. Its Si composition is lower than that of the liquid that surrounds it, because Si 

solubility in Al decreases with temperature. Therefore, silicon is forced out to the interface 

between the liquid and the surface of growing crystals, thus lowering the solidification 

temperature of the liquid in the region through cryoscopy (liquid state below its normal 

solidification temperature). 

This phenomenon slows solidification of this layer, since it requires that an above 

normal amount of heat be removed for it to occur. But if growing crystal germs find liquid at 

a below solidification temperature, thereby consisting of a silicon-poor medium 

thermodynamically favorable to solidification, they keep on growing as dendrites. 

These initially unstable protuberances grow rapidly, which explains the fact that 

aluminum crystals develop into tree-like shapes (dendrites) instead of spheres or needles 

(Figure 5). Secondary arms are dozens of micrometers apart. This distance between dendrite 

arms is known as dendrite arm spacing (DAS) or secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS). 

 

 
Figure 5: Schematic representation of a dendrite (Massinon &amp;amp; Constantin, 2002). 

 

Then, the eutectic solidifies amid dendrite arms, which are rich in silicon rejected from 

the solidification front (excess silicon in this region). This enriches the surrounding liquid 

metal with silicon, which, upon precipitating as platelets, drains silicon from the solution and 

creates an almost pure aluminum region in the vicinity. An aluminum lamella is, thus, formed. 

Little by little a lamellar eutectic is formed via competitive growth (Figure 6a).

Figure 6: (a) Principle of competitive growth leading to a lamellar eutectic, and (b) schematic 

representation of a lamellar eutectic (Barralis J., Maeder G., 1997). 

 

For instance, in heads of diesel engines, SDAS typically varies from 20?m inside the 

component to about 100?m in areas at lower temperatures. The grain size in cast aluminum 

alloys is generally in the order of millimeters and, therefore, well above the size of a dendrite. 

The mechanical properties of cast aluminum alloys strongly depend on micro-structural 

parameters; there are numerous studies that examine this dependence. 

The acquisition of a given mechanical property also depends on the casting method 

employed (e.g., sand mold, permanent mold, lost-wax, and die casting). In fact, permanent 

mold casting promotes fast cooling, which provides the component with a thinner metallic 

structure (i.e., low SDAS) and higher tensile strength and elongation values as compared to 

those of the same alloy cast in sand, for instance. However, sand mold casting is easy to 

implement and prototypes can be quickly built in order to validate geometry, power, cooling, 

and so forth (except product life). It has been observed that low SDAS improves life under 

fatigue. According to empirical law, the shorter the solidification time (  ), the lower is SDAS 

(fast cooling):

where   and   are constants.

Solidification in the mold occurs on its walls first and progresses toward the center 

until the entire component is solid. This induces a gradient of microstructure and, 

consequently, properties. The literature also indicates the existence of a larger amount of 

pores and eutectic phase in the center, influenced by a lower cooling rate (Equation 1), which 

together with higher SDAS, leads to a shorter life under fatigue of specimens taken from this 

region as compared to those taken from outer regions, where cooling rates are higher. 

Besides the influence of the casting method employed, it is also possible to alter the 

properties of alloys by adding different elements to them. Thus, cast aluminum alloys 

constitute several families of materials whose chemical composition depends on the 

relationship between casting requirements (e.g., flowability, machinability, shrinkage) and the 

way the component will be used (e.g., mechanical properties, surface appearance, and 

corrosion strength). 

Aluminum alloys employed in casting are classified according to their main alloying 

elements. The most common of these classifications is that established by the Aluminum 

Association and adopted by other standards bodies (e.g., ASTM and SAE). According to this 

classification, the most important families are: 

a) 1xx.x – pure aluminum alloys; 

b) 2xx.x – aluminum-copper alloys; 

c) 3xx.x – aluminum-silicon alloys (with addition of magnesium and/or copper); 

d) 4xx.x – aluminum-silicon alloys; 

e) 5xx.x – aluminum-magnesium alloys; 

f) 7xx.x – aluminum-zinc alloys (with addition of magnesium, copper, chromium, 

manganese or combinations of the same); 

g) 8xx.x – aluminum-tin alloys. 

The last digit (after the dot) is employed to describe the nature of the alloy. Therefore, 

the digit ?0? indicates the chemical composition limits; ?1? and ?2? represent cast 

components and ingots with pre-adjusted composition, respectively. 

Variations in the original chemical composition—usually at impurity level—are 

indicated with a capital letter before the alloy number (e.g., 356, A356, A356). 



31 

 

Alloys from 3xx.x and 4xx.x families are the most important, commercially, because 

of their mechanical, corrosion, and casting properties. Alloys belonging to families with 

silicon as their main alloying component represent over 90% of all cast products. 

The other families of alloys display low castability levels, but with specific advantages 

such as: high mechanical properties (2xx), corrosion strength (5xx) or machinability (5xx, 

7xx, and 8xx). 

Table 1 shows an overview of the series of most used aluminum alloys, along with 

their classification given by the AA (Aluminum Association), characteristics, and uses. Table 

2 presents some alloying elements and their effects.

1.3 Aluminum-Silicon 300 Series 

 

These are aluminum alloys that display the best casting characteristics, which is why 

about 90% of aluminum castings belong to the 300 series. Binary alloys have excellent 

ductility, corrosion strength, and good tensile strength. Si increases creep, reduces shrinkage, 

and improves weldability. However, high levels of Si hinder machining. 

Cu addition to Al-Si alloys improves machinability and increases mechanical strength, 

but reduces ductility. Mg addition allows alloys to be hardened by heat treatment thereby 

increasing their mechanical strength. 

Alloys with lower Si concentrations (5 to 7%) are usually employed in sand mold 

casting whereas alloys with high Si content (9 to 13%) are commonly used in permanent mold 

or pressure casting. 



33 

 

Hypereutectic alloys (up to 13% silicon) are known for their high wear strength, low 

thermal expansion coefficient, and high thermal conductivity. 

Hetke and Gundlach (1994) sustain that the aluminum-silicon-magnesium alloy is 

among the easiest to cast irrespective of the casting technique employed. Its main features are 

good mechanical strength, high corrosion strength, heat treatability, and weldability, 

according to ASTM B108-97 (1997). This alloy is commonly used in the annealed condition 

and artificially aged, heat treatment T6. However, for casts with greater dimensional stability, 

it can be used in the solubilized and over-aged condition, T7, resulting in an increase in 

ductility with a slight reduction in strength as compared to T6, according to Byczynski et al. 

(1996). 

During solubilization, magnesium is dissolved into the aluminum matrix after 

quenching and subsequent aging at intermediate temperatures (between 150°C and 200°C); 

the Mg2Si phase precipitates in the aluminum matrix in the form of finely dispersed particles, 

which causes a substantial increase in strength, according to Wang and Cáceres (1997), Lee et 

al. (1998), and Zhang (1996). 

Strength and fracture toughness of the metal matrix can be controlled by varying the 

temperature and aging time. In general, strength is inversely related to ductility and 

toughness. However, toughness can be increased through heat treatment, to the detriment of 

strength. 

Hetke and Gundlach (1994) claim that when the metallurgical quality of castings 

lowers, both strength and toughness decrease. Whenever high toughness values are required, 

there are three ways of achieving these characteristics: 

1. By performing the sub-aging treatment; 

2. By softening via over-aging treatment; 

3. By improving the quality of the cast. 

The first two methods result in decreased mechanical strength and the last one 

increases toughness and strength. The quality of cast aluminum is influenced by various 

micro-structural factors, including the level of silicon modifiers, non-metallic inclusions, 

undesirable inter-metallic phases, micro-porosity, and grain refinement. These characteristics 

have a major impact on the cast fracture toughness and ductility. 



34 

 

The main applications involve general-use components, intake manifolds, cylinder 

engine blocks and heads, automotive and wheel pistons, structural aerospace components, fuel 

and water pumps, and housing and suspension components. 

 

1.3.1 Silicon Modifiers 

 

The vast majority of cast components in aluminum alloys employ Al-Si alloys. It 

happens that the raw microstructure of these cast alloys features Si particles with acicular 

morphology, which is detrimental to ductility (Figure 7). Then, it is necessary to modify this 

morphology in order to obtain high strength and ductility. 

The modification consists of an aluminum-silicon bath treatment by adding agents that 

modify Si-morphology. The most commonly used modifiers are: Na (sodium), Sr (strontium), 

Ca (calcium), and Sb (antimonium). 

Additions of these elements (generally between 0.005% and 0.02% in weight) promote 

major changes in the growth of the   phase (silicon) of the eutectic, which begins to display a 

more refined morphology, thus increasing the ductility of Al-Si alloy casts. 

Irrespective of the modification treatment employed, high cooling rates, such as those 

obtained in metallic molds, contribute to refine grain size and the eutectic structure itself. 

They are also capable of changing the   phase morphology in the same way that it occurs 

chemically, besides contributing to reducing micro-porosity. 

 



35 

 

 
Figure 7: Morphological modifications in Si particles. 

 

Sodium and strontium are employed commercially as effective eutectic modifiers. 

These elements, when added in appropriate amounts, refine and change the morphology of the 

? phase of the eutectic from acicular or coarse lamellar to fibrous. This morphological change 

promotes substantial improvement in mechanical properties, especially ductility. 

Modification with strontium is accomplished through the addition of strontium (Sr) in 

metal form of as Al-Sr pre-alloys. In general, additions are in the order of 0.02% Sr, which 

requires a 15-minute incubation time for bathing with little agitation. 

Modification with sodium is done by adding metal sodium or fluxes containing this 

element. Sodium is a more efficient modifier than strontium, providing better modification 

degrees. However, due to a greater tendency to vaporize, its modifying effect is lost faster 

than that of strontium. In Na-modified baths, the modifying effect remains for about 30 

minutes. In the case of Sr, the effect lasts more than two hours. Another negative aspect of Na 

is the damage it causes to melting crucibles. 

Ganiev and Vakhobov (1983) and Beumler and colleagues (1988) indicate that small 

additions of these elements change the morphology of the eutectic silicon phase from a coarse 

plate-shaped phase to a refined fibrous eutectic. The result is that fragile silicon particles 

become small finely-divided fibers, rather than broad and coarse plates that act as stress 



36 

 

concentrators and weakness planes that promote crack propagation, according to Wang and 

Cáceres (1998) and Digho and Gokhale (1997). 

The degree of silicon modification may vary from weak refinement, resulting in 

silicon platelets, to a thorough change, resulting in refined silicon fibers. According to Hetke 

and Gundlach (1994), the amount of Sr or Na required to promote thorough modification is 

strongly correlated with the solidification rate. The higher the cooling rate, the smaller is the 

required amount of modifiers. At low solidification rates, the required amount of modifiers is 

much greater. It may be very difficult to alter some larger sections of castings. However, high 

solidification rates promote high modification degrees and, consequently, improve mechanical 

properties. 

Na and Sr are mutually compatible so it is possible to use both simultaneously, 

causing no problems due to scrap contamination. 

As compared to non-modified alloys, the alloys treated with sodium and strontium 

show higher tendency to micro-porosity and lower propensity to macro-shrinkages in the 

thicker areas of the components. 

Technologically speaking, this feature of modified alloys allows the production of 

parts with less need for hot top. At the same time, it is virtually impossible to eliminate micro-

porosity formed in all component sections. Modified cast alloys with sodium or strontium 

should not be used when micro-porosity is not tolerated. In these applications, the use of 

unmodified alloys promotes to healthier parts. On the other hand, it requires feeding (hot top) 

in all thick areas where macro-shrinkages concentrate. 

An alternative to modification with sodium or strontium is that with antimonium. 

When this treatment is employed, the   phase morphology remains lamellar, undergoing just 

one refinement, which is enough to develop components with higher degree of reliability than 

that obtained in non-modified alloys. 

Antimonium is widely used in Japan and parts of Europe. Strontium and, to a lesser 

extent, sodium are commonly used in the United States, Canada, parts of Europe, and Brazil. 

Calcium has, even today, little commercial application as a modifier. 

Another kind of eutectic silicon modification takes place during solubilization 

treatment. Solubilization temperatures are high enough to allow silicon migration and later 

spheroidization. The eutectic silicon particles undergo dissolution and partial agglomeration. 

This type of silicon modification also promotes ductility. 



37 

 

 

1.3.2 Non-Metallic Inclusions 

 

Inclusions are foreign materials present in aluminum that can compromise its physical 

and chemical characteristics, such as reducing its mechanical and corrosion strength, as well 

as cause quality problems in the final product. There has been a constant search for 

understanding their origin and means to detect and control them. 

Molten aluminum alloys contain highly reactive metals and oxidation of the molten 

metal is fast. Even in a protective atmosphere, a metal can initiate the process of oxidation. 

Very large oxide inclusions are not readily wet by the molten alloy and act as discontinuities, 

which drastically reduces mechanical strength and ductility. Furthermore, they can greatly 

reduce fatigue resistance, shortening the component life. 

According to Crepeau (1998), various kinds of insoluble sludge can develop in molten 

aluminum alloys at high concentrations of certain impurities. This sludge can gather in the 

liquid pool and later contribute to defects arising in the cast. Over time, it attaches to the 

crucible bottom. Both oxides and sludge must be removed by having the liquid metal filtered 

before it enters the mold cavity. 

 

1.3.3 Inter-Metallic Phases 

 

In furnaces operating at low temperatures in which aluminum is not subjected to 

agitation, alloying elements, such as iron, chromium, manganese, and copper, precipitate and 

thus form a mud or sand at the bottom of the furnace or crucible. Under favorable conditions, 

these alloying elements, which by nature present high density, have their solubility limits 

diminished and thus accumulate at the bottom of the furnace, forming high-density/hardness 

compounds. Their development is predictable as it derives from the percentile participation of 

these alloying elements in aluminum, determined by a so-called Segregation Factor, which is 

calculated as follows: 

                   (2) 

The temperature required to dissolve inter-metallic compounds increases with iron, 

manganese, and chromium content, as shown in Figure 8. 

 



38 

 

 
Figure 8: Segregation Factor 

 

Without adequate control, the impurity content may rise to undesirable levels, 

resulting in the development of inter-metallic phases, which precipitate in inter-dendritic 

regions and around grains. These phases usually give rise to acicular platelets or inter-

dendritic eutectic lattices, which can reduce matrix continuity. As a result, these hard particles 

act as stress raisers, propitiating crack development and decreasing fracture toughness, 

according to Verdu et al. (1996), and fatigue strength, according to Madelaine-Dupuich and 

Stolarz (1996). 

Hetke and Gundlach (1994) sustain that iron and copper are major impurities in Al-Si 

alloys. Iron is particularly damaging because of development of acicular platelets, which 

significantly reduce ductility and fracture toughness. The size of acicular particles and, 

consequently, their influence on ductility are also affected by the solidification rate. When 

balanced with magnesium, iron forms a more compact eutectic phase, i.e., Al15(Fe,Mn)3Si2, 

shaped as ?chinese writing?, less detrimental to mechanical properties, as indicated by 

Crepeau (1998). 

Crepeau (1998) conducted detailed studies on the effect of added iron on the 

mechanical properties of aluminum-silicon alloys. Vorren and colleagues (1984) observed 

that the effect of iron on ductility is highly dependent on the solidification rate. Kim and 

colleagues (1996) studied the effect of iron on mechanical properties (i.e., impact and fatigue) 

of aluminum-silicon alloys. Murali and colleagues (1996) investigated the addition of 



39 

 

beryllium to aluminum-silicon alloys with the intention of nullifying the harmful effect of 

iron on mechanical properties. Figure 9 shows the influence of iron content, solidification 

rate, and SDAS (secondary dendrite arm spacing) on fracture toughness, ductility, and silicon 

particle size of the   phase in a aluminum alloy (Al-7Si-0.4Mg).

1991). 

 



40 

 

1.3.4 Grain Refinement and Porosity 

 

Porosity in aluminum alloys is responsible for decrease in mechanical strength and 

occurrence of cracks and thus constitutes an important problem. According to Hetke and 

Gundlach (1994) and Anson and Gruzleski (1999), two varieties of micro-porosity can occur 

in aluminum castings: porosity resulting from gas (hydrogen) and porosity deriving from 

micro-contraction due to solidification. 

Porosity caused by gas can be controlled through the level of hydrogen dissolved in 

the liquid metal. Hydrogen gas is highly soluble in liquid aluminum; the higher the 

temperature, the more hydrogen is dissolved in aluminum. During solidification, the amount 

of hydrogen dissolved in aluminum in equilibrium certainly diminishes; high cooling speed 

causes hydrogen to saturate in the metal, because the gas does not have enough time to leave 

and is thus trapped, giving rise to porosity especially in thicker areas where solidification last 

occurs. This porosity, usually oblong and bright, compromises the product mechanical 

properties and sealing, making it unfit for use. 

Hydrogen contaminates liquid aluminum, especially by adding solid furnace loads 

contaminated with oil and residues from fusion furnaces. These residues, upon 

decomposition, release oxygen (which reacts with aluminum to form oxides), carbon-enrich 

gases or fumes, and the hydrogen is immediately incorporated into the liquid metal. 

Relative humidity also contributes to aluminum contamination on the surface where 

oxidation and hydrogen absorption occur; liquid aluminum reacts with air moisture:      

                   . This gaseous hydrogen is partly dissolved into liquid aluminum in 

atomic form. During solidification, hydrogen becomes less soluble and recombines, is driven 

out of the solid phase to the liquid phase, which becomes rich in gas, creating bubbles that get 

trapped in the solid. 

Most foundries degasify their baths with great care to minimize gas-related porosity. If 

control is not exercised, gas porosity can easily exceed 4% in volume, seriously degrading 

mechanical properties of castings. Another type of porosity caused by gas derives from 

turbulent feeding, resulting in elongated pores, as stated by Medeiros (1999). 

Porosity caused by solidification micro-contractions occurs because aluminum 

contracts and silicon expands during solidification, which is conducive to a theoretical 

contraction of 0 to 2% (instead of 5.6% in the absence of silicon). This generates a lattice of 



41 

 

cavities, which, when cut, form sets of non-spherical holes of variable sizes (Figure 10a, b e 

c). 

 

 

(b) 

 
(a) (c) 

Figure 10: (a) 3D schematic representation of a solidification void and its 2D projection; (b) 

and (c) optical micrograph of solidification voids (Anson &amp;amp; Gruzleski, 1999). 

 

This type of porosity can be controlled through casting geometry, feeding, and design 

of feeding channels and hot tops. This defect is minimized when these factors are properly 

designed to promote directional solidification. Aluminum castings, when properly designed 

and processed, can exhibit low contraction porosity, 0.5% by volume or less. Hetke and 

Gundlach (1994) claim that pore size and porosity distribution are as important as volume 

fraction. Micro-contraction voids occur in the last solidification stage, i.e., at grain boundaries 

where adjacent grains grow and press against each other. 

When two grains grow adjacent to one another, the feeding needed to make up for 

solid-liquid contraction is interrupted and micro-contraction voids appear. As a result, the size 

of contraction voids is partly determined by grain size; larger grains produce larger 

contraction voids whereas smaller grains produce smaller voids. Figure 11 shows a schematic 



42 

 

representation of micro-contraction voids generated at grain boundaries and the influence of 

grain size. 

 
Figure 11: Schematic representation of void development by micro-contractions in the 

boundaries of grains and the influence of grain size (Hetke &amp;amp; Gundlach, 1994). 

 

High levels of impurity cause the production of inter-metallic phases, which 

precipitate at the grain boundaries, hindering the liquid metal flow and increasing the 

occurrence of micro-contractions. Since grain size is directly proportional to cooling rate, 

sections first to solidify display finer grain sizes and smaller and more dispersed micro-

contraction voids. The solidification rate and SDAS influence on strength and ductility of a 

cast aluminum alloy (Al-7Si-0.4Mg) is shown in Figure 12 (note that the solidification rate is 

inversely proportional to SDAS). These data show that strength and ductility increase 

significantly as solidification rate. 

Grain size can also be reduced by adding inoculants, such as aluminum-titanium-boron 

alloys, which increase the number of grains forming during solidification. Grain refinement 

obtained through inoculation in aluminum bath is followed by contraction porosity dispersion, 

improving the mechanical properties of casts. 

The main purpose of chemically refining the ? phase is to reduce dendrite size, mainly 

by improving feeding conditions and cast mechanical properties and sealing and by reducing 

the tendency to develop hot cracks. In general, refiners hinder the development of columnar 

grains (elongated dendrites) and increase the development of equiaxed grains (less elongated 

dendrites). 



43

an aluminum alloy casting (Al-7Si-0.4Mg) (Campbell, 1991). 

 

1.3.5 Influence of Impurities 

 

Impurities contained in these alloys are important in that they modify, with or without 

intent, several of the material properties. The main impurities are: 

? Iron is a naturally-occurring impurity in silicon and aluminum. It weakens the 

component by promoting the development of hard and brittle inter-metallic 

compounds, which may under mechanical stress, facilitate crack nucleation by 

decohesion. In addition, it interferes with feeding of molten metal to parts of the mold 

by favoring the development of inter-metallic element platelets and diminishing 

sealing of supply channels. In order to display good mechanical properties, iron 

content must be less than 0.14% in first-melting alloys, said to display high purity; 

chromium and manganese have the same effect; 

? Zinc, together with manganese, promotes high impact and strain strength and ductility. 

A low content improves machinability and a high content promotes high contraction 

and hot brittleness; 

? Nickel slightly improves dimensional stability and mechanical properties at high 

temperatures, however at a high cost. Above 5%, it favors high contraction; 



44 

 

? Lead content above 0.05% neutralizes modification by strontium and decreases 

mechanical properties of alloys; 

? Tin reduces mechanical properties and increases porosity; 

? Phosphor is detrimental to hypo-eutectic alloys, since it constitutes a silicon 

germination site; on the other hand, this element is a refiner for hyper-eutectic alloys 

(hyper-silica). In fact, in these alloys, the silicon platelets germinate first and, 

therefore, no aluminum dendrites develop; 

? Antimonium neutralizes phosphor, but is not compatible with strontium; 

? Lithium, easily oxidized, reacts significantly and quickly in alloys. 

 

Additional elements that improve mechanical properties: 

? Titanium is a naturally-occurring impurity in aluminum, but it refines dendrites of the 

aluminum-rich solid solution; hence, it is regarded as a grain refiner; it increases 

tensile strength and ductility and decreases thermal conductivity; 

? Boron prolongs the effect of titanium in re-melting; like titanium, it acts as a grain 

refiner, increases tensile strength and ductility, and decreases thermal conductivity; 

? Sodium and strontium alter the eutectic structure from naturally lamellar to globular, 

which helps reduce risk of contraction, facilitates machining, and improves geometric 

properties; 

? Calcium prolongs modification by sodium. 

 

Al-Si alloys are the most used in industry because of their melt properties, welding 

suitability, good dimensional stability and low melting point. And more, they present good 

resistance to wear, e.g., in periods of engine low lubrication. 

 

1.4 Defects and Fracture Toughness 

 

The quality of castings can be defined by the amount, type, and size of defects in their 

microstructure. Several papers present studies on the influence of defects on mechanical 

properties of aluminum alloys: Cáceres et al. (1999); Jiang et al. (1999); Dabayeh et al. 



45 

 

(1998); Cáceres and Selling (1996); Dabayeh et al. (1996); Stanzl-Tschegg et al. (1995); 

Zieser and Sonsino (1993); and Wickberg et al. (1984). Since the matrix fracture toughness is 

fixed, the larger the defect, the smaller is the load required to initiate and propagate a crack. 

A quality cast displays a structure with minor discontinuities and high fracture 

toughness. With regard to aluminum casts, as indicated by Todinov (1998), certain structural 

features, such as micro-contraction voids and non-metallic inclusions, may be regarded as 

discontinuities. The size and distribution of eutectic silicon phase, inter-metallic phases, and 

inclusions contribute to determining the value of fracture toughness. Therefore, higher 

strength and ductility values are obtained when: 

1. Eutectic silicon modification is large; 

2. Contraction voids are small and few; 

3. Oxides are removed; 

4. Impurities are minimized; 

5. Microstructure exhibits minor dendrite arm spacing. 

 

1.5 Solidification Rate and SDAS 

 

High solidification rates produce important benefits that result in substantial 

improvement of mechanical properties of casts. Rapid solidification reduces grain size and 

refines and disperses porosity by contraction. It also improves eutectic silicon modification, 

resulting in more finely divided silicon particles. These refined silicon phases are more 

susceptible to further modification and agglomeration during heat treatment. Moreover, high 

solidification rates reduce the amount of segregation in the alloy. A decrease in solidification 

distances diminishes the degree of solute redistribution in dendrites and at grain boundaries. 

As a result, development of insoluble impurities is reduced and the size and volume of inter-

metallic phases are minimized, increasing toughness. The amount of Sr needed to modify 

eutectic silicon is also minimized. 

Kuma (1996) sustains that processes with a high solidification rate result in casts with 

better mechanical properties and fatigue strength. Secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) is 

the most direct measure of the solidification rate in a cast. Due to this factor, several studies 

have shown correlations between SDAS and mechanical properties of aluminum-silicon 

alloys, e.g., Doglione et al. (1996), Bamberg et al. (1986), and Oswalt and Misra (1981). 



46 

 

Figure 13 shows a correlation between SDAS, grain size, and local solidification time for the 

Al-4,5Cu alloy. It has become usual to specify the SDAS in critical areas of aluminum casts 

to ensure that the mechanical properties specified in the project are achieved.

- Al-Si alloys are the most used in industry because of their melt properties, welding 

suitability, good dimensional stability and low melting point. 

- Aluminum-Silicon 300 Series are the aluminum alloys that display the best casting 

characteristics. 

- The quality of castings can be defined by the amount, type, and size of defects in 

their microstructure. 

- Porosity in aluminum alloys is responsible for decrease in mechanical strength and 

occurrence of cracks and thus constitutes an important problem. Two varieties of micro-

porosity can occur in aluminum castings: porosity resulting from gas (hydrogen) and porosity 

deriving from micro-contraction due to solidification.

CHAPTER 2: TEMPERATURE EFFECTS 

 

2.1 Effect of High Temperature on Materials 

 

Parts subjected to high temperatures display numerous problems, such as creep, 

oxidation (or corrosion), and fatigue. These damage mechanisms can act independently or in 

concert (which renders the study of damage at high temperatures more complex), according to 

material variables and operating conditions, such as maximum and minimum temperature, 

temperature range, mechanical strain range, strain rate (in-phase or out-of-phase) or 

environmental factors (Cai, 1999). Conform to Engler-Pinto Jr. (1995), the damage caused by 

these factors is in the inception of nucleation of cracks that propagate and cause fatigue 

failure. However, as temperature rises well above room temperature, creep becomes important 

and is the main cause of fracture at still higher temperatures (temperatures above half the 

melting point). 

A high temperature for one material may not be considered high for another, then, it is 

usually expressed as homologous temperature, i.e., the ratio between the test temperature and 

melting temperature of the metal in question, both in absolute scale (Kelvin). According to 

Dieter (1981), as a rule, flow reaches significance in engineering at homologous temperatures 

higher than 0.5. 

In general, mechanical strength of metals decreases as temperature increases above 

room temperature (Figure 14). This is mainly due to increased mobility of atoms as 

temperature rises. 

 



49 

 

 
Figure 14: Influence of temperature on fatigue limit for different alloys (Fuchs, 2001). 

 

Therefore, diffusion-controlled processes have a very significant impact on 

mechanical properties at high temperatures. High temperatures also result in greater mobility 

of dislocations due to the scaling mechanism, which becomes important because of higher 

dissemination and also because the concentration of gaps in equilibrium increases with 

increasing temperature. In addition, new strain mechanisms may become operative. In some 

metals, the sliding system changes or additional sliding systems are introduced. 

Strain at grain boundaries becomes an additional possibility in strain of metals at high 

temperatures. Another important factor to consider is the effect of prolonged exposure of 

metals and alloys to high temperatures on their metallurgical stability. Cold-worked metals 

can re-crystallize and undergo grain growth whereas age-hardened alloys may undergo over-

aging and lose strength as second-phase particles grow. The metal-environment interaction, 

i.e., oxidation, is also an important factor to be taken into account (Dieter, 1981). 

It is also important that mechanical properties at high temperatures should always be 

considered in relation to a time scale. The mechanical properties at room temperature of most 

engineering metals are not, for practical purposes, time-dependent. However, at high 

temperatures, strength becomes very dependent on both strain rate and exposure time. Under 

these conditions, many metals behave, in many respects, as visco-plastic materials. 

Creep or crack growth can occur when materials are subjected to constant stress, 

which causes their strain response to change. A metal subjected to constant tractive loading 

and high temperatures flows and undergos an increase in length that depends on time. Under 



50 

 

constant strain conditions, relaxation can occur, changing the strain exerted on the material. 

This time-dependence of mechanical properties at elevated temperatures differs for each 

material and is related to the temperature to which the material is exposed (Fuchs, 1980). 

Therefore, some important factors to be taken into account when materials are undergoing 

fatigue at high temperatures are discussed in the following section. 

 

2.2 Creep-Fatigue Interaction 

 

Components that are in a permanent state of cyclic loading at high temperatures may 

be subjected to creep-fatigue interaction, since they can be damaged by micro-structural 

creep. Therefore, resistance to low-cycle fatigue and mastery of the creep-fatigue interaction 

process are important criteria in the development of components that will operate under limit 

conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to understand cyclic strain and fracture behavior in 

materials at various loading rates and high temperatures (Srinivasan, 2003). 

Creep is the strain occurring in solid materials over time when they are subjected to 

constant loading at high temperatures, which may eventually lead to fracture. Although this 

strain can occur at all temperatures, it is only significant when it occurs at temperatures 

corresponding to 30% of the melting point for pure metals and 40% for metal alloys (Dry, 

2001; Es-Soun, 2001a, Langdon, 2002). 

Transition from fatigue failure to creep failure with increasing temperature almost 

always changes fracture type from trans-granular, typical of fatigue failure, to inter-granular, 

characteristic of creep failure (Fuchs, 2001). Local oxidation of grain boundaries can 

significantly contribute to crack initiation. Dieter (1981) sustains that the amount of creep 

increases with average strain at all temperatures. Ferrous materials, which usually have a 

pronounced fatigue limit in tests at room temperature, display the same performance when 

tested at temperatures above about 420°C. Fatigue tests at high temperatures also depend on 

how often strain is applied. It is common to refer to the total time required to fracture in the 

same way as to the number of cycles. 

In general, the higher the material creep resistance, the greater is its fatigue strength at 

high temperatures. However, the metallurgical treatment that produces better fatigue 

properties at high temperatures does not necessarily result in better creep properties. This was 

shown by Toolin and Mochell in Dieter (1981) for several alloys in tests at high temperatures. 

At low temperatures, the smaller the metal grain size, the better is its performance under 



51 

 

fatigue. As test temperature is increased, the difference between the performance of a fine-

grained material under fatigue and that of a coarse material decreases up to very high 

temperatures, at which flow dominates. Then, the material with larger grain size displays 

higher resistance. Typically, alloys mechanically worked beforehand have somewhat higher 

fatigue strength, while cast materials are often more resistant to creep. The solutions that 

succeed in reducing fatigue failure at room temperature may not be effective at high 

temperatures. Compressive residual stresses, for example, can be alleviated before the 

component operating temperature is reached. 

Nucleation of fatigue cracks is basically a surface phenomenon. In contrast, creep 

damage is manifested both on the surface and inside the material. Thus, creep can influence 

both crack initiation and growth (Sarabanda, 1991). Wareing (1983) states that creep damage 

is manifested by cavity nucleation at grain boundaries due to cavity coalescence, dislocation 

stacking, and grain boundary sliding. 

The same may happen to second-phase particles. The subsequent growth of these 

cavities leads to grain boundary cracking and inter-granular fracture. Under static loading, 

failure is established by catastrophic fracture; that is when cavities coalesce. In low-cycle 

fatigue with overlapping loading levels at high temperatures, fracture occurs when cavities 

achieve a critical geometric configuration. 

Creep damage may derive from tensile residual stress caused by strain under 

compression followed by its reversion. In both cases, inelastic deformation takes place under 

zero total strain, though with differing signs of residual stress. Other loadings involving 

inelastic deformation, found in components subjected to thermal fatigue, may be simulated in 

mechanical tests (Wareing, 1983; Skelton, 1983; Hales, 1983). The dwell time at certain 

levels of stress or strain is another independent variable, ranging from seconds to hours. 

Dwell under tensile load are generally more damaging than those under compression 

when applied separately. The application of retention under traction load and, shortly 

afterward, a dwell under compression load appears to produce less damage than applying the 

former in isolation. Wareing (1983) claims that this is due to a healing effect, that take place 

in the compressive part of loading cycle, on the cavities formed during the tensile part of the 

dwell cycle. This is a complex phenomenon and requires the knowledge of the mechanism of 

micro-structural creep damage. However, some side effects to elastic energy becoming 

inelastic deformation may be found even in the absence of micro-structural damage. The most 

important effect is the variation of the mean stress caused by the inelastic deformation, mainly 

for materials with high creep strength. For completely reverse cycles, a dwell in the tensile 



52 

 

half-cycle leads to a compressive mean stress; in the case of a dwell in the compressive part of 

the cycle, the mean stress changes in the tensile direction. In the latter, life time under fatigue 

is reduced as a result of higher tensile stress and not quite because of inelastic deformation 

(ASM, 1985). 

Another phenomenon occurring in materials is creep relaxation. Stress relaxation 

usually occurs in parts joined by screws (flanges) and hot-set assemblages. When these 

components are in operation at high temperatures, their joints can become loose and produce 

disconnection between their parts due to excessive screw stretching and/or flange rotation. 

Relaxation consists of reducing applied load (stress) over time at constant strain. 

Strain constancy is obtained by reducing load or stress over time or by stopping the 

movement of the engine heads, considering load in relation to time at a fixed position of the 

heads. As temperature is usually high, these cases produce creep conditions. The total strain 

( ) is equal to the sum of elastic deformation (  ) and plastic deformation or creep rate (  ). 

For the strain ? to remain constant, elastic deformation has to decrease with time and plastic 

deformation has to grow proportionately, and, as a result, the stress required to have a 

constant ? should decrease with increasing creep. The increase in    is equal to or smaller than 

the increase in    (Souza, 1982). 

 

2.3 Damage and Crack Initiation at High Temperatures 

 

Nucleation of fatigue cracks in alloys at high temperatures is influenced by several 

temperature-dependent microscopic processes at both the strain level and the environment 

level. Mechanisms accountable for fatigue crack initiation may be usually grouped into the 

following categories: (a) cyclic sliding-induced cracking; (b) creep-related grain boundary 

cavitation; (c) grain boundary sliding and wedge crack development; (d) void nucleation and 

growth from inclusions and precipitates; and (e) oxidation and corrosion. 

 

2.3.1 Cyclic Sliding 

 

Cyclic sliding is affected by temperature. The following points illustrate the role 

played by temperature in this phenomenon. 



53 

 

1. At temperatures higher than half the homologous temperature, most materials begin to 

exhibit alternated sliding characteristics. In alloys with solid solution, stacking failure 

energy generally increases with increasing temperature. Thermal activation also 

enables displacement movement of by cross slipping and climbing. 

2. Kinematic irreversibility of cyclic sliding is increased by oxidation and/or gas 

diffusion at high temperatures. 

3. Alternate sliding may be counteracted in some materials by dynamic strain aging that 

favors planar sliding. 

4. Displacement movement by climbing is time-dependent, which makes strain at high 

temperatures sensitive to strain rate. 

5. For most engineering materials, micro-structural stability decreases at higher 

temperatures. Thermally activated micro-structural changes may arise as a result of 

aging by strain, recovery, or precipitation. These micro-structural changes can be 

beneficial or harmful to fatigue strength; they can also modify significantly cyclic 

stress-strain characteristics. 

 

2.3.2 Creep Cavitation 

 

According to Suresh (1998), at temperatures between one and two thirds the melting 

point and at low stress, most metals, alloys, and ceramics exhibit creep by cavitation at grain 

boundaries. These cavities nucleate at triple points of grain boundaries, in grain boundary 

particles, or protrusions in intergranular facets. In many engineering alloys, creep cavities 

nucleate well below the 100 MPa nominal stress, and their nucleation occurs continuously 

over a substantial fraction of creep life (Riedel, 1987). Shear slipping of grain boundary faces 

also favors cavity nucleation. 

A particularly interesting aspect of creep cavitation under cyclic loading is that the 

degree of cavitation is strongly influenced by stress waveform. Slow creep rates under 

traction and fast rates under compression, i.e., waveforms with long periods of tensile stress, 

exhibit greater propensity for cavitation than balanced loading cycles in which the magnitude 

of part of the traction loading varies identically to the compression phase, as shown in Figure 

15 (Majumdar, 1980; Baik, 1982). 



54 

 

Reidel (1987) took into account different creep cavitation theories for slow and fast 

fatigue loading and presented a map of mechanisms for life under fatigue in relation to 

temperature for fixed values of deformation variation (  ) and test frequency. 

 
Figure 15: (a) Balanced, slow-fast, and fast-slow fatigue loading; (b) map of mechanisms of 

life under fatigue in relation to temperature (for fixed values of non-linear variation of strain 

and frequency) for fast-slow loading in fatigue-creep (Reidel, 1987). 

 

At intermediate temperatures represented by region C, cavity growth occurs by 

diffusion, in which cavities nucleate continuously throughout the creep-fatigue test. For low 

values of accumulated strain (       ), the effect of frequency (  ) and temperature ( ) in 

region C are described by the relationship (                
   

), in which    is the diffusion 

coefficient of the grain boundary. For larger values of    (Regime B), the accumulated strain 

is so large that the density of cavities saturates early in fatigue life; in this case, 

              . For low temperatures (Region A), the plastic growth of cavities is postulated 

as the dominant mechanism. This process does not depend on frequency if the development of 

surface cavities is irreversible. 

For higher temperatures (Region D), cavities grow so fast that the applied strain rate—

assumed to be constant in Figure 15b—may not be capable of accommodating the cavity 

volume for a long time. As a result, cavity growth is hindered in the slow-fast loading mode. 

For even higher temperatures (Region E), the growth of restrained cavities takes place in the 

fast compression segment. Since diffusion rates are high at these temperatures, cavity growth 

is restrained under both traction and compression. This is conducive to zero cavity growth 

thereby improving life under fatigue. 

 



55 

 

2.3.3 Grain Boundary Sliding 

 

Many experimental studies (e.g., Driver, 1971; Min &amp;amp; Raj, 1979) showed that grain 

boundary sliding plays an important role in nucleation of inter-granular cavities in creep 

fatigue. This process is also a mechanistic consideration in empirical partitioning of inelastic 

deformation variation when estimating creep-fatigue life. On the assumption that grain 

boundary sliding is the rate-limiting step in crack nucleation at triple junctions and that it does 

not occur above a critical strain rate value (    ), Min and Raj (1979) developed the following 

model (Equation 3): 

     
            

            
 

 (3) 

where    is the material yield stress,    is the atomic volume,   is Boltzmann’s constant,   is 

absolute temperature (K),    is the grain size,    is the fraction by volume of cavity-

nucleating particles at the grain boundary, and    is the average particle size. The remaining 

terms are defined in the following section. 

According to this theory, if the waveform is such that strain rates in stress and 

compression are below a critical value, no net harm is produced as long as grain boundary 

sliding occurs equally in the direction of advance and reverse loading. When fast and slow 

loading and strain rate, during compression, is greater than     , maximum damage is 

produced. Although this model is a simplification of the grain sliding process, it provides 

understanding of how waveform affects fatigue at high temperatures in many alloys. 

Grain boundary cavitation can be affected by relative temperature and stress variations 

with time. Experiments of Fujino and Taira (1980) on AISI 304 stainless steel showed that 

cyclic in-phase temperature and stress variations produce greater damage in fatigue than off-

phase thermo-mechanical loading. In addition, off-phase loading produces shorter fatigue life 

than isothermal mechanical fatigue. This variation of fatigue strength for different thermo-

mechanical loading conditions seems to imply a correlation with amount of grain boundary 

sliding. 

Sub-surface fatigue crack nucleation can occur at high temperatures by decohesion of 

inclusions and second-phase particles from the matrix. In some aluminum alloys, void 

nucleation around precipitates at the grain boundary causes cavitation even at low 

temperatures (Vasudevan, 1987). Furthermore, an increase in precipitation during the fatigue 

process at high temperatures produces a large number of void nucleation sites. 



56 

 

 

2.3.4 Oxidation and Corrosion 

 

The presence of an oxidizing or aggressive environment may have an influence on 

mechanisms of crack nucleation by fatigue at high temperatures as follows: 

1. By preventing cavity closure or sintering at high temperatures; 

2. Under the influence of applied stress, cavities develop around precipitates at grain 

boundaries (Wells, 1979). Moreover, precipitation of residual gases can provide nuclei 

for cavities, with internal gas pressure accelerating cavity growth. If grains near the 

surface are not protected by an oxide layer, oxygen or other embrittling element may 

spread at grain boundaries and react with existing precipitates. 

3. The combination of surface diffusion and oxidation during sliding promotes kinematic 

increases in cyclic sliding, which results in nucleation of fatigue cracks (Figure 16). 

This process is known as Fujita’s mechanism (Fujita, 1963). 

4. Preferential oxidation at some micro-structural sites, e.g., the intersection of grain 

boundaries and free surfaces, gives rise to microscopic stress concentrators (notches). 

These micro-notches increase local stress and promote crack nucleation (Duquette, 

1979). 

5. Repeated loading breaks through the protecting oxide film on the material surface. The 

lack of this film provides an active path for chemical attack. Furthermore, cracking of 

the fragile oxide film per se can promote growth of catastrophic fatigue cracks (Wells, 

1979). 

For many materials, deterioration of fatigue strength at elevated temperatures is merely a 

result of interactions with the environment. The experimental basis for this inference may be 

found in Coffin (1973) for AISI A286 ferrous alloy (Figure 17). 

Here the variation of plastic deformation (   ) with the number of cycles to fail (  ) is not 

affected by temperature or frequency in vacuum. However, when testing frequency is 

lowered, low-cycle fatigue life is severely reduced at elevated temperatures in air.

considered in relation to a time scale.

CHAPTER 3: FATIGUE  

 

3.1 Fatigue at High Temperature 

 

Several mechanical or structural components are subjected to high temperatures and/or 

thermal gradients during operation, as shown in Table 3. Temperature loops and external 

mechanical loadings may cause crack nucleation and propagation through processes known as 

fatigue, which may be of high or low cycle and occur isothermally or anisothermally 

(Sehitoglu, 1996).

A fatigue test comprises the application of cyclic loading to an adequate and 

standardized specimen in relation to the type of test to be conducted. Metallic materials, when 

subjected to repetitive or fluctuating stress, i.e., when under cyclic stresses, break up at stress 

levels well below those predicted by stress and strain tests. Failure occurring under these 

dynamic conditions of stress application is known as fatigue failure. This phenomenon takes 

place within a considerable time after the material has been subjected to stresses. As 

technology develops, as required by industry (e.g., aviation and automotive), and incorporates 

new components and equipment that are continuously subjected to dynamic forces and 

vibration, fatigue has become the cause of over 90% of failure of metallic components in 

operation. Fatigue failure is rather unpredictable, because it happens without notice. 



60 

 

Around 1871, German engineer A. Wöhler conducted the first systematic investigation 

of fatigue behavior of rail axes. He conducted fatigue tests with real-size models as well as 

small specimens subjected to cyclic bending, torsion and stress-compression, using various 

types of materials. Results were recorded in terms of conventional stress ( ) in relation to the 

logarithm of the number of cycles ( ), which became known as ?-N curves or Wöhler curves. 

A     curve is usually determined using certain quantities of specimens according to 

recommendations found in ASTM E466 (1996), ASTM E468, and ASTM E739 (1991). It is 

recommended, among other things, a minimum quantity of specimens be used for each stress 

level tested, which is determined by the accuracy degree required of the test. 

The stress-life (   ) method was the first methodology employed in an attempt to 

understand and quantify fatigue of metals. This methodology is extensively used in design 

applications where applied stress is predominantly within the elastic regime of the material 

and the resulting life (cycles to fail) is long, stress and strain being linearly related, known as 

high-cycle fatigue. Therefore, in this period, the results of tests under controlled load or strain 

are equivalent, but     curves are generated by testing under controlled load. However, the 

stress-life method does not suit low-cycle applications, in which applied strains have a 

significant plastic component. In this case, a strain-based approach is more appropriate 

(Bannantine, 1990). 

 

3.2 Low-Cycle fatigue 

 

In the strain-based approach there is low-cycle fatigue related to operational 

conditions in which failures occur at relatively high stresses and low numbers of cycles to 

failure (less than    ). The conditions for low-cycle fatigue to occur often arise when 

repeated stresses are of thermal origin. Because thermal stresses are due to the material 

thermal contraction or expansion, fatigue results from cyclic strain instead of cyclic stress. 

Also, according to Suresh (1998), information from cyclic stress analyses based on 

continuum mechanics is primarily related to elastic deformation without mechanical 

restriction. In many practical applications, engineering components are often subjected to 

some degree of structural restriction and localized plastic deformation, particularly in areas of 

stress concentration. This type of problem should be taken into account when designing 

pressure vessels for nuclear industry, steam turbine components, aircraft engines, and many 

other types of equipment and machines, e.g., brake discs (Dieter, 1981). 



61 

 

Low-cycle fatigue tests are carried out under controlled strain and results are plotted in 

graphs as strain logarithm in relation to the logarithm of number of reversals (   ). 

Coffin and Manson, cited in Suresh (1998), worked independently on thermal fatigue 

problems and proposed the characterization of life under fatigue based on the extent of plastic 

deformation. They observed a linear relationship (Equation 4) between the logarithm of 

plastic deformation amplitude and the logarithm of the number of reverse to failure in metallic 

materials. 

   

 
   

       (4) 

where   
  is the fatigue ductility coefficient and   the fatigue ductility exponent. In general   

  

is approximately equal to the true ductility coefficient (  ) in traction and   ranges from -0.5 

to -0.7 for most metals. 

In bi-logarithmic scale, Equation 4 may be expressed as a straight line, as shown in 

Figure 18. The total strain amplitude of a test with constant strain amplitude may be described 

as the sum of elastic and plastic deformation amplitudes, as shown by Equation 5:

The fatigue strength coefficient (  
 ) and the fatigue strength exponent (b) are fatigue 

properties of materials. Values of   range from -0.05 to -0.12, and for many metals   
  is 

approximately equal to the actual strain at fracture, determined by stress tests.

where   is Young’s modulus. 

It is possible to rewrite Equation 5 as indicated in Equation 8: 

  

 
 

  
 

 
        

       (8) 

The total, plastic and elastic strain amplitudes are shown in Figure 20 in relation to the 

number of reverses to failure (  ). It is possible to define a transition between low and high-

cycle fatigue at the point where elastic and plastic deformation amplitudes are the same (   ). 

According to Suresh (1998), plastic deformation predominates over elastic deformation and 

fatigue strength is controlled by the material ductility for low-cycle fatigue         . As 

for high-cycle fatigue         , elastic deformation is more significant than plastic 



63 

 

deformation and life is controlled by the material strength. Optimization of fatigue properties 

is conducive to a balance between strength and ductility of the material. 

 

 
Figure 20: Total strain amplitude in relation to number of reverses to failure, obtained from 

the superposition of elastic and plastic deformation in relation to number of reverses to failure 

(Fuchs, 2001). 

 

Low-cycle fatigue tests are usually conducted under controlled strain. Figure 21 show 

an ideal stress-strain loop resulting from a low-cycle fatigue test in which cyclic strain is kept 

constant. 

 



64 

 

 
Figure 21: Ideal strain-stress hysteresis loop resulting from a low-cycle fatigue test under 

constant cyclic strain (Thomas, 1987). 

 

During loading and unloading, a hysteresis loop originates, whose dimensions are 

described as width (  ), total strain period, and height (  ), which is the period between 

stresses. The total strain period (  ) comprises an elastic deformation component (    

    ) and a plastic deformation component (   ). The hysteresis loop width depends on the 

cyclic strain level; at low levels, hysteresis loops become very narrow. 

For tests performed under constant   , the stress period (  ) usually varies with the 

increase in the number of cycles. Annealed materials undergo cyclic hardening, which means 

that    increases with the number of cycles until it saturates after about 100 strain cycles. The 

larger the value of   , the greater is the increase in the stress period. Materials that have 

previously undergone cold work experience cyclic softening, i.e.,    decreases with 

increasing number of strain cycles. Therefore, the usual way of presenting results of low-cycle 

fatigue tests is by plotting the strain amplitude (    ) as a function of the number of reversals 

to fail (   ). 

Low-cycle fatigue is usually referred to as low-cycle isothermal fatigue, low-cycle 

thermal fatigue, or low-cycle thermo-mechanical fatigue. Low-cycle fatigue may be 

characterized as: (1) high-strain cycling when the range of inelastic deformation in the cycle 

exceeds that of elastic deformation; and (2) inelastic deformations of such magnitude that they 

spread through the microstructure evenly. Fatigue damage at high temperatures originates as a 

result of inelastic deformations when irrecoverable. In the case of low cycles, the material is 

damaged after a small number of cycles. Thermo-mechanical fatigue usually derives from 

low-cycle fatigue, e.g., in jet engines the highest thermal transients and gradients occur during 



65 

 

engine startup/shutdown. The total number of take-offs and landings during an aircraft life is 

below 30,000 cycles. In this case, laboratory investigations are carried out under low-cycle 

conditions and may be completed in a short period of time. 

 

3.3 Isothermal Fatigue 

 

An isothermal fatigue test consists of imposing varying mechanical strains at constant 

temperature. This type of test has been widely used since the 1970s upon the advent of test 

equipment that operates in closed loop. Its main advantages are easy conduction and low cost 

as compared to an anisothermal test; results for several materials may be found in the 

literature (Coffin Jr., 1954). 

Studies conducted by several researchers have shown that isothermal fatigue life is 

longer than that of anisothermal fatigue (Hertnarski, 1991; Shi, 1998). This may be attested 

by the study carried out by Shi et al. (cited in Shi, 1998), shown in Figure 22, with a 

molybdenum alloy containing 0.5% Ti, 0.08% Zr, and 0.01-0.04% carbon. 

 

 
Figure 22: Isothermal and thermo-mechanical fatigue curves (Shi, 1998). 

 



66 

 

Life obtained by isothermal fatigue tests for two temperature levels (350°C and 

500°C) was longer, in both cases, than that found in in-phase thermo-mechanical fatigue at 

temperatures ranging from 350°C to 500°C, which points that temperature variation causes 

great damage to material. However, for the two types of isothermal tests under analysis, no 

clear difference was observed for number of cycles to specimen failure, which shows that the 

material displays good strength within this temperature range. Then, designs based solely on 

isothermal fatigue results of components that operate at high temperatures are not reliable. It 

is important to conduct an in-depth investigation into behavior of materials subjected to this 

phenomenon, including tests using different temperature ranges (anisothermal fatigue) and 

under varying stress and strain conditions. 

Figure 23 shows that the longest life under isothermal fatigue occurs within an applied 

intermediate temperature range. Within this range the shortest life for 316L (N) austenitic 

stainless steel under isothermal fatigue occurred at room temperature (25°C), where strain 

induced the development of martensite. 

 

 
Figure 23: Effect of temperature on fatigue life (Srinivasan, 2003). 

 

On the other hand, at 573K (300°C) the material underwent sub-structural recovery, 

which was responsible for increased life. 

However, a sub-structural recovery of the material occurred at 573K (300°C), which 

was responsible for increase in life. The reduction in life as temperature continued to rise may 

be attributed to several effects of dynamic strain, e.g., stress concentration induced by pilling 



67 

 

up of dislocations when the maximum stress of the cycle is reached, causing an increased 

crack growth rate. This may be clearly seen at temperatures higher than 873K (600°C), at 

which life was significantly reduced by oxidation (Srinivasan, 2003). 

Another aspect to be noted about isothermal fatigue with controlled strain is the 

behavior of cyclic stress in relation to life. For 316L(N) austenitic stainless steel, behavior 

was monitored in four stages, as shown in Figure 24 (Srinivasan, 2003). 

 
Figure 24: Cyclic stress response in relation to temperature (Srinivasan, 2003). 

 

The alloy exhibited a short period of cyclic hardening, reaching the maximum stress in 

the first life stage. Then, it may be observed that cyclic softening takes place before stable 

regime is achieved. In the period prior to fracture, stress amplitude decreases rapidly, 

indicating the development of a macro-crack and its subsequent spread. The same figure 

indicates that the amplitude of the stress peak increases with increasing temperature between 

573K and 873K (Srinivasan, 2003). Also, it shows that some factors contribute to the drop in 

material strength as temperature increases: (a) abnormal cyclic hardening rate and reduced 

plastic deformation amplitude in the intermediate life to fracture; and (b) increased maximum 

stress rate during the initial stages with increasing temperature due to inductive interaction 

developed between diffusion solutes and discrepancy mobility under strain. All these 

phenomena are considered to be a manifestation of dynamic strain processes. 

A more detailed discussion comparing isothermal and anisothermal fatigue can be found 

below.

3.4 In-Phase and Out-of-Phase Thermomechanical Fatigue and Thermal Fatigue 

 

Several components are subjected to a variety of thermal and thermo-mechanical loads 

due to temperature variations during operation. The conditions of cyclic loading induced by 

temperature gradient are essentially strain-constrained loads. Then, laboratory studies on 

thermal fatigue are usually constrained by strain control in low-cycle fatigue tests (Hetnarski, 

1991). Research on mechanical behavior and fracture mechanisms of these materials is 

important to improve design and use of these components. 

If stress develops under thermal cycling without external loading in a component, the 

term thermal fatigue (TF) is employed. This process may result from steep temperature 

gradients in a component, or through a section, and may occur in a perfectly homogeneous 

and isotropic material. For example, when heated, a surface is compressed by the cooler 

material below the surface. Thus, the surface is subjected to compressive stresses. Under 

cooling, strain is in the opposite direction, and tensile stresses may develop. Under heating 

and cooling cycles, the surface can be damaged by TF. Classic TF examples may be found in 

train wheels subjected to the action of brake shoes, which generates temperature gradients 

and, consequently, internal stresses (Sehitoglu, 1996). 

On the other hand, TF may develop in laboratory specimens, even under uniform 

temperature conditions, because of internal constraints, such as orientation of different grains 

at a microscopic level or anisotropy of the thermal expansion coefficient of some crystals (not 

cubic). Strains and internal stresses may be big enough to cause expansion, distortion and 

surface irregularities in the material. Consequently, thermal loops lead to micro-structural 

damage and deterioration. This behavior has been observed in pure metals such as uranium, 

tin, cadmium-based alloys, and duplex steels whose microstructure consists of ferrite and 

martensite. 

The term thermo-mechanical fatigue (TMF) describes fatigue under variation of both 

temperature and mechanical strain. Mechanical strain is determined by subtracting thermal 

strain from total strain, which should be uniform throughout the specimen. Mechanical strain 

derives from external constraints or externally applied loads. For example, if a specimen is 

held between two rigid walls and subjected to thermal cycling (without allowing for 

expansion), it will undergo "external" compressive mechanical strain. TMF examples can be 

found in pressure vessels and pipelines in the power generation industry, where structures are 

subjected to pressure loads and thermal transients with temperature gradients in the thickness 



69 

 

direction, and the aircraft industry, where turbine blades and disks are subjected to 

temperature gradients aggravated by rotation-related stress. 

According to Sehitoglu (1996), thermo-mechanical fatigue may involve several 

mechanisms that add damage to that of "pure" fatigue, including creep and oxidation at 

elevated temperatures, which directly contribute to further damage. These mechanisms differ 

from each another, depending on strain and temperature history. They are different from those 

predicted by fluidity tests (no reversals) and by oxidation tests without stress (or with constant 

stress). Micro-structural degradation may occur under TMF as: (1) over-aging, such as 

coalescing of lamellae and precipitates; (2) strain aging for systems hardened by solid 

solution; (3) precipitation of second-phase particles; and (4) phase transformation at the cycle 

limit temperature. Variations in mechanical properties or in the thermal expansion coefficient 

between the matrix and precipitates—found in many alloys—also cause local stresses and 

cracks. These mechanisms affect the strain characteristics of the material, which are 

inexorably associated with damage processes. 

For this reason, more advanced test techniques at varied temperatures were developed, 

such as the thermal fatigue (TF) test and thermo-mechanical fatigue (TMF) test, whose main 

differences are shown schematically in Figure 25 (Meyer-Olbersleben, 1995; Engler Pinto, Jr., 

1994). 

A TF test involves subjecting a specimen with geometry similar to that of the 

component under study to alternating heating and cooling cycles. Stresses of internal origin 

derive from the specimen geometry, warming and cooling rates, and material properties. It is a 

more technological test; its results enable immediate design application as it is capable of 

determining the life of a specimen with geometry similar to that of the component studied and 

can be used to reliably compare different types of materials. On the other hand, it has the 

disadvantage of not allowing direct strain and stress measurements, which have to be 

calculated, for instance, by means of the finite element method. To do so, according to Mallet 

et al. (1995), it is necessary to use a mathematical model to express the material mechanical 

behavior. 

 



70 

 

 
Figure 25: Comparison between thermal fatigue tests and thermo-mechanical tests (Engler-

Pinto Jr., 1996). Todos os parâmetros mecânicos medidos durante o ensaio 

 

The TMF test, however, is characterized by independent and simultaneous overlapping 

of a strain cycle in relation to time (    ) and a temperature vs. time cycle (    ) in 

accordance with a previously established thermo-mechanical history. The external strain 

imposed by an especially-adapted and computerized testing machine replaces the internal 

strain of the TF test. The test is uniaxial and should be performed at low frequencies in order 

to avoid temperature gradients throughout the specimen. Despite its complexity and high cost, 

this test is more scientific in that the researcher can control all the influential parameters. It is 

useful to determine the mechanical behavior of materials under anisothermal conditions 

(closer to reality). Hence, it assists in the development and allows the verification of 

mathematical models employed to calculate stresses and strains of real components or TF 

specimens (Mallet, 1995; Guedou, 1992). 

Sehitoglu (1996) sustains that an important distinction must be made between TMF 

and thermal shock. Thermal shock involves a very rapid variation in temperature (due to 

surface heating or internal heat generation), and resulting strains are generally different from 

those produced under slow heating and cooling conditions (i.e., quasi-static). Physical 

properties such as conductivity and specific heat, which do not arise in cases of low strain 



71 

 

rate, are clearly present in thermal shock cases. Strain rate affects the material response and 

should be taken into account when analyzing damage due to thermal shock or choosing 

materials with better thermal shock strength. 

Sehitoglu (1996) and Sarabanda (1991) claim that if a body is subjected to thermal 

cycling conditions with overlaying loads in the section, the component will undergo cyclic 

thermal creep (thermal ratcheting), which is gradual accumulation of inelastic deformation 

cycles. This type of failure involves ductile rupture and fatigue mechanisms, which 

sometimes occur unintentionally during TMF tests when an area of the specimen is warmer 

than its surroundings, causing a lump to appear in the hot area. 

Crack initiation under thermal fatigue is a decreasing function of distance from the 

surface of the solid due to the stress-strain-temperature field generated in superficial areas of 

structural components. Therefore, the driving force that propagates a thermal crack often 

decreases with crack growth, since the farther the crack is from the stress-strain-temperature 

field, the less it is influenced by thermal fatigue and the smaller is its propagation. However, 

in isothermal or thermo-mechanical fatigue testing, in which components are under uniform 

temperature conditions, the crack, when growing toward the interior of the material, reaches a 

more severe stress-strain field, since the cross-sectional area of the component is reduced by 

crack growth (Hetnarski, 1991). 

The design procedure of real components subjected to anisothermal fatigue is quite 

complex and can be basically divided into three steps: 

1. Determination of stress and strain distribution in these components during operation, 

which usually is accomplished with the aid of the finite element method. 

2. Determination of constitutive equations that describe the material mechanical behavior 

for the in service conditions determined above. Whenever possible these equations 

should take into consideration possible changes in material properties during 

operation. 

3. Development of life prediction models (number of cycles to failure), which enables 

the safe use of the component in question by establishing its inspection and 

replacement routines. These models should take into account factors other than 

fatigue, such as creep and oxidation interactions. 

The total strain        measured during an anisothermal fatigue test is the sum of the 

mechanical strain        imposed by the testing equipment and the thermal strain (thermal 



72 

 

expansion or        ) resulting from the change in temperature:                   for 

both in-phase and out-of-phase thermo-mechanical tests (Figure 26b and a, respectively).

(b)

phase (a) and in-phase (b) thermo-mechanical fatigue. 

 

Thermal strain, obviously, does not cause stress and may be determined through the 

following equation: 

                  (9) 

where      is the thermal expansion coefficient,   is temperature and      is room 

temperature. On the other hand, mechanical strain may be decomposed into elastic (   ) and 

inelastic (   ) deformations: 



73 

 

            (10) 

where    is obtained through Hooke’s law: 

          (11) 

where   is the measured stress and      is the elastic modulus in relation to instantaneous 

temperature. In addition,     consists of two distinct components at sufficiently high 

temperatures: plastic deformation (  ), caused by stress higher than the material elasticity 

limit, and creep deformation (   ), due to thermal activation. These are some of the terms 

employed in an anisothermal hysteresis loop, as shown in Figure 27. 

 

 

Figure 27: Example of an out-of-phase anisothermal hysteresis loop (Engler-Pinto Jr., 1996). 

 

Coffin has summarized the basic stress-strain relationship for several heating histories 

and loops, as shown in Figure 28. 

It is possible to see that the hysteresis curve is entirely complex and discontinuous, 

thereby explaining the great difficulty in predicting life under fatigue of components 

operating at high temperatures (Fuchs, 1980). 

Thermal fatigue is seen as an unbalanced repetitive process, i.e., the response from the 

tensile part of the cycle differs from that of the other half (compressive region) and the 

response is a function of temperature. There are three basic aspects of stress-strain behavior 

that are important unbalanced cyclic mechanisms: elasticity, plasticity, and creep (Hetnarski, 

1991). 



74 

 

1. Elasticity - the elastic stress-strain response of a solid is a function of temperature, 

since the elasticity modulus invariably decreases with increasing temperature. Thus, 

an in-phase elastic thermo-mechanical cycle exhibits a nonlinear response since the 

solid is hardened at the lowest temperature of the cycle. The elastic cyclic stress-strain 

response, shown in Figure 29, displays a concave-downward curvature. The cycle 

shown is completely reversed in terms of strain, but not with respect to stress. It may 

be observed that tractive stress is lower than compressive stress, which corresponds to 

the difference between elasticity modulus values at high temperatures. Thus, the 

difference in unbalanced stress is a direct function of temperature range and level 

(Hetnarski, 1991). 

2. Plasticity – if a thermo-mechanical strain is high enough, the material will undergo 

plastic deformation. This results in a tractive stress response in relation to non-linear 

and unbalanced compressive stress (Figure 30). Usually, the elasticity limit decreases 

as temperature increases thereby giving a lower stress response to higher temperatures. 

Plastic and elastic deformation changes in spite of strain being entirely reversed 

(Hetnarski, 1991). 

3. Creep – the maximum stress peak is lower in thermo-mechanical tests with low strain 

rates, in which creep is favored, than in tests with higher strain rates because creep 

decreases material strength (Figure 31). The stress peak response at low temperatures 

is essentially independent from the strain rate. Therefore, half the cycle corresponding 

to the highest temperature becomes more unbalanced as regards half the cycle 

corresponding to the lowest temperature, with decreasing cycling rate and increasing 

maximum cycle temperature, which are factors that favor creep (Hetnarski, 1991).

3.5 Effect of Porosity on Fatigue Life 

 

Porosity has a catastrophic effect on mechanical properties of aluminum alloys. A 1% 

volumetric fraction of pores may reduce fatigue life by 50% and strength limit by 20% as 

compared to the same alloy without pores (Odegard &amp;amp; Pedersen. 1994). 

The number of cycles needed for crack nucleation depends on loading, ranging from 

0% (at startup) to less than 10% of fatigue life (Slallerud &amp;amp; Larsen, 1989), while the time 

needed for crack initiation decreases with pore size. 

Woller curves (Figure 32) for aluminum alloys show that fatigue life increases when 

stress decreases and that for a given stress level the number of cycles to failure decreases 

when amount of gas introduced in the alloy increases (Buffière et al., 2001). The uncertainty 

about fatigue life increases when stress and/or amount of gas decreases. This shows the 

importance of pore quantity and distribution to fatigue life. 

 

 

Figure 32: S-N curves for three aluminum alloys (A, B, and C), with -0.131, -0.168, and -

0.158 slopes (Buffière et al., 2001). 

 

Buffière and colleagues (2001) show that cracks responsible for ruptures nucleate on 

one or more pores located on the surface of specimens or just below it. Except for high stress 

levels, at which cracks nucleate by de-cohesion of internal silicon nodules (far from pores) 

probably located at grain boundaries. It was observed that in the pores responsible for ruptures 

crack nucleation occurs by de-cohesion of the silicon/matrix interface. In most cases this de-

cohesion is produced on a silicon particle near a convex region (a pore) almost perpendicular 



78 

 

to the applied load. It has been noted also that even at low stress levels the number of cycles 

required for crack nucleation is negligible as compared to that of total fatigue life (&lt;2%). 

 

3.6 Life Prediction Models 

 

Suresh (1998) states some approaches have been developed over the years in order to 

predict the total life of engineering materials under fatigue at elevated temperatures. Extensive 

reviews of life prediction models can be found in Coffin (1974), Tomkins and Wareing 

(1977), and Batte (1983). The most common life prediction methods may be classified into 

three groups according to Suresh (1998): (a) damage accumulation models, (b) modified-

frequency Coffin-Manson equations and (c) deformation variation partitioning. A brief 

summary of each method is presented below. 

 

3.6.1 Damage Accumulation Models 

 

The simplest approach to fatigue-creep life prediction involves the linear accumulated 

damage model, as described by Suresh (1998). In this method, the accumulated damage by 

mechanical fatigue and creep are linearly overlaid by means of the following equation: 

 
 
  

 
   (12) 

where  
 
 and  

 
 are fractions of damage fatigue and creep, respectively. 

If the material is subjected to    cycles under     stress variation and the number of cycles to 

fail under this stress is   , the fraction of fatigue damage is       , where summation is 

performed for the total number of stress blocks with different amplitudes. Likewise, if    is the 

average time for an applied average stress    and     is the time to fracture at that level of 

stress, then         indicates the amount of accumulated creep damage. For variable 

amplitude loadings at high temperatures, the damage sum model is rewritten as follows: 

 
  
   

  
  

   
   (13) 

where   is the fraction of damage accumulated, which is usually equal to 1. 

This approach is widely used in low-cycle fatigue tests in dwell periods. However, 

Batte (1983) found at least three problems in implementing the concept of linear damage sum: 



79 

 

i. In periods of permanence under constant strain, stresses relax continuously; 

ii. Cyclic softening and hardening lead to different stress relaxation levels during fatigue 

strain; and 

iii. Rupture stress results, employed in life prediction by means of Equation 12, are 

obtained through monotonic tests, which do not usually represent creep-fatigue 

behavior. 

 

3.6.2  Modified-Frequency Coffin-Manson Equations  

 

The strain-life relationship for modified frequency was proposed by Coffin (1973), 

considering the effect of frequency on cyclic response at high temperatures. This relationship 

incorporates phenomenologically the term frequency (  ) into the Coffin-Manson relationship 

given by Equation 4 as follows: 

           
       (14) 

where the constant    and the exponents   and   are specific to the temperature-material-

environment system. 

The strain-life behavior of many steels is satisfactorily described as an alternative to 

Equation 14, in which the deformation variation is separated into elastic and plastic 

components as in Equation 8: 

                    
                

        (15) 

The employment of Equations 14 and 15 to predict life under fatigue-creep requires 

knowledge of strain-stress loading hysteresis. 

 

3.6.3  Strain-Variation Partitioning Model 

 

The strain-variation partitioning methods proposed by Halford et al. (1973) divide the 

total damage caused by thermo-mechanical fatigue interactions into mechanical elements and 

those dependent on strain-variation time. Suresh (1998) claims that, on a microscopic scale, 

cyclic sliding is considered as the mechanism for time-independent mechanical fatigue, and 

cavitation and sliding of grain boundaries are considered as primary mechanisms affecting 

creep-fatigue damage. Methods of strain-variation partitioning also take into account the 



80 

 

reversal of strain associated with fatigue and creep. In this method, any complete cycle of 

inelastic deformation variation is divided into four components: 

i.     , plastic deformation in reverse strain-stress; 

ii.     , creep deformation in tensile and plastic deformation in compression; 

iii.     , plastic deformation in tension and creep in compression, and 

iv.     , creep deformation in reverse tension-compression. Figure 33 illustrates 

the method of strain-variation partitioning. 

 

 

Figure 33: Schematic representation of inelastic deformation variation partitioned into four 

components, E, P, and C representing elastic, plastic, and creep deformations, respectively 

(Suresh, 1998).  

 

Cyclic strength is associated with the four components of deformation variation by an 

equation of the type of Coffin-Manson potency law: 

            
   

              
   

      (16) 

Figure 34 shows the fatigue-life relationships for strain-variation partitioning. 

The total life is thus determined by the sum of fractions of the four deformation 

modes, as follows: 

 

  
 

 

   
 

 

   
 

 

   
 

 

   
 (17) 

where indices denote the same strain-variation modes. 



81 

 

The damage fractions are sometimes measured in proportion to the deformation-

variation magnitude of every mode. Several empirical modifications of this method are 

available in order to incorporate effects of slow-fast loading fatigue (including effects of 

different stress-strain paths in the cycle) and fatigue-creep dwell time in the estimation of 

fatigue life. 

 

Figure 34: Schematic representation of fatigue-life relationships for the partitioning of 

deformation variation (Suresh, 1998). 

 

3.6.4  Diverse Models 

 

According to Shi et al. (1993), some life-prediction models based on low-cycle 

isothermal fatigue have been employed under thermo-mechanical conditions, such as the 

deformation variation partitioning model, the deformation energy parameter model, the 

constitutive model, and the thermal activation model. These models generally make use of the 

linear damage theory and estimate the damage per cycle in the stabilization period using the 

parameter of damage to plastic deformation or strain energy density. Shi and colleagues 

(1993) and Shi and Pluvinage (1993) investigated the TMF strength of 316L stainless steel 

and proposed firstly a model of nonlinear kinematic hardening using internal variables to 

describe cyclic stress-strain behavior. Then, they established a model to estimate the damage 

to the material from the characteristics of stabilized cycles. From isothermal fatigue data, they 



82 

 

deduced a an equivalent model of variation of strain energy density as damage parameter with 

which TMF life was predicted satisfactory as compared to test results. 

Goals and Ellyin (1988) presented a unified theory based on the criterion of cyclic 

strain energy density. It was shown that fatigue failure under high and low cycle, cumulative 

damage, and loading sequence can be expressed in terms of a single damage parameter. The 

damage criterion is based on the strain energy density per cycle (sum of energy of plastic and 

elastic traction deformation). The stages of initiation and propagation of fatigue cracks were 

incorporated into this model. The comparison to experimental data was satisfactory. 

As indicated by Cai et al. (1999), the two most widely used models to predict life of 

various types of metallic materials subjected to TMF solicitation are models of damage 

accumulation and strain variation partitioning. However, these models must undergo some 

changes in order to satisfy the anisothermal solicitation condition. 

The damage mechanisms present in TMF of various metals involve three main aspects 

involved in anisothermal solicitation: failure caused by fatigue, environment (oxidation), and 

creep. Depending on the temperature, deformation, and phase between the temperature and 

strain cycles, all three mechanisms can operate jointly, according Neu and Sehitoglu (1989b). 

The fatigue damage mechanism controls the life of metals under thermo-mechanical 

solicitation conditions when temperatures are low, so the contribution of oxidation 

mechanisms of creep on life may be neglected, according to Falcão (2002). 

In an out-of-phase TMF test, in which the highest compressive stresses coincide with 

the highest temperatures during the cycle, oxidative damage may be significant whereas creep 

failure is negligible because growth of voids and inter-granular cracking is suppressed under 

compression. In this case, life is determined by oxidation. 

Neu and Sehitoglu (1989a, 1989b) developed a general model for fatigue at elevated 

temperatures, including thermo-mechanical fatigue. This model incorporates accumulated 

damage due to fatigue, environmental attack (oxidation), and creep. The damage per cycle of 

these mechanisms are added up to obtain the total damage per cycle. 

             (18) 

Assuming that linear damage is equal to 1 in the failure, Equation 18 may be rewritten 

in terms of life ( ), in which damage is equal to    : 

 

 
 

 

  
 

 

   
 

 

  
 (19) 



83 

 

According to Cai et al. (1999), due to its complexity, a well-accepted framework for 

predicting TMF life has been rather vague. Several proposed models are but non-isothermal 

generalizations deriving from isothermal models. These models may be divided into two 

types: 

1. General models for predicting life under TMF based on fundamental physical 

mechanisms of crack initiation and propagation under TMF. Such models may 

be used to capture and simulate damage mechanisms and their interactions 

under TMF loading conditions. These models should be based on data about 

several materials, including analyses and micro-structural observations, and 

generally associated with visco-plastic constitutive models. Nevertheless, the 

formulas or set of equations for these models are complex and not convenient 

to engineering application. 

2. Empirical and engineering models have goals and direct applications aimed at 

engineering practice. They are intended for special materials to which the TMF 

life prediction model was established. The formulas of this model are simpler 

and more convenient for applications. However, they are not in common use 

among several materials. 

 

3.6.5  Modeling of Anisothermal Hysteresis as a Function of Isothermal Data 

 

Determining the behavior of anisothermal loading hysteresis using results from 

isothermal stress-strain curves is of great importance to life prediction models in TMF tests. 

Cyclic behavior in low-cycle fatigue can be represented in three ways: (1) by 

analyzing cyclic hardening or softening; (2) through stress-strain hysteresis (mechanical or 

inelastic); or (3) by means of cyclic hardening curves. The difference between the latter two 

methods is that the cyclic hardening curve is represented by extreme stress and strain values 

obtained in several tests superimposed on a single graph. Stress-strain profiles thus obtained 

are not always individual hystereses, obtained during a test conducted within a fixed 

deformation amplitude. 

Typically, cyclic strain hardening curves as well as stress-strain hystereses can be 

represented by a potency relationship, as suggested by Ramberg-Osgood, firstly for a 

monotonic solicitation: 



84 

 

         
  (20) 

This equation may be adapted to cyclic loading: 

  

 
    

    
 

 
 

 (21) 

where    and   are constants of the material, varying with temperature. 

Through interpolation of results obtained isothermally it is possible to determine the 

values of these constants for the temperature range of the anisothermal cycle. 

One of the problems of using an equation such as the Ramberg-Osgood equation to 

simulate an individual hysteresis is that, in the case of cyclic loading, the constants    and   

tend to vary depending on the extent of plastic deformation imposed on the material. For this 

reason, it is unusual to find in the literature the employment of this equation as representing 

hysteresis itself, according Skelton (1994). 

Another complication arising from the use of the Ramberg-Osgood equation is the 

absence of a purely elastic regime, since all applied stresses would result in deformation, 

however small. This gradual transition from elastic regime to plastic regime makes it 

particularly difficult to model the Bauschinger effect, whereby plastic deformation reduces 

the elastic limit in compression and vice-versa. 

Skelton (1994) describes three methods employed to model anisothermal hysteresis: a 

graphical method, a tangent modulus method, and a secant modulus method. The graphical 

method is most used in the literature due to its better suitability. 

 

3.6.6  Graphic Method Modeling 

 

A simplified modeling of isothermal behavior is possible through approximation to 

cyclic behavior by a linear plastic-elastic model, whereby the relationship between strain and 

stress in the plastic regime is given by an equation of the following type: 

                        (22) 

or else: 

                             (23) 

where    is the yield limit,     is the approximate slope of the hardening curve on a inelastic 

stress-strain graph,   is stress and     is inelastic deformation (which is used instead of plastic 

deformation as it is a more suitable denomination for tests at high temperatures). 



85 

 

These two equations define an upper boundary (traction) and a lower boundary 

(compression) of plastic deformation. The material behavior in the area between these two 

equations is purely elastic, governed by Hooke's law: 

              (24) 

where   is the elasticity modulus and   is the total mechanical deformation. 

In this case, the Baushinger effect is automatically taken into account, since the 

vertical distance between the two inelastic equations is fixed and equal to     for any given 

temperature, as shown in Figure 35.

Spinelli, 2002). 

 

Equations for the plastic regime may also be represented in relation to total 

mechanical deformation ( ):

with the aid of the inelastic stress-strain curve. 

According to the model proposed by Engler and Spinelli (2002),    and     are 

determined so as dissipated plastic energy (area under the curve) is the same as that in the 

model proposed by Ramberg-Osgood. 

The elastic limit used in the model proposed by Engler and Spinelli (2002) is 

described by the following equation:

and the scaling constant between   and    : 

           
    

  

   
  (28) 

According to the above equations, the estimation of anisothermal hystereses may be 

done iteratively by dividing the thermo-mechanical (    ) into   periods and estimating the 

inelastic strain and stress for each point. 

The model proposed by Engler and Spinelli (2002) provides a satisfactory 

representation of loading hysteresis behavior for small inelastic deformations. 

 

3.6.7 Thermo-Mechanical Fatigue Modeling for Nucleation of Cracks 

 

The development of numerical simulations in the past 20 years has promoted the 

improvement of numerical tools and the development of new algorithms. It is possible today 

to estimate loads and displacement in structures rapidly and reliably. Nonetheless, studies on 

structures subjected to multi-axial thermo-mechanical loading are still rare. 

Only a small number of automotive components undergo severe cyclic thermo-

mechanical loading capable of producing low-cycle fatigue. Most of these components are 

found in engineering: engine head; engine exhaust; carter; brake disc, and so forth. It is 

important to note that problems caused by low-cycle fatigue to these components are related 

to the startup-shutdown-startup cycle, not to combustion cycles. 

The process of thermo-mechanical fatigue (TMF) is quite complex, involving fracture 

mechanism due to creep and plastic deformation, which tend to be mainly influenced by the 

solicitation type and cyclic changes in the material microstructure of the material in operation, 

such as oxidation and phase transformation (Sermage, 2000; Neu, 1989). Models that attempt 

to predict the life of a component subjected to thermo-mechanical fatigue are scarce, derive 

mostly from isothermal models, are adapted to particular cases, and cannot be generalized to 

other situations (Shi, 1993). Basically, the TMF modeling process should incorporate micro-

structural features (which are responsible for the material mechanical strength within the 

applied temperature range), thermal aspects (analysis on the flow and thermal distribution 

present in the component), mechanical aspects (deformation and fracture mechanisms), and 

geometric aspects (knowledge about stress distribution in the component under solicitation). 

Two types of approach have been used to understand the TMF process: first, at the 



87 

 

microscopic level, by modeling crack initiation and propagation, and secondly, by taking the 

material macroscopic behavior into account. The latter is more widely used and aimed at 

simulating the response given by a material under thermal and mechanical stresses. In this 

case, there have been employed continuum mechanics models as well as elasto-plastic and 

visco-plastic models (Oller, 2005; Constantinescu, 2004; Charkaluk, 2002). 

Predicting the life of a given component subjected to thermo-mechanical loading 

requires the knowledge (mapping) of the distribution of temperatures and stresses in its 

volume (when in operation. In this context, one should begin by conducting a thermal analysis 

on the component, which should simulate the flow of fluids (if present), allowing for heat 

exchanges with the structure, and simulate the cyclic heating and cooling throughout the 

component. The temperature evolution may be determined by the following equation: 

   
  

  
          (29) 

where   is density,   is specific heat, and   is thermal conductivity. 

In order to solve this equation three boundary conditions are need: internal surface, 

external surface, and conduction on contact surface (adjacent components). 

Thermal analysis is considered an important step in TMF modeling, because accuracy 

in temperature-related data requires accuracy when simulating the component mechanical 

behavior (Thomas, 2004). 

The analysis of the behavior of a structure subjected to thermo-mechanical solicitation 

has been conducted, in this case, by means of an elastoviscoplastic model. This type of model 

has proven to be simpler in plotting of stress-strain curves during cycles, because hypotheses 

are assumed that eliminates many variables that would make the problem much more 

complex. Moreover, the elastoviscoplastic model is valid for the component entire operating 

temperature range. The main assumptions in this model are: (a) as the material cyclic behavior 

is stabilized, the initial transient, which can show material hardening or softening under 

solicitation, is disregarded; (b) the damage-related parameters may be overlooked in the 

constitutive law; therefore, there is decoupling in the approach to mechanical behavior with 

damage variables. Below are shown the equations of two elastoviscoplastic models proposed: 

? Classic Visco-plastic Model combined with linear kinematic hardening, according to 

Chaboche (1997). 

    
   

 
  

 

 
       

(30) 

  
 

 

 

 
  



88 

 

     
 

 
 
          

 
 

 
   

       
 

        

            

where:     = elastic deformation tensor,   = Poisson modulus,   = elastic modulus,   = stress 

tensor (hardening),   = strength modulus,     = visco-plastic deformation tensor,   = 

viscosity,   = stress deviation tensor,    = yield stress,   = deformation tensor (hardening), 

   = 2
nd

 stress tensor invariant,  = compliance tensor, and   = viscosity exponent. 

? Two-Layered Visco-plastic Model, in which stress is divided into viscous and 

plastics elements, according to Kichenin (1992). 

    
      

(31) 

    
      

  
 

 

 

 
  

  
   

   

  
   

 

  
        

  
   

   

  
   

 

  
        

    
 

 
 
      

 
 

 
  

      
 

     
    

        
 

       

             

             

          

where:    and    = elastic modulus tensor for plastic and elastic elements, respectively, and 

  = plastic multiplier. 

The material parameters, embedded in the elastoviscoplastic model (e.g., modulus, 

viscosity, and yield stress) may be obtained through mechanical tests of "tension-

compression-relaxation" performed isothermally at different temperatures. In these cases, the 

parameters are assumed to show linear variation with temperature. 

Numerical simulation (EF) is a useful tool for solving equations specified in the 

aforementioned model. The "ABAQUS FINITE ELEMENT STANDARD CODE" program 



89 

 

has been widely used in these cases. Three algorithm types have been tested: forward 

EULER, backward EULER, and backward EULER with a radial return (Simo, 1998), the 

latter producing the best results in less time under anisothermal loading (Charkaluk, 1999). 

After conducting thermal and mechanical analyses, the third step in TMF modeling 

consists of selecting a fatigue criterion. This step has been considered challenging due to the 

anisothermal and multi-axial nature of the solicitations in this case. Two of the fatigue criteria 

are the relationship of a damage function (indicator) and the number of cycles to fail. The 

functions set for classic fatigue criteria (e.g., Manson-Coffin, Smith-Watson-Topper, 

deformation variation partitioning), which include parameters such as total deformation 

amplitude, maximum stress, Young's modulus, and material-dependent constants, have been 

proved inadequate for thermo-mechanical fatigue, mainly due to the difficulty in determining 

these parameters in case of multi-axial thermo-mechanical loading (Constantinescu, 2004; 

Charkaluk, 2002; Thomas, 2004). Therefore, other ways were sought to represent the damage 

function. In this context, energy dissipated per cycle (  ) has been chosen to make this 

representation. The expression that defines    is shown below, being applied (valid) when 

stress-strain cycles are stabilized. 

                     
     

 (32) 

where   and   are stress and strain tensors, respectively, and   indicates the point analyzed in 

the structure. 

The energy dissipated per cycle may be considered a material parameter that expresses 

the energy required for crack propagation in the process zone. There are three advantages to 

using this parameter, according to Thomas (2004): (a) energy quantification can be 

generalized to multi-axial loading situations; (b) its determination is independent of 

temperature; and (c)    is representative of the material cyclic behavior. Regarding the 

number of cycles to fail (  ), it has been proposed that the number of cycles considered 

bordering (         ) is that at which the first (macroscopic) crack is seen in the material, or 

when there is a decrease of about 10% in load (Constantinescu, 2004). Finally, the fatigue 

criterion may be expressed as follows: 

               (33) 

 

3.7 Fatigue Crack Growth 

 



90 

 

In the past, studies on fatigue focused on damage processes and crack development. 

From the 1960s onward interest shifted to crack growth processes (Forsyth, 1963), due to the 

fact that fatigue crack growth does not occur catastrophically (there is sub-critical crack 

growth, which may be halted under certain circumstances) and that crack nucleation occurs in 

a small part of the fatigue life. Cracks are usually formed very early in a material fatigue life 

(Fuchs &amp;amp; Stephens, 1980). 

Thus, the primary characteristic of fatigue failure is the gradual spread of a crack, 

caused primarily by oscillation of loads applied to the component. Geometric cracks are 

defects that resemble slots with very small tip radius, ideally zero. For this reason, it is not 

possible to apply the traditional stress analysis to cracks, because its stress concentration 

factor ( ) is very large. 

However, propagation of fatigue cracks can be effectively dealt by traditional concepts 

of Fracture Mechanics, which show that the propagation rate       or how much a crack 

grows per loading cycle depends primarily on the variation range of the stress intensity factor 

   applied. This became possible thanks to Paris and Erdogan (1963), who related the 

propagation rate of a fatigue crack to the stress intensity factor. By using mathematical tools 

of Fracture Mechanics to quantify the primary characteristic of fatigue failure, the slow 

growth of a crack in every loading cycle, Paris introduced the first truly innovative idea since 

Wöhler, representing an important milestone in the history of research on fatigue. 

This method of analysis, called the Law of Paris, predicts a parabolic relationship 

between       and    (Equation 34) and is suitable to describe the region where crack 

growth rate is linear. 

  

  
         (34) 

where   are   constants dependent on the material, environment, frequency, temperature, and 

stress ratio. 

Exponent   for metallic materials is approximately 4 (four), which may be 

rationalized as accumulated damage and associated with the plastic zone volume (  ), since 

volume    is estimated with   
  and that       

 
, then           . Some   and   

values for several alloys are presented in Table 4.

The typical curves of fatigue crack propagation, when plotted on a graph (Figure 36) 

as            in relation to         , show a characteristic sigmoidal shape with three 

distinct phases: (1) initial phase or Region I, with decreasing derivative; (2) intermediate 

phase or Region II, with constant derivative and linear behavior; and (3) final phase or Region 

III, with increasing derivative. 

 

 

Figure 36: Curve representing       in relation to   . 

 

Therefore, there are three distinct areas or stages (Figure 37), in which the Law of 

Paris and Erdogan is only valid for the intermediate region of crack growth, i.e., Region II. 



92 

 

Region I, with crack propagation rate underestimated by the Law of Paris and 

Erdogan, is characterized by the existence of an inferior limit (   ) below which there is no 

crack propagation or propagation occurs at an undetectable rate for practical purposes. This 

phase is very sensitive to average load, material microstructure, and environment. 

Region III, of unstable crack propagation (typically between 10-8 and 10-6 m/cycle), 

is important to characterize the component final failure, but contributes little to its life under 

fatigue (expressed in number of cycles). This region tends to display static fracture 

mechanisms: ductile mechanisms (e.g., cavitation and void/micro-cavity coalescence) and 

fragile mechanisms (e.g., cleavage), the propagation rate being underestimated by the Law of 

Paris. This curve deviation occurs when      reaches toughness to fracture as      reaches 

values close to those of    and     of the material. 

Region II, or intermediate region of crack growth, the Paris-Erdogan equation 

describes well the growth of a crack with exponent   ranging typically between 2 and 5. 

Crack growth is controlled by continuous mechanisms, insensitive to the microstructure, 

average load, environment, and thickness of components. From the fractographic standpoint, 

it is in this region that stretch marks are observed on the surface characteristic of fatigue. 

 

 

(a) (b) 

Figure 37: Propagation stages of a fatigue crack. 

 

The observation of fatigue fracture surface of ductile materials often reveals the 

presence of grooves perpendicular to the direction of crack propagation (Figure 38a). Laird 

(1967) and Pelloux (1969) were the first to explain the occurrence of these grooves by 

successive crack blunting and sharpening due to plasticity. In order to understand the 

mechanism proposed by Laird one should follow the faces of a crack during a fatigue cycle 

(loading and unloading) (Figure 38b). At the beginning of loading, face displacement is done 



93 

 

by a simple elastic opening. As loading increases, a plastic zone forms in the region ahead of 

the crack. It becomes less acute as the load increases and is accompanied by the creation of 

new surfaces of plasticity. At the beginning of unloading, the crack closes elastically and as 

the distant regions far from it are plastic, at zero load the deformation imposed on the plastic 

zone is zero. Therefore, the crack tip undergoes retained plastic deformation. This 

deformation occurs at the end of the cycle, when the crack is almost closed and cannot make 

up for the plastic deformation that occurred when it was opened. Moreover, due to chemical 

reactions with air, the newly-created free surfaces are irreversible. The crack propagates, thus, 

to a length approximately equal to the rounding radius. In this propagation mechanism, the 

length of a crack derives from a cyclic plastic deformation in the region ahead of it and, 

therefore, the material cyclic plastic behavior plays an important role in propagation. 

 

Plastic blunting   measures deformation at the tip of a crack. Taking into account 

assumptions about displacement fields,   may be understood as a permanent part of CTOD 

(Crack Tip Opening Displacement). It is generally accepted that CTOD is the parameter that 

governs fatigue crack propagation under constant and variable loading (Masahiro, 2004). The 

relationship between CTOD and crack propagation has been the subject of several studies that 

propose propagation scenarios from fractographic observations (Laird, 1967; Pelloux, 1969). 

According to this scenario, it is possible to note that there is a strong link between 

crack length and surface opening. The law that equates these magnitudes is that of CTDO, 

proposed by McClintock (1967), which predicts crack propagation for loading of monotonic 

amplitude. 

  

  
       (35) 

For a material with perfect elasto-plastic behavior,       is given by:

by rounding and sharpening of the crack tip.  



94 

 

        
   

    
 (36) 

where   is a scaling factor,   is the elastic modulus, and    is the yield stress of the material. 

This last equation assumes a relationship between       and plastic zone size. In 

fact, the term     derives from the plastic zone size. Thus, in this case the Paris Law 

exponent is equal to 2 (two). Nebdal and colleagues (1989) proposed an empirical relationship 

between crack advancement and fatigue groove pitch, which is proportional to plastic 

rounding. This relationship was obtained by dividing the measured rate of macroscopic crack 

propagation during the test by the microscopic rate corresponding to the groove pace ( ) 

measured on the fracture surface (Figure 39). 

 

Figure 39: Relationship between groove paces and propagation rate. 

 

The curve obtained comprises three regions corresponding to three Paris curve states. 

In Region A, macroscopic velocity is lower than microscopic velocity, because some cycles 

do not advance the crack (sterile cycles). The crack length in Region B corresponds to 

approximately one groove per cycle; this is the region in which the Law of Paris is valid. In 

Region C, propagation rate is more than one groove per cycle, as other propagation 

mechanisms come into play such as ductile tearing. The proposed relationship (Equations 37 

and 38) in this study for Region B is, thus, based on the relationship of Nebdal et al. (1989), 

but it is a function of time instead of cycle. This formalism allows the handling of cases with 

complex cycles at variable amplitude and can more easily take into account time and 

temperature-related effects on fatigue propagation.

test at constant amplitude. 



95 

 

In order to establish the crack propagation rate at any given load, it suffices to 

determine the evolution of plastic rounding ( ) throughout loading. 

Many empirical rules have been proposed to better describe the sigmoidal shape of the 

curve       in relation to    as well as the effects of some secondary variables, such as 

average load (usually quantified by              ) and crack opening load (   ). The best 

known rules are: 

  

  
             

 
         

 
 Elber (39)

  Hall (41) 

  

  
 

              
 

           
 Forman (modificado) (42) 

All these rules require the determination of constants such as  ,  , or  , which are 

obtained experimentally through fatigue crack propagation tests. Picking one of these rules 

depends on the particular set of data to which one wishes to apply it. In many instances, 

several of them may be used with satisfactory results (Chang &amp;amp; Hudson, 1981). 

 

3.7.1 Effect of Porosity on Fatigue Crack Growth 

 

In most cases, fatigue cracks originate in pores irrespective of stress and deformation 

(Inguanti, 1985; Murali et al., 1997; Powell, 1994; Skallerud et al., 1993); most pores leading 

to cracks are located on the material surface or just below it (Couper et al., 1990; Seniw et al., 

1997; Wigant &amp;amp; Stephens, 1987). After crack nucleation, propagation chronology can be 

divided into four phases: 

- Inter-dendritic crack propagation, alternatively in   matrix and along interfaces of 

silicon/matrix particles (Hoskin et al., 1988; Verdu et al., 1996); 

- Intra-dendritic crack propagation (Powell, 1994) 

- Rapid inter-dendritic crack propagation with damage to silicon particles ahead of 

crack (Crepeau et al., 1992; Plumtree &amp;amp; Schafer, 1986); 

- Final rupture. 



96 

 

When the crack is still small and is in the vicinity of the pore, it is sometimes possible 

to note a decrease or even a halt in propagation with a special frequency of the order of SDAS 

(Evans et al., 1994). 

The crack propagation mechanism may be divided into two distinct regimes 

corresponding to high and low stress levels. At high stress levels cracks propagate 

continuously in the material, i.e., they are not halted by micro-structural barriers and may be 

described by Paris law. At low stress levels, once nucleated, cracks propagate rapidly 

throughout the eutectic region until they reach a length of approximately 10-20?m. Just a 

small amount of these cracks keep on propagating. When this happens, growth is 

discontinuous, with numerous halts and may last several thousand cycles. In the period 

between these halts, growth rate of surface cracks may be higher or lower than that observed 

in long cracks for the same stress intensity factor   . These halts may be related to the 

presence of grain boundaries. 

Topographic observations indicate that 85% of pores located on the material surface or 

right below it nucleate cracks. Figure 40 shows that the probability of crack nucleation from 

pores is neither necessarily related to the stress intensity factor nor to a maximum stress 

criterion.

cycles; for every pore, the effective stress level was measured in relation to the stress intensity 

factor, estimated according to pore dimensions X and Y; (b) definition of X and Y on a pore 

3D diagram. 

 

Finally, it seems that pores smaller than 50µ do not nucleate cracks (Savelli, 2001). 3D 

images show that cracks that do not propagate are smaller than the pores that nucleated them 

(Figure 41).

is indicated in relation to   ; the different symbols indicate whether crack has not spread ( ) 

or has spread ( ); (b) definition of    and   : in black, intersection of pore with specimen 

surface; in gray, 2D projection of 3D shape of pore below the surface (Buffière et al., 2001). 

 

Crack propagation depends on the available distance between the pore border and the 

next favorably orientated grain boundary. If it is shorter than the corresponding pore diameter, 

the crack will not propagate. 

Crack nucleation mechanisms are, therefore, the same for high and low stress levels. 

Applying a cyclic loading is conducive to de-cohesion between silicon particles and the 

matrix, which leads to the development of small cracks. Two factors affecting this de-

cohesion are, on the one side, the plastic and elastic compatibility existing between hard and 

fragile silicon particles and the ductile matrix and, on the other hand, the location of silicon 

particles near convex regions of pores, which act as stress concentrators. Moreover, the grain 

boundaries play an important role due to supplementary plastic incompatibility, induced by it, 

because of its orientation. Crack nucleation at grain boundaries is favored because energy is 

minimized on the surface. Large and inter-granular pores also favor nucleation. 

Indeed, the influence of grain boundaries on crack propagation has been reported in 

the literature for steels and aluminum. The physical processes that explain how a crack goes 

through a grain boundary are not yet clear. A probable mechanism is activation of sources of 

discrepancies in adjacent grains and creation of a new micro-crack by irreversible 

accumulation of discrepancies in the grain. As was observed by Buffière et al. (2001), the 

crack came to a halt in tests in which there was observed the development of plastic zones in 

the vicinity of the grain immediately ahead.

3.8 Brief of Chapter 3 

 

- In the strain-based approach there is low-cycle fatigue that may be characterized as: 

(1) high-strain cycling when the range of inelastic deformation in the cycle exceeds that of 

elastic deformation; and (2) inelastic deformations of such magnitude that they spread 

through the microstructure evenly. 

- An isothermal fatigue test consists of imposing varying mechanical strains at 

constant temperature. 

- Thermo-mechanical fatigue (TMF) describes fatigue under variation of both 

temperature and mechanical strain and may involve several mechanisms that add damage to 

that of "pure" fatigue, including creep and oxidation at elevated temperatures, which directly 

contribute to further damage. These mechanisms differ from each another, depending on 

strain and temperature history. 

- There are three basic aspects of stress-strain behavior that are important unbalanced 

cyclic mechanisms: elasticity, plasticity, and creep. 

- Porosity has a catastrophic effect on mechanical properties of aluminum alloys. A 

1% volumetric fraction of pores may reduce fatigue life by 50% and strength limit by 20% as 

compared to the same alloy without pores and the time needed for crack initiation decreases 

with pore size. 

- Some approaches have been developed over the years in order to predict the total 

life of engineering materials under fatigue at elevated temperatures. 

- Propagation of fatigue cracks can be effectively dealt by traditional concepts of 

Fracture Mechanics. The typical curves of fatigue crack propagation, when plotted on a 

graph as            in relation to         , show a characteristic sigmoidal shape with 

three distinct phases.  

- In most cases, fatigue cracks originate in pores irrespective of stress and 

deformation, most pores leading to cracks are located on the material surface or just below it. 

After crack nucleation, propagation chronology can be divided into four phases: (1) inter-

dendritic crack propagation, alternatively in   matrix and along interfaces of silicon/matrix 

particles; (2) intra-dendritic crack propagation; (3) rapid inter-dendritic crack propagation 

with damage to silicon particles ahead of crack; (4) final rupture.

CHAPTER 4: FINITE ELEMENTS  

 

4.1 Brief History 

 

The idea behind the finite element method is not attributed to a single person or group 

of people from the same historical period. Over two thousand years, Greek philosophers 

developed theories which assumed that all things were composed of countless particles. So set 

Leucippus and Democritus that everything was made by an infinitely large number of 

particles, called atoms by the latter. Eudoxus, creator of the "exhaustion method", which 

consists of inscribing and circumscribing rectilinear figures into curvilinear figures, already 

proposed syncretizing a continuous figure to facilitate certain calculations. This method 

allowed the calculation of areas of curved figures and volumes of solids such as spheres and 

cones. It is equivalent to passing to the limit of integral and differential calculus. 

More recently, in the 1930s, McHenry (1943) and Hrennikoff (1941) replaced a 

continuous element, e.g., a plate, for a structure formed by bars following the original 

geometry, maintaining the same binding conditions and loads. 

Despite taking into consideration a continuous medium discretized by elements with 

known stiffness and elasticity, these methods, which have given rise to matrix analysis, do not 

present the conceptual aspect implicit in the finite element method. 

Not only does it transform a continuous solid into a combination of discrete elements 

and write equations of compatibility and balance between them, but it also admits continuous 

functions that represent, for instance, the displacement field in the domain of an element and, 

subsequently, obtains the corresponding deformation condition, which, together with the 

material constitutive relationships, allows the definition of the stress condition in the entire 

element. 

This stress condition is transformed into internal efforts, which have to be in balance 

with external actions. 

This formulation derives from the Rayleigh-Ritz method, which is based on 

minimizing the total potential energy of the system, expressed in relation to the pre-

established displacement field (displacement method). 

A renowned mathematician, Courant (1943), applied this procedure to the study of 

Saint-Venant torsion of hollow sections. 

Argyris and Kelsey (1964) published a series of papers in the mid-1950s, in which the 

matrix formulation of the Rayleigh-Ritz method was categorically determined and has been 



101 

 

applied to analyze especially aircraft wings and fuselage, simulating them as consisting of 

bars and panels. 

The finite element method had its formula established as it is presently known with the 

publication of the study of Turner and colleagues (1956). They showed that it was possible to 

replace the properties of the continuum in a more direct, not less intuitive way, assuming that 

small portions (elements) behave in a simplified fashion. 

Clough (1980), author of the term (method of finite elements in opposition to 

infinitesimal elements of differential calculus), describes in details his involvement in the 

development of this method in a paper published in 1980. 

Despite its formulation having been known since the 1950s, the finite element method 

became disseminated and applied in various fields of engineering due to the rapid 

development and expansion of computers. 

Today, there are hundreds of commercial computer programs currently used in various 

areas of knowledge, which employ this method in linear and nonlinear analysis. 

The finite element method is now well-established in engineering so that its 

knowledge is essential to be able to intelligibly work with commercial software programs 

existing in almost all project management firms (Assan, 2003). 

 

4.2 Finite Element Method 

 

Numerical simulation is one of the stages to be developed in order to design a 

component (Figure 42). The component should be analyzed in light of strength criteria, the 

classic fatigue theory, and the finite element method. 

In order to predict the performance of mechanical components, a designer has at hand 

today a series of mathematical tools that can be applied. Analytical solutions may be used in 

certain cases, but its application is limited to specific situations where a mathematical solution 

of the structure can be found. A more comprehensive way of dealing with structural problems 

is the use of numerical analysis methods. Although these methods provide approximate 

solutions, in many cases they are the only way designers have to find the answers they are 

seeking. 

The Finite Element Method (FEM) takes into consideration the region of problem 

solution as consisting of small interconnected elements. The region under study is analytically 

modeled or estimated by a set of pre-defined discreet elements. Once these elements are 

placed together in a countless number of different configurations, it is possible to model very 



102 

 

complex geometrical forms. Moreover, it provides designers with a great deal of flexibility in 

the application of loads and boundary conditions, which makes FEM the most widely 

employed method in structural analysis nowadays. 

FEM is suitable to a wide range of problems of boundary values in engineering. In a 

boundary value problem, a solution is sought in the body region (domain) whereas in the 

boundaries of this region the values of dependent variables (or their derivatives) are known.

103 

 

 

According to Huebner (1994), the method may be summarized into three stages: 

1. Pre-processing: the preparation stage of the problem to be solved later. It is in this 

stage that the phenomenon is modeled, assuming hypotheses, initial conditions, 

boundary conditions, and loadings. It also includes selecting the element, material 

properties, and geometry that will represent the shape of the component in question. 

The following are two important preprocessing sub-stages: 

? Continuum discretization: the continuum is the physical body shown in Figure 

43, structure or solid under analysis. The discretization viewed in Figure 44 

can be simply described as the process by which the domain is subdivided into 

an equivalent system of finite elements, which can be, for instance, triangles or 

quadrangles for 2D problems or tetrahedrons and hexahedrons for 3D 

problems. These elements have the so-called nodes, which can be internal or 

external, i.e., located in the interior of the element or at its edges. Although 

there have been attempts to automate the process of domain subdivision, it 

remains essentially dependent on engineers’ discrimination and expertise; 

? Selection of interpolation functions: the assumed displacement or interpolation 

functions represent only approximately the exact or actual distribution of 

displacements. Generally, the form adopted for the interpolation functions is 

the polynomial, due to its requiring simple mathematical manipulation. There 

are three interrelated factors influencing the selection of interpolation 

functions: choice of type and degree of function (as the type usually adopted is 

the polynomial, only the degree should be selected) and the type of field 

variables that describe the model (usually, displacements at the nodes or their 

derivatives). Finally, the model must meet certain requirements to ensure that 

numerical results come close to the correct solution;

2. Solver: the solution of the problem has as its starting point the model set during the 

previous stage. Therefore, the accuracy of responses depends critically on the 

researcher’s ability to take apart the phenomenon. The solution is based on a 

numerical algorithm aimed at solving as quickly and accurately as possible a 

differential equation with boundary conditions and/or initial conditions imposed by the 

model. Following are some sub-stages to solve the problem: 

? Obtaining the elemental stiffness matrix: the stiffness matrix consists of 

coefficients of equilibrium equations derived from geometric and material 

properties of an element and can be obtained by using the principle of 



105 

 

minimum potential energy. Stiffness relates nodal displacements to forces 

applied at the nodes. The equilibrium relationship between the stiffness matrix 

   , the nodal force vector    , and the nodal displacement vector     is 

expressed as a set of simultaneous linear algebraic equations,            . 

The stiffness matrix of an element depends on the interpolation function, 

element geometry, and local properties of the material; 

? Assembly of algebraic equations for the entire domain: the process includes 

assembling the global stiffness matrix for the whole body from elementary 

stiffness matrixes and the global force vector from elemental force vectors. In 

general, the basis for an assembly method is the requirement of nodal 

interconnections. Displacements at a node must be the same for all adjacent 

elements; 

? Solutions for unknown displacements: algebraic equations assembled in the 

previous step are solved for unknown displacements. In linear problems, this is 

a relatively straightforward application of matrix algebra techniques. However, 

for nonlinear problems, the desired solutions are obtained by a sequence of 

steps, each involving the modification of stiffness matrix and/or strength 

vector; 

? Calculation of elemental strains and stresses from nodal displacements: in 

some cases, nodal displacements are the variables under study for the solution. 

Often, however, other quantities derived from unknown variables such as 

stresses and strains must be estimated. In general, stress and strain are 

proportional to the derivatives of displacements. 

It is important to remark that these numerical algorithms may be implemented 

computationally to accelerate calculation. Nowadays, it is possible to find 

computational packages such as ANSYS, NASTRAN, ABAQUS and others, 

each program having advantages and disadvantages to problem modeling. 

3. Post-processing: it is the last stage. It depends only on the researcher’s modeling 

needs, i.e., it is the solution to the differential equation that describes the phenomenon 

under study as shown in Figure 45. It may be: 

? Nodal displacements; 

? Geometry deformations; 



106 

 

? Stress gradients according to selected strength criterion; 

? Temperature gradients; 

? Nodal displacements over time; 

 

 

Figure 45: Typical post-processing stage of a commercial package. 

 

These features, implemented computationally, allow the estimation of the solution to a 

complex problem in a relatively short time, optimizing the development time for projects of 

anisotropic or isotropic materials subjected to static, thermal, and dynamic loadings, and so 

forth. 

 

4.3 Behavior Model 

 

There are two classic models of material behavior: 

? The first, purely phenomenological, is at a macroscopic scale, i.e., it operates 

through global variables (e.g., stress, strain, and internal variables). This 

approach allows the modeling of experimental phenomena with a limited 

number of variables, thus engendering a lack of physical basis. 



107 

 

? The second, known as micro-macro, is at a microscopic scale and seeks to 

predict the macroscopic response by changing scales from physical parameters 

such as density and movement of discrepancies, nucleation and propagation 

phenomena, and the distance between precipitates. The problem with this type 

of application is that the number of steps between the microscopic mechanisms 

and macroscopic response is very large, which usually complicates the 

construction of complete models for industrial alloys, and that most authors use 

it only to predict yield stress (Gandin et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2003). 

 

4.4 Presentation of Proposed Crack Growth Model 

 

The first elements of this model were developed in a study on crack propagation in 

turbine disc carried out by Pommier and Risbet (2005). The model was subsequently 

identified, implemented, and validated for fatigue crack propagation in steel employed in train 

wheels at room temperature by Hamam and Pommer (2007). The incremental crack 

propagation model is composed of two parts: 

? A propagation law that provides the instantaneous speed of creating the cracked 

area per length of the crack front in relation to the instantaneous speed of plastic 

rounding of the crack. This first part of the model is identified by using a test of 

fatigue crack propagation at constant amplitude. 

? A plastic rounding law that allows the determination of the global speed of 

plastic deformation in the crack front region in relation to applied load and 

internal variables of the model. These internal variables define in a 

comprehensive way the condition of residual stresses and material hardening in 

the plastic zone. This second part of the model is identified by using finite 

element calculations and requires identification of the material cyclic elastic-

plastic behavior. 

Thus, fatigue damage modeling is decoupled from plasticization modeling in the crack 

front region. This decoupling is possible due to the fact that the characteristic dimension of 

the damaged area is much inferior to that of the plasticized zone. The plasticized zone 

dimension is comparable to the size of fatigue grooves (in the order of micrometers) or to the 

size of grains. Hence, this hypothesis is valid as long as the plastic zone dimension is larger 

than 100µm. 



108 

 

Otherwise, FEM is only employed to establish the global cyclic plastic model of the 

crack front region. The approach used to establish this method—the plastic rounding law—is 

as follows: 

Good finite element calculations enable to estimate the evolution of stresses and 

strains at each point in the crack front region. Taking the behavior peculiarities of the material 

into account by its behavior law, which comprises at least one isotropic hardening and one 

nonlinear kinematic hardening. 

Next, a scale-changing method is applied to identify, from finite element simulation, a 

simplified model of cyclic elastic-plastic behavior in the region ahead of the crack on a global 

scale. The scale-change principle is simple, it is based on an approximation of the kinematics 

at the crack tip. In Mode I, the displacement field at the crack tip is assumed to decompose 

into an elastic part and a plastic part. It is assumed, for both parts, that they are the result of an 

intensity factor (a function of boundary conditions and crack geometry) and a reference field 

(a function of space coordinates only). 

The study of plasticity at the global scale for the region ahead of the crack is done by 

investigating the intensity factor evolution of the plastic part of the displacement (plastic 

rounding) field, identified by   . 

The evolution of plastic rounding (  ), estimated by means of finite elements, allows 

the establishment of a simplified model of global cyclic elastic-plastic behavior for the crack 

front region, i.e., a model that enables to calculate        in relation to applied nominal 

loading        from a set of partial differential equations. 

Otherwise, a crack propagation law is introduced to provide the instantaneous speed of 

creation of cracked area per unit of crack tip length       in relation to the instantaneous 

speed of plastic rounding       . 

The set enables subsequently to calculate the propagation speed of fatigue cracks for 

complex loadings taking the effects of the loading history into account. 

Several aspects of this approach are detailed below. In the context of this text, the 

sensitivity of this approach with respect to the material behavior law was investigated for a 

gravity-cast aluminum-silicon alloy, employed in the manufacture of automotive engine 

heads. 

 



109 

 

4.4.1 Study of Displacement Field at Crack Tip 

 

Hypothesis of Displacement Field Projection 

 

Let          be a point in a local coordinate system fixed in a normal section in the 

region ahead of a crack (Figure 46). As the load applied to the crack is known, a simplified 

form of displacement of this point is then sought. The goal here is to reduce the number of 

freedom degrees of the problem so that simulation does not result in high calculation times, 

considering that industrial problems require quick and satisfactory responses. 

 

 

Figure 46: Coordinate system around the crack. 

 

The rupture linear mechanics provides displacement fields in the crack tip region by 

asymptotic development in view of the distance   to this tip. The first term of this 

development is expressed as the product of the stress intensity factor, varying over time, and a 

reference field solely dependent on the point coordinates with respect to the crack tip. Hence, 

at first just the stress intensity factor    is useful to characterize loading at the crack tip. The 

crack propagation criteria are, thus, be described as a direct function of   , which becomes the 

only freedom degree of the problem. 



110 

 

In the cyclic elastic-plastic context, the displacement field in the crack tip region is 

expressed as: 

                     

 

 (45) 

where        is a basis of the reference spatial field and       are the problem temporal 

parameters. These temporal parameters constitute the freedom degrees of the problem on 

global scale and, thus, may be applied to the crack propagation criterion. 

At first, FEM was employed to calculate displacement fields            in the cyclic 

elastic-plastic context. Then, these calculated fields are treated in order to justify the approach 

chosen and the problem temporal parameters are calculated. 

 

Methodology  

 

The displacement field sought is, therefore, assumed to be decomposed into a basis set 

to the reference site at each point of the crack front, composed of two reference fields: an 

"elastic" field       and a "plastic" field      . This partitioning has the advantage of 

reducing to two the number of the problem freedom degrees. The two freedom degrees 

constitute the intensities of the reference fields: stress intensity factor     , pre-factor of the 

elastic field      , and plastic blunting ?, pre-factor of the plastic field      : 

          
             (46) 

Numerical solutions may be employed in both fields, but they can also be expressed 

analytically. In fact, the Karhunen-Loeve decomposition is interesting because it can be 

performed without having a priori the solution sought, but it is very costly in terms of 

calculation time. It is simpler, therefore, to provide an analytical expression for the 

displacement field at the crack tip and then employ the minimum squares method to 

determine temporal coefficients from the results of a FEM calculation. Furthermore, giving an 

analytical expression for the reference field entails the interpretation of the results. 

It is possible, for instance, to choose Westergaard analytical solution for the reference 

elastic field, for the stress intensity factor. The analytical expression of the displacement field 

around a crack tip in Mode I can then be given by: 

        
 

 
 

 

  
   

 

 
 
   

 
     

 

 
  (47) 



111 

 

        
 

 
 

 

  
   

 

 
 
   

 
     

 

 
  (48) 

with:        and          

Moreover, the plastic displacement field       retained is the wedge-shaped one, 

placed in a horizontal direction below the crack plane. Under this assumption, Equations 49 

and 50, the normal displacement of surfaces of the crack     is constant and equal to 1. So 

the pre-factor   of this field can be interpreted as plastic crack blunting or CTOD (crack tip 

opening displacement). 

  
 
      

 

      
            

  

  
  (49) 

  
 
      

 

      
                   (50) 

In practice, during post-processing of FE calculations, the numerical solution of a finite 

element calculation previously done on the same mesh is used for the field       and 

Equations 49 and 50 for the field      . 

 

4.4.2 Model Evolution Equation  

 

The applied approach is concisely as follows. First, a local approximation is employed 

to calculate in detail, by finite elements, the evolution of stresses and strains in the region of 

the crack tip due to the material behavior and applied load. Then, one goes from local to 

global scale by applying the approach under the aforementioned displacement. In general, it is 

possible to obtain the temporal evolution of plastic blunting, for every finite element 

calculation. Associated with this development is a model of behavior of the material that will 

be employed to simulate cyclic plasticity in the crack tip region. Finally, it is necessary to 

have a crack propagation law that can relate crack propagation speed to plastic blunting speed 

in order to calculate fatigue life. 

 

Plastic Blunting Law  

 

Plastic blunting of crack faces is calculated by FEM, supported by a simplified 

representation of the displacement field in the crack front region. An experimental rounding 

determination was possible today thanks to novel experimental media employed to measure 



112 

 

the displacement field, such as image correlation. This experimental technique is more 

laborious than FEM calculation and enables to characterize the evolution law of   only on the 

surface. Moreover, although this technique has the advantage of not being dependent on the 

chosen material behavior, it does not allow the separate study of the evolution of model 

variables in relation to   and  , i.e., the crack advances without the occurrence of plastic 

rounding  or plastic rounding occurs without the plastic crack advancing. 

This study employed FEM, but it is interesting to use image correlation in future 

studies at least to validate numerical calculations. Figure 48 shows the evolution of plastic 

rounding obtained by FEM in relation to intensity factor of the stress applied to an increasing 

charge-discharge succession. This was achieved by applying the projection defined above. 

This ensured that the plastic zone in the front crack was confined to the   dominance region. 

The evolution curves of plastic rounding   show that after every inversion in loading 

direction (from tractive to compressive and vice-versa) there is a region    
  during which 

  does not vary (Region C). As   measures plasticity at the crack tip, this region may be 

defined as the critical cyclic domain of the crack. It is possible to note that this domain can 

shift throughout solicitation. Hence, it is associated with an internal variable such as linear 

kinematic hardening, i.e., one that defines the position (    ) of this domain. A second 

variable is also introduced to define its dimension, which is generally constant. 

Likewise, it is possible to note a discontinuity in the evolution curve during tractive 

loading. This discontinuity appears when the applied load exceeds the maximum load 

previously reached (D). This rupture in slope corresponds to the loading point beyond which 

the monotonic plastic zone at the crack tip extends. Point D is, thus, the limit of the crack 

monotonic plasticity domain (Region M). The lower limit of the monotonic plastic zone 

corresponds to the point where surfaces meet. Below this contact point, plastic rounding no 

longer evolves. It stops evolving even if compression continues, because the crack is closed. 

Moreover, the proposed projection has no effect now and, therefore, is not performed. Again, 

two internal variables are brought into the elasticity field, one for position     , which is 

taken as the contact point, and another for its size, which is usually variable (Figure 47). 

 



113 

 

 

Figure 47. Evolution of plastic rounding in relation to applied stress intensity factor. 

 

The rounding model describes, with the help of a set of analytical equations, the 

evolution laws of each of these internal variables as well as of   in relation to applied load 

and the current value of these variables. It is important to note that the internal variables      

may vary as the crack tip region deforms plastically          , but also because the tip of the 

crack moves         . To determine these laws of evolution, several calculations are 

performed from the start of crack propagation. Previous works have established simple 

evolution laws for each of the variables and defined a strategy to identify parameters of these 

laws. The main equations of these laws are presented below. In all cases, the following 

relationship between the nominal stress intensity factor and the thermodynamic force   

associated with  :

Indeed, as    and    are related through the crack propagation law, the same rule may 

be employed to relate the contact point position, known as    , which is determined by the 



114 

 

nominal stress intensity factor, to the internal variable    , associated with the center 

position of the monotonic elasticity domain. In short, the model is written as follows:

? Initial values:      
           

 

The material parameters are identified automatically with the help of the minimum 

squares method and supported by a set of finite elements calculations. The term     

represents the point of contact between two crack faces and the elasticity domain dimension 

associated with the monotonic plastic zone. If the limit      is reached, the monotonic 

plastic zone increases in size.

Implementation Method 

 

The algorithm to calculate the incremental model is shown in Figure 48, numerical 

integrations of the plastic rounding law and crack propagation law were done separately in 

two stages. From the evolution of the applied tension field, the loading variation increment 

    is derived for every time increment, the present crack length being known   . The 

resolution of the plastic rounding law equations enables the deduction of the resulting plastic 

rounding increment     as well as the evolution of internal variables     ,    ,     , and 

   . The new crack length is subsequently determined from the crack propagation law and 

the internal variables are updated in relation to  .

The purpose of decoupling the crack propagation law from that of plastic rounding is 

to facilitate numerical implementation. In addition, it represents a considerable advantage as 

regards time. This two-stage resolution does not affect the propagation calculation results 

because internal variables evolve rapidly in relation to plastic rounding (few dozen microns). 

However, their evolution is much slower with crack growth (few hundred microns). Hence, 

the scale of a fatigue cycle, the update of internal variables in relation to   can be performed 

at the end of a calculation increment and not in real time, for crack advancement does not 

interfere significantly with variables. 

Numerical integration of differential equations of the plastic rounding law is done 

initially by implicit integration, the calculation time required for this type of resolution being 

in the order of few dozen minutes to simulate one million cycles in two dimensions. 

Calculation time is the same for variable and constant amplitude loadings since in both cases 

calculation is done incrementally. Moreover, these calculation times are not prohibitive. 

However, calculation time increases rapidly when the model is applied to a 3D problem and 

has to calculate the advance of the crack at various points in the crack front region for every 

increment. A method of integration by parts validated by making some suppositions with the 

aim of reducing calculation time is presented in Annex 1. 

In short, at the beginning of each calculation increment, the borders of cyclic and 

monotonic plasticity are known. For a loading increment   , the equations to be integrated 

depend on the level of applied loading    and the present state of the crack 

                             . 

- If    and    are below the point of contact (Figure 49a), there is no equation 

to integrate; 

- If    and    are in the interior of the cyclic plastic zone (Figure 49b), there is 

no equation to integrate;

4.5 Brief of Chapter 4 

 

- Numerical simulation is one of the stages to be developed in order to design a 

component. The component should be analyzed in light of strength criteria, the classic 

fatigue theory, and the finite element method. 

- FEM is suitable to a wide range of problems of boundary values in engineering and 

this method may be summarized into three stages: (1) pre-processing, (2) solver and (3) post-

processing. 

- There are two classic models of material behavior: The first, purely 

phenomenological, is at a macroscopic scale, i.e., it operates through global variables (e.g., 

stress, strain, and internal variables); and The second, known as micro-macro, is at a 

microscopic scale and seeks to predict the macroscopic response by changing scales from 

physical parameters such as density and movement of discrepancies, nucleation and 

propagation phenomena, and the distance between precipitates. 

- The incremental crack propagation model is composed of two parts: (1) a 

propagation law that provides the instantaneous speed of creating the cracked area per length 

of the crack front in relation to the instantaneous speed of plastic rounding of the crack. This 

first part of the model is identified by using a test of fatigue crack propagation at constant 

amplitude; and (2) a plastic rounding law that allows the determination of the global speed of 

plastic deformation in the crack front region in relation to applied load and internal variables 

of the model. These internal variables define in a comprehensive way the condition of 

residual stresses and material hardening in the plastic zone. This second part of the model is 

identified by using finite element calculations and requires identification of the material 

cyclic elastic-plastic behavior.

CHAPTER 5: METHODOLOGY  

 

5.1 Experimental Procedures 

 

5.1.1 Materials 

 

This study employed an aluminum-silica alloy (A356), whose chemical composition is 

presented in Table 5. The main characteristics of this alloy are good mechanical strength, high 

resistance to corrosion, thermal treatability, and weldability. The material was cast in 

permanent mold (PMC). In addition, material was obtained from the component itself (engine 

head).

5.1.2 Manufacturing Process 

 

Permanent Mold Cast 

 

The permanent cast standardized according to ASTM B108-08 (2008) was employed 

to obtain two cylindrical strain specimens cast by gravity (12.5mm diameter). The mold 

design included feeding and distribution channels and heads, which produced specimens with 

microstructure presenting a very low quantity of defects. The PMC process included 

degasification, refining, and modification of silica particles. Figure 50 shows the complete 

cast obtained in this fashion.

123 

 

For tensile, isothermal, and anisothermal fatigue tests, specimens were obtained from 

the central PMC region (Figure 52a) whereas, for relaxation and crack propagation tests under 

isothermal and anisothermal loading conditions, they were obtained from the component 

(engine head) (Figure 52b). After machining, the specimens were sanded with 320, 600, and 

1200-grit sandpaper and then polished with 10µm chromium oxide down to a mirror finish. 

Due to the low emissivity coefficient1 of polished aluminum, the usable area of specimens 

received a coating of matte black paint (heat resistant up to 600°C) prior to testing at elevated 

temperatures in order to facilitate infrared pyrometer reading.

5.1.4 Mechanical Test System 

 

The mechanical testing system was part of LAPROMEC equipment (Laboratory of 

Mechanical Properties of the Department of Materials, Aeronautical, and Automotive

Engineering) at São Carlos campus of São Paulo University (USP). The testing equipment 

consisted basically of an induction heating system coupled to an MTS 810 testing machine, in 

which a microcomputer connected to the system monitored and controlled specimen 

temperature and deformation during tests through an infrared pyrometer and a ceramic rod 

extensometer, respectively. 

 

Heating System 

 

The heating system consisted of an INDUCTOHEAT induction furnace (7.5 kW 

power and 200 kHz frequency), equipped with a CNT110 INCON programmable temperature 

controller. The furnace had a coupled inductor coil made of copper (5 mm diameter), specially 

designed to envelope the specimen, heating it uniformly, and allow the extensometer rods to 

pass in between the coils. 

 

Infrared Pyrometer 

 

Specimen temperature was measured by means of an infrared pyrometer with laser 

sight (RAYTEK, Thermalert SX series, D9ETXSLTCF1L2 model) for temperatures ranging 

from -18°C to 500°C. The temperature measured by this sensor served as a control parameter 

for the induction furnace and data acquisition system of the testing program. Fatigue tests 

above room temperature require precise temperature measurements in the central region of 

specimens, without physical contact, thereby avoiding problems such as crack initiation due to 

thermocouples welding. 

 

Testing Machine 

 

Tensile, isothermal and anisothermal fatigue, crack propagation, and relaxation tests 

were performed in an MTS 810 250kN servo-hydraulic testing machine, equipped with an 

MTS Flex Test GT controller. Fatigue and relaxation tests were done under strain control, 

using an MTS 632.54F14 model extensometer for high temperatures, consisting of two 2-mm 

diameter ceramic rods attached to the specimen by a coil system. Tensile tests under 

displacement control also employed this extensometer. Crack propagation tests were 

conducted under load and displacement control for cyclic and no-dwell loadings. All tests 

used an MTS 680.01B model system of hydraulic grips for high temperatures and a grip 

cooling system. Figure 53 presents an overview of the testing system. Figure 54 shows the 



125 

 

system of grips, infrared pyrometer, and extensometer for fatigue tests. Figure 55 shows the 

specimen details, induction coil and grip cooling system. The auxiliary grip cooling system 

for fatigue tests at high temperatures is composed of two coils made with copper pipes, 

through which chilled water circulates, and two compressed air hoses coupled to the ends of 

the upper and lower grips.

Control and Monitoring System 

 

Each type of mechanical test required a different MultiPurpose TestWare (MPT) 

software program for the MTS Flex Test GT controller as well as PID adjustment in order to 

achieve better equipment performance and, consequently, reliable data. Crack propagation 

tests employed a potential drop method (MDP), in which control was performed through a 

nano-voltmeter and a DC source connected to the MTS controller. For tests at high

5.1.5 Tensile Tests 

 

Tensile tests were performed at room temperature, 120°C, and 280°C according to 

ASTM E21 and ASTM E8/E8M-09-09, under displacement control at 0.003 mm/s piston 

displacement speed, using the MTS-MPT program. Tensile tests were conducted in this work 

mainly to obtain important properties of the alloy in question, e.g., yield strength and 

elasticity modulus, which are useful for calculating deformations measured in thermo-

mechanical fatigue tests and to make appropriate parameters available for the finite element 

model. The tensile test specimen geometry is shown in Figure 57. 

 

 
Figure 57: Tensile test specimen for different temperatures. 

 

5.1.6 Isothermal and Anisothermal Fatigue Testing 

 

Fatigue tests were performed under controlled strain. All tests were performed at 

mechanical deformation ratio      . The failure criterion used was a 50% drop of the 

maximum stress reached during the experiment. Isothermal tests employed 0.1Hz frequency 

in order to come near the maximum frequency used in anisothermal fatigue tests, whose 

periods are relatively long (about 300s) owing to difficulty in cooling specimens down. 

However, this type of test is usually conducted over long periods in order to avoid excessive 

temperature gradients in specimens during heating and cooling. In addition, temperatures in 

anisothermal tests were imposed by a triangular wave with maximum cycle temperature 

coinciding with maximum mechanical deformation (in phase) according to initial ASTM 

E2368-10 guidelines. Isothermal or low-cycle fatigue tests at high temperatures were 

performed according to ASTM E 606-04
?1

. 

The alloy mechanical behavior was assessed through cyclic hysteresis of inelastic and 

mechanical strain-stress and progression of some testing parameters in relation to number of 



129 

 

cycles, e.g., maximum and minimum inelastic strains and stresses as well as total inelastic 

deformation energy and Ostergren energy (tensile deformation energy of hysteresis) for 

mechanical strain levels representing overall behavior. Anisothermal fatigue tests were 

conducted under in-phase conditions, i.e., maximum mechanical deformation coinciding with 

maximum cycle temperature. 

Isothermal and anisothermal fatigue lifetime results were assessed by means of 

mechanical variation (   ), inelastic deformation (    ), stress (  ), total deformation 

energy, and Ostergren energy in relation to number of cycles to fail (  ). 

The specimen geometry commonly employed in isothermal and anisothermal fatigue 

tests is shown in Figure 58. 

 

Figure 58: Geometry of fatigue test specimens. 

 

Cyclic hardening curves (  as a function of  ) were determined for different 

temperatures. The method chosen for obtaining the cyclic hardening curve is the gradual 

increase in strain applied to the specimen, producing a stable hysteresis for each strain level 

used (an anisothermal example is given in Figure 59). The effect of strain rate (     ) on 

hysteresis shape was also investigated by varying the test frequency. 

Among other factors, the material behavior depends on the gap between      and      

cycles or, put differently, on the chosen shape of cycle     . In fact, through a TMF (thermo-

mechanical fatigue) test, it is possible to simulate the behavior of any volume element from a 

real component as long as the thermo-mechanical load (    ), which the volume element is 

subjected to during operation, is known.

Cycle shape traditionally employed in the study of thermo-mechanical fatigue are in-

phase, i.e., maximum mechanical deformation coinciding with maximum cycle temperature 

(Figure 60a), and out-of-phase, minimum mechanical deformation coinciding with maximum 

cycle temperature (Figure 60a).

Thermo-mechanical fatigue testing is also very useful in identifying damage and 

fracture mechanisms of materials submitted to anisothermal solicitations. At the end of cyclic 

hardening tests, the specimens were sectioned and metallographically prepared for 

examination under optical and scanner microscopes. These observations enabled the detection 

of occasional micro-structural changes due to exposition to test temperatures as well as the 

identification of sites favoring crack nucleation under isothermal and anisothermal conditions. 

 

5.1.7 Crack Growth Tests 

 

Crack propagation tests were conducted at 120°C, 200°C, and 280°C on a corner notch 

of specimens designed in accordance with the component geometry (Figure 51 and Figure

52b). The loading rate employed was          and cracks were monitored by means of the 

potential drop method. Crack propagation tests under thermo-mechanical loading conditions 

were attempted during approximately 1 (one) year, but to no avail, despite much effort. 

 

5.1.8 Micro Structural and Fracture Analysis 

 

Micro-structural observation of the aluminum alloy was done under an optical 

microscope. A quantitative image analysis software program (Image Pro Plus) was employed 

to determine size and morphology of phase ?, eutectic distribution, and porosity level.  

The morphological aspect of fracture surfaces of some specimens tested for isothermal 

and anisothermal fatigue and crack propagation was analyzed by scanning electron 

microscopy (SEM). 

 

5.2 Computational Procedures 

 

5.2.1 First Step 

 

This step comprised the adaptation to a computational modeling software program 

existing on the market. The chosen program was ABAQUS STANDARD FINITE 

ELEMENT CODE, due to its simplicity in testing new models and algorithms, e.g., forward 

EULER, backward EULER, and backward EULER with a radial return. The last one presents 

the best and fastest results under anisothermal loading conditions, according to Charkaluk 

(1999).  

 

5.2.2 Second Step 

 

It consisted of improving the model of crack propagation developed by Professor 

Sylvie Pommier in the Laboratoire de Mécanique et Technologie (LMT) at L’École Normale 

Supérieure de Cachan (ENS-Cachan-France) for loading applied to a real component (engine 

head), i.e., under anisothermal conditions, given that a component can operate in the presence 

of cracks as long as they do not reach a critical size conducive to catastrophic failure. 

 



132 

 

5.2.3 Third Step 

 

This step consisted of a computational implementation of the improved mathematical 

model. To this end, FORTRAN and PYTHON, whose written code would become part of an 

ABAQUS subroutine, was employed. Then, the model was evaluated by using test data 

obtained from strain, fatigue, and crack propagation specimens. 

 

5.2.4 Fourth Step 

 

In future studies, this step will comprise the application of the model developed and 

validated on specimens to real components in operation. To this end, it will be of fundamental 

importance to map temperatures and stresses to which the component is subject in operation. 

This step will count on the support of General Motors Brazil and will be conducted 

experimentally through sensors coupled to the component.

CHAPTER 6: RESULTS AND DISCUTION 

 

6.1 Experimental Results 

 

6.1.1 Micro-structural and Chemical Analysis 

 

The results of chemical analysis via optical emission spectrometry by spark is shown 

in Table 6, the uncertainty value (U) being 2%. The analysis was performed in an ARL 3400 

optical emission spectrometer. ASTM E2055-99 (Standard Practice for Referencing Test 

Methods for Chemical Analysis of Metals and Related Metals) was used as reference. Before 

proceeding to the analysis, the spectrometer chamber was cleaned and the spectrometer 

calibrated using RBC-certified standards. Three (3) surface burnings were performed. 

 

Table 6: Results of chemical analysis through spectrometry (% in weight).

In comparison to nominal values of chemical composition (Table 5), it is possible to 

observe that Si, Fe, Mn, and Cu weight percentages are slightly above the nominal ones, 

besides Mg and Zn, which are near the maximum limit. As previously seen, this can be highly 

detrimental since iron and copper are the main impurities in Al-Si alloys. Cu weakens these 

alloys when hot and iron is particularly harmful since it is conducive to formation of acicular 

platelets, which significantly reduce ductility and fracture toughness (Figure 9). However, 

when balanced with manganese, iron forms a more compact eutectic phase (Al15(Fe, 

Mn)3Si2, Chinese script-shaped (Figure 61), which is less detrimental to mechanical 

properties (Crepeau, 1998). Zn is a weakening factor when hot and promotes high shrinkage 

during cast solidification, giving rise to contraction voids. Mn causes a small reduction in the 

material ductility. 



135

propagation test specimen. 

 

Chemical composition analysis was also performed by EDS (Energy Dispersive 

System) in EDX LINK ANALYTICAL equipment (Isis System Series 200), with SiLi 

Pentafet detector, ATW II (Atmosphere Thin Window) ultrathin window, 133eV-5.9keV 

resolution, coupled to an electron microscope. A Co calibration standard, 20kV electron 

beam, 25mm focal length, 30% dead time, and 2.82A current were also employed. This 

analysis was performed on fractured surfaces of fatigue crack propagation specimens from the 

component (cylinder head) and tested at 120°C, 200°C, and 280°C, based on images of the 

fractured surfaces obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Figure 62, Figure 63 e 

Figure 64). 

Firstly, an area of approximately 25mm2 was selected to provide an overall chemical 

composition result. The purpose of this procedure was to establish the occurrence or absence 

of effects of long test periods at different temperatures on chemical composition through 

formation of precipitates from synergy between temperature and mechanical deformation. 

Table 7 shows the lack of homogeneity of the material under study (engine head) due to its 

manufacturing process (casting). Hence, no conclusion may be drawn. 



136 

 

Another analysis comprised the selection of a smaller area (900µm2) in the region of 

final fracture and crack propagation under fatigue. Results from this new analysis (Table 7) 

show brittleness regions with high Cu and Fe concentrations, which, together with the high 

level of porosity found (Table 8), cause a decrease in the component mechanical strength.

Figure 65 shows micrographs of the alloy under investigation. This alloy 

microstructure is composed of primary ? phase, Si-rich eutectic, precipitates (Mg2Si, Al2Cu), 

and inter-metallic components (Al5FeSi, Al8Mg3FeSi6, Al5Mg8Cu2Si6). The micro-structural 

aspect of the alloy shows a well-defined dendrite structure with secondary dendrite arm 

spacing (SDAS) of approximately 25µm, in addition to a high porosity level (Figure 65a and 

b, dotted-dashed arrow) and also shows considerable modification of silicon particles (Figure 

65b, full arrow). It may be observed, in accordance with ASM (2004), the presence of 

FeMg3Si6Al8-type (Chinese-writing type) (Figure 65b dashed arrow) and Fe2Si2Al9-type 

(blade type) precipitates (Figure 65b, dotted arrow).

Table 8 shows the average porosity value per area of the alloy. The material under 

analysis displayed typical porosity as high as 50µm. However, the diameter of some voids 

reached 500µm. The porosity analysis was conducted with the aid of Image Pro Plus software 

from micrographs randomly taken in transversal and perpendicular directions under an 

Olympus microscope coupled to an image acquisition system. Figure 66 shows the 

micrographs used in this analysis as well as the corresponding regions of voids. There may be 

observed a high porosity level deriving from the casting process mainly due to failed cast 

degasification. Notwithstanding, despite the significant size of voids, they can hardly be 

detected through conventional techniques, e.g., ultrasound and X-ray, employed by auto 

factories, more so in sample analysis.

These voids, shown in detail in Figure 67, constitute stress concentrators, which can 

nucleate cracks, thus decreasing lifetime in nucleation. From this point of view, component 

lifetime may be equated to propagation lifetime because the crack-type defect is already 

present in the material (component).

to crack propagation tests at 120°C, thermo-mechanical fatigue tests and isothermal fatigue 

tests at 280° examined under a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Inter-dendrite porosity 

and fatigue grooves may be observed in detail on the specimen fracture surface.

There was observed in all specimens tested the occurrence of several dendrites 

exposed on the fracture surface, i.e., solidification voids. Fatigue specimens, in general, 

presented rather irregular surfaces, suggesting the formation of multiple nucleation sites from 

existing casting defects and indicating that cracks had propagated by connecting theses 

defects. 

From the analyses conducted it is possible to assume that fatigue cracks nucleated 

from defects (porosity) existing near the specimen surface and that crack propagation 

mechanisms are similar, a mixture of cleavage and tear grooves at both test temperatures 

(120°C and 280°C) for the material under investigation.

As is well known, the alloy mechanical strength decreases with increasing 

temperature. In this study, this fall became pronounced between 120°C and 280°C when creep 

mechanisms start acting. In addition to the temperature effect, the presence of regions with 

high Cu concentrations may have also contributed to it, since this element is known to have 

an embrittling effect at high temperatures.

6.1.2.2 Isothermal Fatigue 

 

Figure 71 shows curves of stress amplitude as a function of the number of reversals to 

failure obtained from isothermal fatigue tests at 120°C and 280°C, the latter being 

approximately 0.4 of the melting temperature. The same lifetime indicates a sharp drop of 

approximately 3 (three) times (                 ) in stress amplitude with increasing 

temperature. Specimens whose results were not consistent with overall behavior were 

analyzed and discarded if found to be defective.

Figure 72 shows curves of strain amplitude as a function of number of reversals to fail

Analysis of temperature influence on this material fatigue behavior indicates that 

lifetime decreases with increasing temperature. Reduced fatigue lifetime at high temperatures 

is due to different mechanisms fostering crack nucleation under these conditions (Suresh, 

1998), i.e.: 

i. Cyclic slip-induced cracks; 

ii. Grain boundary cavitation; 

iii. Grain boundary sliding and wedge crack development; 

iv. Void nucleation and growth from inclusions and precipitates; and 

v. Oxidation and corrosion. 

Figure 73 shows stress versus plastic deformation hysteresis curves obtained from 

isothermal fatigue tests at 120°C for total mechanical deformation of (a) 0.3% and (b) 0.5%. 

Figure 74 shows stress versus plastic deformation hysteresis curves obtained from isothermal 

fatigue tests at 280°C for 0.3% total mechanical deformation. Two distinct behaviors may be 

observed. The material hardens cyclically at 120°C and softens cyclically at 280°C. As is well 

known, high temperatures have the effect of promoting atom rearrangement in the crystal 

structures, i.e., atoms shift around in order to reach a more perfect and undeformed 

arrangement, thus facilitating the movement of dislocations. In general, materials whose

It is also possible to note that the material displays distinct behaviors under tensile and 

compressive loading conditions at both temperatures (120°C and 280°C). This difference in 

behavior is more pronounced at low temperatures. At high temperatures, this difference is 

subtler, since it can promote a decrease in the strength needed for deformation enabling 

microstructure recovery and re-crystallization processes, thereby decreasing the density of 

dislocations.

Figure 75 presents the curves of (a) mechanical deformation amplitude and (b) stress 

amplitude as a function of the number of reversals to failure, corresponding to in-phase 

anisothermal tests between 120°C and 280°C starting at the average temperature of 200°C. As 

in the case of isothermal fatigue tests, specimens whose results were contrary to overall 

behavior were analyzed and discarded if found to be defective.

Figure 76 shows curves of (a) mechanical deformation amplitude and (b) stress 

amplitude as a function of the number of reversals to fail as well as hysteresis for (c) 0.3% 

total mechanical deformation obtained from IF and TMF tests in order to analyze the material 

behavior in these different types of tests. It may be observed that, in general, isothermal tests 

cannot represent thermo-mechanical behavior. An exception may be made, due to the high 

cost of anisothermal tests, when isothermal tests are conducted under the most critical 

anisothermal conditions. 

Micro-structural refinement and porosity level are closely related in cast alloys 

because a large part of voids, especially those that are large and irregular, originate in inter-

dendrite regions as a result of local dendrite contractions of microscopic magnitude. Hence, 

the coarser the microstructure, the greater is contraction in inter-dendrite regions and the 

larger are the voids. On the other hand, these contractions are minimized in a refined 

microstructure. It is generally known that there is a higher tendency for crack nucleation in 

pores with diameters larger than 50µm. As the porosity level of the material under study is 

high (Table 8), fatigue lifetime is believed to have been damaged. 

Despite conducting isothermal fatigue tests at a low frequency as compared to that of 

anisothermal tests, it becomes high. The period of exposition to high temperatures promotes 

the occurrence of other effects, e.g., relaxation and creep, which explain the anisothermal 

hysteresis behavior seen in Figure 76(c) and shows that these phenomena interact with fatigue 

due to extended test periods at high temperatures. 

Figure 76(a) indicates that the material behavior under thermo-mechanical fatigue, 

considering in-phase mechanical and thermal loadings, is similar to the isothermal one at 

280°C, i.e., at maximum test temperature. Thus, it is should be observed that the greatest 

damage in anisothermal tests occurs when maximum stress is applied at the highest 

temperature. Figure 76(c) shows that the thermo-mechanical hysteresis is similar to the 

isothermal one at 280°C, differences owing to micro-deformation mechanisms at high 

temperatures, e.g., creep and relaxation. This is because the thermo-mechanical loading cycle 

is about 0.003Hz, much lower than the isotherm one (0.1Hz). Therefore, in this case, 

isothermal tests at maximum temperature could offer a good estimate of deformation behavior 

during cyclic loading, provided that costs and experimental difficulties of thermo-mechanical 

fatigue tests are taken into account.

deformation. 

 

In general, in both isothermal and anisothermal tests, cracks began to propagate in 

regions of inter-dendrite voids near the surface. Crack propagation exhibited similar behavior 

in both cases. In some instances, intrusion and extrusion mechanisms operated in the 

beginning of tests, causing cracks to nucleate and propagate through the ductile matrix in a 

trans-granular mode. Subsequently, because of higher tensile stresses, cracks tended to 

propagate through the eutectic, which is more brittle. 

 

6.1.2.4 Relaxation 

 

In order to better identify the viscous behavior shown in the hystereses of the thermo-

mechanical fatigue tests, relaxation tests were conducted at 80°C, 100°C, 120°C, 140°C, 

180°C, 240°C, and 280°C for total deformation levels of 0.1%, 0.3%, 0.5%, 0.7%, and 0.9%. 

The tests were performed by controlling deformation, using the extensometer employed in 

fatigue tests, and adjusting test parameters to obtain reliable results (Figure 77). The

hysteresis loops that did not reach plastic regime was also verified. Figure 78 shows test 

results. The hysteresis for 240°C was suppressed because during this test the hydraulic grip 

holding the specimen in place lost pressure, altering the curve.

Relaxation tests as well as hysteresis of isothermal fatigue tests indicate two distinct 

behaviors, the temperature of 240°C being a threshold. At lower temperatures, the material 

hardens cyclically whereas it softens cyclically at higher temperatures. High temperatures 

have the effect of promoting atom rearrangement in the crystal structure, i.e., atoms shift 

positions to reach a more perfect and undeformed arrangement, thus facilitating the movement 

of dislocations. The stress vs. plastic deformation curves shown in Figure 78 also indicate that 

although the test was performed under controlled strain, i.e., total strain was kept constant 

throughout the test, there was an increase in the amount of plastic deformation and 

consequently a decrease in elastic deformation so that total deformation remained constant. 

Therefore, this increase in plastic deformation corresponded to creep deformation. 

Figure 79 shows some stress vs. time curves for a constant deformation level of 0.5% 

obtained at 100°C, 180°C, and 280ºC. It is possible to note that the higher the test temperature 

(T), the lower is the maximum stress (    ) required for this level of deformation. In general, 

the higher the temperature ( ), the higher is the stress variation (  ) at a constant deformation 

level. When this level of stability is extended, i.e., the period in which deformation remains 

constant, stress keeps falling. It is important to remark that, since determining a threshold 

stress was not the purpose of this study, the maximum test period was five minutes, long 

enough to determine the material behavior and obtain viscosity parameters from the curves.

6.1.2.5 Fatigue Crack Growth 

 

Fatigue crack propagation tests were performed with specimens from the component 

(cylinder head), with special geometry as shown in Figure 52b. The tests were conducted at 

75°C, 120°C, 200°C, and 280°C, and loadings at R = 0.1 produced a sinusoidal wave shape, 

with 10 Hz frequency, or a trapezoidal wave shape, consisting of a loading ramp and an 

unloading ramp lasting 10s each and a 180s constant loading level, totaling a 0.005Hz 

frequency. Loading values were estimated for each temperature so as not to plasticize the 

region ahead of the crack. Several methods for measuring the progress of the crack were tried, 

i.e., visual method, image correlation method (Correli), and acetate replica method, but to no 

avail, probably due to the cast material microstructure and the impossibility of polishing the 

surface as much as required. Then, the potential drop method was used and the relationship 

between values obtained through it and crack growth was obtained according to ASTM E1457 

07

. Figure 80 shows the fracture surface of a specimen tested for fatigue crack propagation, 

criteria employed to define the points    and   , and calibration curves. The time used for 

data acquisition was approximately 1 (one) point per second. These data were filtered to 



168 

 

eliminate noise due to numerous factors such as power fluctuations, vibrations caused by 

hydraulic system of mechanical testing machine, small temperature fluctuations, and so on.

Figure 81 presents the results of the fatigue crack propagation test at 75°C under 

sinusoidal wave loadings. It would be expected to have values around         for the limit 

stress intensity factor (    ), usually found for aluminum alloys. However, values for the 

material under study (A356 gravity cast aluminum alloy) were well below expected, given the 

observed quantity of porosity and microstructural heterogeneity.

75°C under sinusoidal wave loading. 

 

Figure 82 shows results of fatigue crack propagation tests at 120°C under sinusoidal 

wave loading (CP01 and CP02) and trapezoidal wave loading (CP3). It may be observed that 

for the same level (  ) and sinusoidal wave loading there was a significant decrease in stress 

intensity as compared to that obtained at 75°C, which indicates the influence of temperature 

on crack development and, as a result, formation of a plastic region ahead of it. Trapezoidal 

wave loading under load control was more detrimental than sinusoidal wave loading, showing 

an increase in crack growth rate in the order of 100 (one hundred) times. This may be 

explained by the occurrence of other phenomena, which could not be observed previously due 

to loading mode, interacting during the test and aggravating it. Indeed, trapezoidal wave 

loadings with plateau time of the order of 3 minutes allow the occurrence of phenomena such 

as oxidation, creep, and relaxation, because the material is under maximum loading for a 

longer period. 



170 

 

 

Figure 82: Graph of crack propagation (     ) as a function of stress intensity factor 
variation (  ) at 120°C and under sinusoidal and trapezoidal wave loadings. 
 

Test results of fatigue crack propagation at 200°C in Figure 83 show a slight decrease 

in stress intensity as compared to tests performed at 75°C and 120°C. However, crack 

propagation rates remain practically constant in cyclic sinusoidal wave loading tests. There is 

also a small spread in results (CP04), which may be attributed to lack of homogeneity of the 

material in question as well as its high porosity level. These behaviors are intensified by 

increasing the test temperature. 



171 

 

 

Figure 83: Graph of crack propagation (     ) as a function of stress intensity factor 
variation (  ) at 200°C and under sinusoidal and trapezoidal wave loadings. 
 

Figure 84 presents the test results of fatigue crack propagation at 280°C under 

sinusoidal wave loading (CP01, CP02, and CP03) and trapezoidal wave loading in view of: 

(1) load control (CP04) and (2) constant deformation control (CP05). Again, it was observed 

that the propagation rate increased with increasing temperature. The spread of results for tests 

under sinusoidal wave loading (CP01, CP02 and CP03) increased slightly, indicating a 

deleterious effect of temperature, which increases further the influence of lack of 

homogeneity and high porosity of the material under study on its mechanical properties. 

When the loading mode was changed to trapezoidal under load control (CP04), the 

crack propagation rate increased significantly as compared to the same kind of loading 

conducted at 120°C. As compared to tests conducted under sinusoidal wave loading at the 

same temperature (280°C), trapezoidal wave loading was more detrimental, indicating an 

increase in crack growth of the order of 100 (one hundred) times. This increase was identical 

to that observed at 120°C for trapezoidal wave loading in relation to sinusoidal wave loading. 

 



172 

 

 

Figure 84: Graph of crack propagation (     ) as a function of stress intensity factor 
variation (  ) at 280°C and under sinusoidal and trapezoidal wave loadings. 
 

In the crack growth test under trapezoidal wave loading and displacement control (CP05), it 

may be observed that the crack growth rate remains constant, unlike the test conducted under 

load control. This is because during the plateau, when control is performed by piston 

displacement (LVDT), the material undergoes relaxation, i.e., a decrease in applied load and, 

consequently, in stress intensity. This phenomenon is the opposite of creep, observed when 

the test is performed under load control (CP04), maintained constant during the plateau, 

where there is specimen elongation. Figure 85 illustrates these two phenomena. During a 

cycle of a crack propagation test under trapezoidal wave loading and load control during the 

plateau, the material underwent slight elongation (Figure 85a), whereas under displacement 

control, the material experienced a release in applied load (Figure 85b), suggesting the 

occurrence of creep and relaxation, respectively.

Figure 86 presents crack length ( ) vs. number of cycles ( ) graphs from fatigue crack 

propagation tests under trapezoidal wave loading and load control (Figure 86a) and 



174 

 

displacement control (Figure 86b). It may be noticed that in load-control tests, the derivative 

(     ) is positive and increases as   rises, generating a linear crack growth rate, beginning 

at a lower limit in which crack propagation is virtually imperceptible up to a higher limit, 

close to specimen fracture, in which cracks propagate in an erratic fashion. On the other hand, 

in controlled-displacement tests,       is constant, producing constant crack growth rate 

throughout the test. This occurs because during long plateau periods, in which displacement is 

constant, applied stress undergoes relaxation.

Figure 87 shows a comparative graph of crack propagation tests conducted at 75°C, 

120°C, 200°C, and 280°C under sinusoidal wave and dwell loadings and load and 

displacement control. An Increase in test temperature causes mechanical strength to decrease, 

ordinarily observed in metallic materials and widely reported in the literature. This fact 

explains the decrease in the stress intensity shown in Figure 87, which is a function of applied 

load and, in turn, should decrease as temperature rises so as not to create a plastic zone 

capable of preventing cracks from growing. There may also be observed a general tendency 

for increased spread of results as temperature rises, which can be attributed to the influence of 

temperature on the material micro-structure, exacerbating its flaws, e.g., porosity and lack of 

homogeneity, that have an impact on its mechanical properties. In addition, as 

aforementioned, it is possible to note that dwell loadings are more detrimental in that they 

give rise to other phenomena, which interact during tests due to long plateau periods, causing 

crack growth rates to rise.

Figure 88 presents the comparative graph of displacement in relation to time for 

fatigue crack propagation tests at 120°C and 280°C under trapezoidal wave loading and load 

control. Piston displacement analysis (LVDT) of the mechanical testing machine (MTS) was 

conducted, but not of deformation measured by extensometer because of difficulties in 

coupling it to specimens. This type of analysis can be performed with no detriment to result 

reliability because specimen stiffness is very small as compared to that of MTS. In order to 

plot this graph, points corresponding to loading and unloading ramps were suppressed; only 

plateau points were maintained so as to render it more clear and objective.

Figure 88: Displacement vs. time graph for a crack propagation test at 120°C under dwell 

loading. 

 

Figure 88 shows the interaction of a phenomenon, distinct from mere fatigue crack 

propagation, at 280°C due to specimen elongation during the test conducted under load 

control, i.e., kept constant throughout the plateau. This phenomenon, known as creep, 

interacts during long plateau periods, causing the material to ?flow?. Therefore, cracks 

propagate due to interaction between fatigue and creep, i.e., not only due to fatigue as in the 

case of sinusoidal wave loading. Creep may influence both crack initiation and growth 

because creep damage is manifested by cavity nucleation in grain boundaries due to 

coalescing voids, stacking dislocations, and sliding grain boundaries. The same can happen to 

second-phase particles. Subsequent growth of these cavities is conducive to grain-boundary 

cracking and inter-granular fracture. Under static loading, failure is established by 

catastrophic fracture when cavities coalesce. On the other hand, at 120°C, it is not possible to 

draw any conclusions about this type of interaction, visible at 280°C, because the small 

magnitude of displacement can be attributed to compliance, i.e., to the opening of the crack 

?mouth? as it propagates through the material. 

The fracture surface analyses were performed using a SEM microscope. 

Unfortunately, this equipment does not allow observation of details of plastic deformation 

micromechanisms that may took place at high temperature. Therefore, it was used a 

deformation map generally obtained for Al and presented in Roesler et al (2007) to guide the 



178 

 

discussion. From the Figures presented here it was not possible to clearly define the acting 

micromechanisms, however significant changing may be observed when the tests were 

conducted under strain or load control and changing in temperature.  

Figure 91(a) and (b) present the fracture surface analysis from a specimen submitted to 

fatigue at 120ºC and dwell cycles in load control. From Figure 91 (a) it is seen the notch, the 

regions of stable (fatigue precrack and fatigue at high temperature) and final fracture after 

soaking in liquid nitrogen and submitted to static loading. In the region of stable crack 

growth, it was observed that the micromechanism was by fatigue mainly, with formation of 

striations. Besides, it was also observed cast defects on the crack growth path, which may acts 

as internal crack nucleation sites (very rough surface). Even considering the large dwell time, 

there was not clear signal of crack propagation by creep due to the testing temperature being 

only 120ºC. Analogously to the deformation at low temperature, creep deformation can also 

occur by dislocation movement in metal. But there is one crucial difference: if an edge 

dislocation encounters an obstacle, a precipitate for example, it needs a certain minimal stress 

to overcome the obstacle at low temperatures; if an edge dislocation encounters an obstacle at 

higher temperature, the dislocation can evade the obstacle by adding or emitting vacancies 

(Figure 89) and then the dislocation can leave its original slip plane. However, from the 

graphic presented in Roesler et al (Figure 90), for this temperature two micromechanisms may 

cause plastic deformation, one time independent called dislocation glide and other by creep 

denominated of dislocation creep. At low external stresses and at low temperature, the 

material deforms elastically. At higher temperatures, diffusion creep starts, being stronger at 

small stresses then dislocation creep because of its lower creep exponent. Because of the 

lower activation energy for grain boundary diffusion, this mechanism is more important than 

bulk diffusion at low temperature. Since the creep exponent is the same in both cases, the tow 

regions are separated by a vertical line. The final fracture performed under static load and 

after soaking in liquid nitrogen, shows a mixture of ductile and brittle fracture (Figure 91c). 

Figure 91(c) and (d) shows SEM analysis from a specimen tested by fatigue at 120ºC, 

sinusoidal wave shape in load control (10 Hz frequency). In the region of stable crack growth, 

it was observed formation of striations indicated by dashed arrows. Also observed the 

difference between the fracture surfaces of dell and sinusoidal wave shape.

Figure 92 presents the fracture surface analyses from a specimen submitted to fatigue 

crack growth at 200ºC and sinusoidal wave shape (10 Hz frequency). In this case, fatigue 

striations were easily identified on fracture surface, this may be due to the higher temperature 

than one and the alloy presented a higher ductility than the specimens at 120ºC and for similar 

 K, the fatigue crack growth rate was higher than at 120ºC. However, the high frequency did 

not allow the creep micromechanism being clearly active, and crack propagation was mainly 

by fatigue. Again, it is possible to see many cast defects on the fracture surface.

mainly due to creep, with dimples being formed extensively at the crack front during the 

dwell period. The crack starts to growth at relatively low  K, therefore, in this case, diffusion 

creep may be acting. As the crack growth,  K increases and the cracks accelerates very 

rapidly.

The fatigue crack propagation at 280ºC and dwell cycles in displacement control, 

Figure 94, presented a different fatigue behavior than that in load control. Figure 94(a) 

presents the regions of fatigue pre-crack and fatigue at high temperature. In this case, stress 

relaxation takes place at the crack front and    decreases rapidly as a result, the crack 

propagation rate is nearly constant. The fracture surface shows a mixture of dimples and 

features of mechanical fatigue (similar to the features of the pre-crack region). In Figure 94

Tentative crack propagation tests were conducted under in-phase and out-of-phase 

anisothermal loadings, but with no valid results. Among the various problems encountered 

during this study, the most relevant are inadequacy of available and tested methods for 

measuring crack progress, long duration of tests (approximately one month each), and lack of 

homogeneity and high porosity of the material under study. 

With respect to measuring crack growth, as stated earlier, this study opted for the 

potential-drop method. This decision was made after trying other methods and finding them to 

be inefficient. However, despite being the most suitable method among those available, the 

potential drop method is inadequate when some parameters, such as long testing time and the 

effects of thermal expansion produced by temperature variation intensified by in-phase 

mechanical loading, come into play. This occurs because small cracks appear in the region 

where the specimen is joined, by means of spot welding, with the wires employed to pass 

electric current, causing them to detach from the specimen after a few hundred cycles. In 

order to solve this problem, other methods of joining as well as other types of wire were tried. 

However, due to the specimen geometry, these other methods also proved inadequate. 



192 

 

Moreover, the potential-drop method proved inadequate when thermal loading is done via 

induction coils, necessary in order to have plausible heating and cooling times. The electric 

current passing through the coils induces Foucault current in the wires used by the potential 

drop, generating large oscillation (noise) in measured values. 

The long testing times (approximately one month each) were shown to be inadequate 

in that several external factors come into play, e.g., climate, energy drop, temperature 

variation throughout the day, and may even bring about unexpected test breaks, which can 

generate specimen overloading and, thus, invalidate the test. 

As regards the material under study, its lack of homogeneity and high porosity can 

produce secondary cracking beyond the notch, causing the specimen to rupture outside the 

measurement region. In addition, due to long loading times (e.g., approximately ten minutes 

per cycle), this peculiarity of the material microstructure is aggravated by the synergy 

between high temperature and maximum load (in-phase anisothermal case), giving rise to 

other phenomena, e.g. creep, which interact with the propagation of fatigue cracks. 

Figure 95a shows the notch as well as the pre-crack (indicated by red arrows) of the 

specimen used in the fatigue crack propagation test at room temperature. Figure 95b shows 

the specimen after a few weeks of test under in-phase anisothermal loading. The loading 

direction is shown by black arrows. As may be noticed, the fatigue pre-crack front has 

undergone significant rounding, indicating how the specimen crept. It is also possible to 

observe cavity nucleation at grain boundaries due to coalescing vacancies, stacking 

dislocations, and sliding grain boundaries. This may happen with second phase particles as 

well. Subsequent growth of these cavities leads to grain boundary cracking, which produces 

micro-voids, as indicated by blue arrows along the loading line.

6.2 Computational Results 

 

6.2.1 Monotonic Loading (Tensile Test) 

 

A finite element analysis was carried out to model the material mechanical behavior. 

After trying several software programs available on the market, ABAQUS STANDARD 

FINITE ELEMENT CODE was chosen because of its accepting new models and algorithms 

as subroutine. 

The study began with an elastic model of material behavior for the modeling of a 

specimen of geometry similar to those tested experimentally for stress and fatigue. Data for 

the material properties measured in these tests were entered at the software pre-processing 

phase. The same was done with loading and boundary conditions. The load vs. strain curves 

obtained experimentally provided the 0.2 creep limit in accordance with ASTM-E8/2009. The 

strain measured by the extensometer was converted into displacement, since the initial 

specimen length and length of the area measured by the extensometer are known, i.e., L0 = 

106mm and L0 = 12mm, respectively. This displacement was applied to the model, which 

provided the load required. In the resolution phase of the ?solver? algorithm, a finite element 

(FE) series of the software was tested, which indicated that C3D8R (C = continuous 

stress/displacement, 3D = tri-dimensional, R = reduced integration) was the most suitable 

element to start this study. Results regarding displacement, strain, and Von Mises stress were 

obtained in the post-processing phase (Figure 96).

195 

 

It is possible to observe that the useful region of the specimen is the one subjected to 

the greatest efforts. Therefore, modeling was carried out only on this roughly 12mm-long 

region, which corresponds exactly to the region being measured by the extensometer, thus 

obtaining more accurate results than previous ones (Figure 97). 

 

Figure 97: Von Mises stress results of modeling on useful region of strain specimen at room 

temperature. 

 

As might be expected, if the deformation measured by the extensometer is applied to a 

small region of the specimen with smaller cross-section than those of the remainder regions, 

in the whole specimen L0 = 106mm, it will be subject to higher stresses than under real-life 

conditions and, thus, erroneous. 

In order to compare experimental and computational results, loading vs. deformation 

curves were plotted for the elastic region at 25°C, 120°C, and 280°C (Figure 98, Figure 99 

and Figure 100).

It is possible to see a great difference between experimental and computational results. 

This is due to the fact that the adopted creep limit, in accordance with ASTM E8/2009, is not 

suitable for the type of response provided by the material under study. There is a non-linear 

region where plastic deformation occurs that is not being properly considered. This region 

may be under the influence of the material porosity. 

When only the linear segment of the curve was taken into account and the creep limit 

was taken at its end, it was possible to obtain computational results closer to experimental 

ones, as shown in Figure 101, Figure 102 and Figure 103.

The data obtained so far indicate that the porosity of the material under study seems to 

influence strongly its mechanical response. This is because mechanical properties are assumed 



199 

 

homogeneous throughout the specimen. However, they can vary from region to region, 

signaling the need to adapt the material model, taking into account its microstructure 

heterogeneity, so that modeling results are as close to reality as possible. Furthermore, when 

applying the model to the real component, MAGMA software simulation should be employed 

to provide data of physical and mechanical properties, thereby ensuring that its mechanical 

and physical behavior as a whole is taken into consideration. This indicates the need to adapt a 

material model so that modeling results are as close to reality as possible. 

 

6.2.2 Cyclic Loading (Fatigue Test) 

 

6.2.2.1 Identification of Material Behavior Law Parameters 

 

Since the material cyclic behavior is the only way into the incremental model of crack 

propagation under fatigue (Pommier S., Risbet M., 2005), the correct identification of the 

material behavior law and its parameters is of fundamental importance to describe plasticity in 

the region immediately ahead of the crack tip and all its related phenomena. The identification 

of the material behavior was done by means of isothermal fatigue and relaxation tests 

described in Sections 6.1.2.2 e 6.1.2.4.  

Finite Element Modeling of this behavior will then allow the identification of the eight 

material parameters of cracked structure behavior. In this case Chaboche law is used with 

combined nonlinear kinematic hardening (X) and nonlinear isotropic hardening (R). Kinematic 

hardening evolution is given by: 

 

   
 

 
                             (58) 

 

whereas isotropic evolution is given by: 

 

                           (59) 

 

where   is accumulated plastic deformation given by: 

 



200 

 

    
 

 
             

 

   

   (60) 

 

and the viscous component is given by the Norton-Hoff law: 

 

        
  (61) 

 

and therefore, the total strain is given by: 

 

                   (62) 

 

A Finite Element simulation was conducted by ABAQUS to identify the material 

behavior law parameters. The dimensions correspond to the useful region of the specimen 

employed in the fatigue test. The axisymmetric model was used, with calculations performed 

under plane strain (Figure 105).

material in question: (a) and (b) boundary conditions; and (c) Finite Element mesh

Comparison between the experimental hysteresis and that obtained computationally under 



201 

 

isothermal and thermo-mechanical loading conditions (Figure 106, Figure 107 and Figure 

108) shows that the chosen parameters satisfactorily agree with experimental results. It was 

also noted that when viscous behavior comes into play (Figure 109), discrepancies between 

the model and experimental results are more pronounced. This point shows the difficulty in 

modeling the material behavior when two or more phenomena interact.

6.2.2.2 Identification of Plastic Blunting Law Parameters 

 

Since the behavior of the A356 aluminum engine cylinder head is known, the plastic 

blunting law parameters can be identified. This is done by a Finite Element (FE) calculation 

on a cracked plate. The plate dimensions are              and a central crack of length 



204 

 

        . Calculations are performed under plane strain using the behavior identified for 

the material in question. The plate is subjected to 30 loading and unloading cycles in order to 

achieve a stabilized cycle for the cyclic part (Figure 110). 

 
Figure 110: Finite Element calculation performed to identify plastic blunting law parameters. 

 

The identification of parameters   ,   ,    , and     is accomplished by plotting the 

evolution of plastic blunting as a function of the stress intensity factor applied (Figure 111). 

The identification of    and    is done during the first loading cycle and of      and     

during the last unloading cycle. The parameters are then calculated by the smallest square 

method. 

 

 
Figure 111: Identification of parameters   ,   ,    , and    . 

 

The identification of parameter     is done by plotting the evolution of contact point 

    in the first loading cycle as a function of plastic blunting. The evolution of parameter 

    as function of plastic blunting is linear and described by the following equation: 

 

              (64) 

 

Via the smallest square method, it is possible to determine the angular coefficient of 

the line    , i.e., the slope of curve         (Figure 112). The identification of    is done by 



205 

 

plotting the evolution of corresponding plastic strain as a function of distance   from the crack 

tip during loading. Just the first curve points are employed in the calculation. Parameters    

and    are estimated from the contact point evolution as a function of crack length.

Finite Element calculations and procedures to identify plastic blunting law parameters 

were carried out by ABAQUS, which took a couple of hours. The parameters obtained for the 

material under study, i.e., A356 aluminum alloy used in the manufacture of automotive engine 

cylinder heads, are shown in Table 10. Obtaining the parameters for the plastic blunting law 

depends on choosing the adequate material mechanical behavior model as well as its 

parameters.

6.2.2.3 Identification of Crack Propagation Law Parameter 

 



206 

 

Once the parameters of the material behavior law and plastic blunting are determined, 

it is time to determine the fatigue crack propagation law and its only tuning parameter ( ): 

 

  

  
 

 

 
  
  

  
  (65) 

 

The identification of the fatigue crack propagation law parameter   is done by 

performing tests under controlled loading and constant amplitude. These tests were carried out 

by a mechanical testing machine (Figure 53) on specimens with corner cracks (Figure 52b) 

and loading rate       (shown in Section 6.1.2.5). Figure 113 presents the fatigue crack 

propagation curve at       plotted in a Paris diagram. 

 

 
Figure 113: Graph of crack propagation (     ) as a function of stress intensity factor 
variation (  ) at 120°C and under sinusoidal wave loadings at frequency of 10 Hz.  
 

Parameter   exerts influence only on the Paris curve level at constant amplitude and 

very little on its slope. In fact, the crack propagation rate is directly proportional to the plastic 

blunting rate. Thus, when   is altered, just the position of the propagation curve in the Paris 

diagram changes whereas its slope remains constant. The Paris curve slope derives directly 

from the plastic blunting law. Thus, accurate identification of the material behavior law 

parameters and, consequently, blunting law parameters is fundamental for the Paris exponent 

  to be represented correctly. Therefore, in order to identify  , an initial simulation is 



207 

 

performed by adopting its value as equal to 1 (one). Its exact value is then deducted from the 

relationship between the simulated rate and experimental rate for a same level of     .

CONCLUSIONS 

 

The material studied in this work is an A356 Al alloy, used to produce engine cylinder 

heads for the automotive industry by die casting process. The chemical analysis has shown 

that some chemical elements were a slight difference from the nominal values (Fe and Si), as 

well as the EDX analysis, from specific areas, showed that the cast presented some lack of 

homogeneity. 

From microstructural analisys it was observed a quite coarse dentrite microstructure in 

a eutectic matrix, with a mean SDAS of 25 ?m, intemetallic precipitates and porosities (mean 

diameter size of 50 ?m and maximum size of 500 ?m).  

As expected, the tensile properties were strongly affected by testing temperature (RT 

till 280 
o
C), with a quite sensitive drop of E (63 to 45 GPa),  y (124 to 80 MPa) and  u (212 to 

81 MPa) as the temperature was raised.  

Considering the isothermal fatigue tests at 120 and 280 
o
C, under strain control, it was 

observed that as the temperature raised from 120 to 280 
o
C, life dropped markedly 

(approximately 10 times). This was due to the material has became less resitant to plastic 

deformation and defects were intensified. From the stabilized hysteresis loop it was possible 

to observe the difference in the mentioned ductility, as well as, that at 120 
o
C, during testing, 

the A356 Al alloy ?cyclic hardens? while at 280
 o
C ?cyclically softens?. 

From the themomechanical in-phase tests, with temperature varying from (120 to 280 

o
C), it was possible to observe that life is quite similar to the isothermal fatigue test at 280 

o
C. 

In this case, the more sensitive damage caused the in-phase mechanical and thermal cycle take 

place at the highest temperature. In time, both hysteresis are quite similar in shape, with some 

differences due to the fact that the thermomechanical cycle is slower (0.003 Hz) than the 

isothermal cycle (0.1 Hz), allowing some stress relaxation (reducing the maximum stress 

level). 

Relaxation tests indicated two distinct behaviors, with the temperature of 240°C being 

a threshold. At lower temperatures, the material hardens cyclically whereas it softens 

cyclically at higher temperatures. This behavior is similar to the one observed during the 

isothermal fatigue tests. As the tests are carried out in strain control, during the dwell the 

stress is relaxed, reducing the elastic component of strain and at same time increasing the 

plastic component. It was observed that as the test temperature is increased, the amount of 

stress relaxed increases. 

 



209 

 

From the fatigue crack growth results, it was observed that temperature and wave 

shape has a strong influence on the crack growth rate as well as on the stress intensity 

threshold. Considering sinusoidal wave shape (10 Hz), as the temperature increased the  Kth 

decreased and the crack propagation rate increased (for a constant  K). However, the rate as 

da/dN change with temperature is quite similar, as an indicative that the micromechanism of 

crack growth has not changed due to the high frequency used, and it was due only to loss of 

mechanical strength. 

Considering a constant temperature (120 and 280°C) and stress controlled test, 

changing the wave shape from sinusoidal to 3 min dwell at maximum load, the crack 

propagation rate has increased of approximately 100 times, showing a strong contribution of 

creep on the crack propagation process, with the amount of creep contribution dependent on 

temperature, it being higher as higher is the temperature.  

Considering a constant temperature (280°C), strain controlled test and the  3 min dwell 

at maximum load, it was observed that the rate of da/dN with  K become almost constant, due 

to stress relaxation. 

It has noticed that is quite difficult to obtain, for the casting material studied in this 

work, the mechanical behavior parameters, since there is a noticiable discrepancy amount the 

specimens tested. However, it was shown for the examples presented here, that the model was 

able to reproduce, with a reasonable approximation, the stress – strain relationship at different 

temperatures, for the isothermal and anysothermal cases.
