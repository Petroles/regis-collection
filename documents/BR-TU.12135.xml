RESUMO	

As	 aves	 marinhas	 são	 indicadores	 muito	 úteis	 e	 fiáveis	 da	 poluição	 ambiental	 e	

permitem	aos	inves9gadores	estudar	a	dinâmica	dos	contaminantes	nos	ecossistemas	

marinhos.	 Mais	 especificamente,	 as	 aves	 marinhas	 podem	 ser	 bioindicadores	

adequados	para	avaliar	as	condições	ambientais	que	caracterizam	as	áreas	de	estudo.	

As	 suas	 caracterís9cas	 ecológicas	 correspondem	 de	 forma	 imediata	 e	 intensa	 às	

mudanças	ambientais	e	as	dietas,	dois	parâmetros	que	são	fundamentais	para	atribuí-

los	 como	 bioindicadores.	 As	 espécies	 de	 aves	 marinhas	 podem	 ser	 usadas	 também	

como	indicadores	dos	recursos	pesqueiros,	uma	vez	que	a	composição	da	dieta	reflete	

a	disponibilidade	de	presas	e	a	flutuação	da	abundancia	das	mesmas,	o	que	também	

pode	alterar	a	estratégia	de	procura	de	alimento	das	aves	marinhas	e	seu	padrão	de	

distribuição.	 Adicionalmente,	 as	 potenciais	 flutuações	 dos	 stocks	 haliêu9cos	 podem	

causar	o	declínio	significa9vo	das	populações	de	aves	marinhas,	em	par9cular	aquelas	

cons9tuídas	 por	 espécies	 piscívoras	 generalistas	 ou	 especializadas.	 Como	

consequência,	 as	 aves	 marinhas	 são	 um	 grupo	 taxonomicamente	 variado	 sendo	 o	

indicador	 mais	 sensível	 entre	 a	 avifauna	 para	 monitorizar	 as	 mudanças	 ambientais	

causadas	por	forças	naturais	e	ou	a9vidades	humanas.	Informações	sobre	mudanças	

nos	stocks	de	pescado	e	a9vidades	piscatórias,	como	a	sobre-exploração	das	pescarias	

e	 o	 fornecimento	 de	 capturas	 acessórias	 descartáveis	 	 também	 podem	 ser	 ob9das	

através	do	estudo	do	comportamento	das	aves	marinhas,	mas	requerem	conhecimento	

detalhado	 da	 biologia	 das	 mesmas	 e	 a	 sua	 correspondência	 com	 as	 mudanças	 no	

fornecimento	 de	 alimentos.	 No	 entanto,	 é	 importante	 ressaltar	 que	 os	 dados	

referentes	 às	 quan9dades	 e	 à	 composição	 dos	 itens	 descartados	 e	 potencialmente	

u9lizados	como	fonte	de	alimento	adicional	de	aves	marinhas,	são	muito	limitados	no	

Mediterrâneo	Oriental.	Além	disso,	as	aves	marinhas	fazem	parte	do	topo	da	cadeia	de	

predadores	 marinhos,	 dependendo	 exclusivamente	 de	 ambientes	 aquá9cos	 em	 que	

enfrentam	 riscos	 tóxicos	 por	 contato	 externo,	 por	 inalação	 e,	 par9cularmente,	 por	

ingestão	de	alimentos	e	água.	Assim,	as	aves	marinhas	com	uma	longevidade	 longa	

podem	atuar	como	um	bioindicador	de	poluição	química	de	diferentes	origens,	uma	

vez	 que	 acumulam	 uma	 ampla	 gama	 de	 componentes	 químicos	 e	 outras	 formas	 de	

poluentes	marinhos.	Consequentemente,	essas	espécies	oferecem	oportunidades	para	

detetar	e	avaliar	a	longo	prazo,	efeitos	toxicológicos	dos	poluentes	nos	ecossistemas	

marinhos.	Por	exemplo,	uma	das	suas	caracterís9cas	ecológicas	que	pode	ser	afetada	



pela	poluição	química,	é	o	tamanho	da	população	que	varia	ligeiramente	de	ano	para	

ano.	 As	 taxas	 de	 crescimento	 dos	 juvenis,	 o	 sucesso	 da	 incubação,	 o	 sucesso	 da	

reprodução	e	qualquer	mudança	de	comportamento	durante	o	período	de	incubação	

podem	ser	afetados	pela	contaminação	tóxica	de	poluentes	nas	áreas	de	alimentação	

u9lizadas	 durante	 a	 época	 de	 reprodução.	 Muitas	 espécies	 de	 aves	 marinhas	

acumulam	 altas	 concentrações	 de	 contaminantes	 no	 organismo.	 Tendo	 em	

consideração	que	estão	no	topo	da	cadeia	trófica,	as	aves	marinhas	são	“monitores”	

adequadas	de	poluentes	que	se	amplificam	através	da	cadeia	trófica.	Além	disso,	já	foi	

provado	 que	 são	 bioindicadores	 de	 poluentes	 metálicos,	 u9lizados	 para	 a	

determinação	da	origem	do	mercúrio	em	níveis	tróficos	marinhos.	Concentrações	de	

metais	são	frequentemente	relatadas	para	aves	adultas,	mas	menos	frequentemente	

para	 juvenis	 ou	 crias.	 No	 entanto,	 os	 juvenis	 foram	 propostos	 como	 indicadores	

par9cularmente	úteis	para	a	poluição	pois	concentram	metais	durante	um	período	de	

tempo	específico	em	áreas	de	alimentação	definidas	em	torno	da	colônia.	As	espécies-

alvo,	 nomeadamente	 a	 Shearwater	 de	 Scopoli	 (Calonectris	 diomedea),	 são	 aves	

marinhas	migratórias	pelágicas,	de	grande	longevidade,	com	um	grau	par9cularmente	

alto	 de	 tenacidade	 no	 local	 e	 fidelidade	 ao	 companheiro.	 Caracteriza-se	 como	 uma	

espécie	 deambulante	 de	 acordo	 com	 sua	 distribuição	 pelágica	 e	 abrangente.	 Mais	

especificamente,	os	locais	de	reprodução	desta	espécie	estão	localizados	na	bacia	do	

Mediterrâneo,	enquanto	os	seus	terrenos	de	invernagem	estão	localizados	nas	áreas	

equatoriais	pelágica	e	costeira	do	Atlân9co	Este.	A	dieta	inclui	principalmente	peixes	

pelágicos	 e	 meso	 pelágicos,	 lulas,	 crustáceos	 e	 ocasionalmente	 zooplâncton.	 Estes	

organismos	 marinhos	 podem	 ser	 encontrados	 em	 águas	 rasas	 e	 perto	 de	 recifes,	 e	

cons9tuem	a	presa	mais	comum	capturada	em	águas	pouco	profundas	ou	perto	da	

super[cie	 do	 mar.	 A	 Grécia	 hospeda	 um	 número	 significa9vo	 de	 colônias	 de	

Shearwater	de	Scopoli	em	ilhas	e	 ilhotas	desabitadas,	espalhadas	principalmente	no	

Mar	Egeu	central	e	meridional,	no	Mar	Jónico	do	Sul	e	do	Norte	e	em	torno	de	Creta.	A	

área	de	estudo	deste	trabalho,	o	complexo	da	Ilha	de	Strofades	(37	°	15	'N,	21	°	00'	E)	é	

um	grupo	remoto	de	duas	pequenas	ilhotas	baixas	e	várias	rochas,	localizadas	no	Mar	

Jónico	do	Sul,	32	milhas	náu9cas	ao	sul	da	Ilha	de	Zakynthos	e	26	milhas	náu9cas	a	

oeste	 do	 Peloponeso.	 As	 duas	 ilhotas	 principais	 (Stamfani	 e	 Arpyia)	 são	 a	 principal	

colônia	grega	da	espécie	(cerca	de	5.550	casais	de	reprodutores),	cobrem	uma	área	de	

4	 km2	 e	 cons9tuem	 parte	 do	 Parque	 Nacional	 Marinho	 de	 Zakynthos.	 Os	 dados	 de	



contaminação	 por	 metais	 em	 aves	 marinhas	 originadas	 nas	 Ilhas	 Strofades	 são	

escassos.	 Um	 dos	 obje9vos	 deste	 estudo	 será	 fornecer	 dados	 de	 referencia	 para	 os	

níveis	 de	 concentração	 de	 metais	 na	 Shearwater	 de	 Scopoli	 recolhidos	 em	 uma	 das	

maiores	colônias	na	Grécia	para	análises	compara9vas	de	diferenças	interespecíficas	e	

geográficas	em	bioacumulação.	

No	presente	estudo,	os	níveis	de	cádmio	(Cd),	chumbo	(Pb),	cobre	(Cu),	cobalto	(Co),	

níquel	(Ni),	manganês	(Mn)	e	zinco	(Zn)	foram	inves9gados	como	potenciais	fatores	de	

stress	químico	no	sangue	de	juvenis	e	adultos	Scopoli's	Shearwaters	no	complexo	da	

colonia	da	ilha	Strofades,	na	Grécia.	Foram	recolhidas	amostras	de	sangue	de	juvenis	e	

indivíduos	 Shearwaters	 de	 Scopoli	 adultos,	 em	 7	 épocas	 de	 reprodução	 diferentes	

entre	2007	e	2014.	As	amostras	foram	recolhidas	em	três	sub-colonias	da	parte	oeste,	

sul	e	 leste	da	 ilha	de	Stamfani,	onde	as	crias	e	os	reprodutores	foram	capturados	à	

mão.	Foi	recolhida	uma	quan9dade	de	0,2-0,5	ml	de	sangue	em	cada	exemplar	usando	

uma	seringa	com	heparina	e	mantendo	em	frascos	eppendorf	com	álcool	ellico	como	

conservante.	 Foram	 recolhidas	 um	 total	 de	 238	 amostras,	 das	 quais	 182	 eram	 de	

juvenis.	 O	 processo	 de	 análise	 de	 metais	 nas	 amostras	 de	 sangue	 envolveu	 a	

preparação	 de	 amostras,	 digestão	 e	 quan9ficação	 de	 cada	 metal.	 A	 digestão	 foi	

realizada	com	placa	quente	e	a	quan9ficação	do	conteúdo	metálico	foi	realizada	por	

espectroscopia	 de	 absorção	 atômica	 em	 forno	 de	 grafite.	 A	 precisão	 do	 método	 foi	

verificada	analisando	duplicados	com	a	mesma	quan9dade	de	material	de	referência

Abstract

Seabirds are very useful and trustful indicators of environmental pollution and allow re-
searchers to study the dynamics of contaminants in marine ecosystems. More specifi-
cally, marine birds can be suitable bioindicators to assess the environmental conditions 
which characterize areas of interest. Their ecological features correspond immediately 
and intensely to environmental changes and food supplies, two parameters that are 
fundamental to assign them as bioindicators. Seabird species can be used also as indi-
cators of fishery supplies since diet composition reflects prey availability and abundance 
fluctuation of prey appearance, which may also alter seabirds foraging strategy and 
their distribution pattern. Additionally, potential fluctuations of fish stocks  may cause 
significant population decline to seabirds, specifically to those which constitute general-
ist or specialist piscivorous species . As a consequence, seabirds is a taxonomically 
varied group which constitutes  the most sensitive indicator between avifauna for moni-
toring environmental changes caused by natural forces and/or human activities . Infor-
mation regarding fish stock changes and piscatorial activities such as fisheries overex-
ploitation and supply of discarded unsaleable bycatch can also be obtained by studying 
seabird behavior, but requires detailed knowledge of marine birds biology and their cor-
respondence to food supply changes. However it is important to highlight that data re-
lated to the quantities and the composition of items discarded and potentially used as 
an additional food source for scavenging seabirds, are very limited in the Eastern 
Mediterranean Sea. Moreover, seabirds constitute top marine predators, depended ex-
clusively on aquatic environments where they face toxic risk by external contact, by in-
halation, and particularly by ingestion of food and water. Thus, long-lived seabirds may 
act as a bio-indicator for chemical pollution of different origin since they accumulate a 
wide range of chemical components and other forms of marine pollutants Consequently, 
these species offer opportunities to detect and assess in a long term basis, toxicological 
effects of pollutants in marine ecosystems.  For example, one of their ecological fea-
tures that could be affected by chemical pollution, is their population size that varies 
slightly between years. Juvenile growth rates, hatching  success, breeding success, and 
any behavior change during the incubation period, can be affected by toxic pollutant

contamination in the marine foraging areas used during breeding season. Many seabird 
species accumulate high concentrations of contaminants in their organism. Taking into 
consideration that are in the highest place of trophic chain, seabirds are suitable 
“screens” of pollutants that are being amplified via the trophic chain. Also, it has been 
already proved that they are bioindicators of metal pollutants and used for the determi-
nation of origin of mercury in marine trophic levels. Concentrations of metals are often 
reported for adult birds, but less often for chicks or fledglings. However, juveniles have 
been proposed as particularly useful indicators for pollution, as they concentrate metals 
during a specific period of time and from local and definable foraging areas around 
colony. The target species, namely Scopoli’s Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea) is a 
pelagic, long lived, migratory seabird, with particularly high degree of site tenacity and 
mate fidelity. It is characterized as a highly vagrant species according to its pelagic and 
wide-ranging distribution. More specifically, the breeding sites of this species are locat-
ed in the Mediterranean basin whereas its wintering grounds are located in the pelagic 
and coastal equatorial areas of the eastern Atlantic. Its diet mainly includes pelagic and 
mesopelagic fishes, squids, crustaceans and occasionally zooplankton. These marine 
organisms can be found in shallow waters and near reefs, and constitute the most 
common prey caught in shallow waters or near the sea surface. Greece hosts a signifi-
cant number of Scopoli’s Shearwater colonies on uninhabited islets, spread mainly in 
central and southern Aegean Sea, southern and northern Ionian Sea and around Crete. 
Our study area, the Strofades Island complex (37° 15’ N, 21° 00’ E) is a remote group of 
two small low islets and several rocks, located in the southern Ionian Sea, 32 nm south 
of Zakynthos Island and 26 nm west of the Peloponnese. The two main islets (Stamfani 
and Arpyia) host the largest greek colony of the species (about 5,550 breeding pairs), 
cover an area of 4 km2 and constitute part of the National Marine Park of Zakynthos. 
Data for metal contamination in seabirds originated from the Strofades Islands are bare-
ly exist. One of the aims of this study will be to provide baseline data for metal concen-
tration levels in Scopoli’s Shearwater collected in one of the biggest colonies in Greece 
for comparative analyses of inter-specific and geographical differences in bioaccumula-
tion.

In the present study levels of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), cobalt (Co), nickel 
(Ni), manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn) were investigated as potential chemical stressors in 
the blood of juveniles and adults Scopoli’s Shearwaters in Strofades Island complex 
colony, in Greece. Blood samples were collected from both juveniles and adult Scopoli’s 
Shearwaters individuals, during 7 different breeding seasons between 2007 and 2014. 
The samples were collected in three sub-colonies from the western, southern and east-
ern part of the Stamfani Island, where fledglings and  breeders were captured by hand. 
An amount of 0.2-0.5 ml per blood sample was collected using a heparinsed syringe 
and kept in eppendorf vials with ethyl alcohol as preservative. A total number of 238 
samples were collected, from which 182 were from juveniles. The process of metal 
analysis of blood samples involved sample preparation, digestion and metal quantifica-
tion. The digestion was performed using hot plate and the quantification of metal con-
tent was performed by Graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy. The accuracy 
of the method was verified by analyzing duplicates of the same amount of certified ref-
erence material of blood serum. Blanks were also prepared with and acidified Milli-Q 
water solution with 0.2% HNO3 and treated in the same way to check for any contami-
nation. Statistical differences of metal concentrations were investigated along with rela-
tionships with age, gender and nesting site. From toxic metals, cadmium (Cd) ranged 
between 0.01-0.02 ?g/g and lead (Pb) between 0.07-0.53 ?g/g, which were close to the 
respective European standards. Concentrations of essential metals were generally 
closed to basal levels, compared with other studies. Statistical analysis in juveniles and 
adults revealed that in relation to body mass there is no significant relationship between 
the weight of individuals and metals.  All metals showed a significant difference with the 
years. Statistical results indicate significant sexual differences for Cd, Co, Mn, Pb and 
Zn for both juveniles and adults. Testing for correlation with nesting sites show signifi-
cant differences for most of the tested metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn). Principal 
Component Analysis (PCA) were used to detect the relationships between metal con-
centrations (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn), year, sex and site of for juvenile and adult 
birds from Strofades Island colony. Results of PCA showed that they represent 34.82% 
of variance with PC1 representing (18.76%) and PC2 (16.05%). Metal levels tested do

not seem to have adverse effects on studied population, but diet analysis of the species 
will be helpful towards the better understanding of metal uptake.

1. General Ecology of Seabirds

The interaction between seabirds and marine environment occurs in different levels, 
from the lowest up to superior levels of the ecosystem. This is One of the appreciable 
criteria that render them as  reliable candidates to monitor the conditions and health of 
the marine environment. Generally, the ecology of these birds is well known, as well as 
their characteristics, population numbers and also their colonialist actions and 
reproductive processes, that constitutes a good occasion for monitoring high numbers 
of individuals (Piatt, 2007, Furness and Camphuysen, 1997). 

More specifically, marine birds can be suitable bioindicators to assess the 
environmental conditions and characterize the areas of interest. Their characteristics 
correspond immediately and intensely at environmental changes and food supplies, two 
parameters that are fundamental to assign them as bioindicators (Sponza et al., 2010). 
Juvenile growth rates, incubation success, birth success, nesting process and any 
behavior changes during the incubation period, can be affected by toxic pollutant 
contamination in the system. Seabird species can be used also as indicators of  fishery 
supplies, by monitoring their searching behavior for preys, because they reflect the prey 
availability and abundance fluctuation of prey appearance, which influences their diet 
strategies (Sponza et al., 2010). One of their characteristics that could be affected, is 
their population size that varies slightly between years.

As an example, disruption of reproduction can occur for European Shag (Phalacrocorax 
aristotelis) in periods of constrained food supply and consequently it abstains from the 
reproductive process during those years (Furness and Camphuysen, 1997). This 
disruption can also be observed in seabird populations, when fish stocks are deplete 
(Piatt, 2007). Additionally, potential fluctuations of fish stocks supplies, can change the 
number of seabirds (Velarde, 1994), because they have specific diet. As a rule, seabirds 
are the most sensitive indicators in-between bird species (Furness and Camphuysen, 
1997). Moreover, chemical components of the total trophic chain can be taken up from 
the feeding of seabirds with various levels of the trophic chain. With observations on 
seabird behavior, their feeding preferences and the characteristics of their population, 

MASTER THESIS - MACS - UALG 2017 !5



we can determine if the fish stocks have suffered any fluctuation (Piatt, 2007). 
Information regarding fish stock changes and piscatorial activities can also be obtained, 
by studying seabird behavior (Furness and Camphuysen, 1997), but requires in detail 
knowledge of bird biology and their correspondence to food supply changes. As an 
example, seabirds that “scan” for finding food, as the Yellow-legged gull (Larus 
michahellis), feeds also on fishes that are rejected by the trawlers, and as a result, 
piscatorial activity on each area can be evaluated (Gonzalez - Solis, 2003, Ramos et al., 
2009). It is important to highlight that the data are related with the quantities and the 
composition of prey rejects are very limited in Mediterranean Sea. This method of study 
can lead to a better understanding of way that fishery is affected.

Taking into consideration that are in the highest place of trophic chain, seabirds are 
suitable “screens” of pollutants that are being amplified via the trophic chain (Furness 
and Camphuysen, 1997). Also, it has been already proved that they are bioindicators of 
metal pollutants (eg. mercury) and used for the determination of origin of mercury in 
marine trophic levels (Furness and Camphuysen, 1997). Seabird feathers are a useful 
tool to asses air pollution. Also by mercury ingestion they can easily locate the region 
where the pollution occurred, depended on the type of feathers (the different types of 
feathers are connected with the seasons and movements of birds between reproductive 
and not reproductive period) (Furness and Camphuysen, 1997, Arcos et al., 2002, 
Ramos et al., 2009). Also, monitoring other pollutants can be achieved with the analysis 
of their concentrations in eggshells.

1.1 Scopoli’s Shearwater

The mediterranean Scopoli’s Shearwater, 
Calonectris diomedea diomedea (Figure 1), 
constitutes one of the most characteristic types 
of fauna in the Mediterranean and Greek seas. It 
is a pelagic, long lived, monogamist, migratory 
seabird, with particularly high degree of site 
tenacity (Thibault et al.,  1997). It has an 

MASTER THESIS - MACS - UALG 2017 !6

author



aerodynamic form with long  and narrow wings.  On the upper side, it has a coffee 
coloration and white on the under part. It’s bill is powerful and yellowish. It’s easy for 
someone to confuse them with a young gull but it can be distinguished during flight 
while the men gull strikes often it’s wings and Scopoli’s Shearwater can maneuvers 
easily between the waves without using them. In order to fly comfortably, Scopoli’s 
Shearwater the wind conditions should be higher than calm, which means 20-27 km/h. 
In total calm conditions it has serious flying problems and strikes his wings to fly. They 
fly usually low, close to water surface skulking the fishes that are frighten by the boat 
propellers.

Scopoli’s Shearwater’s diet is constituted from pelagic and mesopelagic fishes, squids, 
crustaceans and occasionally zooplankton (Monteiro et al 1996). These and other small 
fishes that are found in shallow waters and near reefs, are the most common prey and 
they are caught when they are found in shallow waters or near the sea surface 
(Granadeiro et al., 1998).

International 2004, Handrinos &amp;amp; Akriotis 1997, Ristow et al. 1991, Karris et al. 2010



According to Cramp and Simmons (1977) and Belda and Sánchez (2001), Scopoli’s 
Shearwater prey on the day but also in the night or at dawn as in Balearic Islands. In 
Strofades Islands, Karris et al. (2009 and 2010), found that  during the nightly hours 
(00:00 – 05:00am) the Shearwaters spend most of their time searching for preys, while 
the morning hours up to midday spend the bigger part for their movings. It was found 
that a marked Shearwater from Strofades Islands colony, covered a distance of 142,4 
km and an area of 580 km2 within four days, for prey searching (Karris et al., 2010). 
Studies concluded that, shearwaters can use for their food search an extensive region if 
the fish stocks are limited close to their colony (Mougin and Jouanin 1977, Karris et al.,
2010). 

In Greece, Shearwaters are nesting in islands, mainly in central and southern Aegean 
Sea, southern Ionian Sea and around Crete. Practically, is possible to see them 
everywhere, because they daily cover long distances and fly far away from their 
colonies. The European population of Shearwaters is estimated in 270,000 - 290,000 
breeding pairs that correspond to 810,000 - 870,000 individuals, by which 234,500 - 
243,500 are breeding in Atlantic Ocean and 35,000 - 55,000 in Mediterranean Sea 
(BirdLife International 2004a). A percentage of 75 - 94% of world distribution of the 
species is located in European territory, therefore an initial estimate of world population 
of the species is  approximately 900,000 - 1.200,000 individuals. Mediterranean 
colonies are usually found in inhabited rocky islands and are relatively small (Ristow et 
al., 1991). Greek population is estimated in 4,400 - 5,000 pairs distributed between 29 
colonies in Aegean Sea and Ionian Sea (Figure 2) (Birdlife International 2004, 
Handrinos and Akriotis 1997). New data from Strofades Islands colony increased the 
Greek population to 8,400 - 10,000 pairs, while only the Strofades Islands colony 
numbers 5,000 - 6,000 pairs and is the biggest colony of Mediterranean Sea (Karris et 
al., 2010). 

Shearwater is a migratory species. Arrives in Mediterranean Sea on March and leaves 
on October. Migrates in long distances and most of the individuals cover distances 
between 15.000 and 35.000 km annually, between two reproductive periods (González-
Solís et al., 2007). The migration take place in regions southern from Equator, during 

MASTER THESIS - MACS - UALG 2017 !8



the winter period of northern hemisphere. Shearwaters travel using the wind forces, 
saving great amount of energy (González-Solís et al., 2007). They spend on average 
80±17 days, in winter regions and 19±10 and 23±7 days for their travel in fall and in 
spring respectively, time that is equivalent with an important percentage of their annual 
cycle. Two of the greatest Shearwater populations, overwinter following the souther 
Brazil and Benguela currents, an important percentage (29%) of the Mediterranean 
population (González-Solís et al., 2007).

Scopoli’s Shearwater is a socially 
monogamic species. Adults (&gt; 5 years) 
visit the land only in order to breed in 
isolated islands, sometimes in dense 
colonies but more often in smaller and 
scattered groups. The age of an 
important percentage species population 
exceeds 20 years according to banding 
(marked birds using a unique numbered 
metal ring) bird trapped in Crete Island, 
indicate that female individuals live more 
than males (Ristow et al., 1991, Ristow et 
al., 1992). They are strictly nocturnal 
birds in their colonies, with the exception 
of the Selvagem Grande colony, where 
they come on land a few hours before 
sunset (Zino 1971). Also they are nesting 
in relatively spacious cavities, without any 
type of defense or natural protection from 
predators (Catry et al., 2006). Before the 

breeding period, males play an important role of securing the nest and spending more 
time keeping it safe (Jouanin et al., 2001), while on the other hand female take the 
responsibility of the egg production. During the incubation period both males and 
females spend the same time during the process by changing shifts (Figure 3). The 

MASTER THESIS - MACS - UALG 2017 !9

Figure 4: Scopoli’s Shearwater chick. Photo by the author



complete fledge of the nestlings begins from 8 - 9 of October and lasts until the last 
week of the same month (Round and Swann 1977), thus the fledging period lasts 83 - 
98 days and is relatively short for such size of seabird. The reproductive period begins 
in March, with the return of adults from the wintering areas in central and southern 
Atlantic (Ristow et al., 2000, Camphuysen and Van der Meer 2001) to the breeding 
colonies. 

The reproductive success is related with the egg size. Bigger eggs produce nestlings 
and complete fledgling juveniles (Figure 4) more frequent than that the small eggs 
(Mougin 1998, Ramos et al., 1997). This shows that a connection exists between 
reproductive characteristics and the physical condition of parents (Ramos et al., 2003). 
Other important characteristic is the reproductive success it is that most casualties are 
taking place during the egg phase, with fledge success be always much higher than the 
hatching success (Ramos et al., 2003). At the end of May, females gives birth an egg 
which fledges for roughly 52 days. The chick hatches in middle of July and fledging until 
the end of October when the migration period starts for the wintering areas. The first 
return of the juveniles in the colony becomes after 4 - 5 years.

The reproduction habitat is the basic parameter that determines the reproductive 
success. The intraspecific competition for the nesting areas is intense in Shearwaters, 
as the high levels of daily presence in the nests show, as well as the territory behavior 
at the period of three months before spawning (Monteiro et al., 1996). The importance 
of maintenance the nesting place and it’s defense, is indicated by the general 
bad physical condition of adult birds (as it appears from their body mass) in the period 
before spawning, something that is usual in species that maintain the same place of 
nesting for years (Monteiro et al., 1996).

1.2 Species Threats

In European level, the species are included in the Part I of European Directive 79/409 
for the protection of wild birds, in Part II on Bern Convention on the conservation of 
European wildlife and natural habitats, while it was also considered as “Vulnerable” 

MASTER THESIS - MACS - UALG 2017 !10



according to European threat regime (BirdLife International 2004a). Globally, the 
species is reported of IUCN  as LC  (Least Concern).1 2

In national level Shearwater has not been counted in the recent publication of Greek   
“Red Book”  of species because is still maintains rather good populations or even have 3

wide distribution in Greek area and thus they do not appear at the present moment to 
face problems of extinction (Legakis and Maragkou 2009).

Anselme and Durand (2012) categorized the basic threats for the species in two main 
levels. That ones that act outside the  reproductive areas (colonies) and the in situ 
threats: In the first category we have those where they have direct or indirect cross-
correlation with piscatorial activities that are taking place in the feeding areas and 
phenomena that are related with climatic changes and pollution cases in the marine 
ecosystem (Stewart et al., 1997). The second category refers to the in situ threats, that 
occur in the species colony. The major predators in land are the European wild cats 
(Felix silvestris), Black rats (Rattus rattus), European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) 
and European pine martens (Martes martes). Also predating pressure can be applied to 
eggs, nestlings and also in adults by other bird species such as the Yellow - legged gull 
(Larus michahellis) and the Eurasian eagle - owl (Bubo bubo) and Peregrines (Falco 
peregrinus). Notable are also the effects of anthropogenic activities such as public 
nuisance, the uncontrolled touristic activity and the lights that turned on during evening 
hours. These have deterrent effects on the adults to visit their nests. Finally, recent 
studies (Karris et al., 2013, Petrella 2011) that took place in Strofades Islands, showed 
that a notable threat is the accidental entrapment (by-catch) of Scopoli’s Shearwaters in 
piscatorial tools, such as trawl line and driftnet.

2. Study area of Strofades Island complex

Strofades (37°15'10.8"N 21°00’24.2”E) are a complex of two small islands in the ionian 
Sea, in Greece. They are located between the southern part of Zakynthos Island and 
the western coasts of Peloponnese (Figure 5). They have an extent of 2,6 km2. The 
bigger and southerner of the two islands is named Stamfani. It is a rocky island with 
length about 1 km. The smaller one is called Arpyia. The islands are 27 nautical miles 
from the southern point of Zakynthos Island and 28 nautical miles from the coasts of 
Peloponnese.

In the highest part of western nesting site is found a light house that was builded during 
20th century and was handled by a lighthouse keeper. Back in time, the islands were  
drowned in vegetation and the monks that where resided, in order to survive, used the 
2/3 of Stamfani Island as farms. They were also breeding ruminant mammals as a food 
source.

Strofades Islands are enlisted in the Important Bird Areas  inventory (IBA) and they 4
have been included in the Corine program as important biotopes and constituting a part 

 Important Bird Area (IBA): Area identified using an internationally agreed set of criteria as being globally important 4
for the conservation of bird populations

of the National Marine Park of Zakynthos Island. These two small islands, that are 
located in Ionian Sea, as two small dots, and are integral part of the Greek natural and 
cultural legacy with special interest and needs of management and environmental 
protection.
The island ecosystem is very rich in species diversity. This can be reflected by the 
different herpetofauna species, such as Lizards (Algyroides moreoticuspoy), Cat snakes 
(Telescopus  fallax) and species that are in protection, such as Sea turtles (Caretta 
caretta), Mediterranean seals (Monachus monachus) and other marine mammals.
Strofades Islands have a very big importance on bird migration. In spring they stop for 
resting thousands of migratory birds that come from Africa. They begin to arrive the 
most interesting birds of Greek avifauna such us the European Bee-eater (Merops 
apiaster), Hoopoe (Upupa epops), Red-backed Shrike (Lanius collurio) and 
Nightingales. Until today they have been observed more than 120 species of birds, 
based on bird banding  projects that taking place every Spring in Stamfani island.5

If somebody in any case wanted to give at an avifauna species symbolic value for 
Strofades Islands, this should be the Scopoli’s Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea), 
which makes it’s nests under dense bushy vegetation near the coasts.
Endemically, Stamfani Island is in the same category as Zakynthos and Cefalonia 
islands. Also, the islands are connected phytogeographical with Peloponnese. The 
forest of Strofades Islands, located in Stamfani island, is unique in Greece and perhaps 
in all Mediterranean Sea. The forestial ecosystem characterized by various bushy 
sclerophyllous species as Oaks (Quercus coccifera), Shrubs (Pistacia lentiscus) and 
olive trees. Is dense in many points and sometimes the sun can not even reach the 
ground. Arpyia island is covered by maquis vegetation covered by Pistacia bushes, 
Myrtles and Olive trees. Also, more than 300 species of plants are located in the 
islands, such as the uncommon orchid of Ionian Islands (Serapias ionica).

3. Metals and Seabirds

Seabirds are widely used to monitor trace element levels due to their wide distribution 
and high position in the food web (Piatt et al. 2007). There is evidence that metal 
concentration levels are increasing in some areas due to human activities (Nriagu 1988; 
Slemr and Langer 1992; Thompson et al., 1992). Toxic metals, even at relatively low 
levels, are known to accumulate in many marine animals, including seabirds, although 

 Bird Banding: Marking birds by applying a metal ring on their tarsus, with a unique number5

MASTER THESIS - MACS - UALG 2017 !13



they have no known biological function (Thompson 1990).From both a biomonitoring 
and toxicological viewpoint it is important to understand the physiological processes and 
dynamics of nonessential metals in the organs and tissues of seabirds (Stewart et al., 
1996).

Table 1 presents combined results from various studies, in support of creating the 
baseline knowledge about the metal concentrations for seabird species. This 
information will be used as a guideline for an estimation of metal concentrations in 
different tissues in comparison to the metal concentrations from the derived results of 
the blood analysis. All the collected information are referring to metal concentrations 
mean values per grams (dry tissue) or deciliter.

Concentrations of metals are often reported for adult birds, but less often for chicks or 
fledglings (Walsh 1990). However, juveniles have been proposed as particularly useful 
indicators for pollution, as they concentrate metals during a specific period of time (i.e. 
hatching to fledging) and from a local and definable foraging area (Walsh 1990). In 
addition, only limited data exist concerning metal levels in seabirds from the Strofades 
Island complex area. One of the aims of this study will be to provide baseline data for 
metal concentration levels in Scopoli’s Shearwater collected in one of the biggest 
colonies in Greece for comparative analyses of inter-specific and geographical 
differences in bioaccumulation.

Lead (Pb)

Is one of the toxic metals that can be found and affect the biological processes of the 
species, which no any known biological requirement in avian species. Pb can be found 
in the Earth’s crust, but in relatively low concentrations. During the Industrial Revolution, 
the use of Pb in many different cases, such as batteries, fossil fuels and smelters, 
resulted the disturbance of Pb-biogeochemical cycle (Eisler 1988, Von Schirnding and 
Fuggle 1996, de Villiers et al., 2010). Environmental broadcasting of Pb residues poses 
a hazard for wildlife species (Eisler 1988, Franson and Pain 2011). Birds can be 
contaminated by Pb by the inhalation and ingestion and is possible to have particles of 
Pb on the feathers, as are spending most of their lives at the breeding grounds 

MASTER THESIS - MACS - UALG 2017 !14



(Gonzalez-Solis et al., 2007). The deposition of contaminants may be particularly 
important in procellariiform species, because they show long breeding seasons and 
relatively short wintering periods (Thompson et al., 1999, Monteiro et al., 1996). The 
effects of Pb in avian species can damage the hematopoietic system and also the 
vascular, nervous, renal, or reproductive system (Kendall and Scanlon 1982, Lumeij 
1985, Burger and Gochfeld 1985, Scheuhammer 1987, Blus et al., 1991, Bakalli et al., 
1995, Jose Rodriguez et al., 2010). Franson and Pain in a study of 2011, divided Pb 
exposure and effects in four different levels. The background level, subclinical level, 
clinical level and severe clinical level. Background exposure conferring to 
concentrations in wider environments far away from emission sources. The other three

levels represent elevated or above background exposure. Subclinical levels can cause 
physiological effects but can not reduce the normal biological functions (Franson and 
Pain 2011).

Cadmium (Cd)

Cadmium (Cd) is also a toxic metal with no known biological requirement in birds. 
During the Industrial Revolution, anthropogenic activities (smelters, fossil fuel uses, 
fertilizers, production of batteries and plastics) altered the natural distribution of Cd 
(Eisler 1985, De Villiers et al., 2010). Cd is less volatile than Pb, so atmospheric 
transport is not of great concern. Fluvial transport is more important and sets a hazard 
to aquatic wildlife species (Eisler 1985, Furness 1996, Wayland and Scheuhammer 
2011). Birds can easily contaminated with Cd by ingestion, than inhalation, and it is also 
possible to have particles on the feathers (Eisler 1985, Furness 1996). 

There are other metals that can be found and monitored in birds, such as Copper (Cu), 
Chromium (Cr), Cobalt (Co), Nickel (Ni), Manganese (Mn) and Zinc (Zn).These are 
essential elements, but may also become toxic, if present in excessively high 
concentrations, as they are accumulated in tissues (Elliott and Scheuhammer, 1997). 
Metal particles can enter on each organism by digestion and transported through the 
food chain. Studies show that seabirds can increase their body metal concentrations 
levels by digesting specific pelagic fish species (Karris et al., 2016).

This study examines metals, with no any biological requirement in seabird organisms, 
that can be toxic in low concentrations (Pb, Cd) and essential  metals that can be toxic if 
present high concentrations (Cu, Cr, Co, Ni, Mn and Zn). All the previously mentioned, 
can be transported through the trophic levels and depending their concentration levels, 
to evaluate the environmental state.

Many studies resulted in that blood can be used to examine recent exposure to metals 
in humans and birds (Subramanian and Meranger 1981, Garcá- Fernández et al., 1996, 
Tirelli et al., 1996, Benito et al., 1999, Van Wyk et al., 2001, Wayland et al., 2001, 
Wilson et al., 2004, Bazzi et al., 2008). In birds, Pb and Cd are absorbed into the 
bloodstream and quickly end up into soft tissues including liver, kidney, bone, and

growing feathers. Also, an exposure by ingestion can give elevated levels in tissues and 
blood (Samuel et al., 1992, Franson and Pain 2011, Wayland and Scheuhammer 2011). 
In 2001 Van Wyk and et al, found similar mean Pb concentrations between blood, brain, 
liver and muscle tissue, by examining African vultures. They concluded that blood can 
be a trustworthy indicator of body charge by metals. Blood sampling can not cause 
death and it’s possible to be applied on live animals. It has to be noted that blood 
sampling is not affecting any of the bird’s vital functions and is not causing any damage 
to its organs. Feathers can be contaminated by external sources, unlike blood sampling. 
These are the reasons why blood sampling is a successful method to monitor toxic 
metals in species.

4. Material and Methods

4.1 Field Sampling

Juvenile and adult Scopoli’s Shearwaters 
were sampled between 2007 and 2014 
from the breeding colony of Strofades 
Islands in southern Ionian Sea, Greece. 
The species colony at the study area 
hosts about 5,500 breeding pairs (Karris 
et al. 2017) and constitutes the largest 
c o l o n y i n e a s t e r n M e d i t e r r a n e a n . 

Sampling took place at Stamfani Island 
during the end of the fledging period (end of September-mid of October) in order to 
sample fledglings as well as adults. Capturing burrowing seabirds is a challenging task. 
They attack in order to defend their nests. Their nests are under boulders and in very 
deep holes, so a hand made catch pole was the best solution. Blood samples were 
collected in three sub-colonies from the western, southern and eastern part of the island 

MASTER THESIS - MACS - UALG 2017 !17

Figure 6: Position of the sampled nests of Stamfani 
Island perimeter. Map by D. Portolou



(Figure 6), where fledglings, breeders and prospectors were captured by hand. 
Permissions for the fieldwork were provided by the local authorities e.g. management 
body of National Marine Park of Zakynthos, National Coastguard Authorities and 
Metropolis of Zakynthos. 

At a first stage, morphometric and weight data were collected per individual. Blood 
sampling was followed by using the main wing vein, while the shearwater was securely 
held. The handler had to extent the wing to expose the main vein for bleeding by the 
sampler. An amount of 0.2-0.5 ml per blood sample was collected using a heparinsed 
syringe and kept in eppendorf vials (1.5 ml) with ethyl alcohol as preservative. A total 
number of 238 samples were collected, from which 182 were from juveniles. After each 
sampling, shearwaters were placed back in their nests. The collected samples were 
placed in boxes with ice and transported at -8Co to the laboratory and stored at -20Co in 
the lab of TEI of Ionian Islands. In September 2016 they were transported to the 
University of Algarve in the same conditions until further analysis. 

4.2 Preparation of samples and laboratory analysis
The process of metal analysis of blood samples involved sample preparation, digestion 
and metal quantification. The digestion was performed using hot plate and the 
quantification of metal content was performed by Graphite furnace atomic absorption 
spectroscopy for the metals: Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and flame atomic adsorption 
spectroscopy for Zn.
The analysis of metals was performed at the chemical laboratory (LaQ) in the University 
of Algarve.

4.2.1 Preparation and acid digestion of samples
?

The total amount of blood samples were transferred into polypropylene digestion tubes 
(50 ml) previously dried at 40 Co for 24h until constant weight and the weight noted. The 
tubes containing the blood samples were then placed in a hot plate (set at 40 Co for 45 

MASTER THESIS - MACS - UALG 2017 !18



minutes, to avoid destroying any bounds of blood 
proteins) to evaporate ethyl alcohol (that was used for 
field preservation  and the dry weight of the blood 
samples were noted. Then 1 mL of concentrated nitric 
acid (HNO3) p.a. was added to each sample that were 

digested at 60 Co for more than one hour (Figure 7).

4.2.2 Quantification 

After the digestion of samples, tubes were diluted up to a 
total volume of 5 ml by adding 0.2% nitric acid solution 
(HNO3  - Milli Q Water). 44 samples were handled at each 
time. The accuracy of the method was verified by 
analyzing duplicates of the same amount of certified 
reference material of blood serum (SeronormTM Trace 
Elements Whole Blood L-1, Sero). Blanks were also 

prepared with and acidified Milli-Q water solution with 
0.2% nitric acid (HNO3) and treated in the same way 
to check for any contamination.. Thereafter, 1ml of 
each sample was transferred trace metal free tubes 
for using graphite furnace atomic absorption 
spectroscopy (AAnalyst 800 - THGA Furnace) 
(Figure 8). Blanks that were placed between every 
10 samples and the detection limit of each metal 
was calculated from the instrument detection limit 
(IDL: Cd 0.0116?g/l, Co 0.2416 ?g/l, Cr 0.1996?g/l, 

Cu 0.2430?g/l, Mn 0.0585?g/l, Ni 0.2098?g/l, Pb 
0.3975?g/l, Zn 2.7820?g/l). To calculate metal concentration a calibration curve using 
commercial standard of metals for atomic absorption measurements (Merck CertiPUR 
Inorganic Mixes) was used. The Analytik Jena nov AA 350 flame atomic adsorption

spectroscopy was used for the analysis of Zn (Figure 9), using internal standards at the 
beginning and the end of the procedure. 

4.3 Statistical Analysis
?

The statistical analyses of the data were conducted using SPSS statistical package 
(IBM Company, Chicago, IL, USA) and Gretl statistical software. Means, standard 
deviations, medians, and ranges of metal concentrations in blood samples were 
calculated per sub-colony and per breeding year. All data were checked for normal 
distribution and if necessary, transformed using logarithm scale to obtain normal 
distribution. More specifically we used a set of four tests (Doornik-Hansen, Shapiro-
Wilk, Lilliefors and Jarque-Bera) so as to check normality of metal concentrations in 
total as well as per breeding season, and to proceed (if this was necessary) to log-
transformation of data to meet model requirements.  Additionally, pairwise correlation 
coefficients (Pearson’s product-moment correlation) was employed in order to obtain 
relevant correlation matrix and identify possible relationships between selected 
variables. One-way ANOVA tests were used to determine significant differences of metal 
concentrations between sub-colonies and breeding years. Concentrations of the metals 
were also compared between different age classes and genders. A Principal 
Component Analysis was also used to relate metal concentration patterns in the blood 
samples from different sub-colonies. Sex determination was based on a polymerase 
chain reaction-based methodology combined with morphometric variables (Karris et al. 
2013). Variables are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD), and significance 
level was set to p &amp;lt;0.05.

Table 2 shows the total number of samples of juveniles and adults per year, season and 
sex used for metal analysis. 
Normality test for all variables resulted that non of them was normal distributed (p&lt;0.05) 
and thus data were transformed using logarithmic scale (log10) to obtain normal 
distribution. 
In Table 3 median and interquartile range (25% - 75%) of metal concentrations in blood 
from all Scopoli’s Shearwater samples are presented. Among the non-essential metals, 
Pb concentrations range between 0.07-0.53 ?g/g, followed by Cd (0.01-0.02 ?g/g). 
Among the essential metals, concentrations of Zn were between 8.84-39.35 ?g/g, 
followed by Cu (1.52-4.99 ?g/g), Cr (0.23-1.81 ?g/g), Ni (0.17-0.82 ?g/g), Mn (0.10-0.44

significant relationship between the weight of individuals and metal concentrations and 
for this reason metal concentrations could be compared between, years, sites and sex. 

5.2 Variation of metal concentrations

Metal concentrations of Scopoli’s Shearwater blood samples during seven breeding 
seasons (2007-2012 and 2014), are presented in Figure 10. All metals showed a 
significant difference with the years. More specific, analysis of variance (one way 
ANOVA) indicated that Cd show a significant difference on 2008 (Figure 10 - I) (one way 
ANOVA, p&amp;lt;0.05). The different racial groups present differentiation in levels in Co for 
the studied years (Figure 10 - K): F(6,76)=5.2341, p&amp;lt;0.05). 2008 was the year that Co 
showed a significant difference (p&amp;lt;0.05). Cr, like cobalt, present different levels for the 
studied years: F(6,184)=10.711, p&amp;lt;0.05 and showed also a significant difference for 
2008 (Figure 10 - L). The same for Cu (Figure 10 - M), were present significant different 
levels for the years: F(6,179)=13.141, p&amp;lt;0.05 and resulted a significant difference for 
2008 (p&amp;lt;0.05). The same statistical test resulted significant differences for Mn: 
(F(6,181)=4.3671, p&amp;lt;0.05) (Figure 10 - N) with the highest levels on 2008, 2012 and 
2014. For Ni (Figure 10 - O) and Pb (Figure 10 - P), one way ANOVA resulted also 
significant difference on 2008: F(6.120)=3.3464, p&amp;lt;0.05 and F(6.72)=5.9136, p&amp;lt;0.05)  
respectively. Lastly, ANOVA test showed that the significant different levels of Zn (Figure 
10 - Q) with the years were with 2008, 2009 and 2014: F(6.133)=9.0067, p=0.00 (p 
&lt;0.05). Highest concentrations were in 2008 for all metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu and Pb 
(Figure 10 - I, K, L, M, O, P)), except for Zn, were the highest concentration was in 
2009, followed by 2014 and 2008 and Mn, were the highest concentration was in 2014.

Figure 11 presents the distribution of metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) in 
blood of adult and juvenile Scopoli’s Shearwaters according to sex. Statistical results 
indicate significant sexual differences for Cd, (Figure 11 A’), Co (Figure 11 B’), Mn 
(Figure 11 E’), Pb (Figure 11 G’) and Zn (Figure 11 H’) for both juveniles and adults, (T-
test, p&amp;lt;0.05). Regarding Cr (Figure 11 C’) significant differences exist on gender for 
adults and juveniles, with the higher concentrations on male juveniles and female adult 
birds. For Cu (Figure 11 D’) only juveniles show significantly difference with slightly 
higher concentrations on males (t-test, p&amp;lt;0.05). Ni (Figure 11 F’) levels were also 
significantly different with gender for juveniles (t-test, p&amp;lt;0.05) and adults (t-test, p 
&lt;0.05), were metal concentrations in female juveniles were higher than in males while in 
the adults it was the opposite with metal levels in male adults were higher than females.

5.4 Spatial variation of metal concentrations

Figure 12 presents the distribution of metal concentrations (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb 
and Zn) in Scopoli’s Shearwater blood samples between the two breeding sites/sub-
colonies on Stamfani Island. The results showed significant differences for most of the 
tested metals (Cd (Figure 12 A), Co (Figure 12 B), Cr (Figure 12 C), Mn (Figure 12 E), 
Ni (Figure 12 F), Pb (Figure 12 G), Zn (Figure 12 H) for nesting sites (t-test, p&amp;lt;0.05)). 
The only exception was for Cu (Figure 12 D), were no statistical significant differences 
were found (t-test, p &gt;0.05). Concentrations of Cd were higher on the western part for 
juvenile and adults. Co concentrations were also higher on western area, with much 
higher levels at West than South for adults. On the opposite, Cr and Cu concentrations 
were higher in southern sub-colony. For Mn, concentrations were similar among sites, 
but higher in adults from the western part. Levels of Ni, Pb and Zn were higher in the 
southern sub-colony for juveniles, but much higher on adult birds that breed on the 
western part. A table with the results of the T-test (P2) is given in Annex session.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were used to detect the relationships between 
metal concentrations (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn), year, sex and site of for juvenile 
and adult birds from Strofades Island colony. Results of PCA showed that they 
represent 34.82% of variance with PC1 representing (18.76%) and PC2 (16.05%). 
Figure 13, shows the distribution of metal levels, according to the two principal 
components (Table 4 explains the symbols that appear on Figure 13). PC1 (18.76%), 
which is the most important component, indicates a negative relationship between Pb 
and Cr with the rest of the metals. PC2 (16.05%) indicates that the distribution of Cd 
and Zn is opposite (in the negative part of PC2) to Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni and Pb. 
Furthermore, PC1 relates strongly with Mn (r=0.554) and Zn (r=0.420) (Table A.1 in 
Annex) and PC2 with Cr (r=0.599) (Table A.1 in Annex). PCA indicated that in 2007, Zn 
and Co had negative distribution, based on PC1 (38.90%) and Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, and 
Pb have a positive distribution, opposite to Co and Zn. The non-essential metals are 
negatively related with Zn and Co, with a small differentiation with the rest of the metals 
(see A1 in Annex). In most of the individuals Zn and Co are the dominant metals and the 
distribution of these metals is negatively related with the levels of the rest metals. Based 
on the second principal component (17.46%), the essential metals (Zn, Co, Ni and Mn) 
are negatively correlated with the non-essential metals (Pb, Cd).
In 2008, based on the PC1 (19.96%), Pb and Cr have a negative relationship with the 
rest of the metals. The PC2 (16.80%) describes the negatively relationship of Cu and 
Co with Pb, Cr, Zn, Mn and Cd (see A2 in Annex). Also PC2 describes the differences 
between age in which Juveniles had highest relationship with Cu and Co, than adults.
For the year 2009, the results from PC1 (33.23%) show that the non-essential metals 
(Pb and Cd) have a negative relationship with the rest of the metals. Juveniles had 
higher correlation of Pb and Cd, based on PC1, than adults. Also male individuals from 
Western part of the island had highest relationship with Pb. On the other hand, males 
and females are highly related with Ni, Cr, Co, Cu (see A3 in Annex). The results from 
PC2 (20.80%) show a high correlation of Cd and Mn. For Zn, Co and Co the 
relationship was very small.  Cu and Pb levels were highly related with PC2 and 
negatively related with Cd and Mn (A3 in Annex).

MASTER THESIS - MACS - UALG 2017 !28



PC1 (44.48%) for 2010, shows that Zn and Cd levels are opposite with the rest of the 
tested metals. Generally from all the individuals, Zn and Cd showed to have the highest 
response. Juveniles were highly related with Zn and Cd, based on PC1, than with adults 
(see A4 in Annex). PC2 (19.01%) show that Mn, Cu and Cr had lower relationships and 
opposite of Zn and Cd. On PC2 the relationship with Ni, Co and Pb were higher.
In 2011 Zn was the only metal that had a negative relationship compared with the other 
metals, based on PC1 (34.14%). Juveniles had higher relationship with Zn and Cu than 
adults. Females from western and southern area were related more with Zn (see A5 in 
Annex). PC2 (18.39%) resulted a very small relationship between Cr, Cu, Zn and Mn. 
Higher relationships were with Cd, Co (positive related) and Ni, Pd (negative related)
2012 was the year with the least of differentiation based on PC1 (40.38%). Most of the 
juveniles did not show any relationship with the metals. Females were the individuals 
with the highest relationship with all the metals (see A6 in Annex). PC2 (16.12%) 
resulted in a negative and strong relationship between Cr, Cu, Pb and positive 
relationship with Zn and Co. Cd, Ni and Mn had lower relationship with PC2.
Finally, for 2014, PC1 (23.98%) resulted that Pb and Cd were stronger related with each 
other and negatively related with Cu, Mn and Zn. The rest of the metals (essential 
metals) were positively related and opposite of the non-essential metals., Ni and Cr had 
different response with the rest of the metals. Correlations between Zn, Co and Mn 
were higher in juveniles. Females from the western part of the island were related with 
the non- essential metals and Cr (see A7 in Annex). In PC2 (21.50%), only Cr has an 
opposite relationship with the other metals.

6. Discussion

Marine birds as top consumers are particularly vulnerable by spatially and temporally 
defined threats such as marine pollution. They are exposed to a wide range of 
chemicals and other forms of marine pollution because they depend exclusively on the 
marine environment where they face toxic risk by external contact, inhalation, and 
particularly ingestion of food and water. 
Scopoli’s shearwater is a long-lived migratory pelagic Procellariiform species with high 
rates of nest tenacity and mate fidelity, and exploits persistent productive marine areas. 
It is a surface feeder, consuming pelagic fish mainly, at least during incubation and the 
chick-rearing period (Afán et al. 2014). Recent findings have shown that this seabird 
adopts a dual strategy, feeding on epipelagic shelf prey in shallow waters during short 
trips and on oceanic prey items, normally associated with different water masses, during 
long trips (Cecere et al. 2013).  Shearwaters feed on a range of different fish but also on 
specific cephalopods such as European squids (Alonso et al. 2012, Neves et al. 2012). 
According on the results of Karris et al. (2015), bottom trawler fishery operations in the 
study area provide significant amounts of benthopelagic prey species to shearwaters 
during their pre-laying period in spring. This alternative food supply can be 
characterized as normally unavailable due to the foraging ecology of Scopoli’s 
shearwater and, as a consequence, may affect the population dynamics of local 
colonies and specifically the Strofades population. Analysis of metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, 
Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn) in the blood (Table 3) showed that concentrations were in general lower 
compared with metal levels in blood of other similar seabird species (Table 1). No 
significant relationship was detected between the weight of individuals and  metal levels 
(correlation matrix with the total amount of samples), for adult and juveniles, which 
allowed us to compare metals levels with years, age of the birds and breeding site. This 
is in contrast with other studies on Shearwaters (Chihiro et al. 2017) were a strong 
correlation of body weight with cadmium was found. This was the result that chicks 
mainly eat small fish and later change their diet to squids or to other organisms 
containing high Cd levels so they accumulate more of this metal, because of bigger

prey. According with recent studies for morphometrics and sex dimorphism on Scopoli’s 
Shearwater on Strofades colony (Karris et al. 2013), the morphometrics is not changing 
from juveniles to adults. Combining the information of these two studies we can assume 
that Scopoli’s Shearwaters does not change their diet as they grow and they eat the 
same species of fishes and squids.
 
PCA analysis resulted A positive relationship of Cd and Zn, was observed supported by 
PCA analysis (Figure 13) which was consistent with previous reports (Chihiro et al. 
2017). These metals are expected to interact with a detoxification system, such as 
metallothionein (MT), a low molecular weight cysteine-rich protein involved in the 
homeostasis of essential metals, such as Zn. The synthesis of MT can be induced by 
several metals, such as Cd, Zn and Cu. Zn is essential for the synthesis of MT. When 
Cd is taken up, Zn in MT is replaced with Cd to achieve detoxification. It was reported 
that Cd and MT concentrations are positively related in many seabirds (Eliot et al. 1992; 
Stewart et al. 1996). High accumulation of Cd induces the synthesis of.
According to the present results (Table 3), blood levels of cadmium in Scopoli’s 
Shearwater are similar to levels from other blood seabird species. Concentrations of 
cadmium varied in from 0.01-0.02 ?g/g, compared with other seabirds such as in Marion 
Island, South Africa (0.04 ?g/g - 0.304 ?g/g) (Summers et al. 2014). However, cadmium 
concentrations on Strofades colony were found in low values if we compare with 
maximum levels set out by the European community, for foodstuff contaminants (0.1 
mg/g) (European Commission Regulation, 2006). Differences in cadmium levels, 
compared with other studies, can be related with various factors such as the region, the 
productivity of the marine ecosystem, the season of sampling, but also the use of 
different analytical processes used, the sampling method and also the environmental 
contamination (Galitsopoulou, 2014).
Another aspect of the current study was the variation of metal levels throughout different 
breeding seasons. Cadmium concentrations were higher in 2008, in relation with other 
years (Figure 1). Sex differentiation of cadmium concentrations were also detected. The 
males had higher cadmium concentrations, in relation with females, for both juveniles 
and adults and juvenile birds showed significant higher cadmium levels than adults 

MASTER THESIS - MACS - UALG 2017 !32



(Figure 2A. 11A) indicating that cadmium accumulation depends on the age and gender. 
There is a possibility that the food are different between males and females, and it 
causes the differences of metal accumulation (Chihiro et al. 2017). Pawel et al (2000) 
showed that juvenile Black-headed Gulls had always higher cadmium levels compared 
with adults. Zn levels  were also significantly higher (Figure 11 - H’) in juveniles. 
The western part of Strofades Island had higher cadmium concentrations (Figure 12 - 
A). This may be the result of different foraging distribution pattern between birds that 
breed in different sub areas of Stamfani Island, but this has to be proved by using 
remote sensing techniques on adult birds that breed in the western part that seem to 
use different feeding areas than the birds of southern part.
The number of samples was relatively similar, except from the Eastern region, where 
the ground morphology difficult the sampling process and the amount of samples were 
very small and were not taken into account on the data analysis. According to previous 
studies, in the Adriatic sea no relation between cadmium levels and the sampling area 
was detected (Desideri et al., 2010). In contrast Pastor et al. (1994) in western 
Mediterranean, found that cadmium concentration  was influenced by foraging area and 
that increased concentrations were observed in coastal piscatorial areas with significant 
industrial activity and assembled urban population. Different factors that may influence 
metal concentrations in feeding areas, like the existence of river flows and also 
incidents of direct industrial rejections within urban waste, without any actions of correct 
environmental management (Topcuo?lu et al., 2002). Another important parameter that 
can have an impact on the metal concentrations is the season of foraging activity by the 
adults-breeders. Food provision to nestlings begins from mid July just after egg 
hatching, up to few days before fledgling (late September-early October).
The months with increased cadmium concentrations in ichthyofauna in Eastern 
Mediterranean are September, October and November (Galitsopoulou, 2014). The 
effect of seasonal foraging activity in the accumulation of cadmium is attributed, mainly 
on physiologic differentiations of fish catches, throughout year (Özden, 2013.
There is a substantial body of literature describing the effects of lead contamination on 
seabird behavior and physiology (Burger and Gochfeld 2000). Lead is an anthropogenic 

MASTER THESIS - MACS - UALG 2017 !33



contaminant that has no biological function and can be transported by great distances 
atmospherically (Nriagu 1989 and Burger 1993).
Concentrations of lead in the blood of the birds range between 0.07-0.53 ?g/g, 
comparatively with other seabird species colonies, such as in Marion Island (0.034 ?g/g 
- 0.138 ?g/g) (Summers et al. 2014). The levels of lead concentration were in some 
cases higher than maximum levels set out by the European community, for foodstuff 
contaminants (0.3 mg/g) (European Commission Regulation, 2006), that are expressed 
in Table 3 on results. Levels from other studies of different marine species in the same 
region (Galitsopoulou, 2014) show that Pb levels didn’t exceed 0.297 ?g/g of sample. It 
is a possibility for an indication for contamination.
Lead concentrations were higher than cadmium. This observation is in agreement with 
previous results of related seabirds spread around different colonies, where lead 
concentrations showed significant differences in comparison with cadmium (Summers et 
al.2014, Bond et al., 2010). Statistical analysis indicate significant higher levels of lead 
for the breeding season of 2008. In contrast with cadmium concentration, lead was 
higher in birds from the southern sector. This may be explained by possible difference in 
foraging distribution pattern in comparison with those of the western sector. Higher 
concentration of lead was also found on juveniles compared to adults of southern 
sector. This can result the assumption that birds breeding on the southern sector are 
searching for food in more lead contaminated areas that birds form the western sector.
Essential elements are present in all living organisms and necessary for regulation of 
body functions and are usually maintained by homeostasis mechanisms, which act in 
the removal of excess and maintenance of normal body concentrations (Kim and Oh, 
2013).  Not significant correlation levels of essential metals  with body mass may reflect 
that Shearwaters, when compared with other birds, may use less energy by keeping 
lower metabolic rates (Colwell, 2010) and ingest lower prey mass. Kim et al. (1996) 
resulted that essential metal that their levels are not correlated with body mass reflected 
by low pollution levels (Cr, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Zn) in their habitats.
Concentrations of cobalt, chromium, copper, manganese and nickel (Table 3) were 
much lower compared to other colonies of related seabird species (Table 1). 2008 was 
the year with significant higher levels for these metals (Figure 10 K - Figure10 O), with 

MASTER THESIS - MACS - UALG 2017 !34



an exception of Mn that showed high values also on 2012 and 2014 (Figure 10 - N). 
Differences for all these metals were found between age and gender (Figure 11 B’ - F’) 
and also between the different breeding sectors (Figure 12 B F). This can be a result of 
the different metal levels on feeding areas.
Zinc levels (8.84-39.35 ?g/g) were low compared to other seabird species and also from 
shearwaters, breeding in different colonies (Table 1) (Stewart et al., 1996; Stewart et al., 
1997; Eliot et al., 1992; Bond et al., 2010). High zinc concentrations are probably due to 
metabolic requirements during the process of fledging (Pawel et al. 2000). It has been 
shown experimentally with poultry that high zinc levels are needed for feather growth, 
and indeed deficiency in zinc causes a frayed feather condition (Sunde 1972) and as 
was expected, juveniles showed significant higher levels of zinc, compared with adult 
birds (Figure 11 - H’). There were differences on Zn levels between birds from the two 
sub-colonies of Stamfani Island, were the birds from the western sector have significant 
higher concentrations for juvenile and also adult birds (Figure 12 - H). We assumed that 
these metal variations could be attributed to different foraging distribution pattern 
followed by breeders of the two sub-colonies during the whole breeding season. 
Consequently, the separated feeding areas that birds may use for minimizing 
intraspecific competition for food resources are possibly characterized by different 
contamination regime. This assumption have to be verified with further tracking studies 
on breeders foraging flights combined with metal concentration analysis on their diet 
items captured within their main foraging areas.
Further work on Scopoli’s Shearwater diet would be required for a more detailed 
analysis to explain the metal concentrations found in the present study. Also, further 
studies on chick’s diet including analysis of regurgitations could give more information 
on the dynamics and accumulation of metals in these shearwaters. This, in turn, would 
allow a greater insight into the baseline levels of metals which in a relatively unpolluted 
environment such as the remote Strofades Island complex.

7. Conclusions

We examined a variety of metals in blood of juvenile and adults Scopoli’s Shearwaters 
birds from the Southern Ionian Sea breeding area. The current blood metal levels 
indicate than in general, shearwaters are not at great risk, although our toxicological 
knowledge regarding many elements is insufficient to draw firm conclusions. Scopoli’s 
Shearwaters did not have high blood concentrations of Cd and Pb and also of non toxic 
metals. Further research is needed to determine the contribution of contaminants in the 
organs and do a correlation with feeding areas.
