Abstract

A count was made of unhatched eggs and hatchling live and dead Podocnemis expansa turtles in 327 natural nests 
located on the beaches of the Environmental Protection Area (EPA) Meanders of the Araguaia River, to determine 
the percentage of hatching (94.63%), non-hatching (5.37%), survival (94.24%) and hatchling mortality (5.76%), and 
the average percentage of dead hatchlings during the 15 days in the nursery (0.97%). The mean number of hatchlings 
per nest was determined from the sum of the number of live and dead hatchlings divided by the total number of nests, 
while the mean number of eggs per nest was determined from the sum of live and dead hatchlings and unhatched eggs 
divided by the number of nests. These calculations yielded the following mean values: live hatchlings (88.98 ± 23.94), 
dead hatchlings (0.37 ± 0.93), unhatched eggs (5.07 ± 9.57), and total number of eggs (94.42 ± 21.30). The reproductive 
efficiency of the wild population of P. expansa can be affected by many environmental factors such as temperature, 
humidity and rainfall. In addition, man-made factors like the presence of chemicals in the water and the potential for 
infectious disease also have significant impact. The reproductive indices data obtained from this study are indispensable 
for future investigations of hatching anomalies.

Keywords: hatching, nests, reproduction, reptile, survival.

Índices reprodutivos em ninhos naturais de tartarugas da Amazônia

Resumo

Realizou-se a contagem dos ovos não eclodidos, dos filhotes vivos e mortos de Podocnemis expansa oriundos de 
327 ninhos naturais, localizados nas praias da Área de Proteção Ambiental (APA) – Meandros do Rio Araguaia, 
onde se determinou a porcentagem de eclosão dos ovos (94,63%); não eclosão (5,37%); sobrevivência (94,24%) e 
mortalidade dos filhotes (5,76%), e a média de filhotes mortos durante os 15 dias no berçário (0,97%). A média do total 
de filhotes por ninho foi determinada pela soma do número de filhotes vivos e mortos divididos pelo total de ninhos, 
enquanto que a média do total de ovos por ninho foi determinada pela soma do número de filhotes vivos, mortos e ovos 
não eclodidos divididos pelo total de ninhos. Com isso, obtiveram-se os valores médios do número de filhotes vivos 
(88,98 ± 23,94); mortos (0,37 ± 0,93); ovos não eclodidos (5,07 ± 9,57), e total de ovos (94,42 ± 21,30). A eficiência 
reprodutiva da população selvagem de P. expansa pode ser afetada por muitos fatores ambientais, como temperatura, 
umidade e precipitação. Além disso, fatores influenciados pelo homem, como a presença de produtos químicos na 
água e a possibilidade de doenças infecciosas, também têm impacto significativo. Os dados dos índices reprodutivos 
obtidos neste estudo são indispensáveis para futuras investigações de anomalias de incubação.

1. Introduction

The nesting behaviour of the giant Amazon river turtle 
comprises seven phases: aggregation of the population in 
shallow waters close to the nesting beach; climb up the 
beach to sunbathe during the warm hours of the day; climb 
up the beach at night to scout and select the nesting site; 
excavation of the nest; egg laying; backfilling and tamping 
the egg chamber; and return to the water (Vanzolini, 1967; 
Alho et al., 1979; Alho and Pádua, 1982a).

The reproduction of the family Podocnemididae depends 
on the annual flooding and ebbing cycle, with egg-laying 
and incubation occurring in the dry season and hatching 
coinciding with the onset of rising rivers (Alho and Pádua, 
1982a; Fachín-Terán, 1992; Thorbjarnarson et al., 1993). 
The onset of falling water levels appears to be the stimulus 
that triggers the migration of female Podocnemis expansa 
to the nesting site, since adults are found in lakes during 
the flood period and aggregated in rivers in the dry season 
(Alho and Pádua, 1982a,b).

Although the status of natural populations is unknown, 
the basis of turtle preservation activities involves nest and 
hatchling protection and management (Crouse et al., 1987), 
since predation pressure occurs mainly in these phases of 
the life cycle of these reptiles (Grand and Beissinger, 1997).

According to Gibbons (1970), for aquatic chelonians, 
the path from the nest to the water represents their main 
battle for survival, for hatchlings are at their most vulnerable 
along this trajectory, where they may be attacked by a 
variety of predators.

In view of the above information, the objective of 
this study was to determine the percentage of hatched and 
unhatched eggs, hatchling survival and mortality, and the 
average number of live and dead hatchlings, unhatched 
eggs and total number of eggs of P. expansa from natural 
nests in the Environmental Protection Area (EPA) of 
Meanders of the Araguaia River, state of Goiás, Brazil.

2. Material and Methods

Under SISBIO (System of Authorization and Information 
about Biodiversity) permit number 13447, the P. expansa 
nesting beaches in the Meanders of the Araguaia river EPA 
(13° 17’ 49.0” S and 50° 36’ 16.5” W until 13° 30’ 00.0” S 
and 50° 43’ 29.51” W), located in district of Luiz Alves, 
municipality of São Miguel do Araguaia, Goiás State, 
Brazil, were labelled with signs in alphabetical order 
(Figure 1) in the second half of September 2008. 

The beaches were monitored daily in the morning to 
detect and identify egg-laying during the previous night, 
using numbered stakes (Figure 2). This work was concluded 
in the first half of October of the same year, when all the 
females had spawned, making a total of 327 nests.

Opening of the nests began in the second half of 
November and ended in the second half of December 2008. 
The hatchlings were removed from the egg chambers and 
counted only when they were considered “mature”, i.e., 
when their vitellus was completely absorbed (Figure 3). 

Each beach was identified with a sign and each nest 
was also marked with a identification number and the date 
of hatching. This information was consolidated in a spread 
sheet. Also recorded in the spread sheet was the number 
of live hatchlings, dead hatchlings and unhatched eggs. 

The hatchlings removed from the egg chambers were 
taken to a nursery located at the headquarters of the Projeto

Reproductive indices in natural nests of turtles

Quelônios da Amazônia (Amazonia Chelonia Project) of 
the Meanders of the Araguaia river EPA, where they were 
kept for 15 days to lose their egg odor, after which they 
were released on the riverbank.

The total number of hatchlings was determined by 
adding up the live and dead hatchlings, while the total 
number of eggs was determined by adding the live and 
dead hatchlings and the unhatched eggs. The hatchlings 
released on the riverbank were the ones that survived the 
15 days in the nursery.

The data were evaluated from mean values and standard 
deviation.

3. Results

A total of 29,538 live hatchlings were collected from 
the nests and after the two-week period in the nursery, 
29,251 were released on the banks of the Araguaia, 
representing a mortality rate of 0.97% in the nursery. 
Hatched eggs represented 94.63% and unhatched eggs 
94.63%, while survival and mortality rates were 94.24 
and 5.76%, respectively. Oil eggs were not observed in 
the evaluated nests.

The mean values found per nest were: live hatchlings 
(88.98 ± 23.94), dead hatchlings (0.37 ± 0.93), unhatched 
eggs (5.07 ± 9.57) and total number of eggs (94.42 ± 21.30), 
as indicated in Table 1.

4. Discussion

Valle et al. (1973) and Alho et al. (1979) verified 
some P. expansa nests presented up to 5 abnormal eggs. 
Abnormalities included absence of embryo, diameter 
greater than 5 cm and eggs with content intact even after 
incubation period. Eggs with these abnormalities are 
referred to as oil eggs (Alho et al., 1979). The shape of 
oil eggs can be elliptical, spherical, oval and even similar 
to the shape of a bowling pin (Molina and Gomes, 1998).

According to Hirth (1980) the marine chelonias 
spawning nests present abnormal eggs in the superficial 
layer of the nest, suggesting they are intended as sacrifice to 
satiate predators. But Krause et al. (1982) found abnormal 
eggs in both in the superficial and interior layers of 
Trachemis dorbignyi (water tiger) nests suggesting the 
distribution aids the conservation of the nest microclimate. 
In the present study, oil eggs were not observed in the 
evaluated nests to support or refute the previous studies. 

The mean total number of eggs and of dead hatchlings 
per female were lower than those reported by Lima 

(2007) at the Tabuleiro do Abufari, state of Amazonas, 
between 1998 and 2004, which were 106.70 ± 28.38 and 
4.00 ± 9.50, respectively. However, the mean number of 
live hatchlings and the hatching rate in the Meanders of 
the Araguaia River EPA were higher than those found 
by the aforementioned author, who reported values of 
66.00 ± 39.70 and 77.80%.

In studies conducted by Malvásio et al. (2005) in the 
Javaés river, state of Tocantins, the mean number of eggs 
per nest was higher (109.89 ± 19.37) than in the present 
study, although similar values (91.5) were found by Alho 
and Pádua (1982b) in the Trombetas river, state of Pará.

The high standard deviation in the number of dead 
hatchlings and unhatched eggs found in this study was 
attributed to the total loss of five nests (Figure 4). This loss 
was caused by the low level of these nests in relation to the 
water sheet of the Araguaia River, which resulted in their 
partial inundation, altering the proper humidity coefficient 
for embryo development. According to Alho and Pádua 
(1982b), the sudden and unpredictable flooding (swell of 
rising water) of the Trombetas river in 1980 eliminated 
99% of the embryos, while the normal hatching rates in 
previous years was, on average, 95%. 

Even at risk of inundation, the five nests of this study 
were not translocated. According to Lustosa (2008, 
personal observation), no relevant alterations were found in 
hatching and hatchling survival rates after handling several 
egg chambers, but the number of malformed hatchlings 
was considerably higher than among non-handled nests. 
Valenzuela et al. (1997) stated that translocating eggs 
may also interfere in determining the sex of hatchlings,

which is directly related to the temperature of incubation. 
Malvásio et al. (2005) found that handling P. expansa 
eggs and exposing them to variations in temperature and 
humidity may interfere in the formation of the embryo. 
These authors reported that handling involving measuring 
and rotating of eggs interferes negatively in the hatching 
rate. Moreover, such handling may lead to predation of 
turtle embryos by fly larvae introduced accidentally into 
the egg chamber (Pezzuti, 1998).

Salera Júnior et al. (2009) observed that on their journey 
to the water, newly hatched P. expansa turtles are attacked 
predominantly by birds of the genus Coragyps and the 
species Polyborus plancus, which engage in individual 
or group aerial attacks, capturing hatchlings close to 
their nests. These authors also observed that the species 
Jabiru mycteria and Mycteria americana, which are larger, 
swallow the hatchlings whole, while the smaller species 
such as Coragyps atratus devour them in pieces, leaving 
only the empty shell on the sand. This fact demonstrates 
the importance of capturing hatchlings while they are still 
in their egg chambers, as the team of the Chico Mendes 
Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio) does to 
mitigate the predation rate. 

The most common predators of P. expansa eggs and 
hatchlings are the black-headed vulture (Coragyps atratus), 
the red-headed vulture (Cathartes aura), the lesser yellow-
headed vulture (Cathartes burrovianus), the carcara 
plancus (Polyborus plancus), the yellow-headed caracara 
(Mivalgo chimachima), the jabiru stork (Jabiru mycteria), 
the wood stork (Mycteria americana), the maguari 
stork (Ciconia maguari) and the great white egret 
(Casmerodius albus) (Salera Júnior et al., 2009). These 
authors also found mild predation by the tegu lizard 
(Tupinambis teguixin), the ring-tailed coati (Nasua nasua), 
crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous), cocoi heron (Ardea cocoi), 
snowy egret (Egretta thula) and the rufescent tiger-heron 
(Tigrisoma lineatum).

Piranhas of the genus Serrasalmus spp. stand out as 
aquatic predators of hatchling turtles (Salera Júnior et al., 
2009), but other predators may be frogs (Buffo sp.), 
caimans (Paleosuchus spp., Caiman crocodilus) and 
carnivorous fish such as long-whiskered catfish (Pimelodidae), 
red-tailed catfish (Phractocephalus hemiliopterus), 
silver arowana (Osteoglossum bicirrhosum), piraiba 
(Brachyplatystoma filamentosum) and jau (Paulicea luetkeni) 
(Ibama, 1989). 

Cantarelli and Herde (1989) and Andrade (2004) state 
that hatchlings should be kept in nurseries for periods of up 
to 15 days, sufficient time for hardening of the carapace, 
umbilical cicatrisation and elimination of the characteristic 
strong odor of the fat of the egg. This procedure hinders 
predation by natural enemies and increases the chances of 
survival of hatchlings, thus justifying keeping them for 15 
days in the nursery of the Meanders of the Araguaia river 
EPA in order to reduce predation pressure.

According to Crouse et al. (1987), the phase of life 
of chelonians to be prioritized in management programs 
for threatened populations has still not been defined. 

Crouse et al. (1987) and Brooks et al. (1991) stated that, from 
the demographic viewpoint, there is no point in focusing 
on the protection of eggs and hatchlings. However, Grand 
and Beissinger (1997) claim that both conservation and 
recovery of native populations depend on the protection 
of nests and hatchlings, since predation pressure occurs 
mainly in these phases of the life cycle of these animals. 
Therefore, the conservation and management programmes 
conducted by ICMBio at the Meanders of the Araguaia 
river EPA are of fundamental importance for the recovery 
and preservation of the natural populations of P. expansa 
in the state of Goiás, Brazil.

In general, excessive management of the reproductive 
process of chelonians can impair the trophic chain and 
interfere in the population dynamics of other species 
existing at a location, insofar as it changes the availability 
of food, and is therefore not recommended. 

The reproductive efficiency of the wild population of 
P. expansa can be affected by many environmental factors 
such as temperature, humidity and rainfall. In addition, 
men-maid factors like the presence of chemical in the 
water and the potential for infectious disease also have 
significant impact. The reproductive indices data obtained 
from this study are indispensable for future investigations 
of hatching anomalies.
