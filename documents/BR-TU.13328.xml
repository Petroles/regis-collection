Resumo A metalurgia do pó é uma indústria vin
ada no fabri
o de 
omponentes

de metal duro. Este tipo de indústria tem a 
ara
terísti
a de produzir

peças de elevada 
omplexidade através de pó metáli
o. Nos vários estágios

que 
ara
teriza a metalurigia do pó, dois são essen
iais: o pro
esso de


ompa
tação e o pro
esso de sinterização. No pro
esso de 
ompa
tação,

a preo
upação está em produzir um 
orpo poroso, em que tenha as 
ara
-

teristi
as me
âni
as ideias para prosseguir para o estágio de sinterização.

Assim, a 
ompa
tação de pós metáli
os pode ser simulada re
orrendo a

modelos 
ontínuos elasto-plásti
os adoptados da me
âni
a dos solos. Estes

modelos são normalmente implementados em 
ódigo de elementos ?nitos

e são usados para investigar as propriedades me
âni
as do pó durante

a 
ompa
tação. No presente estudo demonstra-se o 
omportamento do

?uxo do pó metáli
o, um aglomerado de aço inóxidável, que é des
rito

pelo modelo modi?
ado elasto-plásti
o Dru
ker/Prager-Cap desenvolvido

para apli
ações em pó. O 
ódigo de elementos ?nitos 
om o modelo

Dru
ker/Prager-Cap foi usado para modelar os estágios de 
ompressão

e des
ompressão da 
ompa
tação do pó. Os parametros usados no

modelo Dru
ker/Prager-Cap foram obtidos da literatura. Este modelo foi

implementado 
om a sub-rotina UVARM e a densidade relativa no ?nal

do estágio de 
ompa
tação foi previsto. No estágio de sinterização, o

obje
tivo prin
ipal é obter um 
orpo denso. Assim, foi implementado um

modelo pre
iso no programa de simulação numéri
a que é ne
essário para

representar o pro
esso e?

omportamentos de densi?

Abaqus. Esta abordagem é baseada em teorias 
ontínuas de deformações

de elasti
as e vis

a
tualizada durante a simulação. Cres

a e outros fa
tores heterogéneos são também


onsiderados durante a simulação. Apli

Abstra
t Powder metallurgy is a well establish industry in the produ
tion of hard

metal referen
e industry amongst metalli
 
omponents industries. This type

of industry has the quality of produ
ing pie
es with high 
omplexity through

metalli
 powder. Powder metallurgy, in the many steps that 
hara
terizes,

there is two major steps: the 
ompa
tion pro
ess and the sintering pro
ess.

In the 
ompa
tion pro
ess, the major 
on
ern is in produ
ing a porous

body, the green 
ompa
t, whi
h me
hani
 
hara
teristi
s are the ideal for

pro
eeding to the sintering stage. Therefore, the 
ompa
tion of metalli

powders 
an be simulated using phenomenologi
al elasto-plasti
 
ontinuum

models adapted from soils me
hani
s. These models are typi
ally imple-

mented in ?nite element 
odes and are used to investigate the ma
ros
opi

property distributions in powders during 
ompa
tion. The present study

demonstrates the ?ow behaviour of a metalli
 powder, an agglomerated

stainless steel, that is des
ribed by the modi?ed Dru
ker-Prager/
ap

elasto-plasti
ity model developed for powder appli
ations. A 
ommer
ial

?nite element 
ode implementing the Dru
ker-Prager/Cap model was used

to model the 
ompression and de
ompression stages of powder 
ompa
tion.

The parameters used in the Dru
ker-Prager/Cap model were obtained from

the literature. This model was implemented with a user subroutine UVARM

and the relative density at the end of the 
ompa
tion stage was predi
ted.

In the sintering stage, the main goal is to obtain a full dense body. There-

fore, an implementation of an a

urate sintering model into a ?nite element

simulation program is ne
essary for representing the pro
ess e?
ien
y.

The densi?
ation and 
reep behaviour of stainless steel powder during free

sintering was simulated and the material model was implemented by linking

the CREEP subroutine to the Abaqus ?nite element 
ode. This approa
h

is based upon the 
ontinuum theories of elasti
 and non-linear-vis
ous de-

formation of porous bodies. The porosity is updated during the simulation.

Grain growth, gravity, thermal expansion, thermal 
ondu
tivity, and other

heterogeneous fa
tors are also 
onsidered during the simulation. Appli
ation

in an axysimmetri
 model is made and simulation results of axial shrinkage

and density distribution is dis
ussed after sintering.

Introduction

1.1 The Powder Metallurgy Process

From a couple of years to now, powder metallurgy (PM) has become one of the most
widely used manufacturing technique in the metallurgy industry. The potential of this
manufacturing technique is the possibility to manufacture complex parts with tight tol-
erances in an economical manner, especially for metals with high melting points and
high hardness levels [1].

PM is a processing technique that involves the production of metal powders and
conversion of these powders into engineered components. The steps of the typical process
involve powder compaction in rigid dies and then heating of the compacted powder to
bond the particles together. At the beginning, the powder starts as a fluid-like substance,
where it is neither a liquid nor a strict solid [2].

In the compaction stage, the metal powder flows into a die cavity at room tempera-
ture and is physically pressed in the die leading to the formation of weak friction bonds
between the particles to form a certain shape. Thus, the connection between particles
during this stage is frail. The compact is usually very week. At the same time the pres-
sure is applied, the powder in the die undergoes several stages: rearrangement of the
particles, elastic deformation, fragmentation (for brittle materials) or strain hardening
(for ductile materials) and the deformation [1]. After the compaction stage, the powder
takes on the properties of a solid. Although weak after compaction, the solid component
can be heated to a temperature where the particles sinter to one another forming strong
bonds [2]. This is called the sintering stage, where the compacted powder is put into the
furnace and heated to some temperature below the melting point, usually with a holding
period. The friction existing between the die wall and the powder and the cross-section
variation can causes: density gradients, residual stresses and cracks, which can occur in
the green compact [1].

During the sintering stage, particle connection is formed mainly due to the atomic
motions that eliminate the high surface energy associated with the powder. Several
atomic motion paths have been found and categorized to six mechanisms of mass trans-
portation according to modern sintering theory. Among the mechanisms, the grain
boundary diffusion tends to be more important to the densification of most crystalline
materials and appears to dominate the densification of many common metal powder
systems [1]. These concepts can be found in chapters 3 and 4 for a detailed explanation.

In the solid-state sintering, when the material consolidates, it is inevitable that the

3



4 1.Introduction

part shrinks, from a macroscopic point of view. If the shrinkage is not uniform, the part
can suffer distortion. The primary reason for the distortion is that the compact is not a
uniform material. This comes from the nonuniform density distributions created during
compaction. As a downside to this process of manufacturing components, it has been
reported that 50 - 90% of the total component cost is due to extra machining to achieve
the net desired shape [1].

In order to avoid an additional stage of hard machining to address the distortion and
achieve the desired requirements, the process specification must be tailored to minimize
density variation in the compaction stage and to provide controlled/expected shrinkage
during the sintering stage [1].

These sintered products have many benefits, among them, they hold the shape im-
parted by the compaction die, but builds up strength in sintering. Many variants exist
to this basic process [2].

Figure 1.1 demonstrates an overall process of powder metallurgy. Of these materials,
steels are the dominant metallic species. A few powder metallurgy components are
very large, the shapes can range from a simple cylindrical bearing to very complex
structures such as hollow golf-club heads and helical seat gears. In this type of industry
the tooling cost is substantially high, so, for this reason most PM production is targeted
at structures manufactured at high rates (measured typically in parts per year), such
as for automobiles, lawnmowers, home appliances, business machines, computers, and
other electromechanical structures [2].

1.2 Historical Perspective

The PM process had several successes in ancient times (probably as early as 3000 BC)
with the manufacturing of coins and implements in ancient Egypt, gold-platinum powder
compacts by the Incas, an iron pillar in India, copper coins in Germany, and platinum
crucibles in the 1800s in England and Russia. The modern era is traced to Coolidge’s
experiments in the early 1900s (working for Edison) and the production of tungsten
lamp filaments for the light bulb, a process that is still used today. By the 1930s sev-
eral products emerged, including porous bronze bearings, tungsten radiation containers,
copper-graphite electrical contacts, cemented carbides for metal cutting, and the first
steel mechanical components. By the 1950s the industry became organized and the
field emerged as a viable production technology for selected components. Early PM
was applied mostly to small stress, moderately complex components as an alternative to
machining [2].

By the 1960s, interest in the net-shaping attribute of powder metallurgy emerged.
This idea relies on the attainment of final dimensions in the powder forming step, by that
avoiding machining. Aerospace uses grew with the development of fully-density fabrica-
tion techniques, such as hot isostatic pressing. In the 1970s there emerged recognition of
the rapid solidification rates possible in powder atomization, allowing the production of
new compositions with novel properties. In more recent years, many new alloys, property
combinations, and production technologies have emerged [2].

Nowadays, the PM industry is constituted by many companies, each with special-
ization in alloys, applications, and productions techniques. The largest activity is asso-
ciated with ferrous alloys, some iron, and many steels. In spite of the many processes,
PM faces many competitors from alternative forming technologies and alternative ma-
terials - mainly fine blanked steels, cast steels, die-cast zinc, injection-molded plastics,
injection-molded ceramics, extruded aluminum matrix composites, and machined steels
[2].

Ferrous alloys constitute the dominant powders, and structural automotive compo-
nents constitutive the dominant applications. The combination of low production costs
and high sintering strength dominates the PM selection criteria. Since high density is
a precursor to high strength, the trend is toward higher densities to improve mechan-
ical properties. Production technologies that allow high final densities include high-
temperature sintering, powder forging, powder rolling, injection molding, infiltration,
hot isostatic compaction, pneumatic forging, and warm compaction [2].

1.3 Overview of Processes and Steps

The PM processes can be divided in two major areas. One area is in injection molding
and the other area starts with loose powders. In the powder injection moulding (PIM),
the feedstock is sintered to nearly full density at high temperatures. Here, the powder
is shaped in the forming step, but not compacted. More importantly, the particles
are densified in sintering and not during compaction. The other major area of powder
metallurgy is encountered in traditional die compaction, where densification occurs in
pressing. Here, sintering has little impact on densification and is largely used to bond
the particles. Between these two major areas, various technologies exist where sintering
and compaction are combined for densification. Some examples occur in hot pressing,

6 1.Introduction

hot isostatic pressing and hot forging. Pressure-based densification depends on lower
sintering temperatures, larger particle sizes, and higher forming pressures to densify the
powder. Alternatively, sintering-based densification relies on low forming pressures, high
sintering temperatures and small powders. The hybrid densification techniques apply
simultaneously temperature and pressure to obtain a pore-free product [2].

For example, die compaction compresses the powder to produce a density 2-3 times
the initial powder density. Alternatively, injection molding applies a relatively lower
pressure that shapes the powder, so, the particles are neither deformed nor densified.
These forming steps are characterized by typical stresses or pressures and forming times.
Die compaction occurs in roughly one second [2].

With respect to the sintering step, some technologies rely on low temperature to bond
the particles, while others rely on high temperatures to densify the structure. Sintering
densification results in volume changes, while bonding results only in a strength gain.
Again, each process is characterized by a typical temperature and time. Various PM
fabrication techniques rely on a combination of pressure and temperature. For example,
hot isostatic compaction might involve 200 MPa at 800 ?C for one hour to densify a steel
powder [2].

1.4 Needs for Research

As have been mentioned in this chapter, sintering process is one of the most power-
ful techniques to obtain components with high complexity and excellent response in
mechanical performance. However, and particularly in complex components, the prob-
ability for some imperfections and geometric distortions to appear, from high levels of
residual stresses with consequently smooth fractures, is high.

Therefore, numerical methods can be suitable tools to develop specific numeric simu-
lations of the process. As computer technology and numerical algorithms develop rapidly
nowadays, numerical tools such as the Finite Element Method (FEM) and Discrete Ele-
ment Method (DEM) become more popular and powerful. Compared with the empirical
optimization (trial and error method), numerical simulation is less expensive and shows
a more efficient use time, especially for newly designed products [1].

1.5 Research Objectives

The ambit of this investigation work is to develop some competences in the powder
metallurgy simulation area. Therefore, it is necessary to build an accurate numerical
model to determine the shape change, i.e., shrinkage and distortion of the compacted
powder after the sintering. To reach this objective, it is necessary complete intermediate
goals as:

? Capacity in working with some computation tools based on Finite Element Method
(FEM) - The entire work is done resorting to a commercial finite element program.
Therefore, there is a necessity of developing skills in an appropriated finite element
software;

Powder Compaction

2.1 Introduction to Powder Compaction

Powder metallurgy is a widely used net shape manufacturing technique in the metal-
working industry. The most common process of consolidation in powder metallurgy is
the uniaxial die compaction. This process consists in compressing loose powders into
the die cavity by the application of pressure, forming a solid “green” part of relatively
high density that conforms to the shape of the cavity. The pressure is usually applied
along one axis into the cavity where the loose powder is pressed in the y-direction and
has a lateral constrain as shown in figure 2.1. This deformation is defined by a decrease
in porosity and an increase in particle bond strength [2]. This process is extremely fast
and has a great potential for mass production of parts such as those in the automobile
industry [4].

When the pressure required to apply in compaction is higher, higher also, will be the
density of the compact. With standard tool steel or cemented carbide dies and punches,
densities can theoretically reach up to 90% without tool damage. The compact with a
modest density and strength after compaction is fragile and may break upon impact.
Therefore needs to be sintered in a furnace with controlled atmosphere at a temperature
approximately 80% of the melting temperature of the material, in order to attain the
desired strength. During the sintering stage, the powder particles bond together, which
can result in dimensional distortion of the compact. It is proven that the dimensional
change is inversely proportional to the density of the compact; consequently density
gradients in the green part will produce shape distortion [4].

During the compaction process, axial forces applied by the compaction load result
in radial forces being generated at the die walls. Between the powder and the tool com-
ponents there is friction. These frictional forces exist because of the applied pressure
along the die wall decreases along the depth of the powder column. Due to a differential
and non-uniform pressure distribution during the compaction process, it is produced a
density gradient in the green parts. During the entire process of sintering, these den-
sities gradients lead to non-symmetrical dimensional changes. Near the punches faces
are located regions of high density that exhibit small dimensional changes, while in re-
gions away from the punch faces have lower density, and for that reason exhibit larger
dimensional change. This leads to a loss of dimensional precision on the finished com-
ponent. The compaction process study is important for ensure uniformity in dimensions
and properties after sintering, variations in green density need to be minimized and

understood. In order to minimize density gradients is recommended reducing the fric-
tion during the compaction phase by adding lubricants in the powder or in the die-wall
surface [4].

Many compaction options exist, including hard and soft tooling, heating the die and
powder, using rolling mills and even shock waves. Table 2.1 shows a categorization
and comparison of compaction options in PM. This table includes the main processing
variants that uses different pressures to densify the powder in compaction. Each process
associated to the nominal operating parameters, including pressing directions, shape
complexity, and relative use. Differences in the compaction pressures and temperature
help categorize the options [2].

2.2 Techniques of Compaction

2.2.1 Die Compaction

Die compaction involves the pressurization of the powder in a rigid tool set. A concep-
tualization of a die compaction cycle is given by figure 2.2. Powder is loaded into the
cavity by gravity from a feed shoe that sweeps over the die opening. A few important
features of the tool set become evident: the die body, lower punch, upper punch, and
feed shoe. The lower punch is in the fill position during powder entry, but then drops
to a lower position to create room for the upper punch to enter the die cavity. In the
most common pressing cycle, the two punches work toward the center of the compact
to densify the powder: double-action pressing. After application of the peak pressure,
the upper punch is pulled from the die while the lower punch pushes the compact out
of the die. After this point the cycle repeats [2].

Figure 2.2: Die compaction scheme [2].

2.2.2 Warm Compaction

One way to improve green density of die-compacted powder is to heat the powder be-
fore the compaction. Various technologies known as warm compaction are emerging to
performing simultaneous heating and bonding during pressing. Both the powder and
the tooling are heated in warm compaction. A typical temperature for the powder and
tooling might be 150 ?C, and compaction pressures are usually in the range of 700 MPa.
Heating of the die and punches requires modifications to the compaction press, and a
heater is required in the powder feed mechanism. Both microwave and hot-oil heaters
are available for bringing the powder up to a temperature near 150 ?C. Depending on
which polymer is selected the ejection forces can be highly variable [2].

12 2.Powder Compaction

2.2.3 Cold Isostatic Compression

Cold isostatic pressing (CIP) is a common process applied in complex shapes involving
undercuts or large length/diameter ratios. This process is based on a flexible mould to
apply pressure to the powder from all directions. For the CIP process, powder is filled
in the flexible tooling and the sealed tooling is pressurized in a vessel filled with a fluid
such as oil or water. Lubricants are rarely used. The work pressures in CIP can reach
1400 MPa but usually are performed at below of 420 MPa. During pressurization all
seals must be under compression to prevent leakage of the pressurization fluid into the
powder. Usually, an external support is needed to help hold the bag shape during powder
loading, and in some situations the bag is evacuated to remove air prior compaction [2].

There are two variants of cold isostatic pressing: the wet-bag and the dry-bag tech-
niques. The wet bag (figure 2.3), the filled and sealed mould is immersed into a fluid
chamber that is pressurized by an external hydraulic system. This particulate conceptu-
alization would be appropriate for forming a hollow tube by pressing the powder against
a solid core. Ceased the compaction process, the wet mould (or bag) is removed from
the chamber and compact extracted from the mould [2].

Figure 2.3: Wet bag technique using in CIP [5].

The dry-bag approach has in their benefit the high volume production due to the bag
is built directly into the pressure cavity. In this technique, it is known that the flexible
bag deforms but is not ejected. Two end plugs allow powder loading and component
unloading on each cycle, without removing the bag assembly. Sealing is achieved by an
upper punch that enters the bag before pressurization. In that situation, compaction
stresses are generated by isostatic compression of the bag through a hydraulic fluid [2].

Isostatic pressurization is useful for making large, thin-wall, long, or homogeneous
compacts. Density gradients are small in isostatically compacted components, allow-
ing large sintering shrinkages without distortion. With isostatic compaction, the fluid
provides uniform pressures and consequently, uniform density [2].

2.2.4 Powder Rolling

Although die compaction is the most common process, powder rolling can be applied as
a first step toward full-density steel sheet. Powder rolling is different from the common
powder compaction techniques because it is a continuous process. After the first stage of
compaction, in a rolling mill, the powder is not very dense. However, subsequent rolling
passes improve density [2].

Loose powder is gravity-fed into the gap between two rolls, which generate the green
sheet. Gravity feed is the only effective means to feed powder, since there is no strength
to the powder prior to rolling and green densities are very low. Figure 2.4 illustrates
a schematic operation. A binder can be added to improve green strength, and water
works for some powders. Two forces act on the powder as it is compressed. One is the
normal force from the rolls that give compaction, but the other is a tangential force from
friction between powder rolling. The compaction force must exceed the friction force in
powder rolling. The allowed height reduction depends on the rotation angle from where
the powder first contacts the roll to the point at which full compression occurs. For
some powders this angle is as small as a few degrees [2].

Figure 2.4: Powder rolling technique [6].

The higher the initial powder density and the greater the reduction in thickness on
rolling, the higher the final density. However, powders with high apparent densities have
less friction and undergo only small thickness reductions in rolling [2].

In a single-pass rolling operation, densities near theoretical have been achieved, but
multiple-pass treatments are more common. Obviously, the final product is limited
to a sheet form. In the green state, the rolled powder is too weak to be coiled, so
immediate sintering is necessary. After the first sinter, repeated rolling and annealing
allows fabrication of a full-density strip [2].

2.3 Phenomenological Compaction Models

The phenomenological compaction models, originally developed for soils mechanics, are
usually incremental continuum plasticity models (sometimes also called critical-state

14 2.Powder Compaction

models) characterized by a yield criterion, an isotropic (or kinematic) hardening function
and a flow rule. The latter is often considered as of associative that means the yield
surface and the plastic potential surface are coincident and, as a consequence, the plastic
strain increment is normal to the yield surface.

There are a large number of constitutive models for simulation of compaction, among
them the ”cap” model and the Cam-Clay model. Not all can be described here, the
description in section 2.3.1 focus on the most widely used model of phenomenological
compaction models, namely the Drucker-Prager/”Cap” model.

2.3.1 The Drucker-Prager Soil Plasticity Model

The original Drucker-Prager soil plasticity model was developed by Drucker and Prager
in 1952. The main purpose of the model, was to modify the von Mises yield criterion in
metal plasticity to study the bearing capacity of soil foundations. While the metal plas-
ticity models are independent of the first stress invariant, particulate materials exhibit
the type of behaviour characterized by frictional materials in that the strength of these
materials depends on hydrostatic stress. In the Drucker-Prager soil plasticity model is
assumed that the material will behave elastically up at some point of stress at which
yielding occurs. The shear stress necessary for yielding occurs depends in factors like
the cohesion of the material and the normal pressure on the failure surface [4].

The original Drucker-Prager yield criterion modified the von Mises yield criterion by
introducing a dependence on the mean (hydrostatic) stress, p. The Drucker-Prager yield
function is given by:

f(J1,J2D) =
?
J2D ??1J1 ?k = 0, (2.1)

where parameter J1 is the first stress invariant (J1 = ?ii = ?1 + ?2 + ?3), J2D is the
second invariant of the deviatoric stress, sij

(
J2D =

1
2
sijsij

)
, and ?1 and k are positive

material constants [4].

The parameter ?1 allows modify the von Mises yield surface (which is plotted in
the principal stress space) from an infinitely long cylinder to a cone. This is why the
criterion is also called the extended von Mises criterion. When ?1 is major than zero,
the Drucker-Prager yield surface is a right circular cone with its axis equally inclined
to the co-ordinate axes and its apex in the tension octant in the principal stress space.
The failure surface defined by the Drucker-Prager failure criterion in the principal stress
space and the meridional (p ? q) plane is demonstrated in figures 2.5 and 2.6. In the
meridional plane is shown that the parameters ?1 and k denote the angle of internal
friction and cohesion respectively [4].

In the original proposed Drucker-Prager, the failure surface is the straight edge of
a right circular cone, but some researchers have proposed that at higher stresses, the
particulate system behaves as a liquid and its strength approaches the von Mises surface
at these stresses. Therefore, the failure surface can be composed by an initial portion of
the Drucker-Prager and then involves smoothly the subsequent von Mises surface that
prescribes the strength of the material at 100% relative density as shown in figure 2.7
[2].

2.3.2 Flow Rule

When the state of stress reaches the yield criterion, the material undergoes plastic de-
formation. For define the direction of the plastic strain vector, is established a flow
rule. Q is a constant called plastic potential function that is assumed to exist and the
incremental strain vectors are assumed to be orthogonal to this function as given:

d?
pl
ij = ?

?Q

??ij
, (2.2)

where the parameter ? is a positive factor of proportionality [4]. This expression is
referred as the normality rule. In some cases, for several materials, the plastic potential
function is assumed to be equal to the yield function. Such materials are said to follow
the associative flow rule of plasticity. Substituting the expression for the yield function
demonstrated at 2.1 in the normality rule 2.2, the new relation is given as:

d?
pl
ij = ?

(

, (2.3)

where Sij is the deviatoric stress tensor [4]. From equation 2.3, it is noted that the plastic
rate of a cubical dilation is given by:

d?
pl
ii = ?3?1?. (2.4)

As noted before, the volumetric component is negative indicating the shear failure
along the Drucker-Prager failure surface is accompanied by volume increase or dilation.
However resorting to experimental data, it was concluded that in particulate materials
the dilation predicted by the Drucker-Prager model is usually larger than that found in
practice. For some materials, the deformation occurs at constant volume or is accom-
panied by a decrease in volume. This discrepancy may be due to an invalid assumption
of the normality rule. Although discarding, the normality rule would imply a mate-
rial that violates the stability postulates by Drucker (1950). Another consideration, for
explain the discrepancy could be due to the particulate material may not behave as a

perfectly plastic body, an underling assumption of the failure surface definition. With
all these presumptions and considerations it was presented the basis of the modified
Drucker-Prager yield criterion with suggests treating the particulate material system as
a work-hardening material which could reach the perfectly plastic state [4].

2.3.3 Work Hardening and Its Implications

In this section, the concept of work hardening is introduced for explaining the behaviour
of material under plastic loading beyond its yield criterion but prior to failure. If an
external agent causes added stresses on a body, work hardening of the material ensures
that the material remains in stable equilibrium by absorbing the work done by these
added stresses on the strains that result. The work hardening is based on two postulates
[4]:

1. During the application of stresses, the work done by the external agency will be
positive. This is expressed mathematically as:

d?ijd?ij &gt; 0. (2.5)

2. Over a cycle of application and removal of stresses, the work done by the external
agency will be zero or positive. This is expressed as:

d?ijd?
pl
ij ? 0. (2.6)

Certain conditions need to be satisfied to grant an appropriate description of the
physical process involving plastic deformation for contemplate the conceit of work hard-
ening. These conditions were formulated by Prager (1949) and are [4]:

1. Condition of continuity : Given a state of stress that is on the yield surface, an
infinitesimal change of stress d?ij causes unloading if the stress path is directed
for the interior of the surface and loading if the path is direct for the exterior of
the surface and for last, neutral loading if the stress path is tangential to the yield
surface. The condition of continuity states that neutral loading does not cause any
plsatic deformation.

2. Condition of uniqueness : This conditions denotes that for a given state of a ma-
terial and a system of infinitesimal increments of surface tractions, the resulting
increments of stresses and strains are unique.

3. Condition of irreversibility : This condition relates that plastic deformation are
irreversible, this condition states that the work done on plastic deformation will
be positive.

4. Condition of consistency : This condition determines that the yield condition is
satisfied as long the material stays in plastic state.

Considering the postulates and conditions mentioned above, is possible to study what
the implications of assuming a work hardening material are on yield surface. Suppose
that there is a stress state ? situated on the yield surface. Consider an infinitesimal

Alexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis



18 2.Powder Compaction

increment in stress d? whose stress path is directed towards the exterior of the yield sur-
face as shown in figure 2.8. The incremental stress can be divided into two components:
a tangential component d?(t) and a normal component d?(n) [4].

Assuming that the relation between the infinitesimal changes of stress and plastic
strain is linear, the incremental plastic strain caused by d? will be equal to the vector sum
of the incremental plastic strains caused individually by d?(t) and d?(n). By imposing
the condition of continuity that requires the plastic strain due to neutral (or tangential)
loading to be zero, is founded that the incremental plastic strain d?pl due to d? is
dependent only on the normal component d?(n). This leaves to the normality rule i.e
the incremental strain vector is normal to the yield surface. Thus, it is concluded for
a work hardened, the yield function follows the normality rule and ensures that the
material is stable [4].

Figure 2.8: Implication of work hardening [4].

Another topic of the condition of irreversibility is that the work done due to plastic
deformation is positive which is expressed as:

? · d?pl &gt; 0 (2.7)

or
| ? | · | d?pl | cos? &gt; 0. (2.8)

With this, it is concluded that the radius vector should make an acute angle ? with
the incremental plastic strain vector. Although from the previous explanation, was seen
it that the incremental plastic strain vector is normal to the yield surface. Thus, the
concept of work hardening and the condition of irreversibility requires the radius vector
to make an accurate angle with an exterior normal to the yield surface. That is the yield
surface has to be convex. As a objective to describe the behaviour of particulate material
as a work hardening material, Drucker and co-Workers defined a series of spherical yield
surfaces, the simplest convex surface possible. This concept of successive yield surfaces
can explain the hardening or consolidation behaviour of particulate materials and allow
the use of the normality rule of plasticity [4].

2.3.4 A Modified Drucker-Prager/Cap Model

The most used constitutive model in finite element simulation of compaction powder is
the so called cap model. The various cap models developed differ by the functional form
yield surface but they all have some kind of cap describing the hardening part. The cap
model first proposed by Drucker and co-Workers assumed the particulate material to
behave as a work hardening material that may approach the idealized perfectly plastic
state. It is considered the fact that many particulate materials experience the plastic
deformation even before reaching the ultimate failure state defined by the Drucker-
Prager shear failure surface. This criterion also considers plastic deformations under
pure hydrostatic loading. In their work, Drucker presented the criterion proposing the
yield curve being described by two straight lines that Drucker-Prager called the lines of
the failure criterion given by equation 2.1 and a circular arc closure corresponding to
placing a spherical cap on the open end of the cone as shown in figure 2.9. The spherical
yield surface changes with the hydrostatic pressure to describe work hardening [4].

If the material is consolidate hydrostatically up to state of the stress A and then
unloaded, so, the material will behave elastically until to state A and then start expe-
riencing plastic deformations. During successive yielding, the material hardens. When
the stress point moves further the current yield surface as A, a new one yield surface
is established at B. The region in which the material now behaves elastically will in-
corporate the sector OBD. The new yield surface at B intersects the Drucker-Prager
failure surface at D. The experimentally observed volumetric behaviour of particulate
materials can be explained by assuming the incremental plastic strain vector to be nor-
mal to the cap surface at its point of intersection. In addition, the incremental plastic
strain vector needs to be normal to the hydrostatic axis at the point of intersection to
ensure that no hardening takes place when the state of stress reaches a point on the yield
surface that is locally parallel to the hydrostatic axis since no plastic volumetric changes
occur at such a point. This is equal to the critical state concept where the material does
not change in volume when reaches the critical state. For guaranteeing that no shear
deformations take place under pure hydrostatic compression, the cap surfaces intersects
the hydrostatic axis at right angles [4].

Figure 2.9: Drucker-Prager cap yield surfaces [4].

20 2.Powder Compaction

Drucker and co-Workers proposed a spherical yield surface, the simplest convex yield
surface as required from the concept of work hardening. For different researchers, the
shape of these yield surfaces has been assumed to be different. The shape of the yield
surface needs be determined from appropriate laboratory tests. Many caps models were
suggested all over the years by DiMaggio and Sandler (1971) and Lade (1977) where
suggests a series of elliptical yield surfaces. A yield function given by Chen (1994) is a
simple elliptical yield function referred to as the modified Drucker-Prager yield function
and is expressed in equation 2.9 [4].

f(J1,J2D,k1) = (J1 ? l)2 + R2J2D ? (x(k1) ? l)2 = 0 (2.9)

The parameter R represents the aspect ratio of the ellipse, l is the location of the
intersection of the Drucker-Prager surface and the cap, and x is a hardening parameter
and a function of k1 that defines the deformation history. This parameter k1 is usually
taken as the volumetric plastic strain [4].

Figure 2.10: Modified Drucker-Prager cap model [4].

The hardening parameter that defines the yield surface represent a locus of points
with the same volumetric plastic strains. A series of cap yield surfaces defined by equa-
tion 2.9 are shown in figure 2.10 that intersect Drucker-Prager failure surface as per the
assumptions [4].

2.3.5 Constitutive Model Parameters

In some commercial finite element programs the modified Drucker-Prager model is de-
fined by three principal segments: a pressure-dependent Drucker-Prager shear failure
surface Fs, a series of compression yield surface Fc and a transition surface Ft like will
be described in section 6.4. With variation the cap along the hydrostatic axis it is de-
fined the volumetric strain hardening. The purpose of the transition surface is to remove
any singularities during numerical computations when moving from the yield surface to

the failure surface. The surfaces defined by the cap model described in ABAQUS in the
p?q or (J1/3 ?

The hardening law is characterized by a piecewise linear function describing the
hydrostatic yield surface pb to the volumetric plastic strain ?

?volpl is the initial volumetric plastic strain beyond which the work hardening yield surfaces
are defined [4].

The evolution parameter, pa is related to pb by equation 2.12 [4].

Cap Model Parameters

The Drucker-Prager/Cap model parameters can be characterized by identifying two
different aspects on the cap:

?The plasticity parameters that describe the shape of the shear failure surface and the
yield caps. Moreover, the plasticity parameters can be differentiated into two categories:

? Failure surface parameters : These group of parameters responsible to define the
shape of the shear failure surface. These two failure surfaces parameters are the
material cohesion or the intercept of the failure surface with the deviatoric stress
axis, d, and the angle of internal friction or the slope of the failure surface with
the hydrostatic axis, ?.

? Yield surface parameters : These parameters define the location and shape of the
yield caps or loci of constant volumetric strain. The yield surface parameters
comprise the aspect ratio of the elliptic caps, R, and the location of the intersection
of the cap surface with the shear failure surface.

?The work hardening parameters that describe the evolution of the yield caps with
compaction. The location of intersection of the cap surface with the hydrostatic axis
is prescribed by defining the work hardening parameter in terms of pairs of the hydro-
static compression yield stress, pb, and volumetric plastic strain during the consolidation
process, ?

pl
vol.

The parameters are determined by doing some tests in a specimen made of a desired
material. Usually, the specimen is subjected to leading condition that would ensure that
the material is loaded to failure under shear as it undergoes compaction [4].

Failure Surface Parameters

The failure surface parameters can be determined by performing a set of two or more
triaxial compression tests. These tests are made for determine the strength and the
stress-strain relationships of a cylindrical specimen made of particulate material. At
a constant rate of axial deformation the specimen are isotropically consolidated and
sheared in compression. Figure 2.11 shows a schematic of the triaxial test equipment
[2].

The test apparatus consists of an axial loading device capable of providing a certain
prescribed rate of axial strain on the specimen resorting to a piston. An axial measuring
device incorporates the test apparatus. To measure the vertical deformation, a deforma-
tion indicator is used for measure the displacement of the piston. A triaxial compression
chamber consists in a top and a base plate separated by a cylindrical pressure vessel that

22 2.Powder Compaction

is used to house the cylindrical specimen during tests. The chamber is constructed of
any material capable of pressure controlling and measuring devices as well as a volume
measuring device to measure the volumetric strain [4].

For the specimen reach the equilibrium at the effective consolidation pressure, the test
starts with the consolidation phase. The axial load piston is pull down and brought in
contact with the specimen and the reading of the deformation indicator is recorded. After
recording, the piston is raised a small distance and locked in place. The chamber pressure
is then increased unit it reaches the desired effective consolidation. The specimen is then
allowed and the volume readings are recorded at increasing intervals of time. The piston
begins the contact with the specimen cap, after a initial holding time period and then
axial deformation is obtained along with the volume readings for the time increments.
Consolidation is allowed to continue for at least one overnight period after 100% primary
consolidation has been achieved [4].

Figure 2.11: Schematic of triaxial test apparatus [4].

After the specimen be consolidated is then axially loaded at a constant confining
pressure to cause shear failure. The axial load piston is brought in contact with the
specimen and proper seating and alignment of the specimen with the piston is verified
to prevent the applications of a lateral force on the piston. The specimen undergoes
to an axial load at a desired rate of axial strain. The load and the deformation of the
specimen is recorded at increments of strain to define the stress-strain curve until the
material undergoes shear. Finished all this procedure the axial load is removed and the
pressure in the triaxial chamber is reduced to zero. The specimen is removed from the
chamber and its size is measured [4].

With the objective to plot the shear failure line, a minimum of two triaxial compres-
sion tests (i.e tests at two consolidation pressures) are sufficient. For get a better fit and
reduce errors, the test is carried out at more than two consolidation pressures. Figure
2.12 shows the typical results plotted from a triaxial test at different consolidation pres-

sures (?3 = A,B,C,D,...) in order to the deviatoric stress against axial strain, ?1, and
also the shear failure surface plotted in the meridional plane by determining the failure
stresses [4].

Figure 2.12: Results of a set of triaxial compression tests [4].

Yield Surface Parameters

The cap eccentricity parameter is determined resorting to a true axial compression test.
It allows for the application of different stresses in the three orthogonal directions al-
lowing for any loading path to be followed in the three-dimensional stress space. No
standard exists for the true triaxial compression test. The parameter can be determined
by using a cylindrical triaxial compression test. With this test can carefully obtain differ-
ent loading paths leading to consolidation without shear the specimen. For realize these
triaxial tests is recommended use a cubical triaxial tester that allows for independent
normal loading to be applied in the three principal directions. In figure 2.13 it is shown
a schematic of a true triaxial test loading condition for a cubical triaxial tester [4].

The specimen powder is loaded into a flexible powder. The test is done considering
applications of different stresses in the three orthogonal directions to allow consolidation

of the specimen without shear. The three resulting principal stresses and the three
principal logarithmic strain are measured during consolidation. During the consolidation
the bulk densities and the corresponding stress states are calculated. The initial mass
powder placed into the cavity is known, so it is easily to calculate the relative density
at any deformation state. For each value of ? obtained from the different stress states,
the equivalent pressure stress, p and deviatoric stress measure, q, are calculated as in
expressions 2.10 and 2.11 [4].

p = ?

(2.11)

Values for p-q at different densities are plotted by using all the stress-strain curves
obtained from the triaxial compression experiments. Thus, is possible to get yield sur-
faces or loci of constant volumetric strain (iso-density curves) as shown in figure 2.14.
The cap eccentricity parameter can be predicted by the aspect ratio of the best fit ellipse
through these points.

Figure 2.14: Iso-density curve representing Drucker-Prager yield caps in the p?q plane
[4].

Hardening Parameter

The hardening parameter is applied in Drucker-Prager/cap model for define the harden-
ing law or the evolution of yield surfaces (caps) with increasing volumetric strains. The
yield surfaces are loci of constant volumetric strain. The hardening law is defined by
a piecewise function relating the hydrostatic compression yield stress i.e, the intersec-
tion of the yield surface with the hydrostatic axis, pb, and the volumetric plastic strain,
?

pl
vol. The hardening law is usually determined by a hydrostatic compression test (also

known as isotropic triaxial compression test). In this test the specimen is consolidated
by loading it on a stress path along the space diagonal in the principal stress space with
no shear [4].

Alexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis



2.Powder Compaction 25

The hydrostatic compression test starts with the specimen at a initial isotropic state
of stress, (p0 = ?0). The physical state corresponding at the beginning of the hydrostatic
compression is defined by the initial relative density, ?0. Next, the specimen begins
consolidation by loading it in increments of hydrostatic stress, i.e., by applying equal
increments of stress in the three orthogonal directions in a cubical triaxial tester. For
calculate the mean (hydrostatic) stress it is considered to measure the stress applied on
each face of the cubical triaxial tester. The elastic strain is measured at each increment
of the hydrostatic stress and is the sum of the three principal strains. Typically in this
type of testes the specimen is unload at various intervals during the test in order to
obtain the bulk modulus for describing the elastic behaviour of the material. Then,
a graph can be plotted for describe the variation of hydrostatic stress with volumetric
strain as shown in figure 2.15. In this figure for example, the plot indicates that the
specimen was unloaded twice during the test. The hardening law can then be defined as
a piecewise function of the volumetric strain by fitting a function to the plotted data as
shown in figure 2.16 [4].

Figure 2.15: Hydrostatic stress versus volumetric strain [4].

Figure 2.16: Hardening law [4].

26 2.Powder Compaction

Loading material with high strength, hydrostatically can be very difficult and the
set-up expensive. Alternatively, it was adopted to test the material in a rigid die under
compaction loads for determine the hardening law. Figure 2.17 shows a schematic of a
uniaxial die pressing set-up. The set-up consists of an axial loading punch with pressure
transducers mounted on it to measure the axial stress. Displacement transducers mea-
sure the longitudinal displacement and hence the axial strain or relative bulk density of
the specimen [4].

Figure 2.17: Schematic of a uniaxial die pressing experiment [4].

The die is considered be a rigid body, thus, the radial strain is assumed to be zero and
the plastic volumetric strain is assumed to be approximately equal to the total volumetric
strain since the elastic part of the volumetric strain is very small for high strength
particulate material. The effect of friction can be minimize by choosing appropriate
lubricants at the die wall or admixed with particulate material. When the specimen
particulate material is loaded axially is measured, at the same time, the axial stress
and the displacement for reunion data to give a plot of relative density versus axial
stress. The hydrostatic compression stress, pb, is associated to the axial stress, ?z, by
the expression in 2.12 given by [4]:

Sintering

3.1 Introduction

The working definition of sintering follows: Sintering is a thermal treatment for bonding
particles into a coherent, predominantly solid structure via mass transport events than
often occur on the atomic scale. The bonding leads to improved strength and a lower
system energy [7].

Sintering is a processing technique used to produce density-controlled materials and
components from metal or/and ceramic powders by applying thermal energy. The sin-
tering process is a widely used processing technology in powder metallurgy and ceramics
industries [8]. During the sintering the green body undergoes the shrinkage in dimen-
sions and then final high dense or full dense product is obtained [9]. Figure 3.1 shows
the general fabrication pattern of sintered part and in this specific chapter it will be
focus around the box named sintering.

Figure 3.1: General fabrication pattern of sintered parts [9].

Sintering mechanisms can be divided into several types by means of mass transport
mechanisms largely occurring at the atomic level. Most polycrystalline materials are
sintered through solid-state diffusion that falls into solid-state sintering. Most sintering
cycles generate a transient liquid phase that can improve the mass transport rate. It
is called liquid-state sintering. For amorphous materials, viscous flow is the main mass
transport mechanism during the process considered as viscous sintering [9].

Sintering aims is, in general, to produce sintered parts with reproducible and if
possible, designed microstructure through control of sintering variables. Microstructural

27



28 3.Sintering

control means the control of grain size, sintered density, and size and distribution of
other phases including pores. In most cases, the final goal of microstructural control is
to prepare a fully dense body with a fine grain structure [9].

3.2 Definitions and Nomeclature

3.2.1 Density and Porosity

Density is the most widely reported property in sintering. It relates to the sintering
kinetics and correlates with many properties of sintered materials. The density (?)
is the mass per unit volume, which is called the absolute density (Mg/m3 or g/cm3).
Here, the concern is lead with the fractional or percentage density that gives evidence of
fundamental events occurring during sintering, independent of the material. It is defined
as the measured density divided by the theoretical density. In fact, when work with
powder structures, the compact density is often expressed as a fractional of percentage
of theoretical solid density, designated Vs for the volume fraction of solid phase; thus
Vs = ?/?T, where ?T is the theoretical density for the material. Alternatively, the volume
fraction of porosity Vp is the fractional void space in the compact, where Vp = (1??)/?T.
By definition the fractional porosity equal unit, as given by [7]:

Vp + Vs = 1. (3.1)

The green density refers to the before sintering, so the green porosity is the void
space prior to sintering. Theoretical density corresponds to the pore-free solid sintering
[7].

Pores are an inherent part of sintering. They are present in the powder compact
as interparticle voids. The pores space is characterized by its amount, size, shape, and
distribution throughout the compact. As the particles sinter, often the compacts densify
and reduce the pore size [7].

Porosity, a gross measure of the pore structure, gives the fraction of the total volume
that is void. It is expressed as either a percentage or fraction of the total volume [7].

3.2.2 Shrinkage and Swelling

The dimensional change in a powder compact is one of the most widely applied sintering
monitors. Shrinkage refers to a decrease in linear dimensions, and swelling refers to an
increase in dimensions. Although in many situations sintering is intentionally performed
to bond particles without significant dimensional change, there are a great many situa-
tions that exhibit shrinkage or swelling. In such situations there is considerable concern
with controlling shrinkage or swelling to obtain the desired final dimensions [7].

Formally, the linear dimensional change is defined as ?L/L0, reflecting the change
in an initial green length L0 to a final sintered length Ls given as ?L. If the dimension
is larger after sintering, the process termed swelling and ?L/L0 is positive, while if
the dimension is smaller after sintering the process is termed shrinking and ?L/L0 is
negative [7].

3.Sintering 29

3.2.3 Coarsening and Densification

Many materials form sinter bonds between particles without densification. This is usually
due to transport from surface sites to surface sites by surface diffusion or evaporation-
condensation. Even thought there is no net dimensional change, there is considerable
reduction of surface area, increase in grain size, and compact strengthening, with atten-
dant changes in the pore size and shape. These are termed coarsening events and are
best monitored by surface area, grain size, or pore size parameters. Coarsening processes
also consume the surface energy that is responsible for densification, but do not reduce
pore space. In these situations densification requires manipulation to minimize coarsen-
ing. It is common to observe sintering with simultaneous densification and coarsening.
There are sintered products where lack of densification is desirable. Alternatively, den-
sification is desirable in many structural materials. During coarsening the pores grow
while during densification the pores shrink. In many cases this mixture of densification
and coarsening leads to growth of the large pores and shrinkage of the smaller pores [7].
Figure 3.5 illustrates the scenario that it is possible for both coarsening and densification
effects to exist.

3.2.4 Sintering stress

The Laplace equation expresses the stress ? associated with a curved surface as:

? = ?

(
1

R1
+

1

R2

)
, (3.2)

where ? is the surface energy, and R1 and R2 are the principal radii of curvature for the
surface. Figure 3.2 illustrates a general point on a curved surface and the two radii R1
and R2. A flat surface is stress free. During sintering, any surface with a bump, or dip,
will tend to flatten over time to remove the stress [7].

Figure 3.2: Curvature at any point on a curved surface is given in terms of the two
principal radii R1 and R2 [7].

As an example of Laplace equation usage, consider the initial sintering of two spheres.
The neck region can be simplified as drawn in figure 3.3. A free surface is characterized

30 3.Sintering

by disrupted atomic bonding, which is the source of the surface energy, and the grain
boundary also a defective region (which is the source of the grain boundary energy).
Initial atomic bounding in the neck region is highly disrupted. Along the surface away
from the neck, the curvature is constant, with both R1 and R2 equal to the sphere radius,
D/2. From equation 3.3.

Figure 3.3: Sintering profile for two spherical particles with neck diameter of X [7].

? =
4?

D
(3.3)

Using a circle approximation to the neck shape with a radius of p, where p is approx-
imately equal to X2/4D, the curvature at the neck gives a stress as follows:

? = ?

(

X
?

4D

)
. (3.4)

Comparing 3.3 and 3.4 reveals that there is a large stress gradient in the neck re-
gion, since the stress changes sign over a relatively small distance. For a small neck
the gradient can be quite large. Thus, the stress gradient provides a driving force for
mass flow to the neck. As the neck grows, the curvature gradient is relaxed and the
process is slow. In the intermediate stage, the curvature around the cylindrical pores
provides the driving force. Alternatively, in the final stage, the curvature around the
spherical pores drives shrinkage. A reduction in surface energy occurs either by removal
of the pores or coalescence of the pores - hence the focus on densification and coarsening
during sintering. Similarly, the particles bond and become grains. Grain growth during
sintering reduces the grain boundary area and energy. The stress from interfacial ener-
gies acting over curved surfaces in a sintering system is termed the sintering stress. In
a sense, the sintering stress results from equating the thermodynamic work associated
with eliminating surface energy (and area) to mechanical work [7].

The sintering stress is associated directly with the curvature at the interparticle neck.
By the final stage, the sintering stress takes on two contributions, one attributed to the
pores and the second attributed to the grain:

? =
2?ss
G

+
4?sv
dp

, (3.5)

where G is the grain size, ?ss is the solid-solid grain boundary energy, ?sv is the
solid-vapor surface energy, and dp is the pore size. At small grain sizes the first term is
dominant, while at small pore sizes the second term is dominant [7].

Densification increases with the sintering stress, which in turn varies with tempera-
ture [7].

3.3 Categories of Sintering

Essentially, sintering processes can be divided into two types: solid state sintering and
liquid phase sintering. Solid state sintering occurs when the powder compact is densified
wholly in a solid state at the sintering temperature, while liquid phase sintering occurs
when a liquid phase is present in the powder compact during sintering. Figure 3.4,
in a representative mode, illustrates the two cases in a schematic phase diagram. At
temperature T1, solid state sintering occurs in an A?B powder compact with composition
X1, while at temperatures T3, liquid phase sintering occurs in the same powder compact
[8].

Figure 3.4: Illustration of various types of sintering [8].

Other types of sintering phases exists between solid state sintering and liquid phase
sintering, which are for example, transient liquid phase sintering and viscous flow sin-
tering. Viscous flow sintering occurs when the volume fraction of liquid is sufficiently
high, so that the full densification of the compact can be achieved by a viscous flow of
grain-liquid mixture without having any grain shape change during densification. In the
transient liquid phase sintering, a combination of liquid phase sintering and solid state
sintering occurs. In this sintering technique a liquid phase forms in the compact at an
early stage of sintering, but the liquid disappears as sintering proceeds and densification
is completed in the solid state. Resorting again to figure 3.4, it can be observed an
example of transient liquid phase sintering when an A ? B powder compact with com-
position X1 is sintered above the eutectic temperature but below a solidus line AB, for
example at temperature T2. Since the sintering temperature is above the A?B eutectic
temperature, a liquid phase is formed through the reaction between the A and B powders
during heating of the compact. During sintering however, the liquid phase disappears
and only a solid phase remains because the equilibrium phase under the given sintering
condition is a solid phase [8].

In general, liquid phase sintering allows easy control of microstructure and reduction
in processing cost, but degrades some important properties, like mechanical properties,
when compared with solid state sintering. Liquid phase sintering is applied when speci-
fied products utilize properties of the grain boundary phase [8].

3.4 Sintering Variables

It is convenient to identify the major variables that influence the sintering stage. So,
the major variables which determine sinterability and the sintered microstructure of
a powder compact can be divided into two categories: material variables and process
variables (table 3.1) [8].

Variables related to sintering condition Temperature, time, pressure, atmosphere,

The variables connected to raw materials (material variables) include chemical com-
position of powder compact, powder size, powder shape, powder size distribution, degree
of powder agglomeration, etc. These variables influence the powder compressibility and
sinterability (densification and grain growth). The other variables involved in sintering
are mostly thermodynamic variables, such as temperature, time, atmosphere, pressure,
heating and cooling rate [8].

3.5 Driving Force and Basic Phenomena

The driving force of sintering is the reduction of the total interfacial energy [8]. The
impetus to reduce the total interfacial energy is considered as the sintering driving force,
that includes the force associated to the curvature of the particle surfaces the externally
applied pressure and the chemical reactions [9]. The total interfacial energy of a powder
compact is expressed as ?A, where ? is the specific surface (interface) energy and A the
total surface (interface) area of the compact. The reduction of the total energy can be
expressed as:

? (?A) = ??A + ??A (3.6)

where the change in interfacial energy (??) is due to densification and the change in
interfacial area due to grain coarsening. For solid state sintering ?? is related to the
replacement of solid/vapour interfaces (surface) by solid/solid interfaces. The scheme
presented in figure 3.5 shows that the reduction in total interfacial energy occurs via
densification and grain growth, the basic phenomena of sintering [8].

3.6 Sintering Mechanism

There are many types of transport mechanism occurring during the sintering process.
Figure 3.6 illustrates the paths of material transport of the transport mechanics listed in
table 3.2. The material transport due to the difference in interface curvature occurs under
the parallel actions of various mechanisms. Some of these material transport mechanisms

contribute to densification and shrinkage while others do not [8]. The vacancies and
atoms move along the particle surfaces (surface diffusion), along the grain boundaries
(grain boundary diffusion), across pore spaces (evaporation-condensation), and through
the lattice interior (volume diffusion or lattice diffusion or viscous flow) [9].

From figure 3.6, it can be illustrated that densification occurs only when the atoms
move along the grain boundaries and create the continual mass flow into the pores.
The center of the particles move closer through diffusion, that leads to the macroscopic
shrinkage of the sintering bodies. So, grain boundary diffusion and volume diffusion con-
tribute to densification. On the other hand, surface diffusion, evaporation-condensation

are the coarsening mechanisms that occur without producing densification [9].

3.7 Stages of Solid State of Sintering

Solid state sintering is usually divided into three overlapping stages: intial; intermediate
and final stage. Figure 3.7 demonstrates the typical densification curve of a compact for
these stages over sintering time [8]. There is no clear-cut distinction between the stages,
but each stage can be described by its general characteristics, as shown in figure 3.8 [9].

Figure 3.7: Densification curve behaviour of a powder compact through the three sin-
tering stages [8].

The initial stage is characterized by the loose particles rearranging their positions to
form new contacts with each other. Afterwards, the sintering necks are formed at the
contact area and begin to grow by the diffusion process. The initial stage ends when the
neck radius is around 0.3 of the radius of the particle and compact shrinkage is limited
to 2?3% at most. The intermediate stage is the most important for densification, since

it determines the properties of the sintering components. Considerable densification, up
to ? 93% of the relative density, occurs before isolation of the pores. The final stage
is characterized by the isolated pores located at the grain corners. It is also known as
the coarsening involving growth of the larger grains and the consumption of the smaller
grains. For the ideal cylindrical pores occupying the grain boundaries, instability occurs
at approximately 8% of the porosity. Considering the porosity distributions of the real
materials, the pores begin to close at about 15% of the porosity and are all closed when
the porosity is less than 5% [9].

3.8 Models of Initial Stage

The microscopic models are established from the particles level. If spherical particles
of the same size are assumed, the sintering of powder compacts can be represented as
the sintering between two particles, the two-particle model [8]. The two-particle model
is the typical one used to simulate the neck growth and the densification during the
initial sintering stage [9]. The typical geometries of the two-particle models are shown
in figure 3.9, one without shrinkage (a) and the other with shrinkage (b). In figure 3.9
the distance between the particles does not change but the neck size increases as the
sintering time increases [8]. In the model with shrinkage, the neck size increases with an
increased sintering time by material transport between the particles and hence shrinkage
results [9].

3.9 Intermediate and Final Stage Sintering

When necks form between particles in real powder compacts, pores form interconnected
channels along 3-grain edges. As the sintering progresses, the pore channels are discon-
nected and isolated pores form and, at the same time, the grains grow [8].

Coble presented two geometrically simple models for the shape changes of pores
during intermediate and final stage sintering: the channel pore model and the isolated
pore model, respectively [9].

In the intermediate stage, the geometry of the grain is regarded as tetrakaidecahedron
and the highly interconnected pores are assumed to be cylindrical ones located at the

Grain Growth

It is important to present an overview about grain growth, being intimately connected
with the sintering cycle. Figure 4.1 demonstrates the formation of two elongated grains
from six original particles where the grain behaviour with higher temperatures is shown
[10]. It is these phenomenons occurring at higher temperatures that are interesting to
approach in the context of this study.

The average grain size of polycrystalline materials increases as the annealing time
increase and the phenomenon of grain growth is important in sintering. Phenomeno-
logically, grain growth is divided into two types: normal and abnormal (sometimes also
called exaggerated) grain growth. Normal grain growth is characterized by a simple and
invariable distribution of relative grain size with annealing time, while abnormal grain
growth, which occurs by the formation of some exceptionally large grains in a matrix,
shows a bimodal grain size distribution [8].

Grain size influences many mechanical properties of polycrystalline materials [11].
In the case of metallic and ceramic systems are exposed to elevated temperatures, it
generally results in grain growth with a simultaneous loss in strength and fractures
toughness [12]. Grain growth and deformation are similar in one respect; both involve
movement and rearrangement of atoms [11].

In sintering, grain growth reduces the number of diffusion vacancy sinks, which re-
sults in a decrease densification rate. Some studies revealed that stainless steel powder
compact showed an intimate relation between grain growth and densification processes.
The effect was particularly dominant in the intermediate stage of sintering in which the
pore structure became rounded, usually when temperatures reach values above 1057 ?C
and for periods superior to one hour [12].

4.1 Grain Boundary Diffusion in Sintering

In grain boundary diffusion dominated by sintering processes, the sintering stress is
proportional to the reciprocal of grain size. It is this relation that connects the macro-
scale deformation with the microstructure evolution of the material [1].

Grain boundary diffusion is a mass flow mechanism used to describe the solid state
sintering of many materials during their densification. Grain boundaries form in the in-
terface between crystals with different atomic orientations. Essentially, grain boundary
diffusion consists of lattice defects between grains. Corresponding to large and small

rotation angles between adjacent grains, the misorientation could be random and re-
peated, respectively. Therefore, a grain boundary is as narrow as a crystallite, usually
in a scale of nanometer. However, it is still an efficient mass flow path [1].

The influence of grain boundary diffusion on sintering is dependent on several factors:
the grain shape, the grain size, and the distribution [1].

4.2 Grain Growth Mechanism

Grain growth is the process in which the average grain size of an aggregate of crystals
increases. It is driven by the decrease in surface energy and reduction in the total grain
boundary area. Grain growth is closely related to the migration of the grain boundary.
For continuous materials, depending on the microstructure character and growth pattern,
two different types of grain growth have been reported in previous studies: abnormal
grain growth (discontinuous) and normal grain growth (continuous). Abnormal grain
growth normally commences after a certain period of normal grain growth. Abnormal
grain growth occurs at temperatures below 0.7Tm to 0.9Tm, where Tm is the melting
point. When abnormal grain growth (AGG) occurs, most of the grain boundaries are
found to have faceted structures [1]. Abnormal grain growth is a coarsening type of
microstructure where some (or a few) large grains grow unusually quickly in a matrix
of fine grains with a very slow growth rate [8]. Therefore, the average of the grain size
distribution is not changing significantly. When normal grain growth occurs, faceted
grain boundaries are replaced with smoothly curved shapes and the grain growth speed
increases dramatically despite the initial grain size [1].

If the activation energy for grain growth is high, grain growth may not be very fast
and neither is the sintering densification. It has been noted that, as the temperature
gets to a transition point, the activation energy may shift to a different level, which
causes an immediate increase of grain size. As the grain grows bigger, the growth rate
becomes slower. Ultimately, the resistance and the driving force may reach a balance
point. According to these observations, it is reasonable to conclude that a transition
temperature exists for grain growth of continuous material. This transition temperature
defines the boundary between abnormal grain growth and normal grain growth, and also

4.Grain Growth 39

the shift between the two energy levels [1].

Figure 4.2: Normal grain growth (continuous) and abnormal grain growth (discontinu-
ous) [13].

Considering the fact that even the smallest pore in a powder compact is much larger
than the width of a grain boundary or the size of a dislocation, which is around several
nanometres, it is reasonable to believe that the grain growth behaviour in a porous body
is the same as it is in a full-dense body [1].

The grain growth behaviour occurs approximately in the final of the initial stage
of sintering and continues into the intermediate stage. This behaviour is represented
in scheme 4.3. Neck growth occurs between two spheres of slightly different size in
contact; the grain boundary which develops as a consequence of the misorientation of
the spheres at the contact interface (Figure 4.3 (b)) cannot migrate from the neck region
because increases in interfacial area and total interfacial energy would be required. The
neck disappears with further growth by varying transport mechanisms, which are for
example, surface, grain boundary, and volume diffusion, leaving only a thermal groove
at the grain boundary (Figure 4.3 (c)). The grain boundary becomes curved. The larger
the difference in size between the initial particles, the greater will be the curvature of the
grain boundary which develops. Grain-boundary curvature creates a driving force such
that the boundary migrates toward its center of curvature. Grain-boundary migration
occurs when the boundary is mobile enough to permit ions to move across it. Subsequent
grain growth is evidenced by an elongated grain (figure 4.3 (d)) [10].

Thus, grain growth in porous compacts consists of growth of necks between parti-
cles until the grain boundary is free to move. Grain-boundary motion is probably fast
compared to neck growth, and after the neck reaches a size comparable to that of the
smaller grain, the boundary will move rapidly through the smaller grain. During grain
growth the grain will either grow or disappear, depending on the size of its immediate
neighbour [10].

Constitutive Models

5.1 Thermal Expansion

In most cases, the main reason for heat absorption is the atoms vibrational energy
increase, and consequently, volume changes. In the absence of phase transformation,
most materials show positive heat expansion coefficient (?), i.e., they increase their
dimension with an increase in temperature. Consequently, a material subjected to a
thermal gradient, will suffer a thermal strain, resulting in thermal dilation. The stain
(?T) is given by:

??T = ?L?T, (5.1)

where ?L is the linear thermal expansion coefficient and ?T is the temperature variation
[14].

5.2 Heat transport

The sintering atmosphere determines several reactions during sintering. Additionally,
the atmosphere is important in transporting heat to the compact [7].

There are three ways to transfer heat: conduction, convection, and radiation. Radi-
ation occurs by the emission of light or other electromagnetic radiation from the furnace
walls or heating elements. Convection and conduction require a gas phase. Conduction
is heat transport through the gas, based on thermal conductivity of the material, like
is explained in 5.2.1. Convection is also through the gas, but depends further on the
velocity of the gas at the compact surface and is discussed in 5.2.2 [7].

Once heat is deposited at the compact surface, there is then the necessity to distribute
the heat into the compact. This depends on the thermal conductivity, porosity, and gas
phase. Usually, pores reduce the thermal conductivity for a material. Usually in most
materials, the temperature difference between the surface and the interior is small during
sintering [15].

5.2.1 Thermal Conductivity

Thermal conductivity is the property that quantifies the material capability to transport
the heat from the high temperature zones to lower temperature zones (heat conduction).
The heat conduction is the transmission of energy from particles in an elevated state

41



42 5.Constitutive Models

energy to particles in a lower state energy, in order for each particle to be in a lower
energy state [14].

The mathematical model usually applied to quantify the heat conduction is called
the Fourier law, which establishes that the heat flux by conduction in a certain direction
is proportional to the normal area, to the considered direction and to the temperature
in the analysed direction given by:

Q = ?KA
dT

dx
, (5.2)

where K is the thermal conductivity of the material. The negative signal present on the
relation is in consequence of the heat flux direction being opposite to the temperature
gradient [14].

The heat conduction through the compact is not a large problem under normal
heating rates. Only with large compacts, rapid heating, or high initial porosities will
there be opportunities to generate large surface stresses that might cause cracking [7].

5.2.2 Convection

Convection is a commitment between two mechanisms that allow heat exchange. The
atomic and the macroscopic movements contribute to the heat exchange. The heat
exchange only happens if the material and the surrounding environment are at different
temperatures, i.e, distinct energy levels. This exchange ends when the two systems
involved reach an equilibrium state. The mathematical model most used to quantify this
heat exchange is the Newton cooling law. This law says that the convection heat flux
in a determined direction is proportional to the normal area to the considered direction
and to the difference in temperatures. The proportionality constant is the convection
heat flux (h) included in equation 5.3 [14].

qc = hc (Ts ?T?) (5.3)

5.2.3 Radiation

The radiation heat flux exchanged with the surrounding environment can be given by:

qr = kr (Ts ?T?) , (5.4)

where kr = ?r
(
T 2s + T

2
?
)

(Ts + T?) and ?r is the constant dependent of Stefan-Boltzman
and the emissivity of the material, considering that the green body is inserted in a closed
cavity [16].

5.2.4 Temperature distribution

All the materials have the capability to transfer the heat from higher temperature regions
for lower temperature regions. During the heat transfer, there is the formation of thermal
gradients and then, the necessity of quantifying them in time and space. In an analysis of
heat conduction, it is important to try to identify the temperatures field in a specimen,
according to the engaging environment. Therefore, it considered an infinitesimal volume
element and a thermal balance into this element is applied, resulting in relation 5.5.

E?Stored = E?In ? E?Out + E?Generated (5.5)

Considering the Fourier law and the non-existent phase change, a differential equa-
tion that allows the temperatures distribution calculations in function of time and space
(T(x,y,z,t)) is established. This is usually known as heat diffusion equation, which, de-
spite its complexity, is very important in heat conduction transient analysis [14]. Math-
ematically, this differential equation is expressed as:

where ? is the density, Cp is the heat capacity and Kx, Ky and Kz represent the thermal
conductivity in, respectively, the x, y and z directions [14].

5.3 Thermo-mechanical behaviour

When a certain material is subjected to a transform process, like what happens in
powder metallurgy process, this one stays subjected to a mechanical and thermal residual
stresses from the themo-mechanical effects. Therefore, it becomes relevant to study and
to analyse the rheological behaviour of the material, i.e., the mechanisms that deform
the material when subjected to effects.

It is necessary to point out that this process is an uncoupled process, i.e., in this
work there are two distinct processes. The first part, of this work, is focused on the
compaction process and the second part is focused on the sintering process. The two
processes have distinct behaviours but when together, the powder metallurgy process
emerges, which is controlled by a thermo-mechanical behaviour.

Different materials can present different mechanical behaviours, and they are clas-
sified according to their behaviour. In this work the isotropic material behaviour is
adopted, mainly, to explain the deformation in the compaction process. The isotropic
material has uniform characteristics in all directions, i.e., it presents symmetric proper-
ties relatively to a plane with arbitrary direction [14].

5.3.1 Strain Components

In this research, the strains created come from the compaction and sintering processes.
Thus, velocities or strain rates can be divided into elastic (?e) and plastic (?p) that are
essentially from the compaction stage and also elastic strain (?e), creep strain (?cr) and
thermal strain (?t), essentially coming from sintering stage

In a industrial transformation process of a loose powder into a hard metal it occurs
the development of the previously referred strains, which will be properly described.

5.3.2 Strain components from powder compaction

Starting by considering the simple case of uniaxial compression of a block material
and identifying some elementary features of the material response and how this will
be presented in the form of a material constitutive model, the next step is generalise
the results to describe the response of porous powder compacts subjected to general
multiaxial stress histories [17].

Alexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis



44 5.Constitutive Models

Consider, initially, the situation where a cylindrical specimen of a material is sub-
jected to a uniaxial stress ? and as a result experiences a strain ?. Figure 5.1 shows a
typical material response [17].

At low stress occurs the elastic strain, which corresponds to the simultaneous happen-
ing of applied force with respective strain, considering this phenomena time dependent.
If the relation between the applied force and displacement is linear, the material be-
haviour is elastic linear. The material elastic behaviour could be interpreted resorting
to an analogy with a spring. When a load is applied into a spring, this one deforms.
However, the load necessary for increasing the strain also increases. At the end, when
the load is removed, the spring returns to their initial state naturally. This kind of
behaviour could be defined by Hooke’s law. He says that the stress is the product of the
elasticity module by the respectively strain [17], like shown in Equation 5.7.

?e = E?e (5.7)

As the stress is increased the material eventually yields and plastic strain accu-
mulates. The plastic strain works as a non reversible process. Any plastic strain is
permanent and the strain stays in the body after unload. The calculation methodology
like Hooke’s law loses their influence. In this case, the process is time dependent and
change the materials behaviour, in such manner, that their mechanical characteristics
come to depend on the history material loads [14]. Figure 5.1 shows the situation where
the specimen is loaded beyond the initial yield stress, ?s, to a stress ? = s. If the stress
is now reduced to zero the specimen unloads elastically. The residual plastic strain
accumulated as a result of this loading history is ?p. If the stress is increased to the
value ? &amp;lt;s, the subsequent response is elastic and the total strain experienced by the
specimen [17] is given by 5.8.

5.Constitutive Models 45

If the stress is increased to the point ? = s further plastic straining can occur. The
magnitude of s is important since, it gives the value of stress at which the response is no
longer elastic, i.e, it is the instantaneous magnitude of the yield stress that results from
prior thermomechanical loading history. It is evident that s (the yield stress) depends
on the accumulated plastic strain, i.e, s is a function of ?p [17].

Focus now in the deformation situation under multiaxial states of stress, where the
compacts are subjected to axisymmetric loading histories, such as shown in figure 5.2,
in which a cylindrical compact is subjected to axial and radial components of stress, ?a
and ?r [17].

The hydrostatic component of stress is the mean of the three principal stresses (there
are two radial components) and for the axisymmetric stress state of figure 5.2 [17] is given
by:

p =
1

(?a + 2?r) . (5.9)

The equivalent stress is related to the principal shear stresses and for the loading of
figure 5.2 [17] is given by:

q = |?a ??r|. (5.10)

Figure 5.2: Axial and radial components of (a) stress and (b) strain on an axisymmetric
powder compact [17].

Under the axisymmetric loading of figure 5.2 (a) the compact experiences axial and
radial strains, ?a and ?r, as show figure 5.2 (b). Considering again elastic response,
it proves convenient to define two strain invariants: the volumetric strain, ?v, and the
equivalent strain ?e, for the axisymmetric conditions of figure 5.2 (b). For axisymmetric
conditions of figure 5.2 (b), the strains are given by equation 5.11 and 5.12 [17].

For an isotropic elastic material only two material constants are required to define
the constitutive response (the relationship between stress and strain). Application of
a pressure results in a volume change, relation 5.13, and the effective stress leads to a
shape change 5.14 [17].

In the previous relations, K is the bulk modulus and G the shear modulus. The elastic
response can alternatively be described in terms of the Young’s modulus of equation 5.7
and Poisson’s ratio, ?. These are related directly to the bulk (relation 5.15) and shear
moduli (relation 5.16) [17].

When dealing with plastic deformation under multiaxial loading conditions, it is
necessary introduce a number of additional concepts. When considering the uniaxial
behaviour it was introduced the concept of a yield stress, a stress below which the
response is elastic. Under multiaxial loading, it is possible identify a yield surface, a
convex surface in stress space: example is given by figure 5.3. For stress histories within
the surface the response is elastic and a compact responds to changes in stress according
to 5.13 and 5.14. Plastic deformation can only occur if the stress states lies on the yield
surface. The yield surface can be expressed as:

f = f(q,p,state) = 0, (5.17)

where f is a function of two scalar stress measures, q and p and the current state of
the material (which was defined in terms of s, or the accumulated plastic strain under
uniaxial loading). As with uniaxial loading the response is elastic if f &amp;lt;0 (i.e the stress
state lies within yield) and the state f &gt; 0 is not achievable [17].

Now, it is necessary to define how the compact deforms plastically at yield. Since
plastic strain can accumulate at any point on the yield surface, it proves convenient to
express the response in terms of increments of plastic strain, shown in equations 5.18
and 5.19 for the axisymmetric loading of figure 5.2 [17].

The effective strain increment, d??p, is always positive, thus effective strain will
steadily accumulate:

An increment of volumetric strain can be related to the change in volume, V of a
sample:

Integrating this relationship from the initial volume V0, when the strain is zero and

In relation 5.23 ?0 and ? are the initial and current densities of the compact, with
the second of these relationships determined from the fact that the mass of the compact
remains constant [17].

It is convenient to describe the state of the material in terms of plastic strain at a
given instant, i.e, ?

p
v and ??

p, or, since the density is directly related to the volumetric
strain, by ? and ??p. Then, the yield condition takes the form shown in 5.24 [17].

f = f (q,p,?, ??pv) = 0 (5.24)

It is generally assumed that the state can be adequately described in terms of the
density. The yield condition can then be written as relation 5.25 [17].

f = f (q,p,?) = 0 (5.25)

Different types of models and forms of yield surface for powder compacts exist. This
section, is focused the model used for this research. The Drucker and Prager’s two
part yield surface was adopted, which was originally developed to model the behaviour
of soils. In the form currently employed, it consists of an elliptic compaction region
and a transition region, which simply smooths the response between the compaction
and shear-Clayfailure regimes, where normality of the strain increment vector is again
assumed [17].

In figure 5.3, the shear failure line has been drawn such that a compact has a finite
shear stress, i.e., there is cohesion [17]. A number of extensions of this model have been
proposed, however for this research, this plasticity model was adopted and will be fully
explained in section 6.4.

5.3.3 Strain Components From Sintering

Sintering is mainly affected by viscoelastic behaviour. This is found in those materials
which respond to an applied stress by both recoverable and permanent deformations,
which are time dependent. Non-crystalline organic polymers exhibit this behaviour.
Time-dependent permanent deformation is termed as viscous flow. When subjected
to external stresses many crystalline materials undergo not only elastic deformation

48 5.Constitutive Models

Figure 5.3: The Drucker-Prager two-surface model [17].

but also viscous flow. Viscoelastic mechanical behaviour, is the intermediate behaviour
between totally elastic and totally viscous. It may notes that it is analogous to the creep
phenomenon in crystalline materials [18].

Viscoelastic creep happens when the stress level is maintained constant. Many crys-
talline materials are found to be susceptible to time-dependent deformation. Such de-
formation is termed as viscoelastic creep. This type of deformation may be significant
at room temperature and under modest stresses that lie below the yield strength of the
material [18].

Thus, the behaviour presented in the sintering stage is called thermo-viscoelastic
behaviour. The principals influences come from the elastic strain (?e) (this elastic strain
has the same behaviour as in section 5.3.2), the creep strain (?cr), and the thermal strain
(?t). These two last components will be boarded in the next paragraphs.

Creep

Creep is essentially a slow rise of plastic deformation under the action of stress below
the yield strength of the material. A typical curve of deformation versus loading time is
shown in figure 5.4. The first stage is called the unstable or transient creep (also called
initial or primary creep). The second stage is the stage of steady-state, or secondary
creep and is characterized by a constant deformation rate. At third stage (tertiary, or
accelerated creep), the deformation rate increases up to failure. The third stage is, as a
rule, short and should be avoided, since quick failure of parts is inevitable at this stage
[18].

A physical explanation of the three stages of creep is as follows:

? Primary Creep: This stage is mainly due to dislocation movement. The creep
rate decreases with time and the effect of work hardening is more than that of the
recovery process [18].

? Secondary Creep: The rates of work hardening and recovery during this stage are
equal, so the material creeps at a steady state rate(minimum creep rate). Depend-
ing upon the state level and temperature, steady state creep may be essentially
viscous or plastic character [18].

? Tertiary Creep: Creep rate increases with time until fracture occurs in this stage.
Tertiary creep can occur due to necking of the specimen or grain boundary sliding
at high temperature and this continues until specimen fractures [18].

Figure 5.4: Creep curve at constant temperature and stress: I - transient creep stage; II
- steady stage creep; III - fracture stage [18].

The development of each stage of creep depends on the temperature and stress. The
phenomenon of creep is observable in metals, ionic and covalent crystals, amorphous
materials such as glasses and polymers. In polymers, the phenomenon of creep is im-
portant at room temperature, in alloys at 100 ?C, and in steel above 300 ?C. Metals
generally exhibit creep at high temperatures. A material subjected to a constant tensile
load at an elevated temperature will creep and undergo a time dependent deformation.
It is noted that high temperatures lead to rapid creep which is often accompanied by
microstructural changes [18].

Mechanisms of Creep

There are many mechanisms of creep, which have been proposed. Creep is a thermally
activated process. Some significant mechanisms that play vital roles during the creep
process are: dislocation climb; vacancy diffusion and grain boundary sliding [18].

An appreciable atomic movement at high temperature causes the dislocations to
climb up and down. In response to the applied stress, the diffusion rate of vacancy may
produce a motion by a simple climb of edge dislocation. Obviously, edge dislocations
are piled up by the obstacles in the glide plane and the rate of creep is governed by the
rate of escape of dislocations past obstacles [18].

Another mechanism of creep is called diffusional creep or diffusion of vacancies. The
diffusion of vacancies controls the creep rate, but the mechanism does not involve the
climb of edge dislocations. In response to the applied stress, the vacancies move from
surfaces of the specimen transverse to the stress axis to the surfaces that are parallel to
the stress axis. Over a period of time, this movement would elongate the specimen in
the direction of the stress axis and contract it in the transverse direction resulting in
creep [18].

The third mechanism of creep is the sliding of grain boundaries, i.e, sliding of neigh-
bouring grains with respect to the boundary that separate them. When compared to
individual grains, grain boundaries lose their strength at a lower temperature. This

effect arises from the non-crystalline structure of the grain boundaries and grain bound-
aries play a major role in the creep of polycrystals at high temperatures as they slide
past each other or create vacancies. At higher temperatures, ductile metals begin to
lose their ability to strain-harden and become viscous to facilitate the sliding of grain
boundaries. It is possible to detect that at temperatures above 0.5Tm the viscosity of
the grain boundaries is small enough for them to behave like a very viscous liquid sep-
arating the neighbouring grains and allowing them to slide against each other. At low
temperatures, grain boundaries do not flow viscously, but provide effective obstacles to
dislocation motion. Obviously, the grain boundaries facilitate the deformation process
by sliding at high temperatures, whereas at low temperatures, they increase the yield
strength by stopping the dislocations [18].

5.4 Thermal effects

For porous materials that suffer a relatively small amount of densification during solid
state sintering, the thermal deformation should not be ignored. Accurate simulations
of the entire sintering process require the consideration of not only the creep strain but
also the thermal strain.

5.4.1 The sintering cycle

Each material has its own optical sintering cycle. Thus, it is instructive to consider
known cycles to establish a starting point for any material. Beyond the parameters of
particle size, temperature, and time, there are further influences from the heating rate,
process atmosphere, impurity level, and intermediate holds not regularly noted [7].

The sintering cycle is the set-up of thermal conditions specifically for densifying pow-
der metal compacts. Generally, the optimal cycle is material and application dependent.
A complex sets of factors needs to be considered for the determination of an appropriate
sintering cycle. Some essential factors are some like heating rate, maximum temperature
hold time, and atmosphere [7].

Alexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis



5.Constitutive Models 51

The sintering cycle selected for this research is shown in figure 5.6. It begins with
heating at a rate of 10 ?C to a maximum temperature of 1350 ?C. After a one hour hold,
the part is cooled at 10 ?C. However, the actual sintering cycle might differ a little bit
from the designed one due to the capability of the furnace. Especially, the cooling rate
might not be as expected. If the densification is near complete after the hold, slight
variation in the cooling should not have a significant influence on the final shrinkage [1].
A comparison of the prescribed sintering cycle and an actual one can be seen in figure
5.6.

Numerical Methods

6.1 Introduction

Nowadays, with a constant evolution of competitive economy, the industrial processes
have to be adapted to the evolution of modern demands. Therefore, through the years,
PM industry has adapted to the new tools that engineering offers. With the evolution of
computers and finite element analysis, the PM industry had the necessity of abandoning
the trial and error process and starting to resort to FEM. Over time, many researchers
have had the ability of adapting an industrial physical process to a finite element model
and started to study the numerous phenomenons which occur during the process based
in numerical models. In this research, the compaction and sintering processes are re-
produced resorting to ideal models and using the finite element program as an auxiliary
tool.

In this chapter, an allusion to the FEM and to the finite element program (Abaqus)
is done. However, the major objective is to describe the models of the compaction and
sintering processes.

In the compaction process, an elasto-plastic model is used that is initial referred
in section 5.3.2 and is presented in section 6.4. In the sintering process, the model
adopted for simulating the solid phase of sintering in a finite element program is a
viscoelasticity model. The viscoelasticity model and the parameters that influence the
model in sintering are exhaustively described in section 6.5.

6.2 Finite Element Method (FEM)

The finite element method (FEM) is a powerful numeric analysis tool and enables prob-
lem resolution from various study areas, usually in an approximate form. However, this
method should be an alternatively when there are analytical approaches of solving the
problem. Additionally, when this method is used, error estimation should be taken into
consideration [14].

Essentially, FEM consists in a subdivision of continuous systems into discrete ele-
ments, in which it is possible to establish constitutive laws. This subdivision process
is designated discretization and each one of the discretized elements is designated finite
element. The several elements that constitute the solid are linked by nodes and in the
calculation process there is a necessity to extrapolate the individual model to the global

55



56 6.Numerical Methods

model, which is called assembling. In FEM, many types of elements can be applied
depending on the type of problem. In the bidimensional problems, the elements usually
applied are quadrilateral and triangular. In the tridimensional problems they are usually
hexahedrons, tetrahedrons and pentahedrons [14].

Approaching the method from the user viewpoint, it is possible to define three dif-
ferent steps. These steps are commonly called: pre-process, analysis and post-process
[14].

The pre-process step is connected to the model creation and the discretization of the
conditions submitted. Commercial software includes many graphic tools that facilitate
the task of creating the model. The finite element global analysis quality is strongly
dependent to the user’s capability to extrapolate the problem for the computation real-
ity, because it is necessary to do some simplifications and to define modelling strategies.
Sometimes, there are complex models to generate and it is common to resort to a spe-
cialized software to create the models. This is designated CAD program (Computer
Aided Design). So, the necessity of pre-processing appears, for having the ability of
interpreting and translating models from other softwares [14].

The analysis step is the most important part, because it is where all the numeric
calculation is done. However, from the user’s point of view, this step is used like a ”black
box”. During this stage, many files are generated with all the results that are wanted
by the user [14].

The last stage is about interpreting the files referred in the previous paragraph and
show them in a user friendly form. Typically, the results are presented under color maps,
which present a friendly way to interpret the results [14].

6.3 Abaqus

The finite element code adopted for this research is the Abaqus program because it has
numerous applications and good calculation power, specifically in thermo-mechanical
models. The Abaqus/CAE program uses a graphic interface, where the pre-processing
is made, and it allows to implement all the simulation architecture, starting with the
geometry, passing through temporary integration, as well as problem discretization. In
this stage, the code allows the definition of several necessary aspects and at the end it
generates an ASCII text file with INP extension, which the calculation engine processes
[14].

The analysis step is done by Abaqus/Standard or by Abaqus/Explicit, depending
on the temporal integration choice that was made in the pre-processing step. However,
in the context of this work, it is used the Abaqus/Standard, due to implicit integration
that shows more stability in the calculation process. Independently of time integration
chosen, the calculation engine generates several output files during the simulation, like
result files, error messages or warnings and the several time increments’ description
considered by the calculation engine [14].

Finally, the post-processing is realized through the Abaqus/Viewer that operates the
results file and allows the user to visualize the obtained results [14].

6.4 The Modified Drucker-Prager/Cap Model

In the first stage of the present work, for understanding the compaction phase, it was
modelled and simulated using the FEM with Abaqus. Process simulations resorting to
FEM program may be useful for controlling the shape of final PM components and can
provide the distribution of green density and stresses of the compacted parts [19] [20].

In order to have a reliable numerical simulation it is necessary to perform two tasks.
The first task is to chose an appropriate constitutive model for modelling the compaction
process in a FEM program. Secondly, well defined calibration experiments are carried
out for an easy identification of the constitutive model parameters of the powder material
[20]. This second task was not reproduced in the present work. The constitutive model
parameters used for implementing the model in the FEM program were taken from the
literature.

In the past decades, many constitutive models including micro-mechanical and macro-
mechanical models have been studied. The compaction of metals and ceramic powders
can be simulated using phenomenological elasto-plastic continuum models from soils
mechanics. These models are typically implemented in finite element codes and have
been used to investigate the macroscopic property distributions in powders during com-
paction. Specifically, in this work, it was chosen the phenomenological modified Drucker-
Prager/Cap (DPC) constitutive model which was originally intended to model geological
materials, it has been modified and adapted for metal powder compaction. The mod-
ified Drucker-Prager/Cap model defines the behaviour of powder rearrangement and
consolidation during compaction processes very well [20].

6.4.1 Description of the constitutive model

In the analysis to be made in part III, the modified Drucker-Prager/Cap elasto-plasticity
model is adopted to model the uniaxial compaction of metal powders. This model is
implemented in the library of the commercially available finite element program Abaqus.
This type of model allows the effect of the stress states to be addressed during the un-
loading (removal of the upper punch) and after the ejection (removal of the compacted
component from the die) as well as during the compression model itself [21]. In elasto-
plastic materials with work hardening, it is necessary to consider a constitutive model
that consists primarily in three parameters: the yielding criterion, the flow potential and
the hardening criteria that govern the evolution of the cap as a function of volumetric
strain [22]. The modified Drucker-Prager/Cap elasto-plasticity model allows the compu-
tation of the density distribution and the prediction of the redistribution of the density
after the load removal and during the ejection modes [21]. A typical yield surface that
characterizes this model is represented in figure 6.1. This surface is plotted in a stress
space characterized by:

p =

. (6.2)

The equations shown in 6.1 and 6.2 represent the coordinates where the equivalent
pressure or hydrostatic pressure is p and the von Mises equivalent or effective stress (also

called the second invariant of the deviatoric stress) is
?
J?2. Also, in equation 6.1 and

6.2 ?1, ?2 and ?3 are the principal stresses (compression assumed positive) [21].
In the modified Drucker-Prager/Cap model, the yield surface includes two main

segments: a shear failure surface, providing predominately shear failure (Fs) and a cap
which intersects the hydrostatic stress axis (Fc) (figure 6.1). There is also a transition
region between these segments (Ft), which is introduced to provide a smooth surface.
The cap line serves two main purposes. It bounds the yield surface in pure hydrostatic
compression, thus providing an inelastic hardening mechanism to represent the plastic
nature of the compaction. It also controls the volume dilatancy when the material yields
in shear, by providing a softening as a function of the inelastic volume increases created
as the material yields on the shear failure and the transition yield surfaces [21].

Now, the essential components of the current model are demonstrated. A linear
strain rate decomposition is assumed in the form:

d? = d?el + d?pl (6.3)

where d? is the total strain rate, d?el is the elastic strain rate, and d?pl is the inelastic
(plastic) strain rate. The elastic behaviour may be modelled as linear elastic, or by
using various types of non-linear elastic models [21]. In the current numerical analysis
the elastic response is assumed to be linear.

The yield function for admissible stresses, in the modified Drucker-Prager/cap model,
is established by three surfaces in the p-q plane. The shear surface Fs rules the initial
compaction and densification during powder compaction [22]. This criterion describes
the shear stress required for simple slip, depending on the cohesion and hydrostatic
pressure. This shear surface is defined by:

Fs(q,p) = q ?d?p.tan(?) = 0, (6.4)

where d is the material’s cohesion and ? is the material’s internal friction angle. The

Alexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis



6.Numerical Methods 59

parameters ? and d are often given some physical significance [21] but in this research
are simply regarded as unique material properties.

The cap surface, Fc is responsible for controlling the densification/hardening of the
material at large compaction pressures. The cap surface hardens or softens as a function
of the volumetric strain: volumetric plastic compaction (when yielding on the cap) causes
hardening (in a triaxial stress), while volumetric plastic dilation (when yielding on the
shear failure surface) causes shear induced softening. The cap surface is represented in
figure 6.1 and is modelled as an ellipse with a constant eccentricity in p? q space [21]
[22]. The cap surface, Fc is given by:

Fc(q,p) =

(
(p?pa)2 +

]2)1/2
?R (d + pa.tan?) = 0, (6.5)

where the constant R is the material parameter that controls the shape of the cap (equal
to the ratio of the major and minor axes of the elliptical cap), pa is an evolution parame-
ter that represents the volumetric plastic strain driven hardening/softening effects and ?
is a constant that ensures a smooth transition between the shear and cap surfaces. It is
assumed that the cap surface is a continuous family of ellipses and each one corresponds
to a value of inelastic strain rate, i.e, the relative density of the compact. A harden-
ing/softening law must be defined which relates the hydrostatic compaction yield stress,

pb, and the corresponding volumetric plastic strain ?
pl
vol (figure 6.2) [21]. The evolution

parameter pa is defined in the form:

pa =
pb ?Rd

(1 + Rtan?)
, (6.6)

where the parameter ? is a small number (typically 0.001 to 0.05) used to provide a
smooth transition surface between the shear failure surface and the cap [21].

Figure 6.2: Typical cap hardening [21].

With the objective to obtain a smooth yield surface, a transition region is defined
between the shear failure line and the cap surface using ?.

Ft(q,p) = {(p?pa)2 +[q ? (1 ??/cos?) (d + pa.tan?)]2}1/2?? (d + pa.tan?) = 0 (6.7)

Alexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis



60 6.Numerical Methods

This smooth transition between the cap and failure yield surfaces is necessary for pre-
venting the corners between these two yield surfaces and also avoid numerical instabilities
while transitioning the shear and the cap yield surfaces [22].

Plastic flow is defined by a flow potential that is associated in the deviatoric plane,
associated on the cap in the meridional plane and non-associated on the failure surface
and the transition surface in the meridional plane [21]. The flow potential, which is
similar to the yield locus, must be described in a powder compaction model, being
necessary to study the evolution of inelastic deformation that results from densification
and plastic deformation of particles. The direction of the plastic strain is controlled by
the shape of plastic flow potential [22]. The flow potential surface in the meridional
plane is shown in figure 6.3.

Figure 6.3: Flow potential in p?q plane [20].

The flow potential is made up of an elliptical portion in the cap region (equation
6.8) that is identical to the cap yield surface (equation 6.5). Another elliptical portion
in the failure and transition regions that provides the non-associated flow component in
the model is given by:

Gc = Fc(q,p) =

]2)1/2
?R (d + patan?) = 0, (6.8)

Gs = {[(p?pa) tan?]2 + q2}1/2. (6.9)

The two elliptical portions Gc and Gs form a continuous and smooth potential surface
[21].

6.5 Linear Viscoelasticity Theory

As can be deduced from its name, viscoelastic materials possess both viscous and elas-
tic properties in varying degrees. Linear viscoelasticity is the simplest response of a
viscoelastic material [15].

The linear theory of viscoelasticity was primarily applied on polymeric materials to
study their behaviour [1]. In general, research on viscoelastic behaviour of polymeric

6.Numerical Methods 61

materials and their composites are well advanced when compared to powder metallurgy
components, even though their application is extensive [23]. Materials within the scope
of viscoelasticity theory possess a capacity to store and dissipate mechanical energy. For
these materials, a state of stress induces an instantaneous deformation followed by a
flow process which may or may not be limited in magnitude as time grows. The external
loads could influenced not only by mechanical forces or stresses, but also by thermal
induced loadings, such as the hydrostatic sintering stress [1].

Since a viscoelastic material exhibits both an instantaneous elasticity effect and creep
characteristics, the material response is not determined only by the current state of stress,
but also by all past states of stress. The incremental theory of plasticity also accounts for
the history dependent material behaviour. However, the underlying difference between
the theories of plasticity and viscoelasticity is that the first is independent of the time
scale involved in loading and unloading while the second has a specific time or rate
dependence [1].

At high temperatures associated with sintering, the porous material presents elastic
and viscous types of behaviour. During pressure or pressureless whether there is a
constant or zero mechanical loading, a time-dependent strain will emerge during the
long process. This thermal induced strain is called the sintering strain, viscous strain,
or creep strain. This creep strain is similar to the traditionally defined creep strain
which results from constant mechanical loading and is both permanent time dependent.
Therefore, the viscoelasticity theory can be used to simulate the sintering process [1].

6.5.1 Viscoelasticity Models

As was said before, viscoelasticity indicates a material with the features of both a viscous
fluid and an elastic solid. The term elastic and viscous nature is the represented action
of spring and the response of a putty system. In the first case, the return of spring to
its original position when stretched and then released is an example of elastic action. In
the second case, the retaining capability of the extended state when it is pulled is an
example of viscous nature. Materials with a combination of these properties are called
viscoelastic [23].

Many viscoelasticity models have been developed to describe a wide range of defor-
mation behaviours. These models are composed by elastic and viscous components in
various configurations. Usually, the elastic component can be represented by an elastic
spring and the viscous component by a dashpot, a pot that contains a viscous liquid that
can flow under the action of a piston. A representative illustration of the deformation
behaviour of the components is shown in figure 6.4. The equations which describe the
responses of figure 6.4 are given by:

? = E? and (6.10)

? = ?

, (6.11)

where ? is the tensile stress, E is Young’s modulus and ? is the viscosity [1].

Different forms of the yield components lead to different models. A very well known
is the Maxwell model. This model consists of a spring and a dashpot placed in series.
The overall strain rate is the sum of the contributions from both components, and the

where the first part of the right hand side corresponds to the equivalent elastic strain
rate, while the second part is the creep strain rate. It is relevant to note that the
equivalent elastic strain rate is a function of the stress state, which can change with time
during sintering [1].

An alternative to the Maxwell model (figure 6.5 (a)) is the Voigt or the Kelvin model
(figure 6.5 (b)) that is characterized by a spring and a dashpot in parallel. In this model,
the strains on the two components are always the same and the overall stress is the sum
of the stresses on the spring and dashpot [1]. The corresponding constitutive equation

is given by:

? = E? + ???. (6.13)

6.5.2 Constitutive Equations

For this research, a set of constitutive equations based on the Maxwell model were
adopted, which is more suitable for describing the deformation behaviour of metals at
high temperature.

For the phenomenological model of sintering, the constitutive equation is selected as
a nonlinear viscous incompressible model containing uniformly distributed voids. The
strain rate is subdivided in a component of equivalent elastic strain rate ??e, thermal
strain rate ??t, and creep strain rate ??cr and is given by:

?? = ??e + ??t + ??cr. (6.14)

In the right hand part of equation 6.14, the elastic strain portion is assumed to be linear
and isotropic. Thus, it can be represented by:

??e =
??

C
. (6.15)

Equation 6.15 can be expressed by the rate form of Hooke’s law, as is shown in equation
6.16 [1].

?? = C??e = C
(

)
(6.16)

The stress can be calculated from the integral of equation 6.16 [1].

? =

Thermal strain is proportional to the change in temperature of the material and is
the same in all directions for an isotropic material. It can be calculated as:

?t = ? · ?T, (6.18)

where, the parameter ? represents the thermal expansion coefficient, which is usually a
function of temperature, ?T is the difference between the current and reference temper-
atures [1].

The creep strain rate, applied in this work, consists in two parts: the ratio between
the deviatoric stress ?? and shear viscosity modulus, ?s , and the ratio between the
equivalent volumetric stress and bulk viscosity modulus ?b. In order to analyse the
dimensional change of the sintering body, the creep strain rate is given by:

??cr =

where ?s is the sintering stress (sintering driving force), tr(?) is the trace of the stress
tensor and I an identity matrix. In the right side of equation 6.19, the first term
represents the shape distortion of the sintering body, and the second one determines the

volume change or density evolution. In the sintering model, the local stress equilibrium
is presented under zero external loading [1]. The local stress can be shown in figure 6.6.

The ?s, ?b and ?s are the material parameters. Generally, they are influenced by
factors such as relative density, temperature, grain size and pore size, as well as the
physical parameters of the material such as the diffusion coefficient and activation energy
[9].

6.5.3 Viscosity Modulus

Viscosity is the material resistance to viscous flow. Usually, the viscosity modulus is
temperature-dependent. During sintering, temperature has a wide variation, therefore,
the material response is expected to vary. For this study, it is reasonable to consider
the viscous flow of a thermal activated process, therefore it is employed the Arrhenius
equation given by:

? = ?0e
Qv
RT , (6.20)

where Qv is the activation energy for viscous flow, ?0 is a pre-exponential material
constant, R is the universal gas constant and T is the absolute temperature. When
the material starts to behave more like a liquid, at high sintering temperatures, the
Arrhenius relation is expected to be more accurate [1].

For a porous material, because of the existence of pore area, the parameters in the
continuous viscoelasticity theory should be modified before they can be employed. Most
of these parameters are functions of porosity. The shear viscosity modulus ?s and bulk
viscosity modulus ?b are defined as:

?s = (1 ??)2 ? and (6.21)

?b =

where ? is the porosity defined as the ratio of void and bulk volumes, and ? is the
apparent viscosity defined in equation 6.20 [1].

6.5.4 Sintering Stress

Sintering stress has an important impact on the sintering kinetics. Sintering stress,
?s, also named sintering driving force, is the equivalent hydrostatic pressure caused
by local capillary stresses in porous structures. The resulting stress gradient provides
a driving force for mass flow to the neck formed between contacting particles so that
the pore area fills with material and the density increases [1]. Sintering stress arises
from interfacial energies acting over curved surfaces and in many equations proposed
by several researches, for predicting the sintering stress, it is in function of porosity,
surface energy, particle shape and particle size [1] [9]. The expression of sintering stress
proposed by Olevsky is given by:

?s =
C?2

r0
. (6.23)

The sintering stress is widely used for numerical simulation of stainless steel sintering,
where r0 is the average radius of the powder particles, C is a material constant dependent
of the surface energy of material. Equation 6.23 is proposed for the initial sintering stage
but it is also used for the intermediate and final stages in many researches [9]. Another
way to present equation 6.23 is given by:

?s =
3?s
r?

(1 ??)2 , (6.24)

where, ? is the porosity, which is defined as the ratio of the volume of pores to the total
volume, and r? denotes the average void size or average particle radius [1].

For many crystalline materials, the dominant mass transport mechanism is through
grain boundary diffusion, which is developed in the intermediate stage of solid-state sin-
tering. In this research, the sintering behaviour of the selected material is dominated by
grain diffusion, so the sintering stress relationship considered to be the most appropriate
is one that incorporates surface tension, relative density and average grain size. For this
research, sintering stress is defined as:

?s =
6?s
G

(1 ??)2 , (6.25)

where G is the average grain size representing the influence of grain boundary diffusion
[1].

6.5.5 Grain Growth Models

Grain growth plays an important role in sintering because excessive grain size will not
only obstruct the densification, but it also influences the final mechanical properties of
the sintered components [9]. With the objective to apply the grain growth in FEM
simulation of the sintering process, it was necessary to find an empirical equation that
can accurately describe the grain size change during sintering.

Various empirical models of grain growth have been developed for different materials
and based on different mechanisms. For normal grain growth, a parabolic law and a
power law have been used in many studies. The ideal grain growth law relates the mean
grain size to initial grain size and time. The relation is called the parabolic law model
and is given by:

G2 ?G20 = K1t, (6.26)

Alexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis



66 6.Numerical Methods

while the power law is governed by:

G = K2t
n, (6.27)

where the parameter G means the mean grain size at time t, G0 is the initial mean
grain size, K1 and K2 are material constants, and n is the grain growth exponent. The
parabolic law and power law predict the grain growth in ceramics, such as alumina [1].

Here, the concern is to understand grain growth behaviour for metal alloys such as
austenitic stainless steels. It is assumed that atomic diffusion in grain growth is a simple
thermally activated process, therefore an Arrhenius-type grain growth equation fits well
in this study. Based on different experiments, various forms of Arrhenius-type grain
growth equations have been developed. For this specific case of grain growth in solid

equations in different stainless steels [1].

In table 6.1, the parameter n is an assumed integer that, in case of austenitic stainless
steel, ranges from 3 to 5, A is a material constant, QG is the activation energy for grain

This type of Arrhenius equation was chosen because of its good match in grain growth
phenomena in stainless steel 316L.

For this differential equation it was necessary to search for experimental parame-
ters. The parameter A is a pre-exponent constant, QG is the activation energy for grain
growth, R is the universal gas constant, T is the absolute temperature and G is the
instantaneous grain size. The pre-exponent constant is determined experimentally. In
this research, the only interest is to understand the grain growth behaviour in computa-
tional simulation. Thus, it is assumed a pre-exponent factor A from the literature. Now
focusing on activation energy for grain growth, it is known for stainless steel the activa-
tion energy shifts from an upper level to a lower level after a transition temperature is
reached [25]. The parameters values are presented in subsection 7.3.3.

Implementation

7.1 Introduction

As has been mentioned, this research is divided in two major areas: the compaction
stage and the sintering stage.

For compacting the loose powder in a certain shape to form a porous body it is
necessary to select a suitable model. Therefore, the modified Drucker-Prager/Cap elasto-
plastic model for implementing the compaction stage was selected. It is the most adopted
model for reproducing compression of a loose powder in a finite element program. This
model works largely in the inelastic zone, so the elastic behaviour in the compaction stage
is minimal, being predominantly characterized by the plastic behaviour. In addition
to the Drucker-Prager implementation, the objective is also to estimate the density
gradients. Therefore, the UVARM subroutine in conjunction with the modified Drucker-
Prager/Cap elasto-plastic model is implemented, in the finite element program.

The sintering stage, which is a long process due to its slow evolution, which may
last hours, follows. However, it is time-dependent and it is considered as a quasi-static
problem. For implementing the sintering process considering the solid-state of sintering,
many mechanisms important in sintering are taken into account. All the sintering mecha-
nisms are implemented resorting to a user’s subroutine, which is the CREEP subroutine.
The implementation of this subroutine is based on the concepts presented in section 7.3.
The compaction and sintering processes and auxiliary tools that were implemented in
this research are explained in the following sections.

7.2 Modified Drucker-Prager/Cap Model in ABAQUS

The Drucker-Prager/Cap model is provided within the library of the commercial finite
element program Abaqus. Therefore, in order to use the soil plasticity model, in the
compaction stage, it is only needed material parameters. In chapter 6.4 the three surfaces
that define the model were characterized: a pressure-dependent Drucker-Prager shear
failure surface (Fs), a series of compression yield surfaces (Fc), and a transition surface
(Ft). Volumetric strain hardening is defined by moving the cap along the hydrostatic
axis. The purpose of the transition surface is to remove any singularities during numerical
computations when moving from the yield surface to the failure surface. Figure 6.1 shows
the surfaces defined by the modified Drucker-Prager/Cap model in ABAQUS. The three

surfaces are described by the equations 6.4, 6.5 and 6.7 [4]. In this three equations, it is
necessary to define the material parameters, given by:

? ? is the angle of internal friction;

? d is the material cohesion;

? t is the deviatoric stress measure;

? p is the equivalent pressure stress;

? R is the cap eccentricity parameter;

? pa

? ? is the transition parameter

The hardening law is defined by a piecewise linear function relating the hydrostatic
compression yield stress, pb, to the volumetric plastic strain ?

pl
vol as shown in figure

6.2. ?
pl
vol|0 is the initial volumetric plastic strain beyond which the work hardening yield

surfaces are defined. The evolution parameter, pa is related to pb by equation 6.6 [4].

7.2.1 UVARM Subroutine

The subroutine UVARM is used in the compaction phase. This subroutine is defined
at the material part and is applied when there is a necessity of defining a user output
variable. The UVARM subroutine is called at all integration points, being called multiple
times for each material point in an increment, as Abaqus iterates to a converged solution
[26].

In this study, the UVARM subroutine was used because there was a necessity to define
output quantities that are function of any of the available integration point quantities
listed in the output variables. Therefore, with the purpose of studying the density
gradients the UVARM subroutine was employed.

In order to extract the values of density at every integration point it was applied a
simple model that combines strains with densities. In compaction, the external physical
change is a decrease in volume, so the equation that translates this assumption is given
by:

?z + ?r + ?? =
V0 ?V1
V0

. (7.1)

Equation 7.1 represents the fractional change in the initial volume, where ?z, ?r and
?? are the strains in the axial, radial and tangential directions, respectively and V0 and
V1 are volumes of the green compact before and after the compaction respectively [21].
The expression presented in 7.1 can be manipulated and written as:

?z + ?r + ?? = ?total =
?0 ??1
?1

(7.2)

Equation 7.2 is the fractional change in the final mean density, where ?0 and ?1 are
the initial and final densities of the green body. Thus, the local density distribution may
be calculated from the total strain value, ?total being defined as [21]:

?1 =
?0

1 + ?total
(7.3)

7.Implementation 69

The UVARM subroutine uses equation 7.3. This subroutine is an Abaqus/Standard
utility that allows the determination and visualization of the density gradients. These
gradients are essential to finish the compaction phase and start the sintering phase.

7.3 Sintering Stage

In this section, all the parameters necessary to implement the sintering simulation are
defined. The major parameters that influence the sintering behaviour are defined: i) the
elasticity and viscosity; ii) the sintering stress and transition temperature parameters;
iii) the grain growth and iv) the porosity and thermal strain. All these parameters are
implemented in the CREEP subroutine that is established in the sintering simulation
and which is described in section 7.3.6.

7.3.1 Elasticity and Viscosity

The elastic modulus can vary directly with temperature. In other words, with the in-
creasing of temperature the elastic modulus decreases. Additionally, the elastic modulus
of a porous material is smaller than that of the bulk solid material. Many attempts have
been made to relate parameters like elasticity modulus with the porosity because in the
sintering stage some parameters are directly related with average porosity. However,
some researches demonstrated with numerical experiments that the final result of the
sintering simulation is not sensitive to small changes in elastic modulus. The constant
Young’s modulus is determined by:

E = E0?
Y , (7.4)

where E0 is the full density elastic modulus which will decrease as temperature increases
and is approximately 140 GPa at 500 ?C and the exponent Y equals 3.4 for sintered
steel. For this research, ?, the bulk density is equals to 62%. Furthermore, the constant
Young’s modulus equals 69.3 GPa. Additionally, a constant Poisson’s ratio, 0.28, is used
[1].

The apparent viscosity in a thermally activated viscous flow was modelled by the Ar-
rehnius temperature, equation 6.20. Some material parameters constants are employed
in the Arrhenius temperature relation, which are the pre-exponential factor, ?0, that
usually takes the value of 790 MPa.s and the activation energy, Qv, that is equal to 20.0
kJ/mol [1].

7.3.2 Porosity/Relative Density

In every time increment, the porosity/relative density is updated using the strain com-
ponent. In the sintering stage, geometric nonliearity should be accounted for, due to
large deformation during the evolution of the sintering cycle. The relative density can
be described in terms of logarithmic strain components as:

? = ?0e
(??kk), (7.5)

where ?0 is the initial relative density, ? is the final relative density, and ?kk is the
volumetric strain. When this relation is implemented in CREEP subroutine, ?kk is
approximated by the swelling strain ??sw, which is updated at the beginning of each
increment [1].

7.3.3 The Grain Growth Model

The grain size is updated using the Arrhenius type equation grain growth that is shown
in equation 6.28. For this empirical differential equation, some material constant param-
eters must be defined. The pre-exponent constant, A, is determined experimentally. In
this research, the only interest is understanding the grain growth behaviour in compu-
tational simulation. Therefore, a pre-exponent for stainless steel powder was adopted,
in this case equal to 6, 75 × 10?13 m2/s. The activation energy for grain growth, QG,
is 316 kJ/mol for temperatures less than approximately 1200 ?C and 50.0 kJ/mol when
temperatures are greater than approximately 1200 ?C.

7.3.4 Sintering Stress

The sintering stress used in the sintering stage is described by equation 6.25. This
sintering stress, ?s, is related directly with surface tension energy, average grain size and
relative density. The relative density is updated using the volumetric strain components
(relation 7.5). The surface tension energy, ?s, is a constant parameter and in the sintering
stage a value of 2.0 J/m2 is applied.

7.3.5 Thermal Strain

The thermal strain, ??t, is caused by expansion/contraction and it can be expressed by:

??t = ??T, (7.6)

where ? is the thermal expansion coefficient and ?T is temperature increment. Based on
the assumption of the transition temperature for sintering stress, the thermal expansion
dominates at low temperatures, i.e, temperatures below the transition temperature. The
temperature dependent behaviour of the thermal expansion coefficient can be determined
by experiments carried out in the dilatometer. For this research, experimental data is
adopted from the literature. In the literature, the conclusion was that the thermal
expansion coefficient of a porous material is in general slightly smaller than that of the
fully dense material. For this research, the major concern is in the deformation due to
sintering, considering that the thermal deformation is not the main concern taking into
account the deformations acting in the sintering stage. So, a linear empirical equation
is applied to describe the thermal expansion coefficient as a function of temperature by:

? = c1T + c2, (7.7)

where C1 and C2 are measured material constant taken from experiments. For this
research, and for a material like stainless steel, C1 assumes the value 4.47 × 10?9K?2
and C2 is 12.1 × 10?6K?1 [1].

7.3.6 CREEP subroutine

In order to employ the model presented in section 6.5, the Abaqus subroutine CREEP
is used. User subroutine CREEP will be called at all integration points of elements
for which the material definition contains user-subroutine-defined metal creep and time-
dependent volumetric swelling, during procedures that allow viscoelastic response of the

7.Implementation 71

types referenced to occur (such as the quasi-static procedure). The user subroutine is
applied to define a material behaviour that can be used in the coupled-temperature
displacement.

For metals, the incremental creep strain routine allows swelling and creep as defined
in 7.8 [1].

??cr =
1

3
???swR + ???crn (7.8)

Equation 7.8 is defined as ???sw being the incremental volumetric swelling strain and
???cr the uniaxial equivalent creep strain. The incremental volumetric swelling strain
and the uniaxial equivalent creep strain are defined by the user in the subroutine based
on the creep model. For isotropic swelling R becomes the unit matrix I. The gradient
of the deviatoric stress potential n is defined in relation 7.9 [1].

n =

??

In relation 7.9 the deviatoric stress is given by:

where p = ?1

tr(?) is the equivalent pressure stress. The equivalent deviatoric stress is

given by:

creep strain rate:

main program in every increment. In the subroutine, the shear viscosity modulus ?s,

72 7.Implementation

the bulk viscosity modulus ?b, and the sintering stress ?s are also introduced and all are
based in equations 6.21, 6.22 and 6.23. The sintering stress is called at all integration
points of the element at each time increment [1].

7.3.7 Creep Subroutine Architecture

The creep subroutine was implemented into the sintering stage. In the creep subroutine
was essentially written the viscoelastic model described in 6.5.1. The viscoelasticity
model was built under a conventional model presented in the next topics. Thus, the
implementation of the viscoelasticity model in the subroutine followed a specific order:

First Load the material constants, which are: initial grain size (G0); pre-exponent factor
(A); activation energy for viscous flow (Qv); a pre-exponential material constant
(?0) and the universal gas constant (R);

Second The grain growth behaviour. The Arrhenius equation that controls the grain
size is applied (equation 6.28) and the activation energy (QG) in function of the
transition temperature is written;

Third The surface tension energy (?s). Surface energy is activated when temperature
is above of the transition temperature;

Fourth In this point, the principal mechanism written in the creep subroutineis ex-
plained. The objective is to determine the porosity, and consequently the density.
In the sintering simulation the density is updated at every increment using the
relation refereed in 7.5. In the creep subroutine, the parameter ?kk is assumed to
be equal to the swelling strain ??sw and it is known that the swelling strain that is
updated at the beginning of each increment is given by equation 7.15. The swelling
strain is directly dependent on the viscosity modulus (6.22) and on the sintering
stress (6.25). On the other hand, the viscosity modulus and the sintering stress are
directly dependent on the viscous flow (equation 6.20), and on the average grain
size (equation 6.20), that are also dependent of porosity (?) and surface tension
energy (?s). With this description it is noticed that all equations are dependent
on one of the others for certain parameters, and one of them is the porosity that
are intimately connected with density. Therefore, it was necessary to resort to an
iteration method to estimate the value of porosity, and with that, calculate all the
material equations refereed before. Thus, the bissection method was applied for
estimating the value of porosity. With the porosity estimated, the viscous flow (?)
was easily calculated followed by the viscosity modulus (?b). Next, the sintering
stress (?s) is calculated based on the estimative of porosity (?) and the second and
the third topics, already described, were also calculated. With these values, the
swelling strain(??sw) necessary for determining the density is calculated. When the
value of density (?) is determined, the porosity (?) value is calculated and that
value is used for calculating another iteration using the bissection method;

Fifth Update the value of the volumetric swelling strain ???sw (equation 7.15) and
calculate the value of the uniaxial equivalent creep strain ???cr (equation 7.16);

Sixth Define the values of relevant parameters in solution-dependent variables (SDV).

7.3.8 Bissection Method

As was refereed before, the implementation of the viscoelastic model follows a specific
order in the calculation process. It should be noticed that the shear modulus, the vis-
cosity and the sintering stress are dependent of porosity. However, the porosity variable
is determined in the last part of calculations in the creep subroutine. Consequently,
an iterative process is required and an initial estimative has to be made. In order to
implement a robust and methodical iterative process the bissection method is used. This
method consists in building subintervals, Ik = [ak,bk] ? I, through successive divisions
in the middle of the interval. Thus, the value that is to be estimated is confined in
intervals as small as we wish.

The algorithm that describes this method is:

1. I0 = [a0,b0] = [a,b];

2. Ik = [ak,bk] ,k = 1, 2, ..., and consider xk+1 the midpoint of the interval Ik,

xk+1 =
ak + bk

2
(7.17)

Considering, in equation 7.17, that it is possible to define ak+1 = ak and bk+1 = xk+1,
and, on the other hand define ak+1 = xk+1 and bk+1 = bk. In these two scenarios, a new
interval Ik = [ak+1,bk+1] is built, where the precise value that is wanted is contained.
The new subinterval has a length, that is half the length of the previous subinterval,
which is shown in relation:

|ak+1 ? bk+1| =
1

2
|ak ? bk|. (7.18)

In summary, this method generates from the initial interval I0 = [a,b] successive
intervals Ikk=1,2,... verifying I0 ? I1 ? I2...,, where there is an ? ? Ik,k = 0, 1, 2, ..., such
that f (?) = 0.

7.4 Implementation

In the previous sections, the models used in the compaction and sintering stages were
demonstrated. Now, the kinetics of the two stages is presented, resorting to a schematic
in figure 7.2, and the work developed in the implementation is explained with special
focus in the applied subroutines. All the research work was done resorting to a finite
element program and, essentially, using subroutines as auxiliary tools.

Beginning on the compaction stage, the main goal was to compact the loose powder.
For compacting the loose powder the criteria of soils plasticity was applied. The main
goal was to study the density gradients at the end of the compaction stage, when the
specimen is free of rigid bodies. Therefore, to study the density gradients it was necessary
to apply a subroutine, UVARM, on the model. It was important to save the densities
in a database because in the second stage there is an input of the density gradients
from the compaction stage. Therefore, a subroutine called WRITE was created for
writing the density values from every element in the final of compaction stage. At this
point, the compaction stage ends and the sintering stage begins. Before starting the

Alexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis



7.Implementation 75

sintering stage an input of the information needed from the previous stage was made.
The orphan mesh and residual stresses were loaded from the compaction simulation.
These two informations were placed in the sintering input file. The density values written
in database from the last increment of the compaction stage were also loaded for the
sintering simulation. For loading the values, another subroutine, called READ, was
created. This subroutine has the task of reading the values of density that were in
database. The READ subroutine was placed into the main subroutine CREEP. The
subroutine CREEP along with the subroutine READ and the information loaded from
the compaction stage were fundamental for creating the sintering simulation.

It is possible to see the previous explanation of the implementation work in schemat-
ically in figure 7.2. The user subroutines UVARM and CREEP are described more
detailed in sections 7.2.1 and 7.3.6.

7.5 CREEP Subroutine Validation

The implemented models validation is crucial. For material models implemented using
user’s subroutine (CREEP) is extremely important to perform some control tests. Thus,
in a first phase, the CREEP subroutine is validated in a simple model. After the CREEP
subroutine is calibrated for this model, it is then applied in the case study presented in
section 8.2.

Therefore, the test is realized in a specimen with a unitary dimension. For validating
this test, a minimum number of elements is applied just for avoiding locking effects. For
this test, four elements CAX4T were applied. This test consists in a displacement in
the vertical direction. The bottom of the specimen is restricted in x and y directions.
For testing the temperature field, a temperature starting at room temperature, around
18 ?C and growing until to 1000 ?C is applied.

Here, the main concern is to understand the subroutine’s mechanical behaviour. So,
the creep and the swelling strain were taking into account for analysing the results,
consistency and verifying the implementation. The results are presented in a graphic
way like shown in figure 7.4 and 7.5. They represent the swelling and creep strain control
along the heat cycle.

Figure 7.3: Boundary conditions of the specimen.

In the initial tests, the values of swelling and creep strain were extremely exaggerated.
This was due to the material parameters not being in a coherent unit scale. After
calibrating the material parameters, new tests were performed, and a new problem in
calculating the porosity was identify. In a first phase, the porosity value was not correct,
and with incorrect value in porosity, others parameters were influenced and with that,
the swelling and creep strain were also influenced. Therefore, a calibration of the iterative
method for extracting the correct value of porosity was performed. With that, the creep
and swelling values starting assuming the values as presented in figure 7.4 and 7.5.

Furthermore, the swelling and creep strain represent the most important variables in
the subroutine CREEP. The swelling and creep strains increments are given by relations
7.15 and 7.16 referred in section 7.3.6. The swelling strain is not represented in absolute

78 7.Implementation

value, so assumes negative values, like represented in figure 7.4. In relation 7.15 it is
obvious that the swelling strain is directly dependent of the equivalent pressure stress (p),
of the sintering stress (?s) and of the viscosity modulus (?b). Therefore, in this test, an
initial pressure in the upper surface was applied, like shown in figure 7.3. This pressure
was applied with the objective to start the swelling strain behaviour at 0 seconds. If
this initial pressure did not exist the swelling strain would just start when the transition
temperature was reached, because that is when the sintering stress starts to have effect.
At this point, the interest is not in a typical sintering behaviour but in accurate values.
In the graphic 7.4, the swelling strain takes values relatively acceptable for this initial
test. So, it is also concluded that the viscosity modulus, which is influenced by the
Arrhenius equation is working well. The sintering cycle does not have much influence in
this test, because it was just given a ramp of heating to 1000 ?C and the sintering stress
just starts to work at 918 ?C. So, the control on the sintering stress may not be accurate.

The creep strain is dependent on the equivalent deviatoric stress and on the shear
modulus. Like was explained in the swelling strain, applying an initial pressure influenced
the creep strain. The creep strain’s behaviour, like in the swelling strain, starts at 0
seconds influenced by the equivalent deviatoric stress. Here, the concern was to control
the shear modulus, that is given by the porosity and Arrhenius equation. Therefore, the
control in the creep strain was precise in the porosity and in the Arrhenius equation.
So, while for the swelling strain the adjustments had to be made, in the creep strain this
was not necessary.

This validation test was mainly general, not fully demonstrating the actual influence
of the CREEP subroutine in the sintering process simulation. Here, the objective was
for adjusting material parameters, adjusting the units, calculating the porosity with the
bisection method and observing how the creep and swelling strain behave. In fact, there
is not a reference value for comparing the values presented in figure 7.4 and 7.5, so they
were assumed correct for implementing the creep subroutine in the case study.

Problem Description and
Discretization

8.1 Introduction

In this chapter, the geometrical model is discretized, where the compaction and sin-
tering models presented in sections 7.2 and 7.3, were validated. It starts with simple
geometries, for validating a material model, like described in subsection 7.3.6. Most of
the geometrical models used for validating subroutines like the one used in this work
(CREEP subroutine) are axisymmetrical models. Usually, the geometrical model is a
simple disk, that is subjected to a compaction test and, subsequently, to a sintering
process. The disk could have a simple geometry, i.e., without an interior section or be
more complex and have a cavity. For this work, it is also adopted a simple disk, without
any cavity, because it is the most used geometrical model for beginning studies in this
field.

Furthermore it is also important to describe the model in what comes to the level
of steps and boundary conditions applied in the finite element program. As it was
said along this work, it is important to define the problem in a compaction process
and in a sintering process. Firstly, the boundary conditions in the compaction process
are presented. These are mainly mechanical conditions and are presented in subsection
8.2.1. Following on, the thermal conditions used in the sintering process are presented
in section 8.2.2.

8.2 Case study

The model adopted for implementing all the concepts that were described in previous
chapters was an axisymmetric model, more specifically a cylindrical specimen as shown
in figure 8.1.

8.2.1 Compaction Simulation

In the specimen shown in figure 8.1, an elasto-plastic criteria based on the modified
Drucker-Prager/Cap described in 7.2 was implemented. A user’s UVARM subroutine

was also implemented and is described in 7.2.1. These two topics, explained in chapter
7, describe the material behaviour along the compaction simulation.

Uniaxial die compaction in a single act was applied in the loose powder. Therefore,
the upper punch performs the movement of compressing the loose powder. The lower
punch and the die do not move along the process of compaction, except in the end of
the of compaction stage, when the powder is already compacted and the punches release
the green body.

For simulating the compaction process 3 steps were necessary, and each one had a
relative time of 1 second. In the first step the tools were assigned. The objective here
was to reproduce the contact of the punches and of the die cavity with the loose powder
(the specimen). Therefore, an interaction on the die surface with the specimen was
used and the condition for the lower and upper punches was applied. In the compaction
simulation process, the rigid tool that simulates the lower punch for holding the specimen
was substituted for a boundary condition, where the displacement in the z ?direction
was restricted. In the second step, the compaction movement was realized, this is, the
upper punch realized the movement of compression on the loose powder. In this step, the
loose powder gained the shape of the die cavity. For that, a displacement in the upper
surface was applied to simulate the movement of the punch compacting the specimen.
At last, in step 3 the tools were released, and left the specimen relaxation. In this
step, the movement of the upper punch was deactivated. A displacement was applied
in the die surface with 3 mm in the r ? direction and the lower punch stayed, with
the boundary condition of the first step applied, in the bottom of the specimen. In
figure 9.19, the movements of the tools in the simulation of the compaction process are
graphically represented .

Like was said in the previous paragrapher, in an attempt to simplify the compaction
simulation process, the upper punch and the lower punch were substituted for rota-
tion/displacement boundary conditions. This solution simplified the global convergence
of the simulation, because the contact interactions were limited to the die and the spec-

imen, where there is a real interest in understanding the friction between these two
surfaces. Therefore, the convergence in contact interactions is faster, simplifying the
global convergence of the problem. For the compaction simulation, the boundary con-
ditions and loading conditions are represented in figure 8.2.

Figure 8.2: Boundary conditions for single acting compaction process, adapted from [27].

Figure 8.3: Movement of the punches.

The case study presented in figure 8.1 is an axisymmetric specimen, thus, the element
types available are restricted to axisymmetric elements. In axisymmetric problems, it
is necessary to consider that coordinate 1 is r and coordinate 2 is z. At ? = 0 the
r ?direction corresponds to the global x?direction and z ?direction corresponds to
the global y ?direction. This is important when data is given in global directions [26].
So, the element type applied in this case study was a continuum stress/displacement,
axisymmetric with nonlinear and 4 nodes bilinear that defines the element CAX4. It was
selected complete integration instead of reduced integration because the accuracy with

86 8.Problem Description and Discretization

complete integration is better than with reduced integration. In reduced integration,
there is just one point of calculation in all the element, therefore the computation time
is faster comparatively to complete integration which has four points of calculation in
all the element.

Figure 8.4: Specimen meshed with CAX4 elements.

With the objective of having an accurate simulation, in a first phase an intermediate
mesh was established, i.e., neither a coarse mesh, that leads to low accuracy results,
neither a mesh with excessive elements, that requires a larger computational time. For
this case study a mesh with 648 elements and 700 nodes was used, concluding that will
be the most adequate mesh to obtain results.

8.2.2 Sintering Simulation

In the sintering process simulation, the geometry adopted was imported from the com-
paction process simulation. Therefore, after the compaction simulation the model is
passed to the sintering simulation. In practical terms, the specimen where the sintering
behaviour is applied is shown in figure 8.5.

The boundary conditions applied on the green body are divided into two parts, as
expressed by:

? = ?c + ?f, (8.1)

where ? is the total surfaces of the sintering body, ?c is the surfaces contacted with the
surface of the chamber, ?f is the free surfaces exposed in the sintering atmosphere [9].
Equation 8.1 is illustrated in figure 8.6.

Figure 8.6: Description of boundaries in the sinterning model.

Relatively to thermal boundary conditions it is established that the temperature of
the sintering body changes with the thermal cycle in the furnace. The parts absorb
the heat via thermal conduction, convection and radiation. The thermal boundary
conditions can be expressed as:

?X???,T = f
(
X?,t

)
, (8.2)

where f
(
X?,t

)
is the temperature distribution function, X? is the spatial position in the

model and t is the time. For the sintering of small components, the temperature gradients
in the sintering body are small unless the heating process is very quick. However, there
are, usually, temperature gradients in the furnace [9].

The sintering process simulation were divided in two steps defined by coupled temp-
displacement. In the first step, the heating ramp and the holding time were applied, so
this step had a time period of approximately 11592 seconds corresponding to 2 hours and
20 minutes of heating ramp at 10 ?C and 1 hour of holding time. The second step is the
cooling step, where another 2 hours and 20 minutes of cooling ramp were applied. The
two steps applied in this sintering process simulation have basis on the ideal sintering
cycle shown in figure 8.7.

Relatively to the mesh of the specimen in the sintering simulation, as was previously
referred, the geometry was imported from the compaction simulation. So, the mesh was
also imported from the compaction stage. Therefore, after the compaction simulation
finished the deformed mesh is imported to the sintering simulation, so the number of
nodes and elements stays constant. The only change is due to the type of element.

For sintering simulation, a coupled thermal/displacement element like the CAX4T was
applied. This element is characterized for 4-node bilinear displacement temperature.

8.3 Model Validation

After all descriptions presented in previous sections about the implementation of powder
metallurgy, it is now necessary to validate the model. Therefore, an initial validation
with a single element in the disk model in section 8.2 was conducted considering all the
conditions explained in subsections 8.2.1 and 8.2.2. This validation test is essential before
starting the analysis of the model with all sensibility considerations. It is not possible to
validate the compaction and sintering model for an exhaustive analysis if the model is
not controlled for the simplest case. After an initial validation and understanding that
all the mechanisms implemented are properly controlled, it follows the same proceeding
for the disk case.

This validation process starts with the compaction process simulation. The model
of compaction is presented in figure 8.8. In this first part of the work it is necessary
to interact the UVARM subroutine with the compaction simulation, with the objective
to control the density increase along the compaction process. Other variables like von
Mises stresses, and total strains are also important to take into account.

The control made in this phase was about the variables that were necessary to mon-
itor in the compaction process. Therefore the control of relative density (figure 8.9),
plastic volumetric strain (figure 8.10) and axial pressure (figure 8.11) is presented.

In figure 8.9, the relative density behaviour increased as expected. The relative den-
sity increased, essentially, during the second step, when the loose powder was compacted.
The increase in relative density, is intimately related with the plastic volumetric strain.
Therefore, when the plastic volumetric strain started to increase the relative density

also started increasing. The plastic volumetric strain behaviour (figure 8.10) matched
perfectly with the relative density behaviour (figure 8.9). Finally, in this validation test,
the axial stress was verified. The axial stress (figure 8.11) had the expected behaviour,
this is, it increased along the compaction movement, and decreased when the compact
is released. Hence, the compaction simulation model had the expected behaviour, and
were created conditions in the compact for starting the sintering process simulation.

After controlling the model in the compaction process simulation, it is now necessary
to control the model in the sintering stage. The sintering stage is more critical than the
compaction stage because there are some material variables to control. Therefore, a
first approach was made in subsection 7.5 for controlling the model material variables
(CREEP subroutine), but for a insignificantly example. In this stage, the objective is to
control the sintering variables for 1 element model for controlling the CREEP subroutine,
but for a sintering process done after the compaction stage. Therefore, two variables,
in specific, were controlled: the swelling and creep strain that are essential for the good
behaviour of the sintering process simulation. After this control, just for prevention, the
relative density was analysed, demonstrating that the relative density still increases in
the sintering process.

It is noted in figure 8.12 and 8.13 that the strains had an acceptable behaviour for the
implemented material model. At this point, it was not an objective to enter in details
about the behaviour of these two strains, but it is noted that the swelling and creep
strains started increasing when the Arrhenius equation had influence in the sintering
process and the porosity started decreasing with the beginning of grain growth. This
led to the start of the relative density in the sintering process simulation.

Case Study Analysis

9.1 Introduction

After all implementation tests were validated, it is now time for validating the model
with the necessary conditions for a careful analysis in the compaction process simulation
(section 9.2), and in the sintering process simulation (section 9.3). All the model dis-
cretization was done in chapter 8. This chapter is essentially presented for an assertive
discussion of results. In a first phase, the compaction stage and the following sintering
stage are discussed in detail. First, this discussion is focused on the accuracy of the
mesh, like was explained in section 8.2.1, where four selected elements were analized
(figure 9.1). Following, a sensitivity study is made (section 9.4), where the objective is
now focused on the mesh accuracy.

9.2 Compaction Stage Analysis

In order to start the compaction stage analysis, the centroids of four elements of the
mesh applied on the specimen were chosen. The elements selected for this analysis can
be seen in figure 9.1.

Figure 9.1: Four critical elements selected.

94 9.Case Study Analysis

The initial relative density is established at 0.381. When the compaction process
begins, the relative density behaviour tends to increase, i.e., when the upper punch
starts the downward movement, the density automatically starts to increase.

Initially, there is a completely porous body. At the beginning of the process, the die
cavity is filled with metallic powder so, the porosity is high and the density is low. At
the moment in which the metallic powder starts to be compacted the void spaces start
being less, the porosity starts decreasing and the density increasing until the porous
specimen or green body with the shape of the die cavity is obtained. In figure 9.2, it is
possible to see the initial dimensions of the specimen (the contour line in black) and the
dimensions in the final of the compaction stage (the green body with mesh applied). As
it is possible see in the legend, the displacement is around 9 mm, so the specimen was
compacted to half of the initial heigh.

Figure 9.2: The compaction stage, at the beginning and at the end of the process.

The relative density (RD) gradients at the end of the compaction stage, i.e., after the
loose powder is compacted and the tools released, are shown at figure 9.4. For comparing,
it is shown in figure 9.3 the plastic volumetric strain (?

pl
v ) at the end of compaction

stage. The two parameters are intimately connected by relation 2.13. Therefore, the
two behaviours are shown in figure 9.3 and 9.4.

As it is possible to see in figure 9.4, the relative density assumes values around 0.6.
In fact, looking at figure 9.4, it is noticed that the values of relative density do not
change significantly. The relative density presents its higher value in the superior right
vortex of the specimen. This value is high in that zone because it is, supposedly, the
local where the specimen is in contact with the die wall and, at the same time, with
the upper punch vortex that practises the compaction movement. This, associated with
the friction between the specimen and the die wall, reflects the higher relative density
value in that zone. On the other hand, the lowest relative density value is located in the
right bottom vortex of the specimen, where it is in contact with the lower punch vortex
and the die wall. Due to the lower punch function of holding the specimen while the
upper punch compacts the specimen, and to the friction between the die wall and the
specimen, lower values of relative density are obtained at the bottom of the specimen.

For a better analysis of the density, a short study about the density behaviour in the
elements was made, which is shown in figure 9.1. This study is addressed in figures 9.5,

9.6, 9.7 and 9.8.

Figure 9.5: Evolution of relative density during the compaction stage.

Looking at figure 9.5, it was noticed that while the plastic volumetric strain did not
start, the initial relative density stayed constant. The first step, is a step for establishing
contact of the tools with the specimen and for applying the boundary conditions, which
explains why the relative density did not change until the step time of 1.

In the second step time, the upper punch started its movement for compacting the
loose powder, therefore, the plastic volumetric strain started. With the beginning of the
volumetric plastic strain, the relative density started to increase. After the compaction
process finished, i.e., after the specimen was converted to half of its original height, the
relative density turned to a constant value during the release of the tools. This can be
seen in figure 9.5 in the step time from 2 to 3.

In figure 9.6, it is possible to verify that during the compaction process of loose pow-
der, the density is increasing at the same time that the axial stress increases. Therefore,
high densities occur when axial stress assumes high values. Note that for obtaining a
compaction of 50% of the initial height, an axial stress between 160 MPa and 170 MPa
is necessary. This happens in the compaction loading process. In the unloading process
the specimen is released from the tools and the axial stress turns to zero.

In figure 9.7, it is verified that in the loading phase the maximum value of axial
pressure is registered when the volumetric plastic strain is maximum. This is coherent
with what is seen in figure 9.6, since relative density and plastic volumetric strain are in-
timately related. So, figures 9.6 and 9.7 show the same behaviour during the compaction
stage.

In figure 9.8, the stress relatively to step time is analysed. As it is possible to see in
figure 9.8, the stress increases exponentially during the compaction stage, i.e, the stress
increases during the loading process. The stress reaches its maximum at the end of

loading stress. After that, the unloading process starts and the stress decreases linearly
remaining, at the end, the residual stress.

9.3 Sintering Stage Analysis

In this section, the behaviour of the specimen during the sintering is analysed. Here, the
specimen ended the compaction stage and is at the beginning of the sintering. Therefore,
the variables that influence directly the sintering are analysed. For that, the sintering
cycle is considered to be the reference cycle for this study. Looking at figure 9.1, the
analysis will be made in four elements of the specimen, the same elements that were
analysed in the compaction model.

It starts for analysing the contour plot of the density gradients. Thus, in figure
9.9, the density gradients at the beginning of the sintering process simulation (the same
gradients as in the end of the compaction stage) and the density gradients at the end
of the sintering process simulation (after occurring coarsening and densification) are
presented.

Next, the sintering stress is presented (figure 9.10) which affects the specimen during
the sintering. Here, is presented the sintering stress that affects the specimen at the
transition temperature in the heating ramp and at the transition temperature in the
cooling ramp.

The stresses at the beginning of the sintering process are the residual stresses coming
from the compaction stage. In the sintering process simulation, the residual stresses are
mainly affected by thermal effects. In figure 9.11 it is possible to see the stresses at the
beginning of the compaction stage and the residual stress at the end of the sintering
stress simulation.

The specimen temperature field at the beginning of the sintering process is at room
temperature 20 ?C (293 K). As the temperature increases, the compact temperature field
stops being an homogeneous field and starts to be an heterogeneous field as figure 9.12
shows. Naturally, the edges that are directly in contact with the sintering atmosphere
heat faster than the internal compact (figure 9.12 (a)). On the other hand, during the
cooling ramp the internal compact tends to have a slower cooling rate than the edges in
direct contact with the sintering atmosphere (figure 9.12 (b)).

The grain size is one of the properties that directly affects the compact during sin-
tering. It is necessary to control the grain growth, for minimizing its influence in the
densification of the specimen. At the beginning of the sintering stage, the compact grain

size was considered to be homogeneous (4.36 µm). At the heating ramp, until the transi-
tion temperature is not reached, the grain growth did not affect the sintering. After the
transition temperature is reached, the grain starts growing. In the end of the sintering
stage, the grain growth is given by the contour plot presented in figure 9.13. Observing
figure 9.13 it can be concluded that grain size is bigger in zones that are closer to the
sintering atmosphere. In the interior zones of the specimen, the grain size is smaller.
However, general, at the end of sintering, the specimen has an homogeneous grain size
value, around (39µm).

Figure 9.13: Grain size at the end of the sintering stage.

Focus now on the study made in four different elements of the same mesh. It was
adopted the four critical elements considered in the compaction analysis (figure 9.1). In
this phase, the axial shrinkage study (figure 9.14), the relative density behaviour during
the sintering stage (figure 9.15), and the stress studies, the sintering stress (figure 9.16)
and von Mises stresses are presented (figure 9.17).

In figure 9.14, independently on the element in analysis, the general shrinkage be-
haviour starts with a volume expansion (when shrinkage takes negative values it means
an expansion takes place, when shrinkage takes positive values occurs contraction). This
happens because the specimen has initially accumulated the residual stresses from the
compaction process, and also it is also affected by the initially heating ramp, where the
thermal expansion effects are more pronounced. Therefore, there is a smooth expansion
at the beginning of the sintering cycle. This smooth expansion is more noticeable in
elements 1 and 24 and it remains to temperatures around 918 ?C. At 918 ?C, which is
called the transition temperature, is the turning point of expansion to contraction. It
is more noticeable in elements 1 and 24, where at 918 ?C the expansion stopped and
contraction started. In 625 and 648, the contraction started even before the transition
point. However, after the transition point, it was noted that the expansion was predom-
inant in the four elements. The expansion increases dramatically after the transition
temperature until 1200 ?C. This increase is due to the increase in sintering stress, as
shown in figure 9.16. After 1200 ?C, the sintering stress starts to decrease because the
activation energy for grain growth shifts to a lower level and the grain growth rate starts
to increase.

Figure 9.15 shows the predicted relative density change during sintering. It is con-
cluded that relative density did not change in the initial heating ramp and in the final
cooling ramp. These are zones dominated by thermal expansion/contraction. The rel-

ative density started to increase when the swelling strain started to be relevant in the
sintering cycle. The relative density increased when the transition temperature was
reached in the heating ramp final phase, it still increased during the holding time, and
when the cooling ramp started the relative density started to smoothly keeping constant,
and after the transition temperature at the cooling ramp it simply did not increase any-
more. The final relative density reached around 0.8. The element 648 is where the final
density reached the highest value, around 0.84.

Looking into figure 9.16, it is shown that sintering stress had the same behaviour
independently of the element. The element 648 is the only which has taken higher values.
The sintering stress only affect the sintering process when the transition temperature
is reached. After 918 ?C and until 1200 ?C the sintering stress increases. The sintering
stress increases due to the grain size maintaining constant in this interval. At 1200 ?C,
the sintering stress starts decreasing dramatically because the grains start to grow. From
the material model implemented, it is known that the sintering stress is proportional to
the reciprocal grain size. In the cooling ramp, the sintering stress is only affected by
the relative density slowly increasing until the temperature drops down to the transition
temperature and sintering stress stops influencing the sintering stage.

In figure 9.17, it is demonstrated how the von Mises stress behaves along the sin-
tering stage. At the beginning of the sintering cycle, the von Mises stress assumes the
values from the residual stress of the compaction stage. The von Mises stress reaches a
maximum value at the beginning and starts smoothly decreasing while the temperature
starts increasing. At this point the sintering stage is dominated by the thermal expan-
sion. Closer to the transition temperature, the sintering stress starts to dominate the
stresses in the sintering stage, and the von Mises stresses dramatically decrease. After
the transition temperature and during the holding time and the cooling ramp where the
sintering stresses dominate, the von Mises stresses assume values near 0. In the end of
the sintering cycle, the sintering stress desappears and residual values for the von Mises
stress appear. At the end, the von Mises stresses assumes a very low value.

9.4 Sensitivity Analysis

In this section, it is reproduced a sensitivity analysis, which objective is to study the
mesh influence in the obtained results. Therefore, it was a study in the compaction and
sintering stages was made where, at each process, three different meshes were applied:
a coarse mesh; an intermediate mesh and a refined mesh. A coarse mesh with 132
elements; the intermediate mesh from the mesh used in the case study was adopted
and it was described in subsection 8.2.1. The intermediate mesh is defined with 648
elements. Finally, a refined mesh with 957 elements was applied. The elements’ difference
between the intermediate and refined meshes is not so accented as between the coarse
and intermediate meshes. Therefore, the results’ difference between the intermediate and
refined meshes may not be so significant. For the coarse mesh, the elements analysed
is represented in figure 9.9 (a). The intermediate mesh, like said before, was adopted
from the case study, therefore, the elements analysed are represented in figure 9.1 from
section 9.2. Finally, in the refined mesh, the analysed element are represented in figure
9.18 (b). Firstly, the mesh influence in the compaction stage is analysed, after the same
analysis is done but for the sintering stage.

9.4.1 Compaction Sensitivity Analysis

In this sensitivity analysis some parameters that were analysed in the compaction stage
are presented (section 9.2) but now influenced by different meshes. Therefore, a study
was made, where four groups of elements were analysed: element 1; elements 11, 24 and
29; elements 122, 625 and 929; elements 132, 648 and 957 from figures 9.18 (a); 9.4 and
9.18 (b), respectively. This elements are analysed in the study of the mesh influence
relatively to the punch force for compacting the loose powder, the von Mises stress and
axial stress in function of relative density. Firstly, a study is presented about the force
necessary to compress the loose powder for half of initial height, like was presented in
figure 8.5. In the punch force study, it was analysed how the reaction force behaved in
each node of the upper edge. The analysis is presented in figure 9.19.

Following, the behaviour of the von Mises stress along the relative time is presented
in figures 9.20 and 9.21. Figure 9.20 presents the two upper edge elements from figure
9.18, and figure 9.21 presents the study of the two bottom elements, also from figure
9.18. This architecture of results’ presentation is maintained for the study of the next
parameters that are presented in this section. The number of graphics presented in this
chapter is very exhaustive due to a coherency question of maintaining the decision of
analysing the four critical elements like was made in sections 9.2 and 9.3. Therefore,
in each parameter analysed, there are four graphics corresponding to each of the four
elements for the three different meshes.

In figures 9.22 and 9.23, the evolution of the axial stress in function of the relative
density is presented. Figure 9.22 presents the two elements of the upper edge and figure
9.23 presents the two elements of the bottom edge.

the problem, the upper punch, which is responsible to compress the loose powder, was
substituted for a displacement condition in the upper surface of the specimen in the finite
element program. Therefore, it explains the fact that when a displacement of 9 mm is
reached, an abrupt decrease from a maximum force to 0 happens because when it reaches
9 mm the displacement conduction is inactivated. However, analysing figure 9.19 it is
possible to conclude that the force necessary for pressing the powder increases along the
displacement, and the maximum force is reached at 9 mm, when the compaction ends.
This is the general punch force behaviour independently of the mesh type.

Relatively to the mesh influence, it is noticed that with a refined mesh the maximum
force necessary to compact the disk to half of the initial heigh is approximately 4.5 kN,
or, in other terms, it is necessary approximately 450 kgf to compress the loose powder.
In the intermediate mesh, the maximum force increases to approximately 5.5 kN, which
is approximately 550 kgf. The major difference is in the coarse mesh, with few elements,
a punch force much higher than in the intermediate and refined meshes is recorder. In
the coarse mesh it is registered around 11 kN for compacting the powder, so, it takes
about 1.1 ton to compress the powder. For this analysis, it is concluded that when
the mesh is more refined, more accurate is the value relatively to the force imposed for
compacting the powder. Therefore, for the mesh with most accuracy, the lowest is the
force needed for compacting the loose powder.

Focus now in the von Mises stress along the compaction process evolution. The
curves’ behaviour, in figures 9.20 and 9.21, was already discussed in section 9.2. Here,
the objective is to understand if the mesh types have different behaviours. As can be
seen in figure 9.20 (a) for the element 1, it is evident that the three different meshes: the
coarse mesh; the intermediate mesh and the refined mesh; do not have a big difference
between them. The three curves have the same behaviour along the compaction process,
and this conclusion is a constant for figures 9.20 (a) and (b) and 9.21 (a) and (b). In the
element 1 (figure 9.20 (a)) the intermediate and refined meshes reach the von Mises stress
maximum at around the same value, 109 MPa for the intermediate mesh, and 110 MPa
for the refined mesh. The coarse mesh takes a lower value, around 106 MPa. It is noticed
that the intermediate and refined meshes assumes higher values relatively to the coarse
mesh at the relative time from 2 to 3. In the elements 11, 24 and 29 (figure 9.20 (b)) the
three different meshes had the same behaviour, they reached their maximum at around
97 MPa. During the relative time from 1 to 2, there are some differences but they are
insignificant, because it is during the compression process period. In the elements 122,
625 and 929 (figure 9.21 (a)) it is possible to see that the coarse mesh assumes higher
values relatively to the intermediate and refined meshes. Along the compaction process,
the coarse mesh has a von Mises maximum of 91 MPa higher than the intermediate
and refined meshes, which have 88 MPa. In the ejection period from 2 to 3 the coarse
mesh still takes higher values relatively to the intermediate and refined meshes. For the
elements 132, 648 and 957, the same behaviour as in figure 9.20 (b) can be seen. There is
no significant difference between the three meshes. All the three meshes assume the von
Mises maximum at 100 MPa and the ejection step from 2 to 3 has the same behaviour.
In conclusion, it is interesting that the elements analysed close to the symmetric line
have the same behaviour, in other words, do not have any change with the different
meshes. On the other hand, the elements close to the die surface are where the refined
or coarse meshes have a detached behaviour in relation to the other mesh. The von
Mises stress is higher in the element 1 and elements 132, 648 and 957, and the von Mises

stress is lower at elements 11, 24 and 29, and elements 122, 625 and 929.

Another study made for verifying the mesh sensitivity at the compaction stage was
the relation between the increasing axial stress versus the relative density. Figure 9.22
shows the two elements’ behaviour in the upper surface and in figure 9.23 the two
elements’ behaviour in the bottom surface is shown. In the study of element 1, (figure
9.22 (a)) it is shown that the three different meshes have a similar behaviour. In the
loading phase, the axial stress increases as well as the relative density. In the unloading
phase, the displacement of the upper punch was deactivated and the axial stress started
to decrease down to a residual value. The coarse mesh had its axial stress maximum at
172 MPa for a relative density of 0.634. The intermediate and the refined meshes have
their maximum axial stress value at 175 MPa for a relative density of 0.636. Therefore,
the mesh influence is not significant for this type of study. It is concluded that in
the element 1, the coarse mesh registered the lowest value but it was very close to the
values registered in the intermediate and refined meshes. The elements 11, 24 and 29
(figure 9.22 (b)) have the same behaviour of the figure 9.22 (a) therefore, the conclusion
presented previously is maintained for this study of mesh influence. In the elements
122, 625 and 929 (figure 9.23 (a)) it is shown that the axial stress assumes lower values
than in figure 9.23. However, it is perfectly normal due to being analysed the elements
are the ones in the bottom of the sample. It is noticed that the coarse mesh assumes
higher values in the loading phase but it is the refined mesh that has the lowest relative
density value in the end. The coarse mesh has an axial stress maximum of 153 MPa
for a relative density of 0.620. The intermediate mesh has an axial stress maximum of
150 MPa for a relative density of 0.620 and the refined mesh has an axial stress maximum
of 148 MPa for a relative density of 0.617. Once again, there are some differences but
nothing very significant. The three different meshes still have a similar behaviour, and
in figure 9.23 (a) it is the refined mesh that assumes the lowest value for the axial stress
and corresponding relative density. In the elements 132, 648 and 957 the behaviour is
as shown in figure 9.22 (a). During the loading, the coarse mesh presents the highest
values. For the coarse mesh, it presents the axial stress maximum at 163 MPa for a
relative density of 0.626. The intermediate mesh and the refined mesh also present the
axial stress maximum at 163 MPa but for the intermediate mesh the relative density is
around 0.631 and in the refined mesh it is around 0.626. Thus, the discrepancy, here, is
in the intermediate mesh that assumes the same value of axial stress maximum but for
a relatively high density in relation to the coarse and refined meshes.

In the compaction stage were these parameters presented previously, for studying the
influence of mesh type in the behaviour of von Mises stress, the axial stress with relative
density and the punch force. It was verified that in the punch force the difference in
mesh type influences the values. However, in the von Mises stress and in the axial stress
versus relative density the difference was minimum.

9.4.2 Sintering Sensitivity Analysis

In this subsection it is presented the relevant parameters in the sintering stage for a
sensitivity analysis relatively to the mesh type. All the assumptions presented in sections
9.4 and 9.4.1, and the form in which the results are presented remains the same in this
subsection.

Firstly, it is presented the axial shrinkage evolution along the time. Here, like was

made in the case study, the results are presented always in relation to the sintering
cycle. In figure 9.24 (a) and (b) the axial shrinkage evolution for the two elements of
the upper surface is shown. On the other hand in figure 9.25 (a) and (b), the axial
shrinkage evolution for the two elements of the bottom surface is shown. Another study
is performed to understand the relative density along the sintering cycle with different
meshes and it is shown in figure 9.26 (a) and (b) and figure 9.27 (a) and (b). Finally, in
this sensitivity study, an analysis with the three different meshes on the sintering stress
is made. The results with different mesh types are presented in figure 9.28 and in figure
9.29.

The description of the typical axial shrinkage curve behaviour was made in section
9.3, therefore it is not the main objective to explain the curve behaviour but rather
explain whether the meshes have a major or a minor influence in the axial shrinkage.
Starting by analysing the figure 9.24 (a), where it is shown that the three meshes curves
demonstrated an initial expansion in the compact until the transition temperature was
reached. After that, the three curves start the contraction behaviour, and at the end of
the sintering cycle the coarse mesh has the highest axial shrinkage value corresponding to
8.49%. The intermediate mesh reaches an axial shrinkage value of 8.38% and the refined
mesh has an axial shrinkage of 8.19%. Thus, the axial shrinkage, for a coarse mesh,
takes a higher value than for a refined mesh. The difference is not very large but in the
element 1, the refined mesh gives the lowest axial shrinkage value which should be more
properly. In elements 11; 24 and 29, the three different meshes have the same behaviour
as in figure 9.24 (a). Starting with an expansion until the transition temperature and
beginning the contraction after the transition temperature. In figure 9.24 (b), the refined
mesh assumes an axial shrinkage value around 7.0%. The intermediate mesh registers
the lowest axial shrinkage value, 5.91%, and the coarse mesh assumes a value between
the refined and intermediate meshes, 6.84%. In elements 11; 24 and 29, the idea of
the coarse mesh gives the lower accurately value and the refined mesh gives the most
accurately value did not confirm. In elements 122; 625 and 929 from figure 9.25 (a) it
is shown that the intermediate mesh assumes the highest axial shrinkage value. In fact,
the axial shrinkage behaviour, in the intermediate mesh, starts with an expansion even
before the transition temperature. At the end of the sintering cycle, the intermediate
mesh assumes an axial shrinkage value around 9.9% while the coarse and refined meshes
assume 8.06% and 8.35%, respectively. In the elements 132; 648 and 957, for the three
different meshes, the specimen starts to expand and after starts to contract before the
transition temperature. The three mesh types start the contraction before the transition
temperature. The contraction starts to increase and the intermediate mesh registers the
highest value at around 14.77%. The refined and the coarse meshes register the values
of 13.6% and 12.5%, respectively.

Following, the relative density evolution along the sintering cycle is studied. It is
concluded that independently of the element number in the analysis, the behaviour of
the different types of meshes is very similar, more in figure 9.26 (a) and (b) than in
figure 9.27 (a) and (b). In figure 9.27 (a) and (b) it is noticed that the intermediate
mesh behaves with higher density along the sintering cycle than the coarse and refined
meshes. The intermediate mesh reaches a relative density around 0.806 and 0.824 for
figure 9.27 (a) and (b) respectively. The coarse and the refined mesh reaches 0.789 and
0.788 and 0.806 and 0.808 also for figure 9.27 (a) and (b), respectively.

Analysing the figure 9.28 (a) and (b) and figure 9.29 (a) and (b), it is concluded,

independently the mesh type, than the sintering stress did not present considerable
variation. Observing figure 9.28 (a), there is not any difference testing with a coarse,
intermediate or refined mesh. For the three meshes, the sintering stress (?s) starts after
the transition temperature with a stress around 0.64 MPa and reaches its maximum
at 1.1 MPa. After that, with the grain growth increasing, the sintering stress (?s)
starts decreasing, reaching its minimum at 0.15 MPa. In figure 9.28 (b), the sintering
stress behaviour, in the elements 11, 24 and 29, has a similar behaviour to figure 9.28
(a). All the three different mesh types have an identical behaviour. Three mesh types,
the sintering stress starts at the transition temperature with 0.41 MPa. At 1200 ?C,
where the sintering stress reaches its highest value, the coarse and refined meshes reach
1.09 MPa, while the intermediate mesh reaches 1.11 MPa. This can be perceived in
figure 9.28 (b), where the intermediate mesh reaches an higher value than the coarse and
intermediate meshes. At the end of sintering cycle, the three meshes register the lowest
sintering stress at around 0.15 MPa. Analysing figure 9.29 (a), the intermediate mesh
starts with a sintering stress around 0.41 MPa, while the coarse and the refined meshes
starts with a sintering stress of around 0.4 MPa. The sintering stress maximum value
for the intermediate mesh is around 1.11 MPa, while the coarse and intermediate meshes
reach 1.07 MPa. At the transition temperature, in the cooling ramp, the intermediate
mesh ends with a sintering stress around 0.15 MPa and the coarse and refined meshes
end with a sintering stress around 0.14 MPa. In figure 9.29 (b), it is noticed that the
sintering stress curve for the three different mesh types has the same behaviour of figure
9.29 (a). For the elements 132, 648 and 957, the intermediate mesh presents the highest
values. The difference in the values between the intermediate, coarse and refined mesh is
very low. For example, the intermediate mesh begins the sintering stress with a value of
approximately 0.86 MPa instead of 0.84 MPa which is verified for the coarse and refined
meshes. At the maximum value of sintering stress, the intermediate mesh assumes a value
around 1.16 MPa and the coarse and refined meshes assume values around 1.11 MPa.
At sintering stress end the intermediate mesh registers a value around 0.16 MPa instead
the 0.15 MPa which is verified for the coarse and intermediate meshes.

Conclusions and Future Works

10.1 Conclusions

In this section, a reflection about the developed work in this document is done and after
that, the major conclusions retained are revealed.

A powder metallurgy industrial process adapted to a finite element program was
modelled. Not all the steps of the powder metallurgy process were addressed. The
concern was in studying the two major steps in powder metallurgy: the compaction
process and the sintering process.

A study about soils criteria was developed to simulate the compaction process. With
appropriate material parameters and an appropriate soil model applied (in this case
the Modified Drucker-Prager/cap model), it was possible to reproduce the compaction
process in FEM with good accuracy. In the end of this stage, the reference parameter
to control was the relative density, however the von Mises stress behaviour along the
compaction process was also studied. The relative density had an expected behaviour,
because the plastic volumetric strain had a deformation around 50%, therefore the rela-
tive density had to increase 100% in order to its initial value, and this is what actually
happened. Analysing the residual stress, expected values were obtained, this is, it is a
relatively low stress value along the specimen.

In the sintering process, it was necessary to implement a viscoelasticity model. The
viscoelasticity model was implemented based on the Maxwell model, considering ther-
mal deformation. This same model accounts for grain growth. Thus, the viscoelasticity
was implemented in a finite element code in association with grain growth model, being
possible to predict the shrinkage in the sintering process. In this sintering process there
was a connection with inhomogeneous factors such as initial density distribution and the
residual stress resulting from die compaction. The viscoelasticity model was successfully
implemented in an user’s subroutine, CREEP, after some validation tests. This subrou-
tine has shown good behaviour when applied in the case study. The main parameters
like sintering stress, viscosity, porosity work successfully between them.

Subsequentely, a sensitivity study about the different mesh types was carried out. In
the compaction stage, it was noticed that the influence of the refinement of the meshes
was not relevant, except for the punch force, where the difference was notorious. In the
sintering stage, the axial shrinkage is the parameter in which the discrepancy between
meshes is more accentuated. All the other parameters that were important to study in
sintering, it was concluded that there was not significant variance with the refinement

of mesh.

10.2 Future Works

The main objectives that were proposed for this research were reached. The two major
phases that describe the PM industry process were both implemented, i.e., the Drucker-
Prager soil criteria and the viscoelasticity model were successfully implemented in a
finite element program.

However this was an introductory study in the powder metallurgy processes, there-
fore, it is necessary to continue the work in this area. Some suggestions that is registered
are:

? Testing the developed model but for other types of geometry and testing in a
geometry which is not axisymmetric;

? Adapting this model for other types of materials, like an alumina powder, which
is a very common material in powder metallurgy;

? Testing the compaction model using another soil criteria that many researchers
use in the powder area, the Cam-Clay model;

? Apply the porous elastic model instead of the linear elastic model;

? Implement an UMAT subroutine instead of the CREEP subroutine for a stainless
steel and compare the results between an UMAT and a CREEP subroutine.
