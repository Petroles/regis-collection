Stress can be defined as a condition in which the dynamic equilibrium of the body is disturbed 

and several studies have demonstrated the action of some corticosteroids modulating stress 

situations, such as reproduction. However, the role of corticosteroids in fish reproduction can 

be either positive or deleterious, depending on many variables. In the Astyanax genus, the 

same stress stimulus can successfully induce the reproduction in Astyanax altiparanae, but 

not in other species of the same genus. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze cortisol 

and progestogens plasma levels and receptor gene expression in the ovaries of A. altiparanae, 

a teleost species that successfully reproduce using crowding and water level drawdown as 

stimulus. Three experimental groups were considered: Stress (high stocking density and water 

level drawdown); human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, a positive control); and Saline (a 

control group). Females were sampled at three different moments of the artificial reproduction 

experiment, initial, intermediary and at spawning. Indices of spawning performance as, 

fertilization rate, Gonadosomatic Index (GSI), as well as histological analysis of the ovaries 

were carried out. 17?-hydroxiprogesterone (17 OHP) and cortisol (CORT) levels were 

measured in plasma by ELISA. Additionally, the ovarian gene expression of CORT and 17 

OHP receptors (CR and PR) were carried out by Real-time quantitative PCR. Females from 

Stress and hCG groups released a larger volume of eggs when compared with females from 

the Saline (Control) group. Females from Stress group presented a decrease in GSI and 

ovaries mass at spawning, and many post ovulatory follicles (POFs) were present in the 

ovaries after spawning. At the intermediary sampling, plasma levels of CORT increased in 

females from the Stress group, but not in the hCG and Saline groups. 17 OHP levels did not 

change during the experiment. PR gene was more expressed in females from hCG group 

throughout the experiment, but CR gene expression did not change. We suggest a possible

role of CORT as an inducing agent in ovulation and/or spawning of A. altiparanae. CR and 

PR did not seem to be the candidates for triggering ovulation, so the relationship between the 

derivative of progesterone (17,20DHP) should be deeper studied, as well as the role of CORT 

and different progestagens in A. altiparanae reproduction. 

Resumo 

O estresse pode ser definido como uma condição na qual o equilíbrio dinâmico do corpo é 

perturbado e muitos estudos têm demonstrado a ação de alguns corticosteroides modulando 

situações de stress, tal como a reprodução. No entanto, o papel dos corticosteroides na 

reprodução de peixes pode ser positivo ou deletério, dependendo de muitas variáveis. No 

gênero Astyanax, o mesmo estímulo de estresse pode induzir com sucesso a reprodução em 

A.altiparanae, mas não em outras espécies do mesmo gênero. Portanto, o objetivo deste 

estudo foi analisar os níveis de cortisol e progestágenos no plasma e a expressão dos 

receptoresdestes esteroides nos ovários de A. altiparanae, espécie de teleósteo que consegue 

se reproduzir com sucesso usando o aumento da densidade e variação no nível da água como 

um estímulo. Três grupos experimentais foram considerados: Estresse (alta densidade de 

estocagem e intenso fluxo de água); Gonadotropina Coriônica Humana (hCG, um controle 

positivo); e Salina (grupo controle). As fêmeas foram amostradas em três diferentes 

momentos do experimento de reprodução artificial, inicial, intermediário e na desova. Índices 

de desempenho de desova como, taxa de fertilização, Índice Gonadossomático (IGS), bem 

como a análise histológica dos ovários foram considerados. Os níveis de 17?-

hydroxiprogesterone (17OHP) e cortisol (CORT) foram medidos em amostras de plasma por 

ELISA. Além disso, a expressão de genes de receptores de CORT (CR) e 17 OHP (PR) foram 

analisadas nos ovários por qPCR. Fêmeas dos grupos Estresse e hCGdesovaram um volume 

maior de ovos quando comparadasàs fêmeas do grupo Salina (controle). As fêmeas do grupo 

Estresse apresentaram também uma redução nos valores doIGS e na massa dos ovários no 

momento da desova, e muitos folículos pós - ovulatórios estavam presentes nos ovários após a 

desova. Na amostragem do período intermediário, os níveis plasmáticos de CORT 

aumentaram nas fêmeas do grupo de Estresse, mas não nos grupos de hCG e Salina. A 

concentração de 17OHP não se alterou durante o experimento ou entre os grupos. O PR foi 

mais expresso em fêmeas do grupo hCG ao longo do experimento, e a expressão do CR não 



13 

 

se alterou. Sugerimos um possível papel de CORT como um agente indutor na ovulação e / ou 

de desova de A. altiparanae .No entanto, CR e PR não parecem ser os candidatos para 

desencadear a ovulação, de modo que a relação entre receptores derivadosPR (17,20DHP) 

devem ser mais profundamente estudados, bem como a efetiva ação de CORT e diferentes 

progestágenos na reprodução de A. altiparanae.

Introduction 

 

Reproduction and environmental modulation  

Reproduction in fish is neuro-modulated by external factors such as photoperiod 

and temperature. Once the animal has reached the minimum biological conditions to start 

it, the external stimuli are received by receptor organs, converted into electrochemical 

signals, and then, they stimulate the synthesis and release of many hormones, including the 

gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), the key neurohormone controlling the 

Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Gonads (HPG) axis in fish, which stimulates the pituitary 

gonadotropic cells to initiate the synthesis and release of FSH (follicle-stimulating 

hormone) initiating the process that leads the conversion of cholesterol to testosterone 

(Millaet al., 2009). This process, modulated mainly by GnRH is also mediated by 

kisspeptin (KiSS), the product of the gene Kiss1, also a key hormone in the regulation of 

reproductive functions in fish (Zohar et al., 2010). 

When environmental conditions and the combined hormonal stimuli lead the 

reproductive cycle without inhibitory effects, testosterone is transported to the granular 

cells, and aromatized to 17?-estradiol (E2), which acts in the hepatocytes, stimulating the 

synthesis of vitellogenin, a phospholipoglycoproteins, which via the bloodstream, is 

captured by the oocytes via micropinocitosis, thus promoting growth of the oocyte and the 

incorporation of the yolk. In response to a sharp production of E2, there is a negative 

feedback to FSH and together with the action of GnRH stimulates the secretion of LH, 

which, once bounded to its receptors in the granulosa cells, initiating the process of final 

maturation and ovulation (Lubzenset al., 2010). 

This whole cycle can be regarded as a very sensitive stage to environmental stimuli 

and may even present differences according to the stress levels of individuals that have 

undergone variants, such as reproductive migration in some species, temperature, 

photoperiod or rainfall that can reduce circulating levels of sex steroid hormones. The 

stimuli capable of generating high levels of stress can also produce different responses in 

different stages of maturation, affecting the quality of gametes and influencing the 

offspring (Weedelar-Bonga, 1997; Lubzenset al., 2010 ).

Stress and reproduction 

According to Wendeelar-Bonga (1997), “stress can be defined as a condition in 

which the dynamic equilibrium of the body, or homeostasis, is threatened or disturbed due 

to the stressors called stimulus action”. The action of stressors is dual: they can produce 

effects that threat or disrupt the homeostatic balance, as may, however, cause a number of 

behavioral and physiological responses as compensatory and / or adaptive action, enabling 

the animal to overcome the threats. 

If an animal is subjected to an intense and constant stress, the physiological 

response may lose its adaptive value, causing permanent damage to their health and well-

being (Carmichael, 1984). The central adaptation to stress is the relocation of substrates for 

activities that require enhancement to restore homeostasis, such as respiration, locomotion, 

hidromineral balance and tissue repair, instead of high energy demand activities such as 

growth and reproduction (Mommsen et al., 1999). Such dynamics can significantly reduce 

animal performance, both during forward recovery phase to an acute stress and in chronic 

stress (Mommsen et al., 1999). Faced with such situation, an animal can quit a 

programmed step, such as reproduction, leading to immediate survival. This situation is 

often seen in fish farms where the maintenance of animals in captivity, management, 

among other routine activities may interfere with the reproductive performance of many 

species. As an example, the case of Anguilla anguilla, whose oocyte development is 

prevented in captivity (Milla et al., 2009). 

The modulation of stress reactions is directly related to the action of corticosteroid 

hormones, and several studies have shown a possible duality of functions. Stressful 

situations can inhibit the reproductive performance of fish (Small, 2004; Millaetal., 2009) 

causing adverse effects in this process, due to the action on the HHG axis; for example, the 

effects of cortisol, the main corticosteroid in teleosts, in the production of gonadotropins 

and vitellogenesis (Small, 2004; Millaet al., 2009). When exposed to severe stressful 

situations or long term, fish have disrupted their reproductive processes due to decreased 

pituitary activity, especially in relation to the synthesis and release of FSH and LH 

(Carragheretal., 1989; Norris and Hobbs, 2006), and consequently to a decreased synthesis 



17 

 

of sex steroid hormones. This reduction in the concentration of steroids may occur due to 

the competition for common substrate (cholesterol) of sex steroids and corticosteroids (Fig. 

1) (Pickering et al., 1987; Milla etal., 2009), and may also result in reducing the size of 

eggs and quality of larvae (Campbell et al., 1994 Mylonasetal., 2010). In this sense, 

hormonal interference is needed to provide the final maturation and ovulation in teleosts, a 

routine practice in fish farming (Zohar and Mylonas, 2001). 

 

 

Figure 1: Synopses of the probable pathways of corticosteroid biosynthesis in female teleost. Solid black 

arrows show that the enzyme catalyzing the steroid metabolism is active in the gonad; the grey arrows 

indicate that the enzyme required for that step is expressed in the gonad but its activity needs to be 

confirmed. Unfilled arrow indicates lack of clear information. (Adapted by Millaet al., 2009). 

 

Conversely, in cases such as eel (Anguilla anguilla) and rainbow trout 

(Oncorhynchusmykiss), glucocorticoids, hormones commonly associated with stress, were 

used to induce a LH peak in the early sexual maturation (Millaetal., 2009). In vitro studies 

have shown the ability of corticosteroids to induce oocyte maturation in freshwater species 

such as catfish Heteropneustesfossilis, supporting the idea that corticosteroids can have 

direct and / or indirect action to stimulate the final maturation (Rahman etal., 2001). 

 



18 

 

The role of steroid hormones in fish farming  

The attempt to make fish farming a more profitable activity and the need to 

understand the mechanisms behind reproductive impairment in cultivated species triggered 

many studies trying to measure the influence of stress in the final stages of reproduction in 

teleost species in which disruptions in captive breeding have been reported (Millaetal., 

2009). Additionally, when in captive conditions (in fish farms), the natural challenges for 

fish are mainly related with the management imposed by the activity, such as the 

maintenance and transportation of breeding/juveniles, prophylactic and/or effective 

treatments, high densities of storage, among others. The sum of the physiological changes 

triggered by chemical, physical and/or biological challenges, are commonly referred to as 

stress responses (Wedemeyeret al., 1990). In this context, the literature has shown that 

within fish farms, stressful situations, even though routine, such as the handling of animals, 

can directly affect reproductive performance, the quality of spawning or even development 

of the progeny (Campbell et al., 1994). 

Diadromous fish species need to migrate in order to find a satisfactory 

environment to spawn. But, restricted in tanks, they need to be manipulated and in some 

cases, hormonal manipulations are necessary to trigger the final steps of the reproductive 

cycle. The investigations of these fish species are based mainly on the studies of the 

plasma profile of sex steroids, an information that according to some authors, could 

indicate a failure in the final maturation and consequently a dysfunction in the production 

of progestogens (Zohar and Mylonas, 2001; Baldisserotto and Gomes, 2005; Mylonasetal., 

2010). In this sense, hormonal therapies are required to provide the final maturation and 

ovulation in Neotropical migratory species. Thus, several recent studies have attempted to 

measure the influence of captivity during the reproductive cycle in Neotropical fish species 

with blocked reproduction in captivity, mainly the potamodromous species, as 

Prochiloduslineatus (Hainfellneret al., 2012; Souza et al., 2014), Salminushilarii (Honjiet 

al., 2011, 2013; Moreira et al., 2015), Steindachneridionparahybae(Honjiet al., 2013, 

2015) and Piaractusmesopotamicus (Kuradomiet al., 2015) among others. 

 

Corticosteroids receptors and reproduction 



19 

 

In some fish species, as eel and brown trout, glucocorticoids were used to induce 

LH synthesis at first sexual maturation, supporting the idea that corticosteroids may exert 

direct and/or indirect action in stimulating the final maturation (Millaet al., 2009). This 

feature is based on recent studies that point to a possible promiscuous action between 

progestagen and glucocorticoid receptors (EickandThornton, 2011), which could establish 

a link between understanding the mechanism of hormone action in ovulation and spawning 

of fish species in captivity, diminishing the use of synthetic hormones. Therefore, studies 

with species in which reproductive response to stress conditions are positive become 

interesting for understanding the mechanisms of adjusts of this animal, as well as the route 

of stimulation of ovulation by means of corticosteroids. Based on this context, there is a 

native potamodromous fish species A. altiparanaethat is a good model for these studies, 

because crowding and/or water level drawdown stimulates ovulation and/or spawning in 

this species (Chehadeet al., 2015), making possible the understanding of the relation 

between corticosteroids and reproduction in captivity teleost species, since studies with 

neotropical species are still scarce. 

 

Experimental species 

The yellow tail "lambari", Astyanax altiparanae (Britski, 1964) Characiformes, 

Characidae family, is considered one of the most important fish species in the food chain 

of the rivers of South America, where it plays a secondary role in relation to those 

identified as noble species (for example: Pseudoplatystomacorruscans, 

Pseudoplatystomafasciatus, Salminusbrasiliensis, Bryconamazonicus, Brycon insignis, 

among others) (Baldisserotto and Gomes, 2005). This species belongs to a large group of 

migratory species, which represents the largest number of fish species in Brazil (Britski, 

1972). The genus Astyanax can be considered the most representative of the 

Tetragonopterinae subfamily, being dominant in South America, with approximately a 

hundred species (Garutti and Britski, 2000). 

This genus, in general, is composed by reophilic species that are small and 

characterized by having small oocytes, high relative fecundity, rapid development, external 

fertilization and no parental care (Suzuki et al., 2005). A. altiparanae is known by the high 

biological plasticity, and is becoming a potential fish model for scientific studies about 



20 

 

reproduction and stress modulation, since it presents satisfactory results for reproduction in 

conditions considered stressful for other species within the same genus. A. 

altiparanaefemales can be induced to ovulation by water level drawdown and 

consequently increasing stocking density (Chehadeet al., 2015). Considering that cortisol 

levels increase at stressing situations and the known fact of receptor promiscuity between 

corticosteroids and progestogens, we hypothesize that this ovulation/spawning protocol can 

be considered a stressor in A. altiparanae females, triggering cortisol release and that, this 

corticosteroid can act as the Maturation Induction Steroid (MIS) in A. altiparanae, binding 

to progesterone receptors (PR). 



21 

 

Objectives 

 

The main objective of this study is to gain some expertise on the main 

physiological steps involved in A. altiparanae reproduction, in which a supposed stress 

situation triggers ovulation and spawning. This information is important in the fields of 

reproductive physiology, genetics and endocrinology of reproduction, which are important 

areas of fish breeding technology that still needs to be developed in Brazil. 

 

2.1 Specific objectives: 

• Evaluate the reproductive performance of A. altiparanae, using different 

artificial reproduction protocols, including crowding as the ovulation inducer; 

• Evaluate the role of corticosteroids and progestogens during the artificial 

reproduction of A. altiparanae; 

• Evaluate the role of corticosteroid and progestogens receptors in triggering 

ovulation and spawning in A. altiparanae.

MATERIAL AND METHODOS 

 

Experimental procedure for captive breeding of Astyanax altiparanae 

 

The experimental design was carried out at the Fish Farm of the Electric Company of 

São Paulo - CESP, Paraibuna (São Paulo, Brazil) (Fig.2). In December and January 2013 we 

sampled adult males and females (Fig.3) of A. altiparanae, born, raised and collected in tanks 

in the Hydrobiology and Aquaculture Unit of CESP. Broodstocks were kept in 4 tanks 

(200m2), fed with commercial diet with 15% of crude protein, distributed in the amount of 

1.5% of the total biomass per day, divided in two daily treatments (morning and afternoon), 3 

times a week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday) throughout the year. During the experiment, 

in January 2013, 225 males and 155 females with total length of 12 to 16 cm and body mass 

of 34 to 45g were selected in nurseries by trawl and transported with buckets and aerators to 

indoor tanks with 0.86m³ located in the laboratory, according to the method described by 

Chehadeet al., (2015) for induced spawning. It should be emphasized here that theprocedures 

to sacrifice performed in this study are according to the protocol 171/2012, the Institute of 

Biosciences of the University of São Paulo Animal Ethics Committee.

The animals were divided into three tanks of 865 L (0.86m³) (75 males and 50 

females/tank) supplied at a flow rate of 10L of water/minute. At the time of distribution of 

animals in experimental tanks, an initial sampling was carried out (time 0h) of 5 females, free 

of any hormonal or manipulative action. The experiment was divided into initial sampling of 

biological material (0h induction time of reproduction), 8h (initial), 12h (intermediate) and 

24h after induction (spawning) calculated based on the previously knowledge of spawning 

timing of the group induced to spawn by water level drawdown (Chehadeet al., 2015). After 

the initial sampling of females, the animals were divided in the tanks and given the following 

treatments: 

-Stress (E): for animals whose spawning was performed only by a high density 

stimulus, coupled with the increased water flow into the tanks being supplied by a 

recirculation of 10 liters per minute, while the water level in the tank was kept low (water 

level drawdown). This group corresponds to the protocol routinely successfully developed at 

CESP; 

-hCG (H): animals with a spawning protocol associated with hormonal stimulation 

with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), without interference from high density as the 

water volume of the tank was not lowered and the water flow was not incremented; 

-Saline (S):the animals underwent the same manipulation of injections, but containing 

physiological saline (0.9% NaCl). 

 

The hCG (Ovidrel©) was administered in females from the H group in the 

concentration of 5UI/g as a single dose in the lower region of the pectoral fin, quickly, not

allowing the animal to remain for a long period out of the water. The application was about 

twelve hours (12h) after the beginning of the experimental group E, due to the faster action of 

this glycoprotein. The saline was applied to the females of S group, in the same region of the 

fin, using the same volume used for hCG (180µL/female). Soon after this procedure, all the 

females were placed in their tanks, together with the males. During the period of twenty four 

hours after the induction, females were collected in each experimental group, respecting the 

proposed periods (initial, intermediate and spawning), to be possible to follow the time of 

ovulation in the females from the different groups. The males did not receive any treatment, 

since they produce sperm in captivity. 

After spawning, the eggs were siphoned from the tank bottom to be quantified and 

transferred to conical incubators (200L), with 1620 liters per hour of water circulation. After 

hatching, the larvae were maintained for a few days in the incubators until they were 

transferred to the outdoor tanks (200 m2). To assess the viability of the eggs in each 

experimental group three aliquots of eggs were collected per group to estimate the percentage 

of fertilized eggs (number of fertilized eggs x 100/ total number of eggs) (Vazzoler, 1996). To 

measure the amount of eggs, they were siphoned, allocated in 1L beakers, allowed to separate 

the water phase, and then, the number of eggs were counted in subsamples and extrapolated 

for the total volume of water. To calculate the efficiency of each treatment, a calculation was 

performed based on the values obtained in the fertilization rate (average weigh between the 

values obtained on the fertilization rate) plus the standard deviation within the group. 

 

Monitoring the physicochemical parameters of water 

To ensure that the water conditions were established during the experiment, pH, 

dissolved oxygen, temperature, total dissolved solids (TDS) were monitored throughout the 

experiment to exclude a possible abiotic interference on the results. Data were collected over 

the 24 hour experiment with a Multiparameter probe (YSI, Pro Plus) and the pH was 

monitored with a pH meter Gehaka. 

 

Sampling 

At the time of each sampling (initial, intermediate and final), the animals were 

anaesthetized with benzocaine (1g benzocaine in ethanol 92%), which solution was then 

diluted with 10L water. After anesthesia, the blood was collected from the caudal vasculature 



25 

 

(Fig. 4) using disposable 1 ml syringes, heparinized (Hepamax©) and centrifuged for five 

minutes at 3000 rpm to separate plasma from the cellular fraction of blood. 

 
Figure 4 - Blood collected from the caudal vasculature of A. altiparanae. 

 

Plasma was aliquoted in eppendorfsand frozen in liquid nitrogen until transportation to 

a -800C freezer. After blood collection, fish were measured, weighed, the ovaries were 

removed (Fig. 5) and weighed to calculate the gonadosomatic index GSI = (total mass of the 

ovaries / total body weight) x 100] (Vazzoler, 1996). 

 

 
Figure 5: Ovaries collected at the beginning and after 24 hour of the experiment. 

 

After this procedure, a sample of the middle third of the ovarian lobes were collected 

and fixed in Bouin's solution to ascertain the presence of postovulatory follicles (POF) and 

other stages of development of gametes. The histological method (i.e., the presence of POF) 



26 

 

was used as a tool to calculate the percentage of the response to ovulation with the different 

induction protocols. A small piece of ovary was also collected and conserved in RNAlater, in 

a ratio of ½ centimeter of animal tissue, dipped in 10 ml RNAlater to be used in the molecular 

analysis. 

 

Hormonal analysis 

The gonadal steroid 17?-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) and cortisol (CORT) were 

measured in A. altiparanaeplasma by the method of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 

(ELISA) using a commercial kit (IBL®). Afterwards, a plasma extraction protocol, separating 

the protein and lipid fractions (to use only the lipid fraction, which contains the steroid 

hormones) was applied. Various dilutions were initially tested to ensure that the values 

obtained for both hormones fit the kit standard curve. To perform the extraction, the samples 

were removed from the -80°C freezer, plasma proteins were precipitated with ethyl ether in 

the ratio 1:3 (plasma: ethyl ether) and centrifuged at 1800 rpm for 9 minutes at 40C. 

Immediately, after being centrifuged, the samples were placed in the -80°C freezer for 7 

minutes to ensure that all the protein was decanted. Finally, the supernatant was transferred to 

another clean tube, dried with nitrogen and kept at 4°C until use. After the tests, a dilution 

factor was established for each hormone, 1: 4 for CORT and 1: 3 for 17 OHP. The steroid 

analysis was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, using plasma samples in 

duplicate. The plates were read in a Spectra Max 250 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices) 

at a wavelength of 450nm. 

 

Histological analyses of ovaries 

We removed the gonads from the fish, fixed them for 20-24 hours in Bouin's solution, 

and dehydrated them with an increasing series of ethanol dilutions. Subsequently, the ovaries 

were transferred to xylene (dimethyl benzene) and infiltrated with Paraplast (View Plast, 

Erviegas Surgical Instruments Ltd.), following the methodology proposed by Behmeret al., 

(1976). Then 5µm sections were performed with a microtome (Leica RM / 2255 equipped 

with support for disposable blades) and mounted on slides with polylysine(Poly Lysine 

Solution INS Sigma Diagnostics, St. Louis MO USA.) diluted at 1: 5 in distilled water, to 

assist the fixing of the cutting blades. Ovaries sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, 

and then again dehydrated and finished with cover slip and Damar gum. We analyzed and 



27 

 

documented the prepared sections in a computerized system for image capturing (transmitted 

light microscope - Leica DM 1000; camera - Leica DFC 295, and image capture program - 

Leica Application Suite Professional, LAS V3.6). 

A pattern was established using four fields of view in each set of four sections per 

slide in a total of five blades per animal for analysis, a total of eighty fields of view per 

animal. The sections were analyzed and documented, using a computerized image capture 

(transmitted light microscope Leica DM 1000, equipped with camera Leica DFC 295, and 

image capture program Leica Application Suite Professional, LAS V3 .6). From the 

distribution and observed cell types, we assembled a table to identify/quantify the maturity 

stage of groups throughout the experiment. This method was performed according to  

Gomeset al., (2014). For each symbol (+) added, giving a greater frequency of a cell type, 

observed within the group, at different times throughout the experiment, as follows: (-) 

absent; (+) present; (++) frequent;(+++) predominantly, to cells observed in the fields 

analyzed in the respective group. The classifications of gamete maturation stages as well as 

the identification of postovulatory follicles were performed according to Grier (2007). 

 

Molecular analysis 

Assuming that there was no previous data about the target genes (Cortisol and 

Progesterone receptors) in A. altiparanae, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for 

amplification of receptors of cortisol (CR) and progesterone (PR) cDNA from A. altiparanae 

was performed using degenerate primers (more details about the techniques on the annex 

section). For this goal, we used the preserved tissue on RNAlater to extract DNA and 

estimated which species could be close enough to start the analysis. The molecular techniques 

described below were initiated at Dr. Carlos Strussmann’s laboratory, at the Department of 

Applied Marine Bioscience, at Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology, Japan 

(FAPESP/BEPE 2013/26563-1). The analysis was carried out using GENETYX©, an analysis 

program responsible for selecting species for alignment, and creation of BLAST (Fig. 6). 

Based on this program, we designed the degenerate primers for the CR based on the 

nucleotide sequences of Salmotrutta (accession number: AY863149), Danio rerio (access 

number: BX276106), Astyanax mexicanus (access number: XM_007247018.1) and 

Dicentrarchuslabrax (accession number: AY619996). 



28 

 

 

Figure 6: GENETYX© choosing the closest sequences for alignment, separating by size and percentage 

match for analyses with Cortisol receptor. 

 

 Considering that the sequence of nitrogenous bases for CR is very conserved among 

species, compatible species were found in the BLAST genetic alignment. The same situation 

was found for Beta-Actin, where Danio rerio and Odonthestesbonariensis (access number: 

EF026002.1 and EF044319.1 respectively) where used to design the primers. Unlike the 

genes mentioned above, the PR was relatively complex, since the number of inserts present in 

the sequence provided sixty four combinations failures before of functional primers for 

receptor I, show magnification in the samples. For PR we used an alignment among Anguilla 

japonica (AB032075), Danio rerio (NM_001166335) and Astyanax mexicanus 

(XM_007231093). Otherwise, for the receptor associated with the MIS (Maturation Inducing 

Steroid), 17?-20? DHP (17?,20?- dihidroxy-4-pregnen-3-one), the alignment showed a 

common profile among the species, to be more conserved than the Receptor I. We used the 

following species: Carassiusglibelio (Access number: AB934933), Danio rerio (Access 

number: FJ409244), Astyanax mexicanus (Access number XM_007231093). After analysis 

with the GENETYX© program, we have chosen the degenerate primer sequence for the PCR, 



29 

 

using the conserved areas of the alignment map to drawn possible consistent sequences for the 

PCR (Fig. 7). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 7: Alignment made by GENETYX© for Astyanax altiparanaeprogesterone receptor. 

 

Using the computer program for alignment and genomic analyses, Genetix©, the best 

regions were chosen and the sequence for the primers was designed. The functional primers is 

described below (Table 1). For CR gene we designed two sequences named DGCRfw1 and 

DGCRfw2, sequences forward and one reverse named DGCRrv1. For PR gene, we designed 

two combinations of forward and reverse primers (Forward/Reverse A and Forward and 

Reverse B) that gave us results. To study the MIS receptor, we designed two forwards and 

one reverse primer named MIH Forward/Reverse A. For Beta-actin gene, used as a reference 

gene, we designed primer sequences of Forward and Reverse named Beta forward/reverse.

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a rapid procedure allowing the in vitro 

amplification of specific fragments of DNA, starting from a minimal amount of target DNA 

or RNA converted to cDNA previously. For the application of the technique, three segments 

of nucleic acids are needed: a double-stranded DNA to serve as template and the construction 

of two oligonucleotides (primers) specific - simple and tape the two complementary DNA 

template to strips - designed so flanking the sequence to be amplified. In addition, DNA 

polymerase is necessary, dNTPs, buffer, and salts (MgCl). The technique consists of 

repetitive cycles; each cycle is divided into the steps shown in Fig. 8 (Ausubelet al., 2003).  

Step 1 (94-96ºC) - Denaturation of DNA at high temperature, due to the disruption of 

hydrogen bonds that bind the two strands.  



31 

 

Step 2 (30-60 ° C) - Annealing of primers at specific positions (this temperature is 

defined in terms of the nucleotidic sequence of primers).  

Step 3 (72-75ºC) - Extension of the sequence to be amplified by the action of DNA 

polymerase.

The agar gel electrophoresis is generally the next step, when the amplification cycle 

ends. Used to visualize the result of the amplification of a specific sequence, is a simple and 

efficient method. The addition of fluorescent dye (ethidium bromide or SYBR®), which 

intercalates between the bases of DNA and the use of ultraviolet radiation allow visualization 

and photography (Souza, 2003). After checking the result, we cut the bands and made 

purification of the genetic material. This technique permitted separation, identification and 

purification of DNA molecules, preparing for cloning and sequence step (details for the 

protocols on annex 1,2 and 3). The molecular cloning is by definition, the diffusion of 

identical DNA molecules and is based on natural propagation or cell genetically identical to 

the original individuals.  



33 

 

The experiment of gene cloning is to introduce the gene into bacterial cells and isolate 

them in colonies (Nascimento et al., 1999). In the first step there was the link between a DNA 

fragments called insert, containing the gene of interest with another DNA molecule, the 

vector. In the second step, the recombinant DNA molecule was transported into a host cell, 

usually a bacterium, where the transformation process takes place. The cell that received the 

recombinant DNA is called transformed cell which undergoes many cycles of division to 

produce multiple copies of the recombinant DNA. The procedure described followed the 

commercial kits for purification, ligation, transformation and cloning adapted by Promega® 

industrial protocol.  

For ligation and after transformation, the manufacturing process consisted in 

introducing an exogenous DNA into host cells can be bacteria, most commonly used bacterial 

cell is Escherichia coli cell (Brown, 2003). For this project, we used the pGEM®-T Easy 

Vector. All vector models for cloning contain three common features: selective brand, origin 

of replication and multiple cloning sites. The selective mark refers to genes that confer 

resistance to antibiotics and provide selection of transformed clones those unprocessed. For 

this selection it was added to the culture medium appropriate antibiotic in concentrations 

which enable to differentiate (sensitive to the antibiotic) non-transformed cell of the 

transformed cell (antibiotic-resistant). 

The procedure for ligation and transformation are briefly described below. Additional 

details are present on the annex pages.

1. We briefly centrifuged the pGEM®-T Easy Vector tubes to collect the 

contents at the bottom of the tubes. 

2. Set up ligation reactions as described below. We vortex the 2X Rapid 

Ligation Buffer vigorously before each use.  

3. The reactions were mixed (Fig. 9) by pipetting. The reactions were 

incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Alternatively, if the maximum number of 

transformants is required, incubate the reactions overnight at 4°C.  

 

Transformation 

We prepared two LB/ampicillin/IPTG/ X-Gal plates to each ligation reaction,plus two 

plates for determining transformation efficiency (pos and background control). The plates was 

equilibrated to room temperature prior to plating. The tubes were centrifuged containing the 

ligation reactions to collect contents at the bottom of the tube. Add 2µ l of each ligation 

reaction to a sterile 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube on ice. We Set up another tube on ice with 

0.1ng uncut plasmid for determination of the transformation efficiency of the competent cells. 

So, we removed the tube(s) of frozen JM109 High Efficiency Competent Cells from -70°C 

storage and placed them in an ice bath until just thawed (about 5 minutes). Mixed the cells by 

gently flicking the tube. Avoid excessive pippeting, as the competent cells are extremely 

fragile. Carefully we transfered 50µ l of cells into each tube prepared  (100µ l cells for 

determination of transformation efficiency). (Avoid excessive pipetting, as the cells are very 

fragile). Gently flicked the tubes to mix and place them on ice for 20 minutes. Heated shock 

the cells for 45-50 seconds in a water bath at exactly 42°C.  Immediately returned the tubes to 

ice for 2 minutes. Incubate for 1.5 hours at 37°C with shaking (~150rpm).

We plated 100µ l of each transformation culture onto duplicate LB /Ampicillin/ 

IPTG/X-Gal plates (if a higher number of colonies is desired, the cells may be pelleted by 

centrifugation at 1.000 x gfor 10 minutes, resuspend in 200µ l SOC  medium, and 100µ l plated 

on each of two plates). The plates were incubated overnight (16-24 hours) at 37°C. Longer 

incubations or storage plates at 4°C (after 37°C overnight incubation) were used to facilitate 

blue color development (Fig. 11). White colonies generally contain inserts; however, inserts 

may also be present in blue colonies. White clones were picked up by sterile tooth-picker into 

universal tube with 5ml LB plus Ampicillin (final concentration 100µ g/ml) media, incubated 

overnight at 37C, 150rpm. Then we seek to 1 ml culture into 1.5ml tube for following PCR 

checking if successful insert and the remains are stored at 4ºC.

After the incubation, we selected the bigger white colonies for each sample and then 

picked up to a new plate, named master plate. The master plate should was incubated for 

16~24hours. Then, the sample was homogenized and after, put on the heat bath at 95°C for 

1~5 minutes. This proceeds made sure that the bacteria cell was broken. Then, we used this 

material to run a PCR for confirmation for all samples you are cultivating (Fig. 12).  

 

 

Figure 12: Results for the PCR to confirm the efficiency of the inserts for CR in Astyanax altiparanae. 

 

After confirming the insertion, the master plate was incubated overnight, and then the 

colonies removed with a tip for 10 ~100 µ l, in a sterile tube with 2~3ml of liquid media. 

Then, the samples were incubated in a heat bath/shaker for 16~24hours at 37°C and 136 rpm. 

After this period, the samples were ready to be purified and sent for sequence in a specialized 

industry. The protocol used for purification is described on the annex (annex 6).  

 

Real-time quantitative PCR 

The real-time quantitative PCR primers for PR and CR receptors genes (forward and 

reverse) were designed using the software Perl Primer v1.1.17. The gene efficiency was 

optimized to be between 95 and 105% using the standard curve with five different dilutions of 

a pool of cDNA samples from all experimental animals. The real time PCR was performed 

using 1X SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 0.2 uM primer (forward and 



37 

 

reverse) and an equivalent of 5 ng cDNA. The reaction was incubated for 2 min at 50 ° C, 10 

min at 95 ° C followed by forty cycles of 15 sec at 95 ° C and 40 s at 60 ° C. At the end of 

these cycles an analysis of the melt curve was carried out to test the specificity of the reaction. 

The reaction was performed in triplicate in a thermocycler ExicyclerTM96 through Exicycler 

Diagnosis3 software. The EF1? gene was used as an endogenous reference gene for analyzing 

the relative expression of target genes. Gene expression was calculated using the Ct value, 

which was normalized by a reference sample (cDNA pool), standardized by EF1?.  

Statistical analyses  

Data of plasma concentration of steroid hormones were expressed as mean ±standard 

error of the mean (SEM). Comparisons of steroid plasma levels and relative gene expression 

of CR and PR among the experimental groups (stress, saline and hCG) in A. altiparanaewere 

performed by analysis of variance (ANOVA One Way) considering the time of the experiment 

(initial, intermediate or spawning). Tukey was used as a post-hoc test. The analyses were 

performed using the Sigma Stat (version 3.5) software.

Results 

 

 
 The experiments carried out  were divided into two parts: 

In the first part, we describe the results obtained on the hormonal profile and histological 

analysis, it showed the efficiency of the induction protocol, considering the results of the 

spawning females in the stress group. For these analyzes, the cortisol assay results showed 

statistical significance, while the histological examination revealed the presence of mature 

cells and then to experiment, the presence of post-ovulatory follicles in two of the three 

groups, confirming the expected in the drawing trial 

 

In the second part of this work, we performed a molecular analysis of CR and PR in cells 

from the ovaries. These results aimed to elucidate the expression of Membrane receptor 

signaling for CR and PR, and Beta-actin in A. altiparanae. 

In conventional PCR, the results were obtained using beta-actin gene as a normalizer. 

However, for the RT PCR analysis, the gene set for use, due to better results in the 

optimization tests, was Ef1a. The results showed statistical difference for the gene expression 

of the related Progestin receptor. 

 

Reproductive performance 

 Regarding the behavior of the animals, there was a period of approximately 24hours 

from the beginning of the experiment, when it was observed the pairing of animals in the 

Stress group, a behavior that was followed by the positive response in all experimental 

groups. Taking into account the results obtained in the morphological analysis and the values 

of GSI, it can be inferred that animals from the Stress group ovulated in the period that 

comprised the second half of the experiment, responding rapidly to stress controlled, which 

may be considered a positive result to the proposed protocol. The values of GSI and gonad 

mass decreased significantly (P&amp;lt;0.001 and P = 0.005, respectively) in the animals from the 

Stress group at the time of spawning. The body mass did not change in any experimental 

group (Table 2). The fertilization rate of the eggs did not vary in females from the different 



39 

 

experimental groups (P = 0.518)and the percentage of responses remained unchanged (P = 

0.346) (Table 3).

Physicochemical parameters of water  

 The statistical test showed differences only for pH values, that was more acidic in the 

water of the Stress group when compared to other groups (P = 0.001). The analysis of water 

quality parameters showed no statistical differences among the three experimental groups for 

TDS (P = 0.398), dissolved oxygen (P = 0.519) and temperature (P = 0.436) values, that were 

not statistically different (ANOVA). 



40 

 

The results can be explained by the different procedures used in each experimental 

group, as the case of reducing the the water pH in the tank of animals from the Stress 

group.Since the density was higher, the production of organic compounds and the consequent 

reduction in pH of the water tank can be supported. 

 

 

Histological analysis 

 From the observation made macroscopically, we found that the animals were sexually 

mature. From the middle third of the ovarian samples it was possible to discern and account 

for the distribution of cell types in the different parts in the ovaries of each individual and thus 

group the cell types by qualitative and subjective method to identify the maturity stage of 

groups throughout the experiment (Fig. 14). 

 The analysis of the gonads of the animals from the initial group was considered an 

initial reference for what would be observed in other animals throughout the experiment. 

Before the pre-established results for the genus Astyanax, it could be seen the final stage of 

animals sampled in the maturation experiment in the course of hours. It was observed the 

predominance of oocytes in an advanced stage of development, whose cytoplasm was filled 

with yolk granules, which have rounded shape (Fig. 13). This oocyte maturation stage is 

classified as vitellogenic, the stage considered as the starting point for the animals initially 

used.

 Qualitatively, the cells observed on the slides allowed the classification of the groups 

in relation to the time of sampling and their evolution throughout the experiment (Fig.15). 

Using this criterion, the most frequently observed cells have been described, such as the 

presence of vitellogenic oocytes along the cortical cellular oocytes. Additionally to these 

oocyte developmental stages, it was determined the presence of POFs (postovulatory 

follicles), a determining factor to estimate the efficiency of the protocol applied. 

 In general the animals from the initial group had vitellogenic oocytes in greater 

quantity than cortical alveolar and were not detected POFs. In females from the Saline group 

it was possible to estimate the predominance of vitellogenicoocytes, however the presence of 

POFs was slight, even at the time of spawning. The animals collected from approximately 24 

hours divided between ovulated and vitellogenic (Fig. 16), predominating the second group, 

corroborating the data presented in the reproductive performance results. 

 Given the large number of vitellogenic oocytes it can be observed troublesomeform of 

connective tissue stroma and may be concluded that the animal was in an advanced stage of 

maturation, since the number of oocytes at early stages of development (cortical-alveolar and 

perinucleolar) was low and it was displayed among the vitellogenic oocytes. However, oocyte 

nucleus migration was not registered in the periphery of the cell, a possible indication that the 

animal still need more time to ovulation or that this event may not occur without an additional 

stimulus.

 From the visualization of histological sections it was observed that the animals from 

all experimental groups were at an advanced stage of maturity, however, the number of 

animals that reached ovulation until the end of the experiment varied. The group that received 

hCG presented individuals at different stages of oocyte development, plus POFs on the first

sampling of the experiment (Fig. 16g), without, however spawning before the end of the 

experiment. This observation suggests a period of about 12 hours between ovulation and 

spawning, which was also observed in the Stress group. 

 In the sampling realized at the time of spawning it was observed completely ovulated 

ovaries, and the presence of POFs was more frequent in the Stress and hCG groups (Figs. 16c, 

h) compared with the Saline group. These data corroborated the GSI values, which decreased 

in females from the Stress group at the end of the experiment, but did not change in the 

animals of Saline group. Taking into account the different experimental groups, the 

qualitative comparison among the groups suggests the greater presence of POFs in the Stress 

and hCG groups in the 24 hour period of the experiment (Figs. 16c, h). Still within the Stress 

group, during the initial and intermediate periods the ovaries were full of vitellogenic oocytes, 

which have been somewhat replaced by POFs at spawning (Figs. 15 and 16). 

 

Hormonal analysis  

 Whereas one of the main objectives of the work was to evaluate possible hormonal 

variations during the experiment, we have chosen to present the results over the time for the 

analyzed steroids. There was no statistical difference in the plasma CORT concentration 

throughout the experimental period considering each experimental group (Fig. 17) (P = 0.711, 

0.775 and 0.411 for Saline, hCG and Stress groups, respectively). However, analyzing the 

different experimental groups at each period it was observed that in the intermediate period, 

about 12 hours after the beginning of the experiment, plasma CORT levels were higher in 

females from the Stress group, when compared with females from the other groups (P = 

0.018),showing a peak. At the initial and spawning period of experiment, plasma showed no 

difference among the groups (P = 0.946 and P = 0.472, respectively).  

In the 17 OHP plasma levels (Fig.18) there was no difference among the groups over the 24 

hours, with the concentration unchanged within the groups (P = 0.643, Saline group; P = 

0.519,Stress group; and P = 0.669,hCG group).The comparison among the different times also 

showed no significant differences (P = 0.989, P = 0.091 and P = 0.196, respectively, for the 

initial, intermediate and spawning periods).

Cortisol receptor and ?-actin expression PCR results 
 
 After analysis of GENETYX© program and subsequent cloning, the purified samples 

for CR gene allowed us to obtain sequences with approximately 800bp (Fig. 21), while Beta-

actin consensus (21a) reveled had ?300bp (19b). The results for CR running are demonstrated 

below (Fig. 19).To obtaining the results we realized tests to determine the best conditions for 

reaction optimization of time and voltage to the gel running, conditions adapted for 

expression of each gene of interest.The results for optimization are present below (Fig.20). 

 

 
 
Figure 19: Results for the CR gene expression on the all groups during the experiment. To obtain these results, 
the samples ran at 8µ l for 11 minutes at 135V. On the asterisk (*) A = animal control; H= hCG group; S = Saline 
group and E = Stress group. 
 

 When we saw the first results we could realize that this gene has a positive expression 

in all experiment, such as positive control. Then we optimized the PCR (Fig. 20), modifying 

the time for the running, and then, we could visualize a faith expression on the beginning and 

most strong expression in the end.

Progesterone receptor and Progesterone receptor associated to MIS -PCR results 
 

After analysis of GENETYX® program and subsequent cloning, the purified samples 

for PR and subsequently to the derivate of progesterone, 17,20- dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one, 

through research made in GenBank (NCBI) and then aligning made by GENETYX®, allowed 

us to obtain sequences with approximately 800bp.The result for the consensus alignment is 

showed below (Figs. 24a, b,c,d).For those results we ran the gel using the cDNA provided by 

the same samples to compare the gene expression of the target receptor on the same time. So, 

we could observe for some samples the expression for one or other receptor indicating 

different conditions inside the same group. If we compare all groups for the two genes, we 

can observe, for Stress group, the number of samples expressing the receptor for MIS is 

bigger than the PR, different from the other two groups, in which the number of samples 

expressing a stronger band for PR is observed.

 The result for the automated sequencing and genetic consensus was determined by 

GENETYX® (Figs. 25 and27), reveling the conserved regions and sequence for the both 

receptors. Along the sequences, insertions, characteristics for the A.altiparanae(Figs. 25 and 

27)can be observed for both sequences. After the consensus, the sequence was determined by 

around 800 bp (Figs. 26 and 28). For best results in the agar gel, tests with different cycles, 

temperature, volume of PCR products, run time and voltage were performed (adapted by 

Yang et al.,1994 method). The results can be seen below (Fig. 29).

Real-time quantitative PCR 

 For the RT-PCR analysis, aEfa1 gene (kindly donated by Dr. M.IBorella), specific for 

the genus Astyanax, was used as a reference gene. This gene was used for normalizing the 

results observed in the absolute quantification for CR and PR genes. The results, 

demonstrated by the Melting Curve and the Flowchart for Efa1 gene expression (Figs 30 and 

31), CR (Figs. 32 33, 34 and 35) and PR (Figs. 36, 37, 38 and 39) are demonstrated below.

Discussion 
 
Fertilization rates, histological and hormonal analyses 

 The objective of this study was to test the combined effects of high density and 

increased water flow as stress factors, able to induce ovulation in Astyanax altiparanae and 

relate the results to the possible physiological causes.The protocol for the captive breeding of 

A. altiparanae known as "stress inducing" was successful providing a greater volume of eggs 

in the stress group compared with other experimental groups.Regarding the results found in 

the other groups we can infer that the mechanical action of induction by itself (needle 

punching and  saline injection) was not able to  accelerate ovulation or even increase the 

success of spawning as can be observed in the GSI calculated values between the first and the 

second period within that group. 

In the hCG group, considered as the positive control for the induction of ovulation in, 

denote the ability of the synthetic hormone to induce ovulation and spawning, as described by 

Baldisserotto (2002), which reports that the ability of hCG to induce ovulation may be as 

effective as hormones commonly used as ovulation induction promoter in fish farming, such 

as GnRH or LH. Therefore, in A. altiparanae it was possible to obtain a larger amount of 

eggs, i.e., ovulation has been possible with inducing agents, such as hCG or stress, being 

connected to the stimuli by agglomeration and increase of the water flow. 

Also in relation to the results obtained in the reproductive performance of animals, 

possible changes caused by abiotic factors can be excluded, which mostly showed no 

significant differences, except for the pH. The differences in the pH values can be attributed 

to the difference in the volume of water in the Stress group as well as differences in water 

flow in the tank. In this regard, it is notable that the exclusion of abiotic factors as 

determinants of the results ensures merit to the experimental protocol to induction, and 

ensures that the results obtained in the groups are purely statements of physiological 

modulation of animals to stimuli, as quoted by Aragão and Araújo (2006), to highlight the 

importance of removing the interference of bias in experimental protocols. 

  It is known that genre Astyanax, ovarian development is similar to other teleosts 

where the ovaries are paired organs developed as elongated and leaf-like changes in color and 



62 

 

thickness sustained throughout the reproductive cycle (Drummond, 1996). The gametes pass 

through the following phases: Initial, Previtellogenic andVitellogenic.Evaluating the results of 

morphological analysis, we conclude they refer to mature cells or vitellogenic at time zero 

(0h) and post-vitellogenic follicles at the end of the experiment, indicating positive response 

to ovulation and spawning, coinciding with the descriptions of the genre (Pereira-Filho, 

2000). 

Regarding hormonal profiles, several studies have shown a duality functionamong the 

possible actions of corticosteroids, being able to inhibit the reproductive performance of fish 

(Small, 2004;. Milla et al, 2009). These authors reported that corticosteroids can cause 

adverse effects on reproduction and its action throughout the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal 

(HPG) axis. Foo and Lam (1993) argue in their study, thatCORT administration delayed the 

reproductive process and the quality of spawning in tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus). 

Unlike in the study presented by these authors, stress conditions  stimulate increased 

corticosteroid production, but did not decrease or blocked the activity of other hormones, such 

as progestin, for example. This behavior may be related to high reproductive plasticity 

presented by this species on the reproduction. From the results obtained using the stress 

protocol, we can infer that the modulating action of CORT did not inhibit the reproductive 

performance of A. altiparanae females. 

In A. altiparanae, we could observe the positive action of corticosteroids in the final 

maturation, considering that the animals showed good spawning results, corroborating 

Kubokawaet al., (1999), which attributed to CORT an important role in the maturation of 

Perciformes and on metabolic parameters presented by the animals during this period. 

Since the 1980s, in some species of teleost as Oncorhynchus mykiss, Salmo trutta, 

Carassius auratus and Cyprinus carpioa peak of plasma CORT was detected at the time of 

ovulation (Cook et al., 1980;.Pickering and Christie, 1981;Bry, 1985;Kime and Dolben, 

1985), a response that was found in A. altiparanae females from the Stress group, which 

denotes a common profile for this species with the experiments carried out in recent decades. 

Additionally, it is already known the ability of teleost gonads (testes and ovaries) in 

synthesizing corticosteroids (Milla et al., 2009). 

 Stolte et al. (2008) suggested that corticosteroid receptors could be regulated in 

accordance with different types of stress in Cyprinus carpio and that the period of greater 

activity of the stressor was accompanied by behavioral changes in animals due to high 



63 

 

sensitivity to stress. Among the aforesaid cases, deaths have been reported in individuals with 

high plasma concentrations of corticosteroids. Furthermore, Berg et al., (2005) described the 

action of corticosteroids in blocking gonadal progestins receptors, which may be related to a 

negative action in the maturation and subsequent reproduction of some species. 

 The progestagen17?OHP is known as a precursor steroid in the maturation of oocytes 

in fish and its synthesis proceeds, as in all steroids, from cholesterol. 17?OHP is synthesized 

from progesterone and it is subsequently converted into 17?,20?-dihidroxy-4pregnen-3one, 

known as maturation induction steroid (MIS) in granulose cells (Lubzens et al., 

2010;Munakata and Kobayashi, 2010). During the experiment with A. altiparanae it can be 

observed homogeneous concentration of this hormone in plasma, throughout the experimental 

period in all experimental groups.  

Considering that 17 OHP is converted to MIS near the ovulation, we might initially expect 

high levels of this hormone and differences among the experimental groups. However, the 

results were quite different than expected, as this hormone did not change during the 

experiment. As 17 OHP is rapidly converted into other hormones (MIS, androstenedione and 

corticosteroids, mostly) we could infer that it could have been used both in the production of 

MIS as expected by the work of Peter and Yu (1997), and diverted to the CORT pathway 

production, as suggested in studies as Munakata and Kobayashi (2010). According to Planas 

et al., (1992) MIS is very critical at the moment of "germinal vesicle breakdown" (VGBD), 

preparing the oocytes for fertilization, a period in which insufficient levels result in possible 

failure in the reproductive process. 

 One hypothesis for the results that have been generated can be the plasticity of A. 

altiparanae in the stressful conditions of captivity, so the animals would be able to use the 

stress situation as a potentiating agent of spawning. The results may be related as suggested 

by Copley (2003) with regard to "promiscuous" of steroid receptors, suggesting here that 

CORT can act as MIS due to its ability to bind to the receptors of the progestogen, amplifying 

action and reducing the effective action of other hormones. The contrary is also known; in 

Oryzias latipes progestins can activate glucocorticoid receptors (Miyagawa et al., 2015). In A. 

altiparana ewe can infer a positive action of corticosteroids in the maturation, because the 

animals showed good spawning results, corroborating Kubokawa et al., (1999), who 

attributed to CORT an important role in the maturation of Perciformes. 



64 

 

 According to the data presented, CORT levels fluctuated throughout the 24 hours of 

experiment, showing a peak in the intermediate period of approximately 12 hours in the Stress 

group, when various POFs were already found in the ovaries of these animals. This peak of 

CORT at ovulation has also been reported in other classes of vertebrates, however, the 

understanding of the role of this hormone and if the increased levels can be considered as 

cause or consequence of the ovulatory process is still speculative (Millaet al., 2009). This 

peak can be correlated with ovulation, a process that demands high energy expenditure and 

resulting in the production of steroid inducer of final maturation (MIS), or even that CORT 

itself can also act as MIS. In “pacu”, Piaractusmesopotamicus, a species from the same 

family of A. altiparanae(Characidae) CORT levels were higher in females at the advanced 

stage of maturity, as well as the time of ovulation with LHRH (Gazolaet al., 1996), 

confirming the importance of CORT in the ovulation process. In our hypothesis, the results 

obtained in the animals from the Stress group allow us to infer, in this case in particular, that 

CORT can be considered an important stimulus for ovulation of this species in captivity. The 

use of this protocol can spare the use of synthetic hormones in breeding protocol of this 

species, allowing positive results in a short time. 

 

Molecular analyses 

 Some physiological effects of steroid hormones are too rapid to be mediated by the 

classical genomic mechanism of steroid action involving activation of nuclear steroid 

receptors (Yang et al., 1994). Rapid, non-genomic steroid actions initiated on the cell surface 

have been described in a wide variety of animal, tissue, and cell models (Revelli et al 1998). 

Corticosteroid signaling is mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor (CR) and 

mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), which are ligand-activated transcription factors. CRs and 

MRs possess the four functional domains common to nuclear hormone receptors: A/B, C 

(DNA-binding), D (hinge region), and E (ligand-binding) domains. The C and E domains are 

highly conserved across vertebrates (Mommsen et al, 1999, Pascual-Le et al., 2005). 

 In teleosts, CR and its ligand CORT are best known for their roles in the stress 

response and, specifically, modulate aspects of intermediary metabolism, growth, behavior, 

and immune function (Charmandari, 2005). But, when considering the role of CORT in 

reproduction, there is not a consensus among the researches about positive or deleterious 

effects (Milla et al., 2009). Depending on the period and the intensity of stressor application, 



65 

 

it may cause follicular artesian, advance or delay oocyte maturation and ovulation or affect 

egg size, fertilization success, spawning behavior and progeny quality (Clearwater and 

Pankhurst, 1997; Coward et al., 1998;Schrecket al., 2001;Okumura et al., 2002). 

Furthermore, the presence of corticosteroid receptors in reproductive tissues including ovaries 

and testis, as the corticosteroid receptors gene expression (gluco- and mineralocorticoid 

receptors) found in the male/ female gonads where the transcripts were detected in the ovary 

(Sturm et al., 2005; Milla et al., 2006) and corticosteroid receptors (Colombe et al., 2000; 

Filby and Tyler, 2007; Milla et al., 2008) leads to the consideration that corticosteroids can 

exert positive or inhibitory effects on reproductive functions, as hypothesized here for A. 

altiparanae, with the possibility of induction of spawning mediated by stressful stimuli. 

 When we evaluated the performance of reproduction of A. altiparanae by counting the 

number of fertilized eggs, and measured the levels of CORT and 17?OHP, we can infer that 

stress triggered a modulation in the production of steroids, mainly CORT and rapidly, since in 

hours, the animals had conditions to spawn when stressed, whereas without any stimulation 

there was a delay to spawn.  

Considering the higher CORT levels at the intermediate period of females from the 

stress group, it was clear the importance to evaluate the expression of CR gene, as well as 

understand the pattern of expression of progesterone receptor (PR) gene, since the literature 

suggests a higher expression of CR and a low expression of PR as a compensatory effect 

derived from a "diversion of resources" for the production of CORT, since the synthetic 

pathway of both hormones is similar. 

 To determine the possibility of the ovulation stimuli by CORT, we chose to observe 

the expression of membrane receptors involved, which could signal a stimulation of the 

pathway and its consequent production, explaining the results in hormonal assays. However, 

we found that the CR gene is expressed throughout the experimental period, even in animals 

experimentally not stressed, Saline control and hCG females, a pattern that can be considered 

a characteristic of this species. 

Analysis of the data showed, however, that the gene expression compared CR was 

similar among the female of all groups, however, there is a tendency of an increase in CR 

gene expression in the intermediate period of females from the stress group, coinciding with 

the time of CORT peak.We know that animals from the Stress group had the best results for 

reproductive performance, then the chance for positive and stimulating role of CORT rinA. 



66 

 

altiparanaereproduction may suggest a truly positive mechanism, differing from studies 

where the peak of CORT can be deleterious for ovulation, as Brown (2003) say in his study 

withSalvelinus fontinalis. This kind of situation wasreported  in another species, as rainbow 

trout, where females undergoing acute stress produce small amounts of eggs (Campbell et al., 

1992) . 

These results could be explained by some types of interactions between the CR and the 

Progesterone receptor (PR). However, the strong answer in ovaries for PR expression did not 

show great results for spawning, such as the “Serum” (control) group results, for example.  

So, when we saw the optimized PCR results, we observed that very clear bands for PR 

expression did not so stronger on the Stress member group.  

This was one point to suppose the substrate that has been used for CORT production. 

Another interesting fact about the result on the Stress group is while PR for 17OHP was not 

producing stronger bands, the derivative, associate at 17,20? DHP hormone, had produced 

sensitivity for expression on the tissue analyzed. This is an important step to elucidate the 

relation between those two hormones on the reproduction and associate an important and 

positive role for the CORT on this group. 

 Focusing on CORT during reproduction, the role of this steroid must be undertaken 

with higher caution regarding the potential interaction between plasma CORT levels and 

mating activities (Greenwood et al., 2003). In consequence, blood sampling should be rapidly 

carried out to avoid any CORT contamination due to a stressful physiological state. Regarding 

the other corticosteroids, if the effects of stress on their blood plasma release remain 

undetermined, one should pay the same attention to them. On the other hand, reproduction 

often corresponds to a fasting period, or is at least accompanied with a decrease of feeding. 

As the plasma glucocorticoid levels are linked to the fish nutritional status, it may therefore be 

difficult to distinguish between the glucocorticoid fluctuations linked to reproductive 

physiological state and those linked to the alteration of the energetic metabolism, providing 

the necessary adjustment to cause a physiological stimulus for spawning, even without the 

strong expression of derivatives of progesterone (Zhu et al., 2003) 

 What can be inferred by these results is that there would be no "diversion" of resources 

for production of CORT and consequently a low expression for progestagen receptor and its 

derivatives, but that the gene expression of progesterone and CORT receptors remained high 



67 

 

at the same time, which suggests another factor stimulating spawning of animals, that did not 

show strong bands for the expression in all animal for progesterone on the conventional PCR.  

 We suggest that somehow the same period of gene expression of CORT and PR 

associated to MIS (17,20-DHP) receptors has allowed the animals to ovulation and 

subsequent spawning, even with animals in the group showing no different results in the 

conventional PCR analysis for PR (Control and Stress groups). 

 When we look at the results found in the conventional PCR and compared with the values 

found for the gene expression of the same targets genes, we realize that the answer to the 

reproductive behavior shown by these animals may depend on a combination of factors, 

which may be associated with another pathway for steroid synthesis. Analyzing the values 

obtained, we suggest that the PR may represent significant differences to influence the 

spawning in the other two groups, since no animals in the control group or animals treated 

with stressor stimulus demonstrated any differences in their hormonal profiles, for example. 

When comparing the results between the groups, taking into account the division of animals 

sampled before and after spawning, the statistical difference observed, occurred only in the 

animals of hCG group. This result lies within expectations, since the group had a hormone 

stimulating factor. Compared with the other groups PR gene expression was sharp in hCG 

group, but no statistical significant differences were found in Stress and Saline groups, which 

would be an indicator that 17 OHP is not really necessary to spawning in these animals. This 

corroborates the findings that another steroid, in this case, CORT can be somehow 

modulating ovulation and spawning in animals, but not through CR. 

Cortisol is the main corticosteroid in teleosts, secreted in response to stressor exposure 

and plays a key role in stress adaptation (Mommsen et al, 1999). But, when we analyzed the 

CR gene expression, interestingly, the profile of the saturation curve suggests a low gene 

expression in the ovaries, demonstrating a different approach from those results obtained in 

the gel bands by conventional PCR. So, when analyzing the values found for CR, gene 

expression there were no statistical differences to confirm our hypothesis that CORT could 

exert a stimulatory effect in ovulation (acting as MIS) observed in the reproduction. However, 

the results obtained in plasma of females from group Stress (peak of CORT into ovulation) 

indicate an undeniable role of this steroid in the behavior and/or spawning animals. Given 

these results, we can infer other possibilities, considering that this receptor represents one of 

the largest and possibly most ancient classes of receptors, responding to a diverse array of 



68 

 

signaling molecules (Bockaert and Pin, 1999). One possibility is that the receptor gene 

expression does not necessarily correspond to the active form of the encoded protein (Millaet 

al., 2009).  

 Moreover, when testing some steroid combinations, a synergy in the maturational 

response was demonstrated between corticosteroids and MIS since the 80s. For example, in 

vitro treatments with CORT increased the sensitivity of oocytes to MIS in rainbow trout 

(Jalabert and Fostier, 1984).We can link these results within that study, when observe the 

gene expression results in A. altiparanae treated with hCG. Thus, although the MIS receptor 

is identified and the partial sequence for the associated receptor described, as the first results 

for these genes for this species, therefore, these results support that corticosteroids might be 

directly and/or indirectly involved in final oocyte maturation control. 

 Finally, we suggest that the ovaries of A. altiparanae are able to respond to the 

corticosteroids stimulation and CORT, the main corticosteroid in fish, displays direct and 

positive effects in relation to reproduction in this species. Additionally, the available data 

indicates that corticosteroids may participate in the modulation of reproductive endocrine 

control, and together with progesterone, may prove to be a possible trigger, allowing 

satisfactory results in captive breeding. 

We believe that the relationship between the progesterone derivatives (17,20DHP) must be 

further studied in order to determine the actual level of output required for stimulation of the 

animals, as well as the role of the actions of corticosteroids and progesterone together in end 

of the steroidogenic pathway.This step can be considered as satisfactory taking into account 

the limited knowledge about the sequences or gene expression of steroid receptors on global 

genetic databases.We would like to highlight the importance of these results for future 

research, assuming that hormone receptors and their interaction are impacting on the 

reproduction of the species of vertebrates. 

 In conclusion, the results here found contribute to elucidate the physiological basis 

that drives the reproductive plasticity of this species. The ability of A. altiparanae to 

reproduce under stress conditions triggers new ideas about hormonal pathways involved in 

fish ovulation and spawning. Additionally, this proposal provided important data about 

genetic sequences of CR and PR and the interaction between them during the experiments. 

Therefore, we do not rely only on steroid plasma profile to understand the physiological 



69 

 

modulation of ovulation under stress conditions, starting a deeper understanding of this

Annex 5 – Extracting DNA from the Agar gel 

First estimate the µ g of DNA present on the cut band.  

1. Determine weight of agarose gel band slice in a 1.5- 2.0 ml tube. 

2. Add 1/2 volume of ULTRA MELT and 4.5 volumes of ULTRA SALT 

(example: if TBE GEL = 0.1grams, add 0.05ml (50µ l) ULTRA MELT and 0.45ml of 

ULTRA SALT) 

3. Mix well 

4. Incubate at 55°C to melt agarose gel. Mix occasionally by shaking thoroughly. 

Completely melt gel before proceeding (approximately 5 minutes).  

5. Re-suspend ULTRA BIND by vortexing at highest speed with ULTRA BIND 

tube in a horizontal position until homogeneous (around 1 minute) 

6. Add ULTRA BIND: 5 plus 1µ l per µ g of DNA you expect to recover (e.g. for 

0-1µ g of DNA use 6µ l) 

7. Incubate 5 minutes at room temperature. Mix several times during this binding 

step by flicking the tube for small volumes or shaking and inverting for large volumes. 

8. Centrifuge 5 seconds. Remove the supernatant and set aside.  

9. Ensure 250ml of 100% ethanol was added to the ULTRA WASH before using 

for the first time. Re-suspend the pellet in 1ml of ULTRA WASH/EtOH by vortexing 

5-10 seconds. Soak for 5 minutes instead.  

10. Centrifuge 5 seconds. Discart the supernatant. 

11. Centrifuge 5 seconds again. Remove all traces of Ultra Wash by aspirating 

with a narrow pipet tip. 

12. Re-suspend the pellet in water or TE (10mM Tris, 0.1mM EDTA). Use a 

volume twice that of the Ultra Bind silica used before and re-suspend by pipetting 

until homogeneous. Don’t vortex. Disrupt pellet with the pipet tip and then pipet up 

and down to make sure the entire pellet is re-suspended. 



83 

 

13. Incubate up to 5 minutes at room temperature. 

14. Centrifuge 1 minute.  

15. Remove the supernatant immediately and transfer it to a new tube. If white 

silica is carried over, spin again and transfer the supernatant to a new tube. The DNA 

will be ready to use for directly sequencing or use for cloning. 

 

Annex 6 – Cloning purification  

1. First at all, make sure place the Binding Buffer on ice before starting the procedure.  

2. Prepare the incubated tube, centrifuge at 13.000xg for 30 seconds. Discard the 

supernatant. 

3. Add 250µ l Suspension Buffer + RNase to the centrifuge tube containing the bacterial 

pellet. 

4. Re-suspend the bacterial pellet and mix well. 

5. Add 250µ l of Lysis Buffer. Mix gently by inverting the tube 3~6 times. Is important 

do not vortex. Incubate for 5 minutes at any temperature between +15°C and +25°C. 

6. Then, treat the lysed solution add 350µ l chilled Binding Buffer. Mix gently by 

inverting the tube 3 to 6 times and then incubate on ice for 5 minutes.  

7. Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 13.000 x g. 

8.  After the centrifugation, insert one High Pure filter tube into one Collection Tube.  

9. Transfer the entire supernatant into upper buffer reservoir of the Filter tube and insert 

the entire higher pure tube assembly into a centrifuge.  

10. Centrifuge for 1 minute at full speed.  

11. After this centrifugation the Filter tube from the Collection Tube should be removed 

and the flow through liquid should be discarded. The Filter tube should be re-inserted 

on the same collection tube.  

12. So, add 500µ l of Wash Buffer I to the upper reservoir of the Filter Tube.  

13. Centrifuge for 1 minute at full speed and discard the flow through 

14. Add 700µ l of Wash Buffer II to the upper reservoir of the Filter Tube. Centrifuge for 

30-60 seconds at full speed and discard the flow through 

15. After discarding, centrifuge the entire High Pure assembly for additional 1 minute. So, 

discard the Collection Tube.

16. Insert the Filter Tube into a clean, sterile 1.5 ml centrifuge tube.  

17. Add 100µ l of Elution Buffer or double dist water to the upper reservoir of the Filter 

Tube. 

18. Centrifuge the tube assembly for 1 minute at full speed.  

19. Then, the micro-centrifuge tube now contains the eluted plasmid DNA
