ABSTRACT 
 

Pre-salt basins and their exploration have become more and more frequently mentioned over 

the years, not just for their potential reserves, but also for the implicit challenges in terms of 

operations to face in order to make these fields commercially viable. Several research efforts 

aimed at addressing these related barriers, in which drilling optimization and efficiency are 

presented as a considerably complex area. The problematic is concentrated in the low 

drillability and in the high cost involved when drilling the pre-salt carbonates. 
 

The outcome of this research is based in studies performed on top of eight pre-salt wells, 

addressing drilling operational time savings referenced by benchmarks and drilling mechanics 

parameters choosiness. The studies were based on simulations performed with penetration rate 

(ROP) modeling combined with specific energy (SE). The Bourgoyne Jr. and Young Jr. (1974) 

ROP model was used given the high errors presented for the other models, higher than 40% 

and, in terms of SE, the formulations from Teale (1965) and Pessier et al. (1992) were used. All 

these classic literature are still present in the industry and the software Oracle Crystal Ball was 

used as a supportive tool for the simulations. 
 

This research yielded four important results: 1) the polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) is 

the most suitable drill-bit choice for pre-salt, presenting the lowest teeth-cutters wear rate, 0.28 

[%/ m]; 2) the possible spare in operational time encountered for the pre-salt operations 

represent a saving of approximately 13,747,550.00 [USD] for the analyzed pre-salt wells; 3) 

the final mathematical model developed, after the adjustments for pre-salt, foresee an 

improvement dropping the relative error from 36.52% to 23.12% in terms of comparing the 

calculated and modeled ROP with the field measured ROP; 4) the final model yielded from the 

combination of the ROP and SE formulations is the most adequate to be used in the industry, 

since it was possible to foresee an improvement by dropping the relative error even more, from 

23.12% to 21.2%.

RESUMO 
 

As bacias do pré-sal e sua exploração se tornaram cada vez mais mencionadas ao longo dos 

anos, não apenas por seu potencial de reservatório, mas também devido aos grandes desafios 

implícitos em termos de operações a serem enfrentados para tornar estes campos 

comercialmente viáveis. Várias pesquisas vêm sendo desenvolvidas visando contornar estas 

barreiras, das quais a otimização e eficiência de perfuração se apresentam como uma área 

consideravelmente complexa. A problemática se concentra nas baixas taxas de penetração e no 

alto custo envolvido ao se perfurar as seções dos carbonatos do pré-sal. 
 

Os resultados da pesquisa apresentados nesta tese baseiam-se em análises com oito poços do 

pré-sal, abordando economia de tempo operacional com base em análises referenciadas em 

benchmarks e escolhas de parâmetros mecânicos de perfuração. Os estudos foram baseados em 

simulações realizadas com modelagem de taxa de penetração (ROP) combinadas com energia 

específica (SE). Utilizou-se o modelo de ROP de Bourgoyne Jr.e Young Jr. (1974) face aos 

altos erros apresentados pelos outros modelos, superiores a 40% e, em termos de SE, utilizou-

se o equacionamento de Teale (1965) e Pessier et al. (1992). Todas estas literaturas classicas 

ainda estão presentes na indústria e o software Oracle Crystal Ball foi utilizado como uma 

ferramenta de apoio para as simulações. 
 

Os resultados deste trabalho mostraram quatro conclusões importantes: 1) a broca de perfuração 

do tipo polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) é a mais adequada para o pré-sal, apresentando 

uma taxa de desgaste de dentes-cortadores de 0.28 [%/ m]; 2) a possível diminuição de tempo 

de operação encontrada após análises de performance de operação pode resultar em uma 

economia de aproximadamente 13,747,550.00 [USD] para os poços do pré-sal analisados; 3) o 

modelo matemático final desenvolvido, após os ajustes para o pré-sal, pode garantir uma 

melhoria do erro relativo de 36.52% para 23.12% em termos de comparação entre o ROP 

calculado e o ROP medido durante a atividade no campo; 4) o modelo final como resultado da 

junção do equacionamento de ROP e SE é o mais adequado para a indústria, uma vez que foi 

possível garantir uma diminuição ainda maior do erro relative, de 23.12% para 21.2%.

1 INTRODUCTION 

Pre-salt basins and their exploration have become more and more frequently mentioned over 

the years, not just for their potential reserves, but also for the implicit challenges in terms of 

general operations (downstream and upstream) addressed to make these fields commercially 

viable. Several research efforts aimed at addressing these related barriers, but the known 

challenges of drilling optimization and efficiency resulted from considerably low drillability 

throughout the pre-salt carbonates is still present. The pre-salt market trend has been frequently 

explored over the years in Brazil and in Angola and, considering these countries’ potential in 

terms of oil and natural gas, these reserves have a considerable importance in each country’s 

economy and energy outlook. Moreover, since one of the barriers still faced is the high 

operational cost and the downside of drilling related events, by boosting directly or indirectly 

the drilling activities, the possibility of having these fields coming through economically is 

enhanced. Thus, studies are still under performance in several related research areas in order to 

model a way to allow reliable forecast and drilling parameters choosiness for efficiency 

assurance while performing drilling operations.  
 

In this sense, this thesis is based in the analysis of the pre-salt carbonates operations focusing 

in operations that was carried in the South Atlantic Ocean. Considering the low oil prices and 

the also Petrobras scandal in Brazil, it is fair to say that any improvements that may result in 

cost savings can help even more in making these pre-salt fields to come through.  

 

Thus, the originality of this research can be seen firstly by the pre-salt wells statistical study 

presented, from which an identity was drawn to refer numerically to these layers, allowing 

analysis to be developed. Subsequently, the research novelty was presented by a new 

methodology of ROP and SE models combination aiming drilling optimization. From the 

determination of operational time savings, of the best drill-bit to be used in these regions, of 

drill-bit teeth-cutters wear rate, up to in-situ geothermal and pressure profiles, a ROP model 

was modified accordingly, in order to reflect specifically the pre-salt wells. After the ROP 

model adjustments, it was combined with the SE formulations, yielding as a final result a path 

for determining the best set of drilling mechanics parameters, aiming to support the industry 

for an efficient and optimized operation, and so, potentializing costs reduction.

5       CONCLUSION 

Pre-salt basins and its exploration have become more and more frequently mentioned over the 

years. Considered a very important petroleum-related source given the world energetic demand 

forecast scenario, seeking ways to support in making these fields effectively commercially 

viable has its value.  
 

Supporting filling this gap, the exploration of the pre-salt reserves from related areas of the 

South Atlantic Ocean (in special the Brazilian and Angolan coast) has a very important role in 

this context, since they can be considered twin pre-salt analog clusters. Seen as a considerably 

high operational cost to develop these fields, due to several facts disserted, this wells can cost 

up to 134,000,000.00 [USD]. Hence, to address performance and possible ways for improving 

the efficiency of the pre-salt operation has been a route aiming support the refereed 

problematics. 
 

With the support of eight pre-salt wells and thirty eight run information, statistical analyses 

were drawn from the gathered and filtered data, allowing the following conclusion in terms of 

operational performance: 
 

- From the total of thirty eight runs, almost half of them were drilled using a PDC drill-bit. 
From the other types, the hybrid showed to be appropriated as well, while the TCI and 

diamond impregnated did not show to have good performance. The most frequent 

encountered problem in the drill-bits relates to broken and worn teeth-cutters. 

-  For some runs, the allowed drilling mechanics parameters choosiness window were going 

beyond the down-hole tools limitations, what certainly influenced related BHA related 

failure, consequently leading to operational down-time. 

- The operational performance showed to still allow improvements considering the non-

productive time and invisible-lost time analyzed. The following total minimum potential 

operational time savings was found: 37.1 [h] for well # A, 19.79 [h] for well # B, 48.8 [h] 

for well # C, 8.15 [h] for well #D, 22.34 [h] for well # F and 105.94 [h] for well # H, 

totalizing approximately 242 [h] (or 10 [days]), equivalent to 13,747,550.00 [USD]. 

 

 

 

 



102 
 

Considering the drillability improvements, much has been understood from the used models, 

allowing driving the following conclusions: 
 

- The Bourgoyne Jr. and Young Jr. ROP model is suitable for pre-salt formations, but some 

parameters adjustments were necessary to make it realistic for these carbonate formations. 

With a starting point of model fitting with 36.52% as a relative error, this model showed to 

correlate most. The relative error dropped to 23.12% after the pre-salt adjustments. 

- The SE modeling shows to be more reliable than the ROP modeling in terms of simulation 

fitting. By comparing the field with the modeled data, the SE showed to have a relative 

error lower the one calculated for the ROP, of 21.12%. 

- The reverse engineering methodology seems to be a very good way of re-building the drill-

rate test curve for better visualization and drilling parameters boundaries determination. 

- Considering the pre-salt well # B used for the simulation as a case study, it was possible to 

verify that for sake of better analysis and clarification, filtering and data split may also 

apply in research with similar purposes. 
 

This thesis details a lot of step-by-step from data analysis up to final drilling mechanics 

parameters choosiness, allowing understanding where the room for a better performance in the 

pre-salt operations are.  
 

For future work it may be interesting to address self- ROP/ SE models based on the pre-salt 

drilling mechanics information presented, in special on the drilling fluid details and flowing 

patterns, considering that the whole data set used for developing the thesis had reliable fluid 

mechanics information making a practicable research. Also, given the delicate narrow pressure 

window available for managing the equivalent circulating density and the equivalent static 

density, it may be very interesting to implement the usage of the manage pressure drilling 

concept for the pre-salt wells, what could have its applicability and well control assurance 

studied, in a first step, in extensive research, and subsequently, its implementation tested in real 

pre-salt related job. Another interesting thematic to be studied in a future work is the 

combination of big data concept together with the needs of reliable and in real-time decision 

making tools in drilling activities. By having a robust data collection of these pre-salt wells 

being stored as one, from activities developed and under development in the African and 

Brazilian coast, a very robust data set for statistical analysis would be present, helping in on-

line decision making. Still in this research line, the improvement of the real-time drill-rate tests 

is something very promising as a new well monitoring and analysis methodology, allowing the 



103 
 

operational crew to have in its accustomed way a view of a new tool supporting drilling 

optimization and drilling efficiency enhancement. Considering these new ideas and their 

novelty in the industry, attached to these future works, it would be possible to foresee the 

deposit of new petroleum-related patents.
