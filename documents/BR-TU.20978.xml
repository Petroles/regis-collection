Resumo
Introdução: Por apresentar ampla atividade  antibacteriana, a clorexidina (CHX) tem sido amplamente 
utilizada em odontologia, podendo ser facilmente incorporada ao cimento de ionômero de vidro (CIV) e liberada 
consequentemente na cavidade bucal. Objetivo: O objetivo neste estudo foi avaliar a porosidade e resistência à 
compressão de um CIV, ao qual foi adicionado diferentes concentrações de CHX. Material e método: Os espécimes 
foram preparados com CIV (Ketac Molar Esaymix) e divididos em 4 grupos de acordo com a concentração de CHX: 
controle, 0,5% e 1% e 2% (n=10). Para análise dos poros os espécimes foram fraturados com auxílio de martelo e 
cinzel cirúrgicos, de modo que a fratura era realizada no centro do corpo de prova, dividindo-o ao meio e as imagens 
obtidas no microscópio eletrônico de varredura (MEV) analisadas no software Image J. O teste de resistência à 
compressão foi realizado na máquina de ensaios mecânicos (EMIC - Equipamentos e Sistemas de Ensaios Ltda, São 
José dos Pinhais, PR, Brazil). A análise estatística foi realizada por ANOVA, complementada pelo teste de Tukey. 
Nível de significância adotado de 5%. Resultado: Não se observou alteração estatisticamente significante entre os 
grupos estudados tanto para o número de poros quanto para a resistência à compressão. Conclusão: O uso de CIV 
associado ao gluconato de CLX a 1% e 2% é a melhor opção para ser utilizada na clínica odontológica.

Abstract
Introduction: For presenting wide antibacterial activity, chlorhexidine (CHX) has been extensively used in 
dentistry and can be easily incorporated into the glass ionomer cement (GIC) and consequently released into the 
oral cavity. Aim: The aim of this study was porosity and compression strength of a GIC, that was added to different 
concentrations of CHX. Material and method: Specimens were prepared with GIC (Ketac Molar Esaymix) and 
divided into 4 groups according to the concentration of CHX: control, 0.5% and 1% and 2% (n = 10). For analysis 
of pores specimens were fractured with the aid of hammer and chisel surgical, so that the fracture was performed 
in the center of the specimens, dividing it in half and images were obtained from a scanning electron microscope 
(SEM) analyzed in Image J software. The compressive strength test was conducted in a mechanical testing machine 
(EMIC - Equipment and Testing Systems Ltd., Joseph of the Pines, PR, Brazil). Statistical analysis was performed by 
ANOVA, Tukey test. Significance level of 5%. Result: No statistically significant changes between the study groups 
was observed both for the number of pores as well as for the compressive strength. Conclusion: The use of GIC 
associated with CHX gluconate 1% and 2% is the best option to be used in dental practice.

INTRODUCTION

Glass ionomer cements (GICs) have the potential of 
preventing caries disease and possess important properties, such 
as biocompatibility, chemical adhesiveness to dental structures, 
fluoride-releasing capacity, reabsorption of fluoride from oral 
environmen1-3. They also have the capacity of re-organising 
dental tissues and inhibiting bacterial growth4.

It is known that chlorhexidine (CHX) can be released into 
the oral cavity5, thus being incorporated to GICs in order to 
potentialise the antibacterial effect of this material5,6. CHX 
stands out for its proven effectiveness against wide spectrum of 
pathogens oral cavity7,8 and low toxicity9.

Adding CHX to GIC can result in changes in the material’s 
mechanical properties because its micro-structure is affected5. 
Factors such as integrity of the interface between glass particles 
and polymeric matrix, size of the particles, amount and size of the 
pores in the material all play an important role in determining the 
mechanical properties7,10 such as compressive strength10.

Studies have been carried out in order to incorporate 
antibacterial agents to GICs3,5,6,7,11-14, such as CHX at 
different concentrations, showing effective results for certain 
microorganisms under in vitro conditions (Streptococcus 
mutans)3,6,12. Nevertheless, the incorporation of antibacterial 
agents into restorative materials can result in changes in their 
physical properties depending the concentration used3,5,6.

Despite the scientific evidence demonstrating changes in 
some mechanical properties of GICs associated to CHX, the 
literature shows no study reporting this effect on the porosity 
of this material. Therefore, the objective of this study was to 
assess the area and number of pores as well as the compressive 
strength of a GIC to which different concentrations of CHX were 
added. The hypothesis to be tested is that the addition of different 
concentrations of CLX not promote changes in the number and 
size of pores, as well as the strength of compression resistance.

MATERIAL AND METHOD

Forty specimens, for each testing being conducted, were 
prepared (3mm height x 6mm diameter) for four experimental 
groups divided according to the following CHX concentrations: 
control (no CHX); GIC  +  0.5% CHX; GIC  +  1% CHX; and 
GIC  +  2% CHX. The material used was a Ketac Molar Easymix 
cement (3M Espe, Seefeld, Germany) manipulated according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions by using plastic spatula and 
paper pad at controlled room temperature (23±1°C), air relative 
humidity of 50±5%, and then inserted into the matrix by using a 
Centrix syringe (DFL, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil).

The different concentrations of CHX were obtained from 
a 20% CHX solution (Sigma Aldrid, Steinheim, Germany) 
and then added to GIC during their manipulation by using a 
micro-pipette. After filling the matrices with one increment, 
the material was covered with polyester tape and a glass plate, 
on which a 100  gram weight was placed during 40 seconds 
for accommodation and extravasation of excess material. The 

specimens of all groups were prepared by only one person, thus 
assuring the same characteristics for manipulation and insertion 
of the material.

Prior to evaluation of the porosity, the samples were stored 
in an oven for 1 hour at 37oC and 90% relative humidity, then 
fractured aided surgical chisel and hammer, so that the fracture 
was performed in percent of the test body, dividing it in half and 
submitted to scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The resulting 
images (100x magnification) were analysed by using a Image J 
software (Rasband WS, Image J; US National Institutes of Health, 
Bethesda, MD, USA). In order to standardise the area to be 
analysed, the image was divided into quadrants and the upper 
left quadrant of each one was selected by using the software tools. 
Next, pores were delimitated and calculated15,16.

For assessment of the compressive strength, the specimens 
(n=10) were stored in oven for 24 hours at 37oC and 90% relative 
humidity and then submitted to mechanical testing in a universal 
testing machine (EMIC  -  Equipamentos e Sistemas de Ensaios 
Ltda, São José dos Pinhais, PR, Brazil) with load cell of 5 kN and 
operating at a cross-speed of 0.5 mm/min.

The values of area and number of pores and compressive 
strength were analysed in terms of data distribution and variance 
homogeneity by using the Shapiro-Wilk, Levene, and ANOVA 
tests. The SPSS version 13.0 software was used for statistics tests 
at significance level of 5% (P &amp;lt;0.05).

RESULT

Data on area occupied by pores and number of them as well 
as on compressive strength of the material are listed in Table 1.

The values of area occupied by pores in the GIC had normal 
distribution (Shapiro-Wilk’s test, p  =  0.062) and variance 
homogeneity (Levene’s test, p = 0.366). Adding CHX at different 
concentrations resulted in no statistically significant change in 
the area of pores (ANOVA, p = 0.083).

Analysis of the number of pores revealed normal distribution 
(Shapiro-Wilk’s test, p  =  0.08) but no variance homogeneity 
(Levene’s test, p  =  0.002). Adding CHX at a concentration of 
0.5% (Figure  1) decreased significantly the number of pores in 
the material (ANOVA with Tamhane`s correction, p = 0.001). At 
concentrations of 1% and 2% (Figure 1), no statistically significant 
differences were observed in the number of pores compared to 
the control group (Figure 1).

The values of compressive strength had normal distribution 
(Shapiro-Wilk`s test, p=0,776) and variance homogeneity 
(Levene’s test, p  =  0,081). Addition of CHX at different 
concentrations did not change the compressive strength of GIC 
significantly (ANOVA, p = 0.627)

DISCUSSION

Studies have been conduced to better understand the 
properties of GICs, with compressive strength test being the 
most common method used for assessing the resistance of these 



238 Marti , Azevedo, Mata et al. Rev Odontol UNESP. 2014; 43(4): 236-240

materials17. In fact, this test allows mechanical integrity of these 
materials to be assessed18.

The resistance of GICs is affected by the internal porosity 
depending on the method of manipulation as well, since 
hand-mixed cements have bubbles whose diameter is greater 
than that of the bubbles observed in encapsulated ones19. The 
generalised and inherent formation of pores within the GIC 
reduces its strength to flexion and cohesion20,11. These pores 
are regions of high concentration of stress, which increased the 
likelihood of fracture of the material22.

The capacity of the restorative materials to resist to functional 
forces is an important requisite for its long-term clinical 
performance. To be clinically accepted, the modified materials 
must have superior antimicrobial activity and show properties 
comparable to those of the conventional ones22.

In order to improve the antibacterial properties of the GICs, 
the addition of CHX to this material has been tested and showed 
excellent results3,10,17,23. According to Palmer  et  al5., GICs have 
the potential of slowly releasing active agents, such as fluoride24, 
and the CHX incorporated into GICS can be similarly released 
into the oral cavity. This association is aimed at reducing severity 
and frequency of secondary caries by decreasing failures and 
unsuccessful use of these restorative materials6,7,12,25. Based on the 
observation of the presence of viable bacteria in the remaining 
dentin after removal of the infected layer and proper sealing of 
the cavity researchers observed that under in vitro conditions 
the addition of CHX to the GIC showed favorable antibacterial 
effect against microorganisms such as Streptococcus mutans, 
Lactobacillus spp., Candida albicans and Actinomyces naeslundii, 

acts on the biofilm act on the biofilm, which begins to show less 
pathogenic composition compared to acidogenic biofilm with a 
predominance of S. mutans, which would be formed without the 
presence of the antibacterial agent3,9,11-14,23,25

Türkün  et  al.3 demonstrated that GIC and CHX at a 
concentration of 0.5% have a long-term antibacterial effect without 
compromising the physical properties of the restorative material. 
However, concentrations at 1.25 and 2% weaken the material 
by compromising its physical properties, such as resistance to 
erosion, compression, diametrical traction, flexion, setting time, 
and surface hardness3. According to Jedrychowski  et  al.7 , CHX 
digluconate increases the antibacterial activity when added to 
GIC, since it diffuses more rapidly than the cement as the latter 
is in powder form (CHX diacetate). However, this can change the 
physical and mechanical properties of the cement as the volume 
of liquid in the mixture is increased7.

The present study demonstrated that although GIC mixed 
with CHX at a concentration of 0.5% had resulted in no change 
in the area occupied by pores, the number of pores was decreased. 
This fact indicates that pores are likely to be larger at this 
concentration, which causes restorations to be more susceptible 
to failures or alterations26.

In a longitudinal study of restorations using the ART 
technique, Frencken et al.24 observed that half of the restorations 
presented failures. Of these, half of the failures were related to 
the physical properties of the cement used and its manipulation 
by the operators. The presence of pores also makes the material 
more friable26,27.

In order to minimise the effects of porosity, one can use the 
ultrasonic excitement during the initial setting of the material, 
thus decreasing number, size and amount of pores. However, the 
internal porosity of the material is not completely eliminated15.

With regard to the compressive strength, it was observed in 
the present study that different concentrations of CHX added 
to GIC did not change the results of the tests applied, thus 
corroborating studies conducted by Farret  et  al.23. However, 
Türkün et al.3 observed GIC mixed with CHX at concentrations 
of 0.5% and 2% presented significant changes in the compressive 
strength. Jedrychowski  et  al.7 demonstrated that adding CHX 

at concentrations higher than 5% had significantly affected the 
compressive strength of the GIC by decreasing it by 5%.

According to Naasan, Watson18, testing the compressive 
strength allows us to know the mechanical integrity of the 
materials, including the GICs.

CONCLUSION

The use of GIC associated with CHX gluconate 1% and 2% is 
the best option to be used in dental practice.
