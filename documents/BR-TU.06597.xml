Resumo

Nesta tese descrevemos o Vo?rtice Potiguar (VP): um meandro frontal da Subcorrente Norte do

Brasil (SNB) recentendemente identificado na costa nordeste brasileira, com nu?cleo em aproxi-

madamente 4oS e 36,5oW. O VP tem formato el??ptico com maior e menor eixos medindo 330 e

130 km, aproximadamente, intensificado em subsuperf??cie. O vo?rtice se estende verticalmente de

100 a 400 metros, com velocidades ma?ximas de 0,6 m.s?1, recirculando cerca de 2 Sv das a?guas da

SNB. Apesar da presenc?a do vo?rtice na termoclina, o fluxo em superf??cie e? para noroeste durante

todo o ano. A ana?lise da variabilidade da velocidade coletada em fundeio na Bacia Potiguar revela

dois principais modos estat??sticos de variabilidade; um com maiores amplitudes na porc?a?o da co-

luna da?gua correspondente ao VP, e um outro modo, que explica menor porcentagem da varia?ncia

da se?rie de dados original, associado a processos ligados a? camada de superf??cie. O primeiro EOF

e? associado a oscilac?o?es barocl??nicas com per??odos de 25 a 35 dias. Este sinal tambe?m e? identi-

ficado em altimetria no Atla?ntico. No?s caracterizamos esses sinais como expressa?o de ondas de

Rossby, e especulamos que o gatilho para a gerac?a?o das mesmas seria instabilidade barotro?pica

gerada pelo cisalhamento de correntes no Atla?ntico Tropical.

Adicionalmente, com o intuito de analisar o processos de gerac?a?o do VP, no?s desenvolve-

mos modelos de feic?a?o da SBN e Corrente Profunda de Contorno Oeste (CCP), para serem usados

como base para o deselvolvimento do campo inicial para simulac?o?es de modelagem nume?rica em

uma abordagem de estudo de processo dina?mico. Os Modelos de Feic?a?o, desenvolvidos a partir de

dados de velocidade, com densidade e temperatura calculados a partir da relac?a?o do vento te?rmico

e salinidade da climatologia WOA (2013), capturam os principais atributos das feic?o?es de inter-

esse com sucesso, sendo adequados para a investigac?a?o das principais caracter??sticas do campo de

correntes na Bacia Potiguar.

Dois nume?ricos experimentos foram realizados: (i) Somente SNB, com profundidade

ma?xima de 1500 m, e (ii) SNB + CCP, com profundidade ma?xima de 5500 m. O VP foi gerado em

ambos os experimentos, com velocidade ma?xima, profundidade do nu?cleo e tamanho consistentes

com observac?o?es sino?ticas. Assim, temos que o VP pode ser gerado em um campo de velocidades

contendo somente a SNB, e que o cisalhamento vertical induzido pela presenc?a da CCP parece ter

um papel importante nas caracter??sticas do mesmo (extensa?o vertical, velocidades ma?ximas, etc,

etc), uma vez que o VP teve um processo de formac?a?o diferente em cada experimento.

Abstract

In this dissertation we describe a newly discovered subsurface frontal meander of the

North Brazil Undercurrent (NBUC), centered at about 4 oS, 36.5 oW, hereafter Potiguar Eddy (PE).

The Potiguar Eddy is an elliptically-shaped eddy, with major and minor axes of approximately

330 and 130 km, with a subsurface signature. It extends vertically from 100 m to 400 m, with

maximum velocities of 0.6 m.s?1 and recirculates about 2 Sv of waters from the NBUC. Despite

the presence of the PE in subtermocline waters, the surface flow is northwestward throughout

the year. The analysis of variability of mooring velocity data in the Potiguar Bight revealed two

most important statistical modes of variability (EOFs); one with high amplitudes over most of the

portion of the water column which corresponds to the PE, and another one, explaining a lower

percentage of the variance, associated with upper-layer processes. The first EOF mode is found

to be associated with baroclinic oscillations with periods of about 25-35 days. This signal is also

seen in altimetric fields in the Atlantic Ocean. We characterize these signals as Rossby waves,

and speculate that the trigger for their generation would be barotropic instability generated by the

current shear in the Tropical Atlantic Ocean.

Aditionally, with the intent of analyzing the generation process of the PE, we developed

Feature Models of the NBUC and Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC), to be used as basis

for developing the initial field for numerical model simulations in a dynamical process-study ap-

proach. The Feature Models, developed from observed velocity data, with temperature calculated

through the thermal wind equation, and salinity from WOA (2013) climatology, successfully cap-

ture the main attributes of the features of interest, and thus are suitable for the investigation of the

main characteristics of the flow in the Potiguar Bight.

Two numerical experiments were set up; (i) a NBUC-only experiment, with maximum

depth of 1500 m, and (ii) a NBUC-DWBC experiment, with a maximum depth of 5500 m. The

Potiguar Eddy was formed in both experiments, with maximum velocity, core depth and size

consistent with synoptic observations. As a result, the PE can be generated by a velocity field con-

taining only the NBUC; and the DWBC - induced vertical shear seems to play a part on the eddy’s

characteristics (vertical extent, maximum velocities, etc), since the PE had different formation

processes in the two experiments.

Chapter 1

Introduction

This dissertation analyzes the Potiguar Eddy, a subsurface anticyclone within

the North Brazil Undercurrent domain, on the northeast coast of South America. In the

following sections, we describe the main characteristics of the current field in the area,

stressing the ones that might influence the Potiguar Eddy. In this Chapter we also state

our goals and scientific hypothesis for the present work.

1.1 Equatorial Current System

The South Equatorial Current (SEC) crosses the Atlantic Ocean zonally west-

ward, meridionally extending from about 20o S to 4o N (LUMPKIN and GARZOLI,

2005). Because of its meridional extent, the SEC is divided into three branches by Moli-

nari (1982) and four branches by Stramma and Schott (1999). Here, we will use the

division proposed by the latter authors (Figure 1.1):

• South South Equatorial Current (sSEC): The sSEC is the portion of the SEC

which extends from about 8o S to 20o S, located south of the South Equatorial

Counter Current (SECC) (LUMPKIN and GARZOLI, 2005).

• Central South Equatorial Current (cSEC): The cSEC is the portion of the SEC

located north of the SECC and south of the South Equatorial Undercurrent (SEUC),

centered at about 4o S, reaching 34±5 cm.s?1 velocities at 30o W (LUMPKIN and

GARZOLI, 2005) with a transport of about 29 Sv (SILVEIRA et al., 1994).

• Equatorial South Equatorial Current (eSEC): The eSEC is the portion of the

SEC located north of the SEUC and south of the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC),

being located along about 1-2o S (SCHOTT et al., 2003).

• North South Equatorial Current (nSEC): The nSEC, the only branch of the SEC

located on the northern hemisphere, flows north of the EUC and south of the North

Equatorial Undercurrent (NEUC). Molinari (1982) does not distinguish between

eSEC and nSEC. The nSEC has velocities of about 33 ± 11 cm.s?1 at 2o N (LUMP-

KIN and GARZOLI, 2005).

Figure 1.1: Schematic map of the currents in the upper Western Equatorial Atlantic

Ocean. Solid lines represent surface-intensified currents, and dashed lines, subsurface

currents. Shown are the South Equatorial Countercurrent (SECC), central, equatorial and

north branches of the South Equatorial Current (cSEC, eSEC and nSEC, respectively),

South Equatorial Undercurrent (SEUC), Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC), North Equato-

rial Undercurrent (NEUC), North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC), and North Brazil

Current (NBC). Based on Goes et al (2005), Stramma and Schott (1999) and Schott et al

(1998).

The currents which separate the different branches of the SEC are mostly sub-

surface currents, and so the limits of most of the SEC branches are not always very clear



3

at the surface. The nSEC and cSEC become clearly distinguishable, in the mean, only

at about 30o W, separated by an eastward velocity core of 6 ± 12 cm.s?1 at 1o S. How-

ever, this clear distinction does not happen with the other SEC branches. As a whole,

the highest westward velocities in the SEC are at the cSEC core, at 4o S, where they are

about 34±5 cm.s?1 at 30o W, linearly decreasing to about 8 cm.s?1 at 8o S, remaining ap-

proximately at this value until 20o S (LUMPKIN and GARZOLI, 2005). The distinction

between cSEC and eSEC is also not clear at the surface.

The variability of the SEC system is driven by i) resonant response to semiannual

variations in equatorial wind forcing (PHILANDER and PACANOWSKI, 1980), and ii)

annual variations in South Atlantic wind stress. The second process is important because

it connects the southern hemisphere subtropical gyre to the equatorial gyre through the

NBC. Both processes influence on the strength of the SEC branches (LUMPKIN and

GARZOLI, 2005).

The largest values of seasonal variations occur in the nSEC, which strenghtens

in boreal fall (Sep/Oct/Nov) and reverses in boreal spring (Mar/Abr/May). According

to Lumpkin and Garzoli (2005), this mode corresponds to the equilibrium response to

the annual variation of winds (PHILANDER and PACANOWSKI, 1980). Lumpkin and

Garzoli (2005) point that specifically in the western tropics, the wind stress curl reverses

in boreal spring, which forces thermocline depth changes consistent with the reversing

NECC (GARZOLI and KATZ, 1983) and nSEC (KATZ, 1981). The nSEC also has high

amplitudes of semiannual fluctuations (LUMPKIN and GARZOLI, 2005), which are a

resonant response to the semiannual component of equatorial wind forcing in the eastern

Atlantic (PHILANDER and PACANOWSKI, 1980). It is important to note that in the

mean field, the nSEC feeds into the North Brazil Current (NBC) at 0-2o N, so its reversal

during boreal spring deprives the NBC of this input (LUMPKIN and GARZOLI, 2005).

1.2 The Origins of the North Brazil Undercurrent

The sSEC reaches the Brazillian coast at approximately 10o S, according to Pe-

terson and Stramma (1991), 12-20o S, according to Stramma and Schott (1999), and ap-



4

proximately 12-14o S, on the mean, according to Lumpkin and Garzoli (2005). With the

Ekman transport removed, these authors indicate that the sSEC bifurcates further south,

at about 15-17o S. At this bifurcation, the sSEC divides into a southern branch, which is

called the Brazil Current (BC), and a northern branch, called the North Brazil Undercur-

rent (NBUC) (SILVEIRA et al., 1994).

The Rodrigues et al. (2007) numerical model results suggest that there is a

seasonal variation of the position of the bifurcation, and that this variation is related to

changes in the local wind stress curl due to annual north-south excursion the the In-

tertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). More specifically, their results show that as the

SEC bifurcation latitude moves south (north), the NBUC transport increases (decreases)

and the BC transport decreases (increases). The southernmost position of the bifurca-

tion latitude, in the first 200 m of the water column, is reached in July (? 17o S) and its

northernmost location is reached in November (? 13o S).

Even though the sSEC has surface expression, the Ekman drift in the region is

southwestward, therefore the surface expression of the NBUC is weakened. The eastern

coast of Brazil then has a subsurface-intensified boundary current, with its core located at

approximately at 100-200 m depth (SILVEIRA et al., 1994).

1.3 NBUC Characterization

At 11o S, the core of the NBUC is found at 200 m depth, with a transport of 12.3

Sv between the isopicnals 24.5 kg.m?3 (? 70m) and 26.8 kg.m?3 (? 250 m) (GOES et

al., 2005). The NBUC surface-layer transport at this latitude is less than 2.5 Sv - evidence

of its subsurface nature. From the surface down to about 1000 m, Silveira et al. (1994)

found at 10.5o S a total transport of 23.7 Sv, with a 50 cm.s?1 core somewhat shallower, at

150 m depth. The mean total NBUC transport at 11o S (from five realizations) is reported

by Schott et al. (2005) as 25.4 ± 7.4 Sv above 1100 m.

From a 4-year-long transport time series at 11o S, Schott et al. (2005) found a

2.5 Sv amplitude seasonal variation in the NBUC transport, with maximum northward

transport in July. This corroborates the numerical results of Rodrigues et al. (2007),



5

who relate the NBUC maximum transport in July to the southernmost position of the

sSEC bifurcation. Variability of the NBUC at 11oS was also investigated by Veleda et

al. (2012), who describes intraseasonal variability with periods of two-three weeks in the

alongshore velocity component measurements, consistent with Coastally Trapped Wave

theory.

There are no dramatic changes in the NBUC on its northward pathway. At about

5o S, its core is still located at the subsurface, at about 100-150 m depth, with a transport

of 19.9 Sv above 1000 m (SILVEIRA et al., 1994). At the same latitude, Schott et al.

(2002) found a 25.0 ± 4.4 Sv transport above 1100 m, with only 2.7 ± 1.8 Sv between

the surface and the 24.5 isopicnal, and 13.4± 2.7 Sv between 24.5 and 26.8 isopycnals,

which is the density range that feeds the EUC (SCHOTT et al., 1998). It is noteworthy

that Schott et al. (2002), from 5 realizations, did not find a seasonal signal at 5o S in the

NBUC transport.

The water mass structure of the NBUC at 5o S is characterized by Tropical Water,

Subtropical Underwater, South Atlantic Central Water and Antarctic Intermediate Water ,

with a transport of 26.5±3.7 Sv above 1100 m (SCHOTT et al., 2005), from 9 sections. At

the same latitude, Goes et al. (2005) found a smaller (compared to their 11o S estimate)

transport, of 12.6 Sv, between the ?0 = 24.5 kg.m?3 and ?0 = 26.8 kg.m?3 isopicnals.

However, it must be noted that these authors calculated the NBUC transport down to the

?0 = 26.8 kg.m?3 isopicnal, which at this region is located approximately at 700 m depth.

Therefore, their total transport for the NBUC is calculated in a smaller portion of the

water column than the calculations from other authors.

1.4 The cSEC and its Influence on the NBUC

As the cSEC approaches the equator, it begins to influence the transport, velocity

and core depth of the NBUC. Therefore, it becomes important to know the characteristics

of the cSEC in order to understand the effects it will have on the NBUC.

The westward cSEC flows zonally along about 4o S (LUMPKIN and GARZOLI,

2005) with a transport upper bound of 26 Sv according to Molinari (1982) and a 29 Sv



6

transport indicated by Silveira et al. (1994) at the western part of the Atlantic, where it

reaches the Brazillian coast. At 30o W, this surface-intensified current has 34±5 cm.s?1

velocities, and is separated from the nSEC by a mean eastward speed of 6±12 cm.s?1 at

1o S (LUMPKIN and GARZOLI, 2005), even though it must be noted that these authors

apparently do not differenciate the cSEC from the eSEC.

At 35o W, Schott et al. (1995) found in March, 1994 a combined cSEC and eSEC

transport of 18.6 Sv, with a surface core of 0.4 m.s?1 and a weaker subsurface core of 0.2

m.s?1, extending from the surface to about 400 m depth. On the other hand, Schott et

al. (2003) describe the mean (from 13 sections) transport associated with the cSEC and

eSEC as much smaller, of only 7 Sv between 4 and 2o S, and not clearly distinguishable

from the NBC, which they consider to flow south of 4 o S. Even though there is not a

clear distinction, the authors associate a 50 cm.s?1 surface core identified at 35o W to the

cSEC. It is noteworthy that in the study of Schott et al. (2003) the SEUC was connected

to the EUC, therefore limiting the vertical extent of the eSEC and cSEC, thus reducing its

transport, which may be the cause for such a difference between the calculated transport

from Schott et al. (2003) and from Schott et al. (1995). Both cSEC and eSEC extend

deeper than the ?0 = 24.5 kg.m?3 isopicnal, as described by Goes et al. (2005) and Schott

et al. (2003), and since the eSEC is considered to be the flow north of the SEUC and the

cSEC is defined as the flow south of SEUC, once the SEUC has no surface expression, the

combined mean flow is also over the SEUC, extending from about 2o S to 4o S (SCHOTT

et al., 2003) (Figure 1.2).

Mesoscale activity has been reported upon the arrival of the cSEC on the western

boundary. Silveira et al. (1994) found that, in May-July 1986, this current bifurcates at

about 6-5o S into two branches at 31o W. One of them (with a transport of about 14 Sv)

flows southwestward until 9.5o S and them makes a cyclonic turn and coalesces with the

NBUC, already formed by the sSEC. The other branch of the cSEC (with a transport of

about 15 Sv) flows northwestward and coalesces with the NBUC north of 5o S, where the

NBUC had already been originated by the sSEC and fed by the other branch of the cSEC.

However, only Silveira et al. (1994) identified this bifurcation, suggesting that it might be

seasonal/occasional. The superposition of the cSEC and NBUC cores was also reported



7

by, for example, Stramma et al. (1995), and the current originated by the superposition of

these two cores is then called North Brazil Current (NBC) (SCHOTT et al., 1998).

dercurrent (EUC), Equatorial intermediate Current (EIC), North Intermediate Counter-

current (NICC), upper, middle and lower North Atlantic Deep Water (uNADW, mNADW

and lNADW, respectively), and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW). Positive values indi-

cate eastward flow.

1.5 The NBUC North of 5o S

North of about 6-4o S, the NBUC receives contribution from the cSEC (SIL-

VEIRA et al., 1994; LUMPKIN and GARZOLI, 2005), which greatly increases the

NBUC transport, also being capable of originating a double-core current system. This

kind of structure was observed, for example, in March 1994 at 35o W, by Schott et al.

(1995), who found the NBUC/NBC system with a 0.6 m.s?1 core at about 150 m depth

and a surface core of about 0.3 m.s?1. The total transport for the NBUC/NBC system

in this realization was 26.2 Sv. Transport increase due to the superposition of the cSEC

and NBUC cores is large not only at the surface layer: Goes et al. (2005), for instance,

reported an increase from 12.6 Sv at 5o S to almost 17 Sv at 35o W within the ?0 = 24.5

- 26.8 kg.m?3 layer, implying that the cSEC extends deeper than the ?0 = 24.5 kg.m?3

isopicnal.

In the upper layer (surface-?0 = 24.5 kg.m?3) at 35o W, the boundary transport

is also enhanced, increasing from less than 2.5 Sv to 12.3 Sv (GOES et al., 2005). This

results in a contribution of about 14 Sv between the surface and the ?0 = 26.8 kg.m?3

isopicnal by the cSEC. In the study of Schott et al. (2003), due to the cSEC contribu-

tion, the NBC/NBUC system at 35o W transports 32.2 Sv above 1200 m depth. Sum-

ming the mean transport found by the same authors in the cSEC and eSEC (7 Sv) to the

NBC/NBUC system transport, the mean northwestward transport at 35o W south of 2o S

is 39.2 Sv above the ?1 = 32.15 kg.m?3 isopycnal, with a 60 cm.s?1 core at about 100 m

depth (SCHOTT et al., 2003).

1.6 Dissertation Hypothesis

As mentioned on the previous sections, most of the information on the NBUC

before its coalescence with the cSEC is found at approximately zonal sections at 11o S

and 5o S. Information on the horizontal synoptic structure of the NBUC, as well as its

vertical structure, is scarse between those latitudes - the only NBUC description between

11o S and 5o S is by Silveira et al. (1994). In addition, the subsurface nature of the

current prevents altimetry-based studies of the NBUC in this area. Further downstream,



9

on the region of superposition of the cSEC and NBUC cores, the information is even

more scarse. West of 35o W, the next section in which the NBUC was repeatedly studied

was 44o W, where the NBUC and cSEC are already merged and are, on the mean, not

distinguishable (SCHOTT et al., 1998). Between 35o W and 44o W the only study that

addresses the horizontal structure of the NBUC is Goes et al. (2005).

This data scarcity leaves a knowledge gap on the three dimensional synoptic

structure and time variability of the NBUC on the region between 35o W and 44o W, i. e.,

between the latitudes where the cSEC reaches the western boundary and where these two

currents are already merged. In this context, in this dissertation we describe the Potiguar

Eddy (PE), a mesoscale anticyclonic eddy identified at the Potiguar Bight, centered at

about 36.5o W, 4o S. Considering the existence of this feature, we hypothesize that

The NBUC has important mesoscale activity in the Potiguar Bight region, and this activ-

ity, on the form of meandering, is associated with the interaction of the NBUC with the

continental margin physiography and the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC).

To test this hypothesis, we describe the Potiguar Eddy based on synoptic hydro-

graphic and current data, moored current data, and global numerical model simulation

results. Besides describing the eddy through observational data, we also characterize it

through a process-oriented study approach, carrying out simulations with the Regional

Ocean Modeling System (ROMS).

1.7 Objectives

This dissertation aims to characterize the mesoscale feature referred here as Po-

tiguar Eddy as well as investigate its formation, maintenance, and recurrence processes.

To achieve this goal, we analyze hydrographic and current synoptic data, moored current

data, altimetry data, and global numerical model outputs. Furthermore, for a better un-

derstanding of the feature, we turn to idealized numerical model simulations, using the

process-study approach with the oceanic feature modeling technique.



10

Specifically, the objectives of the dissertation research are:

• to three-dimensionally characterize the PE based on hydrographic and vessel-

mounted Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler data;

• to assess the dynamical regime of the PE based on in situ synoptic data;

• to analyze moored current data and altimetry data in terms of the PE persis-

tence/recurrence and its intraseasonal variability;

• to understand the processes involved on the PE persistence/recurrence through

longer time scales (semiannual and annual variabilities) by way of an analysis on

global numerical model outputs;

• to address the importance of the vertical shear due to the interaction with the

DWBC on the dynamics of the PE through idealized experiments, by applying a

Feature Model technique in a primitive-equation numerical model.

In Chapter 2, we characterize synoptically the eddy and investigate its vertical

structure, based on data from two oceanographic cruises. In Chapter 3, the temporal

variability is analyzed, using moored and altimetry data, as well as model results. In

Chapter 4, we describe and analyze the results of numerical simulations carried out using

the process-study approach. The summary and conclusions are presented in Chapter 5.



Chapter 2

Characterization of the Potiguar Eddy

In this chapter we characterize the PE based on synoptic data collected by two

oceanographic cruises. These observations are, together with the ones described by Goes

et al. (2005), the only data available to us on the region in which the NBUC subsurface

core and the cSEC surface core are superposed but still distinguishable. In this chapter we

analyze these observations using them as basis for investigating the spatial distribution of

the ocean currents and the mesoscale activity in the region.

2.1 Data set

Two surveys of the PE region were carried out from RV Antares by the Brazil-

ian Navy, during February 26th - March 21st, 2002 (ONEI cruise) and October 26th-

December 20th, 2004 (ONEII cruise). During both surveys, Conductivity-Temperature-

Depth (CTD) data was acquired, as well as current data from a vessel-mounted Acoustic

Doppler Current Profiler (VMADCP).

The VMADCP profiling of the near-surface layer was carried out by a 75 kHz

RD-Instruments system. The ADCP was configured for 8 m - depth cells and its depth

range was about 450 m for ONEI and 300 m for ONEII, and the data were processed

using the Common Ocean Data Access System (CODAS) software. The sampling grid

differed between cruises; 8 transects were sampled during ONEI and 13 during ONEII

(Figure 2.1).

stations during ONEI (February 26th - March 21st 2002, left panel) and ONEII (Octo-

ber 26th- December 20th 2004, right panel) cruises. Light gray areas indicate regions

shallower than 60 m.

For these VMADCP sections, due to instrument noise, objective analysis was

performed on the velocity data, considering a correlation function of the form 2.1:

C(x,z) = (1 ? ?2)e
(
?( xLx )

2
?( zLz )

2
)

(2.1)

where ? is the data random error variance, and Lx and Lz are the correlation lengthscales

in x (cross-shore) and z (vertical) directions, respectively (SILVEIRA et al., 1994).

Specifically for the case of the velocity sections, considering the anisotropy be-

tween the vertical and the horizontal cross-shore axes, the possibility of choosing different

correlation legthscales for different axes is crucial. Here we use values of 100 km and 50

m on the x- and z-axis, respectively. The squared variance of the error considered is 0.02.

We also use objective analysis to perform extrapolation between the first velocity profile

acquired and the coast, applying a no-slip boundary condition at the bottom.

Besides the VMADCP data, hydrographic data were collected by a Sea Bird

Electronics 9 plus CTD with a sampling frequency of 24 Hz, temperature accuracy es-



13

timated at ± 0.001 oC, and salinity accuracy, at ± 0.001. During both cruises a series

of CTD profiles were sampled at the locations indicated by the black dots in Figure 2.1.

The CTD data were processed using the Sea Bird Electronics software. Horizontal dis-

tributions of temperature, salinity and potential density were obtained through objective

mapping with an assumed isotropy of a correlation function of the same form as the one

presented in Equation 2.1 with the y-coordinate substituting the z-coordinate.

Due to the depth reach of the equipment, the water column below ? 300-450 m

was not sampled by the VMADCP. We then use the CTD data in order to estimate the

velocities in a larger portion of the water column, using the geostrophic aproximation.

The geostrophic aproximation assumes that the flow is steady, friction is neg-

ligible, vertical velocities are negligible (i. e., hydrostatic approximation), and the ratio

between the advective and coriolis acceleration (i. e., the Rossby number) is much smaller

than one. These characteristics are typical of regions of open ocean, far from the surface

and bottom boundary layers. This relation is mathematically expressed by Equation 2.2.

u = ?
1

f

???

?y
; v =

1

f

???

?x
(2.2)

where u is the cross-shore velocity; v is the alongshore velocity; f is the coriolis acceler-

ation; and ?? is the geopotential anomaly inferred from hydrographic data.

Considering the limitations of the geostrophic approximation, mainly that the

Rossby number should be smaller than one, and the proximity between the equator and

the study region, we make an assessment of the validity of the geostrophic aproximation

for this study through computations of the Rossby number from the observed data, prior

to the computation of the geostrophic velocity sections. We also compare the calculated

geostrophic velocities and the VMADCP velocities.

For the computation of the geostrophic velocities, we follow Stramma (1991)

and Stramma et al. (2005) level of no motion of ?1 = 32.15 kg.m?3. The resulting

geostrophic sections were then regridded using objective analysis (Equation 2.1), with

correlation lengthscales on the x- and z-axes of 300 km and 70 m, respectively, and error

squared variance of 0.1. After regridding, the geostrophic velocities were extrapolated up

to the coast and a no-slip boundary condition was enforced. For this procedure, 80 km



14

and 10 m lengthscales were used for the x- and z-axis, respectively. The velocity sections,

observed as well as geostrophic, allow the investigation of the vertical extent of the eddy.

In order to investigate the horizontal patterns of flow, the ADCP-derived stream-

function distribution was calculated for all levels in which ADCP data was acquired. For

the mapping, we employ the so-called direct objective mapping, as described by Brether-

ton et al. (1976) and later successfully applied by Silveira et al. (2000) to the NBC

retroflection region (5?-8?N). This technique uses the kinematic relationship between hor-

izontal velocities and streamfunction to derive a correlation function for the latter quantity

once the correlation function of the former quantities are known from the observations.

We closely follow Silveira et al. (2000) by assuming an isotropic streamfunction correla-

tion function with lengthscale of 125 km for both the x and y directions. The squared vari-

ance of the error considered was 0.2678. The streamfunction mapping reveals mesoscale

spatial patterns that aid the interpretation of the information from the velocity sections.

2.2 Results

We start our analyses with the description of the horizontal distribution of the

hydrographic variables collected during ONEI and ONEII cruises. Then we analyze the

horizontal ADCP-derived streamfunction distribution for both cruises, at the near-surface

and at the depth of the highest PE velocities, i. e., ? 150 m. We then turn to the ADCP

velocity sections to aid our understanding of the circulation in the area, specifically the

Potiguar Bight. Considering the limited ADCP depth reach, in order to have a better

understanding of the circulation on a larger portion of the water column, we apply the

Classical Dynamic Method to obtain geostrophic velocities from the surface down to

about 1500-1800 m. That is done after an assessment of the dynamical regime of the PE

is made, to assure that the geostrophic aproximation is reasonable in the area.

The near-surface temperature distribution for ONEI as well as for ONEII cruise

(Figures 2.2 and 2.3, left panels) does not show a clear pattern that can be associated with

the circulation in the area. During ONEI, the highest values of about 28.4 oC occur on the

southern portion of the domain, around 8oS. During ONEII the near-surface water is not

as warm as during ONEI, presenting maximum values of about 27.5 oC on the northern

portion of the domain. At 144 m (Figures 2.2 and 2.3, right panels), the temperature

fields present much greater gradients than at the near-surface. On both cruises, the highest

temperatures are found on the southern portion of the sampling grid, and a patch of higher

temperature values is seen along the coast on the NBUC domain, suggesting that these

high temperature values are advected northward by the NBUC. The lowest temperature

values are found, in both instances, on the northeastern portion of the domain. Also,

during ONEI the temperature at the near-surface layer is higher, and at the 144 m level

it is lower than during ONEII. Therefore, the water column had stronger stratification

during ONEI (February-March).

The near-surface salinity fields for ONEI and ONEII (Figures 2.4 and 2.5, left

panels) show the highest salinity values on the southern portion of the sampling grid, and a

patch of relatively high salinity values along the coast, on the NBUC domain. The lowest

salinity values, on the other hand, are located, on both instances, on the north/northeastern

portion of the sampling grid for each cruise. It is interesting to notice that the near-surface



16

salinity distribution for ONEI shows much larger gradients than during ONEII. On 144

m (Figures 2.4 and 2.5, right panels), the gradients do not differ as much between the

cruises; the salinity values during ONEI and ONEII are approximately within the same

range. As at the near-surface, the higest values are located on the southern portion of the

sampling grid as well as close to the coast, on the NBUC domain. The highest gradients

are found on the offshore side of the NBUC, between 5oS and 10oS.

18

The potential density near-surface distribution (Figures 2.6 and 2.7, left panels)

is quite different between the ONEI and ONEII cruises. During ONEI, larger gradients are

found, since the potential density presents a much wider range of values when compared

to ONEII. In general, for both cruises the higher potential density values occured along

the coast and close to the southern portion of the domain, while the lowest values are

present on the northeastern portion of the sampling grid. At 144 m depth (Figures 2.6 and

2.7, right panels), the distributions for both cruises are more alike; the lowest potential

density values are located on the southern portion of the sampling grid and they follow

the path of the NBUC northward, as the sSEC low density waters are transported by the

NBUC. The highest potential density values are located on the same area where the lower

temperature and salinity values occur, i. e., the northeast corner, around 5oS - 3oS.

Therefore, from the hydrografic fields for both cruises, we can see that the sSEC

signature (high temperature, high salinity, low potential density) is transported northward

along the coast by the NBUC. Also, the subsurface nature of the NBUC caused these

signatures not to be very distinguishable, or not visible at all, at the near-surface. It is

also noteworthy that the Potiguar eddy, in spite of being present in the area, has a subtile

signature on the temperature, salinity of potential density fields relative to the NBUC but

contrasts importantly with the lower-density surface-intensified inpinging cSEC.

19

Figure 2.7: Potential density and ADCP velocity vectors at 32 m (left panel) and 144 m

(right panel) during ONEII. Light gray areas indicate regions shallower than 60 m.

After analyzing the hydrographic properties, we turn to the horizontal distribu-

tions of the ADCP-derived streamfunction. The near-surface streamfunction distribution

for both cruises (Figures 2.8 and 2.9, left panels) depict the cSEC impinging on the north-

eastern tip of South America. The expression of the NBUC is either very weak or absent,

due to the subsurface nature of its core. Suggestions of a recirculation, especially on the

northern part of the domain, which might be associated with the retroflection that origi-

nates the EUC, are identified. Also, a cyclonic turn of the cSEC, in agreement with the

one observed on the study of Silveira et al. (1994), is seen during ONEI (Figure 2.8, left

panel). Other than that, suggestions of a few weaker recirculations on the domain are

identified.

At ? 150 m (Figures 2.8 and 2.9, right panels), the streamfuncion distribution

changes dramatically. The path of the NBUC, following the coast of Brazil in its path

northward, is clearly identified in both instances. Also, the PE, as an anticyclonic re-

circulation confined between the coast and the NBUC, is observed during ONEII, and

suggestions of its existence are seen on the distribution for the ONEI period. This ellipse-

shaped eddy is centered at approximately 4o S, 36o 30’ W, with major axis parallel to the

coast. We estimate from the streamfunction maps the minor and major axis of the PE

to be 136 km and 330 km, respectively. To perform this calculation we considered the



20

outermost closed streamline, with a value of -4.104 m2s?1, as the limit of the eddy.

2.2.1 VMADCP Vertical Sections

After analyzing the horizontal circulation patterns, we turn to ADCP-acquired

velocity sections in order to characterize three-dimensionally the flow on the study area.

On the velocity sections from ONEI (Figures 2.10-2.12), the NBUC is clearly identified,

with intense velocities of about 1.1 m.s?1 at the subsurface. The depth of the NBUC core

varies between 250 m on section 1 and 100 m on section 8, with a general tendency of

shoaling on the downstream direction, as expected (SILVEIRA et al., 1994; SCHOTT et

al., 1998). Even though the NBUC signature is very clear at the nearshore portion of the

sections, the flow on the offshore portion does not present a clear pattern, specially for the

sections 1-5 (Figures 2.10 -2.11). The flow on the eastern part of these sections is much

weaker than on the western part, and there is no clear correspondence between the flow on

the eastern part of different sections. Section 2, in particular (Figure 2.10, middle panel),

shows a structure that may be interpreted as an anticyclonic eddy, with a core beyond the

depth reach of the ADCP and similar velocity magnitudes in both positive and negative

velocity cores. It is likely, by the latitude of this feature, that it is part of a DWBC deep

eddy as described by Dengler et al. (2004). However, there is no sign of this structure on

sections 1 or 3.

Further downstream, sections 6-8 (Figures 2.11 - 2.12) present a quite different

pattern from the previous sections. Sections 6 and 7, which show the NBUC going around

the Calcanhar Cape at the northeastern tip of Brazil, show a consistent 0.4 m.s?1 south-

eastward/eastward velocity core at the offshore part of the section, at 200-250 m depth,

which corresponds to the subpycnocline retroflection of the NBUC to form the SEUC.

Section 8 is a unique section in the sense that the NBUC is detached from the coast. This

is the only ONEI section in which there is actually an eastward flow near the coast in-

stead of westward. The NBUC then, located at about 120 km from the coast, spreads

over a much larger horizontal area then on previous sections. Also, its core is consider-

ably closer to the surface than on previous sections, as well as stronger, with velocities of

about 1.3 m.s?1. The shoaling of the core and the intensification of the current are both

due to the presence, in this region, of the central branch of the South Equatorial Current.

Also noteworthy is the downstream strenghtening of the surface expression of the NBUC:



22

on section 1 (Figure 2.10, top panel) the NBUC surface velocities are about 0.2 m.s?1

in contrast to section 7, where the surface velocities reach about 1 m.s?1, decreasing to

about 0.6 m.s?1 on section 8. Table 2.1 presents the transports for the NBUC and PE for

all the transects.

During the ONEII cruise, the depth reach of ? 300 m of the ADCP equipment

was considerably shallower than during ONEI (450 m). As a consequence, inferences

about the NBUC vertical structure could not be made for the isopycnal interior of ?0 =

24.5 - 26.8 kg.m?3. The NBUC during ONEII (Figures 2.13-2.17) has roughly the same

strength as during the ONEI cruise, with the core velocity ranging between 0.7 m.s?1 and

1.2 m.s?1. As done for the sections from ONEI cruise, for ONEII cruise we will separate

the sections for analysis purposes.

Over sections 1-5 (Figures 2.13 - 2.15), the NBUC is attached to the coast, with

its core at aproximately 200 m depth, with similar magnitudes to the ones during ONEI

(? 0.6 - 1 m.s?1). The eastern part of the sections presented velocities even weaker than

those during ONEI, and a flow pattern is not identifiable.

are plotted. Shaded areas indicate regions where the percent good from the ADCP data

was lower than 50.



28

On sections 6 and 7 (Figure 2.15), the NBUC has a stronger core than on previous

sections, presenting velocities of about 1.1-1.2 m.s?1. This suggests that, since section

6 is located at about 5o S, the contribution from the cSEC is responsible for the NBUC

intensification. However, no significant change on the depth of the core can be identified;

on the other hand, the NBUC surface expression (0.4 m.s?1) becomes stronger when

compared to upstream sections (?0.2 m.s?1). On the eastern portion of the sections,

the east/southeastward core associated to the SEUC formation is observed, stronger (0.5

m.s?1) on section 6. On both sections 6 and 7 this core is present at about 200 m depth.

The fact that the NBUC suffers dramatic changes as it passes Cape Calcanhar is

noticeable when comparing sections 8-10 (Figures 2.15 - 2.17) with upstream sections.

Sections 8-10 are on the domain of the Potiguar Eddy, therefore their main characteristic is

that the NBUC is detached from the coast and there is an eastward/southeastward velocity

core close to the continental slope, associated with the nearshore lobe of the Eddy. The

eastward flow observed has maximum velocities of about 0.4-0.6 m.s?1, at about 170 m

depth, with the exception of section 8, in which it has a second core that reaches the

surface. As mentioned, on these sections the NBUC is detached from the continental

slope, being located at about 150 km from the coast on sections 8 and 9, and closer (?50

km) to the coast on section 10.

isopycnals are plotted. Shaded areas indicate regions where the percent good from the

ADCP data was lower than 50.



30

On sections 11-13 (Figures 2.17), the NBUC goes back to being attached to

the slope, but with a larger horizontal extent, reaching up to about 200 km from the

coast. Another noticeable change on the NBUC is the increasingly higher velocity at the

surface, which culminate on section 13 (approximately at 40o W) in which two cores are

observed: a subsurface one, associated to the NBUC, and a surface one, associated with

the cSEC and eSEC. This surface northwestward expression can reach about 0.8 m.s?1

on the portion closest to the coast. However, no significant change in depth is seen on

the subsurface core, which is still found at about 120-150 m depth. Table 2.1 presents the

transports for the NBUC and PE for all the transects.

2.2.2 The Rossby and Burger Numbers

Even though the streamfunction maps and the velocity sections help us charac-

terize the NBUC, the finite ADCP reach limits the description of the vertical extent of

the currents as well as of the PE. In order to estimate the velocities on a larger part of

the water column for investigation of the PE vertical structure and water mass transport,

we use the classical dynamic method. However, due to the proximity to the equator, we

first make an assessment of the validity of the geostrophic aproximation for the Potiguar

Bight. As part of this assessment, we calculate the Rossby number of the PE by getting

the mean magnitude of the velocity on a ring of the Potiguar eddy with mean width of

70 km, using the -4 × 104 m2s?1 streamline as outer limit. Then, we divide by the value

of the Coriolis parameter on the area multiplied by the mean distance between the corre-

spondent streamline and the eddy core, i. e., its radius (Equation 2.3). The values used on

the Rossby number calculation are presented on Table 2.2.

Ro =
U

foR
(2.3)

where U is the mean velocity magnitude between two closed streamlines; fo is the Coriolis

parameter at the eddy center; and R is the mean radius of the Potiguar Eddy.

Figure 2.18 shows the area used for the calculation of the Rossby number on the

assessment of the validity of the geostrophic aproximation for the Potiguar Bight. As a

result, we got a mean Rossby number of ? 0.4 for the eddy core depth and of ? 0.22



31

if averaged over the eddy thickness of 250 m (i.e., averaged over H, which is the mean

thickness between the 24.5-26.8 kg.m?3 isopycnal interval).

Figure 2.18: Map with the ADCP-derived velocity vectors at 150 m for ONEII cruise

(October - December 2004). The area used for the Rossby number calculation is in blue.

Besides the Rossby number, in order to evaluate the role of stratification on the

maintainance of the PE, the Burger number was calculated, according to Equation 2.4,

with the values presented on Table 2.2. The Burger number was calculated with informa-

tion from three hydrographic sections that were sampled within the eddy (sections 8, 9

and 10, Figure 2.1, right panel) during ONEII. The mean Burger number for the PE sam-

pled during ONEII is approximately 1. Therefore, we conclude that the stratification is as

important as the horizontal velocity shear on the maintainance of the PE, characterizing

the PE as a typical mesoscale structure of the tropical-equatorial region.

2.2.3 Geostrophic Fields in the PE Region

As the magnitude of the H-averaged Rossby number indicates, there is reason-

able agreement between the geostrophic (considering the isopycnal ?1 = 32.15 kg.m?3

as reference) and ADCP velocity (Figures 2.19 and 2.20) despite the near-equatorial lo-

cation of the study area. The general pattern from the ADCP sections is well represented

in the geostrophic velocities, even though the geostrophic NBUC is weaker and closer to

the shore in both sections. The weaker NBUC reflects in smaller transports in geostrophic

sections when compared to the ADCP data. In ONEI Section 8, the geostrophic NBUC

transports 18.56 Sv, in comparison to 26.39 from ADCP data. The geostrophic eddy,

on the other hand, is stronger than the one shown in ADCP data, transporting 1.74 Sv,

compared to 0.92 Sv. On ONEII Section 9, the geostrophic NBUC transports 22.49 Sv in

contrast to 26.91 shown in ADCP data. The geostrophic eddy in this instance is somewhat

weaker than shown in ADCP data, transporting about 1.61 Sv compared to 2.37 Sv from

ADCP data. All these transport values were calculated between the surface and 300 m

depth, in order to compare the geostrophic and ADCP velocity fields. We consider the

agreement reasonable, so we analyze the geostrophic velocities down to 1500 m (ONEI)

and 1800 m (ONEII), beyond the ADCP reach.

35

The geostrophic velocity sections (Figures 2.19 and 2.20, middle and bottom

panels) show the NBUC reaching 800 and 1100 m in ONEI and ONEII, respectively,

considering the 0.1 m.s?1 isotach as the limit of the current. In both sections the NBUC

transports Tropical Water (TW), South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) and Antarctic

Intermediate Water (AIA). The NBUC transport varies between sections: on ONEI it is

24.78 Sv (7.5 Sv AT, 10.35 Sv SACW, 6.95 Sv AIA) and during ONEII it increases to

43.35 Sv (7.8 Sv AT, 15.06 Sv SACW, 20.47 Sv AIA). So the large difference in transport

is mostly due to an increase of the transport in the AIA layer during ONEII. The difference

between the transport calculated from ADCP velocities (between the surface and 300 m,

therefore not accounting for any transport in the AIA range) between both cruises is not

nearly as large; only about 0.5 Sv.

In both sections the eddy has no surface signature, with the velocity transition

from the northwestward surface flow to the southeastward subsurface flow at about 80-

100 m. The eddy is confined between the coast and 40 km off the coast, and in both

geostrophic sections it appears with two cores; one closer to the surface, at about 100-200

m, and another at about 350 m. In addition, on the ONEI geostrophic velocity section

8 a possible third core of the eddy can be identified at approximately 550 m. The trans-

port of the eddy is 1.97 Sv and 2.07 Sv during ONEI and ONEII, respectively, mostly

made of SACW (approximately 1.7 Sv) with a smaller amount of water in the AIA layer

(approximately 0.7 Sv).

2.3 Discussion

The Western Equatorial Atlantic has been a region of great interest of the oceano-

graphic community due to its importance in the Interhemispheric heat and mass transport.

With the intent of investigating the role of this region on the Conveyor belt, most studies

focus either on the northeast coast of South America, or in an equatorial section along

44oW (SILVEIRA et al., 1994; STRAMMA et al., 1995; SCHOTT et al., 1995; FIS-

CHER and SCHOTT, 1997; SCHOTT et al., 1998; SCHOTT et al., 2002; SCHOTT et

al., 2003; SCHOTT et al., 2005; GOES et al., 2005; RICHARDSON and FRATANTONI,

1999). The flow south of the equator, specifically, was mostly investigated with repeated

zonal sections at 10oS and 5oS, and a meridional section at 35oW, preventing the detailed

analysis of mesoscale horizontal structures in this region. The only study that focuses on

mesoscale features between 5o and 10oS is the study of Silveira et al. (1994), in which

the fine sampling grid allowed the authors to identify the previously unknown subsurface

character of the NBC in its formation area, as well as other mesoscale features such as

the retroflection to generate the SEUC. With a finer sampling grid than most of the previ-

ous studies in the region, in this dissertation we were able to identify the changes on the

NBUC regime that take place as this current flows equatorward.

The analysis of the data-set between 11o S and 6oS showed the NBUC with

its core at approximately 200 m, presenting no shoaling in the downstream direction.

During ONEI cruise the core was slightly (? 50 m) deeper and the near-surface velocities

stronger, yielding a larger transport of the NBUC on this realization. This seems to be

related to the seasonal variation of the winds over the Equatorial Atlantic. With weaker

winds during February, the Ekman transport during ONEI was weaker, allowing for the

near-surface northward velocities to be stronger. In both cruises, the NBUC core was

attached to the continental slope. Our results corroborate previous studies (SILVEIRA et

al., 1994; GOES et al., 2005; STRAMMA et al., 1995; SCHOTT et al., 2002; SCHOTT

et al., 2005). Also, the near-surface ADCP-derived streamfunction maps for this region

for the ONEI cruise (February-March, 2002), show a bifurcation of the cSEC, with one

branch going south and then making a cyclonic turn to feed into the NBUC; this is very

similar to the observed by Silveira et al. (1994), whose data acquisition months (May-



37

July) were similar to the ONEI cruise (February-March). The presence of this cyclonic

turn in ONEI cruise and during Silveira et al. (1994)’s cruise may indicate a seasonality of

this feature. During ONEII cruise, which took place in October-December, this cyclonic

turn of the cSEC was not identified.

Between 6o and 4oS, we identified significant changes in the NBUC regime, as

it receives large contribution from the cSEC (SILVEIRA et al., 1994; LUMPKIN and

GARZOLI, 2005), increasing its transport. Another difference between the flow in this

region and the upstream NBUC is the flow in its opposite direction, with a core of ?

0.4 m.s?1 at 200-250 m depth, at approximately 160 km off the coast. The analysis

of streamfunction and velocity maps for both cruises at 144 m indicate that this flow

corresponds to the SEUC, being fed into by a retroflection of the NBUC, as also indicated

by Silveira et al. (1994) and Stramma et al. (1995).

North of 4oS, one of the main studies on synoptical horizontal distribution of

ocean currents is from Goes et al. (2005). These authors use ADCP, CTDO2, and XBT

data to analyze the source waters of the currents in the region and identify their pathways

close to the Equator. They also calculate the streamfunction distribution for the flow in

the area between 35oW and 44oW, but were not able to describe in detail the circulation

in the region of the Potiguar Bight due to the lack of data in this area. The finer resolution

of the sampling grid of the data-set analyzed in this dissertation allowed a more thorough

investigation of the mesoscale structures on the northeastern coast of South America,

specially in the region between 36oW and 37oW, where we found that the NBUC presents

a particular and previously undescribed behavior.

This region, as we found in this dissertation, is unique in the sense that the NBUC

is not attached to the coast, but located at about 150 km from it. The NBUC core in these

sections has strong velocities of about 0.8-1.3 m.s?1, at 100-150 m depth, with a near-

surface (32 m) signature of 0.4-0.6 m.s?1. Attached to the coast is a 0.3-0.6 m.s?1 core

of southeastward velocities, at approximately 150-200 m depth, which, after analysis of

streamfunction maps, we found to be a recirculation of the NBUC, which we named

Potiguar Eddy (PE). This feature had not been described by any of the previous studies in

the area; specifically, the study from Goes et al. (2005) lacked enough data to analyze in



38

detail the ocean currents in this region.

The PE is an elliptical shaped eddy, with major and minor axes of approximately

330 and 130 km, with a subsurface signature. It is centered at about 36oW, 4oS, and ex-

tends from 100 m to 400 m, with maximum velocities of 0.6 m.s?1, recirculating about 2

Sv of the water from the NBUC. The subsurface nature of this feature is not something un-

precedent in the Western Equatorial Atlantic. Subsurface-intensified rings with no surface

signature have been reported to pinch off the NBC retroflection, further north of our study

area, and translate northwestward (GARRAFFO et al., 2003). Johns et al. (2003), specifi-

cally, report a NBC retroflection ring with characteristics that resemble the PE. Their ”ring

1” was identified at ? 8oN with maximum velocities at approximately 150 m, extending

vertically from 50-100 m to about 400 m. This eddy, as the PE, was assymetric, with a

stronger and deeper-reaching nortwestward velocities lobe when compared to the south-

eastward velocities one, with both lobes with velocities comparable to the ones present in

the PE. This feature has a ? 200 km diameter, which also makes it comparable to the PE,

even though their process of generation clearly differ. As the PE, Johns et al. (2003)’s

ring 1 had no signature in altimetry data. The lack of altimetry signature is probably one

of the main reasons why subsurface-intensified NBC rings as well as the PE remained un-

detected for so long. After the estimation of its Rossby and Burger numbers, we reach the

conclusion that, as expected, this is a typical mesoscale feature of the Western Equatorial

Atlantic, with reasonable correspondence between geostrophic velocities within the eddy

and global numerical model outputs due to a dominant geostrophic balance. As a matter

of fact, the upper-bound Rossby number value of about 0.4 is comparable with the 0.36

estimated by Silveira et al. (2000) for the NBC retroflection deep eddies at 5oN. These

authors used quasi-geostrophic theory to investigate the anticiclone dynamics. Moreover,

if the PE depth-average Rossby number is considered, the value of 0.22 is very typical

from the supbtropical western boundary currents at temperate latitudes. As examples, the

Brazil Current semi-permanent anticiclones off the Eastern Brazilian continental margin,

presented by Soutelino et al. (2013) at 15oS-20oS have Ro of about 0.20.

Further downstream, between 38oW and 41oW, the southeastward flow from PE

is not detected close to the coast; instead, the NBUC is again attached to the continental



39

slope. The surface expression of the NBUC, in this case caused by the contribution from

the cSEC, increases, reaching 0.7 m.s?1 at 41oW. The NBUC on these sections occupy

a much larger portion of the water column, with a width of about 200 km compared to

aproximately 100 km on the previous transects. There is not a clear surface core; the

NBUC core is still located at about 150 m depth. Only in 41oW there seems to be a

surface core being formed, which is in agreement with Schott et al. (1998), who indicate

that the NBUC/cSEC turns into the surface-intensified NBC only at 44oW.

Aditionally, at about 1oS, between 37oW - 39oW, a flow in the opposite direction

of the NBUC is identified. This flow increases in velocity northwestward, reaching maxi-

mum velocities of 0.6 m.s?1 at about 39oW. The analysis of streamfunction maps indicate

that this flow corresponds to the retroflected thermocline portion of the NBUC to form

the Equatorial undercurrent, corroborating the study of Goes et al. (2005); Schott et al.

(1998); Urbano et al. (2008).

This chapter presented the characteristics and changes of the NBUC along its

path equatorward, and some features associated with this current, such as the retroflec-

tions to feed into the EUC and SEUC. The NBUC main characteristics, such as transport,

core depth, and width are in agreement with previous studies, as well as the location,

transport and depth of the two mentioned retroflections. Here we stress the identification

of the Potiguar Eddy, due to the fact that it had not been yet described in the scientific

literature. On this chapter we were only able to provide evidence of its existence from

two oceanographic cruises; on the next, we will adress its permanence/recurrence and

temporal variability.

Chapter 3

Temporal Variability

After characterizing the eddy, a few questions remain unanswered. We can esti-

mate the transport and the water masses transported by the PE observed in oceanographic

cruises, but is that feature permanent in the Potiguar Bight? The evidence of its existence

in both cruises suggests so, but the analyses of current meter time series are necessary for

making definitive statements. In this section we use moored and altimetry data, as well as

numerical model outputs, in order to investigate whether the PE is stationary or recurrent,

as well as address the intraseasonal variability that the PE may present.

3.1 Data sets

3.1.1 Mooring Data

Data from two moorings, hereafter Potiguar Basin 1 (PBM1) and Potiguar Basin

2 (PBM2), from PETRO?LEO BRASILEIRO S.A., were analyzed in terms of the vertical

structure of the Potiguar Eddy as well as its time-dependent behavior. The two moorings

were deployed on the continental slope of the Potiguar Bight, and the detailed information

about period of data acquisition, sampling frequency, instruments used, and other details

are presented on the following paragraphs.

The PBM1 mooring had upward-looking 75kHz Teledyne RD-Instruments ADCP

and Aquadopp instruments. It was deployed approximately over the 1000 m isobath at

4.2o S, 37.2o W (Figure 3.1), with ADCP data from the near-surface (44 m) down to 444

41



42

m, with 10-meter cells. At 800 and 995 m, hourly currents were measured by Aquadopp

current meters. All instruments were set to acquire velocity data hourly. This mooring

was deployed on April 6th, 2008 and retrieved on April 12th, 2009, and had three cam-

paigns for data recovery and redeployment. Due to instrument failure, the dataset could

only be used until November 8th, 2008.

Mooring PBM2 also had upward-looking 75kHz Teledyne RD-Instruments ADCP

and Aquadopp instruments, and was deployed close to mooring PBM1, approximately

over the 2000 m isobath at 3.9o S, 37o W (Figure 3.1). Velocity data were acquired by an

ADCP system from the near-surface (35 m) down to 365 m, with 10-meter cells. Further

downward, velocity data at 800, 1200, 1600, and 1995 m were acquired by Aquadopp

current meters, with all instruments set to acquire velocity data hourly.

The PBM2 mooring was deployed and retrieved on the same dates as mooring

PBM1 (April 6th, 2008 - April 12th, 2009), also with three campaigns for data recovery

and redeployment. There was no instrument failure in PBM2, therefore the dataset could

be used in its entire extent. The site of the deployment of both moorings is close to

ONEII section 9, as shown on Figure 3.1. It is noteworthy that both moorings are located

on the area that the ADCP sections indicate as the nearshore lobe of the PE, therefore the

mooring-acquired velocities are southeastward over the vertical extent of the eddy.

for 44 m (blue) and 144 m (red).

3.1.2 Numerical Model Outputs

Considering the coarse oceanographic cruise data and the small time span of the

mooring data, we use the outputs of a global model to address the longer variability and

persistence of the Potiguar Eddy. We analyze 8 years of results from a Hybrid Coordinate

Ocean Model (HYCOM) assimilative run, carried out by the HYCOM Consortium with

results available on the web (HYCOM, 2014). This run has a 1/12o horizontal resolution,

which translates to a 8 km spacing near the equator, and is configured vertically for 32

hybrid layers. The surface forcing is from the Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Pre-

diction System (NOGAPS) including wind stress, wind speed, heat flux and precipitation.

The data assimilation scheme used is the Navy Coupled Ocean Data Assimilation

(NCODA) system (CUMMINGS, 2005), which assimilates alongtrack satellite altimeter

observations, satellite and in-situ Sea Surface Temperature, as well as temperature and

salinity profiles from expendable bathythermographs (XBTs), ARGO floats and moored

buoys. The downward projection of the surface information is made using Cooper and

Haines (1996) scheme. A total of 8 years (Nov/2003-December/2011) of daily temper-

ature, salinity, altimetry, zonal and meridional velocity model results were analyzed, on

the Potiguar Bight (35o W - 38o W; 6o S, 3o S, and on a zonal section at 4o S.

3.1.3 Altimetry Data

In order to characterize the variability found in mooring velocities, we turn to

satellite sea level anomaly data. The altimetry data that we use are merged dual-satellite

anomalies referenced to the 1993-2012 period from the Archiving, Validation and Inter-

pretation of Satellite Oceanographic Data (AVISO). The product that we used is level

4, delayed-time, with a 0.25 degree zonal and meridional resolution, part of project

SSALTO/Duacs (AVISO, 2014). We use altimetry data over the 4o S latitude, over the

entire Atlantic Ocean, between January 1st, 2003 and December 31st, 2009. The 4o S

section was chosen in order to investigate processes that could be originated in the At-

lantic Ocean, propagate westward, and reach the locations of the moorings, which are

approximately at 4o S. The time span was chosen to include the time-period of the HY-

COM numerical model results, ONEII cruise synoptic data, and mooring data.

3.2 Observed Intraseasonal Variability

3.2.1 Current meter mooring mean patterns

The velocity vectors of the mooring acquired data were rotated (65 degrees anti-

clockwise) into alongshore and crossshore components, conventioned that the southeast-

ward velocities are positive. The rotated mean profiles for moorings PBM1 and PBM2

(Figures 3.2 and 3.3, respectively) show the mean magnitude of the NBUC and the PE.

As can be seen in Figure 3.2, right panel, the PE is present on the southeastward

mean moored velocity profile, extends from about 60 m to 264 m on PBM1, with its 0.46

m.s?1 core located at 144 m depth. On PBM2 (Figure 3.3, right panel), further offshore,

the PE is also identified on the mean profile, occupying a larger portion of the water

column and extending from 100 m to 430 m, with a deeper and weaker 0.32 m.s?1 core

at 200 m depth. Below the PE, westward/northwestward mean velocities are observed,

stronger on PBM1 (? 0.2 m.s?1) than on PBM2 (? 0.15 m.s?1). The (northwestward)

mean surface flow, on the other hand, is stronger on PBM2 (0.45 m.s?1) than on PBM1

(0.2 m.s?1).

Figure 3.2: Mean cross-shore (left) and alongshore (right) profiles for mooring PBM1. Positive

values of cross-shore (alongshore) velocity indicate northeastward (southeastward) flow.



45

Figure 3.3: Mean cross-shore (left) and alongshore (right) profiles for mooring PBM2.

Positive values of cross-shore (alongshore) velocity indicate northeastward (southeast-

ward) flow.

Comparing the mean velocity profile of PBM1 (Figure 3.2) and ONEII section 9

(Figure 2.16), it is noticeable the resemblance between the mean profile from the mooring

line and the nearshore portion of the ONEII velocity section. In both the velocity inversion

associated with the upper limit of the eddy is at about 50-100 m, and in both the core of

the PE is at about 150 m depth. The signature of the PE on the mean alongshore velocity

profiles for both moorings strongly suggest that this is a permanent feature in the area.

3.2.2 Current Meter Mooring Time Series Analysis

In order to investigate the variability of the system, we performed Empirical

Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis on the alongshore velocity data of both moorings.

After the EOF analysis of the data, we followed Preisendorfer (1988) and used Montecarlo

simulations in order to assure which EOF modes are significant at the 95% confidence

level.

For PBM1, we found four statistically significant modes of variability (Figure

3.4), explaining 60%, 16%, 8%, and 5% of the variance of the original series. For PBM2



46

data, on the other hand, 5 statistically significant modes were found (Figure 3.5), sug-

gesting that more processes take place on mooring PBM2, therefore that the variability

pattern is more complex at this location.

We focus on the two modes that have the highest explained variance percentage,

i. e., the first and second EOF modes. Since the vertical structure for the first two modes

of the moorings is similar, we describe them together.

Figure 3.4: Explained variance of each statistical mode calculated from the observed

PBM1 data and from a random time-series. The thick black line represents the explained

variance for each statistical mode for the observed mooring; the thin black line represents

the mean explained variance for the statistical modes of a random time-series (Montecarlo

simulations). The dashed lines represent the interval of two standard deviations about the

mean.

On the vertical structure of the first EOF for PBM1 (Figure 3.6), the highest

amplitude is located at the part of the water column corresponding to the lower half of

the eddy, with peak amplitude at about 270 m depth. On the remaining of the water

column, the amplitude decreases considerably, reaching values very close to zero close to

the surface and at the bottom.

The vertical structure of the first EOF for PBM2, explaining 37% of the variance

of the original time-series, is shown on Figure 3.7. It presents high values over the water



47

column corresponding to the lower half of the mean PE (compare Figures 3.7 and 3.3,

right panel) , with highest values at about 350 m depth, corroborating the information

presented by the first EOF for PBM1.

Figure 3.5: Explained variance of each statistical mode calculated from the observed

PBM2 data and from a random time-series. The thick black line represents the explained

variance for each statistical mode for the observed mooring; the thin black line represents

the mean explained variance for the statistical modes of a random time-series (Montecarlo

simulations). The dashed lines represent the interval of two standard deviations about the

mean.

The vertical structure of the second EOF (Figure 3.8) for PBM1 has as main

feature its peak amplitude approximately at the depth of the upper boundary of the eddy,

with relatively high values between the near-surface layer and about 200 m. The ampli-

tude zero-crossing takes place at approximately 250 m, close to the lower boundary of

the mean PE. On the remaining of the water column the amplitude presents small values,

virtually reaching zero at the bottom.



48

Figure 3.6: Vertical structure of the first EOF for mooring PBM1 (top panel) and ampli-

tude time series for the first EOF mode for PBM1 (bottom panel).

Figure 3.9 shows the vertical structure of the second EOF for PBM2. This EOF

explains 19% of the variance of the original data, with highest amplitude at about 100 m,

decreasing sharply and presenting low values on the remainder of the water column. The

100 m depth is roughly the depth of the first velocity inversion on the mean alongshore

profile, i. e., the upper boundary of the PE. This also corroborates the information given

by the EOF analysis of PBM1, in which the second EOF represents variability on the

depth of the upper limit of the eddy.



49

Figure 3.7: Vertical structure of the first EOF for mooring PBM2 (top panel) and ampli-

tude time series for the first EOF mode for PBM2 (bottom panel).

The comparison between the mean alongshore velocity profile of both moorings

(Figures 3.2 and 3.3, right panels) and the vertical structure of the EOFs (Figures 3.6,

3.8,3.7 and 3.9) allows a better interpretation of these patterns of variability. The verti-

cal structure of the first EOF, with highest amplitudes close to the lower boundary of the

mean PE, indicates that the main pattern of variability (explaining 60% and 37% of the

variance of the time-series of PBM1 and PBM2, respectively) at the location of the moor-

ings is associated with the increase/decrease of the vertical extent of the eddy, due to the

variation on the depth of its lower boundary. The vertical structure of the second EOF, on

the other hand, indicates that lower, but still important variability (16% and 19% of the



50

variance of the time-series of PBM1 and PBM2, respectively) is due to the variation of

the depth of the upper boundary of the PE by upper layer processes, which also implicates

in an increase/decrease of its vertical extent. In short, these two modes combined have an

effect of increasing/decreasing of the PE vertical extent, mainly due to variations on its

lower limit, with a smaller contribution from variations on its upper limit. Considering

the subpycnoclinic nature of the eddy and that the first EOF mode explains a larger per-

centage of the variance of the original time-series for PBM1 as well as PBM2, here we

will concentrate on the analysis of the first EOF mode, for both moorings.

Figure 3.8: Vertical structure of the second EOF for mooring PBM1 (top panel) and

amplitude time series for the second EOF mode for PBM1 (bottom panel).



51

Figure 3.9: Vertical structure of the second EOF for mooring PBM2 (top panel) and

amplitude time series for the second EOF mode for PBM2 (bottom panel).

To evaluate the periodicity of the identified variability, we performed wavelet

analysis on the amplitude time-series of the first EOF mode for both moorings. Classi-

cal Fourier analysis was not performed due to the non-stationary character of the series,

as shown in Figures 3.6 and 3.7, bottom panels). The resuls of the wavelet analysis are

shown in Figures 3.10 and 3.11 for PBM1 and PBM2, respectively. Also, for compar-

ison between the plots for PBM1 and PBM2, it must be stressed that the length of the

time- series differ between the moorings (eight months for PBM1; one year for PBM2).

After these considerations, the analysis of the plots show that the highest energy of the

amplitude time series of the first EOF is concentrated at periods of 25-35 days, for both



52

moorings, between July and December. For the remainder of the year, these oscilations

are either absent or much weaker. Data from PBM1 presents these oscilations also on the

period between May and August, weaker than during July-December. For both moorings,

the period of the oscilation remains at about 25 days until the end of September, when it

increases to about 35 days.

Figure 3.10: Wavelet analysis of the amplitude time-series for the first EOF for the along-

shore velocity data for PBM1.

In order to better understand the EOF-derived variability found on the PE, we

calculate the dynamical modes on the area of the moorings’ deployment, following the

procedure of Silveira et al. (2008). For the calculation, we use the ONEs cruises temper-

ature and salinity profiles located closest to the location of deployment of the moorings,

using a total of four profiles. The vertical structure of the dynamical modes for moorings

PBM1 and PBM2 are shown on Figures 3.12 and 3.13, respectively.

After calculating the dynamical modes, in order to understand which ones play

key roles on the variability of the system, we project the dynamical modes onto the EOF

vertical structures. This enables us to characterize physically the variability experienced

by the system.

shore velocity data for PBM2.

54

The projection of the dynamical modes onto the first EOF for moorings PBM1

and PBM2 (Figures 3.14 and 3.15) suggests a predominance of the second baroclinic

mode on their vertical structures. The barotropic and first baroclinic modes have little

contribution; the resemblance with the vertical profile of the EOF just visibly increases

when the second baroclinic mode is taken into account. Surely, with the addition of the

third baroclinic mode, the similarity between the recomposed and the original EOF profile

increases. Therefore, the variability presented by the PE is primarily a second baroclinic

mode one.

Figure 3.13: Vertical structure of the barotropic and first three baroclinic modes for

mooring PBM2.

After identifying which dynamical mode plays the key role on the variability in

the system, we turn to the linear wave theory in order to determine if the signal that reaches

the Potiguar Eddy can be interpreted as a linear wave. We use the linear Rossby wave

dispersion relationship (e.g., PEDLOSKY, 1986), considering no meridional propagation

(meridional wavenumber equal to zero). If the signals in the EOF mode amplitudes are

indeed from Rossby waves, they can just be generated eastward of the Potiguar Bight and

then propagate westward. We thus choose a second-mode Rossby deformation radius Rd2



55

for the Atlantic Ocean at 4oS, ? 20o W, of 206 km. The depth considered was 3300 m.

? =
??k

k2 + R?2d2
, (3.1)

where ? is the wave frequency, ? is the meridional gradient of planetary vorticity, k is the

zonal wavenumber, and Rd2 is the second baroclinic Rossby deformation radius. We then

plot the dispersion curve for such waves. The peak of the curve corresponds to 29-day

waves. Hence, only waves longer than this period are associated to the linear Rossby

waves. We thus take the value for the period of 35 days from the wavelet analysis of

the amplitude time series of the first EOF mode. We then use the dispersion relation to

obtain the two k values via Equation 3.1 corresponding to the 25-day and 35-day waves.

As a result, we present the linear Rossby wave dispersion diagram in Figure 3.16. The

wavelengths associated with these 35-day waves are shown in Table 3.1. We therefore

conclude by inspection of Figure 3.16 that linear free second-mode Rossby waves can be

used to approximate to the signal that dominates the first EOF mode amplitude time series

of both moorings.

Table 3.1: Properties of the 35-day linear free second-mode Rossby waves in the Tropical

Atlantic.

Property name Property symbol Larger root Smaller root

wavelength ? 790 km 2118 km

phase velocity cph -0.37 m.s?1 -0.98 m.s?1

The two roots of Equation 3.1 and listed in Table 3.1 are related to dispersive

Rossby waves. The larger one is of a 790 km wave. Half wavelength corresponding to

alternate cyclones and anticyclones are about 395 km. The size of the Rossby vortical

structures then approximately matches the PE major axis and is likely to either enhance

or decrease its signal. The phase speed is about 0.37 m.s?1 in the westward direction

while the group speed is in the eastward direction. The smaller root is associated with a

2118 km wave that propagates both phase and energy westward. The question posed now

is which of these two affects the Potiguar Eddy.

We now turn to altimetry data in order to look for signals with similar period-

icity and seek to find its wavelength. Here we use a finite impulse response (FIR) filter



57

(POLITO and LIU, 2003) to investigate these oscillations. For this filter, we use a value

as a first guess, and then through Radon transform the filter does some ”fine tunning” and

returns the filtered field and the periods and wavelengths contained in the data that are

within a previously specified uncertainty range from the first guess.

Figure 3.16: Dispersion relation for second-mode baroclinic Rossby Waves. The black

bar denotes the frequency corresponding to the period of 35 days, as estimated from

the currentmeter mooring time series. The black cross denotes the period of 33.8 days

depicted from the altimeter data analysis.

The filtering of the altimetry data (Figure 3.17) reveals ? 34-day signals west

of 15oW in the Atlantic Ocean. As shown in Figure 3.17, these waves are not generated

througout the year, but mostly during June-July, reaching the northeastern tip of South

America during September-December. This information corroborates the findings from

the wavelet analysis of the amplitude time series of the first EOF; both altmetry and ampli-

tude time series present a very similar period of oscillation and seasonality on its intensity.

Considering these similarities, we believe the 34-day signals to be clearly associated with



58

the ? 35-day oscillations found on the velocity data.

Figure 3.17: Time-Longitude diagram 33-day waves along 4oS from AVISO altimetric

Sea Surface Height data (in meters).



59

In summary, the comparison of the wavelength and frequency found by the FIR

filter and the values from the linear wave theory show very good agreement. The theoreti-

cal wavelength for the 34-day period yielded a 790 km wavelength, very similar to the 811

km found by the FIR. The FIR-estimated phase speed of about 0.30 m.s?1 is also similar

to the 0.37 estimated theoretically. The fact that information from the linear wave theory,

amplitude time series of EOF from velocity data, and altimetry converge is an indication

that our results are robust, as the process under investigation indeed consists in Rossby

Waves reaching the continental margin.

3.3 Modeled Temporal Variability

3.3.1 Model Validation

After characterizing the PE through mooring data, due to the short period of data

acquisition (8 months for PBM1, one year for PBM2), we analyze 8 years (Nov/2003-

December/2011) of HYCOM model results in order to investigate annual and interannual

variability associated with the PE. The HYCOM results, with its 1/12o horizontal reso-

lution, help on the characterization of the regional scenario in order to better understand

the processes causing variability on the PE. We first perform a validation of the model

results, to assure that they are a good tool for analyzing the kinematics and the dynamics

on the Potiguar Bight region. Figure 3.18 shows the mean streamfunction map for model

results, which pattern closely resembles the ONEII streamfunction map at 144 m (Figure

2.9, bottom panel), even though with lower magnitude (i. e., less shear). The clear signa-

ture of the PE in a 8-year mean streamfunction field, as well in a series of streamfunction

snapshots over these 8-years (not shown), are an indication that the modeled eddy, as well

as the observed eddy, is a permanent feature is the region. The PE on model results is, as

on the ONEII data, confined within the Potiguar Bight, with a size comparable to the size

of the PE depicted on ONEII data: major axis measures ? 330 km; minor axis measures

93 km.

In order to investigate if the modeled and observed PE are in the same dynamical

regime, we use the same methodology as used for the obervational data: we calculate the



60

Rossby number using the mean velocity magnitude in concentric streamlines of the eddy,

on the mean streamfunction map at ? 150 m depth (Figure 3.19).

Figure 3.18: Mean (2003-2011) streamfunction map from HYCOM results at 150 m

depth.

The first difference between Figure 3.19 and its counterpart from ONEII data

(Figure 2.9) is the intensity; as noted earlier, the observed eddy is stronger than the mod-

eled one. Also, the observed NBUC seems to detach more from the coast, resulting in a

larger minor axis in observational data than in model results, therefore a more rounded

shape of the PE in observational data. After calculating the Rossby number, we obtained a

mean value of 0.35, which suggests that the modeled eddy in fact is in a similar dynamical

regime as the observed PE.



61

Another part of the validation is the mean cross-eddy section of the modeled

PE (Figure 3.20). The mean cross eddy HYCOM velocity section shows a weaker NBUC

than the geostrophic sections, but the flow pattern is realistic. The transport of the modeled

PE is 1.3 Sv, slightly lower than that indicated by the observational data, and the major and

minor axis are in reasonable agreement, measuring 300 and 130 km, respectively (Figure

3.18). Considering the similarity between the observed and modeled eddy concerning

dynamical regime, size, transport and vertical extent, we turn to investigate the model

results for variability of the PE of longer time scales.

results. The area used on the calculation of the Rossby number is in blue.

velocities are northwestward. The ?0 = 24.5 kg.m?3 and ?0 = 26.8 kg.m?3 isopycnals are plotted.

3.3.2 Analysis of the HYCOM Model Time Series

In order to investigate the time-variability of the model eddy we consider two

synthetic moorings, in the same location as the PBM1 amd PBM2 moorings. The mean

rotated velocity profile for synthetic moorings PBM1 and PBM2 (Figures 3.21 and 3.22)

provide more evidence that, on the mean, the PE is present on the model results, with its

core at slightly less than 200 m depth. Also, we see that, in agreement with the observed

eddy, the mean model PE does not have surface expression, presenting its upper boundary

at about 100 m depth, in both synthetic moorings. Also, the mean vertical extent of the

modeled eddy is about 250 m, somewhat less than the observed PE. Another difference

between the synthetic and the observed moored velocity data is the velocity magnitude.

The modeled PE has at the depth of its core maximum (mean) velocities of about 0.2

m.s?1, while the observed eddy has maximum velocities of about 0.4 - 0.5 m.s?1. In spite

of the small differences, the gereral agreement on the mean profile allows us to investigate



63

the variability of the synthetic moooring velocity.

Positive values of cross-shore (alongshore) velocity indicate northeastward (southeastward) flow.

Figure 3.22: Mean cross-shore (left) and alongshore (right) profiles for PBM2 synthetic mooring.

64

An EOF analysis of the model-moored velocity time-series reveals three statisti-

cally significant modes at both PBM1 (Figure 3.23) and PBM2 (Figure 3.24). The vertical

structure of the EOFs are very similar between both moorings. The vertical structure of

the first EOF (Figures 3.25 and 3.26) has maximum amplitude at the surface, monoton-

ically decreasing until about 200 m, when it reaches zero and aproximately maintains

this value throughout the rest of the water column. This structure is the same for both

synthetic moorings; for the synthetic PBM1 it explains 53 % of the time-series, and for

synthetic mooring PBM2, it explains 49 %.

Figure 3.23: Explained variance of each statistical mode calculated from the synthetic

PBM1 and from a random time-series. The thick black line represents the explained

variance for each statistical mode for the observed mooring; the thin black line represents

the mean explained variance for the statistical modes of a random time-series (Montecarlo

simulations). The dashed lines represent the interval of two standard deviations about the

mean.

The vertical structure of the second EOF of the synthetic moorings (Figures 3.27

and 3.28) is more similar to what we found on the observed data. It has greater amplitude

between 100 m and 400-500 m depth, with maximum velocities at about 200 m, which



65

closely coincides with the depth of the modeled PE maximum velocities. This second

EOF explains 28% and 27% of the variance of the series for the synthetic moorings PBM1

and PBM2, respectively.

Figure 3.24: Explained variance of each statistical mode calculated from the synthetic

PBM2 and from a random time-series. The thick black line represents the explained

variance for each statistical mode for the observed mooring; the thin black line represents

the mean explained variance for the statistical modes of a random time-series (Montecarlo

simulations). The dashed lines represent the interval of two standard deviations about the

mean.

The comparison between the statistical modes of the velocity time series from

the observed and synthetic moorings reveals high correspondence between the first (sec-

ond) EOF of the observed moorings and the second (first) EOF of the synthetic ones.

The first EOF of the observed moorings, as previously stated, is associated with Rossby

Waves propagating westward in the Equatorial Atlantic. The main period found for the

first EOF for the observed moorings (25-35 days) is also found on the amplitude time

series for the second EOF of the synthetic moorings, which strongly suggests that they

are associated with the same process. The second EOF of the observed moorings is re-



66

lated to upper-ocean processes, envolving the Ekman layer and the seasonal variability of

the trade winds over the Tropical Atlantic. We believe that the first EOF from the model

outputs is associated with this process, and probably has higher explained variance due

to the time-limited observed mooring data which prevented from resolving the seasonal

cycle in a 8-month or one-year long time series.

Figure 3.25: Vertical structure of the first EOF for synthetic mooring PBM1.

We also analyze the model results for lower-frequency variability. Figure 3.29

shows an annual and a semiannual wave fit on the amplitude time-series of the two EOFs

for the synthetic mooring PBM1. The amplitude time series of the first EOF presents a

larger annual signal than the second mode, which indicates that the first mode from the

synthetic moorings is indeed related to upper ocean processes and therefore subject to

the annual signal of the trade winds in the Atlantic. The same behavior is seen on the

amplitude time series for synthetic mooring PBM2.

3.4 Discussion

In this chapter we were able to address the PE stationarity and variability through

the analysis of two (one 8-month long and another one-year long) time series of current

meter moorings. The PE appears clearly in the mean profile of mooring velocity, with

an about 250 m vertical extent (60-264 m in PBM1 and 100-430 m in PBM2), strongly

suggesting that it is a permanent feature in the region. This is a subsurface frontal me-

ander, with the mean current speeds at the surface on the opposite direction of that of its

nearshore lobe. The PE southeastward velocity core is attached to the coast, as shown

in the previous chapter, and extends offshore at least up to 50-100 km. The PE’s highest

velocities, on the mooring data, occur on the mooring line closer to the coast (PBM1), as

was suggested by the synoptical velocity sections shown in chapter 2.

Once the stationarity of the PE has been established, we turn to its temporal

variability. The PE presents mainly two modes of variability, both affecting its vertical

extent. The first mode is associated with the variation of the depth of the lower boundary

of the PE, while the second mode, explaining less variance, is related to the variation of

the upper limit of the eddy, and probably associated with upper-layer processes. In this

dissertation, we focus on the first mode of variability.

This first mode of variability explains about 60% and 37 % of the variance of the

original series for PBM1 and PBM2, respectively. It has maximum amplitude close to the

lower limit of the PE, being associated with the increase/decrease of the vertical extent,

due to the variation on the depth of its lower boundary. Wavelet analysis of the EOF

amplitude time-series reveal that most of the energy of this first mode is concentrated in

periods of 25-35 days, with a modulation: the 25-day period is predominant during July-

September, while the 35-day period oscilation is prevalent during September-December.

The vertical profile of this mode of variability is dominated by the second baroclinic

mode, with maximum amplitude concentrated on the lower half of the eddy.

Knowing that there is a second-mode signal impinging variability on the PE, and

with the urge to understand which phenomenon could cause such variability, we turned

to altimetry data. Using the technique of Polito and Liu (2003) we were able to detect

34-day waves along a zonal section located at 4oS. The filtered altimetry data indicate



71

that these waves are generated west of 15o W mostly during the month of June. They then

propagate westward and reach the Potiguar Bight during August-September.

Intraseasonal variability have been previously reported on the NBUC/cSEC and

NBC system. At 4o N, Johns et al. (1998) found two distinct modes of variability in

current meter mooring data; a baroclinic deep-reaching 60-90 day mode and a surface

trapped, 25-40 day mode. The 25-40 day mode is most energetic in May-June, related to

the eddy shedding of the NBC retroflection. The 60-90 days mode, on the other hand, is

present year-round, and is associated with the propagation of eddies, having a wave-like

character. Further south, aproximately at the equator, Schott et al. (1993) found near-

surface currents dominated by ? 30-day periodicity, with maximum energy occurring in

May-July. At 11o S, Veleda et al. (2012) report oscilations with a 14-21 day period,

related to the lagged correlation structure between meridional wind stress and alongshore

currents, consistent with Coastal Trapped Wave theory.

The period of the oscilations reported by Johns et al. (1998) and Schott et al.

(1993) match the periods we found in the Potiguar Bight, but the processes envolved

are clearly different. The 25-40 day mode from Johns et al. (1998) is strongly surface

trapped, resembling the first baroclinic mode, as are the oscilations reported by Schott

et al. (1993). Even though the periods are similar, these oscilations are dynamically

different from the ones we identified in the Potiguar Bight.

From the dispersion relation, the oscilations we report here have a second-mode

Rossby Wave behavior. This result does not disagree with the findings of Schott et al.

(1993) and Johns et al. (1998), since they reported first-mode waves, instead of second-

mode ones. After identifying the waves, we speculate their generation process.

Lumpkin and Garzoli (2005) study of drifter trajectories indicate that the maxi-

mum speeds in the cSEC occur in mid-July. Considering the modulation of the variability

mode we that found (with most energy in this frequency band during July-December),

we argue that these second-mode Rossby Waves are generated by barotropic instability in

the Equatorial Current System, as the Tropical Instability waves reported by Schott et al.

(1993).

After characterizing the intraseasonal variability, we turn to an analysis of the



72

lower-frequency signals in the HYCOM global model results. The HYCOM outputs

present neither significant annual nor interannual variability in the Potiguar Bight, as in-

dicated by a number of studies on the NBUC (SCHOTT et al., 1998; JOHNS et al., 1990;

JOHNS et al., 1998).

In this chapter we analyzed the variability of the PE through observational data,

satellite altimetry and global numerical model results. On the following chapter we ana-

lyze the PE generation process within a process-study numerical model framework.



Chapter 4

Dynamical Process Studies

Here we address the issue of the dynamics of the PE in terms of numerical ex-

periments carried out using the Regional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS). To develop

the initial fields for these simulations, we use the Feature-Oriented Regional Modeling

System (FORMS) technique. Section 4.1 describes the development of Feature Models

for NBUC and DWBC. In section 4.2 we present the numerical experiments set up carried

out to address a set of science questions related to the eddy phenomenon. In section 4.3

we discuss the calibration and sensitivity of the numerical model to the choice of numer-

ical parameters for establishing a realistic dynamic simulation. In section 4.4 we present

the results of the analysis of numerical simulations.

4.1 Development of Feature Models

For the numerical experiments using ROMS, we applied the Feature-Oriented

Regional Modeling System (FORMS) approach (GANGOPADHYAY et al., 1997; GAN-

GOPADHYAY and ROBINSON, 2002; GANGOPADHYAY et al., 2003). This tech-

nique consists of empirically and analytically creating Feature Models to develop initial

and boundary conditions for primitive equation numerical simulations. We applied this

technique in a feature-oriented process study approach, in which one is able to build a

conceptual scenario to reproduce and study the feature(s) of interest.

In this approach, an analytical formulation is developed for the synoptic features

of interest, based on information from previous studies and observations. This analyt-

73



74

ical formulation of the three-dimensional velocity and mass field (the Feature Model -

FM) is then used as initial field for process study numerical experiments, enabling the

investigation of the dynamical processes taking place.

A main advantage of the feature-oriented process study approach is the possi-

bility of filtering and/or enphasizing certain characteristics of the flow which, in spite of

being realistic, may not be of fundamental importance for the process(es) of interest. For

example, if one is studying a process which is dominated by barotropic instability, Feature

Model parameters can be tuned to accentuate only the barotropic component of currents,

even though the currents have a strong baroclinic component. This way, only the variables

which are believed to play a crucial role on the process of interest will play dominant role

in the simulations and can be studied dinamically. It must be stressed that, even though

such process study Feature Models do not necessarily contain all the observed charac-

teristics in nature, the FM does need to be based on the observed features and validated

against actual data.

In the Potiguar Bight, the Potiguar Eddy is a recirculation of the NBUC waters;

therefore, the first feature in the region that demands understanding is the NBUC. At

deeper levels, on the other hand, the main feature of the circulation is the DWBC and, in

spite of the fact that the PE only extends up to 400 m depth, this current might also play

a role on the PE dynamics. The DWBC may influence the vertical shear to induce baro-

clinic instability and thus influence the generation of the PE. Additionally, the cSEC flows

westward in the study domain to feed into the variability of these two dominant boundary

currents in the region. With the knowledge of the main features that are present on the

region and might influence the PE, we address the following questions using the FORMS

technique and dynamical studies using ROMS, through the process study approach:

• Is the NBUC alone capable of generating the PE?

• How important is the vertical shear for the generation of the PE?

In order to address these questions, we use the information that we have from

observations and past synthesis studies, of each of the main currents in the area, namely,

the NBUC, the DWBC, and the cSEC, to develop individual Feature Models. These



75

Feature Models are then used to set up the initial field for numerical simulations, and the

results help understanding the role of each feature on the PE dynamics.

4.1.1 NBUC Feature Model Formulation

The NBUC FM is developed based on the observed data from ONEI (February -

March, 2002) and ONEII (October - December, 2004) cruises, as well as information from

previous studies (SILVEIRA et al., 1994; SCHOTT et al., 2003; SCHOTT et al., 2005).

We select the maximum speed, core depth, transport, horizontal and vertical extent from

each source in order to develop the Feature Model, following earlier FM developments of

BC, NBC (CALADO et al., 2008; SOUTELINO et al., 2013). Table 4.1 shows the values

of these variables for each study, as well as the ones used for the NBUC Feature Model

itself.

The values of the maximum speed, core depth, and western and eastern width of

the current for the ONEI and ONEII cruises shown in Table 4.1 were estimated taking into

account only sections 1-5 of each cruise, instead of all sections. This was done in order

to extract and preserve the characteristics of the NBUC before the influence of the cSEC,

i. e., south of ? 4o S. This care was also taken for the estimated values for the studies of

Silveira et al. (1994) and Schott et al. (2005). Caution was taken when considering the

information from the study of Schott et al. (2003), since it is based on a mean meridional

section at 35oW, area in which the NBUC is under the strong influence of the cSEC.

Based on the information from the data and previous studies, we developed an

analytical function that represents the along-stream velocity structure of the NBUC (Equa-

tion 4.1). The orientation of the system is a natural coordinate frame of reference, in which

s is the along-stream axis, n is the cross-stream axis, and z is the vertical axis.

where:

?(s,n,z) is the velocity of the current, which varies in the along-stream (s),

cross-stream (n), and vertical (z) axes;

?max(s) is the maximum velocity of the current;

nc is the distance of the NBUC core from the coast;

zc(s) is the linear function for the NBUC core lifting;

?n/2 is the horizontal width of each side of the current:

for n &amp;lt;nc (onshore part of the current): ?n/2 = 50 km;

for n &gt; nc (offshore part of the current): ?n/2 = 50 km;

?z/2 represents the upward/downward vertical extent of the current from the

core:

for z &gt; zc: ?z/2 = 100 m;

for z &amp;lt;zc: ?z/2 = 360 m;

As previously stated, the formulation for the NBUC FM was based on informa-

tion from the literature, as well as from ONEI and ONEII cruises. On Figures 4.1 and 4.2,

part of the analysis of the cruise data in order to develop the FM analytical formulation is

exemplified. A simple best-fit is done on the data, to find parameters that matched with

relevant information from the literature and cruises. Based on the vessel-mounted ADCP

data from ONEII cruise, we calculated statistical fit to the curves, obtaining the values

of the parameters for the analytical function in Equation 4.1, to be used as shape of the

NBUC, vertically as well as horizontally.

(solid line) and FM (dashed line) velocity profile at the location indicated by the vertical

black line on the upper panel. Lower panel: observed (solid line) and FM (dashed line)

upper panel. Positive velocities indicate northward flow.

According to the information from the literature and from ONEI and ONEII

cruises, we set the parameters for the depth of the NBUC core (zc) to be 250 m at the

southern (about 10oS), and shoal up to 130 m at the northern boundary of the domain.

Also, the maximum velocity of the NBUC (?(s,n,z)) was set at about 0.8 m.s?1, in order

to yield a realistic transport of about 24.5 Sv. The analytical function used for the NBUC

FM was applied over various sections along the brazilian coast, as shown in Figure 4.3.

As a result of the solution of the analytical velocity formulation for each transect,

we have a current flowing along the coast, with the aforementioned characteristics which

are specific to the NBUC. Figures 4.4 and 4.5 present the NBUC FM velocity through the

southern and northern parts of the domain, respectively. The first characteristic to notice

is the subsurface character of the NBUC core throughout the domain. Also, the modeled

NBUC has a ? 1000 m vertical extent (?z) on the southern portion of the domain; as

the current flows northward, due to the shoaling of its core, its vertical extent is linearly



79

reduced, reaching a minimum of about 850 m. The horizontal width (?n/2) used was

constant over the domain, and the same for the western and eastern sides of the current.

This fixed value was adopted even though realisticaly the width of the current is smaller

on the onshore than on the offshore portion and varies along the currents’ path due to

contributions from different currents (Figures 4.1 and 4.2). This choice was based on

two assumptions: (i) the difference of horizontal width between the onshore and offshore

portions of the NBUC are not fundamental for the generation and maintenance of the PE,

and (ii) the along-stream variation of the width of the current is due to contributions from

other currents. Considering that in this work we develop an individual Feature Model for

each current, it would be undesirable to insert on the NBUC FM characteristics which

are due to the existence of other currents. The NBUC transport increases slightly in the

along-stream direction, from ? 24.4 Sv at 11oS to ? 25 Sv at 2oS.

Figure 4.5: Velocity section 44 (northernmost) of the NBUC FM.

The near-equatorial salinity field has complications that were not captured by

the feature model formulation; therefore, we use the climatological salinity field from

WOA (2013). This process is described in detail in Section 4.3. After the FM velocity

and temperature fields were developed, they were gridded to the domain (40oW-26oW,

11oS-1oS) by repeating the last (easternmost) values of temperature and velocity of each

the FM transects up to the eastern edge of the domain. This procedure was not necessary

for the salinity field, since the WOA salinity field spans the entire domain.



83

The gridded FM temperature and salinity fields for the surface and 200 m are

shown in Figures 4.6 and 4.7, respectively. The salinity field shows a larger spatial vari-

ability at both levels, since it is itself the WOA(2013) salinity field. The temperature field,

on the other hand, has much less structures, with lower values confined close to the coast.

4.1.2 DWBC Feature Model Formulation

The DWBC FM was developed like that of the NBUC FM, but all the parameter-

related information (Table 4.2) was derived from previous studies only. That was neces-

sary because the depth reach of the ADCP during ONEI and ONEII was much shallower

than the upper layer of the DWBC (? 1200 m).

Table 4.2: Information from the literature for the DWBC FM formulation.

Parameter Schott et al. (2003) Schott et al. (2005) DWBC FM

Transport 24.5 Sv 35o W 25.5 ± 8.3 Sv 5o S 20 Sv

35.5 Sv 11o S

Maximum velocities 10 cm.s?1 20-25 cm.s?1 0.25 m.s?1

Core depth 1500 m 2000 m 2000 m

Eastern width 90 km 70 km 55 km

Vertical extent 1200 - 4000 m 1200 - 3800 m 1200 - 3500 m

The number of DWBC studies is clearly much smaller than studies about the

NBUC, and that relates to the dificulties in sampling a deep current. Also, as the DWBC

crosses the equator, its path is not very clear, as it may follow an eastward path as well

as southward. Besides, some water mass transformations take place close to the equator.

Primarily we used the two consecutive studies by Schott et al. (2003) and Schott et

al. (2005) for DWBC FM development. Note that Schott et al. (2003) describes the

DWBC in a mean sense at 35oW and Schott et al. (2005) describe a data-based synoptic

characterization of the DWBC at 5oS and 11oS. For implementing the synoptic DWBC

FM, we thus chose Schott et al. (2005) mainly for extrating the parameters. See Figure

4.10 for observed depictions of DWBC from Schott et al. (2005).



84

The adopted DWBC formulation is very similar to the NBUC formulation, with

the main difference that the core depth does not vary along the path of the current. The

formulation is the following (Equation 4.5):

?(s,n,z) = ?max(s)exp
[
?
(

(n ? nc)2

2?2n
+

(z ? zc(s))2

2?2z

)]
, (4.5)

where ?max(s) is the maximum velocity of the current; nc is the distance of the

DWBC core from the coast; zc is the core depth of the DWBC; ?2n represents the horizontal

width on either side of the current at the depth of the core:

for n &amp;lt;nc (onshore part of the current): ?x/2 = 40 km,

for n &gt; nc (offshore part of the current): ?x/2 = 75 km;

and ?z represents the vertical width of the current from the core, which differs on

the upper and lower part of the current:

for z &gt; zc: ?z/2 = 500 m

for z &amp;lt;zc: ?z/2 = 800 m

Based on the information from the literature (Schott et al. (2003) and Schott et

al. (2005)), the NBUC FM was chosen to have a 0.25 m.s?1 core (?max) at 2000 m depth

(zc), extending from 1200 to 3500 m and yielding a transport of about 20 Sv (Table 4.2).

As done for the NBUC FM, the DWBC FM velocity formulation was solved for various

sections along the coast, the same ones used for the NBUC (Figure 4.3). Also, considering

that the PE is a feature within the depth range of the NBUC, we apply the DWBC together

with the NBUC FM, since without the NBUC there would be no possibility of the PE to

exist. To apply both FMs, we simply sum the NBUC FM and the DWBC FM.

The southernmost and northernmost sections of the combination of the DWBC

and NBUC FMs (Figures 4.8 and 4.9, respectively), show the DWBC further offshore

from the coast than the NBUC. Since the velocity and the vertical extent of the DWBC do

not change along the current’s path, the transport of the DWBC is constant througout the

domain. The core is vertically located at 2000 m and the symetry of the current is visible

through the fixed horizontal width, which is the same for both sides of the current.

Unfortunatly, the DWBC FM could not be validated against the ONEI or ONEII

data, due to the depth reach of the ADCP equipment. Therefore, in Figure 4.10 we present



85

Schott et al. (2005)’s sections at 5o S and 11o S, to compare to the sections of our NBUC

FM.

The comparison between the DWBC FM (Figures 4.8 and 4.9) and the mean

observed DWBC (Figure 4.10) demonstrates that the parameters used for the development

of the Feature Model were valid. The core velocity, 0.25 m.s?1, is the same for the FM

and the observations; the depth of the core, at approximately 2000 m depth, is coincident

as well. The width of the current, somewhat over 100 km, is also similar, yielding a

similar transport for the feature model and the observed mean section at 5 oS. The upper

and lower limits of the current, ? 1200 m and ? 3500 m, also match between model and

observations.

As was done for the NBUC FM, the temperature was calculated through the

inversion of the thermal wind relation (Equation 4.2), also with a mean T-S profile from

the WOA (2013) climatology. Then the velocity and temperature fields were gridded to

the domain (40oW-26oW, 11oS-1oS) by repeating the last (easternmost) values of each

of the FM transects up to the eastern edge of the domain. For the salinity field, the

WOA (2013) salinity field, which spanned the entire domain, was used. Therefore, just

interpolation to the bathymetry values was performed on the salinity values.

4.2 Numerical experiments set-up

We address two dynamical questions with two numerical experiments. Each

question was addressed with a particular combination of NBUC-DWBC feature model

discussed in the previous section. We describe these in detail below.

Question 1: Can the NBUC alone generate the PE?

To address this question, we set up an experiment with an initial field com-

posed by just the NBUC FM, with the topography truncated at 1500 m and no islands

or seamounts offshore the continental slope, as well as no wind stress. The chosen do-

main is between 10o S and 1o S; 27o W and 40o W, with a 5-km horizontal spaced grid

and 30 sigma layers vertical resolution. In this set-up, the flow coming in from the south

corresponds to 24.77 Sv and the flow going out on the western boundary is 25.13 Sv,

yielding an imbalance of 0.36 Sv (Figure 4.11). The difference in transport results from

the increase in the NBUC core velocity.

Figure 4.11: Transport values imposed on the edges of the domain for Experiment # 1.

The boundary conditions were clamped on the southern and western boundaries

(where there are inflow and outflow, respectively, on the initial field) and nudging on the

eastern and northern boundaries. At these boundaries there is no inflow or outflow on the



92

initial field, so the nudging was enforced in order to maintain this condition throughout

the run. A 6-point sponge layer was imposed, with nudging time scales of 6 days 6 points

away from the boundary, and 1 day at the boundary itself. This run was also set up with a

free-slip condition, being called Experiment # 1. Figure 4.11

Question 2: How important is the vertical shear on the generation of the

PE?

To address this question, we set up an experiment with an initial field built with

the composition of the NBUC and DWBC FMs. The horizontal limits of the domain

and its horizontal resolution were the same as in Experiment # 1, but on the vertical, the

domain extended from the surface down to 5500 m, with computations performed in 50

sigma layers. The boundary conditions enforced were the same as in Experiment # 1, i. e.,

clamped on the southern and western boundaries, and nudging on the eastern and northern

boundaries. This run was also set up with a free-slip condition and no wind stress, and

was called Experiment # 2. The schematics for the mass balance for this experiment

is shown on Figure 4.12, demonstrating a total imbalance of about 0.85 Sv, which we

consider to be small enough not to cause mass-imbalance problems.

Figure 4.12: Transport values imposed on the edges of the domain for Experiment # 2.



93

These experiments are carried out with the Regional Ocean Modelling System

(ROMS) (SHCHEPETKIN and MCWILLIAMS, 2005), which is a primitive- equation

numerical model developed from the S-Coordinate Rutgers University Model. ROMS

has stretched coordinates in the vertical and curvilinear coordinates on the horizontal, and

uses an Arakawa-C grid. The domain, as cited on the previous sections, extended between

10o S and 1o S; 27o W and 40o W, with different discretizations on the vertical - 30 sigma

levels for Experiments #1 and 50 for Experiment # 2. For Experiment # 1 the batimetry

was smoothed until the maximum topographic gradient was 0.2, for Experiment #2, we

use a 0.15 gradient.

4.3 Calibration of Numerical Model and Sensitivity

studies for long-term simulations

Generally, in a FORMS approach for synoptic ocean prediction, there are three

distinct steps; (i) Validation, which is the physical validation of occurence and mainte-

nance of realistic size and shape of the reproduced features; (ii) Calibration, which would

be the changing and tuning parameter values to achieve validation, and (iii) Verification,

which is realistically reproducing past observed events to verify that the prediction sys-

tem has skill of forecasting as evidenced from hindcasts. In a process-study approach, the

”verification” step is replaced by ”investigation”, over which we analyze the processes

envolved on the features of interest.

In the previous sections we describe the development of the Feature Model and

compare it with available data/information, thus completing step (i). After this step, we

turn to the calibration phase, in which we develop a calibrated system to its dynamical

equilibrium for investigating processes of interest with dynamical realizations. In step

(ii), we configured a series of numerical simulations with the developed Feature Models,

analyzing the requirements and the changes necessary for the dynamical equilibrium to be

reached. In this sense, Tables 4.3 and 4.4 list all the sensitivity experiments that were car-

ried out before the working set-up was achieved, with the boundary and initial conditions

that are most suitable for our study.

When developing the initial fields for the simulations, we considered a series of

issues, including mainly: (a) salinity feature model derivation based on a single linear

t-s relationship; (b) salinity feature model with two linear t-s relationships (one for the

shelf and another for the deep ocean); (c) addition of a bottom boundary layer (BBL);

(d) free-slip vs. no-slip; (e) use of salinity climatology from WOA 2009; (f) use of salin-

ity climatology from WOA 2013; (g) maximum bottom slope allowed, and finally (h)

seamounts vs. no-seamounts.

We found that both (a) and (b) resulted in multiple issues with generation of high-

salinity regions and unrealistic salinities near the bottom. The enforced bottom boundary

layer (with an exponential decay to zero velocity at the bottom from a specified depth)

helped for a little while; but not for the long-term. We then used free-slip boundary con-

dition, and no bottom boundary layer. The use of WOA2013 climatology finally helped

the evolution of salinity near the western boundary (high-current) regions. However, at

this time, we had issues with anomalous salinity concentrations around seamounts. So,

in the final simulation for the 1500 m run (Experiment #1), the WOA 2013 salinity field

is used in a model domain without any seamounts. This simulation was stable and repet-

itive in its performance for over 500 days. For the Experiment # 2, the seamounts were

maintained, but the maximum model bathymetric slope alowed was reduced from 0.25 to

0.15. Similar long-term runs were carried out in parallel with the 5500 m set up and all

of the sensitivity studies are listed in Table 4.4.

4.4 Model results

Two experiments were conducted, with distinct vertical domain (H = 1500 m

and H = 5500 m ) and small differences on the set-up, as indicated in section 4.2. On

the following sections we describe the results of the model experiments # 1 and # 2 and

compare them with information from observed data, focusing on the Potiguar Bight area.



97

4.4.1 Experiment # 1 (NBUC only, H = 1500 m)

The kinetic energy in Experiment # 1 stabilized after 100 days (Figure 4.13).

This experiment was run for about 550 days, a time span within which the model seemed

to have reached dynamical equilibrium.

Figure 4.13: Time evolution of domain-averaged kinetic energy for Experiment # 1. Note

that the dynamical equilibrium of the simulation is reached after about 100 days.

In this experiment, the surface current field remained highly variable throughout

the simulation, with the flow dominated by quasi-stationary and propagating eddies along

the coast, specially on the northern part of the domain. A representative picture of the

surface velocity field after the kinetic energy stabilization is given on Figure 4.14.

At a depth of 200 m, before the kinetic energy stabilization, the NBUC meanders

close to the northeast tip of South America, generates dipoles in the Potiguar Basin area,

and sheds eddies that move to the northwestern part of the domain, as shown on the

sequence presented on Figure 4.15. Around day 100, the PE becomes a stationary eddy

confined on the Potiguar Basin, and remains that way for the remainder of the run. The

process of eddy generation, which happened before the onset of dynamical equilibrium

was reached, can be followed in the 200 m horizontal velocity and temperature field in



98

Figure 4.15 and on cross-eddy velocity and temperature sections in Figures 4.16 and 4.17,

respectively, and is described in the following paragraph.

Figure 4.14: Velocity and temperature fields on day 101 at the surface for Experiment #

1.

In the beginning of the run, during day one, the velocity field at 200 m shows the

NBUC very similar to that of the initial field developed based on the Feature Model; no

eddy is seen on the Potiguar Bight. On the following days, there are eddies formed in the

region as part of a dipole structure with an anticyclone on the nearshore side of the current

and a cyclone on the offshore side. The vertical velocity sections depict the perturbation

on the velocity field with depth by the dipole structure as the eddy formation evolves. The

temperature sections also show the perturbation on the isotherms caused by the instability

of the field. On day 101 the field reaches a stable configuration, with the NBUC flowing

northwestward along the coast and the stationary PE is confined to the Potiguar Bight.

After this stable configuration is reached, the flow field does not change significantly over

the integration period (up to day 500). Also, it should be stressed that the time required

for the PE to become stationary coincides with the time required for the domain-averaged



99

kinetic energy to stabilize (Figure 4.13).

# 1 during days 1 (upper left), 7 (upper right), 15 (middle left), 51 (middle right), 71 (lower

100

Figure 4.16: Evolution of the velocity field over a cross-eddy section during Experiment

# 1 during days 1 (upper left), 7 (upper right), 15 (middle left), 51 (middle right), 71

(lower left), and 101 (lower right).

As suggested by the mean cross-eddy section after the stabilization of the run

(Figure 4.18), the modeled PE seems to have a very weak surface signature and a deep-

reaching structure. However, the sole analysis of the mean cross-eddy velocity section

to infer the vertical extent of the eddy can be misleading. The horizontal temperature

and velocity fields for day 101 for 500, 900 and 1000 m (Figures 4.19, 4.20 and 4.21,

respectively), show that, even though there is a deep southeastward flow attached to the

continental slope in the Potiguar Bight, this flow does not necessarily correspond to a part

of the eddy. The PE is clearly seen on the 500 m field (Figure 4.19), but on the 900 m and



101

1000 m there is no eddy structure on the Potiguar Bight. The southeastward velocities are

caused by a southward-flowing current along the coast, probably generated by the bathy-

metric constraints (1500 m maximum depth) imposed for this run. Therefore, caution

must be exercized when delimiting the part of the water column over the influence of the

eddy. Here, after analyzing horizontal velocity fields, we delimit the eddy as between 50

and 750 m for transport calculation.

Figure 4.17: Evolution of the temperature field over a cross-eddy section during Exper-

iment # 1 during days 1 (upper left), 7 (upper right), 15 (middle left), 51 (middle right),

71 (lower left), and 101 (lower right).

The flow at 500 m presented on Figure 4.19 is representative of the flow at this

depth after the run reaches stabilization. The field is similar to the 200 m field, with



102

the Potiguar eddy clearly formed. On 1000 m (Figure 4.21), however, no PE is seen

and a continuous southward current is identified along the coast, which is probably due

to the continuity requirement from the bathymetric constraints imposed for this run, as

previously stated. The mean modeled NBUC after the run reached dynamical equilibrium

has a transport of 27 Sv, comparable to the values indicated by Silveira et al. (1994);

Schott et al. (2002), for example. Its path is also realistic, as well as its core depth and

width.

Figure 4.18: Mean cros-section for Experiment # 1, over days 201-360.

In Experiment # 1 we investigate whether or not the NBUC alone would be

capable of generating the Potiguar Eddy. As a result of our analysis we reach the conclu-

sion that the PE formation process does not require the presence of the DWBC, since its

generation is observed in this NBUC-only configuration. On Figure 4.22 we analyze the

formation of the PE at 200 m in the relative vorticity field. Figure 4.23 shows a cross-eddy

relative vorticity profile at 200 m during the same days as Figure 4.22.



103

Figure 4.19: Velocity and temperature fields on day 101 at 500 m for Experiment # 1.

The shear of the flow field on the Potiguar Bight during the process of eddy

formation is revealed in the horizontal relative vorticity field at 200 m (Figure 4.22). On

day 1, only the patches of positive and negative relative vorticity associated with the

NBUC are seen in the Potiguar Bight, following the topographic contours. On Figure

4.23 this is more evident, with the positive relative vorticity on the nearshore side of the

current, the sign change (representing the location of the NBUC core), and the negative

relative vorticity on the offshore side of the current.

On day 7 the field is already disturbed, as the NBUC starts to meander and flow

further away from the coast. During days 15, 51 and 71 the NBUC does not follow

the topography, flowing without much meandering further from the coast. The relative

vorticity horizontal distribution close to the coast seems to be in a transient state, without

a clear pattern close to the shore. On the cross-eddy profile, the slow development of a

patch of negative relative vorticity close to the coast is more evident.



104

Figure 4.20: Velocity and temperature fields on day 101 at 900 m for Experiment # 1.

Finally, on day 101, a steady state is reached, with the positive and negative

patches representing the positive and negative relative vorticity areas on either side of the

NBUC core, and a large area of positive relative vorticity over the Potiguar Bight on the

horizontal distribution. On the cross-eddy profile (Figure 4.23, lower right panel), the

signature of the now formed PE is seen as the profile presents a (i) negative (cyclonic)

relative vorticity near the coast, followed by (ii) positive (anticyclonic) relative vorticity

further offshore, which is followed by (iii) another patch of negative (cyclonic) relative

vorticity. (i) represents the nearshore portion of the nearshore lobe of the PE, with (east-

ward) velocity increasing northward. After the peak velocities of the nearshore lobe of the

PE are reached, the relative vorticity changes sign and becomes positive, (ii) associated

with the (westward) velocity increase in the northern direction. At the location of the core

of the NBUC, the relative vorticity changes sign again (iii), due to the (westward) velocity

decrease in the northern direction.

108

4.4.2 Experiment # 2 (NBUC + DWBC, H = 5500 m)

Experiment # 2 was run for 420 days, which corresponds to about 320 days

after the stabilization of the domain-averaged kinetic energy, around day 100 ( Figure

4.24). Note that both Experiments # 1 and #2 took about 100 days to reach dynamical

equilibrium and this is the same time-period for the PE to be established.

Figure 4.24: Time evolution of domain-averaged eddy kinetic energy for Experiment #

2.

For this experiment, as done for Experiment # 1, we explain in detail the gener-

ation of the modeled PE based on the 200 m horizontal velocity and temperature fields

(Figure 4.25), cross-eddy velocity sections (Figure 4.26) and cross-eddy temperature sec-

tions (Figure 4.27) over the first days of the simulation.

On day 1, the field is very similar to the initial field, since the flow has not yet

had time to adjust. As days go by, the NBUC starts to flow further from the coast on the

Potiguar Bight area, and on day 13 an eddy is formed in the region. However, it seems

that the current takes a few more days to adjust to the bathymetry (Potiguar Bight), and

therefore the nearshore eddy velocities oscillate in a strengthening and weakening cycle,

until reaching an equilibrium around day 121.

# 2 during days 1 (upper left), 7 (upper right), 13 (middle left), 21 (middle right), 25 (lower

# 2 during days 1 (upper left), 7 (upper right), 13 (middle left), 21 (middle right), 25

111

After the dynamical equilibrium is reached, the modeled NBUC offshore of the

Potiguar Bight (Figure 4.28) presents realistic maximum velocities, but with a vertical

extent, from the surface to 3000 m, larger than indicated by observational studies. This

larger vertical extent yields a transport of of about 50 Sv, which is higher than most

estimates in the literature. The DWBC, on the other hand, presents realistic velocities

and transport, with a vertical extent matching the estimates from previous studies such as

Schott et al. (2002).

The mean PE, after stabilization of the kinetic energy (Figure 4.28), has a core

of 0.3 m.s?1 at 250 m, which is in agreement with the observations presented in chapters

2 and 3 . It extends from 50 to 550 m, with major and minor axes measuring 300 km and

140 km, respectively, which are also realistic according to the observations presented in

the previous chapters.

On the first few days of the run, a retroflection on the first 500 m of the water

column is developed. This retroflection remains present during the entire run, between the

surface and 500 m depth, as shown in Figure 4.30. At the surface, besides the retroflec-

tion, the signature of the NBUC can be seen, northward of 6oS. At 500 m, the flow is very

similar to the 200 m flow shown in Figure 4.25; the NBUC following its path northward

along the coast, with a retroflection on the northwest corner of the domain, after which

the current follows an eastward path paralel to the northern boundary. The flow after the

retroflection occasionally is disturbed by wave-like signals, which can generate recircula-

tions, as seen on Figure 4.30, lower panel and reported on observational data by Stramma

et al. (2005).

The flow field at 1000 m (Figure 4.31, top panel) shows the NBUC flowing

northward, with maximum velocities of about 0.2 m.s?1. At the northwest corner, this

current turns eastward and seems to permanently recirculate back into the NBUC at about

34 oW. On the rest of the domain there are no significant currents. At 2000 m (Figure 4.31,

bottom panel), the DWBC signature is present, with a realistic path southward, velocity

magnitudes and transport, in agreement with previous observational studies in the area (e.

g., Schott et al. (2002)).



112

Figure 4.27: Evolution of the temperature field over a cross-eddy section during Experi-

ment # 2 during days 1 (upper left), 7 (upper right), 13 ( middle left), 21 (middle right),

25 (lower left), and 121 (lower right).

The relevance of the vertical shear on the PE generation and maintenance is

investigated in this experiment. The analysis of Experiment # 1 results show that the PE

generation is independent of the presence of the DWBC. Now, we compare the results

from both experiments to assess the influence of the vertical shear induced by the DWBC

on the generation of the eddy.



113

Figure 4.28: Mean cros-section for Experiment # 2, over days 101-361.

We have seen from the detailed description of the eddy generation process in

both simulations that the mechanism for the eddy formation differ between the Experi-

ments. The horizontal evolution of the relative vorticity at 200 m (Figure 4.32) and the

cross-eddy relative vorticity profile at the same depth (Figure 4.33) during the first days

of Experiment # 2 show the process of generation of the PE through a relative vorticity

perspective. As during Experiment # 1, on the first day of the run there is just the rel-

ative vorticity gradient associated with the NBUC itself, with the positive patch closest

to the coast and the negative one, further away. The cross-eddy relative vorticity shows

the same bahavior; a positive patch near the coast, a sign inversion at the location of the

NBUC core, and a negative patch of relative vorticity further offshore. During the fol-

lowing few days, the field is disturbed, but not in the same way as in Experiment # 1;

no eddy-pinching is observed. The PE is formed by itself, without a dipole structure, on

the Potiguar Bight, and no northwest propagation is seen. Once the eddy is formed, this

feature becomes stationary in the area, with a cross-eddy relative vorticity profile similar

to that of Experiment # 1: a negative region close to the coast, representing the portion



114

4.28, different axis).

closest to the shore of the nearshore PE lobe; a positive relative vorticity region due to the

increase in (westward) velocities within the eddy, and, at the location of the NBUC core,

a sign inversion, followed by a negative patch associated with the decreasing (westward)

velocities in the northern direction.

4.5 Discussion

The Feature Oriented Regional Modeling System (FORMS) (GANGOPADHYAY

and ROBINSON, 2002) is a useful tool that can be applied in a forecasting framework as

well as in a process-study aproach. In this dissertation, we apply this methodology with

the latter approach, in a similar fashion as Calado et al. (2008); Soutelino et al. (2013).

We develop NBUC and DWBC Feature Models based on observational data and informa-

tion from the scientific literature in order to develop an initial field as realistic as possible

for our domain while filtering certain characteristics of the flow which, in spite of being

realistic, are not of fundamental importance for the process(es) of interest. After that, we

conducted experiments using the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS), similarly

to Soutelino et al. (2013).

Here we use the process-study approach to investigate the generation and main-

tenance of a frontal meander of the North Brazil Undercurrent off the northeastern tip of

South America. The initial field for the numerical experiments was developed based on

a number of observational studies in the area, as well as in situ data presented in the pre-

vious chapters. The developed Feature Models, for the NBUC as well as for the DWBC,

seemed to successfully capture the main attributes of the features of interest, being suit-

able for a process-study assessment of the main characteristics of the flow in the Potiguar

Bight.

After a long calibration procedure, stable configurations for the experiments

were reached, yielding realistic mean current speeds and transports, as well as current

width and location, according to extensive literature (e. g. Silveira et al. (1994); Schott et

al. (2002)). Therefore, we regard the model results as realistic, considering the process-

study aproach here employed. The PE was formed in both experiments, with maximum

velocity, core depth and size consistent with synoptic observations.

After the PE existence, stationarity and variability were adressed in the previous

chapters, we move on to numerical simulations using the process-study aproach in order to

examine the formation process of this feature. In this process-study approach we intended

to answer two questions. The first one was if the NBUC alone could generate the PE. Our

results from Experiment # 1 show that the PE is successfully reproduced by the dynamical



120

interaction between the parameterized NBUC and local topography. According to the

results, there is no absolute necessity of the DWBC for the PE to be generated.

The other question we addressed on this study was about how important the verti-

cal shear is on the generation of the PE, related to the existence of the DWBC. Our results

from Experiment # 1 indicate that the DWBC is not essential for the PE generation. How-

ever, the slight different characteristics of the eddy generated in each experiment suggest

that the shear induced by the DWBC does modify the PE configuration in comparison to

the NBUC-only set-up.

Based on the preliminary investigations of the model results presented here, we

propose to address a few more scientific issues with the robust numerical set up estab-

lished in this dissertation. These are identified below as four distinctively separate but

linked issues. First, we would like to establish the dominant mechanism of instability

for generation of the PE. From a first-order potential vorticity analysis (not presented)

of Experiment #1, it seems barotropic instability, where the pv changes sign across the

current (CUSHMAN-ROISIN and BECKERS, 2011) might be the dominant mechanism.

However, from Experiment # 2, the set-up of potential vorticity shows a possible con-

tribution towards modifying the strength and horizontal/vertical extent of the eddy from

a baroclinic shear (dv/dz) perspective between NBUC and DWBC. It is further interest-

ing to note the vertical extent of the simulated NBUC being deeper than observations.

This could be an effect of over-smoothing of the topography, or other numerical set-up

(mixing, resolution, missing flow structure?). We would also like to investigate the con-

tribution of topographic beta in forming the eddy in a meander-eddy-topography related

vorticity analysis, in evaluating and contributing each term of the vorticity balance equa-

tion of both of the experiments carried out so far.

Furthermore, the present set-up allows for changing the feature model param-

eters to modify the relative shear between NBUC and DWBC. Observational evidence

from Dangler et al. (2004) suggests that the DWBC might break up into eddies south of

8oS when the DWBC is of weaker transport in some seasons. Preliminary evidence of

eddy formation from the DWBC is noted from our simulations in Experiment # 2 south

of 8oS for a DWBC transport of 20 Sv. We would like to carry out a third experiment with



121

a DWBC transport of more than 25Sv (also observed at times) to investigate this issue.

Chapter 5

Summary and Conclusions

Over this study we were able to achieve the objectives set on Chapter 1, which

were:

• to characterize three-dimensionally the PE based on hydrographic and vessel-

mounted Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler data

In this dissertation we analyzed in situ and altimetry data, as well as numerical

model results, with the intent of describing the main characteristics of a subsurface frontal

meander of the NBUC centered at about 4 oS, 36.5 oW, hereafter Potiguar Eddy (PE). The

PE was first identified in synoptic cruises data, in VMADCP velocity fields. Here we

show, from these fields, that this feature was observed during two cruises in different

times of different years, suggesting a possibly stationary character. The synoptic data

served to characterize spatially and vertically the PE, specially considering its subsurface

character, which prevents the study of this feature through altimetric data. The Potiguar

Eddy is an elliptically shaped eddy, with major and minor axes of approximately 330 and

130 km, with a subsurface signature. It extends vertically from 100 m to 400 m, with

maximum velocities of 0.6 m.s?1 and recirculating about 2 Sv of waters from the NBUC.

As a frontal meander of the NBUC, the PE is assymetric, with a stronger and deeper-

reaching nortwestward (offshore) velocities lobe when compared to the southeastward

(nearshore) velocities one. It must be stressed that, being a subsurface feature, there is no

signature of the PE at surface near the shelf break; the surface velocity field is persistently

northwestward throughout the year.

• to assess the dynamical regime of the PE based on in situ synoptic data

After obtaining the general synoptic characteristics of the PE, we used the cruises

data to make an assessment of the dynamical regime of this feature. A simple calculation

of the Rossby and Burger numbers confirmed that the feature of interest is an anticyclone

with typical mesoscale characteristics; estimated Rossby number ? 0.3 and Burger num-

ber of ? 1, comparable to that estimated by Silveira et al. (2000) for the NBC retroflection

deep eddies at 5o N. Due to the dominant geostrophic balance in the PE, we also found

reasonable correspondence between geostrophic velocities within the eddy and global nu-

merical model outputs.

• to analyze the PE persistence/recurrence and its intraseasonal variability through

moored current data and altimetry data

After the synoptic description of the PE, we turn to the investigation of its vari-

ability and persistence. For that, we use currentmeter mooring data from two lines de-

ployed in the Potiguar Bight, with an 8-month and a 12-month long time series, which

confirmed the stationary character of the PE, with a slightly larger vertical extent than that

seen on the VMADCP velocity sections.

An EOF analysis of the variability of the moored velocity data revealed two im-

portant statistical modes of variability (EOFs); the first with high amplitudes over most of

the portion of the water column which corresponds to the PE, and the second, associated

with upper-layer processes. The amplitude time series of the first mode of variability is

found to have a distinct 25 to 35 day period of oscillation. In order to identify these os-

cillations, we project the dynamical modes onto the statistical ones, to find that the first

EOF is related with the second baroclinic mode. We then hypothesize that second-mode

baroclinic waves are reaching the Potiguar Bight and imposing variability of the vertical

extent of the PE by deepening and shoaling its lower limit. With the assumption that these

oscillations are due to westerward phase-propagating waves, we apply a finite-impulse-

response (FIR) filter to the altimetry data. The goal is to investigate the existence of

signals with periods coincident with the ones we found on the EOF amplitude time series.

The altimetry filtering revealed 34-day waves in the region, generated west of 15oW in



125

the Atlantic and propagating westward along 4oS. These waves are generated during the

month of June and reach the Potiguar Bight during September-December, corroborating

the high energy patches during these months found in the wavelet analysis conducted

on the amplitude time series of the first EOF. In order to further investigate the physical

nature this variability, we calculate the wave number from the dispersion equation for

second-mode baroclinic Rossby waves. As a result, we obtain the confirmation that the

35-day variability seen on the EOF amplitude time-series is associated with linear free

planetary Rossby waves about 800 km in length, and probably generated by barotropic

instability caused by the shear between different zonal currents in the Equatorial Current

system.

• To understand the processes involved on the PE persistence/recurrence through

longer time scales (semiannual and annual variabilities) via performing analysis of

global numerical model outputs

The limited duration of the currentmenter mooring velocity time series prevented

the investigation of longer-period variability. Considering that we had found reasonable

agreement between the synoptically-observed PE and global numerical model outputs,

we analyze the model outputs for lower-frequency variability. We found that the second

(first) numerical model statistical mode is associated with the first (second) EOF mode

from the observed mooring data. Fitting an annual signal to the amplitude time series,

we find that the surface-trapped mode (first EOF mode for model outputs, second EOF

mode for observed mooring data) has a strong component of annual period, confirming

our suspicions that the surface-trapped mode would be related to upper layer processes

and consequently to the trade winds annual cycle over the Atlantic. On the other hand,

the second EOF mode is associated with the deep structure variability, and therefore more

closely affecting the PE. For this second mode, the annual harmonic amplitude is virtually

negligle compared to the intraseasonal variability due to the planetary Rossby waves.

• To address the importance of the vertical shear due to the interaction with the

DWBC on the dynamics of the PE through idealized experiments, applying a Fea-

ture Model technique in a primitive-equation numerical model.



126

In order to develop insight into the PE generation, we apply the Feature Oriented

Regional Modeling System (FORMS) (GANGOPADHYAY and ROBINSON, 2002) tech-

nique within a process-study framework. The Feature Models for the NBUC and DWBC

were defined based on a number of observational studies in the region. The developed

Feature Models seemed to successfully capture the main attributes of the features of in-

terest, being suitable for a process-study assessment of the main characteristics of the flow

in the Potiguar Bight.

We set up two experiments, i. e., a NBUC-only set up, with a maximum depth

of 1500 m, and a NBUC+DWBC set up, with a maximum depth of 5500 m, in order

to investigate if (i) the PE would be generated in a velocity field which contained only

the NBUC, and (ii) which is the influence, if any, of the NBUC-DWBC shear for the

generation and maintenance of the eddy. After a long calibration procedure, stable con-

figurations for the experiments were reached, yielding realistic mean current speeds and

transports, as well as current width and location, according to extensive literature (e. g.

Silveira et al. (1994); Schott et al. (2002)). Therefore, we regard the model results as

realistic, considering the process-study aproach here employed. The Potiguar Eddy was

formed in both experiments, with maximum velocity, core depth and size consistent with

synoptic observations. As a result, we conclude that the PE can be generated in a velocity

field containing only the NBUC; and the DWBC - induced shear seems to play a part on

the eddy’s caracteristics (vertical extent, maximum velocities, etc), since the PE had a

different formation processes in each experiment.
