ABSTRACT. The importance of environmental monitoring is clear from the many oil spills that have occurred over the past three decades. This has encouraged
both companies and the public sector involved in the prevention and response to these accidents to develop efficient procedures to minimize the damage caused by

accidents involving oil spill. This study reviews the history of oil spill accidents in Brazil and examines how these events have contributed to the development of

technological research through partnerships involving oil companies, government, universities and research institutes, with the emphasis on the Amazon coastal zone.

As a result, environmental sensitivity indexes (ESIs) for oil spill have been developed specifically for the Amazon coast, where fluvial and marine processes take place

in the estuary of the world’s largest river system. Perspectives on research and emergency response procedures are presented, with the primary objective of conserving

the social-environmental diversity of the planet’s most important tropical region.

Keywords: environmental sensitivity index, ESI, remote sensing, oil spill, Amazon coastal zone.

8 ESI MAPPING OF OIL SPILL IN THE AMAZON COASTAL ZONE

INTRODUCTION

The importance of environmental monitoring has been emphasi-
zed by numerous oil spills that have occurred along the Brazilian
coast over the past few years. These accidents have encouraged
the oil companies and public sector to develop increasingly ef-
ficient procedures, both preventive and emergence response, in
order to minimize the damage caused by such events.

In 2000, more than 1300 m3 of fuel oil leaked from the rup-
ture of one of the transfer pipelines at the Duque de Caxias refinery
(REDUC) into Rio de Janeiro, Guanabara Bay (Bentz &amp;amp; Miranda,
2001). In July of the same year, a Petrobras pipeline fractured
at the Presidente Getu?lio Vargas refinery in Parana? state, causing
the spill of 3.7 million liters of crude oil into the Barigue river
(Carvalho, 2003). In 2001, the tanker “Miss Rondo?nia”, loaded
with approximately 1900 tons of type A1 oil, sank in the Para? ri-
ver near the Port of Vila do Conde, in the state of Para? (Berredo
et al., 2001).

These accidents have provoked fundamental changes in the
safety and environmental policies of Brazilian petroleum compa-
nies, in particular Petrobras, as a response to both their social
responsibility, and the heavy fines and compensation costs im-
posed by the courts, in response to these episodes. This shift
in perspective has resulted in increasing investment in measures
aimed at reducing emissions, residues, and effluents, in addition
to improvements in the procedures for prevention and control.
This has brought the objectives of the petroleum companies in-
creasingly in line with the Public anxieties and demands for so-
cially and environmentally responsible actions. This change in
attitude was consolidated by the production of maps of environ-
mental sensitivity to oil spill for a number of different sectors of
the Brazilian coast, including that of the Amazon region (Arau?jo et
al., 2006). A fundamentally important publication was the “Basic
Manual for the Elaboration of Maps of Environmental Sensitivity
to Oil Spills in the Petrobras System: Coastal and Estuarine Envi-
ronments” (Arau?jo et al., 2002).

In 2004, a project named PIATAM Mar was established to
evaluate the “Potential Environmental Impacts of the Transporta-
tion of Petroleum and its Derivatives in the Amazon Coastal Zone”
(Sales et al., 2004). The objective of the first phase of this project
(2004-2005) was the compilation of existing environmental and
social data, covering themes related to geology, oceanography,
fisheries, biology, tropical diseases, and socio-economic para-
meters. The second phase of the project (2006-2008) has concen-
trated on the development of a social and environmental diagnosis
of the areas surrounding ports where oil terminals are located, as

well as adjacent areas under their indirect influence, represented
by conservation units (protected areas).

The production of Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI)
charts must take into consideration the juxtaposition of the hy-
drological cycles of the rivers of the Amazon basin with the con-
figuration of local tides. The combination of these factors results
in at least 64 different scenarios, which must be considered in
the development of the environmental sensitivity maps which will
provide support for the development of contingency plans for the
Amazon coastal zone. The aim of the present paper is to review
the level of scientific and technological development that has gone
into the production of the ESI charts for the Amazon coastal zone,
providing the reader with a historical perspective of the stages
in the scientific development of this topic, which is so important
for the exploration and conservation of the coastal zone.

THE PAST

In the mid nineteen-seventies, scientists from the National Oce-
anic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the American
Coast Guard began to study and classify the sensitivity of coas-
tal environments to oil spill. This classification was based initi-
ally on the index of vulnerability to oil spills proposed by Gun-
dlach &amp;amp; Hayes (1978), which was determined by the physical
and geological characteristics of the coastal pipeline (ARPEL,
1997). Based on a study of five oil spills, the coastal environ-
ments were classified according to a 10-item scale of sensitivity,
from which a hierarchy of 1 to 10 was defined, referring to increa-
sing vulnerability according to the type of coastline (Gundlach &amp;amp;
Hayes, 1978).

This Vulnerability Index became the standard for coastal ma-
nagement, planning and research into the effects of oil spills on
different types of coastline. Over time, this index evolved and was
modified, leading eventually to the development of the Environ-
mental Sensitivity Index (ESI).

From this moment onwards, ESI charts have been an integral
component of response and contingency planning for oil spills.
The first ESI chart was produced in a matter of days, in 1979, in
response to the advance and impending coastal landing of the oil
slick resulting from the blowout of the IXTOC 1 well in the Gulf of
Mexico (NOAA, 2002).

In the nineteen-eighties, ARPEL (Asociacio?n Regional de Em-
presas de Petro?leo y Gas Natural en Latinoame?rica y el Caribe)
produced an innovative ESI atlas for the whole coast of the Uni-
ted States, including Alaska and the Great Lakes, to be used for
the planning of contingency measures in response to oil spills

(ARPEL, 1997). Prior to 1989, these atlases were, however, a two-
dimensional representation of a three-dimensional world, with all
the information printed in color on paper maps, which had a li-
mited distribution due to high production costs. Obviously, these
maps were not only difficult to produce, but in particular to up-
date, especially in comparison with the digital maps available in
the present day. Given this, the ESI atlas has been generated
from digital data bases by a Geographic Information System (GIS)
since 1989.

In Brazil, the first ESI chart was produced only in 1993, by
Petrobras. It covered the company’s exploration and production
areas in the Campos Basin. In 1996, ARPEL promoted a work-
shop, during which it recommended the use of a standard sys-
tem for the production of ESI chart by the different petroleum
companies (Arau?jo et al., 2002). The ESI scale adopted during
this workshop was modified from the NOAA proposal, based on
Gundlach &amp;amp; Hayes (1978), to include both biological and social
parameters, and the adaptation of these parameters to the reality
of local conditions (Michel et al., 1978).

THE PRESENT

On December 12th, 2001, the Brazilian National Environ-
ment Council (CONAMA) published its Resolution number 293,
which defined the minimum parameters for individual emergency
plans for dealing with oil pollution in ports, dockings or termi-
nals, pipelines, platforms, and their respective support installati-
ons. This document provides specific instructions for the deve-
lopment of each plan considering, among others factors, the seri-
ous oil spill that have occurred in the country, and the urgent need
for the establishment of guidelines and effective response proce-
dures for incidents involving oil pollution. Given this, the resolu-
tion requires that, whenever possible, the analysis of vulnerability
be based on the information available in ESI charts, produced ac-
cording to the relevant technical norms and specifications. The
localization of the vulnerable areas should be indicated clearly
on diagrams and maps, drawn up on an appropriate scale, with
clear labels.

Resolution 293 led to the acceleration of the production of
ESI charts in the country, and an increasing demand for the es-
tablishment of specific methods for their development. In 2002,
Petrobras published its “Basic Manual for the Elaboration of Maps
of Environmental Sensitivity to Oil Spills in the Petrobras Sys-
tem” (Arau?jo et al., 2002). This publication is a benchmark for
the production of ESI charts in Brazil, as well as for the develop-
ment of research into the evaluation of the environmental sensi-
tivity of the Brazilian coastline, which stretches from the Amazon

zone (?4?N) to the lagoons in the southernmost extreme of the
country (?35?S).

In 2002, the Northern-Northeastern Cooperative Network
for the Environmental Monitoring of Areas under the Influence
of the Petroleum Industry (Rede 5 – PETROMAR, FINEP/CNPq/
PETROBRAS; http://www.geopro.ufrn.br/rede05/), led by the Fe-
deral University of Rio Grande do Norte, was created through a
FINEP (Studies and Projects Financier) research initiative. This
cooperative network is arbitrated by Petrobras, through its Re-
search and Development Center (CENPES), and its Exploration
and Production Business Units in Rio Grande do Norte and
Ceara? (UN-RNCE), Bahia (UN-BA), and (at the time) Para? (UN-
PA), in addition to its Northeastern Lubricants and Petroleum
Derivatives Unit (LUBNOR). PETROMAR created an organizati-
onal structure for the exchange of information, knowledge and
experts, training and scientific specialization, research, and the
collection and divulgation of new findings, which allowed its par-
ticipants to identify, evaluate, and eliminate or minimize the ne-
gative effects of the activities of the petroleum and natural gas
industries in the Brazilian North and Northeast. PETRORISCO,
one of the projects of the PETROMAR network, introduced the
application of multitemporal ESI maps for areas under meso- and
macrotide regime. This resulted in the production of ESI charts,
with the collaboration of the PIATAM Mar project, for a number of
sectors of the northern and northeastern coasts of Brazil.

In 2002, the Secretariat for Environmental Quality, Coastal
and Marine Management of the Brazilian Environment Ministry
(MMA) published its “Technical Specifications for the Elabora-
tion of Environmental Sensitivity Charts for Oil Spills” with re-
ference to the coastal and marine zones of the country (MMA,
2002). This publication was based on the manual of Arau?jo et
al. (2002) and currently regulates the norms for the production
and publication of ESI charts in Brazil. In 2004, it was published
the ESI Atlas of Ceara? and Potiguar maritime basin (MMA, 2004).

As of 2006, Petrobras had published 23 ESI charts, cove-
ring 19 coastal and two fluvial terminals, and its marine activi-
ties in Sergipe and Alagoas. This initiative was coordinated by
CENPES and involved universities, research institutions and en-
vironmental organizations (Arau?jo et al., 2006). Some 150 re-
searchers participated in the project, which covered the whole
of the Brazilian coastline, from north to south, as well as two
sectors of the Amazon basin. These publications are based on
the NOAA methods, which according to the ARPEL manual, have
been adopted in many different parts of the world. In 2007, MMA
published the ESI Atlas of the Santos Maritime Basin (Gherardi
&amp;amp; Cabral, 2007).

10 ESI MAPPING OF OIL SPILL IN THE AMAZON COASTAL ZONE

The PIATAM Mar project

Petrobras has long been working to comprehend the Amazonian
environment as a whole. It has been investing in the develop-
ment of technological tools and processes to support local mo-
nitoring and environmental management through the projects PI-
ATAM (www.piatam.ufam.edu.br), Cognitus (www.cognitus.org),
LABCOG (www.lamce.ufrj.br/grva/data/labcogsdk), PIATAM Mar
(www.piatammar.ufpa.br), and PIATAM Oceano (www.igeo.uff.br/
piatamoceano). This project focuses on the development of the
infrastructure and it is led by the Federal University of Para?
(UFPA), Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) and CENPES,
and involves other nine Amazonian institutions. This initiative led
to the consolidation of a network of researchers who are active in
the Amazon coastal zone, developing important scientific studies
in a number of different fields of expertise.

The implementation of Phase I of the PIATAM Mar project
was characterized by the compilation of the environmental data
and other information available on the Amazon coastal zone,
which resulted in an integrated overview of current knowledge
of this region. A total of 3014 references were obtained, all of
which were catalogued in a bibliographic data base, which culmi-
nated in the publication of the book “Bibliography of the Amazon
Coastal Zone: Brazil” (Souza Filho et al., 2005a). An additional
result worth of comment was the development of a computatio-
nal system for the management of the data base, built using the
MYSQL language. This system permits a continuous feed of the
social-environmental information in a rapid and secure fashion
(Souza, 2005). This also allowed the generation of the concep-
tual bases necessary for the development of a geographic in-
formation system (SIGmar), which provides a data base for the
production of ESI charts.

The PIATAM Mar project is based on an innovative scientific
concept, in which remote sensing, GIS and cartography combine
to form a three-way spatial reference (Fig. 1) for the physical (e.g.
Physics, Chemistry, Geology), biological (e.g. Botany, Zoology),
and social (Geography, Sociology and Anthropology) sciences
(Jensen et al., 1998; Jensen, 2000). These different mapping pro-
cedures all use techniques or tools that represent practical appli-
cations of mathematical concepts. Remote sensing permits the
extraction of information from digital images which contain data
on the radiation reflected, emitted or backscattered by specific tar-
gets on the Earth’s surface, using specially-developed algorithms
(Fussel et al., 1986; Dahlberg &amp;amp; Jensen, 1986). This approach
exists harmoniously alongside other techniques for the collec-
tion of orbital data, and other mapping science tools, such as GIS
and cartography. The term GIS refers to computational systems

used for the treatment of geographic data, which integrate alpha-
numeric data bases with the spatial representation of real world
entities. In fact, GIS is a highly-specialized information system,
which combines cartography and the digital processing of images
for the spatial analysis of information (Burrough, 1986). As Fisher
&amp;amp; Lindenberg (1989) have pointed out, these sub-disciplines of
the mapping sciences not only provide a baseline for knowledge
and intellectual activity, but also a spatial orientation tool for the
analysis of physical, biological, and social data (Fig. 1).

and cartographic approaches to mapping, and their relationships with the physi-

Lindenberg (1989) and Jensen (2000).

The general aim of PIATAM Mar is to generate ESI charts as
an operational alternative for the monitoring and mapping of the
Amazon coastal zone. These charts have been developed through
a Geographic Information System, called SIGmar. The results of
this initiative will provide guidelines for the use of the InfoPAE
(Computerized Emergency Action Plan Support) System on the
Amazon coast. For this, a number of specific aims must be fulfil-
led, as described below:

1. Develop and implement a geographic information sys-
tem (SIGmar), linked to a social-environmental data base;

2. Produce ESI charts of the study areas at stra-
tegic (1:250,000), tactical (1:50,000), and operational
(1:10,000) scales;

3. Conduct a spatial analysis of the available data and stu-
dies from the areas of oceanographic geology, chemis-
try and physics, social-environmental studies, biology
(birds and vegetation), archeology, and tropical diseases
(malaria);

4. Evaluate and test methodological protocols for the collec-
tion and systematic analysis of social-environmental data,

effective for the monitoring of the Amazon coastal zone;

5. Generate possible scenarios of oil dispersion for the
northern coast of Brazil;

6. Store the social-environmental data collected during
these excursions in the geographical data base of the
PIATAM Mar project (SIGmar).

The Amazon coastal zone setting

The coastal zone of the Brazilian Amazon is located between Tu-
bara?o Point in the state of Maranha?o (4?S, 43?W) and Cape
Orange, in Amapa? (5?N, 51?W), encompassing the entire coas-
tline of the states of Amapa? and Para?, and the western half of
that of Maranha?o (Fig. 2). Overall, this zone extends along some
2250 km, measured on a 1:2,500,000 scale map, not counting
the many inlets, islands and small estuaries, which punctuate the
coastline (Souza Filho et al., 2005b). This coastal plain, charac-
terized by flat sandy estuaries and extensive mudflats, is limited
to the east by the aeolian deposits of the Lenc?o?is Maranhenses
dune system (Floriani et al., 2004), and extends north and west
through the Guyanas to the Orinoco delta in Venezuela (Gonthier
et al., 2002).

As part of the Coastal Ecosystem biome (Arruda, 2001), this
region is considered to be important for the conservation of the
Brazilian coastline biodiversity, and is characterized by an acute
lack of information and by the intensity of anthropogenic pres-
sures from human occupation (Fundac?a?o BIO-RIO, 2002). In any
discussion of the marine or coastal processes of the Amazon Co-
astal Zone (ACZ), it is necessary to place its principal hydro-
graphic basins into their proper perspective. These include the
Amazon, the Araguaia-Tocantins, and the smaller coastal rivers,
which together drain an area of approximately 8,127,000 km2,
and carry sediments, nutrients and all kinds of organic material
(dissolved, particulate and organisms) into the ACZ. This means
that the ACZ is the final destination of millions of tons of sedi-
ments and nutrients each year, carried by millions of cubic meters
of water draining from an area the size of Australia (Souza Filho et
al., 2005a).

The ACZ is located in a meso- to macrotidal area, in which
tide amplitudes vary from 2 to 8 meters. The region is also cha-
racterized by the largest continuous tract of mangrove forest found
anywhere in the world. It is located in a low-lying area, characte-
rized by a high density of drainage and active processes of ero-
sion, sedimentation and neotectonics (Souza Filho, 2005). Where
macrotides are present, the area of flooded mangrove – an envi-
ronment extremely sensitive to oil spills – may extend for up to

30 km inland, and the estuaries themselves as much as 80 km
(Souza Filho, 2005). All of these characteristics contribute to the
unique nature of the ACZ, and emphasize the need for adequate
research to guarantee its conservation both in the present and
far into the future.

ESI charts as oil spill guidelines for the Amazon
coastal zone

The combination of the hydrological cycle of the Amazonian ri-
vers, with local tide cycles, results in at least 64 distinct environ-
mental scenarios for the development of the ESI charts necessary
for the implementation of effective contingency plans for the coas-
tal zone. The temporal variation in these tidal and fluvial processes
is illustrated in Figure 3.

The estimated long-term average freshwater discharge of the
Amazon river is of the order of 134,000 m3/s (68% of Brazi-
lian drainage basin), while that of the Araguaia-Tocantins system
is 11,000 m3/s. A large part of this discharge – 71,527 m3/s –
originates in the countries neighboring Brazil (ANA, 2002). Its
mean annual discharge of 6.3 trillion m3 represents approxima-
tely 16% of all the freshwater deposited in the world’s oceans
(Oltman, 1968). Peak discharge, with a mean of approximately
220 thousand m3/s (Fig. 3), normally occurs in May, whereas the
minimum, of around 100 thousand m3/s is usually in November
(Richey et al., 1986; Nittrouer et al., 1995). Therefore, the ACZ is
strongly influenced by Amazon river processes.

The different tidal scenarios, varying from meso- (amplitude
of 2–4 m) to macrotidal (amplitude &gt; 4 m) are represented by the
16 combinations described below, and illustrated in Figure 4:

The combination of these four fluvial scenarios with the 16
tidal phases results in a total of 64 simplified environmental sce-
narios for the Amazon coastal zone, all of which must be analy-
zed in the construction of the ESI charts. In addition to the flu-
vial discharge and tides, the local climate is affected primarily by
the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), the position of which
fluctuates considerably between seasons. In August-September,
the ITCZ is typically located at 14?N (Fig. 5), whereas by March-
April, it migrates southward to 2?S, defining the dry and wet
seasons, respectively. Secondarily, other factors control the pre-
cipitation in the region (REF). Furthermore, El-Nin?o and La-Nin?a
cycles are responsible, in part, by changes in the precipitation in
the Amazon region. Normally, almost 73% of the region’s an-
nual precipitation falls between January and April, whereas at
the peak of the dry season, between September and November,
rainfall can be almost negligible.

Human occupation of the Amazon coastal zone

Brazil presents considerable demographic disparities (Fig. 6),
characterized by a major contrast between the Amazon region and
the rest of the country. In addition, in both the Amazon and all
other regions, coastal areas tend to be more densely populated
than those further inland (Mello, 2002; Kampel, 2004; Jayme Jr.
&amp;amp; Crocco, 2005).

Even in coastal regions, however, considerable gaps can be
observed. On the Amazon coast, there is a close relationship
between the distribution of the population, and the transport
network, which is the principal conduit of human colonization in
the region (Jayme Jr. &amp;amp; Crocco, 2005).

Overall, population density in Brazil tends to decline from
east to west. This reflects the general pattern of colonization that
begun on the coast, and progressed landward (Melo, 2002). Den-
sities are very low – between 0.09 and 15 inhabitants per km2

– throughout most of the Amazon basin, except for the major
urban centers (Manaus, Bele?m and Sa?o Lu??s), where it rises to
11–35 inhabitants per km2 (www.ibge.gov.br/censo).

The Amazon coastal zone is characterized mainly by muni-
cipalities with relatively small populations, most of which are
between 10 and 25 thousand inhabitants (Fig. 7). In the coas-
tal region of the state of Amapa?, most municipalities have even
smaller populations, of less than 10 thousand inhabitants. Only
Bele?m and Sa?o Lu??s, capitals of the states of Para? and Maranha?o,
respectively, have populations of over one million inhabitants.

Operational risks of oil spills

The increasing operational safety applied to the exploration, pro-
duction, and transportation of petroleum and its products by the
petroleum companies over the past few years has led to a consi-
derable reduction in the risk of accidents. Despite this, however,
some disasters have still occurred, and the damage sustained per-
sists as a serious threat to coastal areas.

It has been estimated that at least 4.5 million tons of oil is spil-
led each year worldwide. The principal causes are tanker cleaning
operations and accidents occurring during the transportation of
fuel (ESA, 1998). The Amazon estuary is obviously at considera-
ble risk from the latter phenomenon.

The ports of the coastal states of the Amazon involved in the
transportation and storage of petroleum and its derivatives repre-
sent the areas with the highest risk of such incidents, as the most
likely locations of oil spills. These locations include the ports of
Santana, in Amapa?, and Itaqui, in Maranha?o, as well as the Outeiro
and Miramar terminals and the Vila do Conde port, all located in
the state of Para? (Fig. 8). The protected areas adjacent to these
ports (Fig. 2) are considered to be under their indirect influence.
In the PIATAM Mar project, these conservation units are treated
as control areas, given both their well-preserved conditions and
their proximity to transportation routes (Fig. 9). These areas are
the Lago Piratuba Biological Reserve in Amapa?, the Soure Marine
Sustainable Exploitation Reserve in Para?, and the Ilha dos Caran-
guejos Environmental Protection Area, in Maranha?o (Fig. 2).

Production of ESI charts

Areas considered sensitive to oil spills are those with the greatest
biological and social-environmental risks. In these areas, the ade-
quate application of contingency measures results in a reduction

in contamination, thereby mitigating impacts on the environment.
In this scenario, ESI charts are essential for the most efficient
application of the available response resources, making the clean-
up operation more effective.

(E) Port of Itaqui. For geographic location, see Figure 2. Based on Ikonos images acquired in 2007.

In the PIATAM Mar project, the ESI charts are produced
according to NOAA (2002) procedures, with adaptations appro-
priate to the specific conditions of the Amazon coastal zone. The
remote sensing products used in the creation of these documents
are as follows:

• ESI charts in strategic scale (1:250,000) of the whole
Amazon coastal zone based on the processing of RADAR-
SAT-1 Wide 1 images and mosaics of JERS-1 SAR and
SRTM images, with spatial resolution of 30 m, 90 m, and
90 m, respectively;

• ESI charts in tactical scale (1:50,000) of the protected

areas based on the processing of RADARSAT-1 Wide 1,
Landsat TM and ETM+, and CBERS-2 images, with spatial
resolution of 30 m, 30 m, 15 m, and 20 m, respectively;

• ESI charts in tactical scale (1:10,000) of the port areas
based on the processing of Ikonos images, with a spatial
resolution of 1 m.

ESI charts will be produced in the SIGmar geographic infor-
mation system (Costa et al., 2005) and will be used in associa-
tion with a social-environmental data base (Souza, 2005; Costa et
al., 2005; Castro et al., 2006). This system was modeled in three
modules, as follows:

• Monitoring Module: processing of Synthetic Aperture
Radar (SAR) and optical images for the identification of
possible oil spills, as well as the classification of the coas-
tal environments, the construction of oceanographic mo-
dels of the study areas to support the production of sen-
sitivity maps, and the feeding of information into the data
base via internet;

• Evaluation Module: identification of possible oil spills in
the SAR images using PCI Geomatica 9.1 software tools to
determine the exact geographic coordinates (latitude and
longitude) of the possible spillage. A variety of thematic
maps will be generated in ArcGIS 9.0 software to attend
to the requirements of the system. These maps provide a
more reliable assessment of risks and potential damage,
on which the more efficient coordination of oil spill pre-
vention operations can be based;

• Report Module: three classes of report are generated.
Class A reports are very detailed, and are designed to pro-
vide the authorities responsible for clean-up operations
with the information they need; the briefer class B reports
are destined for the Media. By contrast, class C reports are
provided to local organizations that may be affected by the
oil spill.

ESI for the Amazon coastal zone

The ESI scale classifies coastal environments according to their
relative sensitivity to oil spills, taking into consideration natu-
ral, physical and biological processes. This scale was developed
on the basis of prior experience with actual oil spills, as well as
fieldwork in each type of environment. The classification is thus
based on a comprehensive understanding of the environment,
including the relationships between physical processes and the
substrate, which produce specific types of environment, and per-
mit the prediction of the ways in which the spilt oil may behave
and move (MMA, 2002).

In addition, the unique complexities of the Amazon basin,
in terms of both the dynamics of environmental (sedimentary,
geomorphological, oceanographic and biological) processes, and
the importance and fragility of this rich ecosystem, demand the
development of a specific approach, which takes the intricacy of
local variations in account. From this perspective, Souza Filho et
al. (2004) proposed an ESI classification for the Amazon coastal
zone (Tab. 1) based on a modification of the proposals of NOAA
(2002) and Arau?jo et al. (2002). Subsequently, Gonc?alves (2005),
Gonc?alves et al. (2006), Teixeira (2006), Boulhosa (2006), Al-
meida (2008), Boulhosa &amp;amp; Souza Filho (2009) and Teixeira &amp;amp;
Souza Filho (2009), followed this adaptation in order to map a

THE FUTURE

The principal objective of the PIATAM Mar project is the forma-
tion of a data base which organizes systematically all the social
and environmental information available for the Amazon coastal
zone. It is expected that these data can be mapped and cross-
referenced in such a way as to generate new types of information
for the production of ESI charts.

Social-environmental data will be collected during joint sci-
entific expeditions, in which they will be integrated with the col-
lection of abiotic (geology, chemistry, geomorphology and ocea-
nography, physics), biological (birds, fish, benthic fauna, plank-
ton), and tropical disease (malaria) data in order to achieve the
best possible understanding of the environment as a whole. The
mapping of these data will be essential, and to this end, the long-
term availability and acquisition of remote sensing imagery will
be fundamentally important.

Perspectives of the new remote sensor data

Up to 1991, the available orbital remote sensing data with glo-
bal coverage were of the multi-spectral electro-optical type (which
operates in the visible electromagnetic and the infrared spectra)
such as, for example, the NOAA (AVHRR) low spatial resolution
(1.1 km) sensors, and the moderate spatial resolution (10–30 km)
Landsat series (MSS, TM and ETM+), SPOT (HRV and HRVIR) and
CBERS (CCD) sensors, which provide images that are extremely
affected by the presence of cloud cover, which is almost always
present in the equatorial region. During the nineteen-nineties,
new microwave sensors (Synthetic Aperture Radar – SAR), e.g.
ERS 1 and 2, JERS-1, and RADARSAT-1, were launched. Given
their long wavelengths (5.6, 23, and 5.6 cm, respectively), these
systems allow images to be acquired under unfavorable climatic
conditions. It is important to remember here that all these types of
sensor provide low to moderate spatial resolution. Electro-optical
images from high spatial resolution (4 m or less) sensors such as
Ikonos, Quickbird, and SPOT 5 (HRG), were only available com-
mercially from 1999 onwards. Multi-spectral sensors of low to
medium spatial resolution, such as the MODIS sensors on the
TERRA and AQUA satellites, nevertheless provide imaging on an
almost daily basis, which is extremely useful for the monitoring
of the dynamics of the Amazon coastline.

Low to medium spatial resolution sensors have been used
for the production of strategic scale (1:250,000) ESI charts, while
those at a tactical scale (1:50,000) have been derived from ima-
gery of moderate resolution. High resolution images are only ne-
cessary for the production of ESI charts at the operational level
(scale of 1:10,000).

Given the electro-optical characteristics of the high reso-
lution sensors, operational ESI charts can only be produced
during the driest part of the year, which is June to Novem-
ber in the Amazon coastal zone. During the rest of the year,
cloud cover is extensive, due to the positioning of the inter-
tropical convergence zone (ITCZ). This limitation can neverthe-
less be overcome by the use of airborne sensors, such as
CENSIPAM’s SAR-R99B, although, like all airborne equipment,
the operational logistics of this system is complex, and it is
not always possible to acquire data during the required period.
The use of SAR technology in the reconnaissance and map-
ping of coastal environments expanded considerably following
the launches of the ALOS satellite (www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/)
in 2006, and RADARSAT-2 (www.radarsat2.info/) and Terra-
SAR (www.lsespace.com/missions/terrasar.php) in 2007. This
promising orbital panorama was further diversified by the an-

nouncement, in 2007, of the technical viability of the orbital
Multi-Application Purpose Synthetic Aperture Radar (MAPSAR),
to be constructed by a Brazilian-German consortium (Schro?der
et al., 2005).

Strategic partnerships between universities,
research institutes and companies

The eventual integration of orbital imaging and field data will per-
mit the implementation of an observation system for the moni-
toring of the lower Amazon basin and adjacent coastal zone, for
which remote sensing can be considered to be the only source of
data adequate for the systematic supply of information in multi-
ple scales of time and space (Souza Filho et al., 2005b, 2006).
The most effective path to the development of this system would
appear to depend on the establishment of partnerships between
universities, research institutions and companies, in alliance with
the entities responsible for the social-environmental management
of the region, as well as the productive sector, such as petroleum
companies and port authorities.

In this context, Petrobras has fostered strategic institutional
alliances with the following objectives:

(i) systematic establishment of partnerships with universi-
ties, research institutions, governments, investors, eco-
nomic agencies, social entities, communities and other
groups of interest to the region’s petroleum and natural gas
sectors;

(ii) stimulation of scientific output and improvement of infra-
structure in local universities and research institutions, as
a basis for the training and fixing of human resources in
the Amazon basin;

(iii) consolidation of strategic partnerships in the region, and

(iv) acquisition and analysis of social-environmental data es-
sential for the development of studies of environmental
impact in the Amazon Region.

These initiatives will encorage:

(i) production of ESI maps for oil spills, with multi-temporal
information;

(ii) expansion of the use of GIS technology in association with
social-environmental data bases containing information
from different seasons, and

CONCLUDING REMARKS

The Amazon coastal zone presents a unique set of characteris-
tics, including the estuary of the world’s largest river system and
its most ample tract of continuous mangrove forest, as well as
a macrotidal system and annual rainfall in excess of 2500 mm.
The combination of these factors results in a dramatically dynamic
geomorphological scenario that encompasses a variety of tempo-
ral and spatial scales. Given this diversity, a single map of the
vulnerability of local coastal environments to oil spill incidents
would be inadequate. Clearly, it is necessary to update such maps
on a regular – seasonal and yearly – basis, in accordance with the
spatial dynamic of the region. The production of ESI charts for the
Amazon coastal zone is thus a considerable challenge, which re-
quires the systematic use of orbital remote sensing data, GIS data
analysis, and field investigation of remote areas.
