RESUMO 

Alterações na qualidade do solo devido a mudança de uso da terra para expansão da 

cana-de-açúcar no Brasil 

 

Globalmente, o aumento da demanda de biocombustíveis têm intensificado a taxa de 

mudança de uso da terra (MUT) para expansão da produção de culturas para fins energéticos. 

No Brasil, a área de cana-de-açúcar aumentou 35% (3,2 Mha) na última década. A expansão 

do cultivo de cana-de-açúcar tem resultado em pastagens extensivas sendo submetidas a 

intensiva mecanização e ao uso de agroquímicos, implicando diretamente na qualidade do 

solo (QS). A hipótese testada nesse estudo foi que a MUT resulta na degradação da QS. Para 

tanto foi conduzido um estudo em três locais na região centro-sul, com objetivo de avaliar as 

modificações na QS devido a principal sequência de MUT (vegetação nativa - pastagem - 

cana-de-açúcar) associada a expansão do cultivo de cana-de-açúcar no Brasil. Em cada uso da 

terra, amostras indeformadas e deformadas de solo foram coletadas nas profundidades de 0-

10, 10-20 e 20-30 cm. Os atributos químicos e físicos do solo foram mensurados através de 

análises laboratoriais e à campo. Dados de atributos biológicos também foram incluídos no 

estudo. Inicialmente, os efeitos da MUT foram quantificados individualmente para cada um 

dos atributos do solo, e em seguida as alterações na QS global foram avaliadas através da Soil 

Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) e de seis índices de QS (IQS), desenvolvidos 

usando métodos com complexidade crescente. Os resultados demonstraram que a conversão 

da vegetação nativa em pastagem extensiva resultou na acidificação do solo, redução dos 

teores de carbono orgânico (COS) e macronutrientes (especialmente P), e severa compactação 

do solo, desequilibrando a relação entre ar e água e aumentando a resistência mecânica do 

solo ao crescimento radicular. Conversão da pastagem em cana-de-açúcar melhorou a 

qualidade química do solo através da correção da acidez e aumento dos macronutrientes. 

Apesar dessas melhorias, prolongado período de cultivo de cana-de-açúcar reduziu os teores 

de COS; e a maioria do P adicionado via fertilizantes acumulou em formas menos lábeis, 

confirmando o importante papel do P orgânico no fornecimento de P disponível às plantas em 

solos brasileiros. O cultivo de cana-de-açúcar teve impactos negativos nos atributos físicos do 

solo menos intensos do que aqueles gerados pelo uso com pastagem. Embora o preparo do 

solo para plantio e reforma da cana-de-açúcar reduziu a compactação do solo, os dados 

sugeriram que estes efeitos são de curta duração, ocorrendo a reconsolidação do solo e o 

aumento dos riscos de erosão ao longo do tempo. As alterações físicas do solo induzidas pela 

MUT foram detectadas tanto por meio de atributos quantitativos quanto por meio de avaliação 

visual da estrutura do solo (VESS), um método simples e diretamente aplicado no campo. A 

SMAF detectou eficientemente as alterações na QS devido a MUT. Além disso, todos os IQS 

desenvolvidos permitiram ranquear corretamente a QS entre os usos da terra. Assim, 

recomendamos que IQS mais simples e com melhor relação custo-benefício usando poucos 

indicadores chaves, tais como: pH, P, K, VESS e COS com ponderação proporcional entre os 

setores do solo (químico, físico e biológico) sejam usados como protocolo para avaliar a QS 

nas áreas de produção de cana-de-açúcar. Os resultados obtidos usando a SMAF e os IQS 

sugeriram que a conversão da vegetação nativa em pastagem extensiva reduziu a QS, 

degradando indicadores químicos, físicos e biológicos. Por outro lado, a conversão de 

pastagem em cana-de-açúcar não teve impactos na QS global, uma vez que a melhoria dos 

atributos químicos compensou os impactos negativos nos indicatores físicos e biológicos. 

Desta forma, esses resultados poderão ser utilizados como base científica pelos produtores, 

extencionistas e políticos para orientar estratégias de manejo que mantenham e/ou melhorem 

a QS e consequentemente a sustentabilidade da produção de cana-de-açúcar no Brasil.

ABSTRACT 

Soil quality responses to land-use change for sugarcane expansion in Brazil 

 

Globally, increasing demands for biofuels have intensified the rate of land-use change 

(LUC) for expansion of bioenergy crops. In Brazil, the world’s largest sugarcane-ethanol 

producer, sugarcane area has expanded by 35% (3.2 Mha) in the last decade. Sugarcane 

expansion has resulted in extensive pastures being subjected to intensive mechanization and 

large inputs of agrochemicals, which have direct implications on soil quality (SQ). We 

hypothesized that LUC to support sugarcane expansion leads to overall SQ degradation. To 

test this hypothesis we conducted a field-study at three sites in the central-southern region, to 

assess the SQ response to the primary LUC sequence (i.e., native vegetation to pasture to 

sugarcane) associated to sugarcane expansion in Brazil. At each land use site undisturbed and 

disturbed soil samples were collected from the 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm depths. Soil 

chemical and physical attributes were measured through on-farm and laboratory analyses. A 

dataset of soil biological attributes was also included in this study. Initially, the LUC effects 

on each individual soil indicator were quantified. Afterward, the LUC effects on overall SQ 

were assessed using the Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF). Furthermore, six 

SQ indexes (SQI) were developed using approaches with increasing complexity. Our results 

showed that long-term conversion from native vegetation to extensive pasture led to soil 

acidification, significant depletion of soil organic carbon (SOC) and macronutrients 

[especially phosphorus (P)] and severe soil compaction, which creates an unbalanced ratio 

between water- and air-filled pore space within the soil and increases mechanical resistance to 

root growth. Conversion from pasture to sugarcane improved soil chemical quality by 

correcting for acidity and increasing macronutrient levels. Despite those improvements, most 

of the P added by fertilizer accumulated in less plant-available P forms, confirming the key 

role of organic P has in providing available P to plants in Brazilian soils. Long-term 

sugarcane production subsequently led to further SOC depletions. Sugarcane production had 

slight negative impacts on soil physical attributes compared to pasture land. Although tillage 

performed for sugarcane planting and replanting alleviates soil compaction, our data 

suggested that the effects are short-term with persistent, reoccurring soil consolidation that 

increases erosion risk over time. These soil physical changes, induced by LUC, were detected 

by quantitative soil physical properties as well as by visual evaluation of soil structure 

(VESS), an on-farm and user-friendly method for evaluating SQ. The SMAF efficiently 

detected overall SQ response to LUC and it could be reliably used under Brazilian soil 

conditions. Furthermore, since all of the SQI values developed in this study were able to rank 

SQ among land uses. We recommend that simpler and more cost-effective SQI strategies 

using a small number of carefully chosen soil indicators, such as: pH, P, K, VESS and SOC, 

and proportional weighting within of each soil sectors (chemical, physical and biological) be 

used as a protocol for SQ assessments in Brazilian sugarcane areas. The SMAF and SQI 

scores suggested that long-term conversion from native vegetation to extensive pasture 

depleted overall SQ, driven by decreases in chemical, physical and biological indicators. In 

contrast, conversion from pasture to sugarcane had no negative impacts on overall SQ, mainly 

because chemical improvements offset negative impacts on biological and physical indicators. 

Therefore, our findings can be used as scientific base by farmers, extension agents and public 

policy makers to adopt and develop management strategies that sustain and/or improving SQ 

and the sustainability of sugarcane production in Brazil.

1 INTRODUCTION 

 

 

Land-use change (LUC) processes have transformed a large portion of the planet’s 

land surface, affecting directly the land capacity for provisioning ecosystem services (FOLEY 

et al., 2005). Increasing global demand to support bioenergy feedstock production has 

intensified LUC worldwide [(e.g., South America (LAPOLA et al., 2010; GODEMBERG et 

al., 2014), North America (WRIGHT; WIMBERLY, 2013), Europe (FISCHER et al., 2010), 

Asia (MUKHERJEE; SOVACOOL, 2014), Africa (GASPARATOS et al., 2015), Australia 

(GRUNDY et al., 2016)]. Globally, a gross land demand for bioenergy ranging from 50 to 

200 Mha by 2050 was projected by Woods et al. (2015). Direct LUC refers to changes in land 

use that occur where bioenergy feedstock production becomes established, and generally 

includes both conversion from food or fiber production (including crop rotation patterns, 

conversion of pasture land, and changes in forest management) and conversion of natural 

ecosystems (KARP et al., 2015). Current LUC, especially forest conversion to agricultural 

land, has been and still is the primary driver of global deforestation and forest degradation in 

many countries, especially in the tropics (KARP et al., 2015). Therefore, to minimize 

environmental impact, expansion of biofuel crop production on non-cultivated land or 

marginal/degraded lands, such as extensive pasturelands, is currently being promoted.  

Brazil is the world’s largest sugarcane producer, and currently accounting for with 

about 40% of the global harvest, of which approximately a half is used to produce ethanol 

(COMPANHIA NACIONAL DE ABASTECIMENTO, 2016). Roughly one-third of the total 

global ethanol fuel production is provided for through Brazilian sugarcane, with small 

contributions from other Latin America countries (GOLDEMBERG et al., 2014). The 

evolution of sugarcane, sugar and ethanol production in Brazil is shown in Figure 1A. 

Historically sugarcane expansion has been concentrated in the central-southern region (Figure 

1B), with 70% of this expansion occurring in extensive pasturelands (ADAMI et al., 2012). 

The vast area of degraded pasture in Brazil, coupled with opportunities for improvements in 

current ranching practices, could provide enough land for sugarcane production to meet the 

projected domestic demand for ethanol whilst meeting the demand for other ecosystem 

services (HORTA NOGUEIRA; CAPAZ, 2013; GOLDEMBERG et al., 2014; 

STRASSBURG et al., 2014).

Figure 1 - Evolution of sugarcane, sugar and ethanol production (A) and sugarcane cropped 

area (B) in Brazil (UNIÃO DA INDÚSTRIA DE CANA-DE-AÇÚCAR, 2016) 

 

Current preditions indicate that an additional of 6.4 Mha of sugarcane land will be 

required to meet the Brazilian demand for ethanol by 2021 (GOLDEMBERG et al., 2014). 

The accelerated pace of recent and projected sugarcane expansion, through which extensive 

pasture land has been subjected to intensive mechanization and agrochemical inputs has 

raised concerns regarding potential ecosystem impacts of LUC in Brazil. It is expected that 

maximizing the use of one ecosystem service (e.g., provision of biofuel and air quality) often 

leads to a sharp decline of other ecosystem services, particularly regulating services (e.g., C 

sequestration, soil retention, and water resource conservation) (FU et al., 2015). Thus,

ecosystems services has become a challenge to the scientific community and stakeholders. 

Soil quality (SQ) has been identified as a key component to assess the environmental 

sustainability of natural and anthropogenic ecosystems. Karlen et al. (1997) conceptualized 

SQ as the capacity of a specific kind of soil to function, within natural or managed ecosystem 

boundaries, to sustain plant and animal productivity, maintain or enhance water and air 

quality, and support human health and habitation. It is a complex functional concept and 

cannot be measured directly in the field or laboratory; but can be indirectly inferred by soil 

indicators. Indicators of SQ are those measurable soil properties and processes that have 

greatest sensitivity to changes in soil function and its ecosystem services (ANDREWS; 

KARLEN; CAMBARDELLA, 2004; ZORNOZA et al., 2015). 

Assessment of SQ involves a three-step conceptual framework (Figure 2), including (i) 

indicator selection (chemical, physical and biological); (ii) indicator interpretation (linear or 

non-linear scoring curves); and (iii) integration into an overall SQ index (SQI) (KARLEN; 

DITZLER; ANDREWS, 2003). Assessment values are generally expressed as a fraction or 

percentage of full performance for soil functions such as crop productivity, nutrient cycling, 

or environmental protection (ANDREWS; KARLEN; CAMBARDELLA, 2004).

Although this conceptual framework is broadly used for SQ assessments worldwide, 

different approaches have been tested to perform each one of the three steps (e.g., 

ANDREWS; KARLEN; MITCHELL, 2002; ANDREWS; KARLEN; CAMBARDELLA, 

2004; MUKHERJEE; LAL, 2014). Soil quality indicators can be selected based on expert 

opinion, statistical procedures, decision rules, etc. Linear and non-linear curves can be used 

for scoring measured indicator values. Finally, scored values can be integrated into an overall 

index using simple additives or weighted additive methodologies. Each approach has 

advantages and disadvantages, and its performance dependent of the assessment’s goals. 

Therefore, since there is no a universal method that can be used across multiple natural and 

anthropogenic ecosystems, many SQ assessment strategies have been developed and tested 

for specific purposes under particular environmental conditions worldwide. A distinguished 

example of the existing approaches is the Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF), 

which was initially developed and used by researchers in the USA on North American soils 

(ANDREWS; KARLEN; CAMBARDELLA, 2004); but it has been constantly enhanced by 

international collaborations, enabling to extend its use to other countries around world. 

However, to our knowledge there is no any protocol or published studies evaluating 

SQ changes induced by the LUC for sugarcane expansion in Brazil. Therefore, we conducted 

a field study in central-southern Brazil, the largest sugarcane-producing regions of the world, 

for assessing SQ responses to the primary LUC sequence (i.e., native vegetation to pasture to 

sugarcane) associated with sugarcane expansion. For that, the specific objectives were to: i) 

evaluate the LUC impacts on soil chemical attributes; ii) investigate soil physical and 

structural changes induced by the LUC impacts; iii) integrate soil chemical, physical and 

biological responses to LUC into an overall SQ assessment using different approaches and 

frameworks; iv) establish a protocol for assessing SQ changes in Brazilian sugarcane areas. 

We tested the main hypothesis that the LUC sequence induces alteration on dynamic of soil 

chemical, physical and biological indicators, leading to overall SQ degradation and its 

impacts can detected by SQ indexing strategies.   

To meet our objectives, this thesis is organized into eight chapters. Briefly, the first 

one presents a short introduction about the research topic studied. The second one addresses 

the LUC impacts associated to sugarcane expansion on soil chemical attributes and overall 

soil chemical quality. The third one evaluates soil phosphorus pool (labile, moderately labile 

and non-labile pools, as well as biological and geochemical pools) changes induced by the 

LUC for sugarcane expansion. The fourth one addresses the LUC impacts on soil physical 

properties and overall soil physical quality. The fifth one evaluates the sensitivity of the 



 19 

Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure (VESS) method for detecting soil structure quality 

changes due to sugarcane expansion. The sixth provides the results of the first application of 

Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) for evaluating overall SQ changes in 

Brazil. The seventh one investigates SQ changes induced by sugarcane expansion through six 

indexing strategies and provides a protocol for SQ assessment in Brazilian sugarcane areas. 

Finally, the eigth one provides the final considerations of this study.

2 SUGARCANE EXPANSION IN BRAZILIAN TROPICAL SOILS - EFFECTS OF 

LAND-USE CHANGE ON SOIL CHEMICAL ATTRIBUTES 

 

Abstract 

 

Land-use change (LUC) for sugarcane ethanol production has raised concerns about 

its potential environmental impacts in Brazil. Soil quality is a key indicator to infer about the 

environmental sustainability of Brazilian ethanol production. Our objective was to quantify 

the effects of the most common LUC sequence associated with sugarcane expansion (i.e., 

native vegetation to pasture to sugarcane) on chemical attributes in tropical soils. Soil 

sampling was carried out in three study sites located in central-southern Brazil, primary 

sugarcane region of production and expansion of the world. Overall, long-term conversion 

from native vegetation to extensive pasture decreased soil organic carbon (SOC), total 

nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus, sulfur, calcium, magnesium and boron contents. In 

addition, the LUC led to soil acidification and decreased CECpH7, indicating that pasturelands 

had poor soil chemical quality. The LUC from pasture to sugarcane increased soil nutrient 

levels and reduced the soil acidity due to inputs of lime and fertilizers. Despite that, 

increments of available P and base saturation are necessary to achieve ideal soil chemical 

conditions to sugarcane growth. Short-time (&lt;5 years) conversion from pasture to sugarcane 

had no significant impacts on SOC and NT contents; however, after 20 years of sugarcane 

production significant losses were quantified. Overall, our findings suggest that sugarcane 

expansion in Brazil replacing pasturelands will promote improvements on soil chemical 

quality. Nevertheless, sugarcane expansion can be associated with management strategies to 

increase soil organic matter and improve the soil fertility, reducing the environmental and 

economic costs associated with ethanol production in Brazil.

2.1 Introduction 

 

Land use activities whether converting natural landscapes for human use or changing 

management practices on human-dominated lands have transformed a large proportion of the 

planet’s land surface (FOLEY et al., 2005), with large short and long term environmental 

implications (LAMBIN; MEYFROIDT, 2011; TILMAN et al., 2011). The environmental 

impacts of agriculture include those caused by expansion (when croplands and pastures 

extend into new areas, replacing natural ecosystems) and those caused by intensification 

(when existing lands are managed to be more productive) (FOLEY et al., 2011). 

In Brazil, the area currently cultivated with sugarcane is undergoing significant 

expansion due to the growing demand for bioethanol, driven by environmental, geopolitical 

and economic issues (LAPOLA et al., 2010; 2014; GOLDEMBERG et al., 2014; 

HERNANDES; BUFON; SEABRA, 2014). This is considered one of the main causes of LUC 



 24 

in the central-southern region (LAPOLA et al., 2010; 2014; GOLDEMBERG et al., 2014; 

WALTER et al., 2014).  

Brazil is currently the world’s largest sugarcane producer, accounting for one-third of 

global harvest. An area of 9.0 Mha was cultivated during the 2015/2016 season 

(COMPANHIA NACIONAL DE ABASTECIMENTO, 2015), with 90% of the sugarcane 

cultivated in Brazil concentrated within the central-southern region under tropical soils, 

especially Oxisols and Ultisols. Although Brazilian sugarcane production is significant, an 

additional 6.4 Mha of sugarcane area would be required to meet the projected internal demand 

of ethanol by 2021 (61.6 billion L) (GOLDEMBERG et al., 2014). In central-southern Brazil, 

sugarcane expanded primarily onto pasturelands and annual croplands, with limited expansion 

into areas of native vegetation (ADAMI et al., 2012; EGESKOG et al., 2014). In the near 

future, sugarcane expansion is most likely to occur in areas previously used as extensive 

pasture (LAPOLA et al., 2010; ADAMI et al., 2012; EGESKOG et al., 2014; 

GOLDEMBERG et al., 2014). 

This recent expansion in production to meet ethanol demand, in combination with the 

projected future expansion, has raised concerns about the potential environmental impacts of 

LUC in Brazil (HERNANDES; BUFON; SEABRA, 2014). Therefore, it is necessary 

investigate the LUC effects to assess of sustainability of expanding ethanol production. The 

greatest challenge is to define sensitive indicators that reflect local specificities of the 

environmental implications from LUC (GASPARATOS; STROMBERG; TAKEUCHI, 2011; 

EFROYMSON et al., 2013; FU et al., 2015).  

The soil quality is identified as key component to assess the environmental 

sustainability of natural and anthropogenic ecosystems (KARLEN et al., 1997) and it has been 

proposed into current protocols such as the one elaborate by Better Sugar Cane Initiative 

“Bonsucro
®

”
 
certification (BETTER SUGAR CANE INITIATIVE, 2011) and the “Global 

Bioenergy Partnership” by FAO (GLOBAL BIOENERGY PARTNERSHIP, 2011). To 

evaluate the effects of land use and soil managements on soil quality, soil chemical attributes 

can be used as potential indicators, such as: available macro- and micronutrients, acidity 

attributes, cation exchange capacity and soil organic carbon (SOC) (DORAN; PARKIN, 

1994; VEZZANI; MIELNICZUK, 2011; CARDOSO et al., 2013; ZORNOZA et al., 2015) 

Previous studies indicated that LUC affects soil chemical attributes in different ways. 

In a global meta-analysis Don, Schumacher and Freibauer (2011) showed that conversions 

from forest to pasture and/or cropland promoted SOC losses. Recently, a large study under 

tropical soils in central-southern Brazil showed that soil C stocks decreased following LUC 



 25 

from native vegetation to pastures and then from pasture to sugarcane (MELLO et al., 2014). 

However, C stocks increases were found where cropland was converted to sugarcane 

(MELLO et al., 2014). On the other hand, Carvalho et al. (2009) showed the conversion from 

Brazilian’s Cerrado into cropland under conservative management in an Oxisol increased 

SOC and nutrients (P, K, Ca, Mg) and reduced soil acidity. In this case, it was driven mainly 

by fertilizer application and liming to reduce soil acidity. Geissen et al. (2009) under Peruvian 

highland jungle (Amazon forest) region and Lindel, Åström and Öberg (2010) under different 

soils in tropical Southeast Mexico, concluded that the LUC did not lead to significant changes 

in soil chemical attributes, although, Geissen et al. (2009) observed that soils used as 

pastureland became acidified. 

Therefore, our objective was to quantify effects of the most common LUC sequence 

associated with sugarcane expansion (i.e., native vegetation to pasture to sugarcane) on 

chemical attributes in tropical soils of central-southern Brazil. We hypothesized that i) LUC 

from native vegetation to extensive pasture leads to significant depletions of SOC and 

macronutrients and increase soil acidification; ii) sugarcane cultivation replacing extensive 

pasturelands can recover soil fertility; iii) pasturelands have lower soil chemical quality than 

sugarcane fields, constituting hotspots for sugarcane expansion in Brazil. 

 

2.2 Material and Methods 

 

2.2.1 Study sites 

 

The study was carried out in central-southern Brazil, the largest sugarcane-producing 

region of the world (Figure 1). Three strategic and representative sites were chosen along a 

transect of approximately 1,000 km across this region: (i) Lat_17S: located near Jataí city in 

the southwestern region of the Goiás state (Lat.: 17º56?16?S; Long.: 51º38?31?W) with a mean 

altitude of 800 m; (ii) Lat_21S: located near Valparaíso city in the west region of the São 

Paulo state (Lat.: 21º14?48?S; Long.: 50º47?04?W) with a mean altitude of 425 m. (iii) 

Lat_23S: located near Ipaussu city in the south-central region of the São Paulo state (Lat.: 

23º05?08? S; Long.: 49º37?52? W), with a mean altitude of 630 m.

The climate classification in the studied sites are as follows: Lat_17S: Awa type 

(Köppen classification) mesothermal tropical, with a mean annual temperature of 24.0 ºC and 

annual precipitation of 1,600 mm (Figure 2A); Lat_21S: Aw type (Köppen classification) 

humid tropical, with a mean annual temperature of 23.4 ºC and annual precipitation of 1,240 

mm (Figure 2B); Lat_23S: Cwa type (Köppen classification) tropical, with annual mean 

temperature of 21.7 ºC and annual precipitation of 1,470 mm (Figure 2C). Rainfall at all three 

sites is concentrated in the spring and summer (October to April), while the dry season is in 

the autumn and winter (May to September).

 The soils at all three sites, classified as Oxisols, Ultisols and Alfisols, are 

characterized by highly weathered minerals (Ki and Kr weathering indexes have values &amp;lt;

2.0), typical of Brazilian tropical soils. A morphological description of 2-m deep soil profiles 

was carried out in January 2014, to classify the soils at each field site. From each soil horizon 

we collected samples for chemical, mineralogical and particle-size analyses. Overall, the soils 

have predominance of 1:1 minerals (kaolinite), Fe oxides (goethite, hematite) and Al oxide 

(gibbsite) (Figure 3).The profile description and the soils classification using criteria outlined 

by the USDA Soil Taxonomy (SOIL SURVEY STAFF, 2014) and Brazilian Classification 

System (SANTOS et al., 2013) as well as the parental material are presented in Table 1.

2.2.2 Land-use change sequence 

 

To assess the effects of LUC on soil chemical attributes we adopted a chronosequence 

approach, where each one of three studied sites (Lat_17S; Lat_21S; Lat_23S) included three 

land uses: native vegetation, pasture and sugarcane crop, representing the most common land 

use transition sequence in the south-central region of Brazil.  

The three land uses are co-located adjacent to each other, to minimize the effects of 

climatic, topographic and soil variations on the soil quality indicators. Despite that concern, a 

textural difference between the soil under pasture (lower clay content) and the other land uses 

of the same chronosequence was observed at Lat_17S (Table 1). Thus, we highlighted that all 

statements about LUC effects on P pools for this site must be interpreted carefully. When 

adopting a chronosequence approach the variability in soils within the chronosequence is not 

always possible to be controlled, but, the global lack of long-term studies evaluating the 

effects of LUC, and especially in Brazil, justifies to keep this synchronic approach in our 

study (SIQUEIRA NETO et al., 2010; COSTA JUNIOR et al., 2013).  

Land use historical information and brief description of management operations 

conducted at the studied sites are shown in Figure 4 and Table 2.

Lat_17S 

 

Native  

vegetation 

Cerradao forest formation, Cerrado biome, characterized by sclerophyllous and xeromorphic species. The vegetation is dense compared to the 

Cerrado stricto sensu (savanna). 

Pasture 

Conversion from native vegetation to pasture occurred at 1980. Pasture is composed by tropical grasses of the genus Brachiaria, predominantly 

B. decumbens, B. brizantha and B. ruziziensis, and supports 1.5 AU ha
-1

 full year. The conversion of native vegetation to pasture occurred of the 

beginning of the 1980s. The predominant species are of the Brachiaria genus, especially B. decumbens, B. brizantha e B. ruziziensis. The 

stocking rate is 1.5 UA ha
-1

 along the all year.  

Sugarcane 

Sugarcane cultivar RB855453 was cultivated over part of the pasture at 2009. At that time soil was prepared by plowing and di sking. The 

sugarcane mean yield since the implantation is 81.5 ton ha
-1

. At the sampling time for chemical and biological analyses the sugarcane was in the 

third ratoon cropping of its cycle; while at soil sampling time for physical analyses the soil had been newly tilled for sugarcane replanting 

(chiseling and disking). Soil acidity was corrected with the application of 1.6 ton ha
-1

 of dolomitic lime. Also was applied 1 ton ha
-1

 of gypsum 

before cropping to supply S and Ca and 150 kg ha
-1

 of P2O5. Annually the crop fertilization is carried out by the application of 110 kg ha

 K2O. Sugarcane has been mechanically harvested using a harvester (?20 Mg) and transported by a tractor + trailer (?10 + 20 Mg). 

Sugarcane production has not used controlled traffic system. 

Lat_21S 

 

Native  

vegetation 

The local vegetation is seasonal semideciduous forest, Atlantic forest biome, in which a portion of the trees defoliates during the dry season. It 

is a transitional region, where the forest has more xeromorphic species than the wetter areas of the Atlantic forest, on the other hand presents 

less xeromorphic species than the Cerrado vegetation. 

Pasture 
Conversion from native vegetation to pasture occurred at 1980. Pasture is composed by tropical grasses of the Brachiaria genus and supports 2 

AU ha
-1

 full year. Annually, the pasture receives 25 kg ha
-1 

N, 6 kg ha
-1 

P2O5, 23 kg ha

K2O (mineral fertilizer). 

Sugarcane 

Sugarcane cultivar SP791011 was cultivated over part of the pasture at 2010. At that time soil was prepared by plowing and di sking. The 

sugarcane mean yield since the implantation is 80 ton ha
-1

. At the sampling time sugarcane was in the fourth ratoon cropping of its cycle. Soil 

acidity was corrected by liming. The sugarcane was annually fertilized with 11 kg ha

Sugarcane 

Sugarcane cultivar CTC6 was cultivated over part of the pasture at the beginning of the 1990s. At that time soil was prepared by plowing and 

disking. The sugarcane mean yield since the implantation is 85 ton ha
-1

. At the sampling time sugarcane was in the fifth ratoon cropping of its 

cycle. Soil acidity was corrected by liming. Annually the crop fertilization is carried out by the application of 45 kg ha

machines similar to those described for Lat_17S. From 2013 around 50% of the sugarcane straw has been removed from the soil for electric 

energy production.

2.2.3 Sampling and soil chemical attributes 

 

Soil sampling was completed in January 2013 during the rainy season, when the 

sugarcane was in full growth close to harvest. Soil samples within each land use (i.e., native 

vegetation, pasture and sugarcane) were collected using a consistent grid pattern composed of 

nine points spaced 50 m apart, providing a total of 27 sampling points (3 land uses x 9 points) 

for each site or 81 sampling points for the three studied sites. Around each sampling point, 

composite samples consisting of 12 subsamples were collected using a Dutch auger, at three 

depths: 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm. This provided a total of 243 disturbed soil samples for 

chemical analyses.  

The soil chemical attributes studied were: soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen 

(TN) which were measured by dry combustion on a LECO
®
 CN-2000 elemental analyzer 

(furnace at 1350 ºC in pure oxygen); available phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), 

magnesium (Mg), sulfur (S-sulphate), boron (B), cooper (Cu), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), 

zinc (Zn), active acidity (pHCaCl2 0.01mol L
-1

), potential acidity (H+Al), base saturation (BS) 

and potential cation exchange capacity (CECpH7) which were measured by analytical methods 

described in Raij et al. (2001).  

 

2.2.4 Data analyses 

 

The normality of data was confirmed by Shapiro-Wilk’s test (p&gt;0.05), using the 

Statistical Analysis System - SAS v.9.3 (SAS Inc, Cary, USA), therefore no transformation of 

data was required. The data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) using PROC 

GLM procedure. If the ANOVA F statistic was significant at (p&lt;0.05), the means were 

compared using Tukey’s test (p&lt;0.05) by SAS v.9.3. To analyze the effects within each site, 

means were compared within each site, and to analyze the overall (regional scale) effects, 

means were compared considering each site as a block. The three soil depths were analyzed 

separately. A Pearson’s correlation analysis (p&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.05) was performed using PROC 

CORR procedure among all soil chemical attributes.

2.3 Results 

 

2.3.1 Soil organic carbon and total nitrogen 

 

The LUC to support sugarcane expansion induced significant SOC losses in the three 

study sites (Figure 5). At Lat_17S and Lat_21S the conversion from native vegetation to 

pasture resulted in SOC reductions in all soil layers, representing losses of approximately 

40% in the 0-30 cm layer. In contrast, short-term (&lt;5 years) conversion from pasture to 

sugarcane did not induced significant SOC changes (Figure 5A,C,E). At Lat_23S, the SOC 

contents in natural ecosystem is higher than others study sites, averaged 37, 33 and 30 g kg
-1

 

for 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm layers. The soils at this site have much higher clay content 

(Table 1). Conversion from native vegetation to pasture promoted significant SOC changes 

only in the subsurface layer (20-30 cm) (Figure 5C). After &gt;20 years of conversion from 

pasture to sugarcane were observed severe SOC losses, decreasing from 36.4 to 18.9 g kg
-1

 

(0-10 cm), from 27.6 to 18.4 g kg
-1

 (10-20 cm) and from 20.6 to 17.3 g kg
-1

 (20-30 cm).  

The TN response to LUC was similar to that quantified for SOC (Figure 5). At 

Lat_17S and Lat_21S conversion from native vegetation to pasture led to NT losses of 

approximately 42% and 55%, respectively (0-30 cm layer) (Figure 5 B,D,F). In general, short-

term conversion from pasture to sugarcane had no negative impacts on TN, even some 

increases were found for the subsurface soil layers (10-20 and 20-30 cm) at Lat_17S. Similar 

to verified for SOC, long-term conversion from native vegetation to pasture and then from 

pasture to sugarcane induced significant soil TN losses at Lat_23S. 

In the regional scale (three sites combined), the LUC induced significant SOC and TN 

depletions (Figure 6). Conversion from native vegetation to pasture decreased 28 and 18% of 

the SOC and NT contents, while conversion from pasture to sugarcane decreased 18 and 10%, 

respectively.

same letter do not differ among themselves according to Tukey’s test (p&lt;0.05). Sites were

2.3.2 Soil acidity attributes and CECpH7 

 

The soil pH measured at each site was lower of ideal range for plants growth (pH &amp;lt;

5.5-6.0) (Table 3). In general, conversion from native vegetation to pasture decreased pH and 

BS values. At Lat_21S, the soil had higher pH and BS, and lower H+Al compared to the other 

sites and land uses (Table 3), most likely due to recent historical forest understory burning, 

because remains of ash were found on the soil surface. Sugarcane cultivation replacing 

pasture promoted significant decreases in both the active and potential acidity and 

consequently, BS was increased. However, in the sugarcane soils still remain acidity problems 

for crop, since the average pH (0-30 cm) was between 5.0 (Lat_17S; Lat_21S) and 5.5 

(Lat_23S), BS values were 45% (Lat_17S), 60% (Lat_21S) and 65% (Lat_23S), and H+Al 

contents approximately of 30 mmolc dm
-3

. At the regional scale, this same response was 

confirmed, where sugarcane soils have lower acidity and higher BS, pasture soils have the 

greatest active acidity, and native vegetation sites have the highest potential acidity (soil 

electric charges are saturated with H
+
 and Al

3+
). The LUC led to significant decrease of 

CECpH7 from native vegetation to pasture, but were not observed differences from pasture to 

sugarcane (Table 3) for all sites.

2.3.3 Soil macro- and micro-nutrients 

 

Overall, higher Ca and Mg contents were found under sugarcane  (Table 4) as function 

of lime application to neutralize soil acidity. Native vegetation at Lat_21S was an exception, 

because the effects of forest understory burning and ash (earlier commented) increased the Ca 

and Mg contents in the surface soil. There were significant improvements in K contents under 

pasture soils at the Lat_21S and Lat_23S compared to native vegetation and sugarcane (Table 

4). Overall, K contents under pasture soils were 28 and 30% higher than native vegetation and 

sugarcane soils for the 0-30 cm layer. Native vegetation and sugarcane showed no significant 

K differences among themselves.  

The lowest available P contents were found at Lat_17S site (Table 4), where the soil is 

in more advanced weathering stage [i.e., lower Ki and Kr indexes (Table 1)]. Conversion 

from native vegetation to pasture significantly decreased available P by 40% at Lat_17S, 65% 

at Lat_21S and 27% at Lat_23S, with an average of 42% at the regional scale for the 0-30 cm 

layer. Under sugarcane soils P contents were similar to those under pasture (Lat_23S and 

regional scale) or  under native vegetation (Lat_17S and Lat_21S). There were significant 

reductions of S-sulphate contents (Table 4) due to conversion from native vegetation to 

pasture at Lat_23S and from pasture to sugarcane at the Lat_21S and Lat_23S. In contrast, 

there was no S differences between native vegetation and pasture at Lat_17S; and sugarcane 

soil had the highest S values due to gypsum application before sugarcane planting (Table 2).  

The soil B contents were negatively affected by the transition from native vegetation 

to pasture (Table 5). Part of those B losses was recovered by sugarcane cultivation under 

pasture; however, in all three sites the average B contents were&amp;lt;0.6 mg dm
-3

, level 

considered as adequate for Brazilian tropical soils (RAIJ et al., 1997). Other micronutrients, 

Cu, Mn, Fe and Zn (metal ions), in general, showed similar responses relative to impacts 

caused by LUC (Table 5). Thus, under pasture soils where the pH is lower, there were 

significant increases in Cu, Mn, Fe and Zn availability. Under sugarcane the concentration of 

Cu, Mn and Fe decreased, although the contents contained in soil are still considered high, 

and meet the crop nutritional demand. The Zn contents were&amp;lt;0.5 mg dm
-3

 at Lat_17S site 

(Oxisol more weathered), below the recommended range (0.6 - 1.0 mg dm
-3

) by Raij et al. 

(1997), requiring application of this nutrient.

2.3.4 Correlation among soil chemical attributes 

 

Soil chemical properties were strongly correlated among themselves, as indicated by 

significant linear correlations for 79 (p&lt;0.01) and 88 (p&lt;0.05) of 120 pairs of soil properties 

studied (Table 6). The most significant positive correlation was observed for SOC and TN (r 

= 0.95), with the following regression [SOC = (11.17 x TN) + 1.10 (r
2
 = 0.91)]. The SOC and 

TN were also correlated with the CECpH7 (r = 0.83; r = 0.87) and H+Al. In addition, SOC and 

TN were correlated with exchangeable anions P and S-sulphate, exchangeable cations K, Mg 

and Ca, and micronutrients Mn, Zn and B. 

There were significant correlations between soil chemical properties that influence soil 

acidity [pH vs BS (r = 0.95); pH vs H+Al (r = -0.64); BS vs H+Al (r = -0.63)] and with 

exchangeable cations, especially Ca and Mg [Ca vs pH (r = 0.91); Mg vs pH (r = 0.77)]. For 

the micronutrients, Fe and Cu were negatively correlated with pH and exchangeable cations; 

Contents of B, Zn and Mn were positively correlated with P and with the exchange cations K, 

Ca and Mg (Table 6).

2.4 Discussion 

 

2.4.1 Land-use change effects on soil organic carbon and total nitrogen 

 

Soil organic carbon and TN losses induced by long-term conversion from native 

vegetation to extensive pasture in tropical soils have been consistently reported in the 

literature (MURTY et al., 2002; DON; SCHUMACHER; FREIBAUER, 2011; ASSAD et al., 

2013; MELLO et al., 2014). The key factors of these SOC and TN losses are the following: i) 

cutting and burning of native vegetation at the time of pasture establishment, where CO2 and 

N volatile forms losses may occur through several mechanisms due to combustion (JUO; 

MANU, 1996); ii) exposure and SOM respiration due to soil disturbance by tillage (FELLER; 

BEARE, 1997; SIX; ELLIOTT; PAUSTIAN, 2000); iii) soil erosion and runoff (FELLER; 

BEARE, 1997; ZHANG; WANG; LI, 2015) and mineral N leaching (McGRATH et al., 

2001); iv) low productivity of degraded pasture associated with continuous grazing and 

reduced organic litter inputs to the soil (MAIA et al., 2009; ASSAD et al., 2013; 

CARVALHO et al., 2014), typical characteristics of the Brazilian pasturelands as those here 

studied.  

Impacts of LUC from pasture to sugarcane on SOC and NT are still little reported in 

the literature (ROSSI et al., 2013; MELLO et al., 2014). Our findings showed that a short-

term (&lt;5 years) transition from pasture to sugarcane, as observed at the Lat_17 and Lat_21S 

(Table 2; Figure 4) did not promote SOC losses for the 0-30 cm layer. On the other hand, 

long-term (&gt;20 years) sugarcane production led to important SOC losses at Lat_23S. This 

SOC depletions can be associated to several causes, such as soil tillage performed for 

planting, fertilization and sugarcane reformation (MELLO et al., 2014), long period of time 

(~10 years) with burning sugarcane harvesting system (CERRI et al., 2011; BORDONAL; 

FIGUEIREDO; LA SCALA JR, 2012; BRANDANI et al., 2015) and the recent crop residue 

removal for electricity production (CARVALHO et al., 2013). At Lat_17S were observed 

higher SOC and TN content under sugarcane than pasture. These results are due to the effects 

of LUC, but also influenced by differences in soil texture (Table 1) between pasture area 

(lower clay content) and the others land uses of the same chronosequence. Clay content is one 

of the major controlling factors to protect, stabilize and storage organic C in the tropical soils 

(FELLER; BEARE, 1997).  

Our findings showed SOC and NT losses in regional scale as response of LUC effects. 

These results agree with results reported in a global meta-analysis conducted by Don, 



 43 

Schumacher and Freibauer (2011), and measured effects reported by Assad et al. (2013) and 

Mello et al. (2014). Both SOC and TN are broadly recognized as key indicators of soil 

quality/health (DORAN; PARKIN, 1994; VEZZANI; MIELNICZUK, 2009; CARDOSO et 

al., 2013; ZORNOZA et al., 2015); therefore our data suggest that improved management 

practices are needed to prevent or minimize negative impact of sugarcane production on soil 

quality and other ecosystem services. 

 

2.4.2 Land-use change effects on acidity attributes and CECpH7 

 

The high soil acidity found in all studied sites (Table 3) can be attributed to the natural 

acidity that is characteristic of highly weathered soils, such as Oxisols and Ultisols in Brazil. 

These low pH soils are associated with soil acidification processes driven by management 

practices (ANJOS et al., 2012). In croplands, soil acidity is increased by several factors, such 

as: uptake of basic cations by crops and removal of these during harvesting; inadequate soil 

management favoring erosion and exposure of subsurface soil horizons (more acidic); the use 

of N fertilizers, and through the oxidation of S and SOM (SOUZA; MIRANDA; OLIVEIRA, 

2007). 

Soil acidity may have been strongly neutralized through native vegetation burning and 

ash deposition on the soil surface (JUO; MANU, 1996; NGO-MBOGBA; YEMEFACK; 

NYECK, 2015). It seems to be the major reason of higher pH values in native vegetation at 

Lat_21S. However, these effects were not observed after more than 30 years of burning in the 

conversion from native vegetation to pasture. Thereby, these results would indicate that over 

time pasture land use reduced pH, BS and the exchangeable cations (Ca and Mg). Soil acidity 

reductions and increases of Ca and Mg (Tables 3 and 4) observed in sugarcane fields are due 

to management with applications of lime during the sugarcane conversion, and each 

subsequent reformation cycle every 5-6 years (Table 2). Therefore, the sugarcane expansion 

under pasture still requires liming, because sugarcane-growing recommendations states a BS 

? 60% requirement (RAIJ et al., 1997), and in pasture soils (land use prior to sugarcane) these 

BS values are lower (&lt;10% at Lat_17S; ~25% at Lat_21S; ~50% at Lat_23S). 

Soil CECpH7 refers to the amount of negative charges at pH 7, which is not affected by 

addition of lime and fertilizer. Thus, CECpH7 is dependent upon the soil mineralogy and SOM 

content. Tropical soils, as those here studied, are dominated by variable-charge minerals with 

low CEC. Therefore, SOM is very important for the nutrient status of the soils, since its lower 

the point of zero charge and increase of CEC (FELLER; BEARE, 1997; ZECH et al., 1997). 



 44 

It is confirmed in our dataset, where SOC and NT were strongly correlated with CECpH7, r = 

0.83 (Table 6). Thus, depletions of SOM as response to LUC effects found in these areas 

(FRANCO et al., 2015) led to reductions of CECpH7 from native vegetation to pasture and 

sugarcane.  

 

2.4.3 Land-use change effects on macro- and micro- nutrients  

 

The higher K contents were found under pasture soils (Table 4). It could be attributed 

to the heavy cycling, where up to 90% of the K taken up by plants is returned to the soil 

through of urine and feces (KAYSER; ISSELSTEIN, 2005) and low K losses from the system 

(extensive cattle with low stocking rate). The cycling of K in deeper soil layers and release of 

non-exchangeable K forms by aggressive root system of grasses. The external inputs of K 

fertilizers to degraded pasture (Lat_21S) also increase K, in addition to the increases from the 

mineral animal feed supplements fed to cattle. In the native vegetation and sugarcane soils the 

K content were not significantly different, demonstrating that the application of mineral K 

fertilizers and organic residues (rich in K), such as vinasse (CHRISTOFOLETTI et al., 2013) 

to sugarcane maintains K levels equal to those found under native vegetation, despite 

significant K export in harvested sugarcane biomass.  

Overall, low available P contents were found in all land uses studied (Table 4), 

characteristic of the tropical soils. According to Novais, Smyth and Nunes (2007) increases in 

the weathering degree leads to gradual changes in soil characteristics, resulting in increases of 

positives charge and ability of soil to adsorb and retain anions, such as phosphates. Under 

these conditions, P is strongly adsorbed (inner sphere complex) in Fe and Al oxides and 

kaolinites (FONTES; WEED, 1996; NOVAIS; SMYTH; NUNES, 2007), which is the 

predominant clay mineralogy in these study sites. 

The LUC from native vegetation to pasture promoted available P contents depletions 

(Table 4). Recently a large regional survey in Brazil also concluded that LUC from native 

vegetation to extensive pasture led to decreases of available P stocks in the soil (GROPPO et 

al., 2015). This decrease may be associated with P exploitation over time by grazing cattle 

and absence of P fertilizer inputs. Several studies state that P plant-availability in pasture is 

strongly dependent on the mineralization of the P organic pools (AGUIAR et al., 2013; 

FONTES et al., 2014; NASH et al., 2014). Therefore, the pronounced SOM depletions in 

these sites (Figures 5 and 6), can be explains the severe degradation process of the Brazilian 

pasturelands. Available P increases in the transition from pasture to cropland (sugarcane in 



 45 

this study) is frequently reported in the literature (NEGASSA; LEINWEBER, 2009), as 

response to application of mineral phosphate fertilizers. However, despite this increase (Table 

4), the amount of P available to support sugarcane growth was not enhanced, since the levels 

were lower than the recommended 15 mg kg
-1 

critical level (RAIJ et al., 1997). 

Available P depletion observed in sugarcane soil at Lat_23S may be due to application 

of only organic residues (filtercake, boiler ash and vinasse) from sugarcane industry (Table 2). 

These organic residues could be releasing available P to plants below that is removed in the 

harvested biomass, and probably, accumulating P in other organic and/or inorganic fractions 

that are less available in the soil. Therefore, future studies fractionating P forms will be 

crucial for understanding LUC impacts on plant-available P dynamics in the soil, and perhaps, 

identify indicator fractions for these effects (AGUIAR et al., 2013). 

S-sulphate content depletions from native vegetation to pasture and from pasture to 

sugarcane (Table 4) are associated with i) native vegetation burning at the moment of 

conversion, where losses occur by volatilization of S (JUO; MANU, 1996), ii) reduction of 

organic matter inputs in the soil iii) SOM decreases with more intensive soil tillage in 

sugarcane fields. Practically the entire available S-sulphate in the soil comes from biological 

process of mineralization of SOM (ALVAREZ et al., 2007). Thus, SOM changes have a 

direct effect on the availability of S in the soil (KIRKBY et al., 2011). The SOC and NT 

losses induced by the LUC confirm the close linkage between S-sulphate and SOM.  

Soil micronutrient availability is affected by several factors, such as: soil acidity; 

SOM; P availability; moisture, texture, soil mineralogy (Fe, Al and Mn oxides), land 

management and fertilization (WEI et al., 2006; ABREU; LOPES; SANTOS, 2007; 

SARKAR et al., 2014). Except the soil mineralogy and texture, these other factors are 

intensively affected by LUC process, modifying the availability of soil micronutrients to 

plants. The associated decrease in SOM in these areas (Figures 5 and 6) could be driving our 

observed decrease in B (Table 5), which has been shown to correlate with SOM, Fe and Mn 

oxides (SARKAR et al., 2014). The Cu, Mn, Fe and Zn responses to the LUC, with higher 

contents in pasture soils (Table 5), most likely is due to acidification process in these soils, 

which increase strongly their soil availability (ABREU; LOPES; SANTOS, 2007). The 

relationship between these micronutrients and acidity attributes was confirmed in this study 

(Table 6). 

 



 46 

2.4.4 Soil chemical quality and its implications for sugarcane expansion 

 

Soil chemical quality assessments are crucial to quantify the soil’s capacity to provide 

nutrients for adequate plant growth. Our findings suggest that LUC promoted significant 

effects on soil chemical properties (Figure 7) and consequently on soil chemical quality. 

Summarily, conversion from native vegetation to pasture promoted the following effects: i) 

high depletions of soil attributes related to SOM content (i.e., SOC, TN, P, S, B and CECpH7); 

ii) soil acidification process with decrease of pH, BS and exchange cations (Ca and Mg); iii) 

increase of metallic micronutrients availability (i.e., Cu, Mn, Fe and Zn). Therefore, 

conversion from native vegetation to pasture reduced the soil’s capacity to support plant 

growth and productivity over time.  

 

 

Figure 7 - Scores of the soil chemical attributes (0-30 cm layer) under land-use change 

(native vegetation - pasture - sugarcane) in central-southern Brazil. Mean values were 
relativized and transformed in scores ranging from 0 to 1, so for each soil attribute the land use that 

had the highest value received score 1 and other land uses received proportional values 

 

 

Conversion from pasture to sugarcane resulted in a partial recovery of soil chemical 

quality on a relatively short timescale (&lt;5 years) due to the successive applications of lime 

and fertilizers. Despite that, increments of available P and soil correction to BS ?60% are 

necessary to achieve ideal soil chemical conditions to sugarcane growth. Although, there was 

a decrease in soil micronutrient availability, the amount of available micronutrients to support 

plant growth was enhanced. Overall the LUC from pasture to sugarcane results in SOM

losses, as also reported by Mello et al. (2014). However, the payback time for these losses is 

short and overall it delivers substantial greenhouse gas emission savings when sugarcane 

ethanol is used to displace fossil based fuels (EGESKOG et al., 2014; MELLO et al., 2014). 

Based on our findings that indicated SOC losses in regional scale as response of LUC effects, 

associated to strong relationship among SOC with other soil chemical properties verified in 

this study, we conclude that SOC is an important indicator of soil degradation and could be 

useful for assessing soil quality in the sugarcane fields in Brazil. 

Therefore, our study indicated that management strategies are necessary to maintain 

and/or improve the soil chemical quality and the sustainability of sugarcane production in 

Brazil. Mechanized harvesting associated with reduced tillage and maintenance of sugarcane 

straw on soil surface are key-factors to increase soil C sequestration, nutrient-cycling and 

improve soil quality in sugarcane fields (CERRI et al., 2011; BORDONAL; FIGUEIREDO; 

LA SCALA JR, 2012; BRANDANI et al., 2015). In addition, fertilization using organic 

residues from sugarcane industry (e.g., vinasse and filter cake) could be a feasible alternative 

to increase SOM (BRANDANI et al., 2015) and provide nutrients, especially K and P 

(CHRISTOFOLETTI et al., 2013; PRADO; CAIONE; CAMPOS, 2013) reducing the 

production costs with mineral fertilizers (ALMEIDA JUNIOR et al., 2011; SILVA; BONO; 

PEREIRA, 2014). 

 

2.5 Conclusions 

 

Our findings showed that long-term LUC from native vegetation to extensive pasture 

decreases SOC, TN, available P, S, Ca, Mg and B contents. In addition, the LUC induces to 

soil acidification and decrease of CECpH7, indicating that pasture areas have poor soil 

chemical quality in the primary sugarcane producing region of Brazil. 

Conversion from pasture to sugarcane leads to increase of macronutrients levels and 

reduction of soil acidity due to inputs of lime and fertilizers, improving soil fertility. Despite 

that, increments of available P and BS are necessary to achieve ideal soil chemical conditions 

to sugarcane growth. Decreases of available metallic micronutrients as response to soil acidity 

correction in sugarcane fields are not limiting to plants growth. Short-time (&lt;5 years) 

conversion from pasture to sugarcane had no significant impacts on SOC and NT contents; 

however, after 20 years of sugarcane production significant losses were quantified. In regional 

scale, conversion from pasture to sugarcane induced 18 and 10% losses of the SOC and NT, 

respectively, for the 0-30 cm layer.

Overall, it is expected that sugarcane expansion in Brazil replacing areas currently 

occupied with pastures will promote improvement on soil chemical quality. Despite this, 

sugarcane expansion can be associated with management strategies to increase SOM and 

improve the soil fertility, reducing the environmental and economic costs associated with 

ethanol production in Brazil.

3 PHOSPHORUS POOLS RESPONSES TO LAND-USE CHANGE FOR 

SUGARCANE EXPANSION IN WEATHERED BRAZILIAN SOILS 

 

 

Abstract 

 

Without proper management, land-use change (LUC) associated with producing 

sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) for bioenergy in Brazil can lead to soil degradation and 

have negative implications on ecosystem functions. Phosphorus (P) depletion is one of the 

most frequent causes of land degradation in tropical environments, and as such, soil P pools 

have been identified as potential indicators of negative environmental impacts. We quantified 

soil P dynamics for the most common LUC sequence in sugarcane expansion areas (i.e., 

native vegetation to pasture to sugarcane), to determine if and how these changes could be 

used to evaluate environmental impacts of LUC in weathered Brazilian soils. Soil samples 

were collected from three areas in central-southern Brazil, representing the primary 

sugarcane-producing region of the world. Soil P fractionation was performed, and P stocks 

were calculated for the surface 30 cm. Soil chemical attributes and macrofauna data were 

correlated with P pools. Long-term conversion from natural ecosystems (Cerrado and Atlantic 

forest biome) to extensive pasture decreased total P stocks by 31.2% indicating progressive 

soil degradation in these areas. In contrast, the LUC from pasture to sugarcane increased total 

P stocks by 35.6%; nevertheless, fertilization management altered the soil P-cycle, causing P 

accumulation in less plant-available forms. Available P increases to support adequate 

sugarcane growth are still needed. Applying P using organic residues increased labile organic 

P and may be a complementary strategy for increasing nutrient supplies in sugarcane fields. 

Phosphorus availability showed significant positive correlations with other soil chemical 

properties and clay content, while the functional diversity of soil macrofauna was strongly 

correlated with labile and biological P. We conclude that P pools can be useful indicators for 

assessing LUC modifications on soil quality in the tropics, and recommend they be used to 

assess land degradation and environmental sustainability within sugarcane expansion areas in 

Brazil.

3.1 Introduction 

 

The global expansion of bioenergy crops has brought attention to the potential 

environmental impacts resulting from land-use changes (LUC) (ROWE; STREET; TAYLOR, 

2009; WRIGHT; WIMBERLY, 2013; MUKHERJEE; SOVACOOL, 2014; WALTER et al., 

2014; ANAYA; HUBER-SANNWALD, 2015). In Brazil, the largest sugarcane ethanol 

producer in the world, the area growing sugarcane expanded by 3.2 Mha between 2005 and 

2015, totalizing approx. 9.1 Mha (COMPANHIA BRASILEIRA DE ABASTECIMENTO, 

2015). However, Brazil will need an additional 6.4 Mha of sugarcane to meet domestic 

ethanol demand in 2021 (GOLDEMBERG et al., 2014). This additional area will primarily 



 56 

come from areas that are currently in pasture (LAPOLA et al., 2010; GOLDEMBERG et al., 

2014; WALTER et al., 2014). 

Soil quality has been identified as a key environmental component for evaluating the 

sustainability of biofuel expansion (BETTER SUGAR CANE INITIATIVE, 2011; GLOBAL 

BIOENERGY PARTNERSHIP, 2011). Studies have been conducted to identify soil 

properties and processes that are suitable for evaluating soil quality, soil degradation and their 

impact on ecosystem services. Soil organic matter (SOM) depletion (DON; SCHUMACHER; 

FREIBAUER, 2011; MELLO et al., 2014; FRANCO et al., 2015) and loss of soil nutrients 

such as phosphorus (P) associated with the SOM (MacDONALD; BENNETT; TARANU, 

2012; AGUIAR et al., 2013; HAMER et al., 2013; FONTE et al., 2014; FRANCO et al., 

2015; NESPER et al., 2015) have been appointed as important indicators of soil quality 

degradation. Phosphorus is an important indicator, especially in tropical regions, because it is 

a major limiting factor for plant growth (ELSER et al., 2007; SHEN et al., 2011; ÅGREN; 

WETTERSTEDT; BILLBERGER, 2012; ELSER, 2012).  

Soil macroinvertebrates, such as beetles, termites and earthworms can improve the 

availability of essential nutrients to plants in tropical soils (OUÉDRAOGO et al., 2005; 

CHAPUIS-LARDY et al., 2011; SEYMOUR et al., 2014). Studies have shown that 

macrofauna can significantly change the biogeochemical P cycle in the soil, usually leading to 

higher soil P availability (LE BAYON; BINET, 2006; CHAPUIS-LARDY et al., 2011). 

Therefore, LUC processes that induce deleterious effects on soil biodiversity probably also 

have adverse implications on P availability. Developing a better understanding of soil P 

dynamics in tropical soils undergoing LUC is necessary, not only to improve P-use efficiency, 

but also to reduce environmental risks (SHEN et al., 2011; MacDONALD et al., 2011; 

ELSER, 2012; STUTTER et al., 2015). 

Soil P is present in organic and inorganic forms, ranging from ionic forms in solution 

to highly stable compounds with SOM and/or clayey minerals (NEGASSA; LEINWEBER, 

2009; SHEN et al., 2011). Organic P (Po) is associated with soil microbial biomass and SOM, 

and generally includes compounds such as phosphomonoesters, phosphodiesters and organic 

polyphosphates (NASH et al., 2014; STUTTER et al., 2015). These compounds vary in P 

availability based on the degree of recalcitrance. Soil inorganic P (Pi) is primarily linked to 

amorphous and crystalline forms of iron (Fe), aluminum (Al) and calcium (Ca), and account 

for a large proportion of total soil P in tropical soils (FONTES; WEED, 1996; NOVAIS; 

SMYTH; NUNES, 2007; GAMA-RODRIGUES et al., 2014). Unfortunately, much of this P 

is unavailable for plant uptake. 



 57 

The distribution of P between organic and inorganic compounds varies, reflecting soil 

use and composition of both natural ecosystems and agroecosystems (WRIGHT, 2009; 

AGUIAR et al., 2013; CREWS; BROOKES, 2014). Therefore, P fractionation and grouping 

into chemically defined pools, such as labile, moderately labile and non-labile (organic and 

inorganic) is useful for quantifying the fate of native and applied P in both systems (CROSS; 

SCHLESINGER, 1995; NEGASSA; LEINWEBER, 2009; WRIGHT, 2009; RISKIN et al., 

2013; CREWS; BROOKES, 2014). Similarly, the distribution and dynamics of P pools can 

also be used to predict the effects of LUC on soil quality and to determine potential 

limitations when establishing new land uses (AGUIAR et al., 2013).  

In a recent study, the microbe and plant-available P pool was not significantly affected 

by LUC in sugarcane expansion areas (FRANCO et al., 2015). The findings of Franco et al. 

(2015) also suggest that quantifying only the labile forms of P may not be suitable for 

assessing LUC effects on P dynamics in tropical soils, and that less labile forms of P can 

better elucidate LUC effects. Our objective was to quantify effects of the most common LUC 

sequence associated with sugarcane expansion (i.e., native vegetation to pasture to sugarcane), 

on soil P dynamics and thus determine environmental impacts of LUC on weathered Brazilian 

soils. We hypothesized that LUC from natural to anthropogenic ecosystems would result in 

soil P-pool modifications that could indicate soil degradation.  

 

3.2 Material and Methods 

 

3.2.1 Study sites and experimental design  

 

The study sites and experimental design were described in the 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 items. 

 

3.2.2 Soil sampling and phosphorus fractionation  

 

Soil sampling was completed in January 2013. At each land-use four repetitions 

consisting of 12 subsamples each were collected from the 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm depth 

around the center point using a Dutch auger. Samples were sieved through a 2-mm screen and 

dried at 50 °C prior to P determinations. Other soil chemical properties and particle sizes were 

analyzed and correlated with the P pools. Additionally, undisturbed soil samples were 

collected to measure soil bulk density using a metal cylinder (height 5 cm x internal diameter 



 58 

5 cm, approx. 100 cm
-3

). Those values were subsequently used to calculate the P stocks for 

each layer. 

Phosphorus pools were obtained by measuring inorganic P (Pi) and organic P (Po) as 

described by Hedley, Stewart and Chauhan (1982) and subsequently modified by Condron, 

Goh and Newman, (1985). Phosphorus was extracted sequentially from dry 0.5-g soil samples 

in the following order: anion exchange resin membrane (Piresin fraction), 0.5 M of sodium 

bicarbonate (NaHCO3) (Pibic and Pobic fractions), 0.1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) (Pihyd01 

and Pohyd01 fractions), 1.0 M of chloridric acid (HCl) (PiHCl fraction) and 0.5 M of NaOH 

(Pihyd05 and Pohyd05 fractions). The remaining soil was oven dried and digested with H2SO4 + 

H2O2 (Presidual fraction) to determine residual P. Phosphorus concentrations in the acid extracts 

were determined using the Murphy and Riley (1962) method. Inorganic P (Pi) fractions in the 

alkaline extracts (NaHCO3 and NaOH) were determined using the Dick and Tabatabai (1977) 

method. After determining total P in the alkaline extracts by digesting with ammonium 

persulfate + H2SO4 in an autoclave, organic P (Po) was estimated by calculating the difference 

between total P and Pi in the various fractions.  

Phosphorus fractions obtained by the Hedley fractionation were grouped into pools 

according to their plant availability as “Labile P” (Piresin + Pibic + Pobic), “Moderately labile P” 

(Pihyd01 + Pohyd01 + PiHCl) and “Non-labile P” (Pihyd05 + Pohyd05 + Presidual). In addition, P 

fractions were grouped as proposed by Cross and Schlesinger (1995) into biological and 

geochemical P pools, where the former includes all organic fractions (Pobic + Pohyd01 + Pohyd05) 

and the latter includes all inorganic fractions and residual P (Piresin + Pibic + PiHCl + Pihyd01 + 

Pihyd05 + Presidual). 

 

3.2.3 Soil attributes and macrofauna variables  

 

A dataset of soil chemical attributes and clay content provided by Cherubin et al. 

(2015)
1
 was used to verify their correlation with soil P pools. Those measurements were made 

on soil samples collected at the same sites and sampling times here reported for P 

fractionation. 

The role of soil macroinvertebrates in mediating changes in P pools under the LUC 

scenarios was studied correlating data of soil P pools with data of macrofauna variables 

provided by Franco (2015) at the same site and time studied here. Briefly, at each soil

 Data presented in the chapter 2. 



 59 

sampling point macrofauna numbers were determined using the standard Tropical Soil 

Biology and Fertility Institute soil monolith method (ANDERSON; INGRAM, 1993). Soil 

monoliths (25 x 25 x 10 cm) were extracted from 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm soil layers and 

the macrofauna were sorted immediately after sampling. The faunal density was calculated as 

the number of individuals per surface unit (m
2
). Ecological indexes were calculated for 

assessing richness (Margalef’s index), diversity (Shannon’s index), evenness (Pielou’s index) 

and dominance of species (Simpson`s index) according to the methods described by Magurran 

(2004). The functional diversity of sampled macrofauna was determined through of taxa 

classification according to their ecological functions. This included species considered to be 

herbivorous (Dermaptera and Hemiptera), detritivorous (Blattodea, Diplopoda, Diptera, 

Gastropoda, Isopoda, Isoptera and Oligochaeta) or predators (Aranae, Chilopoda, Coleoptera, 

Formicidae, Hymenoptera and Scorpiones) (BROWN et al., 2001; JEFFERY et al., 2010). 

 

3.2.4 Data analyses  

 

The P stocks were calculated for each sampling point by multiplying P concentrations 

by soil bulk density and layer thickness (10 cm) before averaging the values for each site. 

Phosphorus stocks within pasture and sugarcane sites were adjusted to an equivalent soil mass 

corresponding native vegetation to measure effects of LUC on soil bulk density (LEE et al., 

2009). An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was computed using PROC GLM procedure to test 

the influence of the LUC within each site on P pools. If the ANOVA was significant (p&lt;0.05), 

the means were compared using Tukey’s test (p&lt;0.05). An additional ANOVA was computed 

to test the LUC effects in regional scale (global average at the results found at the three 

locations). In this case, each site was considered a block. Means were also compared using 

Tukey’s test (p&lt;0.05). A Pearson’s correlation analysis (p&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.05) was performed 

using PROC CORR procedure among P pools, soil chemical attributes and clay content. A 

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was also performed using PROC FACTOR procedure 

to visualize the relationship between P pools and soil macrofauna variables. All statistical 

analyses were completed using the Statistical Analysis System – SAS v.9.3 (SAS Inc., Cary, 

USA).

3.3 Results 

 

3.3.1 Dynamic of P fraction levels under land-use change  

 

Soil P fractions in native vegetation, pasture and sugarcane land uses at the three sites 

are presented in Table 1. Although labile P fractions showed site-specific responses, there was 

an increasing trend within these fractions in sugarcane fields at Lat_17S and Lat_21S, 

presumably in response to mineral phosphate fertilization. However, Presin levels, the plant-

available fraction used as a diagnostic for soil fertility, were very low, averaged 4.21, 8.63 

and 3.64 mg kg
-1 

for the 0-30 cm soil layer at Lat_17S, Lat_21S and Lat_23S, respectively. 

Furthermore, this fraction represented between 0.4 to 2.0% of the total soil P. At Lat_23S 

there was much less inorganic P in labile fractions (Presin and Pibic) within sugarcane soil than 

within native vegetation or pasture soils (Table 1). However, use of organic wastes as 

fertilizers for sugarcane production increased the Pobic fraction (labile pool), which was higher 

than in native vegetation and pasture, but does not ensure adequate soil Presin levels for the 

sugarcane crop. 

Long-term conversion from native vegetation to extensive pasture depleted soil P 

levels, especially for moderately labile (Pihyd01, Pohyd01 and PiHCl) and non-labile (Pihyd05, 

Pohyd05 and Presidual) P fractions; this depletion occurred at both Lat_17S and Lat_21S sites 

(Table 1). Sugarcane cultivation increased total P to levels similar or higher than those within 

native vagetation as a consequence of successive mineral and organic P fertilizer inputs. 

Fertilizer P in sugarcane areas was distributed among all P fractions, but the main effect was 

to mineral-associated fractions (inorganic P) which are strongly adsorbed and have low plant-

availability (moderately and non-labile P fractions).

3.3.2 Labile, moderately labile and non-labile P pool stocks 

 

Labile P (0-30 cm) showed few significant differences among land uses. The native 

vegetation (Cerrado biome) at Lat_17S (Figure 1A) had lower labile P stocks (82 kg ha
-1

) than 

the pasture (110 kg ha
-1

) and sugarcane (108 kg ha
-1

) areas. At Lat_21S (Figure 1B), P stocks 

at pasture sites (122 kg ha
-1

) were significantly lower than native vegetation (150 kg ha
-1

) and 

sugarcane (177 kg ha
-1

). Labile P stocks were not affected by the three land uses studied 

within the Lat_23S (Figure 1C), nor were they different on the regional scale (Figure 1D) 

averaging 94 and 115 kg ha
-1

, respectively. Therefore, in general, labile P stocks showed no 

change over time, although there was a small decreasing trend due to conversion from native 

vegetation to pasture and a slight increase with the conversion from pasture to sugarcane 

(Figure 2A). The labile P pool represents a small portion of total P reserves (Figure 1E), with 

relative contributions ranging from 5 (sugarcane) to 18% (pasture) at Lat_17S; 9 (native 

vegetation) to 11% (pasture and sugarcane) at Lat_21S; and a mean of 4% for all land uses at 

Lat_23S. Considering the three sites, the average values ranged from 6 (native vegetation and 

sugarcane) to 8% (pasture) (Figure 1F).  

The LUC effects were higher for P stocks in more recalcitrant pools, such as 

moderately labile and non-labile fractions. The LUC from native vegetation to pasture 

promoted a significant depletion (36%) in moderately labile P stocks (from 333 to 214 kg ha
-

1
) and 32% depletion in non-labile P stocks (from 1422 to 961 kg ha

-1
) at the regional scale 

(Figure 1D). Overall, the change rates of moderately labile and non-labile P stocks due to 

conversion from native vegetation to pasture were -3.6 and -14.0 kg ha
-1

yr
-1

, respectively 

(Figure 2A). The LUC from pasture to sugarcane affected moderately labile and non-labile P 

pools differently at the three sites (Figure 1A-C), but in general, the results show a significant 

increase in the less labile forms in sugarcane soils (Lat_17S and Lat_21S). At the regional 

scale, these results were confirmed (Figure 1D), indicating that replacing pasture with 

sugarcane significantly increased moderately labile (39.5 kg ha
-1

yr
-1

)
 
and non-labile (101.9 kg 

ha
-1

yr
-1

)
 
P stocks (Figure 2B). We highlighted that part of this high P accumulation rates for 

regional scale are due to higher rates found at Lat_17S (Figure 2B), where pasture soil 

presents less clay content than sugarcane soil.

Figure 2 - Annual changes in labile, moderately labile and non-labile phosphorus stocks (A 

and B) and biological, geochemical and total phosphorus stock (C and D) for the 

0-30 cm soil layer, as function of the land-use change from native vegetation to 

pasture (NV - PA) (left) and from pasture to sugarcane (PA - SC) (right) in central-

southern Brazil 

 

The moderately labile P pool contributed approximately 20% to the total P stock at the 

three sites, and averaged 18% in native vegetation, 17% in pasture and 19% in sugarcane 

(Figure 1E). In contrast, the non-labile P pool represented approximately 75% of the total P 

stock, with relative contributions ranging from 65 to 83% at the three sites studied (Figure 

1E). At the regional scale, land use had no detectable effect on the soil P pools since relative 

values among all land uses were very similar, especially for moderately labile and non-labile 

pools (Figure 1F).

3.3.3 Biological, geochemical and total P pool stocks 

 

Although there were few variations among land uses (Figure 3A), conversion from 

native vegetation to pasture decreased P stocks in both biological and geochemical pools 

(Figure 3C) at average rates of -3.1 kg ha
-1

 and -14.6 kg ha
-1

, respectively (Figure 2C).

in central-southern Brazil. *Mean values within each site followed by the same letter do not

Changes in total P stocks due to LUC (Figure 3) showed a consistent pattern but 

differed substantially in magnitude among the three sites. For example, 33 years after native 

vegetation was converted to pasture, P depletions ranged from 1,388 to 600 kg ha
-1

 (-56.7%) 

at Lat_17S, from 1,752 to 1,095 kg ha
-1

 (-37.5%) at Lat_21S, and from 2,457 to 2,154 kg ha
-1

 

(-12.3%) at Lat_23S (Figure 3A). Considering the three sites together, in a regional scale, the 

average total P stock decreased from 1,866 in native vegetation soils to 1,283 kg ha
-1

 in 

pasture soils. This total P decrease (-31.2%) occurred at an average rate of -18 kg ha
-1

yr
-1 

(Figure 2C). Conversion of pasture to sugarcane increased total P stocks at all sites (Figure 

3A). At the regional scale, total P stocks increased from 1,283 in pasture soils to 1,992 kg ha
-1

 

in sugarcane soils (Figure 3C) at an average rate of 145.6 kg ha
-1

yr
-1 

(Figure 2D). Therefore, 

sugarcane soils currently have similar or higher P stocks than under native vegetation.  

The relative proportion of biological and geochemical P pools within total P was 

affected by clay content (Figure 3B). Therefore, the P linked to organic composts had a higher 

contribution to total P stocks within sandy soil at Lat_21S (ranging from 39 to 44%), than 

within clay soils at Lat_23S (ranging from 11 to 16%). On average, biological P accounted for 

approximately 25% of the total P, but when analyzed separately, biological P represented 

more than 50% of labile and moderately labile P (Figure 4). Among the three land uses, 

biological P accounted for 58, 55, and 45% of the labile P pool within pasture, sugarcane and 

native vegetation sites, respectively. For moderately labile P, biological P accounted for 52, 

51, and 57%, respectively.

3.3.4 Relationship among P pools, soil chamical attributes and clay content 

 

Soil P pools are strongly correlated with other soil chemical properties and clay 

content, as indicated by significant linear correlations for 43 (p&lt;0.01) and 50 (p&lt;0.05) of the 

60 pairs of soil properties studied (Table 2). Labile P was positively correlated with acidity 

attributes (BS, r = 0.51 and pH, r = 0.43), cations (Ca, r = 0.47; Mg, r = 0.44; K, r = 0.37), 

SOM (SOC, r = 0.23 and TN, r = 0.35) and CECpH7 (r = 0.33), but negatively (although not 

significantly) correlated with clay content. Moderately labile P was significantly correlated 

with all soil variables, showing even stronger positive relationships with clay content (r = 

0.62), SOC (r = 0.65), TN (r = 0.65) and CECpH7 (r = 0.57). Non-labile P was similar to the 

moderately labile P, although it was not correlated with pH. Overall, soil acidity had a greater 

effect on labile P, while clay content, SOM (SOC and NT) and CECpH7 were more closely 

related to the moderately and non-labile P pools.

Biological P showed even higher positive correlations with acidity attributes (BS, r = 

0.54 and pH, r = 0.50) and cations (Ca, r = 0.46 and Mg, r = 0.27), but was negatively 

correlated with clay content (r = -0.32). Geochemical P and clay contents had the highest 

positive correlation (r = 0.92). Geochemical P was correlated with all soil chemical properties, 

except the acidity attributes (pH and BS) and Ca. Biological P was also had lower correlations 

with soil chemical properties and clay content than geochemical P.   

Total P stocks were positively correlated with all studied soil properties following the 

trend already observed for the geochemical P pool, emphasizing the highest correlations with 

clay content (r = 0.86) and SOM (SOC, r = 0.72 and NT, r = 0.69). 

 

3.3.5 Relationship between P pools and macrofauna 

 

The relationships between soil P pools and soil macrofauna are shown in Figure 5. 

First two axes explained 70% of the data variance. Although macrofauna variables were not 

associated with the soil total P, taxonomic richness, macrofauna diversity and evenness were 

closely and positively related to the labile P pool and biological P pool. Positive relationships 

were also found between the functional diversity of the macrofaunal community (i.e., the 

number of functional groups found in a sample) and the biological and labile P pools. The 

functional diversity was associated with the biological variables richness, diversity and 

evenness. In contrast, macrofauna density and dominance of species showed negative 

correlations with labile and biological P and with all the other biological variables. Total P 

content was strongly related with moderately-labile P, no-labile P and geochemical P pools.

3.4 Discussion 

 

3.4.1 Sugarcane expansion and its implications on P dynamic  

 

Labile P fractions are the primary P source for plant growth, but those fractions 

represented less than 10% of the total soil P, which is similar to the proportion reported by 

Riskin et al. (2013) and Rodrigues et al. (2016). Overall, LUC from native vegetation to 

pasture had no significant effect in labile P pool (Figure 1D), although there was a decreasing 

trend within this pool for the Presin fraction, as reported by Cherubin et al. (2015). Another 

large, paired-comparison study recently carried out in Brazil (GROPPO et al., 2015) 

concluded that LUC from native vegetation to well-managed pasture led to increase of plant-

available inorganic P. However, when assessed in a regional survey that better represented the 

status of the Brazilian extensive pastures (as those here studied) there were reductions of 

plant-available inorganic P stocks in pasture compared to native vegetation soils.

The conversion of natural ecosystems or pastures for agricultural purposes in tropical 

soils generally increases labile P pool due to low native P levels in natural ecosystem/pastures 

and inputs by phosphate fertilizers, as reported by Negassa and Leinweber (2009). The 

assumption that increasing pH increases plant-available P (HAYNES, 1984) was also 

confirmed by positive correlations between labile P and acidity attributes (Table 2). Our 

findings are in line with several studies carried out in Brazil. Pavinato, Merlin and Rosolem 

(2009) and Rodrigues et al. (2016) indicated that P applied through phosphate fertilization 

increased the inorganic labile and moderately labile P fractions in Oxisols from the Brazilian 

Cerrado. Aguiar et al. (2013) reported higher inorganic labile P levels under agricultural uses 

(alley cropping and no-tillage) compared to a newly cleared area, secondary Amazon forest 

and pasture. In the southeastern Amazon, Riskin at al. (2013) also observed that the 

continuum use of P fertilizer in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] fields led to increased 

inorganic labile P and decreased organic labile P compared to native vegetation. Groppo et al. 

(2015) found significant higher inorganic labile P stocks for the top soil layer (0-30 cm) in 

crop-livestock systems (49.50 kg ha
-1

) than in native vegetation (21.74 kg ha
-1

) in the Cerrado, 

Atlantic Forest, and Pampa biomes. 

There was a higher contribution of organic P (58%) to the labile P pool for pasture 

areas (Table 1; Figure 4) representing significant P-recycling (COSTA et al., 2014; CREWS; 

BROOKES, 2014; FRANCO et al., 2015; STUTTER et al., 2015), where up to 85% of the P 

taken up by plants is returned to the soil through animal dung (NASH et al., 2014) and 

associated with greater soil biological activity (LAVELLE et al., 2014; FRANCO, 2015). 

These results confirm the hypothesis reported in the literature that plant-available P in pasture 

is strongly dependent on mineralization of the Po pool (AGUIAR et al., 2013; HAMER et al., 

2013; CREWS; BROOKES, 2014; FONTE et al., 2014; NASH et al., 2014; FRANCO et al., 

2015; NESPER et al., 2015; STUTTER et al., 2015). Long-term experiments in the USA 

(MOTAVALLI; MILES, 2002) and England (CREWS; BROOKES, 2014) have shown that 

native and perennial grass has capacity to maintain a greater proportion of native or fertilizer-

P in relatively available organic forms compared to annual wheat (Triticum aestivum). These 

studies supported that increased P availability is due to a transformation of stable residual P 

into active Po. In addition, grazing appears to contribute to the regulation of labile P cycling 

in pasture conditions (COSTA et al., 2014). More recently, a large study carried out in the UK 

(STUTTER et al., 2015) found predominance of organic P forms (e.g., monoesters, diester, 

polyphosphates and other) in extensive grasslands soils, while inorganic P forms 

(orthophosphates) were more important in arable soils. Greater concentrations of microbial P 



 71 

forms in extensive grassland indicate presence of an active microbial population efficient in 

turnover of soil organic P in conditions of limited readily available inorganic P (STUTTER et 

al., 2015). 

Overall, a depletion in P stocks was observed after 33 years of conversion from native 

vegetation to pasture, especially for the moderately and non-labile pools (Figures 1 and 2). 

These decreases are the result of P exploitation over time due to grazing without any P 

fertilizer inputs (GROPPO et al., 2015). This further emphasizes that inappropriate 

management of soil fertility by Brazilian farmers leads to soil degradation and becomes one 

of the major factors for low productivity (i.e., degraded pastures) in approximately 70% of 

Brazilian pasturelands (DIAS-FILHO, 2014; STRASSBURG et al., 2014). Recent studies 

stressed that soil structural degradation in pasture promotes a continuum of P depletions, 

especially organic forms associated with SOM, confirming that similar mechanisms act in the 

protection and stabilization of organic P and SOM in the soil (FONTE et al., 2014; NESPER 

et al., 2015). Although the linkage between SOM and biological organic P levels was not 

significant in this study, we found a strong correlation between total P stock and SOM (Table 

2). 

Expansion of sugarcane over extensive pasture led to P accumulation in less labile P 

pools, such as moderately labile and non-labile fractions (Figures 1 and 2), which are the 

primary fates of P from fertilizers in soil (NEUFELDT et al., 2000; NEGASSA; 

LEINWEBER, 2009; PAVINATO; MERLIN; ROSOLEM, 2009; WRIGHT, 2009; SHEN et 

al., 2011; RISKIN et al., 2013; RODRIGUES et al., 2016). These finding are consistent with 

other studies, that have found higher P accumulation in mineral-associated fractions (P sinks), 

particularly the Ca-bound fraction in temperate soils (CASTILHO; WRIGHT, 2008; 

NEGASSA; LEINWEBER, 2009; WRIGHT, 2009) as well as Fe- and Al-bound fractions in 

tropical soils (NEUFELDT et al., 2000; NEGASSA; LEINWEBER, 2009; PAVINATO; 

MERLIN; ROSOLEM, 2009; AGUIAR et al., 2013; RISKIN et al., 2013; RODRIGUES et 

al., 2016), such as the highly weathered soils evaluated in this study. When P from mineral 

fertilizers is added to soil it is quickly adsorbed or precipitated in mineral forms. First, an 

electrostatic attraction (reversible) occurs between the P (orthophosphate) and soil minerals 

(NOVAIS; SMYTH; NUNES, 2007), primarily on the edges of silicates, crystalline Fe and Al 

oxides, and amorphous Al oxides (FONTES; WEED, 1996). These attractions become 

stronger over time, and a specific adsorption or chemisorption (irreversible) occurs with a 

ligand-exchange (NOVAIS; SMYTH; NUNES, 2007).  



 72 

An analysis of global agricultural P budgets, based in input and output rates, showed 

that the top quartile of P surpluses (accumulation in the soil) to be those with more than 13 kg 

ha
-1

yr
-1 

(MacDONALD et al., 2011), indicating the high accumulation P rates found in our 

weathered Brazilian soils under sugarcane production (Figure 2) are among the highest P 

accumulation rates reported for world croplands. However, despite this high rate of total P 

accumulation, only a small amount was in labile forms (4.4 kg ha
-1

yr
-1

); consequently, the 

amount of available P to support sugarcane growth was not enhanced [i.e., Presin levels (Table 

1) were lower than the recommended 15 mg kg
-1 

critical level (ESPIRONELLO et al., 1997)]. 

In terms of environmental impacts, although a large amount of P has being annually 

accumulated in the soil, the strong sorption capacity of these weathered soils suggests that 

LUC associated with agricultural expansion in Brazil has a low risk for P losses to waterways 

(RISKIN et al., 2013) and subsequent eutrophication of water resources. 

Phosphorus from organic residues (e.g., vinasse and filter cake) increased the organic 

labile P pool in sugarcane fields (see Lat_23S, Table 1). In these conditions, similarly to 

pasture, the supply of P in forms available to plants depends on mineralization of organic P; 

nevertheless, lower soil biological activity in sugarcane fields (FRANCO, 2015) may result in 

lower turnover of soil organic P, and consequently, an insufficient P supply for the sugarcane 

crop. The release of P from crop residues is significantly reduced in systems where the P-

status of crops and soils is low, requiring strong integration between organically cycled P with 

fertilizer management strategies (DAMON et al., 2014). Therefore, we suggest that 

fertilization strategies include a balance between organic and mineral P sources to improve 

both sugarcane yield and soil quality. 

The geochemical and biological P pools represented around 75 and 25% of the total P 

stock, respectively. These proportions were similar to values reported in the literature 

(NEUFELDT et al., 2000; NZIGUHEBA; BÜNEMANN, 2005; PAVINATO; MERLIN; 

ROSOLEM, 2009; SHEN et al., 2011; RODRIGUES et al., 2016). However, when only labile 

and moderately labile pools are considered, biological P represents more than 50% of total P, 

indicating a great importance of SOM-cycling to P plant-availability in both natural 

ecosystems and agroecosystems. Soil organic matter is often the major storehouse of soil P, 

accounting for 30 to 65% of total P (SHEN et al., 2011). In highly weathered tropical soils the 

pools of organic P and decomposition of SOM are critical for plant productivity (CROSS; 

SCHLESINGER, 1995), and the maintenance of P in organic forms is the key for a long-term 

functioning and productivity of these soils (FONTE et al., 2014; NESPER et al., 2015; 

RODRIGUES et al., 2016), since the biological P pool is less susceptible to sorption reactions 



 73 

(CROSS; SCHLESINGER, 1995). Future researches using techniques such as 
31

P NMR are 

necessary to identify organic P forms (see NASH et al., 2014, STUTTER et al., 2015 and 

KRUSE et al., 2015) and their effects on P-cycling and P plant-availability in areas 

undergoing LUC for expansion of biofuel crops. 

 

3.4.2 Implications of macrofauna on P cycling  

 

Overall, biological P pool showed lower correlations with soil chemical properties and 

clay content than the geochemical P pool (Table 2), indicating that soil biological properties 

and processes (e.g., macrofauna, symbiotic actions between soil microorganisms and plants; 

actions of enzymes released by plant roots and microorganisms) and soil physical and 

structural conditions (FONTE et al., 2014; NESPER et al., 2015) should be considered to 

understand the dynamic of the biological P pool in the soil. This assumption was confirmed, 

since positive relationship was found between soil macrofauna diversity and biological P pool 

(Figure 5). The disconnection between total P contents and biological variables can be 

explained by the fact that the geochemical P pool (especially non-labile P forms) comprised 

around 75% of the total P at all the field sites (Figure 3). 

In this study, higher densities of macrofauna animals were specially related to the 

wide dominance of termites in the communities of pasture soils at Lat_17S and Lat_23S 

(FRANCO, 2015). It was clearly the cause of the negative relationships between macrofauna 

density and the all the others biological variables. In accordance with our findings, studies 

have shown that functional diversity of the soil macrofaunal community affects 

decomposition processes and nutrient cycling (HEEMSBERGEN et al., 2004; ZIMMER; 

KAUTZ; TOPP, 2005; COLLISON; RIUTTA; SLADE, 2013). Heemsbergen et al. (2004) 

observed that functional dissimilarities between soil macrofauna species, irrespectively of the 

number of taxonomic groups, is a driver of ecosystem processes related to nutrient cycling 

due to facilitative interactions among species. Zimmer, Kautz and Topp (2005) reported a 

potential effect on ecosystem functioning through joint action of soil macrofauna even at low 

species diversity. It suggests that the taxa richness was associated with the enrichment of P 

labile forms as an indirect result of the positive correlation between functional diversity and 

taxa richness found in this study (Figure 5). We suggest that correlation between high soil P 

availability and the presence of a functional diverse soil macrofaunal community may be 

linked to a rapid turnover of an increased organic P content. 



 74 

Some studies have described a significant enrichment of labile P forms as a result of 

the activity of macrofaunal groups such as coleoptera (LI et al., 2006), earthworms 

(OUEDRAOGO et al., 2005) and termites (RÜCKAMP et al., 2010). Li et al. (2006) showed 

an increased availability of soil P during the gut passage of scarabaeid beetle (Coleoptera) 

attributed to solubilization and enzymatic hydrolysis of organic P, and desorption of inorganic 

P. The contribution of earthworms to enhance soil P availability is attributed to higher pH of 

the gut content, changes in sorption complexes due to the competition for sorbing sites 

between phosphate and carboxyl groups of a mucus glycoprotein produced in its gut, and an 

increase in microbial activity during digestion (CHAPUIS-LARDY et al., 2011). Termites 

contribute to high levels of soil labile P by the transformation of organic P through enzymatic 

activity in the fresh biostructures (CHAPUIS-LARDY et al., 2011).  

The LUC associated to sugarcane expansion in Brazil causes negative effects in both 

SOC (FRANCO et al., 2015) and soil biodiversity (FRANCO, 2015), which potentially 

aggravates the low plant availability of phosphorus in highly weathered soils, the main costly 

and limiting factor for agricultural productivity in tropical soils. Monitoring soil macrofaunal 

biodiversity to control functional simplification of the community may therefore be an 

efficient management strategy in sugarcane fields for increased soil P availability and likely 

for multiple ecosystem services. 

 

3.4.3 Phosphorus pools as soil quality indicators  

 

Phosphorus is an integral component to ecosystem management because it limits 

primary production in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems (ELSER et al., 2007; ÅGREN;  

WETTERSTEDT; BILLBERGER, 2012; ELSER, 2012). Phosphorus is one of the primary 

limiting nutrients for agricultural production in Brazilian soils due to both inherent 

characteristics to strongly weathered soils and inadequate strategies of P application 

(NOVAIS; SMYTH; NUNES, 2007). Hence, P pools are highly influential on key soil 

functions related to nutrient fluxes and ecosystems services responsible for maintaining a 

suitable soil biotic habitat and sustaining plant growth (DORAN; PARKIN, 1994; LAVELLE 

et al., 2014). Soil quality indicators are defined as those soil properties and processes having 

the greatest sensitivity to changes in soil functions (ANDREWS; KARLEN; 

CAMBARDELLA, 2004). Therefore, for the soils we evaluated soil P pools appear to be 

useful soil quality indicators. 



 75 

Our findings showed modifications of P pools in response to LUC associated with 

sugarcane expansion. Strong correlations among P pools and other soil properties broadly 

used to assess soil degradation, such as SOC, CEC and acidity attributes (DORAN; PARKIN, 

1994; KARLEN et al., 2013), endorse the sensitivity of P pools to changes in soil functions. 

Furthermore, we observed significant correlations between taxonomic richness and diversity, 

and functional diversity of soil macrofauna communities with biological and labile P pools. 

Soil macrofauna have been indicated as an efficient biological indicators of modifications on 

soil quality as response to management or land-use changes (DORAN; ZEISS, 2000; 

ROUSSEAU et al., 2013; LAVELLE et al., 2014). Therefore, P pools warrant further 

investigations as potential soil quality/health indicators able to assess and monitor the soil 

degradation associated to sugarcane expansion for ethanol production in Brazil.  

In addition, future studies should be carried out using an integrated approach to 

understand collectively the LUC effects on isolated indicators, for instance SOC stocks 

(MELLO et al., 2014; FRANCO et al., 2015), soil nutrients (CHERUBIN et al., 2015; 

FRANCO et al., 2015), soil biodiversity, soil structure and physical quality and others, to 

determine the environmental sustainability of Brazilian ethanol. 

 

3.5 Conclusions 

 

This field study carried out across the primary sugarcane producing region in Brazil 

indicated that long-term conversions from native vegetation (Cerrado and Atlantic forest 

biome) to extensive pasture induced significant depletions of soil total P stocks. These results 

showed a critical process of soil chemical degradation, which helps to explain the low 

productivity in most of Brazilian pasturelands. Our findings suggest that under degraded 

pasture, the biological P pool plays crucial role for supplying available P to plants. 

The LUC from pasture to sugarcane altered the P-cycle, increasing P stocks in 

moderately labile and non-labile pools. The fertilization management recovered total P stocks 

of sugarcane soils to similar or higher levels than those measured in natural ecosystems. 

However, although high accumulation rates of P were found, only a small and insufficient 

amount was kept in available forms to plants. Phosphorus inputs from organic residues (e.g., 

filter cake and vinasse) increased the organic labile P and may be a complementary strategy to 

supply P for sugarcane crop. 

Phosphorus pools were significantly correlated with soil chemical attributes. Also, 

functional diversity of soil macrofauna community was positively related with increases of 



 76 

soil P availability to plants, probably as a response to biological P pool increase and its greater 

turnover in the soil. Therefore, we conclude that P pools are useful indicators for detecting 

soil quality/health changes induced by LUC associated to sugarcane expansion in Brazilian 

tropical soils.

4 SOIL PHYSICAL QUALITY RESPONSE TO SUGARCANE EXPANSION IN 

BRAZIL 

 

 

Abstract 

 

Globally, the rate of land-use change (LUC) is increasing rapidly to support biofuel 

feedstock production. In Brazil, sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) expansion to produce 

ethanol is displacing degraded pastures. Intensive mechanization for sugarcane production, 

could impact soil physical quality in these areas. We evaluated a typical LUC sequence (i.e., 

native vegetation – pasture – sugarcane) on soil physical quality at three sites in central-

southern Brazil. The attributes evaluated through on-farm and laboratory soil analyses were: 

bulk density, degree of compactness, macroporosity, microporosity and total porosity, water-

filled pore space, indexes of soil water storage and aeration capacity, soil resistance to 

penetration, field-saturated hydraulic conductivity and stability structural index. Calculations 

of mean weight diameter for the soil aggregates and visual evaluation of soil structure (VESS) 

scores were also included in this study. From those data we defined a minimum dataset for 

calculating an additive soil physical quality index (SPQI). Long-term conversion from native 

vegetation to pasture increased soil compaction (i.e., higher bulk density, degree of 

compactness and resistance to penetration values), decreased aeration porosity and water 

hydraulic conductivity, and consequently, created an unbalanced ratio between water- and air-

filled pore space in the soil. Based on our SPQI, the soil’s capacity to perform its physical 

functions decreased from 90% under native vegetation to 73% under pasture. Land-use 

change from pasture to sugarcane induced slight soil physical quality degradation, in which 

soil function was 68 and 56% of capacity. Overall, soil physical quality decreased under 

sugarcane fields, due to decreases in soil porosity, aeration and water hydraulic conductivity 

as well as increases in soil penetration resistance, structural degradation and erosion risk. 

Tillage operations performed during the sugarcane replanting had a short-term positive effect 

on soil physical quality, although over time it further decreased the resistance to erosion and 

structural degradation. Therefore, to convert degraded pasture to sugarcane in a sustainable 

manner, the soils should be managed in ways that increase the soil organic matter and 

minimize compaction. These actions are needed to prevent further soil physical quality 

degradation and to improve the sustainability of sugarcane ethanol production. 

 

Keywords: Land-use change; Soil compaction; Soil physical functions; Ethanol production 

 

4.1 Introduction 

 

Increasing global demand for biofuel has promoted the intensification of LUC around 

the world, imposing concerns about soil physical quality degradation and its negative 

implications on ecosystem function (GASPARATOS; STROMBERG; TAKEUCHI, 2011; 

FU et al., 2015). Brazil is the largest sugarcane ethanol producer in the world, having 

increased from 5.8 to 9.0 Mha between 2005 and 2015 (COMPANHIA NACIONAL DE 



 84 

ABASTECIMENTO, 2015). To meet projected (2021) domestic supplies for ethanol in 

Brazil, an additional 6.4 Mha of sugarcane is required (GOLDEMBERG et al., 2014). 

Historically sugarcane expansion has been concentrated in central-southern Brazil, 

with 70% of this expansion occurring in degraded pasturelands (ADAMI et al., 2012). The 

development of Brazilian agriculture has seen extensification of pasture into native vegetation 

with poor management practices. This has resulted in loss of soil organic carbon (SOC) and 

soil fertility (MELLO et al., 2014; CHERUBIN et al., 2015; FRANCO et al., 2015). It is 

estimated that 70% of Brazilian pasturelands are degraded or in the process of being degraded 

(DIAS-FILHO, 2014). The vast area of degraded pasture in Brazil, coupled with opportunities 

for improvements in current ranching practices, could provide enough land for sugarcane 

production to meet the projected demand for ethanol, while still meeting the domestic demand 

for other ecosystem services (LAPOLA et al., 2010; GOLDEMBERG et al., 2014). 

In comparison to pasture, sugarcane production requires intensive mechanization 

resulting in changes to soil physical properties and related processes. Soil tillage is used to 

incorporate lime and fertilizer when sugarcane is first established, and again at approximately 

five-year intervals when sugarcane yields begin to decrease and it is replanted. With the 

recent shift to mechanized harvesting, intensive machinery traffic may be contributing to soil 

physical degradation in these areas. Studies have shown increased soil bulk density and soil 

strength (BAQUEIRO et al., 2012; BANGITA; RAO, 2012; SOUZA et al., 2014; 2015), with 

decreases in soil porosity, aeration, aggregation, water infiltration and available water in many 

sugarcane fields (BRAUNACK; McGARRY, 2006; CASTRO et al., 2013; FRANCO, 2015; 

HUNKE et al., 2015b). 

Soil physical quality degradation has adverse impacts on root growth (OTTO et al., 

2011; BAQUEIRO et al., 2012; SOUZA et al., 2014; 2015), often limiting uptake of water 

and nutrients, thus decreasing sugarcane yields (BANGITA; RAO, 2012; SOUZA et al., 

2014). Decreased sugarcane productivity also decreases atmospheric CO2 uptake by above 

and belowground biomass, resulting in lower organic C inputs and a gradual depletion of SOC 

(FRANCO et al., 2015). Decreasing soil physical quality may also reduce ecosystem 

functioning (FU et al., 2015), by accelerating soil C turnover (SIX; ELLIOTT; PAUSTIAN, 

2000), decreasing SOC stocks (MELLO et al., 2014; FRANCO et al., 2015) and increasing 

CO2 emissions (BALL, 2013; SILVA-OLAYA et al., 2013). In terms of biogeochemical 

processes, soil compaction reduces air-filled porosity favoring denitrification (N2O emissions) 

and methanogenesis (CH4 emissions) (BALL, 2013). Runoff and soil erosion risks increase 

because physically degraded soils have lower water infiltration rates (HUNKE et al., 2015a,b) 



 85 

and thus contribute sediment, nutrients, and pesticides to surface waters (GUCKER; 

BOECHAT; GIANI, 2009; HUNKE et al., 2015a,b). Furthermore, soil compaction can also 

modify or destroy native biological habitats, resulting in loss of biodiversity and ecosystem 

function (BENTON; VICKERY; WILSON, 2003). 

Although many technical papers have been published, LUC effects on soil physical 

quality associated with sugarcane expansion in Brazil are still poorly documented. We 

conducted an on-farm study in the largest sugarcane-producing regions of Brazil to: i) 

quantify effects of the primary LUC sequence associated with sugarcane expansion (i.e., 

native vegetation to pasture to sugarcane) on soil physical properties, and ii) integrate the soil 

physical indicators of soil degradation into an additive index for assessing LUC impacts on 

soil physical functioning. We hypothesized that the LUC from native vegetation to pasture 

and then to sugarcane was resulting in continuous degradation of soil physical quality that 

could be detected by computing an overall Soil Physical Quality Index (SPQI). 

 

4.2 Material and Methods 

 

4.2.1 Study sites and experimental design  

 

The study sites and experimental design were described in the 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 items. 

 

4.2.2 Sampling and soil physical measurements 

 

Soil sampling was carried out in January 2014. At each land use (i.e., native 

vegetation, pasture and sugarcane) soil samples were collected using a consistent grid pattern 

composed of nine sampling points spaced 50 m apart, providing a total of 27 sampling points 

for each site (i.e., total of 81 sampling points for the three sites). At each sampling point, a 

small trench (30 x 30 x 30 cm) was opened to collect disturbed and undisturbed soil samples 

from the 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm layers, providing a total of 243 soil samples for soil 

physical analyses. Although root systems of tropical pastures and sugarcane can reach deeper 

soil layers, we limited our assessment to 30 cm because most of roots are concentrated in this 

layer (BALL-COELHO et al., 1992; KANNO et al., 1999) and this is the zone where more 

significant soil physical property changes are induced by land use and management practices. 

The sampling points for each land use were positioned in representative locations within the 

total area sampled. In native vegetation areas we avoided sampling close to ant or termite 



 86 

nests, burrows of wild animals and big trees. In pasture areas, which were continuously and 

uniformly grazed, our major caution was to avoid sampling on the preferential cattle 

trampling paths, where the soil is much more compacted. Except at Lat_17S where the soil 

had been recently tilled for sugarcane replanting, all sampling points in sugarcane fields were 

located within the inter-row position, which is homogeneously tracked during harvest 

operations.  

Measurements of soil resistance to penetration (SRP) were taken around the soil 

sampling trenches to a depth of 30 cm using a digital penetrometer (PenetroLOG
®
). Five 

replicates were used to compute an average value for each sampling point. Field-saturated 

hydraulic conductivity (Kfs) was measured using the ‘simplified falling-head’ method 

proposed by Bagarello, Iovino and Elrick (2004) and later used by Keller et al. (2012). Three 

replicate Kfs measurements for each sampling point were made using steel cylinders (height 

15 cm x internal diameter 15 cm), inserted 8 cm into the soil and 330 ml of water applied 

according to Keller et al. (2012).  

In the laboratory, disturbed soil samples were used to determine particle size using the 

hydrometer method (GEE; OR, 2002). The undisturbed soil samples were weighed (initial soil 

water content), saturated for 48 h by gradually raising the water level in a tray and weighed 

again. Soil water content at -6 kPa and -10 kPa water potentials were determined using 

tension tables similar to those described by Ball and Hunter (1988). The soil samples were 

then dried at 105
o
C for 48 hours and weighed again. Bulk density (BD, Mg m

-3
) was 

calculated by dividing the soil dry mass by volume of the cylinder. The maximum bulk 

density (BDmax, Mg m
-3

) was estimated using a pedotransfer function described by Marcolin 

and Klein (2011), in which SOM and clay content are the input parameters. Based on the BD 

and BDmax the soil degree of compactness (SDC, %) was calculated [SDC = (BD/BDmax) x 

100]. Soil particle density (PD, Mg m
-3

) was determined from sub-samples (5g) using a gas 

pycnometer according to Flint and Flint (2002). The total porosity (TP, m
3
 m

-3
) was 

calculated as TP = 1 - (BD/PD). Soil macroporosity (MaP, m
3
 m

-3
) was computed as the 

difference between soil water content at saturation and at -6 kPa. Soil microporosity (MiP, m
3
 

m
-3

) was estimated as the soil water content at the -6 kPa. Water-filled pore space (WFPS) 

was calculated by dividing volumetric moisture at -6 kPa by TP as described by Wienhold et 

al. (2009). In addition, we calculated two indexes according to Reynolds et al. (2002): i) the 

soil water storage capacity (SWSC) defined as the ratio between water content at field 

capacity (FC, -10 kPa soil water potential) and TP (SWSC = FC/TP); ii) soil aeration capacity 



 87 

(SAC) calculated as the ratio between drained pores at soil water potential of -10 kPa (ACt) 

and TP (SAC = ACt/TP).  

The risk of soil structural degradation was assessed using the “structural stability 

index” (SSI), according to Reynolds et al. (2009): SSI = [(SOC x 1.724) / (silt + clay)]*100, 

where, SOC is the organic carbon content (g kg
-1

); 1.724 is a factor to convert SOC to SOM; 

silt and clay are particle size fractions (g kg
-1

). 

Mean weight diameter of soil aggregates (MWD) and VESS scores were used to 

verify the correlation with other soil physical properties and calculate an index of SPQ. The 

MWD and VESS data were taken from Franco (2015) and Cherubin et al. (2016)
2
, 

respectively, which were measured from soil samples collected at the same sites and sampling 

times.  

 

4.2.3 Soil Physical Quality Index calculation 

 

An overall soil physical quality index (SPQI) was calculated to quantify LUC effects 

associated with sugarcane expansion in Brazil. Development of the SPQI followed three steps 

as outlined by Karlen and Stott (1994) and Karlen, Ditzler and Andrews (2003). The first step 

was to select appropriate SPQ indicators to represent and monitor four critical soil physical 

functions. They were to: f(i): support root growth; f(ii): supply water for plants and edaphic 

fauna; f(iii): allow gas exchange between soil and atmosphere (soil aeration); and f(iv): ability 

to resist erosion and soil degradation. These functions are essential to sustain plant 

productivity and maintain ecosystem services.  

Based on published literature and the authors’ experience, eight indicators (BD, VESS 

score, SWSC, Kfs, MaP, SAC, MWD and SSI) were used as a minimum dataset to determine 

how well the four critical soil physical functions were being performed under the three land 

uses. The second step (indicator interpretation) involved transforming each indicator into a 

unitless value ranging from 0 to 1 for inclusion in the SPQI. The soil data from 0-10, 10-20 

and 20-30 cm were averaged to 0-30 cm layer to calculate an overall soil physical quality 

index that better represents the whole soil profile assessed. The transformation was performed 

using a linear technique as described by Andrews, Karlen and Mitchell (2002). Indicators 

were ranked in ascending or descending order depending on whether a higher value was 

considered “good” or “bad” in terms of soil function. For ‘more is better’ indicators, such as 

                                                 

2
 Data presented in the chapter 5. 



 88 

MaP, Kfs MWD and SSI, each observation was divided by the highest observed value such 

that the highest observed value received a score of 1. For ‘less is better’ indicators, such as 

BD and VESS, the lowest observed value (in the numerator) was divided by each observation 

(in the denominator) such that the lowest observed value receives a score of 1. For ‘optimum’ 

indicators, such as SWSC and SAC observations were scored as ‘higher is better’ up to a 

threshold value (SWSC = 0.66 and SAC = 0.33) then scored as ‘lower is better’ above the 

threshold.  

For step 3, the transformed indicator values were multiplied by their weight. These 

results were summed within each soil physical function, resulting in a scored soil physical 

function. Subsequently, the individual scores of soil physical function were multiplied by 

their weight. Finally, these weighed scores were summed to calculate the SPQI. In Table 1 the 

step by step procedure used for developing the SPQI is shown. Soil physical function scores 

and SPQI scores for each sample were averaged and standard deviations were calculated for 

each land use. In addition, two scenarios were compared to verify soil physical quality effects 

of tillage operations performed during the sugarcane replanting.

4.2.4 Data analyses 

 

Data were tested for normality using Shapiro-Wilk’s tests (p&gt;0.05), indicating that 

data transformation was not required. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test 

LUC effects on soil physical properties. If the ANOVA results were significant (p&lt;0.05), 

average soil physical property values were compared using Tukey’s test (p&lt;0.05). In addition, 

a Pearson’s correlation analysis (p&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.05) was performed using PROC CORR 



 89 

procedure among soil physical attributes and SOC. The scores calculated for each soil 

physical function and the SPQI were compared using Tukey’s test (p&lt;0.05). All statistical 

analyses were carried out using the Statistical Analysis System – SAS v.9.3 (SAS Inc., Cary, 

USA). 

 

4.3 Results 

 

4.3.1 Bulk density (BD) and soil degree of compactness (SDC)  

 

Conversion from native vegetation to pasture increased BD in all soil layers at all sites 

(Figure 1). Bulk density within the 0-30 cm layer was 23%, 19% and 28% lower in native 

vegetation compared to pasture at Lat_17S, Lat_21S and Lat_23S, respectively. Conversion 

from pasture to sugarcane had no significant effect on BD except for the sugarcane field at 

Lat_17S which was undergoing replanting (tillage operations) when soils were sampled. 

Tillage reduced BD in the surface layer (0-10 cm), but overall, BD tended to increase below 

10 cm for all sites and land uses.  

Land-use change had a significant effect on the SDC (Figure 1), showing an 

increasing transition from native vegetation to pasture of 14%, 19% and 23% at the Lat_17S, 

Lat_21S and Lat_23S, respectively. Conversion from pasture to sugarcane had no significant 

effect on SDC, except in the upper layer (0-10 cm) of the sugarcane field undergoing 

replanting (Lat_17S), where it was lower. Overall, SDC values ranged from 67 to 79% ( ? 

73%) under native vegetation, 84 to 98% ( ? 90%) under pasture and 74 to 100% ( ? 90%) for 

sugarcane soils.

4.3.2 Soil porosity 

 

Soil porosity components were very sensitive to LUC (Figure 2), especially 

macroporosity (MaP), Figure 2A-C. At Lat_17S (Figure 2A), MaP was approximately 0.25

 in pasture (0-30 cm). Tillage increased the MaP 

under sugarcane (0.27 m

) in the upper layer (0-10 cm), but within deeper layers, it was 

significantly lower than in pasture (10-20cm) or native vegetation (10-20 and 20-30 cm). At 

the Lat_21S (Figure 2B) and Lat_23S (Figure 2C) significant decreases in MaP were 

associated with LUC from native vegetation to pasture, with averages of 0.22 and 0.25 m

in native vegetation and 0.07 (-68%) and 0.03 m

The microporosity (MiP) responded differently than the MaP to the effects of LUC, 

where MiP in sugarcane and pasture soils were greater than soils under native vegetation 

(Figure 2D-F). Total porosity (TP) decreased significantly due to LUC (Figure 2G-I), which 

was greater under native vegetation &gt; sugarcane ? pasture. At the Lat_17S site, MaP and MiP 

within the 0-10 cm layer were not significantly different under sugarcane compared to native 

vegetation. Overall, water-filled pore space (WFPS) increased significantly due to our LUC 

sequence (Figure 2K-M). At Lat_17S and Lat_23S the highest WFPS values (~0.6) were 

found in sugarcane soils. At Lat_23S, WFPS values reached approximately 0.85 in pasture 

and sugarcane soils.  

 

4.3.3 Soil water storage capacity (SWSC) and soil aeration capacity (SAC) 

 

Overall, LUC induced significant changes in SAC and SWSC (Figure 3). At Lat_17S, 

conversion from native vegetation to pasture had no significant impacts on SAC, with values 

of approximately 0.5. Significant reductions on SAC were verified in deeper layers (10-20 

and 20-30 cm) in sugarcane, with values reaching 0.3 (Figure 3A). At Lat_21S and Lat_23S 

LUC effects on SAC (Figure 3B, C) were more significant, with higher values in soils under 

native vegetation averaging 0.57 and 0.43. Conversion from native vegetation to pasture 

decreased SAC to average values of 0.31 and 0.08, indicating reductions of 45% and 81%, 

respectively. Establishment of sugarcane under pasture, in general, had no significant 

influence on SAC. 

Transition from native vegetation to pasture significantly increased SWSC at Lat_21S 

and Lat_23S reaching average values of 0.69 and 0.92 in pasture, respectively. Under 

sugarcane at Lat_17S, significant increases in SWSC were observed in deeper layers when 

compared to native vegetation and pasture, with values of 0.72 for the 10-20 cm layer and 

0.69 for the 20-30 cm layer (Figure 3A). At Lat_21S and Lat_23S there was no clear trend in 

upper soil layers (i.e., pasture had higher SWSC than sugarcane soils at one site, but a lower 

value at the other site). For deeper layers, there were no detectable differences between 

pasture and sugarcane soils (Figure 3B, C).

4.3.4 Field-satured hydraulic conductivity (Kfs) 

 

Higher Kfs values were obtained under native vegetation at Lat_21S and Lat_23S, with 

averages of 122 and 39 cm h
-1

, respectively (Figure 4). At Lat_17S, Kfs under native 

vegetation (147 cm h
-1

) was also high, but lower than within sugarcane which had just been 

tilled for replanting. The LUC from native vegetation to pasture resulted in drastic reductions 

(76, 98 and 97%) in Kfs at all sites. Under sugarcane, Kfs values were 97 and 98% lower than 

those measured within native vegetation soils at Lat_21S and Lat_23S (Figure 4B, C), but 

there was no difference when compared with values measured within pasture soils. On the 

other hand, Kfs increased from 36 cm h
-1

 in pasture to 250 cm h
-1

 in sugarcane at Lat_17S 

(Figure 4A).

4.3.5 Soil resistance to penetration (SRP) 

 

Soil resistance to penetration (SRP) was significantly higher in pasture and sugarcane 

compared to native vegetation, suggesting that LUC led to soil compaction and increased soil 

mechanical resistance to root growth (Figure 5). Conversion from native vegetation to pasture 

promoted more significant impacts on SRP, reaching maximum values of 2.51, 3.66 and 3.07 

MPa at Lat_17S, Lat_21S and Lat_23S, respectively.

with significant differences observed in the first 10 cm at Lat_17S and in whole profile at

Lat_17S. Small differences were observed in soil moisture at Lat_21S and Lat_23S sites, 

although the differences were significant (p&lt;0.05) in some layers (Figure 5). 

 

4.3.6 Soil Stability Structural Index (SSI) 

 

Overall native vegetation and pasture had higher SSI values (i.e., better soil structural 

stability) than sugarcane, mainly for the 0-10 cm layer (Figure 6). A decreasing trend on SSI 

values in depth was observed. Conversion from native vegetation to pasture induced site-

specific changes on SSI. The SSI was significantly increased at Lat_17S ( ? SSI from 7.9 to 

5.8%) and significantly decreased at Lat_21S ( ? SSI from 11.3 to 7.3%), and within deeper 

layers (10-20 and 20-30 cm) at Lat_23S ( ? SSI from 7.2 to 6.3%). Conversion from pasture to 

sugarcane consistently promoted significant decreases in SSI, with average SSI values for 

sugarcane soils of 4.3, 7.1 and 4.1% at Lat_17S, Lat_21S and Lat_23S, respectively.

4.3.7 Correlation between soil physical properties and SOC 

 

Significant correlation was observed for 72 (p&lt;0.01) and 76 (p&lt;0.05) of 91 pairs 

(combinations) of soil physical properties from LUC sites in central-southern Brazil (Table 2).

The highest correlation was observed between BD and TP (-0.99). The SWSC and 

SAC indexes were better correlated (&gt;0.80) with WFPS, MaP and MiP. For Kfs there was 

high positive correlation with MaP (0.68) and negative correlation with SRP (-0.62). VESS 

scores were correlated with most physical properties, highlighting greater positive and 

negative correlations with SRP (0.68) and MaP (-0.63). There was good correlation (0.50) 

between MWD and SSI.  

Except for SRP and VESS scores, soil physical properties were strongly correlated 

with SOC, which was highest in soils with more clay. Overall, increased SOC resulted in a 

reduction in BD, SAC, SDC and Kfs and an increase in TP, MiP, MaP, WFPS, SWSC, MWD 

and SSI.  

 

4.3.8 Soil physical quality assessement 

 

Minimum dataset indicator scores for the two scenarios analyzed are shown in Figure 

7. Conversion from native vegetation to pasture promoted severe reductions in Kfs and MaP 

scores and moderate reductions in VESS, BD and SSI scores. In contrast, pasture soils had the 

highest SAC, SWSC and MWD scores. For scenario I (Figure 7A), which did not include the 

sugarcane field that was being replanted, there was a major decrease in indicator scores, while 

for scenario II (Figure 7B) which included all sugarcane fields, tillage associated with 

replanting in one of three fields resulted in a marked increase in the Kfs score. Furthermore, 

small improvements in MaP, SAC and VESS scores were also verified. On the other hand, 

tillage reduced MWD and SSI scores. 

The overall scores for each soil physical function and SPQI are presented in Table 3. 

For f(i) related to supporting root growth, a significant reduction in scores was observed in the 

sequence native vegetation &gt; pasture &gt; sugarcane. Under pasture this function decreased 24% 

(0.76) compared to maximum performance (1.00) under native vegetation. Tillage operations 

carried out during sugarcane replanting promoted significant improvement in f(i), increasing 

the score from 0.68 to 0.72 score, although, this was not enough to offset impacts of 

conversion from pasture to sugarcane. For f(ii) related to water supply for plants and edaphic 

fauna, conversion from native vegetation to pasture and then to sugarcane without tillage 

(SCwr) decreased scores markedly (from 0.84 to 0.55 and 0.43). However, the tillage 

operation in sugarcane increased water entry into the soil and resulted in scores (0.83) similar 

to those found in native vegetation. The f(iii) related to soil aeration was affected similarly to 

f(i), in which the scores decreased in the sequence native vegetation &gt; pasture &gt; sugarcane. 



 99 

Tillage improved soil aeration compared to sugarcane without tillage (SCwr) as indicated by 

scores of 0.44 and 0.59. For f(iv) related to ability for resist against erosion and soil 

degradation, the results point out that under native vegetation and pasture there was no 

difference (0.93 and 0.94). On the other hand, within sugarcane fields, lower scores were 

found (0.59 in sugarcane and 0.68 in sugarcane without tillage). Beyond that, the f(iv) scores 

indicated that the sugarcane field being replanted, had a poor ability to resist erosion and 

subsequent degradation.  

 

 

Figure 7 - Overall scores of the soil minimum dataset indicators for the 0-30 cm layer in the 

land-use change areas in central-southern Brazil, where A) scenario I: native 

vegetation (NV), pasture (PA) and sugarcane without replanting tillage (SCwr) 

when sampled; and B) scenario II: NV, PA and sugarcane including a field with 

replanting tillage (SC) 
 

 

Overall, the additive SPQI was effective in classifying land uses according to the 

hypothesized potential of soil degradation in response to land-use intensification (Table 3). 

Therefore, conversion from native vegetation to pasture and then to sugarcane led to a 

reduction of SPQI. Finally, the SPQI was sensitive enough to identify that soil tillage 

operations had been carried out in the replanted sugarcane field, thus confirming its general 

ability to improve a soil’s capacity to perform its physical functions, even though it had short-

term effects.

4.4 Discussion 

 

4.4.1 Impacts of the LUC from native vegetation to pasture on soil physical attributes  

 

Long-term conversion (&gt;30 years) from native vegetation to extensive pasture led to 

significant soil compaction (Figure 1). Sampled pastures had BD values that were &gt;1.2 Mg m
-

3
 in clay soils and &gt;1.6 Mg m

-3
 in sandy soils, suggesting a limiting condition for optimum 

plant growth on tropical soils (REICHERT; REINERT; BRAIDA, 2003; REICHERT et al. 

2009). The SDC provides a more robust evaluation of soil compaction, because optimum BD 

and porosity values for crop growth vary considerably among soils (i.e., BD is strongly 

dependent on mineral composition and SOC). Optimal SDC had been associated with values 

between 80 and 90% (REICHERT et al., 2009). Our results suggest that soil compaction was 

close to the upper limit and even limiting grass growth, especially in high clay soils at 

Lat_23S, where the SDC averaged 96% for the 0-30 cm layer. Soil compaction in pastures is 

primarily caused by SOC depletion and cattle trampling. Recently, Franco et al. (2015) 

verified that SOC losses, induced by conversion of native vegetation to pasture, resulted in an 

average C emission rate of 0.4 Mg ha
-1

 yr
-1

 in these sampled sites. Several studies have 

reported the crucial role that SOM plays with regard to resisting structural degradation in 

pastures (e.g., FONTE at al., 2014; NESPER et al., 2015). Low C inputs also have adverse 

implications on nutrient cycling and biological activity, further decreasing pasture 

productivity and increasing soil degradation. In addition, compressive forces due to 

continuous cattle trampling can induce soil compaction that has negative effects on soil 



 101 

physical quality and plant growth in pastures (GREENWOOD; McKENZIE, 2001; 

PIETOLA; HORN; YLI-HALLA, 2005; HERBIN et al., 2011; COSTA et al., 2012). 

In this study, increased soil compaction reduced soil aeration and resulted in strong 

negative correlations between BD, SDC, and soil aeration properties (Table 2). Macroporosity 

and the SAC index were severely affected by conversion from native vegetation to pasture, 

with MaP values (Figure 2) falling below the critical limit of 10% (XU; NIEBER; GUPTA, 

1992) and SAC values falling below 0.33 (Figure 3), which has been suggested as an ideal 

ratio for good soil aeration. These results are consistent with several other studies (e.g., 

HERBIN et al., 2011; RESENDE et al., 2012). In contrast, average values for MiP, WFPS 

and SWSC in pasture soils were higher than for native vegetation soils (Figures 2 and 3). 

Within the most compacted soils (Lat_23S), WFPS values exceeded 0.7 indicating excess 

water and reduced soil aeration, which can induce denitrification (WIENHOLD et al., 2009). 

Furthermore, the SWSC reached 0.92 which is much higher than the 0.66 value that is 

considered ideal for good balance between air and water content in the soil (REYNOLDS et 

al., 2002; 2009). Although the pasture soils have greater SWSC than native vegetation soils, it 

does not mean that this water is easily accessible to roots. Soil compaction decreases the size 

and continuity of pores increasing water retention at lower soil water potentials and 

decreasing overall soil water availability. 

Surface soil compaction also leads to reduced Kfs (REICHERT et al., 2009; HUNKE 

et al., 2015b). Our results showed Kfs reductions ranging from 76 to 98% in pasture soil 

compared to native vegetation (Figure 4). These cause and effect relationships were 

confirmed by inverse correlations between Kfs versus BD and SDC and positive correlations 

between Kfs versus TP and MaP (Table 2); a response similar to that found by Reichert et al. 

(2009). Several studies showing reduction in water infiltration and Kfs from LUC effects in 

Brazilian Cerrado were compiled by Hunke et al. (2015a). In recent field-study Hunke et al. 

(2015b) found that conversion from native vegetation to pasture significantly reduced 

infiltration rates (-96%) and Kfs (-92%), indicating high susceptibility to surface erosion and 

an increased potential for lateral nutrient transport to the surface waters, as reported by 

Gucker, Boechat and Giani (2009). Reductions of Kfs were also consistently documented from 

trampling effects on grazing pasture (e.g., GREENWOOD; McKENZIE, 2001) even under 

low-intensity grazing (PIETOLA; HORN; YLI-HALLA, 2005). Higher soil mechanical 

resistance to root growth in pasture (Figure 5) is a key-factor limiting water access to the 

plants. We found SRP values &gt;2 MPa (suggested as a critical limit to root growth) in all 

pasture sites. Geissen et al. (2009) concluded that permanent pasture in Mexico led to higher 



 102 

SRP and soil compaction. Costa et al. (2012) also found that an increased SRP associated with 

high-intensity grazing promoted lower root growth of Panicum maximum.  

 

4.4.2 Impacts of the LUC from pasture to sugarcane on soil physical attributes  

 

Conversion from long-term extensive pasture to sugarcane induced slight soil physical 

degradation. Sugarcane cultivation resulted in SOC losses (FRANCO et al., 2015) and relies 

on heavy mechanization (SOUZA et al., 2014; 2015), but significant differences in soil 

compaction (Figures 1 and 5), as evidenced by porosity (Figure 2), SAC and SWSC (Figure 

3) and Kfs (Figure 4), were not observed when compared to pasture areas. Other studies also 

found no differences in BD and TP (RESENDE et al., 2012) or Kfs (HUNKE et al., 2015b) 

between long-term extensive pasture and sugarcane fields in Brazilian Cerrado, even though, 

both land uses had lower soil physical quality than areas with native vegetation.  

Although soil physical degradation due to conversion from pasture to sugarcane was 

less intense than from native vegetation to pasture, soil physical conditions under sugarcane 

may be limiting plant growth. Soil compaction indicators (BD and SDC) were higher than 

established critical limits and the SRP values were &gt;2 MPa, suggesting poor root growth 

(OTTO et al., 2011; SOUZA et al., 2014). Soil compaction in sugarcane fields due to 

intensive machine traffic is well documented in the literature (BRAUNACK; McGARRY, 

2006; BAQUEIRO et al., 2012; CASTRO et al., 2013; SOUZA et al., 2014; 2015). 

Compressive forces are applied to soil by tractors, trailers and harvesters, causing a reduction 

in pore space and an increase in soil strength. Consequently, soil aeration properties were 

significantly affected, as shown by MaP&amp;lt;10% and SAC&amp;lt;0.33, which suggests a 

discontinuity in pathways of air-filled pores for gas diffusion (XU; NIEBER; GUPTA, 1992). 

The WFPS values were close 0.6 (Lat_17S and Lat_21S) or &gt;0.7 (Lat_23S), indicating 

limiting soil aeration which can induce greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. 

Soils within the sampled sugarcane fields showed a high risk for degradation since SSI 

values were generally ?5%. Lower soil structural resilience results in decreases in 

macroaggregation and MWD, lower Kfs, and poor VESS scores, and it suggests that areas 

under sugarcane expansion are at increased risk for runoff and soil erosion, both which may 

have adverse effects on soil and water quality.  

Tillage performed during conversion of pasture to sugarcane and carried out during 

sugarcane replanting may be pointed out as the key-factor for alleviating soil compaction and 

maintaining soil physical conditions in a slightly better or similar condition in sugarcane 



 103 

fields as under pasture. The effects of soil tillage during sugarcane replanting were verified at 

Lat_17S, especially in the top layer (0-10 cm). Measurements showed a decrease in SDC 

(Figure 1) and SRP (Figure 5A) and an increase in MaP (Figure 2A), total porosity (Figure 

2G), SAC (Figure 3A) and Kfs (Figure 4A). Tillage operations promote soil disturbance, 

create large pores and consequently alleviate soil compaction, improving soil physical 

conditions for sugarcane root growth. Unfortunately, soil physical remediation was restricted 

to the top soil layer, indicating that these mechanical operations were not successful in 

restoring the entire soil profile. Understanding the real impact of tillage is important for 

farmers, because the operations are expensive (CHAMEN et al., 2015) and when inadequately 

carried out could have adverse consequences on sugarcane yield.  

Our findings also suggest that tillage performed for sugarcane replanting had a short-

term effect on soil physical properties. This agreed with study by Centurion et al. (2007) who 

verified better soil physical conditions just after tillage followed by progressive soil physical 

degradation from the first to fourth ratoon. Short-term tillage improvements in soil physical 

quality may be associated with the disruption of macroaggregates (SIX; ELLIOTT; 

PAUSTIAN, 2000; FRANCO, 2015) which also favors more intense SOC losses (SILVA-

OLAYA et al., 2013) and further structural degradation of the soil (Figure 6). This soil 

structural degradation is magnified by successive compaction events associated with 

machinery traffic, and leads to greater soil compaction throughout the sugarcane cycle 

(BRAUNACK; McGARRY, 2006; BAQUEIRO et al., 2012). 

 

4.4.3 Sugarcane expansion versus soil physical quality 

 

The minimum dataset used to assess soil physical quality (0-30 cm layer) was able to 

rank LUC effects according to soil physical degradation (Figure 7; Table 3). Overall, the 

highest index for soil physical functioning was verified for soils under native vegetation, 

suggesting that they were functioning at 90% of their potential capacity. The soil physical 

function scores showed that under native vegetation the soil has full capacity to support root 

growth, since higher C inputs combined with the absence of soil perturbation ensures 

structural arrangement providing good soil physical conditions for growth and deep 

penetration of roots. The large air-filled porosity observed under native vegetation provides 

adequate soil aeration, but the reduced soil water retention induces an unbalanced ratio 

between air and water in the soil. Therefore, scores of f(ii) and f(iii) were not maximum (0.84 

and 0.83) in these soils. Finally, higher SOM contents under native vegetation areas favor 



 104 

formation of large aggregates and provide greater soil structural stability. Those inherent 

characteristics also suggest that soils beneath native vegetation have the ability to resist 

erosion and physical degradation.  

Conversion from native vegetation to pasture promoted significant decreases in the 

soil’s capacity to perform its physical functions (SPQI = 0.73). The extensive low-input 

management commonly used in pastures for more than 30 years led to soil compaction and 

reduced the soil’s capacity to support of root growth - f(i), to supply water for plants and 

edaphic fauna - f(ii) and to allow gases exchange between soil and atmosphere - f (iii) 

compared to native vegetation soils. Despite that, based on our minimum dataset, we verified 

that pasture soils had high capacity to resist erosion and physical degradation. These results 

may be linked to greater macrofauna activity in pasture areas as suggested by Lavelle et al. 

(2014) and the aggressive root system of Poaceae (i.e., Brachiaria and Cynodon) which plays 

crucial role in soil aggregation and improvement of soil structural quality, especially in the 

top few centimeters (FONTE et al., 2014). 

Sugarcane expansion into long-term extensive pasture land led to slightly negative 

changes in soil physical quality over time. Our findings showed that management practices 

adopted in sugarcane fields result in more dynamic changes in soil physical properties. This 

was illustrated by the one sugarcane field where recent tillage operations resulted in an overall 

soil capacity to perform physical functions of 68%, which was close to that observed in 

pasture (73%). Mechanical tillage alleviated soil compaction resulting in better aeration, water 

availability and favorable conditions for root growth. However, intensive sugarcane 

management using big and heavy machines promotes soil compaction over time. Our results 

indicated that soils in the fourth and fifth ratoon of sugarcane are functioning at only 56% of 

their potential. The measurements also suggest that sugarcane expansion into degraded 

pastures should follow management strategies that minimize soil physical degradation to 

ensure long-term economic and environmental sustainability for this production system. 

Our findings confirmed an increasing risk for soil loss and degradation due to erosion 

in sugarcane fields that is aggravated by tillage operations during the sugarcane replanting. 

Soil perturbation increases structural degradation and SOC losses, decreasing the soil’s 

capacity to resist erosion. In addition, after tillage operations, uncovered soil remains for 

weeks or months, creating increased water and wind erosion risks. Throughout the sugarcane 

production cycle, the main driver to soil erosion is compaction, which has deleterious effects 

on soil structure and water infiltration. Soil erosion is reported as one of major threats to 

sustainability of Brazilian sugarcane production system (MARTINELLI; FILOSO, 2007). In 



 105 

the state of São Paulo, which is the core of the ethanol industry in Brazil, estimated rates of 

soil erosion in sugarcane fields are close to 60 Mg ha
-1

 yr
-1

 while in forests and pasture 

erosion rates do not exceed 2 Mg ha
-1

 yr
-1

 (WEILL; SPAROVEK, 2008). Thus, future 

research needs to evaluate the degree of soil erosion and associated soil and water resource 

degradation due to LUC in Brazilian sugarcane belt. 

Based on our results, we emphasize the urgent need to adopt strategies to mitigate 

adverse effects of current sugarcane management practices on soil physical quality, 

minimizing the environmental impact of biofuel production. The season for sugarcane 

replanting, which extends from September to March, coincides with the highest rainfall period 

in central-southern Brazil. Therefore, a crop rotation plan including commercial crops [e.g., 

corn (Zea mays) or soybean (Glycine max)] or cover crops (e.g. Crotalaria juncea or Mucuna 

aterrima) could be implemented to prevent soil degradation by erosion, improve C allocation 

throughout the soil profile, N-fixation and nutrient cycling, break pest cycles and alleviate soil 

compaction. Machinery entry on the field, especially during harvest operations should be 

done under soil moisture conditions less favorable to compaction. Mathematical models that 

include soil and agricultural machinery characteristics should be developed as an auxiliary 

management guide to predict the impact of the entry of machines on soil physical quality (for 

example, see KELLER et al., 2015). In addition, more investments and research are necessary 

for developing machines adapted for implementing controlled traffic in sugarcane production 

system and for studying sugarcane planting strategies with different inter-row spacing, 

keeping non-trafficked zones between crop rows, as well as specific tillage zones, as 

discussed by Bangita and Rao (2012). 

Finally, we suggest that soil physical quality changes should be evaluated and 

monitored throughout the sugarcane life cycle using indicators selected to calculate an overall 

SPQI, such as BD, VESS, MaP, SAC, Kfs, SWSC, MWD and SSI. If sufficient resources 

(time and money) are not available for a detailed soil assessment including all of these 

indicators, we suggest using the VESS, which is an on-farm, inexpensive, simple to perform 

and easy to understand approach for evaluating soil physical quality. VESS scores are well-

correlated with soil physical properties, and thus provide a first approximation of overall soil 

structure quality that can help farmers and land managers evaluate the impact of various 

management practices on sugarcane production.

4.5 Conclusions 

 

We investigated soil physical quality impacts of LUC associated with sugarcane 

expansion across the primary sugarcane-producing region in Brazil. Our hypotheses were 

confirmed. Conversion from native vegetation to long-term, extensive pasture increased soil 

compaction (i.e., higher values of BD, SDC and SRP), decreased aeration porosity and water 

hydraulic conductivity, and consequently, created an unbalanced ratio between water- and air-

filled pore space in the soil. Based on our SPQI the native vegetation and pasture soils are 

functioning at 90 and 73% of their potential capacity, respectively.  

 The LUC from pasture to sugarcane induced slight soil physical quality degradation 

and resulted in soils functioning at between 56 and 68% of their capacity. Overall, sugarcane 

fields have critical soil compaction (BD and SDC) that is decreasing soil pore space (TP), soil 

aeration (MaP and SAC) and Kfs and increasing soil strength (SRP) and the risk for soil 

erosion and structural degradation. Tillage operations performed approximately every five 

years when sugarcane is replanted have some short-term positive effects on soil physical 

quality; although overall it reduces the soil’s ability to resist degradation due to erosive 

processes. Therefore, sugarcane expansion in Brazil should require the adoption and 

monitoring of management strategies that increase SOM and minimize soil compaction to 

reduce soil physical quality degradation and thus improve sustainability of sugarcane 

production in Brazil.

5 ASSESSING SOIL STRUCTURAL QUALITY UNDER BRAZILIAN SUGARCANE 

EXPANSION AREAS USING VISUAL EVALUATION OF SOIL STRUCTURE 

(VESS)  

 

 

Abstract 

 

Increasing global demand for biofuel has accelerated land-use change (LUC) in Brazil, 

primarily through the planting of sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) to replace degraded 

pastures. The intensive mechanization associated with this LUC under tropical soils in Brazil 

has increased concerns regarding structural quality. Through decades of research focused on 

identifying sensitive indicators of soil degradation due to land use and management, the 

Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure (VESS) method has emerged as a simple, fast, reliable and 

accurate semi-quantitative approach for assessing soil structure changes. VESS integrates soil 

properties related to size, strength and porosity of aggregates, and root characteristics into a 

single score (Sq - structural quality) that ranges from 1 (good structural quality) to 5 (poor 

structural quality). Although the VESS method was developed for temperate soils, it has been 

used successfully as an indicator of soil and crop management practice effects on structural 

quality of tropical and subtropical soils. Our objectives were to evaluate soil structural quality 

changes associated with a LUC sequence (i.e., native vegetation to pasture to sugarcane) at 

three sites under Oxisols, Alfisols and Ultisols across central-southern Brazil using the VESS; 

and to correlate VESS scores with quantitative measurements of soil physical properties. 

Average VESS scores were 2.0, 2.7, and 3.1 for native vegetation, pasture, and sugarcane, 

respectively. Overall the VESS method was able to detect soil structural quality changes 

under LUC for sugarcane cultivation, indicating a decrease in soil quality from native 

vegetation through pasture to sugarcane. The VESS scores were significantly correlated with 

quantitative soil physical property measurements, suggesting VESS is a reliable indicator of 

soil structural quality in tropical soils. A VESS critical score (Sq= 3.0) seems to be suitable as 

a guide for management decisions. We conclude that VESS scores provide an efficient 

method to identify impacts of sugarcane expansion on soil structural quality, and recommend 

that VESS assessment be incorporated into monitoring protocols for evaluating not only 

sugarcane expansion areas, but also overall soil quality/health in Brazil.

5.1 Introduction 

 

The large-scale cultivation of biofuel crops for bioenergy has caused widespread 

transformations in land use worldwide, either directly or through the replacement of other 

managed lands with food crops (FOLEY et al., 2005). Brazil, the world’s largest producer of 

sugarcane ethanol [29.2 billion of liters per year (COMPANHIA NACIONAL DE 

ABASTECIMENTO, 2016)], is one of principal hotspots of these land-use changes 

(LAPOLA et al., 2014). In the last decade (2005-2015), the sugarcane area has increased from 



 114 

5.8 to 9.0 Mha, with most of area being concentrated within the central-southern region 

(COMPANHIA NACIONAL DE ABASTECIMENTO, 2016). Nevertheless, in order to meet 

the projected domestic Brazilian supplies for ethanol by 2021, an additional 6.4 Mha of 

sugarcane will be required (GOLDEMBERG et al., 2014). Historically, in central-southern 

Brazil the expansion of agriculture has been done through the removal of native vegetation 

and the introduction of pasture, but often using poor management practices (LAPOLA et al., 

2014), which has resulted in vast areas of low-productivity pasture (STRASSBURG et al., 

2014) and poor soil quality (CHERUBIN et al., 2015; FRANCO et al., 2015). Therefore, 

conversion of extensive pasturelands to sugarcane is the most opportune and widespread land-

use change to meet projected ethanol demands, thus avoiding direct competition for land with 

food crops and natural ecosystems (GOLDEMBERG et al., 2014; STRASSBURG et al., 

2014).   

Conversion of pastureland to sugarcane production requires intensive mechanization 

through large and heavy agricultural machines that impose unavoidable modifications to soil 

structure and to soil physical properties. Recent studies have shown that the LUC from 

pasture to sugarcane depletes soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks (MELLO et al., 2014; 

FRANCO et al., 2015) and increases soil susceptibility to compaction due to heavy and 

intense traffic during mechanical harvest and transport (BRAUNACK; McGARRY, 2006; 

LOZANO et al., 2013; SOUZA et al., 2014). Therefore, soil compaction has been identified 

as the main concern in modern sugarcane production systems in Brazil (LOZANO et al., 

2013; SOUZA et al., 2014) and has been characterized by increases in bulk density, leading to 

a reduction in macroporosity and water infiltration (BRAUNACK; McGARRY, 2006; 

CASTRO et al., 2013; SOUZA et al., 2014). Furthermore, these physically and structurally 

degraded soils decrease root growth and sugarcane yield (OTTO et al., 2011; BAQUERO et 

al., 2012; SOUZA et al., 2014). 

Impacts of sugarcane production on soil physical and structural quality have been 

traditionally assessed using quantitative soil physical properties such as bulk density, soil 

porosity, soil resistance to penetration, aggregate stability and macroaggregation that are 

indirectly related to soil structure (OTTO et al., 2011; LOZANO et al., 2013; SOUZA et al., 

2014). However, measurements of these soil properties are relatively time consuming and 

expensive to analyze, and each sample provides an indication of the structural condition only 

at the point where it was taken within the soil profile (NEWELL-PRICE et al., 2013). 

Alternatively, visual methods of assessment of soil structure are characterized as simple, 

inexpensive, reliable and accurate, easy to perform, capable of producing results quickly and 



 115 

being easily understood by researchers, advisers and farmers (BALL et al., 2007; 

GUIMARÃES et al., 2011; ASKARI; CUI; HOLDEN, 2013; GIAROLA et al., 2013; 

MONCADA et al., 2014). To make the assessment of soil physical quality simpler, spade 

methods based on the assessment of topsoil (first 25 cm) have been widely developed. This 

includes the “Visual Soil Assessment” (VSA) method developed by Shepherd (2009) and the 

‘‘Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure’’ (VESS) method described by Ball, Batey and 

Munkholm (2007) and improved by Guimarães, Ball and Tormena (2011).  

 The VESS method was developed from the Peerlkamp method (BALL; BATEY;  

MUNKHOLM, 2007) and has been recognized as one of the simplest methods to employ 

while still including a variety of soil structure and rooting assessments (GUIMARÃES et al., 

2013) in a way that Ball, Munkholm and Batey (2013) concluded can evaluate more than soil 

structural quality. The VESS method involves taking an undisturbed soil sample, breaking it 

up and visually assessing the size, shape, porosity and strength of aggregates, presence and 

state of roots and soil color (BALL; BATEY;  MUNKHOLM, 2007; GUIMARÃES; BALL; 

TORMENA, 2011). These soil characteristics are integrated into a single numeric score (Sq - 

structural quality) that ranges from 1 (good structural quality) to 5 (poor structural quality) 

that can subsequently be submitted to statistical analysis for decision making (MUNKHOLM; 

HECK; DEEN, 2013). Another distinctive feature of VESS is its ability to distinguish 

between topsoil layers width different structural characteristics. It is important, because 

evaluating soil layers individually rather than giving only a weighted average score enables to 

improve the choice of management practices adopted to preserve or improve overall structural 

soil quality (GIAROLA et al., 2010; GUIMARÃES; BALL; TORMENA, 2011; 

GUIMARÃES et al., 2013). 

In recent years, VESS has been used to evaluate soil structure and soil quality under 

different land use and soil management (e.g., IMHOFF et al., 2009; GIAROLA et al., 2010; 

2013; ASKARI et al., 2013; GUIMARÃES et al., 2013; MUELLER et al., 2013; 

MUNKHOLM; HECK; DEEN, 2013; CUI; ASKARI; HOLDEN, 2014; MONCADA et al., 

2014; ABDOLLAHI et al., 2015). However, we are not aware of any studies using VESS for 

evaluating soil structure changes induced by sugarcane expansion in Brazilian tropical soils. 

Therefore, our objective was to apply the VESS method for assessing soil structural quality 

changes associated with a LUC sequence (i.e., native vegetation to pasture to sugarcane) at 

three field-sites across central-southern Brazil. We tested the hypotheses that i) the VESS 

method is able to efficiently detect soil structure changes induced by LUC and is a suitable 

indicator of soil quality in areas under sugarcane expansion in Brazil; ii) VESS Sq score is 



 116 

negatively affected by LUC from native vegetation to pasture to sugarcane and, iii) VESS Sq 

score is correlated with quantitative soil physical properties.  

 

5.2 Material and Methods 

 

5.2.1 Study sites and experimental design  

 

The study sites and experimental design were described in the 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 items. 

 

5.2.2 Sampling and VESS measurements 

 

Soil sampling was carried out in January 2014. At each land-use site were collected 

four samples (i.e., totaling 36 soil samples). Sampling points were positioned in representative 

locations within each land use sampled. In native vegetation areas we avoided sampling close 

to ant or termite nests, burrows of wild animals and big trees. In pasture areas, which were 

continuously and uniformly grazed, our major caution was to avoid sampling on the 

preferential cattle trampling paths, where the soil is much more compacted. Except at Lat_17S 

where the soil had been recently tilled for sugarcane replanting, all sampling points in 

sugarcane fields were located within the inter-row position, which is homogeneously tracked 

during harvest operations. 

The VESS assessment and signature of scores were completed as described by 

Guimarães, Ball and Tormena (2011). At each sampling core, a mini-trench (30 x 30 x 30 cm 

in size) was dug out and then, using a spade, an undisturbed sample (20 x 10 x 25 cm deep – 

5000 cm
3
 volume) was collected and transferred to a plastic tray. The soil evaluation included 

manual breakdown of soil aggregates along its fracture lines, identification of layers of 

contrasting structure, measurement of layer depth and assignment of a score by comparing the 

structure of the sample with the VESS chart, which contains descriptions and pictures of each 

proposed soil structure quality. The parameters used to describe soil structure included size, 

visible porosity, color, shape and strength of aggregates as well as the presence, number and 

distribution of roots (GUIMARÃES; BALL; TORMENA, 2011).  

Since distinct layers were identified and a score was assigned for each layer identified 

according to the standard chart description, a final weighted score for each soil sample was 

calculated using equation 1.

where, VESSSq is the overall VESS score, Sqi and Di are respectively the score and depth of 

each identified soil layer, and TD is the total depth of soil sample.   

 

Two additional strategies of scoring were also used: first, a weighted average of the Sq 

score was taken for the top (0-10 cm) and bottom (10-25 cm) soil layers at each site, and 

second, an overall Sq was taken using the depth and Sq scores of the naturally formed first 

and second soil layers. 

The interpretation of VESS scores was conducted according to Ball, Batey and 

Munkholm (2007), which is based on requirements to change management practices to 

preserve soil structural quality: Sq=1 and Sq=2, good soil structural quality, requiring no 

changes in management practices; Sq=3, adequate soil structural quality; however there is 

need for improved soil management to avoid a further decline in soil quality. Therefore, Sq=3 

is suggested as a critical limit to suitable crop production; Sq=4 and Sq=5, indicate poor soil 

structural quality, requiring urgent remedial management practices.  

 

5.2.3 Relationship among VESS scores and quantitative soil physical properties 

 

VESS is not a soil physical property but rather, it is a semi-quantitative measurement 

of soil structure. Thus, the VESS Sq score should be related to quantitative soil physical 

properties routinely used for studying soil structure in the laboratory and the field. At the 

same sampling time of the VESS assessments, soil resistance to penetration (SRP) 

measurements were taken and undisturbed soil samples (100 cm
3
) were collected. In the 

laboratory the following soil physical properties were determined: bulk density (BD) 

calculated by the ratio between soil dry mass and core volume; macroporosity (MaP) was 

computed as the difference between soil water content at saturation and soil water content at -

6 kPa soil water potential; soil water storage capacity (SWSC) index, obtained as the ratio 

between water content at field capacity (-10 kPa soil water potential) and total porosity. These 

soil physical properties were used only for establishing functional relationships with VESS Sq 



 118 

scores. A detailed description of the methods used in these measurements were provided by 

Cherubin et al. (2016)
3
. 

 

5.2.4 Data analyses 

 

The raw data were submitted to descriptive analysis and their normality was tested 

using a Shapiro-Wilk’s test (p&gt;0.05) through the Statistical Analysis System – SAS v.9.3 

(SAS Inc., Cary, USA) software. Average values were compared using the confidence 

interval (p&lt;0.05) according to Gabriel (1978). To test local effects of LUC, average VESS 

scores were compared within each site and to test overall LUC effects (regional scale) the 

average VESS scores of three sites were compared together. Linear regressions were 

performed using PROC REG procedure in SAS to verify the relationship among VESS scores 

and quantitative soil physical properties.  

 

5.3 Results and Discussion 

 

5.3.1 VESS sensitivity to detect LUC effects on soil structural quality 

 

The VESS method was capable of assessing soil structural quality changes under a 

wide textural range (15-66% clay content) in the Brazilian tropical soils studied. The VESS 

assessment took about 20 to 25 minutes from digging out the mini-trench to assigning the 

final score. It was more difficult to extract and breakdown samples from sugarcane soils 

indicating signs of soil compaction and damaged soil structure. It is also important to collect 

samples when soil moisture is close to field capacity, in order to minimize the physical effort 

associated with digging the mini-trench, extracting, and manipulating the samples as 

previously reported by Imhoff et al. (2009), Giarola et al. (2013) and Moncada et al. (2014). 

The step-by-step recommendations, pictures and criteria for Sq score differentiation available 

on the VESS chart properly enabled the identification of soil layers with different soil 

structural conditions. The shape of aggregate (approx. 1.5 cm diameter) was an important 

criterion for distinguishing between two scores when visual differentiation was not clear, 

especially for Sq scores between 3 and 4. We stress that user knowledge and experience are 

very important for assigning the Sq scores accurately. The visual evaluations were performed

by the same person in order to avoid potential Sq variability induced by different operators. 

Despite these limitations, several studies have shown that VESS scores have good 

reproducibility and that assessments can be accurately made by different, trained operators 

(BALL; BATEY;  MUNKHOLM, 2007; CUI; ASKARI; HOLDEN, 2014).  

The overall VESS scores ranged from 1.3 (native vegetation) and 4.0 (sugarcane), 

indicating a variation from good to poor soil structural quality among land uses (Table 1). 

Mean and median values had small differences and coefficient of variation values were below 

25%. The normality of data was confirmed by Shapiro-Wilk’s test (p&gt;0.05).

The VESS method was sensitive to local and regional soil structure changes induced 

by LUC for sugarcane production (Figures 1 and 2). Overall, conversion from native 

vegetation to pasture and then to sugarcane decreased soil structural quality for all soil layers 

(Figure 1). When the three sites were analyzed together (regional scale), overall VESS Sq 

scores significantly increased from Sq= 2.0 in native vegetation to Sq= 2.7 in pasture and then 

to Sq= 3.1 in sugarcane fields (Figure 2). We also identified a significant increase in scores 

from the top layer (0-10 cm depth) to the bottom layer (10-25 cm depth) for both local (Figure 

1) and regional scale (Figure 2), indicating an increasing level of degradation in deeper layers. 

Guimarães et al. (2013) reasoned that assigning scores to individual layers provides 



 120 

information that is more detailed and, therefore, allows more accurate management decision 

making than when only using a weighted average as described by Ball, Batey and Munkholm 

(2007). Using this approach, users can identify specific layers for sampling in case additional 

samples for quantitative analysis of soil quality indicators are desired (GUIMARÃES et al., 

2013).  

Considering the critical VESS score Sq= 3.0, as suggested by Ball, Batey and 

Munkholm (2007), it was verified that native vegetation soils, regardless of soil layer, have 

greater structural quality (Sq&amp;lt;3.0), supporting a suitable environment for root system growth 

and the exploitation of deeper soil layers. For pasture and sugarcane soils, poorer structural 

quality (Sq &gt;3.0) was identified, mainly in the bottom layer (10-25 cm) at Lat_21S and 

Lat_23S, suggesting that management practice changes are needed to alleviate soil 

compaction. Our regional scale VESS assessment showed an overall score (Sq = 3.1) that was 

very close to the critical limit (Sq= 3.0) but it was even worse (i.e., Sq= 3.5) when the 

Lat_17S site was not considered because it had been tilled for sugarcane replanting just before 

the time of sampling. These results confirm that current soil and crop management practices 

being used for sugarcane production are fostering a dangerous decline in soil structural quality 

and its consequent deleterious effects on sugarcane growth, development, and productivity. 

These results are supported by several other studies that show that current management 

practices can lead to soil compaction, which negatively affects sugarcane root system 

development and consequently, reduced yields (BRAUNACK; McGARRY, 2006; OTTO et 

al., 2011; BAQUERO et al., 2012; SOUZA et al., 2014).

The depth of the top and bottom layers and their respective Sq scores are shown in 

Figure 3. The top layer depths were greater under native vegetation than in pasture or 

sugarcane and the VESS scores followed this order. Greater depth and higher Sq scores were 

observed in the bottom layer of sugarcane fields. A thicker bottom layer with lower soil 

structural quality suggests a strong limitation for sustainable yields using current sugarcane 

production practices. The differences in both depth and VESS scores induced by LUC can be 

clearly seen in Figure 4.

Figure 3 - Depth of distinct layers and VESS scores (inside of the bars) at Lat_17S (A), 

Lat_21S (B), Lat_23S (C) and regional scale (D) 

 

Overall, native vegetation soils had a top layer that was 35% or 50% deeper than in 

pasture or sugarcane soils, respectively (Figure 3D). The greater inputs of soil organic matter 

(SOM) and higher biological activity associated with absence of soil tillage and management 

are key factors for maintaining a deeper layer ( ? 10.4 cm) of better soil structural quality ( ? 

Sq= 1.2) under native vegetation (Figure 4). Recently, Franco et al. (2015) verified that native 

vegetation had higher SOC stocks (0-30 cm layer) compared to pasture (average -26%) and 

sugarcane (average -36%) soils at these same sampling sites. In addition, field observations 

during VESS assessments indicated a high presence of earthworm burrows and evenness of 

root distribution in native vegetation soils. Organic carbon inputs associated with soil biota 

and root activity act as cementing agents throughout the soil aggregation process, gradually 

resulting in the formation of organic-mineral complexes (primary particles) that slowly form 

micro- and then macroaggregates (TISDALL; OADES, 1982). Soil aggregates physically

protect some SOM fractions, resulting in carbon pools with longer turnover times. This 

increase in C turnover time enables the organization of more complex and stable soil structure 

under native vegetation areas (SIX et al., 1998). Furthermore, the absence of tillage avoids 

disruption of aggregates and exposure of occlude SOM, that can ultimately lead to SOM 

decomposition.  

 

 

 

 

Figure 4 - Illustration of the soil structural changes detected by VESS method due to effects of 

land-use change (e.g., native vegetation Sq = 1.5; pasture Sq = 2.5; sugarcane Sq = 

4.0) in central-southern Brazil 

 

Long-term conversion from native vegetation to extensive pasture induced soil 

structure alterations in the sampled soil profile. We found a thinner layer ( ? 6.8 cm) of good 

soil structural quality ( ? Sq= 1.2) only associated with the rhizosphere zone (Figure 4) 

overlying a compacted and deeper soil layer. The vigorous root systems of tropical grasses 

(e.g., the Brachiaria and Cynodon genera) can increase aggregate stability and improve soil 

structural quality (VEZZANI; MIELNICZUK, 2011; FONTE et al., 2012). Large root

systems promote high C inputs and act on the formation and stabilization of soil structure. 

Greater C stock in superficial soil layer was confirmed by Franco et al. (2015), who reported 

average SOC stock decreases of 6% from 0-10 to10-20 cm layer and 18% from 0-10 to 20-30 

cm layer in these pasture sites. Roots release a variety of exudates that have a cementing 

effect on soil particles and they can physically influence microaggregate formation via the 

compressing action of growing roots and in the entanglement of soil particles to form and 

stabilize macroaggregates (TISDALL; OADES, 1982; SIX et al., 2004; BRONICK; LAL, 

2005). Roots also increase wet-dry cycling of adjacent soil, alter the ionic and osmotic 

balance in the rhizosphere through nutrient uptake and rhizodeposition and host a large 

population of micro- and macroorganisms that contribute to SOC and soil aggregation 

(TISDALL; OADES, 1982; SIX et al., 2004; BRONICK; LAL, 2005). In contrast, continuous 

cattle trampling and inadequate pasture management are the major drivers for soil compaction 

in pasturelands (NEWELL-PRICE et al., 2013; CUI; ASKARI; HOLDEN, 2014). Soil 

compaction limits growth and depth penetration of roots, decreasing deeper allocation of SOC 

and its potential improvement on soil structural quality. It results in a deeper bottom soil layer 

( ? 18.2 cm) of poor structural quality ( ? Sq= 3.3).  

In sugarcane fields, a smaller soil surface layer depth ( ? 5.1 cm) with good structural 

quality ( ? Sq= 2.0) and consequently larger bottom layer depth ( ? 19.9 cm) of poor soil 

structural quality ( ? Sq= 3.6) can be associated with soil tillage operations performed during 

the establishment (land-use conversion) and replanting of sugarcane, SOC losses and 

intensive machinery traffic under favorable conditions for soil compaction. A thinner soil 

layer with good soil structural quality (lower Sq score) implies a reduced soil volume 

exploited by the sugarcane root system (OTTO et al., 2011; SOUZA et al., 2014). Under 

weather condition in central-southern Brazil, especially during dry periods, more fragile and 

superficial root systems induce chemical and physical stress to the plants that can lead to a 

decline in yield and the need for premature replanting operations. The soil tillage operations 

provide an intensive soil disturbance, inducing SOC losses to the atmosphere (SILVA-

OLAYA et al., 2013; MELLO et al., 2014). In addition, sugarcane reformation is very 

expensive and requires appropriate weather to be carried out in an agronomically successful 

manner. Therefore, soil structural degradation decreases both environmental and economic 

sustainability of sugarcane production. The thicker surface layer of good soil structure 

observed in sugarcane fields (Figures 3 and 4) may be related to the positive effects of 

maintaining sugarcane straw on the soil surface. These results are supported by Franco et al. 

(2015), who reported reduction of SOC in deeper layers in these same sugarcane sites. 



 126 

Dalchiavon et al. (2013) also verified that maintenance of sugarcane straw on the soil surface 

increases SOC stocks, decreases bulk density and soil resistance to penetration, and improves 

sugarcane yield.  

Despite the differences between soils and length of sugarcane cultivation, a 

comparison of sugarcane fields at the different study sites (Figure 5) indicated that VESS Sq 

scores increased from sugarcane replanting (Lat_17A) through initial growth (Lat_23S) to full 

growth (Lat_21S). Tillage operations conducted during planting or replanting (plowing and 

disking) promote soil disturbance and consequently alleviate soil compaction. Therefore, just 

after those operations VESS scores are lower, indicating better soil structural quality and 

adequate soil physical conditions for sugarcane growth. However, our data suggest that tillage 

performed for sugarcane replanting had a short-term effect on soil structure. Soil tillage 

operations promote disruption of macroaggregates favoring SOC losses (SIX et al., 1998; 

2004) and inducing an increase in soil compaction over time (CASTRO et al., 2013). Its 

deleterious effects are further magnified by successive machinery operations used during the 

sugarcane production season (LOZANO et al., 2013; SOUZA et al., 2014).

We emphasize that these results that show VESS score changes during the sugarcane 

cycle should be interpreted carefully, as our dataset was collected from different sites under 

distinct soil and weather conditions. Additional studies for evaluating impacts of sugarcane 

management on soil structure assessed by VESS should be carried out through the whole 

sugarcane cycle (about five years). Furthermore, subsoil compaction in sugarcane fields 

should also be evaluated using methodology such as SubVESS, proposed by Ball et al. 

(2015). We consider subsoil compaction an important concern since sugarcane roots have the 

potential to explore soil layers much deeper than 25 cm. Both VESS and SubVESS could be 

implemented at the same time for a complete evaluation of structural quality throughout the 

entire soil profile.  

The VESS scores (Sq &gt;3.0) found in this study suggest that important management 

changes are required to mitigate the negative effects of sugarcane cultivation on soil structure 

and improve its sustainability. Adoption of minimum tillage, harvesting without prior burning 

and maintaining straw on the soil surface could increase SOC and improve soil structure, 

making the soil more resistant to compressive machinery effects. Protocols that aim to have 

machinery enter fields under soil moisture that are less favorable to compaction in 

conjunction with controlled traffic strategies should also be encouraged to keep soil structure 

favorable for sustainable sugarcane production.  

 

5.3.2 VESS score as an integrative soil structural quality indicator 

 

Quantitative soil physical properties traditionally used to assess soil structure changes 

in sugarcane fields have been used for supporting management decisions. Since the VESS 

method integrates several soil physical properties into a single score, it is convenient that 

VESS scores are correlated with these quantitative parameters. Figure 6 shows that VESS Sq 

scores have a significant relationship with bulk density (r
2
 = 0.33 to 0.56), macroporosity (r

2
 = 

0.23 to 0.44), index of soil water storage capacity (r
2
 = 0.21 to 0.50), and soil resistance to 

penetration (r
2
 = 0.32 to 0.52), regardless of the inherent properties of the soil (e.g., soil 

texture, moisture and SOC).

VESS scores were significantly associated with increases in bulk density, which lead 

to decreases in macroporosity and increases in water retention (especially in lower water 

potentials), unbalancing the relationship between air and water in the soil, and finally, 

increasing the soil impedance to root growth. Overall, the critical VESS score (Sq= 3.0) used 

to guide management changes was satisfactorily convergent with critical values to: bulk 

density, 1.2, 1.4 to 1.6 Mg m
-3

 for clay, medium texture and sandy soils, respectively 

(REYNOLDS et al., 2002); macroporosity, 0.1 m

m
-3

 (XU; NIEBER; GUPTA, 1992); soil 

water storage capacity, 0.66 (REYNOLDS et al., 2002) and soil resistance to penetration, 2 

MPa (OTTO et al., 2011). VESS critical score (Sq= 3.0) proposed by Ball, Batey and 

Mulkholm (2007) for temperate soils seems appropriate as a guide for management decision 

in tropical soils.  

These results suggest that VESS is an accurate and reliable semi-quantitative method 

that integrates physical functions (e.g., water availability, aeration and root growth) related to 

structural and physical quality of soils. Thus, VESS could be used as an alternative or 

complementary tool for assessing sugarcane expansion impacts on soil structural quality in 

Brazilian tropical soils. These results are consistent with Guimarães et al. (2013), who showed 

that VESS and the Least Limiting Water Range (a complex indicator) have converged to 

identify soil physical conditions highly restrictive to plant growth when Sq &gt;3.5. In addition, 

quantitative soil physical properties have site-specific responses (Figure 6), which are highly 

influenced by inherent soil characteristics, and therefore, become one of the drawbacks of 

using one of these properties alone as an indicator of soil for structure or soil quality 

(NEWELL-PRICE et al., 2013). 

In addition to the ability of VESS to detect soil structure/physical changes, as reported 

in this study, Mueller et al. (2013) reported that visual methods for soil assessment are useful 

diagnostic tools for monitoring and controlling overall soil quality over different scales, 

ranging from within-field to global. Recent studies confirmed that VESS can be used to 

validate quantitative soil quality indexes that encompassed soil chemical, physical and 

biological properties (ASKARI; HOLDEN, 2014; 2015). Therefore, the VESS method should 

be suggested to sugarcane producers as a practical, easily-performed and accurate tool for 

monitoring soil quality degradation. This also helps to reduce cost and time when evaluating 

soil quality over large sugarcane areas, typical in central-southern Brazil. A future challenge 

is the automated collection of samples to quantify VESS. This is needed to broaden its use, 

especially in extensive areas cultivated with sugarcane in Brazil. Finally, development of 

protocols and training of technicians and consultants on the proper application of VESS are 



 130 

essential steps for its effective use in the assessment and monitoring of soil quality within 

sugarcane production systems.  

 

5.4 Conclusions 

 

The VESS method was efficiently sensitive for detecting soil structural quality 

changes, demonstrating its potential for direct on-farm assessment. VESS scores were 

significantly correlated with quantitative soil physical properties, and the VESS critical score 

(Sq= 3.0) is a reliable guide for management decisions in Brazilian tropical soil under 

sugarcane cultivation. Land-use conversions from native vegetation to pasture and then to 

sugarcane led to degradation of soil structural quality. Therefore, sugarcane expansion fields 

must be monitored to prevent soil physical limitations that can negatively affect growth and 

yield of sugarcane. We conclude that VESS scores provide an efficient method for identifying 

soil structural quality degradation induced by LUC, and recommend that VESS evaluations be 

incorporated into monitoring protocols for evaluating soil quality/health in areas of sugarcane 

expansion in Brazil.

6 A SOIL MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK (SMAF) EVALUATION 

OF BRAZILIAN SUGARCANE EXPANSION ON SOIL QUALITY 

 

 

Abstract 

 

The Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) was developed to evaluate 

impacts of land use and management practices on soil quality (SQ), but its suitability for 

Brazilian tropical soils was unknown. We hypothesized that SMAF would be sensitive 

enough to detect SQ changes associated to sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) expansion for 

ethanol production. Field studies were carried out at three sites across the central-southern 

region of Brazil, aiming to quantify impacts of a land-use change sequence (i.e., native 

vegetation – pasture – sugarcane) on SQ. Eight soil indicators were individually scored using 

SMAF curves developed primarily for North American soils and integrated into an overall 

Soil Quality Index (SQI) and in its chemical, physical and biological sectors. The SMAF 

scores were correlated with two other approaches used to assess SQ changes, soil organic 

carbon (SOC) stocks and Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure (VESS) scores. Our findings 

showed that the SMAF was an efficient tool for assessing land-use change effects on SQ of 

Brazilian tropical soils. The SMAF scoring curves developed using robust algorithms allowed 

proper assignment of scores for the soil chemical, physical and biological indicators assessed. 

The SQI scores were significantly correlated with SOC stocks and VESS scores. Long-term 

transition from native vegetation to extensive pasture promoted significant decreases in soil 

chemical, physical and biological indicators. Overall SQI suggested that native vegetation 

soils were functioning at 87% their potential capacity, while pasture soils were functioning at 

70%. Conversions of pasture to sugarcane induced slight improvements on SQ, primarily 

because of improved soil fertility. Sugarcane soils are functioning at 74% of their potential 

capacity. Based on this study, management strategies are suggested to improve SQ and the 

sustainability of sugarcane production in Brazil.

6.1 Introduction 

 

Soil quality/health (SQ) is a key factor required to achieve sustainable agricultural 

systems that will meet our increasing demands for food, feed, fiber and fuels. Therefore, in 

recent decades SQ has been discussed worldwide and become a major agenda item for the 

scientific community (KARLEN et al., 2008, KARLEN; PETERSON; WESTFALL, 2014). 

Soil quality was defined as the capacity of a specific kind of soil to function, within natural or 

managed ecosystem boundaries, to sustain plant and animal productivity, maintain or enhance 

water and air quality, and support human health and habitation (KARLEN et al., 1997). It is a 

product of inherent (e.g., parental material, climate, topography) and anthropogenic (e.g., 



 136 

tillage and cropping systems, land uses) interactions (KARLEN et al., 1997). Soil inherent 

attributes are governed by soil-forming processes, and are often relatively unresponsive to soil 

and crop management practices. On the other hand, dynamic soil properties (e.g., soil organic 

carbon, pH, soil aggregation, microbial biomass activity) are responsive to management 

practices and/or land use, but their change rates are dependent of the inherent soil attributes 

(KARLEN et al., 1997; 2008).  

Land-use change processes have transformed a large proportion of the planet’s land 

surface, affecting directly the capacity of soils to function (FOLEY et al., 2005). Increasing 

global demand for bioenergy feedstock production has intensified the land-use changes in 

many countries (FISCHER et al., 2010; WRIGHT; WIMBERLY, 2013; MUKHERJEE; 

SOVACOOL, 2014; GASPARATOS et al., 2015), and especially in Brazil (LAPOLA et al., 

2010; GODEMBERG et al., 2014; BORDONAL et al., 2015). Brazil is the world’s largest 

sugarcane producer (655 million tons) with about 40% of the global harvest (FOOD AND 

AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS, 2015). The sugarcane 

cropped area expanded from 5.8 to 9.0 Mha between 2005 and 2015 (COMPANHIA 

NACIONAL DE ABASTECIMENTO, 2015) and is projected to increase by 6.4 Mha to meet 

Brazilian domestic demand for ethanol by 2021 (GOLDEMBERG et al., 2014). Recent 

expansion has been concentrated in central-southern Brazil and 70% of the land-use change 

has occurred through conversion of extensive pasturelands (ADAMI et al., 2012). Sugarcane 

expansion initiatives have resulted in degraded pastures being subjected to intensive 

mechanization and inputs of agrochemicals (i.e., lime, fertilizer and pesticides) that have 

direct implications on SQ. Therefore, monitoring soil properties (indicators) altered by land-

use change is crucial for identifying strategies that minimize SQ degradation and its negative 

implications on ecosystem functioning (FU et al., 2015; ZORNOZA et al., 2015).  

To implement the concepts of SQ and its assessment, the Soil Management 

Assessment Framework (SMAF) was initially developed by researchers in the USA on North 

American soils (ANDREWS; KARLEN; CAMBARDELLA, 2004). The SMAF is a 

quantitative SQ evaluation method that emphasizes a dynamic view of SQ and involves 

detecting soil response to current or recent management decisions (ANDREWS; KARLEN; 

CAMBARDELLA, 2004; KARLEN et al., 2014). The SMAF uses a 3-step process to assess 

soil quality, including (i) indicator selection (chemical, physical and biological); (ii) indicator 

interpretation (non-linear scoring curves); and (iii) integration into an overall SQ index (SQI). 

Assessment values are generally expressed as a fraction or percentage of full performance for 

soil functions such as crop productivity, nutrient cycling, or environmental protection 



 137 

(ANDREWS; KARLEN; CAMBARDELLA, 2004; KARLEN et al., 2013). Currently, the 

SMAF has scoring curves or interpretation algorithms for 13 indicators, which encompass 

physical properties: bulk density (BD), macroaggregate stability (AGS), plant-available water 

and water-filled pore space (WFPS); chemical properties: potential of hydrogen (pH), 

electrical conductivity, sodium adsorption ratio, extractable phosphorus (P) and potassium 

(K); and biological properties: soil organic carbon (SOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), 

potentially mineralizable N, and ?-glucosidase (BG) activity (ANDREWS; KARLEN; 

CAMBARDELLA, 2004; WIENHOLD et al., 2009; STOTT et al., 2010). These scoring 

curves were developed and validated using datasets primarily from North America (USA, 

Canada, and Mexico), with the exception of WFPS (which included data from China), and BG 

(which included data from Brazil, Argentina and Italy), considering site-specific controlling 

factors (i.e., climate and/or inherent soil properties) that affect the score of each indicator 

(ANDREWS; KARLEN; CAMBARDELLA, 2004; WIENHOLD et al., 2009; STOTT et al., 

2010). 

The SMAF has been broadly used in the USA for assessing several situations and 

factors that affect both agricultural and natural systems at scales ranging from within-

experimental field (plots) to regional (e.g., ANDREWS; KARLEN; CAMBARDELLA, 2004; 

WIENHOLD et al., 2006; ZOBECK et al., 2014; STOTT et al., 2013; KARLEN et al., 2014; 

VEUM et al., 2015) evaluations. In addition, SMAF has been tested in other countries around 

world [e.g., South Africa (SWANEPOEL et al. 2015), Ethiopia (ERKOSSA; ITANNA; 

STAHR, 2007; GELAW; SINGH; LAL, 2015) and Nepal (KALU et al., 2015)]. Data from 

Brazilian soils was limited in the development and validation of the SMAF, and to our 

knowledge, no other studies using SMAF as tool for assessing the impacts of current 

management practices and land uses on SQ in Brazil have been published. The SMAF could 

be an important, user-friendly tool for helping farmers, consultants, researchers and 

government officials make immediate and strategic decisions for improving SQ/health and 

agricultural sustainability. 

Therefore, we conducted an on-farm study across the largest sugarcane-producing 

regions of Brazil to assess effects of the primary land-use change sequence associated with 

sugarcane expansion (i.e., native vegetation to pasture to sugarcane) on SQ for a wide range 

of soil textures using SMAF. We hypothesized that: (i) long-term conversion from native 

vegetation to extensive pasture led to significant SQ degradation; (ii) under current practices 

sugarcane production soils are recovering SQ attributes lost when used as pasturelands; and 



 138 

(iii) SQ changes in Brazilian tropical soils under different land use and management systems 

could be detected by SMAF. 

 

6.2 Material and Methods 

 

6.2.1 Study sites and experimental design  

 

The study sites and experimental design were described in the 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 items. 

 

6.2.2 Soil sampling and laboratory analyses 

 

Soil samples within each land use (i.e., native vegetation, pasture and sugarcane) were 

collected using a consistent grid pattern composed of nine points spaced 50 m apart, providing 

a total of 27 sampling points (3 land uses x 9 points) for each site or 81 sampling points for 

the three studied sites. At each sampling point, a small trench (30 x 30 x 30 cm) was opened 

to collect undisturbed soil samples from the 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm depths using metallic 

cylinders with volume of about 100 cm
3
. This provided a total of 243 undisturbed soil 

samples for soil physical indicators quantification. Around of each central trench, composite 

samples consisting of 12 subsamples were collected using a Dutch auger, at same three 

depths. This provided an additional of 243 disturbed soil samples for chemical and biological 

analyses.  

Several soil indicators were analyzed. Chemical indicators included available P and K 

as well as active acidity (pHCaCl2 0.01M L
-1

) which were measured using analytical methods 

described in Raij et al. (2001). Physical indicators included bulk density (BD), calculated by 

dividing the soil dry mass by volume of the cylinder (100 cm
3
), and wet macroaggregate 

stability (AGS), determined using a vertical oscillator (Yoder, model MA-148) with three 

sieve-sizes (2000, 250, and 53 ?m) and a speed of 30 oscillations per minute for 10 minutes. 

The AGS (% macroaggregation) was calculated by summing aggregate mass for &gt;2000 and 

&gt;250 ?m classes, dividing by the total soil mass, and multiplying by 100. Particle-size was 

determined using a hydrometer method (GEE; OR, 2002). Biological indicators included: a) 

soil organic carbon (SOC), measured by dry combustion on a LECO
®
 CN-2000 elemental 

analyzer (furnace at 1350 ºC in pure oxygen); b) microbial biomass C (MBC), measured on 

three replicates of field-moist samples after fumigating for 24 h and extracting with 0.5M 

K2SO4 (VANCE; BROOKES; JENKINSON, 1987). Organic C in the fumigated and non-



 139 

fumigated extracts was measured using a TOC-Vcs/cp analyzer attached in a Shimadzu
®
 

SSM-5000A (Shimadzu, Kyoto - Japan) before calculating biomass C with a correction factor 

of k = 0.33; and c) ?-Glucosidase activity (BG) was measured using air-dried soil as described 

by Tabatabai (1994). The concentration of p-nitrophenol was determined in triplicate by 

measuring absorbance at 400 nm in a spectrophotometer, and results were expressed in mg of 

p-nitrophenol released kg
-1

 soil h
-1

. Both MBC and BG activity were analyzed only for 0-10 

cm soil layer.  

Data of SOC stocks and Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure (VESS) scores were used 

to verify their relationship with SMAF scores. Those measurements were made on soil 

samples collected at the same sites and sampling times and previously reported by Franco et 

al. (2015) and Cherubin et al. (2015b), respectively. Briefly, SOC stocks were calculated for 

each soil layer by multiplying the SOC content of each one by the soil bulk density and the 

layer thickness (10 cm). To account for the effect of differing soil bulk densities (due to land-

use change) on stock comparisons, the stocks within the pasture and sugarcane soils were 

adjusted to an equivalent soil mass based on measurements for native vegetation (LEE et al., 

2009). Subsequently, individual SOC stocks for the 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm layers were 

summed to provide a total SOC stock for 0-30 cm layer.  

Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure (VESS) is a semi-quantitative approach developed 

by Ball, Batey and Munkholm (2007) and improved by Guimarães, Ball and Tormena (2011) 

for on-farm assessment of the soil physical and structural capacity to support plant growth. 

Briefly, a VESS assessment consists of digging out a small trench using a spade and 

collecting a block soil (20 x 10 x 25 cm - approx. 5000 cm
-3

). The VESS evaluation includes 

manual breakdown of soil aggregates along their weakness lines, identification of layers 

having contrasting structure, measurement of layer depth and assignment of a score by 

comparing the structure of the sample with the aggregated characteristics proposed by 

Guimarães, Ball and Tormena (2011). The latter, developed as a VESS key chart, contains 

descriptions, pictures, and a score for each soil structure quality rating. The criteria taken 

account to assign the score are related to shape, size, strength and visible porosity of 

aggregates, as well as biological activity and presence of root inter- or intra-aggregates. The 

soil structural quality scores range from 1 (good) to 5 (poor), with 3 being considered a 

critical limit for suitable plant growth (BALL; BATEY; MUNKHOLM, 2007).

6.2.3 Soil Management Assessment Framework 

 

The SMAF was used as tool to evaluate the land-use change effects on SQ. The 

minimum dataset included eight soil indicators (pH, P, K, BD, AGS, SOC, MBC and BG) for 

0-10 cm layer and six soil indicators (pH, P, K, BD, AGS and SOC) for 10-20 and 20-30 cm 

layers. The importance of each one of these indicators to soil functionality is consistently 

reported in the literature (e.g., ANDREWS; KARLEN; CAMBARDELLA, 2004; STOTT et 

al., 2010; CARDOSO et al., 2013; ZORNOZA et al., 2015). The pH, available P and K 

provide information about soil acidity and nutrient availability status. Macroaggregation 

stability and BD indicate soil structural and physical conditions, which affect soil aeration, 

water infiltration and storage and soil’s ability to resist erosion process. Soil organic carbon, 

MBC and BG were chosen as biological indicators. The SOC plays crucial role in multiple 

soil processes including nutrient cycling and storage, food source for edaphic organisms and 

soil aggregation; while MBC and BG indicate the microbiological and biochemical activity of 

the soils.  

This approach is consistent with the general SMAF guidelines, which recommend 

using a minimum of five indicators with at least one each representing soil chemical, physical 

and biological properties and processes (KARLEN et al., 2008). These indicators were scored 

by transforming mean measured values into 0 - 1 values using previously published 

algorithms (ANDREWS; KARLEN; CAMBARDELLA, 2004; WIENHOLD et al., 2009; 

STOTT et al., 2010), which were used to compute an overall SQI for each land use and 

studied site. Those algorithms account for organic matter, texture, climate, slope, region, 

mineralogy, weathering class, crop, sampling time, and analytical method effects on the 

various threshold values. For this study, the organic matter factor class (based on soil 

classification and used for scoring AGS, SOC, MBC and BG) was 4 (low OM) for all sites. 

The texture factor class (used for scoring BD, AGS, SOC, MBC and BG) was 2 (clay content 

~17%) at Lat_21S and pasture in Lat_17S and 4 (clay contents &gt;40%) at Lat_17S (except 

pasture) and Lat_23S. The climate factor (used for scoring SOC, MBC and BG) was 1 (?170º 

days and ?550 mm of mean annual precipitation) for all sites. The seasonal factor, impacting 

MBC scores, was 2 (sampling on summer - January) for all sites. The Fe oxide, used for AGS 

scores, was 1 (Ultisol) for Lat_21S and 2 (other soils) for other sites. The mineralogy factor 

class, used for scoring BD, were 3 (clay 1:1 and Fe and Al oxides) and the slope and 

weathering class factors, used for scoring P, were 2 (2-5% slope) and 2 (high weathering), 

respectively, for all sites. The method used to measure extractable P was resin (class 5). We 



 141 

changed resin method factor from 3.1 to 1.25, to avoid overestimating the P scores under low 

P conditions in weathered soils. New crop factors, which affecting P and pH scores, needed to 

be added to SMAF spreadsheet for encompassing Brazilian natural vegetation (Cerrado and 

Atlantic forest), tropical grass (Brachiaria spp. and Cynodon spp.) and sugarcane. Phosphorus 

and pH thresholds for each “new crop” were set up using literature and expert’s opinions. 

Optimum P and pH values were: 6 mg dm
-3

 and 4.5 for Cerrado vegetation; 12 mg dm
-3

 and 

5.5 for Atlantic forest; 13 mg dm
-3

 and 5.5 for pasture; and 16 mg dm
-3

 and 6.0 for sugarcane 

(RAIJ et al., 1997). The SMAF algorithms are based on pHwater, therefore, pHCaCl2 was 

converted to pHwater by the regression fitted in Ciprandi (1993), pHwater = 0.890 + 0.922 

pHCaCl2 (r
2
 = 0.97, p&amp;lt;0.05). The SMAF scoring curve for K (WIENHOLD et al., 2009) is 

consistent with K recommendation classes adopted in Brazil (RAIJ et al., 1997).    

 In addition to individual indicator scores, an overall SQI was calculated by summing 

the scores and dividing by the number of indicators for each soil layer. The overall SQI was 

also subdivided into chemical (pH, P and K), physical (BD and AGS) and biological (SOC, 

MBC, and BG) sectors, as well as its relative contribution into overall SQI. This approach 

identifies the management areas of greatest concern (i.e., lowest index scores) so that land 

managers can be given better guidance on how to most efficiently restore or improve SQ at 

that specific location (STOTT et al., 2013, KARLEN et al., 2014). 

 

6.2.4 Data analyses 

 

An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was computed using PROC GLM procedure to test 

the influence of the land-use change within each site on individual soil indicators, SMAF 

scores and overall SQI values. If the ANOVA F statistic was significant (p&lt;0.05), the means 

were compared using Tukey’s test (p&lt;0.05). The analyses were performed separately by 

depth. An additional ANOVA was computed to test the land-use change effects in regional 

scale (all sites simultaneously) on overall SQI and SQI-sectors scores for 0-30 cm layer. 

Means were also compared using Tukey’s test (p&lt;0.05). Finally, regression analyses were 

performed using PROC REG procedure between SMAF scores and SOC stocks within each 

site for 0-30 cm depth, and between SMAF scores and VESS scores for sites with contrasting 

texture (Lat_21S: sandy soils; Lat_23S: clay soils). All statistical procedures were completed 

using the software Statistical Analysis System – SAS v.9.3 (SAS Inc, Cary, USA).

6.3 Results and Discussion 

 

6.3.1 Soil chemical indicators 

 

Soil chemical conditions were typical for tropical regions (Table 1). Soils of Cerrado 

biome in central-southern Brazil are highly weathering and characterized by high acidity and 

low nutrient availability, as shown by Lopes and Cox (1977). The transition from native 

vegetation to extensive pasture led to soil acidification and decreased nutrient levels, 

especially available P (Table 1). Soil acidification and nutrient depletions were the result of 

long-term (&gt;30 years) soil use with continuous grazing and the absence of lime and fertilizer 

inputs as indicated by Cherubin et al. (2015a). Higher K levels under pasture at Lat_21S and 

Lat_23S could be attributed to several factors such as greater K cycling, lower K losses 

(KAYSER; ISSELSTEIN, 2005), and release of non-exchangeable K forms by aggressive 

root system of grasses (ROSOLEN; VICENTINI; STEINER, 2012).  

The algorithms used in the SMAF were sensitive to detect the score changes for the 

chemical indicators under tropical conditions in Brazil (Table 2). As expected, we needed to 

add new “crop factors” into SMAF spreadsheet labeled as Brazilian Cerrado vegetation, 

Atlantic Forest vegetation, Brazilian tropical grasses (Brachiaria spp. and Cynodon spp.) and 

sugarcane. The SMAF scoring curves for pH and P have a parabolic shape denoting an 

optimum range, which takes into account crop-specific critical limits to sustain plant growth 

without causing environmental deleterious impacts (e.g., fresh water contamination). In 

general, the results showed that conversion of native vegetation to pasture decreased pH 

scores (average from 0.92 to 0.69) and P scores (average from 0.90 to 0.62), mainly at 

Lat_17S and Lat_21S sites (Table 2). The SMAF scoring curves for K also have a parabolic 

shape; however it was set up using a general response of crops to soil K levels according to 

Wienhold et al. (2009). Therefore, the K scores were lower than pH and P scores, especially 

at Lat_17S (more weathered soil) with averages of 0.38 and 0.19 under native vegetation and 

pasture, respectively. For Lat_21S and Lat_23S, K scores increased from native vegetation 

(average from 0.67 and 0.76) to pasture (average from 0.76 and 0.96) (Table 2).

The land-use change from pasture to sugarcane promoted overall improvements in soil 

chemical indicators. Sugarcane management including lime applications resulted in higher pH 



 145 

values in all sites, with average increasing from 4.6 (pasture) to 5.6 (sugarcane) (Table 1) and 

average pH scores from 0.69 (pasture) to 0.86 (sugarcane) (Table 2). Applications of mineral 

fertilizer and complementary organic residues in sugarcane fields increased P levels and 

scores (from 0.47 to 0.81) and increased or maintained K levels (average scores 0.48 for 

pasture and 0.47 for sugarcane) at Lat_17S and Lat_21S. Although both P and K levels had 

improvements with sugarcane cultivation, they were still below of the critical limits, P &gt;16 

mg dm
-3

 and K &gt;120 mg dm
-3

, established by Raij et al. (1997). In contrast, lower P and K 

levels and scores were found in sugarcane field compared to pasture at Lat_23S (Table 1), 

likely associated with the management of fertilization using insufficient amount of organic 

residues as verified by Cherubin et al. (2015a) and due to significant SOM depletions 

(FRANCO et al., 2015).  

All measurements for pH, P and K were concentrated at the increasing part of SMAF 

parabolic curves, confirming that acidity and low plant available P and K levels are the 

limiting factors for sugarcane production under Brazilian weathered soils. 

 

6.3.2 Soil physical indicators 

 

The land-use change from native vegetation to pasture induced soil compaction by 

increasing BD values (Table 1). Many studies have shown that cattle trampling is the major 

driver for soil compaction under pasture (e.g., GREENWOOD; McKENZIE, 2001; 

PIETOLA; HORN; YLI-HALLA, 2005). In addition, low pasture productivity (shoot and 

roots) has been verified under compacted soils, reducing C inputs into the soil (MAIA et al., 

2009; FRANCO et al., 2015), contributing to an increase in the soil structural degradation. 

The SMAF scoring curves for BD (less-is-better sigmoidal shapes), which take into account 

texture and mineralogical classes (ANDREWS; KARLEN; CAMBARDELLA, 2004), were 

able to identify alterations on BD due to land-use change effects (Table 2). The BD scores 

decreased from native vegetation (average 0.85) to pasture (average 0.44).  

Regarding macroaggregation stability (AGS), higher values were found under native 

vegetation and pasture, ranging from &gt;70% in sandy soils (Lat_21S) and &gt;90% in clay soils 

(Lat_23S). High AGS values are typically reported in studies under weathered Brazilian soils 

(e.g., MADARI et al., 2005; BARTHÈS et al., 2008), being associated primarily with a clay 

mineral composition dominated by Fe and Al oxides and 1:1 mineral layering in these soils 

(SIX; ELLIOTT; PAUSTIAN, 2000). In addition, Franco (2015) verified that soil macrofauna 

abundance plays important role in the soil aggregation processes in tropical soils; therefore, 



 146 

greater AGS under native vegetation and pasture are consistent with higher abundance of soil 

engineering invertebrates (i.e., earthworms and termites) in these areas (FRANCO, 2015). 

The SMAF scoring curves for AGS (more-is-better sigmoidal shapes) takes into account 

differences in SOM, texture and Fe oxides content (ANDREWS; KARLEN; 

CAMBARDELLA, 2004). However, for all possible variations of these factors, the maximum 

score (1.0) is assigned when the AGS values are higher than 50% (threshold value from which 

soil structural stability is optimum for environment protection and productivity goals). 

Therefore, using the current SMAF scoring curves, AGS scores was a non-sensitive indicator 

to detect land-use change impacts in tropical soils, reaching practically score 1.0 for all sites 

(Table 2). Macroaggregation stability has been globally used as SQ indicator (CARDOSO et 

al., 2013; KARLEN et al., 2013, 2014; STOTT et al., 2013; ZORNOZA et al., 2015) due to 

its crucial role on C stabilization and protection, mediating soil physical processes related to 

water and air dynamic and providing resistance against soil erosion. Therefore, additional 

SMAF scoring curves for AGS need to be developed for applying and detecting smaller 

changes caused by recent land use and management under well-aggregated tropical soils. 

Conversion from pasture to sugarcane have been done through intensive 

mechanization raising the concern on soil compaction. Although BD had no significant 

differences between sugarcane and pasture, the values found in sugarcane [&gt;1.2 Mg dm
-3

 for 

clay soil and &gt;1.6 Mg dm
-3

 for sandy soils (Table 1)] are considered critical for sustaining 

adequate plant growth as shown by Reynolds et al. (2002). Using SMAF, the average BD 

score was 0.41 (Table 2), confirming that soil compaction is one of major driver to SQ 

degradation under sugarcane fields. Tillage operations carried out during sugarcane replanting 

(~ every 5 years) alleviated soil compaction (i.e., decreased BD), but this positive effect was 

limited to the surface layer (10 cm depth) in the sugarcane field at Lat_17S and probably has 

short-term persistence as verified in other Brazilian soils by Silva et al. (2012). In addition, 

soil tillage promoted breakup of the macroaggregates and, SOC and macrofauna losses, 

decreasing AGS values under sugarcane production (Table 1). As discussed previously, even 

though AGS depletions were statistically significant, AGS scores were close to 1, generally 

equal those found under native vegetation and pasture (Table 2).  

 

6.3.3 Soil biological indicators 

 

Greater SOC contents were found under native vegetation, ranging from 11.2 to 36.7 g 

kg
-1

 (Table 1), depending of soil taxonomic class, texture and climate. These factors are taken 



 147 

into account in the SMAF scoring curves (more-is-better sigmoidal shapes) for SOC thus 

accounting for inherent soil characteristics that can affect the score (ANDREWS; KARLEN; 

CAMBARDELLA, 2004). The land-use change from native vegetation to pasture decreased 

SOC content (Table 1) and average scores from 0.95 to 0.79 (Table 2). These SOC losses in 

tropical regions are well documented in the literature (MAIA et al., 2009; MELLO et al., 

2014; FRANCO et al., 2015) as result of conversion process and low C inputs due to low 

grass productivity and inadequate grazing management. The MBC values were high in all 

sites, especially in more clay soil (Lat_23S). Conversions from native vegetation to pasture 

trend to decrease MBC at Lat_17S and Lat_21S (Table 1), similar to that observed for SOC, 

confirming the close relationship between MBC and SOC (r = 0.88 p&lt;0.01). Regardless of 

site and effects of land-use change, the SMAF scores for MBC ranged from 0.95 to 1.0, 

without differences among land uses (Table 2). These results are consistent with study of  

Lopes et al. (2013), who defined that MBC values &gt; 375 mg kg
-1

 are classified as high under 

clayey Oxisols in Brazilian Cerrado.  

The BG activity responses to land-use change were statistically different within each 

site. At Lat_23S, BG values significantly decreased from native vegetation to pasture. In 

contrast, significantly higher BG was found under pasture compared to native vegetation at 

Lat_21S, probably associated with higher pH under native vegetation soil (Table 1). The 

SMAF scores for BG decreased from native vegetation (1.0) to pasture (0.84) at Lat_23S, 

there was a slight increase from native vegetation (0.91) to pasture (1.0) at Lat_21S and there 

were not significant differences at Lat_17S, in which the lowest scores were observed (Table 

2). The SMAF scoring curves for BG were sensitive to alterations induced by land-use 

change. The inclusion of a dataset from Brazilian Cerrado soils for the development and 

validation of the SMAF-BG algorithms (STOTT et al., 2010) likely contributed to the good 

performance for the soils of this study. In addition, previously, Lopes et al. (2013) had 

verified that critical limits for BG activity defined as function of crop yield and SOC in clayey 

Brazilian Oxisols were consistent with SMAF-BG scores (i.e., values in the low and high 

interpretative classes were equivalent to SMAF-BG scores of 0.85 and 0.32, respectively). 

Short-term transitions from pasture to sugarcane (&lt;5 years) did not promote 

significant SOC changes at Lat_17S and Lat_21S (Table 1). However, after more than 20 

years of sugarcane including approximately 10 years of burning pre-harvest, significant SOC 

depletion and reduced MBC and BG activity at Lat_23S (Table 1) was observed. For that site, 

SOC scores showed a slight decrease from pasture (1.0) to sugarcane (0.98), MBC scores 

showed no differences and BG scores had marked depletion under sugarcane field (0.23). 



 148 

These results are consistent with large studies recently carried out in central-southern Brazil 

by Mello et al. (2013) and Bordonal et al. (2015).  

 

6.3.4 Overall Soil Quality Index and scores 

 

Overall SQI and SQI sectors (i.e., chemical, physical and biological) for each depth 

and site are shown in Figure 1 and in regional scale (Figure 2) for the 0-30 cm. The SQI 

computed for each depths (0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm) indicated that SQ decreased in depth, 

regardless of the land use and site. Several factors contribute for improving SQ in the first 

centimeters, such as inputs of C from litter and crop residues on the soil surface, greater 

biological and biochemical activity, higher nutrient cycling and fertilizer inputs, better soil 

structure and physical resistance as well as better soil resilience to stress due to animal 

trampling and machinery traffic. We highlighted that SMAF scores calculated for deeper 

layers (&lt;15 cm depth) must be carefully interpreted, since SMAF scoring algorithms were 

originally developed for near surface soils.  

The highest SQI were verified in the native vegetation soils ranging from 0.72 to 0.77 

at Lat_17S, from 0.87 to 0.92 at Lat_21S and from 0.94 to 0.97 at Lat_23S. In regional scale, 

average SQI suggests these soils are functioning at 87% of their potential capacity for the 0-

30 cm layer (Figure 2). The SQI-sectors were also higher under native vegetation for all 

studied sites and depths (Figures 1 and 2). These results demonstrate that natural ecosystems 

are in dynamic balance, where chemical, physical and biological attributes act cooperatively 

in such way that soils perform their functions properly. Conversion from native vegetation to 

pasture promoted significant SQ degradation, with SQI values ranging from 0.51 to 0.77, 0.61 

to 0.85 and 0.86 to 0.92 at Lat_17S, Lat_21S and Lat_23S, respectively. In regional scale, 

average SQI suggests these soils are functioning at 70% of their potential capacity for the 0-

30 cm layer (Figure 2). Long-term land use with extensive pasture led to chemical 

impoverishment of the soil, increasing soil compaction and its deleterious impacts on soil 

physical processes and negative impacts on biological indicators driven by SOC depletions, as 

evidenced by SQI-sectors scores in Figure 2B. Recent estimates suggest that 70% of Brazilian 

pasturelands are degraded or in the process of being degraded (DIAS-FILHO, 2014), and SQ 

degradation caused by inadequate management of pasture and animals is considered the major 

driver of this process. We believe that investigations using robust frameworks, such as 

SMAF, for assessing SQ under extensive pasture in Brazil could help farmers make the best 

decision about more sustainable uses for their lands and guide government’s strategic 



 149 

planning for agriculture expansion and/or funding the adoption of strategies for recovery 

degraded pasturelands (e.g., Low-Carbon Agriculture program).

77% their potential capacity (Figure 1). At Lat_23S, although SQI decreased under sugarcane, 

likely due to previous management involving burning pre-harvest and significant SOC losses 

(FRANCO et al., 2015) and current fertilization practices, the soil is functioning at 79% of its 

potential capacity (Figure 1). In regional scale (Figure 2) the SQI indicated that sugarcane 

expansion under extensive pasture led to slight, but significant improvement on SQ. 

Therefore, sugarcane soils are functioning at 74% their potential capacity within 0-30 cm 

layer. This SQ improvement was driven by inputs of lime and fertilizer, which significantly 

increased chemical SQI-sector (Figure 2B). These findings demonstrate how important the 

proper management of fertilization is in the agricultural systems for sustaining SQ in tropical 

regions. Physical and biological SQI-sectors had no differences between sugarcane and 

pasture soils, which had average decreases of 22 and 15% their physical and biological 

functioning capacity compared with native vegetation soils.   

Our SQ assessment, based on SMAF scores, suggests that sugarcane cultivation has 

improved soil quality compared to extensive pasturelands. Therefore, sugarcane expansion 

reintegrates degraded pasturelands into a productive system, providing more economical and 

social benefits with positive environmental offsets [i.e., improving soil quality, saving 

greenhouse gas emissions (MELLO et al., 2014; BORDONAL et al., 2015) and alleviating 

deforestation of natural ecosystems (MELLO et al., 2014; GOLDEMBERG et al., 2014)]. 

However, to avoid future SQ decline in sugarcane fields we recommend the adoption of 

management strategies (e.g., maintenance of sugarcane straw on soil surface, application of 

organic residues as complementary fertilization, minimum or no-tillage system associated to 

crop rotation, controlled machinery traffic), which ensure proper soil fertility to achieve 

nutritional demands of sugarcane crop, improve soil C sequestration and mitigate deleterious 

impacts from tillage and machine traffic on soil physical properties and processes.  

 

6.3.4 Overall Soil Quality Index versus SOC stocks and VESS scores 

 

Globally, SOC is the most common single indicator used for assessing impacts of the 

land-use changes and agricultural management practices on SQ and its multiple ecosystems 

services (CARDOSO et al., 2013; ZORNOZA et al., 2015). In Brazil, several studies have 

assessed the sustainability of biofuel crops expansion through SOC stock changes (FRAZÃO 

et al., 2014; MELLO et al., 2014; FRANCO et al., 2015). In the United States, Soil 

Conditioning Index was adopted by the USDA-NRCS to investigate effects of agricultural 

practices on SOC, and infer changes in SQ (USDA-NRCS, 2003). Zobeck et al. (2008, 2014) 



 152 

compared agricultural management effects using Soil Conditioning Index and SMAF-SQI. 

The authors concluded that both methodologies were able to identify SQ changes; however, 

since SMAF includes several chemical, physical and biological indicators, it provides more 

detailed information about soil quality than Soil Conditioning Index.  

 Linear regressions between SOC stocks and SQI scores obtained using SMAF are 

shown in Figure 3. Soil organic carbon stocks explained between 53 to 78% of the variation in 

overall SQI. These finding support two important statements: (i) changes in SOC stocks 

results in modifications in physical, chemical and biological attributes of SQ, which are 

encompassed in the SMAF-SQI scores, supporting SOC as a universal indicator of SQ. 

However, when multiple indicators are used together the SQ assessment becomes more 

accurate and enables to identify which critical conditions need priority management (e.g., soil 

fertility, soil compaction, biological activity, etc); and (ii) these strong positive correlations 

validated SQI scores, since SOC stock is broadly recognized as a suitable endpoint for 

environmental protection and crop productivity management goals.  

 

 
Figure 3 - Relationship between soil organic carbon stocks and overall soil quality index 

(SQI) scores, 0-30 cm layer, for the land-use change [i.e., native vegetation (NV) – 

pasture (PA) – sugarcane (SC)] at three sites (Lat_17S, Lat_21S and Lat_23S) in 

central-southern Brazil 

 

 We also verified significant relationship between SQI-physical sector and overall SQI 

scores with VESS scores (Figure 4). Our results showed that the variation in SQI-physical sector 

SQI Lat_17S = 0.186 + 0.014x   

r² = 0.72 p&lt;0.001 

SQI Lat_21S = 0.587 + 0.005x

and overall SQI can be explained by VESS at 56 and 51% under sandy soils and at 32 and 

25% under clay soils, respectively. Using the equations described in Figure 4 and the critical 

value of VESS= 3, it was verified that SQI-physical and overall SQI reached values that 

corresponding to 76 and 82% of physical functioning and, 80 and 89% of overall functioning 

respectively for sandy and clay soils. We assume that a sharper decline in SQI-physical and SQI 

scores must be observed when VESS scores are greater than 4, which were not found in the 

studied sites.  

 

 
 

Figure 4 - Relationship among Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure (VESS) scores, overall 

soil quality index (SQI) and SQI-Physical sector scores under native vegetation, 

pasture and sugarcane areas in central-southern Brazil 

 

These results suggest that VESS measures more than soil structural quality, with 

advantages of to be an on-farm method, simple to perform and easy to understand 

(GUIMARÃES; BALL; TORMENA, 2011; BALL; MUNKHOLM; BATEY, 2013; 

MULLER et al., 2013). Therefore, the VESS method could be used as a complementary tool 

for monitoring SQ in areas undergoing land-use change for sugarcane expansion in Brazil. In 

addition, we suggest that VESS could be further included into the SMAF or used to replace 

other soil physical properties. Thereby, studies in a wide range of soils and agricultural 

managements systems are necessary to developed reliable SMAF scoring curves for VESS.

6.4 Conclusions 

 

This study was the first application of SMAF for assessing SQ changes in Brazil and 

confirmed our hypothesis that SMAF would be sensitive enough to detect SQ changes 

associated with sugarcane expansion. In general, the SMAF scoring curves developed 

primarily on North American soils properly assigned scores for soil chemical, physical and 

biological indicators included in this study. The SMAF indicator scores were useful for 

evaluating which sectors require priority management, while overall SQI score integrated all 

sectored information into a single value, enabling to detect global SQ changes induced by 

land-use change impacts. Overall SQI calculated by SMAF was positively correlated with 

SOC stocks (r
2
 = 0.53 to 0.78), which is recognized for its multiples ecosystems functions. In 

addition, SQI was negatively correlated with VESS scores (r
2
 = 0.25 to 0.51), a simpler semi-

quantitative method that has showed potential for on-farm monitoring of SQ changes. 

Therefore, the SMAF was a reliable and efficient tool to detect the land-use change effects on 

SQ under Brazilian tropical conditions. However, futures studies are encouraged to adjust and 

validate SMAF algorithms using dataset from tropical soils and expanding its use around the 

world. 

Our findings suggest that native vegetation land use had the greatest SQ, with soils 

functioning on average at 87% of their potential capacity. Replacing native vegetation by 

pasture decreased SQ to 70% of its potential capacity. Land-use change from pasture to 

sugarcane induced slight improvements on SQ, mainly driven by increasing on soil chemical 

quality. Overall, sugarcane soils are functioning at 74% of their potential capacity. Based in 

this study, management strategies that sustain proper soil fertility for sugarcane growth, 

increase soil C sequestration and alleviate soil compaction and erosion are recommended to 

improve SQ and the sustainability of sugarcane production in Brazil.

7 SOIL QUALITY INDEXING STRATEGIES FOR EVALUATING SUGARCANE 

EXPANSION IN BRAZIL 

 

 

Abstract 

 

      Increasing demand for biofuel has intensified land-use change (LUC) for sugarcane 

(Saccharum officinarum) expansion in Brazil. Assessments of soil quality (SQ) response to 

this LUC are essential for quantifying and monitoring sustainability of sugarcane production 

over time. Since there is not a universal methodology for assessing SQ, we conducted a field-

study at three sites within the largest sugarcane-producing region of Brazil to develop a SQ 

index (SQI). The most common LUC scenario (i.e., native vegetation to pasture to sugarcane) 

was evaluated using six SQI strategies with varying complexities. Thirty eight soil indicators 

were included in the total dataset. Two minimum datasets were selected: one using principal 

component analysis (7 indicators) and the other based on expert opinion (5 indicators). Non-

linear scoring curves were used to interpret the indicator values. Simple and weighted additive 

methods were used to combine individual indicator scores into an overall SQI. Long-term 

conversion from native vegetation to extensive pasture significantly decreased overall SQ. In 

contrast, conversion from pasture to sugarcane had no significant impact on overall SQ at the 

regional scale, but site-specific responses were found. In general, sugarcane production 

improved chemical attributes; however it has negative effects on physical and biological 

attributes. Overall, we found that simple, user-friendly strategies were as effective as more 

complex ones for identifying SQ changes. Therefore, as a protocol for SQ assessments in 

Brazilian sugarcane areas, we recommend using a small number of indicators [e.g., pH, P, K, 

Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure (VESS) scores and SOC concentration] and proportional 

weighting to reflect chemical, physical and biological processes within the soil. Our SQ 

evaluations also suggest that current approaches for expanding Brazilian sugarcane 

production by converting degraded pasture land to cropland can be a sustainable strategy for 

meeting increasing biofuel demand. However, management practices that alleviate negative 

impacts on soil physical and biological indicators must be prioritized within sugarcane 

producing areas to prevent unintentional SQ degradation over time.

7.1 Introduction 

 

Increasing global demand for biofuel has accelerated land-use change (LUC) to 

support bioenergy crops in many countries. In Brazil, the area devoted to sugarcane 

production increased from 5.8 to 9.0 Mha during the last decade (COMPANHIA NACIONAL 

DE ABASTECIMENTO, 2016). Even though Brazil is already the world’s largest sugarcane 

producer, current predictions indicate that an additional 6.4 Mha of sugarcane will be needed 

to meet the domestic demand for ethanol by 2021 (GODEMBERG et al., 2014). Sugarcane 

expansion has primarily occurred on land previously occupied by extensive pastures 

(LAPOLA et al., 2010; GODEMBERG et al., 2014), most of which are degraded or in the 

process of being degraded (DIAS-FILHO, 2014; STRASSBURG et al., 2014). To obtain 



 162 

long-term energy security, bioenergy systems will need to be agronomically and 

environmentally sustainable. Intensification of land use through mechanization and 

agrochemical inputs has direct implications on soil physical, chemical and biological 

properties and consequently on the quality/health of soils. To prevent unintended 

consequences, monitoring of soil property changes due to LUC is essential (FU et al., 2015; 

ZORNOZA et al., 2015). However, this research topic is still new in Brazil, and we are not 

aware of any protocol for evaluating soil quality (SQ) changes induced by sugarcane 

expansion in this region. 

Soil quality was defined as the capacity of a specific kind of soil to function, within 

natural or managed ecosystem boundaries, to sustain plant and animal productivity, maintain 

or enhance water and air quality, and support human health and habitation (KARLEN et al., 

1997). It is a complex functional concept and cannot be measured directly in the field or 

laboratory; but can be indirectly inferred by soil indicators (KARLEN et al., 1997; 

MUKHERJEE; LAL, 2014). Indicators of SQ are those measurable soil properties and 

processes that have greatest sensitivity to changes in soil function and its ecosystem services 

(ANDREWS; KARLEN; CAMBARDELLA, 2004; ZORNOZA et al., 2015). A wide range 

of soil chemical, physical and biological properties could be measured (CARDOSO et al., 

2013; ZORNOZA et al., 2015), but due to cost it’s not feasible to consider them all, and 

therefore it is necessary to select a minimum dataset (MDS). Several strategies have been 

used to define an appropriate MDS including principal component analysis (PCA) (LIMA; 

HOOGMOED; BRUSSAARD, 2008; ARMENISE et al., 2013; CHEN et al., 2013; ASKARI; 

HOLDEN, 2014; 2015; MUKHERJEE; LAL, 2014; SÁNCHEZ-NAVARRO et al., 2015), 

fuzzy sets (QI et al., 2009; XIA et al., 2015), expert opinion (ANDREWS; KARLEN; 

MITCHELL, 2002; ANDREWS; KARLEN; CAMBARDELLA, 2004) and farmer/local 

knowledge (LIMA; HOOGMOED; BRUSSAARD, 2011; TESFAHUNEGN; TAMENE; 

VLEK, 2011). According Doran and Parkin (1994) suitable SQ indicators should correlate 

well with ecosystem processes, integrate soil properties and processes, be accessible to many 

users, sensitive to management and climate, and, whenever possible, be components of 

existing databases. An example for reducing the number of potential SQ indicators was 

provided by Andrews, Karlen and Cambardella (2004) through their development of the Soil 

Management Assessment Framework (SMAF). Starting with an extensive list of 80 or more 

integrative measurements related to ecosystem processes and functions that reflect SQ, they 

developed scoring curves only for a small number (i.e., 10) of carefully selected indicators 

that could reliably detect SQ changes induced by agricultural management practices. In more 



 163 

recent studies, others have shown that small datasets can effectively characterize SQ within 

different ecosystems. Lima et al. (2013) compared SQ assessment using a total dataset (TDS) 

of 29 indicators, a MDS of eight indicators based on PCA, and an indigenous set of four 

indicators based on farmer knowledge to evaluate rice (Oryza sativa L.) production systems in 

southern Brazil. They concluded that the TDS provided the best assessment of SQ, but the 

smaller datasets showed the same SQ trends and thus provided meaningful information for 

land managers. Askari and Holden (2014; 2015) reduced the number of indicators using PCA 

from 21 to 3 and from 22 to 7, respectively, and verified that the MDS indicators were 

suitable to efficiently quantify SQ in grassland and arable fields in Ireland. 

After defining a MDS, linear and non-linear techniques, each with their advantages 

and disadvantages, have been applied to interpret SQ indicators (ANDREWS et al., 2002; 

MASTO et al., 2008; ASKARI and HOLDEN, 2014, 2015). While linear methods are simple, 

user-friendly and require little knowledge of the indicator thresholds, non-linear methods can 

more often assign meaningful scores that better represent the soil functions being represented 

by the indicators (ANDREWS; KARLEN; MITCHELL, 2002) 

 Once individual indicators have been scored, it is often convenient, but not essential, 

to integrate them into an overall SQ index (SQI) that can be used to support decision making 

and selection of sustainable management practices (de PAUL OBADE; LAL, 2016). 

Currently, there is no comprehensive, universal SQI that can be used across multiple natural 

and anthropogenic ecosystems. Many indexing strategies have been developed and tested for 

specific purposes under particular environmental conditions around the world [e.g., in the 

U.S.A. (ANDREWS; KARLEN; MITCHELL, 2002; ANDREWS; KARLEN; 

CAMBARDELLA, 2004; MUKHERJEE; LAL, 2014; de PAUL OBADE; LAL, 2016), 

Brazil (LIMA et al., 2013), Argentina (ROMANIUK et al., 2011), Italy (ARMENISE et al., 

2013), Spain (SÁNCHEZ-NAVARRO et al., 2015), Ireland (ASKARI; HOLDEN, 2014; 

2015), South Africa (SWANEPOEL et al., 2015), India (MASTO et al., 2008) and China (QI 

et al., 2009; CHEN et al., 2013; LIU et al., 2015)]. The most user-friendly method to calculate 

a SQI is to simply add all indicator scores and then divide by the number of indicators 

(ANDREWS; KARLEN; MITCHELL, 2002; ANDREWS; KARLEN; CAMBARDELLA, 

2004; KARLEN et al., 2013; MUKHERJEE; LAL, 2014). The major concern regarding this 

method is that when the number of indicators is unbalanced among chemical, physical and 

biological sectors, the overall SQI misrepresents the sector(s) having fewer indicators. On the 

other hand, several studies have used methods that assign weights for each indicator. Different 

criteria that have been used include soil function frameworks (KARLEN; STOTT, 1994; 



 164 

LIMA et al., 2013; MUKHERJEE; LAL, 2014), principal components loading (ANDREWS; 

KARLEN; MITCHELL, 2002; MASTO et al., 2008; MUKHERJEE; LAL, 2014; LIU et al., 

2015; SÁNCHEZ-NAVARRO et al., 2015), partial least squares regression coefficients (de 

PAUL OBADE; LAL, 2016) and correlation with crop yield (NAKAJIMA; LAL; JIANG, 

2015). Simple and weighted additive SQ indexing strategies provide site-specific responses 

(ANDREWS; KARLEN; MITCHELL, 2002; ASKARI; HOLDEN, 2014; 2015; 

MUKHERJEE; LAL, 2014), influenced by existing dataset, soil type, and effects of land use 

and management practices.  

 Developing more user-friendly and cost-effective strategies for assessing SQ changes 

induced by agricultural management practices, especially those associated to bioenergy 

feedstock production therefore remains a challenge for the scientific community 

(ANDREWS; KARLEN; MITCHELL, 2002;  MUKHERJEE; LAL, 2014; de PAUL 

OBADE; LAL, 2016). Our goal was to develop a sensitive and reliable protocol for 

evaluating SQ impact associated with LUC occurring to increase Brazilian sugarcane 

production. To do so, we conducted a field-study at three sites where the primary LUC 

sequence (i.e., native vegetation to pasture to sugarcane) is occurring within of the largest 

sugarcane-producing region of Brazil. Six SQ indexing strategies with varying complexity 

were developed and tested. Our hypotheses were that: (i) the LUC sequence would result in 

SQ degradation; (ii) the SQI approach would be suitable to detect SQ changes due to LUC; 

and (iii) the simple, more user-friendly strategies would be able to detect SQ changes as 

effectively as more complex strategies. 

 

7.2 Material and Methods 

 

7.2.1 Study sites and experimental design  

 

The study sites and experimental design were described in the 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 items. 

 

7.2.2 Soil sampling and analyses 

 

All soil samples were collected using a consistent experimental design that had four 

points spaced 50 m apart imposed within each land use. This provided 12 sampling points for 

each location or 36 sampling points for the three locations. A small trench (30 x 30 x 30 cm) 

was opened at each sampling point to collect both undisturbed and semi-undisturbed samples 



 165 

from the 0 to 10-, 10 to 20- and 20 to 30-cm layers. This provided 108 samples for physical 

analyses, and 108 for soil aggregation and macrofauna analyses. An additional 108 disturbed 

samples were collected for chemical and biological analyses by compositing 12 subsamples 

taken from each soil layer with a Dutch auger.  

Available phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sulfur (S – 

sulphate), boron (B), cooper (Cu), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), active acidity 

(pHCaCl2 0.01mol L
-1

), potential acidity (H+Al), base saturation (BS) and cation exchange 

capacity (CECpH7) were determined using analytical methods described by Raij et al. (2001). 

Soil resistance to penetration (SRP) and field-saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kfs) were 

measured at five and three locations, respectively, within ~5 m of each trench using a digital 

penetrometer (PenetroLOG®) and the ‘simplified falling-head’ method proposed by 

Bagarello, Iovino and Elrick (2004). Soil structural quality of the 20 x 10 x 25 cm monoliths 

from each trench was assessed using the Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure (VESS) method 

(BALL; BATEY; MUNKHOLM, 2007; GUIMARÃES; BALL; TORMENA, 2011). Particle-

size was determined using the hydrometer method. Bulk density (BD) was determined based 

on the core method with 100 cm
-3

cylinder. Soil degree of compactness (SDC) was calculated 

as SDC = [(BD/BDmax) x 100], where BDmax is maximum bulk density, estimated using a 

pedotransfer function described by Marcolin and Klein et al. (2011). The total porosity (TP) 

was calculated as TP = 1 - (BD/PD), where, PD is particle density, determined using a gas 

pycnometer. Soil water content at -6 kPa and -10 kPa water potential was determined using 

tension tables as described by Ball and Hunter (1988). Soil macroporosity (MaP) was 

computed as the difference between soil water content at saturation and at -6 kPa. Soil 

microporosity (MiP) was estimated as the soil water content at the -6 kPa. Water-filled pore 

space (WFPS) was calculated by dividing volumetric moisture at -6 kPa by total porosity as 

indicated in Wienhold et al. (2009). We also calculated two indexes suggested by Reynolds et 

al. (2002): i) soil water storage capacity (SWSC) defined as the ratio between water content at 

field capacity (FC, -10 kPa soil water potential) and TP (SWSC = FC/TP); and ii) soil 

aeration capacity (SAC) calculated as the ratio between drained pores at soil water potential 

of -10 kPa (ACt) and TP (SAC = ACt/TP). A structural stability index (SSI) was calculated as 

suggested by Reynolds et al. (2009): SSI = [(SOC x 1.724) / (silt + clay)]*100. Wet 

macroaggregate stability (AGS) was determined using a vertical oscillator (Yoder, model 

MA-148) with three sieves (2000, 250, and 53 ?m) moving at a speed of 30 oscillations per 

min for 10 min. Percentage of macroaggregates  was calculated by summing aggregate mass 

for &gt;2000 and 250 ?m classes, dividing by the total soil mass, and multiplying by 100. Mean 



 166 

weight diameter (MWD) was calculated as the sum of the proportion of aggregates in each 

size fraction, with each proportion weighted by the mean diameter of aggregates in that size 

fraction. Soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) were determined by dry 

combustion on a LECO® CN-2000 elemental analyzer (furnace at 1350 ºC in pure oxygen). 

Carbon and nitrogen within microbial biomass (MBC and MBN) were measured by 

fumigation/extraction as proposed by Vance, Brookes and Jenkinson (1987). Enzymatic 

activities of ?-Glucosidase (BG) and acid phosphatase (AcP) were measured as described by 

Tabatabai (1994). Immediately after the sampling, soil macrofauna were carefully hand-sorted 

from each 25 x 25 x 30 cm soil block, according to the standard Tropical Soil Biology and 

Fertility Institute (TSBF) soil monolith method (ANDERSON; INGRAM, 1993). 

Invertebrates were classified into the taxonomic groups: Aranae, Blattodea, Chilopoda, 

Coleoptera, Dermaptera, Diplopoda, Diptera, Formicidae, others Hymenoptera, Gastropoda, 

Hemiptera, Isopoda, Isoptera, Oligochaeta, and Scorpiones. Macrofauna density was 

determined as the number of individuals per surface unit (m
2
). Ecological indexes were 

calculated for assessing richness (Margalef’s index) and diversity (Shannon’s index), 

according to the methods described by Magurran (2004). 

 

7.2.3 Developing the soil quality indexes 

 

Six SQI values were developed using different approaches (Figure 1), although each 

involved three common steps: selection of SQ indicators as an MDS, transformation of 

indicator values into unitless 0 to 1 scores using scoring curves, and integration into an overall 

index (KARLEN; DITZLER; ANDREWS, 2003). The SQIs were compared to identify the 

most appropriate strategy for assessing SQ changes induced by LUC associated with 

sugarcane expansion in Brazil. Soil data from the 0 to 10-, 10 to 20- and 20 to 30-cm layers 

were averaged to create a 0 to 30-cm layer that was then used to calculate an overall SQI that 

better represented the whole soil profile.

(a) Step 1- Indicator selection 

Three indicator selection approaches were evaluated: (i) the Total Dataset (TDS) 

which included 38 indicators representing 14 chemical, 14 physical and 10 biological 

properties and processes; (ii) a MDS-PCA created using PCA on the TDS to reduce data 

redundancy and identify the most efficient indicators, without depending upon subjective, 

expert opinion or literature values; and (iii) a five indicator MDS-EO chosen based on expert 

opinion and literature review. For the MDS-PCA, only seven components with eigenvalues 

&gt;1 (Kaiser’s criteria) were retained and subjected to varimax rotation to enhance the 

interpretability of the components (Figure 2). Furthermore, for each component, only the 

indicators with loading values within 10% of the highest value were retained (ANDREWS; 

KARLEN; MITCHELL, 2002; CHEN et al., 2013; ASKARI; HOLDEN, 2014; 2015; LIU et 

al., 2015). When more than one indicator was retained, correlation values among them were 

analyzed. If the indicators were significantly correlated (p&lt;0.01), only the one with the 

highest loading factor was retained in the MDS to avoid redundancy (ANDREWS; KARLEN; 

MITCHELL, 2002; CHEN et al., 2013; MUKHERJEE; LAL, 2014). The MDS-EO was 

selected taking into account the indicator’s ability to detect soil function changes as well as 

the ease, practicality and cost-effectiveness for sampling, analysis and interpretation.

(b) Step 2- Indicator interpretation 

All measured indicator values were transformed using non-linear scoring functions. 

Based on agronomic and environmental soil functions, each indicator was scored using one of 

the following curves: “more is better” (upper asymptote sigmoid curve), “less in better” 

(lower asymptote sigmoid curve), and “mid-point optimum” (Gaussian curve), as exemplified 

in Figure 3. The non-linear equations 1 and 2 were used for “more is better” and “less is 

better” scoring curve shapes, respectively. For “mid-point optimum” curve the equations 1 

and 2 were jointly used in the increasing and decreasing parts of the curve, respectively.

(c) Step 3- Indicator integration into an index 

The indicator scores were integrated into indexes through two approaches, simple 

additive (Equation 3) used to calculate SQI-1, SQI-3 and SQI-5 (Figure 1); and weighted 

additive (Equation 4) used to calculate SQI-2, SQI-4 and SQI-6 (Figure 1).

where, Si is the indicator score, n the number of indicators integrated in the index and Wi the 

weighted value of the indicators. For the TDS, the indicators were weighted according to a 

framework developed based on five soil functions (Table 2), as suggested by Karlen and Stott 

(1994) and later used by Lima et al. (2013). Step by step procedure used for calculate the SQI-

2 is shown in the Table 2. For the MDS-PCA, the indicators were weighted according with 

proportional variation explained by each principal component (i.e., % variance explained by 

each component divided by total cumulative variance of all components selected for the 

MDS). For the MDS-EO the indicators were weighted by chemical, physical and biological 

sectors, in which each one, regardless of number of indicators, had the same weight (33%) in 

the final index.  

 

Sensitivity of SQ indexing strategies 

 The sensitivity of the SQ indexing strategies for detecting LUC impacts on SQ was 

calculated using equation 5, described by Masto et al. (2008). 

 

Sensitivity (S) = SQI (max) / SQI (min)                                                         (5) 

 

where, SQI(max) and SQI(min) are the maximum and minimum SQI observed within each SQ 

indexing strategies.

7.2.4 Data analyses 

 

  Data were tested for normality using Shapiro-Wilk’s tests (p&gt;0.05). The results 

indicated that no transformation was required. Principal component analysis was performed 

using PROC FACTOR procedure to select a MDS based on a statistical approach. An analysis 

of variance (ANOVA) was computed using PROC GLM procedure to test LUC effects on soil 

indicators and SQI scores. If the ANOVA F statistic was significant (p&lt;0.05), the means were 

compared using Tukey’s test (p&lt;0.05). Linear correlations among SQI strategies were verified 

by Pearson’s correlation analysis using PROC CORR procedure. All statistical procedures 

were completed using Statistical Analysis System – SAS v.9.3 (SAS Inc, Cary, USA). 

 

7.3 Results and Discussion 

 

7.3.1 Soil quality indicators 

 

Land-use change effects on the 38 soil quality indicators at each site are presented in 

Table 3. As typically reported for tropical soils, native vegetation sites were characterized by 

high acidity, low levels of soil organic matter (SOM) and plant-available macronutrients, 

suitable soil physical conditions, and high activity as well as diversity of edaphic fauna. Long-

term conversion from native vegetation to extensive pasture significantly increased soil 

acidification (i.e., decreased pH and increased H+Al concentrations), depleted SOM (SOC 

and TN), available macronutrients, B and CTCpH7 and, increased micronutrient (Cu, Fe, Mn 

and Zn) availability. Poor long-term management, which typically includes continuous 

grazing without liming and/or applying fertilizer over time (DIAS-FILHO, 2014; 

STRASSBURG et al., 2014), is a major factor for SOC and nutrient depletion within 

Brazilian pastures. Conversion from native vegetation to pasture also degraded soil physical 

properties. Continuous cattle trampling coupled with SOC depletion, increased soil 

compaction (i.e., higher BD and SDC) and altered pore size and distribution (i.e., lower MaP 

and higher MiP). This subsequently reduced soil aeration (SAC), significantly decreased Kfs 

and available water, and may restrict root growth (i.e., higher SRP and VESS scores). Despite 

those changes, soil aggregate stability (AGS and MWD) was not affected by pasture 

establishment. Soil compaction and consequently physical degradation of pasturelands are 

well documented in the literature (e.g., GREENWOOD; McKENZIE, 2001; PIETOLA; 

HORN; YLI-HALLA, 2005; HUNKE et al., 2015).

Soil biological changes were also observed due to conversion from native vegetation 

to pasture. Most biological indicators showed site-specific responses, although MBC and 

MBN tended to be lower within pasture soils, especially at the Lat_17S and Lat_21S sites. 

Enzyme activities (BG and AcP) showed a decreasing trend under pasture at Lat_17S and 

Lat_23S, but increased significantly at Lat_21S. Variation in soil acidity, SOC, P availability, 

microbiological activity and other variables not assessed in this study, may be among the 



 175 

controlling factors affecting enzyme responses at the various sites. Pastures soils generally 

had a higher density of macrofauna than native vegetation sites, but the increase was 

dominated by a few taxonomic groups such termites (mainly at Lat_17S), ants, coleopterans 

and earthworms. Conversely, even though native vegetation samples had lower macrofauna 

populations, they had a higher richness and diversity of species. Our findings are consistent 

with others in the literature (BENITO et al., 2004; DECAENS et al., 2004), which generally 

state that macrofaunal community size in tropical soils tends to increase over time following 

conversion from native vegetation to pasture.  

 The LUC from pasture to sugarcane improved soil chemical quality. Liming and 

annual application of fertilizer (organic and/or mineral) reduced soil acidity and increased 

macronutrient availability. Short-term sugarcane establishment (&lt;5 years) had no negative 

impacts on SOC and TN content at Lat_17S and Lat_21S, but as reported by Mello et al. 

(2014) and Franco et al. (2015), SOC and TN were depleted after more than 20 years 

(Lat_23S) of sugarcane cultivation. Those decreases presumably are associated with the 

intensive tillage performed every five years (SILVA-OLAYA et al., 2013; MELLO et al., 

2014) and more than 10 years of pre-harvest burning, which has been shown to deplete SOC 

over time (CERRI et al., 2011).  

 Conversion from pasture to sugarcane also negatively impacted on soil physical 

indicators, primarily those related to soil structure, such as AGS, MWD, VESS and SSI. 

Although tillage in preparation for sugarcane replanting (Lat_17S) alleviated soil compaction 

(i.e., decreased BD and SRP; increased Kfs), our data suggest those positive effects have 

short-term persistence (i.e., primarily the first year, as reported by Centurion et al. (2007). 

Over the entire sugarcane cycle, intensive machinery traffic increases soil compaction again, 

leading to decreased of aeration, infiltration and water availability as observed at Lat_21S and 

Lat_23S. Short-term positive tillage effects on soil physical quality are most likely associated 

with SOC depletion, due to disruption of macroaggregates and exposure of physically and 

chemically protected C to microbial decomposition (SIX; ELLIOTT; PAUSTIAN, 2000), and 

the subsequent deleterious consequences on soil structure. In addition, several studies have 

shown that intensive machinery traffic in sugarcane fields has negative impacts on soil 

physical quality and often decreases sugarcane growth and yield (e.g., OTTO et al., 2011; 

SOUZA et al., 2014). Adverse impacts of current sugarcane management practices on soil 

physical and structural properties have also markedly increased soil loss and degradation by 

erosion when compared with native vegetation or pasture (WEILL; SPAROVEK, 2008), 



 176 

becoming one of major concern for a sustainable sugarcane production in Brazil 

(MARTINELLI; FILOSO, 2007).  

Overall, LUC from pasture to sugarcane also has negative implications on soil 

biological indicators. Depletions of soil biota in sugarcane fields can be associated with 

quantitative and qualitative decreases in SOC. Franco et al. (2015) reported that sugarcane 

production depletes C input from C3 plants (forest) which is preferable by microorganisms, 

and that new C from C4 plants (i.e., pasture and sugarcane) was insufficient to offset those 

losses. Furthermore, intensification of land use and management, that includes considerable 

mineral fertilizer and pesticides inputs as well as the modification or destruction of native 

biological habitats by tillage, and soil compaction can led to a reduction or simplification in 

soil diversity and its ecosystem functions in sugarcane fields, as reported by Wagg et al. 

(2014).  

 

7.3.2 Soil quality indexing 

 

The three SQ indicator selection approaches (Figure 1) provided different datasets for 

index calculations. The TDS (38 indicators) provided a wide range of soil indicators and 

theoretically should have resulted in a more accurate (sensitive) assessment of SQ, due to the 

very comprehensive evaluation involving chemical, physical and biological soil properties 

and their interactions. The primary limitations of the TDS approach are the high cost, greater 

amount of time required for sampling and laboratory analyses, redundancy of indicators, and 

more complex data interpretation (QI et al., 2009; LIMA et al., 2013; ASKARI; HOLDEN, 

2014). Using a PCA reduced the TDS to seven principal components (MDS-PCA) that 

explained approximately 90% of total variance (Figure 2 and Table 4). Only the indicator with 

highest loading factor within each PC was retained for the MDS-PCA, since the other highly 

weighted indicators were well-correlated (r&gt;0.85; p&lt;0.01) among themselves (Table 5). The 

seven selected indicators were: SOC, SAC, pH, Kfs, Mdiver, BG and Mdens. Selecting SQ 

indicators using PCA has some advantages and disadvantages. According to Andrews, Karlen 

and Mitchell (2002) or Mukherjee and Lal (2014) PCA provides a less subjective method of 

indicator selection, which can help avoid bias and data redundancy. On the other hand, the 

PCA method requires a large dataset and is less “user friendly,” thus imposing barriers to 

practical adoption for farm or regional scale SQ assessments. Furthermore, the selected 

indicators may not be meaningful for farmers and land managers (ANDREWS; KARLEN; 

MITCHELL, 2002).

The expert opinion approach reduced the TDS to five MDS-EO indicators (pH, P, K, 

VESS and SOC), with the first three being chemical indicators that are widely used to 

evaluate soil acidity and nutrient availability as well as to guide soil fertility management. As 

recommended by Doran and Parkin (1994), these indicators are desirable for SQ assessments 

because they are: easy to sample for, readily available in commercial laboratories at a low 

cost, and the results can be easily interpreted using pre-defined thresholds. The fourth 

indicator, VESS score, provides an integrative assessment of soil structural/physical quality 

through an easily-performed, low-cost, direct on-farm method (BALL; BATEY; 

MUNKHOLM, 2007; GUIMARÃES; BALL; TORMENA, 2011). VESS integrates soil 

properties related to size, strength and porosity of aggregates, roots and soil color into a single 

score, which ranges from 1 (good) to 5 (poor structural quality). The fifth indicator, SOC, is 

the most consistent indicator used for SQ assessments (ZORNOZA et al., 2015), because it 

influences multiple soil and ecosystem functions (LAL, 2004). Furthermore, SOC can be 

analyzed using the same sample collected for chemical indicators and it is routinely analyzed 

so most farmers have previous records for temporal comparisons. The MDS-EO approach was 

consistent with Andrews, Karlen and Cambardella (2004) and Karlen et al. (2008), who 

recommend that SQ assessments could be made using a minimum of five indicators provided 

there was at least one each representing soil chemical, physical and biological properties and 

processes. However, Andrews, Karlen and Mitchell (2002) did warn that expert opinion 

method does truly require expert knowledge of the entire system and may be subject to 

disciplinary biases. 

Soil quality indicators were individually scored (Equation 1 and 2) and then, 

integrated using six strategies (Figure 1). The SQI scores for native vegetation, pasture and 

sugarcane (0-30 cm depth) at each site are shown in Figure 4. Overall, all six SQI approaches 

were able to detect SQ changes induced by LUC. Soils from native vegetation sites had 

significantly greater SQI values, except at Lat_17S, where the soil was more weathered and 

consequently had very poor chemical quality (CHERUBIN et al., 2015). In general, LUC 

from native vegetation to pasture significantly decreased SQ, although the sensitivity among 

the SQ indexing strategies was slightly different. Conversion from pasture to sugarcane 

promoted site-specific SQ changes, leading to increases or decreases associated with inherent 

soil characteristics and historic of land use and management.

Soil Quality Index 

Lat_23S 



 182 

At Lat_17S, sugarcane cultivation increased SQ, primarily due to soil fertility 

improvement through lime and fertilizer applications. This was confirmed by SQIs calculated 

using strategies that gave greater weight to chemical indicators, such as SQI-4 and SQI-5. At 

Lat_21S, conversion from pasture to sugarcane had essentially no influence on overall SQ, 

except when SQI-5 was used for the evaluation. In contrast, at Lat_23S, SQI-1, SQI-3 and 

SQI-4 indicated that long-term sugarcane cultivation significantly decreased SQ likely due to 

significant SOM depletion (FRANCO et al., 2015). This in turn had negative implications on 

micro- and macro-faunal activity, cycling and availability of nutrients, and soil structure 

(Table 3). 

At the regional scale, SQ changes induced by LUC for sugarcane expansion were 

consistently detected by all six indexing strategies (Figure 5). In general, higher absolute SQI 

values were observed when using the TDS (SQI-1 and SQI-2) followed by the SQIs from 

MDS-EO (SQI-5 and SQI-6) and SQIs from MDS-PCA (SQI-3 and SQI-4). An identical 

sequence was verified by Lima et al. (2013). Native vegetation soils had the highest SQI 

scores, suggesting they are functioning at 56 to 78% of their potential capacity for the 0-30 

cm depth. These results support the hypothesis that natural ecosystems are more balanced, 

because chemical, physical and biological attributes act collectively, thus enabling soils to 

perform their functions properly. The SQIs indicated that long-term conversion from native 

vegetation to extensive pasture decreased SQ indexes by 15 to 23% (Figure 5), resulting in 

pasture soils that were functioning at between 44 to 66% of their potential capacity. Weighed 

indexes helped to clarify the reasons for overall SQ depletion within pasturelands. The SQI-2 

scores (i.e., TDS weighted by soil function framework) indicated that pasture soils had 

reduced soil functions associated with storage and provision of water, as well as soil aeration 

(-32%), soil capacity to sustain plant growth (-18%), biological activity (-30%), ability to 

resist degradation (-22%), and although not statistically significant, the capacity for storage, 

provision and cycling of nutrients (-6%) when compared to soils under native vegetation 

(Figure 6). The SQI-4, weighted by PCA loading, showed that SQ depletions in pasturelands 

were mainly associated with significant decreases of SOC and Kfs (Figure 7A). Using only 

five selected, but weighted soil indicators (SQI-6) detected that SQ depletion due to 

conversion from native vegetation to pasture was associated with significant decreases in soil 

chemical (-23%), physical (-17%) and biological sectors (-22%) (Figure 7B). This was in 

agreement with results obtained using SQI-2, which was the most complex strategy.

Our results effectively described the critical situation associated with most Brazilian 

pastureland. It is estimated that 70% of those areas are degraded or in the process of being 

degraded (DIAS-FILHO, 2014). Recently, a national-scale study verified that the current 

productivity (i.e., animal unit carrying capacity) of cultivated pasturelands is only 32-34% of 

their inherent potential (STRASSBURG et al., 2014). The low productivity of Brazilian 

pasturelands has multiple causes as reported by Strassburg et al. (2014). Among them are 

improper pasture management, including seedling failures and bare soil, continuous grazing, 

absence of liming, maintenance of soil fertility through fertilization, and uncontrolled erosion, 

which all lead to soil degradation over time (DIAS-FILHO, 2014; STRASSBURG et al., 

2014). 

At the regional scale, LUC from pasture to sugarcane showed no significant impact on 

overall SQ (Figure 5). The SQI scores suggest that sugarcane soils are functioning at 47 to

66% of their capacity. The SQI strategies showed sparse non-significant variations on SQ 

under sugarcane compared to pasture, ranging from -6% (SQI-3) to +13% (SQI-5). 

Respectively, SQI-3 and SQI-5 were the indexes that gave the lowest and the highest weight 

to chemical indicators. Therefore, improving soil fertility attenuated negative implications of 

sugarcane production on soil physical and biological indicators within overall SQ assessment. 

This was clearly demonstrated by weighted indexes (SQI-2, SQI-4 and SQI-6).

Conversion from pasture to sugarcane had one positive effect on soil functions – that 

related to nutrient dynamics. In contrast, significant adverse effects were observed in soil 

functions related to the capacities to sustain biological activity and resist to degradation 

(Figure 6). SQI-4 showed that under sugarcane only pH scores was improved, while SOC, BG

and Mdens scores decreased (Figure 7A). Finally, SQI-6 also was able to indicate that 

sugarcane production led to significant improvement on soil chemical indicators and decline 

on physical and biological indicators. Overall, these results indicate that sugarcane expansion 

over degraded pasturelands seems to be an opportune way to meet increasing domestic and 

global ethanol demands, avoiding direct competition for land with food crops and natural 

ecosystems, as reported by Goldemberg et al. (2014) and Strassburg et al. (2014). However, 

the results clearly indicated the necessity for improved management practices that can 

mitigate deleterious impacts of sugarcane production on soil physical/structural and biological 

indicators.  

 

7.3.3 What is the best indexing strategy for assessing sugarcane expansion impacts on soil 

quality? 

 

All six SQ indexing strategies were able to detect SQ changes induced by LUC, 

suggesting that any of them could be used for monitoring SQ in sugarcane expansion in Brazil 

(Figure 5). However, a sensitivity test showed there were slight differences among the 

strategies (Figure 8). The most complex strategy (SQI-2), which included the 38 indicator 

TDS and used weighting of the indicator scores provided by the soil function framework had 

greatest sensitivity to detect SQ changes due to LUC. In contrast, the least sensitive SQI was 

calculated using TDS without indicator weighting (SQI-1). These results suggest that using a 

meaningful method (e.g., soil functions) for weighting and integrating indicator scores into an 

index when a large dataset is available for SQ assessment is best, even though it is more 

complex than simple additive indexing and does not statistically modify the overall SQ 

assessment response (Figure 5).  

There also is no consensus in the literature regarding the benefits of indicator 

weighting. Andrews, Karlen and Mitchell (2002) and Askari and Holden (2014) concluded 

that weighting the additive SQI did not change the relative SQI rankings for the treatments; 

therefore, this extra step was unnecessary for analyzing vegetable production or other 

systems. Mukherjee and Lal (2014) also reported similar effectiveness between simple and 

weighted indexes. They highlighted that appropriate weighting on scores can predict SQ with 

higher performance which was consistent with our findings. On the other hand, Askari and 

Holden (2015) showed that a simple additive linear SQI was the most efficient for detecting 

management practice impacts in arable soils.  

 



 187 

 

 

Figure 8 - Sensitivity values of SQ indexing strategies used to assess the land-use change 

(native vegetation - pasture - sugarcane) impacts on soil quality in central-southern 

Brazil 

 

Both the MDS-PCA (SQI-3 and SQI-4) and MDS-EO (SQI-5 and SQI-6) strategies were 

effective for detecting SQ changes using a reduced number of indicators (Figure 8). Similar 

results were also reported by Andrews, Karlen and Mitchell (2002) and Lima et al. (2013), 

who both concluded that a reduced number of carefully chosen indicators could adequately 

provide the information needed for decision-making. From a practical perspective, this means 

that for any one indexing strategy to become the standard for research, large-scale SQ 

assessments, or to facilitate discussion and cooperation, it must be rapid, reliable, and 

economically feasible (QI et al., 2009). SQI-5 and SQI-6 strategies have an important 

advantage compared to SQI-3 and SQI-4, since the latter two require a large dataset in order 

to perform a PCA and select fewer indicators. Therefore, simple SQI strategies (SQI-5 and 

SQI-6), show excellent potential for monitoring SQ changes in sugarcane expansion areas in 

Brazil. More specifically, between SQI-5 and SQI-6, we suggest opting for SQI-6, which 

provides balanced weighting for chemical, physical and biological indicators. 

The SQ indexing strategies were significantly correlated among themselves (Figure 9), 

confirming a close relationship between simple and more complex strategies. This was also 

reported by Mukherjee and Lal (2014). Decreasing correlations between SQI-1 vs SQI-3 

(r=0.93), SQI-1 vs SQI-5 (r=0.78), SQI-2 vs SQI-4 (r=0.47), and SQI-2 vs SQI-6 (r=0.34) 

were observed. This indicates that as the indexes became simpler, correlations with more 

complex indexes that used the entire dataset were lower. However, despite lower correlations,

simple indexing strategies (e.g., SQI-5 and SQI-6) had the same statistical ability for ranking 

SQ responses due to LUC (Figure 5) as the more complex strategies.  

Simple additive indexes had greater correlations among themselves than weighted 

additives (Figure 9), because the simple ones were calculated using only a different number of 

indicators, while weighted indexes also varied the weighting approaches.

indexes (SQI) developed to assess the land-use change (native vegetation - pasture

 Higher correlations were verified between simple additive and weighted additive 

indexes when fewer indicators were selected (i.e., SQI-1 vs SQI-2, r=0.66; SQI-3 vs SQI-4, 

r=0.89; SQI-5 vs SQI-6, r=0.92). Figure 8 confirms there was a decreasing trend for 

sensitivity differences between simple and weighted indexes derived from the same sequence, 

as the comparisons moved from more complex to simpler strategies. 

 

7.4 Conclusions 

 

All six indexing strategies efficiently detected SQ changes due to LUC for sugarcane 

expansion in Brazilian tropical soils. Both, PCA and EO approaches were useful to reduce the 

total dataset without any significant interference on SQ ranking among land uses. These 

results indicate that simple, easily-performed and more user-friendly SQI strategies (e.g., SQI-

5 and SQI-6) were as effective and suitable for detecting LUC effects on SQ as more complex 

SQI strategies (e.g., SQI-1, SQI-2, SQI-3 and SQI-4). Although simple additive and weighted 

additive SQIs were statistically similar, we recommend using weighted indexes, especially 

when the number of indicators is unbalanced among chemical, physical and biological 

components. Therefore, a SQI strategy using a small number of carefully chosen soil 

indicators, such as pH, P, K, VESS and SOC, and proportional weighting for indicator scores 

within of each soil sector (chemical, physical and biological) could be adopted as a protocol 

for SQ assessments in Brazilian sugarcane areas.  

 Our findings also suggest that long-term LUC from native vegetation to extensive 

pasture depleted overall SQ, driven by decreases in chemical, physical and biological 

indicators. In contrast, conversion from pasture to sugarcane had no significant impact on 

overall SQ, primarily, because chemical improvements offset negative impacts on biological 

and physical indicators. Therefore, sugarcane expansion into degraded pastureland seems to 

be a sustainable strategy to meet increasing demands for biofuels. Nevertheless, management 

practices that alleviate soil physical and biological degradation under sugarcane production 

must be prioritized to avoid or minimize SQ depletions over time.

8 FINAL CONSIDERATIONS 

 

Global agreements to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions have raised the demand for 

low-carbon renewable fuels. Therefore, in recent decades the process of land-use change 

(LUC) has accelerated for expansion of bioenergy crops worldwide, and consequently has 

increased the pressure on soil and other natural resources. In Brazil, the world’s largest 

sugarcane-ethanol producer, sugarcane area has expanded by 35% last decade. Land-use 

change for sugarcane expansion has resulted in extensive pastures being subjected to intensive 

mechanization and large inputs of agrochemicals (i.e., lime, fertilizer and pesticides). This 

land-use intensification has direct implications on soil quality (SQ), a key component for 

ecosystem functioning and consequently a key indicator for assessing the environmental 

sustainability of biofuel production. For this thesis, we hypothesized that LUC to support 

sugarcane expansion leads to overall SQ degradation. In order to test this hypothesis we 

conducted a field-study in three sites in the central-southern region, to assess the SQ response 

to the primary LUC sequence (i.e., native vegetation to pasture to sugarcane) associated to 

sugarcane expansion in Brazil. 

The overall findings associated with this project show that: in chapter 2 we concluded 

that LUC promoted significant impacts on soil chemical attributes. Long-term conversion 

from native vegetation to extensive pasture led to soil acidification as well as significant SOC 

and macronutrient depletions due to continuous cattle grazing coupled with the absence of 

lime and fertilizer inputs over time. In contrast, conversion from pasture to sugarcane 

decreased soil acidity and increased macronutrient levels. Improvements in soil chemical 

quality were in direct response to sugarcane management including liming and nutrient 

replenishment using mineral and/or organic fertilizers. However, long-term (~20 years) 

sugarcane production resulted in significant SOC depletions (0-30 cm layer). In chapter 3, we 

investigated soil P dynamics due to LUC, since P is the most limiting essential plant growth 

nutrient in weathered Brazilian soils. We verified that conversion from native vegetation to 

extensive pasture led to a sharp depletion of soil P pools. Under sugarcane production, soil 

total P stocks were increased; but most of P added by fertilizer accumulated in less plant-

available P forms. This confirmed the important role organic P has in providing available P to 

plants in these soils. Furthermore, we found a direct correlation between diversity of soil 

macrofauna and labile P, confirming the crucial role of soil biota on nutrient cycling and other 

related ecosystem services.  



 198 

In chapter 4, our results showed that LUC had deleterious impacts on soil physical 

quality. Continuous cattle trampling associated to low productivity of pasture (i.e., lower C 

inputs in the soil) induced significant soil compaction, and created an unbalanced ratio 

between water- and air-filled pore spaces in the pasture soils. Intensive mechanization used 

for sugarcane production had a slight negative impact on soil physical properties compared to 

pasture land use. Tillage performed for sugarcane planting and replanting did alleviate some 

of the soil compaction associated with long-term pasture, but our data suggested the effects 

are short-term persistent, and that soil reconsolidation trends to occur over time. Furthermore, 

periodic tillage decreases soil resistance to erosion under sugarcane production. Overall, our 

findings suggest that native vegetation, pasture and sugarcane soils were physically 

functioning at 90%, 70% and from 56 to 68% their potential capacity, respectively. To 

identify a more user-friendly and cost-effective on-farm method for assessing soil physical 

changes due to sugarcane expansion, we tested the Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure 

(VESS) method that was discussed in chapter 5. Overall, the VESS was sensitive for 

detecting degradation in soil structural quality induced by LUC. In addition, VESS scores 

were well-correlated with quantitative soil physical attributes, confirming its utility as a 

potential tool that should be incorporated into protocols for on-farm assessments of SQ in 

Brazilian sugarcane production areas. 

To provide an overall assessment of SQ changes induced by LUC for sugarcane 

production in Brazil, the second step of this project focused on developing a SQ index (SQI) 

that integrated soil chemical, physical and biological
4
 indicators. We tested different 

approaches for evaluating SQ changes, since there is not a universal method for such 

assessments and this research topic is still relatively new in Brazil. In chapter 6, our initial use 

of the Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF), a tool developed and broadly used 

in the USA for assessing SQ changes under wide range of soils, land uses and cropping 

systems is discussed. The SMAF had never been used for Brazilian soils, so we worked to 

improve some of the scoring algorithms, thus allowing proper assignment of scores for the 

soil chemical, physical and biological indicators sampled under Brazilian tropical conditions. 

The results showed that the SMAF could be used as a reliable and efficient tool to detect SQ 

changes induced by LUC associated to sugarcane expansion in Brazil. Finnally, in chapter 7, 

we tested six approaches ranging from more complex to simple for developing a

comprehensible SQI. Our findings indicated that simple, easily-performed and more user-

friendly SQ indexing strategies (i.e., about five indicators selected by expert opinion and 

integrated through simple additive or weighted method) were as suitable for detecting LUC 

effects on soil as more complex strategies [i.e., using the total dataset (38 indicators) and 

complex weighting procedures based on soil functions]. Therefore, our recommended SQI 

strategy using a small number of carefully chosen soil indicators, such as pH, P, K, VESS and 

SOC, and proportional weighting for indicator scores within of each soil sector (chemical, 

physical and biological) could be adopted as an economically and technically efficient 

protocol for SQ assessments in Brazilian sugarcane areas. 

Overall, the SMAF and SQIs scores suggested that long-term conversion from native 

vegetation to extensive pasture depleted overall SQ, due to decreases in chemical, physical 

and biological indicators. On average the soil functioning decreased about 20% from native 

vegetation to pasture. In contrast, conversion from pasture to sugarcane had no additional 

negative impacts on overall SQ, mainly because chemical improvements offset negative 

impacts on biological and physical attributes. Therefore, the projected sugarcane expansion 

over degraded pastureland seems to be a sustainable strategy to meet increasing demands for 

biofuels. This suggests that our findings could be used as a scientific base by farmers, 

extension agents and public policy makers to adopt and develop management strategies that 

sustain proper soil fertility for sugarcane growth, increase C sequestration, alleviate soil 

physical and biological degradation for improving SQ and the sustainability of sugarcane 

production in Brazil.  

We encourage future studies to test and validate our protocol for assessing and 

monitoring SQ changes in sugarcane production under different soils and management 

practices. Furthermore, we suggest correlating SQ scores with other key-ecosystem endpoints, 

such as primary productivity, biodiversity, and water and air quality for better understanding 

the overall environmental sustainability of sugarcane production system.
