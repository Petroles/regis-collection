Tectonic history and the biogeography of the freshwater fishes from the

coastal drainages of eastern Brazil: an example of faunal evolution

associated with a divergent continental margin

Alexandre Cunha Ribeiro

The eastern Brazilian coastal drainages are of great biogeographical significance, because of their highly endemic fish faunas.
Phylogenetic patterns suggest a close biotic relationship between the rivers that flow into the Atlantic and those on the
adjacent upland crystalline shield. However, little has been said on the dynamics of the geological processes causally related
to the cladogenetic events between these areas. Distributional and phylogenetic patterns suggest a close association with the
geological history of the passive continental margin of South America, from the Cretaceous to the present day. In this area
megadome uplifts, rifting, vertical movements between rifted blocks and the erosive retreat of the South American eastern
continental margin are hypothesized as the main geological forces controlling the distribution of freshwater fishes. The
tectonic activity associated with the break-up of Gondwana and separation of South America and Africa formed six megadomes
that control most of the current courses of the main crystalline shield river basins. Except for basins located at the edges of
such megadomes, these river systems developed long, circuitous routes over the ancient Brazilian crystalline shield before
emptying into the recently opened Atlantic Ocean. Initial cladogenetic events between upland crystalline drainages and
Atlantic tributaries were probably associated with vicariant processes, and some ancient basal sister-groups of widespread
inclusive taxa are found in these coastal hydrographic systems. Later, generalized erosive denudation resulted in an isostatic
adjustment of the eastern margin of the platform. These, along with reactivations of ancient rifts led to vertical movements
between rifted blocks and gave rise, in southeastern Brazil, to taphrogenic (rift related) basins. These basins, such as the
Taubaté, São Paulo, Curitiba and Volta Redonda basins, among others, captured adjacent upland drainages and fauna. The
fossil fishes from the Tremembé Formation (Eocene-Oligocene of Taubaté Basin) exemplify this process. Other taphrogenic
systems of Tertiary age were also identified in other segments of the Atlantic continental margin, such as in Borborema
province, in NE Brazil, with marked influence over drainage patterns. At the same time, erosive retreat of the eastern margin of
the platform successively captured upland rivers, which became Atlantic tributaries evolving associated to main rift systems.
The continued nature of these processes explains the mixed phylogenetic and distributional patterns between Atlantic tribu-
taries and the upland crystalline shield areas, especially in the southeastern continental margin, represented by successively,
less inclusive sister-groups associated with cladogenetic events from the Late Cretaceous to the present.

As drenagens costeiras do leste do Brasil correspondem a áreas de grande significado biogeográfico, apresentando um alto
grau de endemismo em sua fauna de peixes. Padrões filogenéticos sugerem uma relação próxima entre os rios que correm para
o Atlântico a os adjacentes das terras altas do escudo cristalino. Entretanto, pouco tem sido dito sobre a dinâmica dos
processos geológicos relacionados aos eventos cladogenéticos entre estas áreas. Padrões de distribuição e filogenéticos
sugerem uma íntima associação com a história geológica da margem continental passiva da América do Sul, desde o Cretáceo
aos dias atuais. Soerguimentos macrodômicos, rifteamento, movimentos verticais entre blocos falhados e o recuo erosivo da
margem leste sul-americana são considerados como as principais forças geológicas atuando sobre a distribuição da ictiofauna
de água doce nestas áreas. A atividade tectônica associada à ruptura do Gondwana e separação da América do Sul e África
criou seis megadomos que são responsáveis por configurar a maior parte do atual curso das principais bacias hidrográficas do
escudo cristalino. Com exceção das bacias localizadas às margens de tais megadomos, estes rios desenvolveram longos e
sinuosos circuitos sobre o antigo escudo cristalino brasileiro antes de desaguarem no então recentemente aberto Oceano
Atlântico. Eventos cladogenéticos iniciais entre drenagens de terras altas do escudo cristalino e tributários do Atlântico
podem estar associados com processos vicariantes desta fase inicial, e alguns táxons antigos, basais, grupos-irmão de táxons

muito inclusivos e de ampla distribuição são encontrados nestas bacias hidrográficas. Mais tarde, a denudação erosiva
generalizada resultou em um ajuste isostático da margem leste da plataforma. Tal ajuste, concomitantemente a reativações de
antigas zonas de falha, resultou em movimentos verticais entre blocos falhados, dando origem, no sudeste do Brasil, a bacias
tafrogênicas. Tais bacias, como a de Taubaté, São Paulo, Curitiba e Volta Redonda, entre outras, capturaram drenagens e fauna
de terras altas adjacentes. Os peixes fósseis da Formação Tremembé (Eoceno-Oligoceno da Bacia de Taubaté) exemplificam
este processo. Outros sistemas tafrogênicos de idade Terciária foram também identificados em outros segmentos da margem
continental Atlântica, como na Província Borborema, no NE do Brasil, com marcada influência sobre o padrão de drenagem. Ao
mesmo tempo, o recuo erosivo da margem leste da plataforma capturou sucessivamente rios de planalto, os quais se tornaram
tributários atlânticos, evoluindo associados aos principais sistemas de falha. A natureza continuada destes processos explica
os padrões filogenéticos e de distribuição miscigenados entre os tributários atlânticos e as terras altas do escudo cristalino
adjacente, especialmente na margem sudeste do continente, representados por sucessivos, cada vez menos inclusivos,
grupos irmãos, associados a eventos cladogenéticos desde o final do Cretáceo ao presente.

Introduction

The Neotropical freshwater ichthyofauna is the most di-
versified in the world, with more than 4,000 described species
(Reis et al., 2003). The actual number of species, however,
could reach 8,000 according to recent estimates (Schaefer,
1998; Vari &amp;amp; Malabarba, 1998). The reasons for such a pro-
nounced diversity are likely to be both historical and ecologi-
cal – a result of millions of years of evolution from the break
up of Gondwana to the present.

The biogeography of the Neotropical ichthyofauna, how-
ever, is poorly known. According to Vari &amp;amp; Weitzman (1990),
three major factors limit the precision of hypotheses about
the historical biogeography of South American freshwater
fishes: 1) the poor state of knowledge of the species-level
systematics of most taxa; 2) inadequate distributional infor-
mation for most species, and; 3) sparse or non-existent data
on the phylogenetic history of most supraspecific taxa. An
additional reason can be added: 4) the difficulties in associat-
ing phylogenetic hypotheses and the known geological his-
tory of the continent. If biogeography is, as defined by Nelson
(1985), “the interrelationship, or synthesis, of geology and
biology”, the difficulties of biologists in understanding and
synthesizing geological processes constitute a serious limi-
tation to our knowledge of the biogeography of Neotropical
freshwater fishes.

Most of the information available on the biogeography of
Neotropical freshwater fishes comes from phylogenetic data
derived from revisionary studies of particular groups, in which
attempts were made to clarify relationships between areas of
endemism based on analyses of area cladogram (e.g. Vari,
1988; Schaefer, 1997; Reis, 1998; Vari &amp;amp; Harold, 2001; Costa,
2001). When available, geological inferences in these studies
were made based on major well understood geological events,
such as the uplift of the Andean cordilleras.

Recently, Lundberg et al. (1998) provided a detailed chro-
nological synthesis of the geological history of South America
written for ichthyologists in general. Their very useful contri-
bution focuses, however, on the uplift of the Andean cordil-
leras, major seaway transgressions along the slope of the
Andes along the western margin of the South American Plat-

form, and the paleodrainages of the northwest and northern
portions of the continent in the Guyana Shield and Amazon
basin. Few data were provided about the remaining areas of
the South American Platform, where large hydrographic ba-
sins, such as the Paraná-Paraguay, São Francisco and the
closely related Atlantic slope coastal rivers, drain the oldest
terrenes of the continent: the ancient Brazilian crystalline
shield.

The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the
principal aspects of geological history of the passive conti-
nental margin of eastern South America and explain the bio-
geographic history of the fish fauna from the Brazilian crys-
talline shield, focusing mainly on the coastal drainages of
eastern Brazil, with a special emphasis on the southeastern
continental margin. This area has an ancient biogeographic
component as exemplified by the occurrence of several groups
of fishes, which are phylogenetically basal to widespread
clades that underwent subsequent diversification in most
hydrographic basins in South America. These early cladoge-
netic events were associated with the initial stage of the geo-
morphological evolution of the eastern South American con-
tinental margin, involving tectonics and erosive process that
took place during and after the break up of Gondwana. These
processes are, to a degree, still active today.

Continental geological overview

The South American Platform (Fig. 1) is defined, as the
stable continental portion of the South American plate not
affected by the Caribbean and Andean orogenic zones
(Almeida et al., 2000). It is formed by the Brazilian Platform
and by the Patagonian Platform. The structural provinces of
the South American Platform are identified according to their
origin as the cratonic areas, ancient orogenic belts, and sedi-
mentary basins (Almeida et al., 1981), as indicated in Fig. 1.

Cratons represent the most stable region of the continent
composed of Precambrian rocks. During orogenic cycles, these
areas behave as rigid blocks, with mobile belts developing
around them. When eroded and exposed, cratons are called
shields (Penha, 1998). The South American Platform has the
following cratons: Amazonian, São Francisco, Rio de la Plata,
São Luiz, and Luiz Alves (Cordani et al., 2000) (Fig. 1).

The same mobile interactions between plates that occur
today also occurred during most of the geological history of
the earth, during which different portions of present day South
America were involved in the amalgamation and break-up of
several ancient super-continents during the so-called oro-
genic cycles, such as the Atlantida (Paleoproterozoic), Rodinia
(Mezoproterozoic), Western Gondwana (Neoproterozoic), and
Pangea (Carboniferous) supercontinents (Cordani et al., 2000;
Saenz et al., 2003). A result of this continental amalgamation
was the development of an orogenic or mobile belt. Most of
the ancient orogenic belts found in the South American Plat-
form are derived from three main sets of orogenic events: 1)
Trans-Amazonian (Paleoproterozoic); 2) late Mesoproterozoic
and; 3) Brasiliano/Pan African (Almeida et al., 2000). Most of
the orogenic structural provinces of the South American Plat-

form resulted from the Brasiliano/Pan African orogenic cycle,
when several cratonic nuclei (Amazonian, São Francisco, São
Luiz, Rio de la Plata, in South America and the West African,
Kongo and Kalahari in Africa) amalgamated in the Western
Gondwana continent between 750 and 530 Ma (Cordani et al.,
2000). As shown in Fig. 1, the ancient orogenic belts of the
South American Platform are the Borborema, Mantiqueira and
Tocantins provinces, and the Dom Feliciano belt. Today, the
metamorphic rocks present in these areas (meta-volcano-sedi-
mentary rocks) represent the roots of those eroded ancient
mountain chains of orogenic origin.

In the South American Platform, sedimentary basins
evolved in a different set of tectono-sedimentary domains, as
shown in Fig. 2. These are: 1) the continent’s interior, filled
primarily by Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary sequences,

but also by Cenozoic sequences; 2) the western, convergent
continental domain, the Andean chain, with its related sedi-
mentary basins; 3) the northern and southern margins of the
South American plate, where its contact and interacts with
the Caribbean and Scotia plates, and; 4) the eastern, diver-
gent continental margin of the continent that is derived from
the break-up of South America and Africa, where the sedi-
mentary sequence evolved in different sets of sedimentary
environments and tectonic phases since the Mesozoic (Milani
&amp;amp; Thomaz-Filho, 2000) (Fig. 2).

Associated with the main structural and tectonic sedi-
mentary provinces in the South American Platform are com-
plex systems of ancient faults, as well as widespread intru-
sive and extrusive volcanism. These are heritages of the con-
tinental amalgamation during the orogenic cycles together

with the rifting process related to the break-up of the precur-
sor super-continent in which the present day South America
was involved. Rifting and magmatism associated with the
break-up of Gondwana are found in most tectonic and sedi-
mentary provinces of the South American Platform (Thomaz-
Filho et al., 2000).

Tectonic evolution of the eastern margin of South America

The eastern margin of the South American Platform be-
longs to a kind of continental margin known as “Passive” or
“Atlantic-Style” margin. According to Moores &amp;amp; Twiss (1995),
in this kind of margin, the continental basement is more slen-
der toward the margin as a result of extensive faulting. In
some regions, fault-bounded basins (taphrogenic basins) of
continental deposits are present on top of the crystalline base-

ment. There are, in addition, flows of igneous rocks within
the upper stratigraphic levels of the rift valley sediments
(Moores &amp;amp; Twiss, 1995). According to Thomas (1995) and
Vitte (2001), there are six major tectonic features controlling
the long-term morphological evolution of passive margins: 1)
uplift controlled by the action of hot spots (thermal driven
uplift); 2) isostatic uplift due to denudation and unloading on
emerged areas; 3) thermally driven subsidence; 4) isostatic
subsidence due to sediment loading offshore; 5) rotation of
continental margin resulting from 4; and 6) escarpment ero-
sive retreat.

The tectonic processes responsible for imposing the “At-
lantic-Style” of the eastern margin of the South America Plat-
form are ancient, probably active since the Triassic, repre-
senting the initial phase of the break-up of Gondwana.

The chronology of the South American and African break-
up indicates distinct phases of magmatic activity related to a
rifting process (Thomaz-Filho et al., 2000). The first rifting
began on the Brazilian equatorial margin from French Guyana
to the Amazon delta in the Marajó basin between 230 and 170
million year ago, with two phases of a more pronounced mag-
matic activity (during Triassic and Jurassic times). Rifting

also took place during the Triassic, in the southern portion of
South America as deduced by the presence of significant rift-
related Triassic magmatic rocks in the marginal San Julian
and North Malvinas basins. Between 170 and 120 million years
ago, rifting took place along the Argentinean, Uruguayan
and Brazilian coasts reaching as far as Espírito Santo basin.
At the same time, the clockwise rotation of South America
resulted in wrenching between faults that were occurring on
the northeastern Brazilian equatorial margin (Thomaz-Filho
et al., 2000).

Beginning in the Triassic, the paleogeography of the At-
lantic continental margins of South America and Africa un-
derwent dramatic change due to a major tectonic event: the
Wealdenian Reactivation (Almeida, 1967; Cesero &amp;amp; Ponte,
1997) or South Atlantic Event (Schobbenhaus et al., 1984). In
the initial phase, between the Triassic and Jurassic period, a
single, large, longitudinally elongated basin (extending from
0 to 20ºS) the Afro-Brazilian Depression, arose due to the
rifting process (Da Rosa &amp;amp; Garcia, 2000). This basin captured
the adjacent drainages thereby giving rise to an intercon-
nected lake system, similar to that of present day eastern
African lakes. The Afro-Brazilian Depression continued to

Tectonics and the Biogeography of the ichthyofauna from the coastal drainages of Brazil230

evolve as a consequence of the processes of tectonic break-
up (Da Rosa &amp;amp; Garcia, 2000). It has been suggested that the
Afro-Brazilian Depression became divided into a set of smaller
basins during the rift phase, following the primary axes of
fault systems of the eastern Brazilian margin (for example, the
Souza, Igatú, Jatobá and Araripe basins, associated to the
Patos and Pernambuco fault lineaments, in the northeastern
Brazil) (Da Rosa &amp;amp; Garcia, 2000). As a consequence of the
reactivation, there also arose several new fault systems along
the coast and in the Brazilian interior, as well as the rise of
several rift basins. Examples of these basins are the Tacutu
and the Marajó graben, in northernmost Brazil, neighboring
Guiana, and in the Amazon delta, respectively; the complex
system of rift basins Recôncavo-Tucano-Jatobá, São Luiz
and Barreirinhas in northeastern Brazil, among others (Potter,
1997; Milani &amp;amp; Thomaz-Filho, 2000).

The African and the South American continents became
completely separated between 98 and 93 million years ago
(end of middle Cretaceous) (Cesero &amp;amp; Ponte, 1997). From that
period to the present continental drift has occurred between
these two continents, with peaks of magmatic activities in the
Eocene and Oligocene. In some cases, such activity was a
consequence of hot spots, such as that responsible for the
alignment between the Poços de Caldas/Cabo Frio continen-
tal alkaline rocks to the volcanic chain of Vitória/Trindade in
the offshore area of southeastern Brazil (Almeida et al., 1996;
Thomaz-Filho &amp;amp; Rodrigues, 1999; Thomaz-Filho et al., 2000).
Recently, an alternative nonplume related heat source for the
generation of intracontinental magmatic provinces has been
proposed to explain the occurrence of magmatic bodies in
South America (Ernesto et al., 2002).

Among the most important implications for the biogeog-
raphy of the aquatic continental biota resulting from the South
Atlantic event is the tectonically imposed paleodrainage of
the Brazilian crystalline shield. According to the model de-
scribed by Cox (1989), upper mantle plumes created an arched
deformation hundreds of kilometers in width during the initial
phase of rifting that imposed a characteristic drainage pat-
tern, with rivers running out from the center of the megadome
deformation. This process supposedly acted on several por-
tions of the continental margins of Africa and South America,
giving rise to six main magadomes (Potter, 1997). The drain-
age patterns created by these areas of uplift are still evident,
as shown in Fig. 3. Of all the major South American rivers, the
Paraná seems to have the most perfect fit to those structures
(Potter, 1997); however, this tectonic pattern is also evident
in the headwaters and mouth of the rio São Francisco (Fig. 3).
Other than those rivers that evolved along edge of these arched
deformations, the Mesozoic reactivation resulted in drainage
patterns in which the river systems developed long, circuitous
routes over the ancient Brazilian crystalline shield before dis-
charging into the recently opened Atlantic Ocean (Potter, 1997).

With the end of the reactivation and of the related com-
plete break-up of Gondwana, the history of independent South
American Atlantic rivers began. These rivers form a series of
isolated hydrographic basins known as the Coastal Drain-

ages of Eastern Brazil, with the primary hydrographic sys-
tems being the rios Paraguaçú, Contas, Jequitinhonha, Doce,
Paraíba do Sul, Ribeira de Iguape, Itajaí and Jacuí (Fig. 4).
These, along with several other smaller isolated basins, are
separated by the scarped, mountainous landscapes of the
eastern margin of the Brazilian crystalline shield.

Along the eastern coastal margin of South America, the
post-Cretaceous history of the southeastern segment of the
continent, in southeastern Brazil, is better understood. Ac-
cording to Cobbold et al. (2001), the obliquely rifted margin
of southeastern Brazil is characterized by a tectonic context
that contrasts with the traditional view in which the Atlantic
margin of Brazil is a passive margin. These authors interpret
the late Cretaceous and Cenozoic reactivation of older struc-
tures, attributing them to the combined effect of far-field stress
(related to the Andean uplift) and hot-spot activity (the
Trindade hot-spot). A large number of seismic events are re-
ported in southeastern Brazil related to neighbouring regions.
Patterns of topography and drainages provide evidence of
recent uplift, block faulting and river capture, all of which are
symptomatic of active tectonics. Inland, the crust of the re-
gion appears to be thicker than normal and decidedly thicker
than what is expected for a rifted margin, probably due to
Cenozoic shortening that originated from the action of conti-
nent-wide compressional stress. The lithosphere of south-
eastern Brazil is relatively weak relative to adjacent cratonic
areas, and weaknesses probably explain why this region is
seismically active and prone to deformations. Alkaline intru-
sions of Late Cretaceous-Paleogene age are relatively com-
mon and related to hot-spot activity or fault reactivation.
Onshore and offshore geological evidence leads to the con-
clusion that the margin of southeastern Brazil was reactivated
in three main phases and separated by quieter intervals that
coincide with the Peruvian (90-75 Ma), Incaic (50-40 Ma) and
Quechuan (25-0 Ma) phases of Andean orogeny, which oc-
curred during periods of relatively rapid convergence at the
Andean margin of South America. Also, the kinematics of
Cenozoic deformation in southeastern Brazil is compatible
with the changing directions of convergence at the Andean
margin, which was highly oblique in the Paleogene and much
less so in the Neogene (Cobbold et al., 2001).

Almeida &amp;amp; Carneiro (1998) provided geological evidence
that, at the end of the Cretaceous, the southeastern Brazilian
crystalline shield extended eastward into the present day in-
ner continental platform. The shield extended to the edge of
the Santos Basin, an offshore sedimentary basin now filled
with about 13,000 m of sediments, the oldest of which dates
back to the Late Cretaceous (100 Ma). This Late Cretaceous
sedimentary sequence of the Santos Basin is the counterpart
of the sequence of the same age found in the Baurú group
(Paraná Basin), and both represent the erosive denudation
cycle of the Brazilian crystalline shield that has taken place
along the eastern margin of the continent from that period to
the present (Fig. 5). The continental crust of southeastern
Brazil suffered a vertical denudation of about 3 km, exposing
deep metamorphic rocks of the ancient Ribeira and



A. C. Ribeiro 231

Mantiqueira orogenic belts (Gallagher et al., 1994). Accord-
ing to Almeida &amp;amp; Carneiro (1998), the reduction of weight as
a consequence of the erosive process in the crust, and its
increase in offshore basins, provided an uplift of the former
and lowering of the latter due to an isostatic adjustment. The
isostatic epirogenesis of the eastern margin of the South

American Platform also resulted in movements between rifted
blocks (reactivation of old rifts), and was the main reason for
the origin of several taphrogenic basins or grabens (basins
originating by the lowering of rifted blocks) such as that of
the “Serra do Mar Rift System,” which includes the Taubaté,
São Paulo, Resende, Volta Redonda, Curitiba, Sete Barras,

Tectonics and the Biogeography of the ichthyofauna from the coastal drainages of Brazil232

and Guanabara Depression basins (Almeida, 1976; Almeida
&amp;amp; Carneiro, 1998) (Fig. 6). These movements also led to verti-
cal movements recently reported for other areas, such as that
responsible of the origin of the Cananéia and the Barra de
São Joaquim grabens in the states of São Paulo and Rio de
Janeiro (Souza et al., 1996; Mohriak &amp;amp; Barros, 1990). How-
ever, according to Riccomini et al. (2004) these basins origi-
nated due to reactivations of the sub-parallel NE to E-W Pre-
cambrian shear zones, know as the Continental Rift of South-
eastern Brazil (CRSB). This tectonic feature initially named as
the “Serra do Mar Rift System” (Almeida, 1976) is now iden-
tified as one of the largest structural discontinuities of the
South American Platform, extending considerably beyond the
Serra do Mar itself. The CRSB is an elongate narrow trough,
over 900 km long, and roughly parallels the present-day coast
line of southeastern Brazil, reaching the Atlantic Ocean in the
northeast of the State of Rio de Janeiro (Riccomini et al.,
2004) (Figs. 6 and 7).

The evolutionary history of the CRSB was the focus of
several theories (Riccomini et al., 2004), along with the most
recent recognizes that the system evolved in response to an

combined effect of tectonic forces related to the spreading
rates in the Middle Atlantic Ridge (ridge-push); far-field com-
pressional stress related to the Andean orogeny (slab-pull);
the activity of the Trindade hot spot; isostatic adjustments
due to relief of height after extensive erosion of the ancient
Brazilian shield; effects of the subsidence of the adjoining
offshore Santos Basin; and oscillation of water pressures
over the continental platform related to sea level changes
during the Late Pleistocene (Almeida &amp;amp; Carneiro, 1998;
Riccomini &amp;amp; Assumpção, 1999; Cobbold et al., 2001; Riccomini
et al., 2004). According to recent models, during the Paleo-
gene reactivation of Precambrian shear zones as normal faults
was responsible for creating the original depression encom-
passing all the basins of the central to northeastern segment
of the rift. In the Neogene, probably during the Miocene,
reactivation of the rift was responsible for the first
deformational event. In the Late Pleistocene-Holocene, a sec-
ond deformational event took place; faults located at the edges
of the basin were reactivated and gave rise to structural highs
that configure the separation of the Paleogene sedimentary
record in different basins. A third deformational event in the
Holocene has been confirmed and there are evidences for the
action of a younger stress field active until the present-day
(Riccomini &amp;amp; Assumpção, 1999). These deformational pro-
cesses were basement-controlled, mostly resulting from re-
activation of Precambrian shear zones (Riccomini et al., 2004).

The escarpment erosive retreat was concomitant with the
tectonic deformations described above and these together
delimited the evolution of drainage patterns. Due to the break-
up of Gondwana, several old faults were reactivated in dis-
continued pulses from the end of the Cretaceous to the Ter-
tiary. The rocks of the reactivated faults, with their lesser
resistance to erosion, govern the plan of the drainage pattern
(Almeida &amp;amp; Carneiro, 1998). With the continued erosive re-
treat, various rivers of the upland crystalline shield were cap-
tured, primarily along rift systems, to become Atlantic Ocean
tributaries; a process that is still active in the present.

Tectonics and the Biogeography of the ichthyofauna from the coastal drainages of Brazil234

Platform predicts that the river systems associated with the
main fault systems which are more susceptible to erosion will
capture the headwaters of some crystalline shield tributaries.
At the same time, vertical movements between faulted blocks
gave rise to taphrogenic basins, which capture surrounding
headwaters, originating a complex hydrography, sometimes
represented by interconnected lake systems. Resistant areas,
such as the complex systems of intruded basalts and other
metamorphic rocks, sustain upland and become exposed in
steep scarps (Almeida &amp;amp; Carneiro, 1998). One of the most
outstanding examples of such a process is the erosive retreat
of the Ribeira de Iguape basin, which is responsible for carv-
ing a gap in the coastal Serra do Mar range, between São
Paulo and Paraná States. This resulted from the erosive re-
treat of this river system in the Lancinha-Cubatão rifted zone
(Almeida &amp;amp; Carneiro, 1998) (Fig. 6c).

The evolution of taphrogenic basins are of crucial impor-
tance for the hydrographic system established between the
end of the Cretaceous to the Tertiary. Once developed, these
basins were responsible for headwater captures between ad-
jacent upland hydrographic systems. In the case of the
Taubaté basin, the capture of an arm of the rio Tietê was
previously reported by Ab’Sáber (1957, 1998); however, this
was not the only paleohydrological consequence of that
taphrogenic event. The origin of the Taubaté Graben prob-
ably resulted in the capture of several other adjacent rivers,
such as headwaters of the rivers Tietê, Grande, São Fran-
cisco, and probably Doce. The strategic position of the
Taubaté Graben, in the core of the Mantiqueira-Angola re-
gional megadome, from where headwaters of all the quad-
rants originate (Fig. 3) (Ab’Sáber, 1998), suggests a much
more complicated hydrological history than is usually pro-
posed by some simplified biogeographic scenarios (see e.g.
Malabarba, 1998).

Tertiary taphrogenic system was also detected in north-
eastern Brazil, in the Borborema Province (Brito Neves et al.,
2004). Reactivations along ancient faults during Paleogene
times created a system of grabens and horsts, which are evi-
dent in present day landforms (the Cariatá and rio
Mamanguape grabens, respectively) and the adjacent upland
(the Boqueirão horst) in the State of Paraíba, NE Brazil (Fig.
8). This taphrogenic system imposes a tectonic control over
the local hydrography, capturing to the Cariatá Graben seg-
ments of the local drainages, and deviating the upper stretch
of the rio Paraíba from a N-S direction to its local E-W direc-
tion to the coast (Brito Neves et al., 2004). These more local
phenomena illustrate how tectonic activities control drainage
evolution in all scales along the eastern rifted continental
margin of the Brazilian Platform (Figs. 6-8).

According to Riccomini &amp;amp; Assumpção (1999), the con-
cept of Quaternary tectonic stability prevailed for most of the
Brazilian Platform and, because of this fact, investigation of
Quaternary tectonics in Brazil has began to develop only in
the last decade. The summary of Quaternary tectonics in Bra-
zil presented by these authors indicates the existence of Qua-
ternary, particularly Holocene, faulting in almost all Brazilian

geological provinces. Among these, the region of the Conti-
nental Rift of Southeastern Brazil underwent the most pro-
nounced and recent activities and reactivations of ancient
structural lines (faults and shear zones) and generation of
new faults (Riccomini &amp;amp; Assumpção, 1999). This Quaternary
tectonic activity causes, among other topographic changes,
recent drainage rearrangements caused by stream captures
(Modenesi-Guattieri et al., 2002). Saadi (1993) and Saadi et al.
(2002) interpret the Quaternary tectonics in Brazil as being
the result of reactivation along ancient crustal discontinuities
(Pre-Cambrian and Mesozoic rift and shear zones) that be-
have as weakness zones and are more prone to undergo de-
formations.

During the Pleistocene and Holocene the coast of South
America underwent marine transgressions due primarily to
climate changes and sea level fluctuations (Suguio et al.,
1985).

Distribution, phylogenetic patterns, and the biogeography

of the fish fauna from the Brazilian continental margin.

Distributional patterns

The ichthyofauna of the coastal drainages of eastern Bra-
zil is of great biogeographic significance. The main hydro-
graphic systems (Paraguaçú, Contas, Jequitinhonha, Doce,
Paraíba do Sul, Ribeira de Iguape, Itajaí and Jacuí) (Fig. 4), as
well as several other smaller adjacent drainages, demonstrate
a high degree of endemism. Of a total of 285 fish species
listed by Bizerril (1994) for these basins, 95% were consid-
ered endemic and with 23.4% of the genera endemic.

 Interesting biogeographic patterns are exhibited by the
freshwater ichthyofaunas on the Brazilian crystalline shield
and the Atlantic coastal drainages. Potentially informative
patterns are exhibited by deep phylogenetic lineages as well
as closely related species groups occurring in coastal drain-
ages and the adjacent upland crystalline shield rivers.

The phylogenetic scope of these patterns suggests that
cladogenetic events between coastal drainages and the up-
land crystalline shield are ongoing over long stretches of
time, and were in a sense repetitive, giving rise to similar
sister-group phylogenetic patterns, which occurred in differ-
ent time stages. These differences in the degree of inclusive-
ness between sister-groups probably reflect such sequence
of continuous vicariance. In general, species-level patterns
should be the most recent events whereas higher taxonomic
group patterns are older.

In some cases, the degree of inclusiveness involve taxa
which are the sister group of very large clades at familial or
subfamilial levels (herein termed Pattern A) (Fig. 9) or in other
cases, involving sister-group relationships between genera
(Pattern B) (Fig. 10). These patterns, along with the species-
level similarities between both areas (Pattern C) will be dis-
cussed separately. Unfortunately, due to the lack of phyloge-
netic information for many groups occurring in eastern Brazil,
the patterns hypothesized herein are not supported by nu-
merous examples, but these can be tested by future study.

Tectonics and the Biogeography of the ichthyofauna from the coastal drainages of Brazil236

Ancient events: Pattern A

Stiassny &amp;amp; Pinna (1994) noticed that taxa basal within
their lineages are often notably depauperate in number of
species when compared with their sister-groups, and fre-
quently have extremely restricted geographical distributions.
According to the same authors, this phenomenon is strik-
ingly prevalent among freshwater fishes. Some coastal drain-
ages of eastern Brazil are inhabited by taxa that are primary
examples of such fact (Stiassny &amp;amp; Pinna, 1994). This is desig-
nated herein as Pattern A.

Pattern A is exemplified by the Trichomycteridae catfishes
of the subfamilies Trichogeninae (genus Trichogenes) and
Copionodontinae (genera Glaphyropoma, and Copionodon).
These catfishes are endemic to the small Atlantic tributaries
between São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro (in the SE) and to the
rio Paraguaçu basin (NE Brazil), respectively. Trichogeninae
and Copionodontinae are probably sister-groups and together
constitute the sister-group of the remaining members of the
Trichomycteridae (Pinna, 1998) (Fig. 9a). The cladogenesis
separating Copionodontinae and Trichogeninae catfishes from
the remaining Trichomycteridae is, probably, of great antiq-
uity. Trichomycterids excluding Copionodontinae and
Trichogeninae underwent a long evolutionary history giving
rise to more than 200 described species arranged in more then
42 genera, with widespread Trans/Cis-andean distributional
ranges from Patagonia to Panama. Trichomycterids, in the
course of their long evolutionary history, evolved a wide-
range of extreme ecological and morphological specializations
including parasitic hematophagy (Pinna &amp;amp; Wosiacki, 2003).

The doradid genus Wertheimeria (Siluriformes:
Doradidae), endemic to the rio Jequitinhonha basin is, in turn,
the sister group of the remaining doradids (Higuchi, 1992;
Pinna, 1998) and was also mentioned by Stiassny &amp;amp; Pinna
(1994) as a primary example of a taxon basal to a much more
diverse sister group. This case is herein considered another
example of Pattern A (Fig. 9b). Similar to the example of
trichomycterids, doradids underwent a long evolutionary his-
tory in Trans/Cis-Andean South America excepting for the
Pacific Coast drainages, the Atlantic Coast south of rio de La
Plata, and west of the rio Magdalena (Sabaj &amp;amp; Ferraris, 2003).
Doradids, as a consequence of their long evolutionary his-
tory, evolved in a wide range of forms, from diminutive spe-
cies of 3.5 cm to larger forms of about 120 cm and 20 kg (Sabaj
&amp;amp; Ferraris, 2003).

The conclusion taken from Pattern A is that the Brazilian
eastern coastal rivers are still inhabited by reminiscent taxa of
an ancient biogeographic history. It is proposed herein a
Mesozoic (Cretaceous) age for the initial phase of diversifi-
cation of an endemic ichthyofauna inhabiting the Brazilian
coastal rivers that still occur today.

Intermediate history: Pattern B

This pattern is defined herein by sister-group relation-
ships between the endemic ichthyofauna of the Brazilian
coastal drainages and adjacent shield that includes interme-
diate degree of inclusiveness, in which, in some cases, both

sister-clades underwent some subsequent radiation. The taxo-
nomic resolution in these cases recognizes a phylogenetic
interrelationship at the level of genera.

An example of Pattern B is the genus Scleromystax
(Siluriformes: Callichthyidae: Aspidoradini), with four species
that are endemic to the coastal drainages between the states of
Espírito Santo and Santa Catarina (SE and S Brazil) which is the
sister group of the more diversified genus Aspidoras (Britto,
2003) encompassing 18 species, widespread in both upland
shield river and several coastal drainages (Reis, 2003) (Fig.
10a). A relatively antiquity for Callichthyidae is also corrobo-
rated by the fossil record. The unambiguous placement of the
Argentinean fossil Corydoras revelatus in the Corydoradinae
as confirmed by Britto (2003) indicates that the lineages lead-
ing to subfamily Corydoradinae occurred at least on the late
Paleocene, as proposed by Reis (1998). Considering that
Aspidoradini and Corydoradinae are sister-groups, this mini-
mum age can be applied to both groups.

Another example of Pattern B is the genus Lignobrycon,
with two known species, the extant L. myersi from rio do Braço
(a coastal river of Bahia, NE Brazil) and the extinct L. ligniticus
from the Tremembé formation (Oligocene-Early Miocene, São
Paulo State, SE Brazil). Lignobrycon is hypothesized to be
the sister group of the widespread Cis-Andean genus
Triportheus (Malabarba, 1998) (Fig. 10b). In this example, a
Tertiary minimum age based on the fossil record can also be
inferred for Lignobrycon, a modern endemic component of
the ichthyofauna of the Brazilian coastal drainages.

Armored catfishes of the Rhinelepis group (Armbruster,
1998) have similar phylogenetic and distributional patterns.
Pogonopoma wertheimeri, from the rio Mucurí and São
Mateus, and Pogonopoma parahybae, from the rio Paraíba
do Sul, are sister-groups. Both species are considered to be
the sister-group of P. obscurum, from the upper rio Uruguay
(Quevedo &amp;amp; Reis, 2002). The genus Pogonopoma, in turn, is
hypothesized to be the sister group of the genus Rhinelepis
(Armbruster, 1998; Quevedo &amp;amp; Reis, 2002), which occurs in
both Paraná and São Francisco basins in the crystalline shield,
in the coastal rio Paraíba do Sul, and in Northeastern Brazil,
but this latter occurrence was considered to be an introduc-
tion by Armbruster (1998) (Fig. 10c). Within Trichomycteridae
this pattern is also recognized. The genus Microcambeva,
with two species, M. barbata, described from the small coastal
rio São João in the State of Rio de Janeiro, and M. ribeirae

A. C. Ribeiro 237



Tectonics and the Biogeography of the ichthyofauna from the coastal drainages of Brazil238

(Costa et al., 2004), from the Ribeira de Iguape, both in south-
eastern Brazil. The genus Microcambeva was hypothesized
by Costa &amp;amp; Bockmann (1994) to be the sister-group of a more
inclusive clade: the monotypic genera Malacoglanis from río
Caquetá, Colombia plus Sarcoglanis, from the Amazonian rio
Negro basin (Fig. 10d).

Some other elements of the endemic fish fauna from the
coastal drainages of eastern Brazil can be also included in
Pattern B, but these groups underwent major diversification
in coastal drainages, while their sister-groups are found in
the Brazilian crystalline shield and are depauperate in number
of species. Primary examples in the Characidae are the mem-
bers of the subfamily Glandulocaudinae, tribe
Glandulocaudini. The species of the Mimagoniates are di-
versified (six species) and widespread along the coastal drain-
ages, but their sister-group, the genus Glandulocauda (two
species), which is primitive in several features, is endemic to
the crystalline shield of southeastern Brazil, from the upper
rio Tietê and upper rio Iguaçu (Weitzman et al., 1988;
Weitzman &amp;amp; Menezes, 1998). The sequential sister-group to
both genera is the monotypic genus Lophiobrycon, which is
also endemic to the southeastern crystalline shield, from the
middle rio Grande (Castro et al., 2003) (Fig. 10e).

Weitzman &amp;amp; Malabarba (1999), reviewing the genus
Spintherobolus (Characiformes: Cheirodontine), comment
that the distribution of this genus remains something of an
enigma. This genus, however, is a typical representative of
pattern B, with three species (S. broccae, S. leptoura, and S.
ankoseion) distributed along the coastal rivers between the

Baia de Guanabara in the State of Rio de Janeiro to the north-
ern coast of the State of Santa Catarina. These species form a
clade, which is the sister-group of S. papilliferus, known only
from the headwaters of the upland rio Tietê (Fig. 10f)
(Weitzman &amp;amp; Malabarba, 1998).

The degree of inclusiveness in this pattern is suggestive
of an intermediate stage between Pattern A and the following
pattern C, related to species-level similarities between both
areas. The occurrence, within representatives of Pattern B, of
dated fossil species corroborate that cladogenetic event within
this pattern probably occurred at least by the Tertiary.

The most recent interchanges: Pattern C

This pattern reflects the most recent vicariant events be-
tween the upland crystalline shield rivers and the adjacent
coastal drainages that lead to the recognition of shared spe-
cies between than, and in some cases, of truly hybrid zones.

Trichomycteridae. b) Catfishes of the family Doradidae. The degree of inclusiveness of this pattern suggests the most ancient
cladogenetic event that is still recognized in respect to the ichthyofauna of the Brazilian coastal rivers.

Tectonics and the Biogeography of the ichthyofauna from the coastal drainages of Brazil240

The frequency of shared species between the coastal
drainages and the upland adjacent Paraná and São Francisco
basins was estimated by Bizerril (1994) in 17 and 11%, respec-
tively. Since then, revisionary papers of several groups pro-
mote changes in these percentiles. Several species were re-
vealed to be “species complexes” whereas others were syn-
onymized. Examples taken from recent revisionary papers,
however, illustrate Pattern C.

In southern Brazil, several species are shared between
the isolated coastal drainages and the adjacent upland.
Lucinda (2005), showed that Cnesterodon decemmaculatus
(Cyprinodontiformes: Poeciliidae: Poeciliine) is widespread
in the lower rio Uruguay and Jacuí in the State of Rio Grande
do Sul, Brazil, río Negro and Salado in Argentina as well as in
small coastal drainages of Uruguay and Argentina.
Cnesterodon brevirostratus also occur in the upper rio Uru-
guay, rio Jacuí and other coastal drainages (Lucinda, 2005).
Similar distributional patters in the southernmost coast of
Brazil and neighboring areas were given by Silva (2004) who
described Bryconamericus patriciae and reported its occur-
rence in both upper Uruguay and the coastal rio Jacuí. Reis et
al. (1990), revising the armored catfishes of the genus
Hypostomus (Siluriformes: Loricariidae) from southern Brazil
demonstrate the same fact: Hypostomus commersonii and H.
aspilogaster occur in rio Uruguay, rio Jacuí and other tribu-
taries of the coastal laguna dos Patos system.

Also in southeastern Brazil, areas can be identified in which
Pattern C occurs: 1) the upper rio Tietê, and 2) the area includ-
ing the headwaters of the coastal rio Ribeira de Iguape and
the adjacent upland tributaries of the Paraná basin, the Iguaçu
and Paranapanema rivers. However, in these cases, the shared
components are taxa, otherwise, endemic to the coastal drain-
ages, in which they are somewhat widespread. This phenom-
enon suggests that the upper rio Tietê suffered a posterior
input of an ichythyofauna once found only in coastal rivers
where they were, prior to these cladogenetic events, endemic.
Langeani (1989) for the first time identified shared species
between the upper Tietê and adjacent coastal drainages. In
the case of the upper rio Tietê, the fish fauna includes several
species such as Hollandichthys multifasciatus,
Pseudocorynopoma heterandria, Hyphessobrycon
bifasciatus, Hyphessobrycon reticulatus, and Gymnotus
pantherinus (Langeani, 1989; Quevedo &amp;amp; Reis, 2002), other-
wise, only found in the coastal rivers. In the upper rio Iguaçu,
this phenomenon can be also identified by the presence of
Mimagoniates microleps. This species is otherwise, found
only in coastal drainages and the available phylogenetic in-
formation demonstrated that this species arose from a com-
mon ancentor that was endemic to the coastal rivers
(Weitzman et. al., 1988). Other typical representatives of the
ichthyofauna of the coastal drainages recently recorded in
the upper Iguaçu are Hyphessobrycon griemi, H. bifasciatus,
and H. reticulatus (Ingenito et al., 2004).

Some other elements of the upper rio Iguaçu fish fauna
are also reported in the neighboring Ribeira de Iguape and
Paranapanema rivers, such as Trichomycterus davisi

(Suluriformes: Trichomycteridae) (Ingenito et al., 2004) and
Hypostomus ancistroides (Suluriformes: Loricariidae) (Oy-
akawa et al., 2005). Bizerrill &amp;amp; Lima (2000) also mentioned that
Rhamdiopsis moreirai (Siluriformes: Heptapteridae) is shared
between the upper Ribeira de Iguape and Iguaçu.

In the northeastern margin of the Paraná basin, adjacent
to the upper rio São Francisco, Paraíba do Sul, and the adja-
cent coastal drainages south of the mouth of rio Doce, some
species also become widespread. This is the case of the spe-
cies of Piabina (Characiformes: Characidae). Piabina
argentea is widespread through the upper Paraná basin, São
Francisco, and in some coastal rivers of the Atlantic slope:
the Itapicurú, Paraíba do Sul, and Itapemirim river basins (Vari
&amp;amp; Harold, 2001). Piabina is hypothesized to be the sister-
group of Creagrutus, with Trans-Andean distribution. Re-
cently, the most basal species of Creagrutus was described
and it is endemic to the uppermost portions of the rio Paraná
in central Brazil (Ribeiro et al., 2004). The available phyloge-
netic hypothesis of Piabina and Creagrutus suggests that
the Brazilian crystalline shield, probably the Paraná basin, is
the place for the initial diversification of the group. This sug-
gests that Piabina argentea became widespread into coastal
rives secondarily.

In the northeastern portion of the Brazilian coast, the fau-
nal interchange between adjacent basins was also reported,
reflecting a mixed ichthyofauna. Rosa et al. (2004) concluded
that the ichthyofauna from the Caatinga semi-arid biome of
northeastern Brazil, encompassing portions of the São Fran-
cisco, Parnaíba and several other adjacent coastal rivers ba-
sins, are hybrid. These authors registered that some species
are widespread in two or more basins encompassed by the
Caatinga semi-arid vegetation biome. This is the case, for
example, of Triportheus signatus (Characiformes: Characidae),
Prochilodus brevis (Characiformes: Prochilodontidae), and
Cichlasoma orientale (Perciformes: Ciclidae) which are en-
demic to more than one basin encompassed by the Caatinga
semi-arid biome. This ichthyofauna is also composed of much
more widespread species, such as Parauchenipterus galeatus
(Siluriformes: Auchenipteridae) found in all basins encom-
passed by the Caatinga.

The concluding remarks regarding Pattern C is that the
faunal interchange between upland rivers and coastal drain-
ages and vice-versa occurred along the whole divergent con-
tinental margin of Brazil. Speciation, however, was not fol-
lowed by cladogenetic events of Pattern C, suggesting its
recent age relatively to the previously discussed patterns (A
and B). The relatively recent faunal interchange between iso-
lated hydrographic basins indicated by Pattern C needs an
explanative model, which will be proposed in the following
section.

Biogeographic history

Synchronization of biological and geological processes
is a primary tenet of historical biogeography. Two approaches
are possible for this: the study of pattern or processes in
evolution. Herein, synchronization is hypothesized to occur



A. C. Ribeiro 241

based on the “Pattern” approach. Repetitive distributional
and phylogenetic patterns, rather than previous knowledge
about speciation rates or other evolutionary processes, un-
derpin our interpretation of the biogeographic history.

The presence, in the coastal drainages of eastern Brazil,
of an ancient fish fauna which is the sister group of much
more inclusive, derived and widespread taxa (Pattern A),
supports the hypothesis that initial cladogenetic events
were related to the origin of the first drainages that flowed
into the Atlantic Ocean. These rivers were probably struc-
turally oriented by megadomes, together with drainages that
were structurally oriented by large faults and grabens. This
is the case with all of the Atlantic tributaries north of the
Mantiqueira-Angola and south of NE Brazil-Niger
megadomes, where complex fault systems were, in some
cases, responsible for the structure of the drainage pattern
(Saadi et al., 2002).

Pattern B suggests the continued faunal interchange be-
tween the upland crystalline shield and coastal rivers through-
out the Tertiary (Paleogene and Neogene). The continued
erosive retreat of the eastern margin of the platform, for ex-
ample in southeastern Brazil along the margins of the Serra
do Mar escarpments, was responsible for transferring addi-
tional ancestral stocks from upland to lowland river systems,
with such groups undergoing subsequent diversification in
both upland and coastal drainages. An example of this pro-
cess was the erosive opening of the Ribeira de Iguape basin
along the Pre-Cambrian shear zone that governs the plan of
this river. These generalized erosion were concomitant to the
reactivations of the ancient system of Pre-Cambrian and Me-
sozoic rifts present along the whole tectonic active Brazilian
continental margin.

Vertical movements between large rifted blocks resulting
from such reactivations were also of great importance in the

Tectonics and the Biogeography of the ichthyofauna from the coastal drainages of Brazil242

development of the present distribution patterns of the fish
fauna, which is especially evident in the rifted margin of south-
eastern Brazil. The Taubaté basin clearly exemplifies how the
capture of hydrographic systems by large grabens, captur-
ing not only headwaters but also larger rivers from adjacent
upland areas, is a significant factor in determining the distri-
bution patterns of the aquatic biota. The fossil fish fauna of
the Tremembé Formation contains representatives of the sur-
rounding basins, including some fishes typical of large rivers
such as the siluriform Steindachneridion (also found in the
Jequitinhonha, Doce, Paraíba do Sul and upper Uruguay river
systems), and exemplifies the degree of faunal exchange that
resulted from such tectonic phenomena. Unfortunately, the
Taubaté basin is the only basin of the taphrogenic system
encompassed by the Continental Rift of Southeastern Brazil
that is known to contain fossil fishes.

The geological mechanisms associated with Pattern C
takes us to the fascinating paradigms associated to the con-
cepts of Neotectonics. According to recent models, the wide-
spread system of rifts and other crustal discontinuities present
along the Atlantic divergent margin of South America act as
weakness zones more prone to tectonic activity and deforma-
tions (Saadi, 1993; Saadi et al., 2002). Several hydrological
anomalies are symptomatic of active tectonics (Moores &amp;amp;
Twiss, 2000), along which, for our aims, the most important
are stream captures (Cobbold et al., 2001). Stream capture or
piracy can operate basically in two different ways in tectonic
active areas. It can be a direct effect of tectonic stress, when
the streams suffer an abrupt deviation as a consequence of
the relative movement between rifted blocks. Alternatively, it
occurs by differential erosion, because deformation in the
landscape promote the adjustment of the drainage to new
base level, causing streams on lowered blocks, with a steeper
gradient and, consequently more energy, to extends its val-
ley headward due to erosion, eventually breaking down the
divide and capturing part or all of the drainage of adjacent
slower streams (Tarbuck &amp;amp; Lutgens, 2002). The continuity of
these processes was probably the cause of an intense faunal
input from the crystalline shield fauna into the coastal rivers
along the Tertiary and afterwards, as exemplified by Patterns
B and C.

With no exceptions, the above mentioned areas in which
Pattern C occurs have been identified as active tectonic ar-
eas, some of these with proven activity younger than 1.6 Ma
(Saadi et al., 2002) (Fig. 11). This is especially true for, at least,
two areas on the upland crystalline shield of southeastern
Brazil, which share a mixed fish fauna with the lowland coastal
drainages. These are: 1) the area including the headwaters of
the rio Ribeira de Iguape, Iguaçu and Paranapanema rivers,
and 2) the upper portion of the rio Tietê. Not surprisingly,
these regions correspond to areas with interesting geologi-
cal characteristics. In both cases, a complex system of fault
lineaments and rifted blocks imposed an especially acceler-
ated fluvial dynamism.

In the region of Paranapanema, Iguaçú and Ribeira de
Iguape headwaters, the most prominent geological feature is

the Ponta Grossa Arch. The arch consists of an uplift of the
crystalline basement along the southeastern portion of the
Paraná Basin (Petri &amp;amp; Fulfaro, 1983). The Ponta Grossa Arch
is easily visible on geological maps due to the westward cur-
vature of the southeastern Paraná Basin (Raposo, 1995) dis-
playing an intricate systems of deep faults and fractures. The
main faults of the Ponta Grossa Arch are those present in the
Guapiara, São Jerônimo-Curiúva and Rio Alonzo structural
fault lineaments (Raposo, 1995). This fault system was sup-
posed to be the main conduit of the immense Cretaceous flow
of lava over the Paraná Basin know as Serra Geral Formation,
which left a large system of dykes of intrusive magma showed
in Fig. 6a. Some authors have pointed out that the Ponta
Grossa Arch has a general tendency to uplift (Almeida &amp;amp;
Carneiro, 1998) and underwent tectonic activity during the
Cenozoic (Almeida &amp;amp; Carneiro, 1998; Souza &amp;amp; Souza, 2002).
The tectonic activity of the Ponta Grossa Arch could have
resulted in a particularly accelerated fluvial dynamism between
adjacent drainage systems, accelerating the faunal exchange
between them. In the Ponta Grossa Arch, faults control the
relief and the drainage patterns (Melo, 2002). Vertical move-
ments between faulted blocks and erosive evolution of rivers
along such rifts promote mixing between adjacent drainages,
and likely explain the faunal exchanges that occurred between
the coastal Ribeira de Iguape, and the uplands Iguaçu and
Paranapanema rivers.

Similar process might have occurred in the upper Tietê. In
its upper portion, this river drains the São Paulo Basin, which
was, apparently, an extension of the Taubaté Basin during the
initial phase of the taphrogenic event that originated both
basins (Ab’Sáber, 1998; Riccomini, 1989; Riccomini et al., 2004).
Disconnection of these basins was caused by subsequent
tectonic event in the tectonic history of the CRSB. The same
tectonic uplift could be responsible for sending back to the
upper Paraná Basin an aquatic biota that was once associ-
ated to lowland costal drainages during an intermediate tec-
tonic and erosive phase. In fact, the idea that southeastern
Brazil is a tectonically active area and prone to undergo de-
formations (Cobbold et al., 2001) is strongly supported by
these complex distributional patterns included in Pattern C.
The intense tectonic activity along the CRSB also explain
why the Paraná basin contributed more (in terms of ancestral
stocks) to the development of the coastal drainages fish fauna,
as mentioned by Bizerril (1994).

The same is true for the northeastern Brazil, in the
Borborema Province. That region is extensively transected
by such kind of structural discontinuities: Pre-Cambrian rifts
and shear zones as well as several branches of oceanic rift
zones that extends over the northeastern margin of the conti-
nent and are all prone do undergo deformations (Saadi, 1993)
(Fig. 11). The neotectonic behavior of the Borborema Prov-
ince should result in an accelerated fluvial dynamism between
adjacent drainages resulting in extensive faunal interchange.
The identification of such phenomenon in this region made
by Brito Neves et al. (2004) that resulted in the deviation of
the rio Paraíba in the Tertiary corroborates this idea.



A. C. Ribeiro 243

The tectonic control over the distributional pattern of the
ichthyofauna from the coastal drainages and adjacent up-
land rivers seems to be the rule. A more detailed view of this
process that will probably occur in the future should confirm
this idea and provide more detailed causal explanations for
other areas that become not exemplified or discussed herein.
It is intriguing that Pattern C is recurrent along the whole area
encompassed by the rifted eastern continental margin of South
America, suggesting a high degree of faunal interchange be-
tween adjacent basins.

The mixed nature of hydrografic basins was already no-
ticed by Costa (2001) who proposed that headwaters are typi-
cally areas of complex faunal interchange between adjacent
regions rather than repeating components of the faunal stocks
of a major unit represented by the basin as a whole, but no
explanatory model was provide for that fact. Figure 11a shows
that the same kind of structural discontinuities found along
the eastern margin of Brazil have a much more including ex-
tension. The same tectonic mechanisms allowing interchanges
between the Brazilian coastal rivers with neighboring drain-
ages probably also took place between basins located into
the continent interior at the crystalline shield. These inter-
changes caused by stream captures were supposedly to oc-
cur where divides are transected by crustal discontinuities,
such as Pre-Cambrian rifted and shear zones or extensions of
the oceanic rifted zones over the continents (Saadi, 1993).

The above arguments run counter to theories that pro-
pose that diversification of the fish fauna of the coastal drain-
ages of South America was exclusively related to sea level
changes during the Late Pleistocene (Weitzman et al., 1988).
That model hypothesized that, when the sea level was about
100 m lower than today, the fish fauna was able to become
more widespread. Following a rise in sea level, speciation
occurred within isolated river basins. This model, however,
does not explain the mechanism by which species from coastal
rivers, supposedly originated during the late Pleistocene,
could occur secondarily in upland rivers, such as the upper
Tietê and Iguaçu. The erosive retreat of the eastern margin of
southeastern Brazil can continuously introduce ancestral
stocks from upland rivers into coastal drainages, but not in
the opposite way. Only significant tectonic deformations are
able to send back to the upland, species typical to coastal
rivers found in the upper portion of the Tietê and Iguaçu
basins. If the explanation of pattern C is associated with tec-
tonic relationships, than the fish fauna involved had to have
evolved prior to the sea level changes of the Late Pleistocene,
a period when the South American Platform underwent no
expressive vertical movements between faulted blocks and
the present shape of the eastern continental margin was es-
tablished. The sea level changes of the Late Pleistocene can
explain the widespread distributional ranges of several taxa
only along the coastal drainages, but fails to explain the oc-
currence in upland basins of some species that arose from a
common ancestor that was endemic to the lowland coastal
rivers. The major tectonic influence on distribution patterns
and cladogenetic events between the eastern coastal drain-

ages and the upland crystalline shield predicts that they took
place during a much longer period of time, from the end of the
Cretaceous to the early Quaternary.
