ABSTRACT: The Mação-Penhascoso granite laccolith occurs in the SW border of the Centro-Iberian Zone 

near its boundary with Ossa Morena Zone. A U/Pb (ID-TIMS) age of “ca 483 Ma” was obtained from 

magmatic zircon of the main microgranite lithofacies. The Armorican Quartzite Formation (AQF) is bent 
by the intrusion and disconformably overlain by the Brejo Fundeiro Formation of Oretanian age. This 

suggests that the AQF, already compacted is of Tremadoc and Upper Cambrian age. We conclude that 

the AQF facies is diachronous between Upper Cambrian and Arenig from SW to NE across the Iberian 
Terranes; it was fed from a promontory of a stable and large Gondwana continent. 

 

KEYWORDS: Iberia, laccolith, stratigraphic and radiometric ages, diachronous. 

 
RESUMO: O lacólito granítico de Mação-Penhascoso ocorre no bordo SW da Zona Centro-Ibérica 

próximo da fronteira com a Zona de Ossa Morena. Uma idade U/Pb (ID-TIMS) de 483 Ma foi obtida em 

zircões magmáticos da sua litofácies microgranítica. A Formação do Quartzito Armoricano (FQA) é 
condicionada pela sua intrusão e discordantemente recoberta pela Formação do Brejo Fundeiro de 

idade Oretaniana. Isto sugere que a FQA, já compactada, é do Tremadociano ou do Câmbrico superior. 

Concluímos que as fácies da FQA são diacrónicas entre o Câmbrico superior e o Arenigiano de SW para 
NE no terreno Ibérico, tendo sido alimentadas a partir de um promontório do Continente Gondwana. 

 

PALAVRAS-CHAVE: Iberia, lacólito, idades estratigráficas e cronológicas, diacronia. 

 

1. INTRODUCTION 

The Mação-Penhascoso granitic laccolith belongs to a group of granitoid rocks occurring in 

the SW border of the Central-Iberian Zone (CIZ) and these are confined to a sub-parallel 

alignment to the boundary between the CIZ and Ossa Morena Zone (OMZ) oriented NW-SE. It 

is a pre-orogenic tabular granitic body with subvolcanic textures, which is located south of the 

Amêndoa-Carvoeiro sinform D3 (Romão, 2001). Its radiometric age has been intensively 

discussed since stratigraphic and structural observations seen in the field are not consistant with 

the previous Rb/Sr age determination which was 402±15 Ma (Abranches &amp;amp; Canilho, 1981/82). 

We intend to solve the mentioned contradiction by presenting a new U-Pb zircon (ID-TIMS) 

age for the Mação-Penhascoso granitic laccolith followed by a discussion of its implications for 

the lithostratigraphic sequence of Iberian Terrane (Dias et al., 2006). 
 

2. GEOLOGICAL SETTING 

The Mação-Penhascoso granitic laccolith has a half-ring shape with two elongated edges in 

the NW-SE direction: the Penhascoso the SW side (1,5 - 2km wide) and the Mação village 

segment in the SE side (1 - 1,5 km wide). 

This laccolith, whose thickness is above 80m, underlies with the synclinal section of the 

metasediments that compose the Palaeozoic sedimentary succession. An intrusion in the 

lithologies of the units that belong to Grupo das Beiras (GB) and Grupo de Vale do Grou (GVG)

can be seen throughout its lower limit. At the top, the granitic laccolith intrudes quartzite and 

conglomerate beds of the Quartzite Armorican Formation (QAF) and presents an erosive contact 

with the Brejo Fundeiro Formation (FBF). The granitic laccolith can be seen, at macroscopic or 

mesoscopic scale, invading the first beds of the base QAF (sub-horizontal dip and direction is 

N20º-30ºW), in the eastern margin of the Coadouro riverside, in Casal da Barba Pouca. Also in 

this region, an approximately circular granitic apophysis, 10-20 cm in diameter, defines a small 

intrusion into the first quartzite beds which are positioned immediately above the granite. At the 

border of the granitic apophysis the granularity slightly decreases which is a chilled margin, 1-2 

mm thick forming a halo of iron oxides. 

The actual geometry of the Mação-Penascoso granitic laccolith is a result of the phases of the 

Variscan orogeny. The D1 Variscan folds affect the Palaeozoic lithostratigraphic units that occur 

in this region, including the laccolith, producing a syncline named Domingos da Vila-Casalinho. 

This structure presents a fracture cleavage subparalel to its axial plane with an orientation of 

N60º-70ºW that affects the Mação-Penascoso granitic laccolith. Also, in Monte de João Dias (W 

of Mação), folds with axes oriented N10ºW are associated with the D2 Variscan refolded the 

laccolith. These folds have an axial planar cleavage marked by micaceous minerals and cut by a 

N-S dextral shear zone. 

Distinct lithofacies have been mapped in the Mação-Penhascoso granitic laccolith: 

microgranite, rhyolite and eruptive breccias. The main lithofacies is composed of microgranite 

that lies in the central part and in the southern border of the laccolith. The remaining and smaller 

lithofacies are positioned along its northern margin. 

The microgranites, which are thin to very thin, are mesocratic and porphyritic rocks, with 

inclusions of the presence of dark green phyllitic restites, usually connected to phyllitic minerals. 

They have a holocrystalline texture with rich in K feldspar crystals, macroscopic blue quartz, 

oligloclase and biotite over 5mm, in an essentially quartzo- feldspathic thin matrix. Other less 

important minerals include: garnet, zircon, apatite, sphene-leucoxene, chlorite, calcite, sericite, 

rutile and opaque minerals. The rhyolites are leucocratic rocks with textures ranging from 

holocrystalline to hypocrystalline, with aphanitic matrix micro-cryptocrystalline. They differ 

from the microgranites essentially due to the fine-grained matrix and the rarity of phenocrysts. 

The eruptives breccias, located in the base of the laccolit h footwall, are composed of a matrix 

with rhyolitic nature in which are cemented and dispersed numerous elements from country 

rocks over 40-50 cm. The most common lithological elements are the pelite and the greywacke 

from GB. Less frequent fragments are granite (Belver) and microgranite, generally poorly 

calibrated and with granolumetric heterogeneity. The xenoliths lack a preferred orientation, but 

they occur with rounded shapes, and frequently flattened. On the other hand, greywacke and 

pelitic xenoliths, mostly laminated, occasionally present reaction edges where a slight 

recrystallization with a development of mica, quartz and eventually manganese (?) can be 

observed. 

The absence of meaningful thermometamorphic effects in Paleozoic lithologies that outcrop 

around the Mação-Penhascoso granitic laccolith suggests that this body is the result of relatively 

shallow magmatic intrusions. This intrusion rose and cut the GB and GVG metasediments, 

extending laterally along the surface of discontinuity, located between the strata of the GVG and 

QAF units, invading the latter slightly. Moreover, when the Variscan deformation is removed the 

body of Mação-Penhascoso granitic corresponds to a mushroom-shape, injected between almost 

concordant layers on the laccolith margins. 

The evolutionary model for the emplacement of the granite laccolith is described below. It 

begins with the deposition of the GB turbidite metasediments, which will overlap discordantly 

delta deposits of the GVG and the basal lithologies characteristic of the coastal environment of 

the QAF. Subsequently, there is the intrusion of laccolith, forcing its way between slightly

inclined strata of the GVG and sub-horizontal layers of FQA. This generates a mushroom-shaped 

a granitic body with the strata above the intrusion arch and rise, which may eventually emerge. 

This uplift consists of poorly consolidated strata, composed by conglomerates and quartz-

sandstone of the QAF, which are rapidly eroded by marine erosion. This erosion is evidenced by the 

differences in thickness in the QAF: near the laccolith the thickness is small (0-15 m) and in areas 

adjacent to the laccolith it reaches values of about 40-50m. Products resulting from erosion are 

resedimented, originating thin arkosic and conglomeratic horizons of low thickness between the 

eroded top of the QAF and pelitic unit (BFF) resulting from the subsequent resumption of 

sedimentation. In places where the QAF has been completely eroded, the BFF was deposited 

overlying directly on the granitic laccolith Mação-Penhascoso, for example in the Ribeira de 

Mação. This event would have occurred after the deposition of QAF and before the sedimentation 

of the pelitic BFF and it is conditioned by the structure of the pre-existing rocks. 

 

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Abranches &amp;amp; Canilho (1981/82) determined the 402±15 Ma absolute age (using Rb/Sr method) 

for the Mação-Penhascoso granitic laccolith, from 6 whole rock samples. These define an 

isochrones with an initial ratio 
87

Sr/
86

Sr = 0.7140±0.0020(25) and MSWD=0.74. However, field 

data do not support this age since the laccolith intrudes during QAF deposition and before BFF 

deposition in Oretanian times. 

As an attempt to resolve this incongruence, a sample of the microgranitic lithofacies collected 

from the left margin of the river Coadouro (geographical coordinates N39º 32´ 38´´; W29º 01` 

21``), was selected for geochronological studies. The zircons were separated from fresh rock 

samples using standard techniques of heavy minerals separation. The final selection of the zircon 

grains was performed first using binocular microscope and then by cathodoluminescence. 

The result of the U-Pb (ID-TIMS) analysis of prismatic zircon from the microgranite of the 

Mação-Penhascoso laccolith, was an age of “ca 483 Ma” (base of Tremadoc in accordance with the 

new chronostratigraphic classification of the Ordovician System, Bergstrom et al., 2009). Since 

the laccolith intruded the QAF, this unit would already have some thickness and be compacted, 

which means that the deposition is prior to “ca 483 Ma” (Tremadoc and Upper Cambrian). 

In the base of the first beds of the QAF the ichnofossils species Cruziana cf. ománica and 

Cruziana? barbatarugosa were identified. These Cruzianas have been described from Upper 

Cambrian (Seilacher, 2007). 

As the QAF is slightly discordant on the GVG transgressive deltaic succession (Romão et al., 

2005), it is expected that the deposition of this group has happened in the Upper Cambrian. 

There is a high angle unconformity between the BG metasediments and the GVG and QAF 

successions, embodied by a major sedimentary hiatus, erosion and/or deposition over a 

considerable period of time, a consequence of the “Sardic s.l.” phase with minor upper stage 

disconformities (QAF/GVG) and a major lower (GVG/GB). 

The present data should be considered in the context of age correlations, stratigraphical and 

geochronological, of the SW Europe Variscides (Iberia and Armorica). In Spain, the GB 

equivalent units have been dated as Lower Cambrian to terminal Ediacaran from in trilobites, 

Cloudine and icnofossils (Jensen et al., 2007; Cortijo et al., 2010). So, we infer that to consider 

that the “Sardic s.l.” phase is intra-Cambrian (base of the Upper Cambrian to Middle Cambrian?) 

in the SW border of the CIZ. 

Zircons from an altered ash-fall tuff bed within the upper Barrios Formation (Ordovician 

Armorican Quartzite facies), in the Cantabrian Zone of the Iberian Variscan belt were dated. U-

Pb analyses of six highly abraded single grains yielded concordant and overlapping error ellipses 

with a pooled concordia age of 477.47 ± 0.93 Ma (Gutiérrez-Alonso et al., 2009). The GVG 

lithologies can be correlated with the Cap de la Chévre Formation, Crozon Peninsula, and 

“Inicial Red Beds”, in central Brittany, including the French Armorican Massif. The first unit has

volcaniclastic strata, which have been dated to 465±1Ma (Darriwilian) by method U/Pb zircon 

(Bonjour et al., 1988), and the second unit contains, interstratified, trachytic and andesitic lavas 

have been dated by 472 ± 5Ma (Floian) by the Rb/Sr whole rock method. These data suggest that 

these units were deposited during the Ordovician. 

We conclude that the Armorican quartzite lithofacies are possibly diachronous. In the Iberian 

traverse the QAF is younger from SW to NE. In the OMZ, the quartzite lithofacies is possibly 

Upper Cambrian, below the Floian Barrancos Formation represented by pelites of deeper 

lithofacies than the quartzite lithofacies and above an unconformity on Middle Cambrian 

sequences (Araújo et al., 2006). In the SW segment of CIZ, where the Mação studied area is 

situated, the QAF is Upper Cambrian to Tremadoc according to the new isotopic data presented 

in this paper. In the NE segment of the CIZ the AQF is considered Floian because of the 

conglomeratic and impure quartzite unit (Bojas Formation) below were found inarticulate 

brachiopods whose first record is located in the Tremadoc and occur in large numbers in the 

Floian (Coke &amp;amp; Gutiérrez-Marco, 1995). The AQF lithofacies in the WALZ have been dated in 

most of the Arenig (Vera et al., 2004). 

The diachronic age of QAF is consistent with a foreland to the NE, in the basement of the 

Cantabrian Zone. This corresponds to a promontory of Gondwana that can feed mature sands to 

the Cambro-Ordovician siliciclastic platform from a passive margin of a large continent such as 

Gondwana. This paleogeography could be extended to adjacent areas of Armorica fed from 

southern Gondwana continent before the opening of Paleotethys Ocean. The synchronous 

deposition of shallow water would require a very rapid sedimentation rate which is not 

compatible with a stable and quiet sedimentary environment; alternatively a stable large 

continent such as Gondwana could feed with mature sands its shallow water passive margin for a 

long period of time.
