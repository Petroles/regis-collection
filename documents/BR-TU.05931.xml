O principal objetivo deste trabalho e? prever a evoluc?a?o de margens divergentes desde

o in??cio da extensa?o litosfe?rica, levando-se em considerac?a?o a interac?a?o entre processos

superficiais e tecto?nicos. Para isto, foi desenvolvido um modelo nume?rico que acopla isos-

tasia flexural, efeitos te?rmicos, estiramento litosfe?rico e processos superficiais. A isostasia

flexural e? simulada atrave?s de uma placa ela?stica fina sobre um fluido inv??scido, repre-

sentando o comportamento flexural da litosfera flutuando sobre a astenosfera. Durante a

simulac?a?o, a estrutura te?rmica da litosfera evolui como um resultado da advecc?a?o e difusa?o

do calor no interior da Terra. Considera-se que o estiramento da litosfera e? acomodado

por falhas planas na crosta superior e deformac?a?o du?ctil na crosta inferior e manto. O

modelo de processos superficiais descreve como a paisagem e? erodida e como os sedimentos

sa?o transportados e depositados nas bacias sedimentares. Atrave?s desse modelo nume?rico,

e? mostrado que o estiramento litosfe?rico tem uma profunda influe?ncia na evoluc?a?o da mi-

grac?a?o de escarpas em margens divergentes. Os resultados sugerem que escarpas limitadas

por falhas criadas em flancos de rifts por descarregamento meca?nico e resposta flexural

te?m pouca chance de “sobreviver” atrave?s de recuo erosivo se a crosta inferior sob o flanco

do rift foi substancialmente estirada. Nessa configurac?a?o, o divisor de drenagem que per-

siste atrave?s do tempo e? criado em direc?a?o ao continente em uma posic?a?o que depende

da rigidez flexural da crosta superior. Esse cena?rio ocorre quando a topografia pre?-rift



mergulha para o continente, caso contra?rio a evoluc?a?o da escarpa e? guiada pelo divisor

de a?guas interior pre?-existente. Esses conceitos sa?o aplicados no estudo das margens do

sudeste da Australia e do sudeste do Brasil, onde o cena?rio de retrac?a?o de escarpas atrave?s

de recuo erosivo mostrou-se improva?vel. O mesmo modelo nume?rico foi utilizado para

estudar como a passagem de uma anomalia te?rmica sob a litosfera pode afetar a evoluc?a?o

po?s-rift de bacias sedimentares em margens divergentes. Os resultados nume?ricos mostram

que a velocidade da litosfera em relac?a?o a? anomalia te?rmica e a rigidez flexural da litosfera

ocea?nica e continental afetam a evoluc?a?o de bacias sedimentares devido ao soerguimento

da superf??cie relacionado com a expansa?o te?rmica da litosfera. Como exemplo, e? estudada

a poss??vel influe?ncia de uma anomalia te?rmica (Pluma de Trindade?) na evoluc?a?o das

bacias de Campos e Esp??rito Santo, na margem sudeste brasileira.

Abstract

SACEK, V. Joint numerical modeling of sedimentary and tectonic processes

in sedimentary basins 2011. 184pp. Thesis (Doctorate) - Instituto de Astronomia,

Geof??sica e Cie?ncias Atmosfe?ricas, Universidade de Sa?o Paulo, Sa?o Paulo, 2011.

The purpose of this work is to predict the evolution of divergent margins since the

onset of lithospheric extension, taking into account the interaction between surface and

tectonic processes. For this, a numerical model was developed to study the coupling of

flexural isostasy, thermal effects, stretching of the lithosphere and surface processes. The

flexural isostasy is simulated through a thin elastic plate overlying an inviscid fluid, re-

presenting the flexural behavior of the lithosphere floating on the asthenosphere. During

the simulation, the thermal structure of the lithosphere evolves as a result of advection

and diffusion of heat in the Earth’s interior. The stretching of the lithosphere is assumed

to be accommodated by planar faults in the upper crust and ductile flow in the lower

crust and mantle. The surface processes model describes how the landscape is eroded and

how the sediments are transported and deposited in the sedimentary basins. The results

from this numerical model show that the amount of lithospheric stretching has a profound

influence on the evolution of escarpment migration in divergent margins. These results

suggest that fault-bounded escarpments created at rift flanks by mechanical unloading

and flexural rebound have little potential to “survive” as retreating escarpments if the

lower crust under the rift flank is substantially stretched. In this configuration, a drainage

divide that persists through time is created landward in a position that depends on the

flexural rigidity of the upper crust. This scenario occurs when the pre-rift topography

dips landward, otherwise the evolution of the escarpment is guided by the pre-existing



inland drainage divide. These concepts are applied to study the margins of Southeastern

Australia and Southeastern Brazil, where the retreating escarpment scenario showed to be

unlikely. The same numerical model is used to study how the passage of a thermal anomaly

under the lithosphere can affect the post-rift evolution of sedimentary basins in divergent

margins. The numerical results show that the velocity of the lithosphere relative to the

thermal anomaly and the flexural rigidity of the continental and oceanic lithospheres affect

the evolution of sedimentary basins due to surface uplift related to thermal expansion of

the lithosphere. As an example, the model is applied to assess the possible influence of a

thermal anomaly (Trindade Plume?) on the evolution of the Campos and Esp??rito Santo

Basins, in Southeastern Brazilian margin.

Keywords: Surface processes, tectonic processes, numerical modeling, divergent mar-

gins.

Introduction

Everything is simple, neat, and expressible in terms of everyday

mathematics, either partial differential or ordinary differential equations.

Everything is simple and neat — except, of course, the world.

1.1 Surface and tectonic processes: a complex system

The Earth’s surface is shaped by different processes that act in different time and space

scales and evolves through the combined effect of tectonic movements and surface proces-

ses. While tectonic movements modify the topography as a result of the Earth’s interior

dynamics, the surface processes sculpt the landscape through erosion and deposition, re-

sulting in horizontal remobilization of material. These surface processes are dependent on,

e.g., the climatic conditions, local relief and lithological controls.

On the other hand, the evolution of the Earth’s surface also affects the interior of the

Earth. For example, the primary direct influence of surface processes on the lithosphere

is the isostatic effect due to erosion of continents and deposition of sediments in the sedi-

mentary basins. These processes related to (un)loading at the surface can result in many

kilometers of vertical lithospheric displacement (Reiners and Brandon, 2006).

Therefore, the surface and the interior of the Earth must be seen as a coupled system,

each one modifying the evolution of the other (Figure 1.1). In this sense, the coupling of

surface and tectonic processes represents a complex system (Bar-Yam, 1997). A complex

system can be defined as a system composed of interconnected components that interact

with each other and, eventually, the combination of these components can manifest pro-

basins. Conversely, the fact that the continents have a higher average elevation than the ocean basins reflects both the
lower density of continental lithosphere and its greater thickness. One of the key issues in understanding the long-term
landscape evolution of high-elevation continental areas, and particularly the persistence of such areas, is generating
the lithospheric thickening that underpins or supports such high elevations. In effect, the issue is generating the
horizontal and vertical fluxes of rock required to produce high elevations and to sustain them, and the elegance of
plate tectonics in supplying these mass fluxes of lithosphere is one of the fundamental reasons that plate tectonics
re-vivified long-term landscape evolution studies. It is also important to note that the lithosphere has strength and will
bend and flex when a load is applied, including when a negative load is applied as a result of denudation. This flexure
of the lithosphere in response to a load is termed flexural isostasy, and the strength of the lithosphere (or its flexural
rigidity) determines the lateral extent (or horizontal distance) over which the loading has an effect.

Denudational isostatic rebound, the notion that the lithosphere floats up in response to denudational unloading, is
generally a central part of all modern interpretations of long-term landscape evolution. For areas in isostatic equilib-
rium, denudational isostasy means that, for every metre that is removed from the Earth’s surface by denudation, the
Earth’s surface is uplifted by about 0·8 m (0·8 being the approximate ratio of the densities of the crust and sub-
lithospheric mantle). The importance of such denudational isostasy in maintaining relief had been realized by the
1830s, and the notion was applied sporadically throughout the 20th century to suggest that mountain peaks may be
uplifted isostatically as a result of the unloading caused by the incision by major rivers flowing between the mountain
peaks (e.g., Jeffreys, 1931; Wager, 1937; for more detail see Bishop, 2007). King (1955) and Pugh (1955) argued that
the crustal unloading associated with escarpment retreat on continental margins such as southern Africa would like-
wise lead to isostatic uplift of the margin.

perties that are not observed when each component acts isolated.

An example of complex system is the interaction of erosion and isostatic response. The

erosion of the continents, when observed isolated, results in the lowering of the topography

(Figure 1.2a). On the other hand, when erosion is combined with the regional isostatic

response of the lithosphere (Figure 1.2b), the evolving topography can leads to mountain

peak uplift (Molnar and England, 1990). In both cases the mean elevation decreases

through time, but the regional isostatic compensation causes uplift of portions of the

surface less eroded. This example shows how the interaction between surface and tectonic

processes can lead to counterintuitive results: erosion can induce local uplift.

In the context of divergent margins, Gilchrist and Summerfield (1990) showed that

the combination of erosion and flexural isostatic compensation can explain the formation

and permanence of escarpments parallel to the coast, as observed in many rifted margins

around the world (Matmon et al., 2002). In this model, the escarpment is maintained by

flexural response of the lithosphere to the denudational unloading of the margin, resulting

in the formation of the coastal plain (Figure 1.3).

Following the model of Gilchrist and Summerfield (1990), many numerical models were

Figure 7. Results of numerical model showing the escarpment lip upwarp in SW Africa that is the flexural response of the plateau
edge to the denudational unloading associated with the formation of the coastal plain by escarpment retreat or in-place excavation
of the escarpment, seaward (to the left of ) the escarpment (see text). The solid line represents the topography. The escarpment lip
flexes up in response to the unloading on the adjacent coastal plain. The different model outcomes, represented by the variously
dotted and dashed lines, correspond to model ‘runs’ employing different lithospheric flexural rigidities (different values of the
effective elastic thickness, Te). Higher values of Te correspond to more rigid lithosphere and flexural effects over a correspondingly
longer distance. Thus, the unloading associated with coastal plain formation has the longest-distance flexural effect on the plateau
surface for the maximum Te value (here 22.5 km). Low values of Te (i.e. very flexible lithosphere) mean that the flexural effect is
transmitted the shortest distance inland of the escarpment lip, and are also associated with a very pronounced updoming on the
coastal plain (redrawn with corrections from Figure 2a of Gilchrist and Summerfield, 1990).

post-breakup evolution of the margin (type-2 escarpment; e.g. the US Atlantic passive continental margin – Pazzaglia
and Gardner, 2000). As noted above, the lips of such wall-like escarpments tend to be a drainage divide, either the
main continental divide or a subsidiary but still major divide, in both cases maintained by flexural effects associated
with denudational unloading associated with coastal plain formation (Gilchrist and Summerfield, 1990; Gunnel and

developed to study the interaction of erosion and flexural isostasy in divergent margins,

incorporating sophisticated models that dynamically simulate the erosion of the landscape



32 Chapter 1. Introduction

(see Merrits and Ellis, 1994, and papers in this volume). These models also explored how

preexistent topographic features, climatic conditions, lithological resistance and flexural

rigidity of the lithosphere influence the evolution of the escarpment. All these models

showed that the evolution of high-elevation escarpments in rifted margins is intimately

related to the coupling of surface and tectonic processes.

Likewise the escarpments along divergent margins, the sedimentary basins in rifted

margins are the product of the combined action of different processes. A classical example

is the elegant model proposed by McKenzie (1978), where the subsidence history of the

basin in the rifted margin can be described as the coupling between a pure-shear stretching

model, the thermal cooling of the lithosphere and the isostatic compensation. In this model,

the total subsidence of the sedimentary basin can be decomposed into three parts: (1) due

to the initial stretching and thinning of the lithosphere; (2) due to the following cooling of

the lithosphere; and (3) due to the load of the influx of sediments to the basin.

Other advances about the understanding of the evolution of sedimentary basins appea-

red in the study of two dimensional problems. For example, Watts et al. (1982) developed

basin filling models where the flexural rigidity of the lithosphere increases through time as

a result of the cooling of the lithosphere. They observed that the increase of the flexural

rigidity in the margin during the sedimentary filling results in the widening of the basin,

producing stratigraphic onlap (Figure 1.4a). Using a viscoelastic plate to represent the

flexural behavior of the lithosphere to loading, Beaumont (1978) simulated the evolution

of sedimentary basins on a lithosphere with decreasing rigidity, resulting in stratigraphic

offlap (Figure 1.4b). An important result from these numerical models is that the effect

of variations of flexural rigidity may be misinterpreted as due to variations in the sea level

in the stratigraphic record.

All the models presented in this introduction are a few examples of how the coupling

of different surface and tectonic processes can lead to fruitful insights into the evolution of

divergent margins. More examples can be seen in recent reviews that show the state-of-

the-art of the coupling of surface and tectonic processes in different tectonic settings (e.g.

Beaumont et al., 2000; Braun, 2006; Bishop, 2007). Due to the complexity of the coupling

of the many processes acting in the evolution of Earth’s surface, the use of computer models

is a natural procedure to quantify the relative importance of each of them.

1.2 The purpose of this work

In spite of the great number of numerical models created in the last decades to study

the coupling between surface and tectonic processes, there is a lack of models that take

into account the onshore and offshore parts of rifted margins, with a few exceptions (e.g.

van Balen et al., 1995). Furthermore, previous models developed to study the evolution of

passive margins and the coupling of surface processes and flexural response do not include

the rifting during the simulation and treat the rifting conditions as a “black box”.

Aiming to further contribute on the study of divergent margins, this work presents a

numerical model that tries to simulate the evolution of divergent margins since the onset of

rifting, incorporating onshore and offshore processes of erosion and sedimentation, flexural

compensation and thermal processes in the lithosphere.

The aim of this thesis is not to develop new algorithms to investigate a specific geological

process. Instead, the purpose of this work is to study how the combination of preexistent

models for different geological processes contributes to the emergence of new scenarios,

that otherwise could not be predicted through the analysis of isolated processes.

The numerical model proposed here is a means to improve the understanding on the in-

teraction between different processes acting during and after lithospheric stretching. The-

refore, the main target was to apply the model to geological problems, instead of the

development of the code itself. On the other hand, most of the project time was devoted

to the development of each part of the code and the coupling of them. Thus the first

chapters of this thesis are dedicated to describe in detail the numerical approach for each

physical/geological process incorporated in this study (Chapters 2 to 5), culminating in

the description of the coupling of all the processes (Chapter 6).

Chapter 2 presents the flexural model used to simulate the regional isostatic behavior

of the lithosphere to vertical loading and Chapter 3 describes the model for the thermal

evolution of the lithosphere. In both chapters, the finite element formulation is presented

in detail, as well as the comparisons with analytical solutions. The kinematic model for

the stretching of the lithosphere to simulate rifting during the formation and evolution of

divergent margins is presented in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 describes the surface processes

model that simulates the erosion, transport and deposition of sediments on the surface.

Chapter 7 shows the applications of the numerical model described in the previous

chapters. In Section 7.1 an example of application is discussed on how rifting influences

the evolution of the landscape and the position of the drainage divide along rifted margins.

The predicted results are compared with the Southeastern margins of Brazil and Australia.

Section 7.2 describes how the passage of thermal anomalies under the lithosphere influences

the evolution of sedimentary basins in divergent margins. A possible thermal influence

of the Trindade Plume on the evolution of the Campos and Esp??rito Santo Basins in

Southeastern Brazil is analysed and discussed.

Finally, Chapter 8 gives the conclusions of the thesis, the advantages and limitations

of the numerical models as well as perspectives for future work.

Flexure and isostasy1

It appears as though the mountain ranges

had been piled too high by tangential forces,

and by virtue of the partial rigidity of the crust,

had depressed the heighboring ocean bottoms.

(Barrell 1914 in Watts 2001)

2.1 Introduction

The concept of a strong uppermost layer of the Earth, named lithosphere, floating on

a weak layer, the asthenosphere, originated in the beginning of the 20th century, with

the work of Barrell (1914). This concept has survived through time and is an important

element to the theory of plate tectonics: “Plate tectonics is based on the assumption that

the lithosphere is rigid on long timescales and is moving across the surface of the Earth

with the plates” (Watts, 2007).

A strong lithosphere floating on a weak substratum implies that geological loads are

not locally compensated by the buoyancy forces exerted by the asthenosphere (i.e. pure

isostasy), but the load is partly sustained by the rigidity of the lithosphere. This behavior

of the lithosphere can be approximated as a thin elastic plate floating on an inviscid

substratum.

Since the second half of the 20th century, the thin elastic plate representation of the

lithosphere has been successfully used to explain the flexural behavior of the lithosphere,

(2009).

both in oceans (e.g. Walcott, 1970; Watts, 1982) and continents (e.g. Karner and Watts,

1983; Lyon-Caen and Molnar, 1983).

The thickness of the elastic plate that represents the flexural behavior of the real

lithosphere is named effective elastic thickness or Te. The Te does not coincide with the

lithospheric thickness and does not represent a real layer of the Earth. Instead, the effective

elastic thickness is a measure of the integrated strength of the lithosphere. As part of the

lithosphere behaves non-elastically through the geological time, the Te is thinner than the

lithospheric thickness. The value of Te can vary in space and time and there are many

physical properties of the lithosphere that influence the Te: the thickness of the crust and

lithospheric mantle; the crustal composition; the thermal state of the lithosphere; the state

of stress and the local curvature of the lithosphere (Burov and Diament, 1995). Therefore

the determination of Te can be used to study the thermal and mechanical structure of the

lithosphere.

In the present work, the flexure of the lithosphere is simulated using the thin elastic

plate approximation. In the following sections, the numerical approach for the flexural

isostasy of the lithosphere is described, as well as the comparison with analytical solutions.

2.2 Flexure of a thin elastic plate and its numerical solution

The differential equation that describes the flexure w = w(x,y) of a thin elastic plate

under the vertical loads q is presented in equation 2.1.

matrix. A detailed deduction of equation 2.1 is provided by Timoshenko and Woinowsky-

Krieger (1959).

The numerical solution of equation 2.1 through the finite element method is presented

by Zienkiewicz and Taylor (2000a) and is based on the principle of virtual work: for an

arbitrary displacement ?w of a plate ? out of the plane xy, the plate will be at equilibrium

if the internal virtual work ??int (related to the deformations of the plate) and the external

virtual work ??ext (related to the loads applied on the plate) are equal:

??int ? ??ext = 0. (2.2)

The internal and external virtual works for the thin elastic plate problem are given by

(see Zienkiewicz and Taylor, 2000a)

??int =

?
?

?w(L?)TD(L?)wd? (2.3)

??ext =

?
?

?wqd? + b.c. (2.4)

where the term b.c. represents boundary conditions of ?, necessary for the solution of the

problem and physically represents the link of the plate with adjacent regions.

For the study of lithospheric flexure, the load q can be decomposed into two components:

1. due to the buoyancy force per unit area exerted by the asthenosphere ??mgw, where

?m is the density of the asthenosphere and g is the gravity. The negative sign indicates

that the buoyancy force has the opposite sense of the deflection w;

2. due to other loads q? related to topographic loads, sedimentary loads and thermal

expansion of the lithosphere, for example.

In the geoscience literature (e.g. Turcotte and Schubert, 1982), the buoyancy force

term is commonly represented as an effective buoyancy force, dependent on the difference

of density between the asthenosphere and the material infilling the depressions at the

surface created during the deflection of the plate (?m ? ?infill). Here the buoyancy term

is treated as dependent only on ?m and all the other external loads are merged in the q?

term. The reason for this procedure will be explained in detail in section 6.4, where the

coupling of the different processes that compose the numerical model is described.



38 Chapter 2. Flexure and isostasy

Therefore, the expression 2.4 can be rewritten as

??ext =

?
?

?w [q? ??mgw] d? + b.c. (2.5)

The function w can be approximated by w ? w? = Na where N = N(x,y) is a row

vector containing interpolation functions called shape functions chosen a priori and a is

a column vector containing the unknown parameters. The shape functions used in this

work will be described in the next section. The virtual displacement ?w is replaced by

?w = ?aTNT, where ?aT is a row vector containing arbitrary parameters.

Replacing w and ?w in Eqs. 2.3 and 2.5, the equation 2.2 becomes

independent of ?aT, resulting in the linear system

2.3 The choice of the finite element

There are dozens of different finite element types used to study the problem of bending

of thin elastic plates (see Zienkiewicz and Taylor, 2000a). In the present work, triangular

elements and the shape functions developed by Specht (1988) were adopted. This trian-

gular element is composed of 3 nodes, each one with 3 degrees of freedom: the vertical

displacement w and the partial derivatives of w with respect to x and y. Zienkiewicz and



Section 2.3. The choice of the finite element 39

Taylor (2000a) pointed out that this type of element is one of the best triangular elements

with 9 degrees of freedom currently available.

The domain ? is subdivided into triangular elements ?e (e = 1, . . . ,m), where m is

the number of elements. These m elements are interconnected by n nodes that are, in this

case, the vertices of the triangles. The function w? = Na is composed of

The equation 2.11 shows that each node i has 3 degrees of freedom: (1) displacement

w?i in the z direction, (2) rotation ?xi around the x axis and (3) rotation ?yi around the y

axis.

For a certain point xp = (xp,yp) inside the element e, the functions Ni are

The use of local coordinates for each element, instead of global coordinates, is a common

procedure in finite element method to facilitate the computation of the stiffness and load

matrices for each element.

The local coordinates Li, Lj and Lk are also called areal coordinates and are used to

represent the position of an internal point relative to the vertices of the triangle. Geome-

trically, the areal coordinates can be defined as the following ratios (see Figure 2.1)

Li =

The areal coordinate is non-dimensional and range from 0 to 1: Li = 1 if xp = xi and

Li = 0 if the point xp lies on the opposite edge jk. Another property is Li + Lj + Lk = 1.

The stiffness matrix in 2.8 depends on the shape functions N and the second derivatives

of N with respect to the horizontal coordinates, represented by B = (L?)N. To obtain

these derivatives with respect to the areal coordinates, the chain rule is used, as shown

For an element e only 9 coefficients of N are non-zero: 3 nodes × 3 degrees of freedom.

Therefore, the load vector f

has 9 non-zero coefficients and the stiffness matrix K
e

has

9 × 9 = 81 non-zero coefficients.

To illustrate the construction of K and f , the Figure 2.2a presents a finite element mesh

composed of 3 elements and 5 nodes and Figures 2.2b and c show the non-zero coefficients

of the stiffness matrices and the load vectors, respectively.

The integration over each finite element is made numerically using three points of

quadrature: for a certain function f = f(Li,Lj,Lk), where Li, Lj and Lk are the areal

coordinates of the triangle ijk, the integral I over the triangle ijk

2.5 Applying the boundary conditions and solving the linear system

After the construction of K and f , it is imposed restrictions to some degrees of freedom

on nodes at the border of finite element mesh. This is done prescribing values to some

coefficients of the vector a. Algebraically, this result in the elimination of lines and columns

of the matrix K and coefficients of vector f .

The vector fb is not known a priori. This vector represents tractions on the borders

of the plate that, in combination with the pre-determined loads of the problem (i.e. the

2.6 Comparison with analytical solutions

In this section, numerical solutions are compared with analytical ones to validate the

numerical model to study the flexure of the lithosphere.

Firstly, it is considered the case of an infinite elastic beam of constant rigidity D floating

on a substratum of density ?m, under the load q uniformly distributed over the segment

A ? B of the beam (Figure 2.3). The deflection of the plate at the point C, which is a

distance a from A and a distance b from B, can be classified in three cases (Hetenyi, 1967):

It can be observed that the maximum difference is smaller than 2.5% of the deflection

at the center of the load w0. For the mesh with the smallest elements (Le = AB/8) the

maximum difference was less than 0.2% of w0.

As a second example it is considered the case of horizontal variation of flexural rigi-

solutions using the finite difference method for the problem of flexure of elastic plates with

spatial variation of flexural rigidity. They showed the importance of considering the lateral

variation of rigidity to appropriately describe the flexure of the lithosphere. However, these

authors did not validate their codes comparing the results with analytical solutions that

take into account variable flexural rigidity.

The comparison between the analytical and numerical solutions for the problem of vari-

solutions for the flexure of a plate with lateral variation of D converge to the exact solution

(Figure 2.7b). But in the second example the magnitude of the errors is larger than in the

previous one. For the coarsest mesh (Le = 25 km), the difference between the numerical

and analytical solutions reaches up to 16.8% of w0, the exact deflection under the line load.

For the finest mesh (Le = 6.25 km) the maximum error is smaller than 1.1% of w0.

analytical solutions. All the curves are divided by the modulus of the exact deflection |w0|

under the line load.

There are two reasons for the increase of the error in this second example: Firstly,

it is known that for the same finite element mesh and using the shape functions derived

by Specht (1988), the convergence to the analytical solution occurs faster for distributed

loads than concentrated ones (see Zienkiewicz and Taylor, 2000a, section 4.8). Secondly,

observe that the largest discrepancy occurs to the left of the line load, where the flexural

rigidity is low. For a finite element mesh with constant element size Le, it would be

expected that the error must be larger in the portions of the plate where it is less rigid,

because the wavelength of the deflection in these regions is shorter than in other ones. The

characteristic wavelength of the plate can be calculated through the flexural parameter ?

For Te = 3 km, the flexural parameter is ? ? 13.1 km, which is nearly half of Le of the

coarsest mesh of the second example. Therefore, if Le is much larger than the characteristic

wavelength of the plate, the numerical solution cannot appropriately describe the real

deflection.

To prove that an increase of the error in the second example is due to the two reasons

previously explained and not due to an abrupt transition of rigidity, the same problem of

the line load but with constant Te = 3 km (Figure 2.8) is presented.

By comparing Figures 2.7b and 2.8b, it can be observed that the errors are of the same

order, implying that the abrupt variation of flexural rigidity did not introduce expressive



50 Chapter 2. Flexure and isostasy

errors in the numerical solution. This shows that the proposed finite element model to

study the flexure of lithospheric plates is robust to incorporate lateral variation of rigidity.

With the appropriate choice of the finite element size Le, depending on the flexural rigidity

of the plate, provides accurate solutions for the problem of bending of thin elastic plates.



Chapter 3

Thermal model

Earth’s heat engine works in ways which

still elude us after many years of research,

both on the fundamental physical aspects of convection

in the mantle and on securing new and precise observations.

(Jaupart et al., 2007)

3.1 Introduction

The thermal structure of the crust and mantle is a key aspect to understand the mecha-

nical behavior of the Earth in different tectonic settings. As pointed out in the beginning

of the previous chapter, the temperature is one of the physical parameters that controls

the rheology of the lithosphere. Actually, laboratorial experiments and theoretical studies

show that the temperature is one of the most important physical parameter controlling

the rheology of solids (Turcotte and Schubert, 1982).

Besides the rheological aspect, the variation in the thermal structure of the lithosphere

leads to vertical movements of the surface due to thermal contraction or expansion of the

lithosphere (e.g. Parsons and Sclater, 1977; McKenzie, 1978). Therefore the evolution of

the thermal structure of the lithosphere influences the topography and bathymetry and,

consequently, the surface processes through the geological time.

The variation in the thermal structure of the lithosphere occurs by heat transfer and

there are three mechanisms for the transport of heat: thermal diffusion, advection and ra-

diation. Thermal diffusion occurs by transfer of kinetic energy through collision of adjacent

particles that compose the material, without mass transport. This kind of heat transport



52 Chapter 3. Thermal model

is only possible when there is a spatial variation of the temperature in the medium. Unlike

the thermal diffusion, the advection is related to the transport of mass, i.e. the movement

of the particles carries the heat to another place. The third way to transport heat, the

electromagnetic radiation, is important only in small scale due to the absorption of this

energy by the adjacent rocks and therefore can be treated as part of the thermal diffusion.

This radiative transport probably contributes as a minor component of the thermal diffu-

sion because the mean free path of photons in the crust and mantle is very small (Ricard,

2007). Therefore the transport of heat in the interior of the Earth can be described through

the advection and the thermal diffusion.

In the following sections, the heat transfer equation is presented as well as its numerical

treatment through the finite element method.

3.2 Heat transfer equation and its numerical solution

To study the evolution of the temperature in the interior of the crust and mantle during

and after tectonism, the transient, three dimensional heat transfer equation is considered

T is the temperature. In this equation, the advection velocity v describes the velocity of

rock particles in the interior of crust and mantle.

In equation 3.1, the first term represents the local variation of the temperature and

the second is the advective term. The two terms on the right side of the equation are the

diffusive term and the source term, respectively.

Assume that equation 3.1 is valid in the domain ?V with the boundary ?V . The

boundary conditions are

nV + q?H = 0 on ?V q (3.2)

and

T = T? on ?V T (3.3)

?V = ?V T ? ?V q (3.4)

and

? = ?V T ? ?V q. (3.5)

The superposed bar in equation 3.4 represents the set closure and ? in equation 3.5 is the

empty set.

The equation 3.2 is the boundary condition that represents the prescribed heat flow

q?H on ?V q, where nV is the unit vector normal to ?V and pointing outward of ?V . The

equation 3.3 is the boundary condition imposing the temperature T? on ?V T .

The variational formulation for equation 3.1 with the boundary condition 3.2 is (see

As the temperature is specified on ?V T (equation 3.3), the last term in equation 3.7 is

on ?V q, this means that the normal gradient of temperature is zero

Section 3.2. Heat transfer equation and its numerical solution 55

Unlike M and Kd, the matrix Ka, related to the advection velocity v, is non-symmetric.

Due to this asymmetry, when the advection is the dominant process to transport heat, the

accuracy of the numerical solution of equation 3.11 deteriorates and, in some cases, becomes

unstable (see Zienkiewicz and Taylor, 2000c, chapter 2).

To improve the accuracy and stability of the solution, the streamline upwind Petrov-

Galerkin process is applied (Hughes and Brooks, 1979, 1982; Zienkiewicz and Taylor, 2000c)

and the equation 3.11 is replaced by

he is the characteristic element size in the direction of the advection velocity v and will be

defined in the next section.

The discretization in time is done following the implicit scheme adopted by Braun

(2003):
aT (t + ?t) ? aT (t)

?t
= ?a?T (t + ?t) + (1 ??)a?T (t) (3.18)

where ? is a weighting parameter adopted here equal to 0.5. Multiplying both sides by

M(t + ?t), the equation 3.18 becomes

M(t + ?t)
aT (t + ?t) ? aT (t)

?t
= ?M(t + ?t)a?T (t + ?t) + (1 ??)M(t + ?t)a?T (t).

Assuming that M(t + ?t) ? M(t) and using the equation 3.16, results in

M(t + ?t)
aT (t + ?t) ? aT (t)

?t
= ? [F(t + ?t) ? KT (t + ?t)aT (t + ?t)] +

+(1 ??) [F(t) ? KT (t)aT (t)] .



56 Chapter 3. Thermal model

Rearranging the terms, the following equation is obtained

[M(t + ?t) + ?t?KT (t + ?t)] aT (t + ?t) =

= [M(t + ?t) ? ?t(1 ??)KT (t)] aT (t) + ?t [?F(t + ?t) + (1 ??)F(t)] .(3.19)

3.3 The choice of the finite element

The linear tetrahedron is the finite element used in the three dimensional heat transfer

problem. Therefore, the domain ?V is subdivided into m tetrahedral elements, intercon-

nected by n nodes. As previously presented, the function T? = NV aT is composed of

aT = [aT1, aT2, aT3, · · · , aTn]
T

(3.20)

NV = [NV 1, NV 2, NV 3, · · · , NV n] . (3.21)

Unlike the flexural model, in the thermal model each node has only one degree of

freedom: the temperature.

For a certain point xp = (xp,yp,zp) inside the element e, the function NV i is

NV i(xp,yp,zp) =

??
? N

e
V i(xp,yp,zp) if i is a vertex of e

0 if i is not a vertex of e
(3.22)

and the shape functions for the element e with nodes i, j, k and l are

NeV i = LV 1(xp) =
Volume pjkl
Volume ijkl

, NeV j = LV 2(xp) =
Volume ipkl
Volume ijkl

,

NeV k = LV 3(xp) =
Volume ijpl
Volume ijkl

, NeV l = LV 4(xp) =
Volume ijkp
Volume ijkl

(3.23)

where LV ’s are the local coordinates for the tetrahedral element and Volume ijkl represents

the volume of the tetrahedron formed by the nodes i, j, k and l, and so on. The denomi-

nator represents the volume of the tetrahedral element and the numerator represents the

volume of the sub-tetrahedra composed of three nodes of the tetrahedral element plus the

internal node p (Figure 3.1). Since the sum of the volumes of the four sub-tetrahedra is

equal to the total volume of the tetrahedral element, the sum of the shape functions for

an element e is:

LV 1(xp) + LV 2(xp) + LV 3(xp) + LV 4(xp) = 1

To obtain a positive value for the volume using the previous expression, the ordering of

the nodes i, j, k and l must follow the right-hand rule as in Figure 3.1. In this rule the

nodes i, j and k are numbered in an anti-clockwise manner when viewed from node l.

The local coordinates are written directly as functions of the coordinates of the element

nodes and the position of the internal point of interest p as

tructed as the summation of M

From equation 3.22, it is possible to see that, for an element e, only 4 coefficients of

NV are non-zero, that are the 4 coefficients related to the 4 nodes of the element e. Thus,

the column vector F

has 4 non-zero coefficients and the matrices M

To exemplify the construction of the linear system from the summation of the matrices

in equations 3.27, Figure 3.2a illustrates the assemblage of 3 tetrahedral elements and 6

nodes. Figures 3.2c and d show the matrices and the column vector for each element and

the resulting summation, indicating the non-zero coefficients, where K can represent M,

K?a or Kc.

To calculate the integrals from equations 3.27 over each element, an useful formula is

3.5 Comparison with analytical solutions

To validate the numerical model to study the heat transport in the crust and mantle, the

numerical solutions were compared with analytical ones. The first case is the McKenzie’s

model (McKenzie, 1978).

In this model, a portion of the lithosphere of length aL (Figure 3.3a) is suddenly

stretched to a length aL?, resulting in the upward movement of hot asthenosphere (Figure

3.3b). After this, the thermal perturbation is gradually dissipated by thermal diffusion,

restoring the temperature profile previous to stretching (Figure 3.3c).

In this model, the advection and the radioactive production are neglected (v = 0 and

Ar = 0). Moreover the temperature is dependent only on depth and time (T = T(t,z)).

Assuming a constant thermal conductivity kT , the equation 3.1 becomes

lithosphere at t = 0 showing the passive uplift of the asthenosphere, indicated as A. (c) Final

Previous to extension, the temperature profile is in equilibrium, varying linearly from

T = T1 at the base of the lithosphere (z = ?aL) to T = 0 at the surface (z = 0)

(Figure 3.3a). After the extension of the lithosphere, at t = 0, the temperature profile is

The thermal evolution of the lithosphere since t = 0 considers the temperature at z = 0

and z = ?aL constant at T = 0 and T = T1, respectively. The evolution of the temperature

profile for t &gt; 0 is described by the following equation (see McKenzie, 1978).

Figure 3.4: Representation of the finite element mesh composed of tetrahedra to study the

thermal evolution of the lithosphere. aL represents the initial thickness of the lithosphere.

To numerically simulate McKenzie’s model, a finite element mesh with tetrahedra was

constructed, as shown in Figure 3.4. The domain ?V is a right-rectangular prism and

the discretization in tetrahedra is done subdividing the domain into smaller prisms, then

subdividing each prism into two wedges and each wedge into three tetrahedra (see Figure

3.5).

The temperature at the top and the bottom faces of the domain ?V are maintained

constant throughout the simulation

T = 0 at z = 0, T = T1 at z = ?aL

and the heat flux through the side faces are zero

?T

?nv
= 0.

The other physical parameters of the model are shown in Table 3.1.

To check the convergence of the numerical solution toward the correct one with the

refinement of the mesh, different models were tested with different number of element

layers nel in the z direction. For example, the mesh of Figure 3.4 has 6 layers (nel = 6).

Figure 3.6 shows the numerical solutions and the analytical one at t = 10, 30 and 50

My. In this figure, the dashed lines show the steady-state configuration (t ??). All the

numerical solutions compare well with the analytical one. Moreover, the increase in the

number of layers nel results in the convergence toward the analytical solution. The greatest

differences between analytical and numerical solutions occur during the first stages of the

simulation, when the rate of temperature variation is high.

The second example is the case of a steadily eroding lithosphere. The free surface at

z = 0 is eroded at a constant rate wadv. As a consequence the lithosphere moves upward

temperature at the surface (z = 0) and at the bottom of the lithosphere (z = ?aL) are

maintained constant at T = 0 and T = T1, respectively.

This dimensionless number compares the heat transport by advection with the heat trans-

port by diffusion. When PeL ? 0, the heat is mainly transported by diffusion and when

PeL ? 1 the advection is the dominant process to transfer heat.

Three values of the Peclet number were studied: PeL = 1, 5 and 10. The values for

kT , aL and T1 are the same for the previous example (Table 3.1) and the upward velocity

wadv is determined from the expression 3.29 for PeL. The results are shown in Figure 3.7.

lithosphere for different Peclet number. The upper graphics show the temperature profile for

PeL = 1, 5 and 10. The dashed lines indicate the temperature profile for PeL = 0. The

lower graphics show the difference between numerical and analytical solutions.

In the three cases the numerical solutions compare well with the analytical ones and the

convergence to the exact solution occurs as the number of element layers nel increases. One



66 Chapter 3. Thermal model

can observe in the lower graphics in Figure 3.7 that the magnitude of the error increases

for high PeL numbers, and the errors are concentrated in the upper portion of the plate.

This is because for higher Peclet number the vertical gradient of temperature ?T/?z also

increases, mainly in the upper portion of the plate, close to the free surface.

For advection dominated heat transport, the numerical model remains stable and the

solution is very close to the analytical one (Figure 3.8). Therefore, the proposed numerical

model is robust to study the thermal evolution of the lithosphere even when the advection

is the dominant process to transport heat.

Stretching of the lithosphere

The more closely we look at areas of continental extension

the more we see that all rifts are not created equal.

(Buck et al., 1999)

4.1 Introduction

Since the acceptance of plate tectonics by the scientific community, many geoscientists

have attempted to understand how the lithosphere breaks and evolves to divergent mar-

gins (Buck, 2004, and references therein). One challenging aspect is to understand the

diversity of rift styles observed on Earth. Rifts can be narrow or wide (England, 1983) and

present different “degrees” of asymmetry between the conjugate margins. Furthermore,

the influence of magmatism during rifting varies widely and many rifts fail and do not

evolve to passive margins. In spite of this variety of rift styles, rifted regions are generally

characterized by crustal thinning, high heat flow, negative Bouguer anomalies and uplif-

ted margins (Allen and Allen, 2005) and these similarities were the starting point for the

geodynamic study of rifts.

A strategy to study the rift of the lithosphere is through kinematic models to describe

the strain field during stretching. This kind of model was successfully applied by McKenzie

(1978), where he presented an elegant analytical formulation that quantifies the gross

pattern of subsidence for basins in divergent margins, identifying two stages of subsidence:

the first one related to stretching and thinning of the lithosphere; and a second one caused

by the thermal cooling of the lithosphere.

In the model of McKenzie (1978), the lithosphere is stretched instantaneously and the



68 Chapter 4. Stretching of the lithosphere

stretch is uniform with depth, by pure-shear (Figure 4.1a). There is no lateral heat transfer

and local isostasy is assumed, i.e. the rigidity of the lithosphere is null.

zie (1978), where the stretching is uniform. The dashed lines bound the stretched regions.

(b) Non-uniform pure shear model of Royden and Keen (1980). (c) Simple shear model of

Wernicke (1985).

In the following years, this simple model was improved. Jarvis and McKenzie (1980)

considered finite rates of extension and therefore the rift is not instantaneous as in the

model of McKenzie (1978). Studying the subsidence history of the Labrador shelf, Royden

and Keen (1980) observed that the Mckenzie’s model cannot describe the evolution of this

margin. They concluded that the mantle under the Labrador margin was considerably

more extended than the crust to fit the subsidence curve. Later, this variation of extension

with depth was observed in other margins (e.g. Roberts et al., 1997; Driscoll and Karner,

1998). Royden and Keen (1980) proposed a model that consider the effect of non-uniform

stretch with depth, assuming that the extension of the crust and lithospheric mantle are

independent (Figure 4.1b). Although the model of Royden and Keen (1980) reasonably



Section 4.1. Introduction 69

describes the subsidence of margins with non-uniform stretch with depth, their model

presents problems of mass conservation during stretching (Figure 4.1b).

Wernicke (1985) proposed a simple shear model to describe the stretching of the litho-

sphere, where a low-angle detachment fault divides the lithosphere into two portions: an

upper plate or hangingwall, and a lower plate or footwall (Figure 4.1c). Unlike the model

of Royden and Keen (1980), in the simple shear model the mass is conserved during

stretching. This model implies asymmetric conjugate margins, where the lithospheric

mantle is more extended than the crust in the upper plate margin, while in the lower plate

margin the crust is more extended than the mantle. On the other hand, Driscoll and Karner

(1998) observed that many rifted margins, including conjugate ones, are characterized by

lithospheric mantle much more stretched than the crust. They coined this as the upper

plate paradox.

Combination of the pure shear and simple shear was presented by Kusznir et al. (1991),

where the upper-crust is stretched following a simple shear deformation pattern, while the

lower crust and lithospheric mantle are stretched following the pure shear style. Kusznir

et al. (1991) included in their model the flexural cantilever effect to describe the flexural

behavior of the upper crust during stretching, producing uplift of footwall. This model

also simulates the formation of small wavelength features of few kilometers, describing

the geometry of grabens and crustal block rotation. Previous to Kusznir et al. (1991),

Weissel and Karner (1989) applied the flexural cantilever model for the entire lithosphere

to describe the flexural response of the plate to extension.

Braun and Beaumont (1989) showed the importance of consider the finite strength

of the lithosphere during stretching and introduced the concept of necking depth, which

is defined as the depth in the lithosphere that remains horizontal during stretching if

no isostatic compensation is applied. Physically the necking depth is close to the layer

of maximum strength in the lithosphere. If the necking depth is shallow (Figure 4.2),

e.g. representing a strong crust, the addition of isostatic forces produces a down warping

of the rift zone. On the other hand, a deep necking depth, associated with the isostatic

forces, produces an upward movement of the rift zone, creating flank uplifts.

In spite of the different formalisms, the flexural cantilever and the necking depth mo-

dels agree that the lithosphere retains flexural rigidity during extension, and the regional

margins around the world.

(upper figure) and deep (lower figure) necking depth without isostatic compensation. The

dashed lines represent the necking depth and the gray region is the lithosphere. The right

panels show the combination of stretching and regional isostatic response of the lithosphere.

Kusznir and Karner (2007) and Fletcher et al. (2009) proposed that the deformation of

the lithosphere during stretching is similar to previous models for the evolution of oceanic

crust and mid ocean ridges (Reid and Jackson, 1981). In this model (Figure 4.3), the

upward movement of the mantle is maximum under the zone of stretching. Close to the

surface, the upward movement diverges laterally and reaches the highest horizontal velocity

at the surface.

Kusznir and Karner (2007) proposed that the deformation and thinning of the conti-

nental lithosphere guided by the upwelling divergent flow field naturally leads to breakup

and formation of sea-floor spreading. This model successfully predicted depth-dependent

stretching, resulting in “upper plate” behavior on both conjugate margins.

In the present work, different aspects of these previous models were used to study

the stretching of the lithosphere. The upwelling divergent flow was used to describe the

stretching pattern of the lithospheric mantle and lower crust during rifting. To simulate

the creation of faults and the flexural response to faulting of the upper crust, the flexural

cantilever model of Kusznir et al. (1991) was used. Furthermore, the horizontal movement

of density interfaces during stretching results in vertical loads on the lithosphere that are

regionally compensated, as described in Chapter 6.

The details about the stretching model used in the present work are described in the

following sections.

4.2 The upwelling divergent flow

To simulate the upwelling divergent flow associated with the divergence of conjugate

margins and stretching of the lower part of the lithosphere near the center of the rift, the

solution to the classical corner flow problem (Fletcher et al., 2009) is used to describe v,

which is given by:

uadv = sign(x)

Ux is the half-spreading horizontal velocity at the surface and Uz is the axial vertical

velocity at x = 0, the center of the rift.

The advection velocity v = (uadv,vadv,wadv) is the same used in equation 3.1 to describe

the velocity of rock particles during stretching of the lithosphere.

In this model there are two parameters to be adjusted: the horizontal velocity Ux

and the vertical velocity Uz. Ux can be derived from the relative movement between

divergent lithospheric plates. On the other hand, Uz cannot be directly measured. For a

passive divergent flow with constant viscosity, the ratio Uz/Ux = 2/? (Morgan, 1987), thus

Uz &amp;lt;Ux in this situation. But considering that the viscosity is dependent on stress and

temperature, Fletcher et al. (2009) proposed that the ratio Uz/Ux must be higher than

expected by the passive isoviscous flow.



Section 4.3. The flexural cantilever model 73

In Figure 4.4a is presented the velocity field for the upwelling divergent flow with

Uz/Ux = 1. Due to symmetry, only half of the velocity field is plotted. Observe that

the vectorial field shown in Figure 4.4a is independent of the absolute value of Ux or Uz,

depending only on the ratio Uz/Ux. From an observer moving with the surface with velocity

Ux relative to the axis of the upwelling flow (Figure 4.4b) it is easy to verify that the lower

portion of the lithosphere flows oceanward. This shows the depth-dependent stretching of

the lithosphere in this model.

4.3 The flexural cantilever model

The Figure 4.5 exemplifies the flexural cantilever model. In this model, the footwall

and hanging wall (Figure 4.5a) interact as flexural cantilevers during planar faulting of the

upper crust. Under the upper crust, the lower crust flows to accommodate the faulting

and the density of the upper and lower crust are the same.

After faulting, the two blocks are welded together, behaving as a single plate.

To restore isostatic equilibrium, the lower crust imposes a buoyancy force per unit area

under the hanging wall (Figure 4.5) given by

FF = ??cgdf

where ?c is the density of the lower crust and g is the gravity.

The flexural response wF of the upper plate to the upward load FF is given by

(L?)TDucL?wF + ?cgwF = FF (4.3)

where Duc is the flexural rigidity of the upper crust, i.e. dependent of Te,uc. The final

configuration is shown in Figure 4.5d and the resulting topographic variation is

w?F = wF + df

Observe that in this case the fluid that produces the isostatic compensation is the lower

crust, and not the mantle. This is the reason for the appearance of ?c in the second term

of equation 4.3.



Chapter 5

Surface processes

Overall, we have learned two things:

1 It is not hard to invent plausible stratigraphic models.

2 It is very hard to test them.

(Paola, 2000)

5.1 Introduction

In the present work, the meaning of surface processes encompasses subaerial and sub-

marine processes of erosion, transport and deposition of sediments.

In spite of the clear relationship between erosion of emerged regions and deposition in

the sedimentary basins, quantitative models tend to treat them independently, with few

exceptions (e.g. Johnson and Beaumont, 1995; van Balen et al., 1995; Garcia-Castellanos,

2002). Therefore, through the last decades, the parallel development of quantitative models

of sedimentary basin filling and landscape evolution models has occurred almost isolated

from each other.

The first quantitative basin filling models to simulate clastic sequence stratigraphy were

based on two-dimensional geometric models (e.g. Pitman, 1978), where the geometry of the

sediment surface is previously prescribed and the evolution of the basin filling depends on

the imposed sediment supply and variations in the sea-level. These models were followed

by dynamic models based on equations of conservation of mass and “rules” guiding the

transport of sediments. For example Jordan and Flemings (1991), Rivenæs (1992) and

Rivenæs (1997) used linear diffusion to simulate the sediment transport on continental

shelves. Kaufman et al. (1991) proposed a depth-dependent diffusivity to simulate the



76 Chapter 5. Surface processes

decrease in energy available for sediment transport with increasing water depth. One of

the limitations of diffusion based stratigraphic models is that the diffusion tends to spread

the sediments and flatten the bathymetry, does not producing the characteristic feature of

prograding clinoforms as observed in seismic sections. Considering the depth-dependent

diffusivity, the flattening process is diminished. To reproduce the clinoform geometry,

Pirmez et al. (1998), followed by Driscoll and Karner (1999), proposed a advective-diffusive

model of sediment transport. The advective term in this model represents the residual

river current carrying sediments into deep water. On the other hand, both diffusional

and advective-diffusional models are empirical equations and they try to represent the

combination of different physical and chemical processes acting in the depositional setting.

Until now, it is not clear what is the best first-order dynamic equation to describe the

evolution of clastic shelves (Paola, 2000). Despite of the lack of a clear dynamic equation,

the reviewed models predict useful stratigraphic evolution of basin filling.

The development of numerical models to study landscape evolution started in the 1970s

[Ahnert 1976 in Coulthard 2001]. In the following years, new numerical models were deve-

loped showing improved descriptions of the different processes involved in the evolution of

the landscape, as well as its geometric discretization (Kirkby, 1986; Willgoose et al., 1991;

Beaumont et al., 1992; Tucker and Slingerland, 1994; Braun and Sambridge, 1997; Tucker

and Bras, 2000). A detailed revision of the different models is presented by Coulthard

(2001). Basically, the processes that sculpt the landscape in these numerical models are

described as short- and long-range processes. Short-range processes describe the transport

of sediments and the erosion along hillslopes, such as soil creep, earth flows, slides and rock-

fall (Kooi and Beaumont, 1994). These processes depend on the local slope, the soil type,

vegetation and climate. In the numerical models, the short range processes are simula-

ted through linear diffusion (e.g. Kooi and Beaumont, 1994), non-linear diffusion (Martin,

2000) or dependent on critical slope angle for soil movement by sliding (Densmore et al.,

1998). The long-range processes describe the cumulative effect of fluvial transport either

as bedload or in suspension (Beaumont et al., 1992). Besides the local slope, lithology and

vegetation, the long-range processes are dependent on water discharge, that is dependent

on precipitation and drainage area. If the effective precipitation is assumed uniform over

the surface, the water discharge is proportional to the drainage area. There are other



Section 5.2. Mathematical description of the surface processes 77

models that take into account glacial erosion (Braun et al., 1999), chemical weathering

(Kaufmann and Braun, 2001) and aeolian systems (conceptual model of Kocurek and

Havholm, 1993), but they are not discussed in the present work.

All these models try to study the large-scale long-term evolution of the surface proces-

ses. They represent a simple description of the complex processes that occur in different

time and space scales in the real world. About this aspect, Kooi and Beaumont (1994)

wrote: “As demonstrated in other sciences, a fruitful approach to such problems of scale

is to set aside (for the time being) the small-scale, short-timescale picture and to explore

simple relationships cast in terms of large-scale, long-timescale quantities. In thermody-

namics, for example, the behavior of gases was first formulated in terms of properties

associated with the collective behavior of molecules (pressure, temperature, and entropy)

and not the interactions between individual molecules”.

The following sections present the mathematical description of the surface processes

used in the present work, showing the discretization of the surface and the numerical

treatment of each process.

5.2 Mathematical description of the surface processes

In this work, the landscape evolution is guided by two types of processes (Beaumont

et al., 1992): short-range hillslope processes, like weathering and soil creep; and long-range

fluvial process.

Hillslope processes are modeled through a linear diffusion equation applied to topo-

graphy h, assuming that transport is linearly proportional to the slope (see Dietrich et al.

(2003) and references therein):
?h

?t
= ?· (kd?h) (5.1)

where kd is the coefficient of diffusive transport.

Fluvial processes of erosion, transport and sedimentation are modeled following the

formulation of Beaumont et al. (1992) where local variations in topography are described

through a first-order reaction equation given by:

?h

?t
= ?

q
eqb
f ? qf

(5.2)



78 Chapter 5. Surface processes

where q
eqb
f is the maximum sediment transport capacity, qf is the sediment flux per unit

width [L2T?1] and Lf is a parameter of erosion/deposition with dimension of [L]. q
eqb
f in

a channel takes the following form:

q
eqb
f = kfqr|?h| (5.3)

where kf is the erosional coefficient due to the fluvial process, qr is water discharge and

|?h| is the modulus of topographic gradient. The water discharge is calculated by spatially

integrating the net precipitation rate vR, which is assumed uniform in space and time for

simplicity. There are different expressions for q
eqb
f in the literature, where the exponents

of qr and |?h| are not equal to one (see Braun (2006)). These variations in the value of

the exponents of qr and |?h| are of secondary importance for the present work, since the

general drainage pattern and the position of the drainage divides will not be significantly

modified with the variation of the exponents (see Figure 9 in Tucker and Whipple, 2002).

The methodology of van Balen et al. (1995) is used for the offshore transport of sedi-

ments, based on the same principle as for diffusion processes on land, but with a non-linear

diffusion coefficient, km. Thus,
?h

?t
= ?· (km?h) (5.4)

In this simple model, the diffusivity km decreases exponentially with water depth, simula-

ting the decrease in energy available for sediment transport with increasing water depth:

km = k

k?m is a constant [L

5.3 Generation of the irregular mesh and discretization of the surface

5.3.1 Irregular distribution of the points

To represent the surface of the numerical model, an irregular mesh was adopted (Braun

and Sambridge, 1997). The main reason to use irregular meshes is the possibility to

adapt the mesh to appropriately deal with the landscape evolution during faulting of the

upper crust and simulate continuos horizontal movement between crutal blocks without



Section 5.3. Generation of the irregular mesh and discretization of the surface 79

loss of short-wavelength features (Braun and Sambridge, 1997). Besides the facility to deal

with relative movement of blocks, irregular meshes eliminate the artificial symmetry effect

observed in regular grids.

A fast way to produce an irregular mesh with uniform point density is to perturb the

position of the points of a regular mesh in a random manner

xi ? xri + ?rrand

yi ? yri + ?rrand

where xri = (xri,yri) is the point of the grid, xi = (xi,yi) is the new point of the irregular

mesh, ?r is the distance between two adjacent points in the grid and rand is a random

number centered in zero controlling the magnitude of the perturbation. Only the nodes

on the edge of the grid are maintained on the edge to preserve the rectangular geometry

of the mesh.

5.3.2 Delaunay triangulation and Voronoi diagrams

After the creation of the points of the mesh, the connectivity between them is deter-

mined. The first step is to discover the adjacent points for each point, named here as

neighbor points. Due to the initial perturbation of the grid, the neighbor points in the

irregular mesh do not necessarily coincide with the adjacent points in the previous grid,

and the task of identifying them is not trivial and requires a special way to interconnect

the points.

In the present work, the interconnection between the points of the irregular mesh

(Figure 5.1a) is done through the Delaunay triangulation (Delaunay, 1934). An example

is shown in Figure 5.1b. This triangulation has the property of maximize the minimum

inner angle of all created triangle. This means that from all the possible ways to create the

triangular mesh over n points, the Delaunay triangulation results in triangles “closer” to

equilateral triangles. Another property of this triangulation is that a circle circumscribed

on any Delaunay triangle does not contain any other point of the mesh.

The algorithm used to generate the triangular mesh is based on the works of Sloan

(1987) and Fortune (1992). Initially the mesh is constructed with a minimum number of

points of the border that encompasses all the other points of the mesh. For an example,



80 Chapter 5. Surface processes

for a rectangular mesh, only four points and two triangles are needed to initiate the tri-

angulation, as in the example of Figure 5.2, first picture. After this, a new point is added

to the mesh, verifying which circles circumscribed on the preexisting triangles contain the

new point. In this case, the respective triangles (indicated as light gray triangles in Figure

5.2) are erased, and only the points of these triangles, together with the new point, are

used to locally remake the mesh. Successively, all the other points are added and the mesh

is locally updated in each step (Figure 5.2).

To determine whether a point xp = (xp,yp) is inside a circle circumscribing a triangle

composed of the points x1, x2 and x3, ordered in the anti-clockwise sense, the following

determinant is calculated

Dinside =

.

If Dinside &gt; 0, the point xp is inside the circle.

After the determination of the triangular mesh, the next step is determine the area

associated with each point of the mesh. For this, the Voronoi diagram is used (Voronoi,

1908). An example of this diagram is presented in Figure 5.1c. This diagram divides the

plane in polygons named Voronoi cells. The Voronoi cell associated with the point xP

represents the region in the plane that is closest to this point than any other point of the

mesh.

The Voronoi diagram is a dual graph of the Delaunay triangulation. This means that

it is possible to associate each vertex of the Delaunay triangulation with a Voronoi cell,

and each edge of the triangles with one edge of the cells (Figure 5.1d). This implies that

the Voronoi cells are obtained from the Delaunay triangulation.

In this work, the algorithm of Lasserre (1983) was used to determine the area of each

Voronoi cell from the triangular mesh. The area Si of a Voronoi cell (Figure 5.3), related

to the point i is given by

Section 5.4. Formulation of the surface processes in the irregular mesh 85

5.4 Formulation of the surface processes in the irregular mesh

After the creation of the irregular mesh, each cell i of the Voronoi diagram is associated

with an elevation hi. In this model, the elevation in each cell is assumed to be constant,

resulting in a topography resembling “columnar jointing in basalts” (Figure 5.4a). On

the other hand, although the calculations of the surface processes are based on the flat

top of the Voronoi cells, it is more convenient to render the topography using Delaunay

triangulation, reducing the number of polygons to be displayed (Figure 5.4b).

The geometric parameters needed to numerically calculate the surface processes are

(for a specific cell i): the elevation hi; the cell area Si; the edge length ?Sij between the

cell i and the neighbor cell j and the distance Lij between i and j (see Figure 5.3).

5.4.1 Onshore and offshore diffusion

The diffusion, both in equation 5.1 for hillslope transport and in equation 5.4 for offshore

transport, is numerically calculated through an explicit finite volume approximation.

Therefore, the variation in elevation ?hi due to diffusion for the cell i during the time

step ?t is
?hi
?t

= ?· (kdiff?hi)

To calculate the cumulative volume of water Qr in each cell, the first step is to sort the

nodes from the upstream cells to the downstream ones. For this, it is assumed that water

flows from one cell to the other through the steepest direction, as shown in Figure 5.4c,

following the edges of the Delaunay triangulation (Figure 5.4d).

The cascade algorithm developed by Braun and Sambridge (1997) is used to calculate

the discharge. This algorithm is as follows, with few modifications here:



Section 5.5. Example 87

• (1) determine the steepest direction for each node, not taking into account offshore

nodes, i.e. nodes below the sea level (hi &amp;lt;hs.l.), and “sink” nodes, i.e. previously

specified nodes that behave as local base levels.

• (2) Each cell receives a flag = 1

• (3) If a cell receives water from an upstream cell with flag 6= 2, flag changes to 0

• (4) If flag = 1 in cell i, calculate Qri (equation 5.6), Q
eqb
fi (equation 5.5) and the

local topography variation ?hi (equation 5.7 or 5.9). Update the sediment volume

transported in the downstream cell j (equation 5.8 or 5.10) and add the parcel of

water Qri to the cell j. Flag of cell i changes to 2.

• (5) If flag = 0, change to 1.

• (6) If all flags = 2, exit, otherwise go to (3).

This algorithm has the advantage that it is not necessary to sort all the nodes from the

highest to the lowest, and the sorting of the nodes can be done directly at the catchment

level.

To avoid loss of water in local minima in the landscape, the water that flows toward a

local minimum is redirected to the lowest cell of a neighbor drainage basin that flows to

the base level (see Braun and Sambridge, 1997).

5.5 Example

To illustrate the numerical model for the surface processes, in Figures 5.5 and 5.6

is presented the simulation of the erosion of a plateau and the deposition of the eroded

material in the offshore domain. The parameters of the model are shown in Table 5.1.

At the beggining of the simulation (Figure 5.5), the plateau is at h = 2000 m and the

ocean bottom is at h = ?2000 m. The area of the model is 200×200 km2, and the model

configuration is presented at 0, 2, 4 and 6 Myr in the Figures 5.5 and 5.6.

During the process of erosion and the formation of incisions throughout the continent,

the sediments are transported to the coast. In each river mouth is observed the formation

of deltas that widen laterally and oceanward. The gradual deposition of the sediments

As the sea level is constant through time and there is no isostatic compensation or

thermal effect in this example, the continuos influx of sediments to the ocean results in

with a hierarchy of couplings and feedback mechanisms.

crust (FF ) and thinning of the lower crust during stretching (FS). Stretching also results

in advection of material that perturbs the thermal state of the lithosphere, which, in turn,

changes its density, resulting in additional vertical stress (FT ). Surface processes also in-

duce vertical stresses in the lithosphere (Fsp) by redistribution of mass associated with

erosion, transport and deposition of sediments. The flexural response of the lithosphere to

these loads results in vertical movement of the surface wt, perturbing the topography and

consequently the evolution of surface processes.

In the numerical model, stretching of the lithosphere perturbs the thermal state of

equation 4.1. This velocity field is used in the expression for the stiffness matrix K?a in

equation 3.17.

Thinning of the lower crust and consequent Moho uplift is governed by the same ad-

vection velocity as used for the thermal model (equation 4.1). The vertical load FS arising

from stretching and thinning of the lower crust is given by:

FS = (?m ??c) g?hcrust (6.2)

where ?hcrust is the variation of crustal thickness resulting from the stretching of the lower

crust and ?c is the density of the crust.

The flexural effect due to faulting of the upper crust is treated following the flexural

To simulate the relative movement between crustal blocks, the irregular surface mesh

must be updated and at specific times new points must be introduced.

Firstly, the mesh is divided into two regions (R1, R2) separated by a curve that repre-

sents the fault line, i.e. the intersection of the fault with the surface. The position of the

curve that represents the fault line in the x axis is function of y (xfault = xfault(y)) and

the direction of relative movement of blocks is in the x direction. A point xi belongs to

R1 if xi &amp;lt;xfault(yi), and to R2 if xi &gt; xfault(yi).

otwall and the nodes to the right be-

long to the hanging wall. After an ex-

tension Ef ? ?r (see section 5.3), new

nodes are added to the footwall block,

indicated in the figure as orange dots.

During the faulting the mesh is con-

tinuously updated, following the De-

launay triangulation.

Likewise the position of the fault line is updated relative to the footwall:

xfault ? xfault + Ef dips

After the relative movement between the two crustal blocks, the mesh is updated (Fi-

gure 6.5), verifying if the triangular mesh preserves the properties of a Delaunay triangu-

lation (see section 5.3.2).

During faulting and extension, the area Si of the Voronoi cells associated with the

nodes close the fault line increases. To ensure conservation of sediment volume in the cells

during faulting, the sediment thickness ?hsed is updated:

?hsed ? ?hsed
Si,previous
Si,actual

where Si,previous and Si,actual are the previous and actual area of the Voronoi cell i, respec-

tively.

When the extension Ef is equal to or exceeds the distance ?r (see section 5.3), new

nodes are added to preserve the node density of the mesh. The new nodes belong to

the footwall block, as shown in Figure 6.4c and the triangular mesh is updated with the

inclusion of the new nodes (Figure 6.5).

The elevation of the basement hbed for the new nodes is equal to the height of the fault

at this point (Figure 6.4c). On the other hand, the sediment thickness ?hsed is obtained

through linear interpolation of the sediment thickness of the neighbor cells. Finally the

elevation of the cell h is obtained by:

h = hbed + ?hsed.

To compute the vertical load Fsp resulting from a variation in topography ?h associated

density, for the sake of simplicity. With this approximation, the vertical load Fsp is

Fsp =

??cg?h if h + ?h &gt; hs.l. and h &gt; hs.l.

(6.4)

where ?w is water density and hs.l. is the sea level.

Surface topography is updated by adding the total vertical displacement wt of the

surface to the initial topography. This displacement is the sum of the components related

to faulting df (see section 4.3) and the flexural response of the upper crust and lithosphere,

respectively wF and w:

wt = w + wF + df.



Section 6.3. Flexure and isostatic compensation 97

Observe that ?h is the variation of topography related only to the surface processes of

erosion (?h &amp;lt;0) and deposition (?h &gt; 0). Therefore ?h is independent of the flexural

response of the lithosphere. On the other hand, the variation in topography ?h induces

vertical loads Fsp in the lithosphere which are regionally compensated by the lithosphere

resulting in a vertical displacement wt of the surface.

To calculate the vector load f for the flexural model (equation 2.20), the load Fsp from

the irregular mesh must be interpolated to the finite element mesh of the flexural model

(Figure 6.7a).

that loading in one cell is concentrated on the node at the center of the cell. The figure shows the five

cells that contribute with the load on the highlighted triangular element.

One strategy to rapidly calculate the load from the irregular mesh to the finite element

model is to assume that the load in each cell is concentrated on the node at the center of the

cell. This approximation avoids the calculation of all partial areas of the cells superposed

on the triangular elements.

Therefore, for a node i of the surface mesh inside the triangular element e (Figure 6.7b),

the contribution of the load of the cell i on the element e is (see equation 2.20)

area of the Voronoi cell i. For illustration, the element e in the Figure 6.7b is loaded by

five cells.

This approximation is reasonable for two reasons: Firstly the area of the finite elements

is relatively larger than the cell area. In the illustration of Figure 6.7b the ratio between

element area and the cell area is nearly 4.5, but in the numerical models presented in this

work, this ratio is around 20. Secondly the flexural rigidity of the plate tends to smooth

the effect of local variation of the load.

After the solution of the flexural equation, the deflection of the plate is interpolated to

the irregular mesh:

wi = wt1L1 + wt2L2 + wt3L3

where wi is the interpolated deflection in the node i, wt1, wt2 and wt3 are the deflections at

the nodes of the finite element e, and L1, L2 and L3 are the areal coordinates (see section

2.3) for the element e at the point (xi,yi).

6.4 The “water load delay” algorithm

The isostatic term in the equation for the flexural isostasy is usually described as

dependent on the difference of density ?? between the asthenosphere and the fluid at the

surface displaced during the isostatic adjustment of the plate.

For example, during erosion of the continents, the isostatic response of the lithosphere

displaces the air. As the density of the air is negligible, the difference of density ?? is equal

to the density of the asthenosphere (?? = ?m ??air = ?m). But the isostatic response of

the lithosphere to sedimentation in the offshore basins results in subsidence that is filled

with water, amplifying the subsidence. In this case the density of the water is not negligible

and ?? = ?m??w. Therefore, the value of ?? depends whether the isostatic compensation

is subaerial or submarine. Since the position of the shoreline changes through time during

the simulation of the surface processes, ?? is dependent on time and space.

The stiffness matrix K in equation 2.8 for the flexural problem is dependent on the

isostatic term, implying that the stiffness matrix must be rewritten every time ?? is

modified, which is time consuming.

To avoid the modification of K due to variations in ??, in the present work the bu-



Section 6.4. The “water load delay” algorithm 99

oyancy term is treated as dependent only on the density of the asthenosphere ?m and the

additional load associated with variations of the water layer during isostatic compensation

is incorporated in the load q? in equation 2.9.

To illustrate this procedure, consider equation 2.1 with the isostatic term shown expli-

citly:

(L?)TDL?w + ??gw = q? (6.5)

In the submarine domain ?? = ?m ??w. Therefore:

(L?)TDL?w + ?mgw = q? + ?wgw (6.6)

In equation 6.6 the last term is the additional water load related to the isostatic compen-

sation of the plate to the load q?. Clearly the water load cannot be treated explicitly as the

load for the equation, because it depends on the solution w of the equation. One approxi-

mation is to use the known water load of the previous time step ?wgwt??t to calculate the

new deflection wt:

(L?)TDL?wt + ?mgwt = q? + ?wgwt??t (6.7)

In this expression, the isostatic term is dependent only on the density of the asthenosphere

?m and the stiffness matrix K does not need to be rewritten every time step. This appro-

ximation is named here as the “water load delay” approximation.

Observe that the equation 6.7 is applicable to the onshore domain if the last term is

omitted.

To show that this new approximation for the isostatic compensation presented in equa-

tion 6.7 converges to the exact solution, an analytical proof is given in Appendix B.

Chapter 7

Application of the model to natural examples

Models can be confirmed by the demonstration of

agreement between observation and prediction,

but confirmation is inherently partial.

(Oreskes et al., 1994)

The following sections present the application of the numerical models described in

the previous chapters to natural examples. In the first section, the model is applied to

study how different rift styles influence the evolution of escarpments in divergent margins.

The main result from this work is that the position of the drainage divide is strongly

dependent on the amount of extension in the rifted margin. Moreover, the models show

that the retreating escarpment scenario is unlikely when the lower crust under the rift flank

is substantially stretched. These results are applied to study the evolution of the margins

in Southeastern Australia and Southeastern Brazil. In the second section, the model is

used to study the influence of post-rift thermal anomalies at the base of the lithosphere

and how the stratigraphic sequence is affected by isostatic response of the lithosphere to

the transient thermal anomaly. As an example, a possible influence of the passage of the

Trindade Plume on the marginal basins of Campos and Espirito Santo is discussed.

It is important to highlight that the conclusions of the present work are based on the

results of numerical models that represent a simplification of the real world. Certainly,

many other processes may affect the evolution of the margin. However, the proposed

integrated numerical models quantify the relative influence of flexure, thermal effects,

stretching styles and surface processes on the evolution of different tectonic scenarios,

keeping in mind that the “primary value of models is heuristic” (Oreskes et al., 1994).



102 Chapter 7. Application of the model to natural examples

7.1 The influence of rifting on escarpment migration1

7.1.1 Abstract

Using numerical models that couple surface processes, flexural isostasy, faulting and

the thermal effects of rifting, we show that fault-bounded escarpments created at rift

flanks by mechanical unloading and flexural rebound have little potential to “survive” as

retreating escarpments if the lower crust under the rift flank is substantially stretched.

In this configuration, a drainage divide that persists through time appears landward of

the initial escarpment in a position close to a secondary bulge that is created during

the rifting event at a distance that depends on the flexural rigidity of the upper crust.

Moreover, the migration of the escarpment to the secondary bulge occurs when the pre-rift

topography dips landward, otherwise the evolution of the escarpment is guided by the

pre-existing inland drainage divide. To illustrate this new mechanism for the evolution

of passive margins, we study the examples of Southeastern Australia and Southeastern

Brazil. We propose that a pre-existing inland drainage divide with rift related flank uplift

can produce the double drainage divide observed in Southeastern Australia. On the other

hand, we conclude that it is possible that the Serra do Mar escarpments on the Southeastern

Brazilian margin originated as a secondary flexural bulge during rifting that persisted

through time. In both cases, the retreating escarpment scenario is unlikely and the present-

day margin morphology can be explained as resulting from rift-related vertical motions

alone, without requiring significant post-rift “rejuvenation”.

7.1.2 Introduction

Many rifted margins around the world are flanked by great escarpments, i.e. up to 1500-

m high topographic steps subparallel to the coast that separate high-elevation continental

interior plateaux from low-elevation coastal regions. These escarpments are observed along

both young and old rifted margins (e.g. the Red Sea escarpment bordering a 30-25 Ma

continental margin; the Serra do Mar escarpment along the 140-130 Ma Southeastern

1This section is part of the submitted article of Sacek, Braun, and van der Beek (2011). The manuscript

of this section was maintained in the active voice, as in the original paper. The numerical model described

in the Chapters 2 to 6 is briefly reintroduced in this section to maintain the logical structure of the original

manuscript.



Section 7.1. The influence of rifting on escarpment migration 103

Brazilian margin; and the Great Escarpment of Southeastern Australia escarpment where

rifting occurred at 100-80 Ma).

Many authors have demonstrated that the evolution and persistence of these escarp-

ments through geological time is the result of the combined effect of erosion and the flexural

isostatic response of the lithosphere to stretching and rifting (Braun and Beaumont, 1989;

Gilchrist and Summerfield, 1990; Kooi and Beaumont, 1994; Tucker and Slingerland, 1994).

Although these mechanisms successfully explain the persistence of escarpments, their post-

rift evolution remains controversial (Braun and van der Beek, 2004), as different initial

conditions for the margin may result in very different denudation histories, while leading

to similar present-day morphologies (Gilchrist et al., 1994; Gallagher and Brown, 1999;

Braun and van der Beek, 2004). Moreover, many geomorphologists remain convinced that

high-elevation rifted margins require some form of post-rift reactivation (e.g. Partridge and

Maud, 1987; Ollier and Pain, 1994; Japsen et al., 2006; Burke and Gunnell, 2008). Finally,

topographic patterns may be complexified by local structural and/or lithological controls

(e.g. van der Beek et al., 2001; Gunnell and Harbor, 2010).

Gilchrist et al. (1994), Kooi and Beaumont (1994) and van der Beek et al. (2002) de-

monstrated the importance of the position of a preexisting drainage divide on the evolution

of the escarpment, highlighting two possible denudation scenarios: the escarpment-retreat

scenario, where the original escarpment is the main drainage divide after rifting and re-

mains the divide during post-breakup escarpment evolution; and the plateau-degradation

scenario, where the initial drainage divide is located landward of the margin. In the

first scenario, the escarpment migrates continuously landward as the headwaters of the

seaward-draining rivers cut back into the plateau at the escarpment top, whereas in the

second scenario the inland drainage divide remains stationary and the original escarpment,

near the coast, is eroded away and is progressively replaced by an escarpment pinned at

the preexisting inland divide.

In the above models, it was assumed that the existence and location of a preexisting

inland divide are set by external factors; i.e. the initial topography is a relict from previous

tectonic, magmatic or geomorphic events, unrelated to the rifting process. These results

were based on landscape evolution models that do not take the development of offshore

basins and the kinematics associated with rifting and breakup into account. Other models



104 Chapter 7. Application of the model to natural examples

(e.g. Pazzaglia and Gardner, 1994; van Balen et al., 1995) simulated the post-rift evolu-

tion of margins to study the interaction of onshore and offshore processes, considering the

flexural response of the lithosphere to erosion and deposition. On the other hand, qualita-

tive models have been proposed to explain the formation of an inland drainage divide in

response to underplating during rifting, resulting in crustal thickening and uplift of the to-

pography (e.g Lister et al., 1986; Lister and Etheridge, 1989). More recent thermo-dynamic

modelling has shown that this style of rifting is feasible (Huismans and Beaumont, 2003).

In this work we present the results of a new numerical model for the evolution of

rifted margins that combines surface processes, flexural isostasy and the kinematic effects

of both faulting of the upper crust and stretching of the lithosphere. The novelty of our

approach is that it combines the effects of these processes to predict the evolution of the

margin’s morphology since the onset of extension. We show that even when the initial

drainage divide is close to the margin, the effect of crustal thinning and the subsequent

thermal subsidence of the margin naturally creates a secondary drainage divide in an

inland position, the location of which essentially depends on the flexural rigidity of the

crust and lithosphere. Under some circumstances, the system may evolve in such a way

that the final escarpment position coincides with the secondary divide, similar to the

plateau degradation scenario mentioned above. We apply our model to two case studies

on the Southeastern Brazilian and Southeastern Australian margins, to assess how much

of the overall margin topography can be explained by our model, without recourse to post-

rifting tectonic “rejuvenation” of the margins or local structural or lithologic control. Our

approach is therefore to explore in how much rifted margin topography can be explained

in a systemic manner and what aspects would require conjectural explanations.

7.1.3 The numerical model

The processes acting during and after rifting are numerous, complex and often inter-

connected. They include stretching and faulting in the lithosphere, which will induce a

strong perturbation to its thermal structure. The rift and the post-rift stages of the margin

evolution are affected by thermal effects, flexure and isostatic compensation that determine

the amplitude and rate of change of surface subsidence and uplift. Concomitantly, surface

processes act to transport mass at the surface of the Earth to create landforms and also



Section 7.1. The influence of rifting on escarpment migration 105

affect the isostatic balance of the lithosphere.

These processes result in a set of competing forces as shown in Figure 6.1. Stretching

of the lithosphere reshapes the surface by faulting and alters the flexural isostatic state of

the lithosphere due to horizontal movement of density interfaces, creating vertical forces

related to faulting of the upper crust (FF ) and thinning of the lower crust during stretching

(FS). Stretching also results in advection of material that perturbs the thermal state of the

lithosphere, which, in turn, changes its density, resulting in vertical forces, which we name

FT . Surface processes also induce vertical forces in the lithosphere (Fsp) by redistribution of

mass associated with erosion, transport and deposition of sediments. The flexural response

of the lithosphere to these loads results in vertical movement of the surface wt, perturbing

the topography and consequently the evolution of surface processes.

To quantify the complex interactions between there various processes we have develo-

ped a numerical model. In the following lines, we describe each process in detail together

with its numerical implementation.

Flexure and isostasy

To simulate the response of the lithosphere to vertical loading, we consider regional

isostatic compensation using the thin elastic plate approximation

Equation 7.1 is solved numerically using the finite-element method; a complete des-

cription of this implementation is given in Sacek and Ussami (2009). Note that this finite-

element formulation can include effects arising from spatial variations in flexural rigidity.

Thermal model

The thermal evolution of the lithosphere is obtained by solving the three-dimensional

heat-transfer equation

?c

= ?· (k?T) (7.2)

where T is temperature, ? is density, c is heat capacity, k is conductivity and v =

(uadv,vadv,wadv) is the advection velocity.

The advection velocity v describes the velocity of rock particles during stretching of

the lithosphere. To simulate the upwelling divergent flow associated with the divergence of

conjugate rift margins and stretching of the lower part of the lithosphere near the center

of the rift, we assume that v is the solution to the classical corner-flow problem, which is

given by (Fletcher et al., 2009):

Ux is the half-spreading horizontal velocity at the surface and Uz is the axial vertical

velocity at x = 0, the center of the rift.

Equation 7.2 is solved using the finite element method following the formulation of

Braun (2003). The temperatures of the top and bottom of the thermal model are main-

tained at constant values (Table 7.1).

The vertical load FT associated with any perturbation of temperature ?T from the

initial geothermal gradient and the associated density variation is given by:

FT =

? 0
?aL

?m [?T ?T] gdz (7.4)

where ?T is the thermal expansion coefficient and aL is the initial thickness of the lithosphere

(see Table 7.1).

Stretching of the lithosphere

Stretching of the lithosphere is assumed to be accommodated by planar faults in the

upper crust and ductile flow in the lower crust and mantle.

Thinning of the lower crust and consequent Moho uplift is governed by the same ad-

vection velocity as used for the thermal model (equation 7.3). The vertical force FS arising

from stretching and thinning of the lower crust is given by:

FS = (?m ??c) g?hcrust (7.5)

where ?hcrust is the variation of crustal thickness resulting from the stretching of the lower

crust and ?c is the density of the crust.

To simulate movement along faults in the upper crust, we use the flexural cantilever

model of Kusznir et al. (1991). Although we adopted the flexural cantilever model to

reproduce the flexural response of the upper crust during the rift, there is no consensus

about the predominant rheological behavior of the upper crust during rifting. Studying

the mechanisms responsible for the development of rift flanks in the Baikal rift, SE Siberia,

van der Beek (1997), for instance, concluded that plastic behavior of the upper crust is

more important than assumed by the flexural cantilever model. On the other hand, the

flexural cantilever model was successfully used to describe the geometry of grabens and

crustal block rotation with wavelengths of a few kilometers, as observed in many rifted

regions (e.g Kusznir and Ziegler, 1992; van Wees and Cloetingh, 1994; Nadin and Kusznir,

1995; Kusznir et al., 2004).

We therefore introduce an effective elastic thickness for the upper crust, Te,uc, which

does not necessarily coincide with Te, the elastic thickness of the entire lithosphere. By

using two different values for Te, we introduce the possibility to reproduce the superposition

of different flexural responses to deformation and/or loading, as observed for example in

the East African rift system, where van Wees and Cloetingh (1994) obtained a value of



108 Chapter 7. Application of the model to natural examples

Te = 3 ? 5 km in trying to reproduce basement geometry with a 3-D flexural model

whilst Ebinger et al. (1991) obtained Te = 21 km in the same area fitting gravity data.

It is commonly assumed (Burov and Diament, 1995) that low Te values account for the

flexural behavior of the upper crust, whereas high Te values reflect the regional response

of the subcrustal lithosphere. The use of two different flexural rigidities for the same

region implies that the upper crust is partly decoupled from the subcrustal lithosphere by

a ductile lower crust. This condition can be satisfied when the crust is thick and/or has

a high geothermal gradient (Burov and Diament, 1995; Brown and Phillips, 2000). From

the analysis of yield-strength envelopes for different thermal ages and crustal thickness,

Burov and Diament (1995) showed that the lithosphere is practically always decoupled

for crustal thickness &gt; 35 km, independent of the thermal age of the lithosphere (see

Figure 4b in Burov and Diament, 1995). The two margins studied in this work in Section

5.2 are developed on relatively thick crust. Receiver function analysis for Southeastern

Brazil showed crustal thicknesses between 35 and 43 km close to the coast (Assumpc?a?o

et al., 2002). Likewise, Southeastern Australia presents thick crust from receiver function

analysis, between 34 and 52 km (Clitheroe et al., 2000).

In the formulation of Kusznir et al. (1991), extension of the upper crust is accom-

modated by planar faults. Considering an amount of extension Ef of the upper crust

accommodated by a planar fault dipping at an angle ? (Figure 4.5), the vertical displace-

ment df of the surface relative to the footwall, in the absence of gravity, is

df =

??
? 0 if the point is on the footwall?Ef · tan ? if the point is on the hangingwall

To restore isostatic equilibrium (Figure 4.5c), a buoyancy force FF given by

FF = ??cgdf (7.6)

has to be added to the isostatic balance. Assuming that the upper crust has finite rigidity

during faulting, the flexural response wF of the upper crust to the force FF is given by:

(L?)TDucL?wF + ?cgwF = FF (7.7)

where Duc is the flexural rigidity of the upper crust, i.e. dependent of Te,uc. The final

configuration is shown in Figure 4.5d.

Surface processes

Surface processes are taken into account following the methodology of Braun and Sam-

bridge (1997). The main advantage of this approach, based on an irregular discretization

of surface topography, is that it is possible to accurately simulate the relative horizontal

movement of crustal blocks at finite rates, i.e. without the loss of short-wavelength features

that is inherent to other approaches based on interpolation of the topography.

Onshore processes are divided into fluvial and hillslope processes. Fluvial processes of

erosion, transport and sedimentation are modeled following the formulation of Beaumont

et al. (1992) where local variations in topography h are described through a first-order

reaction equation:

?h

?t
= ?

q
eqb
f ? qf
Lf

where q
eqb
f is the maximum sediment transport capacity, qf is the sediment flux per unit

width [L2T?1] and Lf is a parameter with dimension of [L]. q
eqb
f in a channel takes the

following form:

q
eqb
f = kfqr|?h|

where kf is the erosional coefficient due to the fluvial process, qr is water discharge and

|?h| is the modulus of topographic gradient. The water discharge is calculated by spatially

integrating net precipitation rate vR, which is assumed uniform in space and time for

simplicity. There are different expressions for q
eqb
f in the literature, where the exponents

of qr and |?h| are not equal to one (see Braun, 2006). We assume that these variations

in the value of the exponents of qr and |?h| are of secondary importance for the present

work, since the general drainage pattern and the position of the drainage divides will not

be significantly modified by varying the exponents (see Figure 9 in Tucker and Whipple,

2002).

Hillslope processes are modeled through a linear diffusion equation, assuming that

transport is linearly proportional to slope (see Dietrich et al., 2003, and references therein):

?h

?t
= ?· (kd?h)

where kd is the coefficient of diffusive transport. van der Beek and Braun (1998) showed

that there is no theoretical basis for including hillslope diffusion in large spatial-scale

models. In effect the dominant process in the onshore domain in our numerical simulations



110 Chapter 7. Application of the model to natural examples

is fluvial transport and the evolution of the landscape is not significantly modified if we do

not include hillslope diffusion. On the other hand, the incorporation of hillslope diffusion

can improve the stability of the surface-process simulation for different time steps and grid

size, by avoiding exceedingly steep links between grid cells.

For the offshore transport of sediments we used the methodology of van Balen et al.

(1995), based on the same principle as for diffusion processes on land, but with a non-linear

diffusion coefficient, km:
?h

?t
= ?· (km?h)

In this simple model, the diffusivity km decreases exponentially with water depth, simula-

ting the decrease in energy available for sediment transport with increasing water depth:

km = k
?
m exp

(
h?hs.l.
h0

)
k?m is a constant [L

2T?1], hs.l. is sea level and h0 is a characteristic length (Table 7.1).

To compute the vertical load Fsp resulting from a variation in topography ?h associated

with surface processes we assume that sediment density, ?s, is equal to crustal rock density,

for the sake of simplicity. With this approximation, we obtain the following relationship:

Fsp =

????????
???????

??cg?h + ?wg?h if h + ?h &amp;lt;hs.l. and h &amp;lt;hs.l.
??cg?h + ?wg (hs.l. ?h) if h + ?h &gt; hs.l. and h &amp;lt;hs.l.
??cg?h + ?wg (h + ?h?hs.l.) if h + ?h &amp;lt;hs.l. and h &gt; hs.l.
??cg?h if h + ?h &gt; hs.l. and h &gt; hs.l.

(7.8)

where ?w is water density.

Surface topography is updated by adding the total vertical displacement wt of the

surface to the initial topography. This displacement is the sum of the components related

to faulting df and the flexural response of the upper crust and lithosphere, respectively

wF and w:

wt = w + wF + df.

Note that ?h is the variation of topography related only to the surface processes of

erosion (?h &amp;lt;0) and deposition (?h &gt; 0). Therefore ?h is independent of the flexural

response of the lithosphere. On the other hand, the variation in topography ?h induces

vertical loads Fsp, which are regionally compensated by the lithosphere resulting in a

vertical displacement w of the surface.

7.1.4 Model setup

In our model setup, we introduce a series of faults (Figure 7.1) dipping towards the

center (axis) of the rift, as observed in most natural settings (Salveson, 1978). The number

of faults (five in our model) is of little importance; they are meant to represent distribu-

ted brittle deformation. The faults are activated progressively from I to V, simulating a

widening of the rift zone in the early stages of development of the rift; they all dip at

an angle equal to ? = 45? and the extension per fault is Ef = 4 km, resulting in a fault

heave |df| = Ef · tan ? = 4 km. The especific value of ? and Ef is not very important and

different combinations of ? and Ef can result in the same fault heave |df|, which is the

parameter that principally controls the flexural response of the upper crust during faulting

in the flexural cantilever model (see equation 7.6). In the lower part of the model, we

impose the velocity field described in equation 7.3, to accommodate the relative movement

of the lithosphere at a velocity Ux relative to the axis of the upwelling-divergent flow.

The initial dimensions of the model are 200 km (width) × 600 km (length), and the

mean distance between the nodes in the surface-processes model is 5 km.

Previous works that did not take into account the influence of rifting on the evolution of

the landscape (e.g Kooi and Beaumont, 1994) concluded that an initial coastal escarpment

adjoining a horizontal or landward-dipping plateau evolves as a retreating escarpment.

To assess if this conclusion is valid when stretching and thinning of the lithosphere is

considered during the simulation, we use an initial topography that is similar to that used



112 Chapter 7. Application of the model to natural examples

in other modeling studies of passive margin escarpments, and that consists of a gently

landward dipping surface described here by the following expression:

h(t = 0) = 500.0 × cos
(

?x

8.0 × 105

)
+ 1500.0 (7.9)

where x is in meters. In short, the topography decreases monotonically from 2500 m on

the left-hand side of the model to just below 1150 m on the right-hand side, over a distance

of 600 km.

The values of the model parameters are given in Table 7.1. They correspond to com-

monly accepted values for most parameters. We will vary the value of four model parame-

ters; the effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere Te and of the upper crust Te,uc, the

erosional parameter kf , and the initial position Ludf of the axis of the upwelling-divergent

flow relative to the position of fault V (Figure 7.1). Note that the distance Ludf also defines

the position of the region of significant crustal thinning. Thus, moving the initial position

of the axis of the upwelling-divergent flow will in fact control the offset between the final

position of the zone of lower crustal thinning and the position of the faults. We also assume

that the region where x &amp;lt;Ludf , which, over the duration of the model, evolves to become

significantly stretched, is characterized by a low effective elastic thickness (Te = Te,uc),

simulating a decrease in rigidity due to rifting. All other parameters have constant values

in all model runs, which are shown in Table 7.1.

7.1.5 Results

We first present the results of a model experiment in which the initial position of the

upwelling flow is close to the faults (Ludf = ?15 km), resulting in thinning of the lower

crust just under the faulted region. The solution is shown in Figures 7.2 and 7.3 as a set

of snap shots at 12 time intervals in the evolution of the model. The other parameters of

Model 1 are shown in Table 7.2.

During the first 1 Myr of the simulation (Figure 7.2), the faults I-V are progressively

activated and the lithosphere experiences a total extension of 20 km. After this, the faults

are locked, but the lithosphere on the left-hand side of the model continues its movement

relative to the axis of the upwelling-divergent flow and, consequently, the lower crust is

thinned as a consequence of stretching. In this simulation, we assume that continued

stretching of the upper crust and final breakup occur in a position outside the model, to

simulate continued margin formation.

We observe that during stretching of the upper crust (i.e. active faulting), the region

just inland of the active fault-escarpment experiences subsidence as indicated by the black

arrows in Figure 7.2. This subsidence separates the escarpment from a secondary drainage

divide that has formed landward of the initial escarpment (red arrows in Figure 7.2). This

evolution of the topography is a result of the flexural response to normal faulting and

corresponds to the development of a secondary depression and bulge landward of the rift

axis. The position of this secondary bulge relative to the escarpment depends on the

effective elastic thickness of the crust. An analytical solution of the flexural cantilever

model (Vening-Meinesz, 1950) exists for a single fault:

Section 7.1. The influence of rifting on escarpment migration 117

The analytical solution also gives the difference in elevation h2 (Figure 7.4a) between the

secondary bulge and the adjacent secondary depression; its value is ?7% of wmax, the

maximum elevation of the primary rift flank. Thus the secondary depression and adjacent

bulge are a logical consequence of the flexural response to rift faulting. Its amplitude

is small because of the exponential decrease of the amplitude of the deflection but the

difference in height between the secondary high and low is certainly not negligible. Note

that the formation of an inland drainage divide occurs when the initial topography is

sloping landward or is flat. If the initial topography slopes seaward from a preexisting

inland drainage divide, the formation of the depression during faulting will not contribute

to the formation of a new inland drainage divide.

For the value of upper-crustal elastic thickness that we have chosen (Te,uc = 5 km),

the position of the secondary drainage divide should, theoretically, be at x2 ? 111 km.

However, this analytical solution assumes that the preexisting topography is horizontal.

For a sloping initial topography, the position of the secondary drainage divide can move by

several tens of kilometers, depending on the assumed initial slope. In our example, with

the geometric distribution of the faults as shown in Figure 7.1 and the initial topography

described by equation 7.9, the analytical position of the second drainage divide is x?2 ? 85

km.

With continued stretching and thinning of the lower crust, the region seaward of the

secondary bulge subsides. Through the combined effect of erosion and thermal subsidence,

the initial escarpment adjacent to the faults rapidly vanishes (i.e., within 20 Myr after

rifting) and the main topographic relief that persists through time is the drainage divide

created landward by the formation of the secondary bulge (Figure 7.3). Further in the

development of the model run, the region that was occupied by the initial escarpment con-

tinues to be eroded and progressively subsides, finally crossing the base level and becoming

inundated near the end of the model run.

These processes are summarized in Figure 7.4b. Because of its high relief, the coastal

escarpment is rapidly eroded. Incision of the adjacent axial river, located between the

coastal escarpment and the secondary bulge, tends to isolate the coastal escarpment. Mo-

reover, thinning of the lower crust and cooling of the lithosphere result in subsidence of the

margin (vertical arrows in Figure 7.4b), but with decreasing amplitude landwards. The

combination of rapid erosion of the coastal escarpment and differential subsidence of the

margin favors the emergence of the secondary bulge and its establishment as the main,

“permanent” drainage-divide escarpment, while the coastal escarpment progressively di-

sappears. Note that a necessary condition for the formation of the secondary divide is that

there is preexisting topography and rifting thus leads to a base-level drop. If the preexis-

ting elevation was at sea level, just the initial fault-controlled escarpment will be eroded.

Therefore, the persistence of escarpments requires a preexisting high-standing topography,

in accord with previous findings (Tucker and Slingerland, 1994; Kooi and Beaumont, 1994).

If we displace the initial position of the axis of the upwelling flow far from the zone

of imposed faulting at Ludf = ?115 km (100 km seaward relative to the first model), the

evolution of the margin is dramatically different (Figure 7.5, Model 2). In this situation,



Section 7.1. The influence of rifting on escarpment migration 119

thinning is almost insignificant under the faulted region and, consequently, the ensuing

thermal subsidence of the lithosphere in this zone is negligible. As a result, the initial

escarpment created close to fault V remains the main drainage divide throughout the

numerical experiment. This result clearly demonstrates that, together with the slope of the

pre-rift topography dipping toward the interior of the continent, the combination of uplift

of the secondary bulge and differential thermal subsidence is responsible for the migration

of the main drainage divide towards the secondary bulge in the previous experiment.

If we consider the evolution of Model 2 in more detail, we notice that the high to-

pography related to the intermediate faults II-IV is progressively eroded away and the

morphological signature of the half-graben structures disappears. Most of the sedimenta-

tion occurs just seaward of fault I, because it is only in this region of the model that the

lower crust has been sufficiently stretched to produce subsidence and the ensuing accom-

modation space.

To compare the evolution of relief in both model experiments, we divided the margin

in strips of 5 km, parallel to the rift axis, and calculated the mean topographic relief in

each of these. Relief is defined here as the maximum elevation difference between adjacent

nodes. Results are shown in Figures 7.3 and 7.5, where green lines correspond to strips

where mean relief is &gt; 300 m for the first model experiment (Figure 7.3) and red lines for

the second model experiment (Figure 7.5). The regions of high relief are plotted together in

Figure 7.6, which also shows the analytical position of the secondary bulge x?2 for Te,uc = 5

km. This figure summarizes the relief evolution of both models. We observe that in Model

1 (Ludf = ?15 km, green lines) the high relief of the primary rift flank rapidly vanishes

and another region of high relief (a new escarpment) appears close to the secondary bulge

at x?2, and progressively retreats toward the interior of the continent. It is interesting to

observe that the region between the primary and secondary escarpments does not present

substantial relief during the evolution of the margin. The coastal escarpment has not

migrated continuously landward, but has reappeared in its new position. For Model 2,

with little thinning of the lower crust below the initial escarpment (Ludf = ?115 km,

red lines in Figure 7.6) the rift shoulder remains the main escarpment during the entire

simulation and significantly less escarpment migration takes place than in the previous

model.

calculated analytically.

To demonstrate further that the position of the secondary, inland escarpment is con-

trolled by that of the secondary flexural bulge, we have run a series of experiments in which

the erosion rate was artificially reduced (by decreasing kfvR to 0.001 m/year). In this way,

the positions of the various drainage divides are less perturbed by erosion. In Figure 7.7 we

present different simulations with reduced erosion. A similar pattern of escarpment evolu-

tion is nonetheless observed, as shown in the relief-evolution diagrams. In every diagram

of Figure 7.7 the model experiments with Ludf = ?15 km (green lines) are characterized

by a secondary escarpment originating very close to the secondary flexural bulge at x?2,

while in the model experiments with Ludf = ?115 km (red lines) the escarpment remains

close to the rift-bounding fault.

The effective elastic thickness of the upper crust Te,uc clearly controls the initial position

of the new escarpment at the secondary bulge, which is, on the other hand, relatively

insensitive to the effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere Te. Te plays a secondary role

by controlling the retreat rate of the escarpment, as indicated by the arrows in Figure 7.7:

for the same values of Te,uc and Ludf , the retreat rate is positively correlated with Te. This

behavior was also observed by Kooi and Beaumont (1994) and is related to the wavelength

and amplitude of the flexural isostatic response of the lithosphere to unloading; escarpment

retreat is hindered by efficient isostatic uplift in response to erosional unloading (i.e. low

Te) because this leads to stronger landward tilting of the region adjacent to the escarpment.

In Figure 7.7 we also show an intermediate model experiment where Ludf = ?65 km

(orange lines). In the model runs with Te,uc = 5 km (Figure 7.7a and b), the intermediate

model also generates an inland escarpment, but it develops at a later time relative to the

model runs with Ludf = ?15 km. Moreover, in this intermediate model run, high relief

close to the fault is preserved for a longer time than for the model runs with Ludf = ?15

km. On the other hand, the intermediate models with Te,uc = 10 km (Figure 7.7c and d)

do not generate an inland escarpment. This is because the primary flank uplift, next to

the faults, is broader due to the higher rigidity of the upper crust, and therefore erodes

less efficiently and survives for a longer time as the main drainage divide.

7.1.6 Discussion

7.1.6.1 Condition for migration of the drainage divide

As highlighted in the previous section, the primary condition for long-term preservation

of an escarpment is the pre-existence of topography. This condition is necessary both in

the retreating escarpment scenario and in the pinned divide one. Taking into account this

condition, the present model provides a new mechanism for the development of an inland

escarpment that retreats only slowly.

The migration of the escarpment from the flank uplift to the inland position depends

on the amount of thinning of the crust during lithospheric stretching. In Figure 7.8 we

present crustal stretching factor profiles for the models with Ludf = ?15, -65 and -115 km.

In the numerical models, the formation of the inland escarpment occurred for Ludf = ?15

and -65 km (see Figure 7.7), which are related to maximum ?crust values of 1.58 and 1.19

near the flank uplift, respectively (Figure 7.8). Therefore, migration of the escarpment can

be produced even for small values of ?crust and is also promoted by low crustal rigidity

(Figure 7.7). Note that although the effect seems to be controlled by the magnitude

of crustal stretching near the fault, it is in fact the lateral variation in the lower crustal

thinning parameter, with ?crust decreasing landwards and producing differential subsidence

of the margin, that plays the fundamental role in producing lateral displacement of the

7.1.6.2 Comparison with natural examples

In the following sections we compare our theoretical results with natural escarpments.

We consider two examples, one from the southeastern Australian Great Escarpment, the

other from the Serra do Mar in southeastern Brazil.

7.1.6.3 Southeastern Highlands of Australia

In Southeastern Australia, the coastal escarpment is located some 20-50 km from the

present-day coastline and the offshore structure is composed of a narrow sediment-starved

oblique margin (Shaw, 1990). The coastal escarpment separates the low lying coastal strip

from a 600-m high plateau and forms a local drainage divide. The main drainage divide

of the Southeastern Highlands is located 50-100 km landward of the coastal escarpment

(Figure 7.9c). Between the escarpment and the inland drainage divide, several rivers flow

subparallel to the escarpment (e.g. van der Beek and Braun, 1998, 1999). van der Beek and

Braun (1999) proposed that this morphology is best explained by the existence of an inland

drainage divide predating the rifting episode, which took place 90-100 Ma, at the present-

day location of the drainage divide and that the escarpment did not evolve by retreat from

the coast to its present-day position, but formed in-place by erosion of the coastal areas



Section 7.1. The influence of rifting on escarpment migration 125

soon after rifting. These conclusions are consistent with low-temperature thermochrono-

logy data (Moore et al., 1986; Dumitru et al., 1991; O’Sullivan et al., 1996; Persano et al.,

2002), although, due to the relatively small amounts of exhumation experienced along the

escarpment, the interpretation of this data remains somewhat equivocal (Braun and van

der Beek, 2004). A large body of geomorphologic work has consistently shown that de-

nudation rates are low and drainage networks of the Southeastern Highlands have been

stable throughout the Cenozoic, excluding significant post-breakup tectonic modification

of the margin (cf. Bishop and Goldrick, 2000, for a review).

There are two ways in which the modeling work presented here could explain the

present-day topography of southeastern Australia. The first, most obvious interpretation

is to consider that the present-day escarpment formed as the primary rift flank during

rifting and that the inland drainage divide formed as the secondary bulge, later amplified

by erosion of the coastal areas and the regions between the two divides, where the rivers

run parallel to the escarpment.

As shown in the models with Ludf = ?65 km in Figure 7.7a and b, the inland and

the coastal regions of high relief can coexist for a long time (&gt; 100 Myr), with the main

rivers between them running parallel to the escarpment, producing a morphology that

resembles the eastern highlands in Australia. Moreover, the distance between the coastal

escarpment and the inland drainage divide of southeastern Australia is of the same order

as the distance between the initial escarpment and the secondary bulge in the numerical

models.

To better illustrate this point, we ran another model experiment (Figure 7.9a, Model

3) for which we used low effective elastic thickness values for the lithosphere (Te = 10

km), which is likely to be applicable for the southeastern Australian margin, as discussed

in Braun and van der Beek (2004). After 90 Myr, the numerical model results present

an inland drainage divide that has formed at the location of the secondary bulge, and an

initial escarpment that has persisted near the coast, similar to the southeastern Australia

escarpment.

However, this scenario is inconsistent with the observations on two points: first, the

present-day escarpment is clearly erosional rather than tectonic in origin (e.g. Bishop and

Goldrick (2000) and references therein), but in our numerical model the escarpment is

Section 7.1. The influence of rifting on escarpment migration 127

associated with the rift flank adjacent to the main basin-bounding fault and has retreated

only a short distance. Second, the main drainage divide appears to be an old feature that

has been in place at least since the onset of rifting. The SE Australian drainage divide is

associated with a strongly negative Bouguer anomaly (Young, 1989), implying a thick crust

under this region that isostatically sustains the high topography. Although the timing of

crustal thickening is not known, it is possibly related to Paleozoic active-margin tectonics

(Lambeck and Stephenson, 1986; van der Beek et al., 1999) or crustal thickening due to

underplating during rifting (Lister et al., 1986).

The second, more likely interpretation is to follow the suggestion made by van der

Beek and Braun (1999), who consider the main inland divide to be a pre-existing feature.

We thus propose that a pre-existing inland drainage divide combined with rift-related

flank uplift can produce the double drainage divide observed in Southeastern Australia.

Furthermore, the peripheral subsidence created during rift-flank uplift (Figure 7.4) can

enhance the double drainage divide pattern, separating the inland drainage divide and the

rift flank. To illustrate this idea, we designed a new model that considers an initial inland

divide; the evolution of this model is shown in Figure 7.9b. In this model, after the faulting

stage, the rift flank retreats ? 60 km landward, approaching the inland divide. Note that

in this case the permanence of the landward-retreating rift flank through time results from

the low stretching factor of the crust under the rift flank during and after rifting. While

the rift flank retreats landward, the inland divide remains at roughly the same position

through time. The uplift of the rift flank and the peripheral subsidence locally changes

the drainage pattern and promotes rivers flowing parallel to the inland divide and the

retreating rift flank in the region between the two (Figure 7.9b, at 90 Myr). The model of

Figure 7.9b combines two models studied by van der Beek and Braun (1999): the flank-

uplift and the inclined-plateau model. In their work, they analyzed separately the effect of

rift-flank uplift and a pre-existing seaward-sloping plateau on landscape evolution. They

concluded that only the inclined plateau model can produce the double drainage divide

configuration as observed in Southeastern Australia, but only for very small values of the

dip of the plateau (&amp;lt;0.1%). Combining both models it is possible to explain the double

drainage divide pattern in Southeastern Australia without requiring a very specific initial

topographic configuration.



128 Chapter 7. Application of the model to natural examples

It is important to note that in the model of Figure 7.9a, the formation of the post-rift

inland divide at the secondary bulge occurs because the pre-rift topography dips landward.

We observed that in the case of pre-existing inland divide (Figure 7.9b, Model 4) with the

topography dipping seaward, the secondary bulge does not evolve to a new drainage divide

but is gradually eroded.

7.1.6.4 Serra do Mar, Southeastern Brazil

The Serra do Mar consists of a set of escarpments that run parallel to the coast of

southeastern Brazil for nearly 1000 km and locally reach up to 2 km elevation (Mohriak

et al., 2008). Located offshore of the Serra do Mar, the Santos and Campos basins are pre-

dominantly developed on thinned continental crust. An important feature of the basement

under the Santos and Campos basins is the Cretaceous hinge zone (Figure 7.10b-c) that

marks a strong variation in basement dip and represents the western limit of Cretaceous

sedimentation in the offshore basins (Karner, 2000). Furthermore, this hinge zone appears

to coincide with the western limit of significant crustal thinning (Karner, 2000). Mohriak

et al. (2008) proposed that the present-day Serra do Mar is the result of the retreat of

an escarpment that formed initially at the Cretaceous hinge zone, resulting in a retreat

distance of 172-247 km.

According to the predictions of our models, the thinning of the crust under the offshore

portion of southeastern Brazil makes retreat of the present-day escarpment from its original

position at the hinge line quite unlikely. It appears much more plausible that the present-

day main drainage divide was created as a secondary flexural bulge that persisted through

time (see Figure 7.3). These results agree with the conclusions of Hiruma et al. (2010), who

suggest that the Bocaina Plateau, the highest part of the Serra do Mar, corresponds to a

preserved inland drainage divide. The distance between the escarpment and the initial rift

shoulder in the numerical model of Figure 7.3 is nearly 170 km, of the same order as the

distance from the present-day Serra do Mar to the Cretaceous hinge zone (Figure 7.10c).

Furthermore, the final configuration of the basement predicted by our model beneath

the original rift shoulder is similar to that of the hinge zone in the offshore region of the

Santos basin. In Figure 7.10a we show the stratigraphic pattern predicted by our numerical

model (Figure 7.3). In this model the rift shoulder is eroded and subsides due to post-rift

thermal cooling of the lithosphere and the sedimentary load of the margin. The subsidence

of the coastal area creates accommodation space filled by sediments at a later time. After

50 Myr of evolution in our model (the green line in Figure 7.10a) the region landward

of the hinge line subsides and preserves a substantial sedimentary package, similar to the

post-Cretaceous sedimentation in the Santos basin (Figure 7.10b).

The load of the margin also favors the migration of the drainage divide to the secondary

bulge, since it imposes a seaward tilt, similar to the differential subsidence due to thinning

of the lower crust.

During the Cenozoic, the Southeastern Brazilian margin was affected by renewed conti-

nental rifting (Riccomini et al., 2004) that produced a series of basins parallel to the coast.

Rifting also resulted in the isolation of the Serra do Mar escarpments and the formation

of the inland escarpment of the Serra da Mantiqueira (Figure 7.10c).

To verify the potential effect of late continental rifting on the evolution of the escarp-

ment system, we developed a new simulation (Model 5) presented in Figure 7.11 (see Table

7.2). Like in Model 1, stretching of the lithosphere and thinning of the lower crust under

the rift flank result in the development of an inland drainage divide on the secondary bulge

that evolves into the new escarpment, while the rift flank escarpment disappears due to

the combined effects of erosion and subsidence (Figure 7.11a).

At 70 Myr, we introduce the gradual formation of a 40-km-wide graben, in a position

landward of the escarpment as indicated in Figure 7.11b. The development of the graben

occurs during 1 Myr, and the rate of uplift close to the flanks of the faults is ?wmax/?t =

1 km/Myr. These faults isolate the oceanward escarpment and create a new one in a

landward position (Figure 7.11c).

After formation of the graben, the erosion and flexural response of the lithosphere con-

tinue to modify the landscape. 50 Myr after the graben formation (Figure 7.11d), both

escarpments persist as prominent topographic features with more than 1500 m relief, repre-

senting local drainage divides and resembling the Serra do Mar and Serra da Mantiqueira

escarpments.

This result shows that Cenozoic rifting does not affect the conclusions of the present

work about the evolution of the Serra do Mar. The physical explanation for the persistence

of the Serra do Mar after the Cenozoic rifting is that this tectonism did not result in

expressive thinning of the lower crust, and the Serra do Mar did not undergo mechanical

subsidence, unlike the flank uplift at the hinge zone.

7.1.7 Conclusions

The main contribution of this work is the development of a numerical model for rifted

margin evolution that takes both onshore and offshore dynamics into account, thereby

providing a self-consistent explanation for pinned-divide formation. This work confirms

earlier suggestions that long-term preservation of an escarpment requires a high pre-existing

plateau to have been present. Our model shows how the combination of flexural response

of the crust to faulting during rifting and differential subsidence of the margin can produce

an inland drainage divide that persists through time since the onset of rifting and does not

evolve from the rift shoulder as a retreating escarpment.

We have observed that the formation of an inland drainage divide is directly controlled

by the thinning pattern of the crust during rifting. The position of the drainage divide

developed on the secondary bulge is controlled by the rigidity of the crust during rifting,

while the rigidity of the entire lithosphere plays a secondary role, controlling the retreat

rate of the new escarpment.

These concepts can potentially clarify the understanding of the formation of the double

drainage divide pattern observed in Southeastern Australia and can explain the present-

day position of the Serra do Mar escarpment in Brazil relative to the Cretaceous hinge

zone in the offshore basins. They provide, in both cases, a systemic explanation for the

particular topographic patterns observed, without requiring recourse to conjectural post-

rift reactivation of the margins.

The ideas proposed here can be further tested by studying in greater details the distri-

bution of extension (? maps) in passive margins and how it relates to escarpment geometry

and position. They can also be confronted with thermochronological data, which provide

constraints on the timing of erosion in the coastal regions. However, as demonstrated by

Braun and van der Beek (2004), this approach might be hindered by the relatively low

amounts of exhumation experienced by many passive margins.

7.2 Post-rift influence of a thermal plume on passive margins2

7.2.1 Abstract

This work presents how the passage of a thermal anomaly under the lithosphere can

affect the sedimentary evolution of passive margins. We assumed that the uplift related to

the thermal anomaly is due to the thermal expansion of the lithosphere, and other effects

associated with the dynamics of the asthenosphere are neglected. We studied different

scenarios in the numerical models, taking into account the interaction of the thermal

evolution of the lithosphere, the flexural isostasy and the surface processes of erosion and

deposition. The numerical results show that the velocity of the lithosphere relative to

the thermal anomaly and the flexural rigidity of the continental and oceanic lithospheres

significantly affect the evolution of the sedimentary shelf. Finally, the concepts from the

numerical models are used to study the influence of a thermal anomaly (the Trindade

Plume?) on the evolution of the Campos and Esp??rito Santo Basins, in Southeastern

Brazil.

7.2.2 Introduction

It is known that many oceanic volcanoes show shallower-than-normal bathymetry that

extends for several hundred kilometers beyond the region of volcanism, whereas very old

oceanic volcanoes are not associated with swells (Ito and van Keken, 2007). Therefore, a

transient mechanism is responsible to produce these swells.

During the last decades, different models have been proposed to explain the formation

of these swells. One explanation is that the introduction of buoyant asthenosphere at the

base of the lithospheric plate produces these swells (Sleep, 1987). Other models describe

the swell as a dynamic topography due to the upwelling movement of material in the

sub-lithospheric mantle (Ribe and Christensen, 1994). Also, simple isostatic models based

on thermal diffusion explains the evolving bathymetry along seamount chains (Ito and

Clift, 1998). In fact, these different mechanisms may be acting concomitantly, each one

contributing partially to the total uplift.

In the present work, we simulate the uplift of the lithosphere as a result of the thermal

2Since this section is part of an article to be submitted, this section was written in the active voice.



134 Chapter 7. Application of the model to natural examples

heating of the lithosphere due to the passage of a plume head, exemplified here as a thermal

anomaly at the base of the lithosphere. The uplift produced by the thermal anomaly is

only due to the diffusional heating and thermal expansion of the lithosphere, and does not

take into account other effects like dynamic topography created by the upwelling movement

of the plume. Certainly, the dynamic topography associated with the plume must amplify

the uplift of the surface and, therefore, the uplift predicted in the present work must be

taken as an underestimated uplift.

Incorporating surface processes of erosion and deposition and regional isostatic com-

pensation in the numerical models, we discuss how the transient uplift of the lithosphere

influences the evolution of passive margins. In spite of the assumption of the thermal

expansion of the lithosphere as the mechanism for the formation of swells, the conclusions

about the evolution of the passive margins are independent of the transient mechanism to

create the swells.

7.2.3 The isostatic effect of a moving plume

The model to study the isostatic effect of a plume moving relatively to the lithosphere

with velocity ?vrel under the lithosphere is illustrated in Figure 7.12. The model is

constructed considering that the reference frame is fixed relative to the plume and the

lithosphere is steadily moving over the plume with velocity vrel = (vrel, 0).

Section 7.2. Post-rift influence of a thermal plume on passive margins 135

The temperature at the top surface of the model is maintained fixed at Tz=0 = 0
?C and

the bottom surface, i.e. the base of the lithosphere, at

Tz=?aL = [1300 + Tanomaly exp
(

)
]?C

where Tanomaly is the maximum temperature at the center of the thermal anomaly at the

base of the lithosphere, r is the horizontal distance to the center of the plume and r0

is a parameter that controls the radius of the thermal anomaly. This problem is solved

numerically through the finite element method as described in Chapter 3.

The temperature Tanomaly is based on estimates of excess mantle temperature associ-

ated with plumes (e.g. White et al., 1995; Herzberg and O’Hara, 2002) ranging between

100-300?C. In the present work it is assumed that Tanomaly = 175
?C. The radius r0 is esti-

mated from the width of the swells associated with oceanic volcanoes. Ito and van Keken

(2007) showed that the width of the swells range from hundreds to thousands kilometers

(e.g. Gala?pagos - 300 km; Trindade-Martin Vaz - 1330 km; Azores - 2300 km). In the

present work r0 is assumed to be equal to r0 = 300 km, resulting in a width of 600 km.

Assuming local isostatic compensation and vertical loading due to thermal expan-

sion of the lithosphere related to temperature variation ?T, the vertical uplift wT of

the lithosphere is

The uplift of the lithosphere wT due to the passage of a thermal anomaly depends on

the relative velocity vrel. If the relative velocity is too high, there is not enough time to

heat the lithosphere and the thermal expansion is not expressive. Therefore, the maximum

uplift of the lithosphere decreases with the increase of vrel. To illustrate this effect, in the

Figure 7.13 we present maps of the thermal uplift of the lithosphere due to a thermal

anomaly at the base of the plate, for different relative velocities (vrel = 0, 1, 2 and 3

cm/yr). In these numerical models, the maximum uplift varies from 401 m for vrel = 0 to

122 m for vrel = 3 m/yr (see Table 7.4). It is possible to observe that the amplitude and

shape of the uplift depends on the thickness of the lithosphere, the relative velocity vrel

and the magnitude and extent of the thermal anomaly.

axis is the time since the instant the plate crossed the plume. In our numerical models,

the maximum uplift rate occurs for the fastest plate (Table 7.4), although in this case the

period of uplift is the shortest (Figure 7.14). The rate of uplift maps also show that the

regions close to the thermal anomaly initially undergoes uplift, followed by a protracted

subsidence.

Another aspect observed in Figure 7.13 is that the maximum uplift does not occur in

the center of the thermal anomaly, but is shifted toward the direction of movement of the

lithosphere relative to the thermal anomaly. The shift increases with vrel, apparently faster

The uplift wT shown in Figure 7.13 could be amplified considering that wT modifies the

surface and can lead to a load redistribution at the top of the lithosphere. In submarine

swells, the thermal uplift of the lithosphere displaces water on the top of the plate, which

results in unloading of the lithosphere. In this case, the expression for the uplift of the

lithosphere becomes:

7.2.4 The influence of thermal anomalies on the evolution of passive margins

To illustrate the influence of a thermal anomaly at the base of the lithosphere on the

evolution of passive margins, we incorporate in the thermal model the surface processes

and the flexural isostatic models (Chapters 5 and 2, respectively).

It is assumed a passive margin with the initial topography as shown in Figure 7.15a,

and the area of the model is 500×500 km2. Other parameters of the model are shown in



140 Chapter 7. Application of the model to natural examples

model with a relative velocity of |vrel| = 1 cm/yr along the axis y = 0. Concomitantly with

the movement of the thermal anomaly, the topography is eroded and the sediments are

deposited on the margin. Due to the parallelism of the topographic feature with the coast,

the supply of sediments to the coast is relatively uniform along the margin. Both surface

and thermal loading are regionally compensated. During all the numerical simulation, the

sea level is maintained at z = 0. The simulation occurs during 100 Myr (Figures 7.15, 7.16

and 7.17), and, during this period, the thermal anomaly crosses the entire model.

To analyze in detail the effect of the thermal anomaly on the passive margin, two

sections are extracted from the model (Figure 7.17): Section A at y = 400 km (far from

the thermal anomaly); and Section B at y = 10 km (close to the thermal anomaly track).

The stratigraphic evolution of the margin in Sections A and B is shown in Figures 7.18

and 7.19, respectively.

In Section A, where the influence of the thermal anomaly is less expressive, during the

first stage of the model, erosion and unloading of the continent result in regional uplift of

the margin, producing stratal offlapping of the basin margin (Figures 7.18, 20-60 Myr).

When the erosion of the continent occurs mainly far from the coast, the basin undergoes

predominantly subsidence due to the sedimentary loading, causing a tenuous stratigraphic

onlap of younger sediments onto older ones, as shown in Figures 7.18, 40-100 Myr. This

offlapping and subsequent onlapping strata related to the flexural effects of the erosion of

rift shoulders was previously observed by van Balen et al. (1995).

In Section B, the initial stratigraphic evolution is very similar to the one in Section

A (Figure 7.19, 20 Myr). But at 40 Myr, the presence of the thermal anomaly under

the margin results in regional uplift due to thermal heating of the lithosphere. This uplift

induces partial erosion of the sedimentary layers, producing a pattern of stratigraphic offlap

(Figure 7.19, 40-60 Myr). After the passage of the thermal anomaly, the margin undergoes

subsidence due to the sedimentary loading and the thermal cooling of the lithosphere. This

additional subsidence results in a progressive overstepping of younger strata, producing a

clear stratigraphic onlap (Figure 7.19, 80-100 Myr).

The stratigraphic features discussed in the previous lines is better visualized in Figure

7.20, where both sections are presented at 100 Myr. Another aspect about the evolution

of the margin is that, at the end of the simulation, the portion of the margin close to the

thermal anomaly (Section B) presents a thinner and slightly wider sedimentary package

than the portions far from the thermal anomaly (Section A).

Figure 7.21 shows the chronostratigraphy of the marginal basin through Sections A

and B. We observe the formation of a hiatus (indicated as TUH - Thermal uplift hiatus in

Figure 7.21) related to the uplift of the margin due to the passage of the thermal anomaly.

This hiatus does not appear in Section A. The continuous line in Figure 7.21 represents the

position of the thermal anomaly through time. Observe that the passage of the thermal

uplift results initially in an erosional hiatus on the previously deposited strata, followed

by a nondepositional hiatus. The combination of erosional and nondepositional hiatus

produces the TUH.

If the relative velocity vrel increases from 1 cm/yr to 2 cm/yr, the resulting chronostra-

tigraphy of Section B (Figure 7.22) presents a TUH with nearly the same spatial extent of

the previous case, but the hiatus crosses a shorter time interval. This occurs because the

amplitude of the thermal uplift for vrel = 2 cm/yr is lower than for the case with vrel = 1

cm/yr (see Figure 7.13) and the erosional hiatus is less expressive than in the previous

model. Furthermore, the thermal subsidence after the passage of the thermal anomaly for

the model with vrel = 2 cm/yr is faster than in the previous model (Figure 7.14), and the

nondepositional hiatus in the TUH is shorter in time.

The spatial and temporal extension of the TUH depends not only on the thermal

model, but also on the flexural rigidity of the lithosphere and the dynamics of the surface

processes. As an example, if the model with vrel = 1 cm/yr is rerun with a higher effective

elastic thickness (from Te = 5 to 20 km) the resulting margin presents thinner sedimentary

layers and wider shelf than in the model with Te = 5 km. In this case, the passage of

the thermal anomaly under the lithosphere results in a broader uplift of the sedimentary

strata due to the higher rigidity, resulting in a more expressive influence of the TUH in

the chronostratigraphy of the basin, both in space and time (Figure 7.23).

As a second example, we considered the model vrel = 1 cm/yr with a higher flexural

rigidity in the continent (Te = 20 km) than in the ocean (Te = 5 km). In this situation

the spatial and temporal extent of the TUH is significantly affected (Figure 7.24). While

in the original model the TUH comprises approximately 30 km along the section and ? 50

Myr (Figure 7.21), in the model with higher rigidity in the continent the TUH reaches up

to 60 km along the section and ? 70 Myr through time (Figure 7.24). One interesting

aspect about this last model is that the increase of the rigidity in the continent drastically

influenced the depositional evolution of the margin.

7.2.5 Application: The influence of the Trindade Plume on the evolution of the Campos

and Esp??rito Santo Basins

The Trindade Island and the Martin Vaz archipelago are located more than 1000 km

east of the Southeastern Brazilian coast and represent the eastern portion of the Vito?ria-

Trindade Chain (Figure 7.25). The evolution of this ridge has been associated with the

relative movement of the South American Plate and the Trindade Plume, resulting in the

formation of a E-W volcanic track (e.g. O’Connor and Duncan, 1990).

Close to the margin, the Vito?ria-Trindade Chain is between the Campos and Esp??rito

Santo Basins, and coincides with the north limit of the Vito?ria High and the south limit

of the Esp??rito Santo Basin (Ferrari and Riccomini, 1999).

Assuming that the Vito?ria-Trindade Chain (Figure 7.25) was formed as a result of

the migration of the South American plate over the Trindade Plume and taking into

account the Abrolhos volcanism (47.5 Ma) as the moment of the impingement of the

plume under the continental margin, Ferrari and Riccomini (1999) estimated the relative

velocity between the lithosphere and the plume as vrel = 2.31 cm/yr. As predicted by the

present numerical model, this relative velocity must reflect a perceptive transient uplift of

the lithosphere due to its thermal expansion.

Analyzing the residual topography, Ito and van Keken (2007) observed that the swell

associated with the Trindade Plume has a width of ?1330 km. Therefore, the passage of

the Trindade plume probably uplifted both Campos and Esp??rito Santo Basins.

The chronostratigraphy of the Campos basin is marked by an expressive hiatus crossing

the Paleocene and Eocene (Figure 7.26). The preserved Paleocene sedimentation occurs

only in deep water, characterized mainly by mudstones. During the Eocene, an extensive

erosion eliminated almost all the Paleocene sedimentation, mainly in the proximal and

central regions of the basin (Dias et al., 1990). The proximal siliciclastic sedimentation

in the Early Eocene occurred along depressions produced by halokinesis and tectonism

related to reactivation of faults (Winter et al., 2007).

During the same period, the Santos Basin, located southwestward of the Campos basin

and far from the influence of the Trindade Plume, presents restricted unconformities of few

million years, some of them probably related to sea level variations (Moreira et al., 2007),

and the siliciclastic sedimentation is observed throughout the Cenozoic (Figure 7.26).

Therefore, the protracted hiatus observed in the Campos Basin cannot be explained

through an ubiquitous event along the Brazilian margin, but a local (or regional) process

must be associated with the Paleocene-Eocene hiatus.

Thomaz Filho et al. (2005) associated the Eocene and Paleocene unconformities in the

Campos Basin with the thermal uplift related to the Cabo Frio Magmatic Lineament.

Through backstripping studies, they also observed an uplift event in the Campos Basin

during the Paleocene/Eocene of ?700 m (Figure 7.27).

On the other hand, Riccomini et al. (2005) concluded that the Cabo Frio Magma-

tic Lineament cannot be explained through the passage of a mantle plume beneath the

lithosphere because the age of magmatism along the lineament does not decrease eastward,

as would be expected in the plume model. They propose that the lineament correspond

to a fracture zone, and the magmatic activity were emplaced along the lineament through

structural discontinuities and the source of heating for the magmatism was a long-lived

process of mantle upwelling lasting for ca. 210 Myr. In this case, the long-lived source of

heat cannot be associated with the transient uplift of Campos Basin, unless the influence

of this heat source significantly oscillated through time.

Oreiro et al. (2008) related the Cabo Frio Magmatic Lineament to partial melting of

the lithosphere by pressure release during reactivation of the fracture zone. To assess if

pressure release and the rapid injection of hot material through the lithosphere is capable

to induce a transient uplift as observed in the margin, we simulated the thermal diffusion

and the associated thermal uplift due to the instantaneous emplacement of a vertical

cylinder of ?2 km wide with T = 1300?C crossing the entire lithosphere. The results

show that the thermal uplift rapidly vanishes after the emplacement of the hot material

(Figure 7.28). Furthermore, the extent of the thermal anomaly through time is restricted

to a few kilometers around the cylinder and the flexural compensation of this narrow

feature strongly smooth out the topographic expression of the thermal anomaly, even for

low flexural rigidity. Therefore, regional thermal uplift due to the injection of hot mantle

through fractures in the lithosphere is unlikely.

These aspects favor the Trindade Plume as the source for the transient uplift observed



Section 7.2. Post-rift influence of a thermal plume on passive margins 153

in the Campos Basin. It is possible that the impingement of the Trindade Plume uplifted

the margin during the Eocene, contributing to part of the erosion of the Eocene and

Paleocene sediments in the Campos Basin. Certainly other processes, like halokinesis and

reactivation of faults (Winter et al., 2007), affected the evolution of the basin and hinder

the correct identification of the TUH. Probably, the thermal uplift due to the passage of

the Trindade Plume only contributed with part of the Eocene and Paleocene hiatus in the

Campos Basin.

Unlike the Campos Basin, the Esp??rito Santo Basin does not present expressive hiatus

during the Paleocene and Eocene, and the unconformities are restricted to the proximal

region (Figure 7.26). A possible explanation for this is that during this period, the pre-

dominant sedimentation in the Esp??rito Santo Basin is characterized by shale, indicating

a deep depositional environment. In spite of this, Franc?a et al. (2007) observed that the

stratigraphic sequence encompassing the Paleocene and the Early-Eocene present an offlap

pattern in the proximal region, indicating uplift of the margin (Figure 7.26). This sequence

was followed by the sedimentation during the Middle Eocene that resulted in stratigraphic

onlap on the older strata (Franc?a et al., 2007). This proximal hiatus can be related to the

passage of the Trindade Plume and the thermal heating of the lithosphere.

Another aspect to be considered is that the center of the plume does not need to

coincide with the Vito?ria-Trindade Chain. Ferrari and Riccomini (1999) proposed that the

lineament of the chain is associated with a fracture zone that acted as a conduit for the

magmatism associated with the Trindade Plume. If the center of the Trindade Plume is not

under the Vito?ria-Trindade Chain, but is positioned southward of the chain, the Campos

Basin was more influenced by the thermal uplift than the Esp??rito Santo Basin. However,

the verification of these conjectures need more information about the mantle structure, e.g.

from seismic velocity maps in the mantle with better resolution through the improvement of

the coverage of the seismic networks including oceanic stations. Furthermore, geochemical

data can give important contributions to understand the nature and the origin of the

Trindade Plume that formed the Vito?ria-Trindade Chain (Marques et al., 1999).

It is important to emphasize that, in our model, the thermal anomaly at the base of

the lithosphere does not need to be associated with a deep-mantle plume, but could be

produced by anomalous warm asthenosphere.



154 Chapter 7. Application of the model to natural examples

7.2.6 Conclusions

Through numerical models that couple thermal effects in the lithosphere, flexural isos-

tasy and surface processes of erosion and deposition, the present work shows that the

evolution of passive margins is significantly affected by the transient effect of a thermal

anomaly at the base of the lithosphere.

The heating of the lithosphere and the associated thermal expansion may result in a

lithospheric uplift of hundreds of meters that produces expressive unconformities in the

marginal basin.

It is shown that the higher the relative velocity between the lithosphere and the thermal

anomaly, the lower the amplitude of the thermal uplift. On the other hand, an increase of

the relative velocity amplifies the rate of uplift or subsidence.

Besides the dynamics of the surface processes and relative velocity of the lithosphere,

the effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere is an important parameter controlling the

shape of the hiatus related to the thermal uplift.

This study proposes that the passage of the Trindade Plume beneath the Southeastern

Brazilian margin resulted in thermal heating of the lithosphere and consequent uplift of

the margin, creating unconformities in the Campos and Esp??rito Santo Basins during the

Paleocene and Eocene.



Chapter 8

Final remarks

No substantial part of the universe is so simple

that it can be grasped and controlled without abstraction.

Abstraction consists in replacing the part of the universe under

consideration by a model of similar but simpler structure.

(Rosenblueth and Wiener, 1945)

The numerical model presented here proved to be an useful tool to study the evolution

of divergent margins since the beginning of rifting. Through this model it was possible

to evaluate the relative importance of the different surface and tectonic processes on the

evolution of rifted margins.

The incorporation of lithospheric stretching and rifting in the numerical model was an

important aspect to obtain new insights into the evolution of escarpments in divergent

margins. It was shown in Section 7.1 that the amount of extension during rifting can

displace the position of the escarpment from the rift flank toward an inland position,

many kilometers landward, depending on the flexural rigidity of the upper crust. This

model can be further tested by studying in greater details the distribution of extension in

passive margins and confronting the model with thermochronological data.

The results from the numerical models presented in Section 7.2 showed how the passage

of a thermal anomaly under the lithosphere generates a transient lithospheric uplift of

hundreds of meters related to thermal expansion. It is also shown how this transient uplift

can affect the evolution of sedimentary basins in passive margins, resulting in offlapping

followed by onlapping strata. The hiatus in the sedimentary basin related to the thermal

uplift depends not only on the dynamics of the surface processes and the thermal anomaly,



156 Chapter 8. Final remarks

but also on the effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere, both in the ocean and in the

adjacent continent.

It is important to highlight that the kinematic model for lithospheric stretching used

in the present work is a simple description for the rifting process and does not take into

account the dynamic effects related to strain-dependent rheologies. This simple model can

be modified in the future, considering dynamical models for stretching (e.g. Buck et al.,

2003; Huismans and Beaumont, 2003).

Additionally, the coupling of the processes in this work can be improved. In the present

numerical model, the kinematic model for faulting and stretching of the lithosphere affects

the other processes but is not affected by them (Figure 6.1). Indeed, the modification of

the thermal state of the lithosphere influences its rheological behavior and consequently the

rifting style (Buck, 1993). Likewise, erosion and deposition also affect the thermal state of

the lithosphere and consequently its rigidity (Lavier and Steckler, 1997). Moreover, flexural

isostasy modifies the stress state of the lithosphere and can influence the formation of faults

in the crust.

Certainly, there are uncountable conditions to be tested in new models, coupling all

the processes cited above, aiming to better describe and understand the interactions of

the surface and tectonic processes. On the other hand, the development of new numerical

models must be guided by the idea that models are “representations of reality”, useful for

leading to further research. Therefore, the sensitivity analysis for the different parameters

that compose the numerical model is an important step to identify the processes that are

really important for the problem and clarify “which aspects of the system are most in need

of further study, and where more empirical data are most needed” (Oreskes et al., 1994).

Flexure of an elastic plate with an abrupt rigidity

variation under a line load

Consider the case of an infinite elastic plate composed of two portions of different

flexural rigidities:

for x ? 0, D = D1

for x &amp;lt;0, D = D2

This plate is floating on an inviscid fluid of density ?. At x = 0 the plate is under the

action of a line load V0 (Figure A.1a).

infinite plates. The moments M1 and M2 and the line loads V1 and V2 represent the coupling

of the two halves.



176 Appendix A. Flexure of an elastic plate with an abrupt rigidity variation under a line load

To solve this problem analytically, a good strategy is to divide the plate in two halves

and treat each half as a semi-infinite plate (Figure A.1b), broken at x = 0. To represent

the coupling of the halves and the continuity between them as in the original plate, it is

imposed bending moments M1 and M2 and line loads V1 and V2 on the edges of the plates.

The equation that describes the flexure of this plate can be obtained from Equation

2.1 and eliminating the derivative with respect to y:

d2

dx2

(
D(x)

)
? q = 0

Since the applied load is zero except at x = 0, the only vertical force comes from the

buoyancy force ??gw:

where c1, c2, c3 and c4 are constants obtained from the boundary conditions and ? is the

Far from the load vector the deflection w ? 0. Therefore, the equation A.2 becomes

where ?1 =

and ?2 =

.

For the right plate the bending moment at x = 0 is M1. The bending moment is the

flexural rigidity of the plate divided by the radius of curvature of the plate Rcurv (Turcotte

and Schubert, 1982). Approximating 1/Rcurv ??d

Analytical proof of the “water load delay”

approximation

B.1 Exact solution for null rigidity

To demonstrate that the algorithm for the isostatic compensation presented in equation

6.7 converges to the exact solution, assume for simplicity that the rigidity of the plate is

zero implying that the first term in equation 6.7 is null. Consider a crust of thickness Hc

under a layer of water hw in isostatic equilibrium (Figure B.1i).

Figure B.1: Successive loading of the crust by sedimentation. The figures i, ii and iii are in isostatic

equilibrium and i? and ii? are out of isostatic equilibrium.

If the water layer hw is replaced by sediment (Figure B.1i
?) the new configuration, after

isostatic equilibrium, results in subsidence of the crust and filling of the top with water

(Figure B.1ii).

Comparing the isostatic state i and ii, it is possible to calculate the subsidence w1 due

to the sedimentary load of thickness hw (here all the terms were divided by g to simplify



180 Appendix B. Analytical proof of the “water load delay” approximation

the equation):

hw?w + Hc?c + w1?m = w1?w + hw?s + Hc?c

hw?w + w1?m = w1?w + hw?s (B.1)

w1(?m ??w) = hw(?s ??w) (B.2)

In equation B.2, the first term is the isostatic term, where ?m ??w = ??, and the second

term is the effective load, represented by the sediment that replaced the water.

Isolating w1:

w1 = hw
?s ??w
?m ??w

= hwr. (B.3)

If the new water layer w1 is replaced by sediment (Figure B.1ii
?) the new configuration,

after isostatic equilibrium, results in subsidence of the crust and filling of the top with

water (Figure B.1iii).

w1?w + hw?s + Hc?c + w2?m = w2?w + w1?s + hw?s + Hc?c

w1?w + w2?m = w2?w + w1?s (B.4)

w2 = w1
?s ??w
?m ??w

= w1r = hwr

Therefore, the nth replacement of the water layer by sediment results in a subsidence

wn = hwr

and the total subsidence wtotal is

wtotal =

The total subsidence wtotal represents the maximum subsidence produced when the basin

Section B.2. “Water load delay” approximation for null rigidity 181

B.2 “Water load delay” approximation for null rigidity

In the algorithm used in the present work, the water load due to the isostatic effect is

taken into account in the next time step. Therefore the equation B.1 becomes:

hw?w + w
?
1?m = hw?s

w?1 = hw
?s ??w
?m

(B.8)

Observe that the subsidence w?1 &amp;lt;w1, because w
?
1 does not take into account the water

load associated with the isostatic compensation.

In the next step, the crust is loaded with the sedimentary load of thickness w?1. Additi-

onally, the load of the water layer of the previous step is included. Therefore, the equation

B.4 becomes:

w?1?w + w

previous step

+w?1?s

And the subsidence in the second step w?2 is

?

Likewise the subsidence w?3 in the third step is

w?3 = w

?s
?m

= w?2r
? = w?1r

and, therefore, the subsidence of the following steps can be represented as

w?n = w

?n?1.

The total subsidence w?total is

w?total = w

therefore

that is exactly the same subsidence wtotal in equation B.7. This shows that the approxima-

tion of considering the water load associated with the subsidence from the previous time

step also converges to the exact solution.



182 Appendix B. Analytical proof of the “water load delay” approximation

B.3 Exact solution for nonzero rigidity

The “water load delay” approximation is also valid when the rigidity of the plate is

not null. To show this, consider an elastic plate with rigidity D. Assume that the plate is

under the action of a periodic load

(?s ??w)ghq1

where

hq1 = hlcos(?x)

and assume that the isostatic compensation occurs under the water, implying that ?? =

?m ??w. In this situation the equation 6.5 becomes:

D
?4w

?x4
+ (?m ??w)gw = (?s ??w)ghq1. (B.9)

The general solution for equation B.9 is:

w1 = Acos(?x) (B.10)

Replacing B.10 in B.9:

DA?4 + (?m ??w)gA = (?s ??w)hlg

A = hl
(?s ??w)g

D?4 + (?m ??w)g
and

w1 = hq1
(?s ??w)g

D?4 + (?m ??w)g
Assuming that the load for the next step is (?s ??w)ghq2 = (?s ??w)gw1, then

w2 = hq2
(?s ??w)g

D?4 + (?m ??w)g
= hq1

[
(?s ??w)g

D?4 + (?m ??w)g

]2
and the deflections wn of the following steps are

wn = hq1

[
(?s ??w)g

D?4 + (?m ??w)g

The total subsidence wtotal is

and as |rD| &amp;lt;1

wtotal = hq1

(B.11)



Section B.4. “Water load delay” approximation for nonzero rigidity 183

B.4 “Water load delay” approximation for nonzero rigidity

In the approximation for the isostatic compensation in the numerical model described

in section 6.4, the isostatic term is dependent only on ?m. Therefore, equation B.9 becomes

D
?4w?1
?x4

+ ?mgw
?
1 = (?s ??w)ghq1. (B.12)

resulting in

w?1 = hq1
(?s ??w)g
D?4 + ?mg

(B.13)

Assume that the load in the next step is (?s ? ?w)gh?q2 = (?s ? ?w)gw?1. Taking into

account also the load of the water from the previous step ?wgw
?
1, the total load in the

second step is:

(?s ??w)gw?1 + ?wgw
?
1 = ?sgw

?
1.

Therefore, the equation for w?2 is

D
?4w?2
?x4

+ ?mgw
?
2 = ?sghq2

resulting in

w?2 = hq2
?sg

D?4 + ?mg
= w?1

?sg

D?4 + ?mg
= w?1r

?
D

It is possible to observe that the deflection w?n of the step n is of the following form

w?n = w
?
1r
?n?1
D

and the total deflection w?total is

w?total = w
?
1

??
n=1

r?n?1D = w

.

Therefore

w?total = w
?
1

1

1 ? r?D
= w?1

D?4 + ?mg

D?4 + (?m ??s)g
.

From B.13:

w?total = hq1
(?s ??w)g
D?4 + ?mg

D?4 + ?mg

D?4 + (?m ??s)g
= hq1

(?s ??w)g
D?4 + (?m ??s)g

. (B.14)

Comparing equations B.11 and B.14 it is possible to see that the total deflection are

the same (wtotal = w
?
total) in both cases. This shows that the algorithm presented in section

6.4 converges to the exact solution even when D &gt; 0.



184 Appendix B. Analytical proof of the “water load delay” approximation

B.5 Conclusions

As shown in the examples of the previous sections, the “water load delay” approxima-

tion converges to the exact solution, independent of the flexural rigidity of the plate.

In this approximation, the isostatic equilibrium is not instantaneously achieved during

the loading, but is gradually reached in the following time steps. Actually, almost all the

isostatic equilibrium is achieved in first few time steps after loading.

For example, for D = 0, the exact subsidence w1 due to the load of a sedimentary layer

of thickness hw is (see equation B.3)

w1 = hw
?s ??w
?m ??w

In the first step in the “water load delay” approximation, the subsidence w?1 is (see

equationB.13)

w?1 = hw
?s ??w
?m

which represents almost 69% of the exact subsidence, for ?m = 3300 kg/m
3 and ?w = 1030

kg/m3. Without additional sedimentary loading, the subsidence continues in the second

time step due to the layer o water w?1, resulting in

w?2 = w
?
1

?w
?m

.

The summation w?1 + w
?
2 represents 90% of the exact subsidence.

The subsidence continues in the following steps, approaching the exact solution:

w?n = w
?
1

[
?w
?m

]n?1
.

In the third step, the total subsidence is 97% of the exact subsidence, and in the fourth

step, the total subsidence is 99%.

As the time step is small in the numerical model (102 ? 103 years) relative to the

characteristic time of the different geological processes involved, the “water load delay”

approximation works almost like the exact solution considering the load of water instan-

taneously.
