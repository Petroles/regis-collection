ABSTRACT – Nearby the city of Santa Cruz do Sul (central region of Rio Grande do Sul State in Brazil), an
outcrop of the Triassic Santa Maria Formation contains a rather unusual fossil occurrence consisting of a
concentration of disarticulated therapsid skeletons dominated by herbivorous and carnivorous cynodonts. Non-
cynodont remains are restricted to a single specimen of Rhadinosuchidae (Archosauriformes: Proterochampsia).
The taphocoenosis is characterized by the chaotic accumulation of tens of isolated fossil bones within a block of
mudrock 10 m wide and 20 m long, and approximately 5 m thick. The site lies within an approximately 30 m
thick succession of red mudstone displaying horizons of rhizoliths and carbonate nodules which are interpreted
as palaeopedogenic carbonate precipitation in alluvium on a semi arid floodplain. Preservation of the fossil bones
at this site is unusually good. Microstructure of the bones shows external and internal precipitation of calcite and
quartz in the vessel cavities and pores in the bone matrix indicating that they were initially filled by calcite, and
than partially replaced by quartz. These features combined with the presence of calcareous rhizoliths and
carbonate nodules, suggest that the bones were accumulated on a playa lake margin with the position of the
shoreline being controlled by the groundwater table movements between dry and wet seasons. The taphocoenosis
shows a predominance of disarticulated and disassociated skulls and mandibles. Commonly large and very small
bones occur side-by-side with no preferred orientation. This taphonomic style suggests a biogenic agent of
concentration of the bones by selective predation.

Key words: Biogenic concentration, floodplain, Triassic, vertebrate taphonomy.

RESUMO – Perto da cidade de Santa Cruz do Sul (região central do Rio Grande do Sul, Brasil), um afloramento
Triássico da Formação Santa Maria apresenta uma assembléia fóssil bastante incomum, consistindo de uma
concentração de restos esqueletais de terápsidos desarticulados, com predomínio de ossos de cinodontes herbívoros
e carnívoros. Apenas um espécime de Rhadinosuchidae (Archosauriformes: Proterochampsia) foi encontrado. A
tafocenose é caracterizada por uma acumulação caótica dos ossos isolados, em um nível pelítico de 10 m de
largura e 20 m de comprimento e aproximadamente 5 m de altura. O afloramento encontra-se numa sucessão de
aproximadamente 30 m, cujos pelitos vermelhos apresentam horizontes com presença de rizólitos e nódulos de
carbonato de cálcio, que são interpretados como precipitações de carbonato pedogênico numa planície semi-
árida. A preservação dos fósseis neste afloramento raramente é boa. A microestrutura óssea apresenta precipitações
externas e internas de calcita e quartzo nas cavidades e poros, indicando que eles foram inicialmente preenchidos
por calcita e posteriormente, esta foi substituída por quartzo. Isto, associado à presença de nódulos carbonáticos
e rizólitos sugere que os ossos foram acumulados nas margens de um lago efêmero, cujo controle se deu por
flutuações no lençol freático em estações úmidas e secas. A tafocenose mostra um predomínio de crânios e
mandíbulas desarticulados e não-associados e comumente ossos grandes e pequenos ocorrem lado a lado, sem
uma orientação preferencial. Este modo tafonômico de ocorrência sugere um agente biogênico de concentração,
que selecionou os ossos por predação seletiva.

Palavras-chave: Concentração biogênica, planície, Triássico, tafonomia de vertebrados.

INTRODUCTION

Bone concentrations are relatively common in the fossil
record. However, the genesis of such concentrations is often
poorly researched or not considered at all. Taphonomic
processes such as scavenging, predation, trampling, fluvial
transportation and re-working of organic remains all leave
their taphonomic signature on the fossil assemblage
(Turnbull &amp;amp; Martill, 1988). Thus, to fully understand the
palaeoecological significance of the fossil assemblage such
events must be adequately investigated as part of a detailed
taphonomic analysis. This study concerns a fossil bone
accumulation in the Triassic portion of the Paraná Basin of
southern Brazil. This very large intracratonic basin of
southwestern Gondwana, was intermittently active from the
Late Ordovician to early Cretaceous. It is NE-SW orientated
and is approximately 1,750 km long and 900 km wide, covering
an area of 1,700,000 km2 (Figure 1A).

The basin formed after the Brasiliano Cycle (the Brazilian
tectonic equivalent for the coming together of Gondwana
during Proterozoic) with plutonic events (610-580 m.y.) and
subsequent cooling and thermal subsidence in Cambro-
Ordovician times (500-450 m.y.). During the middle Mesozoic,

preceding the opening of the South Atlantic, the Paraná Basin
underwent tectonic reorganization due to the paroxysm of
the Sierra de la Ventana-Cape Fold Belt orogen. This
tectonism resulted in uplift of large areas of the former Paraná
Basin, leading to intraplate rifting and the formation of several
small extensional basins (Zerfass et al., 2003, 2004). Our study
focuses on the red-bed type sediments (Figure 2) that
accumulated in one of these restricted extensional basins
during the Middle Triassic. They form part of the Santa Maria
Formation (sensu Andreis et al., 1980) that crops out in Rio
Grande do Sul, the southernmost state of Brazil (Figure 1B).
This formation has two members, called Passos das Tropas
and Alemoa. The conglomerates of the Passo das Tropas
Member have not yielded any fossil vertebrates to date.

The Alemoa Member contains the study site and is
characterized by large amounts of tabular, massive or thinly
laminated red coloured mudstones with calcitic palaeosol
horizons ( i.e., rhizoliths and carbonate nodules) and some
interfingering sandstone lenses. Fonseca (1999) attributes
these deposits to an anastomosed fluvial system, where the
mudstones (associated with calcrete nodules) were deposited
on the floodplain while the sandstone lenses represent in-
channel deposits.

Middle Triassic tetrapod faunas mainly comprise
archosaurs, dicynodonts, cynodonts, rhynchosaurs, besides
less well represented groups like procolophonids and
sphenodontids (e.g., Schultz, 1990; Rubert &amp;amp; Schultz, 2004).

Most of the paleontological record of Rio Grande do Sul
Triassic rocks shows some kind of biostratinomic or
diagenetic modification, including hydraulic selection of
bones, scavenger action and diagenetic “explosion” and re-
cementation (e.g., Holz &amp;amp; Barberena, 1994; Holz &amp;amp; Schultz,
1998; Holz &amp;amp; Souto-Ribeiro, 2000).

During taxonomic analysis, Abdala et al. (2001) noted
that the taphocoenosis of a section located at Santa Cruz do
Sul city, in the central region of Rio Grande do Sul State, is
very peculiar because of the large number of cynodont skulls
and lower jaws found in these massive red mudstones. We
have investigated this peculiar location, known as the
Schoenstatt outcrop, and have confirmed the findings of
Abdala et al. (2001) that unlike other fossiliferous outcrops
in the Triassic succession in Rio Grande do Sul State, the
Schoenstatt outcrop is characterized by a bone accumulation
of low taxonomic variability with highly disarticulated and
selective preservation.

The traditional taphonomic models (e.g., Holz &amp;amp;
Barberena, 1994) for the Triassic succession do not explain
the taphonomic signature of this particular outcrop, thus a
detailed taphonomic study was developed based on
palaeoecological and palaeoenvironmental reconstruction
(Bandyopadhyay et al., 2002) in order to understand the
sequence of events that led to this unusual fossil occurrence.
Smith &amp;amp; Swart (2002) observed this kind of fossil
concentration at the Omingonde Formation (Karoo
Supergroup, Namibia). They recognized three different
taphonomic assemblages. Schoenstatt taphocoenosis seems
to be very similar to the assemblage found in loessic plains,

&amp;amp; Scherer, 2000)

in which isolated skulls without lower jaws and isolated
postcranial bones of different cynodonts taxa were collected.

SEDIMENTOLOGY AND STRATIGRAPHY
OF SCHOENSTATT OUTCROP

The Schoenstatt outcrop is located alongside road RS
287 near Santa Cruz do Sul city (UTM (22) 359767 E, 6709062
N), about 150 km from Porto Alegre (capital of Rio Grande do
Sul State, Figure 1). It displays approximately 20 m of mudstone
(Alemoa Member, Santa Maria Formation, sensu Andreis et
al., 1980) topped by nearly 15 m of fine to very fine sandstone
(Caturrita Formation sensu Andreis et al., 1980).

The mudstone is either massive or has millimetre scale,
intermittent horizontal lamination. Rhizoliths, some with fibro-
radial calcite mineralization and calcium carbonate filled
fractures are common. The uneven distribution of tetrapod
fossils in this unit is clearly anomalous. The basal 15 m of the
section are almost barren of fossils, whereas the upper part
of the succession (between 15 and 20 m, Figure 3) numerous
vertebrate fossils and coprolites are found in lateral
association with carbonate nodules. Immediately above the
bone concentration, a horizon of carbonate nodules occurs
in association with calcite-filled fractures.

The sandstone dominated Caturrita Formation (sensu
Andreis et al., 1980) at the top of the section is apparently
barren of fossils. It is composed of four fine-grained
sandstone bodies structured with horizontal lamination and
trough cross-bedding and very fine-grained sandstones
displaying climbing ripple cross-lamination, rhizoliths and
small carbonate nodules (3 cm diameter).

The Schoenstatt section is interpreted as a facies
association of channel and floodplain deposits. The upper
sandstone is interpreted as an in-channel deposit of a low
sinuosity river with flanking semi arid and sparsely vegetated
floodplain represented by the mudrock dominated
interchannel sequences.

Tetrapod paleofauna
Abdala et al. (2001) were the first to describe the fauna

collected at the Schoenstatt outcrop, where more than 50
bone elements of cynodonts were observed, including skulls,
lower jaws and postcranium elements. They were classified
as herbivorous Traversodontids and one carnivorous
Chiniquodontid based on features of the postcanines.

Although Abdala et al. (2001) found only cynodonts at
the Schoenstatt outcrop, Machado &amp;amp; Kischlat (2003)
collected from the same locality several disarticulated bones
of the skull, a partial lower jaw and a few elements from the
hind limbs of a proterochampsid archosaur (Figure 4).

TAPHONOMIC DATA

The taphocoenosis occur in the form of loosely packed,
scattered bone elements forming a 5 m thick level with
approximately 10 m lateral extension at the outcrop, as
depicted by the schematic block diagram in Figure 3.

Data on fossil distribution and taphonomic signatures were
obtained by detailed stratigraphic description of outcrops and
acquiring taphonomic data such as fossil orientation,
disarticulation, preservation and association with fossil remains.

All collected specimen were identified and registered in
the fossil bone data bank of the vertebrate paleontology
laboratory of the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul
(data bank UFRGS PV-T). From analysis of these fossils and
the field data some observations can be made.

There is a predominance of skulls and lower jaws and a
disparity in the number of preserved pelvic girdles and
shoulder girdles (Table 1).

Carbonate concretions (Figure 5) are present in several
stratigraphic levels within the studied profile, but they are more
concentrated in association with the bone accumulations and
many of the bones are enveloped in a carbonate crust. X-ray
diffractometry and Scanning Electron Microscopy of the
concretionary material that occurs on the external surface (Figure
6A) of the bones as well as the internal permineralization shows
it to consist mainly of calcite, as is usually found in other
diagenetically affected bones from the Santa Maria Formation
(Andreis et al., 1980; Holz &amp;amp; Schultz, 1998). However, the analysis
did indicate the presence of silica, especially in the internal pores
of the bones (Reichel et al., 2005). The association of quartz and
calcite suggests that this area has a distinct mode of preservation,
where silica (quartz) filled the internal porous structure and
Volkmann and Haversian canals of the bones before the bone
material itself was replaced by calcite (Figures 6B, C).

Coprolites occur at the same stratigraphic level as the
bone accumulation. They consist only of external molds
secondarily infilled by calcite (Figure 7) and because no
internal structures are preserved, they have not yet been
accurately identified. The faunal composition of the
taphocoenosis is clearly biased towards herbivorous
cynodonts. The taphocoenosis consists of four types of
herbivorous cynodonts, one carnivorous cynodont and one
proterochampsid archosaur. Despite the taxonomic variety,
the low diversity of bone elements is noticeable, as well as
the rare occurrence of articulated skeletal segments.

Many different complete or fragmented lower jaws and
skulls, teeth (Figure 8), limb bones, vertebrae and other
indeterminate fragments were identified, but only one
articulated vertebral section and one pelvic girdle was found.
Two of the four preserved femora belong to herbivorous
cynodonts, which were huge in comparison to the archosaur
found in the taphocoenosis (Table 1).

DISCUSSION

Taphocoenosis of disarticulated and fragmented bones in a
floodplain setting can result from selective transportation by

hydraulic transportation and sorting. In addition, there is no
preferential orientation of the bones, indicating that there was
no competent unidirectional flow involved in the accumulation
of these bone elements. The fossil-bearing mudstone is relatively
homogeneous throughout the studied section, without
development of sandstone lenses, indicating slow settling of
suspended sediment within a low energy environment at the
bottom of a standing water body. Thus, there is no evidence for
running water as an agent for the bone concentration, and the
presence of fossils has to be explained by other factors than
hydraulic transportation, such as biogenic concentration.

The presence of a semi-aquatic proterochampsid
archosaur supports biogenic concentration as the key agent
of bone accumulation for this fossil assemblage. Bonaparte
(1971) and more recently Arcucci (1990) and Sill (1995)
suggested an aquatic habit for this archosaur group due to
adaptations such as a long rostrum, flattened skull and the
type of tooth insertion in the lower jaw. The protochampsid
remains in the bone accumulation suggests the proximity of
a relatively permanent body of water. This archosaur is

comparable to other Neomesozoic crocodilians which actively
preyed on smaller animals such as the herbivorous cynodonts.

In addition, isolated teeth were found lying on top of a
cynodont skull (Figure 9A) and other have a very irregular
stacking pattern, herein called a chaotic mode of preservation
(Figure 9B). These characteristics also strengthens the
hypothesis of biogenic concentration of this assemblage,
because running water could not stack the bones in that
way, hence, this mode of accumulation is very likely to be the
result of biogenic activity.

Another factor that corroborates the hypothesis of biogenic
concentration by predators/scavengers is the presence of
coprolites, because these are characteristic of areas with intense
predatory activity (Behrensmeyer, 1991) and is an indicative of
animal-plant or animal-animal interaction (Behrensmeyer &amp;amp;
Hook, 1992). The analyzed material exhibits surface
characteristics caused by extrusion muscles, but do not present
adherence of organic debris. Souto (2001) found the same
features in coprolites of other Triassic locations in Rio Grande
do Sul State. The fact that these coprolites are fossilized as
external moulds suggests similar conditions to those causing
the non-preservation of plant material in that outcrop.

The calcareous concretions occur isolated and in
association with the fossils, more densely in patches or
lenses. This pattern of areal distribution of the concretions is
typical of marginal pond environments (Hubert, 1978).

The presence and amount of carbonate nodules varies
within the geological section, indicating vertical oscillation of
the groundwater table (phreatic level). At higher positions,
plant and animal colonization led to the formation of porosity
of the soil profile. Cementation in the vadose zone is frequently
associated with rhyzoliths, which record the orientation and
position of former root systems (Beckner &amp;amp; Mosley, 1998).

At a later stage, this porous zone is filled with carbonate,
recording the marginal zone of the ponds formed when the
phreatic level intersects the floodplain surface (da Rosa et
al., 2003). At the base of the mudstone succession of the

Figure 4. The presence of a proterochampsidae archosaur is a

key factor for the interpretation of the fossil assemblage studied in

this paper, because this archosaur group had an aquatic habit, as

indicated by adaptations such as a long rostrum, flattened skull

and the type of teeth insertion in the lower jaw. This kind of

archosaur was capable of preying on small animals. A,

Schoenstatt outcrop, the phreatic level was low as suggested
by the rare occurrence of concretions, while at the fossiliferous
level abundance of concretions may indicate that the phreatic
level was appearing at the surface, forming an ephemeral
lake. In addition, the presence of rhyzolithes indicate
paleosols (Klappa, 1980), showing that this area was wet
enough to develop vegetation.

Caliche horizons found within the mudstones and
sandstones of the fluvial systems are the result of progressive
soil calcification which is characteristic of arid or semi-arid
climates, such as those prevailing during the Middle Triassic
(Holz &amp;amp; Scherer, 2000). The presence of caliche concretions
within the floodplain deposits suggests deposition under a hot
climate with alternating wet and dry seasons (Pierini et al., 2005)
forming ephemeral water bodies on the floodplain. During periods
of restricted rainfall, any standing water body would be quickly
occupied by the vertebrate groups that lived in the area

Origin of the taphocoenosis
The sedimentological and taphonomic data suggest that

the Schoenstatt outcrop area was an oasis on a semi-arid
floodplain, since vertebrate remains generally are rare in distal
floodplain deposits and, when they occur, they are preserved
as disarticulated or isolated postcranium elements, such as
vertebrae and ribs (Smith, 1980, 1993).

Since the fossiliferous association in the study area is
composed of 90% herbivorous and carnivorous cynodonts
and there is no evidence of hydraulic transport, we consider
that the composition of this taphocoenosis biased and does
not accurately reflect the composition of the fauna that lived
in the region at that time. The taphonomic pattern displayed
by the Schoenstatt outcrop leads us to the conclusion that
this bias is caused by biogenic concentration.

Wood et al. (1988), Dominguez-Rodrigo (1998), Hungerbühler
(1998) and recently Sanders et al. (2003) observed floodplain

sediments with fossiliferous concentration strongly biased
towards preservation of skulls and lower jaws, besides an uneven
relation between the number of preserved scapular and pelvic
girdles, and association of bone remains from different Voorhies
groups. These studies indicate that this kind of taphocoenosis
is formed as a result of predator/scavenger action. Skulls and
lower jaws represent bones with relatively low nutritional value
and therefore are usually discarded by predators (Behrensmeyer,
1991), hence they accumulate and concentrate in the floodplain.
Behrensmeyer &amp;amp; Boaz (1980) state that predation may result in
concentration of carcasses in habitats like swamps, ponds and
waterholes, where scavengers and predators may have dragged
dead animals away from the habitats in which they lived. When
lower jaws are broken posterior to the symphisis, this may indicate
predator action, because modern hyenas are known to break these
bones to access the tongue (Behrensmeyer &amp;amp; Boaz, 1980).

In the case of the Schoenstatt taphocoenosis, carnivorous
cynodonts and archosaurs were probably responsible for bone
concentration, although direct evidence of necrophagy or
predation (e.g., tooth marks) have not been recorded. Mechanical
removal of the caliche crust reveals a highly crazed bone surface,
hence precluding accurate observation of tiny structures such
as tooth marks. A similar situation is described by Smith (1980)
studying several outcrops from the Beaufort Formation (South
Africa), where predation/necrophagy is interpreted to be the
cause for the observed preservational bias of the taphocoenosis,
in spite of the lack of direct evidence. Njau &amp;amp; Blumenschine
(2006) point out that predators, such as the proterochampsid
archosaur of the Schoenestatt taphocoenosis, lived in aquatic
settings. Normally, they do not transport prey over long
distances and usually consume prey in the water, a short distance
from the kill site, typically on the shoreline. Njau &amp;amp; Blumenschine
(2006) suggest that mammalian carnivores gnaw and break bones
to various degrees in order to access marrow, grease and brain
tissue. Tooth-marking is inflicted during defleshing, gnawing,

and fragmentation. In contrast, crocodilians access these
nutrients by producing carcass segments, some of which can
be swallowed whole. Those parts that cannot be reduced in size
sufficiently may come to bear tooth marks and other bone
damage before being abandoned. The carcass parts that escape
consumption are discarded either complete or broken and allowed
to sink to the bottom of the pond. The discarded fragments are
referred to by Davidson &amp;amp; Solomon (1990) as “flown-off” pieces
and result in scattered and isolated fossil bone accumulations
with little or no evidence of gnawing and chewing, a pattern
very similar to the fossil record at the Schoenstatt outcrop.

Rogers &amp;amp; Broughton (2001) define three hypothetical agents
of biogenic selection of the bone remains, based on the difficulty
of disarticulation and transport of the selected part (i) unselective:
the hunter usually transports the entire preyed animal; (ii) more
selective: the hunter usually discards parts of low use before
transporting the carcass; (iii) most selective: the hunter usually
transports parts of highest use only. Based on this classification,
we suggest that the Schoenstatt taphocoenosis was caused by
most selective action, because skulls, lower jaws, tooth and
vertebral elements were preferentially preserved and all
considered elements with low nutritional value.

Taphonomic model
During deposition of the Schoenstatt strata a sequence of

biogenic, sedimentary and climatic events occurred leading to
the preservation of a biogenically concentrated taphocoenosis

which was diagenetically overprinted with silica and calcitic
cements (Reichel et al., 2005). The taphonomic model suggests
that the site of accumulation by biotic agents was controlled
by the migration of pond margins which were in turn controlled
by oscillations of the groundwater table (Figure 10).

The paleofauna encountered at the outcrop, such as the
carnivorous and herbivorous cynodonts and the archosaur,
would have lived in and around ephemeral lakes or ponds on
the floodplain. During the day-by-day situation, the water
bodies were sustained by the phreatic level controlled by
river channels. Under those conditions, some vegetation was
developed at the lake margins, as indicated by the presence

collected specimens. C, in a drought period, the already carbonate encrusted bones suffered an incipient silicification because of the

of rhyzoliths. This lush vegetation would have attracted
groups of herbivorous cynodonts and their predators.

During periods of drought, the water volume of the river
channels and the phreatic level were low, drying the
ephemeral lake. Sheet flood sedimentation during subsequent
overbank flow and rainstorms would effectively create a
chaotic mélange of isolated bones that were left on the lake
margin and bury them in the same event.

With the remains buried and the return of a high phreatic
level, the process of pedogenis calcium carbonate deposition
would have begun. The calcium carbonate carried by water

led to a biogenic concentrated tanathocoenosis around the
margins of a floodplain lake which was buried during periods
of flooding and over bank sedimentation;

The variable distribution of carbonate nodules along the
stratigraphic section of the Schoenstatt outcrop is indicative
of oscillations of the phreatic level. The close association of
root marks with nodules indicates periods of high water table.
During those periods the area of the Schoenstatt outcrop
was an ephemeral lake with abundant plant and animal life.

The Schoenstatt outcrop is representative of a humid
environment within a huge floodplain subjected to semi-arid
climatic conditions of the Middle Triassic. In this situation,
the ephemeral lake margin developed vegetation and attracted
herbivorous therapsids and, in their consequent carnivorous
predator and scavenger species, an ecologic situation which
resulted in a biased record, favoring the preservation and
accumulation of the least nutritious bone elements.

bones that were in the vadose zone, forming the external and
internal concretions observed in the collected specimen.

During a subsequent drought period, the carbonate encrusted
bones were subjected to incipient silicification, marking the early
diagenetic phase of the diagenetic process. This silica probably
precipitated in the carbonate encrusted bones because of the
geochemically active halo surrounding the bones, since calcium
carbonate creates an extremely alkaline microenvironment.

The absence of fossil bones and the small quantities of
carbonate nodules and rhyzoliths in the lower portion of the
mudstone section suggests a prolongated period of low phreatic
level, representing a period of drought situation that resulted in
formation of very low biomass during that period, hence the
absence of fossils in that part of the stratigraphic section.

Finally, using an analogy with recent ecosystems, the
locus represented by the Schoenstatt outcrop suggests an
oasis, with availability of water and vegetation, occurring in
the middle of a relatively extensive dry floodplain.

The Schoenstatt palaeoenvironment may be compared
with Etosha pan in Namibia, an extensive topographic
depression seasonally flooded, holding water for a short time
during the rainy season. During the dry season the landscape
changes. Large shallow lakes evaporate quickly and take the
form of salt-crusted, desiccated mud. Because of these
dramatic seasonal changes, species that reside here must be
able to adapt or migrate to other areas (Hipondoka, 2005).
The Etosha pan supports a great number of animals, such as
white rhinos, elephants, hunting dogs, lions, leopards, and
antelopes during the wet season (Mwalyosi, 1977). So, this
area seems to have the function of a wetland in the semi-arid
climate of Namibia, creating an oasis within the arid corridor
which stretches from the northeast of the African continent
to the coast of Namibia in the south-west (Bobe, 2006).

 The Schoenstatt outcrop is interpreted as the geological record
of a seasonally flooded pond, with huge concentration of calcium
carbonate, located at a great semi-arid floodplain, similar in many
ways to the present day environment of Ethosa pan in Namibia.

CONCLUSIONS

The taphonomic analysis presented here integrates
sedimentological and paleontological data to explain the formation
and preservation of a new type of taphocoenosis in South-Brazilian
Triassic rocks. Based on this data set, can be concluded that the
taphocoenosis had little or no direct influence of hydraulic transport,
as indicated (i) by the enclosing rock types (finely laminated and
massive mudstone of a distal floodplain setting) indicating slow
settling of suspended sediment, incapable to transport bones, (ii)
by the lack of orientation of the fossil bones and (iii) by the
noticeable mixture of bones with very different sizes and densities.

The taphocoenosis contains mainly bones of herbivorous
and carnivorous cynodonts (90%) and hydraulic
transportation appears to have played no role in its formation.
Thus the faunal composition is taken to reflect the original
biocoenosis, with a predominance of herbivores over
carnivorous individuals. The attritional accumulation of
bones discarded by the scavengers over multiple seasons
