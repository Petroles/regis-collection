Acknowledgements

A PhD is a very interesting scientific and personal challenge during which we

get to extend just a tiny bit further the current knowledge of mankind, preferentially in

a subject about which we are passionate, such as, let’s say, Coastal Oceanography. In

my case, I also have the hope that, somewhere along the line, the world will benefit

from the progress achieved.

Behind each author, there are always many people who made him who he is and

helped him persist and continue when the path was rougher or the will was weaker. My

PhD thesis is no more than another work made by someone who would certainly not

have succeeded if it were not for the support of many people along the way. Hence, I

wish I could thank individually every single person that contributed, in some measure,

to helping me carrying out this work to its end.

Agradec?o primeiro ao meu orientador, Paulo Silva, por me ter oferecido a possib-

ilidade de fazer esta tese e, desde o in??cio, ter acreditado que eu seria capaz de a

concluir. Obrigada por me ter proporcionado inu?meras oportunidades de desenvolver

novas capacidades, pelas boas trocas de ideias e por sempre me ter compreendido e

ajudado.

En deuxie?me, je remercie Herve? Michallet, mon superviseur du co?te? Franc?ais. Je te

remercie pour ton e?norme patience avec moi, ton partage de connaissance sur la manip

et sur notre domaine d’e?tude en ge?ne?ral, ton suivi infatigable et attentif au quotidien.

Je te remercie aussi et surtout pour ton co?te? humain et ton ouverture au dialogue qui

ont permis de surmonter les pe?riodes plus complique?s. Je suis bien contente de l’effort

que nous avons tous les deux fait pour s’adapter a? nos personnalite?s (tre?s) particulie?res:

cela? m’a fait grandir. Si un point hors d’une courbe de tendence ne sera plus jamais

dans ma vie juste un point hors d’une courbe de tendance, c’est gra?ces a? toi. Mais si

j’ai finis cette the?se c’est aussi, sans aucune doute et en grande mesure, gra?ces a? toi.

Encore dans le cadre de travail de cette the?se, merci aux techniciens qui ont tou-

jours e?te? disponibles pour aider pendant les expe?riences sur le canal a? houle du LEGI.

Obrigada tambe?m a toda a gente que contribuiu para o bom desenrolar das diversas

campanhas de campo em que participei em Portugal. Agradec?o ainda a? Fundac?a?o da

Cie?ncia e Tecnologia pelo financiamento da bolsa que me permitiu levar a cabo este

doutoramento.

I would like to thank as well the reviewers of this work and all its potential readers,

for the time spent reading it and thinking about it. I hope you have enjoyed it.

During my PhD thesis I had the great chance to spend significant periods of time

abroad, which I cherished a lot. It is when you get out of your comfort zone that you



evolve, personally, and scientifically as well. However, each time you go abroad, you are

far from your home, your routine, your friends, your family. It makes sense to explain

this, so that people can understand how much I am thankful to everyone that helped

me “to arrive” over and over again, that received me the best way possible and thus

undoubtedly contributed to the success of this thesis.

A mis compan?eros de carrera y de piso en Santander, que me recibira?n tan bien, me

acompan?aran e hicieran de los tres meses que pase? all?? una buena experiencia de inicio

de tesis.

To all the GLOBEX team, for the intense month passed in Delft, for sharing your

knowledge and giving me the best motivation possible for my first year of PhD. Thank

you as well for the interesting exchanges of ideas, the support provided when necessary

and the good times spent together.

A? tous les gens que j’ai connu en France, que maintenant j’appelle des amis ou famille.

Merci Thibaud, pour avoir e?te? le premier a? m’ouvrir ta porte en toute confiance, a?

m’amener de partout parmi tes amis, a? me pre?senter les Alpes. Tu resteras toujours

parmi ceux qui m’ont accueilli d’une telle fac?on que je n’oublierai jamais. Merci Marine

aussi et a? tout le 123, vous e?tiez vraiment fondamentaux a? mon inte?gration en France et

aux bons moments passe?s la?-bas. Merci a? mes premiers colocs, Guillaume, Javi, Re?mi,

pour avoir toujours rempli mon quotidien de plein de bonnes choses, pour le soutien

dans les moments plus difficiles de la the?se et de la vie en France, pour avoir e?te? comme

une famille pour moi. Merci a? tous ces Saint Hilairois qui me font toujours de?couvrir

le bonheur d’habiter en montagne, me?me si la mer est bien loin. Spe?cialement parmi

ceux-la?, merci a? Ze?lie et Santiago (et Luce!) d’avoir soutenu toujours avec la bonne

humeur ma fin de the?se et tout ce qui vient avec. Merci a? tous les amis du LEGI pour

les discussions philosophiques insolites a? midi et pour rendre si agre?able l’environnement

de travail. Merci Nadia et Jean-Lou, pour avoir fait de chez vous un petit chez moi

aussi.

Esta secc?a?o de agradecimentos esta?, de uma certa forma, tacitamente organizada

por antiquidade crescente, por imutabilidade crescente, digamos. Assim sendo, bem

perto do final, quero agradecer a todos os meus amigos da beira-mar. Obrigada por

continuarem a seguir ao meu lado nesta vida e por aceitarem, sem cobrar, a minha

ause?ncia intermitente nestes u?ltimos anos. Teria sido bem mais duro o meu tempo de

tese se isto fosse de outra forma.

Agradec?o ainda, e sobretudo, a? minha fam??lia. Por me terem sempre apoiado ao longo

desta tese (e da vida!), por suportarem, ano apo?s ano, a minha ause?ncia e aturarem

os altos e os baixos e me convencerem, uma e outra vez, de que era capaz de chegar

ao fim. Aproveito tambe?m para vos pedir desculpa, desculpa por todos os momentos



em que na?o estive presente por estar a construir o meu caminho. Obrigada por sempre

me encorajarem a seguir as minhas escolhas e por me apoiarem incondicionalmente

nessas escolhas. Sem voce?s na?o seria a pessoa que sou, na?o teria chegado aqui, na?o teria

havido tese.

Et a? toi, Seb, obrigada por tudo.

abstract Wave nonlinearities have long been recognised as being among the
main drivers of sediment transport in the coastal zone. However, there
are still significant errors in the prediction of this transport associated,
partially due to inaccurate predictions of the velocity nonlinearities. The
infragravity waves, which coexist with the short waves in the coastal
zone, are long-period waves (with 20-200 s) associated to the short-
wave groups. Their generation, propagation and dissipation mechanisms
are already reasonably well understood, but their influence on sediment
transport is still very poorly characterised.

In order to (i) improve current predictions of velocity nonlinearities and
(ii) investigate the role of infragravity waves in sediment transport, new
experiments were carried out both in a fixed-bed wave flume and in
a light-weight-sediment wave flume. The physical-modelling data set
is used in combination with field data and numerical simulations for
studying both subjects.

Existing parameterizations of velocity nonlinearities account only for the
influence of local wave parameters (e.g. wave height, wave length and
water depth), which leads to considerable estimation errors, especially
of the maximal values of nonlinearity. This work shows that the velocity
nonlinearities depend also on non-local wave parameters: (i) offshore
wave steepness, (ii) offshore spectral bandwidth and (iii) beach slope.
A new parameterization is proposed, which reduces by about 50% the
root-mean-square error relatively to former parameterizations.

The experimental results in the light-weight-sediment wave flume demon-
strate that wave conditions with the same short-wave energy, but differ-
ent low-frequency modulation, shape different equilibrium beach profiles.
The influence of the infragravity waves on the sediment transport is
confirmed and depends on two different mechanisms: (i) advection of
the short-wave suspended sediment by the infragravity-waves, which
is dependent on the infragravity-wave height and phasing with the
short-wave groups and (ii) modulation of short-wave nonlinearities by
infragravity-wave motion, both directly and indirectly, through water-
depth modulation.

Changes in the beachface morphology induced by infragravity waves
are connected to beach-profile changes in the surf and inner-shoaling
zones, highlighting the existent link between the different zones of the
cross-shore beach profile.

modelac?a?o nume?rica, dados de campo

resumo As na?o-linearidades das ondas de superf??cie sa?o desde ha? algum tempo
reconhecidas como um dos principais promotores do transporte sedi-
mentar na zona costeira. Contudo, existem ainda erros significativos
na estimativa do transporte devidos, entre outros, a uma imprecisa
descric?a?o das na?o-linearidades da velocidade do escoamento orbital.
As ondas infragrav??ticas, que coexistem com as ondas curtas na zona
costeira, sa?o ondas de longo per??odo (20-200 s) associadas aos grupos
de ondas curtas. Os mecanismos de gerac?a?o, propagac?a?o e dissipac?a?o
destas ondas sa?o actualmente razoavelmente bem compreendidos, mas
a sua influe?ncia no transporte sedimentar ainda apresenta limitac?o?es.

Com o objectivo de (i) melhorar as parameterizac?o?es existentes das
na?o-linearidades da velocidade e (ii) investigar o papel das ondas infra-
grav??ticas no transporte sedimentar, foram realizadas novas experie?ncias
em dois canais de ondas, um de fundo fixo e outro de fundo mo?vel com
sedimentos de baixa densidade. Os dados obtidos nos modelos f??sicos
foram utilizados conjuntamente com dados de campo e de simulac?o?es
nume?ricas para investigar ambos os temas.

As parameterizac?o?es existentes para as na?o-linearidades da velocidade
te?m apenas em conta a influe?ncia de para?metros locais de onda (e.g.
altura de onda, comprimento de onda e profundidade de a?gua), o
que resulta em erros considera?veis nas estimativas, em particular dos
valor ma?ximos de na?o-linearidade. Este trabalho evidencia que a na?o-
linearidade da velocidade depende tambe?m de para?metros que na?o
sa?o locais: (i) a declividade da onda ao largo, (ii) a largura da banda
espectral ao largo e (iii) o declive da praia. Uma nova parameterizac?a?o
que reduz em cerca de 50% o erro dos resultados obtidos com as
parameterizac?o?es existentes e? proposta.

Os resultados experimentais obtidos no canal de ondas com fundo mo?vel
demonstram que climas de agitac?a?o mar??tima com a mesma energia
de ondas curtas, mas com diferente modulac?a?o de baixa freque?ncia,
moldam perfis de praia diferentes. A influe?ncia das ondas infragrav??ticas
no transporte sedimentar e? posta em evide?ncia e processa-se atrave?s de
dois mecanismos distinctos: (i) advecc?a?o pelas ondas infragrav??ticas de
sedimento colocado em suspensa?o pela acc?a?o das ondas curtas, a qual
e? dependente da altura das ondas infragrav??ticas e da sua fase relativa-
mente aos grupos de ondas curtas e (ii) as ondas infragrav??ticas alteram
as na?o-linearidades das ondas curtas, tanto directa como indirectamente,
atrave?s da modulac?a?o da altura da coluna de a?gua.

As variac?o?es morfolo?gicas da face da praia induzidas pelas ondas infra-
grav??ticas esta?o associadas a alterac?o?es do perfil de praia nas zonas de
surf e de empolamento, evidenciando o elo existente entre as diferentes
zonas do perfil transversal da praia.

resume? Les non-line?arite?s des ondes de surface, qui se caracte?risent par leur
aspect dissyme?trique, sont reconnues comme l’un des principaux moteurs
du transport de se?diments en zone littorale. Cependant, l’estimation du
transport reste imparfaite, en partie du fait d’une description inexacte
des non-line?arite?s de la vitesse de l’e?coulement orbital. Les ondes infra-
gravitaires, qui coexistent avec les ondes courtes en zone littorale, sont
des ondes de longue pe?riode (20-200 s) associe?s aux groupes d’ondes
courtes. Les me?canismes de ge?ne?ration, propagation et dissipation de
ces ondes sont maintenant relativement bien compris, mais leur effet
sur le transport se?dimentaire est encore mal connu.

Afin (i) d’ame?liorer les parame?trisations existantes des non-line?arite?s
de vitesse et (ii) d’e?tudier le ro?le des ondes infra-gravitaires dans le
transport se?dimentaire, de nouvelles expe?riences ont e?te? re?alise?es dans
deux canaux a? houle, l’un avec un fond fixe et l’autre avec un fond
mobile constitue? de se?diments de faible densite?. Les donne?es obtenues
avec ces mode?les physiques ont e?te? utilise?s conjointement a? des donne?es
de terrain et des simulations nume?riques pour e?tudier les deux sujets.

Les parame?trisations classiques pour les non-line?arite?s de vitesse
prennent seulement en compte l’influence de parame?tres locaux (la
hauteur de vague, la longueur d’onde et la profondeur d’eau), ce qui
entra??ne des erreurs importantes dans les estimations, en particulier
les valeurs maximales de non-line?arite?. Ce travail montre que les non-
line?arite?s de vitesse ont aussi une de?pendance avec des parame?tres
qui ne sont pas locaux: (i) la cambrure de vague et (ii) la largeur de
la bande spectrale au large, ainsi que (iii) la pente de la plage. Une
nouvelle parame?trisation est propose?e, qui re?duit d’environ 50% l’erreur
sur les re?sultats obtenus avec les parame?trisations existantes.

Les re?sultats expe?rimentaux obtenus dans le canal a? houle avec un fond
mobile montrent que des conditions de vagues avec la me?me e?nergie
d’ondes courtes, mais avec une modulation basse fre?quence diffe?rente,
mode?lent des profils de plage diffe?rents. L’influence des ondes infra-
gravitaires sur le transport se?dimentaire est mis en e?vidence par deux
me?canismes distincts: (i) l’advection par les ondes infra-gravitaires
de se?diment mis en suspension par l’action des ondes courtes, qui
de?pend de la hauteur des ondes infra-gravitaires et de leur phase par
rapport aux groupes d’ondes courtes et (ii) les ondes infra-gravitaires
modifient les non-line?arite?s des ondes courtes, que ce soit directement
ou indirectement, par modulation de la hauteur de la colonne d’eau.

Les variations morphologiques du haut de plage induites par les ondes
infra-gravitaires sont associe?es a? des changements du profil de la plage
dans les zones de de?ferlement et de leve?e, en mettant en e?vidence le
lien entre les diffe?rentes re?gions du profil transversal de la plage.

Chapter 1

Introduction

1.1 Research context

According to the United Nations Ocean Atlas, more than 40 % of the population of

the world lives nowadays within 150 kilometres of the sea. Coastal cities are usually

important ports favouring commerce and fishing. Ocean-related recreation and tourism

are rapidly growing, being an important vector of development and economical growth.

Most of the megacities of the world with more than 2.5 million inhabitants are located

in the coastal area. Unfortunately, the rapid increase of people living near the coast

has generated an imbalance of the natural system.

The coastal-erosion problem is a typical example of such an imbalance. Affecting

coasts worldwide, it is currently one of the greatest problems of the coastal zones where

human occupation is intense. On a geological timescale, the oceans of the world have

risen and retreated several times before. Each time, the coast has adapted, advancing

or retreating. After the last glaciation, about 20,000 years ago, a fast rise of the mean

sea-level of about 8 mm/year was observed, until about 7,000 years ago, slowing down

to 1.4 mm/year at present (Komar, 1976). The sea-level rise during the last 20,000

years has left the coast out of equilibrium and the coastline configuration unadjusted to

the existing wave climate. Therefore, in the last 7,000 years, the coast has been trying

to adapt naturally, eroding capes and filling estuaries, trying to smooth the coastline

(Komar, 1976). Furthermore, global warming is nowadays contributing to an expansion

of the oceans, which also adds to the sea-level rise (IPCC, 2014). Global warming

and associated climate change may further contribute to increase storm frequency and

intensity (IPCC, 2014), which is expected to contribute to beach erosion as well. On

a shorter time scale, human action has actively contributed to aggravate the problem

of coastal erosion, with sand dredging and dam construction in rivers resulting in a

decrease of the sediment input to the beaches. Diverse coastal engineering solutions

1



Section 1.2 Chapter 1. Introduction

were built in the last decades (groynes, sea-walls, ...) to help tackling this problem, but

unfortunately these frequently end up by solving the problem only locally.

The sea-level rise and the shortage of sediments are only part of the problem. The

other part is the intense occupation of the retreating littoral zone. While wild coasts

will continuously adjust to sea-level rise and to eventual changes of the wave climate,

the wide stretches of coast too intensely occupied by people have to be protected. Since

the cost of relocating coastal populations and infrastructures is often too great to be

afforded, other solutions must be found.

In order to find solutions for the problem of coastal erosion and thus to help coastal

management, the dynamics of the coastal system must be well understood. If accurate

predictions of the evolution of the coastline are to be made, all the processes contributing

to the sediment transport, and thus to the changing of the beach morphology, must be

thoroughly analysed and weighted.

The processes involved in sediment transport are many and complex and act on a

wide range of time and space scales, from seconds to millennia, from the tiniest clay

grain to an entire delta. Hence, it is a long and ambitious task to achieve a complete

understanding of the sediment transport and morphodynamic processes of a coastal

system. Since the mid of the twentieth century, many researchers have made their

contribution to this task, but many questions remain unanswered.

1.2 Motivation and objectives

Wave and velocity nonlinearities have long been recognised as being amongst the

main drivers of sediment transport and have recently started to be incorporated in

sediment transport models, which can then be used to simulate real situations. However,

there are still significant errors in the prediction of the sediment transport associated,

among others, to inaccurate predictions of the velocity nonlinearities. Therefore, one of

the aims of this thesis is to improve the comprehension of these nonlinearities, in order

to obtain better estimations of sediment transport and thus better predictions of the

coastal evolution.

Most damage done by waves on coastal zones and human infrastructure happens

during storms, particularly when they occur during spring tides. During the storms,

low-pressure systems drive strong winds that can be acompagnied by storm surges

(local rise of the sea-level) and big waves that can have an important impact on the

coast, either taking offshore important quantities of sediment or promoting overwash

and inundation of the upper beach. It is during storms that infragravity waves are more

commonly seen to dominate the water motion very close to the shore. These are long

2



Chapter 1. Introduction Section 1.3

period waves (20-200 s) that are associated to the short-wave groups and modulate the

water-depth at the coast, allowing greater short waves to propagate higher up the beach.

They can thus have an important role on dune and beach erosion. However, the effect

of these waves on sediment transport is still very poorly characterised and quantified.

Hence, the other main objective of this thesis is to develop the current knowledge on the

sediment transport by infragravity waves, aiming to contribute, once again, to a better

comprehension of the sediment transport processes, especially during storm conditions.

If wave action and sediment transport during storms are well understood and can be

predicted in advance, damage to coastal infrastructures and beaches can ultimately be

minimised.

1.3 Organisation of the thesis

This thesis is organised in five chapters. A description of the contents of each chapter

is subsequently presented.

Chapter 1 - Introduction - introduces the work developed in the thesis and

its context, motivation and general objectives.

Chapter 2 - Fundamentals of coastal dynamics - describes the fundamental

concepts that constitute the basis of this thesis: the cross-shore beach profile and its

hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes.

Chapter 3 - Wave propagation and nonlinearities - based on the physical

model data set of the GLOBEX project, on field data and on SERR1D numerical-

model runs, it brings insight on wave and velocity nonlinearities. The chapter starts

by an introduction, where the state of the art on wave and velocity nonlinearities is

presented together with the organisation of the chapter. Then, the GLOBEX project

data and measurements are described and analysed, with a special emphasis on wave

nonlinearities and infragravity waves. Field data and SERR1D numerical-model runs

are used to extend the results of the GLOBEX data analysis. The discussion of the

different results culminates in the improvement of the Ruessink et al. (2012) parameter-

ization for the velocity nonlinearities, by the introduction of a dependence on a new

parameter and on spectral bandwidth. The chapter draws to an end with the conclusion.

Chapter 4 - The role of infragravity waves on beach morphodynamics-

presents the results of a set of experiments performed in the LEGI light-weight-sediment

flume with three different wave conditions, for which short-wave energy was kept

constant and IG-wave height was varied. At first, the state of the art of the role of

infragravity waves on sediment transport and the organisation of the chapter are presen-

ted. This is followed by a methodology section, where the LEGI experimental facility is

described, as well as the input wave conditions, instrumentation and associated methods.

Subsequently, the evolution of the beach towards equilibrium is analysed and the role

of infragravity waves on sediment transport is more thoroughly examined through the

analysis of the beach response to two-wave-group runs, in terms of hydrodynamics and

morphodynamics. After a discussion of the different mechanisms by which infragravity

waves contribute to sediment transport, the chapter ends with the conclusion.

Chapter 5 - Conclusions and perspectives - summarises the work developed

and the conclusions of the previous chapters and highlights the existing limitations and

possible solutions, together with future perspectives of research.

Fundamentals of coastal dynamics

2.1 The beach profile

The nearshore ocean starts where the waves first feel the sea bed, and extends all the

way to the coast. Many different types of coasts can be found in nature, from high cliffs

to gravel or sandy beaches, from coral environments to complex delta systems. The

action of the processes driving the dynamics of the nearshore region can be separated

in two components: the cross-shore direction and the long-shore direction. In this work,

the focus will be on the dynamics of the sandy beaches for processes acting in the

cross-shore direction only.

The cross-shore beach profile is one of the most important characteristics of natural

sea coasts, since it can be used to evaluate the accretion or erosion of a specific coastal

site, as well as the vulnerability of particular regions (Didenkulova &amp;amp; Soomere, 2011).

It can be schematically divided in different zones, based on the wave propagation and

hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes, as shown in Fig. 2.1. Each hydrodynamic

zone can be further divided into smaller sections, for convenience: the shoaling zone

Swash zone Surf zone Shoaling zone

Breaker zone

Section 2.1 Chapter 2. Fundamentals of coastal dynamics

into the outer- and the inner-shoaling zones, the surf zone, analogously, into the outer

and inner-surf zones and the swash zone into the upper and lower swash zones.

The beach profile shape depends, at each moment, on the balance between the different

hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes at work along its length. However, for

study purposes, it is often assumed that a beach profile under constant wave forcing

will eventually reach a dynamic equilibrium state, with small variations around a stable

equilibrium shape. Dean (1977) modified an empirical equation, initially proposed by

Brunn (1954), to describe the shape of an equilibrium profile, which consists essentially

on a power law relating the water depth (h) to the offshore distance (x),

h = ? (xs ?x)2/3 , (2.1)

where ? is a proportionality constant that depends on the size of the sediment or,

alternatively, on the fall velocity (Dean, 1977) and xs is the position of the shoreline.

According to Eq. 2.1, the coarser the sediments, the greater is the value of ? and thus

the steeper is the beach.

In nature, the wave conditions are constantly changing. Therefore, an equilibrium

profile can only be defined as a spatial mean, along a certain coast, or a temporal mean,

during a given period of time. Very often this is done to classify beach profiles according

to their seasonality: a “summer” profile, associated with mild wave conditions, has

generally a large berm and a steep beachface; and a “winter” profile, resulting from

highly-energetic wave conditions, has a shorter berm and a mild beachface. Wright &amp;amp;

Short (1984) have proposed a classification of the beach profiles according to the Dean

number, defined by

? =
Hc
Tcws

, (2.2)

where Hc and Tc are the characteristic height and period of the incident wave conditions

and ws the fall velocity of the sediment. Wright &amp;amp; Short (1984) have considered Hc

and Tc as the breaker wave height and period, respectively, but these variables can also

be defined for the offshore wave conditions, as was done by Dalrymple &amp;amp; Thompson

(1976).

Fig. 2.2 shows the beach-profile types that can be defined according to the Dean

number. For ? &amp;lt;1, the beaches are reflective, characterized by a relatively steep

and narrow beachface with a berm and a surf zone without bars. Waves are strongly

reflected (surging breakers are common), the sediments tend to be coarser and the surf

zone is narrow. On the other end, the dissipative beaches, with an ? &gt; 5, tend to be

wide and gently-sloping, with one or more linear bars. These type of beaches are the

result of high-energy waves that start breaking far offshore. The intermediate range

(1 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;5) represents a variety of barred and terraced beaches.

At a given location, the beach is constantly changing its shape. Mild wave conditions

will tend to force the beach towards a “summer” (reflective) profile, while storm waves

are responsible for driving the sediment fast offshore, changing the beach profile to a

“winter” (dissipative) state. In order to perceive the dynamics of the beach profile, the

hydrodynamics and morphodynamics processes involved must be understood.

2.2 Hydrodynamics

Fluid motions in the ocean are generated by different phenomena. The wind, pressure

differences, the rotation of the Earth and attraction by the moon, seismic and vulcanic

activity are some of the phenomena that can generate sea-surface waves and currents.

Each different forcing induces motions at a different scale of time and space, which are

illustrated in Fig. 2.3.

For describing the beach-profile evolution in the timescale of a day to a year, it is

the dynamics of the waves generated by the wind (associated to pressure systems) that

must be analysed (see Table 1a of Stive et al. (2002)). Waves can be generated locally

by the wind, starting as surface ripples, eventually evolving into wind waves. Their

characteristics depend on the intensity and duration of the wind and its fetch (distance

Chapter 2. Fundamentals of coastal dynamics Section 2.2

over which it blows). If the waves then travel a long distance from their generation

region, they will tend to organize in groups with similar amplitude and frequency, the

swell. Swell waves frequently co-exist with wind waves. Both these types of waves are

gravity waves, since the gravitational force is the restitution mechanism acting on the

free-surface of the sea when the waves propagate through it.

As the waves propagate from deep waters to the coast, they transform progressively,

diffracting, refracting, shoaling, breaking or dissipating their energy through bottom-

friction. Diffraction involves a change in the direction of the propagating waves as

they pass through an opening or around a barrier in their path and thus allows waves

to propagate into the lee zone (the sheltered zone) behind structures or geographical

features. The depth-induced refraction is the turning of the direction of wave propagation

when, in shallow water, the wave fronts travel at an angle with the depth contours.

Since the waves propagate more slowly in shallow than in deep water, the wave fronts

tend to become aligned with the depth contours. Wave refraction can also be caused by

currents.

Since the waves propagating towards the coast with a certain angle will thus tend

to align perpendicularly to the bathymetry, when they leave deep water, the most

relevant wave transformations take place along the cross-shore direction. Along this

direction, the waves shoal and dissipate their energy, mostly through breaking and

bottom friction.

2.2.1 Linear wave theory

In deep water, small-amplitude wave motion (H&amp;lt;&amp;lt;h) can be thought of as being

a pure sinusoidal movement that can be represented by the linear wave theory (Airy,

1845), as shown in Fig. 2.4. According to this theory, a progressive sinusoidal wave can

Figure 2.4: Sketch of a progressive sinusoidal wave (Abreu, 2011).

9



Section 2.2 Chapter 2. Fundamentals of coastal dynamics

be defined by a sinusoidal variation of the sea-surface ?, with a certain wave length L

(the horizontal distance between corresponding points on two successive waves), height

H (the vertical distance from crest to trough) and period T (the time between the

passing of two successive crests at a given point),

?(x,t) =
H

2
cos (kx??t) , (2.3)

where x is the spatial coordinate in the direction of wave propagation and t the temporal

coordinate, k is the wave number (k = 2?
L

) and ? is the wave angular frequency (? = 2?
T

).

In deep water, the particle motion during a wave cycle under a passing linear wave

follows circular orbits, whose diameter decreases with depth until the wave base (the

limit of fluid motion).

The linear sinusoidal waves are ideal small-amplitude waves that can only exist in

deep water ( h
L
&gt; 0.5). As the waves travel towards the coast and the water depth

decreases, the shoaling process begins. The waves start feeling the bottom and slow

down. This decrease of the phase velocity of the wave (c = L
T

) implies a decrease of its

kinetic energy. In order to maintain the total energy of the wave constant, the potential

energy increases and, therefore, the wave height also increases.

As the waves shoal, the particle motion below the free surface also changes, particu-

larly near the bottom. The circular orbits flatten and become elliptical and, in shallow

waters ( h
L
&amp;lt;0.05), the vertical component of the movement becomes negligible. This

means that, near the bottom, the horizontal particle displacements and the horizontal

velocities become large. Hence, to satisfy the no-slip condition at the seabed, a thin

layer where the wave-induced motion is strongly influenced by the bed develops: the

boundary layer. This layer is characterized by strong velocity gradients that lead to

noticeable shear stresses. This layer is particularly relevant to sediment transport,

because it is responsible for the mobilization and transport of the sediment particles.

Furthermore, this region is highly turbulent and, consequently, it is where most of the

dissipation of the flow energy occurs.

2.2.2 Nonlinear wave properties

Stokes (1847) was one of the first to observe and study the change of the wave shape

prior to breaking. He remarked that, as the waves approach the coast and propagate

into shallower water (transitional, 0.05 &amp;lt;h
L
&amp;lt;0.5, and shallow, h

L
&amp;lt;0.05 depths), their

shape changes, with a gradual peaking of the crests and flattening of the troughs, known

as an increase of wave skewness (horizontal asymmetry). At the end of the shoaling

zone and throughout the surf zone, the waves start loosing their vertical symmetry as

10



Chapter 2. Fundamentals of coastal dynamics Section 2.2

well, assuming a saw-tooth shape, with a steep front face and a more gently-sloping rear

face, increasing their asymmetry (Svendsen &amp;amp; Madsen, 1978; Elgar et al., 1988). This

transformation of the free-surface elevation along the cross-shore profile is illustrated in

Fig. 2.5.

As they propagate towards the coast, the waves induce a gradient of the excess

horizontal-momentum flux, which results in an increase of the mean water level after

the breakpoint (the set-up), compensated by a lowering of the mean water level offshore

of the breakpoint (the set-down) (Longuet-Higgins &amp;amp; Stewart, 1962). Furthermore, the

wave propagation towards the coast may induce an onshore-directed mass flux (a steady

second-order drift velocity, known as the Stokes drift, (Stokes, 1847)). In the surf zone,

the surf roller adds to the Stokes drift, increasing the mean onshore-directed mass flux.

This flux promotes an accumulation of water near the coast, which must then return

offshore. This happens by means of an offshore-directed return flow below the level of

the wave trough, the undertow. This processes are schematically described in Fig. 2.6.

Near the bed, the flow is affected by the bottom boundary layer. The wave bottom

boundary layer is generally a highly-turbulent layer due to the sediment roughness and

it has a limited thickness (of the order of 1-10 cm), since it cannot fully develop to a

stationary logarithmic flow profile due to the continuously-changing oscillatory flow.

Besides the purely oscillatory flow driven by the wave motion near the bed, there is also

an onshore mean current, known as the boundary-layer streaming (Longuet-Higgins,

1953).

The linear or small-amplitude wave theory described in the previous subsection

provides a useful first approximation to the wave motion. However, ocean waves are

generally not small in amplitude and, as they approach the coast and start shoaling and

increasing their height (H/h&amp;lt;&amp;lt;1 and H/L&amp;lt;&amp;lt;1 assumptions become progressively

invalid), the linear wave theory no longer provides a sound description. In order to

improve the linear theory and to better approach the complete solution of ocean waves,

a perturbation solution using successive approximations may be developed (e.g. Stokes,

Figure 2.5: Sketch of the wave-shape transformation and corresponding orbital motions as waves
propagate from deep to shallow waters (Abreu, 2011).

11



Section 2.2 Chapter 2. Fundamentals of coastal dynamics

Figure 2.6: Hydrodynamics of a barred beach (adapted from Grasso, 2009).

1847; Boussinesq, 1872; Korteweg &amp;amp; deVries, 1895). The extended theories, often called

nonlinear wave theories, have also the advantage of being able of taking into account

phenomena associated with the wave nonlinearity, such as the onshore-directed mass

transport mentioned before. The cnoidal, solitary and Stokes theories are examples

of nonlinear wave theories. Fig. 2.7 shows the wave profile shape as predicted by the

different wave theories.

As the the shape of the waves starts changing, with increasing skewness and

asymmetry, the corresponding orbital velocity near the bottom follows the variation of

the free-surface elevation, and also becomes nonlinear, as depicted in Fig. 2.8.

In the case of a purely-velocity-skewed oscillatory flow, the velocity at the wave crest

2011).

is higher, but of shorter duration than at the trough. This induces larger bed shear

stresses during the crest than during the trough. When the flow is purely velocity-

asymmetric, under the steep front face of the waves, the velocity varies rapidly from a

maximum negative (offshore) value to a maximum positive (onshore) value, promoting

rapid fluid accelerations. The accelerations induced by the motion of the rear face of the

wave are much smaller. This implies that, for velocity-asymmetric flows, acceleration

is skewed. Abrupt accelerations are associated with thinner boundary layers and thus

higher bed shear stresses for a given velocity magnitude (Elgar et al., 2001).

The near-bed orbital velocity skewness and asymmetry are crucial for sediment

transport and are thus important to quantify. In this work, the statistical definitions

for velocity skewness (Sku) and asymmetry (Asu) are used and calculated, according to

Elgar et al. (1988), with the following expressions,

Sku =
?(u?u)3?

?u3
, (2.4)

and

Asu =

?
(H (u?u))3

?
?u3

, (2.5)

where u represents the velocity time series, with the angle brackets denoting time-

average, ? represents the standard deviations and H is the imaginary part of the

Hilbert transform. The evolution of skewness and asymmetry can then be used to

describe the transformation of the near-bed velocity as the waves approach the shore.

Another way of describing this wave transformation along the cross-shore profile is in

terms of the energy present at each frequency in the wave spectrum, as is illustrated in

Fig. 2.9. Initially, when the waves leave deep water, most of the energy is concentrated

near the peak frequency (blue spectrum in Fig. 2.9). Then, as they progress into

shallower water, nonlinear triad interactions between the different frequency components

start taking place and changing the wave shape (Elgar &amp;amp; Guza, 1985). Energy is first

transferred from the primary wave components near the peak (f1 and f2, in the case

of bichromatic waves), towards secondary components that are multiples of the peak

frequency (for bichromatic waves, towards secondary components with the sum f1 + f2

or difference f1 ? f2 frequency). These secondary components are called super or
subharmonics, if they have, respectively, greater or smaller frequencies than the peak

frequency. The nonlinearly-excited secondary wave components are phase-locked to

the primary wave components, thus causing deviations from Gaussian statistics, such

as steep or asymmetric wave profiles (Norheim et al., 1998). If the harmonics are

in phase with the fundamental, this will result in skewed velocity, if they are out of

phase, the velocity will be asymmetric. Coincident with the shape transformation of

the incident ocean waves, the difference interactions also transfer energy to infragravity

waves (Herbers et al., 1994). This is depicted, for irregular waves, by the violet

spectrum in Fig. 2.9, which has greater energy in the lower frequencies than in the

fundamental-frequency range. This spectrum is typical of the swash zone, as the incident

waves and their superharmonics predominantly dissipate in the surf zone and thus

infragravity (lower-frequency) waves, even though they may partially reflect at the

beach, often dominate the wave run-up at the shoreline. The current state of the art

on the understanding of the wave and velocity nonlinearities is summarised in greater

detail in chapter 3.

2.2.3 Infragravity waves

Munk (1949) was the first to report low-frequency motions in the nearshore zone,

well outside the surf zone, which he called “surf beat”, suggesting their origin to be

related to the variability of mass transport by the incident waves into the surf zone.

Chapter 2. Fundamentals of coastal dynamics Section 2.2

Also known as infragravity waves (IG), subharmonic waves or, simply, long waves, these

are waves with longer periods than the gravity (short) waves, of the order of 100 s.

The incident waves propagating towards the coast are organized in groups. The higher

waves in each group induce a larger mass transport than the lower waves and hence the

difference in the momentum flux causes a transfer of fluid from the higher waves to the

lower ones, promoting the development of a “set-down” wave. This wave has the same

period and length of the short-wave groups and, for wave groups propagating over a

horizontal bed, it is phase-locked and in anti-phase with the short-wave envelope, being

thus called bound infragravity wave (Bie?sel, 1952; Longuet-Higgins &amp;amp; Stewart, 1962,

1964). The irregular waves, their envelope and the bound IG wave are represented in

Fig. 2.10.

For shoaling waves, the bound wave travels slightly slower than the wave groups,

which causes an increasing phase lag as the depth diminishes, eventually resulting in a

phase shift between IG waves and the wave groups. This phase shift (Masselink, 1995;

Janssen et al., 2003) is a crucial mechanism of energy transfer from the short waves to

the bound IG wave. What happens to the bound waves in the end of shoaling/beginning

of breaking is still a current topic of discussion in the research community. Many assume

from the theory of Longuet-Higgins &amp;amp; Stewart (1962) that the bound IG waves are

mostly released as free waves in the shoaling and breaking processes; others, such as

Baldock (2012), argue that the amplitude of the bound IG waves may in fact decay

following short-wave breaking, but the former will only be released as free waves when

the water is shallow enough for the dispersion relationship to be satisfied for these

waves. At the shore, the IG waves can partially reflect off the beach and propagating

seawards, as leaky waves, or become trapped at the coastline as edge waves (being

either longshore progressive or standing).

A second mechanism of IG-wave generation is also possible, directly related to the

variability of the short-wave breakpoint (Symonds et al., 1982). Resulting from the

varying amplitude of the incident waves (inducing slow oscillations in the wave setup),

the breakpoint changes its location, acting similarly to a wave-maker, radiating free IG

waves at the group frequency (and their harmonics), both shorewards and seawards.

Arriving at the shoreline, infragravity waves can either be fully reflected seawards,

become trapped at the coastline or dissipate. Battjes et al. (2004) found the normalized

bed slope parameter, ?, to govern dissipation at the shoreline and defined this parameter

as

? =
hx
?

?
g

h
, (2.6)

with h and hx the characteristic values of depth and bed slope in the region considered,

? = 2?f the angular frequency (with f the wave frequency) and g the acceleration

of gravity. Large values of ? imply a nearly-full reflection at the shoreline, whereas

for small values of ?, reflections at the shoreline are small. When the waves do not

fully reflect at the shoreline, part of the energy flux is directed shorewards and ends by

dissipating.

The mechanisms involved in infragravity-wave dissipation are not yet a topic of

consensus in the research community. Bottom friction (Henderson &amp;amp; Bowen, 2002),

nonlinear energy transfers to and from infragravity waves (Henderson et al., 2006;

Ruju et al., 2012) and self-self nonlinear interaction of infragravity waves leading to

infragravity-wave breaking (van Dongeren et al., 2007; de Bakker et al., 2014) are likely

to be significant dissipation mechanisms, with a distinct importance depending on the

location along the cross-shore profile.

Even though of much smaller amplitude in deep water than the short waves to

which they are associated, the infragravity waves may modulate the propagation of

the short waves. They can become particularly important near the coast, where the

energy transfer becomes near-resonant and, consequently, infragravity-wave height can

augment rapidly to over 1 m (Ruessink et al., 1998a; Se?ne?chal et al., 2011). In the

swash zone, where the amplitude of the short waves becomes very small, the infragravity

waves can dominate the hydrodynamics, controlling the water depth.

2.2.4 Swash zone

With a very different hydrodynamics from the rest of the beach profile, the swash zone

is the limit between the aerial and the submerged beach areas which is intermittently

covered and exposed by wave action. For monochromatic waves this region is well

defined, while for irregular waves the maximum run-up (excursion of the waves up the

beach above the mean water level), down-wash (excursion of the waves down the beach

below the mean water level) and set-up vary constantly in time.

A large range of scales and types of fluid motion may be present in the inner-surf

zone, which subsequently govern shoreline oscillations and swash hydrodynamics. Fig.

2.11 schematically represents the transfer of offshore energy into swash-zone oscillations.

If the surf zone is saturated (short-wave heights are depth-limited), the hydrodynamics

in the inner-surf zone may be expected to be dominated by infragravity waves and

cross-shore standing wave oscillations are usually observed at infragravity frequencies; if

it is unsaturated (local wave height independent of depth), short-wave energy dominates

the inner-surf zone, with incident bores collapsing at the shoreline and propagating

up the beach (Huntley et al., 1977; Guza &amp;amp; Thornton, 1982; Wright &amp;amp; Short, 1984;

Raubenheimer et al., 1996). The wave energy dominating the swash zone is thus

dependent on the relative magnitudes of short and IG wave energy in the inner-surf

zone, that are in turn dependent on the offshore wave groupiness (which can be seen as

the offshore short-wave variability). The type of swash motion that prevails is ultimately

dependent on the incident-wave conditions and beach morphology.

In natural beaches, high infragravity-energy levels, saturation and dissipation of

short-wave energy in the surf zone and saturation of bore-driven swash oscillations at

short-wave frequencies contribute to a dominance of IG-wave motion in the swash. For

irregular waves, the swash motion at both low and high frequencies is also dependent on

the interaction between successive swash events and the interaction between standing

waves and incident bores (Elfrink &amp;amp; Baldock, 2002).

Section 2.3 Chapter 2. Fundamentals of coastal dynamics

2.3 Morphodynamics

Different regimes of sediment transport can be identified, depending on the velocity

of the fluid and the characteristics of the sediment (Nielsen, 1992). The sediment

can be transported (i) near the bed, as bed load, rolling and sliding, (ii) by saltation,

an intermediate mode between suspension and bed load, when the sediments are

transported in suspension but impact the bed regularly, or (iii) as suspended load,

when particles rest suspended in the water column during the transport and move

with the fluid. There is also the sheet-flow regime, a particularly intense mechanism

of horizontal sediment transport near the bottom that includes the three modes of

transport previously mentioned (bed load, saltation and suspended load) and can be

found in different regions of the cross-shore profile, at sufficiently-high bottom shear

stresses.

The balance between the different hydrodynamic processes acting over a given

beach profile determines the direction of the net sediment transport. Since the beach

profile evolves during the action of any given wave climate, it becomes particularly

difficult to evaluate the individual contribution of each hydrodynamic process to the

sediment transport, as there are ever changing feedbacks between the morphology and

the hydrodynamics.

The energetics approach (Bagnold, 1963; Bowen, 1980; Bailard, 1981; Guza &amp;amp;

Thornton, 1985; Russell &amp;amp; Huntley, 1999) assumes the sediment transport rate to be

proportional to the dissipation of energy near the bed and provides an equation for

the total (bed and suspended load) time-averaged immersed-weight sediment transport.

This approach can be used to estimate the relative contribution of the different terms

containing powers of the instantaneous velocity, which can then be related to different

sediment-transport processes. Initially, the instantaneous near-bed cross-shore velocity

is decomposed into it mean, short and infragravity wave components, as

u = u + u?, (2.7)

where u? = u?S + u?IG, with u the total cross-shore velocity, u the mean flow component

and u? the oscillatory component, which can be divided into u?S, the velocity associated

with the short waves and u?IG, the velocity associated with the infragravity waves. The

total-load sediment transport equation can hence be obtained as

are the

gravity terms. The decomposition of the instantaneous near-bed cross-shore velocity will

be used later in this work to analyse the theoretical contribution of different mechanisms

to the sediment transport.

The distinct hydrodynamic zones of the cross-shore profile are also zones with a

different balance between the several sediment-transport mechanisms. Therefore, the

sediment transport processes at action in the shoaling zone, in the breaker and surf

zones and in the swash zone, are subsequently described.

2.3.1 Shoaling zone

If motions of very long period, such as the tidal currents, are ignored, in the

shoaling zone there are two main mechanisms promoting sediment transport. At higher

frequencies, skewed waves induce high crest velocities in the onshore direction that

mobilize and transport more sediment than the offshore-directed trough velocities

(Hsu &amp;amp; Hanes, 2004; Marin?o-Tapia et al., 2007). This is due to the fact that the

boundary layer has less time to grow during the rapidly-accelerating half-cycle, inducing

higher (absolute) velocity gradients and shear stresses than in the half-cycle with less

acceleration (Nielsen, 1992). However, under certain circumstances (such as relatively-

small wave periods, finer grains, rippled beds) the existence of phase-lag effects may

imply that, while the sediment may be put in suspension by the onshore phase of the

wave cycle, it may not settle immediately, staying in suspension until the offshore stroke

of the wave arrives, which contributes to an offshore transport.

At lower frequencies, even though infragravity waves are probably not capable of

suspending sediment, the velocities associated with these waves can advect sediment

already in suspension. In that sense, infragravity waves can be considered to behave

analogously to mean currents, advecting sediment suspended by short-wave action. In

the shoaling zone, the infragravity waves still bound to the wave groups contribute to

an offshore transport, as the greater short waves of each group are concomitant with the

negative phase of the IG-wave cycle (Osborne &amp;amp; Greenwood, 1992b). This transport

is usually an order of magnitude smaller than the onshore-directed transport by the

short waves (Baldock et al., 2011) and, in a general way, velocity skewness dominates

the shoaling-zone sediment transport, which is mainly induced by bed-shear stresses

(Ribberink et al., 2000).

19



Section 2.3 Chapter 2. Fundamentals of coastal dynamics

Besides the two main mechanisms mentioned, the boundary-layer streaming and,

near the end of the shoaling zone, the wave asymmetry, can also contribute to an

onshore sediment transport.

2.3.2 Breaker and surf zones

As the waves approach breaking, new mechanisms start contributing to sediment

transport. Besides being skewed, waves become asymmetric as well. The incipient

sediment motion can then be induced by fluid accelerations driven by pressure gradients

promoted by the steep front faces of asymmetric waves (Drake &amp;amp; Calantoni, 2001;

Calantoni &amp;amp; Puleo, 2006; Foster et al., 2006; Silva et al., 2011). Since more sediment is

mobilized by the crests than the troughs, free-stream asymmetry possibly triggers a

skewed shear stress in the boundary layer (van der A et al., 2010; Ruessink et al., 2011;

Berni et al., 2013), further favouring the onshore sediment flux. Short-wave breaking

contributes both for picking-up sediment from the bed and to generate wave turbulence,

both contributing to picking up, entrainment and suspension of the sediment in the flow.

Responding to the wave breaking, the undertow is the main mechanism transporting the

suspended sediment offshore (Marin?o-Tapia et al., 2007). The direction and magnitude

of the infragravity-wave contribution to sediment transport in the breaker and surf

zones are still currently under debate.

Infragravity-wave motion in the surf zone can affect sediment transport in different

ways. Depending on the phase relationship between the infragravity waves and the short-

wave groups, infragravity waves can have an important role modulating the propagation

of the short waves. Especially in shallow waters, these long waves can significantly

alter water depth, contributing to variations of the short-wave amplitude, which may

eventually induce changes in the breakpoint position. A concept of re-suspension

maxima (located at xr) can be defined, corresponding to locations of maximum bed

shear stress and maximum suspended sediment concentrations, associated with relative

wave height maxima. Fig. 2.12 illustrates this concept. Landward (seaward) of a

re-suspension maximum, the net transport by infragravity waves is directed onshore

(offshore), responding to the landward (seaward) infragravity-wave stroke (Aagaard

&amp;amp; Greenwood, 2008) that “picks up” the sediment at the re-suspension maximum,

where the sediment concentration is large, and advects it shorewards (seawards). The

infragravity-wave strokes directed towards (and not away from) the re-suspension

maximum (both from more seaward or more shoreward positions) do not encounter

enough suspended sediment to advect.

Furthermore, if a partially-standing wave is set up by reflection of infragravity waves

at the shoreline, a second-order mass transport can be associated with the infragravity-

20

wave motion (if the motion is steady and the frequency well defined) (Vicinanza et al.,

2011). Therefore, even if short waves are responsible for most gross sediment transport,

overall, the morphological evolution depends on gradients in the sediment transport and

these can subtly change over the timescales of infragravity waves and wave groups. The

current state of the art on the role of IG waves in the sediment transport is described

in greater detail in chapter 4.

Nearshore sand bars are a typical feature of the beach profiles which influences the

evolution of the shoreline. Two hypothesis are currently proposed for sand-bar formation

(Dally, 1987). The first hypothesis proposes that bars may form near the breakpoint of

short incident waves, resulting from the convergence of sediment transported onshore

in the shoaling zone by the wave asymmetry, and offshore in the surf zone by the

bed return flow. In this case, slow bar onshore migration and growth are driven

by an asymmetry-induced transport, while mean-current-induced sediment transport

(undertow) systematically contributes to offshore bar migration. Skewness-induced

transport can either drive onshore or offshore bar migration (Dubarbier et al., 2015).

The other hypothesis is that bars may be generated at the antinodes of standing

infragravity waves (infragravity-wave velocity nodes), as these represent locations of

potential sediment convergence.

21



Section 2.3 Chapter 2. Fundamentals of coastal dynamics

2.3.3 Swash zone

An important part of the littoral sediment transport occurs in the swash zone, with

sediment concentrations that may typically be several orders of magnitude higher than

in the inner-surf zone (Beach &amp;amp; Sternberg, 1991). Offshore and onshore sediment

transport in the swash zone thus contribute significantly to shoreline accretion and

erosion. The swash zone is characterized by strong and unsteady flows, high turbulence

levels, large sediment transport and rapid morphological change (Puleo et al., 2000).

In this zone, the net sediment transport is the result of two opposing quantities (the

transport during the uprush and the backwash), each of which is several orders of

magnitude higher than the resulting net transport, which makes it very difficult to

measure and to model.

Sediment transport in the swash zone occurs predominantly under sheet-flow condi-

tions, over a flat bed, with different forcing phenomena acting as sediment-transport

controlling mechanisms, such as wave breaking and bore collapse, backwash, sediment

advection, infiltration/exfiltration effects, fluid-velocity asymmetries, infragravity waves,

wave groups and acceleration asymmetry in the cross-shore flows. Fig. 2.13 offers a

schematic summary of the processes at action and modes of sediment transport present

during a swash cycle.

The uprush is generally dominated by bore turbulence, especially on steep beaches

Figure 2.13: Schematic representation of the sediment transport processes during a swash cycle
(Masselink et al., 2006).

22



Chapter 2. Fundamentals of coastal dynamics Section 2.3

and in the lower-swash zone, with large shear stresses mixing the sediment higher in

the water column, which is then transported as suspended load. The velocity and

landward extent of the uprush is controlled by the forcing conditions in the surf zone,

beach gradient and sediment characteristics (Inch et al., 2015). Flow velocities are

onshore-directed during the uprush, but flow in the lower-swash zone often reverses

before the uprush has reached its maximum landward extent (Masselink &amp;amp; Puleo,

2006). Backwash flows are dominated by bed-generated turbulence (Petti &amp;amp; Longo,

2001; Cowen et al., 2003), accelerating under the forces of gravity and offshore-directed

pressure gradients (Baldock et al., 2001). Flow velocities are similar for both phases

of the swash, but typically of unequal duration, with a longer backwash with slightly

weaker velocities (Puleo et al., 2003; Masselink et al., 2005; Aagaard &amp;amp; Hughes, 2006).

The swash motion is inextricably linked to the morphology of the beachface, whose

most characteristic feature is its gradient, steeper than the rest of the beach profile. Only

when the uprush transports onshore the same amount of sediment that the backwash

transports offshore is a dynamic equilibrium reached between the beachface and the

swash motion. The equilibrium gradient represents the balance between onshore swash

asymmetry and the downslope gravity component (Hardisty, 1986), and the sediment

size is the most important factor controlling it. The sediment size influences the sediment

fall velocity, but also the permeability of the bed and thus the in/exfiltration effects,

which condition the sediment transport during the uprush and backwash phases of the

swash motion. For a given sediment size, the equilibrium beachface gradient decreases

with the wave height and increases with the wave period (Dalrymple &amp;amp; Thompson,

1976).

The response of the beachface to changing hydrodynamic conditions can be under-

stood in terms of how far the beach profile is, at each moment, from the equilibrium

conditions that correspond to the hydrodynamic conditions. A net onshore sediment

transport will dominate when the beachface is too gentle, with the uprush moving

more sediment than the backwash, eroding the lower part of the beach and depositing

the sediment in the upper part. When the beach is too steep, the backwash will

transport more sediment than the uprush, eroding the upper part of the beach and

depositing the sediment in the lower part. The swash period will also be affected, as a

steepening/flattening of the beachface results in a decrease/increase of the swash period.

The beach gradient of the lower swash zone further controls the type of breaker or bore,

thus playing an important role in the amount of turbulence and sediment suspension.

Hence, the processes of beachface steepening or flattening constitute a local feedback

between swash hydrodynamics and beachface morphology and evolve continuously until

the beachface is in equilibrium with the wave conditions.

23



Section 2.3 Chapter 2. Fundamentals of coastal dynamics

Not only do the swash morphodynamics have their own feedback mechanisms, but

there also interact with the surf-zone morphodynamics. When the beachface is eroded,

sediment is deposited in the surf zone, shifting the location of short-wave energy dissip-

ation from the lower beachface to the surf zone. This results in less short-wave-driven

swash dynamics, as less short-wave energy reaches the base of the beachface. If, instead,

sediment is transported from the surf zone to the beachface, short-wave breaking may

happen closer to the base of the beachface (as the local water depth increases), resulting

in a shifting of the short-wave energy dissipation back to the swash zone, which will be

exposed to higher short waves and more short-wave-driven swash dynamics. Moreover,

a change in the beachface gradient can modify the reflectivity of the beach, particularly

for IG waves, changing the amount of reflected infragravity-wave energy in the surf zone.

It is overall clear that the beachface cannot be considered in isolation from the surf

zone and that the two zones are strongly linked though feedback processes (Masselink

et al., 2006).

Chapter 3

Wave propagation and

nonlinearities

3.1 Introduction

Understanding nearshore morphodynamics implies a profound knowledge of the

hydrodynamics and the complex interaction between motions at different spatial and

temporal scales. Along the cross-shore beach profile, as the surface gravity waves

propagate from deeper waters to the shore, their shape changes, primarily due to

nonlinear wave interactions (Elgar &amp;amp; Guza, 1985; Doering &amp;amp; Bowen, 1995) and further

on due to breaking. The nonlinear effects amplify the higher harmonics and cause the

oscillatory flow to transform from sinusoidal in deep water, through velocity-skewed

in the shoaling zone, to velocity asymmetric in the inner-surf and swash zones. The

influence of skewness and asymmetry on sediment transport is hard to study, because

it is difficult to isolate those phenomena from other phenomena, such as the breaking-

induced turbulence, the undertow, etc. However, these nonlinearities are of paramount

importance for understanding sediment dynamics.

In addition to short-wave nonlinearities, the presence of IG waves and wave groups

also results in a wave-induced velocity and influences the short-wave hydrodynamics

and larger-scale processes, such as the formation of standing waves or cross-shore and

longshore nodal structures both inside and outside the surf zone (Baldock et al., 2011).

Further, IG waves can themselves contribute to velocity skewness and asymmetry at low

frequencies, particularly for very-dissipative mild-slope beach profiles, where IG-wave

shoaling and breaking can also occur (van Dongeren et al., 2007; de Bakker et al., 2014).

The role of short-wave nonlinearities on sediment transport has long been recognized.

Wave skewness was included in early analytical parameterizations of sediment transport

and sand-bar migration numerical models (e.g. Stive, 1986). Later on, it was recognized

25



Section 3.1 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities

that, to improve model performance, particularly regarding onshore sand-bar migration,

asymmetry should be considered as well. New parameterizations were proposed (e.g.

Drake &amp;amp; Calantoni, 2001; Elfrink et al., 2006; Abreu et al., 2010; Ruessink et al., 2012)

and it became more clear how to include the effects of asymmetry. Finally, the first

models capable of better representing onshore sand-bar migration have recently been

developed (e.g. Dubarbier et al., 2015; Ferna?ndez-Mora et al., 2015).

A great effort has been put into finding parameterizations and models capable of

correctly representing these nonlinear effects. Currently-used parameterizations still rely

mostly on an exclusive dependency of nonlinearity on local wave conditions to describe

skewness and asymmetry along the beach profile, even though with the precaution of

assuming the parameterizations are only valid for a certain type of beach slope or range

of offshore wave conditions. However, applying existing parameterizations to field data,

Rocha et al. (2013b) have suggested that defining Sk and As from local wave parameters

only is not enough, as the history of the wave propagation may also be important.

Furthermore, other researchers have already underlined the importance of considering

characteristics such as the offshore wave steepness (Dibajnia et al., 2001) and spectral

bandwidth (Norheim et al., 1998), as well as the beach slope (Norheim et al., 1998;

Dong et al., 2014; Filipot, 2015), in order to correctly describe the wave nonlinearity

at a given cross-shore position. There is, hence, a lack of thorough understanding of

which factors may effectively condition the evolution of wave nonlinearities besides the

local wave parameters (local wave height and period and water depth).

Therefore, the aim of this chapter is to analyse wave propagation and improve its

comprehension with respect to wave and velocity nonlinearities. The evolution of the

nonlinearities during the wave propagation towards the coast is explored in detail, for

a wide range of irregular and bichromatic wave conditions and different beach slopes.

The analysis is done for both free-surface elevation and velocity and comprises the

entire beach profile, from the shoaling zone until the end of the swash zone. The main

research questions explored are the following:

? How do short-wave nonlinearities evolve along the beach profile, for different wave

conditions?

? How do infragravity waves influence short-wave propagation and short-wave

nonlinearities?

? What is the importance of infragravity-wave nonlinearities?

? Which factors influence significantly wave and velocity nonlinearities?

? How can current parameterizations of nonlinearity be improved?

26



Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities Section 3.2

This chapter is divided into three main sections: physical modelling, numerical

modelling and parameterization of velocity nonlinearities. In the first section, a high-

resolution data set gathered during the GLOBEX Hydralab IV project, held in the

Deltares Scheldegoot in the Netherlands, is analysed. This section starts by describing

the experiments and preliminary data analysis. Then, the evolution of free-surface

elevation and cross-shore velocity are analysed and compared between conditions,

highlighting the particularities of each wave condition and the differences between

irregular and bichromatic wave groups. The importance of the lower frequencies is

evidenced and thus the IG waves are regarded more thoroughly. The IG-wave separation

into incident and reflected components is discussed and a comparison is made between

free IG waves and IG waves that propagate associated with short-wave groups. In the

last part of this section, the analysis of the nonlinearities is done for free-surface elevation

and velocity. From the analysis and comparison of the different wave conditions, it is

suggested that the evolution and maximal values of the nonlinearity may depend on

certain wave and beach characteristics.

The following section is based on the results of numerical simulations aimed at

extending GLOBEX wave conditions, in order to unravel which wave or beach parameters

are the most important in determining wave nonlinearities. These results, together

with the analysis of several field data sets, present new evidence of the dependence

of nonlinearities on offshore wave parameters and beach slope. Hence, in the last

section of this chapter, an improvement to the Ruessink et al. (2012) parameterization

is proposed, which takes into account new parameters and provides a better prediction

of the nonlinearities for a wider range of beach slopes and wave conditions. The chapter

draws to an end with the conclusion.

3.2 Physical modelling - the GLOBEX project

3.2.1 The experiments

The laboratory data set used in this chapter was collected during the GLOBEX

Hydralab IV project (Ruessink et al., 2013; Michallet et al., 2014), held in the Scheldegoot

(Fig. 3.1) in Delft, the Netherlands, in April 2012. The aim of this project was to collect

a high-resolution (in space and in time) data set of the cross-shore evolution of the short

and infragravity waves in a very gently-sloping beach, for a range of wave conditions,

including irregular, bichromatic and monochromatic waves. This data set was gathered

for the study of infragravity-wave dynamics, wave propagation and boundary-layer

dynamics. In the scope of this thesis, the focus of the analysis of GLOBEX data is on

the wave propagation (in particular, on the wave nonlinearities) and on the interaction

The GLOBEX beach had an impermeable concrete bed and was 110-m long and

1-m wide, with an initial plain section of 16.57 m, followed by a slope of 1/80 until the

end of the flume (Fig. 3.2). The shoreline was located at 84.57 m from the wave-maker

position at rest (x = 0), corresponding to a mean water depth above the plain section

of 0.85 m. The waves were generated by a piston-type wave-maker equipped with

Active Reflection Compensation (ARC) to absorb waves coming from the beach and

prevent their re-reflection at the wave-maker. All wave-paddle steering signals included

second-order wave generation. Table 3.1 presents the characteristics of the 8 wave

conditions that were simulated during the experiments.

narrow-banded case, similar to energetic swell conditions. Series B consisted of three

bichromatic wave cases. For B1 and B2 the amplitudes of the primary components (a1

and a2) were the same, and the difference frequency (IG-wave frequency) was different.

For B2 and B3, the same frequencies were chosen for the primary components, but the

group modulation of B3 was greater. C1 consisted on a monochromatic infragravity

wave with a period identical to the period of B2 and B3 IG waves. Each condition of

series A and B was run for 75 min, followed by a rest period of approximately 15 min.

C1 was run for 30 min.

A suite of instruments was deployed during all runs, including 22 wave gauges

(10 of resistive-type and 12 of capacitive-type), sampling at 128 Hz, for measuring

free-surface elevation, and 5 Electromagnetic Current Meters (ECM), sampling at 128

Hz as well, and 2 side-looking Acoustic Doppler Velocimeters (ADV), sampling at

200 Hz, for recording flow velocities. After all wave conditions were completed, most

instruments were repositioned and the same conditions were repeated with exactly

the same wave-board motion. Overall, 10 batches were run, resulting in a total of

190 positions along the flume with free-surface elevation measurements and 47 with

flow-velocity data (at 1-30 cm above the bed, obtained with the ECMs). One of the

ADVs, positioned near the bottom (at about 6 mm above the bed), was used to extend

the ECMs velocity measurements (which ended at x = 79.48 m) further into the inner-

surf/swash zone for depths shallower than 5 cm, adding 10 more cross-shore positions

of velocity measurements (starting at x = 78.73 m), of which at least three were, in

average, located in the swash zone (see zoomed region in Fig. 3.2). A more detailed

description of the experimental procedure and all the measurement instruments used

can be found in Ruessink et al. (2013).

3.2.2 Preliminary data analysis

Time series and spectra

The free-surface elevation and flow-velocity time series, of high-resolution in time

and in space, allow a clear description and analysis of the wave propagation across

the shoaling, surf and swash zones, for both short and IG waves. Figs. 3.3 and 3.4

show an example of the free-surface elevation and cross-shore velocity time series

obtained at different positions along the beach profile, for A2 irregular-wave case and

B2 bichromatic-wave case, respectively. IG waves are separated from short waves by

filtering the full signal at the cut-off frequency (fc). This frequency is defined, for the

A series, by a minimum of the variance density spectrum of the free-surface elevation

measured at the wave gauge closest to the wave-maker (de Bakker et al., 2014). For

the B series, this minimum is less marked, and thus half the peak frequency is used as

fc (Janssen et al., 2003). Both ways of computing the fc lead to very similar values.

For all conditions, the cut-off frequency separates the range of frequencies that initially

have more energy and will tend to loose energy as the waves propagate towards the

shore, from the range of frequencies that have initially less energy and will gain energy

closer to the shore (example in Fig. 3.5).

Observing the short waves propagating towards the shore, it is clear their progressive

shape change through skewed and asymmetric, finally capturing each other within the

same wave group to propagate higher up the beach as bores, associated with the IG-wave

motion. This pattern of convergence of multiple waves that can be seen along the time

series, reducing the number of short waves as the depth decreases, has been previously

described by Se?ne?chal et al. (2001) and van Dongeren et al. (2007). The velocity plots

reflect the same evolution, with velocity changing from simple orbital motion to swash

events with marked uprush and downwash phases. The presence of wave groups and

the clear signature of the IG waves are also evident in the free-surface and the velocity

time series, for both irregular and bichromatic waves, progressively more marked as the

waves approach the shore.

Fig. 3.5 presents the velocity spectra for conditions A2 and B2, at five distinct cross-

shore positions. For a beach as dissipative as the one considered in these experiments

(1/80 slope), strong infragravity motion is expected to significantly contribute to the

energy spectra along the profile, in particular in the swash zone (de Bakker et al.,

2015b). The spectra show that, for the two shoaling positions (x = 31.457 m and x =

56.176 m), energy is concentrated mostly in the high-frequency range, with a clear peak

at the peak frequency of the incident waves, for A2, and at the two main frequencies

(f1 and f2), for B2. In the low-frequency end of the B2 spectrum, at all cross-shore

positions, there is an energy peak at f2 -f1 (0.042 Hz), corresponding to the bound IG

wave that is associated to the groups of bichromatic waves.

For A2, the spectrum of the first position after the breakpoint (at x = 69.859 m)

shows a strong decay of the incident-frequency component linked to a significant energy

transfer to higher frequencies, with a distinct peak around 0.88 Hz (the first harmonic of

the peak frequency), following a trend of f?3 associated with wave saturation. As waves

propagate closer to the shore in the inner-surf/swash zone, the velocity energy levels at

frequencies greater than 0.1 decrease approximately as f?5/3, which is consistent with

an inertial sub-range, and energy is transferred to sub-harmonics, with energy levels

peaking at infragravity frequencies. For the position further inshore, the low frequencies

in the range of 0.04-0.08 Hz also start decaying following f?3, reflecting the possible

saturation and breaking of infragravity waves. For B2, a similar behaviour is observed

of energy transfer from the main frequencies to higher frequencies in the shoaling, and

to lower frequencies closer to the beach. However, for B2 the energy is preferentially

transferred to discrete frequencies, corresponding to multiples of the main frequencies

and of their difference (f2 -f1) or sum (f1+f2), instead of spreading over a wide range

of superharmonics and subharmonics.

Overall, both the time series and the spectra depict the importance of IG waves

in the GLOBEX gently-sloping beach, particularly in the swash zone. Therefore,

understanding infragravity waves implies the analysis and treatment of data collected

in the swash zone, an intermittently immersed zone, which is still a challenging issue,

especially for flow-velocity measurements.

32



Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities Section 3.2

Analysis of swash velocities

During the experiments, depending on the wave condition, free-surface elevation and

cross-shore velocity measurements were performed in three to five cross-shore positions

within the swash zone, spanning from the lower to the upper swash: x = 83.62 m, x

= 84.29 m, x = 84.56 m, x = 85.39 m and x = 86.51 m from the wave-maker. The

fact that the swash zone is, by definition, a zone which is intermittently covered by

water, means that any instrumentation positioned in this zone will be submerged during

discrete periods of time. During this periods, the wave gauges will simply register zero

values in the time series. Velocity measurements, however, will not be zero and, instead,

the parts of the signal corresponding to emersion periods will be noisy and present

unrealistic values. It is thus necessary to follow a rigorous procedure in order to define

which values are to be considered and which to be excluded from the velocity analysis.

The first step of swash data analysis consisted in synchronizing the cross-shore

velocity time series with the free-surface elevation time series measured at the closest

wave gauge. The velocity time series were then de-spiked (Mori et al., 2007), as a

preliminary way of eliminating spurious data points. Voulgaris &amp;amp; Trowbridge (1998)

have shown that accurate ADV measurements can be difficult to obtain within a 1-

cm distance of walls. Hence, the purpose of the following method is to evaluate the

reliability of measurements performed very close to the bed, in the swash zone.

The first criterion for controlling the output of the ADVs was based on the free-

surface elevation relatively to the ADV control-volume height (of 11.8 mm). However,

as the wave gauges were not always at the exact cross-shore position of the ADV and

also due to the occasional existence of resonant cross-modes in the transverse direction

of the flume (van der A et al., 2013), the wave fronts depicted in the free-surface

elevation measurements were not always exactly in phase with the sudden onshore-

velocity increase associated with the start of the uprush. Therefore, a beam correlation

(Corr) and a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) criterion was applied to extend the valid

velocity points at the front (backwards in time for each swash event) that would be

erroneously excluded if only the water-depth limit was considered. The chosen cut-off

values were a minimum Corr of 70% (Puleo et al., 2012) and a minimum SNR of 20

(Aagaard &amp;amp; Hughes, 2006).

The Corr and SNR criterion was not considered appropriate for extending the

valid points in the end of the backwashes, as both varied significantly between values

above and below the defined cut-off thresholds during this part of the swash events.

Even though, the water-depth limit was still allowing part of the backwash velocities to

be excluded, thus biasing parameters such as the velocity skewness and asymmetry and

the mean discharge. Hence, another criterion was applied to extend the number of valid

33



Section 3.2 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities

measured points at the end of each swash event. The velocity values that had been

excluded by the water-depth criterion, but for which the water depth was still greater

than 1 mm, were replaced by a mean value obtained from the mean of the last 25 valid

points (corresponding to a mean of the last 0.19 s of measurement), and added to the

end of each backwash, following the procedure of Raubenheimer et al. (2004). Fig. 3.6

shows an example of the application of the method described to a swash time series of

A2 wave condition. The mean discharge per run was used to check the validity of the

velocity selection method (if the velocity time series is accurate, the mean discharge in

the swash zone of an impermeable-bed beach must be the closest possible to zero).

Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities Section 3.2

Normalization of wave energy

In order to describe the wave propagation along the beach profile, measures of the

wave height, Hrms, and of the cross-shore velocity, urms, can be defined and calculated

Hrms =
Hs?

2
, (3.1)

where Hs ? 4
?
m0, m0 =

?
(??), ? is the standard deviation and

urms = ?u =
?
?u2?, (3.2)

where ?.? is the time-averaging operator and u the cross-shore velocity time series. Fig.
3.7 shows an example of the Hrms and urms trends that can be obtained along the beach

for A2 and B2, both for the total signal and for IG-frequencies only.

Since the wave height and period are distinct for each wave condition simulated, the

waves do not shoal and break at the same cross-shore position for all the irregular and

bichromatic wave conditions. Therefore, it is convenient to normalize the data, in order

to better compare the results of the different wave conditions. The evolutions of wave

height, velocity or nonlinearities along the beach profile have consistent cross-shore

structures that depend on the position relatively to the breakpoint, which separates

zones of the beach profile with different hydrodynamics. Thus, the breakpoint position

is a natural scaling factor for most wave parameters. Wave breaking is also dependent

on the energy of each wave condition, and thus scaling the cross-shore position relatively

to the breakpoint location is a way of normalizing the wave conditions in terms of

energy.

The breakpoint position is considered herein as the mean breaking location around

which most waves break. For bichromatic wave conditions, since the waves generated

have always the same characteristics, the waves break at a few constant cross-shore

Section 3.2 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities

positions along the run and the breakpoint position can thus be determined more

easily from the maximum wave height measured along the profile (or maximum Hrms).

However, irregular waves do not always break at the same cross-shore position, depending

on the height and period of each individual wave. Larger waves break further offshore

than smaller waves and wave breaking occurs over a large region of the domain. This

is further enhanced by the very gentle slope of the beach considered. Therefore, the

definition of the breakpoint position based on the maximum wave height is less accurate

for A conditions and the energy-dissipation rate is used instead, as it is explained below.

First, the energy-dissipation rate is calculated. The energy balance equation can be

written as
? (Ecg)

?x
= ???? = ? [??b? + ??f?] , (3.3)

with E the energy density, cg the group velocity (= cp, the phase velocity, in shallow

water), ?x the cross-shore distance along which the energy dissipates, ??b? the dissipation
by breaking per unit area and ??f? the frictional dissipation, which is considered
negligible when compared with the dominant dissipation by wave breaking. Considering

that the waves in the end of shoaling/beginning of breaking are essentially frequency

non-dispersive and have a group velocity close to the shallow-water phase velocity,

the energy density and group velocity can be calculated following the linear-wave-

theory relationships (Thornton &amp;amp; Guza, 1983). Hence, E = 1

dissipation rate

?x
. (3.4)

Afterwards, the dissipation rate and the maximum wave height (Hrms,max) were

computed for the three bichromatic-waves cases, in order to find a correspondence

between both that can be used to define the breakpoint position for the irregular-wave

cases. Fig. 3.8 represents the dissipation rates for A and B series. The greatest peak

corresponds to the breaking-induced dissipation and, thus, the start of the increase of

the dissipation rate towards the maximum value of this peak is linked to the beginning

of the breaking process. For B conditions, the cross-shore position of the marked

decrease of the Hrms trends corresponds to the breakpoint position (xb). In terms of

energy dissipation, this position corresponds (for GLOBEX data set) to two thirds

of the distance between the beginning of breaking and the maximum of dissipation.

This energy dissipation criterion is then used to define the breakpoint position for A

conditions, for which it represents the start of breaking of the greatest waves (which

break sooner than the smaller waves).

Having defined the breakpoint position for each wave condition, the cross-shore

distance can be normalized by the distance between the shoreline and the breakpoint.

each wave condition. Note: for B conditions, B1 (blue) and B2 (green) breakpoint positions are the
same and thus the blue line is not visible.

This can be expressed by the relative depth, hr which consists of the ratio between

the local water depth, measured in still water, at each cross-shore position (h) and the

breakpoint depth (hb). Both water depths are considered at rest. hr = 1 corresponds

to the breakpoint position (separating the shoaling and the surf zones), while hr = 0

corresponds to the shoreline position. hr = 0.5 marks the separation between the outer-

and the inner-surf zone.

3.2.3 Cross-shore variation of free-surface elevation and velo-

city

Fig. 3.9 depicts the evolution of Hrms and urms as a function of the relative water

depth and highlights the differences between wave conditions. B conditions have greater

short-wave height than A conditions, with A2 (the A condition with greater short-wave

height) approaching the height of B3 (the B condition with smaller short-wave height).

The IG waves have marked wave-height maxima and minima for the B conditions,

indicating that part of the energy is reflected at the shoreline. For A conditions,

the IG-wave height increases in the shoaling zone until breaking starts and remains

approximately constant throughout the surf zone. A2, the wave condition of series

A with the greatest Hrms, has also the greatest Hrms,IG. For all conditions, IG-wave

height decreases abruptly near the shoreline, mimicking short-wave breaking. Since

higher waves induce larger radiation stresses, set-up and set-down are greater for B

series, than A series, and for the wave conditions with higher total Hrms. IG waves

are generally greater for A conditions, with an exception of B3, the B condition with

more modulation, which reaches at its maxima a greater height. Larger overall velocity

is reached near the breakpoint, but IG-wave velocities are more important near the

shoreline, in the swash zone. The velocity decrease in the surf zone follows the Hrms

decrease after breaking, for both A and B conditions. Mean velocity is mostly negative

for all conditions, reaching higher values at the end of breaking.

Fig. 3.10 shows the results of normalizing wave height and velocity for all wave

conditions, which may reveal some other characteristics of the wave conditions that may

be hidden by the disparity in the initial wave height between conditions. For wave height

(velocity) and mean water level (mean velocity), the normalization is done by the the

Hrms (urms) value measured at twice the breakpoint depth (hr = 2). It highlights the

differences in the dissipation of irregular and bichromatic waves. The A conditions show

a progressive decrease of Hrms that corresponds to the breaking of irregular waves along

a wide surf zone. The B conditions present a more marked Hrms decrease, with strong

energy dissipation, which is linked to the breaking of the waves along a narrow breaking

zone. The greater modulation of B3 justifies its slightly gentler decrease of Hrms: it has

a greater variability of short-wave heights and thus a slightly larger dissipation zone

than B1 and B2. These wave conditions have very little modulation and thus their short

waves have very similar heights along the groups, which implies that they break almost

all at the same cross-shore position. Further onshore, a smaller local maximum of Hrms

is visible for all B conditions and is associated with the reformation of short waves near

hr = 0.5. Near the shoreline, there is again a slight increase of the wave height (further

offshore for A than B conditions). It is associated with the great increase of velocity

just in the beginning of the swash zone and it represents the change from surf-zone

rollers into swash-zone bores, with the water piling up slightly, as several consecutive

waves catch each other to form the bores that will break afterwards.

Wave groupiness

In order to better understand how the short-wave groups behave and their link

with the IG waves, the variation of the wave groupiness along the beach profile is

subsequently analysed. The groupiness factor (GF) can be defined, according to List

39



Section 3.2 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities

(1991), as

GF =

?
2?A
?A(t)?, (3.5)

where A is the amplitude of the short-wave envelope, ?.? represent the time-averaging
operator and t the time. GF can be considered as a measure of the variability of short-

wave height and has thus, inherently, a link between short and IG waves: greater IG

waves induce a greater modulation of the short-wave groups and thus a larger variability

of short-wave height and vice-versa. Fig. 3.11 (top) shows the GF calculated for both

A and B conditions, which is greater for A conditions: irregular-wave conditions have

naturally a larger variability of short-wave heights than bichromatic-wave conditions.

As found by List (1991), it is clear that, in contrast to the near-constant values

of GF in deep water, wave breaking rapidly alters the groupiness of the wave-groups.

For irregular waves, there is a large decrease in groupiness for depths shallower than

twice the breakpoint depth until the approximate limit between the outer and the

inner-surf zones (hr = 0.5). Here, all the short waves have finished breaking and have

similar heights, thus contributing to a minimum of wave-height variability (and thus of

groupiness). GF is higher before breaking, for A conditions, but for B conditions it

reaches very similar (B3) and even greater (B1 and B2) values in the surf zone.

A3 has slightly greater groupiness than A1 and A2 until the mid-surf zone. List

(1991) found in his data that groupiness seems to be independent of bandwidth. Here,

A3 has slightly greater values of GF than the other A conditions, which can either

be due to its more narrow-banded spectrum or lower wave steepness. B3 (greater

modulation) has, from deep water, a GF more than twice higher than the other B

conditions. It also has larger oscillations of the GF values in the surf zone.

List (1991) has suggested a possible model for justifying the existence of significant

groupiness within a saturated surf zone, which relates the short-wave interactions with

IG-wave induced depth. This concept was also demonstrated earlier on by observations

of a positive correlation between local IG oscillations and wave groups in the inner-surf

zone (Guza &amp;amp; Thornton, 1985; Abdelrahman &amp;amp; Thornton, 1987). In order to further

explore this concept, Fig. 3.11 (bottom) depicts the evolution of the cross-covariance

between the amplitude of the short-wave envelope (A) and the IG-wave motion (?IG)

along the beach profile.

During most of the shoaling zone, the correlation between the wave envelope and

IG-wave motion is near constant and negative, for A conditions, since the bound IG

waves are in anti-phase with the short-wave groups. However, for B2 and B3 conditions,

the presence of a local IG-wave node (offshore of hr = 2) results in a local de-correlation

of IG-wave motion with the wave envelope. When the IG-wave height does not approach

zero, the correlation remains high and negative until close to the breakpoint. The change

from decreasing to increasing GF values just after the breakpoint, for B conditions,

and in the mid-surf zone, for A conditions, is associated to the change of the correlation

between A and ?IG from negative to positive values (near-zero values). For B conditions,

the change to positive values of correlation is done in a shorter distance than for A

conditions. As it was observed before, dissipation is greater and happens over a shorter

distance for B conditions, which justifies the faster change of correlation. The positive

correlation in the surf zone highlights the in-phasing of IG-waves and short-wave groups,

previously observed by Guza &amp;amp; Thornton (1985); Abdelrahman &amp;amp; Thornton (1987) and

justifies the GF increase in this zone: due to the IG-wave induced depth, the highest

short waves can propagate at the crests of the IG waves and the smallest short waves at

the troughs, and thus short-wave height variability is promoted. For A conditions, the

correlation remains positive and groupiness increases towards the end of the inner-surf

41



Section 3.2 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities

zone. For B conditions, a return to negative values of correlation between the IG-wave

motion and the wave groups is observed near hr = 0.5, which is consistent with the

wave reformation already mentioned. In the inner-surf zone, correlation between the

wave groups and IG waves becomes positive again, as once more short-wave propagation

is depth-modulated by the IG waves.

3.2.4 Infragravity waves

Separation of incident and reflected IG waves

The standing IG-wave patterns observed for the bichromatic conditions result from the

interference between incident (ingoing) and reflected (outgoing) IG waves. Separating

both components helps understanding the contribution of each to the total IG-wave

height.

The incident/reflected IG-waves separation methods generally consider the IG waves

as free waves. Close to the shore, in very-shallow water, IG waves are essentially free,

but in less-shallow water most IG waves are bound. Therefore, it is convenient to

first separate bound from free IG waves, and then the incident free from reflected free

components.

Ruju et al. (2012) described in detail how the free-surface level of the incident bound

wave generated by the difference interactions between two short-wave components can

be calculated using the formulation of Longuet-Higgins &amp;amp; Stewart (1962). The bound

wave component can then be subtracted from the total IG-wave signal, to retrieve the

free IG waves. The free IG waves can subsequently be separated into incident and

reflected components using different methods.

Guza et al. (1984) developed a method for separating the IG-wave components from

co-located free-surface elevation and velocity measurements, for which

?IG

, (3.6)

where ?IG is the infragravity free-surface elevation, u is the infragravity cross-shore

velocity, h is the water depth and g is the gravitational acceleration. The incident

and reflected components of the IG waves are separated based on their propagation

direction, which is inferred from the velocity signal, by comparison with the propagation

velocity that would be expect considering linear theory. This method assumes that the

waves are shore normal and other sources of infragravity energy, such as edge waves,

are negligible, which is the case in the experimental flume. Also, it does not account

for the nonlinearity of bound waves and the influence of depth changes. van Dongeren

42



Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities Section 3.2

(1997) modified 3.6 to account for the fact that the incoming waves are predominantly

forced and thus propagate at the group celerity. ?IG
± is then defined as

?IG
± =

c(?IG + ?) ± (h + ?)u
cg + c

, (3.7)

with the free IG-wave celerity c = sqrt(g(h + ?IG)), ? the steady set-up and cg the

group velocity set equal to the linear group celerity of the primary waves at the peak

frequency (Ruju et al., 2012).

The Guza et al. (1984) method is the most widely used for separating incident and

reflected IG waves: it is simple and gives good results (Sheremet et al., 2002; Ruju et al.,

2012; Guedes et al., 2013; de Bakker et al., 2014). However, the need for co-located

measurements of free-surface elevation and velocity hinders its application when velocity

measurements are not available. This situation is very common, particularly when

measurements are made over a mobile bed (with sediments, in experimental wave

flumes and or the field) which complicates the obtainment of good and clean velocity

data. Since for the GLOBEX experiments high-resolution, in time and space, velocity

measurements are available from x=24.87 m until the the shoreline, the Guza et al.

(1984) method can be used to separate the IG-wave components for the analysis of the

IG-wave propagation along most of the profile.

Independently of the method chosen, the first step for separating the different

components of the IG waves is to separate the bound waves from the free waves. In

theory, the bound-wave solution can only be assumed to work for horizontal beds, since

in sloping beds the analytical solution is not known. Nevertheless, if a very-mild slope is

considered, it can be assumed that, at the beginning of the slope, the wave shoaling will

not be significant, and thus the bound-wave solution can be extended a little further in

the cross-shore profile.

Fig. 3.12 shows the separation of B3 IG waves into their different components,

following different approaches: (i) the bound wave is subtracted from the total IG-wave

signal before separating incident and reflected components (G1) or (ii) the total IG-wave

signal is separated into incident and reflected components, considering all IG waves as

free waves (G2 and G3).

Even though the initial Guza et al. (1984) method (before correction by van

Dongeren (1997)) considers all IG waves propagating as free waves, depending on the

position along the cross-shore profile, assuming all waves as free may or may not be

reasonable. Until close to the breakpoint, bound waves are predominant (left plot in

Fig. 3.12). Further onshore, after breaking, IG waves tend to be free, as breaking helps

releasing IG waves from the short-wave groups. Moreover, the Hrms of the bound waves

cannot be correctly estimated from the bound-wave theoretical solution further onshore

than the inner-shoaling zone. The correction of van Dongeren (1997) to the Guza et al.

(1984) method (G3) accounts for the fact that the group velocity, at which the bound

waves propagate, is smaller than the phase velocity, particularly in the shoaling zone

(see Fig. 3.13). This correction considers that the incident waves are predominantly

forced and thus modifies slightly the calculation of the incident and reflected IG waves,

seeking a compromise between G1 and G2 options. G3 is subsequently used to compute

IG-wave separation for all the wave conditions, as it is depicted in Fig. 3.14, for A3

and B3. In the surf zone, for B conditions, some scatter is present resulting from the

dispersion of the velocity measurements due to the transverse oscillation modes of the

flume already mentioned before (van der A et al., 2013).

In the next section, model simulations run for GLOBEX wave conditions are presented.

The time series of the free-surface elevation at the first wave gauge was used as input

wave condition to compared with the theoretical solution, and thus it was necessary to

subtract the reflected IG waves from the total IG-wave signal, since these are not present

when the waves are generated by the wave-maker. However, no velocity measurements

are available at the first wave gauge (x = 6.96 m) and thus Guza et al. (1984) method

for separating the incident and reflected IG waves cannot be used.

Several authors (e.g. Frigaard &amp;amp; Brorsen, 1995; Baldock &amp;amp; Simmonds, 1999; Battjes

et al., 2004) have used an array method in which the incident and reflected IG waves at

a certain location are estimated using only free-surface elevation measurements at a

number of adjacent wave gauges. The amplitude and phase variation of each frequency

harmonic between a reference gauge and another gauge is calculated assuming linear

propagation and conservation of energy. The phase differences calculated allow the

separation of the incident and reflected components. The velocity of propagation is

considered as
?
gh for both incident and reflected (free) IG waves. According to Battjes

et al. (2004), the low-frequency amplitudes calculated inside the surf zone are not

expected to be reliable as: (i) the approximation of the radiation-stress gradient by

neglecting the contribution from the amplitude variation compared to that from the

phase variation cannot be expected to hold in regions of short-wave breaking (and

this also implies that the breakpoint generation mechanism is not modeled); (ii) the

energy balance computed for the forced low-amplitude progressive IG waves assumes a

steady-state and absence of dissipation, assumption that is a priori invalidated by the

enhanced low-frequency energy dissipation in the surf and swash zones; and (iii) the

use of small-amplitude theory for the translation of short-wave energy into radiation

stress may not be accurate in the surf zone. Furthermore, there are conflicting demands

on the array length and the number and spacing of the wave gauges considered affect

the results. A minimal array length is required to obtain stable estimates and the

assumptions of the method introduce larger errors in the separation results for longer

arrays. Several authors that have previously used this method do not describe clearly

either how many gauges were used (van Dongeren et al., 2007), or why the choice of a

defined number of gauges (Dong et al., 2009). Even Battjes et al. (2004) do not provide

a thorough analysis of the sensibility of the method to wave-gauge number and spacing.

For defining the array length to be used, the results obtained with the methods

45



Section 3.2 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities

of Guza et al. (1984), van Dongeren (1997) and Battjes et al. (2004) were compared.

For A conditions, an array length of about 4.5 m, with four gauges provided the best

results. The separation between each two consecutive gauges was taken as 1.5 m, which

allows the reduction of noise in the results (stable estimates). For B conditions, as they

are repeatable and the low-frequency energy is concentrated essentially at the f2 ?f1
frequency, a smaller array length is sufficient for well resolving the separation of incident

and reflected waves and an array of three gauges with a length of 3 m resulted in the

best estimation. Since with Battjes et al. (2004) method the separation is carried out

in the frequency domain, the Hm0 is computed from the spectra instead of the Hrms

computed from the time series, and is presented in Fig. 3.14, for one irregular wave

condition and one bichromatic. Both methods are expected to present difficulties in the

separation of incident and reflected waves in cross-shore positions coincident with nodes

(anti-nodes) of the IG waves, as this implies the existence of positions with near-zero

free-surface elevation (velocity) values. The similitude of the solutions validates the

Battjes et al. (2004) formulation for separating IG-wave components offshore of the

first velocity measurement available.

Fig. 3.14 illustrates well the differences between A and B conditions in terms of

incident and reflected IG-wave components. For A conditions, the incident IG-wave

height increases progressively, until the edge of the outer-surf zone, following the total

IG-wave signal. This IG-wave height increase is promoted by nonlinear energy transfers

from the short waves (de Bakker et al., 2015a). The substantial difference in incident and

reflected IG-wave height near the shoreline is indicative of strong IG-energy dissipation

in very shallow water (de Bakker et al., 2014). The remaining reflected IG waves

decrease as they propagate offshorewards.

For B conditions, there is an abrupt decrease of incident IG-wave height in the

outer-surf zone, followed by an increase in the inner-surf zone. The minimum of incident

IG-wave height at around hr = 0.5 is coincident with the short-wave reformation

observed at this location (see Fig. 3.9). As it was observed for A conditions, B

conditions also show a substantial difference between incident and reflected components

near the shoreline, but reflected waves do not significantly decrease while propagating

offshorewards. Depending on the cross-shore position, the total IG-wave height, for B

conditions, has the contribution of both incident and reflected components.

Comparison with the monochromatic IG-wave case

To comprehend how IG-wave motion can correlate and influence short waves, it

is important to understand the propagation of the IG waves themselves. In order to

do so, the C1 monochromatic IG-wave condition was especially designed to allow the

46



Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities Section 3.2

visualization and analysis of the propagation of free monochromatic IG waves. Fig.

3.15 shows the comparison of the Hrms and urms and also Hrms,IGinc and Hrms,IGref of

the C1 condition with the IG waves of the B2 and B3 conditions (designed to have

the same IG wave period as C1). Since the C1 condition does not have a short-wave

breakpoint like other conditions, the x axis is not normalized by hb.

The partially-standing wave patterns observed for the B2 and B3 IG waves are

also present for C1 condition. It is notable, however, that whereas C1 wave height

progressively increases along the cross-shore profile, reaching a maximum rather close

to the shore, B2 and B3 IG waves reach their wave-height maxima sooner in the profile,

just after the onset of short-wave breaking.

Separating the incident and reflected IG-wave components helps better understanding

the differences between the IG waves associated with the bichromatic waves and the

free IG waves of C1. The incident IG waves have a very distinct evolution between

the B and the C cases until close to the shoreline. For B conditions, in the shoaling

zone, incident IG-wave height markedly increases due to the strong nonlinear coupling

with the short waves (and thus, due to the energy transfer to the IG waves) (Sheremet

et al., 2002), reaching a maximum height near the shoreward limit of the the outer

surf-zone, where the mean radiation stress assumes maximal values (Ruju et al., 2012).

As the short waves start breaking, IG-wave energy dissipation starts, which is seen as a

decrease of the incident IG-wave height in the outer-surf zone, until the mid-surf zone.

As Baldock (2012) proposed, this might be due to the onset of short-wave breaking: as

the highest short-waves of the groups break, the short-wave-height variability within the

Section 3.2 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities

wave groups is reduced, which implies a smaller difference in momentum flux between

the higher and the smaller waves and thus a decrease of the amplitude of the bound IG

waves. In the same zone of the beach profile, there is a small reformation of short-waves,

which then decrease again towards the shore. In the inner-surf zone, self-self IG-wave

interactions develop, dominating the interactions close to the shore (de Bakker et al.,

2014). This IG interactions induce higher harmonics that lead to shoaling of the IG

waves (which is seen by an increase of the incident IG waves in the inner-surf zone,

particularly notorious for B3) and promote a shape transformation of the IG waves to

asymmetric (Rocha et al., 2013a). The IG waves thus end up by breaking, which is

potentially the dominant mechanism of IG-wave dissipation in this zone of the beach

profile (van Dongeren et al., 2007; de Bakker et al., 2014). B3 has greater IG-waves,

therefore IG-wave self-self interactions can be expected to be more significant, justifying

the larger growth of the incident IG waves in the inner-surf zone comparatively to B2.

For both B2 and B3, incident IG waves have a sudden height decrease near the coast (at

x ? 80 m), which is accompanied by a significant cross-shore velocity increase. These
are trends typically observed for the short-wave height at the end of the shoaling zone,

before breaking (Fig. 3.9), which reinforces the idea of IG-wave breaking.

Unlike for B conditions, C1 incident waves grow regularly along the beach, only

decreasing near the coast, in the same region where B2 and B3 incident IG waves were

shown to break. The wave-height increase for C1 is only linked to the progressive

shoaling of the free IG waves. Without a coupling to short-waves, no local increases or

decreases of wave height are expected for this wave condition, since no energy transfers

from (in the shoaling) or to (in the surf zone) short waves are possible. Nevertheless, C1

incident wave height still decreases abruptly near the shoreline, which is concomitant

with a IG-wave velocity increase, like it was observed for B2 and B3 conditions, once

again supporting the theory of IG-wave breaking initially proposed by van Dongeren

et al. (2007).

The reflected IG-wave component of C1 gradually decreases with increasing distance

from the shoreline, consistent with both dissipation and refractive trapping (Sheremet

et al., 2002). For B conditions, the same behaviour is clear only in deeper waters,

beyond the breakpoint. Near the breakpoint there is even a slight increase (especially

for B3), which can probably be attributed to the contribution of IG waves generated by

the time-varying breakpoint mechanism (Baldock et al., 2000).

Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities Section 3.2

3.2.5 Analysis of wave nonlinearities

Evolution of skewness and asymmetry

Analysing the evolution of wave nonlinearities along the beach profile is a way to track

the changing of the wave shape during wave propagation. Skewness and asymmetry

are essentially a result of the generation of harmonics of the fundamental frequency

(or frequencies, for B series), in- or out-of-phase with it, respectively. Therefore, the

evolution of skewness and asymmetry values along the beach profile are a proxy of the

interactions between frequency pairs.

Skewness and asymmetry of the free-surface elevation can be computed from the

wave-gauges measurements as

Sk? =
?(? ? ??)3?

?3?
, (3.8)

where ?.? is the time-averaging operator and ?? the free-surface elevation standard
deviation. The asymmetry is calculated according to Kennedy et al. (2000),

As? =
?H (? ? ??)3?

?3?
, (3.9)

where H is the imaginary part of the Hilbert transform. Velocity skewness and

asymmetry are analogously calculated (Eqs. 2.4 and 2.5), replacing the free-surface

elevation time series by the cross-shore velocity time series.

Fig. 3.16 shows the evolution of Sk and As, for the free-surface elevation and

cross-shore velocity, for all irregular and bichromatic wave conditions.

For A conditions, the typical trends of nonlinearity can be observed, with the

absolute values of skewness and asymmetry increasing until the middle of the surf zone,

where most of the short waves finish breaking and decreasing then towards the inner-

surf zone. Near the coast, when the contribution of the IG-waves becomes significant,

nonlinearity increases again, responding to the shoaling of the IG waves themselves.

For B conditions, the global Sk and As trends observed for the A conditions are

perturbed by multiple local maxima and minima. The cross-shore position of the first

local maximum of Sk, corresponds to that of the first breaking of the bichromatic-wave

groups and is associated with a return of As values to close to zero, which marks the

end of the main breaking region for B conditions. The local maximum of Sk near hr

= 0.5 that is followed by a local maximum of asymmetry is probably linked to the

reformation of short-waves observed in Fig. 3.9. The Sk and As increase closest to

the shoreline follows the one observed for A conditions and is linked to the IG-wave

shoaling and breaking.

Besides the overall evolution of Sk and As, some aspects can be highlighted:

? B conditions reach, locally, greater Sk and As values than A conditions, although

surf-zone minima can be lower for B conditions;

? A3 has greater skewness than the other A conditions, approaching the greater

values of the B conditions;

? the multiple Sk and As peaks observed for B conditions have different amplitudes,

suggesting different forcing mechanisms;

? the first and third Sk and As peaks of B conditions are related to the first breaking

of the short waves and (potentially) to the reformation observed near hr = 0.5,

respectively;

? B3 reaches greater absolute As and Sk values than the other B conditions in the

inner-surf/lower-swash zones.

For A conditions, the same behaviour and differences between conditions observed

for Sk? and As? are also present for Sku and Asu, although with smaller absolute

values. For B conditions the general trends obtained for free-surface elevation are also

mimicked by the cross-shore velocity, but the peaks of Sk? and As? onshore of the

outer-surf zone are less evident and not always in phase with those of Sku and Asu.

The larger modulation of B3 promotes a higher correlation between short-wave action

and IG wave motion, which affects the evolution of skewness and asymmetry along

the beach profile. The conversion from free-surface elevation to velocity skewness and

asymmetry is explored in the following subsection.

Retrieving velocity nonlinearities from free-surface elevation nonlinearities

Fig. 3.17 shows the comparison between the Sk and As of free-surface elevation and

the Sk and As of velocity for one irregular-wave condition, A1, and one bichromatic-

wave condition, B1. Except for some particular peaks for the B conditions in the surf

zone, the velocity nonlinearity trends follow the free-surface elevation trends, but with

lower absolute values. Particularly for skewness, the difference is of the order of 40%,

for A conditions, and 30%, for B conditions. The lower values of Sku and Asu result

from the attenuation of the high frequencies (and thus of the superharmonics) of the

velocity signal throughout the water column, as predicted by the linear wave theory

for intermediate depth (Dean &amp;amp; Dalrymple, 1991). The similarity of the trends of

free-surface elevation nonlinearities and velocity nonlinearities (Fig. 3.17) suggests that

the nonlinearities of the velocity time series may potentially be retrieved (by means of

the linear wave theory) from the free-surface elevation time series, in particular for A

conditions.

Section 3.2 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities

Michallet et al. (2011) have considered the shallow-water wave theory, corrected

to the second-order, to estimate velocity from free-surface elevation measurements.

However, they show that, although the trends are well captured, the absolute values

of Sku and Asu are under- and over-predicted, respectively. The high frequencies,

which greatly contribute to Sku and Asu, are attenuated with depth. Therefore, an

expression aimed at retrieving correctly a velocity time series from free-surface elevation

measurements, must include a dependence on the position in the water column at which

the velocity is calculated. Hence, instead of considering the shallow-water wave theory,

the linear wave theory is considered at intermediate depths, for which a dependence on

water depth is included as follows

u? =
?
i

ui = ?i
cosh(kiz0)

sinh(kih)
, (3.10)

where the index i represents each of the frequencies that are transferred from the

free-surface elevation time series to the velocity time series, k is the wave number

(= 2?/?, with ? the wave length), z0 is the height above the bottom at which u? is

calculated, and h is the local water depth. k is obtained from the dispersion relation,

which can be expressed, for each frequency, as

?2i = gki tanh(kih), (3.11)

with g the gravitational acceleration and where ?i = 2?fi is the angular frequency

and fi each wave frequency considered. Fig. 3.18 shows the comparison of Sku and

Asu obtained from the velocity measurements (uE) and from free-surface elevation

measurements (u?), using Eq. 3.10, for A1, A3, B1 and B3.

For A conditions, the estimated values of Sku and Asu are very close to the measured

ones until the inner-surf zone, from whereon the linear wave theory fails to predict

correctly the velocity from the free-surface elevation measurements. Sku is predicted

with a very small error of less than 1%, for A1, and less than 5%, for A3, until its

maximum value. Beyond that position, u? overestimates Sku. For the Asu of A1 and

A3, the trend predicted by u? is almost totally accurate until near the maximum value.

In the case of B1, the Sku trend is still fairly well followed until the end of the outer-surf

zone, but for B3, u? does not predict correctly the oscillations of the measured Sku in

the shoaling zone. This is due to the fact that the presence of reflected IG waves is not

accounted for in u? and for B3 these waves are more important and thus the error in

the estimation of Sku and Asu is larger.

Overall, u? can be used to estimate Sku and Asu for irregular waves and for bichro-

matic wave groups with small modulation until the water becomes too shallow (beyond

Third-order velocity moment

For further exploring the velocity nonlinearities, the third-order velocity moment can

be calculated and used to analyse the contribution of different hydrodynamic processes

to the total skewness (Marin?o-Tapia et al., 2007; Rocha et al., 2013b).

The energetics approach (e.g. Bagnold, 1963; Bowen, 1980; Bailard, 1981) is one of

the most robust sediment transport formulations for surf-zone conditions. According

to this approach, the time-averaged bed-load and suspended-load sediment transports

are proportional to four velocity moments: the process-related moments
?
|u|2 u

?
and?

|u|3 u
?
, and the moments related to the gravity terms

?
|u|3
?

and
?
|u|5
?
. The cross

shore structure of each velocity moment can thus be used to investigate some of the

different processes influencing sediment transport. Guza &amp;amp; Thornton (1985) have shown

that the most important terms in the cross-shore transport equation are those included

in the third and fourth velocity moments,
?
|u|2 u

?
and

?
|u|3 u

?
, respectively. Russell

&amp;amp; Huntley (1999) presented a detailed analysis on the relative contributions of short

waves, IG-wave motions and mean flows and interactions between the three to the

53



Section 3.2 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities

total structure of the moments using the normalized third-order velocity moment. This

moment was chosen for having a clearer cross-shore structure, being statistically more

robust, and its expansion into individual terms being easily coupled with well-known

sediment transport mechanisms.

To study the relative importance of short and IG waves on nonlinearity effects, the

instantaneous near-bed cross-shore velocities can be split into a mean velocity term

(u) and an oscillatory term (u?). The latter can be further separated into high and low

frequency components, corresponding to the short (u?S) and infragravity (u?IG) orbital

motion,

u = u + u?S + u?IG. (3.12)

The third-order velocity moment can then be computed, resulting its decomposition

in ten terms which can be related to different hydrodynamic processes (Table 3.2).

Each term can then be normalized by the velocity variance (wave energy), following

Table 3.2: Terms resulting from the decomposition of the third-order velocity moment.

data collected under different energy conditions (Russell &amp;amp; Huntley, 1999). Fig. 3.19

presents the evolution along the cross-shore beach profile of the six most relevant terms

(the mean velocity has already been analysed and Sk7, Sk8 and Sk9 are approximately

zero).

A strong dependency of hydrodynamic processes on the distance to breakpoint

is evident, with markedly different behaviours offshore and onshore of the breakpoint

position. In the shoaling zone, the dominant term is the short-wave skewness (Sk1),

although there is also a contribution from the terms Sk2 (larger in the outer-shoaling

zone) and Sk5 (larger in the end of the shoaling zone). For A conditions, the greater

short-wave skewness of A3 is evident. For B conditions, two Sk1 local maxima are

visible, at the cross-shore positions of the first and third total Sk? peaks mentioned

before (and shown in Fig. 3.16) and attributed to the existence of the first breaking

and of a short-wave reformation zone in the mid-surf zone. In the case of B3 condition,

the second Sk1 peak is much smaller than for the other two B conditions. For B3,

with greater modulation (and thus greater IG waves), the relative contribution of the

short-wave skewness to the total skewness is smaller than for the other two conditions.

This highlights the fact that, depending on the modulation, the contributions of high

and low frequencies to the nonlinearities, at any given cross-shore position, can be

different. Still in the shoaling zone, the correlation between short-wave variance and

IG-wave velocity (Sk2) is negative: under non-breaking wave conditions the largest

short waves appear under the bound IG-wave trough (see Figs. 3.3 and 3.4). For B3,

this correlation is also negative but oscillates responding to the IG-waves maxima and

minima.

After the breakpoint and until the end of the surf zone, short-wave skewness (Sk1)

continues to be positive but diminishes, reaching zero values near the shoreline. The

term corresponding to the stirring by short waves and transport by mean flow (Sk5)

contributes to negative skewness, with the most negative value at about half the

breakpoint depth. This is a result of the negative mean cross-shore velocity in the

surf-zone, associated with the undertow (see Fig. 3.9). The correlation of short-wave

variance and IG-wave velocity (Sk2) gradually becomes zero towards the end of the

55



Section 3.2 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities

outer-surf zone and then becomes slightly positive for A conditions in the inner-surf zone,

where the short-wave propagation is controlled by the water depth at each moment. For

B conditions, the correlation between short-wave variance and IG-wave velocity varies

depending on the wave condition and responding to the cross-shore IG-wave height

patterns. In the case of B3, the positive correlation maximum observed in the surf zone

is located at the cross-shore position of the second total Sk peak depicted in Fig. 3.16.

From the inner-surf to the upper-swash zone, the IG waves start to clearly dominate

the hydrodynamics. IG-wave stirring and transport by mean flow becomes increasingly

more negative until close to the shoreline (Sk6). At the transition from surf to swash

(around hr = 0), with the formation of IG-wave bores that propagate towards the

upper-swash zone, the skewness of IG waves becomes positive (Sk4) and a weak onshore-

directed mean-flow effect is also present (Sk6). As short waves propagate associated

with the IG-wave bores, the correlation of short-wave variance and IG-wave velocity

(Sk2) reaches greater and positive values. A small contribution from IG-wave variance

correlation with short-wave velocity also plays a role in the swash zone (Sk3).

Summing up, in the shoaling zone, Sk1, Sk2 and Sk5 (the terms strongly dependent

on short waves) dominate, which is in accordance with the findings of Russell &amp;amp; Huntley

(1999) and Marin?o-Tapia et al. (2007), who also observed the terms Sk1 and Sk2 to be

positive and negative, respectively, offshore of the breakpoint. However, the positive

values perceived by these authors for the term Sk5 in the shoaling zone, are not found

herein, where a negative mean velocity has a stronger signature, leading to negative

values. This leads to a distinct behaviour of the overall velocity skewness when compared

with the shape function of Marin?o-Tapia et al. (2007). In the surf zone, the results

obtained are also in agreement with previous findings, with a predominance of negative

skewness. This is only strictly true when Sk1 becomes much smaller than Sk5 and Sk6,

which happens for depths shallower than half the breakpoint depth, for A conditions,

and still further onshore, for B conditions. Sk5 is dominant in the outer-surf zone and

Sk6 in the inner-surf zone. The swash zone is dominated by terms Sk2, Sk4 and Sk6,

linked to the IG-wave motion.

Fig. 3.19 further highlights the difference between short-wave skewness for condition

A3 and the other A conditions, as well as the significant discrepancy of the correlation

between short-wave variance and IG-wave motion, for condition B3, relatively to the

other B conditions. Moreover, it underpins the existing link between short waves and

IG waves. As Janssen et al. (2003) have shown, in the shoaling zone, the correlation

between IG and short waves is negative, as the IG waves are in anti-phase with the wave

groups. After the breakpoint, this correlation increases to positive values, which are

greater in the swash zone, where the water-depth modulation of short-wave propagation

56



Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities Section 3.2

implies a positive correlation between IG-wave crests and the highest short waves of

the groups (as shown before in Fig. 3.11).

3.2.6 Summary

Few measurements are currently available from experiments performed on beaches

as gentle-sloping as the GLOBEX beach. In this section, a detailed analysis of the wave

(and velocity) nonlinearities was carried out, as well as some reflexions on the behaviour

of the infragravity waves and their interaction with the short waves. The very-gentle

slope makes it possible for wave nonlinearities and infragravity waves to fully develop

as the short-wave propagate towards the shore. The comparison between irregular and

bichromatic waves has also highlighted some particularities of the bichromatic waves,

which merit to be more thoroughly looked at in the future. The main remarks of this

section are subsequently presented.

Irregular waves have a broader surf zone than bichromatic waves, for which breaking

is stronger and happens over a narrower surf zone. Therefore, bichromatic waves reach a

greater maximum energy-dissipation rate than irregular waves. The latter have smaller

undertow velocities, but greater urms and urms,IG.

The wave evolution is influenced by the relation between short-wave groups and

IG waves (which can also be seen in terms of wave groupiness). In the shoaling zone,

the tendency is for IG waves to be in anti-phase with the short-wave groups. In the

inner-surf/swash zones IG-waves are in phase with the short-wave groups, influencing

short-wave propagation by depth-modulation of the water level. For A conditions the

trends are linear, for B conditions the picture is more complex, due to the existence of

significant IG-wave reflection at the shore and of a short-wave reformation zone in the

mid-surf zone.

IG waves propagating together with short-wave groups (B conditions) evolve towards

the shore differently from free IG waves (C1). This is due to the interactions with the

short-wave groups, which are absent for C1 case. It seems likely, for both B and C1

cases, that part of the IG waves shoal and break near the shore.

Few data sets have such a high resolution of velocity measurements as the GLOBEX

data set. Frequently, the description along the beach profile of the velocity nonlinearities,

which are directly related to sediment transport, is hindered by a lack of velocity

measurements. Hence, making use of the high-resolution data set presented, a method to

calculate velocity nonlinearities from free-surface elevation measurements was proposed

and validated. This method is based in the linear wave theory at intermediate depths

and takes into account the attenuation of the high frequencies of the wave throughout

the water column.

57



Section 3.3 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities

The evolution of the wave nonlinearities varies depending on the wave condition

considered. Irregular waves and bichromatic waves have distinct behaviours along the

cross-shore profile. For irregular waves, higher total wave height results in greater

cross-shore velocities and IG waves. The largest values of skewness and asymmetry were

observed for A3, which has both a more narrow-banded spectrum and a smaller wave

steepness than the other A conditions. Modulation of the short-wave nonlinearities

by the IG waves is particularly evident for B conditions and more marked for B3, the

wave condition with the greatest IG waves. Depending on the cross-shore position

relative to the breakpoint, different mechanisms contribute to the wave nonlinearity.

Short-wave motion is more important in the shoaling zone, while the mean flow only

becomes relevant in the surf zone. The very-gentle slope of the beach promotes the

existence of a large surf zone for irregular waves, which can be divided into the outer-

and the inner-surf zones, with the maxima of skewness being reached between the

two. Asymmetry reaches its highest values closer to the shore. The contribution of the

interaction between short-waves and IG-wave motion to the nonlinearity varies along

the beach profile. The IG waves dominate the nonlinearities of the inner-surf and swash

zones for all wave conditions.

The next two sections of this chapter are dedicated to exploring further the factors

influencing the evolution of the nonlinearity of the waves.

3.3 Numerical modelling - SERR1D model

Field data can help identifying the drawbacks of different parameterizations. If

the number of instrument is high enough, these data can even be used to follow wave

propagation and transformation towards the coast. However, the scarce number of

instruments available in most field campaigns often hinders the complete description of

the wave evolution, particularly offshore of the surf zone. Furthermore, wave conditions

and the beach profile cannot be controlled and data is not always exploitable for

a specific purpose. To overcome these difficulties inherent to field work, laboratory

experiments can be made, where scaled physical models allow a greater control over the

variables aimed to be studied, while representing the most important hydrodynamic

and morphodynamic processes as close as possible to nature. Wave conditions can be

carefully controlled and the beach can be designed as wished. Notwithstanding, it is a

long and expensive process to get accurate and pertinent measurements, and a limited

amount of wave conditions can be run, frequently over one single beach profile (the

slope remains constant).

Therefore, even though numerical models often present not only numerical limitations

58



Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities Section 3.3

but also limitations related to the state-of-the-art of the knowledge of the processes

to be modelled, they are useful tools, as they allow the experimenting of many wave

conditions and beach types in less time (and less money!) than physical models or field

experiments.

3.3.1 Model description

SERR1D is a fully-nonlinear 4th-order finite-volume Boussinesq-type model (Cien-

fuegos et al., 2006, 2007). This model is based on the Serre equations, which describe

the 2D irrotational and shallow-water flow of an incompressible and inviscid fluid over

uneven bottom bathymetries. This set of equations defines the total water depth

and the depth-averaged horizontal velocity. The depth-averaged mass and momentum

conservation equations can be written in their generic form, according to

with Cf the bed-friction coefficient (similarly to that used by Grant &amp;amp; Madsen (1979));

x is the space coordinate, in the cross-shore direction and t is the time coordinate.

For Boussinesq models to represent well the surf zone, breaking criteria must be

adopted to turn on/off breaking dissipation. The breaking initiation/cessation criterion

is based on threshold values of the breaker front slope, ? (Schaffer, 1993). In SERR1D

model, the breaking terms are included in both the mass and momentum conservation

equations. The breaking term in the mass-conservation equation takes into account

the mass deficit induced by depth-integration up to the wave trough, as an attempt to

include wave-roller effects. The overall dissipation of organized wave energy is derived

using nonlinear shallow-water shock theory, which is corrected to account for dissipation

taking place only over a finite cross-wave extent. The breaking-induced terms are thus

described as

breaker index, in order to follow the definition of the authors of the model; elsewhere in

this manuscript, the ? symbol represents the spectral bandwidth parameter). ? and ?

constitute the two main physical parameters to be set.

The model has been previously validated with laboratory data for short-wave and

IG-wave propagation, energy transfers between both frequency bands and short-wave

breaking (Cienfuegos et al., 2006, 2007, 2011). In particular, the wave-breaking model

was calibrated by Cienfuegos et al. (2010) with the case of Ting &amp;amp; Kirby (1994) spilling-

breakers experiments.

Herein, a good compromise between the numerical performance of the scheme and

predicted properties of surf-zone waves is achieved by setting: (i) the relative breaking-

wave height to 0.8 at the beginning of breaking (?b) and 0.7 at the end (?f ), (ii) the

breaker angles (?b, for breaking initiation and ?f , for breaking cessation) to 26° and 6°,

(iii) ? = 0.1, (iv) ?b = 5.0, (v) the empirical parameter for the roller length, to 0.796,

(vi) the coefficient for the transitional time scale Tb = 5.0, (vii) the friction coefficient

Cf = 0.001 (calculated with the Grant &amp;amp; Madsen (1979) parameterization) and (viii)

the grid resolution parameter ? = dx/h0 = 0.05 (where dx is the spatial grid spacing,

and h0 the water depth at the wave-maker). The values used for the parameters are

within the range proposed by Cienfuegos et al. (2010). Since the friction coefficient

depends on the bed roughness, this parameter can be changed for data sets obtained

on different beaches, as long as it is kept within a reasonable range.

3.3.2 Sensitivity analysis

The sets of parameters chosen for A and B conditions, respectively, were used in all

model runs of this section and were chosen as a compromise that works fairly well for

both narrow- and broad-banded irregular-wave cases (A1 and A3) and more modulated

and less modulated bichromatic wave cases (B1 and B3). Since herein the main focus

in on the evolution of wave nonlinearity along the beach profile (accounting for both

short- and infragravity-wave propagation), Hrms and Sk? are considered as control

variables and calibration was done with a special emphasis on getting the best values

simultaneously for both.

The B parameter can be calculated according to Ruessink et al. (2012), as

B =
?
Sku

2 + Asu
2. (3.24)

Since it combines both velocity skewness (Sku) and asymmetry (Asu), this parameter

constitutes a measure of the total (non-dimensional) nonlinearity and is thus analysed

as well. The emphasis of this analysis is on its maximum value, Bmax, which represents

the maximum value of nonlinearity reached by each condition along the beach profile.

Time-series length

In the case of irregular waves, the time series that are input to the model as boundary

conditions need to be long enough to allow the statistical convergence of the results. At

the same time, longer input time series imply a longer computation time. Therefore, a

compromise must be reached between computation time and statistical convergence. In

61



Section 3.3 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities

order to do so, simulations with different time lengths were run and the sensitivity of

Hrms of both total and infragravity waves and Sk? to the length of the run was analysed.

Fig. 3.20 shows both variables zoomed at the profile zones where their values are more

affected by the run length. The greatest difference observed between the results of the

runs with different time lengths is of the order of 6%, for the Hrms of the IG waves, and

is reduced to less than 1% for the runs with a time length of at least 1500 s. Therefore,

we will consider that any run that has a length of more than 1500 s can be used for

computing wave statistics for A conditions accurately. Since for B conditions the waves

are bichromatic, shorter time series are needed to get statistical convergence: shorter

runs, of 500 s, still provide accurate results.

Boundary conditions

Two different types of input time series were tested: one obtained experimentally

and the other obtained theoretically. From the total free-surface elevation time series

measured at the first wave gauge (x = 6.96 m), the reflected IG waves were extracted

(using the Battjes et al. (2004) separation method already described, since no velocity

measurements were available at this position), and the input signal arriving from the

wave-maker was retrieved. This time series constituted the experimentally-obtained

input wave time series (A1E, for condition A1). The theoretical time series were

computed using the second-order wave-maker theory for irregular waves (Scha?ffer, 1996),

considering for A conditions both 1000 and 2000 different frequencies (e.g., A1T and

A1T2, for condition A1). For B conditions, only the main two frequencies (f1 and f2)

were considered for computing the bound wave and the higher harmonics (B1T, for

condition B1). Figs. 3.21 and 3.22 show the input time series and spectra of A1, A3,

B1, B3 wave conditions.

The evolution of different wave statistics along the beach profile, spectra and time

series calculate at different cross-shore positions are analysed for both types of input time

series. For A conditions, the two theoretical input time series, T (computed with 1000

frequencies) and T2 (computed with 2000 frequencies), are considered in the analysis.

profile, for A1 condition. Grey lines - experimental data; dark blue - A1E; blue - A1T; cyan - A1T2.
The blue crosses in Sku and Asu figures were calculated from the velocity time series obtained from

thus it is set up to represent more accurately A than B conditions. Using the same set

of wave-breaking parameters for all wave conditions simulated implies the existence of

some discrepancies between experimental and numerical results, particularly in what

concerns breaking initiation and inner-surf/swash zone nonlinearities.

For A conditions, free-surface elevation trends are well represented by the model, as

well as the wave phasing and nonlinearity until the swash zone (Figs. 3.23 and 3.25).

Small differences can be seen between the runs forced with theoretical (A1T and A1T2)

and experimental (A1E) input conditions, particularly for A1 in the inner-surf and

swash zones, a result of the higher IG-wave energy observed for the experimental-input

runs, relative to the experimental data (Fig. 3.24).

The three most obvious inaccuracies of the model on the simulation of A conditions

can be observed for As?, urms and Sku statistics (Figs. 3.23). The general shape and

maximum of As? are captured by the model, but in order to represent correctly the

Hrms decrease due to wave breaking and the Sk? evolution along the profile, the set

of breaking-model parameters chosen delays the beginning of the increase in wave

asymmetry. This increase, associated with the breaking process, is reproduced by the

Section 3.3 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities

at a certain height above the bed and compared to the model outputs that correspond

to a velocity integrated over the entire water column. Near the bottom, the velocity is

expected to be lower and less skewed than near the surface. Sku is hence overestimated

in about 16%, for A1, and 22%, for A3. In the shoaling zone, the model overestimates

the energy of the velocity frequencies higher than the peak frequency, but it is accurate

further onshore.

In order to overcome the limitation of the model in the simulation of the velocity,

the method described in section 3.2.5 for estimating the velocity from the computed

free-surface elevation (u?) can be used to retrieve urms, Sku and Asu, especially for

irregular-wave conditions (blue dots in Fig. 3.23).

Computing the theoretical solution with 1000 or 2000 frequencies (difference between

T and T2 input time series, Fig. 3.23 and Fig. A.1 of Appendix A), does not improve

significantly the statistics. Thus, since computing the theoretical solution with 2000

frequencies is more time consuming, new theoretical irregular-wave conditions defined in

this section were obtained using a theoretical solution that considers only interactions

between 1000 frequencies.

Keeping the same wave-breaking parameters that were calibrated for the irregular-

wave conditions for the bichromatic waves, makes it difficult for the model to accurately

simulate all the nuances of the evolution of the nonlinearities of the B conditions (see

Appendix A). A small change of ?b (from 26° to 27°) and ?f (from 6° to 9°) helps better

represent the existence of a second breaker region, but does not fully resolve the correct

representation of skewness and asymmetry trends. The model slightly underestimates

set-down and overestimates set-up. It tends to overestimate as well the mean energy

level of B conditions and small differences in the Hrms,IG at the first wave gauge (around

2% for B1) can increase along the beach and influence the simulation of IG-wave height

closer to the coast and the position of the Hrms,IG maxima and minima, for the B

wave conditions. When the amplitude modulation is greater (the case of B3), these

differences affect also the skewness evolution, in particular the skewness peaks that

correspond to short-wave modulation by IG waves. Nevertheless, the model represents

accurately the energy and frequency of the most important frequencies. This allows it

to still represent the general trends of free-surface elevation and velocity sufficiently well,

together with the first and second skewness peaks, which are correctly represented in

terms of amplitude (only the first one) and cross-shore location (both). The difficulties

presented by the model in the simulation of only some of the skewness peaks reinforce,

once again, the idea that the various skewness peaks do not have all the same origin.

66



Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities Section 3.3

Friction coefficient

Since the bottom friction is beach dependent, it is difficult to estimate a priori,

and an adjustment can be made for each beach modelled. Therefore, a sensitivity

analysis was performed for a range of resonable values (Grant &amp;amp; Madsen, 1979) for

the GLOBEX case. Fig. 3.26 shows the effect of changing Cf on Hrms and Sk?, for

both A1 and B1. Keeping the friction coefficient value at a minimum of 0.001 allows a

better representation of the onset of wave breaking and thus of the maximum skewness

values as well. The value of 0.001 was chosen as a compromise that allows the best

representation of the decrease of Hrms during wave breaking, the increase of Hrms,IG in

the inner surf/swash zones, and the shape and maximum value of Sk? evolution along

the profile, for A1. Since it depends mostly on the bottom roughness, which is the same

for all runs, the same value was considered for all A and B conditions.

Wave-breaking parameters (?b, ?f, ?b, ?f)

As wave nonlinearity and wave breaking are tightly linked, the breaking process

(initiation, duration and cessation) must be reproduced by the model as close to the

experimental data as possible. The sensitivity of the model to the choice of the breaking

parameters is therefore very important and is subsequently analysed. All the sensitivity

analysis is presented for A3. A particular attention is paid to the threshold values

(corresponding to breaking initiation and cessation) of the two main physical parameters

67



Section 3.3 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities

that can be set in the breaking model, ? and ?. Hrms and urms of both all frequencies

and IG-waves only, mean water level, mean cross-shore velocity and skewness and

asymmetry of both free-surface elevation and cross-shore velocity, as well as Fourier

spectral analysis, were used to check the model sensitivity to the choice of the breaking

parameters. The analysis presented herein is focused on the control variables mentioned

before (Hrms of total and IG-waves only, Sk? and Bmax), which account for total and

IG wave height and nonlinearity.

Each parameter was varied independently, keeping the other three at their default

values. The angles for breaking initiation and cessation were varied within a range of

± 4° around the default values (?b = 26° and ?f = 6°). The value of ?b was increased
from 0.7 to 1, being 0.7 the default value of ?f ; inversely, the maximum ?f was defined

as the default value of ?b and the minimum to 0.50. This range of values was chosen for

representing breakers of the spilling type in realistic relative water depths (Cienfuegos

et al., 2010). The effect of varying the breaking-model parameters on the skewness and

Hrms of the waves is shown in Fig. 3.27.

As expected, changing the breaking parameters results in no significant changes

until the very end of the shoaling zone. In the surf zone, both Hrms and Sk? are more

sensitive to the variation of the parameters controlling the start of breaking than the

cessation of breaking. However, even in the case of varying ?b (the parameter with

a greater effect on the control variables) from the minimum to the maximum value

considered, the computed Hrms does not change significantly, with the breakpoint

position shifting onshore only about 3 m. The skewness is sensitive to the variation

of the breaking-model parameters, particularly regarding its maximum value (since

the shape is, in all A cases, well modelled); an exception is the variation of ?f , which

essentially conditions the Sk? of the waves in the swash zone, and only when increased

beyond 8°.

Fig. 3.28 presents the variation of the Bmax value as a function of the different values

chosen for the four physical breaking-model parameters, ?b, ?f , ?b and ?f . Regarding

this parameter (Bmax), varying ?b can result in a change of about 22%, which can be

reduced to as little as 4% if ?b is only changed by ± 1° or to about 11%, for a ± 2°
change. Similarly, Bmax can oscillate about 11% with ?b within a range of 0.7 to 1,

reducing to 5% if a range of ± 0.05 around the default value is considered. The Skmax
varies only about 11% when ?f , always assuming inferior values relatively to the default

?b, is changed between 0.55 and 0.8. However, in the case of Bmax, the variation of ?f

induces a change of 20%, almost as important as the variation of ?b.

Considering the parameter to which the nonlinearity is more sensitive, ?b, the results

show that changing it up to 15% (± 2°) around its default value, results in a variation

is thus plausible to assume that an increase or decrease in the Bmax for a given run

(specific wave conditions and bed slope) compared to a defined control run (previously

validated with experimental data) is significant and independent of the values chosen

for the breaking-wave model parameters when greater than 11%. The values chosen for

B conditions, ?b=27° and ?f =9° thus imply a very small change to the parameter-set

used for A conditions, with the advantage of allowing a better adjustment of Hrms and

Sk to B-series experimental data.

3.3.3 Model validation for vN2003 data set

In the last subsections, the SERR1D model was validated with data from the

GLOBEX project. Along those experiments the beach slope was kept constant. Thus,

it is convenient to validate the chosen set of model parameters for other experiments

run over a different beach. This is particularly important since the model will be used

to investigate the influence of the beach slope on wave propagation.

The van Noorloos (2003) experiments (vN2003) consisted of different irregular and

bichromatic wave conditions run over a 40 m-long fixed-bed beach with a 1/35 slope

starting at x = 8.5 m, from the wave-maker. The irregular-wave conditions C-1 (Tp

= 2.0 s, Hm0 = 0.05 m) and C-3 (Tp = 2.0 s, Hm0 = 0.1 m), ran during 40 min, were

chosen to validate SERR1D model for four main reasons: (i) most wave conditions

simulated with SERR1D are irregular-wave conditions and thus it is more important

to validate the model firstly for irregular waves; (ii) the Tp considered is within the

range of GLOBEX A conditions tested; (iii) C-3 Hm0 is the same as for A1 and A3;

and (iv) C-1 has a smaller Hm0 than GLOBEX conditions (and thus smaller steepness

than GLOBEX waves), offering an idea of the possible behaviour of SERR1D model

when it is forced with wave conditions beyond the range of GLOBEX wave conditions.

C-1 condition is particularly useful since some wave conditions that were simulated for

highlighting the influence of the different parameters on wave propagation imply forcing

the model with wave conditions significantly different from the conditions for which

it was calibrated in this work (GLOBEX A1 and A3 conditions). The wave-breaking

parameters were kept equal to GLOBEX runs and only the friction coefficient was

increased from 0.001 to 0.002 to better represent IG-wave energy in the beach of vN2003.

For C-1 condition, two input time series were considered: one obtained directly from

the wave gauge measurements (C-1E) and another obtained theoretically (C-1T). As

the wave-maker of vN2003 experiments did not have the capacity to absorb IG waves

coming from the beach, IG-wave height is enhanced from the beginning until the end

of the experiments. Thus, C-1E input time series provides more accurate results than

70



Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities Section 3.3

C-1T, as it includes the enhanced IG waves.

Fig. 3.29 shows that, with no change of the wave-breaking parameters, SERR1D

represents sufficiently well the mean water level and the wave height (both of total

and IG waves only) of vN2003 C-1 and C-3 experiments. The small differences found

between the measured and the simulated skewness maxima for C-3 (already visible

for A3 GLOBEX condition relatively to A1 GLOBEX condition) can be halved by

changing ?b by only 2° (shown in Fig. 3.29, similarly to what was shown for GLOBEX

B conditions). The free-surface elevation asymmetry maximum is found around 2 m

further onshore for numerical results than for experimental data, which was already

seen to be a limitation of the model with GLOBEX data as well.

3.3.4 Model results

After validation, the SERR1D model was used to simulate new wave conditions to

understand how different wave parameters and beach characteristics may influence the

71



Section 3.3 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities

wave nonlinearities. The default beach chosen was similar to the GLOBEX beach, with

the exception of the initial plane section of the bed, which was shortened (in about

7 m) to reduce computation time. The wave conditions simulated were scaled from

prototype and represent typical wind- and swell-waves conditions: wave heights from

0.6 to 2.6 m and wave periods from 7 to 17 s, with offshore spectral bandwidths that

vary from very-broad to very-narrow banded. This range of wave conditions can be

observed along the year, for example, in the west coasts of Europe, where Summer

waves have easily half a meter height and periods as short as 7 s and present commonly

broad-banded spectra and Winter high-energy swell waves having more narrow-banded

spectra and reaching frequently heights of 2.6 m and periods up to 17 s.

In order to better characterize the range of wave conditions that will be analysed, the

Ursell (eq. 3.25) and Iribarren (eq. 3.26) numbers can be calculated, as they describe

conveniently the characteristics of the waves and the beach slopes over which they

propagate. The Ursell number is used herein as in Ruessink et al. (2012),

Ur =

(kh)3
, (3.25)

with aw = 0.5Hs, k the local wave number computed with the linear theory using

T = m0/m1, where mn is the spectral moment of order n, and h is the local water depth.

The Iribarren number is calculated following Iribarren Cavanilles &amp;amp; Casto Nogales

(1949),

Ib =

Hs
L

, (3.26)

where Hs is the local significant wave height calculated for the duration of the time series,

L is the local wave length computed with the linear wave theory using T = m0/m1

and tan(?) the beach slope. For calculating the Iribarren number offshore (or at the

wave-maker), the offshore values of Hs and L are considered.

Fig. 3.30 shows the distribution, in the Ur0 (Ur at the wave-maker) and Ib0 (Ib at

the wave-maker) space, of all the irregular-wave conditions simulated. It also illustrates

that the synthetic wave conditions analysed in the following section have Ur and Ib

numbers similar to or within the range of the experimental wave conditions of GLOBEX

and vN2003 experiments. Therefore, the good results obtained by SERR1D in the

simulation of these experimental data support its usage for simulating a wide range of

wave conditions in which the subsequently-analysed wave conditions are included.

For the wave conditions considered, the spectra at the first wave gauge and the results

in terms of Hrms, Sk? and As? evolutions and Bmax values are presented subsequently.

Influence of offshore wave height, Hm0

Varying the offshore wave height influences both short-wave and IG-wave energy.

Further, if the offshore wave period is kept constant, changing wave height also changes

wave steepness: for the same period (and thus wave length), increasing wave height will

increase wave steepness. Fig. 3.31 shows how the increase in offshore short-wave energy

affects the non-linearity of the propagating waves. Smaller waves become very skewed,

Section 3.3 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities

with the skewness increasing fast over a short cross-shore distance, while bigger waves

reach a lower maximum skewness (around 74% lower), but stay skewed along a greater

cross-shore distance and reach larger asymmetry than very short waves. The overall

nonlinearity diminishes by 42% when the wave height is increased fourfold.

The input Hm0 was limited to 0.13 m, because the model runs became unstable when

greater offshore wave heights were chosen (without changing the values of the other

wave and beach parameters nor those of the breaking model). Slightly changing the

wave-breaking parameters or the model resolution allowed the extension of the model

application to greater wave heights but, for a question of consistency, runs with different

model parameters are not considered for comparison.

Influence of offshore peak period, Tp

Like varying the offshore wave height, keeping the offshore wave peak period constant

changes wave steepness, the inverse is also valid: for the same wave height, if the

period is increased, wave steepness decreases. Fig. 3.32 shows that ss the offshore

peak period increases, both the wave skewness and asymmetry start developing earlier

in the shoaling zone, increasing until their maxima are reached. Bmax can increase

up to about 22% when the peak period is doubled. For the greater-Tp runs, Hrms

increases before wave breaking, reflecting the need for a greater wave height to develop

(and greater wave steepness) to allow wave-breaking initiation. Furthermore, the wave

Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities Section 3.3

conditions with longer offshore peak period are shown to have higher IG-wave energy

at the wave-maker and in the shoaling zone. However, this is simply a direct result of

the fact that the wave conditions with longer peak periods were designed with greater

energy at the peak frequency (because the spectral range of frequencies considered was

smaller than for shorter peak periods), which implies higher IG-wave energy as well.

Influence of bandwidth, ?

A JONSWAP spectrum of irregular-wave conditions can have different bandwidths,

from broad- to narrow-banded, which essentially determines the main range of frequen-

cies that will interact along the beach profile, increasing wave nonlinearity and feeding

higher and lower frequencies than the peak frequency. Fig. 3.33 shows how changing

the bandwidth of the JONSWAP spectrum may influence the presence of IG waves and

nonlinearity. Bmax increases by about 20% if ? is varied between 1 and 20,000 while

IG-wave height in the surf zone can decrease more than 80%.

first wave gauge. Note: the purple curves correspond to A3T run.

Influence of beach slope, tan(?)

The beach slope has long been recognized to influence wave propagation. It conditions

the evolution of wave nonlinearity, the type of breaking and the reflection of IG waves.

Here, the bed slope was changed from 1/20 to 1/300 to analyse its influence on the

control variables. Fig. 3.34 shows how changing the bed slope, from very steep to very

75



Section 3.3 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities

gentle, influences wave propagation. Unlike for the previous cases, here the cross-shore

direction is considered in terms of water depth (h), instead of cross-shore distance (x),

which allows an easier comparison of the wave propagation over the different beach

slopes considered. In the case of steeper beaches, a sudden increase of wave height

close to the coast can be observed, which allows wave breaking to occur. The IG

waves increase their height towards the shore and only in the case of very gentle slopes

(tan(?) &gt; 80) does their height decrease before reaching the shoreline. There is an

increase of 58% of the Bmax when the beach slope is diminished from 1/20 to 1/300.

This increase is more significant for very-gentle slopes (gentler than 1/80), for which the

nonlinearities have more time to develop before reaching the coast. The fundamental

difference can be seen in the maximum value of Sk?, which can increase by 122% when

the beach slope changes from very steep to very gentle, or by 43% when the beach

slope is diminished only until 1/80. For steeper slopes, asymmetry starts increasing at

a greater water depth than for gentler slopes.

Influence of modulation

Changing the modulation of bichromatic wave groups is a direct way of analyzing

the effect of varying IG-wave height. Therefore, various bichromatic wave conditions

with different modulation were simulated, in order to investigate the effect on wave

propagation and nonlinearities. This was done by varying the amplitude of the main

76



Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities Section 3.3

frequency components (a1 and a2) of the bichromatic wave groups. The closer the

values of a1 and a2, the greatest the modulation and thus the IG-wave height. The

influence of the modulation on wave propagation is not analysed in terms of Bmax values

and hence Fig. 3.35 is slightly different from the figures presented for the previous

parameters evaluated. Since the focus is not on the maximum nonlinearity value, but

on the multiple existent maxima, instead of representing Bmax, the evolution of B

along the beach profile is shown. The spectra are zoomed on the main frequency peaks,

highlighting the amplitude differences of the main components between wave conditions.

Initially, the first six conditions (from blue to purple) are analysed. Among these, the

wave conditions with less modulation have significantly-smaller IG-wave height (blue

and green), even though total wave height is greater in the shoaling zone, due to the

greater short-wave energy resulting from the values of a1 and a2. They reach, locally,

greater values of nonlinearity, but the maxima are not located at the same cross-shore

positions as they are for the wave conditions with greater modulation.

From the analysis of GLOBEX B conditions, it was pointed out that the multiple

peaks of skewness could be attributed to both the existence of two breaker zones and

the influence of IG waves on short-wave nonlinearities. Among these, the first and

the second peaks can be accurately represented by the model, in terms of cross-shore

position (and, for the first, also in terms of amplitude). Fig. 3.35 shows that, when

wave breaking happens over a narrow surf zone, it has a local skewness and nonlinearity

peak associated (just before x = 60 m). This peak is greater for greater short-wave

height and weaker modulation. The position and value of the other peaks, however, vary

significantly as a function of the modulation. The blue lines of Fig. 3.35 plots represent

the wave condition with less modulation and greater short-wave energy. Contrary to the

other conditions, it has no skewness peak corresponding to the IG-wave trough located

between x = 65 m and x = 75 m and the greatest B and Sk values are reached in the

beginning of the swash zone. The green curves, corresponding to a wave condition with

slightly more modulation than the blue ones, show a decrease of the swash-zone peak

and the appearance of a peak at the IG-wave trough just after x=65 m. For the other

wave conditions with increasing modulation (red, cyan, violet) this skewness peak at

the IG-wave trough position is greater and more marked. The maximum B values occur

in the beginning of the swash zone, for conditions with less modulation, and closer to

the shoreline, when the modulation is greater. The first asymmetry maximum is greater

when modulation is weaker, and the second one when the modulation is stronger.

The influence of the modulation, when the short-wave height is kept the same, can be

seen in the difference between the condition with a1 = 0.09 m and a2 = 0.01 m (blue),

which has the smallest modulation of all the bichromatic conditions presented, and the

condition with a1 = 0.064 m and a2 = 0.064 m (yellow), which has the same energy, but

the greatest modulation possible. The higher modulation implies a larger variability of

the short-wave height, and thus a greater similitude with the irregular-wave conditions.

Hence, the breaking happens more gradually over a wider region of the domain, with

the higher waves breaking sooner than the smaller ones. The IG-waves height does

not follow an oscillating trend and the trends of Sk, As and B are smoother and with

smaller and less marked peaks, like it was observed for irregular-wave conditions. The

tendency for wave conditions with weaker modulation to have greater absolute values

of skewness and asymmetry maxima and greater B values is again confirmed when

conditions with the same short-wave energy but distinct modulations are considered

(the blue and yellow curves).

Overall, it is shown that the IG waves do influence the nonlinearities depending

on the modulation, but also depending on the ratio between the short-wave and the

IG-wave energy.

3.3.5 Discussion

The bichromatic-wave runs with different modulation have highlighted the influence

of IG waves on the short-wave nonlinearities. For the same short-wave height, larger

modulation (and thus higher IG waves) results in smaller nonlinearity maxima. This is in

agreement with Elgar &amp;amp; Guza (1985), who found interactions involving low frequencies

to tend to reduce free-surface elevation skewness and asymmetry. It is also shown that

78



Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities Section 3.3

increasing modulation of bichromatic-wave conditions results in a greater similitude

with the irregular-wave conditions, due to the greater variability of the short-wave

height: broader surf zone and less-marked local maxima of nonlinearity in the surf zone.

The irregular-wave runs have proven that the evolution and maxima of wave nonlin-

earity depend on several non-local parameters, such as the offshore wave height, period

and spectral bandwidth and the beach slope.

Dibajnia et al. (2001) have argued that waves with small offshore wave steepness

become more nonlinear during the shoaling process than those with great offshore

wave steepness, which eventually break in deeper waters before undergoing significant

shoaling. Hence, they have used in their parameterization of nonlinearities the offshore

wave steepness to define the value of the nonlinearity maximum that can be reached

along the beach profile for a give wave condition. This is in conformity with the results

presented, in which smaller offshore Hm0 (for the same offshore Tp) and greater offshore

Tp (for the same offshore Hm0), and thus smaller offshore wave steepness (H0/L0)

resulted in a greater maximum value of the nonlinearity parameter (Bmax).

Elgar &amp;amp; Guza (1985) have compared broad- and narrow-banded data sets and found

that the interactions between frequency pairs are spread over a wide range of frequencies

for a broad-band data set, and happen between relatively few triads (the spectral peak

and its harmonics) for a narrow-band case. These authors argued that skewness and

asymmetry for both cases are quite similar, but their results show a maximum skewness

value for the narrow-band case about at least 30 % larger than that found for the

broad-band case. Norheim et al. (1998) have found the spectral evolution to be much

weaker for wave conditions with broad-banded spectra, because the principal effect

of the triad interactions (interactions that involve two different frequencies and their

sum frequency) in this case is to spread energy to frequencies where spectral levels are

relatively low. For the narrow-banded spectra, thee authors observed harmonic peaks to

develop more significantly. The increasing value of the nonlinearity parameter (Bmax)

in response to the narrowing of the offshore wave spectrum presented in the previous

subsection thus corroborates the findings of those authors.

The results of the model simulations have also demonstrated that decreasing beach

steepness results in a greater development of the nonlinearities, particularly due to the

contribution of skewness. This is in agreement with Norheim et al. (1998), who found

gentler slopes to promote a stronger growth of the harmonic and infragravity peaks,

with a more important contribution from the real part of the bispectrum (skewness). For

steeper slopes, they found cumulative energy transfers to be smaller and the imaginary

part of the bispectrum (asymmetry) to be greater. For the steepest slopes simulated in

this work (1/35 and 1/20), asymmetry has indeed a greater contribution to the total

79



Section 3.4 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities

nonlinearity, but this is due to the relatively smaller contribution of the skewness to

the total, since the asymmetry increase (from gentle to steep slopes) is not significant.

More recently, Filipot (2015) has also argued the dependence of wave nonlinearity (in

particular, of wave skewness) on the beach slope. The author has established that

wave skewness at the breakpoint is a decreasing function of the bottom slope and thus

bottom slope may partially control breaking initiation.

It is then clear that wave nonlinearities may depend on more than local wave para-

meters. Rocha et al. (2013b) (presented in next subsection) have analyzed and applied

to field data existing parameterizations and concluded that offshore wave parameters

and the beach slope, which can be seen as the history of the waves, could bring an

improvement to the present estimations of velocity skewness and asymmetry, which is

the aim of the following section.

3.4 Parameterization of velocity nonlinearities

3.4.1 Field data - Parameterizations of wave nonlinearity from

local wave parameters

The article below was presented in Plymouth, at the International Coastal Symposium,

in 2013. It consists of an analysis of the performance of different parameterizations of

the velocity nonlinearities, for various sets of field data collected in different beaches

of the Portuguese coast. It is introduced here to highlight the fact that current

parameterizations that take into account only local wave parameters may include

significant errors in the estimations of velocity skewness and asymmetry, as suggested

in the previous section.

INTRODUCTION 
The skewness and asymmetry of the free-stream velocity, at the 

edge of the bottom boundary layer, play an important role on 

sediment transport, particularly in shallow, wave-dominated 

conditions, as the bed load transport is determined by the time-

varying bottom stress and the suspended-load transport depends 

on the time-varying residual velocities (Marlarkey and Davies, 

2012; Abreu et al. 2013). It is thus of paramount importance to 

accurately describe these nonlinear effects in order to better 

understand the cross-shore sediment transport and improve current 

beach profile morphodynamic models. 

Highly-advanced phase-resolving wave models, such as those 

based on the Boussinesq or the RANS equations, are able of 

accurately describing the transformation of each individual wave 

as it approaches the shore. However, these models are still too 

computationally demanding for application to morphodynamics 

settings and thus, for practical engineering purposes, simple 

analytical theories (linear and nonlinear) are often employed. 

The free-stream velocity, driven by the time-varying 

free-surface, represents the velocity immediately outside the wave 

bottom boundary layer and its skewness and asymmetry changes 

reflect the changing wave shape at the surface. Both skewness and 

asymmetry can be evaluated using different parameters suggested 

by several authors (e.g. Drake and Cantaloni, 2001; Elfrink et al., 

2006; Ruessink et al., 2009; Abreu et al., 2010). 

Although a wide set of different formulations has been 

developed for deriving free-stream wave orbital velocity from 

nonlinearity parameters (e.g. Isobe and Horikawa, 1982; Drake 

and Calantoni, 2001, Abreu et al., 2010), it can also be of great 

use, both for field-work purposes and numerical modeling, 

defining velocity skewness and asymmetry (and thus, the 

description of the wave shape) at a certain depth directly from 

local wave parameters, such as  wave height and period and water 

depth (Ursell number). 

Therefore, this work aims to compare three different recent 

parameterizations (Dibajnia et al., 2001 (DMW01, for simplicity); 

Elfrink et al., 2006 (EHR06); Ruessink et al., 2012 (RRR12)) with 

field data acquired in several sites under various wave energy 

conditions, in order to evaluate the applicability of each 

parameterization to other data than those considered in its 

formulation, to better insure the possibility of a wider use of these 

wave skewness and asymmetry parameterizations from local wave 

parameters. 

PARAMETERIZATIONS 
The three formulations considered in this work have in common 

the fact that some measure of wave nonlinearity is described by 

means of local wave parameters, for breaking and non-breaking 

waves, and constant sloping beds. In all cases, the free-stream 

velocity time series are calculated near the bottom, but outside the 

bottom boundary layer, and from those, the nonlinearity 

parameters considered for each formulation are computed.  

Dibajnia et al. (2001) parameterization 
This parameterization was developed for irregular waves, 

based on a set of wave flume experiments. Nevertheless, its 

adjustment to field data will be studied in this work and compared 

with other field-based formulations.

Three different parameterizations of wave nonlinearity from local wave parameters are applied to field data (free-

surface elevation and flow velocities) gathered in different beaches along the Portuguese coast, under diverse wave 

conditions. The hydrodynamics of the various sites are analyzed, together with the performance of each formulation. 

The data considered extend the range of the data previously used by the authors of the parameterizations, including 

longer wave lengths and higher Ursell numbers. A comparison is done, based on skill and agreement index values, to 

understand the performance and applicability of each parameterization and what could be changed to improve such 

formulations.

Parameterizations of wave nonlinearity from local wave parameters: a comparison with field data 

Dibajnia et al. (2001) define two parameters: the nonlinearity 

parameter,  

    (
    

 ?
)
   

  (1) 

where      is the velocity at the wave crest and  ? is the velocity 
amplitude (from crest to trough), and the asymmetry parameter, 

    (
    

 
)
   

  (2) 

with     defined as the time interval between the velocity zero 

up-crossing before the crest and the wave-crest maximum, and   
the wave period. For a purely-sinusoidal wave shape, these 

parameters have a value of 0.5, increasing or decreasing for 

greater nonlinearity or asymmetry, respectively. These can be 

defined for each Ursell number, here described as 

   
         

 

  
 

        
 

  
   (3) 

assuming shallow water approximation (  ?  ), where     , 

     and      are the significant wave height, period and length,   

the local water depth and   the acceleration of gravity.  
The shapes of the parameterization curves include a 

maximum, for nonlinearity, and a minimum, for asymmetry. The 

estimation of the position of these peaks depends on offshore 

wave steepness (  /  ). Hence, this formulation is expected to be 
sensitive to the definition of offshore wave conditions, which are 

obtained from the available wave buoys (for field data), often 

located at a significant distance from each field site. The 

dependence of Nlp and Asp peaks on deep water wave steepness 

has already been analyzed by Dibajnia et al. (2001) 

The sensitivity to offshore wave conditions can be a positive 

point for this formulation, as wave history is accounted for, and 

may lead to a better description of local wave conditions. 

When applying this formulation, it should be taken into 

account that it was developed based on experimental data 

collected in a wave flume with uniform bottom slope and that the 

local values of the Nlp and Asp were obtained using the results of 

wave height transformation calculated by an energy conservation 

method. 

Elfrink et al. (2006) parameterization 
This formulation also considers a wave-by-wave analysis to 

define nonlinearity parameters from local wave characteristics. 

However, instead of directly calculating skewness and asymmetry 

parameters, these authors derived synthetic orbital-velocity time 

series, using a set of simple sinusoidal functions for defining the 

shape of each segment between the maximum and minimum 

velocities and the zero-crossings. The nonlinearity of each 

individual wave is determined from local parameters, such as 

normalized wave height (      ), where   is the height of an 
individual wave and   is the local water depth) and length 
(      , with   the wave length calculated according to Airy 
wave theory, from the period T of each individual wave) and the 

Iribarren number, defined as 

   
    

?(
 

  
)
    (4) 

where   is the local bed slope and    the offshore wave length. 
Skewness and asymmetry can then be calculated from the 

synthetic orbital-velocity time series and analyzed in function of 

the Ursell number, here defined as: 

              (5) 
Skewness (  ) and asymmetry (  ) calculated for this 

parameterization and also for the next one, proposed by Ruessink 

et al. (2012), are calculated from the third-order moments defined 

in (6) and (7).

where the over bar represents a time average,       is the total 
sea-swell orbital velocity in the direction of wave advance,    is 

the standard deviation of       and           the imaginary part 
of  the Hilbert transform of      . 

For a purely-sinusoidal shape, both parameters have a 0 value, 

which becomes progressively more positive or negative, for larger 

skewness or asymmetry, respectively. 

Ruessink et al. (2012) parameterization 
Most recently, a new methodology to compute nonlinearity 

parameters representative of a series of random, natural waves 

from local wave parameters was suggested by Ruessink et al. 

(2012). These authors argue that even though individual waves 

may be rather accurately described by parameterizations based on 

a wave-by-wave analysis, error accumulation makes the use of a 

series of individual waves to estimate time-averaged measures of 

wave nonlinearity questionable. Thus, based on statistical and 

spectral parameters, the authors compute the dependence of    
and    on the Ursell number, defined here as 

   
 

 

   

     
 

 

    
   

 

  
     

   
 

  
    (8) 

where           (   being the significant wave height),   and  
  are, respectively, the local wave number and corresponding 

wave length computed with linear wave theory using   (  
  

  
, 

where    is the spectral moment of order  ). If the significant 
wave length is considered, then the Ur defined in equation (8) is 

about 0.01 times the Ur described in equation (3). 

The authors of this parameterization also stress the fact that it  

is based predominantly on directionally-spread sea conditions and 

will tend to underestimate the skewness of orbital velocity in 

narrow-banded swell and unidirectional laboratory waves and that 

the data used in the development of these formulations were 

collected in low sloping (&amp;lt;1/30) wide sandy beaches. 

 

It should be further noted that, although in this paper the wave 

nonlinearities are always referred to as skewness and asymmetry, 

this is only literally true for EHR06 and RRR12 

parameterizations, in which these parameters are calculated from 

the third-order moments of orbital velocity. For DMW01 case, the 

parameters considered are instead a nonlinearity parameter, as an 

equivalent for skewness and an asymmetry parameter, for 

asymmetry. These depend on the values and time instants (along 

the wave period) of velocity maxima, minima and zero-crossing 

values.  

Also, a good agreement is not expected when the results are 

extrapolated beyond the range of the empirical data in which the 

formulations are based. 

FIELD DATA 
The data used in this work were collected at four different field 

sites in Portugal: Mira and Ofir beaches, on the northwest coast, 

Costa da Caparica (CC) beach, on the west coast, near Lisbon, and 

Galé beach, on the southern coast (Figure 1). During each tidal 

cycle, in every field site, one or more pairs of a pressure 

transducer (PT) and a collocated electromagnetic current meter 

(ECM) were placed at different points along the beach profile, to 

measure free-surface elevation and horizontal velocity, 

respectively, outside the bottom boundary layer. Table 1 offers a 

brief description of the offshore wave conditions and beach

Parameterizations of wave nonlinearity from local wave parameters: a comparison with field data 

characteristics of each field site. The rocky bottom of Galé beach 
corresponds to a 50 m-wide shore platform with constant 

steepness, extending from the cliff foot and adjacent to the sandy 

beach profile. Galé 1 and 2 data sets were collected in the 

beginning of the seaward-end of the platform and Galé 3 and 4 

near the cliff. 

Figure 2 depicts the field data coverage in terms of wave 

height over water depth (H/h) and wavelength over water depth 

(L/h) and Figure 3 also shows the data coverage, but considering 

Iribarren (Ib) and Ursell (Ur) numbers. 

Most data were collected in the inner surf zone, encompassing 

all types of breakers, with a greatest occurrence of spilling 

(Ib ? 0.4) and plunging (0.4 &amp;lt;Ib ? 2.5) breakers, for all data sets, 

and some collapsing (2.5 &amp;lt;Ib ? 3) and surging breakers (Ib &gt; 3), 

for Mira field site. The data span a wide range of wave heights and 

lengths and different beach slopes and types of bed are considered. 

Relatively to the data used by the authors of DMW01, EHR06 and 

RRR12 parameterizations, the data sets considered herein present 

greater wavelengths and larger Ursell numbers. 

METHODS 
In order to evaluate which of the three chosen 

parameterizations performs better for the field data collected, local 

wave parameters were obtained from free-surface elevation time 

series and applied to calculate free-stream wave orbital velocity 

skewness and asymmetry, according to each chosen 

parameterization. These nonlinearity values were then compared 

with the values calculated directly from the free-stream wave 

orbital velocity measured with the collocated current meters. 

The PT and ECM data corresponding to periods of emersion 

of the instruments were removed, implying that the analysis 

performed did not include any data from the swash zone. All free-

surface elevation time series were then divided into 15-min 

intervals and filtered, so that only sea-swell waves were 

considered (frequency range 0.05-0.33 Hz), following the work of 

Ruessink et al. (2012).  Also for the velocity time-series 15-min 

intervals were considered, and low- and high-frequency 

components (f &amp;lt;0.05 Hz and f &gt; 1 Hz) were filtered out. All 

gathered records of cross-shore and longshore orbital velocities 

were combined into time series of total sea-swell orbital velocity 

in the direction of wave advance, using eigenfunction analysis, for 

which the required nonlinearity parameters were then computed. 

Further, it is important to stress that for the various field sites, a 

different number of 15-min intervals was considered depending on 

the length of the time series available. 

For both DMW01 and EHR06 methods a wave-by-wave 

analysis was necessary for calculating the Ursell number, and in 

the case of DMW01, also for calculating nonlinearity and 

asymmetry parameters. Hence, it was necessary to identify each 

individual wave present in the complete free-surface 
elevation/velocity time series. For that, a zero-crossing method 

was used, implying a need for defining a threshold value for the 

smallest height that an individual wave must possess to be 

considered a single wave (this threshold is defined as a certain 

percentage of the maximum wave height of the time series). After

Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 65, 2013 

Parameterizations of wave nonlinearity from local wave parameters: a comparison with field data 

some testing, both EHR06 and DMW01 parameterizations have 

shown some sensitivity to the choice of such threshold and a value 

of 0.01 (corresponding to 1% of the maximum wave height of the 

time series) was chosen for both the free-surface elevation time 

series and the velocity time series. 

Per contra, RRR12 parameterization involves instead a 

statistical analysis, avoiding possible problems derived from the 

wave-by-wave analysis, such as the mentioned sensitivity to the 

zero-crossing method threshold and error accumulation. 

Furthermore, DMW01 parameterization depends as well on 

deep-water wave conditions (wave steepness) for defining the 

maximum and minimum peaks in the curves of nonlinearity and 

asymmetry. Also EHR06 parameterization depends on offshore 

conditions, although indirectly, through the Iribarren number. In 

the laboratory, these conditions are easy to define, since the input 

conditions for the wave maker are known. However, in the field, it 

becomes substantially more difficult to have good-quality wave 

data offshore. In the case of the considered field campaigns, these 

data were gathered from low-resolution wave buoy measurements, 

from the closest-available wave buoy for each field site. Hence, 

the inaccuracy of deep-water conditions used in the 

parameterizations must also be taken into account. 

For evaluating the capability of each formulation to fit field 

data, two different parameters were considered. The skill 

coefficient, which represents, for each field data point, a scaled 

measure of its deviation from the parameterization, can be 

formulated as: 

        ?
?        

  
   

?     
  

   

    (9) 

where    are the field data values,    the values calculated with the 
parameterizations and   is the number of values considered. 
Negative skill values can occur if           , corresponding to 
a very poor performance of the parameterization. A perfect 

performance will reach a skill score of 1.  

The other parameter considered, the agreement index, has the 

advantage of depicting if the general trend of the field data follows 

each parameterization, instead of just evaluating the proximity 

between numerical and field values at each point, and will thus be 

of great importance for choosing the best formulation. It can be 

calculated as: 

     
?        

  
   

?  |    ?| |    ?| 
  

   

   (10) 

where  ? represents the mean value of the   field data values 
considered. This index can only have values from 0 (poor 

performance) to 1 (perfect performance). 

PARAMETERIZATIONS AND FIELD DATA 
In this section, the results obtained with the three different 

parameterizations are compared with the field data obtained in the 

various field sites. 

Dibajnia et al. (2001) parameterization 
Figure 4 shows the different curves obtained with DMW01 

parameterization for each field site (characterized by different 

offshore wave steepness) and the distribution of field-data values. 

In general, the magnitude of the values is fairly well 

described, which is corroborated by skill values over 0.95, for Nlp 

and 0.7, for Asp (see Figure 8). The cloud of points approximately 

follows the parameterization curve, although a shift towards 

higher Ursell numbers is notorious. This results in fairly good 

agreement indexes for some particular cases, but an average AI 

around 0.4, for Nlp, and lower, for Asp. CC and Ofir field sites 

present the best fits, with fairly high AI for Nlp. 

This parameterization was developed based on wave flume 

experimental data. For this type of data, the mean period, Tz, 

calculated from the spectral moments m1 and m0, can be 

considered equivalent to the significant wave period, T1/3 or Ts, as 

the wave spectrum is narrow banded. However, when field data 

are considered, the wave spectrum cannot always be considered 

narrow banded. Therefore, the equivalence Tz = T1/3 does not 

necessarily hold, and Tz tends to be smaller than T1/3. Hence, the 

Ursell numbers calculated for this parameterization for the data 

sets considered herein are overestimated (as a higher T implies a 

higher Ur), which explains the shift of field-data values to the 

right side of the theoretical curves of the parameterization. Figure 

5 shows the results obtained with this parameterization when Tz is 

considered instead of Ts (calculated with the zero-crossing 

method), and it can be clearly seen that the shift to higher Ur 

present in Figure 4 is corrected. This is corroborated by an 

increase of skill, particularly for asymmetry, for which the scores 

rise for values above 0.9 for most data sets (not shown). The AI 

values also increase, both for the nonlinearity and the asymmetry 

parameters, which reach values of almost 0.9. 

Elfrink et al. (2006) parameterization 
The results for this parameterization are shown from a 

different perspective (Figure 6). The main aim for which it was

Parameterizations of wave nonlinearity from local wave parameters: a comparison with field data 

developed was the construction of a synthetic velocity time series 

from local wave parameters that was able of including different 

individual wave shapes. Thus, skewness (eq. 6) and asymmetry 

(eq. 7) were calculated both for the measured and the synthetic 

time series and directly compared, independently of the Ursell 

number, although the parameters employed for the evaluation of 

its performance are, for a question of consistency, the same as for 

the other parameterizations. 

There is clearly a great scatter both for skewness and 

asymmetry: the field values are mostly under- and overestimated, 

respectively, except for the values corresponding to the second 

tidal cycle in Galé beach and to Mira beach, where asymmetry is 

mostly underestimated. Particularly for skewness, most skill 

scores are rather low, between less than 0.2 to less than 0.5, and 

the AI is never higher than 0.5 (see Figure 8). Also, synthetic 

skewness calculated for Mira data set has negative values, while 

measured skewness presents only positive values, and hence the 

performance of EHR06 parameterization is particularly poor for 

this field site, which results in a negative value of the skill score, 

significantly lower than the other values. For asymmetry, the 

performance of this formulation is better, although skill values can 

vary substantially depending on the data set. 

Ruessink et al. (2001) parameterization 
Observing Figure 7 it is clear that data still present a 

considerable scatter relatively to this parameterization, particularly 

for Mira and Galé sites. However, for the other field sites, the 

general trends of skewness and asymmetry dependency on the 

Ursell number are significantly well described, as it is depicted by 

the high agreement indexes, particularly for asymmetry (almost 

reaching 0.9), that are above the ones calculated for the other 

parameterizations (see Figure 8). Especially if only data from 

Costa da Caparica and Ofir beach sites are looked at, asymmetry 

skill scores calculated are high, above 0.75. Nevertheless, there is 

still a considerable spread for both skewness and asymmetry 

agreement-index values from very low values to high values, 

depending on the data set considered. 
Still, it should be noted that, except for the data corresponding 

to the second tidal cycle in Galé beach, the scatter observed both 

for skewness and asymmetry is very similar to the scatter obtained 

by Ruessink et al. (2012) for their own data. This parameterization 

performs notoriously worst for Mira and Galé field sites. 

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
EHR06 parameterization generally presents the worst 

performance for the field data considered in this work. Not having 

been directly developed for parameterizing skewness and 

asymmetry, but instead for creating synthetic velocity time series, 

it is clear that wave velocity nonlinearities are not easily well 

reproduced with this formula. Also, the offshore wave period was 

found to have a significant influence on synthetic skewness and 

asymmetry and this is a variable for which it is hard to get 

high-quality data. Further, this parameterization fails completely 

to predict skewness for Mira field site, when local H/h and L/h are 

substantially outside the range of values used to develop the 

formulation (higher and longer waves) and the Iribarren number is 

higher (steeper beach slope), corresponding to plunging, 

collapsing and surging breaker types. Also, a long set of equations 

is needed to define the shape of each individual wave, which 

makes the application of this formulation rather cumbersome. It 

shall be of greater interest in the case of the specific shape of each 

wave being important, rather than when statistical parameters 

(such as skewness and asymmetry) are calculated for a set of 

waves, as it is done herein. 

DMW01 parameterization describes quite well Nlp and Asp 

magnitudes. Skill scores for this parameterization are very similar 

for all field campaigns, unlike what is found for the other 

formulations, particularly RRR12, for which the measurements of

Parameterizations of wave nonlinearity from local wave parameters: a comparison with field data 

Galé and Mira beaches deviate more significantly from the 

theoretical curves than the rest. The shift of data points to higher 

Ursell numbers than predicted by the theoretical curves can be 

attenuated by calculating Ur from Tz (like it is done for RRR12 

formulation) instead of from Ts. The fact that this 

parameterization, even having been developed based on wave 

flume experimental data, is able of reproducing well all the field 

data sets (particularly if Tz is considered), may point out the 

importance of considering offshore wave conditions for 

encompassing a greater range of wave conditions and beaches. 

Regarding RRR12 parameterization, Ofir and Costa da 

Caparica data sets seem to fit really well to the theoretical curves 

and even the variation of skewness and asymmetry in function of 

the Ur number is well represented, not only their magnitudes. This 

is corroborated by the higher agreement index values calculated 

for almost all data sets and constitutes the greatest achievement of 

this formulation when compared to the others (if DMW01 is not 

applied considering Tz).  

However, for Galé and Mira beaches, a greater scatter can be 

observed for skewness and a strong underestimation of asymmetry 

is also clear. This possibly denounces an important handicap of 

parameterizations based on few and local-only wave parameters: 

these can perform very well when applied to beaches very similar 

to the ones used for developing the formulations, but fail to predict 

skewness and asymmetry for field sites with different 

characteristics. This explains why Ofir and Costa da Caparica field 

sites, being the only sandy beaches considered with slopes inferior 

to 1/30, fit nicely to that parameterization, which was developed 

based on data collected in such type of beaches. Nevertheless, this 

formulation seems to be more robust for inner surf zone and/or 

strong plunging breakers. 

The data sets deviating the most from RRR12 

parameterization seem to show one of two or both characteristics: 

either these measurements present higher values of L/h and H/h 

than the rest, or higher Ib values. The Mira data set, which never 

really fits any parameterization, possesses both characteristics, 

with a particularly high ratio of H and h and the highest Ib 

measured. The first may be due to bed erosion/accretion along the 

tidal cycle that could result in a higher water depth during high 

tide than the measured during the previous and the following low 

tides, which would have reduced H/h during that period to more 

common values. However, this cannot be confirmed with the data 

available. The second is associated with both a steeper beach slope 

and longer wave periods (   ?  ). Also, the combined effect of 
both larger wave heights and shorter wave periods leads to large 

Ib values, associated with very asymmetric waves, as it can be 

seen for the second-tidal-cycle data of Galé beach, which deviate 

further from the parameterization than the rest. 

Galé data sets do not have a very high Ib, but have instead 

significantly-large wave lengths for the small wave heights and 

water depths measured. Since this particular beach has a complex 

morphology with shore platforms, the cliff, a mixture of sandy and 

rocky beds, inducing wave refraction and reflection along the 

shoaling and breaking zones, it is not possible with the data 

available to explain the exact origin of the measured wave 

conditions, but only to analyze their characteristics. 

 

Overall, it is clear that, although RRR12 parameterization can 

simulate very accurately the dependence of skewness and 

asymmetry on the Ursell number for a specific set of wave 

conditions and low-sloping sandy beaches, it cannot be used to 

parameterize nonlinearities from local wave parameters for other 

types of beaches.  

The characteristics of the data sets that deviate the most from 

the theoretical curves and the fact that DMW01 parameterization 

is fairly capable of reproducing the magnitude of nonlinearity and 

asymmetry parameters (even though it was developed from 

laboratory data sets and is unable of reproducing so well the 

general trend of the data), lead to the conclusion that both beach 

slope and offshore wave conditions should be incorporated in any 

parameterization aiming to define skewness and asymmetry in the 

nearshore for a wide range of beach types and wave conditions. 

Further developments of this work should include the search 

of such parameterization, starting by the quantification of the 

relative importance of the different offshore wave parameters and 

the beach slope on the variation of skewness and asymmetry in the 

nearshore.

3.4.2 The RRR12 parameterization

Ruessink et al. (2012) recently proposed a parameterization (RRR12) that constitutes

an extension of previous work done by Doering &amp;amp; Bowen (1995) and Kuriyama (2009)

and defines, for irregular waves, the dependency of velocity nonlinearity on local wave

height and period and water depth (the Ursell number, eq. 3.25). This parameterization

has been shown to perform better than other existing parameterizations within a certain

range of wave conditions and beach slopes (discussed in the previous subsection, Rocha

et al., 2013b). However, since it is based only on the Ur number, it still presents some

limitations when the wave conditions or beach slopes are beyond range of those in which

it was based. This section is hence dedicated to the improving of this parameterization

by the inclusion of non-local wave parameters.

In RRR12 parameteriztion, B (eq. 3.24) and ? (? = tan?1
(

)
) nonlinearity

parameters are parameterized as

B = p1 +
p2 ?p1

1 + exp(
p3?log(Ur)

p4
)

(3.27)

and

? = ?90° + 90° tanh(p5/Urp6 ), (3.28)

with p1 = 0, p2 = 0.857 ± 0.016, p3 = ?0.417 ± 0.025, p4 = 0.297 ± 0.021, p5 =
0.815±0.055 and p6 = 0.672±0.073, where the range represented by the ± values is the
95% confidence interval. The parameterizations of Sku and Asu can thus be deduced,

Sku = B cos (?) (3.29)

and

Asu = B sin (?) . (3.30)

Fig. 3.36 shows the parameterization curves of Sku and Asu, as a function of Ur

and the data points in which the RRR12 parameterization is based.

In order to compare the numerical results with the parameterization, the velocity

nonlinearities must be calculated. As it was shown before, SERR1D model represents

well the free-surface elevation evolution and the wave nonlinearities. However, since

it calculates the velocity integrated over the entire water column, it overestimates the

experimental velocity. Although for the velocity asymmetry the model still provides

a correct estimation, it overestimates velocity skewness along the beach profile (in

up to 22%, for A3, see Fig. A.1). Therefore, a direct comparison of the SERR1D

results with RRR12 parameterization would include a bias due to this limitation of the

numerical model. To overcome this limitation, u? is used instead of the velocity time

series provided by the model. u? is calculated as previously described in subsection

3.2.5, from the computed free-surface elevation time series, for a depth of 0.02 cm above

the bottom and it is shown (see the dots in Figs. 3.23 and A.1) to provide an accurate

estimation of the velocity nonlinearities until their maxima (near the beginning of the

inner-surf zone).

3.4.3 Comparison with GLOBEX and vN2003 experimental

and numerical data

Initially, the RRR12 parameterization is applied to GLOBEX A1, A2 and A3 (for

which experimental velocity measurements are also available) and vN2003 C-1 and C-3

wave conditions and then to the results of SERR1D simulations, in order to evaluate

the possibility of velocity skewness and asymmetry being simply described as a function

of Ur. The results are presented in terms of Sku, Asu, B and ?, in function of Ur.

Fig. 3.37 shows the comparison between the numerical and experimental results

obtained for the three irregular-wave conditions of the GLOBEX experiments and the

RRR12 parameterization. It is for A1 and A2 experimental results that the RRR12

parameterization provides the best estimation of nonlinearity. For A3 (more narrow-

banded and smaller wave steepness than A1 and A2), the deflection point of the

values of parameter B is observed for lower Ur values than those proposed by the

parameterization, and skewness is underestimated, particularly after the breakpoint

(grey circles of Fig. 3.37). Very small values of Sku imply unrealistic values of ?

and thus the data points deviate from the parameterization of ? in the shoaling zone

(presenting an asymptotic behaviour before the nonlinearity starts increasing).

Fig. 3.38 is similar to the previous figure, but since for vN2003 experiments very

few measurements of velocity are available, the experimental velocity is actually the

u? velocity computed from the experimental free-surface elevation measurements, in

contrast to the numerical velocity, which is the velocity u? obtained from the numerical

free-surface elevation data. As for the GLOBEX case, the parameterization better

estimates the nonlinearities for the wave conditions with characteristics within the

main range of Ruessink et al. (2012) data, C-3. For C-1, which has a much lower

wave steepness than the main range of simulations presented herein (recall Fig. 3.30),

RRR12 parameterization clearly underestimates the maximum Sku by about 40% and

the maximum B by around 30%.

3.4.4 Comparison with a varied set of wave conditions

In the previous section, the SERR1D model was used to simulate wave conditions with

varying offshore wave height, period and spectral bandwidth and different beach slopes.

The results obtained are subsequently compared to the nonlinearity values predicted

by the RRR12 parameterization to investigate the capacity of the parameterization

for predicting the nonlinearity of wave conditions with different characteristics. This

comparison is depicted in Figs. 3.39, 3.40, 3.41 and 3.42, for varying offshore Hm0, Tp

and spectral bandwidth and beach slope, respectively.

The different wave and beach characteristics result in a deviation from the curves

of the RRR12 parameterization and an over- or underestimation of the nonlinearities,

which can be summed up in the following points:

? the underestimation of Sku and B increases with decreasing offshore wave height

(Fig. 3.39), increasing offshore wave period (Fig. 3.40) and decreasing beach slope

(Fig. 3.42), especially after breaking;

? for very-long-period waves Asu is underestimated in the shoaling zone (Fig. 3.40);

? for very steep slopes (tan(?)?1 = 1/20, Fig. 3.42), phasing is underestimated

after breaking (which is in accordance with the limit of application of the para-

meterization prescribed by Ruessink et al. (2012): it should not be applied when

tan(?)?1 = 1/20);

? narrowing the bandwidth increases the underestimation of Sku and B along the

entire profile (even in the end of the shoaling);

? Sku values at the beginning of the shoaling (Ur &amp;lt;0.1) are overestimated for all

90



Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities Section 3.4

wave conditions and beach slopes, while corresponding B values are underestim-

ated;

? Sku is more influenced by the characteristics of the wave conditions and the beach

slope than Asu.

The small overestimation of Asu and of ? present for all conditions is inherent to

the computation of u? from the numerical ?, which has a small cross-shore shift of 3-4

m between numerical results and experimental data. However, since the major changes

of the nonlinearity are driven by Sku changes, this shift is of minor importance for the

following analysis.

Most wave conditions simulated have Sku and Asu values that fall within the cloud

of points presented by Ruessink et al. (2012) (Fig. 3.36). However, that cloud of points

has a considerable scatter around the parameterization trend and thus, for one same

Ur value, the Sku and Asu can vary between 0 and 1.5. Hence, for some of the wave

conditions simulated, the Sku overestimation may reach more than 100%. Therefore, the

hypothesis that Ur is not the unique parameter that defines the nonlinearity of the waves

along the entire profile, already proposed by other researchers (see subsection 3.3.5),

seems very likely. This is particularly evident for the greatest values of nonlinearity,

corresponding to cross-shore positions near the end of shoaling and throughout the

surf zone, meaning that the greater misestimation of the velocity nonlinearities is

precisely focused on the zones of the profile where they contribute the most for sediment

transport.

Since the RRR12 parameterization has been recently used by several researchers

to calculate the sediment transport related to velocity skewness and asymmetry (e.g.

Aagaard &amp;amp; Jensen 2013; Dubarbier et al. 2015), it is of interest to seek its improvement

to ameliorate the estimations of sediment transport. Abreu et al. (2014) has shown

that varying the values of the p parameters in the RRR12 formulation within the

error intervals defined by Ruessink et al. (2012) (which somehow take into account

the dispersion of the experimental values) did not change significantly the predicted

morphodynamics of the littoral bar in the LIP experiments (Arcilla et al., 1994). Hence,

the inclusion of other non-local parameters may be a good contribution to improve the

RRR12 parameterization, so that it can adjust to more varied wave conditions and

beach slopes. The common characteristics of the wave conditions with nonlinearity

values that tend to deviate more from the predicted curves can help in underpinning

the parameters necessary for this adjustment.

3.4.5 Dependence of nonlinearities on the new parameter NP 0

and on ?

Two characteristics of the wave conditions for which Sku and B values were shown

to deviate from the main cloud of data points were smaller wave heights and longer

periods. For the same wave period, if the offshore wave height is decreased (Fig. 3.39),

93



Section 3.4 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities

offshore wave steepness (H0/L0) is also decreased. If instead it is the wave height that is

kept constant and the wave period increased (Fig. 3.40), wave steepness also decreases.

This suggests that small wave steepness is the characteristic promoting the deviation of

Sku and B values of wave conditions with small wave heights and long wave periods

from the RRR12 parameterization. Besides small offshore wave steepness, also very

steep or very gentle beach slopes tend to deviate Sku and B values from the RRR12

parameterization curves.

The Iribarren number (eq. 3.26) includes both the contribution of the beach slope and

the square-root of wave steepness. However, since the wave steepness is included through

its square-root, its effect on the variation of the nonlinearity is minored. Consequently,

it is also considered separately from the Ib parameter. The dependence of the Sk?,max

on both parameters (offshore wave steepness and Iribarren) is depicted in the first and

second plots of Fig. 3.43, for GLOBEX (A1, A2 and A3) and vN2003 (C-1, C-2, C-3,

D-1, D-2, D-3) experimental data.

Neither the offshore wave steepness nor the Iribarren number are shown to be able

of fully describing the variation of nonlinearity as a function of the wave condition

considered. Therefore, a new combined parameter, NP0 = Ib0(H0/L0)
2 is defined

(third plot of Fig. 3.43). This parameter includes the influence of the beach slope,

through the Ib0 parameter, and the influence of offshore wave steepness, but magnified,

through (H0/L0)
2. The third plot of Fig. 3.43 depicts the dependence of Sk?,max on

NP0, which indicates a marked decrease from higher values of nonlinearity, for lower

values of NP0, to lower values of nonlinearity, for higher values of NP0. The same

dependence of Sk?,max on NP0 is observed for the numerical data, presented in Fig.

3.44.

Departing from the power dependence of Sk?,max on NP0, the dependence on this

parameter on other measures of nonlinearity (Sku,max, Bmax and the value of ? at

Less important, but also evident in Figs. 3.44 and 3.45, is the dependence on the

offshore spectral bandwidth (?), which is illustrated in those figures by the almost-

vertical trend of the data points represented by dots. The influence of ? induces a

variation of nonlinearity that is smaller than that associated with NP0, but independent

of wave steepness and beach slope (and thus of NP0 as well).

3.4.6 Improved parameterization (mRRR12)

The main aim of finding a dependence of nonlinearity on parameters other than the

Ursell number, is to reduce the dispersion of RRR12 parameterization and thus allow a

better representation of velocity nonlinearities for distinct wave conditions, in different

beaches. Therefore, the relationship between the nonlinear parameters and NP0 must

be included in the parameterization.

The non-dimensional parameters p1-p6 (see eqs. 3.27 and 3.28) can be used to change

the shape of the RRR12 parameterization curves. In particular, p2 is responsible for the

definition of the Bmax value and p5 determines the value of ? at Ur=1. Fig. 3.45 shows

95



Section 3.4 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities

that a relationship between Bmax and NP0 can be retrieved. Besides this relationship,

if only the changing-? runs are considered, a different power relationship can be found

Fig. 3.46 shows an example of the application of the modified parameterization to

the GLOBEX wave conditions. When the dependence of p2 and p5 terms on NP0 and

? is included in the parameterization, it can adapt to the nonlinearity evolution of each

wave condition. Figs. 3.47 and 3.48 summarize the results of the application of the

mRRR12 parameterization.

In Fig. 3.47, the results obtained with the mRRR12 (coloured markers in Fig.

3.47) for the nonlinearities are compared with the results obtained using RRR12

parameterization (grey markers in Fig. 3.47) and the root-mean-square errors (RMSE,

calculated between the data and the parameterization curves) are shown (the values

inside the parentheses correspond to the calculations made considering only data points

for which Sku &gt; 0.3). Fig. 3.48 shows the improvement of the RMSE from the RRR12

to the mRRR12 parameterization, for each of the wave conditions, considering, once

again, either all data points (darker markers) or only data points for which Sku &gt; 0.3

(lighter markers). This helps in evaluating for which wave conditions and nonlinearity

parameters the improvement is more significant.

The results of the application of the mRRR12 parameterization can be summed up:

? The underestimation of Sku is reduced (in terms of RMSE) by 26% (or 64% for

data with Sku &gt; 0.3);

data with Sku &gt; 0.3);

? The overestimation of ? is reduced (in terms of RMSE) by 7% (or 51% for data

with Sku &gt; 0.3);

? The improvement of Sk and As is generally greater for wave conditions with longer

offshore peak period or smaller offshore wave height (smaller wave steepness),

more narrow-banded spectra and very gentle slopes;

? For the four nonlinearity parameters, the improvement is greater for greater values

of nonlinearity.

The ? values of the data have a greater scatter, and thus the fit is poorer, which

results in a smaller improvement than for the other parameters. However, it was

shown that Sk and B are the most affected by the different characteristics of the wave

conditions and for these parameters the improvement is of almost 30% (and of 64%, for

Sku and 48%, for B, when Sku¿0.3). This RMSE improvement is calculated taking

into account the data points along the entire beach profile and therefore results from

an averaging of the improvement achieved for each cross-shore position. As it can

be observed in Fig. 3.47, in the beginning of the shoaling zone (lower nonlinearity

parameterization, but it is near the breakpoint (greatest values of nonlinearity) that it

results in the best improvement of the nonlinearity estimation. This is confirmed by

the greater reduction of the RMSE achieved when only data points with Sku values

higher than 0.3 are considered. The 0.3 threshold was roughly chosen, as an example, to

disconsider values which are clearly in the beginning of the shoaling zone. The greater

the value chosen for this threshold, the greater the improvement obtained with the

mRRR12 parameterization is expected to be. This is particularly important, since the

highest values of velocity nonlinearities, corresponding to velocity nonlinearities near

the breakpoint and in the surf zone, are expected to have a larger influence on sediment

transport than smaller values of velocity nonlinearities, i.e., velocity nonlinearities in

3.5 Conclusion

The analysis of GLOBEX data presented in this chapter was aimed at improving

current understanding of wave nonlinearities. The very gently-sloping beach of the

experiments allows a great development of the nonlinearity of the waves and the high-

resolution data collection, in time and in space, provides a high quality data set for

investigating it. A detailed data analysis, presented in the first section of this chapter,

suggested variations of free-surface elevation and velocity nonlinearities depending on

some characteristics of the wave conditions considered. Field data previously collected

reinforced the idea that particular characteristics of each wave condition (wave history)

may determine how the nonlinearity develops and the maximal values it reaches.

The SERR1D numerical model was used for simulating a wide range of wave condi-

tions, aimed at exploring the importance of different parameters in the development of

the nonlinearities. The model was validated with GLOBEX data, both for free-surface

elevation and velocity measurements. An overestimation of urms and Sku is inherent

to the model, and thus an alternative was proposed to obtain velocity time series

from the free-surface-elevation time series. Since only three different irregular wave

99



Section 3.5 Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities

conditions were available from GLOBEX data, the vN2003 data set, with different wave

conditions and beach slope, was also used to validate the model. This helped assessing

the capacity of the model to simulate a range of wave conditions beyond that of the

three irregular-wave cases of GLOBEX.

Wave conditions with different offshore wave height, peak period and spectral band-

width and beach slope were simulated for irregular-wave conditions and, for bichromatic-

wave conditions, IG-wave height was varied through the changing of the modulation of

short-wave groups. All the parameters varied were shown to contribute to more or less

significant changes of the evolution of wave nonlinearity, in particular regarding the

maximum values attained.

The analysis of the bichromatic wave conditions is brief, since the model was cal-

ibrated for the irregular-wave conditions, and thus it is for these last conditions that

it works the best. Some issues remain to be investigated further in order to allow a

better simulation of the bichromatic-wave conditions by SERR1D, such as the existence

of a short-wave reformation zone in the mid-surf zone and the presence of multiple

peaks of Sk and As. Nevertheless, it was still possible to highlight the importance of

IG waves on the nonlinearities, especially on skewness. Contrary to the irregular-wave

conditions, which have a single skewness maximum until the end of the surf zone, the

bichromatic-wave conditions reach multiple local maxima along the beach profile. Two

of these maxima (the first and the third) are associated to the first breaking and to the

short-wave reformation in the mid-surf zone. One of the other Sk? maxima (the second)

was shown to be associated with the presence of IG waves, since (i) for it to exist, a

certain degree of IG-wave modulation is necessary and (ii) this maximum corresponds

to a maximum of the correlation between short-wave variance and IG-wave velocity. It

is potentially associated with a local IG-wave height minimum, but further research is

necessary for drawing stronger conclusions.

In order to understand how important is the influence of different parameters in the

nonlinearities, the results obtained from the simulation of the irregular-wave conditions

were compared to the results of RRR12 (Ruessink et al., 2012) parameterization. This

parameterization provides an estimation of velocity nonlinearities based on local wave-

parameters only (the Ursell number). It is based on a great amount of field data, to

which it provides the best-fit, but not without a significant dispersion. When it is applied

to the results obtained for the different wave conditions simulated, it is shown that

significant errors can occur, particularly for wave conditions with certain characteristics.

From the analysis of the different wave conditions for which the parameterization gives

the largest estimation errors, it can be concluded that the offshore wave steepness, in

particular, and also the beach slope and spectral bandwidth are the three main factors

100



Chapter 3. Wave propagation and nonlinearities Section 3.5

that are linked to the nonlinearity values that have a greater deviation from the RRR12

parameterization. Therefore, a modification to the original the RRR12 parameterization

is proposed, which includes the effects of these three factors.

A modified version of the Iribarren parameter, the nonlinearity parameter (NP0), is

suggested, in order to include the dependence of the nonlinearities on offshore wave

steepness and beach slope. This parameter includes the contribution of the beach slope,

through the classical Ib0 parameter, and the increased contribution of the offshore wave

steepness, (H0/L0)
2. The maximum value of nonlinearity reached for each condition is

shown to depend, through a power law, on NP0 and ?. Therefore, both parameters

are included in the RRR12 parameterization, via p2 and p5 terms. The inclusion of

both NP0 and ? on the RRR12 parameterization results in a reduction of the RMSE

between predicted and real values estimated at around 30%, for Sku, Asu and B and

7% for ?. When only data points for which Sku &gt; 0.3 (corresponding to cross-shore

positions onshore of the outer-shoaling zone) are considered in the calculation of RMSE,

the reduction of the RMSE between predicted and real values is estimated instead at

64%, for B, and around 50% for the other three nonlinearity variables. Overall, the

greatest improvement is observed for the wave conditions with smaller offshore wave

steepness and narrower spectral bandwidth and beaches with very gentle or very steep

slopes, and for the greatest nonlinearity values (near the breakpoint).

It was clearly shown that the free-surface elevation and velocity nonlinearities cannot

be defined only based on local wave parameters. The history of the waves propagating,

including the offshore wave characteristics and the beach over which they propagate,

has to be taken into account as well, if an accurate description of the evolution of the

wave nonlinearities along the beach profile is intended.

Chapter 4

The role of infragravity waves in

the beach morphodynamics

4.1 Introduction

The existence of infragravity waves has been proven since the fifties (Munk, 1949;

Bie?sel, 1952; Longuet-Higgins &amp;amp; Stewart, 1962), mostly from field data, and since then

a panoply of field, laboratory and numerical studies have been trying to shed some more

light on the issue. Most of the research done so far on the hydrodynamics of IG waves has

focused on understanding their mechanisms of generation and reflection/dissipation at

the shoreline (e.g. Symonds et al., 1982; Schaffer, 1993; Herbers et al., 1995; Masselink,

1995; Sheremet et al., 2002; Battjes et al., 2004). More recently, research has also been

focusing on unraveling the mechanisms of energy transfer between the short waves and

the IG waves and the possibility of IG-wave breaking (e.g. Henderson et al., 2006; van

Dongeren et al., 2007; Ruju et al., 2012; Guedes et al., 2013; de Bakker et al., 2015b).

Little after the acquaintance of the existence of these low-frequency waves, the research

community started trying to understand if they could also have a significant influence

on sediment transport, and if so, by which mechanism(s) (e.g. Wright &amp;amp; Short, 1984;

Beach &amp;amp; Sternberg, 1988; Roelvink &amp;amp; Stive, 1989; Beach &amp;amp; Sternberg, 1991; Aagaard

&amp;amp; Greenwood, 1994, 1995; Ruessink et al., 1998b; Aagaard &amp;amp; Greenwood, 2008).

While the mechanisms of IG-wave generation and even dissipation are now starting

to be significantly well understood, the influence of these waves on sediment transport

is still very unclear. Whether they are capable of suspending sediment alone or only of

advecting sediment stirred by short waves or even simply influence sediment transport

by modulating short-wave nonlinearities, remains an unsolved issue. Furthermore, the

IG-wave contribution can result in both offshore- and onshore-directed fluxes depend-

ing on the relative phase between the velocity and sediment concentration (Beach

103



Section 4.1 Chapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics

&amp;amp; Sternberg, 1991). The confirmed link between these low-frequency waves and the

swash motion further adds to the complexity of the IG-wave influence on the beach

morphology and is also an ongoing topic of research (Ruju et al., 2014).

Most studies about the cross-shore sediment transport in the nearshore zone have

shown that, in the shoaling zone, the onshore-directed transport by short-waves domin-

ates the total particle flux and the IG-wave sediment transport is generally an order of

magnitude smaller (Baldock et al., 2011). Effectively, Ruessink et al. (1998a) found the

relative contribution of bound IG waves to the gross sediment transport to be small (on

average, less than 10-20%). However, near the end of the shoaling zone, these authors

considered that, since the suspended sediment transport is a delicate balance between

two components of approximately equal magnitude but opposite directions (short-wave

skewness and undertow), the small contribution of infragravity waves may sometimes

not be negligible and have a relatively large influence on the magnitude and direction of

the net suspended sediment transport. The largest sediment concentrations are present

under the bound IG-wave troughs, since it corresponds to the largest short waves, which

exert larger bed shear stresses. The transport by the bound IG waves is thus directed

offshore (Osborne &amp;amp; Greenwood, 1992b), as it is associated with the offshore stroke of

these waves. Free IG waves, on the other hand, are considered by the later authors as

unimportant under non-breaking wave conditions.

Shoreward of the breakpoint, the opinions on IG-wave sediment transport direction

diverge, and no clear model exists so far (Baldock et al., 2010). The most important

sediment transport mechanism is generally considered to be the wave-driven undertow,

although free IG-wave motion may as well be of importance, especially on dissipative

beaches (e.g. Beach &amp;amp; Sternberg, 1991; Osborne &amp;amp; Greenwood, 1992a; Aagaard &amp;amp;

Greenwood, 1994). Different authors have observed contradictory directions of sediment

transport by IG waves in this zone of the beach profile (Beach &amp;amp; Sternberg, 1988,

1991; Osborne &amp;amp; Greenwood, 1992b; Russell, 1993; Aagaard &amp;amp; Greenwood, 1995, 2008).

Short (1975) has proposed that sediment deposition will tend to occur under nodes

or anti-nodes of the IG waves and Michallet et al. (2007) have later shown partial

evidence of a nodal structure consistent with the cross-shore bar position. On the other

hand, Prel et al. (2011) have seen IG-wave motion to influence sediment transport

by modulation of the short-wave skewness and asymmetry, but they did not find bar

formation to be consistently located under nodes or anti-nodes of standing waves.

Following a different approach, Aagaard &amp;amp; Greenwood (1995) have argued that IG

waves may be important to morphological change in the surf zone by imposing spatial

gradients on sediment transport associated with mean currents: the asymmetries of

the oscillatory velocities in the bottom boundary layer associated with these waves

104



Chapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics Section 4.1

imply greater velocities and thus a net transport towards the antinodes. An alternative

scenario is an interaction between IG-wave free-surface elevation and incident wave

velocities, in which IG-wave velocity asymmetries are still required to cause a net

sediment transport towards free-surface elevation antinodes. Following these hypothesis,

Aagaard &amp;amp; Greenwood (2008) showed that, particularly in the inner-surf zone, sand is

mostly re-suspended by orbital velocities associated with incident wind waves, but it

is the IG waves that then act as a sediment transport agent through advection, in a

manner similar to quasi-steady mean currents. Hence, they can potentially dominate

the total transport of suspended sediment in this zone of the beach.

The LEGI (Laboratoire des E?coulements Ge?ophysiques et Industriels, Grenoble,

France) wave flume, a light-weight-sediment flume, has already been used for studying

the wave propagation, the effects of wave nonlinearities on sediment transport (Michallet

et al., 2011; Grasso et al., 2011) and the boundary-layer dynamics (Berni et al., 2013),

but also the influence of IG waves on sediment transport (Michallet et al., 2007; Prel

et al., 2011). Since few laboratory experiments have been done so far on the role of

infragravity waves on the sediment transport and many questions remain unanswered

regarding this topic, the aim of this chapter is to improve this knowledge, through an

important set of laboratory experiments held in the LEGI wave flume.

Long runs, with a timescale of a few hours, and short runs, with a timescale of only

two wave groups (27.2 s), were ran, for three distinct bichromatic wave conditions.

Bichromatic wave conditions have the great advantage that the height and period of

the IG-waves associated to the short-wave groups can easily be selected and controlled.

Hence, in the experiments presented in this chapter, the IG-wave height was varied,

keeping the same short-wave height and energy. Therefore, the changes in the effect of

each wave condition to the beach profile are necessarily linked, directly or indirectly, to

the differences in the IG waves considered. The analysis is done considering free-surface

elevation and velocity measurements and bed-profile changes.

The research questions motivating this chapter aim at responding to the fundamental

question of what is the influence of IG waves on sediment transport. This question can

then be detailed into more specific questions:

? Can IG waves influence the sediment transport by short-waves? By which mech-

anism(s)?

? Can IG waves work together with short-waves in the sediment transport, combining

different transport mechanisms?

? Can free IG waves alone (without the presence of short waves) promote sediment

transport?

105



Section 4.2 Chapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics

? What is the importance of the IG waves for the sediment transport in the different

zones of the beach profile?

? Can IG waves influence the shape of equilibrium profiles?

This chapter starts by an instruments and methods section, where the experimental

facility and wave conditions are described and the different types of measurements

performed during the experiments are presented and their applications and limitations

are discussed. In the subsequent section, the concept of equilibrium beach profile and

evolution towards equilibrium are discussed for the different wave conditions. Since

a distinct equilibrium profile is observed for each wave condition, a more thorough

analysis of the morphodynamics associated to each wave condition is performed in

the ensuing section, where runs of only two wave groups are considered to simplify

the research of the various processes influencing sediment transport. An analysis of

the hydrodynamics, taking into account both free-surface elevation and cross-shore

velocity, is then carried out to explain the disparity in the morphological evolution

between wave conditions. The SERR1D model, previously presented in chapter 3, is

used to obtain velocity measurements around the breakpoint and in the surf zone, where

accurate velocity measurements are difficult to get with the acoustic instruments. The

influence of monochromatic IG waves in the sediment transport is briefly debated and

subsequently the different mechanisms shown to be involved in the sediment transport

by the IG waves are examined in the discussion section. The chapter ends with a

conclusion.

4.2 Instruments and methods

4.2.1 The LEGI wave flume

The LEGI flume, presented in Fig. 4.1a, is a 36 m-long and 0.55 m-wide wave flume,

with vertical glass walls and equipped with a piston-type wave-maker. This wave-maker,

as shown in Fig. 4.1b, consists in a vertical board driven by a servo-valve, which can

reach a maximum displacement of ±30 cm along the horizontal direction and allows
the reproduction of regular or irregular waves. Although it can generate short and IG

waves, the wave-maker is not capable of active reflection compensation, meaning that

any IG waves generated in the flume that reach the wave-maker will be reflected back,

enhancing standing or partially-standing IG waves that oscillate in the flume until they

dissipate.

The laboratory beach, represented in Fig. 4.2 scheme, is formed by Polymethyl

Methacrylate (also known as Plexiglas) low-density (?s = 1.19 g cm

Accoustic Doppler Velocimeter - ADV Nortek Vectrino +, Fig. 4.3b, and an Accoustic

Doppler Velocity Profiler - ADVP) and the bed profile (in the beginning and end of each

run, with an optical profiler) were made. The wave gauges were moved to convenient

locations depending on the run. The ADV was also moved both cross-shore (from run

to run) and in the vertical (for 5-20 min intervals during some of the runs) to have a

morphological features.

The LEGI flume is designed to reproduce natural beach profiles and their morpho-

logical changes. The physics and hydraulics of movable bed models depend on the

wave parameters (significant wave height Hs and peak period Tp), sediment parameters

(sediment diameter d and density of the sediment ?s) the water depth h, the fluid

density ?, the fluid kinematic viscosity ? and the gravity g (Grasso et al., 2009a). These

variables must be correctly scaled to their nature equivalents to allow the truthful

representation of the fundamental processes aimed to be characterized. Since it is

very difficult to scale the eight independent parameters mentioned, the choice of the

parameters to scale is done based on the principal processes that are aimed at being

simulated by the physical model.

The Froude scaling is essential in physical models that involve waves (Dean &amp;amp;

Dalrymple, 2002) and can be written as

F =
Hs?p

2
?
gh
, (4.1)

where ?p = 2?/Tp is the angular frequency. Since wave dynamics, shoaling, breaking

and turbulence generation by the waves must be modelled correctly, an undistorted

model is chosen. Therefore, a single length scale ?l is chosen (?i is the ratio of the

model value to the prototype value of parameter i). Respecting the Froude similitude

between nature and the model implies that the time scale, ?t =

Chapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics Section 4.2

has shown that choosing a length scale of 1/10 relative to nature (which implies a time

scale of 1/3 and thus a velocity scale of 1/3) allows the reproduction of beach profiles

that can be found on real beaches with sediments with a median diameter of 0.3 mm.

the threshold for setting the sediment in motion and the transport regime (bed load,

places all the beach profiles obtained in the intermediate range of Wright &amp;amp; Short (1984)

classification (presented in chapter 2). These profiles are characterized by beaches

with a moderate mean slope and spilling or plunging breakers and can have bar-trough

systems, rhythmic bars and terraces.

LEGI wave flume and compared it to natural beaches that also have intermediate profile

types. They have found the overall beach hydrodynamics and morphodynamics to be

correctly reproduced by fulfilling the three scalings mentioned.

4.2.2 Wave conditions

The main aim of the experiments held in the flume was to understand the importance

of infragravity waves on sediment transport. Bichromatic waves were chosen instead

of irregular waves (which would be more similar to nature) so that only two different

sinusoidal wave components are generated by the wave-maker, together with the lower

frequency of the bound wave resulting from the difference interaction between the two

main components. As the waves propagate and evolve along the flume, it is thus easier

to track the developing of higher and lower harmonics, as they tend to be multiples of

the main frequencies f1 and f2, or of the bound IG wave frequency, f2 ?f1. Baldock
et al. (2011) have previously shown that a given bichromatic-wave condition with the

same short-wave energy of a given irregular-wave condition is capable of generating

a similar sediment transport. Therefore, in this work, bichromatic-wave conditions

are used instead of irregular-wave conditions in the study of the effect of IG waves in

the sediment transport. This greatly simplifies the processes to be studied, due to the

regularity and repeatability of the waves propagating and makes it easier to control the

IG frequencies present in the flume.

At the first order, the free-surface elevation for bichromatic waves can be analytically

calculated as it follows,

? (x,t) = A1 cos (w1t?k1x) + A2 cos (w2t?k2x) , (4.7)

where A is the wave amplitude (= H/2), k the wave number, ? the angular frequency

and x and t the time and space coordinates, respectively. The indexes 1 and 2 represent

each main frequency.

The theoretical solution for the wave-maker displacement was computed according

to Hughes (1993) and included second-order compensating generation to correctly

reproduce the bound IG wave.

Three different bichromatic wave conditions with the same short-wave energy were

designed: C1 (first-order solution with addition of free IG waves of opposite sign

to that of the bound IG waves), C2 (standard condition) and C3 (smaller IG-wave

amplitude than C2). For the three, short-wave Hs = 14.8 cm and Tp = 1.7 s and the

two main frequencies were f1 = 0.5515 Hz and f2 = 0.6250 Hz (TIG or Tg = 13.6 s).

The frequencies were chosen so that fp =
f1+f2

were composed by successive pairs of two wave groups (which had slightly different

short-waves between them). C1 and C2 had a maximum modulation, with a1 and a2

of 0.03 m, while C3 had smaller modulation, with a1 = 0.0413 and a2 = 0.01 m. The

difference between C1 and C2 was subtler and linked to the generation process. In the

case of C2, the IG wave reproduced by the wave-maker corresponded to the second-order

bound wave computed and expected to develop as the waves start propagating. Forcing

this IG wave in the theoretical solution ensures that it establishes correctly in the flume

as the waves propagate. For C1, this IG wave was generated by the wave-maker in the

direction opposite to that of wave propagation. Since an IG bound wave still develops

anyway as the wave groups propagate, the IG wave that was artificially generated with

an opposite direction of propagation behaves as an additional free-wave propagating

in the flume, with a phase relative to the wave group that is distinct from that of the

bound wave. This results in both additional IG-wave energy and a different IG phasing

from that of C2.

Fig. 4.4 helps understand the differences between the wave conditions. At x = 9 m,

the main differences between C1 and C2 are in terms of IG-wave phasing. The spectral

peak corresponding to the bound IG waves (f2 ?f1) has roughly the same energy for
both conditions (for C2, it has 1.5 times more energy than for C1). However, at the

end of shoaling, IG waves have an energy about 4 times greater for C1 than C2. For

the first harmonic of the bound IG wave (2 (f2 ?f1)), C1 also has higher energy than
C2 and C3. C3 bound IG waves have, for both cross-shore positions, energy one order

of magnitude smaller than C1 and C2, which can also be seen in the time series as a

much smaller bound IG wave. C3 has also less energy on harmonics of f2 frequency

than the other two conditions.

The duration of the wave-maker action was variable, ranging from only two short-

wave groups (about 27.2 s) to longer runs of over 5 h. Apart from C1, C2 and C3, some

runs were also made with free IG-waves only, with the same height and period of the

bound IG waves of C2, or multiples of that height.

4.2.3 Free-surface elevation measurements

Free-surface elevation measurements were made using 12 capacitive wave gauges

positioned along the cross-shore profile. The wave gauges have a precision of 1 mm and

a sampling rate of 128 Hz and were calibrated regularly (for details on the calibration,

see Grasso (2009)). Depending on the runs, the wave gauges were moved to different

positions, in order to get a better coverage of the region of interest. The cut-off between

high and low frequencies is considered at half the peak frequency, which corresponds to

the minimum of the variance density spectrum of ? measured at the wave gauge closest

to the wave-maker (x = 2.01 m). It separates the range of frequencies that initially

have more energy and will tend to loose energy as the waves propagate towards the

coast, from the range of frequencies that initially have less energy and will gain energy

closer to the coast.

The wave gauge measurements allow the characterization of the hydrodynamics

associated with each beach profile. Different wave statistics can be computed, such

as the root-mean-square wave height (3.1), for short and infragravity waves, skewness

(3.8), asymmetry (3.9), energy dissipation (3.3) or mean water level (??) to evaluate the

set-up and the set-down. The wave statistics corresponding to each beach profile are

computed on a pair number of wave groups, which, for the short runs, corresponds to

two wave groups only, and for the long runs depends on the aim for which the statistics

are being calculated.

Resonant modes

Since the wave-maker of the LEGI-flume is not equipped with active reflection

compensation, the free IG waves that reflect at the beach are “trapped” in the flume,

creating stationary IG waves and increasing the low-frequency energy present in the

flume. This implies that the IG-wave height may be near zero for the cross-shore

locations coincident with standing-wave nodes, or maximal, at locations coincident with

the antinodes.

and the frequencies (vs periods) of the first-four resonant modes of the flume and the bound IG-wave
frequency/period (filled green circle). On the bottom: the cross-shore structure of the first-four
resonant modes.

For each beach profile, the theoretic resonant modes of the IG waves can be

calculated to help explaining the minima and maxima of IG-wave height measured by

the wave gauges. Small differences in the shoreline position can influence the distribution

of the nodes and antinodes along the beach profile. Fig. 4.5 shows the first four normal

modes that may be forced for C1, C2 and C3 equilibrium profiles, and their frequencies

(and periods). The second normal mode has a period very close to the period of the

short-wave groups (Tg) and thus of the bound IG wave. Therefore, since the IG-wave

motion in the flume is preferentially forced at this period, the second normal mode

(f = 0.05-0.085 Hz) is the most enhanced. This is depicted in Fig. 4.6, where the

Hrms of the IG waves is represented for the frequency bands that include the first six

normal modes. The wave height of the frequency band corresponding to the second

normal mode is almost equivalent to the total IG-wave height. The fourth mode has

some relevance in the surf and swash zones, but all the other modes have negligible

contributions to the total IG-wave height. This is the case for all the three equilibria.

The greatest difference between conditions consists in the IG-wave height evolution in

the shoaling zone: for C1, the maximum IG-wave height is reached just before the slope

break of the beach profile (around x = 21 m), and for C2, this maximum is located at

the beginning of the steepening of the beach slope in the shoaling zone (around x = 15

m). For C3, the total IG-wave height is significantly smaller than for C1 and C2 and

the maximum of the shoaling zone is reached around x = 18 m, where a small “bump”

can be seen in the equilibrium profile of C1.

Swash-zone wave gauges

The swash zone is the highest zone of the profile where wave gauges were positioned.

Since this zone is intermittently covered by water, free-surface elevation can only be

retrieved when the wave gauges are immersed. However, even when the water retreats,

the bed is fully saturated and thus these gauges detect the bed position, which can be

used to track the evolution of the beachface position along the runs. This is depicted in

Fig. 4.7, where the black lines represent moments of emersion and thus the position of

the bed. This allows the quantification of bed-level variation (red crosses in Fig. 4.7)

between swash events and the duration of the events (the central point of each black

line is considered to calculate the bed-level variation). These are the only measurements

of the bed position available during wave action, since the bed profiling of the entire

beach can only be done before or after each wave condition is ran, as the water surface

Chapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics Section 4.2

needs to be completely still. The detection of the bed-position in the time series of the

swash wave gauges was done following the method of Turner et al. (2008).

The detection of the bed position in the swash zone can also be used to track the

effect of the residual IG waves (at the end of the runs) on the beach. Even though the

short-runs consisted in only two wave groups to avoid the effects of IG-waves reflected

at the wave-maker, after the arrival of the wave groups to the beach, residual IG waves

keep oscillating in the flume until their energy if fully dissipated. It is thus important

to be sure that these residual waves are not significantly morphogenic, as this could

bias the interpretation of the results.

Fig. 4.8 shows a zoom of the minimum level of the free-surface elevation at two

swash-zone wave gauges (positioned at x = 24.45 m and x = 23.89 m) for a C2 run with

a duration of two wave groups. Since the bed is fully saturated in the highest zones of

the beach and the lower and flatter sections of the curves correspond to moments when

there is no water, they represent the bed position, similarly to the black flatter sections

in Fig. 4.7 (which shows an experiment with a duration of more than two wave groups).

For the wave gauge located higher on the beach (x = 24.45 m), bed changes are very

small (of the order of 1 mm), whether they are provoked by the passage of the two

wave groups or the residual IG waves. Therefore, in both cases, the waves are hardly

morphogenic. However, for the other gauge lower in the beach (x = 23.89 m), just at

the limit of the swash zone, changes are more significant. The first and the second wave

groups promote the greatest erosion observed during the runs. This erosion is of about

8 mm, for the first wave group, and 2.5 mm, for the second one. The following cycles of

residual IG waves (together with some small residual short waves) account for changes

an order of magnitude smaller, of around 1 mm. Even though the absolute values of bed

change may vary a lot depending on the bed profile for each wave condition, the orders

of magnitude are comparable between experiments. Independently of the experiment

considered, even though residual IG waves may be weakly morphogenic, the bed change

they promote is much smaller than that promoted by the two wave groups and can

thus be disregarded.

Section 4.2 Chapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics

4.2.4 Bed profiles

Before or after each run, the beach-profile position was measured with an optical

laser beam (with a sampling frequency of 50 Hz) installed on a motorized trolley that

moved at an almost constant velocity (100 mm s-1) on the metallic rails that run over

each side of the flume. As the trolley moves, the laser beam is emitted towards the

bed and its reflection is retrieved by a receptor located next to the laser source. If

there are suspended particles in the water column, the laser beam is reflected in those

particles and does not reach the bed, which results in erroneous measurements of the

bed position. In order to overcome this limitation, a correction procedure is applied.

The raw measurements of the beach profile are obtained in terms of voltage (Fig. 4.9

A). Then, they are converted to meters, multiplying by a calibration value (Fig. 4.9 B).

The initial (xi = 6.5 m) and final (xf = 29 m) positions for the profile measurement

are defined before the trolley is set in motion, but, since it does not move at exactly

the same velocity along the entire flume, the trolley usually stops some centimeters

before its defined final position. Therefore, after converting the measurements from

volts to meters, a correction to the final position is done for having all profiles with

matching xi and xf . Afterwards, the profile is de-spiked (red profile, Fig. 4.9 C) to

reduce the number of erroneous points obtained by reflection of the laser beam at the

surface or along the water column. Then, since the bars over which the trolley moves

are not completely horizontal, the bed position is corrected (red to green profile in Fig.

4.9 D) to eliminate this error. Moreover, the laser beam is refracted as it traverses

the air-water interface and hence, a re-scaling of the profile is done (green to magenta

profile in Fig. 4.9 D). Finally, since the de-spiking process is not 100 % efficient for all

the profiles measured, for each profile done from xi to xf , pA (magenta profile in Fig.

4.9 E), another profile is done just after it, from xf to xi, pB (purple profile in Fig. 4.9

E). When a spike is present at a given cross-shore position for one of the profiles, the

value of the other profile at that cross-shore position is considered instead. When this

correction if done for both pA and pB profiles, the average of both profiles is done and

considered as the final profile, p (Fig. 4.9 F).

Profiles were measured between xi = 6.5 m and xf = 29 m (total profile length,

lp = (xf ? xi) = 22.5 m), along the centre of the flume. However, since the part of
the profile that is permanently emerged does not change along the runs, xf is often

considered in the analysis at 26 m, for convenience. Depending on the analysis wanted

and when no significant change is measured for the greatest depths, xi is considered

further onshore than 6.5 m. The profile measurements made were re-sampled so that

the vertical position of the bed is retrieved each millimeter, on the cross-shore direction.

Even though the correction procedure aims at minimizing the errors inherent to the

measurement of the bed position, it is not perfect. Not all the profile measurement

spikes are completely corrected, especially when at the same location a spike is present

for both pA and pB. Also, when the water is less clean, light transmission may change

across the water column. The water was clean regularly but the growth of organic

matter was dependent on environmental conditions (light, temperature, particles in

the water, etc) and thus it was hard to have always the same water quality along the

experiments that were performed during more than two years. As it can be seen in Fig.

4.9 C, for cross-shore positions closer to the wave-maker than x ? 15 m, larger errors
associated to the profile measurements. This happens in part due to the higher water

column (that can have more suspended particles) and to changes in the transmissivity

of the water due to the presence of impurities. Also, from the wave-maker until x ?
8.5 m, the bed of the flume (made of glass) is not covered by sediments, which also

contributes to measurement errors. The beach morphodynamics below x = 15 m is

not analysed in this work and is hence excluded from the profile measurement-error

quantification.

In order to quantify the uncertainty of the bed profile measurements resulting from

the mentioned factors, the bed profile measurement uncertainty (MU) averaged along

the length of the beach profile (starting at x = 15 m), MUhm, and the mean relative

error, MUhrel, are calculated for each beach profile and shown in Fig. 4.10.

MUhm =

and

MUhrel =

?N

where the indexes A and B correspond to profiles pA and pB, respectively, n is the

index of the cross-shore point considered, varying from 1 (corresponding to xi = 15 m)

to N (corresponding to xi = 26 m) and |.| denotes the absolute value.
Averaging MUhm and MUhrel over the entire set of experiments, results in a value

that can be considered as the measurement uncertainty associated to the bed position

measurement for any measured profile. Thus, each bed position measurement has an

uncertainty of ±2.1 mm, corresponding to a relative error of ±1.0%. The measurement
uncertainty is, however, dependent on the cross-shore position considered. As it was

mentioned, in deeper water larger errors are associated to the bed position retrieved by

the laser beam, due to the highest probability of the laser being reflected at particles in

suspension or due to the water quality. Therefore, the further inshore xi is considered

for a given analysis, the smaller the measurement uncertainty. This is illustrated by

the difference between the blue circles and the red asterisks in Fig. 4.10: only by

Figure 4.10: MUhm and MUhrel calculated for each beach profile measured during the entire set
of experiments, considering the start of the profile at xi = 15 m (blue circles) and xi = 20 m (red
asteriks).

considering xi = 20 m instead of 15 m, the measurement uncertainty if reduced to ±1.8
mm and the relative error to ±0.4% and the number of MUhm and MUhrel outliers is
significantly smaller. A very similar laser-profiling system was recently proposed by

Atkinson &amp;amp; Baldock (2016), which also measures with high resolution the subaerial and

subaqueous areas of the beach profile.

Different useful quantities can be deduced from the measurements of the bed position

that contribute to the understanding of the change of the beach profile after each

experiment. Knowing the flume width (L = 0.55 m), the sediment height (hs) and

the length (lp) of a given profile, and assuming no cross-flume variation, the sediment

volume (V ) can be calculated,

V = L

? lp

hs(x)dx. (4.10)

Then, the sediment-volume change resulting from one experimental run can simply be

calculated from the difference between the sediment volumes of the initial (Vi) and final

(Vf ) profiles.

The sediment transport rate (Qs) can be deduced from the variation of the profile

elevation between two consecutive profiles measured before and after a given run, taking

into account the equation of sediment mass conservation (?Qs
?x

= (1 ? p)?h
?t

, where p

represents the porosity of the sediment, estimated in about 0.5 in the flume and ?t the

A correction of the profile volume due to potential variations of porosity or compaction

Qs is zero at both ends of the beach profile. Qs thus represents a volume of sediment

displaced per width unit and time unit and a bulk sediment transport (qs) can be

obtained, for each experimental run, by multiplying Qs by the duration of the wave

condition (?t). The positive (negative) values of Qs (and of qs) indicate net onshore

(offshore) sediment transport. Fig. 4.11 shows an example of the results obtained for

the variation of bed position and bulk sediment transport during one run, between two

beach profiles.

A limitation of the bed-profiling technique is that the bed position can only be

measured before and after each experiment. However, it was visually observed that

the bed position measured during the experiment is not exactly the same. The real

bed position during wave motion is found to be deeper than the position measured by

the bed profiler since a certain layer of the bed is put in suspension during the runs.

cm lower than the bed position measured after the runs. This bed mobilization near

the breakpoint is illustrated in Fig. 4.12.

Fig. 4.13 shows an estimation of the top and bottom limits of the mobile layer

around the breakpoint during a C1 run, from where it can be seen that the lower

limit of the mobile layer is significantly below the bed position measured by the laser

profiler before the start/end of the run. However, these are visual observations which

are difficult to precise, in particular because the position of the top and bottom limits

of the mobile layer also change during the run. Fig. 4.14 illustrates this change, at two

different cross-shore positions, during two different time intervals of C1 runs. Periodic

oscillations are obvious for both time intervals and cross-shore positions considered.

Along these oscillations, the thickness of the mobile layer is variable.

4.2.5 Velocity measurements

Velocity measurements considered herein for analysis were done at different cross-

shore and vertical positions, using a side-looking ADV with a sampling rate of 128 Hz.

Measurements along the cross-shore, alongshore and vertical directions were obtained,

but the velocity analysis presented herein focuses on the cross-shore velocity. Several

parameters can be retrieved from these measurements, such as the mean (um) or root-

mean-square (urms) velocities and velocity skewness (Sku) and asymmetry (Asu).

Obtaining reliable measurements with an ADV requires some care. Measurements

can become noisy both due to emersion of the four beams of the ADV or due to

strong sediment-suspension events. In order to distinguish both sources of noise, a joint

analysis with a collocated wave gauge must be done. When the wave gauges measure a

zero water level, the noise in the velocity measurements is easily linked to the emersion

of the ADV. The greatest problem is posed by the episodes of high concentration of

suspended sediment in the water, which are more difficult to track. Since this issue is a

necessary drawback of acoustic instruments, it is essential to know where exactly clean

velocity measurements can be obtained.

The cross-shore positions at which it is possible to obtain measurements of velocity

with no noise during the full time series depend on the beach-profile shape and range

from about x = 21.5 m to x = 24 m. For the vertical position of the ADV, a limit of

about 3 cm height above the bottom is mandatory to avoid measurement noise and the

ADV has to be placed at a minimum distance of 3 cm from the free-surface at rest, to

insure that at least the two lower beams of the probe are immersed during the entire

duration of the runs. These limits must however be considered together with visual

observation during the experiments, since for some particular positions (such as near

the breakpoint) sediment suspension may be high, not allowing good measurements

122



Chapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics Section 4.2

even within the mentioned limits. When isolated spikes were present along the time

series, they were corrected using both a de-spiking method by Mori et al. (2007) and

a low-frequency pass filter at 2 Hz. Fig. 4.15 shows the example of some raw (light

green) and de-spiked (green) measurements at distinct cross-positions which shows the

noise-level differences between cross-shore positions.

The noise in the velocity measurements due to reflection of the acoustic signal in the

sediment particles can be a problem when the aim is to obtain good-quality accurate

velocity measurements. However, it can also be an advantage.

During the experiments, no instruments capable of directly measuring sediment

concentration were available. While the total sediment transport per wave condition

is calculated from the changes of the bed position measured and the beachface bed

position can be inferred from the swash-zone wave gauges, the sediment suspended

during wave action cannot be measured. As it will be referred later in this chapter,

it is important to track the episodes of larger sediment suspension and, especially,

their phasing relatively to the wave groups. For this purpose, the noise in the velocity

Section 4.2 Chapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics

measurements becomes an advantage. When the water is sufficiently high to prevent

the emersion of the ADV sensor, which was always the case when it was positioned

offshore of the swash zone, all the noise in the velocity measurements is directly linked

to the presence of sediment in the water column at the sensor height. Hence, the ADV

measurements can give an indication of at which cross-shore positions there is more

sediment suspension, at which height from the bottom and during which interval of

the wave groups. For example, Fig. 4.15 illustrates high sediment suspension at the

end of each short-wave group, at x = 21.65 m (second plot), which is the approximate

cross-shore position of the bar/breakpoint at the time of the measurements. Significant

sediment suspension also occurs just after breaking, at x = 22.16 m (third plot), but it

is weaker.

The episodes of larger sediment suspension inferred from the velocity measurements

were also confirmed by visual observation during the experiments. The side-walls of the

LEGI wave flume are made of glass, which allows the direct observation (or filming) of

the sediment suspension events during wave action, as it is shown in Fig. 4.16.

Figure 4.16: Examples of sediment suspension observed in different zones of the beach profile (photos
by Cyril Fresillon - CNRS photothe?que).

SERR1D contribution

The cross-shore positions where the flow-velocity measurements are more important

are those near the breakpoint and in the surf zone. This is where high sediment-transport

rates are expected to occur. However, as it was discussed before, these are also the

positions where velocity measurements are more difficult to obtain and more noisy. In

order to overcome this limitation, the SERR1D model (described in chapter 3) can be

used to obtain an estimation of the cross-shore velocity for the different wave conditions

simulated.

For all the three wave conditions, clean velocity measurements were available at x

= 20.4 m, the end of the shoaling zone. Since at this position there were collocated

measurements of free-surface elevation and velocity, the measured free-surface elevation

time series can be retrieved from the wave gauges and the reflected IG waves can be

extracted from the total signal (following the method of Guza et al. (1984) described in

124



Chapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics Section 4.2

chapter 3). This time series is a more precise representation of the waves present in

the flume at the end of the shoaling zone (already including reflected IG waves) than

the theoretical solution that is provided at the wave-maker (which does not include

reflected IG waves) and thus it is used as the input wave condition for SERR1D.

The SERR1D numerical model, as it is applied in this work, does not have a

morphodynamics module. Therefore, the bottom position is defined as constant along

each run, which is not true in reality (especially near the breakpoint) and further

implies that a real bottom-friction coefficient is not constant (both in space or in time).

However, the model does not consider a mobile bed and the friction coefficient is set,

for the simulations presented in this section, to 0.002. The values of the breaking-model

parameters are the same as ones discussed in chapter 3.

C2 was initially used for model validation. Fig. 4.17 shows the comparison of

free-surface elevation and velocity experimental and numerical data obtained for a

model simulation of two wave groups of C2 wave condition and also illustrates the

uncertainty related to the bed position.

In a general way, taking into account the limitations mentioned, the model is capable

of representing both the free-surface elevation and the cross-shore velocity of short-waves.

However, it underestimates IG waves, particularly in the inner-surf and swash zones.

IG-waves reflected at the wave-maker are already present at the end of the second

wave group for cross-shore positions close to the coast. This results in an increase of

IG-wave height near the coast that the model partially reproduces.

The bed position measured at the end of each experiment is not exactly the bed

position over which the waves act, since a certain layer of the bed is put in suspension

during the runs: the real bed position during motion is found to be deeper than the

position measured by the bed profiler. This contributes to small differences between

measured and simulated data, particularly near the breakpoint, which is a zone of great

bed mobilization during the runs. These differences are illustrated in Fig. 4.17, between

the darker and lighter markers.

Fig. 4.18 shows the times series of model and experimental data for several cross-

shore positions. As it was already stated, the model does very well in the shoaling and

outer-surf zone, representing even the correct phasing of the waves along the groups.

However, in the inner-surf and swash zones, there is an IG-wave height difference

between numerical and experimental data (particularly at the end of the second wave

group), which promotes shallower short-wave troughs (and thus less negative velocities)

at the trough of the IG wave, for the numerical data. Nevertheless, the phasing of each

wave remains very good along the beach profile, even for velocity.

Besides the limitations already mentioned, there is also the difficulty in validating

measurements made during runs of C2 are plotted, which illustrates the dispersion in

measurements were made at a given vertical position in the water column and SERR1D

model provides velocity results integrated over the entire water column, which induces

differences between experimental and numerical results, as was already discussed in

chapter 3. The limitations of the velocity measurements make it unavoidable to trust

completely the free-surface elevation data for validating the model near the breakpoint.

Fig. 4.19 represents the results of the simulation of C1 and C3. For C1, which has even

greater IG-wave heights in this zone than C2, the underestimation is more significant;

for C3, which has smaller IG-waves heights, the model is capable of estimating almost

correctly the measured data, with a small overestimation of skewness and asymmetry.

Overall, SERR1D represents the main free-surface elevation trends sufficiently well

(and urms, for C2) and can thus provide an estimation of the cross-shore velocity for

the different wave conditions, even if only in a qualitatively (and comparative between

conditions) way.

4.3 Beach evolution towards equilibrium

When the same wave condition is run for long enough, an equilibrium profile is

attained. This means that the different transport mechanisms at play start balancing

each other at some point in time and the profile shape stops evolving. The time needed

for this to happen depends on how different is the initial profile from the equilibrium

profile.

128



Chapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics Section 4.3

Fig. 4.20 depicts the equilibrium beach profiles obtained for each wave condition.

According to Grasso et al. (2009a), the shape of the equilibrium profile depends only

on the Dean number and thus on significant wave height and peak period and the

sediment settling velocity. However, Fig. 4.20 shows that, even though C1, C2 and C3

have the same Hs, Tp and sediment particles, the equilibrium beach-profile shape is

different, particularly in the shallower zones (namely, in the beachface). At first sight,

four features mark the main differences between the equilibrium profiles: the beach

slope, the depth of the surf zone, the width of the emerged beach and the presence (or

absence) of a bar. C3 has shallower surf and swash zones and a larger emerged beach,

while for C1 the shallowest zones of the beach profile have greater water depth and the

sediment is instead accumulated in deeper waters, around x = 18.5 m. The C2 surf

and swash zones are deeper than for C3 and shallower than for C1. The C2 equilibrium

profile is the only one with a marked bar separating the shoaling and the surf zones.

For depths greater than x = 16 m, the beach profiles are very similar for the three wave

conditions.

Fig. 4.21 presents the wave statistics obtained for each wave condition during the

equilibrium runs. The major disparity that can be observed between wave conditions is

the IG-wave height, which is especially smaller for C3 wave condition along the entire

beach profile, and smaller for C2 than for C1 around x = 21 m. Furthermore, the bar

(C2) and slope break (C1 and C3) are located at a cross-shore position of minimum

IG-wave height. This minimum is located at the central nodal point of the prevailing

free-surface elevation standing pattern (mode 2, as seen in Figs. 4.5 and 4.6) and is

located slightly further offshore for C2 than C1, and even more for C3 (as predicted

for the second theoretic resonant mode of each wave condition in Fig. 4.5). Both

factors, that (i) IG-wave height is the largest difference in wave statistics between wave

conditions and that (ii) an important feature of the beach profile (the bar or the slope

gauge located in the swash zone (at less than 20 cm of the still-water shoreline position),

following the method previously described in the subsection 4.2.3. Even though for the

three wave conditions the measurements represented correspond to equilibrium runs,

the beachface bed position is not constant for all. For C3 the bed position measured

is effectively the same along the entire run, except for very small variations of a few

millimeters. For C2, some variations of about 0.5 cm are present but tend to disappear

during the run. However, for C1, even though the mean bed position remains constant

(around 2.8 cm above the mean water level, for the example of Fig. 4.22), there are

periodic variations (of up to 1 cm height) with a timescale of about 18 min (which will

be called “oscillations” in the rest of this manuscript). As C1 is the wave condition

with the greatest IG waves, once again a link between IG-waves and the beach profile

shape (in this case, the height of the beachface) is suggested.

Fig. 4.23 shows the evolution in time of the IG-wave height along the beach profile,

for the C1 equilibrium run whose beachface bed-position variation was presented in

de top plot of Fig. 4.22. Like for the beachface bed position, an oscillation of around

18 min can also be seen in the IG-wave height in different regions of the beach profile.

Maxima (in time) of the bed-elevation near the shoreline (around x = 24.6 m, for C1

equilibrium run) are associated to maxima (in time) of IG-wave height at the same

locations, in the surf and swash zones, and in deeper waters. The cross-shore position

bar/slope-break position) varies in the cross-shore direction in around 1 m (between

x ? 21.9 m and x ? 22.9 m), also responding to the 18-min oscillations.
Since (i) for C1 (greater IG waves near the shore) there are marked oscillations of

the beachface bed position, while for C3 (much smaller IG waves than C1 and C2) only

minor variations are observed during the equilibrium run and (ii) the oscillation of the

beachface bed position is coupled to the oscillation of IG-wave amplitude, there must be

an implicit link between the oscillations of the beachface bed position and the action of

the IG waves (or wave groups). However, the beachface bed-position oscillations have a

long period of 18 min, too long for being only of the timescale of hydrodynamic forcings

(which are expected to be of the order of a few minutes). Therefore, even though an

implicit link between the oscillations of the beachface bed position and the IG waves

seems to exist, the IG-waves cannot be the sole responsible agent: there must exist a

morphodynamic feedback, linked to the IG-wave motion, that also plays a role in the

dynamics of the oscillations.

Fig. 4.24 shows the sediment transport patterns of five C1 20-min runs for which

the oscillation of the beachface is particularly noteworthy. These are runs with a

shorter duration than the equilibrium runs and with a beach profile still far from

the equilibrium profile, but which mimic the behaviour of the beachface during C1

between the oscillations of the beachface and the oscillations of the surf and inner-

shoaling zones, already observed in Fig. 4.23 for the IG-wave height. When the upper

beach is eroded (accreted), accretion (erosion) dominates the surf and lower swash

zones, smoothing (sharpening) the bar and erosion (accretion) also occurs at the end

of the shoaling zone. This dynamics is associated with an onshore (offshore) sediment

transport until the mid-surf zone, and an offshore (onshore) sediment transport further

up the beach. In the outer-shoaling zone and in deeper waters, sediment transport is

less linked with the dynamics of the upper profile, responding to sediment transport

processes of longer time scale.

Fig. 4.25 shows the IG free-surface elevation and velocity evolution along a C1

equilibrium run, for a single cross-shore position located at the end of the shoaling zone

(x = 21.9 m). During this long run, input wave conditions at the wave-maker remained

constant. Nonetheless, since the IG waves that are generated by the wave-maker at

every instant are added to the ones that remained in the flume since the beginning of

the run, the phase of the IG waves changes along the run. At this cross-shore position

(which is close to an IG free-surface-elevation minimum), the oscillation (the periodic

oscillation of 18 min mentioned before) of the phase of the incident IG waves (??inc) is

approximately in anti-phase to the oscillation of the reflected IG-wave phase (??ref ): as

??inc increases, ??ref decreases, which results in weak oscillations of the total IG-waves

phase along the run. These oscillations of the incident and reflected IG-waves phases

results in oscillations of the incident (Hrms,IGinc) and reflected (Hrms,IGref ) IG-waves

heights. These can be in phase or not with the oscillations of ??inc, depending on the

cross-shore position considered. Since Hrms,IGinc and Hrms,IGref vary, the total IG-wave

height also varies with the same 18-min period. The signature of these oscillations is

present as well in the velocity data, particularly near velocity maxima positions (such

as the cross-shore position considered in Fig. 4.25, where high velocities are expected

and thus variations are more notorious). Greater IG-wave velocity is observed close

to the maximal ??inc values and minima Hrms,IG. Skewness and asymmetry are also

affected by the changing of the IG-wave phase.

The variation of the absolute values of all these hydrodynamic variables along the

C1 equilibrium run is linked to the oscillations of the beachface previously mentioned,

which are in turn linked to the dynamics of the entire profile. The changing of the

beachface slope and associated change in the surf-zone morphology can, in turn, be

influencing the hydrodynamics. Slow accretion of the beachface, when IG-wave height

is minimal, results in a more reflective beachface, which contributes to a more energetic

swash dynamics and to greater IG-wave reflection, thus promoting IG-wave growth.

The accretion of the beachface is accompanied by an accretion just offshore of the

134



Chapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics Section 4.4

breakpoint and by the delineation of a better-defined bar (due to the transport of

sediment from the surf zone to the beachface), which eventually shifts the location of

short-wave energy dissipation from the lower beachface to the surf zone. This results

in a less energetic swash zone and a less reflective beachface, which promotes IG-wave

height decrease. When an IG-wave minimum height is reached, the slow accretion of

the beachface can start again and so on.

Since several mechanisms are constantly at play along the beach profiles, a static

equilibrium (for which the beach profile remains always at the same position) is hard

to attain, particularly if one or more mechanisms are periodically enhanced. Instead, a

dynamic equilibrium is more likely, with multiple slightly-different profiles oscillating

around a certain profile shape. In the flume, the oscillations of the beach profile around

an equilibrium shape are enhanced by the presence of the “trapped” IG waves that

reflect at the beach and re-reflect at the wave-maker, generating standing modes that

are only dissipated after the end of each run. This effect is particularly important for

C1, since it has greater IG waves.

The equilibrium profiles reached by several long runs of C1, C2 or C3 wave conditions

are not the same that would be attained if only a few short-wave groups were run with

the same wave conditions, run by run, until equilibrium, since long runs allow steady

IG standing-wave patterns to establish and be enhanced, contrary to very-short runs.

4.4 Beach response to wave groups

The multiple feedbacks between the hydrodynamics and the morphology make it

difficult to further dissect the dynamics of the oscillations observed during the long

equilibrium runs. Therefore, two wave-group runs were conceived to allow the analysis

of the effect of each wave condition on the beach profile without the influence of IG

waves artificially added and enhanced by re-reflection at the wave-maker. This results

in a more realistic approach since, in nature, waves can be reflected at the beach but

they will then propagate towards deep waters and will not be re-reflected back.

During each short run only two wave groups were ran (27.2 s). In this case, the IG

waves re-reflected at the wave-maker will only arrive at each cross-shore position at the

end of the second short-wave group. However, IG waves produced by the first wave

group that reflect at the beach will influence the second wave group.

Fig. 4.26 shows the propagation, both in time and in space, of the two wave groups

and the IG waves associated, for each of the three wave conditions. The beach profiles

during the three runs, represented in Fig. 4.27, were very similar (except for a deeper

trough around x = 22 m, for C3 run initial profile), therefore the differences observed

are directly linked to the wave conditions and not to distinct morphological features.

Since the short waves have the same energy for the three wave conditions, the

differences that may be found in the hydrodynamics and morphodynamics are necessarily,

directly or indirectly, linked to the IG waves. The IG-wave period is also the same,

it is the IG-wave height and phasing that change. The following analysis aims at

understanding what is the importance of these two parameters of IG waves on the

overall hydrodynamics and morphodynamics along the beach profile and what are the

mechanisms behind a distinct morphological behavior for each wave condition. For

that purpose, short runs of two wave groups, run over three different types of initial

beach profiles, are presented. The differences in the morphodynamics between wave

conditions are highlighted and an analysis of the hydrodynamics is subsequently done to

try to identify the mechanisms behind these differences. This analysis is extended with

velocity experimental and numerical data and the results of monochromatic IG-wave

runs.

The short runs were run after long runs or after other short runs. This implies

that C1, C2 and C3 were not always run over the same initial profile. They were run

over different profiles, similar until about x = 20 m and with greater differences from

the end of the shoaling zone until the upper beachface. The initial beach profiles can

schematically be divided into three types, depicted in Fig.4.28: one with slightly more

dissipative surf and swash zones and a smooth slope break between the surf and the

shoaling zones (type A); one with a more defined bar just before x = 22 m, deeper

surf and swash zones and steeper surf-zone beach slope (type B); and one with no bar

and almost no slope break, a significantly more shallow beachface and a wider emersed

beach (type C). This last one was only obtained when a C3 long run was run, which

was done once in the full set of experiments.

All three types of profiles are very similar until around x = 20 m. The breakpoint is

located near x = 22 m for the three wave conditions. Contrary to profiles of type B,

profiles of type A and C have no marked bar near the breakpoint and have shallower surf

and swash zones. Type C profiles have the shallowest surf and swash zones (about 4-cm

and 2-cm shallower than for profiles of type B and A, respectively), which implies that

the shoreline is positioned further offshore, about 1 m from type-B-profiles shoreline and

0.5 m from type-A-profiles shoreline. All profile types produced during the experiments

have a mean beach slope typical of intermediate beaches in nature.

4.4.1 Morphodynamics

Depending on the initial profile, the sediment transport induced by each wave

condition can be different. However, for different runs of each wave condition, a specific

tendency (or pattern) of sediment transport can be observed, which is distinct for

the three wave conditions. The way each wave condition acts on each type of initial

bed profile (eroding, accreting, . . . ) allows an understanding of its sediment transport

potential.

Since in this section of the work the focus is on the two wave-groups runs, the analysis

of sediment transport is done for the upper section of the profile (onshore of x = 20 m),

as the small duration of these runs was not enough to induce significant change in the

deeper parts of the profile. Fig. 4.29 shows the effect of three C2 short runs over initial

beach profiles of type C (with the shallowest surf and swash zones), type A (with surf

and swash zones deeper than type C) and type B (with the deepest surf and swash

zones).

For initial profiles of type C and A, C2 promotes erosion of the surf and swash

zones, concomitant with an offshore transport that then results in accumulation in

the upper-shoaling zone. Acting over the shallower surf zone and beachface of type C

profile, the maximum magnitude of the offshore transport promoted by C2 diminishes

by only around 25% from the first to the last run. For the type A profile, C2 capacity

for offshore transport decreases significantly to less than half in just two runs. When

the initial profile is of type B, C2 is even less capable of offshore transport, showing

very low rates of transport, and the first run even has an accreting action near the

breakpoint.

C1 is the wave condition with more IG waves at the upper beach, and a different

IG-wave phasing relative to the group. Fig. 4.30 illustrates how C1 acts on initial beach

profiles of types A and B. As C2, C1 promotes erosion in the surf zone with offshore

transport towards the shoaling zone, for initial profiles of type A. However, erosion is

more intense just after the breakpoint (instead of being more gentle but over the entire

surf and swash zones) and the magnitude of the maximum offshore transport does not

weaken significantly along the three runs. Furthermore, for C1 runs, the sediment that

is deposited in the shoaling zone, is deposited at a location further offshore than for C2.

For the type-B initial profile, while C2 no longer promotes a marked offshore transport,

C1 is still capable of doing so, continuing to erode the trough after the breakpoint,

accentuating the bar. The sediment eroded keeps being transported offshore as for

C1-over-type-A case, and deposited between x = 20.5 m and x = 22 m. It is thus

Section 4.4 Chapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics

clear that C1 still promotes the pattern of sediment erosion after the breakpoint and

deposition in the end of the shoaling zone for profiles for which C2 is no longer capable.

No results are presented for the type-C beach profile for C1 wave condition. However,

it is logic to assume, from the results depicted in Fig. 4.29, that if C1 was ran over a

type-C initial profile, the tendency would be for sediment transport to follow the same

transport pattern that it does for C2, but with even greater magnitude.

The C3 wave condition, with less modulation, shows less capacity for transporting

sediment, when compared with C2 and C1. Fig. 4.31 shows the effect of two and three

short runs, over profiles of type A and B, respectively. Over profiles of type A, only

two runs are enough to show that C3 essentially smooths the initial profile, with no

major zones of accretion or erosion. For type-B initial profiles, C3 results in a transport

tendency with an opposite direction to that of C1. While C1 tends to promote the

erosion of the through inshore of the bar, C3 promotes accretion instead. The sediment

accumulating just inshore of x = 22 m is transported onshore from the region between

x = 20 m and x = 22 m, which is the same region where sediment transported by C1

from inshore of the bar accumulates.

Chapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics Section 4.4

For all wave conditions and all profile types the same weak tendency for erosion of

the swash zone is found. Also for C1, C2 or C3, the absolute magnitude of the transport

rate for one single run depends very strongly on the initial profile considered and should

thus not be compared between conditions (when the first run was not ran over the exact

same initial profile for all conditions). However, the capacity for promoting sediment

transport over one same profile type along two or three runs is meaningful and can be

compared between wave conditions.

Even though the magnitudes may diverge depending on the initial profile type

considered and other morphological characteristics of the profiles (such as ripples), a

common pattern of sediment transport was found for each wave condition. Summing

up, at the time scale of two to three runs of two wave groups each:

? for all conditions, sediment is transported from (to) the region of the shoaling

zone comprised between x = 20 m and x = 22 m, to (from) the surf zone, in

particular the outer-surf zone; this means that these two zones of the beach profile

are morphodynamically coupled;

? for C1 and C2, the general tendency of transport between the shoaling and the

surf zones is offshore-directed, while for C3 is onshore-directed;

? C1 has a greater capacity for eroding the trough after the bar and transporting

sediment offshore than C2;

? C3 is the only condition promoting sediment accretion in the inner-surf zone over

the profile type considered;

? C1 and C2 (higher IG waves) tend to develop a bar/trough near the breaking zone,

while the onshore sediment transport promoted by C3 promotes the disappearance

of the bar/trough system;

? the morphodynamic changes observed are greater for the wave conditions further

apart from their equilibrium profiles.

4.4.2 Hydrodynamics

Sediment transport patterns and beach-profile morphology changes were shown to

be different for each wave condition. In order to understand the mechanisms behind

these differences, the wave hydrodynamics are subsequently analysed through means of

Hrms of both total and IG-wave only, Sk, As, ??? and ???. The residual oscillations that
remain in the flume after the passage of the two wave groups are not to be included

in the statistics as they may bias the results and therefore a method based on the

141



Section 4.4 Chapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics

wave-group envelope width was used to select the part of the free-surface elevation

signal to be considered. An example for each of the wave conditions is depicted in Fig.

4.32. The resulting time series do not have the same length for all the wave gauges and,

in the case of the most offshore gauges, a limit of 27.2 s was imposed as the maximum

duration of the time series to include. Considering the wave-envelope duration allows

the inclusion of important short-waves at the end of the IG wave, for gauges in the surf

zone. If only the length of the two wave groups, as they were input at the wave-maker

(27.2 s), was considered for these gauges, an important part of the wave amplitude signal

would be ignored in the statistics. This method, applied to establish the duration of

the free-surface-elevation signal to be considered, is thus a compromise for the different

cross-shore positions and wave conditions. Small differences in the statistics that may

be found for the most offshore wave gauges (for which short-wave height is the same for

all wave conditions) are linked to small variations in the selected part of the time series.

Since the hydrodynamics depends not only on the wave condition but also on

the beach profile over which it acts, in order to understand the differences between

wave conditions, the beach profiles must be the most similar possible. Therefore, the

hydrodynamics are analysed in pairs of runs (C2-C1, C2-C3 and C1-C3), between which

very little bed-profile changes were observed. This analysis is presented in Fig.4.33.

From the comparison of the free-surface elevation statistics between wave conditions,

some observations can be summed up:

? As expected, short-wave height is about the same for all wave conditions until

the end of the shoaling zone and very similar beyond;

Section 4.4 Chapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics

? Nonlinearities increase in the shoaling zone until the breaking zone and decrease

in the surf zone;

? As? in the surf and swash zones is greater for the conditions with less IG waves,

in particular for C3;

? Sk?, dissipation and set-up/set-down are very similar between conditions.

The differences in sediment transport between wave conditions have to be justified

by a distinct balance between the hydrodynamic processes for each wave condition. In

this case, the main parameters that vary significantly between the three wave conditions

are the IG-wave height and the asymmetry.

On the one hand, asymmetry is known to contribute to onshore sediment transport.

A greater asymmetry is observed for C3 (comparatively to the other conditions) shore-

wards of x = 22 m, which may contribute to an onshore-transport tendency in the surf

zone. On the other hand, the IG-wave height is the only parameter shown in Fig. 4.33

that is different for the three wave conditions in the shoaling and surf zones and may

thus help justifying the sediment transport between these zones of the beach profile.

Another mechanism that could justify the offshore sediment transport observed for

certain experiments and has not been discussed yet is the phase-lag effect. Positive

wave skewness is generally associated with net onshore sediment transport. However,

waves that are purely skewed may generate a net sediment transport offshore directed

due to the phase lag between the mobilization and the transport of the sediment. This

mechanism can be characterized by a phase-lag parameter (Dohmen-Janssen et al.,

2002), which essentially depends on two variables: the particle settling time and the

wave period. Grasso et al. (2011) have investigated the occurrence of phase-lag effects

in the LEGI wave flume under wave conditions with similar heights and periods to the

ones analysed herein and have shown that, effectively, for most of their experiments,

unsteady behavior was observed, during which phase-lag effects can occur. However,

in their case, these effects were observed when large wave skewness was associated

to small wave asymmetry, which is not frequent in the experiments analysed in this

work. Furthermore, for all the three conditions, C1, C2 and C3, the particle settling

time (settling velocity) and the short-wave period are the same. Therefore, at the

timescale of short waves, the phase-lags effects can be expected to be of the same

order independently of the wave condition considered. Hence, phase-lag effects linked

to short-wave-action only cannot be responsible for the differences observed in the

sediment transport between wave conditions.

Analysing the velocity measurements for the different wave conditions may provide

further insight into the differences observed in the sediment transport. Velocity measure-

ments were done during the experiments at various cross-shore positions. Nonetheless,

as it was depicted in Fig. 4.15, it was not possible to obtain good velocity measurements

with the ADV along all the profile. In particular, the region where the greatest undertow

is expected (near breaking), is particularly difficult for getting clean measurements, as

there are large amounts of sediment in suspension. Since the undertow may promote an

important offshore sediment transport, it is crucial to evaluate its contribution for the

different wave conditions. To overcome the lack of accurate ADV velocity measurements

near the breakpoint and in the surf zone, the SERR1D model was used to simulate the

C1, C2 and C3 short runs, providing velocity predictions for all wave-gauge positions.

(left column) and for C2 and C3 (right column), obtained with SERR1D. For the first

point of the domain, the velocity experimental values are also depicted in Fig. 4.34.

For each pair of wave conditions, the experimental runs chosen for providing the input

conditions had been run one after the other and thus over beach profiles almost equal.

The estimated urms is nearly the same for the three wave conditions and is maximal

near the breakpoint (and thus near the bar/slope-break). The urms,IG also reaches its

maximum near the breakpoint for all wave conditions, but it is greater for C1 and

smaller for C3, responding to the different IG-wave heights. Between C2 and C3 this

difference is only significant after the breakpoint. Although the trends are very similar

for the three wave conditions, Sku tends to be greater for C2, until the surf zone. As

it was already observed for As?, the Asu is larger when IG-waves are smaller. The

undertow increases until the breakpoint (near the bar), decreasing afterwards towards

the beach, being very similar for all wave conditions. This was further confirmed by

velocity profiles done with an ADVP, although these results are not presented nor

analysed in the scope of this thesis. Moreover, the wave conditions which tend to

promote offshore transport from the surf zone towards deeper waters are not the ones

with slightly greater undertow velocities. Therefore, as a first hypothesis, the undertow

is not the preponderant driving mechanism for the offshore sediment transport.

Still in pursuance of a better understanding of the differences in the flow velocity

between wave conditions that can contribute to the differences observed in the morpho-

dynamics, Fig. 4.35 shows the comparison of five terms resulting from the decomposition

of the third-order velocity moment
?
|u|2 u

?
for C1-C2 and C2-C3 pairs, from the end

of shoaling until the shore (calculated following the procedure detailed in chapter 3).

The other terms that are not presented have a negligible contribution (at least one

order of magnitude smaller than the terms presented). Positive/negative values of

the third-order velocity moment terms are expected to contribute to onshore/offshore

transport.

Among the terms considered, it is the short-wave skewness (Sk1), the correlation

between short-wave variance and IG-wave velocity (Sk2) and the short-wave stirring

and transport by the mean flow that dominate for all wave conditions. For C1, C2 and

C3, with the exception of Sk1 terms, all the terms have negative values, thus potentially

contributing to an offshore transport. For both C1 and C2, until the breakpoint, Sk1

and Sk2 have values of the same order of magnitude, but of opposite sign. For C1, Sk1

is slightly smaller than for C2 and than Sk2. For C2, it is Sk2 which is slightly smaller

than Sk1 and smaller than for C1. If only these terms are considered, a slight tendency

for more offshore transport may thus be expected for C1. If the analysis is extended

to the other three terms (Sk4, Sk5 and Sk6), except for the stirring by short-waves

and transport by mean flow (Sk5), the tendency is for C1 to have more negative values

than C2, reinforcing the contribution to offshore transport. In the inner-surf and swash

zones, for C1, the values of Sk2, Sk4 and Sk5 are progressively less negative than for

C2, and significantly less negative than near the breakpoint, even changing to a positive

contribution (Sk4) near the shoreline. Therefore, the potential for offshore transport

associated with

but decreases in the surf and swash zones, where the potential for offshore transport is

greater for C2.

are very similar to those of C2 until the

147



Section 4.4 Chapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics

greater for C2 as well, and the other terms are equal and negative for both C2 and C3.

Onshore of the breakpoint, the differences between C2 and C3 for Sk1, Sk2 and Sk5

terms are very small, and it is the terms linked to IG waves (Sk4 and Sk6) that are

distinct between the two wave conditions: since for C3 the IG waves are very small, the

contribution of these terms are small in this zone of the beach profile.

The analysis of the third-order velocity moment terms can be summed up in the

following points:

? For the three wave conditions, there are more terms contributing to an offshore

than to an onshore transport direction; however, the absolute values of each term

vary between conditions;

? C1 and C2 have very similar contributions of the different terms to sediment

transport, with C1 having a slightly greater contribution from terms directly

dependent on IG-wave motion and C2 from terms more dependent on short-wave

motion;

? Short-wave skewness is smaller for C3 than for the other two wave conditions

before the breakpoint;

? The terms directly dependent on IG-wave velocity are particularly small for C3

onshore of the breakpoint.

Onshore of the breakpoint it is clear the smaller contribution of the
?
|u|2 u

?
terms

responsible for offshore transport (Sk2-Sk6) for C3 than for C2. However, near the

breakpoint and further offshore, no clear inequality of the former terms is observed

between the wave conditions. Furthermore, also before the breakpoint, the values of

the various terms for C1 and C2 seem too similar to justify the significantly-greater

capacity for accumulating sediment until x = 20.5 m previously observed for C1 (Fig.

4.30). Therefore, some other mechanism must be determining the differences in the

sediment transport observed around the breakpoint and further offshore.

For all wave conditions, the short-wave velocity reaches its largest values in the

breaking zone (around x = 22 m), which means that great quantities of sediment are

suspended there by short-wave action. In the same zone of the beach profile, IG waves

also reach maximal velocities, which means that they may advect the sediment stirred

by short-wave action away from its initial location.

For IG waves to be able of transporting sediment suspended by the short waves, not

only the magnitude of IG-wave velocity is important, but also the phasing between the

IG waves and the short waves. Very small differences in the IG-wave velocity magnitude

between conditions are depicted in Fig. 4.34 (especially between C2 and C3), which

148



Chapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics Section 4.4

supports the idea that the phasing between the IG waves and the short waves may even

be fundamental.

Fig. 4.36 shows, for experimental and numerical data, the time series of free-surface

elevation and velocity, for the total signal and IG-component only and the separation of

the incident and reflected IG-wave components. The time series are presented for three

example cases of C1, C2 and C3, run over very similar profiles (those of Fig. 4.33). The

incident IG waves are very-accurately represented by the model for all wave conditions,

both in terms of amplitude and phasing. The phasing of the reflected IG waves depends

strongly on the beach-profile shape (shoreline position, water depth, etc.) and swash

zone dynamics, which hinders the model from achieving a totally correct representation

of this component of the IG waves. Fig. 4.36 also confirms the ability of the model to

approximately simulate the IG waves, particularly in terms of amplitude, for incident,

reflected and total IG waves.

For all the conditions, IG velocities are predominantly negative along the cycle, which

is also observed for cross-shore positions further inshore. The onshore-directed IG-wave

velocities are not only shorter in time and smaller in magnitude, but they are also

concurrent with the smallest short waves of the groups. This means that more sediment

is expected to be in suspension (and thus available to be advected by the IG waves)

149



Section 4.4 Chapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics

during the offshore stroke of the IG waves. Hence, an offshore sediment transport by

the IG-wave oscillatory flow seems more likely than an onshore sediment transport. For

the runs represented in Fig. 4.36 (the same runs of Fig. 4.33), C1 has greater IG-wave

height and thus greater IG-wave velocity (urms,IG = 0.036 m s
-1, instead of urms,IG =

0.026 m s-1 for C2, at x = 20.4 m). Also, the IG negative velocities reach their maxima

near the end of the wave groups when the largest amount of sediment was observed to

be in suspension. Both factors justify the greater capacity for sediment transport in the

offshore direction of C1 relatively to C2, which was also suggested by the third-order

velocity moment terms (in particular, Sk2).

For the runs considered, C3 has a urms,IG = 0.033 m s
-1 (at x = 20.4 m - Fig. 4.36

run), between the urms values of C1 and C2. Depending, on the runs considered, the

urms,IG of C3 may be more similar to that of C2 than of C1 (for e.g., in Fig. 4.34, C2

and C3 urms,IG at x = 20.4 m is about the same). However, the duration of the episodes

with significant IG-wave velocity is much shorter than for C2 and, especially, than for

C1 (and limited to the beginning and end of the wave signal), which results in very weak

IG-wave velocities along most of the IG-wave cycle. Furthermore, unlike C1 and C2, C3

short-wave height is important even when IG-wave velocity is the smallest. Thus, for

C1 and C2, the very small short waves that correspond to the IG-wave velocity minima

can be expected to suspend less sediment than the corresponding short waves of C3,

which have comparable heights during the IG-velocity minima and along the rest of

the wave group. When there is a significant amount of sediment suspension and the

IG-wave velocity is negligible and not strong enough to advect sediment offshore, it is

logical to assume that the sediment transport has to be driven by a different mechanism.

C3 was seen to have the capacity for onshore transport for the same profile types over

which C1 and C2 induced offshore transport. The C3 sediment transport must thus

be dominated by the nonlinearities of short-waves, the only mechanism that, in the

absence of significant IG-wave velocities, can promote onshore sediment transport.

The ideas explained above are based on the observation of the time series at x =

20.4 m, near the outer limit of the deposition zone observed in the beach profiles. Since

no clean experimental velocity measurements can be retrieved near the breakpoint, the

numerical results equivalent to Fig. 4.36, but obtained instead at x = 21.65 m, are

presented in Fig. 4.37. The phasing between IG-waves (and IG-wave velocity) and

short-waves that was discussed for the results obtained at x = 20.4 m can also be

observed for the numerical data near the breakpoint (x = 21.65 m), which reinforces the

idea that this phasing may be a crucial mechanism, determining the distinct sediment

transport patterns observed for each wave condition.

Overall, IG-wave amplitude and phasing relatively to the wave group are shown to

be able of conditioning sediment transport magnitude and direction. Furthermore, IG

waves are seen to influence short-wave nonlinearities, particularly asymmetry.

The comparison between wave statistics (Fig. 4.33) for the three wave conditions

has shown that the more IG-waves are present, the smaller is the asymmetry in the

surf and swash zones. This was especially clear for C3 condition (significantly less IG

waves, the greatest asymmetry), both in terms of free-surface elevation and velocity,

and contributed to onshore sediment transport. Additionally, when SERR1D was used,

it partially underestimated the measured IG-wave height in the surf and swash zones

(see Figs. 4.17 and 4.19. As a result, the model systematically overestimated asymmetry

(and also skewness, in a smaller measure) in these zones of the beach profile. Both

these points indicate that surf- and swash-zone asymmetry is being influenced by the

IG-wave height.

Elgar &amp;amp; Guza (1985) have stated that contributions from the frequency pairs with low-

frequency components is opposite in sign to the contributions from the high-frequency

pairs, which can reduce the skewness by 30-60% and asymmetry by about 15-30%.

However, taking as an example the cross-shore position in the surf zone of x = 23.33 m

and the cases of C1 and C3 shown in Fig. 4.33, a much more accentuated reduction of

asymmetry (of more than 30 %) from C3 to C1 is evident and therefore the contribution

151



Section 4.4 Chapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics

of the low-frequency pairs can be one of the causes, but not the main cause of asymmetry

reduction. On the other hand, at the same position, the water depth is of about 3.6

cm, at rest. With the set-up, 4 or 7 mm more of water depth can be expected for C1

or C3, respectively, which are small values relatively to the total water depth at rest.

While Hrms of the short waves is about the same for both C1 and C3 at that cross-shore

position, the Hrms of IG waves is about three times higher for C3, meaning that instead

of a water depth of about 3.6 cm (at rest) ± 0.7 cm (corresponding to half of Hrms,IG),
for C3, there will be a water depth of around 3.6 cm (at rest) ± 1.9 cm, for C1. Hence,
as wave nonlinearities are dependent on the local water depth, differences in the wave

shape, including asymmetry, can be expected as a result of water-depth modulation by

the IG waves. This explains the differences in asymmetry found in the surf and swash

zones between wave conditions.

4.4.3 Monochromatic infragravity-wave runs

In nature, IG waves that propagate to the shore are most commonly associated with

short waves and thus their direct effect cannot be measured. However, in an artificial

wave flume, IG waves can be simulated alone, as monochromatic waves with a long

period.

Chapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics Section 4.4

Four 20-min IG-waves experiments were ran in the LEGI wave flume, with increasing

input IG-wave heights, presented in Fig. 4.38: IG1, with IG-wave height approximately

equal to the maximum IG-wave height of C2 long runs, and IG2, IG3 and IG4, which

were designed to have wave heights twice, three times and four times the wave height

of IG1 waves. For IG1, IG2 and IG3, sediment transport is very weak and the changes

induced on the beach profile consist essentially in some ripples. IG4 has significantly

greater capacity for mobilizing the sediments, promoting onshore sediment transport

from just before the slope break towards the beachface. The effect of the monochromatic

IG waves is only significant in shallower waters, at the velocity anti-node (around x =

22 m).

Fig. 4.39 shows the comparison of IG-wave short runs (27.2 s) with C1 and C2 short

runs, ran over very similar beach profiles and makes it possible to directly compare the

effect on sediment transport of IG waves alone and short-waves and IG waves together.

Section 4.5 Chapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics

is almost one order of magnitude smaller than that of one C2 or one C1 run. IG3

has a greater capacity for sediment transport than IG1 and IG2, but still very locally

(near the shoreline). Therefore, IG waves are capable, depending on their height, of

generating sediment transport alone, even if only very locally, but only when their height

is significantly greater than the height of the IG waves associated to the short-wave

groups in the experiments presented in this work (the case of IG4 wave condition).

4.5 Discussion

In this chapter, infragravity waves were shown to influence sediment transport in

many ways. In nature, IG waves that propagate to the shore are associated with short

waves and thus their direct effect cannot be measured directly.

Beach &amp;amp; Sternberg (1988) and Russell (1993) have suggested that IG waves are able

of suspending sediment themselves, close to the shore, during storm conditions, when

they assume the form of swash bores. The research community has been so far inclined

to think that, in a general way, IG-waves are not capable of suspending sediment alone

and act instead as mean currents, advecting sediment already suspended by short-wave

action (Aagaard &amp;amp; Greenwood, 2008).

For the current work, beach profiles are classified as being in the intermediate range,

mild to intermediate wave conditions are considered (with IG-wave height corresponding

to less than 0.5 m in nature) and C1 and C2 were already designed to have the maximum

modulation. Even if for C1 there is the added contribution of free IG waves, Fig. 4.38

shows clearly that no significant sediment transport can occur in the experiments

considered in this work by the effect of the IG waves alone. Therefore, for the full set

of experiments ran, IG waves were only capable of influencing sediment transport by

advecting the sediment suspended by the short-wave action away from its suspension

zone.

A turbidity current, represented in Fig. 4.40, was observed transporting from the

breaker zone significant quantities of sediment in suspension towards deeper waters.

This current started developing near the breakpoint, just after the passing of the greatest

Figure 4.40: Propagation of the turbidity current towards deeper waters (photos by Cyril Fresillon -
CNRS photothe?que).

154



Chapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics Section 4.5

wave of the first wave group (of each pair of wave groups), which coincided with the

beginning of the offshore stroke of the IG-wave associated with the short-wave groups.

The turbidity current then propagated offshore transporting great amounts of sediment,

both as bed-load and suspended-load, until the arrival of the next wave group, which

contributed to slow it down. However, even with a smaller velocity, it continued moving

the sediment particles slowly offshorewards until around x = 20.6 m. This current was

observed to be more intense during C1 equilibrium runs, than for C2 or C3, which leads

to the consideration that IG waves may be, at least partially, influencing/controlling

this current.

Aagaard &amp;amp; Greenwood (2008) have stated that if the sand is entrained near a re-

suspension maximum (such as the breakpoint, located slightly onshore of x = 22 m,

for C1 equilibrium profile), its decay distance depends only on the IG-wave orbital

diameter, which can be estimated as d0 = umaxTIG/? (where d0 is the IG-wave orbital

diameter, umax the maximum IG-wave velocity and TIG the IG-wave period). Hence,

for C1, which reaches maximum IG-wave velocities of about 0.15 m s-1 (at x = 21.9 m)

for the moments of the run with higher IG waves, an orbital diameter around 0.5 m can

be estimated. The same authors proposed that offshore of a re-suspension maximum

the transport by IG waves is directed seawards. Therefore, the offshore stroke of the IG

waves (associated with the undertow) is likely contributing to the offshore advection of

sediment suspended at the breakpoint (until around x = 21.9 ? 0.5 = 21.4 m) towards
the offshore slope of the bar (instead of the sediment being simply re-deposited closer to

the position where it was suspended, still on the onshore side of the bar). From thereon,

the turbidity current becomes preponderant on the offshore advection of sediment,

carrying the sediment still further offshore and thus strongly influencing the sediment

transport. Fig. 4.41 shows five C1 short-runs that were run consecutively and reinforces

this idea. For this set of runs, the role of the turbidity current in the transport of

sediment from the breakpoint offshorewards is very clear. In the bed profiles it is

visible, run after run, a marked accretion until about x = 20.7 m. The sediment that

is transported offshore is eroded at the breakpoint, creating a trough and defining

progressively a bar.

During the equilibrium runs, the IG waves were shown to modulate skewness and

asymmetry of short-waves along the beach profile, which vary along the runs responding

to the variation of IG-wave phase and height. Prel et al. (2011) had previously

demonstrated in experiments performed in the LEGI wave flume that IG waves can

modulate skewness and asymmetry even in the shoaling zone. The short-runs have

shown that the phasing of IG waves relatively to the short-wave envelope can even

condition the direction and intensity of the sediment transport. If the other mechanisms

directed offshore (onshore).

By comparison of wave conditions run over the same beach profile, surf and swash

zone asymmetry was shown to be influenced by the IG waves, with lower asymmetry for

higher IG-wave heights. Wave conditions with higher IG waves allow a greater water

depth in the surf and swash zones. Further, IG-wave motion is positively correlated

with short-wave motion in this zone of the beach profile, as the crests of IG waves allow

the greatest short-wave of the group to propagate. Therefore, greater IG-wave height

implies a greater water depth below the greater short-waves of the group, reducing

asymmetry (which is larger for shallower depths).

The greater offshore transport observed for C1 is justified by the greater absolute

values of IG-wave velocity for this condition, the more negative values of the

higher sediment suspension (at the end of each short-wave group) with maximal IG-

wave offshore-directed velocities. The higher IG-waves further contribute to a smaller

asymmetry, promoting even less the onshore sediment transport (in the surf zone).

The minor capacity for offshore transport of C3 is justified by the lower IG-wave

velocities, the smaller contribution of
?

?
terms directly dependent on IG-wave

motion, the larger asymmetry, in the surf and swash zones and the small modulation

of the short-wave groups (implying that the short-waves are almost equally important

along each wave group). All these factors imply that IG-wave offshore transport never

has the possibility of becoming more important than the short-wave-driven onshore

transport for this wave condition. The maximal modulation of C2 wave groups allows

the existence of moments along the groups when short-waves are less important. It has

lower absolute values of IG-wave velocity than C1, a smaller contribution of
?
|u|2 u

?
terms directly dependent on IG-wave motion than C1, the maxima of IG-wave velocity

are not in phase with the moments when more sediment is in suspension and it has

greater asymmetry than C1. Therefore, although it has mostly a tendency for offshore

transport, as it is illustrated by the significantly negative values of almost all terms of

the
?
|u|2 u

?
, its capacity for offshore sediment transport is smaller than that of C1.

The differences in the morphodynamics between the three wave conditions are thus

explained by two distinct mechanisms linked to the IG waves: (i) advection by IG-

waves of sediment suspended by short-wave action (as previously proposed by Aagaard

&amp;amp; Greenwood (2008)), which is dependent on IG-wave height and phasing with the

short-wave groups and (ii) modulation of short-wave nonlinearities by IG-wave motion,

both directly and indirectly, through water-depth modulation (which is also dependent

on IG-wave height). Moreover, the IG-wave motion was shown to contribute to the

establishment of a turbidity current, further promoting the offshore transport. To the

knowledge of the author, this link between IG waves and a turbidity current has not

yet been observed in the field.

The results presented in this work extend the previous findings of Grasso et al.

(2009a) and show that, even when the Dean number is the same, if the IG-wave energy

(or short-wave groups) is different, distinct equilibrium profiles are shaped.

The swash-zone dynamics was also demonstrated (particularly through the analysis

of the long runs) to be affected by IG-wave height and phasing. Wave run-up and

beachface gradient adjusted, reacting to the changes induced to the sediment transport

by the varying IG-wave height and phase. As Masselink et al. (2006) stated and Alsina

et al. (2012) also observed, the beachface cannot be considered in isolation from the

surf zone: the changes induced by the IG waves in the upper beach were seen to be

linked to beach-profile changes in the surf zone and inner-shoaling zone and vice-versa.

157



Section 4.6 Chapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics

In the shoaling zone equilibrium profile of C1 (Fig. 4.20), there is a sediment

accumulation region around x = 18.5 m. Since in this region of the shoaling the beach

profile has already a water depth of about 30 cm, short waves are not able of suspending

there significant quantities of sediment and thus sediment transport must rely on other

mechanisms. IG waves were shown to be able of transporting suspended sediment only

until x ? 20.5 m. Therefore, sediment must have been transported as bed load. Since
IG waves are the factor that changes between C1 and C2 or C3, they are probably

responsible for this sediment accumulation. However, the sediment accumulated in

this region during the evolution of the beach profile towards equilibrium. Therefore, in

order to understand the mechanisms responsible for this sediment transport, velocity

measurements near the bed during the evolution of the beach profile towards equilibrium

are necessary. Unfortunately, the measurements made during the evolution of the beach

profiles towards equilibrium were not made simultaneously at different cross-shore

positions (since a single ADV was available). Therefore, no further conclusions can be

drawn about the accumulation found only for C1 (greater IG waves).

The IG-wave period was not varied during the experiments performed at the LEGI

in the scope of this work. Still, the results suggest that the shape of the beach profile

may be influenced by it. Earlier researches, such as those of Short (1975) and Bowen

(1980) have hypothesized that bar formation may be related to the positions of the

standing-wave nodes and antinodes. Michallet et al. (2007) have shown, also in the

LEGI wave flume, partial evidence of nodal structure consistent with the cross-shore

bar position. Aagaard &amp;amp; Bryan (2003) have argued that, for standing IG waves to be

capable of imposing spatially segregated sediment transport patterns and thus influence

bar position, they have to be sufficiently energetic and have a reasonably well-defined

cross-shore structure. In the experiments ran, due to IG-wave reflection at the beach

and at the wave-maker, IG-wave height is sufficiently enhanced to generate sufficiently

energetic IG waves. Further, as the wave conditions ran were bichromatic, defined and

discrete modes and frequencies of IG-wave oscillation were preferentially forced and

persisted during the length of the runs (up to 5.3 h, depending on the run), resulting in

well-defined (partially) standing IG waves. For the different beach profiles obtained,

the slope break or bar (depending on the wave condition) was located just next to a

free-surface elevation node of the second mode of oscillation of the flume. This mode

has, for the different profiles, a period that is very close to that of the IG wave (13.6 s).

Therefore, if wave conditions with a different IG-wave period were run, an adjustment

of the position of slope-break/bar would be expected.

Chapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics Section 4.6

4.6 Conclusion

The experiments analysed in this chapter were designed to clarify the role of the

infragravity waves in the sediment transport processes. Three different wave conditions

were chosen, to have both different IG-wave phasing with the short-wave groups and

different modulation (IG-wave height). Short runs of two-wave groups only and long

runs of a few hours were made over different initial beach profiles, free-surface elevation

and cross-shore velocity were measured and the net sediment transport was quantified.

IG waves alone were shown to be capable of modifying the beach profile, but only

when their heights are sufficiently great (highly-energetic waves and storm conditions).

For the wave conditions run during the experiments, corresponding to mild to moderate

wave conditions in nature, IG waves were only capable of influencing sediment transport

in the presence of short waves.

No significant differences in terms of wave nonlinearities until the surf zone were

observed between the different conditions when run over very similar beach profiles.

Due to the difficulty of having accurate velocity measurements in the surf and swash

zones, the SERR1D model was used to simulate cross-shore velocity along the beach

profile, and the undertow, calculated for a given bed profile, was found to be very

similar for the wave conditions considered. The distinct magnitudes and directions of

sediment transport were thus attributed to the influence of the IG waves. Differences

in the third-order velocity moment terms linked to IG-wave motion were shown to

contribute to differences in the sediment transport. Differences in the phasing of the

IG-waves with the short-wave groups were demonstrated to influence the direction

of sediment transport, as IG waves advect suspended sediment offshore or onshore,

depending on the wave-phase during which the sediment is available to be transported.

The modulation of the wave groups was shown to condition the existence of moments

of very small short-waves, during which short-wave skewness and asymmetry are less

important, and thus sediment advection by the IG waves can be favoured if enough

sediment is still in suspension.

When the same wave condition was run for a sufficiently long time, the beach profile

reaches an equilibrium. When the IG-wave height is significant, the IG waves form

standing (or partially-standing) wave oscillations that condition the profile shape and

the morphodynamics. In this case, the equilibrium is dynamic and is characterized by

changes of the beach profile around a “static” equilibrium profile, which are more marked

for wave conditions with greater IG waves, responding to a changing of incident and

reflected IG-wave heights. The changing of IG-wave phasing promotes, then, changes of

IG-wave height, wave and velocity nonlinearities and the swash dynamics. The resulting

beachface changes are linked and concurrent to changes in the surf and inner-shoaling

159



Section 4.6 Chapter 4. The role of infragravity waves in the beach morphodynamics

beach profiles.

Therefore, both in the long equilibrium runs and in the two-wave-group runs, IG-wave

height and phasing were shown to influence sediment transport, both by conditioning the

advection by IG-waves of sediment suspended by short-wave action or by modulating the

short-wave nonlinearities, both directly and indirectly (through water-depth modulation).

Therefore, the direction of sediment transport by IG waves in the surf and swash zones

is not the same for all the wave conditions and beaches: it depends on (i) the IG-wave

height and phasing with the short-waves, (ii) the modulation of the short waves and of

the short-wave nonlinearities promoted by the IG waves and (iii) the beach profile over

which the waves propagate.

More velocity measurements and collocated sediment concentration measurements

would help better understanding the influence of IG waves on sediment transport,

especially in what concerns the sediment accumulation in the shoaling zone and the

oscillations of the beachface (and their link to the other parts of the profile) observed

during the equilibrium runs of C1. Velocity measurements in the zones of greater

sediment suspension (with video imagery, for example) and near the bed (to evaluate

the importance of bed-load transport by the IG waves) and during the transitory runs

before equilibrium is reached may bring further insight. Varying the input IG-wave

period may help improving the understanding on the potential adjustment of the beach-

profile shape to the location of the nodes and antinodes of the (partially) standing IG

waves.

Conclusions and perspectives

5.1 General summary

The understanding and prediction of beach evolution necessarily implies the com-

prehension of the different processes that promote sediment transport and shape the

beach morphology. Short-wave nonlinearities (wave and velocity skewness and asym-

metry) have long been recognised to be one of the crucial mechanisms. Therefore,

it is important to include them in models intended at predicting sediment transport.

Currently, this is done by defining the velocity nonlinearities at a given moment from

the local height and length of the waves and the water depth. However, it was shown

in this work, making use of a physical model data set, a field data set and of results

obtained with a Boussinesq-type model, that this represents an incomplete approach

and comprises important errors, particularly onshore and near the breakpoint, where

sediment transport is very important. Hence, a new parameter which takes into account

more than local wave parameters was proposed, resulting in the improvement of existing

parameterizations.

Besides the short-wave nonlinearities, also infragravity waves were also demonstrated

to have an important role in the dynamics of the beach profile. Contrary to the

short-wave nonlinearities, which are consensually considered to play an important role

on sediment transport, the role of infragravity waves on sediment transport is still a

debated issue. In this work, through a set of experiments held in a light-weight-sediment

wave flume, it was confirmed that the IG waves are effectively capable of contributing

to sediment transport and this contribution was analysed and characterised.

The developed research is summarised below, together with the main conclusions,

which synthesize the partial ones previously presented at the end of the two main

chapters.

? A high-resolution (in time and space) data set was collected in a very gently-sloping

161



Section 5.1 Chapter 5. Conclusions and perspectives

beach, for both irregular and bichromatic waves, in the scope of the Hydralab

IV GLOBEX project. The analysis of this data set, from the shoaling zone until

the swash zone, helped distinguishing the distinct behaviours of irregular waves

and bichromatic waves. Irregular waves have a broader surf zone and a linear

development of the wave nonlinearities until the mid-surf zone; bichromatic waves

dissipate their energy over a narrower surf zone, reform in the mid-surf zone and

have multiple local maxima of nonlinearity along the cross-shore profile, which

are associated to short-wave breaking, but also to the presence of IG waves, when

the modulation is sufficiently important. For the same short-wave energy, larger

modulation results in wave statistics more similar to those of irregular waves:

broader surf zone, one skewness and asymmetry peak and smaller maximum

nonlinearity.

? Similarly to the short waves, also the IG waves were shown to become progressively

more nonlinear towards the coast and to end up by breaking (large increase of

wave height and velocity followed by a great decrease). Free IG waves and IG

waves associated to wave groups do not shoal similarly: while the height of the

incident free IG waves increases linearly towards the coast, incident IG waves

associated to short-wave groups have a greater height increase near the breakpoint

and have a local wave-height minimum in the mid-surf zone, from whereon their

height increases again.

? The GLOBEX data set comprised high-resolution measurements of both free-

surface elevation and velocity. Hence, it was also used to explore the similarit-

ies/differences between free-surface elevation and velocity nonlinearities. Even

though the absolute values of skewness and asymmetry are different, the main

trends are common to free-surface elevation and velocity. Departing from this

notion and following the linear wave theory for intermediate water depths, it was

shown that the cross-shore velocity, particularly its skewness and asymmetry,

can be deduced from the free-surface elevation time series. This is valid until

the inner-surf zone, where the maxima of skewness and asymmetry are reached.

Beyond, the linear wave theory fails. This procedure can be particularly useful to

retrieve velocity nonlinearities in situations where only free-surface elevation data

are available.

? Differences in the offshore characteristics of some of the GLOBEX wave conditions

were shown to result in distinct cross-shore trends of the nonlinearities and

especially on distinct maximum values. This was initially observed for differences

in the spectral bandwidth, for irregular waves, and for differences in the modulation,

162



Chapter 5. Conclusions and perspectives Section 5.1

for bichromatic waves.

? Using field data collected on several beaches, currently-used parameterizations

of velocity nonlinearities were analysed, leading to the conclusion that local

parameters, such as the local wave height and length and water depth, are not

sufficient to accurately describe skewness and asymmetry. The wave history must

be taken into account as well.

? The SERR1D numerical model (Cienfuegos et al., 2006, 2007) was validated for

GLOBEX and van Noorloos (2003) data sets. Subsequently, the model was used

to extend the GLOBEX data by simulating sets of wave conditions for which (i)

offshore wave height, (ii) offshore peak period, (iii) offshore spectral bandwidth

and (iv) beach slope were varied. This, together with the field data analysis, led

to the conclusion that the cross-shore evolution of the nonlinearity of irregular

waves cannot be estimated from local wave parameters only and is effectively

dependent on, at least, three non-local parameters: offshore wave steepness (the

most important), offshore spectral bandwidth and beach slope (in particular

for very steep or very mild slopes). For bichromatic waves, the modulation

(infragravity-wave height) was also shown to condition the nonlinearity trends

and maxima.

? A new parameter, NP0, was defined, on which the maximum of nonlinearity

reached by each wave condition was shown to depend. This parameter was then

incorporated, together with the spectral bandwidth, ?, on Ruessink et al. (2012)

parameterization. This resulted in a reduction of the root-mean-square error

between real and predicted values of nonlinearity in up to about 60%, relatively

to the former parameterization.

? The short-wave modulation was shown to influence the nonlinearity of bichromatic

waves. Hence, to explore the possibility that it may also influence sediment

transport, a set of experiments was performed in the LEGI wave flume with light-

weight sediments. Three wave conditions with the same short-wave energy but

different IG waves were simulated. When run long enough, each wave condition

produced a distinct equilibrium profile. For smaller IG waves, more sediment

was accumulated in the surf zone and beachface. For greater IG waves, the bar

was more marked and sediment accumulated in the shoaling zone before the

breakpoint. It is thus clear that IG waves influence the shape of equilibrium

profiles. This extends the previous findings of Grasso et al. (2009a), who had

argued that when the Dean number is the same, the beach profile at equilibrium

is the same.

163



Section 5.1 Chapter 5. Conclusions and perspectives

? Two different types of equilibrium were reached: a static and a dynamic. The

static equilibrium was observed when IG waves were smaller and was characterised

by a constant bed position. The dynamic equilibrium consisted instead of multiple

slightly-different profiles oscillating around an average profile shape and was

observed when the IG waves were greater. The periodic enhancement of the IG

waves (by the lack of a wave-maker with an active reflection compensation system

in the flume) contributed to these oscillations.

? The dynamic equilibrium runs highlighted the fact that, as Masselink et al. (2006)

had stated, the beachface cannot be considered in isolation from the surf zone:

the changes induced by the IG waves in the upper-beach were seen to be linked

to beach-profile changes in the surf and inner-shoaling zones, which were coupled

to the hydrodynamics. Slow accretion of the beachface, when IG-wave height

is minimal, results in a more reflective beachface, which contributes to a more

energetic swash dynamics and to greater IG-wave reflection, thus promoting

IG-wave growth. The accretion of the beachface is accompanied by an accretion

just offshore of the breakpoint and by the definition of a more marked bar (due

to the transport of sediment from the surf zone to the beachface and to the

shoaling zone), increasing energy dissipation at the bar. This results in a less

energetic swash zone and a less reflective beachface, which promotes IG-wave

height decrease. When an IG-wave height minimum is reached, the slow accretion

of the beachface can start again and the cycle continues.

? To avoid the effect of IG waves re-reflected at the wave maker, a series of runs

with only two wave groups was conducted. The IG waves were then shown to

be capable of influencing sediment transport, by two distinct mechanisms: (i)

advection by IG-waves of sediment suspended by short-wave action, which is

dependent on the IG-wave height and phasing with the short-wave groups and

(ii) modulation of short-wave nonlinearities by IG-wave motion, both directly and

indirectly, through water-depth modulation.

? The presence of a re-suspension maximum, where short-waves mobilize the sedi-

ment, which is then advected by the IG waves, as previously suggested by Aagaard

&amp;amp; Greenwood (2008), was observed at the breakpoint position. When the modu-

lation of the wave groups is higher, IG-wave velocities are larger and there are

periods during which short waves are very small. In the absence of short-waves

with positive skewness and asymmetry promoting onshore transport, the trans-

port by the IG waves becomes important. Therefore, a certain modulation is

necessary in order for the IG-wave transport to become significant relative to the

164



Chapter 5. Conclusions and perspectives Section 5.2

other sediment transport mechanisms (skewness and asymmetry of short waves,

undertow). The greatest concentration of suspended sediment was observed near

the end of each wave group. The greatest transport by the IG waves was observed

for the wave condition which had the greatest negative velocities also near the end

of each wave group. The phasing between the IG waves and short waves was thus

shown to condition both the magnitude and direction of the sediment advected

by the IG waves.

? The direction and magnitude of the sediment transport is always dependent

on the initial beach profile: the same wave condition may promote offshore or

onshore transport, depending on the relative importance of the different transport

mechanisms, which depend also on the profile morphology, not only on the

hydrodynamics.

5.2 Perspectives

5.2.1 Concerning GLOBEX data

The GLOBEX project provided an uncommon data set, especially in terms of velocity

measurements, which are not very often available with such high resolution (in time

and in space). This makes this data set ideal for analysing the evolution of the wave

nonlinearities along the beach profile, for different wave conditions. The nonlinearities

and IG-waves of the GLOBEX irregular-wave conditions have been extensively analysed

(also by Rocha et al. (2013a); de Bakker et al. (2014); Ruju et al. (2014); among others)

and are starting to be well understood. However, several issues rest to be clarified

regarding the bichromatic wave conditions.

? The cause of the reformation of short-waves in the mid-surf zone, which does not

happen for irregular waves.

? The variation of the incident IG-wave height in the surf zone: confirm if the

mechanism proposed by Baldock (2012) can explain the marked decrease in

IG-wave height after the breakpoint and explain the subsequent increase in the

mid-surf zone.

? The generation of IG-waves by the varying-breakpoint mechanism. Even if

the beach is a very gently-sloping one, there seems to be evidence of IG-wave

generation by the varying-breakpoint mechanism, at least for the bichromatic

waves. Since this may interfer with the propagation of the reflected IG waves

165



Section 5.2 Chapter 5. Conclusions and perspectives

and the interaction between short and IG waves, this issue merits to be further

investigated.

? The multiple skewness and asymmetry peaks of the bichromatic wave conditions.

They seem to be related to short-wave breaking zones and the influence of IG-

waves (correlation between short-waves and IG waves). A possible link between

IG-wave minima and skewness and asymmetry maxima was observed, but further

research is necessary for a more thorough understanding.

? The simulation of the bichromatic wave conditions with the SERR1D numerical

model. Since the different nonlinearity peaks are not well explained, it was not

possible to simulate them accurately with the SERR1D model, which can be

improved if the origin of the different peaks is better understood.

Retrospectively on the choice of the wave conditions to be run, it would have

been good to consider B3 wave condition with the same IG-wave period and greater

modulation than B2, as it was done, but with the same short-wave energy as well.

This would allow a more direct analysis of the influence of the IG-wave height on the

nonlinearities.

5.2.2 Concerning the parameterization of nonlinearities

The Ruessink et al. (2012) parameterization was improved for the data presented in

this work. To further validate this improvement, it should be applied to other data sets.

The improvement of the parameterization was reached through the change of only

two of its parameters. Modifying the other parameters may bring further improvement,

especially for the nonlinearity values in the end of the shoaling. This modification may

probably be based on the NP0 and ? as well.

If a large experimental or field data set with velocity measurements for wave conditions

with different wave steepness, beach slope and spectral bandwidth is available, the

modified expressions of Ruessink et al. (2012) parameters may be improved, by reducing

the fitting error of Bmax and ?(Ur=1) to NP0 and ?.

5.2.3 Concerning the LEGI experiments

The LEGI wave flume is a unique facility, which correctly represents many of the

hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes that exist in nature. However, it has still

some technical limitations which limit the comprehension of certain processes.

? In the scope of this thesis, the first technical limitation was the lack of a wave-

maker with an active reflection compensation system. This implied that IG waves

166



Chapter 5. Conclusions and perspectives Section 5.2

produced by the wave-maker that reflected back at the beach remained “trapped”

in the flume, since they re-reflected back at the wave-maker, and so on, until the

end of each experiment, when they finally dissipate. Therefore, the IG-wave height

in the flume was constantly enhanced and the equilibrium profiles reached do

not correspond to the equilibrium profiles that would be reached if the IG waves

reflected at the beach were not re-reflected at the wave-maker (and which would be

more directly comparable to nature). The evolution of the beach profile towards

equilibrium was also more complex to study due to the constant enhancement of

the IG waves, particularly for the wave condition with the largest modulation.

? The sediment transport rate can be deduced from the variation of the bed position

between the beginning and the end of each run. However, the variation of the bed

position during one run (which allows, for example, the following of the action of

each short-wave or wave group) cannot be tracked with the optical bed profiler.

A way to overcome this limitation is to use video imagery. Video imagery has the

advantage of not influencing the flow (as typical instruments to measure velocity

and sediment concentration do) and can be developed to detect the interface

between the fluid and the bed and thus to follow the evolution of the bed position

during the runs. Furthermore, it is possibly the only solution at the moment

to make accurate velocity measurements in zones of high sediment suspension

or very shallow water, which was also one of the limitations of this study that

obliged the utilization of a numerical model to overcome the problem. Having

accurate and simultaneous velocity measurements along the entire profile, and

especially in the zones of greater sediment suspension (near the breakpoint and in

the surf zone), would allow a better characterisation of the beach-profile evolution

towards equilibrium. Furthermore, obtaining velocity measurements near the bed,

particularly in the shoaling zone, would help further exploring the possibility of

bed-load sediment transport by the IG waves.

? By running experiments of only two wave groups and comparing wave conditions

with different modulation, the role of IG-wave phasing relatively to the short-wave

groups and the short-wave sediment-suspension events was investigated and the

importance of this phasing was underlined. To further confirm and extend the

findings on this issue, sediment concentration measurements would be of great

value. Measuring the velocity and concentration simultaneously and at the same

locations would confirm the observed correlation between IG-wave motion and

sediment transport, as well as the importance of the mentioned phasing.

Even within the referred technical limitations, other experiments similar to those

167



Section 5.2 Chapter 5. Conclusions and perspectives

performed in the scope of this thesis can help increasing the current knowledge on

IG-wave sediment transport. In this work, only three wave conditions were run in the

LEGI wave flume. More wave conditions with the same short-wave energy and different

degrees of modulation can further extend the present findings. Moreover, varying the

period of the IG waves may help confirming the possible relation between the IG waves

and the profile shape and, especially, the bar position.

5.2.4 General perspectives

The ultimate aim of being able of understanding wave nonlinearities and infragravity

waves is to include their contribution in the prediction of the beach dynamics. For that

purpose, some perspective work can be envisaged, based on the results obtained in this

thesis.

The improved estimations of B and ? parameters can be used, through Abreu

et al. (2010) formulation, to provide a better estimation of the free-stream near-bed

horizontal orbital motion. Many sand transport models evaluate the sediment transport

as a function of the orbital velocity just above the wave boundary layer or of the

bed shear stress (e.g. Meyer-Peter &amp;amp; Mu?ller, 1948; Nielsen, 1992; Abreu et al., 2013),

which can also be obtained from the orbital velocity (e.g. Ribberink &amp;amp; Al-Salem,

1994; Nielsen, 2006). Hence, the new version provided of the parameterization of the

velocity nonlinearities can be of further use to ameliorate current estimates of sediment

transport. The data set of the LEGI wave-flume experiments can then used to validate

the prediction of sediment transport.

The infragravity waves were also shown to influence sediment transport and thus their

contribution must be included in sediment-transport models as well. Parameterizations

of the sediment transport such as the one proposed by Marin?o-Tapia et al. (2007)

already include the influence of the infragravity-waves, through different terms of

the near-bed velocity moments. However, the presence of infragravity waves is not

condition enough for infragravity-wave-driven transport to exist: the phasing between

the infragravity-waves and the moments of higher sediment suspension can condition

both the magnitude and direction of sediment transport. Hence, the inclusion of a

parameter related to this phasing in the parameterizations has to be envisaged. A

potential approach may be similar to that of Dubarbier et al. (2015), which added an

extra sediment-transport term to the two classical terms of bed-load and suspended-load

fluxes to account for an acceleration-skewness (velocity asymmetry) induced transport.

A new sediment-transport term can be imagined, which takes into account the IG-wave

velocity magnitude and the phasing between IG waves and the short-wave groups (and

the higher sediment-suspension events) and represents the transport by IG waves.

Figure A.3: Time series of free-surface elevation and cross-shore velocity spectra at four different
cross-shore positions for A3 condition. Grey line - experimental data; dark red - A3E. Note: Since A3
is an irregular wave condition, the spectra of theoretic and experimental input conditions is the same,
but not the time series and thus A3T and A3T2 time series are not compared to A3E.

The following pages present a summary of the experiments carried out in the LEGI

wave flume that were analysed in the scope of this thesis. For a correct interpretation

of each column:

? column 1 - number of the experimental run;

? column 2 - wave condition

C1: XB1001 syntS96H93, C2: XB1001 syntS96H93 C, C3: XB1003 syntS96H93.

C1g: XB1001 syntS96H93 2gp, C2g: XB1001 syntS96H93 C 2gp,

C3g: XB1003 syntS96H93 2gp.

IG1: XB1001 LW, IG2: XB1001 LWX2,

IG3: XB1001 LWX3, IG4: XB1001 LWX4.

The wave conditions with 2gp in the name correspond to time series of only two

wave groups; all the others correspond to time series of 20 min. These time series

were repeated as wished for each experiment.)

? column 3 - pair of profiles measured at the end of each experiment;

? column 4 - duration of the wave condition;

? column 5 - cross-shore position of the twelve wave gauges during the run;

? column 6 - cross-shore and vertical (relatively to the mean water level) position(s)

of the ADV (ADV1 stands for the side-looking ADV Nortek Vectrino +);

? column 7 - other measurements performed during the experiments that are not

analysed in the scope of this thesis;

? column 8 - general observations concerning each experiment.
