RESUMO 

 

Neste trabalho estudou-se a potencial reabilitação de dois tipos de escombreiras, rica em 

sulfuretos e gossan, da mina de São Domingos usando resíduos orgânicos/inorgânicos e espécies 

vegetais com valor económico, Cistus ladanifer (esteva) e Lavandula pedunculata (rosmaninho). 

Avaliou-se o comportamento ecofisiológico das espécies em condições naturais e a qualidade de 

alguns produtos derivados das mesmas (chá/infusão de rosmaninho e bioextractos de ambas as 

espécies) face às características dos substratos onde estas crescem espontaneamente. Em 

condições controladas, avaliou-se a eficiência de Tecnossolos, elaborados com resíduos 

orgânicos/inorgânicos e de escombreiras, na melhoria da qualidade química dos lixiviados 

(percolação e simulados), para minimizar a dispersão dos contaminantes, e melhorar as 

características químicas e biológicas dos materiais para desenvolvimento de vegetação.  

Independentemente das características dos solos, ambas as espécies crescem sem sinais de 

toxicidade ou deficiência nutricional apresentando características ecofisiológicas adequadas para 

fitoestabilização. Nas duas espécies, o primeiro mecanismo de tolerância aos elementos 

potencialmente tóxicos (EPTs) do solo é a sua acumulação na raiz e baixa translocação para locais 

fotossinteticamente activos. As concentrações fitotóxicas de alguns elementos na parte aérea do 

rosmaninho não afectaram a concentração de pigmentos e proteínas nem desencadearam 

mecanismos de tolerância, enzimáticos e não enzimáticos, relacionados com stresse oxidativo. Os 

produtos derivados das plantas crescendo na área mineira apresentaram viabilidade económica para 

diferentes usos pois mantêm a sua qualidade comparada com as de áreas controlo.  

As escombreiras ricas em sulfuretos lixiviaram soluções extremamente ácidas e com maiores 

concentrações de EPTs do que as escombreiras de gossan. A metodologia mais sustentável para a 

reabilitação de ambas as escombreiras da mina de São Domingos foi o desenvolvimento de um 

sistema que combina o isolamento natural dos materiais ricos em sulfuretos, com uma barreira de 

resíduos carbonatados, e fitoestabilização com esteva e/ou rosmaninho dos Tecnossolos elaborados 

com materiais de gossan e resíduos orgânicos/inorgânicos.

ABSTRACT 

 

The potential rehabilitation of sulfides-rich and gossan wastes from São Domingos mine using 

organic/inorganic residues and plant species with economic value, Cistus ladanifer (rockrose) and 

Lavandula pedunculata (lavender) was studied in this work. The ecophysiological behaviour of both 

species under natural conditions and the quality of some plant-based products (lavender infusion and 

bioextracts of both species) were compared according to the soils characteristics where the plants 

grow spontaneously. The efficiency of Technosols, composed of wastes (organic/inorganic and mine 

materials), under controlled conditions were evaluated in order to improve the chemical quality of the 

leachates (percolated and simulated) and, consequently, minimize the dispersion of the contaminants, 

as well as to improve chemical and biological characteristics of the materials for vegetation 

development. 

Independently of soil characteristics, both species grow without signs of toxicity or nutritional 

deficiency showing appropriate ecophysiological characteristics to their use in phytostabilisation. In 

both species, the first mechanism of tolerance to potentially hazardous elements from soils is their 

storage in the roots and low translocation to shoots (sites photosynthetically actives). The phytotoxic 

concentrations of some elements in the lavender shoots did not affect concentrations of pigments and 

protein and did not trigger mechanisms of tolerance, enzymatic and non-enzymatic, related to 

oxidative stress. The products obtained from plants growing in the mining area and an 

uncontaminated place presented similar quality and, consequently, economic viability for different 

uses. 

Sufide-rich wastes leached extremely acid solutions with higher concentrations of hazardous 

elements than leachates from gossan wastes. The more sustainable approach to the rehabilitation of 

both mine wastes from São Domingos was the development of a system that combines the natural 

isolation of materials rich in sulfides, with a barrier composed of carbonated wastes, and 

phytostabilisation of Technosols done with gossan materials and organic/inorganic wastes using 

rockrose and/or lavender.

INTRODUÇÃO GERAL 



 

 



Introdução geral

A actividade mineira em Portugal, nomeadamente na Faixa Piritosa Ibérica (FPI), é antiga porém, a 

maioria das minas encontram-se, actualmente, abandonadas e constituem graves problemas 

ambientais e de saúde pública. A mina de São Domingos (SE de Portugal) é uma das minas da FPI 

que apresenta elevada perigosidade ambiental. Esta, deve-se aos grandes volumes de escombreiras 

de diferentes tipos, muitas delas instáveis, com granulometria variada, pH ácido e baixa fertilidade, 

bem como, elevadas concentrações totais de elementos potencialmente tóxicos (EPTs) que podem 

afectar a saúde humana ou a conservação dos ecossistemas através de diferentes efeitos negativos 

sobre as águas, solos e biota. Além disso, algumas das escombreiras possuem fases sólidas 

reactivas, em especial sulfuretos polimetálicos, que após oxidação geram drenagem ácida. Este 

lixiviado, para além de possuir contaminação multielementar, leva à dissolução de outras fases 

sólidas promovendo assim a dispersão de elementos potencialmente contaminantes para as áreas 

adjacentes (solos, sedimentos e águas), os quais consequentemente afectam negativamente a 

sobrevivência e/ou desenvolvimento da biodiversidade e as funções ecológicas do ecossistema. 

Assim, o problema ambiental presente na mina de São Domingos e em muitas outras áreas mineiras 

da FPI relaciona-se não só com as características extremas das escombreiras, mas também com a 

potencial geração de drenagem ácida. 

Embora nestas áreas coexistam diversos factores de stresse para as plantas, associados não só à 

actividade mineira (elevadas concentrações totais de elementos químicos nos materiais, baixos 

valores de pH e matéria orgânica), mas também às condições meteorológicas das zonas 

mediterrâneas (défice hídrico durante a maior parte do ano, elevada radiação solar e temperatura do 

ar no verão), algumas escombreiras ou solos desenvolvidos sobre estes materiais são colonizadas 

naturalmente por vegetação espontânea e pioneira. O desenvolvimento desta vegetação tolerante 

contribui para a génese de solos a partir dos materiais das escombreiras, e para a reabilitação natural 

das áreas mineiras bem como, para a evolução da sucessão ecológica.  

Das várias técnicas de reabilitação ambiental de áreas com contaminação multielementar, a 

fitoestabilização é considerada a mais eficiente e sustentável. Contudo, o sucesso do 

estabelecimento de plantas, mesmo que tolerantes e autóctones, directamente nos solos a reabilitar e 

a longo prazo pode ser um processo difícil em condições de clima árido ou semiárido. Assim, a 

implementação de um processo conjunto ou de processos independentes que melhorem as 

condições de reacção do solo, a fertilidade, a retenção de água útil e a estabilização da estrutura do 

solo, através da adição de diferentes correctivos, pode acelerar a reabilitação através da 

fitoestabilização. 

No entanto, é de salientar que a reabilitação de áreas mineiras abandonadas só será considerada, 

nos dias de hoje, se incluir não só melhorias ambientais mas também uma abordagem económica. 

Assim, tendo em conta que distintos resíduos industriais ou agro-industriais não têm qualquer 

valorização, acabando depositados em aterros ou dispostos clandestinamente no terreno, e ainda a 

directiva europeia 1999/31/EC relativa à deposição de resíduos orgânicos em aterros, a utilização de 

resíduos na reabilitação destas áreas é a solução mais sustentável. Além disso, a concepção de um 

Tecnossolo derivado de diferentes resíduos, elaborado com as características adequadas à solução 

dos diferentes problemas que limitam ou retardam a reabilitação ambiental, em vez de uso de 



Introdução geral

resíduos independentes, pode assegurar ou melhorar a recuperação a médio-longo prazo dessas 

áreas degradadas. É pois a aplicação do conceito de “Tecnossolo à la carte e à imagem dos solos 

naturais” que contribuirá para a recuperação das áreas degradadas o que inclui a reutilização 

sustentável de resíduos. 

Várias espécies de plantas e materiais orgânicos/inorgânicos tem sido sugeridos para a 

fitoestabilização de solos adjacentes às áreas mineiras ou de solos desenvolvidos sobre 

escombreiras constituídas por rochas encaixantes e/ou materiais contendo teores baixos de fases 

sólidas geradoras de acidez. Contudo, não são conhecidas, a nível nacional e internacional, soluções 

ambientais de recuperação de escombreiras de gossan e, em particular, de escombreiras ricas em 

sulfuretos, estas últimas de granulometria grosseira. 

Portanto, devido à complexidade das escombreiras/solos das áreas mineiras, principalmente nas 

ricas em sulfuretos e em condições mediterrâneas, torna-se essencial que os programas de 

reabilitação incluam uma análise química multielementar das mesmas, bem como das suas 

propriedades físico-químicas. É ainda importante o estudo detalhado de espécies vegetais e resíduos 

(agrícolas, industriais, entre outros) que existam nestas áreas. Esta informação pode ser essencial 

para usar, gerir e reabilitar estes ambientes que correspondem a focos de contaminação ambiental. A 

escolha do Cistus ladanifer L. (nome comum: esteva) e Lavandula pedunculata (Mill.) Cav (nomes 

comuns: lavandula, lavanda ou rosmaninho) deveu-se ao facto de serem espécies bem adaptadas às 

condições mediterrâneas, ocorrerem espontaneamente quer em áreas degradadas e contaminadas 

quer em áreas não-contaminadas e, além disso, possuírem valor económico. 

O presente estudo teve como objectivo principal avaliar a potencialidade de reabilitação de dois 

tipos de escombreiras de áreas mineiras abandonadas, uma rica em sulfuretos e outra de materiais 

de gossan, com recurso a resíduos orgânicos e inorgânicos de baixo valor com vista ao 

desenvolvimento das espécies C. ladanifer e L. pedunculata para a exploração de bioextractos 

vegetais. Deste modo, o trabalho teve como objectivos específicos: 

a. Avaliar a capacidade de absorção, acumulação e distribuição dos EPTs nas raízes e parte 

aérea das plantas estudadas e sua influência nas concentrações de nutrientes, face às 

concentrações de elementos existentes nos materiais das escombreiras/solos; 

b. Comparar algumas respostas fisiológicas de L. pedunculata associadas ao stresse oxidativo e 

alguns componentes envolvidos nos mecanismos de tolerância em plantas crescendo em solos com 

diferentes níveis de contaminação multielementar; 

c. Avaliar a influência dos EPTs na qualidade dos bioextractos vegetais de ambas as plantas 

estudadas e do chá/infusão de rosmaninho; 

d. Inferir sobre a potencial comercialização de produtos extraídos da esteva e rosmaninho 

usados em programas de fitoestabilização de áreas mineiras da FPI; 

e. Avaliar e comparar a eficiência de resíduos agro-industriais, de custo “zero” e facilmente 

disponíveis numa área relativamente próxima da mina de São Domingos de modo a constituir um 

Tecnossolo, na melhoria das características físico-químicas e da actividade biológica de 

escombreiras de gossan e de escombreiras ricas em sulfuretos para permitir o melhor 

desenvolvimento das espécies autóctones e espontâneas estudadas;

f.  Avaliar a eficiência dos Tecnossolos estudados (misturas dos materiais de escombreiras com 

os mesmo resíduos) nas características químicas dos lixiviados e, consequentemente, na 

minimização da dispersão da contaminação; 

g. Estudar o desenvolvimento e comportamento de absorção, acumulação e translocação dos 

elementos químicos nas plantas crescendo nos Tecnossolos estudados; 

h. Avaliar a eficiência de uma reabilitação combinada das duas escombreiras em estudo, 

através da fitoestabilização com esteva e rosmaninho e concepção de Tecnossolos elaborados com 

gossan e resíduos orgânicos/inorgânicos, e sua aplicabilidade em programas de recuperação 

ambiental em áreas mineiras da FPI. 

 

Esta tese está dividida em 12 capítulos. No Capítulo 1 consta a revisão bibliográfica sobre os 

principais conceitos científicos utilizados neste trabalho e, nos capítulos seguintes (Capítulos 2?11) 

expõem-se os resultados da investigação realizada através de artigos científicos. Os resultados estão 

agrupados em três temáticas centrais: 

i)  Estudo do sistema escombreira/solo-planta em condições naturais no qual se compara o 

comportamento ecofisiológico das plantas de C. ladanifer e L. pedunculata face às características dos 

substratos onde estas se desenvolvem espontaneamente (Capítulos 2?5); 

ii) Estudo do sistema escombreira/solo-planta em condições controladas onde se avalia a 

eficiência dos Tecnossolos, usando diferentes misturas de resíduos resultantes da agro-indústria e os 

materiais dos dois tipos de escombreira em estudo (ricas em sulfuretos ou gossan), na melhoria da 

qualidade química dos lixiviados (de percolação e simulados), de modo a minimizar a dispersão dos 

contaminantes (Capítulos 6?8)  

iii) Estudo do sistema escombreira/solo-planta em condições controladas onde se compara a 

eficiência dos Tecnossolos na melhoria das características químicas e biológicas dos materiais de 

modo a permitir o desenvolvimento de vegetação espontânea (Capítulo 9?11). 

Assim, no Capítulo 2 compara-se a variabilidade, ao nível da acumulação e translocação de EPTs 

e nutrientes (As, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb e Zn), de diferentes populações de C. ladanifer 

crescendo espontaneamente em várias áreas mineiras da FPI (Brancanes, Caveira, Chança, Lousal, 

Neves Corvo e São Domingos). 

No Capítulo 3 apresenta-se o potencial de C. ladanifer na fitoestabilização de solos, desenvolvidos 

em diferentes substratos, que contêm elementos não essenciais (Al, Ag, Ba, Bi, Cd, Sb e Sr), alguns 

deles pouco estudados. Para isto é exposto o comportamento de três populações de C. ladanifer 

colhidas nas áreas mineiras de Caveira, Lousal e São Domingos (FPI) ao nível da absorção, 

acumulação e translocação dos elementos não essenciais e a influência destes nas concentrações 

dos nutrientes e elementos benéficos (Co, Na e Se). São também tecidas considerações sobre o uso 

da esteva em programas de fitoestabilização. 

No Capítulo 4 avalia-se o comportamento do sistema solo-planta e as respostas fisiológicas de L. 

pedunculata, crescendo em solos com contaminação multielementar (mina de São Domingos) e em 

solos não contaminados, associadas ao stresse oxidativo e a vários componentes (enzimáticos e não

enzimáticos) envolvidos em mecanismos ecofisiológicos de tolerância. Isto permitiu avaliar o potencial 

desta espécie para fitoestabilização. 

No Capítulo 5 comparou-se a qualidade de alguns produtos derivados de C. ladanifer e L. 

pedunculata (chá/infusão de rosmaninho e bioextractos vegetais de ambas as espécies) face às 

concentrações, nestas plantas, de EPTs para a saúde humana. 

No Capítulo 6 avaliam-se as mudanças hidrogeoquímicas e mineralógicas, a médio prazo, face à 

aplicação de misturas de resíduos orgânicos/inorgânicos a materiais de escombreira ricos em 

sufuretos. Para isto é apresentada a variação temporal das características dos lixiviados de 

percolação e dos materiais a diferentes profundidades. 

No Capítulo 7 apresenta-se a variação multielementar de lixiviados simulados de Tecnossolos, 

preparados com materiais de gossan ou ricos em sulfuretos e misturas de resíduos 

orgânicos/inorgânicos, e o potencial risco ambiental dos mesmos, relativamente aos materiais de 

escombreira sem reabilitar, tendo em conta a concentração dos EPTs lixiviados e a massa de 

escombreiras existente na mina de São Domingos. 

No Capítulo 8 avaliou-se a eficiência da sobreposição de uma camada de gossan sobre materiais 

de escombreira rica em sulfuretos e dos Tecnossolos (estudados nos capítulos anteriores), na 

melhoria da reabilitação dos resíduos mais perigosos ao nível da actividade enzimática da 

comunidade microbiana dos materiais, qualidade química de lixiviados de percolação e germinação 

de sementes de C. ladanifer. 

No Capítulo 9 expõem-se a influência das taxas de aplicação de uma mistura de resíduos 

orgânicos/inorgânicos no Tecnossolo, contendo escombreira de gossan, na melhoria das 

características químicas e biológicas dos materiais e no crescimento de C. ladanifer. 

No Capítulo 10, que é baseado nos dados dos capítulos anteriores, apresenta-se uma reabilitação 

combinada das escombreiras em estudo, através do isolamento natural da escombreira rica em 

sulfuretos, da fitoestabilização com esteva e rosmaninho e uso de Tecnossolos. É de salientar que 

estes Tecnossolos foram elaborados com material de gossan colhido em outra escombreira, também 

da área de São Domingos mas que praticamente não apresentava rocha encaixante, e por isso 

apresentando condições mais extremas, e as misturas de resíduos onde se obteve melhor 

desenvolvimento das plantas de C. ladanifer. 

No Capítulo 11 pretendeu-se estudar o período pós-reabilitação de um solo desenvolvido sob 

materiais de gossan após aplicação de polímeros hidrofílicos de poliacrilato e crescimento de 

Spergularia purpurea (Pearson) G. Don fil. Para isto, avaliaram-se as características químicas e 

ecotoxicidade do solo bem como a colonização natural por espécies herbáceas e a germinação e 

desenvolvimento das espécies arbustivas em estudo. 

Face aos resultados obtidos em todo o trabalho realizado, no Capítulo 12 enunciam-se algumas 

conclusões finais.

1.1 ACTIVIDADE MINEIRA 

 

Os depósitos minerais, produto de um ou mais ciclos geoquímicos, têm sido, desde tempos 

imemoriais, uma fonte económica muito importante para o Homem. 

Ao longo da história, a actividade mineira, quer desenvolvida a céu aberto ou em lavra 

subterrânea, originou diferentes tipos de escombreiras resultantes da extracção e processamento do 

minério e seu encaixante e, ainda, a circulação de lixiviados enriquecidos em elementos 

potencialmente tóxicos (EPTs) para o meio (Matos e Martins, 2006; Wong, 2003). As escombreiras 

produzidas são, usualmente, de grande volumetria, instáveis, com granulometria variada, baixo valor 

de pH e fertilidade e elevadas concentrações totais de metais e metalóides (Abreu e Magalhães, 

2009; Freitas et al., 2004a; Matos e Martins, 2006; Wong, 2003). Além disso, as escombreiras com 

textura grosseira apresentam baixa capacidade de retenção de água incrementando, ainda mais, o 

forte xerofitismo climático, factor que condiciona a sobrevivência das plantas durante a época seca. 

Estas características conduzem à modificação das características físicas, químicas e biológicas dos 

solos adjacentes às áreas mineiras ou dos solos desenvolvidos sobre estes materiais que, 

consequentemente, afectam a colonização e desenvolvimento da vegetação. Neste sentido, a 

camada superficial dos solos fica sujeita a um maior risco dos processos erosivos (Abreu e 

Magalhães, 2009; Freitas et al., 2004a; Tordoff et al., 2000). 

De um modo geral, este tipo de actividade e seu abandono podem induzir efeitos directos e 

indirectos no meio sendo que o clima, temperado a árido/semiárido, contribui para uma potenciação 

destes efeitos (Mendez e Maier, 2008). Como efeitos directos indicam-se a perda de solo e o 

decréscimo da biodiversidade específica ou funcional enquanto nos efeitos indirectos se inclui o 

impacto paisagístico e a degradação e contaminação dos solos, sedimentos, águas e ar que, 

consequentemente, conduzem à ruptura das funções ecológicas essenciais dos sistemas (Wong, 

2003). De facto, a toxicidade dos elementos químicos bem como a diminuição do pH como 

consequência da natureza dos materiais de escombreiras pode afectar o número, diversidade e a 

actividade da comunidade microbiana do solo inibindo os processos biogeoquímicos (Hinojosa et al., 

2008; Wong, 2003). Dependendo dos elementos e da sua mobilidade, estes podem ser 

bioacumulados ao longo da cadeia alimentar determinando ainda consequências deletérias nos 

diferentes níveis tróficos. 

A exploração mineira de sulfuretos maciços polimetálicos é uma das que apresenta maiores 

problemas ambientais. A existência de fases sólidas reactivas, como são os sulfuretos, e a sua 

contínua oxidação, química e bioquímica, conduz à geração de drenagem ácida de mina (AMD – acid 

mine drainage) a qual está enriquecida em sulfatos bem como EPTs (Abreu et al., 2010a; Álvarez-

Valero et al., 2009; Romero et al., 2010; Sanchéz-España, 2008; Sanchéz-España et al., 2005, 2006). 

Segundo os mesmos autores, a composição química da AMD é extremamente variável dependendo 

do tipo de depósito e época do ano porém, pode incluir EPTs como o As, Fe, Cu e Zn (Quadro 1). 

Em ambiente mediterrâneo e especialmente nos períodos secos de primavera e verão, é usual a 

formação de eflorescências de sais solúveis à superfície ou nos poros dos materiais (ex. sulfatos de 

Al, Fe e Mg com diferentes níveis de hidratação, como a epsomite [MgSO4•7H2O], a melanterite 



Actividade mineira

[FeSO4•7H2O], e a copiapite [Fe
2+

Fe4
3+

(SO4)6(OH)2•20H2O]) devido à evaporação da AMD nos poros 

dos materiais (Abreu et al., 2010a; Álvarez-Valero et al., 2008, 2009; Ferreira da Silva et al., 2015; 

Sanchéz-España, 2008; Sanchéz-España et al., 2005; Valente e Gomes, 2009). Segundo estes 

autores, estes sais apresentam hidrólise acidificante e funcionam como “fontes de retenção” de 

elementos químicos porém, após as primeiras chuvas, redissolvem-se enriquecendo 

significativamente a AMD com elementos alterando a sua composição. 

A AMD provoca também alterações no ecossistema envolvente devido ao seu pH ser 

frequentemente baixo (&amp;lt;3) contribuindo, em geral, para incrementar a dissolução de fases sólidas 

contendo EPTs e também o seu transporte (Abreu et al., 2010a; Ferreira da Silva et al., 2013; 

Romero et al., 2010; Sanchéz-España, 2008). A área de dispersão depende de outros factores, como 

a hidrologia, a geomorfologia e o clima da área, e das características dos elementos químicos 

podendo atingir distâncias consideráveis em relação à origem (Bleeker et al., 2002). Uma dispersão 

da contaminação, através das partículas finas de material de escombreira e da AMD, até 2500 m a 

jusante do local da mina foi referida por Romero et al. (2010). Por outro lado, Sanchéz-España et al. 

(2005) indicaram que a contaminação associada às áreas mineiras da FPI Espanhola afecta uma 

área extremamente ampla, entre 104 de 122 km, do curso principal do rio Odiel. 

Em suma, este tipo de exploração e o seu abandono tem forte probabilidade de ser uma fonte de 

contaminação e degradação do ambiente envolvente, caso não sejam tomadas medidas adequadas 

de gestão ambiental. No entanto, as áreas mineiras podem ser um nicho ecológico para a 

colonização/evolução de novas espécies, como é o caso da Erica andevalensis Cabezudo &amp;amp; Rivera 

espécie endémica das áreas mineiras da FPI (Abreu et al., 2008; Cabezudo e Rivera, 1980), ou de 

ecótipos.

1.2 FAIXA PIRITOSA IBÉRICA: ÁREA MINEIRA DE SÃO DOMINGOS 

 

A Faixa Piritosa Ibérica (FPI) é um dos mais importantes e antigos depósitos de sulfuretos maciços 

vulcanogénicos do mundo estando localizada a sudoeste da Península Ibérica (Matos e Martins, 

2006). Estende-se ao longo de 250 km, desde a Marateca (região do Alentejo ? Portugal) até Sevilha 

(Espanha), sendo caracterizada pela existência de grandes depósitos de sulfuretos polimetálicos que 

podem atingir mais de 200 Tg, como é o caso de Neves Corvo, Aljustrel e Rio Tinto (Barriga et al., 

1997; Matos e Martins, 2003, 2006; Sáez et al., 1999; Tornos, 2006). A actividade mineira nesta área 

está distribuída por mais de 80 minas, algumas delas com indícios de exploração há mais de 5000 

anos (ex. área mineira de Rio Tinto; Ortiz, 2003). Apesar do impacte ambiental de todas as áreas 

mineiras da FPI ser significativo, as da parte espanhola apresentam uma maior área afectada (Matos 

e Martins, 2006). 

Na parte portuguesa da FPI (FPIP) existem várias áreas mineiras nas quais a extracção foi feita, 

principalmente, a partir do gossan e dos sulfuretos maciços polimetálicos, no entanto actualmente 

quase na sua totalidade estão abandonadas (Matos e Martins, 2006). Actualmente, Aljustrel e Neves 

Corvo são as únicas que estão operacionais. 

A actividade extractiva nas explorações abandonadas da FPIP decorreu mais intensamente nos 

séculos XIX e XX, sem quaisquer medidas de gestão ambiental devido à ausência de legislação e 

consciência ambiental, contudo o impacte no meio é de longo prazo já que houve vários períodos 

intermitentes de exploração (Abreu et al., 2010a; Matos e Martins, 2006; Quental et al., 2002). O grau 

de perigosidade ambiental varia consoante a área mineira e tem em conta, principalmente, a tipologia 

das mineralizações, a volumetria das escombreiras e a sua estabilidade, e as concentrações de EPTs 

nos materiais das escombreiras bem como o impacte existente nos solos/sedimentos, na rede 

hidrográfica e na paisagem (Matos e Martins, 2006; Oliveira et al., 2002). 

Na mina de São Domingos (SE da FPI, concelho de Mértola), a actividade mineira iniciou-se na 

época pré-romana com a exploração de Ag, Au e Cu a partir do gossan, contudo no século XIX a 

extracção baseou-se principalmente no Cu e S dos sulfuretos maciços, apesar de também ser 

explorado Au, Pb e Zn tanto do gossan e como dos sulfuretos. Já no século XX e até 1966, data de 

encerramento da mina, a evolução da indústria do ácido sulfúrico promoveu a extracção do S a partir 

da pirite e o aumento da exploração de alguns minérios (Quental et al., 2002). A actividade cessou 

principalmente por questões económicas e sociais, nomeadamente esgotamento do minério (Abreu et 

al., 2010a; Quental et al., 2002). 

Apesar do depósito ser caracterizado de médio porte, a sua longa história de mineração contribuiu 

para a existência de diferentes resíduos e um impacte ambiental que não se resume ao foco de 

exploração mineira mas também, a uma vasta faixa que abrange cerca de 50 km
2
 (Matos et al., 2006; 

Quental et al., 2002). Na área mineira de São Domingos, os diversos materiais de escombreira 

expostos estimam-se em aproximadamente 32 Tg (Fig. 1) e resultaram da extracção (gossan e rocha 

encaixante e dos sulfuretos maciços) e do processamento do minério (aterros industriais, britados de 

pirite, cinzas de fundição, escórias modernas e romanas, óxidos de ferro e tanques de decantação) e 

apresentam concentrações totais de EPTs que podem ultrapassar 10 g/kg de As ou de Pb e 2 g/kg de 



Faixa Piritosa Ibérica: área mineira de São Domingos

Sb, atingindo também o Cu, Cd e Zn 2,74 g/kg, 159 mg/kg e 8,9 g/kg, respectivamente (Álvarez-

Valero et al., 2008; Pérez-López et al., 2008). Estes mesmos autores, tendo em conta a relação 

massa/volume e a concentração total ou disponível (extraída com ácido acético) dos EPTs das 

escombreiras, avaliaram a sua perigosidade categorizando-as segundo uma escala. Assim, tendo em 

conta que apenas a fracção disponível apresenta um real risco ambiental, Pérez-López et al. (2008) 

classificou o gossan e os britados de pirite como o quarto e quinto, respectivamente, tipos de 

resíduos mais perigosos na mina de São Domingos.

al., 2008).

Os solos das zonas adjacentes e desenvolvidos sobre materiais de escombreira apresentam 

também contaminação multielementar com elevadas concentrações totais de alguns elementos 

químicos (Quadro 2), os quais ultrapassam os valores máximos admissíveis para diferentes usos do 

solo (CCME, 2007), mas com baixa disponibilidade dos mesmos (extraída com diferentes soluções) e 

pH entre ácido a ligeiramente neutro (Abreu et al., 2008, 2012a,b; Alvarenga et al., 2012, 2014; 

González-Fernández et al., 2011; Pérez-López et al, 2014; Santos et al., 2012). Além disso, 

diferentes bioensaios mostraram que alguns solos também possuem um nível de ecotoxicidade 

relevante (Alvarenga et al., 2012).  

No entanto, o problema ambiental presente na área mineira de São Domingos, e em muitas outras 

áreas mineiras da FPI, relaciona-se não só com as características extremas das escombreiras e dos 

solos mas também com a potencial geração de drenagem ácida (Abreu et al., 2010a; Álvarez-Valero 

et al., 2008; Pérez-López et al, 2008; Quental et al., 2002). Esta AMD contém elevadas 

concentrações de EPTs que rondam 1,48 g Al/L, 4,21 g Fe/L, 2448 g Zn/L e 7,7 g SO4/L (Abreu et al., 

2008). Devido à variabilidade sazonal, a AMD pode atingir concentrações de 416,8 mg Al/L, 24,8 mg 

As/L, 2,0 mg Cd/L, 182,6 mg Cu/L, 2,95 g Fe/L, 2,2 mg Pb/L, 226 mg Zn/L e 13,9 g SO4/L (dados não 

publicados). A lixiviação das várias escombreiras, principalmente nas primeiras chuvas, conduz a um 

impacte negativo na ribeira de São Domingos, afluente do rio Chança e que drena a área mineira 

(Matos e Martins, 2006). 

Segundo a classificação da perigosidade ambiental em áreas mineiras da FPIP, a mina de São 

Domingos apresenta o nível máximo (Matos e Martins, 2006) sendo evidente a necessidade de 

recuperação ambiental da mesma.

1.3 DISPONIBILIDADE DOS ELEMENTOS QUÍMICOS E SUA TOXICIDADE 

 

Os elementos químicos existentes no solo podem ter origem natural, devido à meteorização da 

rocha onde estão presentes, ou estar associados às actividades antrópicas, nomeadamente a 

actividade mineira. Os solos desenvolvidos sobre materiais de escombreiras (Tecnossolos; IUSS 

Working Group WRB, 2007), ou contaminados por deposição de lamas, material particulado ou 

escórias de pirite ou de outros resíduos industriais, são também afectados pelas características 

desses materiais. Porém, a composição química dos solos naturais está dependente das 

características da rocha original e das condições climáticas (Kabata-Pendias, 2011), entre outros 

parâmetros. 

O conteúdo total de elementos químicos no solo/escombreira é, em regra, apenas um indicador da 

sua contaminação pois, a concentração dos elementos existentes no meio pode não corresponder e, 

mesmo, não estar relacionada com a fracção realmente disponível para os organismos (Adriano, 

2001; Kabata-Pendias, 2011). Contudo, este valor é usado em diversos países como parâmetro, na 

maioria da legislação, para a protecção e qualidade do solo. 

Os elementos químicos no solo estão associados a distintos componentes que se encontram 

distribuídos pelas diferentes fases do solo (ex. carbonatos, matéria orgânica, óxidos de ferro e 

manganês, minerais com solubilidade muito baixa - fase residual) ligando-se através de vários 

mecanismos, muitas vezes complexos e variados, tais como adsorção, troca iónica, co-precipitação e 

complexação (Brümmer, 1986). Apenas os elementos associados à fase líquida, constituindo a 

fracção solúvel, e ao complexo de troca de colóides inorgânicos e orgânicos estão disponíveis para 

os organismos, variando no espaço e no tempo (Adriano et al., 2004; Kabata-Pendias, 2004). 

Análises de fraccionamento, via sequencial (Berti e Jacobs, 1996; Rauret et al., 1999; Tessier et 

al., 1979) ou por extracção parciais (Adriano et al., 2004), são muitas vezes realizadas para avaliar a 

redistribuição dos elementos pelas distintas fases do solo (Abreu et al., 2009, 2010b, 2012a; Lázaro 

et al., 2006; Pérez-López et al., 2008; Santos et al., 2012) e, consequentemente, avaliar a 

disponibilidade real ou potencial dos mesmos (Kabata-Pendias, 2004). Para a determinação da 

fracção disponível para as plantas, diferentes metodologias têm sido definidas (Feng et al., 2005; 

Kabata-Pendias 2004, 2011; Lindsay e Norvell, 1978; Meers et al., 2007; Schollenberger e Simon, 

1945) porém, estas extracções baseiam-se, principalmente, em testes de solo (McLaughlin et al., 

2000) não dando uma indicação sobre o sistema solo-planta na zona da rizosfera (Kabata-Pendias, 

2011). De acordo com alguns autores (Feng et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2004), as espécies vegetais são 

um factor importante a ter em conta. Além disso, a fracção disponível varia com a solução aquosa 

extractante, elemento e as características do solo não mostrando usualmente um padrão regular 

(Adriano et al., 2004; Anjos et al., 2012; Lázaro et al., 2006; Meers et al., 2007; Kabata-Pendias 2004; 

Santos et al., 2012).  

Vários factores podem regular a disponibilidade dos elementos, nomeadamente físicos (ex. 

constituição da fracção coloidal), químicos (ex. pH e condições de oxi-redução), biológicos (ex. 

actividade microbiana na área da rizosfera ou exsudados das raízes) e a interacção entre os mesmos 

(Bolan et al., 2014; Ernst, 1996; Kabata-Pendias, 2004; Hinsinger et al., 2006) (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2 Esquema de possíveis factores que influenciam a disponibilidade dos elementos químicos nos solos 

(Adaptado de Adriano et al., 2004). 

 

Os baixos valores de pH dos lixiviados ou dos materiais das áreas mineiras, especialmente as de 

sulfuretos, podem promover um aumento da disponibilidade dos elementos no meio (Dinelli e 

Lombini, 1996; Hinojosa et al., 2008). 

Para certa gama de pH, a disponibilidade também é dependente de outros parâmetros 

nomeadamente da presença de oxi-hidróxidos de ferro e manganês. Estes compostos têm a 

capacidade de adsorver os elementos, através da formação de complexos de esfera interna, ou 

oxidar directamente ou catalisar a oxidação de outros elementos (ex. Cr e As) conduzindo, deste 

modo, a uma diminuição da disponibilidade dos elementos (Bolan et al., 2004; Dinelli e Lombini, 1996; 

McBride, 1989). O possível papel dos oxi-hidróxidos de ferro na retenção de aniões, por exemplo o 

As, é indicado por vários autores (Bolan et al., 2014; Kabata-Pendias, 2011). 

O conteúdo de matéria orgânica pode também reduzir a disponibilidade dos elementos devido à 

presença de grupos quelatantes, aumento da capacidade de troca catiónica ou mudança do estado 

de oxidação de alguns elementos (Adriano, 2001; Kabata-Pendias, 2011; Tejada et al., 2008). De 

facto, a aplicação de diferentes resíduos orgânicos (ex. composto de resíduos sólidos urbanos ? 

RSU, biossólido ou lamas de estação de tratamento de águas residuais ? ETAR) em solos 

contaminados pode diminuir a concentração de elementos na fracção disponível, usualmente catiões 

(Pérez-de-Mora et al., 2005). Contudo, é de salientar que a extensão da formação dos complexos 

organo-metálicos depende de factores como a temperatura, tipo de matéria orgânica e concentração 

dos elementos na solução do solo (Bolan et al., 2014). Neste contexto, Tejada et al. (2008) verificou 

que, apesar da adição de alguns resíduos orgânicos (composto de restos da cultura do algodão - 

crushed cotton gin, e estrume de galinha) a um solo contaminado artificialmente com doses 

crescentes de Ni diminuir o efeito inibitório deste elemento na actividade enzimática e na biomassa 

microbiana, o ED50 (ecological dose: concentração do elemento para a qual a actividade biológica é 

reduzido 50 %) era maior no tratamento com o composto. Este facto parece relacionar-se ao maior 

conteúdo de ácidos húmicos neste resíduo e, consequentemente, maior capacidade de adsorção de 

Ni (comparativamente ao outro resíduo que apresentava maior conteúdo de ácidos fúlvicos) (Tejada 

et al., 2008). É ainda de salientar que o aumento do conteúdo de carbono orgânico dissolvido (DOC) 



Disponibilidade dos elementos químicos e sua toxicidade 
 

19  

pode aumentar a disponibilidade do As e, durante o processo de mineralização da matéria orgânica, 

os elementos podem ser libertados novamente para o meio (Bolan et al., 2014). 

A presença de plantas e de toda a comunidade microbiana associada à rizosfera também pode 

afectar a disponibilidade dos elementos no meio. No entanto, esta influência mútua é complexa e 

pouco conhecida (Barceló e Poschenrieder, 2003). As plantas absorvem os iões do solo mas também 

podem acidificar a solução do solo na zona da rizosfera, através da exsudação de iões H
+ 

e da 

respiração das células deste órgão, o que, consequentemente, aumenta a disponibilidade dos 

elementos (Ali et al., 2013; Hinsinger et al., 2006). Por outro lado, também são exsudados diferentes 

compostos orgânicos de baixa massa molecular que aumentam ou diminuem a disponibilidade dos 

elementos devido a contribuírem para a dissolução de algumas fases sólidas ou funcionarem como 

complexantes (Bienfait et al., 1982; Hinsinger et al., 2006). De um modo geral, todas estas variações 

ao nível da rizosfera permitem disponibilizar os nutrientes aquando de desequilíbrio nutricional da 

planta ou reduzir a disponibilidade de EPTs. 

Alterações na qualidade dos solos/escombreiras podem ser medidos através de diferentes 

indicadores associados aos processos e características físicas, químicas e biológicas dos mesmos 

(Araújo et al., 2007; Martínez-Salgado et al., 2010). A determinação dos elementos na fracção 

disponível do meio (solúvel + complexo de troca), através de uma extracção química, continua a ser o 

indicador chave na avaliação do potencial risco ambiental e de saúde humana ou da qualidade do 

substrato, especialmente para locais contaminados, mas esta pode variar como indicado 

anteriormente. Além disso, esta análise não é suficiente para avaliar os efeitos ecotoxicológicos nos 

organismos e na sua actividade biológica pois, não considera as interacções entre contaminantes, o 

efeito da matriz e o biota. Logo, qualquer estratégia para avaliação ambiental também deve 

considerar a realização de bioensaios (Abreu et al., 2014a; Alvarenga et al., 2008a,b, 2012; Adriano 

et al., 2004; García-Lorenzo et al, 2009; Rocha et al., 2011) que, preferencialmente, incluam 

organismos de diferentes níveis tróficos e compartimentos terrestres e aquáticos, e/ou indicadores de 

funcionamento do solo (Hinojosa et al., 2008). 

Também as enzimas do solo catalisam diferentes reacções bioquímicas envolvidas nos processos 

de mineralização e de ciclagem dos nutrientes, podendo a sua actividade ser afectada mais 

rapidamente pela contaminação ou mudanças de gestão do solo que outras características químicas 

dos materiais (Araújo et al., 2007; Bandick e Dick, 1999; Belyaeva et al., 2005; de Varennes et al., 

2009; Martinez-Salgado et al., 2010). Vários trabalhos mostram os rápidos efeitos deletérios dos 

elementos químicos sobre as actividades enzimáticas do solo após contaminação artificial de solos 

com soluções padrão (Belyaeva et al., 2005; Tejada et al., 2008) ou por resíduos de mina (Hinojosa et 

al., 2008; Pérez-de-Mora et al., 2005). Por outro lado, apesar das variações sazonais normais da 

comunidade microbiana do solo, vários autores (Hinojosa et al., 2008; Pérez-de-Mora et al., 2005; de 

Varennes et al., 2010) avaliam a reabilitação de solos contaminados após aplicação de correctivos 

orgânicos através da actividade enzimática.

Concentração dos elementos químicos nas plantas e respostas ecofisiológicas

1.4 CONCENTRAÇÃO DOS ELEMENTOS QUÍMICOS NAS PLANTAS E RESPOSTAS 

ECOFISIOLÓGICAS 

 

A composição química das plantas é a resposta a um conjunto de parâmetros, designadamente a 

disponibilidade dos elementos no solo (associados à fracção solúvel e ao complexo de troca) ou a 

deposição atmosférica, e pela capacidade de absorver e transferir os mesmos elementos para as 

diferentes partes da planta através dos seus vasos condutores (Kabata-Pendias, 2011). Assim, a 

composição química das plantas nem sempre reflecte as concentrações dos elementos no meio, 

nomeadamente concentrações totais ou disponíveis dos elementos no solo. De facto, a absorção, 

translocação e acumulação dos elementos nas plantas pode variar com a espécie, ecótipo, 

população, idade da planta (ou fase de crescimento) e elemento em questão (Abreu et al., 2012a,b; 

Conesa et al., 2006; Freitas et al., 2004a,b, 2009; González-Fernández et al., 2011; Kabata-Pendias, 

2011; Kidd et al., 2004; Lázaro et al., 2006; Santos et al., 2012). É de salientar que algumas 

condições meterológicas (ou sazonais) também afectam estes mecanismos, tais como o regime 

hídrico e a temperatura do ar, e desequilibrios nutricionais (Kabata-Pendias, 2011), nomeadamente 

as que ocorrem em áreas áridas e semiáridas. Por outro lado, as plantas desenvolveram durante a 

sua evolução vários mecanismos que resultaram na adaptação e tolerância a novos meios ou a 

meios quimicamente desequilibrados (ex. nutricionalmente ou pela contaminação) (Kabata Pendias, 

2004, 2011). 

Do ponto de vista biológico, os elementos podem categorizar-se em dois grandes grupos segundo 

as funções que exercem no metabolismo: os nutrientes (ou elementos essenciais) e os elementos 

não essenciais (ou potencialmente tóxicos) (Adriano, 2001). Apesar dos mecanismos de absorção 

pelas raízes poderem ser regulados pela selecção biológica dos elementos, estes processos podem 

ser limitados perante o elemento (Kabata-Pendias, 2011). Assim, a raiz pode actuar como barreira 

impedindo a passagem de alguns elementos, contudo outros elementos não-essenciais, devido a 

possuírem o mesmo estado de valência ou raio iónico semelhante, podem competir efectivamente e 

entrar nas raízes pelos mesmos transportadores transmembranares (Ghosh e Singh, 2005; Hodson, 

2012; Kabata-Pendias, 2011). De facto, é conhecido que, por exemplo, o As(V) funciona como um 

análogo do P sendo absorvido pelas plantas através do sistema transportador do P (Bolan et al., 

2014; Hodson, 2012). 

Após a absorção, os nutrientes são usualmente translocados para a parte aérea, onde são 

incluídos nas diferentes vias metabólicas, enquanto que os elementos não essenciais são retidos nas 

raízes contudo, em alguns casos pode-se observar o contrário. Vários trabalhos mostram esta 

variabilidade intra e inter-específica nos comportamentos de absorção e translocação face à 

importância metabólica dos elementos (Abreu et al., 2012b; Alvarenga et al., 2004; de la Fuente et al., 

2010; Kidd et al., 2004; Trigueros et al., 2012). 

Ao nível da acumulação nos tecidos fotossinteticamente activos os elementos essenciais, 

nomeadamente os micronutrientes, podem também ser tóxicos quando a sua concentração 

ultrapassa a gama de tolerância. Este intervalo de concentração difere com a espécie, elemento ou 



Concentração dos elementos químicos nas plantas e respostas ecofisiológicas 

22 

 

mesmo estado de oxidação (Kabata-Pendias, 2011), sendo a gama de tolerância considerada como a 

gama de concentração para a qual o crescimento e desenvolvimento de determinada espécie são 

máximos. 

Em condições de stresse, como é toxicidade por metais/metalóides, vários processos podem ser 

afectados devido a um aumento da produção de espécies reactivas de oxigénio (ROS – reactive 

oxigen species) e sua acumulação nas células. A amplitude da resposta depende da intensidade e 

tempo de exposição ao elemento, formas químicas existentes no solo e espécie da planta (Bourrelier 

et al., 1998). 

A redução do crescimento (ex. comprimento e biomassa da parte aérea) e o aparecimento de 

cloroses ou necroses são alguns dos efeitos visuais de toxicidade referenciados (Adriano, 2001; Cao 

et al., 2004; Kabata-Pendias, 2011; Nadgórska-Socha et al., 2013). No entanto, em algumas espécies 

(ex. Erica andevalensis; Cistus ladanifer; Nerium oleander L.) podem não ser evidentes os sinais 

visuais de toxicidade, apesar de estarem a ser afectados negativamente alguns processos fisiológicos 

(ex. alteração do teor de água, diminuição dos conteúdos em clorofilas, desequilíbrio da composição 

elementar) pelos ROS produzidos pelo excesso de elementos acumulados nos tecidos (Kidd et al., 

2004; Mingorance et al., 2012; Santos et al., 2013; Trigueros et al., 2012). Os ROS são compostos 

altamente oxidantes que provocam danos significativos ao nível fisiológico e celular (ex. processos de 

transporte, fotossíntese, estrutura das membranas, peroxidação lipídica ou desnaturação de 

proteínas) (Zitka et al., 2013). 

Quando uma planta está sob stresse, face a concentrações de elementos acima da sua gama de 

óptimo, podem desencadear-se uma série de mecanismos de tolerância (Abreu et al., 2014). Além 

disso, os elementos químicos acumulados na planta podem conduzir a uma série de efeitos de 

antagonismo e sinergismo (Kabata-Pendias, 2011). A tolerância pode desencadear-se por estratégias 

de exclusão, desintoxicação ou tolerância bioquímica (Baker, 1981; Baker e Walker, 1990; Barceló e 

Poschenrieder, 2003; Levitt, 1980). Segundo estes autores, a estratégia de exclusão é caracterizada 

como a restrição da absorção dos elementos através da exsudação de compostos orgânicos, 

limitação da sua translocação para a parte aérea e locais fotossinteticamente activos, e/ou 

acumulação dos elementos nas folhas mais velhas que senescem e depois caem. Ao nível da raiz, os 

elementos químicos podem ser acumulados no interior ou sobre a superfície das raízes sendo o 

plasmalema a primeira barreira para a selecção e o controlo da absorção (Adriano, 2001). Sharma 

and Dubey (2005) referiram que, em alguns casos, a retenção de Pb nas raízes é baseado na sua 

precipitação extracelular sob a forma de fosfatos e carbonatos de Pb, acumulados nas paredes 

celulares, e devido à sua ligação em sítios permutáveis sobre as células. Vários estudos realizados 

com plantas crescendo em áreas mineiras ou em hidroponia com concentrações crescentes de EPTs 

mostraram uma limitação da translocação dos elementos devido à retenção dos mesmos 

principalmente na raiz (Kidd et al., 2004; Pérez-López et al., 2014; Rossini Oliva et al., 2009; 

Santibáñez et al., 2008; Santos et al., 2009; Trigueros et al., 2012). Por outro lado, a acumulação 

progressiva de As, Pb e Zn com o desenvolvimento das folhas de C. ladanifer ou de As e W em 

folhas de Pinus pinaster Aiton, crescendo em áreas mineiras, leva a que as folhas senescentes 

tenham as maiores concentrações (Favas et al., 2014; Santos et al., 2013). 



Concentração dos elementos químicos nas plantas e respostas ecofisiológicas 

23 
 

 

A quelatação dos elementos na parede celular ou no citoplasma e compartimentação dos mesmos 

no vacúolo, principalmente da parte aérea, funcionam como mecanismos de desintoxicação e de 

redução da disponibilidade dos mesmos nos processos metabólicos essenciais (Barceló e 

Poschenrieder, 2003). A localização de Pb e Fe maioritariamente na raiz de E. andevalensis confirma 

que a imobilização ao nível deste órgão, nomeadamente em alguns tecidos (Pb: tecidos da epiderme 

da raiz; Fe: parede celular da epiderme da raiz), funciona como principal mecanismo de tolerância 

para que as vias metabólicas sensíveis da parte aérea não sejam afectadas (Mingorance et al., 2012; 

Rossini Oliva et al., 2009). Ainda para a mesma espécie, Trigueros et al. (2012) observou uma maior 

concentração de Cu e Pb na casca da raiz que na parte interior (cortex e sistema vascular) do mesmo 

órgão. 

Por último, a tolerância bioquímica é assinalada pela presença de vias metabólicas especializadas 

relacionadas com a síntese ou estimulação de componentes enzimáticos e não-enzimáticos que 

removem e/ou neutralizar os ROS (Abreu et al., 2014b). A estimulação da actividade de diferentes 

enzimas (catálase ? CAT, superóxido dismutase – SOD, peroxidase – POD) como resposta ao 

stresse oxidativo provocado pela acumulação de concentrações elevadas de EPTs, em plantas 

crescendo naturalmente em áreas mineiras ou em ensaios com solos contaminados, é referenciado 

por vários autores (Cao et al., 2004; Márquez-García e Córdoba, 2009; Nadgórska-Socha et al., 2013; 

Pang et al., 2003; Santos et al., 2009; S?omka et al., 2008). 

Em geral, a actividade de enzimas antioxidativas aumenta até conteúdos de elementos toleráveis 

e, quando as concentrações excedem este nível uma diminuição subsequente da actividade das 

enzimas ocorre (Cao et al., 2004). Isto acontece devio à existência de um desequilíbrio entre a 

geração de ROS e a sua desintoxicação. A existência de uma interligação funcional entre diferentes 

enzimas também é referenciada, sendo que, por exemplo, a SOD é o maior eliminador de ROS cuja 

transformação gera H2O2 enquanto a CAT e a POD estão envolvidas na remoção de H2O2 gerado 

pela SOD (Abreu et al., 2014b; Cao et al., 2004; Grant e Loake, 2000). Algumas enzimas podem 

ainda estar presentes em diferentes localizações dentro da célula da planta (ex. em solução nos 

meios aquosos da célula ou ligada a componentes da parede celular através de interacções 

electrostáticas) sugerindo diferentes funções fisiológicas, como observado para o C. ladanifer (Santos 

et al., 2009). 

Vários componentes não enzimáticos, tais como tióis totais, prolina, glutationas, entre outros, são 

indicados como eficazes inibidores de ROS ou como constituintes capazes de se ligar a iões 

metálicos formando complexos menos tóxicos (Abreu et al., 2014b; Ali et la., 2013; Tekli? et al., 2008; 

Zitka et al., 2013). De facto, o aumento dos teores de tióis totais, glutationase e prolina é indicado 

como mecanismos de tolerância face ao aumento de Ni e Zn em folhas e caules de Vicia faba L. 

cultivadas em solo contaminado artificialmente (Nadgórska-Socha et al., 2013). Por outro lado, Cao et 

al. (2004) registaram tendência semelhante entre o conteúdo de antioxidantes não enzimáticos 

(glutationas e tióis) e o aumento das concentrações de As no solo e, consequentemente, maior 

conteúdo do mesmo elemento na raiz e folhas de Pteris vittata L..

1.5 TECNOLOGIAS DE REABILITAÇÃO DE SOLOS/ESCOMBREIRAS CONTAMINADOS 

COM ELEMENTOS QUÍMICOS 

  

Uma vez que os elementos químicos não se degradam, estes acumulam-se no meio e, 

consequentemente, provocam efeitos deletérios nos organismos e nas funções dos ecossistemas. 

Além disso, muitos são os efeitos nocivos dos elementos químicos na saúde humana (Ali et al., 

2013). Assim, é evidente a necessidade de remediação/reabilitação dos meios 

degradados/contaminados. 

Para reabilitação de solos contaminados por metais e metalóides existem várias tecnologias (Ali et 

al., 2013; Bech et al., 2014; Khan et al., 2004). Para a sua selecção é fundamental possuir o máximo 

de informação sobre o problema (ex. distribuição da contaminação) bem como, a caracterização do 

local (ex. geológica, climática e geomorfológica) e dos materiais (ex. composição química) (Bech et 

al., 2014). O custo e a eficiência da técnica são factores que, evidentemente, têm que ser tidos em 

conta. 

As tecnologias convencionais são baseadas em processos físico-químicos associados à 

engenharia (ex. encapsulação, vitrificação, tratamento electrocinético, entre outras) apresentando 

grandes limitações, nomeadamente elevado custo de implementação, mudanças irreversíveis nas 

características do solo (ex. estrutura, fertilidade, comunidade microbiana/microflora) e necessidade de 

restauração do local, sendo apropriada apenas em pequenas áreas (Abreu e Magalhães, 2009; 

Adriano et al., 2004; Barceló e Poschenrieder, 2003; Khan et al., 2004). Além disso, algumas técnicas 

também podem conduzir a uma contaminação secundária (Ali et al., 2013; Ghosh e Singh, 2005). 

Estas limitações ainda se acentuam mais aquando da reabilitação de áreas com contaminação 

multielementar e com materiais geradores de drenagem ácida (ex. solo/escombreiras das áreas 

mineiras da FPI) sendo a eficiência muito baixa a médio prazo.  

Segundo Sáinz et al. (2003), a geração de drenagem ácida na FPI é um problema ambiental grave 

sendo o seu tratamento insustentável devido à sua extrema acidez, concentrações multielementares 

elevadas bem como à existência de uma vasta área de escombreiras geradoras de AMD. De facto, 

nas últimas décadas a Junta da Andaluzia fez um considerável investimento na remediação e 

reabilitação de algumas escombreiras com vista à redução do impacto ambiental da AMD, porém 

estas tentativas foram ineficazes (Sanchéz-España et al., 2005). 

Das outras técnicas existentes, designadas em alguns casos como tecnologias verdes ou eco-

friendly (globalmente designadas por fitorremediação ou fitotecnologias), são usadas plantas no 

processo de reabilitação, o qual tem um menor custo de implementação comparativamente às 

técnicas indicadas anteriormente (Ali et al., 2013; Barceló e Poschenrieder, 2003; Mendez e Maier, 

2008). De um modo geral, as técnicas de fitorremediação (Fig. 3) baseiam-se no uso de plantas in 

situ (o que envolve inevitavelmente também a comunidade de microorganismos da rizosfera) para 

reduzir e/ou estabilizar os elementos existentes no meio (solos, águas ou sedimentos) e, 

consequentemente, o seu efeito tóxico para ambiente (Barceló e Poschenrieder, 2003; Favas et al., 

2014).

De entre as fitotecnologias, a fitoestabilização é a que maior eficiência apresenta na reabilitação 

de áreas mineiras com contaminação multielementar em climas temperados, áridos e semiáridos 

(Abreu e Magalhães, 2009; Mendez e Maier, 2008; Tordoff et al., 2000). Assim, nesta técnica utilizam-

se plantas tolerantes, com ou sem adição de correctivos (materiais inorgânicos e/ou orgânicos) ao 

solo/escombreira, com o objectivo de reduzir a disponibilidade dos EPTs através da imobilização dos 

mesmos por processos de absorção/acumulação pelas raízes bem como precipitação, complexação 

ou redução na rizosfera (Ali et al., 2013; Abreu e Magalhães, 2009; Adriano et al., 2004; Barceló e 

Poschenrieder, 2003; Favas et al., 2014; Ghosh e Singh, 2005; Mendez e Maier, 2008; Tordoff et al., 

2000; Wong 2003) (Fig. 4). 

Deste modo, apesar da concentração total dos elementos no solo permanecer inalterada o 

potencial risco de exposição é reduzido significativamente (Ghosh e Singh, 2005). Ainda como 

vantagens, e segundo os autores anteriormente citados, refere-se que o desenvolvimento de plantas 

contribui para minimização da erosão superficial, do impacto visual na paisagem e da lixiviação bem 

como da melhoria das características dos substratos através do aumento do conteúdo em matéria 

orgânica e capacidade de retenção de água, recuperação/promoção da estrutura do solo e 

estimulação do desenvolvimento de comunidades de microfauna/microbiana relevantes nos 

processos biológicos. De facto, de Varennes et al. (2010) observou um aumento rápido (ensaio de

fosfatase, ?-glucosidase e urease) em solos, desenvolvidos sobre gossan da mina de São Domingos, 

apenas com o crescimento de Dactylis glomerata L. cv. Amba. Por outro lado, o uso específico de 

espécies pioneiras pode permitir a modificação do meio degradado facilitando a colonização de 

outras espécies de plantas com maiores exigências.

A capacidade de tolerância das espécies, não só às concentrações dos EPTs no solo mas 

também às condições climáticas, é uma das características mais importantes que determina o 

desenvolvimento e a densidade da vegetação no processo de fitoestabilização. A associação de 

observações geobotânicas bem como, da avaliação da morfologia das plantas e seu comportamento 

ecofisiológico é de extrema importância para a selecção de espécies que podem ser utilizadas em 

programas de fitoestabilização. De um modo geral, as plantas a usar nesta técnica devem ter uma 

estratégia de excluidoras (excluders), e não indicadoras ou hiperacumuladoras, a qual se caracteriza 

pela acumulação dos elementos na raiz restringindo a sua translocação para a parte aérea 

(coeficiente de translocação &amp;lt;1), o que mantem a concentração baixa nos órgãos da parte aérea 

independentemente da gama de concentração dos mesmos elementos no solo (Ghosh e Singh, 

2005). Além disso, segundo Mendez e Maier (2008), os critérios chave para selecção de espécies 

para fitoestabilização são: concentração dos elementos na parte aérea em valores inferiores ao limite 

de toxicidade para os animais domésticos (indicados por NRC, 2005) e serem plantas não 

acumuladoras de elementos (coeficiente de acumulação &amp;lt;1), com boa cobertura de solo, perenes e 

com um sistema radicular denso. 

Vários estudos têm sido realizados com o objectivo de avaliar o comportamento de plantas 

autóctones e espontâneas com potencial para a fitoestabilização, nomeadamente para áreas mineiras 



Tecnologias de reabilitação de solos/escombreiras contaminados com elementos químicos

com clima mediterrâneo (Abreu et al., 2008, 21012a,b; Anawar et al., 2011; Conesa et al., 2006; de la 

Fuente et al., 2010; Favas et al., 2014; Freitas et al. 2004a; 2009; Kidd et al., 2004; Lázaro et al., 

2006; Madejón et al., 2009; Pérez-López et al, 2014; Rossini Oliva et al., 2009; Trigueros et al., 2012). 

O uso de comunidades vegetais autóctones e espontâneas de ambientes mineiros mediterrâneos 

pode assegurar a complementaridade de funções no ecossistema. Além disso, se estas plantas 

possuírem interesse económico é uma mais-valia no processo, pois estão adaptadas às condições de 

stresse podendo beneficiar a economia local e amortecer os custos iniciais de implementação. 

Plantas de crescimento rápido e com grande acumulação de biomassa e de fibras não-alimentares 

são, por vezes, sugeridas para a reabilitação de áreas contaminadas (Tang et al., 2012). 

Vários correctivos (resíduos ou compostos químicos) têm sido testados e/ou usados para a 

reabilitação, principalmente, de solos (Quadro 3). Contudo, apesar de muitos destes meios 

apresentarem contaminação multielementar, os estudos existentes apenas se focam em alguns 

elementos, usualmente catiões. 

O princípio básico da aplicação de correctivos é estimular/promover alguns processos de 

imobilização dos elementos, os quais acontecem naturalmente nos solos (ex. adsorção, complexação 

e/ou precipitação), reduzindo não só a sua disponibilidade para os organismos mas também a sua 

potencial lixiviação (Adriano et al., 2004; Kumpiene et al., 2008). Geralmente, a aplicação de 

correctivos (ex. composto ou resíduos orgânicos/inorgânicos) em solos e/ou escombreiras 

contaminadas tem um efeito positivo sobre as suas propriedades físicas (ex. melhoria da estrutura), 

químicas (ex. aumento do valor de pH, matéria orgânica e nutrientes, diminuição da concentração 

disponível dos EPTs) e/ou biológicas (ex. aumento das actividades enzimáticas e biomassa 

microbiana) (Abreu e Magalhães, 2009; Adriano et al., 2004; Alvarenga et al., 2008a; Burgos et al., 

2010; de Varennes et al., 2010; Hinojosa et al., 2008; Madejón et al., 2009; Pérez-de-Mora et al., 

2005; Tejada et al., 2008; Tordoff et al., 2000; Wong, 2003;). Igualmente importante é a contribuição 

dos correctivos no aumento da biomassa acumulada das plantas (de Varennes et al., 2009, 2010; 

Alvarenga et al., 2008a; Pérez-de-Mora et al., 2011; Santibáñez et al., 2008). 

A diminuição da disponibilidade dos elementos, especialmente em substratos contendo alta 

concentração de catiões (ex. Cu, Pb ou Zn), através da precipitação dos mesmos pela aplicação de 

resíduos/compostos carbonatados (ex. cinzas de biomassa, sugarbeet lime ou cal) é um dos 

processos correctivos mais comuns (Adriano et al., 2004; Bolan et al., 2014; Burgos et al., 2010; 

Clemente et al., 2006; Kumpiene et al., 2008; Mendez e Maier, 2008; Pérez-López et al., 2007; 

Rodríguez-Jordá et al., 2010; Tordoff et al., 2000; Wong, 2003), contudo esta pode ser uma solução 

temporária caso os materiais sejam geradores de acidez. O efeito resultante da aplicação destes 

materiais sobre a imobilização dos elementos químicos relaciona-se com as mudanças relativas de 

pH e, consequentemente, precipitação dos elementos como hidróxidos ou carbonatos. Além disso, é 

de salientar que estes compostos podem ter apenas um efeito ténue na reabilitação dos solos. Neste 

sentido, Rodríguez-Jordá et al. (2010) verificaram que a aplicação de resíduos industriais ricos em 

carbonatos (Quadro 3) apenas reduzia a lixiviação do Ni, Pb e Zn e não propriamente a fracção do 

complexo de troca (fracção disponível extraída com DTPA).

A aplicação de compostos ou resíduos fosfatados (ex. farinha de osso) também é uma prática 

atractiva para imobilização de EPTs pois, pode promover a formação de algumas fases sólidas (ex. 

fosfatos de Pb, Zn ou U) bastante estáveis e de baixa solubilidade (Abreu et al., 2014a; Bolan et al., 

2014; Kumpiene et al., 2008). Além disso, consoante a fonte, a aplicação de fosfato no solo pode 

causar adsorção directa dos catiões através do aumento da carga de superfície (Adriano et al., 2004). 

De um modo geral, a aplicação de correctivos orgânicos ao solo melhora a fertilidade, a estrutura 

e a actividade microbiana bem como diminui a disponibilidade dos catiões devido à formação de 

complexos organo-metálicos, aumento da capacidade de troca catiónica ou das reacções redox 

(Adriano et al., 2004; Bolan et al., 2014; Burgos et al., 2010; Clemente et al., 2006; Tejada et al., 

2008). A capacidade de imobilização depende do elemento, do tipo de solo e do tipo de matéria 

orgânica (Adriano et al., 2004; Bolan et al., 2014; Burgos et al., 2010; Kumpiene et al., 2008; Tejada 

et al., 2008). De facto, a aplicação de biossólidos frescos (ou sem prévia maturação), os quais 

apresentam geralmente baixo nível de humificação, contribuiu para a mobilização dos elementos 

químicos (Santibáñez et al., 2008). 

A contribuição dos correctivos dependerá das suas características e do tipo de resposta face aos 

componentes do solo a reabilitar, pois os mesmos correctivos podem ter um efeito diferente 

consoante as características do solo (Burgo et al., 2010). Por outro lado, alguns correctivos, embora 

possam promover o desenvolvimento das plantas, aumentam o conteúdo de C orgânico dissolvido o 

que leva ao aumento da disponibilidade dos elementos e, consequentemente, à lixiviação dos 

mesmos (Santibáñez et al., 2008). 

É de salientar ainda que, por vezes, pode não ocorrer a melhoria imediata de algumas 

propriedades dos solos/escombreiras. Hinojosa et al. (2008) observou um aumento da actividade 

enzimática após aplicação de sugarbeeet lime em solos contaminados, contudo a fracção disponível 

de Cu, Pb e Zn (extraída com DTPA) não mostrou diferenças. A mesma tendência foi indicada por de 

Varennes et al. (2010) onde a aplicação de composto a solos desenvolvidos sobre gossan aumentou 

a actividade enzimática enquanto as concentrações de Pb, Cu, Mn e Zn na fracção disponível não 

foram afectadas. Mesmo a nível biológico e tendo em conta que as respostas do microbiota são 

relativamente rápidas face à aplicação de correctivos orgânicos, por vezes o mau estado 

microbiológico do meio original implica primeiro o aumento da biomassa microbiana em vez da 

estimulação das funções bioquímicas (Burgo et al., 2010; Pérez-de-Mora et al., 2005). 

Em locais com clima árido ou semiárido, o sucesso do estabelecimento de plantas, mesmo que 

tolerantes e autóctones, directamente nos solos a reabilitar pode ser um processo difícil. Pérez-de-

Mora et al. (2011) verificou que a colonização natural (avaliada pelo grau de cobertura, biomassa 

produzida e riqueza específica de plantas vasculares) de solos contaminados pelo acidente da mina 

de Aznalcóllar foi mais rápida em plots com a aplicação de correctivos (Quadro 3). Por outro lado, em 

alguns tipos de escombreiras pode ser mesmo inviável (Tordoff et al., 2010). 

Assim, a implementação do processo de fitoestabilização com adição de correctivos pode acelerar 

o processo de reabilitação de áreas contaminadas/degradas (Adriano et al., 2004; Favas et al., 2014; 

Freitas et al., 2004a). De Varennes et al. (2009, 2010) e Madejón et al. (2009) observaram uma 

melhoria mais significativa das características dos solos (ex. actividade enzimática, respiração basal, 



Tecnologias de reabilitação de solos/escombreiras contaminados com elementos químicos 

32 

 

biomassa microbiana, pH e/ou conteúdo de C orgânico) com a aplicação de resíduos orgânicos e/ou 

inorgânicos conjuntamente como crescimento de diferentes espécies (Quadro 3) comparativamente 

aos solos onde se fez unicamente aplicação de resíduos sem crescimento das plantas. 

No entanto, é de realçar que o efeito dos resíduos, por aplicação individual ou em misturas, pode 

não se manter a médio-longo prazo pois, apenas alguns dos processos biogeoquímicos (ou 

propriedades dos solos/escombreiras) são melhorados. De facto, Pérez-de-Mora et al. (2011) indica 

que a aplicação repetida de correctivos pode ser necessária para a melhoria do desenvolvimento da 

vegetação e da redução da concentração dos EPTs nas plantas. 

Assim, o sucesso da fitoestabilização das áreas mineiras a médio-longo prazo pode residir na 

concepção de um solo artificial derivado de resíduos (Tecnossolo – IUSS WorkingGroup WRB) de 

características adequadas ao objectivo da reabilitação ambiental (Tecnossolo “à la carte”) que 

promova o crescimento de vegetação (Macías, 2004; Macías et al., 2007, 2011). Segundo estes 

autores, nos Tecnossolos são criados/estimulados diferentes processos biogeoquímicos e de 

pedogénese, devido aos efeitos complementares de cada componente, conduzindo assim à 

sustentabilidade do processo a médio-longo prazo. Esta condição ainda tem mais relevância para as 

áreas mineiras que apresentam uma contaminação multielementar e que geram drenagem ácida 

(Kumpiene et al., 2008) bem como aquelas que apresentam materiais de escombreira de 

granulometria grosseira ou muito fina. É de realçar ainda que, as perdas de C e N para a atmosfera 

pelos Tecnossolos são menores em comparação com a compostagem, devido à estabilização do C 

orgânico o que contribui para uma redução dos gases de efeito estufa e, consequentemente, da 

pegada ambiental do C (Macías, 2004; Macías e Arbestain, 2010). 

O uso de Tecnossolos para recuperação de escombreiras de sulfuretos foi realizada com sucesso 

nas minas de As Pontes e Touro, ambas na Galiza ? Espanha, onde se verificou uma diminuição da 

geração de drenagem ácida, com a consequente melhoria da qualidade das águas superficiais e 

subterrâneas, mas também da atividade biológica e promoção da biodiversidade (Macías et al., 2007; 

Monterroso et al., 1998). 

Vários são os resíduos industriais ou agro-industriais que podem ser usados para a concepção 

de Tecnossolos, devido às suas características intrínsecas, grandes quantidades disponíveis e custo 

praticamente “zero” (muitas vezes só associado ao transporte), tendo deste modo um destino 

economicamente atractivo em vez de serem depositados em aterro (Macías, 2004; Macías et al., 

2007, 2011). A selecção dos resíduos é um ponto fulcral no processo de concepção do Tecnossolo 

ao nível ambiental e económico pois, alguns resíduos contêm elevadas concentrações de elementos 

químicos ou precisam de um período de maturação (ex. lamas de ETAR ou composto).

1.6 CARACTERIZAÇÃO DE CISTUS LADANIFER E LAVANDULA PEDUNCULATA E 

SEUS PRODUTOS 

  

O Cistus ladanifer L. (Fig. 5; vulgarmente designada por esteva) é um arbusto espontâneo da 

Família Cistaceae, fortemente aromático cujas partes aéreas são extremamente pegajosas. É 

encontrada em diferentes condições climáticas e tipos de solos de todo o mediterrâneo ocidental, 

desde Portugal e Marrocos até à Argélia, sendo muitas vezes a espécie dominante nos sistemas 

arbustivos mediterrâneos. Relativamente a Portugal Continental, esta planta aparece em quase todo 

o território tanto em áreas contaminadas como não contaminadas. Como outras espécies do género 

Cistus é uma planta pioneira bem adaptada a limitações nutricionais, hídricas e excesso de luz, bem 

como a outros factores de stresse usuais nos ecossistemas mediterrânicos como é o fogo (Correia, 

2002; Delgado et al., 2001; Santos et al., 2013). É de salientar que dentro dos estádios de sucessão 

ecológica e de comportamento pioneiro, a esteva é muitas vezes a primeira espécie colonizadora. 

 

Fig. 5 Planta de Cistus ladanifer. 

Das espécies vegetais presentes nas áreas mineiras, a esteva é aquela que tem sido alvo de mais 

estudos (Alvarenga et al., 2004; Anawar et al., 2011; Batista et al., 2009; Durães et al., 2015; Favas et 

al., 2014; Freitas et al., 2004a; Kidd et al., 2004; Lázaro et al., 2006; Murciego et al., 2007; Pratas et 

al., 2005; Santos et al., 2009, 2012, 2013) apresentando uma vasta distribuição em diferentes tipos 

de escombreiras e solos. Como para outras espécies de Cistus (Abreu et al., 2012a,b; Favas et al., 



Caracterização de Cistus ladanifer e lavandula pedunculata e seus produtos 

34 

 

2014), o grau de tolerância e os padrões de acumulação dentro da planta face ao nível de 

contaminação parecem estar relacionados com a população (Batista et al., 2009; Kidd et al., 2004; 

Lázaro et al., 2006; Santos et al., 2009, 2012, 2013). 

A tolerância e adaptabilidade de C. ladanifer aos factores de stresse ambiental e oxidativo estão 

associados a mecanismos específicos de conservação de água e nutrientes (Nuñes-Oliveira et al., 

1996; Santos et al., 2013), dimorfismo das sementes e consequente variação germinativa (Delgado et 

al., 2001) bem como, restrição dos EPTs na raiz (Alvarenga et al., 2004; Batista et al., 2009; Kidd et 

al., 2004; Santos et al., 2012) e actividade de enzimas antioxidativas em diferentes locais das células 

das folhas (Santos et al., 2009). A taxa de crescimento desta espécie é elevada, quando as 

condições o permitem, produzindo considerável biomassa em relativamente pouco tempo (Nuñez et 

al., 1989; Patón et al., 1998).  

A Lavandula pedunculata (Mill.) Cav. (sinónimos Stoechas pedunculata Mill, L. pedunculata subsp. 

sampaiana (Rozeira) Franco; L.. sampaiana (Rozeira) Rivas Mart., TE Díaz &amp;amp; Fern. Gonz e L. 

stoechas subsp. pedunculata (Mill.) Rozeira) é uma das espécies aromáticas da Familia das 

Lamiaceae, vulgarmente conhecida por rosmaninho, lavanda ou lavandula (Fig. 6). É encontrada na 

Peninsula Ibérica, mais frequentemente para o interior, e Norte de Africa em diferentes habitats e 

tipos de solos. 

 

Fig. 6 Planta de Lavandula pedunculata. 

Esta espécie também foi identificada em algumas áreas mineiras (Pratas et al., 2005; Quental et 

al., 2002), nomeadamente em São Domingos (Freitas et al., 2004a), porém pouco é documentado 



Caracterização de Cistus ladanifer e lavandula pedunculata e seus produtos 

35 

 

sobre esta planta em ambientes contaminados. Além disso, o conhecimento sobre o seu 

comportamento ecofisiológico em condições de contaminação é escasso. 

Actualmente, os produtos derivados destas plantas aromáticas apresentam uma crescente 

tendência de mercado não só para a indústria de perfumaria/cosmética, farmacêutica (extracção de 

compostos bioactivos) e terapêutica (extractos, infusões, tinturas ou cápsulas) mas também para o 

sector industrial (exploração de tintas, corantes, produtos fitofarmacêuticos ou detergentes) (Lubbe e 

Verpoorte, 2011; Raut e Karuppayil, 2014). No entanto, o uso destas plantas em chá/infusões ou 

extractos, nomeadamente sob a forma de óleos, tinturas ou extractos aquosos, é uma prática antiga 

em sistemas tradicionais (WHO, 2007). 

O Cistus ladanifer tem sido usado desde os tempos antigos, nomeadamente desde os egipcíos, 

devido ao seu exsudado aromático ou resina (vulgarmente designado como láudano), para tratar 

vários problemas de saúde (ex. diarreia, disenteria, catarro e desconforto da menstruação). 

Actualmente, o óleo de esteva (mas também o láudano) tem um elevado interesse para a indústria 

farmacêutica e perfumaria devido à sua propriedade fixadora de aromas e carácter anti-séptico, 

adstringente, tónico, expectorante e balsâmico (Barrajón-Catalán et al., 2010). De facto, extractos de 

folhas de esteva são uma fonte de distintos metabolitos secundários (ex. fenólicos, terpernos, ácidos 

gordos) com actividades antioxidantes e antimicrobianas (Andrade et al., 2009; Barrajón-Catalán et 

al., 2010) bem como fúngicas (Barros et al., 2013). Mesmo alguns estudos preliminares de actividade 

citotóxica de extractos aquosos de esteva em células cancerosas do pâncreas e mama têm mostrado 

algum potencial para suportar novos estudos (Barrajón-Catalán et al., 2010). 

De igual modo, o uso de plantas do género Lavandula como um agente terapêutico remonta desde 

os romanos e gregos (Cavanagh e Wilkinson, 2002). Em Portugal, estudos etnobotânicos referem o 

uso de infusões de rosmaninho, para uso interno ou externo, devido às suas propriedades 

antissépticas, béquico, anti-inflamatório, anti-reumático, antiespasmódico, digestivo, diurético e 

calmante (Figueiredo et al., 2014). Cavanagh e Wilkinson (2002) também refere, para além das 

enunciadas, várias actividades biológicas de óleos de plantas do género Lavandula. A Lavandula 

pedunculata é também indicada como uma fonte de compostos naturais capazes de prevenir doenças 

neurodegenerativas (Costa et al., 2009) e com importante atividade antifúngica (Zuzarte et al., 2009). 

É de realçar que, na maioria das vezes, a bioactividade destes produtos pode estar associada a mais 

do que um componente do extracto, que pode não ser o maioritário (Bakkali et al., 2008). 

De um modo geral, a produtividade e variabilidade fitoquímica dos produtos derivados de espécies 

aromáticas depende de vários factores associados às plantas (espécie, ecótipo ou idade da planta) e 

às condições ambientais e do meio onde as plantas se desenvolvem (Raut e Karuppayil, 2014). De 

facto, já foi observada variação na composição orgânica e, consequentemente, na actividade 

antioxidante segundo a espécie de Lavandula (Matos et al., 2009; Teixeira et al., 2013). González-

Coloma et al. (2011) também verificaram que a concentração dos componentes maioritários de 

extractos de Lavandula luisieri (Rozeira) Rivas Mart. (extraídos com água e por hidrodestilação) 

variam consoante a população de plantas silvestres e condições de crescimento (silvestres Vs 

cultivadas). Ainda para L. dentata L., Masetto et al. (2011) concluiram que o teor de óleo extraído, por 



Caracterização de Cistus ladanifer e lavandula pedunculata e seus produtos 

36 

 

hidrodestilação, e a composição orgânica variava com o estádio de desenvolvimento floral da espécie 

e a época de colheita. 

A composição orgânica de extractos aquosos das folhas de plantas pertencentes ao género Cistus 

também está fortemente relacionada com o seu subgénero, porém as características do solo e o 

clima são factores que têm menor influência (Barrajón-Catalán et al., 2011). 

Por outro lado, o rendimento e a composição dos extractos vegetais e, consequentemente, as 

suas propriedades biológicas variam com o material vegetal e o método de extracção (Raut e 

Karuppayil, 2014). González-Coloma et al. (2011) constataram que a composição maioritária de 

extractos de L. luisieri depende da parte da planta usada (flores ou folhas) na extracção. 

Relativamente às metodologias, Andrade et al. (2009) verificaram que a extracção com acetona do 

óleo da parte aérea de C. ladanifer tinha um maior rendimento de extracção (14,19 %) e 

concentração total de compostos fenólicos (334,56 mg GAE/g extracto; GAE ? gallic acid equivalent) 

e flavonóides (23,37 mg QE/g extracto; QE ? quercetin equivalent), do que a realizada com etanol 

(8,49 %, 255,19 mg GAE/g extracto e 20,50 mg QE/g extracto). O rendimento e as propriedades 

antioxidantes de extractos metanólicos de C. ladanifer são ainda melhores do que os obtidos com 

acetona (Guimarães et al., 2010). Resultados semelhantes foram também obtidos para L. 

pedunculata onde o rendimento e a composição química varia consoante a solução extractante e, 

consequentemente, as suas propriedades antiradicais e antioxidantes (Costa et al., 2013; Teixeira et 

al., 2013). 

Vários estudos têm sido realizados para a caracterização de extractos vegetais de C. ladanifer e 

das suas actividades biológicas e/ou potenciais aplicações industriais (Fernández-Arroyo et al., 2010; 

Guimarães et al., 2009, 2010; Verdeguer et al., 2011; Zidane et al., 2013). No entanto, os estudos 

para o género Lavandula resumem-se a extractos sob a forma de óleo essencial sendo que, em 

particular, para a espécie L. pedunculata os estudos são escassos (Costa et al., 2013; Matos et al., 

2009; Teixeira et al., 2013; Zuzarte et al., 2009, 2010). 

O conteúdo de elementos químicos, tanto nas matérias-primas vegetais como nos produtos 

derivados das plantas aromáticas/medicinais é um ponto importante a determinar já que podem ser 

considerados uma fonte de nutrientes mas, também de risco para a saúde pública. De facto, WHO 

(2007) editou uma série de guidelines para avaliação das plantas medicinais devido ao risco que 

existe para a saúde pública. 

Embora Zheljazkov et al. (2008) tenham observado que altas concentrações de Cu, Cd e Pb no 

solo ou no meio de crescimento não conduzem à transferência dos mesmos elementos para o óleo 

essencial de várias espécies de plantas aromáticas (Coriandrum sativum L., Anethum graveolens L., 

Chamomilla recutita (L.) K., Mentha x piperita L., Ocimum basilicum L., Hyssopus officinalis L., 

Melissa officinalis L. e Salvia officinalis L.), nenhuma informação está disponível acerca da influência 

dos contaminantes do solo na composição e qualidade de produtos derivados de plantas de C. 

ladanifer e L. pedunculata (ou mesmo de espécies de plantas do mesmo género).

ABSTRACT 

 

This study aimed to compare the variation on the accumulation and translocation of potentially harmful 

chemical elements and nutrients (As, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) in Cistus ladanifer L. 

belonging to populations growing in different mine areas from the Portuguese Iberian Pyrite Belt 

(Brancanes, Caveira, Chança, Lousal, Neves Corvo, São Domingos). These mines are abandoned, 

(except Neves Corvo that is still operating) and have different contamination levels. 

Composite samples of soils (n = 31), developed on different mine wastes and/or host rock, and C. 

ladanifer plants (roots and shoots) were collected in the mine areas. Soils were characterized for pH, 

NPK and organic C, by classical methodologies. Soils (total fraction ? four acid digestion, and 

available fraction ? extracted with aqueous solution of diluted organic acids, simulating rizosphere 

conditions) and plants (ashing followed by acid digestion) elemental concentrations, were determined 

by ICP. Soil-plant transfer and translocation coefficients were calculated. Principal Components 

Analysis in both ways, the classical method and a second approach with adaptations used mostly in 

multivariate statistical processes control data, were done in order to compare the plants populations. 

Soils had large heterogeneity in their characteristics. Caveira, Lousal, Neves Corvo and São 

Domingos soils showed the highest total concentrations of As, Cu, Pb and Zn. Independently of the 

mine, available fractions of elements were low. Intra and inter-population variations in accumulation 

and translocation of elements were evaluated. Plants were not accumulators of the majority of the 

analysed elements. Nutrients were mainly translocated from roots to shoots, while trace elements 

were stored in roots (except in Neves Corvo for As and Pb, and São Domingos for As). Elements 

concentrations in plant populations from Lousal, Chança and São Domingos did not present much 

variation. Brancanes soils and plants presented strong differences compared to other areas. 

Cistus ladanifer plants are able to survive in mining areas with polymetallic contamination at different 

elements concentrations in total and available fraction. This species presented variations inter- and 

intra-populations in accumulation and translocation of chemical elements, however all studied 

populations, except Brancanes, can belong to the same population cluster.

INTRODUCTION 

 

Over the time, the ore extraction and disposal of mining wastes in an uncontrolled way caused 

significant environmental problems, namely acid generation, high total concentrations of trace 

elements in tailings, soils and sediments that can reduce or even inhibit the specific diversity of plant 

community (Abreu and Magalhães, 2009; Wong, 2003). These problems can also be observed in the 

mines of the Portuguese Iberian Pyrite Belt (PIPB) (Matos and Martins, 2006a). 

Although in the mining areas can coexist many stress factors for the plants as, for instance, high 

total concentrations of chemical elements in the soil, low pH, low organic matter content, soil water 

deficit, combined with high radiation and air temperature in summer in mine areas from Mediterranean 

region, some tailings and soils developed on mine wastes are naturally colonized by spontaneous 

vegetation. These plants populations usually represent specific ecotypes well adapted to mining 

conditions constituting communities with small diversity. The development of this tolerant vegetation 

contributes to the wastes weathering and pedogenesis and the evolution of ecological succession 

(Abreu and Magalhães, 2009). 

Cistus ladanifer L. is one of the species identified in several mining areas and its ecological 

behaviour has been studied in each contaminated area by several authors (Abreu et al., 2009, 2011; 

Alvarenga et al., 2004; Batista et al., 2007; Chopin and Alloway, 2007; de la Fuente et al., 2010; 

Freitas et al., 2004; Lázaro et al., 2006; Murciego et al., 2007; Pratas et al., 2005; Reglero et al., 2008; 

Santos et al., 2009; 2012). This sbrub is a plastic species that shows biological adaptations, as an 

efficient system of antioxidant enzymes (Santos et al., 2009) allowing its development in contaminated 

mine areas like São Domingos mine. However, studies involving an analysis of several C. ladanifer 

populations from different mine areas are scarce (Abreu et al., 2011; Batista et al., 2007; Chopin and 

Alloway, 2007). Furthermore, the majority of the studies were practically focused on copper, lead and 

zinc, and sometimes As, while the C. ladanifer–soil relationships regarding nutrients are weakly 

known.  

This study aimed to compare the variation on the accumulation and translocation of potentially 

harmful chemical elements and nutrients (As, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) in Cistus 

ladanifer populations growing in different mine areas from the Portuguese Iberian Pyrite Belt 

(Brancanes, Caveira, Chança, Lousal, Neves Corvo, and São Domingos). 

 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Site characterization 

 

Six mining areas located in Alentejo region in the Portuguese Iberian Pyrite Belt were studied: 

Brancanes, Caveira, Chança, Lousal, Neves Corvo and São Domingos mining areas. These mines 

are nowadays abandoned, except Neves Corvo that is still operating.The location of these mines in 

PIPB region is shown in Figure 1; Caveira and Lousal mines are located in the NW part (±12 km away 

from each other); Brancanes and Neves Corvo are situated in the SW region (±3 km away from each

other); while São Domingos and Chança are located in the SE part of the PIPB (±5 km away from 

each other). 

 

Fig. 1 Location of the studied mining areas in the Portuguese Iberian Pyrite Belt (B: Brancanes; Cav: Caveira; Ch: 

Chança; L: Lousal; NC: Neves Corvo; SD: São Domingos). 

 

These mines were exploited in different periods of time, and the size of the massive sulfide 

deposits was also different. According to Matos and Martins (2006a), Neves Corvo present giant 

deposits (&gt; 200 Tg) whereas Lousal, São Domingos and Caveira were medium deposits (5–50 Tg) 

and Chança was a minor deposit (&amp;lt;5 Tg). Brancanes corresponds to a copper vein structure. 

During Roman times, massive sulfide deposits and/or gossan from Caveira, Lousal, São Domingos 

and Chança were intensively exploited. The modern exploitation started in the XIXth century in 

Caveira (1854), São Domingos (1857), Chança (1877) and Lousal (1900), and in the XXth century in 

Neves Corvo (1987) (Matos and Martins, 2006a,b; Matos et al., 2008; Quental et al., 2002). 

Brancanes mine was only exploited during the XIXth century being closed by the end of that century, 

while other mines ceased their activity in the XXth century (Chança: 1930’s; São Domingos 1960’s; 

Caveira 1970’s; Lousal: 1980’s). 

In the PIPB context, the Caveira, Lousal, and São Domingos mines generate large negative 

environmental impact, due to the dimension of the areas affected by tailings and by the acid mine 

drainage (AMD) (Matos and Martins, 2006a; Pérez-López et al., 2008), while Brancanes and Chança 

are nowadays areas showing a minimum environmental impact, and may be considered in process of 

natural attenuation (Abreu et al., 2011; Matos and Martins, 2006a). 

The climate in these mining areas is typically Mediterranean characterized by long hot and dry 

summers, and winters moderately cold and wet. The average annual rainfall lies between 432 and 500 

mm (INMG, 1990) and occurs mostly in winter and with an irregular shape. 

 

Field sampling 

 

Several sampling areas (n = 31) with ?10 m
2
 each were selected to include representative soils of 

each mine where Cistus ladanifer L. was growing up. These soils were developed on different mine 

wastes, mixtures in variable proportions of wastes and host rocks, being considered Spolic Technosol

Toxic (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2007). In some cases, soils are developed on schists and 

greywackes (Leptosol; IUSS Working Group WRB, 2007) and can be influenced by adjacent tailings 

and/or AMD. Soils are developed on: schists and greywackes in Brancanes (n = 3); schist, 

colluvium/alluvium materials, slags with different ages and massive and semi-massive sulfide ore in 

Caveira (n = 7); gossan materials and crushed pyrite in Chança (n = 6); schist in Lousal (n = 2); 

schists and greywackes in Neves Corvo (n = 7); and gossan materials, modern slags and pyrite ashes 

in São Domingos (n = 6).  

In each sampling area, composite samples of soils (?3 kg of homogenate of, at least, three trial 

points) were collected in the surrounding of the C. ladanifer radicular system (0–20 cm). At the same 

time and in the same sampling area were also collected roots and shoots (composed of leaves and 

twigs) of C. ladanifer plants. Plant samples represent, as for the soils, composite samples of a 

homogenate of at least three plants representing a population of C. ladanifer growing in each sampling 

area. 

 

Samples characterization 

 

Soils 

The soil samples were air-dried, homogenized and sieved. The soil fraction (&amp;lt;2 mm) was 

characterized for (Póvoas and Barral, 1992): pH and electrical conductivity (EC) in water suspension 

(1:2.5 m/V); organic carbon (Tinsley method); extractable phosphorous and potassium (Egner-Riehm 

method) and total nitrogen (Kjeldahl method). 

The total concentrations of As, Ca, Cu, Fe, Pb, Mg, Mn, Ni, K and Zn (fraction &amp;lt;2 mm) in soils 

were determined in an international certified laboratory using ICP and INAA, after acid digestion with 

perchloric acid + nitric acid + hydrochloric acid + hydrofluoric acid (Actlabs ISO/IEC 17025; Activation 

Laboratories, 2013a).  

The same chemical elements were analysed in a soil extractable aqueous solution that simulated 

rizosphere conditions (RHIZO solution; Feng et al. 2005) which contain acetic acid + lactic acid + citric 

acid + malic acid + formic acid at 10 mmol/L. These extractable soil solutions were analysed by ICP-

MS and ICP-OES in the same certified laboratory (Activation Laboratories, 2013b). 

 

Plants 

Roots and shoots samples were washed with tap water and then with distilled water. The roots 

were still sonicated in distilled water for 30 minutes. Plant samples were dried (40 °C) homogenised 

and finely ground. The same chemical elements than in soils were analysed by ICP-MS, after ashing 

(475 °C) and nitric acid digestion (Activation Laboratories, 2013c). 

 

Data analysis 

 

Descriptive statistics was performed in the four sets of data – total concentrations of chemical 

elements in the soils, available fraction of soils, roots and aerial parts of the C. ladanifer from all

mining areas. Measures of central tendency and dispersion were obtained. Principal Components 

Analysis (PCA) in two ways – the classical method and a second approach with adaptations used 

mostly in multivariate statistical process control data – were done assuming that the populations of 

variables are multivariate normally distributed. To assess multivariate normality Probability-Probability 

chart was produced to check the tendency of all variables together to follow the normal theoretical 

curve. In the second approach instead of rotations of the axis in classical PCA, where is tried to 

maximize the highly correlated data and minimize the lowest correlations of data, it is proposed in this 

approach the change of the origin of data to the mean. Sometimes it is necessary to change the origin 

of data to the mean more than once to have the best fit. The transformed variables are the ratio 

between, the difference of the original variable and the mean, in numerator, and the standard 

deviation of the original variable, in denominator. This second method of application of PCA was 

performed in this study using the Nonlinear Iterative Partial Least Square (NIPALS) (an iterative 

procedure) algorithm with 50 iterations maximum number and convergence criteria of 0.0001. The 

iterative method NIPALS used to build the principal components model (find the eigenvectors) for the 

representation of multivariate variables X (Risvic, 2007). The number of components was fitted by 

cross-validation. Another important difference between the classical PCA and the second approach 

PCA is the significance and limit of the principal components. Classical PCA significance of principal 

components determines the number of principal components until all the data are explained. This way, 

the number of principal components corresponds to the number of variables. In the second method, 

the limit and the significance of the principal components is based on the method of cross-validation. 

The cross-validation method was V-fold validation. In V-fold cross validation, the data are divided into 

v segments, v-1 of which is used to build up the model and the rest is used for testing. This process is 

repeated for all possible permutations of the training and testing segments and the overall Q
2
 and Q

2
V 

are calculated for the newly added principal component using the test samples. Given the estimated 

values of Q
2
 and Q

2
V, it is possible to determine, whether a principal component is significant. 

The reason for the choice of both methods was that the soil and plant data were obtained in 

different mining areas with different extraction of ore volumes, which could impact differently the 

environment. As was already referred, these mining areas had different periods of mining and one of 

them is still in operation.  

Classical PCA is considered to organize variables in clusters. It is also important to obtain the usual 

interpretations and tests what can be obtained with the second approach. Adding this PCA control 

process it is expected to extract more information from the data and at the same time, perform a 

quality control of the data. This method is usually obtained in the industry to control the quality of data 

produced. Apart from the called “quality control” that it is considered necessary because of the 

diversity of mining areas with different ore deposits extracted in different time periods, it is possible to 

have information from the predictors and from the residuals. Predictors correspond to pre-processing 

the data and with it, predict future observations, and in the present case try to eliminate over 

representation of some variables, merely on the basis of, for instance, the range of data. Variables 

often have substantially different ranges (i.e., different variances). This may have to do with the units 

of measurements or simply the nature of the variables themselves. However, the numeric range of a

from Brancanes, Caveira, Chança, Lousal, Neves Corvo and São Domingos mines in the Portuguese Iberian Pyrite 

55 

 

variable may not be a good indication of the importance of that variable. Residuals, on the other hand, 

correspond to the properties that are not captured by the principal components but that can contain 

important information such as outliers. These outliers are observed in the Hotelling T2 diagram or D-

to-Model diagram (Distance to the model) where moderate outliers are identified. The degree of 

freedom is given by the difference between the variables number and the principal components. At the 

end, predictions for the PC model plus residual variance equal the preprocessed data (scaled) (Hill 

and Lewicki, 2007). 

The four principal components (PC) are represented by the lines and from the bottom line until the 

first, respectively PC1 to PC4. The groups of variables that are correlated with the respective PCs are 

represented in relation to the respective lines and the contributions are cumulative in the respective 

diagrams. Therefore, the biggest contribution is given by PC1 and the other are added to this one. 

For statistical purposes, the results below the detection limit were assumed as half of the detection 

limit while for the results over range was considered the limit value range. Quality control of the 

analysis was made by analytical replicate samples, use of certified standard solutions and laboratory 

standards at the Activation Laboratories.  

Soil-plant transfer and translocation coefficients were calculated. Soil-plant transfer coefficient 

(TransferC = [total shoots element]/[total soil element]), also named biological absorption coefficient or 

biological accumulation coefficient, indicates if the plants can be considered as accumulator 

(TransferC &gt; 1) or non-accumulating of a specific element. The translocation capacity of an element, 

from roots to shoots, can be evaluated by translocation coefficient (TranslC = [total shoots 

element]/[total roots element]). 

 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Soil characteristics  

 

The characteristics of the soils collected in each mining area had great variability, depending on the 

complex mixture of mine wastes or mine wastes plus host rocks (Table 1). The pH of the soils can be 

considered moderately acid or acid, with values below 4, in areas that uses to receive the influence of 

acid mine drainage or where soils have been developed on mine wastes containing sulfides, as is the 

case of the majority of the PIPB mines. The soils of Brancanes had the pH in the range 5.4 – 6.0 

because the collected samples were developed on host rocks (Table 1).  

The high values of the electrical conductivity of the soils from Lousal (&gt; 1.3 mS/cm) is a 

consequence of the influence of waste dump leachates leading to salt efflorescence formation on the 

soil surface in the summer season. The soils were collected near the bottom of a waste pile, draining 

directly to the place.  

Concentrations of extractable K in soils from all mine areas were in the range considered medium-

high or very high (INIA – LQARS, 2000), depending on mine area. In general, soil fertility in Brancanes 

and Neves Corvo was slightly better, compared to the soils of other mine areas, because the 

concentrations of organic C, total N and extractable P in soils of those sampling areas can be 

considered as medium to high or very high (INIA – LQARS, 2000) (Table 1).

Comparing the concentrations of the studied chemical elements in the soils of the different mine 

areas, soils from Brancanes presented the lowest values for the total concentrations of the elements 

(except for manganese; Table 2). The same tendency was not verified for the soil available fraction 

where the concentrations of Ca, Fe, Mg, Mn and K (Table 3) in the extractable solutions were among 

the highest values when compared to the other soils. For the six mine areas, the total concentrations 

of As in the soils exceeded the maximum allowed values (MAV) according to the Canadian legislation 

(12 mg As/kg; CCME, 2007).Total concentrations of Cu and Pb in the majority of the soils from all the 

mine areas, with Brancanes exception, were above the MAV for agriculture use and following the 

Canadian Soil Quality Guidelines (63 mg Cu/kg and 70 mg Pb/kg; CCME, 2007). Unlike As, Cu and 

Pb the total concentration of Zn were below the MAV (200 mg Zn/kg; CCME, 2007) in São Domingos 

soils and some soil samples from Neves Corvo. Nickel total concentrations in all the mine soils were 

relatively low and within the range of the medium values calculated by Kabata-Pendias (2011) on the 

World Scale for Different Soil Groups and even below the maximum allowed values according to 

CCME (2007) for any soil use (50 mg Ni/kg). Soils from Chança and São Domingos presented lower 

total concentrations of manganese than the soils of the other mine areas. 

The total concentrations of the trace elements in the mine soils were high (Table 2), but the 

concentrations of the same elements in the soil available fraction were, in general, low in all mine 

areas (Table 3). Although elements concentrations in available fraction differ according to the used 

extraction solution, low concentrations of arsenic, copper, iron, manganese, lead and zinc in the soil 

available fractions were also observed in Caveira and São Domingos (Abreu et al., 2012a,b; Batista et 

al., 2009; Santos et al., 2012) as well as in some soil available fractions from Neves Corvo and 

Brancanes (Batista et al., 2007). In Caveira and São Domingos soils, the low availability of As, Cu, Pb, 

Mg and Zn was explained by the association of these elements mainly to the residual fraction 

(accounted to solid phases with low solubility) as well as Fe-oxide fractions and, in some soils from 

São Domingos, by the presence of solid phases, in the residual fraction, containing As, Fe and Pb 

(Abreu et al., 2012b; Santos et al., 2012).  

The As, Cu, Fe, Pb, Mg, Ni and Zn total concentrations in the soils of the studied mines are in the 

same range than those reported, by several authors, for soils collected from mines of the Iberian 

Pyrite Belt (Abreu et al., 2012a,b; Álvarez-Valero et al., 2008; Pérez-López et al., 2008) or for soils 

from mines where C. ladanifer grows (Table 4).

Inter-population variation on the accumulation and translocation of potentially harmful chemical elements in Cistus ladanifer L. 
from Brancanes, Caveira, Chança, Lousal, Neves Corvo and São Domingos mines in the Portuguese Iberian Pyrite 

 

61 

 

Accumulation and translocation of chemical elements in plants 

 

Concentrations of the chemical elements in roots and shoots of C. ladanifer from the different 

mining areas showed different trends and variability (Figs. 2 and 3). Some populations showed high 

concentrations of some elements in their shoots, as is the case of As in plants from Neves Corvo and 

São Domingos and lead in plants from Caveira. In fact, the accumulation capacity for elements in C. 

ladanifer shoots depends on element and population (Kidd et al., 2004; Lázaro et al., 2006; Santos et 

al., 2012, 2013). Considering all the populations as a cluster, the elements concentrations in shoots 

and roots were not correlated to the concentrations of the same elements in soils (total and available 

fraction), except for Pb. For the different mine areas, the existence or the absence of this type of 

correlation vary with soils, plants and chemical elements and, usually, did not show a regular pattern.  

Some authors also reported both behaviours for this species populations growing in São Domingos 

mine (Batista et al., 2009; Santos et al., 2012).

Fig. 2 Concentrations of nutrients in roots and shoots of Cistus ladanifer collected in the studied mining areas 

(geometric mean ± SD) (B: Brancanes; Cav: Caveira; Ch: Chança; L: Lousal; NC: Neves Corvo; SD: São 

Domingos). 

 

The different concentrations of chemical elements in the shoots are the result of several plant 

processes, like uptake, accumulation in roots, translocation from roots to shoots and tolerance

capacity rather than soil elements concentrations in the soil available fraction. In fact, some of the 

studied plants showed higher concentrations of some elements in shoots than in the soil available 

fraction. Although Lousal population had in shoots and roots similar elements concentrations 

compared to the plants from the other studied mines (except for Ca and Zn; Figs. 2 and 3), this fact 

may not reflect the real behaviour of the plant population from Lousal because only two sampling 

areas were considered for this mine area. Calcium concentrations in both plant parts varied in the 

same range (3?12 g/kg; Fig. 2) however the plants, except those from Lousal, presented Ca 

concentrations (average values) around 6 and 7 g/kg for roots and shoots, respectively. The 

concentrations of this element in C. ladanifer shoots collected in the IPB mining areas (Aljustrel: 5.0 ? 

8.9 g/kg; Alvarenga et al., 2004; Rio Tinto: 5.6 ± 3.4 g/kg; de la Fuente et al., 2010) were in same 

range. Lousal plants reached the lowest calcium concentrations (g/kg ? roots: 3.7; shoots: 2.6).

Fig. 3 Concentrations of trace elements in roots and shoots of Cistus ladanifer collected in the studied mining 

areas (geometric mean ± SD). (B: Brancanes; Cav: Caveira; Ch: Chança; L: Lousal; NC: Neves Corvo; SD: São 

Domingos). 

 

Neves Corvo and São Domigos plants reached the highest concentrations of As in shoots (mg/kg ? 

NC: 13.7; SD: 14.3; Fig. 3) and iron (mg/kg ? NC: 1.8 x 10
3
; SD: 1.6 x 10

3
; Fig. 2). However, the 

arsenic concentrations in their roots is quite different (mg/kg – NC: 1.2; SD: 10.1) while for Fe 

concentrations are similar (0.6 x 10
3
 mg/kg). Most of the plants from these two mine areas showed 

arsenic concentrations above the phytotoxic limit reported by Kabata-Pendias (2011; 5 – 20 mg As/kg; 

&gt; 1x10
3
 mg Fe/kg), but visual signs of toxicity were not observed. The absence of As toxicity in C. 

ladanifer can be related to the accumulation of this elements in organic forms within the plant (Batista 

et al., 2004) and the existence of an efficient detoxification process through of the activity of some 

antioxidative enzymes (Santos et al., 2009). Furthermore, the increase of As concentration with the 

leaves development from mature to senescent stage in C. ladanifer plants growing on soils developed 

on gossan materials from São Domingos mine can be considered as a detoxification process to assist 

arsenic removal (Santos et al., 2013). Regarding As in plants in the other mine areas, two clusters can 

be formed: Brancanes and Chança with As concentrations in shoots and roots lower than 2 mg/kg, 

and Caveira and Lousal with concentrations varying between 1 and 9.5 mg/kg depending on plant part 

and sampling area. The Fe concentration in roots and shoots in plants populations from Brancanes, 

Caveira, Chança and Lousal showed great variability varying between 0.1 and 0.8 g/kg.

The Pb concentration in C. ladanifer showed a great variation intra- and inter-populations of the 

mining areas, attaining the plants from Caveira the highest concentrations both in shoots (21.8 mg 

Pb/kg) and roots (109.2 mg Pb/kg). Plants from Caveira populations showed a wide range of Pb 

concentrations but most of the values were lower than 24.4 and 244.2 mg Pb/kg for shoots and roots, 

respectively. One of the C. ladanifer sample from Caveira had Pb concentrations in shoots (153 

mg/kg) that exceed the range considered phytotoxic by Kabata-Pendias (2011; 30?300 mg Pb/kg). 

These plants grew in soils with the highest Pb total concentration (48 x 10
3
 mg/kg) but not the high Pb 

concentration in the soil available fraction. Considering sample as an outlier, and comparing Pb 

concentrations in plants populations from Caveira and São Domingos, they are in the same range. In 

Brancanes, Chança, Lousal and Neves Corvo, the Pb concentrations in plant populations were low 

and in the same range, not exceeding 9.6 and 24.3 mg Pb/kg in shoot and roots, respectively. 

Copper concentrations in plants (shoots and roots) from Neves Corvo were clearly different from 

those in plants collected in the other mine areas (mg/kg ? roots: 28.3; shoots: 219.5 mg; Fig. 2). São 

Domingos populations presented higher Cu concentrations in both plant parts (mg/kg ? roots: 15.2; 

shoots: 20.2) than plant populations from Brancanes, Caveira and Chança. These plants had similar 

mean concentrations of Cu both in roots and shoots, showing Caveira and Chança a great variability 

in their Cu concentrations (mg/kg – Cav: roots: 4.4?28.8; shoots: 4.8?14.3; Ch: roots: 3.1?58.1; 

shoots: 2.7?21.4). The majority of the plants collected in the studied mine areas presented Cu 

concentrations in shoots within the range considered normal or sufficient (5?30 mg Cu/kg; Kabata-

Pendias, 2011). 

Nickel was considered as a nutrient because this trace element has a possible essential role in 

plant metabolism (Srivastava and Gupta 1996), however high Ni concentrations have toxic effects. In 

all the studied populations, the concentration of this element is below the range considered toxic 

(10?100 mg Ni/kg) and within the normal range (0.1?5 mg Ni/kg) for plants (Kabata-Pendias 2011). 

Brancanes and Neves Corvo populations showed the greatest variability for Ni concentration, 

especially, for roots (Fig. 2). Regarding Mn, plant populations from the six studied mine areas behave 

similarly to nickel. However, most of the plants had Mn concentrations in shoots within or even above 

the phytotoxic values (400–1000 mg Mn/kg; Kabata-Pendias, 2011) (Fig. 2). 

In general, independently of the population, Zn concentrations in shoots (Fig. 2) were considered 

normal or sufficient (27?150 mg/kg; Kabata-Pendias 2011). Populations from Lousal and São 

Domingos presented higher concentration of Zn in the roots than the populations growing in the other 

mine areas. 

Cistus ladanifer shoots and roots collected in different mine areas showed a wide range of 

concentrations for the same chemical elements (Table 4) being, in some cases, different from the 

values obtained in present study and for the same elements (Figs. 2 and 3).The differences in the 

storage of some elements suggest different processes for accumulation and/or transport mechanisms 

within plants (Zhang et al., 2002). The differences can be induced by seasonal and temporal variations 

in plants and soils (e.g. elements concentrations in the soil available fraction, meteorological 

conditions, water regime), as well as the analysed plant part collected (e.g. leaves (young and

mature), shoots (leaves and twigs)) (Alvarenga et al., 2004; Kabata-Pendias, 2011; Murciego et al., 

2007; Santos et al., 2012). 

The calculated values of the soil–plant transfer coefficient (TransfC) indicated that the populations 

from the studied mining areas are non-accumulators of As, Cu, Fe, Pb and Ni (TransfC &amp;lt;1), as was 

already reported for São Domingos plants growing in soils developed on gossan (As, Cu and Pb; 

Santos et al., 2012) as well as for some C. ladanifer plants collected in Aljustrel (PIPB) (Cu and Pb; 

Alvarenga et al., 2004), and in Tharsis and Rio Tinto mine areas (IPB) (for As, Cu and Pb; Chopin and 

Alloway, 2007). 

Variations inter- and/or intra-population in the accumulation behaviour of Ca, Mn and Zn were 

observed for the plants collected within the six mine areas. The same variations were already reported 

for the same species from IPB mines by several authors (Abreu et al., 2011; Alvarenga et al., 2004; 

Chopin and Alloway, 2007; Santos et al., 2012). In general, this species was Ca accumulator (except 

one sample from Lousal and other from Neves Corvo) while for the Mn plants presented both 

behaviours. Plants from São Domingos and Brancanes were Zn accumulators, but the same 

behaviour was not observed for populations from the other four areas, except one sample from Neves 

Corvo and two samples from Chança. The same plants species growing in Rio Tinto mine (IPB) were 

manganese accumulators but  excluders of As, Cu, Fe, Pb, Ni and Zn (de la Fuente et al., 2010). 

Chopin and Alloway (2007) also reported both accumulation behaviours of Zn in C. ladanifer 

populations from Tharsis and Rio Tinto mine areas, while Santos et al. (2012) observed that São 

Domingos plants were only Zn accumulator plants. According to the concentrations referred in the 

literature in order to consider a plant as hyperaccumulator of a specific element (Kabata-Pendias, 

2011), none C. ladanifer population is considered a hipperaccumulator of the Ca, Mn and Zn. 

The calculated soil to plant coefficient transfer Caveira, Chança, Lousal and São Domingos mine 

areas followed the order: Ca &gt; Mn &gt; Zn &gt; Ni &gt; Cu &gt; As, Fe, Pb. This order agrees with that reported 

by Kabata Pendias (2011) for the majority of the plant species, except for Mn and Ni. Brancanes and 

Neves Corvo populations presented the same tendency, for the same coefficient except for the Fe and 

Ni in Brancanes and As in Neves Corvo. The soil to plant coefficient transfer calculated by de la 

Fuente et al. (2010) for several elements and species, including C. ladanifer, from Rio Tinto mine 

allowed to conclude that the general pattern of elements accumulation was related to the essential 

requirements for any plant species, corresponding to macronutrients (Ca, Mg) &gt; micronutrients (Na &gt; 

Fe, Mn &gt; Cu, Zn) &gt; toxic elements (As, Pb). 

As for the accumulation behaviour, a variation inter- and intra-population in the elements 

translocation from roots to shoots was observed (TranslC: 0.1?37.9 depending on population and 

element). The same behaviour was also indicated by other author for the same species (Abreu et al., 

2011; Alvarenga et al., 2004; Santos et al., 2012). Nutrients were mainly translocated from roots to 

shoots, independently of population, due to their important metabolic functions (TranslC: 1.0–30.6, 

depending on population and element). The majority of the plants from Chança, Caveira and Lousal 

showed a low translocation of Cu and Fe from roots to shoots, however the concentrations of these 

elements in their shoots are considered normal and sufficient. Copper retention in the roots of the

plants growing in soils with high concentrations of this element can be a tolerance mechanism that 

guarantees adequate levels of Cu in photosynthetic parts of the plant. 

Although Neves Corvo soils had low concentrations of As and Pb in total and available fractions 

(Tables 2 and 3), plants from this area translocated these non-essential elements from shoots to roots 

(Translocation coefficients of 6.9?37.9 and 1?33.5 for As and Pb, respectively). The high As 

translocation factor was also observed in São Domingos population, despite the total concentration of 

As in soils of this area was higher (Table 2). However, an opposite behaviour of As translocation was 

observed by Santos et al. (2012) for the same species and same mine area but on soils with highest 

As concentrations than those measured in the present studied soils. 

 

Multivariate analysis 

 

The Principal Components Analysis (PCA) assumes that the studied variables tend to multivariate 

normality. The Probability-Probability chart (P-P) showed that the sets of variables tend to the 

theoretical curve (normal) as a whole. However, when those are separated the same tendency does 

not occur. The diagrams were produced using the elements concentrations in the soils (total and 

available fractions), and in the aerial parts (shoots) and in the roots of the plants. The best tendency to 

normality was observed in the P-P diagrams of the soils. Even so, certain elements (Ca, Fe and Ni) 

seem to deviate more than others from that tendency. However, the deviation is more evident in the P-

P diagram for elements concentrations in roots (Fig. 4).

Figure 5 shows that the same groups of elements were obtained in PCA and in PCA-NIPALS, 

representing the PC1-PC2 axis the available fractions of the elements in soils. PCA-NIPALS provides 

more information about PCs variables and individuals, so the observations will focus more in this 

analysis. Table 5 represents the summary of the calculation of the four principal components 

determined by the prediction model (Q
2
cumul) with the respective cumulative variance explanation 

R
2
X for all sample type analysed. The elements concentrations in soils available fraction, total 

concentrations of the elements in soils, and elements concentrations in the aerial parts and in the 

roots of the plants have an explained variance of 81.95 %, 70%, 96.87 % and 98 %, respectively.

Fig. 5 PC1-PC2 plots obtained by Principal Components Analysis (PCA) (A) and PCA using NIPALS algorithm 

(B) for available concentrations of elements. 

 

The variation in contribution to the PC of the individuals show similar behaviour between samples 

of roots and shoots from the plants with exception of the Neves Corvo samples where PC2 (As and 

Cu) and PC3 (Pb) of shoots behave differently than PC1 (Ca, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, K and Zn) and the roots 

of the same plants (Fig. 6). Similar groups were identified on the PC1 of soils available fractions and 

plants, although not always in the same sites. In the case of the available fraction of the soils, those 

are more related with Neves Corvo mine area. Whereas in case of the plants those are more related 

with Brancanes mine area. There is a strong correlation for Caveira area between Pb concentration in 

the soils available fraction and in the plants (shoots and roots). When observing individual 

contributions (not presented), all samples collected in Caveira are significantly more correlated with Pb 

than with other chemical elements, with special contribution of the sample Cav5. The exception is the 

total concentration of the elements in soils which have different behaviour. This different behaviour is 

expected, because total fraction of the elements in soils may not be entirely available for plant uptake 

and it differs depending on the chemical element (Fig. 6).

Fig. 6 Calculation determined by the prediction model (Q

cumul) of the four principal components of the PCs of 

the individuals concentrations for soil total fraction (A), soil available fraction (B), Cistus ladanifer roots (C) and 

Cistus ladanifer shoots (D). (B: Brancanes; Cav: Caveira; Ch: Chança; L: Lousal; NC: Neves Corvo; SD: São 

Domingos).

There is not much variation in the scores representation in the shoots and roots of C. ladanifer 

populations from Lousal (although two samples are not representative of the population) and also from 

Chança and São Domingos (Fig. 6). The distal samples of Neves Corvo also show, in general, the 

same behaviour than those referred to Chança and São Domingos areas. PCA predictions for scaled 

(preprocessed) data (not presented) confirm some of the previous observations for score axis where 

Pb is related with the Caveira samples. Neves Corvo and Brancanes plant shoots, specially samples 

from the last area, show strong variations and important contributions of the elements grouped in the 

PC1 (Ca, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, K and Zn). These results were never observed in previous studies of 

Brancanes and Neves Corvo (Batista et al., 2007), because comparison among different mines, 

including these ones, with PCA studies were only possible in this study, when a representative 

number of samples was finally reached.The similarity between correlations to the axis and variables of 

São Domingos, Chança and Lousal is a new observation based on the present PCA studies. PCA 

residuals for scaled data (not presented) show that distal samples of Neves Corvo, Lousal and 

Caveira samples (elements concentration in the soil available fractions) are relevant, therefore not 

included in predictions of the modelled PCs. The same is true for plants, especially roots of São 

Domingos, Brancanes and Lousal where a relevant contribution to the PCs was not included in the 

predictions of the PC models. This may explain the apparent comparison of the elements 

concentrations in plants from São Domingos and Chança. Previous studies (Abreu et al., 2012a,b; 

Batista et al., 2009; Santos et al., 2012) report the low availability of the chemical elements in São 

Domingos soils which can also explain those comparison. Batista el al. (2007) reported the low 

chemical elements plant uptake, possibly due to the natural attenuation that seems to occur in 

Brancanes areas and the consequent soil-plant relationship. However, with this set of studied samples 

and the comparison between the six mine sites there is a strong difference in the behaviour of 

samples collected in Brancanes compared with the other samples of soils and C. ladanifer plants 

collected in Caveira, Chança, Lousal, Neves Corvo and São Domingos mine areas. Total 

concentrations of the elements in soils show comparable results with the previous studies where 

elements concentrations in soils are independent of the uptake of the elements by plants and the 

differences observed between samples contributions to the PCs can be explained by the diversity of 

materials and concentrations of chemical elements in soils/spoils where these plants were developed. 

 

CONCLUSIONS 

 

Soils from the different mine areas (Brancanes, Caveira, Chança, Lousal, Neves Corvo and São 

Domingos) showed a great heterogeneity of the total concentrations of trace elements, which is 

related to the diversity of materials where soils were developed. 

Independently of mining area, the high concentrations of the trace elements in soils did not induce 

toxicity for C. ladanifer plants. This species is able to grow in mining areas with soils presenting 

different levels of polymetallic contamination. Cistus ladanifer presented variations inter- and intra-

populations concerning the accumulation and translocation of chemical elements. Whatever the mine 

area where the plants grew, nutrients were mainly translocated from roots to shoots while trace

elements were stored in roots (except Neves Corvo for As and Pb and São Domingos for As). Plants 

belonging to the populations from all mine areas were non-accumulators of As, Cu, Pb, Fe and Ni but 

they were Ca accumulator. São Domingos and Brancanes plants populations were Zn accumulators.  

In general, the total concentrations of chemical elements in shoots and roots of C. ladanifer 

populations from Lousal, Chança and São Domingos did not present much variation as well as some 

samples of Neves Corvo. The behaviour of the Brancanes plants population, as well the chemical 

elements concentrations in the soils where these plants grew, presented strong when compared to the 

other mine areas, both for soils and plants. Cistus ladanifer plants from all studied populations 

collected in mining areas, except Brancanes, seem to belong to the same population cluster

CONTAMINATED WITH NON-ESSENTIAL CHEMICAL 

ELEMENTS 

 



 

 

 



Cistus ladanifer phytostabilizing soils contaminated with non-essential chemical elements

ABSTRACT 

 

Cistus ladanifer L. is one of the spontaneous species from Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB) considered 

promising for phytostabilisation of mining areas. Although the plant–soil relationships of some 

potentially hazardous elements (e.g. As, Pb, Cu and Zn) are known, for other elements also potentially 

hazardous and non-essential this information is scarce. However, in soils with multielemental 

contamination and for landscape rehabilitation processes, these elements should also be considered. 

The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the potential of C. ladanifer in the phytostabilisation of the 

soils, developed on different contaminated substrata (e.g. mine wastes, and schists and greywackes 

or their mixtures) and containing non-essential elements (Al, Ag, Ba, Bi, Cd, Sb and Sr), from three 

Portuguese IPB mining areas (Caveira, Lousal and São Domingos). The uptake, accumulation and 

translocation of these non-essential elements and their influence on the concentrations of beneficial 

elements (Co, Na and Se) and major nutrients were studied. 

Multielemental contaminated soils from the three mining areas had high total concentrations of 

some non-essential elements (Ba and Sb for the three mines and Se for Caveira and São Domingos). 

Soil available fraction of the studied elements were usually small (&amp;lt;8.6 % of the total concentration) 

except for Cd whose available fraction was between 10 and 100 % of the total concentration (&amp;lt;

0.3?1.3 mg Cd/kg). In general, C. ladanifer showed significant uptake (biological absorption 

coefficients indicating strong and intensive uptake) and translocation (translocation coefficients &gt; 1) of 

the studied elements (even the non-essentials), but small accumulation in the shoots (mg/kg ? Ag, Bi, 

Sb and Se: &amp;lt;1.6; Ba, Cd, Co and Sr: 0.05?37.8; Al and Na: 49?2503), independently of the mine 

area. Elemental concentrations in the shoots were below the limit values indicated for phytotoxicity 

and toxicity for domestic animals intake. Although the statistical negative influence of Ag, Sb and Sr on 

the concentrations of the beneficial elements (Na) and nutrients (Ca and Fe) in roots or shoots had 

been obtained, no visual symptoms was observed in the plants. Cistus ladanifer plants from the 

studied populations can be considered non-accumulators and excluders of Al, Ag, Ba, Bi, Sr and Sb 

(soil-plant transfer coefficient&amp;lt;&amp;lt;1) and beneficial elements. Although plants from São Domingos and, 

in some cases, from Caveira can be accumulators of Cd, the concentrations of Cd in the shoots were 

small (&amp;lt;0.2 mg/kg) and did not represent any environmental risk. Due to its adaptability, tolerance and 

standard plant behaviours in the three mining areas, C. ladanifer will be a good choice for 

phytostabilisation of soils contaminated with non-essential elements.

INTRODUCTION 

 

Since pre-roman period until the last decades of the twentieth century, the mining activity in the 

Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB), associated to the ore extraction and/or transformation, was developed 

without controlled rules for minimization of environmental or health risks. In addition, several mining 

areas had significant environmental impacts related to the great volumes of different tailings dispersed 

irregularly along the mine areas; high total concentrations of trace elements in the tailings, soils, 

sediments and waters; leaching of potentially hazardous elements for adjacent areas by water or wind 

erosion; and low production of biomass and biodiversity (Abreu et al., 2010; Álvarez-Valero et al., 

2008; Matos and Martins, 2006; Pérez-Lopez et al., 2008). According to the above referred authors, 

the abandoned mines from IPB have additional environmental problems because some of their mine 

wastes are composed of reactive minerals (sulfides), which generate acid mine drainage. 

In the European Community, the mining accidents that occurred between 1966 and 2000 (Aberfan 

in Wales at 1966; Aznalcóllar in Spain at 1986; Baia Mare in Romania at 2000, etc.) highlighted the 

need for major reforms in mining laws (Scanell, 2012). Nowadays, the European Community 

Environmental Authorities recognize the requirement to minimize the environmental impact of mining 

areas and their wastes, as well as their rehabilitation after closure (Directive 2006/21/EC). 

Nevertheless, other European Directives (e.g. Council Directives 2009/147/EC and 92/43/EEC) focus 

the importance of the environmental conservation as a whole, or of some key biodiversity groups (e.g. 

birds) or habitats. 

In Portugal, few research programs have been developed on abandoned mines from Portuguese 

IPB aiming to contribute to their environmental assessment and monitoring of the contamination (e.g. 

Matos and Martins, 2006; Quental et al., 2002; Oliveira et al., 2013; Reis et al., 2012). Whereas active 

mines can have efficient procedures of environmental management, the rehabilitation programs of the 

abandoned mines, generally focus on public safety. 

The rehabilitation of abandoned mines in the IPB must embrace ecological and economical 

approaches. Phytotechnologies are emerging, and are successful in situ tools to remediate 

contaminated soils due to their lower cost-effective and environmental impact as well as easier 

implementation in larger areas, compared to conventional ex situ engineering methods. Among the in 

situ technologies, phytostabilisation is considered the most suitable for rehabilitation of different mine 

wastes or soils developed on mine wastes with multielemental contamination and located in 

Mediterranean conditions (Abreu and Magalhães, 2009; Mendez and Maier, 2008; Sheoran et al., 

2010). Although the total concentrations of trace elements did not change with the presence of plants, 

the above referred authors mentioned that the establishment of vegetation cover leads to landscape 

and soil functions improvement, increase of biodiversity, control of the water and wind erosion and of 

the contamination, by reducing trace elements availability and leaching in the soils/tailings. 

At medium-long term, the success of the phytostabilisation and ecological succession in the mining 

areas depends on the knowledge of the characteristics of spoils and contaminated soils, rhizosphere 

processes as well as the behaviour of spontaneous, autochthones and pioneer plants (e.g. uptake, 

translocation, accumulation, chelation) (Abreu and Magalhães, 2009; Mendez and Maier, 2008; Pilon-

Smits, 2005). These plant populations are usually specific ecotypes well adapted to mining conditions 

(metallophytes) and, in Mediterranean conditions also to drought and nutritional stresses. The 

ecological behaviour of distinct plant species from IPB mining areas has been studied by several 

authors (e.g. Abreu et al., 2012a,b; Anawar et al., 2011; Batista et al., 2007; Chopin and Alloway, 

2007; de la Fuente et al., 2010; Freitas et al., 2004). 

Cistus ladanifer L. is one of the spontaneous species considered promising for phytostabilisation of 

mining areas with multielemental contamination (Abreu et al., 2011; Alvarenga et al., 2004; Anawar et 

al., 2011; Freitas et al., 2004; Lázaro et al., 2006; Murciego et al., 2007; Pratas et al., 2005; Santos et 

al., 2012). However, the majority of the studies in the field with this species (Abreu et al., 2011; 

Alvarenga et al., 2004; Anawar et al., 2011; Batista et al., 2013; Casado et al., 2007; Durães et al., 

2015; Freitas et al., 2004; Lázaro et al., 2006; Murciego et al., 2007; Pratas et al., 2005; Santos et al., 

2012, 2014a) focus, mainly, ecological behaviour and plant–soil relationships of some potentially 

hazardous elements (e.g. As, Cu, Pb, Zn) while for other potentially hazardous and non-essential 

elements (e.g. Al, Ag, Ba, Bi, Se) this information is scarce. It is also important to emphasize that the 

knowledge about the plant behaviour regarding these chemical elements, in different substrata and 

mining conditions, is scarce despite of its importance for the performance improvement of global 

rehabilitation programs. 

Independently of the concentrations of elements in soils, C. ladanifer develops several tolerance 

mechanisms, which allow its adaptability to contaminated environments. Examples of this adaptability 

mechanisms are: trace elements immobilization in roots, accumulation in senescent leaves, 

maintenance of low concentrations of trace elements in young leaves appearing in Spring, presence of 

effective antioxidant enzyme-based defence systems, and translocation of N to young leaves, where it 

is reused, during the senescence (Abreu et al., 2011; Alvarenga et al., 2004; Batista et al., 2013; 

Durães et al., 2015; Santos et al., 2009, 2012, 2013, 2014a). 

The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the potential of C. ladanifer in the phytostabilisation of 

the soils, developed on different substrata (mine wastes, and schists and greywackes or their 

mixtures) and containing non-essential elements (Al, Ag, Ba, Bi, Cd, Sb, and Sr), from three 

Portuguese IPB mining areas (Caveira, Lousal, and São Domingos). The uptake, accumulation and 

translocation of these non-essential elements, and their influence on the concentrations of major 

nutrients and beneficial elements (Co, Na and Se) in C. ladanifer were studied. 

 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Site characterization 
 

Caveira, Lousal and São Domingos mining areas are included in the Portuguese IPB, Alentejo 

region, where the climate is typically Mediterranean (semiarid mesothermic). The Caveira and Lousal 

mines are located in the northwest region of the IPB, approximately 12 km away from each other, 

while São Domingos is in the northern sector of the IPB (about 120 km far from Caveira) (Fig. 1). 

According to Matos and Matins (2006), the massive sulfide deposits in the three mines were classified 

as medium (5?50 Tg) being exploited, approximately, in the same time period.

São Domingos) and respective sampling areas. 

 

During Roman times, massive sulfide deposits and/or gossan from the Caveira and São Domingos 

were intensively exploited. The modern exploitation started in the XIXth century (Caveira: 1854, 

Lousal: 1900; São Domingos: 1857) ceasing between 1960 and 1980 with the abandonment of the 



Cistus ladanifer phytostabilizing soils contaminated with non-essential chemical elements 

80 

 

mines (Matos and Martins, 2006; Matos et al., 2008; Quental et al., 2002). The mine closures led to 

social and economic degradation in the region. 

High level of environmental hazard was reported to the three mine areas taking into account the 

dimension of the areas affected by tailings, the volume of spoils and tailings, the multielemental 

contamination, and the available concentrations of trace elements in the different mine wastes/soils 

(Álvarez-Valero et al., 2008; Matos and Martins, 2006; Pérez-López et al., 2008).  

 

Field sampling  
 

Eighteen sampling areas with ?10 m
2
 each were selected (seven in Caveira, two in Lousal and 

nine in São Domingos; Fig. 1). These areas included representative soils where C. ladanifer is a 

dominant species growing, together or not, with other species of Cistaceae and Ericaceae families 

and, in Caveira mine, with sparse tree cover of Quercus suber L.. The soils from Caveira and São 

Domingos are classified as Spolic Technosol Toxic (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2007) while Lousal 

soils are Lithic Leptosol (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2007) influenced by adjacent tailings and/or acid 

mine drainage. Soil properties depended on materials where soils were developed presenting, in 

general, pH values considered moderately acid or acid, low electrical conductivity (except in Lousal) 

and variable fertility (Table 1; Santos et al., 2014a). 

Composite samples of soils and C. ladanifer (roots and shoots composed of leaves and twigs from 

at least three plants) were collected in the Spring of 2010 in each sampling area. Soil samples were 

collected in the surrounding of the C. ladanifer radicular system. Each soil sampling (?3 kg) was a 

homogenate of soil samples from, at least, three trial points located around the plants’ roots at 20 cm 

depth.

Characterization of soils and plants 

 

The soil samples were air-dried, homogenized and sieved. In the soil fraction &amp;lt;2 mm was done a 

classical characterisation (Póvoas and Barral, 1992): pH and electrical conductivity (EC) in water 

suspension (1:2.5 m/V); organic C (Tinsley method ? oxidation with dichromate; Tinsley, 1950); 

extractable P and K (Egner-Riehm method ? ammonium lactate-acetic acid extractant; Egnér et al., 

1960) and total N (Kjeldahl method). 

Total concentrations of beneficial (Co, Na and Se) and non-essential elements (Al, Ag, Ba, Bi, Cd, 

Sb and Sr) in soils (fraction &amp;lt;2 mm) were analysed in an international accredited laboratory using ICP 

and INAA, after digestion with a mixture of four acids (Actlabs, ISO/IEC 17025, Activation 

Laboratories, 2014a). The same elements were analysed by ICP-MS and ICP-OES (Activation 

Laboratories, 2014b) in soil extractable solution that simulates the rizosphere conditions (RHIZO 

solution; Feng et al., 2005). 

Roots and shoots samples were washed with tap water and then with distilled water. The roots 

were still sonicated in distilled water for 30 min. Plant samples were dried at 40 ºC, homogenized and 

finely ground. In these samples were determined the concentrations of the same elements than in 

soils by ICP-MS, after ashing at 475 °C and nitric acid digestion (Activation Laboratories, 2014c). 

 

Data analysis 

 

Data were analysed by a one way ANOVA and the Duncan test (p &amp;lt;0.05), using the statistical 

programme SPSS v18.0 for Windows, in order to identify differences among plant populations. 

Differences between concentrations of the elements in roots and shoots from the same population 

were analysed non-parametrically using Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA by Ranks test. For statistical 

purposes, the results below the detection limit were assumed as half of the detection limit while for the 

results in over range was considered the limit value of the range. Bivariate Pearson correlations were 

used to correlate the soil and plant characteristics (r &gt; 0.85). Quality control of the analysis was made 

by analytical replicate samples, use of certified standard solutions and laboratory standards at the 

Activation Laboratories.  

Three coefficients reported by Huang and Cunningham (1996), Brook (1998) and Perelman (1966) 

were calculated to evaluate the potential of C. ladanifer for phytostabilization purpose: Soil-plant 

transfer coefficient (TransferC = [total shoots element]/[total soil element]), translocation coefficient 

(TranslC = [total shoots element]/[total roots element]), biological absorption coefficient (BAC = [total 

roots element]/[available soil element]). Soil-plant transfer and translocation coefficients have been 

considered as key parameters of the possible use of plants for phytostabilisation purposes (Mendez 

and Maier, 2008). 

Soil-plant transfer coefficient indicates the accumulation behaviour of the plant (the plants can be 

considered as accumulator (TransferC &gt; 1) or non-accumulator/excluder of a specific element 

(TransferC &amp;lt;1)). The translocation of an element from roots to shoots was evaluated by the 

translocation coefficient while uptake capacity was assessed by biological absorption coefficient.

According to Perelman (1966), BAC can be divided in five groups, which indicate the intensity of 

absorption by the roots (Intensive: 10 &amp;lt;BAC &amp;lt;100; Strong: 1 &amp;lt;BAC &amp;lt;10; Intermediate: 0.1 &amp;lt;BAC &amp;lt;

1; Weak: 0.01 &amp;lt;BAC &amp;lt;0.1; Very weak: 0.001 &amp;lt;BAC &amp;lt;0.01). 

 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Soil characteristics  
 

Chemical characteristics of the soils present, in general, great heterogeneity, which is related to the 

properties of the mine wastes and host rock from which they were developed (Tables 1 and 2). The 

total concentrations of Al, Ag, Ba, Bi and Sb as well as beneficial elements (Na and Se) in soils from 

three mining areas did not present any significant differences, despite of the variability observed in 

Caveira and São Domingos. Soils from São Domingos presented the highest total concentrations of 

Cd and Sr, while the highest value for Co was measured in Lousal (Table 2).

Cistus ladanifer phytostabilizing soils contaminated with non-essential chemical elements

Total concentrations of all non-essential and beneficial elements in the studied soils were in the 

range of the values reported for several mine wastes and/or soils from the same mines (Anawar et al., 

2011; Álvarez-Valero et al., 2008; Ferreira da Silva et al., 2005; Pérez-López et al., 2008; Reis et al., 

2012). Soils from the three mine areas had total concentrations of Ba and Sb that exceeded, the 

maximum allowed values (MAV) proposed by the Canadian legislation (500 mg Ba/kg for 

residential/parkland use, and 20–40 mg Sb/kg depending on the land uses; CCME, 2007), while 

Caveira and São Domingos soils also exceeded the MAV for Se considering commercial/industrial use 

(3 mg/kg; CCME, 2007).  

Although the total concentrations of the studied elements in these mine soils can be relatively high 

(Table 2), the soil available fractions were usually small in all the mine areas (&amp;lt;8.6 % of the total 

concentration; Table 3).

The same geochemical partitioning was reported for other chemical elements (e.g. As, Cu, Pb, Zn), 

extracted with the same aqueous solution, in soils from the same mine areas (Abreu et al., 2012a,b; 

Santos et al., 2014a). In the present study, Cd is the exception, varying its available fraction between 

10 and 100 % of the total concentration in the three mine areas.  

Regarding the concentrations of the elements in the available fraction (Table 3), Caveira soils had 

higher concentrations of non-essential elements than those in soils from Lousal (Ag, Ba, Bi and Sb) 

and São Domingos (Ba and Bi), whereas the concentrations of Co, Na and Sr in soils from Lousal 

reached the highest values. For Cd and Se, no significant differences among the three areas were 

observed for their concentrations in the soils available fraction. 

In general, no correlations were obtained between the elemental concentrations in the soil 

available fraction and the pH, the Corganic concentrations, and the total concentrations of the studied 

elements in Caveira and São Domingos soils. Bismuth was an exception because a correlation (r = 

0.92) was found between its concentration in the available fraction and the total concentration in soils 

from Caveira. 

 

Chemical elements in plants 

Non-essential chemical elements 

 

The concentrations of the studied chemical elements in the roots and shoots of the C. ladanifer 

plants from the three mining areas are given in Tables 4 and 5, respectively. Non-essential elements 

can be important environmental contaminants in mining areas causing often phytotoxicity. In the three 

mine areas, the uptake (evaluated by the biological absorption coefficient (BAC) calculation; Table 6) 

of Ag by C. ladanifer can be considered intense depending on the population. However, the uptake 

capacity of Al, Ba, Bi, Cd and Sr varied between strong and intensive (Table 6) according to the 

population (plants from São Domingos present mainly intensive uptake), the chemical element, and 

even the sampled plants from the same population. Besides these factors, the uptake rate can also 

depend on the soil properties, the rhizosphere effects, the roots system, and the stage of plant 

development (Abreu et al., 2014; Kabata-Pendias, 2011). Cistus ladanifer ability to uptake the non-

essential elements (except for Cd) were high, which according to Kabata-Pendias (2011) is not 

consistent with the tendency observed for the plants in general. On the contrary, Cd seems to be 

easily uptake by the C. ladanifer roots as also reported by Adriano (2001) for plants in general.  

Aluminium, Ag, Ba, Bi, Cd and Sr were stored in roots having, in the majority of the plant samples, 

higher concentrations than in the available soil fraction, but not higher than the total soil 

concentrations. In some plants sampled in Caveira and São Domingos was still observed that Cd 

concentration in the roots were between 1 and 7-fold higher than the total concentration in the soils, 

suggesting a great uptake and root accumulation capacity of this metal by this species. Plant roots can 

change the pH values of the rhizosphere and exudate compounds that affect availability of the 

chemical elements and their uptake by the plant (Abreu et al., 2014; Pilon-Smits, 2005).  

Although the uptake and roots storage of Al, Ag, Ba, Bi, Cd and Sr can reach large concentrations, 

the Sb had a distinct behaviour. Thus, independently of the mine area, the uptake of Sb seemed be 



Cistus ladanifer phytostabilizing soils contaminated with non-essential chemical elements 

85 

 

more or less restricted (uptake considered mainly intermediate; Table 6) and the concentrations of this 

element in the roots were lower than its concentration in the available soils fraction. This fact can 

suggest the existence of a tolerance mechanism (Kabata-Pendias, 2011). Nevertheless, although in 

São Domingos population have some plants with strong uptake of Sb (Table 6), no tendency between 

variation intrapopulation and the concentration of this element in the available soil fraction was 

observed.

Comparing concentrations of non-essential elements in the roots, only for Al and Cd were observed 

significant differences among populations. However no correlations were obtained between 

concentrations of Al and Cd in roots and the soil concentrations of the same elements (total and/or 

available fraction). The higher roots concentrations of Cd in São Domingos plants, compared to other

populations, can be a consequence of the high absorption capacity of this element by the plants 

(Table 6).

The concentrations of the studied non-essential elements in the roots of C. ladanifer did not 

influence the concentrations of nutrients in the same organ (Santos et al., 2014a). However, the Sr 

concentrations in roots collected in São Domingos can have an antagonism effect (r = ?0.92) in the Fe 

concentrations in the same plant roots (Fe data in Santos et al., 2014a).

In general, C. ladanifer from the three populations showed great capacity to translocate the non-

essential elements (except Sr) from roots to shoots (Table 7), despite of the intrapopulation variability. 

Translocation of Al from roots to shoots in C. ladanifer was also reported by Durães et al. (2015). 

Interpopulation variability in the translocation behaviour of some non-essential elements was also 

observed (Table 7). For instance, Caveira plants stored, mainly, Al, Bi, Sb and Sr in their roots while 

the same behaviour was observed only for Ag and Sr in São Domingos plants. The heterogeneity in 

the translocation behaviour can be related to the plant age and transpiration rate of the shrubs (Pilon-

Smits, 2005). However, similar concentrations of non-essential elements (except Cd) in the roots and 

shoots from the same population were observed. Independently of the translocation behaviour, 

concentrations of the non-essential elements in the C. ladanifer shoots from the three populations did 

not reach phytotoxic levels (5–10 mg Ag/kg, 500 mg Ba/kg, 5–30 mg Cd/kg and 150 mg Sb/kg; 

Kabata-Pendias, 2011) and were below the maximum tolerable levels (MTL) for domestic animals 

(mg/kg ? Al: 1000, Ag: 100, Ba: 100; Bi: 500-1000, Cd: 10, Sr: 2000; NCR, 2005). Only some plants 

growing in São Domingos mine area had Al concentrations in the shoots, between 1265 and 2503 

mg/kg, which exceeded the MTL (NCR, 2005). However, C. ladanifer is not used as feed for the 

domestic animals. 

Cistus ladanifer shoots from Caveira and São Domingos had higher Cd concentrations than in the 

roots (São Domingos: between 2 and 5-fold; Caveira: between 1 and 3-fold) (Tables 4 and 5), which 

agree with the high mobility of this element into the plants (Adriano, 2001; Kabata-Pendias, 2011).

Considerable translocation of Cd from roots to shoots was also obtained in C. ladanifer from different 

proveniences growing in hydroponic solutions (Kidd et al., 2004).

As for roots, only the concentrations of Al and Cd in the shoots were significantly different among 

populations. São Domingos plants showed the highest shoots concentrations of these elements, 

compared to the other populations, despite of the existence of similar concentrations of these metals 

in mine soils (total and available fraction (only for Cd)). The concentrations of the elements in plants 

are, in general, the result of a set of plant behaviours, like uptake, accumulation in roots, translocation 

from roots to shoots, tolerance and synergism/antagonism processes, and can also be independent of 

the concentrations of the elements in the soil (Kabata-Pendias, 2011). Some authors (Kidd et al., 

2004; Lázaro et al., 2006; Santos et al., 2012, 2013) reported that the accumulation capacity of 

several elements (contaminants and nutrients) in C. ladanifer depends on element and population. 



Cistus ladanifer phytostabilizing soils contaminated with non-essential chemical elements 

89 

 

As far as we know, there are few data concerning the concentrations of non-essential elements in 

C. ladanifer, especially in the roots (Tables 4 and 5). Thus, in spite of the intrapopulation variability of 

concentrations of the studied elements in the roots and shoots of the same species growing in other 

contaminated and non-contaminated areas studied by other authors (Tables 4 and 5), they were, in 

general, higher than those obtained in the present study. Although concentrations of Ag and Sb in 

Caveira plant shoots were not considered phytotoxic for plants in general, these elements 

concentrations seem to influence negatively Ca concentrations (Santos et al., 2014a) in the same 

plant part (rAg = ?0.88 and rSb = ?0.86).  

The calculated values of the soil-plant transfer coefficient indicated that, in the three populations, 

the C. ladanifer is non-accumulator and excluder of Al, Ag, Ba, Bi, Sr and Sb (TransferC&amp;lt;&amp;lt;1). Same 

result was reported for Al and C. ladanifer growing in the Iberian Pyrite Belt mines (Durães et al., 

2015). An exception was observed in one sampling area from Caveira, where the available fraction of 

Ba corresponded to 12 % of the total concentration (the largest percentage obtained) and the plants 

were accumulators of this element. For Cd, all plants growing in São Domingos (1.1 &amp;lt;TransferC &amp;lt;

18.2) and some plants from Caveira can be considered as accumulators (0.2 &amp;lt;TransferC &amp;lt;3.2). In 

spite of the accumulation and translocation behaviours of Ba and Cd, the concentrations of these 

elements in the shoots indicate that none C. ladanifer population is considered a hyperaccumulator. 

 

Beneficial chemical elements 

 

Beneficial chemical elements can promote the growth or be essential for some plant species. 

However, the function and concentration vary with element and plant species (Pilon-Smits et al., 2009; 

de Varennes, 2003). Some authors report significant growth stimulation for some species in presence 

of Na besides its function as osmoticum and counter-ion during long-distance transport (de Varennes, 

2003; Pilon-Smits et al., 2009; Subbarao et al., 2003). 

Concentrations of the beneficial elements in the studied C. ladanifer roots had slight variations 

(Table 4) and were higher than the available soil fractions of the same elements (Table 3). However, a 

general tendency of absorption and accumulation of these elements by the plants can be defined (Se 

&amp;lt;Co &amp;lt;Na).  

The uptake of Na and Se (evaluated by the biological absorption coefficient (BAC) calculation) in 

plants from the three populations was strong-intense (Table 6). This fact can explain the no existence 

of significant differences among the concentrations of these elements in the roots (Table 4). 

However, Co concentrations in the roots showed inter-populational variability (Table 4), which was 

not explained by the Co concentrations in the soils (Tables 2 and 3) as well as by the differences in 

the plants uptake behaviour. Caveira and Lousal populations showed intermediate uptake behaviour 

for Co while the Co uptake behaviour in the plants from São Domingos can be considered mainly high 

(Table 6).  

As reported for nutrients (Santos et al., 2014a) and Na (Durães et al., 2015) in the same species, 

the majority of the studied C. ladanifer plants also translocated the beneficial elements from roots to 

shoots (Table 7). However, the distribution of these elements between roots and shoots depended on

element and population ([Se]roots = [Se]shoots for the three populations; ([Co and Na]shoots &gt; [Co and 

Na]roots in São Domingos and Caveira plants; [Co and Na]roots = [Co and Na]shoots in Lousal plants).  

The concentrations of beneficial elements in the shoots and roots presented the same statistical 

differences among the populations (similar concentrations of Na and Se among populations and Co 

concentrations higher in plants from Lousal and São Domingos than in Caveira; Tables 4 and 5). No 

clear tendency between the variability intra- and inter-population in the shoots and the concentrations 

of elements in the soils (total and soil available fraction) was observed. Concerning the plants 

translocation and uptake behaviours, for the same elements, also no clear tendency was observed. 

The variations that can be observed in the plant behaviours can be related to plant response to other 

elements or to the chemical elements interactions (synergisms or antagonisms), as well as 

ecophysiological characteristics of each population. 

Shoots of C. ladanifer collected in non-contaminated areas as well as in other mining areas 

showed a wide range of beneficial elements concentrations, being, in some cases, the results 

obtained in the present study (Table 5 and references therein) within the same range. Nonetheless, 

concentrations of Co and Se in the shoots from the three populations were in the range considered 

sufficient and normal (0.02?1 mg Co/kg, 0.01–2 mg Se/kg; Kabata-Pendias, 2011) for plants in 

general. Moreover, concentrations of these elements in the shoots were also below the maximum 

tolerable levels for domestic animals (25?100 mg Co/kg and 3?5 mg Se/kg; NCR, 2005). 

The three C. ladanifer populations were non-accumulators of Co, Na and Se (TransferC &amp;lt;1). 

Durães et al. (2015) also found that C. ladanifer from Lousal, Aljustrel and São Domingos were non-

accumulators of Na. In general, concentrations of non-essential elements in the shoots or roots did not 

influence negatively the concentrations of the beneficial elements in the same organs. However, the 

shoots from Caveira plants showed a possible negative effect between concentrations of Sr and Na (r 

= ?0.89). Antagonism interaction between Na and Mn (r = ?0.85, Mn data in Santos et al., 2014a) in 

the roots of the plants collected in São Domingos was also observed. Similar interaction between Na 

and Mn was also reported by Kabata-Pendias (2011) for the plants in general. 

 

Design considerations for the use of Cistus ladanifer in phytostabilisation programs 

 

Cistus ladanifer can be indicated as a suitable species in rehabilitation of several mining areas from 

IPB due to its capacity and adaptability to colonize soils developed on different substrata (mine wastes 

and/or host rocks), where co-exist contamination of Ba, Se and Sb (according to values indicated by 

CCME, 2007) as well as other potentially hazardous elements like As and Pb (Reis et al., 2012; 

Santos et al., 2012, 2014a). Moreover, C. ladanifer shows a good vegetative development and 

absence of visual signs of phytotoxicity and/or deficiency of any elements, independently of soils 

characteristics where the population grows.  

This species still has several characteristics/behaviours, which according to Mendez and Maier 

(2008) are considered adequate to its use in phytostabilisation programs of soils/wastes contaminated 

with non-essential elements. In spite of the relative small biomass production and the slow growth of 

C. ladanifer, this species is a non-accumulator plant (indicated by the soil-plant transfer coefficient) of 



Cistus ladanifer phytostabilizing soils contaminated with non-essential chemical elements

non-essential elements, have high concentrations of these elements in the roots as well as high 

uptake (indicated by the biological absorption coefficient), but low concentrations in the shoots. 

Although the non-essential elements can be translocated from the roots to the shoots, the shoots 

concentrations are low, below phytotoxic limit, and do not pose any environmental risk by their intake. 

Natural attenuation of the contamination has been observed in the contaminated soils of some 

mining areas as a consequence of spontaneous plant colonization (Abreu et al., 2011; Batista et al., 

2007). However, natural colonization presents, over time, different plant density and success, which 

depends on physical and chemical characteristics of the mine soils/wastes and tailings as well as 

colonizing capacity of the plant species (Valente et al., 2012). This process is slow and can minimize 

the leaching and spread of contaminants at long-term, but not always at short-term (Burgos et al., 

2013). According to the same authors, it is necessary a speedy assisted remediation. 

The addition of amendments, namely organic and inorganic wastes, is essential to promote the 

germination, establishment, colonization and development of the pioneer species, like C. ladanifer, in 

contaminated environments with low organic matter and nutrients content, and lack of structure in the 

substrata materials (Abreu and Magalhães, 2009; Wong, 2003). The improvement of the spontaneous 

plants individual growth can densify the natural populations. In fact, Kidd et al. (2007) reported an 

enhanced in C. ladanifer shoot biomass growing in non-contaminated soils amended with sewage 

sludge. In gossan mine wastes amended with a mixture of organic and inorganic wastes, the 

germination and development of this species was significantly improved, without the increase of the 

majority of the potentially hazardous elements concentrations in the available fraction and leachates 

(Santos et al., 2014b, 2015). It has been observed a microbial activity increase in the amended 

gossan wastes with plant development (Santos et al., 2014b, 2015), which contributes to the 

biogeochemical cycling and pedogenesis. 

The application of amendments mixtures composed of several organic/inorganic residues, instead 

of using a single waste, can be more efficient in the rehabilitation process of this type of mining areas 

(Kumpiene et al., 2008). Nevertheless, the mixtures of amendments and application rates should be 

adjusted to the characteristics of each soil/tailing in order to make a specific Technosol that promotes 

and maintains biogeochemical processes along the time (Macías et al., 2011).  

Although organic/inorganic wastes (from Technosols or not) can supply N to plant/soil community, 

the majority of N comes from N-fixation and its mineralization. In order to self-sustain the 

phytostabilisation, the use of different tolerant and autochthones plants species is recommended 

because they can perform distinct functional roles in the habitat. Hence, the use of plants from the 

Fabaceae (Leguminosae) family and/or other N-fixing species within the plant community can be an 

advantage in the process (Ahmad et al., 2012; Wong, 2003) when using ecotypes isolated from 

metal(loids) contaminated soils. According to the same authors, the contaminants can reduce the 

growth and multiplication of Rhizobia and affect the steps involved in Leguminosae–Rhizobium 

symbiosis, what contributes to a lower N fixation.  

To guarantee a similar ecological behaviour and tolerance to the co-existence of various stress 

conditions from mining areas, the use of seeds collected in contaminated areas in phytostabilisation 

programs of heavily contaminated soils is recommended.

There are many tangible and intangible economic opportunities (also designated as direct and 

indirect values) for phytostabilisation. However, due to its complexity, an accurate economic 

evaluation of this technology is very difficult. Several intangible benefits are known, (e.g. carbon 

sequestration, erosion control, landscape aesthetics), as well as more tangible ones, like decrease of 

the contamination in the water and surrounding soils and the improvement of soils characteristics. The 

economic valorisation of the improvement of the ecological functions and the identification of target 

groups, which benefit from the mine rehabilitation, is difficult to assess.  

Phytostabilisation programs have low installation and maintenance costs compared to other 

remediation options. Several industrial or agro-industrial wastes can be included in a strategy for 

wastes valorisation, through the design of a Technosol, instead of end up in landfills (Macías et al., 

2011). This technology can increase the incomes from non-productive contaminated soils if associated 

to species with economic value (Licht and Isebrands, 2005). Different options can be economically 

viable for C. ladanifer, as production of pellets, essential oils and extraction of compounds for 

pharmaceutical and cosmetic. However, it is essential the assessment of the environmental and public 

safety risk of these products derived from contaminated areas. 

 

CONCLUSIONS 

 

Soils developed on different substrata from Caveira, Lousal and São Domingos mining areas have 

multielemental contamination with high total concentrations of some non-essential elements (Ba and 

Sb for the three mine areas and Se for Caveira and São Domingos). However, the soil available 

fractions of non-essential elements were usually low what reduce the environmental risk. 

Independently of the mine area and soil characteristics, C. ladanifer colonized the contaminated 

soils showing large capacity of tolerance and adaptability to limiting conditions for vegetation growth. 

According to the ecophysiological behaviours (uptake, translocation and accumulation) of this species 

that led to the great uptake and roots accumulation of non-essential elements but low shoots 

accumulation, and consequently low toxicity for domestic animals and even low intake risk, this 

species can be considered a good choice for phytostabilisation. Furthermore, its potential economic 

value can be a considerable income for implementation of this technology. 

Caveira and São Domingos mines are in an abandoned state and have great areas affected by 

old mining processes, so phytostabilisation technology using autochthonous plant species (e.g. C. 

ladanifer) can be an attempt to reduce the costs of their rehabilitation.

This study aimed to: i) evaluate the accumulation and translocation patterns of potentially hazardous 

elements into the Lavandula pedunculata and their influence in the concentrations of nutrients; and ii) 

compare some physiological responses associated with oxidative stress (concentration of chlorophylls 

(Chla, Chlb and total), carotenoids, and total protein) and several components involved in tolerance 

mechanisms (concentrations of proline and acid-soluble thiols and total/specific activity of catalase 

(CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD)), in plants growing in soils with a multielemental 

contamination and non-contaminated. Composite samples of soils, developed on mine wastes and/or 

host rocks, and L. pedunculata (roots and shoots) were collected in São Domingos mine (SE of 

Portugal) and in a reference area with non-contaminated soils, Corte do Pinto, with the same climatic 

conditions.  

São Domingos soils had high total concentrations of several hazardous elements (e.g. As and Pb) but 

their available fractions were small (mainly&amp;lt;5.8 % of the total). Translocation behaviour of elements 

was not clear according to the physiological importance of the elements. In general, plant shoots from 

São Domingos had the highest elements concentrations, but only As, Mn and Zn reached phytotoxic 

concentrations. Concentration of Chlb in shoots from São Domingos was higher than those from Corte 

do Pinto. No significant differences were obtained between concentrations of Chla, total protein, 

proline and acid-soluble thiols in shoots collected in both areas, as well as SOD activity (total and 

specific) and specific CAT activity. Total CAT activity varied with population being lower in the shoots 

of the plants from São Domingos, but no correlation was obtained between this enzymatic activity and 

the concentrations of the studied elements in shoots. 

Lavandula pedunculata plants are able to survive in soils developed on different mine wastes with 

multielemental contamination and low fertility showing no symptoms (visible and physiological) of 

phytotoxicity or deficiency.

INTRODUCTION 

 

Over several decades and until the publication of Directive 2006/21/EC, which requires the 

landscape rehabilitation after mine closure, the mining activity in Portuguese Iberian Pyrite Belt (PIPB) 

was carried out without any environmental concerns. Over time, the extraction and processing of the 

ore produced different mining wastes which were disposed in an uncontrolled and irregularly way in all 

the mine areas (Matos and Martins, 2006). As a consequence, significant environmental problems 

were occurring (e.g. contamination of soils and waters and reduction of biodiversity), not only in the 

mining area but also in the adjacent areas, due to the chemical characteristics of the mine wastes in 

the PIPB (e.g. acid mine generation and high total concentrations of trace elements in tailings and 

leachates) (Matos and Martins, 2006; Abreu and Magalhães, 2009).  

Mining areas from PIPB become extreme environments where coexist many stress factors for the 

plants: high total concentrations of potentially hazardous elements in the soils/mine wastes and 

leachates as well as soil water deficit and low soils/wastes pH and fertility. However, some tailings and 

soils developed on some mine wastes are naturally colonized by spontaneous vegetation, which 

improves the physical, chemical and biological characteristics of the substrata and, consequently, 

contributes to the pedogenesis and the natural rehabilitation of the area (Wong, 2003; Abreu and 

Magalhães, 2009). Although very few species occur only in the specific conditions of the mining areas 

(e.g. Erica andevalensis Cabezudo &amp;amp; Rivera), other species (e.g. several species from Cistus genus) 

are able to grow in contaminated and non-contaminated areas (Abreu et al., 2012a; Santos et al., 

2012) being specific ecotypes. These tolerant ecotypes can be classified as obligate or facultative 

metallophytes having effective tolerance mechanisms (Nadgórska-Socha et al., 2013). 

In stress conditions, like metal/metalloid toxicity, several physiological processes in the plants (e.g. 

photosynthesis and growth) can be affected due to an increase of the production of reactive oxygen 

species (ROS) and their accumulation in the cells. Nonetheless, plants have several antioxidative 

defence responses to scavenge ROS (Pang et al., 2003; Cao et al., 2004; S?omka et al., 2008; 

Nadgórska-Socha et al., 2013): produce or stimulate antioxidative enzymes (e.g. catalase – CAT and 

superoxide dismutase – SOD) and/or non-enzymatic components (e.g. acid-soluble thiols, carotenoids 

and proline), which remove and/or neutralize the ROS. Superoxide dismutase catalyses the 

transformation of ROS generating H2O2 (Cao et al., 2004), while CAT is involved in the H2O2 removal 

generated by SOD (Grant and Loake, 2000). Proline accumulation is a very effective mechanism of 

quencher of ROS and redox active metal ions binder but it also activates and protects some enzymes 

related to antioxidative defence (Tekli? et al., 2008). Thiols are also capable of binding metal ions and 

forming non-toxic complexes with metals (Nadgórska-Socha et al., 2013). 

Lavandula pedunculata (Mill.) Cav. (Sin. L. sampaiana (Rozeira) Rivas Mart., T.E. Díaz &amp;amp; Fern. 

Gonz and L. stoechas L. subsp. pedunculata (Mill.) Samp. Ex Rozeira) is one of the autochthones and 

spontaneous species identified in São Domingos mining area (Freitas et al., 2004a), an abandoned 

mining area from the Iberian Pyrite Belt (SE of Portugal), however the knowledge about its 

ecophysiological behaviour under contaminated conditions is scarce. This information about the 

interaction between stress factors, in this case the multielemental contamination, and physiological

processes can be useful in the design of a strategy for revegetation of mining areas (Nadgórska-

Socha et al., 2013), namely production sustainability improvement and efficient agricultural zoning 

(Campostrini and Glenn, 2007). 

This study aimed to: i) evaluate the accumulation and translocation patterns of potentially 

hazardous elements into L. pedunculata and their influence in the concentrations of the nutrients; and 

ii) compare some physiological responses associated with oxidative stress (concentration of 

chlorophylls, carotenoids and total protein) and several components involved in tolerance mechanisms 

(concentrations of proline and acid-soluble thiols and total/specific activity of catalase and superoxide 

dismutase) in plants growing in soils with a multielemental contamination (São Domingos mining area) 

and non-contaminated (Corte do Pinto) with the same climatic conditions. 

 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Site characterization 

 

For this work were studied two sites located in Alentejo region (SE, Portugal): a contaminated area, 

São Domingos mining area (SD), and a reference area with non-contaminated soils ? Corte do Pinto 

(CP). In both areas, L. pedunculata is a representative species in the vegetation community. The 

climate in these areas is typically Mediterranean (semiarid mesothermic ? Thornthwaite classification). 

São Domingos is an old copper mine located in the PIBP, which has been abandoned since 1960. The 

first mining activities date from pre-roman period with Ag, Au and Cu exploitation, in the gossan. Then 

in modern times, exploitation occurred between the middle of XIX century until 60’s, for Cu, S, Au, Pb 

and Zn in both the gossan and massive sulfides (Quental et al., 2002). During the several exploitation 

periods, large amounts of mining wastes were produced and spread, irregularly, along the mine area 

(Álvarez-Valero et al., 2008). The chemical characteristics of these mine wastes represent a high 

environmental risk (Pérez-López et al., 2008; Álvarez-Valero et al., 2008). The sampling areas are 

located within the mine area where soils are incipient and were developed on mixtures, in variable 

proportions, of different mine wastes and host rocks being classified as Spolic Technosol Toxic (IUSS 

Working Group WRB, 2007). In the mining area, there are also some soils developed on schists and 

greywackes (Lithic Leptosols; IUSS Working Group WRB, 2007), which are influenced by adjacent 

tailings and/or acid mine drainage. 

Corte do Pinto area is located about 4 km to north of São Domingos mine. In the sampling areas, 

the soils were developed on schist and greywackes being classified as Lithic Leptosols (IUSS Working 

Group WRB, 2007). 

 

Field sampling 

 

Several sampling areas (six in SD mining area and three in CP), with ?10 m
2
 each, were selected 

to include representative soils where L. pedunculata was growing. The sampling was done in the 

spring of 2012 (April). In each sampling area, composite samples of soils (?3 kg of homogenate of, at 

least, three trial points) were collected in the surrounding of the L. pedunculata radicular system (until 



Mutielemental concentration and physiological responses of Lavandula pedunculata growing in soils developed on different 
mine wastes 

103 

 

a maximum of 20 cm depth). At the same time and in the same sampling areas, composite samples of 

roots (only São Domingos population) and shoots (composed of leaves and twigs) of L. pedunculata 

plants (homogenate of more than five plants, depending on the plants development stage) were 

collected. 

 

Soils characterization 

 

The soil samples were air-dried, homogenised, and sieved. Classical characterization of soils 

(fraction &amp;lt;2 mm) was carried out according to Póvoas and Barral (1992): pH and electrical 

conductivity (EC) in water suspension (1:2.5 m/V); organic carbon (Ströhlein method); extractable P 

and K (Egner-Riehm method) and total nitrogen (Kjeldahl method). 

The total concentrations of Al, As, Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, V and Zn in soils 

(fraction &amp;lt;2 mm) were determined by ICP and INAA, after acid digestion with perchloric acid + nitric 

acid + hydrochloric acid + hydrofluoric acid (Actlabs ISO/IEC 17025; Activation Laboratories, 2015a).  

The same elements were analysed in a soil extractable aqueous solution, which is composed of a 

mixture of organic acids (acetic acid + lactic acid + citric acid + malic acid + formic acid at 10 mmol/L 

for 16 h of agitation) that simulate rhizosphere conditions (RHIZO solution; Feng et al., 2005). These 

extractable soil solutions were analysed by ICP-MS and ICP-OES (Activation Laboratories, 2015b). 

 

Plants characterization: multielemental composition 

 

Roots from SD samples and shoot samples from both populations were washed with tap water and 

then with distilled water. The roots were still sonicated in distilled water for 30 min. Plant samples were 

dried at 40 ºC, homogenised and finely ground. The same elements than in soils were analysed by 

ICP-MS, after ashing (475 °C) over a 36 h period and nitric acid digestion (Activation Laboratories, 

2015c). 

 

Plants characterization: physiological analyses 

 

After washing, shoot samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at ?80 °C. Before the 

analysis, shoots were lyophilized, finely grounded and homogenised. 

 

Pigments determination 

 

The assay was based on MacKinney (1941). Shoot samples (0.1 g) were homogenised in 4 ml of 

80 % acetone (V:V) using a homogeniser at 500 g for 15 min, and then these samples were left to 

macerate for 2 h at 4 °C. The extracts were centrifuged and the supernatant used for pigments 

determination. The concentrations of chlorophyll a (Chla), chlorophyll b (Chlb), total chlorophyll (Chlt) 

and carotenoids were determined by UV-VIS spectrophotometry at 480, 645 and 663 nm using the 

equations described by MacKinney (1941) and Kirk and Allen (1965) for chlorophylls and carotenoids,

respectively. Acetone was used as the blank. Results were expressed as mg chlorophyll/g fresh 

weight and µmol carotenoids/g fresh weight. 

 

Proline determination 

 

The acid-ninhydrin method was used to determine the proline content (Bates et al., 1973). The free 

proline was extracted from 0.5 g of shoots in 5 ml of 3 % (m:V) aqueous sulfosalicylic acid. After 

centrifugation, the supernatant was mixed in 1:1:1 ratio with ninhydrin acid and glacial acetic acid and 

incubated at 100 °C for 1 h. The reaction mixture was placed on ice and extracted with 4 mL of 

toluene. The organic toluene phase containing the chromophore was separated and absorbance of 

the developed red colour was read at 520 nm. Toluene was used as the blank. Proline concentration 

was determined using a calibration curve and expressed as µg/g fresh weight. 

 

Total acid-soluble thiols determination 

 

Total acid-soluble thiols (–SH) was determined according to Ellman’s method (Ellman, 1959). 

Shoot samples (0.1 g) were homogenised in 2 ml 5 % (m:V) sulfosalicylic acid, containing 6.3 mM 

DTPA (pH&amp;lt;1), at 0 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10000 g for 15 min at 4 °C. The 

supernatants were collected and used for thiols determination. The supernatant (300 µl) was mixed 

with 630 µl of 0.5 M K2HPO4 (pH 7.5), and the absorbance measured after 2 min at 412 nm (30 °C). 

After addition of 25 µl of 5,50-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) solution (10 mM DTNB, 0.143 M 

K2HPO4, 6.3 mM DTPA, pH 7.5), the absorbance was again read at 412 nm after 2 min. Acid-soluble 

thiol concentrations were determined using the extinction coefficient (?) of DTNB (14150 M
-1

 cm
-1

) 

(Riddles, 1979). The results were expressed as µmol ?SH/g fresh weight. 

 

Total protein determination 

 

Total protein was determined in the supernatant used for quantification of the enzymatic activity 

according to Bradford (1976). Protein concentration was determined using a calibration curve of 

bovine serum albumin (BSA) and expressed as mg/g fresh weight. 

 

Enzyme extraction and activity quantification 

 

The enzymatic extract was obtained from 0.1 g of shoots with 10 mL of a 50 mM phosphate buffer 

solution (pH 7.2) containing 1 mM of EDTA, 1 % (m:V) of polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) and 1 M of 

NaCl (based on Santos et al., 2009). Extraction occurred for 15 min at 4 °C, with continuous agitation 

followed by centrifugation. The supernatant, constituting the enzymatic extract, was frozen and stored 

until further analysis. Substrate saturation and linear relation between enzyme activity and enzyme 

concentration was previously determined.

Quantification of catalase (CAT ? EC 1.11.1.6) activity was based on Chance and Maehly (1955) 

and Wong and Whitaker (2003). Solutions of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and 200 mM of H2O2 

were previously incubated at 25 °C. In quartz cuvettes, 800 µL of phosphate buffer, 320 µL of 

enzymatic extract and 80 µL of H2O2 were mixed. Reaction was started by the addition of H2O2. The 

decomposition of H2O2 was followed at 240 nm for 1 min and the slope of the linear portion of the 

curve relating absorbance at 240 nm with time was calculated (?Abs240 min

). The calculated slope 

was used to determine the CAT activity (µmol H2O2 min

 (Verma and Dubey 2003). Specific enzymatic activity (µmol H2O2 min

 protein) 

was also determined taking into account the protein concentration obtained in the same extract 

(section 2.5.4). 

Quantification of superoxide dismutase (SOD ? EC 1.15.1.1) activity was based on the method 

described by Sun and Zigman (1977) and Khopde et al. (2001). Solutions of 0.1 M of sodium 

carbonate-hidrogenocarbonate buffer (pH 10.0) and 5 mM of epinephrine (pH 2.0) were incubated at 

25 °C. In quartz cuvettes, 750 µL of buffer, 100?150 µL of sample and 150 µL of epinephrine were 

mixed. The enzymatic reaction was started by the addition of epinephrine. The increase of the 

absorbance was recorded at 320 nm for 1 min and the rate of epinephrine oxidation calculated by the 

slope (?Abs320 min
-1

) of the linear portion of the curve relating absorbance at 320 nm with time. The 

rate of epinephrine auto-oxidation was calculated in the same conditions but without enzymatic 

extract. One unit of SOD was defined as the amount of enzyme required to reduce the epinephrine 

auto-oxidation rate by 50 %. Specific enzymatic activity (U/mg protein) was also determined taking into 

account the protein concentration obtained in the same extract (section 2.5.4). 

 

Data analysis 

 

Differences between L. pedunculata populations were analysed non-parametrically using Kruskal–

Wallis ANOVA by Ranks test, with the statistical programme SPSS v18.0 for Windows. Bivariate 

Pearson correlations were used to correlate the soil and plant characteristics as well as the elements 

concentrations in the shoots and results of the physiological analyses (r &gt; 0.90). For statistical 

purposes, the results below the detection limit were assumed as half of the detection limit while for 

results exceeding the quantification range was considered the quantification limit value.  

The multielemental analyses (plants and soils) were done by Activation Laboratories which is 

accredited with ISO/IEC 17025 Quality System. Quality control of the other analysis was made by 

analytical duplicates samples (for each plant sample and physiological analysis) as well as the use of 

certified standard solutions and method reagent blank. 

Soil-plant transfer and translocation coefficients were calculated (Abreu et al., 2012a). Soil-plant 

transfer coefficient (TransferC = [total shoots element]/[total soil element]) indicates if the plants are 

considered as accumulator (TransferC &gt; 1) or non-accumulator of a specific element. The 

translocation capacity of an element, from roots to shoots, was evaluated by the translocation 

coefficient (TranslC = [total shoots element]/[total roots element]).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Characteristics of the soils 

 

Soils had great variability in their chemical characteristics, especially in the SD mining area. Soil 

characteristics (Tables 1 and 2) depend on materials where soils were developed. In fact, SD soils 

were developed on a very complex mixture of several mine wastes with or without host rocks, which 

contributes to a great heterogeneity in the soils properties. 

The pH of the soils from SD varied between acid, for soils developed on schist and sediments, and 

influenced by acid mine drainage, and slightly alkaline in soils developed on mixtures of host rocks 

and gossan. The pH values in the mine area were lower than those in the CP area (Table 1). In both 

areas, electrical conductivities and N concentrations were small and C organic concentrations were 

small–medium. However, in one soil sample from SD was measured a high C organic concentration 

(125.2 g/kg), which was different compared to the values of the other samples.

Concentrations of extractable P and K were different between the areas (Table 1). Although 

concentrations of extractable P can be considered small in both areas (INIA – LQARS, 2000), soils 

from CP had 3-fold more extractable P than soils from SD. Soil extractable K concentrations were 

medium-high and very high to the SD and Corte do Pinto areas, respectively (INIA – LQARS, 2000). In 

general, soil fertility in Corte do Pinto was slightly higher, compared to the SD area. 

The total concentrations of As, Fe, Pb, Sb, V and Zn were higher in soils from SD than from CP 

(Table 2), while the opposite was obtained for Cr and Mn. Despite of the variability, the total 

concentrations of Al, As, Cd, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb, V and Zn in the soils from SD are in the

same range than those reported for mine wastes and/or soils developed on mine wastes from the 

same mine area (Freitas et al., 2004a, 2009; Pérez-López et al., 2008; Álvarez-Valero et al., 2008; 

Anawar et al., 2011, 2013; Abreu et al., 2012a,b; Santos et al., 2012, 2014; Durães et al., 2015).  

For both areas, the total concentrations of As and Cu in the soils exceeded the maximum allowed 

values (MAV) for residential/parkland, commercial and industrial uses (12 mg As/kg and 63?91 mg 

Cu/kg; CCME, 2007). Moreover, all the studied soils from SD can be considered contaminated with Pb 

and Sb (160?600 mg Pb/kg and 20?40 mg Sb/kg, depending on land use; CCME, 2007), but only 

some samples are contaminated with V (MAV – 130 mg V/kg; CCME, 2007). The total concentrations 

of Cr and Ni in soils from CP were above MAV, but this fact is associated to the composition of the 

lithological materials (schists and greywackes) from which they were developed (Abreu et al., 2008; 

Tavares et al., 2008). 

Significant differences were obtained between the concentrations of several elements in the soils 

available fraction (Table 3): the available concentrations of the elements associated to mining 

exploitation (As, Cd, Cu, Pb, Sb and Zn) were higher in soils from SD than in CP soils, while the 

opposite was observed for Ca, K, Mg and Mn.  

Although soils from SD had higher concentrations of some elements in the total fraction, compared 

to the non-contaminated area (Table 2), the concentrations in the available fraction of the same 

elements in both areas were small (Table 3) corresponding to less than 5.8 % of the total. However in 

three soil samples from SD mine, Cd availability reached values corresponding to 16–29 % of the total 

concentration. For some nutrients (Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni and Zn), their availability was also small 

independently of the area, varying between 0.02 and 11 % of the total concentration, depending on 

the element. However, in SD, the soils developed on mixtures with considerable amounts of host 

rocks presented ?20 % of the total Mn concentration in the available fraction. In general, Ca 

availability varied between 6 and 23 % of the total concentration in soils from all the studied areas 

(excepted one soil sample from SD that reached 49 %). The elements concentrations in the available 

fraction of the rhizosphere soils from mining areas depend on the extraction solution (Anjos et al., 

2012; Santos et al., 2012). Additionally, the specific properties of the species can also determine 

significantly the availability of the elements for plants (Kabata-Pendias, 2004, 2011). Small 

concentrations of several studied elements (e.g. As, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb and Zn) in the 

available fraction were also observed in the rhizosphere soils of other species (e.g. Cistus and Erica 

genus) growing in SD mine (Abreu et al., 2008, 2012a,b; Santos et al., 2012, 2014; Perez-Lopez et al., 

2014; Durães et al., 2015). Even in the mine wastes from which some of the studied soils were 

developed, the available fractions of elements are usually small (Pérez-López et al., 2008). 

In general, the chemical properties of soils from SD, like pH and total concentrations of organic C 

and other studied elements, did not explain the small elements concentrations in the available fraction. 

Only for Zn, a positive correlation (r = 0.95) between total and the available fraction concentrations 

was found. In fact, the low availability of As, Cu, Pb, Mn and Zn in soils from SD is mainly related to: 

the association of these elements mostly to the residual fraction (in the crystalline structure of silicates 

or other solid phases as salts with low solubility) and Fe?oxides fraction, (Abreu et al., 2012a; Santos 

et al., 2012; Durães et al., 2015).

Even in the mine wastes from which some of the studied soils were developed, several elements 

(e.g. Cd, Cr, Fe, Sb, among others) are mainly associated to the residual fraction (Pérez-López et al., 

2008). However, in soils from CP, the organic C concentrations can lead to the decrease of the 

availability of several cations as Cd, Fe, Mn, Ni and V (?0.96 &amp;lt;r &amp;lt;?1.00, depending on the element). 

The increase of the total concentrations of Al, As, Ca, Fe, Ni, Pb and Sb led to the high concentrations 

of the same elements in the soils available fraction (0.91 &amp;lt;r &amp;lt;1.00, depending on element). 

Although soil characteristics as low fertility and pH, as well as the multielemental contamination can 

be considered strong limiting factors for plant growth, L. pedunculata is able to survive in soils with 

quite different properties, including different levels of contamination, showing a reasonable vegetative 

development. 

 

Chemical composition of Lavandula pedunculata 

 

Concentrations of the potentially hazardous elements (Table 4) and nutrients (Table 5) in plant 

roots from SD presented great variability being always higher than the available concentrations of the 

same elements in the respective soils. No correlation was obtained between elements concentrations 

in the roots and the soil available fraction, except for Al and Cu. For these cations, the increasing of 

their available concentrations contributed to the highest concentrations of the same elements in the 

roots (rAl = 0.98; rCu = 0.96). 

In SD, an intrapopulation variation in the translocation of some elements from roots to shoots was 

observed. The majority of the nutrients (Ca, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni and Zn) were mainly translocated from 

roots to shoots due to their important metabolic functions (TranslC: 1.0–6.3, depending on the 

element), as was also observed for other species growing in the same mine area (Freitas et al., 2009; 

Abreu et al., 2012a,b; Pérez-López et al., 2014; Santos et al., 2014; Durães et al., 2015). Arsenic, Cr, 

Sb and V were also translocated from roots to shoots (TranslC: 1.0?5.0, depending on the element), 

but the concentrations of these potentially hazardous elements (except As) in the shoots (Table 4) 

were considered normal/sufficient or below the phytotoxic level (Kabata-Pendias, 2011). 

The other studied potentially hazardous elements (Al, Cd and Pb) were mainly stored in the roots 

(TranslC &amp;lt;1.0). The storage of the potentially hazardous elements in the roots and their decrease in 

the aerial parts of the plants is considered an efficient tolerance mechanism under metal/metalloid 

stress (Kabata-Pendias, 2011), which has also been reported for several species growing in the same 

mine area (Freitas et al., 2009; Abreu et al., 2012a,b; Santos et al., 2012, 2014; Pérez-López et al., 

2014; Durães et al., 2015).  

Low translocation of Cu (TranslC &amp;lt;1) was also observed, but the concentrations of this element in 

the shoots were considered normal and sufficient according to the values referred for plants in general 

(Kabata-Pendias, 2011). Copper retention in L. pedunculata roots growing in soils with high total 

concentrations of this element, as is the case of soils from SD mine area, can be a tolerance 

mechanism that guarantees adequate levels of Cu in the photosynthetic parts of this species. In fact, 

the first tolerance mechanism in the plants seems to be the avoidance of accumulation of toxic 

concentrations of the elements in sensitive plant parts, preventing their damage effects, rather than 



Mutielemental concentration and physiological responses of Lavandula pedunculata growing in soils developed on different

triggering other cellular mechanism of tolerance/detoxification (Yruela, 2005). In SD mine, the Cu 

storage in plant roots is also reported for E. australis and E. andevalensis (Pérez-López et al., 2014) 

as well as in some plants of Cistus species (Abreu et al., 2012a,b; Santos et al., 2012, 2014).

Interpopulation variation was observed for the concentrations of As, Cd, Sb, Pb and Zn in the 

shoots (Table 4). Thus, concentrations of these elements in this organ from SD plants were higher 

than those collected in the non-contaminated area. For the other studied elements (Tables 4 and 5), 

no significant differences were obtained in spite of some plant samples collected in SD area had 

reached high elements concentrations (e.g. Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo).

Considering the two populations as a cluster, the elements concentrations in the shoots were not 

correlated to the concentrations of the same elements in the soils (total and available fractions). 

However, considering the independent populations adapted to their specific environments, the 

concentrations of Al, Ca and V in the plant shoots from CP were correlated to the concentrations of 

the same elements in the available fraction of the soils (r = 0.90?0.98, depending on the element). The 

same was not observed for the population from SD for any of the studied elements. In fact, the 

different concentrations of the elements in the shoots are the combined result of uptake, accumulation 

in roots, translocation from roots to shoots and tolerance capacity (Kabata-Pendias, 2011). 

Nonetheless, independently of the population, all plants showed higher concentrations of some 

elements in shoots than in the soil available fraction. 

For most of the plants from both areas, shoots had concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, Sb and 

V as well as Fe and Pb (except in two samples from SD, which exceeded phytotoxic levels) below the 

range considered toxic and/or within the normal/sufficient range for plants (Kabata-Pendias, 2011). 

Plant shoots from CP also had concentrations of Mn and Zn considered normal/sufficient and lower 

than phytotoxic (Kabata-Pendias, 2011). 

The concentrations of As, Mn (except in two samples) and Zn in the plant shoots from SD 

exceeded the phytotoxic values reported by Kabata-Pendias (2011) for most plant species, but visual 

signs of toxicity were not observed. Phytotoxic concentrations of Zn and Mn in the shoots seem to 

have a different effect in the concentrations of Cd (r = 0.94) and Pb (r = ?0.93), respectively, in the 

same organ. 

Plant parts (shoots, leaves or twigs) of different Lavandula species collected in SD mine or other 

mining areas under arid and semi-arid climate conditions showed a wide range of concentrations for 

some of the studied elements (Tables 4 and 5). In some cases, similar values compared to those 

obtained in the present study were reported by several authors (Freitas et al., 2004a,b; Boularbah et 

al., 2006; de la Fuente et al., 2010; Anawar et al., 2011, 2013). 

For the same species, L. pedunculata, different concentrations of several elements (As, Ca, Cr, 

Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) in shoots were reported for plants growing in Rio Tinto mining region (de la 

Fuente et al., 2010) and in a serpentine area from north–east of Portugal (old mining area of 

Pingarela), where the climatic conditions are different (Freitas et al., 2004b). However, according to 

the results reported by the same authors, some plant samples have some elements concentrations 

(As, Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb and Zn) in the same range than those obtained in this study. These 

differences can be explained by seasonal and temporal variations in plants and soils as well as the 

analysed plant part. Moreover, interpopulation variability can exist as reported for other species 

growing in mining areas (Abreu et al., 2012a; Santos et al., 2012, 2014). 

The calculated values of the soil–plant transfer coefficient indicated that the two populations are 

accumulators of Ca (TransfC &gt; 1) and non-accumulators of the other studied elements (TransfC &amp;lt;1). 

Intrapopulation variation in the accumulation behaviour of Cd, Mn and Zn was observed in SD being 

some plants accumulators of these elements (TransfC ? Cd: 0.1?15.1; Mn: 0.3?4.8; Zn: 0.2?4.3). 

Considering the calculated values of the soil to plant transfer coefficients, no general pattern of 

elements accumulation was linked to the essential nutritional requirements for plant species.

114 

 

Lavandula pedunculata from Rio Tinto mining region was also accumulator of Mn and Zn and non-

accumulator of As, Fe, Ni and Pb. However, an opposite accumulator behaviour, compared to the 

present study, was observed for Ca and Cu (de la Fuente et al., 2010). In plants of Lavandula genus 

growing in other contaminated areas (Boularbah et al., 2006; de la Fuente et al., 2010), the 

accumulator behaviour, indicated by the same coefficient, depended on species and elements being, 

in some cases, similar to that obtained in this study. 

 

Physiological characterization of Lavandula pedunculata 

 

Some species or ecotypes, like L. pedunculata growing in contaminated soils from SD mining area, 

did not show any visual symptoms of toxicity even with elements concentrations in their shoots 

considered as phytotoxic (As, Mn and Zn). However, at the physiological level, several phytotoxic 

effects and consequent responses can occur. 

In general, the excess of potentially toxic elements in shoots can modify the pigments 

concentrations, which are usually linked to visual symptoms of plant disease and photosynthetic 

activity (Pang et al., 2003; Stoeva and Bineva, 2003). Although no visual alteration in the shoots 

colour was observed in plants collected both in SD mining area and in non-contaminated area (CP), 

significant differences were obtained between chlorophylls concentrations (Fig. 1) in the plants from 

the two areas. However, the same was not observed for the carotenoids concentrations (Fig. 1). 

Concentrations of Chla in the shoots were similar for the two populations, while Chlb in the shoots 

from SD reached the highest values. This fact contributed to the significant differences of the total 

chlorophylls concentration in the plant shoots from both populations. Although plant shoots collected in 

CP had elements concentrations considered normal and/or below phytotoxicity, a negative effect of Al, 

Fe, Ni and V on total chlorophylls was observed (?0.93 &amp;lt;r &amp;lt;?0.99, depending on the element), 

possibly due to the low tolerance of this population to those chemical elements. Moreover, Al 

concentrations in plant shoots from CP also seem to negatively affect the Chlb concentration (r = 

?1.00). The decrease of the chlorophyll content in the shoots from plants collected in the non-

contaminated area can be related to the inhibition of the synthesis of photosynthetic pigments and/or 

enzymes responsible for chlorophyll biosynthesis as well as chlorophyll degradation by the increase of 

chlorophyllase activity (Sharma and Dubey, 2005). 

The chlorophyll ratio, used as a stress indicator (Zengin and Munzuroglu, 2005), was high in the 

plant shoots from CP (SD: 1.2?1.7; CP: 1.7?1.9) suggesting the existence of plant stress. In fact, the 

increase of the chlorophyll ratio due to oxidative stress has been reported in Phaseolus vulgaris L. 

with the application of increasing doses of Cd, Cu and Pb in controlled conditions (Zengin and 

Munzuroglu, 2005).  

Protein contents in plants are also affected by the high concentrations of potentially toxic elements 

in plants, as a result of the reduction of its biosynthesis or the acceleration of its degradation (Stoeva 

and Bineva, 2003). However, in the present study, similar concentrations of total protein were obtained 

in the two L. pedunculata populations (Table 6).

Under oxidative stress, plants can increase the activities of non-enzymatic components as 

response to the scavenging of ROS (Pang et al., 2003; Cao et al., 2004). Concerning the non-

enzymatic components (Table 6), no significant differences were obtained between concentrations of 

proline and acid-soluble thiols in the shoots collected in both areas. Similar proline contents were also 

obtained in Cardaminopsis arenosa (L.) Hayek leaves growing in some metalliferous and non-

contaminated areas, both from southern of Poland (Nadgórska-Socha et al., 2013). However, 

according to the same authors, Plantago lanceolata L. leaves from the same contaminated area had 

lower proline concentrations than those from the non-contaminated area. Kandziora-Ciupa et al. 

(2013) also reported no significant effect of heavy metals in the accumulation of proline in Vaccinium

growing in tailings with different proportions of Pb/Zn (Pang et al., 2003).

Differences of thiols concentrations in several plant species collected in contaminated and non-

contaminated areas were reported by Kandziora-Ciupa et al. (2013) and Nadgórska-Socha et al. 

(2013), which are not in agreement with the findings in the present study (Table 6). Comparing both 

contaminated and non-contaminated areas, it was noticed by Kandziora-Ciupa et al. (2013) an 

increase of the thiols concentrations in the leaves of V. myrtillus growing in the contaminated area. 

Under oxidative stress, plants can also produce or stimulate the activity of antioxidative enzymes 

that remove and neutralize ROS (Pang et al., 2003; Mishra et al., 2006). In the shoot samples of L. 

pedunculata, the activities of SOD and CAT followed different patterns (Table 6). Independently of the 

plant population, no variation was observed in the total and specific SOD activities in the shoots. A 

similar result was reported by Santos et al. (2009) for mature leaves of C. ladanifer also collected in 

SD mine and Pomarão (non-contaminated area near the mine area) and same sampling period 

(Spring). Superoxide dismutase activities in C. arenosa, P. lanceolata and Viola tricolor L. depend on 

population, however in some cases similar enzymatic activities were also obtained for plants collected 

in contaminated and non-contaminated sites (S?omka et al., 2008; Nadgórska-Socha et al., 2013).

The levels of the total activity of CAT enzyme varied with plant population (Table 6) attaining the 

lowest values in the shoots from SD plants. However, the specific CAT activity was similar owing to 

the high protein content in the plants from CP. This indicates that CAT synthesis did not follow total 

protein synthesis. The lower total activity of CAT in the shoots from SD was not correlated to the 

phytotoxic concentrations of As, Mn and Zn in the same organ, or even the concentrations of other 

studied elements. In natural conditions, non-specific stress responses of L. pedunculata from SD can 

be explained by the co-existence of different stress factors like high concentrations of several 

elements in the shoots, water deficiency and high intensity of UV radiation. 

The total activity of CAT in the shoots from CP was affected by Mn concentrations in the same 

organ (r = ?0.93). Although concentration of this metal in the shoots is considered sufficient and below 

phytotoxicity, the tolerance of this population can be different compared to SD population. In general, 

the activity of antioxidative enzymes only increases until tolerable elements contents and, when 

elements concentrations exceed this level a subsequent decrease of enzymes activity occurs (Cao et 

al., 2004). 

Low CAT activity was also observed in young leaves of C. ladanifer collected in SD mine, 

compared to leaves from a non-contaminated area (Santos et al., 2009). On the contrary, CAT activity 

in V. tricolor leaves from contaminated heaps was higher than in control (non-contaminated area) 

(S?omka et al., 2008). The increase of CAT activity was also observed in leaves of V. zizanioides 

growing in tailings with different proportions of Pb/Zn (Pang et al., 2003). 

The response of antioxidant mechanisms to phytotoxic concentrations of elements depends on the 

level of free radicals resulting from the balance between their production and scavenging. So, L. 

pedunculata growing in multielemental contaminated soils accumulate phytotoxic concentrations of 

As, Mn and Zn in shoots but these elements seem to be efficiently compartmentalized into cellular 

parts where it is not necessary to trigger an antioxidative response. Additionally, populations from SD 

mining area can have higher tolerance range to potentially hazardous elements. 

 

CONCLUSIONS 

 

In São Domingos mining area, the soils developed on different mine wastes showed a great 

heterogeneity of their chemical characteristics. Independently of the substrata, Lavandula pedunculata 

is able to grow in soils containing different levels of multielemental contamination, low fertility and a 

wide range of pH. Nonetheless, the plants did not show any visible symptoms of phytotoxicity and/or 

nutritional deficiency. 

Lavandula pedunculata showed inter- and intrapopulation variation in the concentrations of the 

studied elements in the shoots. Populations of São Domingos and Corte do Pinto (non-contaminated 

area) were accumulators of Ca and non-accumulators of the other studied elements. But some 

intrapopulation variation in the accumulation behaviour of Cd, Mn and Zn was observed in São 

Domingos plants. 

The tolerance of São Domingos population to potentially hazardous elements seem to be firstly 

related to elements storage in roots, preventing their translocation to the photosynthetic tissues, rather

than intracellular production of non-enzymatic compounds and activity of antioxidative enzymes. In 

fact, phytotoxic concentrations of As, Mn and Zn in the shoots from São Domingos plants did not 

affect the concentrations of pigments and total protein, and trigger antioxidative mechanisms by 

enzymatic and non-enzymatic components. The lowest tolerance of Corte do Pinto population, 

compared to São Domingos, can also be noticed by the reduction of the total chlorophylls and Chlb 

concentrations even in the presence of concentrations of some elements (e.g. Al, Fe, Ni and V) in the 

shoots below phytotoxic level. 

Overall, these results reveal that L. pedunculata has potential for phytostabilisation of soils with 

mutielemental contamination under Mediterranean conditions. However, to ensure a similar ecological 

behaviour of the plants and their tolerance to the co-existence of several stress factors, the use of 

seeds collected in the mining areas in phytostabilisation programs is recommended.

ABSTRACT 

 

The aims of this study were to: i) characterize the phytochemical profile of the different extracts (water 

and hexane) from shoots of Lavandula pedunculata and Cistus ladanifer growing in soils from São 

Domingos mining area and a control area in the same climatic conditions; ii) quantify some of the 

major components of these extracts; and iii) evaluate the influence of potentially hazardous elements 

accumulated in the aerial part of the plants on the quality of plant-based products (aqueous and 

hexane extracts). Composite samples of soils, developed on mine wastes and/or host rocks, as well 

as shoots of L. pedunculata and C. ladanifer were collected in São Domingos mine (SE of Portugal) 

and in a reference area with non-contaminated soils (Corte do Pinto)  

Total concentrations of potentially hazardous elements (Al, As, Cr, Cu, Mn, Sb and Zn) in soils, shoots 

and L. pedunculata infusions were determined. The extracts from C. ladanifer and L. pedunculata 

shoots were obtained by an accelerated solvent extractor, and the compounds were analysed by GC-

MS. Extracts of both species were extracted with hexane (single extraction), while L. pedunculata was 

also subjected to a sequential extraction with water and hexane. Major components in all extracts 

were quantified.  

Soils from São Domingos can be considered contaminated with As, Cu, Pb and Sb. In general, 

concentrations of the studied elements in shoots of both species (excepted Cr and Mn in L. 

pedunculata and Cr in C. ladanifer) collected in São Domingos mining area were higher than in plant 

shoots from non-contaminated area. Only concentrations of Zn in the infusions done with São 

Domingos plants were significantly different. However, in general, concentrations of potentially 

hazardous elements in infusions were small. The major component in the C. ladanifer extracts was 

viridiflorol, while in L. pedunculata extracts was camphor, independently of the sample. Extraction 

method (single and sequential) and solvent did not affect the major components identified in the L. 

pedunculata extracts. However, for other compounds an influence of the solvent used in their 

extraction was observed. In both species, slight variability intra and interpopulation was observed in 

the qualitative composition and concentrations of major components, but no relationship was found 

between these components and the concentrations of the studied potentially hazardous elements in 

shoots. Extracts obtained from C. ladanifer and L. pedunculata growing in São Domingos mining area 

had valuable compounds. 

High concentrations of potentially hazardous elements in soils did not affect the quality of the plant-

based products. Phytostabilisation of mining areas with these species can provide economic return by 

the exploration of these products.

INTRODUCTION 

 

In the Portuguese Iberian Pyrite Belt, several mining areas are abandoned and show significant 

environmental impacts related to great volumes of different tailings; high total concentrations of 

potentially hazardous elements in mine wastes, soils, sediments and waters (Álvarez-Valero et al., 

2008; Matos and Martins, 2006; Pérez-López et al., 2008). Generally, these mine wastes and the 

adjacent soils, as well as soils developed on mine wastes have unfavourable characteristics to plant 

development, namely low fertility and high total concentrations of potentially hazardous elements, 

small water holding capacity and weak structure (Abreu and Magalhães, 2009; Wong, 2003). 

However, some autochthones plant species with refereed aromatic and medicinal properties (e.g. 

Rosmarinus officinalis and some species of the genus Cistus, Lavandula and Erica) are able to 

naturally colonize these substrata improving their physical, chemical and biological characteristics 

and, consequently, contributing to the natural rehabilitation of the mining area (Abreu and Magalhães, 

2009; Abreu et al., 2008, 2012a,b; Pérez-López et al., 2014; Santos et al., 2014). These species also 

grow in non-contaminated areas, being the populations from the mining areas considered specific 

tolerant ecotypes, which developed effective tolerance mechanisms (Abreu et al. 2012a; Santos et al., 

2009, 2012). 

Continuous degradation of land resources by mining activities can reduce the agricultural areas, 

while the rehabilitation of mining areas is essential and a priority because those are sources of 

contamination and environmental and health risk. The rehabilitation of abandoned mines by 

phytostabilisation involves several ecological improvements (Abreu and Magalhães, 2009; Mendez 

and Maier, 2008) but, nowadays, the economical approaches are also essential. Thus, the 

rehabilitation of non-productive and contaminated soils/mine wastes can be a niche for 

agriculture/forestry exploration, by implementation of phytostabilisation, in order to produce plant-

based products. In fact, the growth of aromatic and medicinal crops (e.g. Anethum graveolens L., 

Mentha x piperita L., Ocimum basilicum L. and Lavandula angustifolia Mill.) on agricultural soils 

enriched with Cd, Cu and Pb is considered an economic and environmental feasible option 

(Zheljazkov and Nielsen, 1996; Zheljazkov et al., 2006, 2008). According to the same authors, the 

essential oil yield can be reduced with the plant growth on contaminated soils and consequently 

increase of potentially hazardous elements in shoots but, in the process of the oil extraction, these 

elements remain in the extracted plant residues limiting their quantities in the commercial oil product. 

Several plants extracts are used for perfumery, pharmaceutical and cosmetics as well as food 

addictive (Raut and Karuppayil, 2014). Cistus ladanifer L. is reported by its medicinal (e.g. antioxidant, 

antifungal, antibacterial, antidiarrheic and anti-inflammatory) (Andrade et al., 2009; Attaguile et al., 

2000; Barros et al., 2013; Greche et al., 2009; Zidane et al., 2013) and odoriferous importance for 

fragrance industry (Gomes et al., 2005; Teixeira et al., 2007). The essential oil of this species also 

showed herbicidal activity in vitro bioassays presenting great potential as natural herbicide for crop 

protection (Verdeguer et al., 2011). Nevertheless, C. ladanifer is a very poorly exploited species in 

Portugal although in France and Spain markets have great importance. The use of Lavandula species 

as aromatic, for food and fragrance industries, and medicinal (e.g. anti-inflammatory, antibacterial,

digestive and calming) plant, especially in the form of infusions, is reported (Cavanagh and Wilkinson, 

2002; Figueiredo et al., 2014). Oils of these species are also indicated as a potential natural 

biopesticide (González-Coloma et al., 2011). In particular, Lavandula pedunculata (Mill.) Cav. Present 

antifungal and antioxidant activity being, additionally, a potential source of active metabolites with a 

positive effect on human health (Costa et al., 2013; Matos et al., 2009; Zuzarte et al., 2009). 

Several studies have been developed on some mining areas from the Iberian Pyrite Belt aiming to 

evaluate the elements accumulation in tolerant plants and their implications for phytostabilisation 

(Abreu et al., 2008; Anawar et al., 2011; de la Fuente et al., 2010; Freitas et al., 2004; Santos et al., 

2012). Nevertheless, little information is available concerning the quality of plants as source of 

important phytochemicals and/or the public safety risk of these products derived from plants growing 

in contaminated areas (Zheljazkov et al., 2006, 2008). 

In order to characterize and valorise some autochthones species, which are used in rehabilitation 

processes of mining areas, as new sources of bioactive substances, the aims of this study were to: i) 

characterize the phytochemical profile of the different extracts (aqueous and hexane extraction) from 

shoots of Lavandula pedunculata and Cistus ladanifer growing in soils from São Domingos mining 

area and a control area in the same climatic conditions; ii) quantify some of the major components of 

these extracts; and iii) evaluate the influence of potentially hazardous elements accumulated in the 

aerial part of the plants on the quality of the plant-based products (infusions and extracts). 

 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Site characterization 

 

Two areas, under Mediterranean conditions (Alentejo region, SE of Portugal), were selected to this 

study: a mining area with multielementar contamination ? São Domingos (SD), and a reference area 

with non-contaminated soils ? Corte do Pinto (CP). In both areas, Lavandula pedunculata (Mill.) Cav. 

(sin. Lavandula pedunculata subsp. Sampaioana (Rozeira) Franco, Lavandula stoechas subsp. 

lusitanica (Chaytor) Rozeira, Lavandula stoechas subsp. pedunculata (Mill.) Rozeira and Lavandula 

sampaioana (Rozeira) Rivas Mart., T.E. Díaz &amp;amp; Fern. Gonz.) and Cistus ladanifer L. are representative 

species of the vegetation community in both areas. According to Thornthwaite classification, the 

climate in these areas is semiarid, mesothermic. 

São Domingos is an old copper mine located in the Iberian Pyrite Belt, which is abandoned since 

1960. The mining activities occurred since pre-roman period and in the modern times from the middle 

of the XIX century till the 60’s of the XX century (Quental et al., 2002). As a result of the different 

periods and techniques of exploitation, large amounts of wastes from ore processing or extracting 

were produced and spread, irregularly, along the mine area (Álvarez-Valero et al., 2008; Pérez-López 

et al., 2008, Quental et al., 2003). On some of these materials were developed Incipient soils (Spolic 

Technosol Toxic ? IUSS Working Group WRB, 2007), which present high total concentrations of 

several potentially hazardous elements (Abreu et al., 2008, 2012a,b; Freitas et al., 2004; Pérez-López 

et al., 2014; Santos et al., 2012, 2014, Tavares et al., 2008). In the mining area, there are also some 

soils developed on schists and greywackes (Leptosols Lithic; IUSS Working Group WRB, 2007),

which are influenced by adjacent tailings and/or acid mine drainage. Corte do Pinto area is located 

about 4 km to the north of São Domingos mine whose soils are also classified as Leptosols Lithic 

(IUSS Working Group WRB, 2007) but without any contamination. 

 

Soils and plants analysis 

 

Several sampling areas were selected in the two study areas in order to include representative 

soils where L. pedunculata (three in SD mining area and three in CP) or C. ladanifer (three in SD 

mining area and three in CP) were growing. In each sampling area (?10 m
2
 each), composite samples 

of shoots of L. pedunculata and C. ladanifer were collected during the flowering period (April 2012) as 

well as soils surrounding the rhizosphere system of all harvested plants (?3 kg of homogenate; &amp;lt;20 

cm of depth). Soil samples were air-dried, homogenised, and sieved. Classical characterization of 

soils (fraction &amp;lt;2 mm) was carried out (Póvoas and Barral, 1992): pH and electrical conductivity in 

water suspension (1:2.5 m/V); organic carbon (Tinsley method); extractable P and K (Egner-Riehm 

method) and total nitrogen (Kjeldahl method). The total concentrations of Al, As, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb, Sb 

and Zn in soils (fraction &amp;lt;2 mm) were determined by ICP and INAA, after acid digestion (perchloric 

acid + nitric acid + hydrochloric acid + hydrofluoric acid; Actlabs ISO/IEC 17025; Activation 

Laboratories, 2015a).  

Plant samples were washed, dried (40 °C), homogenised and stored in the dark at room 

temperature until analysis. For multielementar determination, shoots were finely ground and analysed 

by ICP-MS after ashing (475 °C) and nitric acid digestion (Activation Laboratories, 2015b). 

For obtaining the extracts, the dried plant material (SD1?SD5 and CP1) was ground in a wood 

chipper/leaf shredder. The extracts were obtained with an accelerated solvent extractor (ASE, 

Dionex). For this, 3 g of L. pedunculata shoots or 4 g of C. ladanifer shoots were placed in 11 mL-

stainless steel cells. Plant samples were treated with hexane (single extraction of both plant species) 

or with water and then with hexane (sequential extraction of L. pedunculata), at 100 ºC, 2000 psi, for 

30 min, and one extraction cycle. Compounds from water extracts were ultrasonically extracted with 

hexane (1:1 V/V) for one hour. Extracts were stored in a glass flask at ?18 ºC until their analysis. The 

solvents (water and hexane) were selected due to the sustainability of the process and extraction 

efficiency. Sequential extraction was done in order to evaluate the recover efficiency of the valuable 

compounds with both extractant solutions.  

Extracts were analysed by gas chromatography (Model 450 GC, Agilent Technologies) coupled to 

mass spectrometry (Model 220 MS, Agilent Technologies). Before analysis, a mix of deuterated 

internal standards, containing 1,4-dichlorobenzene-d4, acenaphthene-d10, chrysene-d12, 

naphthalene-d8, perylene-d12 and phenanthrene-d10 (Internal Standards Mix 33, Dr. Ehrenstorfer), 

were added to the extracts at 0.5 mg/L as a constant concentration. Chromatographic separations 

were performed by a FactorFour VF-5ms EZ-Guard capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 µm; 

Agilent Technologies) operated with the following oven temperature program: 40 ºC (held for 10 min) 

to 180 ºC (held for 10 min), at 3 ºC/min. Helium was used as carrier gas, at a constant flow of 1 

mL/min. The injector was operated at 250 ºC in split/splitless mode. The mass spectrometer operated

area

in full scan mode. Ionization of the molecules was carried out by electron impact and the ion trap 

temperature was fixed at 220 ºC. 

The composition of the extracts was expressed in percentage values calculated by the 

normalization method from the GC peak areas, without using correction factors, and as mean values 

of two injections from each extract. The component identification was made by comparison of mass 

spectra using NIST98 spectral library, their retention indices, pure reference compounds and literature 

data. The linear retention indices were determined relative to the retention times obtained for a 

standard mixture containing a series of n-alkanes C9?C18.  

For the quantitative analysis of the major components in the extracts, a calibration curve was 

obtained by injection of a standard containing a mixture of fenchone, verbenone, camphene, camphor 

and ?-pinene. The calibration standards were prepared in hexane, at several concentrations: 0.1, 1, 5, 

10, 25, 50, 75, 100 and 150 mg/L. Internal standards were also added in the same concentration as 

for the plant samples (0.5 mg/L). The results were expressed in mg of each compound per kg of dried 

shoots. 

Plant infusions were prepared with 5 g of L. pedunculata shoots (SD1?SD3 and CP1?CP3; particle 

size &amp;lt;4 mm) and 100 ml of boiling water during 5 min of contact. Same elements than in soils were 

determined by Flame-AAS (Al, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn) and GF-AAS (As and Sb). 

 

Data analysis 

 

Data were analysed with the statistical programme SPSS v18.0 for Windows namely: concentration 

of the major compounds in the plant extracts by one way ANOVA and the Duncan test (p &amp;lt;0.05) and 

concentrations of the potentially hazardous elements in L. pedunculata infusions by non-parametrically 

using Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA by Ranks test. Bivariate Pearson correlations were used to correlate 

concentrations of the elements in the plant shoots and the major compounds quantified (r &gt; 0.95). 

Quality control of the analyses was made by analytical replicate samples, use of certified standards 

and blanks. 

 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Characteristics of the soils and plants 

 

Soils from São Domingos were developed on several mine wastes without or with different 

proportions of host rocks. This fact contributed to a great heterogeneity in their chemical 

characteristics (Table 1 and Fig. 1). The pH and concentrations of organic C and NPK the soils from 

the mine area were lower than those of Corte do Pinto (Table 1). Although some soils from São 

Domingos are developed on schist and sediments, their intense influence by acid mine drainage 

contribute to acid pH values. Moreover, the mixture of considerable proportion of host rocks with 

gossan led to the neutral pH of soil sample SD1. Low electrical conductivities and poor fertility were 

obtained in soils from both areas (Table 1).

The total concentrations of As, Cu, Pb, Sb and Zn were higher in soils from São Domingos than 

from Corte do Pinto (Fig. 1), while the opposite was obtained for Al, Cr and Mn. Despite of the 

variability, the total concentrations of the potentially hazardous elements in the soils from São 

Domingos are in the same range than those reported for mine wastes and/or soils developed on mine 

wastes from the same mine area (Abreu et al., 2012a,b; Álvarez-Valero et al., 2008; Anawar et al., 

2011, 2013; Durães et al., 2015; Freitas et al., 2004, 2009; Pérez-López et al., 2008; Santos et al., 

2012, 2014; Tavares et al., 2008). 

Soils from São Domingos can be considered contaminated with As, Cu, Pb and Sb for agriculture 

and residential/parkland uses (maximum allowed values (MAV): 12 mg As/kg, 63 mg Cu/kg, 70?140 

mg Pb/kg and 20 mg Sb/kg, depending on land use; CCME, 2007) while only one sample exceeded 

the MAV for Zn (200 mg/kg; CCME, 2007).Total concentrations of As in soils from Corte do Pinto were 

above the MAV, however those are not considered as contaminated. In fact, these amounts are 

associated with the natural composition of the parent materials (schists and greywackes) from which 

soils were developed (Abreu et al., 2008; Tavares et al., 2008). 

Interpopulation variation was observed for the concentrations of the potentially hazardous elements 

in the shoots of C. ladanifer and L. pedunculata (Fig. 1), as well as in the populations of both species 

from São Domingos (intrapopulation variability). This heterogeneity was already reported to C. 

ladanifer (Santos et al., 2012, 2014 and references therein). Concentrations of the studied elements 

(excepted Cr and Mn in L. pedunculata and Cr in C. ladanifer) in the shoots of both species collected 

in São Domingos mine were higher than in those from non-contaminated area. In general, the same 

plant parts of the two species collected in São Domingos or other mining areas under arid and 

semiarid conditions presented a wide range of concentrations for some of the studied elements 

(Santos et al., 2014 and references therein; de la Fuente et al., 2010) being, in some cases, similar 

compared to those obtained in the present study. Nevertheless, these differences can be explained by 

seasonal and temporal variations in plants and the analysed plant part. 

 

Infusions and extracts of Lavandula pedunculata: Component identification and quantification 

 

Independently of the contamination soil level and the concentrations of the potentially hazardous 

elements in shoots, the concentrations of Al, As, Cr, Pb and Sb in the infusions were below the 

detection limit of the equipment measurement (mg/L ? &amp;lt;0.5, 5.0 x 10
-4

, 0.05, 0.25 and 0.03, 

respectively). No significant differences were obtained between the concentrations of Cu (mg/L ? SD: 

0.06?0.13, CP: 0.07?0.10 depending on sample) and Mn (mg/L –SD: 0.52?4.54, CP: 2.17?3.14 

depending on sample) in infusions done with plants from the two studied areas. Nonetheless, Zn 

concentrations were higher in the infusions done with São Domingos plants (0.57?1.45 mg/L) than in 

those made with plants collected in the non-contaminated area (0.21?0.25 mg/L).The concentrations 

of the studied elements were in the same range than those reported by Görür et al. (2011) for black 

and green teas, as well as for several herbal infusions (Alt?nt?g et al., 2014) consumed in Turkey. In 

this way, the consumption of infusions done with L. pedunculata from studied areas did not have 

health risk.

area 

 
134 

 

In the L. pedunculata extracts, obtained in the single extraction with hexane, were identified 34 

compounds accounting between 79 and 89 % of the total identified compounds (Table 2). Camphor 

was the major component in all extracts (Table 2). Fenchone, eucalyptol, verbenone, bornyl acetate, 

borneol and linalool oxide cis also showed considerable amounts in all extracts. These compounds 

present economic interest. In fact, camphor has been used as an antibacterial and antifungal 

substance and improving sleep quality being also a natural flavouring agent and an ingredient for food 

processing (Chu and Kemper, 2001). According to the same authors, fenchone also shows a 

significant antifungal activity and Cavanagh and Wilkinson (2002) indicated that camphor plants are 

used as insect repellents. Although considerable amounts of eucaliptol had been identified in 

Lavandula samples, at economic level cannot be significant its extraction because the essential oil 

obtained from Eucaliptus globulus Labill. biomass residues (S of Portugal) had around 46 % of 

eucalyptol (Gonçalves et al., 2013), being more profitable. Elaissi et al. (2012) also reported significant 

amounts of eucalyptol (between 4.5 and 70 %) in oils extracted from different eucalyptus species from 

Tunisia. Verbenone, bornyl acetate, borneol and linalool-family are compounds suggested for 

perfumery and household fragrances. Verbenone, bornyl acetate and borneol also present medicinal 

(e.g. antimicrobial and antispasmodic) and insect repellent properties (Phytochemical and 

ethnobotanical databases, 2015). 

Although with amounts lesser than 1 % (Table 2), other valuable compounds were identified with 

great interest for medicine (e.g. eugenol: antibacterial, spasmolytic and anesthetic effect; coumarim 

and caryophyllene oxyde: anti-inflammatory; ?- and ?-pinene: antifungal) as well as for fragrance of 

cosmetics or household cleaners (e.g. linalyl acetate). Therefore, they should be highlighted. 

Some variation was obtained in the qualitative composition of the L. pedunculata extracts obtained 

by single extraction but, in general, it was not clear the differentiation between populations (Table 2) 

and, consequently, soil contamination level and concentrations of the potentially hazardous elements 

in shoots (Fig. 1). Concerning the concentrations of the some major components (Table 3), some 

significant differences were obtained among plant samples (except for verbenone) but no correlation 

was obtained with the potentially hazardous elements in shoots. Thus, sample SD2 had the highest 

concentration of fenchone while sample from non-contaminated area (CP1) presented the highest 

concentration of camphor. Samples from SD3 and CP1 presented much more camphene. The use of 

composite samples of shoots affects the composition and, especially, the concentration of the 

compounds in the extracts (Masetto et al., 2015; Raut and Karuppayil, 2014) justifying these 

variations. 

In the aqueous extract (first step of the sequential extraction) were identified 27 compounds, 

independently of the plant samples, while in the following step (with hexane) were identified 26 

compounds (Table 4). The total fraction of the identified compounds varied between 52 and 85 % 

depending on the sample and extraction step/solvent. 

As for single extraction, major component in both extracts was camphor (Table 4). Fenchone and 

verbenone also had considerable amounts, especially in the aqueous extract, as well as borneol. It 

should be noted that, in general, ?- and ?-pinene, bornyl acetate viridiflorol, hinesol and 

longiverbenone also had considerable amounts but only in the hexane extract. As was stated by

Composition and aromatic profile of extracts from Cistus ladanifer and Lavandula pedunculata growing in São Domingos mining 
area 

139 

 

Zuzarte et al. (2009) to the essential oils of L. pedunculata, the aqueous extract from all the studied 

samples (SD and CP) can have a significant antifungal activity due to a synergistic effect among the 

different compounds with this proprietary (e.g. fenchone and camphor). Despite of the homogeneity of 

the compounds in the main fraction in the Lavandula extracts, some components depended on the 

sample. Other compounds were also detected but only in some samples (e.g. Aqueous extract ? 

caryophyllene oxide and viridiflorol in plant samples from the mine area; Hexane extract ? exo-

Fenchol and 6-Camphenol in samples SD1 and SD2).  

Due to the difficult systematic position of L. pedunculata, the comparison of the data can be quite 

complex but most of the components identified in this study were also reported by several authors for 

the same species (Costa et al., 2013; Figueiredo et al., 2014; Matos et al., 2015; Zuzarte et al., 2009) 

and for others Lavandula species (Lavandula angustifolia Mill., Danh et al., 2012; Lavadula luisieri 

(Rozeira) Rivas Mart., González-Coloma et al., 2011) independently of the extraction method. In 

general, oils derived from L. stoechas (which can be included as subsp. synonymous of L. 

pedunculata) have high camphor levels what is in agreement with the data obtained in this study. For 

instance, the composition of the oils obtained from L. stoechas subsp. lusitanica and L. pedunculata 

subsp. lusitanica (sin. L. pedunculata) from S of Portugal was also dominated by fenchone and 

camphor but their amounts were much higher than the obtained in the present study (38.9 and 40.6 %, 

41.9 and 34.6 %; respectively; Costa et al., 2013; Matos et al., 2015). The oils from the same species 

cultivated near Lisbon were also characterized by high fenchone content (21?59 %). However, all 

samples from São Domingos mine and Corte do Pinto had more borneol, cis-linalool oxide and 

especially, verbenone than samples analysed by Matos et al. (2015) (&amp;lt;0.5 %). In the oils obtained 

from L. pedunculata collected in the  North and Central Portugal, the amounts of the main compounds 

and even the major components were different from those determined in the plant samples from SD 

and CP (fenchone and 1,8-cineole or 1,8-cineole+camphor, depending on population; Zuzarte et al., 

2009). Thus, amounts of each component vary widely with the population, even in non-contaminated 

conditions. Differences in the composition of L. luisieri oils extracted from plant material in different 

moist conditions (dry or fresh) and plant part (flowers and leaves) are reported, even if the same 

extraction method was used (Gomes et al., 2005; González-Coloma et al., 2011). 

Significant differences were obtained among the concentrations of major compounds in L. 

pedunculata extracted in the two steps (except verbenone in 2
nd

 step of the extraction; Table 3). 

However, as for single extraction, no clear tendency was obtained according to the soil contamination. 

Type and amount of the compounds also varied with extraction solution being some compounds 

only identified in specific extract (e.g. Aqueous extract: coumarin, eucarvone and pinocarvone; 

Hexane extracts: ?-pinene, aromadendrene, hinesol and tau-cadinol). In fact, solvents of different 

polarities extract different groups of compounds (Cowan, 1999). Besides, the extraction of some 

compounds, namely phenolic, in L. pedunculata subsp. lusitanica is influenced by the nature and 

polarity of the solvent system (Costa et al., 2013). Independently of the plant samples (except SD2 for 

camphene), the highest concentrations of the major compounds were obtained in the aqueous 

extracts, compared to the second step of the extraction with hexane (Table 3). The loss of volatile

compounds during the plant material drying after the first step of extraction can justify the decreasing 

of their concentrations. 

Comparing the two methodologies of extraction (sequential and single with hexane), the application 

of the sequential extraction did not seem to have significant advantage in the recovery of more 

valuable compounds from L. pedunculata. In fact, the concentrations of the major compounds in the 

extracts obtained in the single extraction were significantly higher or similar to the sum of both 

fractions. 

Taking into account the application of a single extraction, the use of water as the extracting solvent 

can be considered a sustainable choice compared to other alternative solvents (hexane). In fact, only 

the concentrations of camphene (highly volatile compounds) in hexane extract were significantly 

higher than those in aqueous extracts, independently of the sample. For the other quantified 

compounds, no clear differentiation was observed. In this way, aqueous extracts of L. pedunculata 

could be directly used as for toilet water. 

 

Extracts of Cistus ladanifer: Component identification and quantification 

 

In the extracts of C. ladanifer were identified 32 compounds, which represent between 29 and 43 % 

of the total compounds (Table 5). The composition of C. ladanifer extracts (obtained with hexane) was 

complex presenting a great number of compounds of difficult identification due to their very small 

amounts (&amp;lt;0.1 %), as reported for oils of the same species (Mariotti et al., 1997; Gomes et al., 2005). 

Moreover, in these extracts (and especially as in aqueous extracts obtained from the same species, 

data not show) were found great number of undefined peaks. 

Independently of the population and sample, the major component in the extracts was viridiflorol 

(Table 5). This compound was identified in the oils of different samples of C. ladanifer collected in 

Portugal and Morocco (14?17% and 19.4 %, respectively) being responsible for floral notes as 

indicated by Gomes et al. (2005) and Greche et al. (2009). On the contrary, major components in oils 

of other plant samples from Morocco were camphene and borneol (15.5 and 11.1 %, respectively; 

Zidane et al., 2013), while in oils from the same species collected in Spain were trans-pinocarveol and 

viridiflorol (20 and 13.6 %, respectively; Verdeguer et al., 2011). Plants from Spain cultivated in the 

East coast of Corsica showed, especially, ?-pinene in their oils (16?47 %) but, in some samples, was 

also found, as major component, viridiflorol (20?23 %; Mariotti et al., 1997). 

Additionally, other compounds occurred, in small amounts (&amp;lt;2.5 %; Table 5), in the plant extracts 

from São Domingos and Corte do Pinto. These compounds have a great odoriferous interest (e.g. 

amber-like scent: ambrox and caryophyllene oxide; fresh-camphoraceous: bornyl acetate, borneol and 

myrtenol) (Gomes et al., 2005) and microbial effect (e.g. ?-pinene, ?-pinene, fenchone and camphor) 

(Chu and Kemper, 2001).  

Cistus ladanifer extracts from the two studied populations exhibited similar profiles and quite 

variation in the qualitative composition (Table 5). These results are in agreement with those reported 

for other extracts (obtained with different solvents and methodologies) and populations (Gomes et al., 

2005; Greche et al., 2009; Mariotti et al., 1997; Regino et al., 1987; Teixeira et al., 2007; Verdeguer et

al., 2011; Zidane et al., 2013 and references therein). Therefore, contamination in soils and potentially 

hazardous elements in C. ladanifer shoots (Fig. 1) did not affect the quality of the extracts.

Composition and aromatic profile of extracts from Cistus ladanifer and Lavandula pedunculata growing in São Domingos mining 
area

A wide variation in the composition of this species extracts can be explained by the analysed plant 

part and its conditions of collection, drying and storage as well as method of extraction (Raut and 

Karuppayil, 2014). In fact, Gomes et al. (2005) found that the use of dry material, instead of fresh 

material, can affect the amounts of the components with middle to high volatility in C. ladanifer oils, 

however the influence level seems to depend on the population (located N or S of Portugal). 

Composition and yield of C. ladanifer oil also vary along the year, storage time and with the different 

geographical sources of the plants, as well as the solvent used in the extraction (Regino et al., 1987). 

The influence of the solvent and/or the analysed part of the plant (flowers, fruit, stem or leaves) on the 

extracted content of flavonoids and phenolics from C. ladanifer shoots is reported (Andrade et al., 

2009; Zidane et al., 2013). Even using another methodology of extraction (simultaneous distillation–

extraction) with several solvents (pentane, cyclohexane, hexane and diethyl, ether and mixture of 

pentane/diethyl ether), a distinct efficiency of extraction was observed according on compound. 

However, in general, the average extraction efficiencies were quite similar (Teixeira et al., 2007). 

Concerning the concentrations of some major components (Table 6), some significant differences 

were obtained among samples. Sample SD3 had more camphor and fenchone while in SD4 was 

determined the highest camphene concentrations. For ?-pinene and verbenone, some samples from 

the mining area showed similar concentrations compared to the samples from non-contaminated area 

(CP1). However, no correlation was obtained between concentrations of the major components and 

the potentially hazardous elements in shoots. Thus, inter or intra-variability of the plants and their 

conditions of growth and/or ecological stress do not justified these variations. Possibly, the type of 

plant material used, i.e. composite samples of shoots, which may include different proportions of 

leaves, stems and flowers, can contribute to the variation of the compounds concentrations.

CONCLUSION 

 

Soils from São Domingos can be considered contaminated with As, Cu, Pb and Sb. The 

concentrations of the potentially hazardous elements in the shoots of C. ladanifer and L. pedunculata 

from São Domingos presented intrapopulation variability in their concentrations of the potentially 

hazardous elements. In general, concentrations of the studied elements in shoots of both species

(excepted Cr and Mn in L. pedunculata and Cr in C. ladanifer) collected in São Domingos mining area 

were higher than in the same species from the non-contaminated area. 

The infusions done with L. pedunculata shoots from São Domingos had only concentrations of Zn 

significantly different compared to the infusions of the plants from the non-contaminated area. 

Independently of the population concentrations of the potentially hazardous elements in L. 

pedunculata infusions were small so, this product can be considered for human consumption without 

any risk. Extracts obtained from C. ladanifer and L. pedunculata growing in São Domingos mining 

area had valuable compounds which might be used for a wide range of applications. Since the 

extracts are complex mixtures of different compounds, it is difficult to attribute their 

biological/odoriferous activity to a single or a particular constituent. However, extracts of both species 

presented great potential pharmaceutical and fragrance/perfumery industry. 

Qualitative composition of the extracts was almost constant over the range of concentrations of the 

elements in the soils (contaminated and non-contaminated). This study demonstrated that high 

concentrations of potentially hazardous elements in soils did not affect the quality of the extracts. In 

this way, phytostabilisation of mining areas using these species can provide economic return by the 

exploration of these products. However, it is essential to confirm the concentration of hazardous 

elements in the extracted plant residues. In order to improve the efficiency, the extraction should be 

adjusted by setting the operation conditions pressure and temperature.

MINE: ASSAY OF SIMULATED LEACHING 

 



 

 



Potential environmental impact of Technosols composed of gossan and sulfide-rich wastes from São Domingos mine: assay of 
simulated leaching 

149 

 

ABSTRACT 

 

This study aimed to evaluate: the effectiveness of two Technosols prepared with gossan or sulfide-rich 

wastes and organic/inorganic amendment mixtures, by the analysis of the over time variation of the 

elemental concentrations  in their simulated leachates; and the potential environmental risk of these 

Technosols evaluated from the mass of the leached potentially hazardous elements calculated taking 

into account the leachates elemental concentrations and the tailings mass in São Domingos mine 

area.  

Composite samples of two São Domingos mining wastes (gossan wastes ? GW; sulfide-rich wastes ? 

SW) were collected. Amendment mixtures, containing different organic/inorganic wastes (from green-

agriculture, distillation of Ceratonia siliqua L. and Arbutus unedo L. fruits and limestone quarry), were 

applied at 12, 30 and 60 g/kg to GW and SW. Two sets of microcosm pot assays were performed 

under controlled conditions in greenhouse, and monitored during seven and thirteen months for GW 

and SW, respectively. Materials from each pot/treatment (&amp;lt;5 cm of depth) were collected after one, 

four, seven and thirteen months of incubation, and used to obtain simulated leachates (DIN 

extraction). The leachates were analysed for pH, electrical conductivity, and the concentrations of 

anions and cations by F-AAS, GF-AAS, HPLC and UV-VIS. 

Simulated leachates from SW had lower pH and higher concentrations of potentially hazardous 

elements than leachates from GW. The concentrations of As in leachates from GW-Technosols were 

higher than those in leachates from GW-control but &amp;lt;0.6 mg/kg. In GW-Technosols leachates, the pH 

and the concentrations of some nutrients (e.g. Ca and phosphates) also increased when compared to 

control. In the SW-Technosols, the pH of the leachates increased only in the first month as long as 

limestone was present. In these leachates was observed a general trend of concentrations decrease 

for some elements (e.g. As, sulfate, Fe, Pb), especially in the first month. A clear influence of the dose 

and type of amendments was not observed during the experimental time span for both wastes. 

The concentrations of the elements like Al, Ca, Fe and Pb in the leachates are controlled by both the 

pH of the solutions and the concentrations of phosphates and sulfates. The extensive mass of the 

studied mine wastes contribute to the release to the neighbouring environment of considerable 

amounts of potentially hazardous elements. The rehabilitation of the mine wastes by the conception of 

Technosols, especially with sulfide-rich wastes, can reduce significantly the environmental impact.

INTRODUCTION 

 

In the Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB), one of the most important metallogenic provinces of massive 

sulfides in the world, several mining areas are abandoned generating great environmental problems 

associated to sulfide wastes (Abreu et al., 2010; Matos and Martins, 2006; Sánchez-España et al., 

2005). The oxidation of the sulfides produces extreme acid mine drainage (AMD) containing high 

concentrations of potentially hazardous elements (Abreu et al., 2010; Sánchez-España et al., 2005), 

which can be spread to the adjacent areas.  

São Domingos mine (SE of Portugal) is one of the abandoned mines located in the Portuguese IPB 

that present severe environmental impacts due to the high volume of spoils and tailings and the 

dimension of the areas affected by AMD (Álvarez-Valero et al., 2008; Matos and Martins, 2006). The 

exploitation and extraction processes in this mine (between pre-roman period and 1966) produced 

between 27 and 32 Tg of different mining wastes, which include around 17 % of sulfide-rich wastes 

(e.g. pyrite blocks, brittle pyrite, modern and Roman slags and smelting ashes) and 15 % of gossan 

wastes (Álvarez-Valero et al., 2008; Pérez-López et al., 2008). The sulfides-rich tailings, mainly 

composed of crushed pyrite and smelting ashes, show a very low pH and a large capacity to generate, 

continuously, AMD (Santos et al., 2014a). However, both mine wastes have high total concentrations 

of several elements contributing to a multielemental contamination through their leachates (Abreu et 

al., 2008, 2010; Álvarez-Valero et al., 2008; Pérez-López et al., 2008; Santos et al., 2014a, 2015).  

The ecological rehabilitation of the São Domingos mining area should be initiated by the 

improvement of the chemical characteristics of mine wastes, especially sulfide-rich wastes, in order to 

minimize the leaching and/or elements concentrations in the leachates. These waste materials are 

bared and subject to more or less intense water erosion. The tailings, mainly composed of gossan 

materials, are naturally colonized by vegetation and present low reactivity and capacity to generate 

AMD. However, this vegetation is sparse and their growth is quite slow. In order to stimulate the in situ 

plant growth, a more effective plant cover and species diversity, as well as the substratum microbial 

activity related to nutrients cycling, the physical and chemical characteristics (especially fertility) of the 

wastes should be improved. 

The application of amendment mixtures to the mine wastes, which makes a Technosol, can be a 

valuable technique because these amendments can decrease the potentially hazardous elements 

concentrations in the leachates, can create/promote the different biological soil functions, improving 

the wastes structure and water holding capacity and, consequently, contributing to the rehabilitation of 

the area (Kumpiene et al., 2008; Macías 2004; Macías et al., 2011).  

Some studies discuss the potential hazard of mine wastes (amended or not) based on the 

elemental concentrations in the available fraction (Adriano et al., 2004; Forsberg et al., 2008; Reis et 

al., 2012; Santos et al., 2014a) and/or ecotoxicological indicators (Alvarenga et al., 2009; González et 

al., 2012; Santos et al., 2013, 2015). To the best of our knowledge, there is no information concerning 

the amount of potentially hazardous elements that can be released to the surrounding environment, by 

leaching, from the entire mine wastes mass present in the field, mass when a rehabilitation process is

to be implemented. In order to optimize a Technosol, it is crucial to measure the chemical elements 

concentrations in the leachates.  

Several leaching tests are used for scientific purposes, in an attempt to simulate the leaching 

processes at which the materials are exposed in the field during the rain events in order to evaluate 

the leachates quality and the elements concentrations leached from the materials (Chezom et al., 

2013; Fällman and Aurell, 1996; Perera et al., 2005).  

The DIN method (DIN 38414-S4 extraction), one of the most commonly used, is a standard batch 

test widely used for solid wastes and recommended by European Union (Kocasoy and Murat, 2009). It 

has been regulatory compliance in Germany and Austria, and was used as basis for the European 

standard leaching method EN 12457 and other tests recently developed under CEN TC/292 (Perera et 

al., 2005). In this method, is used a 1:10 (m:V) solid wastes:distilled (deionized) water ratio, 

continuously agitated for 24 h. The water percolation through the waste materials is also used as a 

direct and simple percolation method of obtaining leachates (Pérez-López et al., 2008; Santos et al., 

2014a, 2015; Yao et al., 2008). 

This study aimed to evaluate: i) the variations of the elemental concentrations in the simulated 

leachates from Technosols, prepared with gossan or sulfide-rich mine wastes and organic/inorganic 

amendments after one, four, seven and thirteen months of incubation; and ii) the potential 

environmental risk of these Technosols evaluated from the mass of the leached potentially hazardous 

elements calculated taking into account the leachates elemental concentrations and the tailings mass 

in São Domingos mining area. 

 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Components of the Technosols 

 

Composite samples of two mining wastes (gossan wastes – GW and sulfide-rich wastes – SW) 

were collected within São Domingos mine in 2009, close to the open pit (GW) and in the south-west 

zone of the open pit near the former copper leaching tanks (SW). These mine wastes were mainly 

chosen owing to their great volumetry and wide distribution in São Domingos mine, as well as their 

chemical characteristics (Álvarez-Valero et al., 2008; Quental et al., 2002, 2013).  

The Technosols were composed of gossan (GW) or sulfide-rich wastes (SW) and amendment 

mixtures containing distinct organic/inorganic wastes from green-agriculture (plant remains + 

strawberry substrate at 2:3 m/m – AW; and rockwool used for strawberry crops – RW) and small 

distilleries (Arbutus unedo L. and Ceratonia siliqua L. fruit spirits distillation – AuW and CW, 

respectively) at 12 g/kg, 30 g/kg and 60 g/kg of each mine waste. In Technosols containing SW were 

also applied residues from quarry (limestone rock wastes – LW), at 22 g/kg. Seven Technosols were 

tested for each mine waste (n = 3 or 4 for each Technosol made with GW or SW, respectively) (Table 

1). In order to assess the efficiency of the Technosols, control treatments were also considered 

containing only the mine wastes (n = 3 or 4 for GW or SW, respectively).

The organic and inorganic amendments were used due to their large quantities in the mine vicinity, 

very small cost (only associated to the transport) and beneficial and safe characteristics. The chemical 

characteristics of the used materials are given in Table 2.  

 

Experimental set up and samples analysis 

 

The mine wastes and amendments were air-dried. All materials were mixed manually, potted and 

maintained at 70 % of their water-holding capacity. Two sets of microcosm assays were performed in 

pots (?2 kg of each mine waste; Assay 1 – total fraction of SW and Assay 2 – fraction &amp;lt;10 mm of GW) 

under controlled conditions in greenhouse. The assays were monitored during seven and thirteen 

months for GW (n = 3 per treatment) and SW (n = 4 per treatment), respectively. 

Samples from control (GW or SW) and Technosols were collected (&amp;lt;5 cm depth) after one, four, 

seven and thirteen months of incubation. These materials were homogenized, sieved (&amp;lt;2 mm) and 

kept fresh (4 ºC) until chemical analysis. They were used to obtain simulated leachates (DIN 38414-S4 

extraction). In the method DIN, the different chemical elements were extracted from the solid phases 

by contact with distilled water (1:10 m/V), for 24 h in a rotatory agitator. Following the DIN extraction, 

pH and electrical conductivity (EC) were measured after 15 min and 24 h of agitation. Simulated 

leachates were filtrated (0.45 µm) and stored at –18 ºC until the analysis. In the leachates were 

determined the concentrations of: Al, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Pb and Zn by flame atomic absorption 

spectrometry; As by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry; chlorides, nitrates and sulfates 

by ion chromatography; and phosphates by visible spectrophotometry (molybdenum blue method; 

USEPA 1979).  

 

Data analysis 

 

Statistical analysis was performed with the statistical programme SPSS v18.0 for Windows. Data 

were analysed by one way ANOVA, and post-hoc Duncan’s test (p &amp;lt;0.05) was used to separate 

means. Data not satisfying assumptions for ANOVA were analysed non-parametrically using Kruskal-

Wallis ANOVA by a rank test. For statistical purposes, the results below the detection limit were 

assumed as half of the detection limit. 

The potential environmental risk of SW, GW, and respective Technosols was evaluated from the 

mass of the leached potentially hazardous elements. For the calculations were used  the minimum 

and maximum concentration of the potentially hazardous elements in the simulated leachates, and the 

mass of tailings in São Domingos mining area reported by Álvarez-Valero et al. (2008) and Pérez-

López et al. (2008).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Technosols composed of sulfide-rich wastes and amendment mixtures 

 

Leachates electrical conductivity and pH 

 

The pH of the leachates from sulfide-rich wastes (SW) was very low (2.1?2.4, Fig. 1B) and the EC 

reached values ranging between 2.9 and 5.2 mS/cm depending on sampling period (Fig. 1D). These 

results were in the same range than acid mine drainages from São Domingos mine and other mines 

belonging to the IPB (Abreu et al., 2010; Sanchez-España et al., 2005, 2008). Nevertheless, the pH 

values of leachates from the present study were lower than those in simulated leaching (1:20 m:V) 

using mineralized rock samples from Furtei gold mine (2.6?5.0; Da Pelo et al., 2009). The pH values 

measured in the sulfide-rich wastes from São Domingos can be related to their content in sulfides. 

After one month of incubation, the pH of the leachates from SW-Technosols increased to values 

between 3.8 and 5.1 (Fig. 1B) due to the presence limestone rock wastes. However, after four months, 

the pH of the leachates of these SW-Technosols decreased to the initial value, similar to the leachates 

from control (pH ?2.4), due to the continuous generation of acid drainage, which promoted the 

carbonates dissolution. In fact, the variation of pH between 15 min and 24 h confirm that limestone 

was not present in SW-Technosols (Figs. 4A and 4B) after the fourth month of incubation. 

Although the pH values have remained without any further change until the end of the experiment, 

the leachates from SW-Technosols had pH values slightly higher than control leachates (especially at 

the end of the experiment where leachates pH of all SW-Technosols was significantly higher than 

control; Fig. 1B). This small increase in the pH can be related to the action of organic acids from 

amendments which have some buffering capacity (data not shown) and/or inhibition of the sulfide 

minerals oxidation by the organic matter.  

During the experiment, some SW-Technosols showed a decrease of EC in leachates when 

compared to the control (except in the fourth month; Fig. 1D). After one and seven months of 

incubation, only leachates from S-A12 (EC: 1.9 mS/cm) and S-A30 (EC: 3.1 mS/cm), respectively, 

presented EC significantly different from control (2.9 and 3.8 mS/cm). However by the end of the 

experiment (13 months), the EC in leachates from all SW-Technosols (3.6?4.7 mS/cm) were lower 

than control (5.2 mS/cm).  

In general, no clear distinction was observed for doses application of 12 and 30 g/kg and type of 

amendment mixtures in SW-Technosols. However, the Technosol S-A60 seems to have more 

effective results in the pH increase and reduction of EC in leachates. 

 

Anions concentrations in the leachates 

 

Anions concentrations in the leachates from SW and the respective Technosols are given in Figure 

2. The concentrations of anions in the simulated leachates were in the same range than those 

reported for acid mine drainage from the IPB (Abreu et al., 2008, 2010; Sánchez-España et al., 2005, 

2008). Moreover, sulfates concentration in leachates from the first sampling (after one month of

Incubation, 45.4 g S/kg) was still higher than those reported for the water/acid soluble and 

exchangeable fraction of the brittle pyrite wastes from São Domingos mine (34.4 g S/kg; Pérez-López 

et al. 2008). In the control, the concentrations of As (17.7?38.4 mg As/kg ? 1.5?4.8 mg/L) and sulfate 

(37.9?136.1 g/kg ? 3.2?11.2 g/L) were larger than in the majority of the simulated leaching (1:20 m:V) 

from mineralized rock samples collected in Furtei gold mine (0.001?0.27 mg As/L and 0.3?1.97 g 

SO4/L; Da Pelo et al., 2009). However, the same authors also reported 10 mg As/L in the leachates of 

some samples. These variations can be related to the heterogeneous composition of the sulfide-rich 

wastes. 

In general, significant differences were observed in the anions concentrations of leachates from 

SW-Technosols and SW. During the experiment, As concentrations in the leachates from all SW-

Technosols, independently of the type and dose of amendments, decreased more than 63 % (mg/kg ? 

Control: 17.7?38.4; SW-Technosols: 0.05?9.8). However, for phosphates and sulfates, this behaviour 

was only observed in some sampling periods. After one month of incubation, the SW-Technosols 

leachates also presented lower concentrations of phosphates and sulfates (0.2?6.3 mg PO4/kg and 

40.9?81.4 g SO4/kg) than the control (194.1 mg PO4/kg and 136.1 g SO4/kg). Only in the leachates 

sampled in the seventh month of incubation was observed the same behaviour for phosphates (mg/kg 

? Control: 60.3; SW-Technosols: 6.9?22.7). Nevertheless the leachates collected after four months of 

incubation from SW-Technosols with high dose application of amendment mixture (S-A60) contained 

less phosphates than those collected from the control and the other SW-Technosols (Fig. 2). 

After one month of incubation, the significant increase of the pH values in the leachates from SW-

Technosols seems to influence negatively the concentrations of phosphates and sulfates (rphosphate = –

0.72 and rsulfate = –0.83).  The decrease of the anions concentrations can be explained by the 

crystallisation of metal arsenates (e.g. segnitite [Pb(Fe
3+

)3H(AsO4)2(OH)6)] and arsenbrackebuschite 

[Pb2(Fe
2+

,Zn)(AsO4)(HAsO4)(OH)]),  

phosphates (e.g. berlinite (AlPO4) and corkite [Pb(Fe
3+

)3(PO4)(SO4)(OH)6]), and sulfates (e.g. 

alunogen [Al2(SO4)3•17H2O], linarite [Cu
2+

Pb(SO4)(OH)2] and melanterite [Fe
2+

SO4•7H2O]) both in the 

surface and/or in the core materials contained in the pots (Santos et al. 2014a). In general, the SW-

Technosols, independently of the type and dose of amendments, were efficient in the decrease of the 

anions spread to the surrounding environment.  

Significant variations in the anions concentrations occurred in all treatments during the experiment, 

however this fact was not explained only by pH values variation from leachates, but by the variation of 

all the elements concentrations, which can be saturated in relation to several solid phases. In general, 

significant increase of anions in leachates from SW-Technosols occurred between the first and fourth 

month of incubation as a result of the pH decrease.

Cations concentrations in the leachates 

 

As for anions, the sulfide-rich wastes released great amounts of several cations (Fig. 3). Taking 

into account both seasonal and mine variability, simulated leachates from the SW  (control) had 

elements concentrations in the same range than acid mine drainage from the IPB (Abreu et al., 2008, 

2010; Sánchez-España et al., 2005, 2008). In general, cations concentrations (Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb and Zn) 

obtained in this study were smaller than those corresponding to water/acid soluble and exchangeable 

fraction in brittle pyrite wastes (379 mg Cu/kg, 19 mg Mn/kg and 494 mg Zn/kg; Pérez-López et al. 

2008), although some exceptions were observed for specific elements and sampling periods (e.g. Cu, 

Mn and Zn after one month of incubation and Mn in the thirteenth month).  

Concentrations of Ca (4.4?6.4 g/kg ? 386.4?529.5 mg/L) in the SW leachates were larger than 

those in leachates from Furtei mine (45?162 mg Ca/L; Da Pelo et al., 2009). However, in simulated 

leachates (1:20 m:V) from mineralized rocks collected in Furtei mine dumps (Da Pelo et al., 2009), the 

concentrations of Al, Cu, Fe and Na were in the same range than those in the leachates obtained from 

the SW. The same authors reported smaller concentrations of Zn (0.17?1.8 mg/L; studied mine 

wastes (SW): 11.6?63.0 mg/L ? 128.9?767.2 mg/kg) than in the control (SW), while concentrations of 

Pb and Mg were more than 200-fold higher than in the control (SW) (SW: 0.2?1.9 mg/L ? 2.5?21.0 

mg/kg; 5.1?24.9 mg/L ? 56.8?301.3 mg/kg, respectively).  

Significant differences were observed among the concentrations of some cations in leachates from 

the SW-Technosols and SW (Fig. 3). After one month of incubation, the amendment mixtures included 

in the SW-Technosols contributed to the improvement of the leachates quality. Thus, in these 

leachates, the concentrations of Al, Cu, Fe, Na and Zn decreased between 50 and 99 %, depending 

on the element, when compared to those from the control (SW: 2.1 g Al/kg; 589.7 mg Cu/kg; 7.9 g 

Fe/kg; 5.3 mg Na/kg; 767.2 mg Zn/kg). Although the immobilization of these cations can be related to 

their chelation, complexation and/or increase of exchangeable positions by organic matter addition 

(Adriano et al., 2004; Kumpiene et al., 2008), the increase of pH in the leachates (Fig. 1B), due to the 

acid neutralization by limestone rock wastes, seems to affect negatively the cations concentrations (rAl 

= –0.88; rCu = –0.82; rFe = –0.73; rZn = –0.83). In fact, leaching of Cu and Zn is strongly pH dependent 

(Kumpiene et al., 2008). 

The addition of phosphate to the waste materials, through the nutrition solution included in the 

rockwool and other organic wastes, can also contribute to the formation of metal-phosphates and 

consequently to the immobilization of the metals (Adriano et al. 2004; Hodson et al. 2001). In fact, 

solid phases as corkite [Pb(Fe
3+

)3(PO4)(SO4)(OH)6] and berlinite (AlPO4) crystallised in the core of the 

same sulfide materials amended with the mixtures AW + AuW + CW + RW applied at 12 and 30 g/kg 

(corresponding to Technosols S-C12 and S-C30; Table 1) (Santos et al., 2014a). 

The Na concentrations (&amp;lt;0.4?2.8 mg/kg) in the SW-Technosols leachates were always very low 

when compared to the SW during all the experiment (50?99 % decrease of Na).  

Copper and Zn concentrations in some SW-Technosols leachates were higher (205.5?646.9 mg 

Cu/kg; 123.5?538.7 mg Zn/kg, depending on sampling period) than in the SW (160.7?211.5 mg 

Cu/kg; 128.9?179.6 mg Zn/kg). This is probably due to the presence of low molecular weight organic

acids liberated during the amendments organic matter decomposition, accelerated by the sulfuric acid 

generated from the oxidation of pyrite. This organo-metallic complexes are water soluble and mobile 

(Kabata-Pendias and Pendias, 2001) and can explain the increase of Cu and Zn in the leachates of 

the SW-Technosols with time. The concentration of Fe in the SW-Technosols, after one month of 

incubation, is dramatically lower than in the SW leachates, what can be explained by the pH increase 

as a consequence of the limestone rock waste reaction with the acid generated by pyrite oxidation. 

The effect of the increase of the pH was not so drastic in decreasing the concentration of Cu and Zn in 

the leachates from the SW-Technosols collected one month after the incubation (Fig. 3). The Fe 

concentrations were progressively increasing during the time span of the experiment due to the 

combined effects of the pH decrease (as a consequence of limestone rock entire dissolution) and 

continuous Fe release from the pyrite oxidation.  

After fourth and thirteen months of incubation, the concentrations of Al in SW-Technosols 

leachates were higher than in the SW. However, no clear tendency was observed related to the 

amendment mixture and application dose. The use of rockwool, with high amount of Al (Tables 1 and 

2), in the amendment mixtures, and the low pH of the leachates collected after the first month of 

incubation (Fig. 1) can explain the increase of Al concentrations in the SW-Technosols leachates in 

relation to those collected from SW. In spite of the possible dissolution of the rockwool used in the 

amendments with release of Al to the acid solutions, the lower concentrations of the Al in the 

leachates of the SW-Technosols collected after one month of incubation, when compared to those of 

the leachates from SW, can be explained by the variations of the pH of the leachates. The solution 

with higher pH has lower concentrations of Al (Figs. 1 and 3).  

Until the fourth month of incubation all the leachates from SW and SW-Technosols had similar 

concentrations of Pb (Fig. 3). After the seven month of incubation a positive contribution of the 

amendments included in the SW-Technosols was observed decrease of more than 87 % of the Pb 

concentration in the SW-Technosols leachates. The application of organic matter can promote the 

formation of organometallic complexes with Pb and the increase of the cationic exchange capacity of 

the materials (Adriano et al., 2004). The existence of phosphates (from organic wastes and nutrient 

solution included in the rockwool) can also justify the Pb concentration diminution in the leachates 

(Hodson et al. 2001). In fact, Santos et al. (2014a) reported not only berlinite (AlPO4) but also other 

solid phases containing Pb, mainly belonging to the alunite–jarosite-group (e.g. plumbojarosite 

[Pb(Fe
3+

)6(SO4)4(OH)12], and segnitite [Pb(Fe
3+

)3H(AsO4)2(OH)6]). Significant decrease of Pb 

concentrations in the leaching solutions was also obtained by Ioannidis and Zouboulis (2005) when 

synthetic and natural apatite was applied for the stabilization of simulated Pb-contaminated soils. 

The concentrations of Ca and Mg in the leachates from SW-Technosols (4.9?10.9 g/kg and 

221.9?764.5 mg/kg, respectively) had larger values than control (4.4?6.4 g Ca/kg and 56.8?301.3 mg 

Mg/kg) in all sampling periods (Fig. 3), as the result of the high concentrations of these elements in all 

the used amendments (Table 2). The rate of reductive dissolution of Mn oxides by organic matter is 

increased by lowering of pH (Sparks, 1995), which associated to the higher concentrations of Mn in 

the amendments can explain the increase of Mn in the leachates from SW-Technosols after thirteen 

months of incubation (Table 2 and Fig. 3).

Technosols composed of gossan wastes and amendment mixtures  

Leachates electrical conductivity and pH 

 

In the leachates obtained from the GW and respective Technosols, and for the same treatment, 

similar pH and EC values were observed after 15 min and 24 h of shaking (Fig. 4). The values of pH 

and EC obtained from GW leachates  were different  from those reported by Santos et al. (2013) to 

soils developed on gossan materials collected in the same mine area. 

The leachates pH and EC, for all the sampling periods and amendments application increased 

during the experiments’ time (Control ? pH: 4.2?4.4 and EC: 0.08?0.10 mS/cm, GW-Technosols ? pH: 

4.6?5.8 and EC: 0.12?0.45 mS/cm; Figs. 4B and 4D). Similar behaviour was reported by Alvarenga et 

al. (2009), by the application of different organic residues (municipal solid waste compost, garden 

waste compost and sewage sludge), at 25, 50 and 100 Mg/ha (doses close to those applied in this 

study – 30, 75 and 150 Mg/ha), to metal-contaminated soils from the Aljustrel mining area. However, 

Santos et al. (2013) found that for soils collected in the São Domingos mine and developed on gossan 

wastes amended with hydrophilic polyacrylate polymers occurred an increase of the pH of the 

leachates (Control: 6.1; Amended treatments: 6.9?7.1) while the EC in all the cases remained almost 

constant (?0.06 mS/cm). 

 After one month of incubation, significant differences were already obtained in pH and EC of the 

leachates from the GW-Technosols containing the 30 and 60 g/kg doses of amendments (pH: 5.0?5.5, 

EC: 0.16?0.26 mS/cm), when compared with the leachates from GW (pH: 4.2, EC: 0.08 mS/cm) (Figs. 

4B and 4D). However, after seven months, this significant improvement of pH was obtained in all 

leachates from the GW-Technosols independently of the application dose and the amendment mixture 

(pH: 4.8?5.8, Fig. 4B). In the same period, only leachates from Technosols G-A60 (EC: 0.45 mS/cm) 

and G-B30 (EC: 0.25 mS/cm), which received a high dose of amendment and with specific 

amendment mixture (residue from the liquor distillation of A. unedo fruit and amendment application at 

60 g/kg and residue from liquor distillation of C. siliqua fruit and amendment application at 30 g/kg, 

respectively), had higher EC than the control (0.08 mS/cm). Although EC had increased slightly in 

leachates from Technosols when compared with control (GW), these values were still small (&amp;lt;0.45 

mS/cm). No variation in the values of pH and EC in the leachates from each treatment were observed 

along the time. 

 

Anions concentrations in the leachates 

 

Anions concentrations in the leachates from GW and respective GW-Technosols are shown in Figure 

5. In all sampling periods, leachates from some GW-Technosols had higher anions concentrations 

than GW, but no clear tendency was observed for the amendment mixture and application dose of 12 

and 30 g/kg. Nevertheless, GW-Technosol containing the amendment mixture at 60 g/kg (G-A60), 

usually released, by leaching, the highest amount of anions. The increase of chlorides, nitrates and 

phosphates in leachates from GW-Technosols is mainly related to the nutrient solution used in the 

strawberry cultivation, which was incorporated in rockwool and agriculture wastes (Tables 1 and 2).

Fig. 5 Variation with time of anion concentrations in simulated leachates from Technosols and gossan wastes 

(Mean ± SD; n = 4). Values from same sampling period followed by a different letter are significantly different (p &amp;lt;

0.05). 

 

Although the concentrations of anions in the leachates are different, compared to the present 

study, the increase of As and phosphate in leachates from soils developed on gossan materials 

amended with polyacrylates was also observed (Santos et al., 2013). However, according to the same 

study, the same increase did not occur for chlorides, nitrates and sulfates. 

The higher As concentrations in leachates from GW-Technosols (21.4?557.8 µg/kg depending on 

treatment and sampling period) can be related to the increase of low-molecular-weight organic acids, 

derived from amendments application, which can release As from Fe–, Mn– and Al–oxides or 

hydroxides (Zang et al., 2005). In fact, soils developed on this mine waste in São Domingos mining 

area have 3–34 % and 0.01?0.4 % of the total As associated to Fe–oxides and Mn-oxides, 

respectively (Abreu et al., 2012; Santos et al., 2012). Another explanation to the increase of As 

concentration in the leachates can be given by the presence of solid phases with low solubility, at 

lower pH, that can naturally exist in the gossan materials, like carminite (Fe2Pb(AsO4)2(OH)2), segnitite

(Fe3Pb(AsO4)(HAsO4)(OH)6) and kankite (FeAsO4•3.5H2O) (Santos et al., 2012). The solubility of 

these solid phases increases with the increasing of the pH of their environment, as a result of their 

non-congruent dissolution. The increase of As concentrations in those leachates can be related to the 

complex behaviour of the systems where new solid phases can be formed with different solubilities.   

The time evolution of the leachates anions concentrations showed no significant variations in the 

concentrations of As (except for G-A12), phosphate (except for G-A12) and sulfate, independently of 

the treatment. In general, chloride concentrations reached the highest values at the fourth month of 

incubation. For nitrates, it is apparent a decrease in their concentrations, but no clear tendency was 

observed according to amendment dose and/or mixture. 

 

Cations concentrations in the leachates 

 

Cations concentrations in leachates from GW and respective Technosols are shown in Figure 6 

(except Al, Cu and Pb). All leachates had concentrations of Pb (&amp;lt;2.5 mg/kg), Al (in first and fourth 

month &amp;lt;2.8 mg/kg) and Cu (seventh month &amp;lt;0.5 mg/kg) below the detection limit of the apparatus.  

Concentrations of the studied cations in leachates from GW were quite different from those 

reported by Santos et al. (2013). These variations will be related to the chemical composition of the 

waste materials and despite being both classified as gossan materials, their heterogeneity is well 

known. 

Similar concentrations of Zn after one and seven months of incubation and Fe after one and four 

months of incubation were observed among treatments. However, Alvarenga et al. (2009) reported a 

decrease of Zn in simulated leaching assays carried out in contaminated soils from Aljustrel mine area 

where organic wastes were applied.  

Amendments application, independently of application dose and type, decreased significantly the 

Cu concentrations (&gt; 50 %) after one and four months, compared to control (?0.7 mg/kg), to values 

lower than detection limit. Similar results were observed by Alvarenga et al. (2009). In fact, organic 

matter application can promote the formation of stable complexes with Cu and increase cationic 

exchange capacity (Adriano et al., 2004; Kumpiene et al., 2008).  

Leachates from the GW-Technosols had higher concentrations of Ca, K, Mg, Mn and Na (more 

than 20 %) than the control (mg/kg – Ca: 21.7?62.7, K: 41.0?64.7, Mg: 6.0?10.8, Mn:&amp;lt;0.5?0.6, Na: 

5.3?25.0), especially after one and four month of incubation. All the amendments mixtures and 

application doses originated the increase of Ca concentration in the leachates during all the 

experiment. For the other cations, a different behaviour occurs and no clear tendency was observed 

whatever the amendment mixture and/or application dose. Similarly to some anions behaviour, the 

high concentrations of these nutrients in leachates from the GW-Technosols were mainly related to 

the nutrient solution incorporated in the rockwool (Tables 1 and 2). The increase of Fe concentration in 

the leachates was also observed in soils developed on gossan materials amended with diapers 

(Santos et al., 2013). These authors also observed that the application of different types of 

polyacrylate did not alter the concentrations of Ca, K, Mg, Mn and Na in the leachates.

Potential environmental impact of Technosols composed of gossan and sulfide-rich wastes from São Domingos mine: assay of 
simulated leaching 

168 

 

the elements from wastes/soils under field conditions (Chezom et al., 2013), it is essential the 

evaluation of the mobilization of hazardous elements by the leachates and their potential 

environmental impact. Considering the concentrations of the potentially hazardous elements obtained 

in the simulated leachates and the total mass of GW and SW estimated in São Domingos mine (Tg ? 

SW: 0.20?0.27 and GW: 4.1?4.34; Álvarez-Valero et al., 2008; Pérez-López et al., 2008), the total 

amounts of the elements released by the mine wastes are presented in Table 3. 

Sulfide-rich wastes can leach to the adjacent areas significant amounts of potentially hazardous 

elements. In general, the amounts of these elements were significantly lower than the values obtained 

by Pérez-Lopez et al. (2008), which considered the available fraction (soluble and exchangeable 

fraction) of the same elements in the wastes. Soluble fractions of Al, As, Fe and Pb represented less 

than 7 % of the total concentrations of these elements, but other chemical elements, that can become 

hazardous, are mainly available (percentage of the available fraction compared to their total 

concentrations ? S: 19?70; Cu: 8?28; Zn: 11?68). 

In spite of the low values of the soluble fractions in the GW and respective Technosols (&amp;lt;2.6 % of 

total concentrations depending on the element, treatment and sampling period) and of the elements 

concentrations in the leachates (with or without amendments application), in each rainfall also can be 

leached significant amounts of hazardous elements for the adjacent areas due to the great total mass 

of this type of mine wastes that exist in São Domingos mine.  

Although the total mass of SW is smaller than the mass of GW in the mine area, the high 

concentrations of potentially hazardous elements leached from SW represent a greatest 

environmental impact in each rainfall. The circulation of water and leachates through SW, which 

generate acids by sulfides oxidation, amplified the environmental impact when compared to other 

mine wastes. 

In general, the conception of GW-Technosols increases the amounts of some elements in the 

leachates. However, in the GW-Technosols, especially with application of the highest dose of the 

amendments, the increase of organic matter and nutrient contents stimulate the 

development/colonization of vegetation (Santos et al., 2014b, 2015) in these soils. Consequently, this 

can reduce the chemical elements leaching and the water flow to the deeper zones of the tailings 

reducing the wastes-water interaction. Nevertheless, Santos et al. (2015) referred that no vegetation 

was able to grow in the SW-Technosols owing to the very low pH, as a result of continuous acid 

drainage generation and low buffer capacity of the amendments. 

  

Comparison of methodologies to obtain leachates 

 

Comparing the elements concentrations in the leachates obtained by the DIN method with those in 

the leachates obtained by distilled water percolation (Santos et al., 2014a,  2015), it is evident the high 

availability of the chemical elements in the gossan (GW) and sulfide wastes (SW). Although the 

elements’ concentrations in the leachates from SW are in the same range than the values reported for 

acid mine drainage from IPB (Abreu et al., 2008, 2010; Sánchez-España et al., 2005, 2008), 

significant differences between the elements concentrations in the leachates obtained by the two

above referred methods were observed for the majority of the elements.  The same variation was 

obtained for the concentrations of the elements in the leachates from gossan wastes obtained with the 

two referred methodologies. 

Even being the DIN extraction a forced extraction method (Gomes and Pinto, 2006), the 

concentrations of the elements in the simulated leachates were significantly smaller than in leachates 

obtained by water percolation (Santos et al., 2014a, 2015), independently of the mine wastes and 

consequently their reactivity. Similar results were obtained with municipal solid wastes by Kocasoy 

and Murat (2009) but not with steelmaking slags (Gomes and Pinto, 2006).  

Several factors can be associated to this variation between leaching methodologies, as for instance 

the sample size, the particle size distribution, the solid:liquid ratio, and the duration of the leaching test 

(Chezom et al., 2013; Fällman and Aurell, 1996; Gomes and Pinto, 2006). The size of the waste 

particles used in each method (&amp;lt;2 mm in the DIN method and the total fraction of SW or &amp;lt;1 cm for 

GW in the water percolation method), and the mechanic agitation can be considered the main origin of 

the differences between the values of the elements concentrations in the leachates. The influence of 

particle size in batch test was demonstrated by Fällman and Aurell (1996) for lead refractory slags. 

The heterogeneity of the solid phases composing the mine wastes and consequently the surface 

are exposed to the water flow in the pots is larger, while the ratio solid:liquid is much smaller in the 

percolation method (1:0.08 m:V) than in the DIN extraction (1:10 m:V). In general, the water 

percolates through preferential channels, due to the large grain size of mine wastes.  

It should be noticed that during the experiment can occur several chemical processes, like 

complexation and/or adsorption/desorption (Gomes and Pinto, 2006) and even precipitation of 

secondary minerals (Fällman and Aurell, 1996; Santos et al., 2014a) what can influence the 

concentration of the elements in the simulated leachates. Nevertheless in a cycle of leaching-

evaporation, different solid phases can be formed with stabilities determined by the environment, 

which can reduce or increase the elements concentrations according to the environment changes. In 

fact, in the percolation experiments with SW was identified a significant time evolution of the 

efflorescent salts and in solid phases in the pots' core materials (Santos et al., 2014a).The variation in 

the primary and secondary minerals with different solubilities will change the concentrations of the 

elements in the leachates (Fällman and Aurell, 1996; Santos et al., 2014a).

simulated leaching

CONCLUSIONS 

 

Based on elements concentrations in simulated leachates and total mass of gossan (GW) and 

sulfide-rich wastes (SW) in São Domingos mine, both mine wastes generate great environmental 

impact. The continuous oxidation of the sulfide minerals led to the formation of very acid solutions, 

which can release and afterwards leach high amounts of anions and cations. Although the GW had 

leached lower amounts of elements, compared to the SW, the extensive mass of the GW contribute to 

the release of considerable amounts of potentially hazardous elements. Being the annual precipitation 

in São Domingos relatively small (559 mm), the tailings can still release continuously in each rainfall 

event great amounts of potentially hazardous elements to the adjacent areas increasing the elements’ 

concentrations in soils and waters. 

The amendments application improved the GW, decreasing their environmental impact, but the 

beneficial effect of the amendments was not clear for the SW. However a clear influence of the dose 

and type of the amendments was not observed during the entire experiment. Although GW -

Technosols had leached more As when compared to the control, its concentrations were small. 

Moreover, the increase of pH and nutrients in leachates from these Technosols is an advantage in the 

rehabilitation process. In SW-Technosols, the amendments mixtures did not increase the pH of the 

leachates since the fourth month of incubation, owing to the absence of limestone rock waste, 

because the carbonates were dissolved in the reaction with the sulfuric acid generated by the pyrite 

oxidation. Other organic and inorganic wastes and, possibly, their rate of application should be studied 

over a longer time span with the objective of increasing the pH of the leachates from SW, which 

seems to decrease the cations and anions concentrations in the leachates as was observed in the first 

month of incubation.

ABSTRACT 

 

Greenhouse pot experiments were conducted over 13 months to evaluate the effect of two 

amendment mixtures doses (30 and 75 Mg/ha) on the geochemical dispersion of trace elements by 

leaching hazardous mine wastes from the São Domingos mine. Mineralogical evolution of these 

materials was also evaluated. Amendment mixtures containing solid wastes from agriculture (plant 

remains + strawberry substrate and rockwool used for the strawberry crop) and from distillation of 

Ceratonia siliqua L. and Arbutus unedo L. fruits were used to improve the chemical characteristics of 

leachates from sulfide mine wastes. Sulfide mine wastes had acidic characteristics, as well as high 

electrical conductivity and total elements concentrations (g/kg; Al: 54.8–61.2; Fe: 104.0–110.0; Pb: 

9.0–13.8; S: 63.6–68.0; As: ?1). These features contributed to the large capacity for leaching of 

hazardous elements during, at least, the first four months of incubation. In the seventh month of 

incubation, there was a significant decrease in the leachates concentration of the majority of 

hazardous elements. The addition of amendments minimised trace elements dispersion in leachates 

percolation during the first seven months (25 to 99 % reduction compared to control, depending on the 

element and sampling period). However, the leachates characteristics were not influenced by 

amendments doses and no significant differences were observed in leachates composition (control 

and amended treatments) after 13 months. Amendments application led to differences between the 

solid phases of the efflorescent salts formed on the surface of the control and the amended 

treatments. The efflorescent salts contained very soluble Al sulfates, together with alunite-jarosite-

group solid phases in amended samples, and copiapite-group solid phases in control. In the core 

materials (5 to 10 cm in depth), the mineralogy was similar in both control and amended samples. The 

presence of various stable solid phases from alunite-jarosite-group, such as jarosite and beudantite 

(mainly in deeper materials), can explain the low concentrations of trace elements in the leachates 

after thirteen months.

INTRODUCTION 

 

The intense mining activity in massive sulfides from Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB) generates different 

types of wastes. In the São Domingos mine (IPB) in Portugal, large dumps attaining approximately 

0.27 Tg, as well as modern and Roman slags and smelting ashes, contain pyrite-rich materials and 

other sulfides, which produce acid drainage all year round (Álvarez-Valero et al., 2008; Matos, 2004). 

The production and circulation of acid mine leachates (or acid mine drainage – AMD) is a serious 

environmental problem in sulfide mine areas due to the extremely acidic conditions (frequently, pH &amp;lt;

1.5) they generate. The very low pH of the leachates promotes trace elements dispersion to adjacent 

areas, preventing the establishment of vegetation, as well as harming existing vegetation or other 

organisms that colonise neighbouring areas, thereby decreasing biodiversity (Abreu et al., 2010; Gil 

Bueno et al., 1990; Pérez-Lopez et al., 2008; Sánchez-España et al., 2005).  

The AMD treatment in the IPB has been unsustainable due to its characteristics, namely, extreme 

acidity and high multitrace elements concentrations (Sáinz et al., 2003). The large surface area of the 

tailings promotes sulfide oxidation and consequent AMD generation in a manner that is difficult to 

control. These sulfide-containing tailings also show rill and gully erosion, and lack of vegetation due to 

the high acidity and low fertility of these waste materials. 

Different organic and inorganic wastes, like red gypsum, sugar foam, sewage sludge, biosolids, fly 

ashes, pig manure, marble wastes, etc., have been evaluated as amendments to improve some 

physical, chemical and biological properties of mine tailings and contaminated soils (Basta et al., 

2001; Forsberg et al., 2008; Pérez-Lopez et al., 2008; Rodríguez-Jordá et al., 2012; Zanuzzi et al., 

2009). Some amendments, such as waste compost and sewage sludge, can contain high 

concentrations of hazardous trace elements that can increase the environmental risk of their 

application. Therefore, their use should be carefully monitored.  

Due to the different chemical behaviour of each trace element and the specific chemical and/or 

mineralogical composition of the amendments, selective immobilization and redistribution of trace 

elements in solid phases can be achieved efficiently (Rodríguez-Jordá et al., 2010, 2012). 

The application of amendment mixtures composed of several organic/inorganic wastes, instead of 

using a single type, can be more efficient in the rehabilitation of mining areas that contain high 

concentrations of several trace elements in tailings and highly contaminated leachates (Kumpiene et 

al., 2008). These amendment mixtures, which can make a Technosol in an attempt to create different 

soil functions, can reduce trace element availability and their concentrations in mine waste leachates 

(Macías, 2004) through the complementary effects of each amendment component. Several industrial 

or agro-industrial wastes, due to their intrinsic characteristics (high organic matter content and pH, and 

low concentration of trace elements, etc.), large available quantities and cost effectiveness, can be an 

economically attractive target to make a Technosol and a strategy for wastes valorisation (Macías, 

2004). 

The ecological rehabilitation of the São Domingos mine area can be achieved by minimising the 

leaching element concentrations and/or improving the chemical characteristics (for instance, increase 

in pH and decrease in salinity) of the leachates by remediation of mine wastes containing sulfides. The

use of amendments can also contribute to plant colonisation and stimulation of biogeochemical 

processes that promote mine waste treatment and soil remediation (Abreu and Magalhães, 2010). The 

success of the multielemental contaminated mine areas rehabilitation depends on the combination of 

the trace elements in tailings and the selection of adequate amendments (Kumpiene et al., 2008). 

Leachates from São Domingos and other mines in the IPB present multielemental contamination 

(Abreu et al., 2008, 2010; Sánchez-España, 2008; Sánchez et al., 2005). However, few studies are 

available on the effects of amendments on the leaching of cations and anions from sulfide-containing 

tailings (Pérez-Lopez et al., 2007), and even less for periods of monitoring longer than one year. 

Therefore studies on the variation over time of the chemical composition of leachates, following 

amendments addition to mine wastes, are environmentally relevant for future mine rehabilitation 

projects. 

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of two amendment mixtures (30 and 75 Mg/ha) on the 

availability of trace elements (cations and anions), which occurred at high concentrations in sulfide-

containing tailings, over thirteen months. Understanding changes in geochemistry over time is 

essential in ensuring successful sulfide mine wastes rehabilitation. Examining mineralogical evolution 

of mine wastes as a consequence of leaching and the attainment of new equilibria were also a goal of 

this study. 

 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Site characterization 

 

Sulfide mine wastes were collected from the São Domingos mine area, an abandoned mine 

located in the IPB and situated in the municipality of Mértola, SE Portugal. Mining activities date from 

the pre-Roman period with exploitation of Ag, Au and Cu, mainly in the gossan. However, modern 

exploitation (1857–1966) occurred both in the gossan and massive sulfides containing Cu, Zn, As and 

Pb (Quental et al., 2002). The exploitation and extraction processes produced large amounts of 

different mining wastes, which covered a surface area of around 3.2 x 10
6
 m

2
 (Álvarez-Valero et al., 

2008). In the Portuguese IPB, São Domingos is a severe case of the environmental impact of mining 

due to the dimension of the areas affected by AMD and the volume of wastes and tailings (11 x 10
6
 

m
3
), with high concentrations of hazardous trace elements (Álvarez-Valero et al., 2008; Matos and 

Martins, 2006). The sampling area is located within the mine area, SW of the open pit, near the former 

leaching tanks. 

 

Experiment set-up 

 

Composite samples of the sulfide mine wastes (MW), containing mainly crushed pyrite and 

smelting ashes, were collected in 2009. These materials were chosen due to their large amounts and 

wide distribution in the mine area, and their potential risk as a source of contamination (Álvarez-Valero 

et al., 2008; Quental et al., 2002). In addition, the tailings are bared and exposed to severe water 

erosion.

The amendments applied at 30 or 75 Mg/ha were mixtures containing distinct organic and 

inorganic wastes from: green agriculture (plant remains + strawberry substrate at 2:3 m/m) (AgrW), 

Arbutus unedo L. (ArbW) and Ceratonia siliqua L. (CerW) fruit spirits distillation; and rockwool used for 

strawberry crops (RW). Limestone rock wastes (LRW) with a particle size &amp;lt;2 mm were also used at 

55 Mg/ha (except in control) to raise the mine wastes pH to ? 4. These organic and inorganic wastes 

were used due to their physical and chemical characteristics and the fact that they can be easily 

obtained in large quantities at almost “zero cost” from the vicinity of the mine. 

The tailings and amendments were air-dried, mixed manually and potted. Microcosm assays were 

performed in pots containing around 6 kg of mine waste materials (total fraction). Three treatments 

were made (four replicates each): control with only mine wastes (MW); and MW + LRW + Amendment 

composed of AgrW + ArbW + CerW + RW (1:1:1:1) at 30 and 75 Mg/ha. All treatments were kept at 70 

% of water-holding capacity under controlled conditions in a greenhouse. The pots were monitored for 

thirteen months. 

 

Experimental monitoring and sample analyses 

 

Multielemental concentrations of the initial sulfide-containing mine wastes (fraction &amp;lt;2 mm) and 

organic/inorganic wastes were analysed by atomic emission spectrometry with induced plasma (ICP-

OES) and instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) after acid digestion with HClO4 + HNO3 + 

HCl + HF in an international accredited laboratory (Actlabs, ISO/IEC 17025, Activation Laboratories, 

2011). The fraction &amp;lt;2 mm was characterized for total concentrations of C and N (analysed by 

combustion with a Leco analyser), as well as for electrical conductivity (EC) and pH, both in water 

suspension (1:2.5 m/V) and extractable P and K (Póvoas and Barral, 1992). Particle size distribution 

of mine wastes (total fraction) was also determined by sieving. 

Mine waste materials (control) or the mixtures of MW and amendments were collected (0 to 5 cm of 

depth) with a cylindrical probe, from each pot, after collection of the surface efflorescent salts. These 

solids and the leachates obtained from deionised water percolation through the materials contained in 

the pots were collected after one, four, seven and thirteen months of incubation. At the end of the 

experiment (thirteen months), materials from all the treatments were also collected from a depth of 

around 10 cm. 

Only the mine wastes (control) and amended mine wastes collected after one and thirteen months 

of incubation were air-dried, homogenised, sieved (&amp;lt;2 mm) and analysed for pH, EC, total 

concentrations of C and N by the same methodologies referred to above. Total concentration of S was 

also determined by combustion with a Leco analyser. 

To obtain leachates by percolation, the materials in the pots were irrigated with a volume of 

deionised water that ensured an excess of 10 % of each pot’s water holding capacity, and left to 

percolate for 24 h. The leachates were collected in plastic flasks linked to the bottom of the pot hole by 

a plastic tube. The leachates were vacuum filtrated (&amp;lt;0.45 µm), and pH and EC measured. The filtrate 

was kept at –18 ºC. The leachates were analysed for: Al, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Pb and Zn total 

concentrations by flame atomic absorption spectrometry; As by graphite furnace atomic absorption

spectrometry; sulfates by ion chromatography; and phosphates by visible spectrophotometry using the 

molybdenum blue method (USEPA, 1979). 

Efflorescent salts were stored, after collection, in hermetic containers at room temperature far from 

the sunlight. Mineralogical analysis of the efflorescent salts collected after one and thirteen months, as 

well as of mine waste materials (total fraction) from the end of the experiment, was performed in 

random powder samples by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Cu K? radiation. The XRD analysis was 

performed in samples separated under a binocular microscope, and selected by colour and general 

morphological aspects (lustre, habit, etc.). In spite of the methodology used for mineral identification, 

the samples were always heterogeneous and the solid phases were not easy to identify, owing to the 

amount of lines obtained in the XRD spectra. The mineralogical analysis considered the elemental 

composition and the pH of the leachates, the known or foreseen solubilities of the solid phases, as 

well as the temperature and relative humidity in the greenhouse. The same efflorescent salts were 

also analysed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). 

After being analysed by XRD, the efflorescent salt samples and the mine waste materials were 

mixed with water (solid:water ratio of 0.033:10 and 1:10 (m/V), respectively), and shaken for 24 hours. 

The chemical composition of the obtained aqueous solutions with pH &amp;lt;3 was determined by high 

resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (Actlabs, ISO/IEC 17025, Activation 

Laboratories, 2011b). 

 

Data analysis 

 

Statistical analysis was performed with the statistical programme SPSS v18.0 for Windows. All data 

were checked for homogeneity of variance and normality (Shapiro-Wilk test) and, when possible, a 

one-way ANOVA was applied. Data not satisfying assumptions for ANOVA were analysed non-

parametrically using Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA by a rank test. Significant differences (p &amp;lt;0.05) were 

analysed by a post-hoc Tukey’s test. For statistical purposes, the results below the detection limit were 

assumed as half of the detection limit. Bivariate Pearson correlations were used to correlate the 

materials and leachates characteristics (r &gt; 0.95). Quality control of the analysis was undertaken by 

analytical replicate samples and laboratory standards at the international accredited laboratory 

(Activation Laboratories).  

 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Characterization and time evolution of solid materials  

 

Mine wastes are, in general, complex mixtures of heterogeneous materials, but the sulfide wastes 

collected from the São Domingos area did not show high variability in their chemical characteristics. 

These mine wastes presented a pH ? 2, large EC (7.4 to 7.5 mS/cm) and low fertility (Table 1). The 

large total carbon concentration in mine wastes was related to the considerable presence of smelting 

ashes and small pieces of charcoal. Mine wastes presented 54 % of the materials in the fraction &gt; 2 

mm, distributed as follows: ? 20 mm (7 %); 10–20 mm (10 %); 8–10 mm (5 %); 5–8 mm (11 %); 2–5

mm (21 %). The large amount of coarse materials together with the high total concentrations of trace 

elements (Table 2) probably contributed to the lack of vegetation, observed in the field, on dumps 

composed of these types of wastes.

Domingos. The physical and chemical characteristics of the mine wastes were associated with their 

predominant composition – materials containing sulfides, potential AMD generators.  

All the organic and inorganic wastes used as amendments presented chemical characteristics 

considered beneficial and safe for land application and rehabilitation of mine wastes. Concentrations 

of total nitrogen and extractable phosphorus and potassium, in addition to pH values, were larger than 

those in mine wastes (Table 1), while the lowest EC was observed (0.2 to 3.5 mS/cm) in all the 

amendments. Wastes from spirits distillation (ArbW and CerW) showed the highest total carbon 

concentrations (436.7 to 442.6 g/kg). Concentrations of trace elements in the amendments were much 

lower than those in mine wastes (Table 2). 

After one month of incubation and at the end of the experiment (thirteen months of incubation), 

amendments addition improved the structure of the materials by increasing the organic matter content 

and consequently raising the water-holding capacity. The amendments reduced EC by 31 to 53 % 

compared to control (Table 3). The pH of the amended mine wastes increased to 3.5–3.6 and ~2.1 

after one and thirteen months of incubation, respectively (Table 3) despite the presence of limestone 

rock wastes (in the initial composition of the amendments. However, when materials/water 

suspensions (1:10 m/V) from the first month of incubation were shaken for one and five days at room 

temperature, the measured pH were ~2.2 for control (for both shaking times) and 4.2-4.5 and 5.3-7.0 

for one and five days, respectively, for the amended samples. Similar shaking experiments performed 

with materials after four months of incubation presented pH values (2.1 &amp;lt;pH &amp;lt;2.5) in the same range 

as that of the collected leachate percolations (Fig. 1). Zanuzzi et al. (2009) in another microcosms 

assay involving the Brunita mine tailings pond, observed an increase in the pH of the materials 

following the addition of amendments, even after 24 months, from 2.8 (treatment not amended) to 7.3 

(application of marble wastes + pig manure or marble wastes + sewage sludge). However, those 

authors applied larger doses (166.7 Mg/ha) of marble wastes with larger particles (&amp;lt;2 mm: 26 %; 2–5 

mm: 74 %), compared to the present study (55 Mg/ha, &amp;lt;2 mm: 100 %). The comparison of the pH 

values gotten in this work,  for the shaken materials/water suspensions, with the results of Zanuzzi et 

al. (2009) show that the presence of  limestone in the amendments increases the pH to values higher 

than four. Thus, the pH lower than four, measured in this work, in the leachates from the amended 

materials, after one month of incubation, indicate that the limestone could not be in contact with the 

surrounding aqueous medium. This can be explained by the formation of a layer of calcium sulfate on 

the surface of the limestone grains. The Ca sulfate is the product of the reaction between the calcium 

carbonate and the sulfate ion present in the acid solutions generated by the pyrite oxidation. The 

calcium sulfate surface layer was dispersed after shaking, promoting the contact between the 

limestone and the aqueous solution, increasing the pH of the materials/water suspensions. However, 

after the fourth month of incubation the limestone was already dissolved once there was no change in 

the pH of the shaken materials/water suspensions. The decrease in the limestone effect at the 

beginning of the incubation, due to its reaction with the generated acidic leachates, was favoured by 

the small grain size (&amp;lt;2 mm) of the used material, which was therefore one disadvantage of this 

amendment. In fact, the kinetics of the limestone reaction increases when the size of the solid 

particles decreases. During the entire experiment, the acidity of mine wastes increased in all

After thirteen months of incubation, total sulfur concentration in the mine wastes with amendments 

was larger than that of control (Table 3). A significant reduction of total sulfur was only observed in the 

control (32 %) between one and thirteen months. Efflorescent salts formed crusts on the surfaces of 

the controls, reaching 5 mm in thickness. On the amended surfaces, there were only a few 

efflorescent salts. Both surfaces displayed efflorescent salts containing mixtures of soluble sulfates, as 

described in Section 3.3. Besides the migration of sulfates to the surface, leachates collected from 

control contained higher concentrations of sulfates (112 g SO4/L in leachates collected in the fourth 

month) than those that were treated with amendments (? 23 g SO4/L in leachates collected also in the 

fourth month).  

 

Characterization and time evolution of leachates 

Electrical conductivity and pH 

 

During the experimental period, pH and EC of the leachates from the treatments with amendments 

(pH: 1.95–2.47; EC: 4.36–21.05 mS/cm) were significantly different from those of the control (pH: 

1.13–1.58; EC: 11.08–51.92 mS/cm), although both were acidic and with high EC (Fig. 1). The

amendments increased the pH of leachates by more than 0.5 units and reduced the EC by more than 

43 %. These values contrast with the results of Ciccu et al. (2001) and Pérez-López et al. (2007), who 

applied fly ashes to pyritic sludge or to soils contaminated by reddish tailings and observed an 

increase of more than two units for the pH of the leachates (from 2 to 7.5 and from 6 to 8, respectively) 

after 210 and 350 days, respectively. However, EC was only reduced in the experiments with pyritic 

sludge (0.30 mS/cm). Rodríguez-Jordá et al. (2012) also recorded an increase of the pH of the 

leachates (from 3.4 to values &gt; 6) from São Domingos mine sediments 40 days after application of 

different calcium carbonate-containing amendments (sugar foam or mixtures of sugar foam + ashes 

from combustion of biomass or sugar foam + red gypsum + ashes from combustion of biomass). The 

pH values obtained by Rodríguez-Jordá et al. (2012) confirm our previous statement that the pH of 

amended wastes and their leachates is higher than four when calcium carbonate is present.

Fig. 1 Variation, with time, of pH and electrical conductivity in leachates, obtained by percolation, from sulfide 

mine wastes without and with amendments application at 30 and 75 Mg/ha (Mean ± SD; n = 4). 

 

The pH of the leachates from control was lower and the EC values higher than those measured in 

the leachates from pyritic sludge by Pérez-López et al. (2007, pH ? 2; EC: 2–4 mS/cm). However, the 

present work results were in the same range as those reported for acid mine drainages in the IPB 

(Abreu et al., 2010; Sanchez-España et al., 2005, 2008).  

The large quantity of sulfides in the mine wastes used in the present study can be one of the 

possible explanations for the great differences observed in leachates pH between this work data and 

those obtained by Forsberg et al. (2008) for Aitik Cu mine tailings containing only traces of metal 

sulfides whose pH ranged between 3.5 and 7.5. 

Until the seventh month of incubation, the decrease of the leachates pH was observed in all the 

treatments. However, pH values at the end of the experiment (thirteen months) were similar to those 

of the first month of incubation. This represented a pH increase, between the seventh and thirteenth 

month of incubation, from 1.15 to 1.55 for control, and from ? 1.9 to ? 2.3 for amendment-treated 

samples. The decrease of the pH of the leachates during an experimental period of 630 days was also 

observed by Forsberg et al. (2008) in the Aitik Cu mine tailings leaching. 

Regarding EC, the control samples exhibited a different trend compared to amended ones. Control 

EC values were in the same range as those reported for AMD from some IPB mines (Abreu et al., 

2010; Sanchez-España et al., 2005, 2008). Control showed significant variations in EC, with a 2.5–fold

increase in the fourth month (from 22.30 after the first month to 51.93 mS/cm), and a decrease to 

20.78 mS/cm in the seventh month and 11.08 mS/cm in the last month. In the leachates from the 

control, the highest values of EC (Fig. 1) were measured in the fourth month, which agrees with the 

majority of the elemental total concentrations measured by other techniques. In treatments with 

amendments, the values of EC in the first and fourth months of incubation (11.3 and 21.1 mS/cm, 

respectively) were not significantly different, but in the following months, a significant and progressive 

decrease was observed, reaching a value of around 4 mS/cm in the thirteenth month. The sampling 

made after one month of incubation occurred in spring, while the fourth and seventh month samplings 

occurred in summer. During spring and summer, the strong evaporation contributed to continuous 

crust formation of salts crystallising on the materials’ surface. Irrigation usually caused complete 

dissolution of the efflorescent salts, but this was not complete during the warmest months, increasing 

the thickness of the surface crusts. The rise in the amount of surface salts could have contributed to 

the EC reduction observed during the experiment in all the treatments, as a result of a decrease in the 

concentrations of dissolved ions. 

In terms of the possible biogeochemical rehabilitation effect, the increase of the amendment doses 

from 30 to 75 Mg/ha did not significantly modify the leachates characteristics originated by the waste 

materials. The environmental impact of the mine wastes leachates is still very high. 

 

Anions and cations concentrations 

 

The water in contact with the mine wastes promoted the oxidation of the sulfide minerals, resulting 

in the formation of acid solutions and the consequent leaching and release of high amounts of cations, 

and anions containing mainly As and S. The leachates collected from control presented a typical 

multielemental AMD composition (Figs. 2 and 3) from the IPB (taking in account both seasonal and 

mine variability) (Abreu et al., 2008, 2010; Sánchez-España et al., 2005, 2008) and the Valdarcas 

mine in the north of Portugal (Valente and Gomes, 2009). 

Total concentrations of anions and cations in leachates were not related to their total 

concentrations in the mine wastes. However, the very low concentrations of phosphates (Fig. 2) in the 

leachates collected from the control suggested a low total concentration of these ions in mine wastes 

([phosphate]total = 1.01 g PO4/kg). No significant variations in phosphate concentrations were observed 

with time in the control (Fig. 2, 1.35–17.82 mg PO4/L). 

The amendments contributed to a significant increase in the phosphate total concentrations in the 

leachates (15.23–98.25 mg PO4/L), compared to the control (1.35–17.82 mg PO4/L), at least for the 

first three sampling periods (Fig. 2). The phosphates in the amendments (Table 1) were linked to the 

organic matter and nutrient solution incorporated into the rockwool, which came from strawberry 

cultivation in greenhouses. The amendments maintained leachate phosphate levels between 69.04 

and 98.25 mg PO4/L, until the seventh month of incubation. A significant reduction of more than 63 % 

was observed in the phosphate concentration (15.23 and 30.96 mg PO4/L for 30 and 75 Mg/ha, 

respectively) after the thirteenth month. The crystallisation of Ca-containing phosphates in the

efflorescent salts and other metal phosphates in the core materials (Section 3.3) could explain this 

decrease in phosphate concentrations in the leachates.

A considerable decrease in the concentration of some elements in leachates was observed 

following treatment with amendments, in comparison with control samples leachates (Figs. 2 and 3). 

The most extreme decrease, in the first month, was observed for As, which diminished by 94 % 

followed by Fe and Pb, whose total concentrations decreased by approximately 88 and 71 %,

respectively. Sulfate and Cu concentrations decreased by around 56 %, while Al, Mn and Zn 

concentrations were reduced by 31, 30 and 25 %, respectively.  

The total concentrations of Al, As , Cu , Fe , Pb , Zn  and sulfate in the leachates from control 

samples were significantly higher than those in the leachates from amended ones in the fourth month 

of incubation (Figs. 2 and 3). In the leachates from control, the concentrations of Al, Cu, Pb, Zn and 

sulfate decreased significantly in the seventh and last months of the experiment (Figs. 2 and 3). 

Decrease of the total concentrations of Cu, Fe, Pb, Mn and Zn in the leachates was also obtained with 

fly ashes or bone meal application to pyritic sludge or soils contaminated with reddish tailings (Ciccus 

et al., 2001; Pérez-López et al., 2007; Sneddon et al., 2006). Rodríguez-Jordá et al. (2012) also 

observed a decrease of the total concentrations of Cu and Zn in the leachates from São Domingos 

mine sediments after applying sugar foam-containing amendments. However, these authors noted an 

increase in the total concentrations of As and Pb in leachates after amendments application, which are 

in contrast to the results of the present study. 

The total concentrations of As and Fe in the leachates from amended samples showed no 

significant variations with time. There was no noticeable decrease in the first month, in the 

concentrations of Ca, K and Na in these leachates when compared to control, with Na and K exhibiting 

very low concentrations in the leachates from amended samples all the time (Fig. 3). However, Ciccus 

et al. (2001) and Pérez-López et al. (2007) observed an increase in the total concentrations of Ca, K 

and Na in leachates from amended treatments. 

The concentration of Mg in the leachates from control was lower than that in the leachates from 

samples treated with 75 Mg/ha of amendments in the first month, due to the fact that the amendments 

had high total concentration of Mg (Table 2 and Fig. 3). 

With the exception of As and K, whose highest concentrations in leachates from control samples 

were found in the first and seventh months, respectively, the highest concentrations of Al, Ca, Cu, Fe, 

Mg, Mn, Na, Pb, Zn and sulfate were measured in the fourth month (Figs. 2 and 3). At the end of the 

experiment, the total concentrations of Al, As, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Zn and sulfate in the leachates from 

control matched their concentrations in the leachates from the amended samples. In opposition to the 

present work results, no regular pattern was reported by Forsberg et al. (2008) in the concentrations of 

Al, Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn in leachates from Aitik mine tailings; however, they did note a progressive 

increase in their concentrations with time. 

The total concentrations of K, Na and Pb in the leachates from control were always significantly 

higher than those in the leachates from amended samples, even at the end of the experiment (Fig. 3). 

Figures 2 and 3 show that the increasing the dose of amendments did not significantly affect the 

multielemental composition of the leachates. The variations in the leachates pH with time did not 

correlate with concentrations of anions and cations in all the treatments.

Effects of organic/inorganic amendments on trace elements dispersion by leachates from sulfide-containing tailings of the São 
Domingos mine, Portugal. Time evaluation

In general, concentrations of cations in leachates were variable and difficult to predict and explain, 

due to the complexity of solid-phase trace elements composition and concentrations, aqueous solution 

characteristics, rates of acid generation relative to neutralisation, and the possible existence of various 

physico-chemical conditions (Sullivan and Yelton, 1988). In the present work, a decrease in the 

concentrations of the hazardous chemical elements was evident with time, but Pérez-López et al. 

(2007) found an increase in Pb concentration from 3 to 35 mg/L in leachates from pyritic sludge. 

Rodríguez-Jordá et al. (2012) also observed an increase in As concentrations, with time in leachates 

from São Domingos sediments amended with sugar foam + biomass ash. Cao et al. (2003), Forsberg 

et al. (2008), Pérez-López et al. (2007) and Rodríguez-Jordá et al. (2012) reported, as in the present 

work, decreased concentrations of several chemical elements in leachates following the application of 

amendments. However, Forsberg et al. (2008) reported that adding sewage sludge to mine tailings 

from Aitik copper mine did not lead to the immobilisation of Al, Cu, Mn and Pb during all leaching 

cycles. The different results obtained with different amendments could be attributed to the elemental 

chemical composition as well as to the physico-chemical properties of the amendments and 

substratum (soils and/or mine wastes) (McBride, 2003). Systems with different chemical compositions 

promote different behaviours. 

The amendments obviously interact with the mine waste materials. For example, limestone reacts 

with the acid generating media and also organic matter. In spite of the small increase in pH of mine 

waste leachates following amendments application, interactions between the mine wastes and 

amendments can be perceived. The experiments discussed in Section 3.1 show that limestone was 

not present in the amended materials in the fourth month of incubation. On the other hand, the organic 

matter of the amendments can be oxidized, originating weak organic acids with some buffering 

capacity. The small increase in pH of the leachates from amended mine wastes, when compared to 

control, can be explained by the action of those organic acids. The organic matter can also inhibit the 

possible oxidation the sulfide minerals. Residues of crystalline organic compounds were proposed in 

the preliminary computer analysis of the X-ray diffractograms of the amended wastes, described in 

Section 3.3. The decrease of the total concentrations of As and sulfate in the leachates from amended 

samples following the addition of organic matter is not easy to explain by surface adsorption 

mechanisms, since the presence of mainly negatively charged organic molecules or ions will not 

attract the negatively charged As or S containing ions. Hydronation of organic molecules can occur at 

low pH, but As ions are also hydronated into neutral species, diminishing the possibility of surface 

adsorption. Fitz and Wenzel (2002) stated that they did not see evidence of the organic matter 

contribution to the sorption of significant amounts of As in soils. The same mechanism of hydronation 

of organic groups neutralising their negative charges or even, at very low pH, becoming positively 

charged could explain the possible lack of sorption of the positive metal ions in very acidic media. 

Besides the sorption mechanisms, ions can be immobilised by the formation of insoluble secondary 

solid phases (metal arsenates) (Abreu et al., 2009; Kabata-Pendias and Pendias, 2001; Kumpiene et 

al., 2008; Santos et al., 2012). The decrease of the total concentrations of Al, Cu, Fe, K, Mn, Na, Pb 

and Zn in the leachates from samples treated with both doses of amendments, compared to control, is 

also well explained by the crystallisation of solid phases.

Domingos mine, Portugal. Time evaluation 

192 

 

During thirteen months of incubation, the sulfide materials (Table 2) from control lost cumulatively 

in the leachates, 4.8 % of their total concentration of S and ~1.7 % of their total concentrations of As 

and Fe (Figs. 2 and 3). However, after amendments application, the fraction of these elements lost by 

leaching from the sulfide materials decreased significantly to about 2.5 % of the total concentration of 

S and less than 0.5 % for As and Fe. 

 

Mineralogical characterization 

 

The maintenance of the water-holding capacity during the experimental periodkept the core 

materials continuously wet in an acidic media, promoting the dissolution of some solid phases and the 

crystallisation of new ones with compositions different from those of the parent materials. The contact 

of the constantly moist mine waste with atmospheric oxygen promoted the oxidation of sulfide 

minerals, the decrease of the pH of the leachates, minerals dissolution, and chemical elements 

leaching. Hazardous chemical elements can be retained by the formation of secondary solid phases or 

become available depending on the composition of the leaching solutions. Hazardous chemical 

elements retention in the solid phases can be explained by the crystallisation of metal arsenates, 

phosphates and sulfates. The most soluble solids, under specific chemical and physical conditions, 

crystallise at the surface as efflorescent salts, while the less soluble solids crystallise in the core 

materials contained in the pots. However, the solubility of arsenates and phosphates strongly depends 

on pH as a result of the hydrolysis of the anions and consequent displacement of the chemical 

equilibria related to the dissolution processes. The very acidic aqueous solutions have very high 

leaching capacities and can dissolve the solid arsenates and phosphates with low solubility in almost 

neutral aqueous solutions. These solutions move to the surface by the capillarity phenomena and the 

very soluble solid phases then crystallise due to water evaporation. 

 

Efflorescent salts 

 

The formation of efflorescent soluble salts on the materials of the surface of each pot began when 

the atmospheric temperature increased and air humidity decreased, promoting dryness of the surface, 

in spite of the constant watering to meet the water-holding capacity of the materials inside the pots. 

The thickness of the surface crust was higher in the control than in the amended samples as a 

consequence of the higher ionic concentrations in the control pore aqueous solution. In all pots, the 

thickness of the surface crusts increased during the hottest months, undergoing partial re-dissolution 

during irrigation. Under similar atmospheric conditions, in the Iberian Pyrite Belt mining areas, very 

soluble crusts are formed on the surfaces of mine wastes, leaching lagoon banks and beds, and river 

beds (Abreu et al., 2010; Romero et al., 2006). However, the first rainfalls completely dissolve the 

efflorescent salts, leading to increased levels of trace elements in the mine drainage water (Abreu et 

al., 2010; Álvarez-Valero et al., 2007; Nieto et al., 2007; Sánchez-España, 2008; Sánchez-España et 

al., 2005).

Different efflorescent salts were identified depending on the pH and other ionic composition of the 

crystallisation medium, presence or absence of organic matter, and the duration of contact between 

the water and solid phases. Air temperature and humidity can also influence the composition of the 

efflorescent solid phases.  

After one month of incubation, the efflorescent salts of the control were identified as the secondary 

new phases aluminium sulfates (Al2(SO4)3•16-17H2O), aluminocopiapite 

((Al2/3x,Fe1?x
2+

,V1/3x)(Alx,Fe1?x
3+

)4(SO4)6(OH)2•20H2O) and aluminocoquimbite ((Alx,Fe1-x)2(SO4)3•9H2O) 

with different degrees of substitution of Al in the Fe positions (Fig. 4). The data presented in Table 4, 

obtained from the dissolution of the efflorescent salts, show that these solid phases must contain 

mainly Al and Fe. Some of the other chemical elements presented in the Table 4 can be in the lattice 

of the reported solid phases in trace amounts. Other solid phases must also be present but their tiny 

amounts did not allow their identification by X-ray diffraction.

Fig. 5 X-ray diffractograms of two samples (A and B) of the surface efflorescent salts identified in control collected 

after thirteen months of incubation. 

After thirteen months of incubation, a higher diversity of soluble sulfates was identified among other 

solids (quartz, weilite (CaHAsO4), metal sulfides, etc.) (Fig.5). The existence of high total 

concentrations of  S, Al and Fe ions in the mine waste materials (Table 2) produced sulfates with 

different chemical composition and structure, such as aluminium sulfate (Al2(SO4)3), meta-alunogen 

(Al2(SO4)3•12H2O), tamarugite (NaAl(SO4)2•6H2O), coquimbite (Fe2(SO4)3•9H2O), several solid phases 

or solid solutions (with different degrees of metal ions substitution) of the copiapite-group 

[aluminocopiapite, copiapite (Fe

(SO4)6(OH)2•20H2O), ferricopiapite 

((Fe2/3x

rozenite (Fe

SO4•4H2O) and probably poitevinite ((Cu,Fe

)SO4•H2O) (Fig. 5). The slight increase of 

the concentration of several ions in the aqueous solutions, obtained from the dissolution of the 

efflorescent salts, in relation to the values obtained after one month of incubation (Table 4) explains 

the variety of the solid solutions identified by XRD. On the other hand, the changes in the

196 

 

environmental humidity and temperature during the elapsed time of the experiment (13 months) justify 

the existence of solid phases with similar composition but different degrees of hydration. Some of 

these minerals, e.g., coquimbite, aluminocopiapite, ferricopiapite, rozenite and poitevinite, were also 

reported in mine wastes from São Domingos (Abreu et al., 2010; Álvarez-Valero et al., 2007; 

Sánchez-España, 2008), other IPB mines and the Valdarcas mine (Romero et al., 2006; Sánchez-

España, 2008; Sánchez-España et al., 2005; Valente and Gomes, 2009). Copiapite-group minerals 

are common in the extremely acid environments of sulfide mine areas, where associations with iron 

sulfates such as melanterite and coquimbite are frequent (Jamison et al., 2005a; Romero et al., 2006). 

The pH values of the waste materials in the control (Table 3) in the first and thirteenth months, 

coupled with the pH values of the leachates collected from control (Fig. 1), indicate that all the solid 

phases crystallised on the materials of the surface of the control samples are stable under extremely 

acidic conditions (pH &amp;lt;1.5), as the abovementioned field data also corroborate (Abreu et al., 2010). 

The pH of the pore waters at the surface of the materials in the control decreased as the superficial 

water evaporated, increasing the concentrations of the dissolved ions and promoting the crystallisation 

of very soluble salts. 

In the efflorescent secondary salts following amendments treatments (30 and 75 Mg/ha) after one 

month of incubation, mainly aluminium-, copper- and iron-containing sulfates, such as alum-K 

(KAl(SO4)2•12H2O), alunogen (Al2(SO4)3•17H2O), beaverite (Pb(Cu
2+

,Fe
3+

)3(SO4)2(OH,H2O)6), 

halotrichite (Fe
2+

Al2(SO4)4•22H2O), linarite (Cu
2+

Pb(SO4)(OH)2) and melanterite (Fe
2+

SO4•7H2O), were 

identified (Fig. 6). The chemical composition of the minerals agrees with the data presented in Table4. 

After thirteen months of incubation, arsenate, oxalate, phosphate and sulfate minerals were 

identified in the efflorescent salts crystallising on the amended materials (Fig. 7): several minerals 

from the alunite-jarosite-group [beaverite, beudantite (Pb(Fe
3+

)3(AsO4)(SO4)(OH)6), corkite 

(Pb(Fe
3+

)3(PO4)(SO4)(OH)6), (hydronium-, natro-) jarosite (H3O,K,Na)(Fe

plumbojarosite (Pb(Fe
3+

)6(SO4)4(OH)12), chenite (Cu

Pb4(SO4)2(OH)6)], epsomite (MgSO4•7H2O), 

gypsum (CaSO4•2H2O), humboldtine (Fe
2+

C2O4•2H2O), moolooite (Cu
2+

C2O4•nH2O (0 &amp;lt;n &amp;lt;1)) and 

weilite (Ca(HAsO4)). Once more, the chemical composition of the minerals agrees with the data 

presented in Table 4. The existence of solid phases containing sulfates was confirmed by infrared 

(Moenke, 1962; Mindat, 2013), as shown in the spectra of figure 8. 

Alunogen, alunite-jarosite-group minerals, epsomite, gypsum and melanterite were also reported in 

Valdarcas, São Domingos and other mine areas from IPB at sites with pH &gt; 1.5 (Abreu et al., 2010; 

Álvarez-Valero et al., 2008; Matos and Martins, 2006; Rosado et al., 2008; Romero et al., 2006; 

Sánchez-España, 2008; Sánchez-España et al., 2005; Valente and Gomes, 2009). Halotrichite was 

reported in the mining areas and river banks with pH values of 1.5 to 2.5 (Sánchez-España, 2008; 

Sánchez-España et al., 2005; Valente and Gomes, 2009). Gypsum is found in the referred mines 

often associated with copiapite and jarosite. Jamison et al. (2005b) observed that jarosite was 

frequently found in mine wastes environments with pH &gt; 2, but not in mine areas with pH &amp;lt;1.

Fig. 6 X-ray diffractograms of two samples (A and B) of the surface efflorescent salts identified in amended 

materials collected after one month of incubation. 

The organic matter included in the amendments can retain more water and allow the formation of 

more hydrated phases than the meta-alunogen and rozenite identified in the efflorescent salts from 

control. This is due to the increase in water activity, which consequently raises the pH. The pH of the 

leachates collected from amended samples was higher (2.0 &amp;lt;pH &amp;lt;2.5) than that of the leachates 

from control (Fig. 1). 

The stability field diagram of melanterite (Knoll et al., 2005) shows that this solid phase can be 

associated with minerals of the alunite-jarosite group, which are stable phases at a pH between 1.5 

and 4 (Knoll et al., 2005), as well as with minerals of the copiapite-group, which only exist at a pH&lt;1.5. 

Humboldtine and moolooite can be formed by the reaction of metal ions with the oxalic acid 

produced by the fungi that grew in the organic amendments during the present experimental assay. 

Gadd (1999) analysed the biogeochemical importance of the sparingly soluble iron and copper 

oxalates produced by fungi.

Solid phases in the pots’ core materials  

 

In general, the same secondary solid phases were identified in materials from both depths 

(superficial: 0–5 cm; pot’s core: ? 10 cm), and from control and amended samples (30 and 75 Mg/ha) 

(Figs. 9 and 10), which had a similar composition to that of the efflorescent salts from amended 

samples (Figs. 4?7). Several solid phases or solid solutions (with different degrees of metal ions 

substitution) belonging to the alunite-jarosite-group [beaverite, beudantite, (hydronium-, natro-, 

plumbo-) jarosite and segnitite (Pb(Fe
3+

)3H(AsO4)2(OH)6)] were the most common both in control and 

amended samples. Belonging to the alunite-jarosite-group, it is probable that philipsbornite 

(PbAl3H(AsO4)2(OH)6) crystallises in the control (Fig. 9), and corkite in the amended samples (Fig. 10). 

In addition to the abovementioned solid phases, it is highly likely that arsenbrackebuschite

(Pb2(Fe

,Zn)(AsO4)(HAsO4)(OH)), berlinite (AlPO4) and the minerals of the apatite-group [hedyphane 

(Ca2Pb3(AsO4)3Cl) and mimetite (Pb5(AsO4)3(OH)] crystallised in the core of the amended samples 

(Fig. 10). The pH values of the waste materials (Table 3) and the leachates during the thirteen months 

of incubation (Fig. 1) indicate that all the core solid phases were under conditions (pH &gt; 1.5) that 

promoted the crystallisation of the observed solid phases. The wastes in the pots core were kept 

moistened (water-holding capacity), but were not waterlogged during the time span of the experiment. 

This allows the creation of very localised microsystems with very specific and different environments 

(e.g., moist content and oxidation-reduction potential) generated by the pore system (different pore 

sizes), creating a diversity of chemical conditions (pH, aqueous ionic concentrations, water activity) 

that can produce multiple solid phases stable under each particular condition.

A global analysis of the results shows that the minerals of the alunite-jarosite-group were the stable 

solid phases under the physical and chemical experimental environments used. The presence of 

these minerals, both in the core materials and as efflorescent salts on the amended wastes, means 

that they are moderately soluble, since the solutions that rise to the surface by capillarity can generate 

the same solid phases. However, the significant retention of trace elements in solid phases (Tables 4 

and 5) and therefore the decrease of their concentration in leachates (Figs. 2 and 3) can be explained 

by the formation of these stable solid phases, under these experimental conditions.

Domingos mine, Portugal. Time evaluation

The amount of trace elements leached in each sampling period is not enough to explain the sharp 

decrease in elemental concentrations in the leachate samples collected in the thirteen month. 

Although iron oxides occur usually in mines after sulfide oxidation (Abreu et al., 2010; Rosado et 

al., 2008; Sánchez-España, 2008; Sánchez-España et al., 2005; Valente and Gomes, 2009), no iron 

oxides were identified due to the low pH of the waste materials. The abovementioned identified solid 

phases, as for instance melanterite and jarosite, show that the iron was in the structure of those solids. 

 

CONCLUSIONS 

 

The waste dumps containing sulfides displayed very low pH and a large capacity to leach chemical 

elements due to the continuous generation of acid mine drainage, and their large multielemental 

concentrations.  

The amendments had very low pH buffer capacity in relation to the acid generated by the mine 

wastes. They were efficient in decreasing the elemental concentrations in leachates, compared to 

control, but only for a short period. However, during the thirteen months, the leached fraction of As, Fe 

and S from the amended sulfide materials were significantly decreased when compared to the control. 

The organic materials from the amendments improved the materials structure, increasing water 

retention and preventing excessive dryness with the appearance of local very high acidic conditions 

(pH &amp;lt;1). 

Low concentrations of trace elements in leachates from all treatments after thirteen months could 

be due to the presence, mainly in the core materials, of several solid phases with moderate solubility. 

Melanterite can be associated with copiapite-group minerals and also with alunite-jarosite-group 

minerals. Nevertheless, the higher solubility of the minerals of the copiapite-group than those of the 

alunite-jarosite-group means that the former solid phases crystallise from more concentrated solutions 

with lower pH and lower water activity. For a pH lower than 1.5, it is very likely that rozenite is a more 

stable solid phase than melanterite, which contains more crystallisation water molecules. 

The presence of copiapite-group minerals in the efflorescent salts of control samples indicates the 

existence of more extreme conditions (pH &amp;lt;1.5, high elemental concentrations and low water activity) 

compared to the other situations (control core materials, and efflorescent salts and core materials in 

amended wastes) where the alunite-jarosite-group minerals were identified. Despite the moderate 

solubility of the alunite-jarosite-group minerals, their crystallisation, together with arsenbrackebuschite, 

berlinite and the apatite-group minerals hedyphane and mimetite-(OH), can be used to explain the 

sharp decrease in the concentrations of the studied trace elements in the leachates collected in the 

thirteen month of incubation. A deep analysis of the final values attained after this time, combined with 

the leachates pH, illustrated that the crystallisation of these solid phases was not suitable for 

environmental remediation, due to the high elemental concentrations still present in the leachates. On 

the other hand, the stability of jarosite in the pH range between ~ 1.5 and ~ 4.5 confirms the previous 

conclusion that this solid phase, as well as the majority of the minerals of the alunite-jarosite-group, 

are not suitable for chemical elements immobilization, as they will change to different solid phases 

when the pH increases.

The amendments improved, in general, the chemical characteristics of the mine wastes. The dose 

of the amendments did not influence leachates characteristics during the entire experiment. Other 

organic and inorganic wastes, as well as their rate of application, should be studied over a longer time 

span in order to reduce AMD generation and chemical elements leaching and spread from sulfide 

mine wastes.

ABSTRACT 

 

São Domingos mine area (Portuguese Iberian Pyrite Belt) contains several mine wastes with different 

environmental hazard which are disposed irregularly over a large area. This study aimed to evaluate: 

i) soil enzymatic activities, chemical quality of leachates and Cistus ladanifer germination in 

Technosols composed of gossan or sulfide wastes from the mine and amendment mixtures (organic 

and inorganic); ii) the efficiency of a layer of gossan over sulfide wastes to improve rehabilitation of the 

more hazardous waste. 

Technosols were composed of gossan or sulfide wastes and amendment mixtures, at 12 and 30 g/kg, 

containing organic/inorganic wastes from agriculture and distilleries in equal proportion. Three 

microcosm assays, under controlled conditions, were carried out: Gossan/sulfide wastes and 

respective Technosols (assays 1-2); (assay 3) Sulfide wastes, with/without amendments, incubated 

during four months and then with an application of a thin overlayer of gossan with/without the same 

amendments. Cistus ladanifer was sown in half of the pots from each treatment while the remainder 

was left bare. After three and nine months of incubation, composite samples of the materials were 

collected and dehydrogenase, acid phosphatase and ?-glucosidase activities were determined. In 

same sampling periods, percolation leachates were analysed for anions and cations concentrations, 

pH and electrical conductivity.  

Technosols with gossan wastes were significantly different (p &amp;lt;0.05) due to higher dehydrogenase 

and ?-glucosidase activities, better seedling growth and improved chemical characteristics of 

leachates. Although electrical conductivity and concentrations of some elements (e.g. As and SO4) in 

leachates from Technosols with sulfide wastes were reduced (&gt;50 % of Electrical conductivity and 23–

99 % depending on element, Technosol and sampling period), the amendments did not prevent sulfide 

oxidation and acid generation, improve enzymatic activities or allow seed germination. Higher 

elements concentrations in leachates were obtained with the overlapping of two Technosols or mine 

wastes, compared to the leachates from assays with a single mine waste. Application of a 

gossan/Technosol layer over sulfide wastes allowed C. ladanifer germination but plants died after ?50 

days. 

The use of Technosols derived from gossan or sulfide wastes may be an efficient solution for 

rehabilitation of these mine wastes. However, the results with sulfide wastes were not encouraging. 

The use of a Technosol obtained from gossan wastes seems be a promising approach to isolate 

sulfide wastes from air and initiate their revegetation, but this technology requires further 

improvements, namely to prevent the ascension of salts by capillarity.

INTRODUCTION 

 

Different wastes were produced by mining activities in São Domingos (Portuguese Iberian Pyrite 

Belt) and disposed over a large area affecting around 3.2 x 10
6
 m

2
 of land (Álvarez-Valero et al., 2008; 

Matos and Martins, 2006; Quental et al., 2002). Each mine waste poses different risks associated to 

its chemical composition and total concentrations of hazardous elements (Álvarez-Valero et al., 2008). 

Although this evaluation is important, real environmental impacts of mine wastes are related to the 

available fraction of the elements and mass/volume of the heaps (Pérez-López et al., 2008). This is 

because only elements in aqueous solution or in easily exchangeable positions in soils or wastes are 

directly available to soil organisms (Adriano, 2001). Taken into account the mobility of trace elements 

and the mass/volume of the heaps, gossan and brittle pyrite wastes represent the fourth and fifth, 

respectively, most hazardous mine wastes in the São Domingos mine area (Pérez-López et al., 2008). 

To speed up ecological rehabilitation of these wastes, a combined strategy using different organic 

and inorganic amendments and mine wastes can be used to create specific Technosols (Macías, 

2004; Macías et al., 2011). The mail goal of these Technosols should be to improve the characteristics 

of mine wastes: chemical (e.g. increase in nutrients and organic matter and reduction of acid drainage 

and availability of hazardous elements), physical (e.g. substrata structure) and biological (enhanced 

plant cover and activity of soil microorganisms to promote elements cycling processes). Moreover, the 

development of a plant cover, namely of Cistus ladanifer L., can stimulate ecosystem functions of 

Technosols containing gossan wastes (Santos et al., 2014a).Cistus ladanifer is a pioneer species that 

grows spontaneously in several mine areas in the Iberian Pyrite Belt due to it efficient mechanisms of 

tolerance (Alvarenga et al., 2004; Batista et al., 2007; Freitas et al., 2004; Santos et al., 2009, 2012, 

2013a, 2014b). 

In general, soil quality depends on several physical, chemical, biological and biochemical 

properties (Kumar et al., 2013). Soil enzyme activities are very sensitive with a fast response to 

induced changes during degradation/contamination and ecological rehabilitation (Karlen et al., 1997; 

Santos et al., 2013b, 2014a; de Varennes et al., 2010a). Determination of different soil enzymatic 

activities can also indicate potential variation in microbial diversity. However, few studies are available 

on the dynamics of enzymatic activities in mine wastes or soils developed on mine wastes, 

with/without amendments, for long periods of monitoring (Burgos et al., 2010; Santos et al., 2014a).  

This study aimed to evaluate: i) soil enzymatic activities, chemical quality of leachates and Cistus 

ladanifer germination in Technosols composed of gossan or sulfide wastes from São Domigos mine 

and amendment mixtures (organic and inorganic); ii) the efficiency of a layer of gossan over sulfide 

wastes (with/without amendments) to improve rehabilitation of the more hazardous waste. We 

hypothesized that the conception of Technosols with amendments mixtures and mine wastes would 

increase enzymatic activities related to biogeochemical cycles and improve the chemical quality of 

leachates in order to decrease the dispersion of elements and allow the development of pioneer 

vegetation. Moreover, the overlapping of Technosolos would isolate sulfide wastes from air/water what 

would promote the plant cover and, consequently, reduce leaching of chemical elements.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Experiment set-up 

 

Composite samples of two mining wastes, which are composed of gossan materials mixed with 

host rocks (hereinafter named as gossan wastes ? GW) and crushed pyrite and smelting ashes 

(herein after named as sulfide wastes ? SW), and Cistus ladanifer seeds were collected in the São 

Domingos mine area in 2009. Sampling area for GW was located near the open pit and for SW was 

south-west of the open pit, near the former leaching tanks. These mine wastes were chosen due to 

the large amounts of trace elements present and consequent potential environmental risks, wide 

distribution in the mine area (Álvarez-Valero et al., 2008; Pérez-López et al., 2008; Quental et al., 

2002) and level of plant colonization. The SW are bare and exposed to severe water erosion while 

GW are naturally colonized by autochthonous plants. The chemical characteristics of the mine wastes 

are given in Table 1. 

The Technosols (Table 2) were composed of GW or SW and an amendment mixture containing 

organic/inorganic wastes (equal proportion of each residue) from agriculture (plant remains + 

strawberry substrate at 2:3 m/m – AgW; and rockwool used for strawberry crops – RW) and residues 

from distilleries (Arbutus unedo L. and Ceratonia siliqua L. fruit spirits distillation – AW, CW, 

respectively). Three amendment mixtures were tested (AgW + AW + RW; AgW + CW + RW; and AgW 

+ AW +CW + RW) at two application rates (12 and 30 g/kg of mine waste). Residues from a quarry 

(limestone rock wastes – LRW) were only added, at 22 g/kg, to SW to increase pH to similar values as 

that of GW. These organic and inorganic wastes were used due to their physical and chemical 

characteristics (Table 1) and because they are easily available in the vicinity of the mine at a very low 

cost. 

The mine wastes and amendments were air-dried, mixed manually and put in pots. Three 

microcosm assays were carried out: (Assay 1) GW (fraction &amp;lt;10 mm) with/without amendments 

(seven treatments: one control and six Technosols) with three replicates each, 2 kg of GW per pot; 

(Assay 2) SW (total fraction) with/without amendments (seven treatments: one control and six 

Technosols) with four replicates each, 2 kg of SW per pot; (Assay 3) Sulfide wastes, with/without 

amendments, incubated during four months and then with application of an overlayer of gossan (?4 

cm thick) with/without the same amendments (seven treatments: one control and six Technosols) with 

four replicates each, 2 kg of GW and 4 kg of SW per pot. To evaluate the efficiency of the application 

of an overlayer of gossan, GW or SW with amendments (Technosols) were used as positive controls 

while GW or SW acted as negative controls.  

Cistus ladanifer was sown (0.5 g seeds per pot) in half of the pots from each treatment, while the 

other pots remained bare. The seeds were pre-treated for optimal germination (heating at 100 °C for 

30 min; Corral et al., 1990). All treatments were kept at 70 % of the maximum water-holding capacity 

under controlled conditions in a greenhouse and monitored for nine months (July-April).

Experimental monitoring and sample analyses 

 

At the beginning and after three and nine months (end of the experiment), composite samples of 

the materials from each pot were collected (assays 1 and 2: &amp;lt;3 cm of depth; assay 3: &amp;lt;3 cm (gossan 

materials) and 5?7 cm of depth (sulfide materials). These materials were homogenised, sieved (&amp;lt;2 

mm) and kept fresh (4 ºC) until soil enzymatic analysis. 

Three enzymatic activities were analysed as biological parameters to evaluate the rehabilitation 

process: dehydrogenase (Tabatabai, 1994), ?-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21; Eivazi and Tabatabai, 1988) 

and acid phosphomonoesterase (acid phosphatase EC 3.1.3.2; Eivazi and Tabatabai, 1977). 

Dehydrogenase was used as an indicator of overall microbial activity while other enzymatic activities 

are related to C and P cycling. 

In the same sampling periods, percolation leachates were obtained by irrigation of the materials 

(without plants) with a volume of deionised water that ensured an excess of 10 % of each pot’s 

maximum water holding capacity, and left to percolate for 24 h. The leachates were vacuum filtrated (&amp;lt;

0.45 µm), and pH and electrical conductivity (EC) measured. The filtrate was kept at –18 ºC until 

analysis. In the leachates, the concentrations of Al, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Pb and Zn were 

analysed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry; As by graphite furnace atomic absorption 

spectrometry; chlorides, nitrates and sulfates by ion chromatography; and phosphates by visible 

spectrophotometry using the molybdenum blue method (USEPA, 1979).  

 

Data analysis 

 

Data were analysed by one way ANOVA and the Duncan test (p &amp;lt;0.05) used to separate means, 

using the statistical programme SPSS v18.0 for Windows. Data not satisfying assumptions for ANOVA 

were analysed non-parametrically using Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA by a rank test. For statistical 

purposes, the results below the detection limit were assumed as half of the detection limit. Bivariate 

Pearson correlations were used to correlate leachates characteristics and soil enzymatic activities 

(strong correlation: r&gt; 0.95; moderate correlation: 0.65 &amp;lt;r &amp;lt;0.95). Quality control of the analyses was 

made by analytical replicate samples, use of certified standards solutions and laboratory standards at 

an international accredited laboratory (multielemental concentration of mine and organic/inorganic 

wastes).  

 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Gossan wastes 

 

Chemical characterization of leachates 

 

The amendments increased pH of GW leachates by more than one unit (4.5–5.6, except for 

Technosols containing A. unedo fruit spirit distillation (GA12 and GA30) and both fruits spirits 

distillation and amendment mixture applied at 12 g/kg (GAC12) where pH was close to 4.5 in the first

sampling) compared to the control (3.6 &amp;lt;GW &amp;lt;4.0; Fig. 1), with no significant differences between the 

three sampling dates. Similar results of pH were obtained in leachates (simulated and percolated) 

from contaminated soils and sediments amended with other organic/inorganic wastes (Hodson et al., 

2001; Rodríguez-Jordá et al., 2012) as well as soils developed on gossan wastes amended with 

hydrophilic polyacrylate polymers (Santos et al., 2013b).

In the beginning of the experiment, leachates from all Technosols had electrical conductivities 

significantly higher than control (Fig. 1), but later on this only occurred in leachates from Technosols 

receiving a high dose of amendment (mS/cm; 1st sampling – GW: 0.4, GA30: 0.9, GC30: 0.8; 2nd

Chemical quality of leachates and enzimatic activities in Technosols with gossan and sulfide wastes from the São Domingos 
mine 

217 

 

considered as small.Although GW had large total concentrations of some elements (e.g. Al, As, Cu 

and Pb, Table 1), their concentrations in leachates, and thus potentially available for soil organisms 

(namely those involved in biogeochemical cycles), were small in GW with or without amendment 

application representing a low potential environmental risk (Table 3 and Fig. 2). Significant decreases 

(p &amp;lt;0.05) in the concentrations of elements (except As) in leachates occurred in the two sampling 

dates. In leachates from contaminated sediments from São Domingos amended with sugar foam, 

ashes from combustion of biomass and red gypsum, Rodríguez-Jordá et al. (2012) also reported a 

two-phase time-dependent behaviour for the concentrations of Cu, Pb and Zn, with an initial decrease 

(until ?20 days) and then a steady state. For As, a progressive increase in the concentration occurred 

during the experiment, independently of the treatment (Table 3). 

In Technosols, especially those containing an amendment mixture at 12g/kg and containing A. 

unedo fruit spirit distillation (GA12) and different amendment mixtures at 30 g/kg (GA30, GC30 and 

GAC30), there was a significant increase in the concentrations of the elements in leachates (between 

1.5 and 11-fold depending on the element), compared to control (Table 3 and Fig. 2). However, no 

clear tendency was verified according to the type of amendment, element and sampling period. 

Increases in the concentrations of As, Na and phosphate in simulated leachates was also reported in 

soils developed on gossan wastes but amended with hydrophilic polyacrylate polymers (Santos et al., 

2013b).Depending on characteristics of amendments and mine wastes, the concentrations of 

elements in leachates can vary with time due to different chemical and mineralogical reactions. In 

Technosols, the high concentrations of chlorides and nutrients were related to nutrient solution used in 

strawberry cultivation, which was incorporated in rockwool (Table 1). This increase in nutrients can be 

considered an advantage for the phytostabilization process, namely with C. ladanifer, as reported by 

Santos et al. (2014a).  

Comparing the elements in control and Technosols, two groups of elements that constituted 

exceptions were observed: As and Fe, and Al, Cu, Pb and nitrates (Table 3 and Fig. 2). In the first 

sampling, similar concentrations of As and Fe among leachates were obtained, usually lower than 25 

µg As/L and 0.62 mg Fe/L. However, at the beginning and at the end of the experiment, As 

concentrations in leachates from Technosols with rate application of 30 g/kg and containing residue 

from liquor distillation of C. siliqua fruit (GC30: 1.40 and 76.6 µg As/L, respectively) and both residues 

from liquors distillation (GAC30: 7.59 and 51.8 µg As/L, respectively) were significantly higher than 

control (0.73 and 9.3 µg As/L, respectively). The type of organic matter derived from residue of liquor 

distillation of C. siliqua fruit and its content in these Technosols can play an important role in As 

mobility (Kumpiene et al., 2008). Moreover, the increase of low-molecular-weight organic acids 

following amendment application can release As from Fe–, Mn– and Al–oxides or hydroxides in 

contaminated soils (Zang et al., 2005). In fact, soils developed on mine wastes from São Domingos 

mine area can present a considerable fraction of As associated to Fe–oxides and organic matter (6–

27 % and 1–34 % of total As concentrations, respectively) (Abreu et al., 2012; Santos et al., 2012). 

The inhibition of the formation of metal arsenates, that naturally occur in gossan wastes (Santos et al., 

2012), may be another factor explaining the As increase in leachates.

Chemical quality of leachates and enzimatic activities in Technosols with gossan and sulfide wastes from the São Domingos 
mine

Amendment application (for some elements and except GA12) significantly reduced the 

concentrations of Al (&gt; 36 %), Cu (GA12 &gt; 16 % but for other treatments&gt; 64 %), Pb (&gt; 52 %), Fe 

(only GA30, GC12 and GAC30, ? 60 %) and nitrates (&gt; 71 % ) compared to control (1.8–3.0 mg Al/L, 

0.4–0.5 mg Cu/L, 0.3–0.5 mg Pb/L, 0.2 mg Fe/L and 45.3 mg NO3/L). These reductions seem to be 

related to the increase of pH of leachates (-0.65 &amp;lt;r &amp;lt;-0.85). However, the application of organic 

matter can also promote the formation of complexes with cations and increase cationic exchange 

capacity (Adriano et al. 2004). According to Hodson et al. (2001), the immobilization of some metals 

(e.g. Pb) after addition of phosphate ions to contaminated soils can be related to the formation of 

metal phosphates with low solubility. The same was also reported by Santos et al. (2014c) in another 

type of mine wastes and using similar amendments. As the amendments used were a significant 

source of phosphates, this fact could also occur in GW. Moreover, small availability of As, Pb and Fe 

can be related to their presence in other solid phases presenting low solubility (Santos et al., 2012).   

 

Cistus ladanifer germination and enzymatic activities 

 

Germination and growth of C. ladanifer seedlings was stimulated in Technosols, compared to GW. 

Two months after sowing, a great variability in plant height was observed but, in general, the 

amendments provided nutrients which may explain the higher plant height. Thus, plants growing in 

Technosols had a height of 2–4 cm while in control they only had 1–1.5 cm. Nevertheless, no visible 

symptoms of deficiency or toxicity were observed in all seedlings. According to several authors (de 

Varennes et al., 2010a; Qu and de Varennes, 2010; Santos et al., 2014a), the improvement in the 

structure and water-holding capacity of soils developed on gossan wastes or even gossan wastes, by 

application of organic and inorganic wastes, are important factors that stimulate germination and 

growth of plants (e.g. C. ladanifer, Spercularia purpurea (Persoon) G. Don fil., Briza maxima L. and 

Chaetopogon fasciculatus (Link) Hayek). Moreover, the improvement in the fertility of these materials 

leads to higher plant biomass accumulation (de Varennes et al., 2010a,b; Qu and de Varennes, 2010; 

Santos et al., 2014a). 

Enzymatic activities (Figs. 3 and 4) were used as biological indicators to assess the efficiency of 

the Technosols containing GW. General activity of microorganisms, evaluated by dehydrogenase 

activity, was stimulated in Technosols (1.66–20.20 µg TPF g
-1

 16h
-1

) compared to control (0.72–1.79 

µg TPF g
-1

 16h
-1

) (Fig. 3). The same tendency was observed in the ?-glucosidase activity (µmol ?-

nitrophenol g?¹ h?¹ – Technosols: 0.04–0.20, Control: 0.03–0.04; Fig. 5) but not in the acid 

phosphatase activity (µmol ?-nitrophenol g?¹ h?¹ –Techonosols: 0.51–0.83, Control: 0.64–0.76; Fig. 4). 

The influence of organic matter on soil biological properties can vary with content, type, and dominant 

component of added organic materials (Tejada et al., 2006). However, in this assay, specially 

Technosols receiving a high dose of amendment mixture had higher (p &amp;lt;0.05) dehydrogenase and ?-

glucosidase activities during the experiment (3.45–20.20 µg TPF g
-1

 16h
-1

 and 0.13–0.20 µmol ?-

nitrophenol g?¹ h?¹, depending on Technosol and sampling date) than the control (Figs. 3 and 4). 

According to Santos et al. (2014a) and de Varennes et al. (2010b), the significant increase of organic 

C by the application of high doses of amendment mixtures in GW or soils developed on gossan

wastes has a positive effect on dehydrogenase and ?-glucosidase activities. This stimulation was also 

reported for acid phosphatase activity in soils developed on gossan (de Varennes et al., 2010b) in 

contrast to the results obtained in this study. Stimulation of dehydrogenase and ?-glucosidase 

activities was also verified with addition of several organic and inorganic amendments to contaminated 

soils from other mine areas (Burgos et al., 2010; Pérez de Mora et al., 2005). 

Although some authors (Burgos et al., 2010; Santos et al., 2014a) reported a correlation between 

pH of materials and enzymatic activities, no correlations were observed between pH or the 

concentration of elements in leachates and enzymatic activities in the present experiment.  

The dehydrogenase activities of GW, GA12, GC30, GAC12 and GAC30 had an initial increase and 

then a decrease. Although in other treatments the same tendency was observed, the variations were 

not statistically significant due to the variability of the results. This suggests that amendments had a 

short lived impact on soil microorganisms.

Sulfide wastes 

Chemical characterization of leachates 

 

As expected, leachates from SW were more acidic (pH: 1.1–1.6; Fig. 1) and had higher (p &amp;lt;0.05) 

electrical conductivity (more than 25-fold, 11.1–53.6 mS/cm; Fig. 1) and concentrations of elements 

(Table 4 and Fig. 5) than GW (Table 3 and Fig. 2). This fact is related to the high amount of sulfide 

minerals included in SW that contribute to the continuous formation of acid leachates and consequent 

release of chemical elements. Although different values of pH and electrical conductivity were 

obtained in the leachates from pyritic sludge (Pérez-López et al., 2007a,b; pH ? 2; EC: 2.5–4 mS/cm), 

in general, the concentration of chemical elements in SW leachates were in the same range as those 

reported for acid mine drainage in the IPB (Abreu et al., 2010; de la Torre et al., 2011; Ferreira da 

Silva et al., 2009; Sanchez-España et al., 2005, 2008). 

The amendments increased significantly the pH of leachates (2.0–2.4), although these continued 

acidic, and reduced EC between 57 and 71 % compared to control (SW: 11.1–53.6 mS/cm) (Fig. 1). 

During the initial incubation (four months), the acidic nature of SW and the fine grain of the limestone 

rock wastes should promote a rapid dissolution of carbonates, but the other organic and inorganic 

wastes used had small buffering capacity so their application did not neutralize the leachates. 

A slight increase in the pH of leachates (up to pH of 2.9) and reduction of electrical conductivity 

(more than 50 %) was also observed with the application of different doses of pig manure to acidic 

mine soils during 21 weeks (Garcés et al., 2008). However, mixture of fly ashes (waste with very high 

acid buffering capacity) with pyritic sludge mine was more effective in the improvement of pH and 

electrical conductivity of leachates between 4 and 7 months of incubation (pH from 2 to ?7.5; EC from 

2.5–4 to ?0.5 mS/cm; Pérez-López et al., 2007a,b). Nonetheless, Herbert and Höckert (2009) also 

reported an increase of pH in leachates from waste rock from the Ljusnarsberg mine, which is 

composed of different sulfides, amended with paper mill sludge and activated sewage sludge between 

120 and 400 days (from ?3.5 to 6–7). 

In general, concentrations of elements in leachates from all treatments were high at the beginning 

of the experiment and decreased over time (Table 4 and Fig. 5), with the same tendency as electrical 

conductivity. A similar behaviour was observed in leachates from pyritic sludge collected in São 

Domingos and waste rock from the Ljusnarsberg mine amended or not with different wastes (Herbert 

and Höckert, 2009; Pérez-López et al., 2007a,b). The intense formation of surface salts, namely 

metal-sulfates and Ca-phosphates, can explain the decrease in the concentrations of dissolved ions 

during the experiment (Santos et al., 2014c). Concentrations of K and Na from Technosols remained 

low during the experiment (Fig. 5) while leachates from control and Technosols with application rate at 

12 and 30 g/kg and containing residue from the liquor distillation of A. unedo fruit (SA12 and SA30) 

collected in the first sampling date had a significant increase of phosphate (more than 10-fold; Table 

4) compared to the beginning of the experiment.  

In the beginning of the experiment Technosols, independently of application dose and type of 

amendments, leached lower amounts of elements (except Mg and phosphate) than control (Table 4 

and Fig. 5). However, this trend was not maintained for all chemical elements. Thus, during the 



Chemical quality of leachates and enzimatic activities in Technosols with gossan and sulfide wastes from the São Domingos 
mine 

224 

 

experiment, in leachates from all Technosols the concentrations of K, Na and Pb were reduced 

significantly by more than 85 % and that of sulfates at the end of experiment by 23–48 %, compared to 

control (1.4–1.8 mg K/L, 7.6–20.7 mg Na/L, 2.0–2.3 mg Pb/L, 5.9 g SO4/L). Moreover, high application 

rates of amendment mixtures still led to a significant reduction of As (31–83 % depending on sampling 

period) and Fe (50–62 % at the end of the experiment) compared to control (9.3–14.5 mg As/L and 1.0 

g Fe/L). The increase of cation exchange capacity, due to organic matter, can lead to the reduction of 

Pb, K and Na in solution. However, Garcés et al. (2008) reported a negative correlation between Pb 

concentration and dissolved organic carbon in leachates after application of pig manure to acidic mine 

soils. The decrease in the concentrations of elements can be also explained by the crystallisation of 

solid phases from alunite–jarosite-group and apatite–group as well as arsenbrackebuschite 

(Pb2Fe
3+

(AsO4)2(OH)) (Santos et al., 2014c). 

Several authors (Herbert and Höckert, 2009; Pérez-López et al., 2007a,b; Sneddon et al., 2006) 

reported the reduction of the concentrations of several elements in leachates (e.g. As, Cu, Fe, Pb, Mn 

and Zn) following amendment application. However, Herbert and Höckert (2009) and Pérez-López et 

al. (2007b) referred that the application of some amendments (e.g. sewage sludge, fly ashes or paper 

mill waste + biosludge) to wastes containing sulfides did not lead to the immobilisation of some 

elements (e.g. Ca, K and Na) in leachates. 

Technosols, independently of application dose and amendment type, leached higher (p &amp;lt;0.05) 

amounts of Ca, Cu, Mg, Mn, Zn and phosphate (310–709 mg Ca/L, 56.9–265.4 mg Cu/L, 26.1–219.5 

mg Mg/L, 3.2–26.6 mg Mn/L,36.0–223.3 mg Zn/L and 16.3–253.4 mg PO4/L) than control (197.9–

277.5 mg Ca/L, 40.3–92.6 mg Cu/L,9.4–20.3 mg Mg/L, 1.4–5.4 mg Mn/L, 21.1–62.9 mg Zn/L and 9.0–

17.8 mg PO4/L) in both sampling periods (Fig. 5). Concentrations of Al from the Technosols with high 

application rate of amendment mixture increased more than 2-fold being significantly different from the 

control (01–0.2 g Al/L). However, the coexistence of several elements in high concentrations can 

decrease the stabilization efficiency of the other elements due to, for example, competition for sorption 

sites (Kumpiene et al., 2008). The increase of Zn in leachates from Technosols can be related to an 

increase of dissolved organic carbon (Garcés et al., 2008) while the phosphates were linked to the 

organic matter and nutrient solution incorporated in the rockwool, which was used for strawberry 

cultivation. Nonetheless, the acidic conditions and the weathering of rockwool, which had significant 

concentrations of Al, may explain the increase of this element in leachates. 

An increase of the amendments dose in sulfide wastes can modify significantly leachate 

characteristics but were not enough to prevent acid mine drainage. In conclusion, all leachates had 

large amounts of hazardous chemical elements representing a great environmental risk.

Chemical quality of leachates and enzimatic activities in Technosols with gossan and sulfide wastes from the São Domingos 
mine 

227 

 

Cistus ladanifer germination and enzymatic activities  

 

No germination of C. ladanifer occured in any treatment probably due to the very acidic nature of 

SW and the continuous generation of acidity.  

As expected, enzymatic activities were significantly smaller than those in GW (Figs. 3 and 4). In 

fact, less acidic conditions in contaminated soils can explain higher enzymatic activities, namely 

dehydrogenase (Burgos et al., 2010). 

In the beginning of the experiment, amendments in some Technosols (SC30, SAC12 and SAC30) 

significantly stimulated dehydrogenase (1.14, 1.35 and 1.80 µg TPF g
-1

 16h
-1

, respectively), compared 

to control where the activity was below the detection limit of the methodology (Fig. 3). Organic C 

derived from amendments may be responsible for the enhanced dehydrogenase activity in Technosols 

although dehydrogenase activity of control increased over time to similar values than that of 

Technosols (except SA12 in the 2nd sampling where dehydrogenase activity was lower than control). 

Variations of leachates characteristics did not correlate to dehydrogenase activity. 

According to Hinojosa et al. (2008), toxicity of the pyrite sludge on dehydrogenase, acid 

phosphatase and ?-glucosidase can be reduced by application of sugar-beet residues. However, no 

significant variations in acid phosphatase and ?-glucosidase activities were detected with amendment 

application in this experiment (Fig. 4). 

 

Sulfide wastes with a layer of gossan wastes 

Chemical characterization of leachates 

 

According to Pérez-López et al. (2007a,b), the main concern of sulfide wastes is related to acid 

mine drainage generation. In this assay, an attempt was made to isolate SW from air/water using a 

layer of GW which could support a pioneer vegetation which would reduce chemical elements 

leaching, promote microbial activity, ecological succession and soil formation.  

Although leachates were still acidic and with high electrical conductivity, they had an electrical 

conductivity 36–60 % smaller and pH values increased more than 0.5 units, compared to control 

(GW/SW; 1.2&amp;lt;pH&amp;lt;1.6 and 12.0–31.6 mS/cm; Fig. 1). Although application of gossan layer over SW 

seemed to reduce the EC of leachates, this fact also occurred in SW leachates, associated with a 

decrease of elements in solution over time. In general, application of a gossan layer over SW did not 

have the same effect than the superficial application of fly ashes where pH reached values ?8.5 and 

EC was 0.5 mS/cm (Pérez-López et al., 2007a,b).  

Leachates showed a reduction trend on the concentration of chemical elements (except for As and 

Ca) with time (Table 4 and Fig. 6). This reduction does not agree with the results obtained in leachates 

from SW covered by a superficial layer of fly ashes, where the elements concentrations were constant 

after four months of incubation (Pérez-López et al., 2007b).

Technosols, independently of application dose and amendment type, leached higher 

concentrations of Mg in both sampling dates (54.2–354.5 mg/L) as well as Mn and Zn in the first 

sampling (29.9–45.6 and 252.0–372.3 mg/L, respectively) being significantly different from control 

(24.1–79.0 mg Mg/L, 16.4 mg Mn/L and 200.5 mf Zn/L) (Fig. 7). After that, significant differences were 

only obtained with high application doses ((G/S)A30, (G/S)C30, (G/S)AC30: ?1 mg Mn/L). These 

differences were also observed for Al (2
nd

 sampling) where the leachates reached the highest 

concentrations (?0.5 g Al/L). For Cu, Na and phosphate (in both or in one sampling) leachates from 

some Technosols reached higher concentrations than in control but with no clear tendency. 

A reduction of more than 32 % was observed for As, Fe, K, Na and Pb in leachates, in both 

sampling periods, as well as sulfates at the end of the experiment (Table 4 and Fig. 6). Concentrations 

of As, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, Zn and sulfates in leachates also decreased with application of fly ashes over 

pyritic sludge (Pérez-López et al., 2007b). 

Although initially leachates went through the GW layer with a higher pH than the layer below, this 

did not neutralize the acidity (similar pH values than leachates from assay 2) or reduce the mobility of 

elements in SW. This fact may be related to the small thickness of the GW layer (?4 cm) and 

eluviation of small particles of gossan materials and/or amendments to sulfide wastes. According to 

Santos et al. (2014c), the maintenance of humid SW (70 % of the maximum water-holding capacity) 

generates very acidic aqueous solutions (also observed in the present experiment – Fig. 1) containing 

several chemical elements, which then ascend to the surface by capillarity during the warm/hot 

months and crystallise due to water evaporation. The formation of small efflorescent soluble salts on 

the surface materials of this experiment confirms the occurrence of this process. The dissolution of 

these solid phases could also be observed in leachates as the concentration of elements and EC 

(Table 4 and Figs. 1 and 6) were significantly higher than those obtained in SW (Table 4 and Fig. 5).  

Therefore, the overlapping of two Technosols or of two mine wastes (GW and SW) in the 

conditions tested was not sufficient to improve leachates from sulfide wastes. 

 

Cistus ladanifer germination and enzymatic activities 

 

Cistus ladanifer germination occurred only in Technosols. This fact does not agree with the results 

obtained with GW. The combined effect of a weak structure of gossan wastes and the acid solution 

flowing upwards by capillarity from SW may explain the total inhibition of seed germination in control. 

Approximately 50 days after sowing, plants had a height of 2–3 cm in Technosols with no visible 

symptoms of nutritional deficiency or phytotoxicity. However, after one week, all the seedlings died, 

coinciding with the emergence of small quantities of salt efflorescences on the surface. As Technosols 

seem to support the vegetation, a thicker layer of Technosols made with gossan materials and organic 

amendments may result in the rehabilitation of SW. 

Enzymatic activities were determined in both materials (GW with/without amendments in the 

superficial layer, and SW with/without amendments in the deeper layer). In GW no differences were 

obtained among dehydrogenase activities of different treatments collected at both sampling periods 

(0.41–1.17 µg TPF g 16h
-1

 depending on treatment and sampling), as well as ?-glucosidase activity in

 the first sampling (0.09–0.53 µmol ?-nitrophenol g?¹ h?¹ depending on treatment) (Figs. 3 and 4). 

Nevertheless, acid phosphatase activities and ?-glucosidase activity of gossan materials from 

Technosols (collected in both sampling dates and at the end of the experiment, respectively) were 

significantly higher than control (µmol ?-nitrophenol g?¹ h?¹ ? GW/SW: 0.23 and 0.11 for acid 

phosphatase activities, 0.05 for ?-glucosidase activity) (Fig. 4). As expected, chemical characteristics 

of leachates were not related to the enzymatic activities of the gossan materials. In fact, the pH and 

elements concentrations are the result of leaching through gossan and sulfide wastes or Technosols 

containing both mine wastes.  

In all the treatments, no significant variations were obtained in dehydrogenase activity from gossan 

materials over time (Fig. 3). A similar tendency was observed for acid phosphatase, except in control 

(GW/SW) and Technosols containing residue from the liquor distillation of A. unedo fruit ((G/S)A12 

and (G/S)A30), where acid phosphatase activity decreased (p &amp;lt;0.05) during the experiment (Fig. 4). 

In contrast, ?-glucosidase activities tended to increase in the first sampling (although only values from 

control, (G/S)A12 and (G/S)AC12 were significant) but remained constant afterwards (Fig. 4).  

Dehydrogenase activities of gossan materials from all treatments were significantly smaller than 

those from the first assay; however, for other enzymatic activities the same behaviour only occurred in 

some treatments (acid phosphatase activity: GW/SW, (G/S)A12 and (G/S)A30; ?-glucosidase activity: 

(G/S)C30 and (G/S)AC12). Acidic conditions and high concentrations of elements that ascend from 

SW can justify the reduction of the enzymatic activities. According to Hinojosa et al. (2008), pyrite 

sludge mixed with soil can affect soil enzymes through various pathways: activity of the produced 

enzyme, biosynthesis of microbial enzymes, and composition of soil microflora or microbial groups 

that produce extracellular enzymes. 

Some amendment mixtures seemed to have an impact on enzymatic activities in sulfide materials; 

however, no clear tendency between dose and amendment type was observed. Thus in the 1st 

sampling, sulfide materials from some Technosols ((G/S)/A12, ((G/S)/C12, ((G/S)/C30 and 

((G/S)/AC30) had lower (p &amp;lt;0.05) dehydrogenase activities (&lt;0.54 µg TPF g
-1

 16h
-1

) than control 

(1.38 µg TPF g
-1

 16h
-1

) while in the 2nd sampling the same happened in(G/S)/A12 and G/S)/C30 (µg 

TPF g
-1

 16h
-1

 – ?0.2; GW/SW: 0.87). In contrast, in the 2nd sampling, acid phosphatase and ?-

glucosidase activities of (G/S)/A30 (0.47 and 0.36 µmol ?-nitrophenol g?¹ h?¹, respectively) and acid 

phosphatase activity of (G/S)/AC30 (0.35 µmol ?-nitrophenol g?¹ h?¹) were significantly higher than in 

control (µmol ?-nitrophenol g?¹ h?¹ – 0.23 and 0.14 for acid phosphatase and ?-glucosidase activities, 

respectively). 

In general, enzymatic activities were constant over time, independently of treatment. Although acid 

phosphatase activities of control, (G/S)/A30 and (G/S)/C12 increased between the first and second 

sampling periods, no correlation was established with chemical characteristics of leachates. 

Therefore, microbial functions of SW and Technosols containing SW did not change with the 

application of a superficial gossan layer with or without amendments. 

 

 

 



Chemical quality of leachates and enzimatic activities in Technosols with gossan and sulfide wastes from the São Domingos 
mine

CONCLUSIONS 

 

Leachates from gossan wastes had low concentrations of elements and pH values around 3.5–4. 

In general, amendments of these wastes improved significantly the chemical characteristics of 

leachates and the biological activity of the materials and stimulated germination and plant growth. 

These facts are essential for the processes of natural attenuation or phytostabilization.  

Chemical characteristics of leachates from sulfide wastes were typical of acid mine drainage, with 

very acidic pH (?1) and high concentrations of anions and cations. Although electrical conductivity and 

elements (As, Fe, K, Na, Pb and SO4) concentrations were reduced significantly and pH in leachates 

improved, amendments application was not enough to reduce sulfides oxidation or buffer leachates 

acidity. Dehydrogenase activity was also only stimulated in the beginning of the experiment while no 

alterations occurred in other enzymatic activities, suggesting that this amendment application is not an 

appropriate solution to remediate sulfide wastes. 

Due to the great reactivity of sulfide wastes, their isolation from atmosphere may be the best 

solution for rehabilitation. Although the application of a thin superficial layer of gossan with or without 

amendments was not effective in the immobilization of chemical elements, some amendment mixtures 

seemed to have a positive effect on enzymatic activities and led to seed germination and seedling 

growth (although only during a short period), suggesting that a thicker layer of amended gossan 

materials may improve this system allowing plant establishment and, consequently, reducing chemical 

elements leaching from sulfide wastes.

ABSTRACT 

 

Gossan wastes represent one of the most hazardous mine wastes in several mining areas from the 

Iberian Pyrite Belt. Phytostabilization of mine wastes with Cistus ladanifer L. could be a good option, 

but its growth and germination are impaired by substrata conditions. To overcome these limitations, 

application of organic and inorganic amendments may speed up the growth of C. ladanifer while 

improving the mine wastes. This study evaluated the simultaneous influence of different application 

rates of amendments and growth of C. ladanifer on chemical and biological properties of gossan 

wastes.  

Amendments used were mixtures (30, 75, 150 Mg/ha, 1:1:1) of rockwool, agriculture wastes and 

wastes from liquor distillation of Arbutus unedo L. fruits. A microcosm assay with four treatments was 

carried out (control and three amended treatments) under controlled conditions in a greenhouse 

during 505 days. C. ladanifer was sown in half of the pots from each treatment while the remainder 

was left bare.  

Gossan wastes had large total concentrations of several elements (g/kg ? Al: 24.8, As: 3.03, Cu: 0.23, 

Pb; 9.21) whereas the available concentrations of these elements were small (&amp;lt;5.7 % of total). The 

amendments applied (in particular at 75 and 150 Mg/ha) improved the structure and increased the 

water-holding capacity, pH and nutrients concentrations in the available fraction of the gossan 

materials. They also led to increases in dehydrogenase and ?-glucosidase activities and in plant 

growth (plant cover, plant height, length of young leaves, fresh biomass). In addition, plants from 

amended treatments presented lower concentrations of hazardous elements in shoots than plants 

from unamended control. The presence of the plant did not increase the available concentrations of 

hazardous elements in wastes, except for As when 150 Mg/ha of amendments were applied. 

Phytostabilization with C. ladanifer using a Technosol, resulting from the application of the studied 

amendments at 75 and 150 Mg/ha to gossan materials seems a promising solution for rehabilitation of 

this type of mine wastes.

INTRODUCTION 

 

One of the major global environmental concerns in abandoned mining areas, namely in the Iberian 

Pyrite Belt (IPB), is related to the large volume of dispersed tailings, composed of different mine 

wastes (Abreu et al., 2010a; Matos and Martins, 2006; Tordoff et al., 2000). Mine wastes from 

Portuguese IPB have high total concentrations of several chemical elements and usually also acid-

generating solid phases in some wastes (e.g. smelting ashes, milled pyrite) that can intensify their 

environmental impact, due to enhanced availability of chemical elements that can be transported by 

surface runoff to adjacent areas and/or leaching, and delay natural attenuation of mine wastes (Abreu 

et al., 2010a; Matos and Martins, 2006). Nevertheless, these mine tailings usually have sparse 

vegetation with slow natural colonization and scarce biodiversity.  

The São Domingos mine (SE Portugal, Portuguese IPB) was exploited from the pre-roman period 

until 1960 decade, both in the gossan and volcanogenic massive sulfides ore deposits. Nowadays, 

this mine is abandoned and have large amounts of different mining wastes sparsely dispersed, which 

reach a total volume of 10.8 x 10
6
 m

3
, with high total concentrations of hazardous chemical elements 

(Álvarez-Valero et al., 2008; Matos and Martins, 2006). Considering the metal mobility, mass/volume 

and the bioavailable fraction of the potential contaminants, the gossan wastes represent the fourth 

most hazardous mine waste in São Domingos mine (modern slag &gt; leaching tanks &gt; country rocks &gt; 

gossan wastes; Pérez-López et al., 2008), with approximately 1.7 x 10
6
 m

3
 of this material/residue 

(Álvarez-Valero et al., 2008). 

Phytostabilization is considered an in situ green technology appropriate for the rehabilitation of 

mine wastes and multi-elemental contaminated soils in the Mediterranean basin (Abreu and 

Magalhães, 2009; EPA, 2000; Mendez and Maier, 2008; Tordoff et al., 2000). According to these 

authors, the importance of a plant cover is related to the improvement of the physical (e.g. structure), 

chemical (e.g. increase of organic matter and nutrients, immobilization of contaminants, decreased 

leaching) and biological (e.g. increase of microbial activity and diversity) characteristics of soil or 

wastes (Abreu and Magalhães, 2009 and references therein). Plants also restore ecosystem functions 

and lead to ecological succession, without requiring further disposal of the resulting biomass (EPA, 

2000).  

Cistus ladanifer L. is considered a good option for phytostabilization of mine wastes and soils 

developed on mine wastes as it is already present in several mining areas from the Portuguese IPB 

(Alvarenga et al., 2004; Batista et al., 2009; Freitas et al., 2004; Santos et al., 2009, 2012, 2014). 

However, this species grows slowly and has a small germination rate, due to the conditions of the 

mine substrata and Mediterranean climate (e.g. nutritional constraints, drought, intense irradiance, 

high total concentrations of trace elements), which are disadvantages for the success of 

phytostabilization. 

Application of amendments can speed up the phytostabilization of the mine wastes (Abreu and 

Magalhães, 2009; Adriano et al., 2004; EPA, 2000; Macías, 2004; Macías et al., 2011). Several 

organic and inorganic wastes that can be used as amendments would otherwise end up in landfills 

(Macías, 2004; Macías et al., 2011). In general, the amendments improve substrata structure and

increase the nutrients and organic matter contents and water-holding capacity, essential 

characteristics in the rehabilitation of Mediterranean mining areas, and can also immobilize hazardous 

elements by several chemical processes (Adriano et al., 2004; Kumpiene et al., 2008; Tordoff et al., 

2000), although some of these effects may not last long (Macías, 2004; Macías et al., 2011). In 

addition, mixtures of amendments should be adjusted to the conditions of each mine waste in order to 

produce a specific Technosol that promotes and maintains biogeochemical processes and reduces 

availability of contaminants to plants (Macías, 2004; Macías et al., 2011; Yao et al., 2009).  

This study aimed to: evaluate the influence of combined use of different application rates of 

amendments and C. ladanifer growth on the improvement of chemical and biological properties of 

gossan wastes from the São Domingos mine; and assess the growth and accumulation of chemical 

elements of C. ladanifer during a phytostabilisation process. 

 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Experimental set-up 

 

Composite samples (0?20 cm deep, nine subsamples, a total of approximately 90 kg) of mining 

wastes, which are composed of gossan materials mixed with host rocks (hereinafter named as gossan 

wastes ? GW), and seeds from C. ladanifer (50 plants) were collected near of the open pit of São 

Domingos mine in 2009. This waste material was chosen due to the large amounts of trace elements, 

the corresponding potential environmental risk they pose (Álvarez-Valero et al., 2008; Pérez-López et 

al., 2008) and the fact that the area is already naturally colonized by autochthones plants.  

The amendment applied was a mixture (1:1:1) of used rockwool from strawberry production in 

hydroponics, plant remains from several berries and substrate used in strawberry crops at 2:3 m/m, 

and wastes from liquor distillation of Arbutus unedo L. fruits (regional liquor). The proportion and type 

of organic and inorganic wastes used were chosen because of their physical and chemical properties 

and large quantities available near the mine at almost “zero cost”. These wastes are usually deposited 

in various locations without any treatment or legal permission.  

The GW and amendment were air-dried before use. A microcosm assay was set up with four 

treatments (unamended control and application of the amendment at 30, 75 and 150 Mg /ha, each 

with six replicates) in pots containing about 2 kg of GW (fraction &amp;lt;10 mm) mixed manually with the 

organic/inorganic wastes.  

After 15 days of incubation at 70 % of the maximum water-holding capacity, C. ladanifer was sown 

(0.5 g seeds per pot) in half of the pots from each treatment (n = 3), while the other three pots 

remained bare. The seeds were pre-treated for optimal germination (heating at 100 °C for 30 min; 

Corral et al., 1990). All pots (with and without plants) were kept at 70 % of the maximum water-holding 

capacity in a greenhouse for 505 days. 

Plants were thinned to 60 and 35 plants per pot 50 and 167 days after sowing, respectively, to 

minimize plant competition. Nitrogen was applied 280 days after sowing as an aqueous solution 

corresponding to 50 mg N/kg per pot in the form of calcium nitrate.

Experimental monitoring and analytical methods 

 

The initial materials (fraction &amp;lt;2 mm of GW and total fraction of organic and inorganic wastes) 

were characterized for pH and electrical conductivity (EC) in water suspension (1:2.5 m/V), organic C 

(Tinsley method), extractable P and K (Egner-Riehm method), total N (Kjeldahl method) and multi-

elemental concentrations, which were analysed by atomic emission spectrometry with induced plasma 

and instrumental neutron activation analysis after acid digestion with HClO4 + HNO3 + HCl + HF 

(Actlabs, ISO/IEC 17025, Activation Laboratories, 2014). In GW (fraction &amp;lt;2 mm), Fe from iron oxides 

(de Endredy, 1963) and Mn from manganese oxides (Chao, 1972) were also determined. Particle size 

distribution of GW (total fraction) was determined by sieving and sedimentation, with the clay fraction 

(&amp;lt;2 ?m) separated from coarser materials (&amp;lt;2 mm) after water dispersion and sedimentation 

following Stokes law. 

At the beginning (after 15 days of incubation and before sowing) and end of the experiment (505 

days after sowing), composite samples of the materials from each pot were collected (0?15 cm of 

depth).  These samples were homogenised and sieved (&amp;lt;2 mm). A part of these samples were kept 

fresh (4 ?C) for soil enzymatic analysis and determination of multi-elemental concentration in the 

available fraction while the remaining subsamples were air-dried for analysis of pH, EC, organic C, 

total N and extractable P and K, by the same methodologies referred above.  

To determine the available fraction, elements were extracted from GW by the rhizosphere-based 

method, which uses a 10 mM mixture of organic acids (acetic acid + lactic acid + citric acid + malic 

acid + formic acid; Feng et al., 2005).  

Several enzymatic activities were analysed as biological parameters to evaluate the rehabilitation 

process, namely: dehydrogenase (Tabatabai, 1994), ?-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21; Eivazi and 

Tabatabai, 1988), acid phosphomonoesterase (acid phosphatase EC 3.1.3.2; Eivazi and Tabatabai, 

1977) and urease (EC 3.5.1.5; Kandeler and Gerber, 1988). Dehydrogenase was used as an index of 

overall microbial activity while other enzymatic activities are related to C, P and N cycling. 

The percentage of vegetation cover was determined 25 and 50 days after sowing, (Qu and de 

Varennes, 2010) and plant growth was analysed at each thinning (dominant plant height and length of 

young leaves and fresh biomass). At the end of the experiment, roots and shoots (composed of leaves 

and twigs) of C. ladanifer plants were collected. Plant samples were washed with tap water and then 

with distilled water. After washing, the roots were sonicated in distilled water for 30 minutes. Plant 

samples were dried (40 ºC), homogenised and finely ground. Elements (except N) were extracted from 

samples with ultrapure concentrated nitric acid (69 %) under pressure in a microwave digester during 

2 min at 85 ºC + 5 min at 145 ºC + 5 min at 200 ºC + 18 min at 200 ºC. Total concentration of N was 

analysed by combustion with a Leco analyser. Certified reference samples of bush branches and 

leaves (NCSDC73348) and blanks were used in parallel to control the accuracy of the method. 

The aqueous solutions from GW and plant extracts were stored at –18 ºC until analysed for Al, Ca, 

Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn by flame atomic absorption spectrometry and As by graphite furnace 

atomic absorption spectrometry.

Data analysis 

 

Data were analysed by a one way ANOVA and the Duncan test (p &amp;lt;0.05) used to separate means, 

using the statistical programme SPSS v18.0 for Windows. For statistical purposes, the results below 

the detection limit were assumed as half of the detection limit. Bivariate Pearson correlations were 

used to correlate GW and plant characteristics (r  &gt; 0.90). Quality control of the analyses was made by

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Characterization of gossan mine wastes and amendments  

 

Gossan wastes from the São Domingos mine had a clay loam texture, acid pH, small EC and a 

fertility characterised by low concentrations of organic C, total N and extractable P, but medium 

concentrations of extractable K (Table 1). These materials had great total concentrations of several 

potential hazardous elements (g/kg ? Al: 24.8, As: 3.03, Cu: 0.23, Fe: 129; Pb: 9.21; Table 1) and 

could be considered as contaminated with As, Cu and Pb for commercial and industrial uses (CCME, 

2007). Concentrations of some elements (e.g. As, Cu, Pb and Zn), as well as other chemical 

properties studied in this GW (Table 1), were in the same range as those reported for other gossan 

wastes from São Domingos (Álvarez-Valero et al., 2008; de Varennes et al., 2010; Pérez-López et al., 

2008; Santos et al., 2012, 2013a). 

The concentrations of elements in the available fraction were small varying between 0.01 and 5.7 

% of the total concentrations, with the exception of Ca which was 23.2 % of the total concentration. 

Although the available fraction can change with time, space and the extraction solution used (Adriano, 

2001; Kabata-Pendias, 2004), small concentrations of As, Cu, Fe, Pb and Zn in the available fractions 

were also obtained in same type of mine wastes from São Domingos by Pérez-López et al. (2008) and 

Santos et al. (2012). According to these authors, the presence of these elements mainly in the 

residual fraction, but also in iron and manganese oxides and/or organic matter can explain their low 

availability. In addition, the presence of solid phases in the residual fraction, with low solubility, like 

arsenates containing Pb and Pb+Fe can also contribute for their low availability (Santos et al., 2012). 

All the wastes used as amendment had chemical properties considered useful and safe for land 

application and rehabilitation of GW. Values of pH and concentrations of total N, organic C and 

extractable P and K as well as total concentrations of several nutrients (Ca, Mg, Mn, P and Zn) in the 

amendments were larger than those in GW (Table 1). The C:N ratio depended on the type of residue 

(rockwool = 11; plant remains = 31; substrate used in strawberry crops = 60 and wastes from liquor 

distillation of A. unedo fruits = 9) suggesting different mineralization rates and release of N (de 

Varennes, 2003), which can be an advantage, in the medium-term, for the phytostabilization. 

Concentrations of hazardous elements in the amendments were much lower than those in GW, except

for Al in rockwool (Table 1). Although EC values of organic and inorganic wastes were higher than 

those in GW their application is without any environmental risk.

Characterization of the microcosm experiment 

General chemical properties of the materials 

 

At the beginning of the experiment (after 15 days of incubation and before sowing) and at the end 

of the experiment (505 days after sowing) amendment application improved the structure of GW (data 

not shown). They also increased the organic matter content and, consequently, the water-holding 

capacity. Values of pH from amended GW increased in both sampling periods (more than 0.4 units 

compared to the control) as well as the EC at the beginning of the experiment, compared to the control 

(Table 2). However, the EC values in amended GW were still small (&amp;lt;748 µS/cm), compared to the 

application of other amendments like sewage sludge, sewage sludge+sugar beet sludge and

municipal solid waste compost in other contaminated soils (Alvarenga et al., 2008a,b). At small 

application rates, the reduction of EC with time can be related to leaching of the chemical elements in 

treatments without plants and uptake of elements when plants were present.

The plants led to increased pH in control materials but were not enough to improve fertility, 

probably because so few survived in this treatment, and the ones that did remained small.  

The increase of N, P, K and organic C was only significant with the highest application rates (75 

and 150 Mg/ha), independently of the sampling period or presence of plants. At the end of the 

experiment, the fertility increased in the amended GW with the highest values observed in the 

treatments combining amendment and plants (especially for organic C at application rates of 30 and 

75 Mg/ha and extractable P when amendment was applied at 75 and 150 Mg/ha).

Cistus ladanifer L. 

247 

 

 In general, the amendment, especially at the highest application rates, and C. ladanifer growth 

enhanced much more the pH and fertility of this type of GW than polyacrylate polymers and S. 

purpurea (Santos et al., 2013a). 

 

Available fraction of the elements in the materials 

 

In both sampling periods, the concentration of Pb was close or below 5 mg/kg, the detection limit of 

the apparatus. Similar results were obtained by Alvarenga et al. (2008b) in contaminated soils from 

the Aljustrel mine amended with different wastes.  

Amendment application, especially at high application rates (75 and 150 Mg/ha) led to increases in 

the concentrations of other hazardous elements (Al and As) and nutrients (except Cu and Zn in the 

beginning and end of the experiment in the presence of plants) in the available fraction in both 

sampling periods and independently of the plant (Fig. 1). These high available concentrations are 

related to the incorporation of rockwool, which had Al in its composition, and nutrients coming from the 

remaining nutrient solution used to grow strawberry (Table 1). However, no relationship was obtained 

between pH and organic C and the available concentrations of the elements. Similar results were 

obtained by several authors using the same or other extraction methods (Alvarenga et al., 2008a,b; 

Burgos et al., 2010; Santos et al., 2013a). 

In general, the available concentrations of Al, Ca, Fe, K and Mg decreased with time in the 

absence of plants (Fig. 1), although with no clear trend. Similar results were reported for Cu, Mn and 

Zn with application of different amendments and acid soil by Burgos et al. (2010). Low concentrations 

of these elements at the end of the experiment, compared with the beginning, can derive from 

chemical reactions and leaching during the experiment. Additionally, application of organic matter can 

promote the formation of complexes with cations (although no relationship was obtained in the present 

study) and increase cationic exchange capacity (Adriano et al., 2004). 

In contrast, the concentration of As (at an application rate of 30 Mg/ha) and Cu and Zn (at 

application rates of 75 and 150 Mg/ha) at the end of the experiment were higher than in the beginning. 

In fact, a considerable fraction of Cu and Zn can be associated with organic matter in the gossan 

materials (Abreu et al., 2010b; Santos et al., 2012), and the mineralization of the organic matter could 

promote the release of these metals. However, no relationship was obtained between available 

concentrations of these metals and increases in organic C with amendment application rate. Inhibition 

of the formation of low solubility solid phases (e.g. metal arsenates) could have occurred (Abreu et al., 

2009; Santos et al., 2012). 

At the end of the experiment, the presence of plants did not influence the concentrations of Al, Ca, 

Fe, Mg and Mn in the available fraction of GW, independently of the treatment (Fig. 1). However, the 

concentration of some nutrients decreased with plant growth, namely K in all amended treatments, Cu 

in the amended treatment at 150 Mg/ha and Zn in the amended treatments at 75 and 150 Mg/ha. This 

could be related to uptake by plants or more exudation of organic acids by roots, capable of forming 

complexes and reducing the availability of the cations (Feng et al., 2005; Gonzaga et al., 2012; Tu et 

al., 2004).

Cistus ladanifer L. 

249 

 

The presence of plants in treatments with higher amendment application rates (75 and 150 Mg/ha) 

increased by 2 and 3-fold the available As in GW, respectively. The same behaviour was observed in 

a mesoscosm experiment using soils developed on gossan with different types of polyacrylate 

polymers and S. purpurea and natural plant colonization (Santos et al., 2013a). The increase of 

dissolved organic carbon in the rhizosphere due to exudation of low-molecular-weight organic acids by 

roots as well as changes in the composition of root exudates may explain the high As availability 

(Feng et al., 2005; Gonzaga et al., 2012; Tu et al., 2004). Thus, high application rates of amendments 

can contribute to an increase of low-molecular-weight organic acids and affect the availability of As. 

Organic acids can also form complexes with cations or block As adsorption sites on soil particles as 

iron oxides (Feng et al., 2005; Gonzaga et al., 2012; Tu et al., 2004). Root exudates of Pteris vittata L. 

(an As hyperaccumulating Chinese Brake fern) and Nephrolepis exaltata L. (an As-sensitive Boston 

fern) dissolved significant amounts of As from two arsenates (Tu et al., 2004). Low-molecular-weight 

organic acids can also release As from Fe?, Mn? and Al?oxides or hydroxides in contaminated soils 

(Zang et al., 2005).  

Although GW had large total concentrations of some elements (e.g. Al, As, Cu and Pb), the 

concentrations potentially available for organisms (C. ladanifer and microorganisms involved in 

biogeochemical cycles) after amendment application represented a low potential environmental risk, 

with the increase of nutrient availability being an advantage for the rehabilitation process.  

 

Enzymatic activities in the materials 

 

Enzymatic activities (Fig. 2) were used as biological indicators to monitor the phytostabilization of 

GW. The smallest values of dehydrogenase and ?-glucosidase activities were obtained in the control 

(0.71-1.78 µg TPF g
-1

 16h
-1

 and 0.03-0.05 µmol ?-nitrophenol g
-1

 h-1, respectively). However, urease 

and phosphatase activities in the same treatment (0.81-1.14 µmol N-NH?? g
-1

 2h
-1

 and 0.64-1.06 µmol 

?-nitrophenol g
-1

 h
-1

, respectively) were similar or even higher than in the amended treatments (&amp;lt;

detection limit-0.91 µmol N-NH?? g
-1

 2h
-1

 and 0.51-1.17 µmol ?-nitrophenol g
-1

 h
-1

, respectively), 

depending on sampling date. Only phosphatase and ?-glucosidase activities were influenced 

positively (?1.4-fold greater) by the presence of plants. A similar behaviour for all enzymatic activities, 

except ?-glucosidase, was reported in a microcosm assays where gossan materials from the São 

Domingos mine were also used and where Briza maxima L., S. purpurea and Chaetopogon 

fasciculatus (Link) Hayek were present (de Varennes et al., 2010).  

In general, soil microorganisms, evaluated by the dehydrogenase activity, benefited from the 

presence of plants and amendment application, especially at higher application rates (75 and 150 

Mg/ha). Increase of this activity was also verified with addition of several organic and inorganic 

amendments to contaminated soils with and without plants (Alvarenga et al., 2008b; Burgos et al., 

2010). The ?-glucosidase activity was also greater in amended GW compared to control, but the 

presence of plants did not affect its activity over that of bare GW. An increase in organic C and pH in 

the amended GW can explain the highest activities of dehydrogenase (0.95 &amp;lt;r &amp;lt;0.97 and 0.85 &amp;lt;r &amp;lt;

0.93, depending on sampling period and presence of plants) and ?-glucosidase (0.90 &amp;lt;r &amp;lt;0.98 and 



Improvement of chemical and biological properties of gossan mine wastes following application of amendments and growth of 
Cistus ladanifer L. 

250 

 

0.90 &amp;lt;r &amp;lt;0.94, depending on sampling date). The effect of these two soil parameters in ?-glucosidase 

activity was also reported by Alvarenga et al. (2008a).  

For phosphatase and urease activities, no clear tendency was observed between treatments in 

agreement with the results obtained by the application of some organic and inorganic wastes 

combined with plant growth (L. perenne and L. multiflorum) in contaminated soils from the Aljustrel 

mine (Alvarenga et al., 2008a,b),  

In general, a positive effect of root exudates, availability of nutrients and organic C and/or pH 

increase derived from amendment application to gossan materials (especially with high application 

rates) on dehydrogenase and other soil enzymes related to nutrient cycling was observed.

Growth of Cistus ladanifer  

 

There were no significant differences between values of plant cover 25 days after sowing (Table 3), 

but by 50 days after sowing the plant cover reached the highest values in the treatment 150 Mg/ha. 

The opposite was observed for the same species sown in a soil developed on gossan materials and 

amended with hydrophilic polyacrylate polymers (Santos et al., 2013a).

Values for each date followed by a different letter are significantly different (p &amp;lt;0.05). 

No relationship was observed between the properties of GW and plant cover. However, the 

improvement of structure and water-holding capacity, due to the incorporation of rockwool and organic 

wastes, may explain the larger area covered by C. ladanifer in amended treatments. Wang et al. 

(2008) reported that an unfavourable physical structure in tailings from the Xiangtan mine was the 

most significant constraint for the establishment of natural vegetation. In addition, the improvement of 

water-holding capacity by hydrophilic polyacrylate polymers application to soils developed on gossan 

also enhanced soil cover and growth of S. purpurea, B. maxima and C. fasciculatus (de Varennes et 

al., 2010; Qu and de Varennes, 2010). 

Plants were taller, accumulated morefresh biomass in roots and shoots, and had larger young 

leaves in the amended GW than in control; their survival rate was also greater (Amended treatments: 

66?89 %; Control: 66?89 %) (Tables 4 and 5). However, in general, no significant differences among 

amended treatments were observed. During all the experiment, the higher available concentrations of 

nutrients and organic C in GW by amendment application (Fig. 1 and Table 2) led to better growth of 

C. ladanifer (Tables 4 and 5) in agreement with the reported by several authors using different 

amendments, contaminated soils/mine wastes and plant species (Alvarenga et al., 2008b; Conesa et 

al., 2007; de Varennes et al., 2010; Qu and de Varennes, 2010; Santos et al., 2013a). Moreover, no 

negative influence of the hazardous elements in the GW available fraction on growth of C. ladanifer 

was observed. 

The reduction of the root-shoot ratio (dry weight of root biomass/dry weight of shoot biomass) from 

0.6 in control to 0.3?0.4 in amended treatments, also suggests a plant response to more favourable 

growing conditions (Harris, 1992). In this way, improvement of the fertility of GW was of major 

importance for the success of phytostabilization, especially in early stages of plant growth (Conesa et 

al., 2007; Tordoff et al., 2000).

Concentration of chemical elements in Cistus ladanifer 

 

Despite the variations in the available concentrations of elements in GW from different treatments 

(Fig. 1 and Table 2), no relationship was found between these and the concentrations of elements in 



Improvement of chemical and biological properties of gossan mine wastes following application of amendments and growth of 
Cistus ladanifer L. 

253 

 

C. ladanifer (roots and shoots; Tables 6 and 7). In fact, the concentrations of elements in C. ladanifer 

growing in mines from Portuguese IPB can depend on several biological processes (e.g. uptake, 

accumulation in roots, translocation from roots to shoots and tolerance capacity) related to the species 

or even ecotype, rather than concentration of elements in the soil available fraction (Santos et al., 

2012, 2014). In general, roots and shoots had higher concentrations of all elements than those in the 

available fraction of GW. Exceptions were observed for Al, As and Fe in plant shoots from the 

amended treatments with the highest application rate.

Concentrations of As, Ca, K, Pb, Fe, Na and Zn in roots and concentrations of K, Mg and N in 

shoots were similar, independently of treatment. However, plants from control had larger 

concentrations of Al, N, Cu and Zn in roots and of Al, As, Cu, Fe, Na, Pb and Zn in shoots than those 

from amended treatments (Tables 6 and 7). In addition, the values of As and Pb in shoots from control 

reached values considered phytotoxic for plants (Kabata-Pendias, 2011). Although the accumulation 

depended on the plant species and amendments applied, similar results (higher concentrations in

shoots from control than amended treatments) were also reported by Qu and de Varennes (2010) 

using different amendments and plant species in a soil developed on gossan.  

In shoots from all treatments, the concentrations of micronutrients and Ca were within the range 

considered sufficient for various plant species but concentrations of N, K and Mg are not considered 

adequate for growth (Kabata-Pendias, 2011; de Varennes, 2003). However, the increase in the 

availability of N, K and Mg in the GW following amendment application did not correspond to larger 

concentrations in shoots suggesting that adequate levels of these elements for C. ladanifer may be 

lower than those reported in the literature for other species. In fact, in natural conditions, shoots and 

roots of C. ladanifer collected in several mines from Portuguese IPB showed a wide range of all 

elements concentrations (Alvarenga et al. 2004; Batista et al. 2007, 2009; Freitas et al. 2004; Santos 

et al., 2012, 2013b,2014).

Improvement of chemical and biological properties of gossan mine wastes following application of amendments and growth of 
Cistus ladanifer L. 

255 

 

For C. ladanifer, the accumulation pattern suggests the existence of tolerance strategies related to 

the low fertility of GW and phytotoxicity of hazardous elements. Plants from control had an intensive 

uptake of the elements (even the hazardous) and accumulation of nutrients in photosynthetic active 

organs, whereas plants from amended treatments restricted the translocation to shoots of hazardous 

elements such as As and Pb. In this way, amendments application is an advantage for the success of 

phytostabilization. 

 

CONCLUSIONS 

 

The gossan waste studied had limiting characteristic for Cistus ladanifer growth, namely high total 

concentrations of several elements (Al, As, Cu, Fe, K and Pb), low fertility and acid pH although only a 

small percentage of the elements was in bioavailable forms. Amendment application, especially at 75 

and 150 Mg/ha, improved physical (structure) and chemical properties (fertility, pH, concentrations of 

nutrients in the available fraction) of the gossan waste and increased enzymatic activities related to 

nutrient cycling and microbial activity. In addition, plants from the amended treatments had lower 

concentrations of hazardous elements in shoots than those from the control, minimizing potential 

bioaccumulation in the food chain. 

Although C. ladanifer is already present in the São Domingos mine, the improvement in gossan 

waste may stimulate its growth in situ, providing a better plant cover as a result of faster growth during 

the phytostabilization process.

ABSTRACT 

 

This study evaluated the recovery efficiency of a system combining two mine wastes: gossan (GW) 

and sulfide-rich wastes (SW). Technosols were made by the incorporation of amendment mixtures, at 

30 and 60 g/kg, containing agro-industrial residues and GW. These Technosols (or only GW – control) 

overlie the sulfhide-rich wastes, which were isolated from air/water by an alkaline barrier. In the 

Technosols or GW, autochthones plants were developed (phytostabilisation process). Two microcosm 

assays, under controlled conditions, were carried out where Cistus ladanifer or Lavandula pedunculata 

were sown and grown for one and three years, respectively. 

Technosols improved the structure, water-holding capacity and pH as well as increased the nutrients 

concentrations in the available fraction of the GW allowing the germination and good development of 

both species. No visual symptoms of deficiency/toxicity were observed although in some cases shoots 

had reached phytotoxic (As or Mn) or deficient (Cu) concentrations. Shoots elements concentrations 

were below the potentially hazardous level for domestic animals intake, and plants behaviours were 

adequate to their use in phytostabilisation (high uptake of elements, storage of hazardous elements in 

roots, non-accumulators of hazardous elements). Liming components of the barrier stabilised the SW 

reducing their oxidation and the ascension of the acid solutions and elements. Technosols were 

essential for the implementation of the phytostabilisation process in GW. The system of combined 

rehabilitation of GW and SW was efficient and sustainable for long-term.

INTRODUCTION 

 

In the past, the mining activity in the Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB) was developed without controlled 

rules for minimization of environmental or health risks. São Domingos (SE of Portugal, IPB) is a 

medium-sized mine that was exploited from the pre-roman period until 1960, both in the gossan and 

volcanogenic massive sulfides ore deposits (Matos et al., 2006; Quental et al., 2002). As a result of 

the different periods and techniques of exploration, between 27 and 32 Tg of different wastes were 

disposed over a large area affecting around 3.2 Mm
2
 of land (Álvarez-Valero et al., 2008; Matos and 

Martins, 2006; Pérez-López et al., 2008; Quental et al., 2002). Each mine waste has different risks 

associated to its mass/volume, chemical composition and potential generation of acid mine drainage 

(Álvarez-Valero et al., 2008; Pérez-López et al., 2008). Taken into account the mobility of some 

elements and the mass/volume of gossan (4.1 Tg/1.6 Mm
3
) and brittle pyrite (0.06 Tg/0.2 Mm

3
), these 

materials represent the fourth and fifth, respectively, most hazardous mine wastes in the São 

Domingos mine area (Pérez-López et al., 2008). 

São Domingos, as well as other mines from IPB, have an additional environmental problem 

because some of their mine wastes are composed of reactive minerals, especially sulfides, which 

generate acid drainage during all year (Abreu et al., 2010; Álvarez-Valero et al., 2008; Matos and 

Martins, 2006; Pérez-López et al., 2008; Quental et al., 2002; Sánchez-España, 2008). 

Among the in situ technologies and comparing with the engineering techniques, phytostabilisation 

is considered the most suitable for the rehabilitation of different mine wastes or soils developed on 

mine wastes with multielemental contamination (Abreu and Magalhães, 2009; EPA, 2000; Monterroso 

et al., 1998), namely in arid and semiarid conditions (Mendes and Maier, 2008). Several 

environmental and economic advantages of this technology are reported by the same authors. 

Some autochthones plant species are tolerant to the mining conditions (e.g. high total 

concentrations of trace elements, low pH and fertility and poor structure and water holding capacity) 

naturally colonizing mining areas from IPB, as for instance São Domingos mine (e.g. several species 

of Cistus, Lavandula and Erica) (Abreu et al., 2008, 2012a, 2012b; de la Fuente et al., 2010; Freitas et 

al., 2004a, 2004b; Pérez-López et al., 2014; Santos et al., 2012, 2014a). However, the sowing and 

establishment of the seedlings directly into tailings and/or soils developed on mine wastes can be very 

difficult or almost impossible, especially in Mediterranean climate (Tordoff et al., 2000). Besides, the 

slow growth rate of the plants can also limit the success of the phytostabilisation process.  

Application of amendments can improve the establishment and development of these plants. In 

fact, although Cistus ladanifer is already present in the São Domingos mine, the improvement of the 

gossan wastes characteristics (e.g. structure, water-holding capacity, pH and nutrients concentrations 

in the available fraction of the materials) can stimulate its growth (Santos et al., 2014b) in situ 

providing a faster and better plant cover during the phytostabilization process. 

In general, the amendments improve essential characteristics of the substrata (e.g. structure, 

fertility and water-holding capacity) for growth of plants and other organisms, and can immobilize 

potentially hazardous elements by several chemical processes (Adriano et al., 2004; Kumpiene et al., 

2008; Tordoff et al., 2000; Wong, 2003). The use of amendments together with the plants contributes 



Combined rehabilitation of gossan and sulfide-rich wastes by phytostabilisation with autochthones species using Technosols 

 

264 

 

to the occurrence of natural attenuation processes, increasing microbial biomass and fertility and 

appearance of spontaneous vegetation (Clemente et al., 2006), contributing to the carbon 

sequestration. However, some effects of the amendments may not last long (Macías, 2004; Macías et 

al., 2011) being necessary repetitive applications (Pérez-de-Mora et al., 2011). In addition, 

amendments mixtures should be adjusted to the physical and chemical conditions of each mine waste 

in order to produce a specific Technosol that promotes and keep the biogeochemical processes and 

reduces the availability of the potentially hazardous elements (Macías, 2004; Macías et al., 2011). In 

fact, the efficiency of the Technosols in the rehabilitation process of degraded/contaminated areas is 

confirmed in several in micro- and meso-cosmos studies under controlled conditions (Arbestainet al., 

2008; Santos et al., 2014b, 2014c, 2015; Yao et al., 2009) as well as in the field (Bolaños et al., 2015; 

Macías-García et al., 2009). 

Previous studies (Santos et al., 2014b, 2014c, 2015) demonstrated that although elements 

concentrations (e.g. As, Fe, K, Na, Pb and SO4) and pH in leachates are significantly improved in the 

Technosols composed of sulfide-rich materials and organic/inorganic wastes, this methodology was 

not enough to reduce the sulfides oxidation or buffer leachates acidity. Nonetheless, the use of a 

Technosol obtained from gossan wastes and organic/inorganic wastes can be a promising approach 

to isolate sulfide-rich wastes from air allowing plant establishment and reduction of elements leaching 

from sulfide wastes (Santos et al., 2015). Indeed, in some situations a combined approach involving a 

covering material, which is sown with tolerant plants can have advantages rather any single 

conventional approach (Tordoff et al., 2000). 

The main aim of this study was to demonstrate the efficiency of a system, which combined the 

rehabilitation of gossan wastes, by the conception of Technosols with agro-industrial wastes and 

development of autochthones plants (phytostabilisation process), and sulfide-rich wastes by its natural 

isolation from air/water. For this, the study aimed: i) to demonstrate the efficiency of a alkaline barrier 

(limestone wastes and biomass ashes) in the reduction of the upward flow of the acid solution rich in 

potentially hazardous elements from SW and decreasing of the leaching; ii) to evaluate the 

improvement of the chemical characteristics of gossan wastes by its inclusion in Technosols; and iii) to 

assess the development and accumulation of the elements (potentially hazardous elements and 

nutrients) in Lavandula pedunculata and Cistus ladanifer, at mid-term, during a phytostabilisation 

process with Technosols composed of gossan and organic/inorganic wastes 

 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Experimental set-up 

 

Two mining wastes from São Domingos, which are mainly composed of gossan materials 

(hereinafter named as gossan wastes ? GW) and crushed pyrite and smelting ashes (herein after 

named as sulfide-rich wastes ? SW) were selected due to their large amounts of potentially hazardous 

elements, potential generation of acid mine drainage, wide distribution in the mine area, and, 

consequently, their environmental risk (Álvarez-Valero et al., 2008; Pérez-López et al., 2008; Quental 

et al., 2002). Moreover, it was also taken into account the potential of some of these mine wastes

265 

 

(GW) to support the development of autochthones vegetation (Qu and de Varennes, 2010; Santos et 

al., 2013a, 2014b, 2015). 

Composite samples of those mine wastes and seeds of Lavandula pedunculata (Mill.) Cav. and 

Cistus ladanifer L. were collected in the São Domingos mining area. Sampling areas of GW and SW 

were located south-west of the open pit, being the SW located near the former leaching tanks. The 

SW are bare and exposed to severe water erosion while GW are naturally but sparsely colonized 

mainly by Erica australis L.. 

The microcosm assay (n = 8 per treatment) were assembled in the following order (from bottom to 

top, Fig. 1): SW (total fraction at 50 % of water-holding capacity), limestone, biomass ashes and GW 

or Technosols (at 70 % of the water-holding capacity). The Technosols (Table 1) were composed of 

GW (fraction &amp;lt;10 mm) and different amendment mixtures containing organic/inorganic wastes (equal 

proportion of each residue) from agro-industry: plant remains + strawberry substrate at 2:3 m/m – 

AgW; rockwool used for strawberry crops – RW; and residues from small distilleries ? Arbutus unedo 

L. or Ceratonia siliqua L. fruit spirits distillation – AW, CW, respectively. The amendment mixtures and 

application rates used (Table 1) were based on the results of Santos et al. (2014b, 2015). The GW 

and amendment mixtures were mixed manually to create the Technosols. Limestone (L; Ø of 2?3 cm) 

and biomass ashes (BA) were used in order to create an alkaline barrier between SW and 

GW/Technosols.

All organic and inorganic wastes were used due to their physical and chemical characteristics 

(Table 2) and easy obtaining at very low cost (only associated to their transport) and large quantity, 

and location near the mine. Moreover, these wastes used in the Technosols are usually deposited in 

various locations without any treatment or legal permission and valorisation.  

After one month of incubation of the GW and Technosols, L. pedunculata was sown (0.5 g seeds 

per pot) in half of the pots from each treatment, while in the other pots was sown pre-treated seeds of 

C. ladanifer (0.5 g seeds per pot; heating at 100 °C for 30 min; Corral et al., 1990). All pots were kept 

at 70 % of the maximum water-holding capacity under controlled conditions in a greenhouse for one 

and three years, for the assays with L. pedunculata and C. ladanifer respectively. Plants were thinned 

to 35, 20, 5 and 3 plants per pot after 40, 60, 120 and 180 days after sowing, respectively, to minimize 

plant competition. 

 

Experimental monitoring and sample analyses 

 

Initial mine wastes and organic/inorganic wastes were analysed for: pH and electrical conductivity 

(EC) in water suspension (1:2.5 m/V), organic C (Ströhlein method), extractable P and K (Egner-

Riehm method), total N (Kjeldahl method) and total multielemental concentrations by ICP and INAA 

after acid digestion with four acids (HClO4 + HNO3 + HCl + HF; Activation Laboratories, 2014). For 

SW, biomass ashes and limestone, total C was analysed by combustion with a Leco analyser. 

At the beginning (one month of incubation) and end of assays (after one and three years of L. 

pedunculata and C. ladanifer growth, respectively), composite samples of the GW and Technosols 

from each pot and corresponding to rhizosphere system were collected. A part of these samples were 

kept fresh (4 ºC) for determination of multielemental concentration in the available fraction, while the 

remaining subsamples were air-dried for classical characterization according methodologies referred 

above. To determine the available fraction, elements were extracted from GW and Technosols 

(fraction &amp;lt;2 mm) by the rhizosphere-based method, which uses an aqueous solution at 10 mM 

mixture of organic acids (acetic acid + lactic acid + citric acid + malic acid + formic acid; Feng et al., 

2005). Also, at the end of the experiment, materials from all the treatments were also collected, in 

each 5 cm of depth, and air-dried to determinate the total concentration of elements as to the initial 

materials.  

At the end of the experiment, roots and shoots (composed of leaves and twigs) of both plant 

species were collected. Plant samples were washed with tap water and then with distilled water. After 

washing, the roots were sonicated in distilled water for 30 min. Plant samples were dried (40 ºC),

homogenised and finely ground. Elements (except N) were extracted from plant and certified 

reference samples with ultrapure concentrated nitric acid (69 %) under pressure in a microwave 

digester during 2 min at 85 ºC + 5 min at 145 ºC + 5 min at 200 ºC + 18 min at 200 ºC. Total 

concentration of N was analysed by combustion with a Leco analyser.  

The aqueous solutions corresponding to the available fraction of GW and Technosols, and plant 

extracts were stored at –18 ºC until analysed for Al, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb and Zn by 

flame atomic absorption spectrometry and As by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. In 

plant extracts was still analyse P by visible spectrophotometry using the molybdenum blue method 

(USEPA, 1979). 

 

Data analysis 

 

Data were analysed by a one way ANOVA and the Duncan test (p &amp;lt;0.05) used to separate means, 

using the statistical programme SPSS v18.0 for Windows. For statistical purposes, the results below 

the detection limit were assumed as half of the detection limit. Bivariate Pearson correlations were 

used to correlate GW or Technosols and plant characteristics (r &gt; 0.90). Quality control of the 

analyses was made by analytical replicate samples, use of certified standards solutions, reference 

bush branches and leaves samples (NCSDC73348) and blanks. The accuracy control of the total 

concentration of the elements in GW and organic/inorganic wastes is guaranteed by the standards at 

the international accredited laboratory (Actlabs, ISO/IEC 17025; Activation Laboratories). 

Three coefficients were calculated to evaluate the potential of both species for phytostabilisation 

with Technosols (Abreu et al., 2012a; Perelman, 1966): Soil-plant transfer coefficient (TransferC = 

[total shoots element]/[total soil element]), translocation coefficient (TranslC = [total shoots 

element]/[total roots element]), biological absorption coefficient (BAC = [total roots element]/[available 

soil element]). Soil-plant transfer coefficient indicates the accumulation behaviour of an element by 

plant (accumulator plants: TransferC &gt; 1; non-accumulator/excluder: TransferC &amp;lt;1). The translocation 

of an element from roots to shoots is evaluated by the translocation coefficient, while uptake capacity 

was assessed by biological absorption coefficient. Perelman (1966) classified the intensity of 

absorption by the roots in five groups: Intensive (10 &amp;lt;BAC &amp;lt;100); Strong (1 &amp;lt;BAC &amp;lt;10); 

Intermediate (0.1 &amp;lt;BAC &amp;lt;1); Weak (0.01 &amp;lt;BAC &amp;lt;0.1); Very weak (0.001 &amp;lt;BAC &amp;lt;0.01). 

 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Characterisation of the initial materials 

 

The chemical characteristics of the initial materials used in the microcosm assays are given in 

Table 2. Gossan wastes had acid pH, small EC and poor fertility characterised by very low 

concentrations of organic C and NPK. This material had great total concentrations of several 

hazardous elements, especially Al, As and Pb, and could be considered contaminated with As, Cu and 

Pb for commercial and industrial uses (CCME, 2007).

Combined rehabilitation of gossan and sulfide-rich wastes by phytostabilisation with autochthones species using Technosols

Total concentrations of As, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, S, V and Zn were within the range of those reported 

by Álvarez-Valero et al. (2008) and Pérez-López et al. (2008) to the same type of materials and also 

from São Domingos. Nonetheless, GW used in this study presented worse chemical characteristics 

(total concentrations of several hazardous elements, especially As and Pb, pH and fertility) than 

similar materials from other studies (de Varennes et al., 2010; Qu and de Varennes, 2010; Santos et 

al., 2012, 2013a, 2014b, 2015) and also collected in the same mine area. 

Sulfide-rich wastes had very acidic pH values as well as poor fertility and large EC. This mine 

waste also presented high total concentrations of several hazardous elements which were in the same 

range as those reported by several authors (Álvarez-Valero et al., 2008; Pérez-López et al., 2008; 

Santos et al., 2014c, 2015). With the exception of As and Pb, concentrations of the potentially 

hazardous elements in SW were higher than those in GW. 

All the organic and inorganic wastes (AGW, AW, CW and RW) used in the amendment mixtures 

had chemical characteristics considered favourable and safe for land application and rehabilitation of 

GW. Moreover, chemical characteristics of L and BA reflected great potential to provide a natural and 

alkaline barrier layer between the GW or Technosols and the SW, due to their buffer capacity. 

 

Chemical characterisation of the Technosols from microcosm assays 

 

The chemical characteristics of the materials from GW and Technosols in the two assays, with L. 

pedunculata and C. ladanifer growth, are given in Table 3 and Figures 2 and 3. In general, 

characteristics of the GW were improved with the amendments application (Santos et al., 2014b) even 

during longer periods of plant growth (three years of plant growth). Comparing Technosols, significant 

differences were obtained in some characteristics between application rates of the amendments but 

not concerning to amendment mixture.  

Even after only one month of incubation (beginning of the assay), it was observed an improvement 

of the Technosols structure, especially due to the incorporation of RW, which it remained until the end 

of the assays (data not shown). The incorporation of organic matter in the Technosols can also 

promote a favourable aggregation of particles and formation of granular structure (Zanuzzi et al., 

2009). Additionally, the organic matter of the amendments from Technosols is oxidized originating 

weak organic acids with some buffering capacity what can explain the significant increase of pH of 

materials (Table 3). As expected, they also increased EC, due to the increase of nutrient amounts in 

the available fraction, but these values were still small compared to the application of other 

amendments (e.g. sewage sludge, compost from the organic fraction of unsorted municipal solid 

waste; Alvarenga et al., 2008a,b; Clemente et al., 2006). 

In general, the amendments, independently of application rate and mixture, improved the fertility 

from contents very low to medium-high (INIA–LQARS, 2000). Concentrations of organic C and 

extractable P and K in the Technosols were higher than in GW (Table 3). This increase of the organic 

matter content contributed to the improvement of the water-holding capacity. The highest extractable 

K concentrations in GW at the end of the both assays are related to biomass ashes which, during the 

sampling, were slightly collected with GW. Thus, these results should not be considered as a real

difference compared to Technosols. Still concerning to extractable K, the amendments provided 

significant amounts in the beginning of the assays but, during the growth of both species, this nutrient 

was uptake by the plants. Technosols also had higher total N concentrations than GW (control) at 

beginning and after one year of L. pedunculata growth (Table 3). However, after three years of C. 

ladanifer growth, the highest total N concentration was obtained only in TB60. Taking into account that 

plants only grown in GW during approximately 40 days and the concentrations of NPK in Technosols 

where grown L. pedunculata, the results suggest that these elements remain for a significant long 

period in the Technosols and that their decrease at the end of C. ladanifer assay was possibly due to 

their uptake by plants. 

Comparing the variations of C/N over time, the ratios for the Technosols suggest that until one year 

the mineralization and decomposition of organic matter is being favoured. In fact, only after three 

years of plants growth was observed a significant increase of organic C compared to the beginning 

(beginning = end of L. pedunculata assay but beginning &amp;lt;end of C. ladanifer assay). In this period, 

C/N ratios were very high (&gt; 50) indicating that the mineralization is being very slow. 

The Technosols and growth of both species enhanced much more the fertility of materials, 

compared to the application of hydrophilic polyacrylate polymers and growth of Spergularia purpurea 

(Pearson) G. Don fil. in soils developed on gossan (Santos et al., 2013a), but not the pH, which 

attained ?7. In soils developed on gossan, after application of compost and Dactylis glomerata L. 

growth, pH only reached the maximum value of 5.9 although initial pH of the materials was 4.8 (de 

Varennes et al., 2010). In Technosols with the same composition of TA30 and TA60 but using a 

different GW and growing C. ladanifer for 15 months, the pH values were lower and fertility were quite 

different (Santos et al., 2014b) compared to the results obtained in the present study. This variation 

can be related to the heterogeneity of the organic and inorganic wastes used in the amendment 

mixture and the long experimental period (three years) of this study. It should be noticed that the GW 

used in the present study had much more extreme characteristics than similar materials referenced 

above, consequently, the result can be considered better. 

The elements concentrations in the available fraction of GW and Technosols where L. pedunculata 

and C. ladanifer were grown are given in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. Independently of treatment, 

assay and sampling, the available concentrations of Ni and V were below detection limit of apparatus 

(lesser than ?1 and ?10 mg/kg, respectively). 

In all Technosols and samplings (Figs. 2 and 3), the concentration of hazardous elements (Al and 

As) and nutrients (Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na and Zn) in the available fraction increased, while Cu and Pb 

were reduced to values below the detection limit of the apparatus compared to the GW (mg/kg; Cu ? 

GW: 1.5?2.1, Technosols: &amp;lt;1; Pb – GW: 10.0?15.6, Technosols: &amp;lt;5 mg/kg). Similar tendency was 

obtained in amended GW and soils developed on GW whose total concentrations of some elements 

are quite different (de Varennes et al., 2010; Santos et al., 2013a; 2014b). With application of biosolids 

to copper mine tailings Santibáñez et al. (2010) found higher concentration of Zn in the pore-water, as 

well as an increase on Cu concentration. This last finding is not in agreement with the results obtained 

in the present study. In a soil from the area affected by the Aznalcóllar mine accident amended with 

different wastes (alperujo, biosolid compost and sugar beet lime), the concentrations of Cu, Mn and Zn

271 

 

in the available fraction (extracted with CaCl2) were, in general, reduced (Burgos et al., 2010), which 

can be a disadvantage to the development of plants and other organisms.

Values for each parameter and sampling area followed by a different letter are significantly different (p &amp;lt;0.05). 

 

The high concentrations of Al in the available fraction are related to the incorporation of rockwool in 

the amendments mixture, which had Al in its composition, while the nutrients come particularly from

the remaining nutrient solution incorporated in the rockwool used to grow strawberry (Table 2). The 

majority of the nutrients can also derived from organic matter, although statistically only moderate 

correlation was obtained (0.66 &amp;lt;r &amp;lt;0.80, depending on element, sampling and assay).  

The effect of organic matter in the mobilization or immobilization of the elements depends on their 

characteristics (Bolan et al., 2014). Santibáñez et al. (2010) attributed the high availability of elements 

in amended substrates to the increase of dissolved organic C amounts released from organic 

amendments decomposition. However, organic matter from Technosols can also have increased the 

cationic exchange capacity and promoted the formation of complexes with some cations (Adriano et 

al., 2004; Bolan et al., 2014; Kumpiene et al., 2008) justifying the reduction of Cu and Pb (GW: 

1.5?2.1 mg Cu/kg and 10?15.6 mg Pb/kg depending on assay and sampling) of more than 15 % and 

45 % respectively (although obtaining moderate correlations). Several authors (Alvarenga et al., 

2008a, 2008b; Burgos et al., 2010) ascribed the decrease on the Cu and/or Pb concentrations in the 

available fraction of acid and metal-contaminated soils to the application of organic amendments (e.g. 

sewage sludge or biosolid compost) to these soils. Besides, pH can affect availability of Cu and Pb, 

however no strong relationship was obtained between pH and the available concentrations of these 

elements. This fact was also observed in other studies (Alvarenga et al., 2008a, 2008b; Burgos et al., 

2010; Santos et al., 2013a). 

The increase of As can be related to the inhibition of the formation of some solid phases with low 

solubility (e.g. metal arsenates) (Abreu et al., 2009; Santos et al., 2012). The increase of dissolved 

organic C in the rhizosphere due to exudation of low molecular weight organic acids by roots and/or 

organic wastes from amendment mixtures may also justify the increase of As availability in the 

Technosols (Bolan et al., 2014; Feng et al., 2005; Kumpiene et al., 2008; Tu et al., 2004). In fact, 

some root exudates or even specific low molecular-weight organic acids can release As from 

arsenates (Tu et al., 2004) and metal oxi-hydroxides (Zhang et al., 2005). 

Comparing the effect of the amendments on the GW to make the Technosols, no significant 

differences were obtained between available concentrations of K, Mg, Mn and Na according on 

amendment mixture and application rate at beginning of the assays and the control, whereas the 

same occurred for Al, K, Mg, Na and Zn at the end of the two assays. For the other elements and in all 

sampling periods, the application rate altered the concentrations of the elements in the available 

fraction having, in general, the highest amounts with application of 60 g/kg of amendments. 

Exceptions were observed for Al, As, Fe and Zn in the beginning of the assay (after one month of 

incubation), where a combined effect can have occurred with the type and amount of the organic 

matter because there is no clear trend in the application rate and amendment mixture. It should be 

further highlighted the variation of the available concentrations of As and Fe among Technosols 

according to the species (and possibly duration of the assay). Thus after one year of L. pedunculata 

growth, Fe concentrations were similar among Technosols (108.2?134.8 mg/kg depending on 

treatment) while the highest As values were obtained in the Technosols at 60 g/kg of amendments 

(mg/kg ? TA60: 6.1; TB60: 6.8; TA30: 4.5; TB30: 3.4). However, the opposite was verified after three 

years of C. ladanifer growth (mg/kg – As: 3.6?4.4, depending on treatment; Fe: TA60: 219.9; TB60: 

201.6; TA30: 180.0; TB30: 177.3).

Fig. 3 Effects of treatments (gossan wastes and Technosols) on the concentration of the elements in the available fraction at the beginning (after one month of incubation) and 

end of the assay with Cistus ladanifer (after three years of plants growth) (mean ± SD; n = 4). Values from same sampling period followed by a different letter are significantly 

different (p &amp;lt;0.05). 



Combined rehabilitation of gossan and sulfide-rich wastes by phytostabilisation with autochthones species using Technosols 

275 

 

In general, concentrations of the elements in the available fraction increased over time in GW 

(control), possibly by the speed-up of the materials weathering due to irrigation. However in the 

Technosols, this tendency was only observed in some cases (e.g. Zn in both plants assays; Ca and 

Fe in L. pedunculata assay). In fact, the amendments provided sufficient nutrients amounts to support 

the plant growth (and all microbial community) and keep the stable concentrations over time. 

Concentrations of the potentially hazardous elements (Al and As) increased from the beginning till one 

year, but after that showed a tendency to be constant (except As in TA30 and TA60 and Al in T60B). 

Although GW had large total concentrations of Al, As, and Pb, the amounts of these elements 

potentially available for the plants and microorganisms in the Technosols were lesser than 1 % of the 

total concentrations, which represent a small potential environmental risk. Nonetheless, the increase 

of organic C and nutrients availability and their permanence in the soil system during longer periods is 

an advantage for the rehabilitation process. 

In general, no clear improvement of the chemical characteristics of Technosols was observed both 

with amendment mixture and/or application rate. 

 

Germination and growth of Lavandula pedunculata and Cistus ladanifer 

 

Germination of both plant species was stimulated in the Technosols, compared to GW (Table 4). 

Approximately 40 days after sowing, seedlings of L. pedunculata (?4 cm height) and C. ladanifer (?3 

cm height) growing in GW and without visible symptoms of nutritional deficiency or phytotoxicity died. 

This fact is not in agreement with the results obtained by Santos et al. (2014b) in which C. ladanifer 

survived (with a very small development) for 505 days in a gossan waste also collected in São 

Domingos mine area but with better chemical characteristics than GW used in the present study. 

Nonetheless, in a mesocosm assay with soils developed on gossan materials and considerable 

quantity of host rocks (i.e. also with less extreme conditions than the GW studied) was observed 

germination of C. ladanifer in control but not of Lavandula sampaioana (Rozeira) Rivas Mart., T.E. 

Díaz &amp;amp; Fern. Gonz. But the mortality was also very high in both species (Santos et al., 2013a). The 

improvement of the structure and water holding capacity, due to the amendments in the Technosols, 

can explain the higher germination rate of both species in the present study. Moreover, these 

parameters of the materials combined with the increase of nutrients and organic C (Figs. 2 and 3, and 

Table 3) can justify the survival and great plant growth during all assays in the Technosols.

Biomass ashes from bottom of the Technosols can also supply several nutrients to the plants (Ram 

and Masto, 2010; Su and Wong, 2003) ensuring their growth for long periods. The fertility of the 

materials is considered the parameter with major importance for the success of phytostabilisation, 

especially in the early stages of plant growth (Tordoff et al., 2000). However the success of 

phytostabilization of mine wastes, especially those located in areas with Mediterranean climate, 

depends on a combined effect of several characteristics (e.g. hydric stress). 

The growth stimulation of different herbaceous (e.g. D . glomerata, Lolium multiflorum Lam and 

Lolium perenne L.) and shrubs (e.g. C. ladanifer and Erica australis L.) in microcosm assays under 

controlled conditions (Alvarenga et al., 2008a, 2008b; de Varennes et al., 2010; Qu and de Varennes, 

2010; Santibáñez et al., 2008; Santos et al., 2013a, 2014b) as well as spontaneous vegetation in the 

field (Pérez-de-Mora et al., 2011) in contaminated soils/mine wastes after different amendments 

application is reported. None of the other characteristics of the Technosols (Figs. 2 and 3, and Table 

3) seem to affect negatively the plants growth. 

Although Technosols with high application rates of amendments had greater concentrations of 

organic C and nutrients (e.g. total N and extractable P; Table 3), no significant variation was observed 

in height and fresh shoots biomass of L. pedunculata (Table 5). Even for fresh roots biomass, it was 

only observed a slight variation according to application rate of the amendments in spite of plants from 

TB30 have reached the smallest values.

In the assay with C. ladanifer, the plant growth was during a longer period (three years) so, even 

being used big pots, the inner space of the pot can have limited the development of the radicular 

system. Nevertheless the height and, especially, fresh shoots biomass indicated greater plant 

development in Technosols with the highest application rate of amendments. This results are in 

agreement with those reported by Santos et al. (2014b) for 15 months of C. ladanifer growth in

another amended gossan, as well as with other plant species also growing in a soil developed on 

other gossan presenting different characteristics (de Varennes et al., 2010; Qu and de Varennes, 

2010). 

 

Multielementar composition of Lavandula pedunculata and Cistus ladanifer 

Potentially hazardous elements 

 

The behaviour of the two studied species in the absorption, translocation and accumulation of the 

potentially hazardous elements was similar. However, the concentrations of the elements in the roots 

ad shoots depended on species (Fig. 4). The uptake (evaluated by the biological absorption 

coefficient) was, mainly, strong for Al (L. pedunculata: 4?15; C. ladanifer: 0.3?6) and intensive for As 

and Pb (BACAs: 7?97; BACPb: 56?381, depending on species). After absorption, and, as a tolerance 

mechanism (Kabata-Pendias, 2011), these elements were stored in their roots (TranslC &amp;lt;0.3). 

No significant differences were obtained among the concentrations of Al in roots (849.3?1222.9 

mg/kg) and As and Pb in shoots mg/kg; 5.6?10.7 and 17.4?27.2, respectively) of L. pedunculata from 

different Technosols. The highest concentrations of As and Pb in roots of this species were reached in 

TA30 (130.1 mg As/kg and 459.4 mg Pb/kg) which were the double of the values determined in the 

plants from the other Technosols (55.5?72.4 mg As/kg and 229.7?279.9 mg Pb/kg, depending on 

treatment). Slight variation of Al concentrations in shoots was observed, however L. pedunculata 

growing in Technosols with high amendments application rates showed a tendency to have higher 

values (mg/kg ? TA60: 153.4; TB60: 178.2; TA30: 99.1; TB30: 112.0). In C. ladanifer, the 

concentrations of the studied potentially hazardous elements in roots and shoots were similar 

independently of the Technosol where they grow. Despite of the variations in the elements 

concentrations in the available fraction of the different Technosols (Figs. 2 and 3), no relationship was 

found between this soil characteristic and the concentrations of the potentially hazardous elements in 

roots or shoots of both species. 

Phytotoxic concentrations of the elements in shoots were only reached and exceeded for As (5 

mg/kg; Kabata-Pendias, 2011) for: L. pedunculata from all Technosols and C. ladanifer from 

Technosols containing residue from liquor distillation of C. siliqua fruit (TB30 and TB60). However, no 

visual symptoms of toxicity were observed in the two species. In L. pedunculata a possible synergism 

effect of Pb in shoots can explain these phytotoxic values of As (r = 0.99). Both species were non-

accumulators of the studied hazardous elements. 

In spite of the variability intra and inter-population of C. ladanifer growing in mine wastes and/or 

soils developed on mine wastes in natural conditions (Santos et al., 2012, 2014a and references 

therein), the plants obtained in this study, under controlled conditions, showed a similar behaviour on 

the translocation and accumulation, being the elements concentrations in the same range than the 

field. Regarding L. pedunculata, lower concentrations of As and Pb in shoots were also reported for 

plants growing in mining areas from Rio Tinto region (de la Fuente et al., 2010) and serpentine area 

from NE of Portugal (Freitas et al., 2004b).

Fig. 4 Effects of the Technosols on the concentration of the potentially hazardous elements in the roots and

a different letter are significantly different (p &amp;lt;0.05). 

 

Nutrients 

 

In general, the plants uptake capacity of the nutrients, evaluated by the biological absorption 

coefficient, was strong and intensive but depended on the species having in some cases variability 

intra-treatment. The absorption of Ca, Ni and P was mainly strong in L. pedunculata (BAC: 3?27, 

depending on element and treatment) and the same uptake capacity for Ca, Fe, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni and P

(BAC: 1?32, depending on element and treatment) was observed in C. ladanifer. The other nutrients 

presented intensive uptake (L. pedunculata: Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Na and Zn; C. ladanifer: Cu and K). 

Plant of both species showed some variability in the translocation behaviour of the nutrients even 

growing in same treatment, however a clear tendency can be indicated for each species (Figs. 5?8). 

Variation of the translocation behaviour of some elements can be observed in several species growing 

spontaneously in mining areas from IPB (Abreu et al., 2012a, 2012b; Pérez-López et al., 2014; Santos 

et al., 2012, 2014a). Both species translocated, mainly, from roots to shoots K, N and P (TranslC: 

0.5?4.5 depending on element, species and treatment) while Cu, Fe, Na and Ni were stored in the 

roots. Cistus ladanifer still translocated Ca, Mg and Zn but L. pedunculata stored these nutrients in 

their roots (TranslC ? L. pedunculata: 0.4?1.2; C. ladanifer: 1.0?13.4, depending on element and 

treatment). The opposite occurred for Mn being stored in roots of C. ladanifer (TranslC: 0.3?1.8, 

depending on treatment) but translocated in L. pedunculata (TranslC: 1.8?7.2, depending on 

treatment). 

Concentrations of the nutrients in roots and shoots also varied with species (Figs. 5?8) being the 

combined effect of the uptake, accumulation in roots, translocation from roots to shoots, a tolerance 

capacity and, possibly, nutritional requirements. As for the available fraction of the elements (Figs. 2 

and 3, and Table 3), no clear tendency was obtained among the plants from different Technosols. In 

fact, only in L. pedunculata shoots from Technosols containing 60 g/kg of amendments showed the 

highest Mg concentrations (mg/kg ? TA60: 2.1; TB60: 1.9), compared to plants growing in a Technosol 

with half of the amendment dose (?1.3 mg/kg). Moreover, independently of the Technosol, no 

significant differences were obtained among concentrations of Ca, Mn and Na in roots and shoots and 

Cu, Fe, N, P and Zn in shoots of L. pedunculata. The same was observed in C. ladanifer for Ca, Cu in 

shoots, Na and Ni in roots and K, Mg, N, P and Zn in roots and shoots. No relationship was obtained 

between nutrients concentrations in roots or shoots of the two species and the respective available 

fractions of the elements in the Technosols. 

Although C. ladanifer had presented an effective uptake capacity of Cu and Mn, their storage in 

roots (or low translocation) can contribute, to some extent, to the deficient concentrations of these 

elements in the shoots. Thus, C. ladanifer shoots from all the Technosols presented deficient Cu 

concentrations (&amp;lt;5 mg/kg; Kabata-Pendias, 2011) but, only shoots from Technosols containing A. 

unedo residue had deficiency of Mn (&amp;lt;30 mg/kg; Adriano, 2001; Kabata-Pendias, 2011).The great 

translocation of Mn in L. pedunculata from all the Technosols and Zn in plants from the Technosols at 

30 g/kg amendments application can explain the concentrations of these elements in the shoots, 

which are considered phytotoxic or above the normal/sufficient (&gt; 400 mg Mn/kg and &gt; 150 mg Zn/kg; 

Kabata-Pendias, 2011). None synergism or antagonism effect between elements was statistically 

obtained, allowing to explain these anomalous concentrations in shoots of both species. Moreover, in 

any case, the plants did not show visual symptoms of deficiency or toxicity indicated by several 

authors (Adriano, 2001; Kabata-Pendias, 2011). Concentrations of the remaining nutrients in the 

shoots of the two species reached values considered normal/sufficient and/or below the phytotoxicity 

for the majority of the plant species (Adriano, 2001; Kabata-Pendias, 2011). In C. ladanifer a possible 

synergism effect of As in shoots can occur with Fe (r = 0.91).

micronutrients. Exception was obtained for Na in L. pedunculata, which presented accumulation 

behaviour in all the Technosols (TransferC: 0.6?1.8), while C. ladanifer was non-accumulator of Na 

(TransferC &amp;lt;0.9). 

Variability intra and inter-population of ecological behaviours and/or elements concentrations in the 

two studied species growing spontaneously in mining areas are reported by several authors (de la 

Fuente et al., 2010; Freitas et al., 2004b; Santos et al., 2012, 2014a and references therein). 

Differences in the concentrations of some nutrients obtained in this study can related to seasonal and 

temporal variations in plants and the analysed plant part. The lower nutrients concentrations in plants 

growing in the Technosols, compared to plants from the field, can be attributed to the high availability 

of nutrients in the substrata. 

 

Efficiency of the combined rehabilitation system 

 

The Technosols studied ensure the germination and good vegetative development of the species, 

C. ladaniferand L. pedunculata. Biomass ashes from the barrier located in the bottom of the 

Technosols can supply some macro- and micronutrients (Table 2) to the plants and minimize their 

drought stress due to its significant water holding capacity (Ram and Masto, 2010). The plants did not 

show visual signs of phytotoxicity and/or deficiency of any elements, independently of the Technosols 

where grown. 

The species studied had sustainable characteristics/behaviours (high uptake of potentially 

hazardous elements, indicated by BAC; storage of hazardous elements in the roots, indicated by 

TranslC; non-accumulator behaviour of potentially hazardous elements, indicated by TransfC; good 

ground cover; perennial; deeply root system), to their use in phytostabilisation programs of mine 

wastes. All these characteristics are reported by Mendez and Maier (2008) as the main requirements 

for a sustainable phytoremediation program. The referred behaviours of the studied plants were 

similar to those of the same species growing in natural conditions. Additionally, elements 

concentrations obtained in the shoots from plants growing in the Technosols (Figs. 4?8) were under 

the metal toxicity limits for domestic animals (NCR, 2005) that, occasionally, stay in São Domingos 

mining area (cattle and sheep). So, the implementation of a phytostabilisation program with the 

studied Technosols and the cultivation of both plant species do not pose any environmental risk. 

Phytostabilisation programs have low costs of installation and maintenance. Although the available 

fractions of the majority of the nutrients were not different among Technosols, the application of the 

high amendments dose to the GW highly improved some of its chemical characteristics, as is the case 

of: concentration of organic C; extractable P; Mn in L. pedunculata assay and Ca in C. ladanifer assay 

(Figs. 2 and 3, and Table 3). Thus, the conception of a Technosol with the high amendments dose can 

reflect a significant difference in the economic cost of the phytostabilisation process, even only 

considering the transportation of organic/inorganic wastes. Nonetheless the present study, as well as 

others done with same species and similar mine wastes (Santos et al., 2014b, 2015), showed that the 

Technosols containing more amounts of amendments mixture can guarantee the sustainability of the

rehabilitation process during longer periods. Additionally, the improvement of the fertility was sufficient 

to increase the growth of the two studied species which have a significant economic value to cosmetic 

and pharmaceutical (Barrajón-Catalán et al., 2010; Cavanagh and Wilkinson, 2002) as well as other 

industrial purposes like cleaning products or pellets. Therefore, the increase of the shoots biomass 

production can contribute to a greater economic income and, consequently, the recovery of the 

rehabilitation cost. It is essential the assessment of the public safety risk of these products derived 

from contaminated areas. 

The usual rehabilitation strategy of tailings, especially those composed of reactive minerals like 

sulfides, involves the covering. According to Santos et al. (2014c, 2015), the maintenance of moist SW 

from São Domingos mine generates very acidic aqueous leachates containing several elements, 

which ascend to the surface by capillarity during the hot periods and then originates several crystals, 

which can be more or less readily dissolved after wetting. The barrier between the sulfide wastes (SW) 

and the Technosols, composed of limestone and biomass ashes, which was tested in this study, 

neutralized the acidic solutions and provided an efficient alternative in the SW coverage and, 

consequently, reduction of its oxidation. The absence of salt efflorescences on the surface of the 

materials (GW or Technosols) and maintenance of pH values in biomass ashes and surface materials 

(Table 6) confirm the absence of this process.  

In general, precipitation of secondary solid phases on the surface of limestone can form a coating 

that limit or avoid the interaction with the adjacent aqueous solution (Pérez-López et al., 2007; Santos 

et al., 2014c). However, in the present study the combined use of limestone and the biomass ashes 

seems to extend the efficiency of the alkalinity potential of the barrier, especially of the limestone. This 

barrier still contributed to buffer SW materials even for three years due to, possibly, eluviation of small 

particles of biomass ashes and lixiviation of carbonates, especially, from limestone and biomass 

ashes. In fact, pH values of SW located below the barrier were more than twice (Control: 3.8; TA30: 

4.7; TA60: 3.7; TB30: 4.6; TB60: 3.5) the initial value of SW (Table 2). Laboratory experiments 

conducted by Pérez-López et al. (2009) show that the microencapsulation of pyrite-rich sludge by 

formation of Fe-coatings, due to fly ashes effect, inhibited sulfide oxidation.  

Both materials from the barrier also lead to the retention of Al, As, Cu, Fe, Na, Pb, S and Zn 

resulting in the significant increase of their concentrations (Table 6) compared to the initial values 

(Table 2). Precipitation as metal-oxyhydroxides and/or carbonates, as a result of the increase of pH, 

can be the main mechanism of immobilisation of those elements when acidic aqueous solutions 

ascend from SW. In fact, several authors stated that amending contaminated wastes with liming 

materials and fly ashes reduce the availability of several elements (Bolan et al., 2014; Pérez-López et 

al., 2007; Ram and Masto, 2010; Su and Wong, 2003). Additional advantage of biomass ashes in the 

system is the formation of Fe-oxyhydroxides as a result of ash-aqueous solutions interactions (Ram 

and Masto, 2010), which are important components for absorption and fixation of some elements, 

namely As (Bolan et al., 2014; Kabata-Pendias, 2011; Kumpiene et al., 2008). At end of one and three 

years, it was not observed any hardpan formation in the contact zone between the barrier and SW as 

described by Pérez-López et al. (2007) in a column assay where a top layer of fly ashes covers pyritic 

sludge.

Combined rehabilitation of gossan and sulfide-rich wastes by phytostabilisation with autochthones species using Technosols 

287 

 

The tested composed barrier has the advantage of being porous, allowing the rainwater leaching 

and reducing the flow along the barrier. Biomass ashes had also a significant moisture retention and 

water-holding capacity (Ram and Masto, 2010) reducing the leaching to deeper layers and, 

consequently, sulfides oxidation. This fact can still be improved by the plant development in the 

Technosols covering the barrier and forming the top layer of the entire system, which increases the 

evapotranspiration decreasing the water infiltration (Tordoff et al., 2000). Indeed, SW layer in control 

treatment (GW without plant due to plant death) was moister than those in treatments with Technosols 

and plant growth (data not shown). 

 

CONCLUSION 

 

The system of combined rehabilitation of gossan and sulfide-rich wastes was efficient and 

sustainable for long-term. The study demonstrated that the components of the barrier (limestone + 

biomass ashes) stabilise the sulfide wastes decreasing/preventing their oxidation and the ascension of 

the acid solutions rich in elements. Moreover this system allowed the rehabilitation of the sulfide rich 

wastes, which are not naturally colonized by vegetation, decreasing their erosion and generation of 

acid drainage. However, the top layer of gossan wastes without amendments addition (control) was 

not adequate to support the plants growth. The conception of Technosols is crucial to the 

implementation of the phytostabilisation programs in gossan wastes. In fact, Technosols made with 

gossan and agro-industrial wastes improved the chemical characteristics of the materials allowing the 

germination and establishment of Cistus ladanifer and Lavandula pedunculata. These plant species 

presented good development and ecological behaviours (uptake, translocation and accumulation) 

adequate to their use in this rehabilitation system. Co-cropping of the two plant species with 

contrasting nutritional abilities could improve phytostabilisation efficiency. The high biomass yields of 

both species can contribute with economic income due to their potential use in several industries. 

Assessment and monitoring should be made in order to ensure that toxic substances are not 

transferred to the plant-based products. Next step should be the implementation of the system in the 

field in order to confirm their efficacy under Mediterranean climate conditions.

ABSTRACT  

 

The aim of this study was to evaluate the chemical characteristics and ecotoxicity of a mine soil 

developed on gossan materials and amended with hydrophilic polyacrylate polymers after a growth 

cycle of Spergularia purpurea. Different acute bioassays (Daphnia magna immobilization; microalgae 

growth inhibition; germination and growth of lettuce and oat) were carried out with simulated 

leachates, pore water and soil samples. The germination and growth of native shrubs (Cistus ladanifer 

and Lavandula sampaioana were also evaluated in the lysimeters where S. purpurea had grown. 

The soil had high total concentrations (g/kg) of Al (3.50–8.60), As (2.55–2.73), Cu (0.13–0.91) and Pb 

(4.48–6.16). However, the percentages of elements in aqueous extracts (simulating leachates, pore 

water, and the conditions of the rhizosphere soil) were small when compared to their total soil 

concentrations (less than 9 % except for Na in leachates). Growth of S. purpurea and other natural 

colonization of plant species (Poaceae, Fabaceae and Asteraceae families) improved chemical 

characteristics but the application of the polyacrylate polymers contributed to a further improvement of 

soil quality. However, this was not sufficient to ensure the growth of a large number of shrubs despite 

a great germination rate. 

Among the several species used on the ecotoxicological assessment, the D. magna test was the only 

bioassay that showed a clear toxicity of soil leachates, suggesting the importance of using several 

ecotoxicological tests to assess the environmental risk of soil contamination and its rehabilitation. 

Although the studied soil can be considered contaminated taking into account the total soil 

concentrations of Al, As, Cu and Pb, the low concentrations of the same chemical elements in 

extractable solutions, that simulated the fractions really available for organisms, did not demonstrate a 

substantial toxic effects in the organisms and, consequently, negative impact on the environment.

INTRODUCTION  

 

Abandoned mining areas are a significant problem in the Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB). São Domingos is 

an abandoned copper mine located in the Portuguese part of the IPB (SE of Portugal) that is said to 

present a high environmental risk (Matos and Martins, 2006). Weathering of the sulfides-rich 

mineralization was responsible for the generation of a significant gossan, which was intensely 

exploited in Roman times. Modern exploitation (middle of the XIX century until 1960) occurred in both 

gossan and massive sulfides containing As, Cu, Pb and Zn (Quental et al., 2002). The mining wastes 

generated, over the long period of extraction and transformation of the ore, represent an important 

source of acidity and of several trace elements with the consequent contamination of adjacent areas, 

including superficial waters and soils/sediments/host rocks (Abreu et al., 2010; Álvarez-Valero et al., 

2008). 

A large amount of organic and inorganic wastes are produced daily and disposed of in landfills, 

although several wastes can be used for the rehabilitation of degraded and contaminated areas, due 

to their chemical composition, provided they are available in sufficient amounts and close to the target 

area (Macías, 2004). 

Large quantities of hygiene products (diapers, paper towels, feminine products) containing 

polyacrylate polymers are used and they occupy a large volume in landfills. However, this type of 

wastes was shown to increase the growth of grasses and enhance some soil enzymatic activities (Al-

Humaid and Moftah, 2007; Boatright et al., 1997; de Varennes et al., 1999; Guiwei et al., 2008; Qu 

and de Varennes, 2010). Moreover, due to the increase of the water-holding capacity of the soil, the 

use of these polymers can be especially useful in soils in the Mediterranean region as the risk of 

drought is high and periods without rain are frequent (Silberbush et al., 1993). 

Total soil concentrations of chemical elements are used as guidelines to establish whether a soil 

should be considered as contaminated, although only the elements in soil solution and/or 

exchangeable positions associated with inorganic and organic colloids are bioavailable (Adriano, 

2001; Kabata-Pendias, 2011). Thus, in remediation processes it is important to determine the 

concentrations of chemical elements in soil leachates and available fractions (extracted with several 

aqueous solutions: buffered and unbuffered salt solutions, acid solutions, chelating agents, etc.; 

Kabata-Pendias, 2004). The evaluation of ecotoxicological effects of the application of amendments 

should also be carried out, as chemical analysis per se is insufficient to evaluate potential ecological 

risks (van Gestel et al., 2001). 

Any strategy to assess the potential risk of a soil should include tests with organisms of different 

trophic levels, from the terrestrial and aquatic compartments (Bagur-González et al., 2011; García-

Lorenzo et al., 2009; Knoke et al., 1999). Bioassays with vascular plants offer a variety of advantages 

to evaluate soil toxicity, allowing the assessment of a large array of parameters that can be affected by 

hazardous elements (Ferrari et al., 1999; van Gestel et al., 2001). Bioassays using aquatic organisms 

have been used to evaluate the ecotoxicity in several ecosystems (Cerejeira et al., 1998; Pereira et 

al., 2000; Silva et al., 2012) even in mining areas from IPB (Alvarenga et al., 2012, 2008; Rocha et al., 

2011).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the chemical characteristics and ecotoxicity of a soil 

developed on gossan materials after amendment with hydrophilic polyacrylate polymers and growth of 

Spergularia purpurea (Pearson) G. Don fil..The natural colonization by herbaceous species and, 

germination and development of native shrub species (Cistus ladanifer L. and Lavandula sampaiona 

(Rozeira) Rivas Mart., T.E. Díaz &amp;amp; Fern.Gonz.) were also evaluated to better understand the post-

rehabilitation period. 

 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Sampling area 

 

The sampling area was located within the São Domingos mining area, to the north of the open pit 

(37º40’N, 70º30’W), where soils were developed on gossan materials and host rocks (Spolic 

Technosol Toxic; IUSS Working Group WRB, 2007). The vegetation present on the site included 

Cistus ladanifer, Cistus salviifolius L., Lavandula luisieri (Rozeira) Rivas-Mart?nez, Lavandula 

sampaioana, Erica australis L. and many herbaceous species. About 1000 kg of the top soil (0–20 cm) 

was collected in 2009 to be used in a mesocosm experiment. The soil was sandy and about 52 % 

consisted of host rock fragments coarser than 2 mm.  

 

Mesocosm experiment 

 

The experiment was performed in lysimeters (50 cm long with a diameter of 60 cm) with unsieved 

mine soil in four treatments (three replicates each): (1) control without polymer; (2) soil amended with 

25 diapers cut into 5 cm pieces and incorporated into the top 25 cm of the soil (about 0.3 % m/m of 

polyacrylate polymer); (3) soil amended with the polyacrylate polymer removed from 25 diapers; and 

(4) soil amended with a polyacrylate polymer synthesized by Marion Roussel Ltd (polymer 7015) 

applied at the same rate as before. The preparation of the mesocosm experiment and the 

establishment of an indigenous grass (Spergularia purpurea) from the São Domingos area are 

described in detail by Qu and de Varennes (2010). Briefly, 2 L of synthetic urine was added to each 

lysimeter and, after two weeks of incubation, 10 L of deionized water per week was added during one 

month to simulate rainfall. After growth of S. purpurea (from April until early June 2009), the soil was 

left bare during the summer and then used for the present experiment. 

Composite soils samples from the 0–7 cm layer were collected from each lysimeter (nine 

subsamples per lysimeter). Seeds of C. ladanifer (after a pre-treatment at 100 ºC for 30 minutes; 

Corral et al., 1990), and L. sampaioana, collected in the São Domingos mine in 2009, were sown (0.5 

g of each species per lysimeter) in the lysimeters (October of 2009) immediately after soil sampling. 

Germination and growth of both shrubs were monitored over a 10 months period. Spontaneous 

species were also identified and their total fresh biomass evaluated at the end of the experiment.

Soil characterization 

 

Initial soil, collected in the mine, and soil samples from each treatment were air-dried, 

homogenized and sieved. The soil fraction with particles less than 2 mm was characterized for 

(Póvoas and Barral, 1992): pH and electric conductivity (EC) in a water suspension (1:2.5 m/V); 

extractable K and P (Egner-Riehm method); total N (Kjeldahl method) and organic C by wet 

combustion. Nitric and ammoniacal N (Mulvaney, 1996) and Fe from total iron oxides (Tamm reagent 

with UV radiation; de Endredy, 1963) and from non-crystalline iron oxides (Tamm reagent in the dark; 

Schwertmann, 1964) were also determined. 

Total concentrations of Al, As, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, S, Pb, Zn from initial soil (fraction &amp;lt;2 

mm) were determined using ICP-OES and INAA, after acid digestion (perchloric acid + nitric acid + 

hydrochloric acid + hydrofluoric acid) in an international certified laboratory (Actlabs, ISO/IEC 17025, 

Activation Laboratories, 2012). The same chemical elements were analysed in three aqueous 

extractable solutions that simulated: leachates, the soil solution in the pore water, and the solution 

from rizosphere soil (RHIZO solution). 

The leachates and pore waters were obtained at room temperature in a rotatory shaker in a solid-

to-water ratio of 1:10 (m/V) during 24 h and five days (aerated daily), respectively (DIN 38414-S4, 

1984; Buján et al., 2010). Then, these extractable solutions were filtrated under vacuum (&amp;lt;0.45 µm), 

and the pH and EC were measured. The RHIZO solution was extracted with an aqueous diluted 

solution containing a mixture of organic acids (acetic acid + lactic acid + citric acid + malic acid + 

formic acid) after 16 h of agitation (Rhizosphere-based method, Feng et al., 2005). The filtrates were 

stored at –18 ºC until analysis for Al, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Pb and Zn by flame atomic absorption 

spectrometry; As by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry; chlorides, nitrates and sulfates 

by ion chromatography; and phosphates by visible spectrophotometry by the molybdenum blue 

method (USEPA, 1979). 

 

Bioassays 

 

Ecotoxicological evaluation of the leachates (indirect bioassays) was performed using two plant 

species (dicot – Lactuca sativa L. var. crispa L. cv. Great Lakes 118, and monocot – Avena sativa L. 

cv. Santa Eulália), a microalgae (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (Korshikov) Hindak) and a 

microcrustacean (Daphnia magna Straus). These bioassays evaluated the toxicity risk of the soil to 

adjacent areas by acting as a source of contamination (van Gestel et al., 2001). The same 

ecotoxicological tests were carried out on the soil with the same plant species to evaluate the soil 

matrix effect (direct bioassay). 

 

Plants 

 

Toxicity towards plants was assessed in accordance with the OECD Guideline 208 (OECD 208, 

2006) by evaluating the effects on visual aspects, germination, root and shoot elongation and fresh

biomass of both plant species, following the exposure of the seeds and seedlings to moistened soil or 

leachates. Three bioassays were carried out: a filter paper test, a soil test and a hydroponic test. The 

seeds used were surface-sterilized in 10 % Na-hypochlorite solution for 20 min to prevent fungal 

growth and then washed with distilled water (Salvatore et al., 2008). 

In one plant bioassay, three layers of filter paper (140 mm Watman No. 1 filter) were put on the 

bottom of glass beakers (100 mL) and moistened with 5 mL of leachate from each treatment (Filter 

paper test; Salvatore et al., 2008). Deionised water was used as the negative control. In a second 

bioassay, 15 g of the soil samples (fraction &amp;lt;2 mm) were put in each glass beaker (Soil test; Martí et 

al., 2007). 

Seven seeds of lettuce and five seeds of oat per replicate were placed in each beaker and then 

incubated in a growth chamber under controlled conditions (25 ± 1 ºC; 16 h light/ 8 h darkness). The 

filters and soils were kept moist and the germinated seeds were periodically counted during 15 days. 

The criterion of germination was the emergence of a radicle through the seed coat. Length of roots 

and shoots and fresh biomass were measured at the end of the experiment. 

In a third bioassay (hydroponic test), lettuce and oat seeds were germinated in the dark at 25 ºC for 

7 days and seedlings with a seminal root length of 50–80 mm and 15 mm respectively, (shoot length 

of 2–4 mm for lettuce and 30–50 mm for oat) were selected. Seedlings (seven of lettuce and five of 

oat in each replicate) were grown in beakers filled with 50 mL of leachates from the different 

treatments. The seedlings were supported by a thin and flexible plastic net placed on the top of each 

beaker, so that only the roots were immersed in the leachate. After 15 days of growth in the same 

conditions as before, the biological parameters described above were evaluated. 

 

Microalgae and microcrustacean 

 

Microalgae toxicity was assessed by measuring the growth inhibition of P. subcapitata exposed to 

leachates (100 % of concentration V/V) for 72 h, according to the AlgalToxKit FTM test procedure 

(MicroBioTests, 2004) that follows the OECD guideline 201 (OCDE, 1984). The microalgae was 

available as immobilized algal beads and 1 h prior to the test a concentrated algal inoculum of 1 x 106 

algae/mL was prepared by de-immobilization of the algal beads by adding “Matrix dissolving Medium” 

and shaking vigorously every 2 min till complete dissolution. The test was performed using three 

replicates of all leachates on disposable 10 cm-long spectrophotometer cells (25 mL). At the end of 

the test, the total growth inhibition percentage was determined by converting optical densities 

(spectrophotometer with a 670 nm filter) into algal numbers using an exponential model. The 

microalgae test data analysis was performed through the determination of the average specific growth 

rate for each treatment followed by the calculation of the percentage inhibition (% I) for each test batch 

according to internationally accepted procedures (ISO 8692, 2004). 

The microcrustacean acute toxicity was determined by the immobilisation of D. magna exposed to 

leachates for 48 h according to the bioassay procedure (MicroBio-Tests, 2000). The test organisms 

were hatched for 72 h at 20–22 ºC under continuous illumination of 6000 lux prior to the test 

performance from “dormant eggs (ephippia)”. At the beginning of the test, the young Daphnids

(neonates) were less than 24 h old. As for the microalgae test, all leachates from the mesocosm 

experiment were evaluated for their percentage of total effect using four replicates. At the end of the 

test, the immobilization percentages were calculated according to ISO 6341 (1996). 

 

Data analysis 

 

Data were analysed by a one way ANOVA and the Tukey test (p &amp;lt;0.05) used to separate means, 

using the statistical programme SPSS v18.0 for Windows. For statistical purposes, the results below 

the detection limit were assumed as half of the detection limit. Bivariate Pearson correlations were 

used to correlate the soil and plant characteristics (r &gt; 0.80). Quality control of the analysis was made 

by analytical replicate samples, use of certified standards solution and laboratory standards at the 

Activation Laboratories. All the analyses were performed in triplicate, except the total concentration of 

the chemical elements in initial soil which was done in duplicate. 

The data from the bioassays using the leachates, the filter paper and both plant species were used 

to calculate two toxicity indexes reported by Bagur-González et al. (2011). The indexes can vary from 

?1 (maximum phytotoxicity) to &gt; 0. 

 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Soil characterization 

 

Initial soil from the São Domingos mine (before the mesocosm experiment) had chemical 

characteristics (Table 1) that are explained by the source materials and that can be considered as 

moderately extreme when compared to others gossan materials from this mining area (Abreu et al., 

2012a,b; Santos et al., 2012) or contaminated soils from other mining areas in the IPB (Abreu et al., 

2012a,b; Alvarenga et al., 2008; Rocha et al., 2011). Thus, initial soil was acid with low electrical 

conductivity (EC) and very low concentrations of organic C and extractable K and P. However, total N 

concentration was medium with a higher content of N-NO3 than of N-NH4. The enrichment of the São 

Domingos soil with iron oxides, in particular in the crystalline fraction, is related to the gossan 

materials. 

The São Domingos soil can be considered contaminated with As, Cu and Pb (Table 2; CCME, 

2007). Total soil concentrations of As, Cu, Pb, V and Zn are in the same range as those reported by 

Abreu et al. (2012a,b), Álvarez-Valero et al. (2008) and Santos et al. (2012) for gossan materials and 

soils developed on gossan from the São Domingos mining area. 

No significant differences among all soil samples (treatments and initial soil) were observed for EC, 

extractable P and Fe in iron oxides, both crystalline and non crystalline fractions (Tables 1 and 3). 

Amended soils, independently of polyacrylate source, presented values of pH and organic C 

significantly higher than the control and the initial soil. The increase of soil pH following polymer 

application was observed previously and is related to the exchange of polymer counter ions (Na
+
) with 

acidic ions in the soil (Qu and de Varennes, 2010). The pH values obtained by these authors were in 

the same range as those obtained after the four months of fallow, except for control which increased

growth of Spergularia purpurea 

302 

 

from 4.7 to 5.9. The increase in organic C can be related to the presence of S. purpurea roots which 

were not collected in the previous study (Qu and de Varennes, 2010).

Extractable K concentration was the highest in the soil amended with the polymer from diapers 

(Table 3). Although no significant differences were found for total N and N-NO3 concentrations, N-NH4 

was the highest in control. This suggests that a greater uptake of N took place during growth of S. 

purpurea, related with a greater biomass accumulation in amended soils (Qu and de Varennes, 2010). 

The higher concentrations of N-NO3 and N-NH4 in the control compared to the initial soil can be 

related to increased microbial activity in soil as a consequence of plants growth and irrigation. 

In general, the rehabilitation using polyacrylate polymers, independently of the source, and S. 

purpurea growth improved the chemical characteristics of this type of soils developed on gossan mine 

wastes. 

 

Extractable soil solutions 

 

The three different extraction solutions which were used in this work represented distinct processes 

and/or chemical reactions that can occur in soil, simulating the potential availability of several 

elements, including hazardous elements, for leaving organisms. This comparison will contribute to a 

better understanding of the behaviour of the polyacrylate polymer in soil during the rehabilitation 

processes. The amendments increased the pH of leachates and pore water compared to control and 

initial soil. No significant differences in EC from leachates were observed; however the EC values in 

pore water were almost double following polymer application (Fig. 1). Leachates and pore waters for 

the same treatment had similar pH values suggesting that there were few materials capable of 

generating acidity. 

Concentrations of some chemical elements in the leachates (Cu, Mn, Pb, V and Zn), pore water 

(Al, Cu, Mn, Pb, V and Zn) and RHIZO solution (Cu, Mn, Pb and V) were below the detection limit of 

the apparatus (mg/L – Al and Pb: 0.25; Cu, Mn and Zn: 0.05; V: 0.5). The increase of soil pH and 

organic C, due to polymer application, did not influence the concentrations of the elements in these 

fractions. 

The elements in aqueous solutions (leachates and pore water) and RHIZO solution from initial soil 

represented less than 6.7 % and 8.6 % of their total concentrations, respectively (Figs. 2–4), with the 

exception of Ca in pore water (18.9–28.4 % of the total) and RHIZO fraction (33.6–50.4 % of the total). 

These percentages are slightly higher than those in the aqueous solutions extracted with the 

rhizosphere based-method, in some soils from São Domingos, Caveira and Chança mining areas from 

IPB (Abreu et al., 2012a,b). Similar observations were made during the experiment, as these fractions 

in all the treatments (control and amended) were in the same range compared to those in initial soil, 

except for Na (Leachates: 11.5–32.9 % of total concentration; Pore water: 7.8–60.3 % of total 

concentration). This exception may be related to the addition of artificial urine (as described in Material 

and Methods) and the presence of Na+ as counter ion in the polymer. Although the soil had large total 

concentrations of some elements (like As, Cu and Pb), the fractions potentially available for 

organisms, before and after polymer application, were small and may represent a low potential 

environmental risk.

polymer from diapers and synthetic polymer 7015). Different letters in the same parameter and extractable 

solution indicate significant differences (p &amp;lt;0.05). 

The concentrations of chloride and nitrate in the leachates and soil pore water, Mg concentrations 

in leachates, as well as Zn concentrations in RHIZO solution did not present significant differences 

(Figs. 2–4). 

The NH4
+
 from urine in control may have promoted Al exchange from the soil to the leachate, 

compared to the initial soil. However, independently of the source, polymer application led to 

aretention of Al ions on solid phases, reducing its concentration in leachates (Fig. 2). 

The low concentrations of Ca, K and sulfate in leachates from control and amended treatments, 

compared to initial soil leachates, can be related to soil reaction and their leaching as a consequence 

of rain and irrigation during the mesocosm experiment (Figs. 2 and 3).

Fig. 2 Cation concentrations in simulated leachates (DIN extraction) and pore water solution from initial soil and 

soils from treatments of the mesocosm assay (control; soils amended with diapers, polymer from diapers and 

synthetic polymer 7015). Different letters in the same parameter and extractable solution indicate significant 

differences (p &amp;lt;0.05). 

The materials present in diapers seemed to influence the concentration of Fe in leachates, as the 

highest values in leachates (12.50 mg/kg; Fig. 2) were observed in this treatment. 

Amended soils had the highest concentrations of As, Na and phosphate in leachates and pore 

water (Figs. 2 and 3). The high As concentration in aqueous solutions may be explained by the 

negative charges on the polyacrylates reactive groups promoting some cation adsorption, inhibiting 

the formation of low solubility solid phases (e.g. metal arsenates; Santos et al., 2012). The exchange 

between counter ions (Na
+
) in the polymers and acidic ions in the soil can explain the higher Na 

concentration. The increase of the phosphatase activity in amended soil after S. purpurea growth (Qu 

and de Varennes, 2010) probably promoted a higher release of phosphate ions.

Fig. 3 Anions concentrations in simulated leachates (DIN extraction) and pore water solution from initial soil and 

soils from treatments of the mesocosm assay (control; soils amended with diapers, polymer from diapers and 

synthetic polymer 7015). Different letters in the same parameter and extractable solution indicate significant 

differences (p &amp;lt;0.05). 

Differences between concentrations of As, Fe and K in RHIZO solution from the treatments 

amended with diapers and amended with only polymer (from diapers or polymer 7510) were observed 

(Fig. 4). Polymer application increased the concentration of elements in RHIZO solution, except for Zn 

(Fig. 4). This can also be associated with the greater S. purpurea growth in these treatments (Qu and 

de Varennes, 2010) and more exudation of low-molecular-weight organic acids by roots, capable of 

forming complexes and enhancing the availability of the chemical elements (Feng et al., 2005). 

Comparing results from leachates and pore water (Figs. 2 and 3), the concentrations of Ca and 

sulfate in all treatments, as well as Mg, Na and phosphate in amended treatments increased more 

than 20 % in pore water fraction with a simultaneous increase of the EC. Thus, the longer contact with 

water seems to promote the dissolution of solid phases containing these elements and exchanges 

with ions in the polymer. Moreover, Al and As were reduced drastically (24–99 %), as well as Fe in the 

majority of the treatments, in pore water compared to leachates (Figs. 2 and 3), suggesting the 

formation of new solid phases containing these chemical elements.

Fig. 4 Chemical elements concentrations in simulated rizosphere solution, extracted with an organic acid solution, 

from initial soil and soils from treatments of the mesocosm assay (control; soils amended with diapers, polymer 

from diapers and synthetic polymer 7015). Different letters indicate significant differences (p &amp;lt;0.05). 

 

In general, the polymer matrix seems to retain some essential cations, like Ca, Fe, K and Mg, and 

hazardous elements, like Al, influencing their availability in soil. However, this behaviour was not 

clearly observed in the leachates and pore water. The equilibria established between 

water:soil:polymer, even in the pore water, were not enough to evaluate the total amounts of the 

elements retained in the polymer as water can only extract the chemical elements weakly adsorbed. 

The RHIZO solution, due to the presence of organic acids, is a stronger extractant than water. That

solution simulates the rhizosphere processes, namely the complexation of elements released from 

inorganic and organic colloids exchangeable positions and, in the present assays, also from the 

polyacrylate polymer. In fact, concentrations of the elements in RHIZO solution were higher than those 

in leachates and pore water (except for As, K and Na).Nevertheless, this fact suggests that the 

polymer matrix can retain a large amount of cations, which can be uptake by the plants only through 

root exudation of organic acids. The increase of the available fraction of the nutrients by the 

rizosphere effect can be an advantage for soil rehabilitation processes. 

Although some hazardous elements increased in the fractions potentially available for organisms 

after polymer application, their concentrations remained low and with small environmental risk. 

 

Plant development in the lysimeters 

 

Spontaneous species belonging to the Poaceae, Fabaceae and Asteraceae families (common in 

the mining area), were identified but as expected, S. purpurea was the dominant species, with a 

considerable biomass from November until June. At the end of the experiment, the fresh biomass of 

plants varied with treatment reaching the highest values in control (134.5 g) and in soil amended with 

polymer from diapers (131.7 g), compared to soil amended with the 7015 polymer or shredded diapers 

(77.7 and 71.4 g, respectively). However, a clear distinction between the chemical characteristics of 

soils from these two groups was not observed. The great heterogeneity of plants species and 

inexistence of a considerable quantity of a representative species in some periods did not provide a 

clear tendency of natural colonization in relation to soil treatments. 

In the first month of the experiment, the highest germination rate for C. ladanifer was in control (22 

seedlings) but for L. sampaioana it was in the treatment with the 7015 polymer (20 seedlings). 

However, even in amended soil the mortality rate was very high (over 80 %) and very few shrubs 

survived, which was the opposite of the observed with S. purpurea (Qu and de Varennes, 2010).  

 

Plants bioassays 

 

Plant characteristics (e.g. seed properties, root morphology and physiology and tolerance/ 

sensitiveness) can modify the plant response to toxicity of leachates or contaminated soils (Sheppard 

et al., 1993). In the present experiment, visible symptoms of toxicity were observed in lettuces in initial 

and amended soil using the filter paper test (leaves with light greenish-yellow colour) and in oats from 

amended treatments using the hydroponic test (leaves with dry tips or brown coloration). 

Growth of Brassica rapa was also very sensitive to soil physical and chemical properties in the 

bioassays (Sheppard et al., 1993). Bioassays using leachates or water soil extracts can predict the 

risks of contaminants in ground and surface waters, but they do not show interactions and exchanges 

that occur in soils (Leitgib et al., 2007; van Gestel et al., 2001). Therefore, ecotoxicological tests, 

combining both direct (with whole soil) and indirect (with leachate) are useful. 

No differences were observed among treatments in the studied parameters when using lettuce in 

filter paper and soil tests (Table 4). However, with oat most parameters were different between

growth of Spergularia purpurea 

310 

 

treatments (Table 5). The seed germination test using both species was low sensitive what can be 

related to the low concentration of elements in leachates. Similar results were obtained for germination 

of lettuce and other species (broccoli, tomato and radish) with aqueous solutions of Pb or Cu 

(Salvatore et al., 2008), and lettuce, both with leachates from soils affected by the Aznalcóllar pyrite-

mine spill (Valerio et al., 2007) and saturation extracts from sediments collected in the Rodalquilar 

mining district (Bagur-González et al., 2011). In addition, Salvatore et al. (2008) also pointed out that 

seed coats act as a barrier which protects the growth of the embryo. Although root growth is known to 

be more sensitive than germination to chemical elements toxicity (Araùjo and Monteiro, 2005; Martí et 

al., 2007; Salvatore et al. 2008; Valerio et al., 2007), the concentrations of elements in leachates and 

RHIZO solution of the soils were too low (Figs. 2–4) to inhibit the growth of lettuce roots. In contrast, 

oat root elongation in the treatment with polymer from diapers was the lowest in the filter paper test, 

although the chemical characteristics of leachates from this treatment were not different compared to 

the other amended treatments (Figs. 2 and 3). Furthermore, oat root elongation was not correlated to 

the studied chemical characteristics of the leachates. 

In the soil test, the increase of organic C and N in control (Tables 1 and 3), compared with initial 

soil, seems to have promoted oat growth. Initial soil (and control) showed low toxicity as reported for 

other gossan samples from São Domingos by Alvarenga et al. (2012). 

In the soil test, the oat root and shoot elongations (Table 5) were negatively influenced by the 

polymer application due to some toxicity of this polymer or high concentrations of As, Fe and Na in 

pore water (–0.83 &amp;lt;r &amp;lt;–0.95 depending on element). Moreover, in amended treatments the increase 

of As and Mg in the RHIZO solution (Fig. 4) could have contributed to reduce shoot elongation (r = –

0.89 and –0.82, respectively). Nevertheless, the coexistence of high concentrations of various 

chemical elements in the RHIZO solution (Al, As, Ca, Fe, Mg and Na) or pore water (As, Fe and Na) 

from amended treatments, compared to the control, may have influenced plant growth by direct or/and 

antagonism/synergism processes during uptake and translocation. 

In the hydroponic bioassay, the treatment amended with diapers presented the lowest lettuce shoot 

elongation (Table 4), but the fresh biomass presented one of the highest values (together with the 

treatment amended with polymer from diapers). The high total fresh biomasses were not related to the 

increase of water accumulation in tissues (data not shown). Although the concentration of Fe in 

leachates (the only element which varied between treatments; Figs. 2 and 3) did not influence 

negatively and directly shoot elongation, antagonism or synergism behaviours could occur and 

influence the translocation of other elements, having significant consequences for plant growth 

(Kabata-Pendias, 2011). In general, the studied chemical characteristics of leachates were not 

different between amended treatments suggesting that the variation in fresh biomass was related to 

other properties that were not analysed. For lettuce (Table 4), all amended treatments presented 

higher values of root elongation compared to control and initial soil, probably due to the higher 

phosphate concentration in leachates (r = 0.95). In contrast, the increase of As concentration in 

leachates from amended treatments showed no influence in the root elongations (r = 0.88).

Evaluation of chemical parameters and ecotoxicity of a soil developed on gossan following application of polyacrylates and 
growth of Spergularia purpurea 

 

313 

 

Comparing the toxicity indexes reported by Bagur-González et al. (2011), that used paper filter test 

and distilled water as blank, the leachates from all the present treatments and initial soil indicated no 

(indexes values &gt; 1) or low (indexes values from 0 to –0.25) toxicity depending on plant parameter 

and plant species. Lettuce seed germination was less sensitive (germination index of all treatments: –

0.05 to –0.15) than oat (germination index values &gt; 0, except for the treatment amended with diapers 

that presented an index value = –0.25). In general, indexes of shoot and root elongations for both 

plant species did not suggest a large toxicity (never more severe than low toxicity). For roots, this fact 

may be due to the low elements concentrations, while for shoots the potential toxicity also depends on 

elements translocation.  

For evaluation of the toxicity in aerial part and root elongations, the hydroponic test seemed more 

appropriate to evaluate toxicity but the determination of root length from the assays based on plant 

growth can be more sensitive due to the direct influence of the elements from the leachates. 

 

Microalgae and microcrustacean bioassays 

 

All bioassays were valid according to the criteria established in the guidelines. No significant 

differences in the responses of microalgae and Daphnia were observed between leachates from initial 

and control soils: around 97 % of toxicity effects on D. magna (Fig. 5) and stimulation of algae growth 

(inhibition effect: –25 % I and –12 % I, respectively; Fig. 6) suggests that the growth cycle of S. 

purpurea did not decrease the toxicity of leachates towards these organisms. Initial soil and control 

had a considerable toxicity only when the indirect test with D. magna was used. Similar results were 

obtained in leachates from soils collected in Caveira and Lousal mines which showed 100 % of D. 

magna mortality but percentages of P. subcapitata growth inhibition null for Lousal soils and between 

22 and 87 % for Caveira soils (Rocha et al., 2011). Other authors also reported the existence of 

toxicity in other gossan samples from São Domingos (EC50 of 26 % V/V; Alvarenga et al., 2012) and 

Aljustrel mine soils (EC50 of 36 % V/V; Alvarenga et al., 2008) using the D. magna test.  

In the D. magna bioassay (Fig. 5), the leachates from control and treatment amended with diapers 

presented the highest acute toxicity values (98 % and 90 % of toxic effect, respectively). However, the 

inhibition of microalgae growth occurred in the treatments associated with the use of diapers (Fig. 6; 

Diapers: 6 % I; Polymer from diapers: 27 % I) suggesting a negative influence of the polymer from the 

diapers, which may be different from polymer 7015. No chemical characteristic of the leachates was 

strongly correlated with toxicity for daphnia or microalgae. However, the coexistence of several 

chemical elements, even at low concentrations, may amplify acute toxicity (Holmstrup et al., 2010). 

The microalgae bioassay presented a large variability between replicates which may be related to 

the gossan heterogeneity (Santos et al., 2012), and consequently the chemical characteristics of the 

leachates (e.g. contents of organic C and nutrients). The growth of microalgae can increase in the 

presence of dissolved organic ligands and/or high hydrophobic dissolved organic matter to Fe(III) ratio 

(Lee et al., 2009). Thus, the microalgae bioassay seems to be less sensitive when evaluating 

ecotoxicity of leachates with low concentrations of toxic elements and adequate contents of nutrients 

and organic C. The D. magna bioassay showed a clear sensitivity for the leachates with low elements

concentrations. These results agree with those reported by Sheppard et al. (1993). The application of 

the synthetic polymer suppressed soil toxicity to both studied organisms.

Evaluation of chemical parameters and ecotoxicity of a soil developed on gossan following application of polyacrylates and 
growth of Spergularia purpurea 

315 

 

CONCLUSIONS 

 

Despite the high total concentrations of several elements (Al, As, Cu, Pb) in the soil developed on 

gossan, the percentage of elements in soluble fractions (evaluated by the simulated leachates and 

pore water) and in the rizosphere conditions (evaluated by the RHIZO solution) were very small. 

Bioassays using different organisms (monocot and dicot species, microcrustacean and microalgae) 

showed the low toxicity of the soil and leachates, and the low environmental risk they pose. The low 

toxicity of the soil is due to the low concentrations of the chemical elements in the fraction usually 

referred as available (extracted with several aqueous solutions) for organisms, which were not 

negatively influenced.  

Daphnia magna test was the only test that showed a clear difference of toxicity between the control 

and amended soils leachates. The different sensitiveness of bioassays shows that several 

ecotoxicological tests should be used to assess environmental risk of soil contamination and its 

rehabilitation 

Growth of S. purpurea and natural plant colonization improved chemical soil characteristics, but the 

use of the polyacrylate polymers contribute to a further improvement in soil quality (pH and fertility). 

However, for both autochthones shrubs, C. ladanifer and L. sampaioana, the improvement in soil 

conditions did not promote germination and development of the majority of seedlings.

Conclusões gerais 
 

321 

 

O presente trabalho incluiu um estudo abrangente sobre a potencial reabilitação de dois tipos de 

escombreiras, uma rica em sulfuretos e outra de materiais de gossan, da mina de São Domingos com 

recurso a resíduos orgânicos e inorgânicos de baixo valor e a espécies autóctones e tolerantes mas 

com valor económico, Cistus ladanifer e Lavandula pedunculata. Deste modo, através do trabalho 

desenvolvido foi possível concluir que: 

a. Os solos da mina de São Domingos como de outras áreas mineiras da Faixa Piritosa Ibérica 

Portuguesa (ex. Brancanes, Caveira, Chança, Lousal e Neves Corvo) apresentam uma grande 

heterogeneidade das suas características químicas em especial das concentrações totais de 

elementos potencialmente tóxicos (EPTs). Independentemente das elevadas concentrações totais de 

EPTs (ex. As, Ba, Cu, Pb, Sb e Zn), da baixa fertilidade e baixo valor do pH dos solos bem como da 

variabilidade intra- e inter-populacional observada, as plantas de C. ladanifer e L. pedunculata 

crescem sem sinais visíveis de toxicidade ou deficiência nutricional apresentando características 

adequadas para o seu uso em programas de fitoestabilização. Estas características traduzem-se por 

intensa absorção de EPTs, mas retenção dos mesmos nas raízes, baixa translocação dos EPTs para 

a parte aérea, comportamento de plantas não acumuladoras, concentrações na parte aérea abaixo do 

máximo permitido para consumo por animais domésticos e sistema radicular denso. Além disso, as 

concentrações dos EPTs nas plantas de ambas as espécies não afectam significativamente as 

concentrações dos nutrientes. 

b. A adaptabilidade destas espécies às condições extremas da área mineira de São Domingos 

relaciona-se com a existência de eficientes mecanismos de tolerância ao nível fisiológico e, 

possivelmente, a valores de concentrações geradoras de fitotoxicidade mais elevadas 

(comparativamente a populações que crescem em áreas não contaminadas) contribuindo assim para 

ecótipos mais resistentes. Em ambas as espécies, o primeiro mecanismo de tolerância aos EPTs do 

solo é a sua acumulação na raiz e a redução da translocação destes para locais fotossinteticamente 

activos. Na L. pedunculata, apesar de alguns EPTs (As, Mn e Zn) atingirem concentrações 

consideradas fitotóxicas na parte aérea, componentes fisiológicos importantes para o normal 

funcionamento das plantas (ex. concentração total de proteína ou pigmentos) não são afectados 

negativamente, não sendo desencadeados mecanismos de tolerância, enzimáticos e não 

enzimáticos, relacionadas com o stresse oxidativo. 

c. Os produtos derivados das plantas crescendo na área mineira (ex. chá/infusão de L. 

pedunculata e bioextractos de ambas as espécies) apresentam viabilidade económica para diferentes 

usos (farmacêutica, cosmética/fragância ou alimentar) devido aos EPTs não alterarem a sua 

qualidade (comparativamente aos mesmos produtos obtidos a partir de plantas colhidas em áreas 

não contaminadas). De facto, a infusão de rosmaninho oriundo da área mineira de São Domingos 

apresenta baixas concentrações de EPTs ou mesmo dentro da gama dos valores obtidos em outros 

chás/infusões, o que demonstra o baixo risco do seu consumo para a saúde humana. Ao nível dos 

bioextractos vegetais, estes contêm vários compostos medicinais ou odoríferos com valor económico. 

Deste modo, o uso estas espécies em programas de fitoestabilização de solos/escombreiras 

contaminados pode contribuir para um retorno económico significativo através da exploração e

comercialização destes produtos, reduzindo os gastos de implementação/manutenção do processo 

de reabilitação da área mineira. 

d. As escombreiras de gossan e ricas em sulfuretos da área mineira de São Domingos 

apresentam significativo impacto ambiental devido, principalmente, aos seus grandes volumes e 

elevadas concentrações de EPTs que podem lixiviar. As escombreiras ricas em sulfuretos, devido à 

elevada reactividade e altas concentrações totais de EPTs, lixiviam soluções aquosas extremamente 

ácidas e com maiores concentrações de elementos químicos (avaliados através de lixiviados 

simulados e de percolação) do que as escombreiras de gossan. Deste modo, torna-se imprescindível 

a recuperação destes materiais. 

e. A concepção de Tecnossolos a partir de materiais ricos em sulfuretos e misturas de resíduos 

orgânicos e inorgânicos não foi uma solução eficaz para a recuperação deste tipo de escombreira. De 

facto, apesar da melhoria da qualidade dos lixiviados destes Tecnossolos devido, especialmente, à 

diminuição significativa da dispersão de alguns elementos químicos (ex. As, Cu, Fe, Pb e Zn) e de 

SO4, esta metodologia não foi suficiente para diminuir/impedir a oxidação dos sulfuretos, 

neutralização dos lixiviados ácidos e, consequentemente, desenvolvimento de vegetação e de outros 

processos biogeoquímicos (ex. actividade enzimática de microrganismos relacionados com os vários 

ciclos dos nutrientes). 

f. Apesar de algumas características dos materiais de gossan (ex. capacidade de retenção de 

água, estrutura ou concentração de alguns nutrientes) poderem ser melhoradas apenas com a 

aplicação de alguns resíduos inorgânicos (polímeros hidrofílicos de poliacrilato), estimulando a 

colonização espontânea de vegetação herbácea, o aumento da fertilidade demonstrou ser um factor 

essencial para o desenvolvimento das espécies arbustivas estudadas. Assim, a concepção de 

Tecnossolos através da aplicação de misturas dos resíduos orgânicos e inorgânicos, principalmente a 

75 e 150 Mg/ha, aos materiais de gossan foi uma solução eficiente na melhoria das características 

físicas, químicas e biológicas deste tipo de resíduo de mina e, consequentemente, para acelerar o 

processo de fitoestabilização com C. ladanifer e L. pedunculata. Além disso, a utilização destes 

Tecnossolos no isolamento dos resíduos ricos em sulfureto foi uma abordagem promissora 

permitindo, consequentemente, o estabelecimento das plantas e redução da lixiviação dos elementos 

químicos. 

g. Assim, o sistema de reabilitação combinada das escombreiras em estudo demonstrou ser 

eficiente e sustentável a longo prazo, permitindo a reabilitação dos resíduos ricos em sulfuretos, estes 

que não são naturalmente colonizados por vegetação, que estão sujeitos a fortes processos erosivos 

e são geradores de drenagem ácida. A inclusão, neste sistema, de uma barreira alcalina composta 

por resíduos inorgânicos carbonatados (brita de rocha calcária + cinzas de biomassa) permitiu 

estabilizar os resíduos de sulfureto diminuindo a sua oxidação e a ascensão de soluções ácidas ricas 

em elementos químicos. Além disso, a concepção de Tecnossolos foi crucial para a implementação 

da fitoestabilização com C. ladanifer e L. pedunculata nos resíduos de gossan. Estas espécies de 

plantas apresentaram bom desenvolvimento, completando todo o ciclo fenológico, bem como 

comportamentos ecológicos (absorção, translocação e de acumulação de elementos químicos) 

semelhantes aos observados em ambiente natural e adequados à sua utilização neste sistema de

reabilitação. A elevada produção de biomassa das duas espécies poderá contribuir, 

consequentemente, para um retorno económico devido ao seu potencial de uso em vários sectores 

(farmacêutica, cosmética/fragância ou alimentar). 

 

Apesar dos resultados promissores que foram obtidos, como trabalho futuro sugere-se a 

implementação do sistema de reabilitação combinada no campo a fim de confirmar a sua eficácia em 

condições de clima mediterrânico. Além disso, é essencial confirmar as concentrações dos EPTs nos 

resíduos vegetais após obtenção dos bioextractos e ajustar a metodologia de extracção dos mesmos, 

de modo a obter maiores teores de compostos de valor acrescentado.
