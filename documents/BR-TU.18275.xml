INTRODUCTION

Bovine herpesvirus-1 (BoHV-1) is an
important pathogen in cattle, acting either alone or in
association with bacterial pathogens to cause a number
of clinical diseases, such as infectious bovine
rhinotracheitis (IBR), genital lesions and abortions
(FLORES, 2007). In countries with a high prevalence of
seropositive animals, the main method of controlling
IBR is vaccination of susceptible animals to reduce the
virus excretion, and to decrease the severity of clinical
signs (MUYLKENS et al., 2007; FLORES, 2007).

A number of protective mechanisms against
infection with BoHV-1 have been described which
essentially depend upon the induction of a wide
spectrum of innate and specific mechanisms of cellular
and humoral immune responses. Innate inflammatory

and cellular reactions are the first response to BoHV-1
infection (JONES &amp;amp; CHOWDHURY, 2008). Some of the
mechanisms such as complement activation are non-
specific, whereas others, such as interferons and early
pro-inflammatory cytokines are induced by virus
replication and lead to the recruitment and activation
of di ffer ent  cel l s such  a s ma cr oph a ges,
polymorphonuclear neutrophils and Natural Killer cells
in cattle (MUYLKENS et al., 2007; JONES &amp;amp;
CHOWDHURY, 2008). The non-specific activated
immune cells are also essential in initiating and
regulating the specific immune response to BoHV-1
(BABIUK et al., 1996, MUYLKENS et al., 2007).

Since current inactivated BoHV-1 vaccines
generally induce strong humoral but weak cell-
mediated immune responses, the success of vaccination
has been correlated to the ability of neutralizing
antibodies to provide protection (MUYLKENS et al.,
2007). Indeed, a correlation between neutralizing
antibody responses and level of protection has been
demonstrated for BoHV-1 (LEMAIRE et al., 1994; VAN
DRUNEN LITTEL-VAN DEN HURK et al., 1994;
BABIUK et al., 1996). In addition to virus-neutralization,
the anti BoHV-1 antibodies can opsonize the virus,
activate the complement system, and can mediate the
Antibody Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC)
(JONES &amp;amp; CHOWDHURY, 2008). Antibody function in
vivo is chiefly linked to immunoglobulin isotype
(McGUIRE et al., 1979), e.g. in bovines, IgG1 antibodies
interact with macrophages Fc receptors whereas IgG2
antibodies interact with neutrophils Fc receptors
(HOWARD et al., 1980). Anti-BoHV-1 isotype-specific
responses were reported and characterized for
experimentally infected cattle (GUY &amp;amp; POTGIETER,
1985; MADIC et al., 1995; BRADSHAW &amp;amp; EDWARDS,
1996). However, there are no consistent data in the
literature describing the role of antibody isotypes, or
even their kinetic production profiles, in bovines
immunized with anti-BoHV-1 vaccines formulated with
suspensions containing inactivated viral particles. The
aim of this  research was to develop an experimental
vaccine against the herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1) using
the inactivated virus and to evaluate its immunogenicity
in bovines by measuring the levels of neutralizing
antibodies, as well as quantifying IgG1 and IgG2
antibodies in the serum and in nasal secretions, over
time, following vaccination and revaccination.

MATERIALS   AND   METHODS

Vaccine preparation
The virus strain used in vaccine production

and in the virus neutralization test was the Los Angeles

(ATCC-VR 188; USA). MDBK cell line (ATCC CCL-22)
was used for virus propagation. Cells were grown in
150cm2 polystyrene T flasks (Corning, USA) using
Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) (Cultilab, Brazil)
supplemented with 5% foetal bovine serum (Cultilab),
with the addition of sodium bicarbonate (Merck,
Germany) adjusted to a final pH 7.0. Sub-cultivations
were carried out every 72h. To produce the vaccine, an
initial cellular inoculum of 0.2 x 106cells mL-1 was used.
After 24 hours of incubation, this pre-formed MDBK
cell monolayer was infected with 0.5mL of an 107,5 TCID50
mL-1 suspension of BoHV-1 (107,2 TCID50) per 150cm2
flasks in 60mL of infection medium, without adsorption
step. The infection medium did not contain bovine
foetal serum (BFS). Flasks were incubated at 37°C in
5% CO2

 
(Thermo Electron Corporation, USA) until 80-

90% of the cell monolayer was destroyed by the virus.
This viral suspension was collected and centrifuged at
2160xg (PR-2 centrifuge; International Equipment Co.,
USA) for 15min at 4°C for removal of cellular debris.
Infectivity was determined in the supernatant and the
viral titre was 107,8TCID50 ml-1. The final viral suspension
was stored at 4°C until the inactivation. The clarified
and titrated viral suspension was inactivated using
3mM (final concentration) binary ethylenimine (BEI) at
26°C (BAHNEMANN, 1990) for 24 hours. The
inactivation was stopped by the addition of a 1M sterile
Na-thiosulphate solution at 10% of the volume of the
BEI solution used. The suspension was tested for
residual infectivity by three consecutive passages of 5
days each in MDBK cultures (1mL of inactivated
suspen si on  i n 25cm 2 fl asks).  T he in acti va ted
suspension was then adsorbed onto 20% aluminium
hydroxide (produced by Vallée S.A, Brazil) as adjuvant
at 4°C, for 12h. Each vaccine dose contained 4mL of
the inactivated viral suspension (total titre per dose:
108,4 TCID50) and 1mL of adjuvant. No preservatives
were added.

Experimental protocol
Seventeen cross-bred heifers, aged between

18 and 24 moths, seronegative for BoHV 1 (VN titer    2),
were divided in vaccinated group (12 animals) and
unvaccinated control group (5 animals). Vaccinated
heifers received 5mL of the experimental vaccine
subcutaneously, followed by an identical dose, 25 days
later, also subcutaneously. Blood was collected at 0, 9,
18, 25, 32, 46, 60, 86, 114, 150, 210, 270 and 330 days
after the first vaccination and the serum was submitted
to a temperature of 56°C for 30 minutes to inactivate
the complement components; after that, it was frozen
until the analysis. Nasal secretions were collected on



309Systemic and local antibodies induced by an experimental inactivated vaccine against bovine herpesvirus type 1.

cotton swabs (Inlab, Brazil) until 150 days post-
vaccination (DPV). After that, the swab was placed in
appropriate tubes containing 1mL of MEM with 1%
antibiotic for transport to the laboratory. Tubes were
agitated 30 seconds and centrifuged at 2160g at 4°C
for 10 minutes, and the supernatant was frozen until
analysis.

Evaluation of the humoral immune response
Neutralizing antibodies were measured by a

standard virus neutralization assay as described by
OIE (2008). Serum samples were tested in duplicate.
For graphic representation of results, the VN antibody
titres were transformed in log2

 
x+1, in which x is the VN

antibody titre, because zero is not a valid value to
calculate log2.

The general procedure described by the
supplier of the ELISA kit for the detection of antibodies
against Bovine Infectious Rhinotracheitis Virus
(IDEXX, Westbrook, USA) was followed to measure
the anti-BoHV-1 antibody isotypes in serum and nasal
swab samples, except for the use of anti-bovine IgG1
or anti-bovine IgG2 peroxidase conjugates (Bethyl
Laboratories, Montgomery, USA) to replace the anti-
bovine total IgG peroxidase conjugate supplied in the
kit. The optimal dilutions for anti-IgG1 and anti-IgG2
conjugates were determined by checkerboard titration
using as diluent phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with
0.05% Tween 20 (Merck, Germany) and 1.5%
ovoalbumin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Pools of 6 negative,

and 6 strong positive sera in the virus neutralizing test
were used to standardize the controls for anti-BoHV-1
IgG1 and anti-IgG2 antibodies. The reading of optical
densities (OD) was recorded in an ELISA Multiskan
Ascent (Thermo Lasystems, USA) microplate reader
at 650nm. The sample to positive values (S/P) was
calculated by the following formula:
S/P = Z-X/Y-X (Where Z = OD of the test sample (serum
or nasal secretion), X = OD of the negative control,
and Y = OD of the positive control).

Statistical analysis
The Kruskall–Wallis non-parametric test

was used for the analysis of neutralizing antibody titres
and of S/P values of each antibody isotype and, when
a significant difference between medians was evident,
Dunn´s non-parametric test was applied. Differences
in P value of     0.05 were considered significant. Linear
regression analysis was performed to determine the
relationship between the two variables. Pearson’s
correlation coefficient was also calculated.

RESULTS   AND   DISCUSSION

Systemic virus-neutralizing antibody responses
Relevant anti-BoHV-1 VN antibody titres

developed in serum of vaccinated animals remained at
moderate to high levels from 25 to 210DPV (Figure 1).
No relevant VN antibody titres were detected in non-
vaccinated animals for the entire post-vaccination

period investigated. After the first vaccination, a
maximum of 41.6% (5 out of 12 heifers) of the immunized
animals showed a slight elevation of virus-neutralizing
antibody production (Figure 1). The revaccination
resulted in a significant rise in VN-antibody titres, which
was characterized by more than doubling in log2

 
of the

antibody titres (P&lt;0.01) (Figure 1). The anti-BoHV-1
median VN-antibody titres reached the acceptable
threshold value (    Log2=3, according to Code of Federal
Regulation, US, 2006) and remained at this level in
100% of the animals until 60DPV. The median VN
antibodies began to decline towards slightly low titres
(Log2=2.32    VN titres     Log2=2.74), from 86 to 210DPV,
and became negative in the last two sampling times,
270 and 330DPV (Figure 1). The evolution of median
VN antibody titres showed also that the highest
percen tages (50-100%) of vaccinat ed a nima ls
harbouring a cceptable levels of these antibodies
(Log2    3) were reached between 32 to 115DPV and
declined afterwards to 25-33.3% (150-270DPV). These
results, particularly the kinetic profile of the humoral
immune response to BoHV-1, resembled to that found,
either after the administration of one or two doses of
inactivated vaccines (CAMPOS et al., 1990; FULTON
et al., 1995). Despite the decline in neutralizing antibody
titres, the possibility that animals might yet be
protected against the clinical signs induced by an
infection of the BoHV-1 cannot be rejected. It has been
reported that vaccinated calves, even exhibiting low
anti-BoHV-1 antibody titres, showed a peak in the anti-
viral antibodies in response to challenge performed
after six months of vaccination, as a consequence of
an anamnestic response that might have contributed
to a significant reduction of respiratory clinical signs
induced by the virus (PETERS et al., 2004). Additionally,
the aluminium hydroxide used as adjuvant in the
current investigation may have contributed to the early
decline of anti-BoHV-1 neutralizing antibody titres, since
its deposit effect is lower than f mineral oil (CAMPOS
et al., 1990; FULTON et al., 1995). Based on these results,
it should be recommended to revaccinate the animals
every six months.

Systemic and local IgG1 and IgG2 anti-BoHV-1 antibody
responses

As  it was tested an inactivated BoHV-1
vaccine containing aluminium hydroxide, which is a
good inducer of IgG antibody responses, but is not
efficient in raising IgA antibodies (GUPTA, 1998), only
IgG1 and IgG2 anti-BoHV-1 isotypes were evaluated in
this study.

The first vaccine dose elicited a slight rise
in the levels of systemic IgG1 and IgG2 antiviral

antibodies, early as 18DPV, and the revaccination (25
DPV) induced a typical anamnestic response of both
isotypes, which was characterized by a sharp increase
in the levels of these antibody isotypes after 32 to
60DPV (Figure 1). The levels of IgG1 and IgG2
antibodies started to decline at 86DPV, maintaining
moderate levels until 150DPV, and from this point on,
these antibodies presented a marked reduction (210-
330DPV). The kinetics of the systemic response of anti
BoHV-1 antibodies induced by the experimental vaccine
demonstrated that the IgG2 prevailed over IgG1 isotype
in vaccinated animals for most of the post-vaccination
intervals analysed (Figure 1). The close relationship
between anti-BoHV-1 VN antibody titres and IgG1 and
IgG2 antibody levels was demonstrated by the similarity
of the kinetic curves of these antibodies (Figure 1).
Virus-neutralizing antibodies reached maximum
concentration at 32DPV, whereas specific anti-virus
antibodies of IgG1 and IgG2 isotypes showed the
h i gh est concen tr a t ion  at  46DPV (Fi gur e 1).
Nevertheless, there were no significant differences
between concentrations of neutralizing antibodies at
32 and 46 DPV (P&gt;0.05). Thus, the highest levels of
anti-BoHV-1 antibodies of IgG1 and IgG2 isotypes
coincided with the peak of neutralizing antibody
activity. In addition to this, positive correlation
coefficients were also found for VN antibody titres and
IgG1 or IgG2 antibody levels, corresponding to r=0.865,
and r=0.779, respectively. IgG2 was also the prevailing
antibody in nasal secretions of vaccinated animals. This
isotype peaked between 32-46DPV, as well as relatively
high levels of this immunoglobulin (S/P  0.5) were
detected in most of the time points investigated (25,
60, 86, and 114DPV), as occurred with the systemic
a n ti bodi es of t h i s isot ype.  In  con t ra st ,  IgG1
antibodies appeared in detectable and significant
amounts (S/P    0.5) only at 32 and 46DPV (Figure 2). A
positive correlation between nasal and circulating IgG1
and IgG2 antibody levels was also found (r=0.66 and
0.866, for IgG1 and IgG2, respectively, P&lt;0.001),
suggesting that there was, at least, a partial transference
of these antibodies from systemic to the local
compartment, especially for IgG2 antibodies.

 The IgG2 isotype showed similar kinetic
profiles with regard to those found in serum from of
antibody-free calves experimentally infected with
BoHV-1 (MADIC et al., 1995). Moreover, the levels of
anti-BoHV-1 systemic IgG2 antibodies compared to
IgG1 isotype remained higher. These results differ from
MADIC et al. (1995) where IgG1 isotype prevailed over
IgG2. However, the reason for the prevalence of IgG2
antibodies is unclear, since the regulation of the immune
r esponse for  th e pr oduct i on  of a  specifi c

immunoglobulin isotype is a complex process
dependent upon many factors and several parameters
may influence the formation of immunoglobulin
isotypes, such as the macromolecular form of the
immunogen, type of antigen, and the adjuvant used,
as demonstrated in the experimental immunization of
ca lves a ga in st  foot-a n d-m outh  disea se vir us
(MULCAHY et al., 1990).

The protective capacity of each antibody
isotype may be interpreted according to its biological
activity and, consequently, to its capacity to interact
with various immune effector cells or humoral factors,
as well as the role of these cells in conferring protection
against the pathogen (MULCAHY et al., 1990).
Regarding the immune-protection against BoHV-1,
antibodies of isotype IgG2 display greater opsonizing
activity than those of isotype IgG1 for bovine
neutrophils present in peripheral blood (HOWARD et
al., 1980; PETERS et al., 2004), thus indicating that there
is greater affinity of the receptors of these cells for
IgG2 antibodies. On the other hand, antibodies of
isotype IgG1 are able to efficiently mediate the
phagocytosis process in bovines by mononuclear
ph agocytes such as m acr opha ges, ra ther th an
neutrophils, because these cells express higher
numbers of receptors or greater affinity of their
receptors for the IgG1 Fc region (HOWARD et al., 1980;
MULCAHY et al., 1990). Considering that ADCC
constitutes one of the main mechanisms involved in
immunity to BoHV-1, and neutrophils are the cells more
directly involved in this process (BABIUK et al., 1996),
it was suggested that antibodies of IgG2 isotype
induced by the inactivated experimental BoHV-1

vaccine in the current study may play an important
role in immunity against this virus.

The correlation between concentrations of
anti-BoHV-1 IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies in serum and
nasal secretion is not an unexpected result, since it has
been demonstrated that the intramuscular administration
of a subunit vaccine consisting of BoHV-1 glycoproteins
is capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies in the
nasal mucosa of immunized bovines (BABIUK et al.,
1987).  Fur th er mor e, t h e va cci n at ed a n i ma l s
demonstrated the protection against replication of the
viral pathogen associated with neutralizing antibody
titres in the nasal secretion, and these local antibodies,
in turn, showed a high level of correlation with serum
antibody titres (BABIUK et al., 1987). Therefore this
fin di ng support s th e hypoth esis of select ive
transportation of IgG2 isotype from serum to the nasal
mucosa, and indicates that the concentration of such
anti-BoHV-1 antibodies in the mucosa, at least in part,
depends upon specific anti-BoHV-1 antibodies present
in serum (BABIUK et al., 1987).

Systemic and local IgG1 and IgG2 anti-
BoHV-1 a n ti body r esponses i n duced by th e
administration of an experimental inactivated vaccine
were well characterized in the current investigation,
but the functions of different antibody isotypes in
cattle, relative to the specific mechanisms of protection
against BoHV-1, need further investigation. Inactivated
vaccines, particularly those containing aluminium
hydroxide adjuvant, may not be expected to result in a
significant cell-mediated immunity or an extensive
production of IgA antibodies in the mucosa (McGHEE
et al., 1992; GUPTA, 1998). Conversely, the aluminium

hydroxide does stimulate the production of neutralizing
IgG antibodies, particularly from IgG2 isotype, as
demonstrated here, and they are distributed in blood
and in the nasal secretion and may thus block BoHV-1
replication at the initial infection site, as proposed
before (ZHU &amp;amp; LETCHWORTH, 1996). However, an
important point to be emphasized is the brief half-life
of such antibodies in the nasal secretion (Figure 2),
making local antibody levels decrease shortly after
revaccination.

CONCLUSION

Systemic and local anti-BoHV-1 antibody
r espon ses wer e i n duced by th e experi m ent a l
inactivated vaccine in the current study. Neutralizing
anti-BoHV-1 antibodies were achieved in potentially
protective titres until 86 DPV and IgG1 and IgG2
antibody responses were induced after the second
vaccination in the serum and in nasal secretions up to
114 days post vaccination. IgG2 antibodies were the
prevalent isotype for most of the post-vaccination
period. Despite  not evaluated in the context of
protection against experimental infection, the vaccine-
induced antibodies can be used as markers for
monitoring the effect of the immunization against this
virus in cattle, as well as the presence of anti-BoHV-1
IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies in serum and nasal secretion
from bovines immunized with inactivated vaccines. If
t h e i sot ypes foun d i n  t he cur r ent  study m a y
substantiate other effectors mechanisms at the main
virus entry site, in addition to the virus neutralization,
further investigation are required.
