ABSTRACT

RESUMO

Determinação de Taxas de Reatividade das Frações Granulométricas de Silicatos

A eficiência dos corretivos de acidez do solo depende da taxa de reatividade (RE) e do poder de neutralização (PN),
sendo indicada pelo poder relativo de neutralização total (PRNT). Para os silicatos,  existem poucos estudos que
estabeleçam taxas de reatividade para suas frações granulométricas e, portanto, utilizam-se as mesmas taxas de reatividade
do calcário. Assim, este estudo teve como objetivo avaliar a reatividade de materiais silicatados, em função de sua
granulometria, no decorrer de períodos de incubação, em comparação com a do calcário, e calcular a eficiência relativa
de reatividade das frações granulométricas dos silicatos. Utilizaram-se seis materiais corretivos, sendo três escórias de
aciaria de origens distintas, calcários dolomítico e calcítico, separados em quatro frações granulométricas (material
retido entre as peneiras ABNT 10; 10-20; 20-50 e &amp;lt;50), e a wollastonita como tratamento adicional. A combinação dos
tratamentos foi aplicada a três solos de diferentes classes texturais. A dose foi aplicada em quantidades iguais de
material neutralizante (óxidos de cálcio e magnésio), possibilitando ter como variação apenas a granulometria do
material. Após 90 dias de incubação dos corretivos, calculou-se a eficiência relativa de reatividade para cada fração
granulométrica, a reatividade (RE) e o PRNT experimental dos corretivos. As reações de neutralização da acidez do solo
de uma mesma fração granulométrica, com os diferentes corretivos, mostraram que ocorrem solubilidade e reação
distintas entre silicatos e calcários. As taxas de eficiência relativa para a reatividade das escórias foram superiores às
determinadas pela legislação brasileira, podendo-se inferir que o método utilizado para calcários não é adequado para
os silicatos.

Palavras-chave: acidez do solo, escórias de aciaria, granulometria.

Determination of Reactivity Rates of Silicate Particle-size Fractions1

The efficiency of sources used for soil acidity correction depends on reactivity rate (RR) and neutralization power
(NP), indicated by effective calcium carbonate (ECC). Few studies establish relative efficiency of reactivity (RER) for
silicate particle-size fractions, therefore, the RER applied for lime are used. This study aimed to evaluate the reactivity
of silicate materials affected by particle size throughout incubation periods in comparison to lime, and to calculate
the RER for silicate particle-size fractions. Six correction sources were evaluated: three slags from distinct origins,
dolomitic and calcitic lime separated into four particle-size fractions (2, 0.84, 0.30 and&amp;lt;0.30-mm sieves), and
wollastonite, as an additional treatment. The treatments were applied to three soils with different texture classes.
The dose of neutralizing material (calcium and magnesium oxides) was applied at equal quantities, and the only
variation was the particle-size material. After a 90-day incubation period, the RER was calculated for each particle-
size fraction, as well as the RR and ECC of each source. The neutralization of soil acidity of the same particle-size
fraction for different sources showed distinct solubility and a distinct reaction between silicates and lime. The RER
for slag were higher than the limits established by Brazilian legislation, indicating that the method used for limes
should not be used for the slags studied here.

Key words: soil acidity, steel slag, ECC.

INTRODUCTION

Soil acidity is one of the major chemical attributes
related to plant growth as it affects the occurrence of
phytotoxic elements and the availability of most nutrients.
Lime is the most used corrective to neutralize soil acidity.
However, studies show that silicate materials have great
potential to improve soil chemical characteristics, mainly
by increasing the pH. SiO

3
2- is the neutralizing agent in

silicates, which reacts with water releasing OH- ions that
neutralize H+ and Al3+ phytotoxic (Prado et al., 2001),
consequently increasing Ca, Mg and base saturation
(Brassioli et al., 2009; Corrêa et al., 2009). Slags are a silicon
source (Souza &amp;amp; Korndorfer 2010) as well as enhancing
nutrient uptake by plants (Fonseca et al., 2011).

In Brazil, steel mills provide slag, an abundant silicate
source, at a very low cost. Slag has already been used in
agriculture in the United States, Japan, and China. Many
studies have recently reported on the viability of using
slag in several crops such as soybean (Corrêa et al., 2008),
rice (Barbosa Filho et al., 2004), sugar cane (Brassioli et al.,
2009), and sorghum (Barbosa et al., 2008), among others.
Yet further information on these materials is required,
especially related to RER for particle-size fractions.

Efficiency and quality of sources used in soil acidity
correction are indicated by ECC and depend on the RER of
particle-size fractions, (LOPES et al., 1990). No information
is available regarding the reactivity of silicate particle-size
fractions, thus carbonate reactivity rates are used.

The RER of corrective sources established for particle-
size fractions are determined based on liming materials.
Reactivity values established by ABNT (Brazilian
Technical Standards Association) standard sieves are: 0
for particles retained in sieve #10, fractions &gt; 2.00 mm;
20% for retention in sieve #20, fractions from 2.00 to 0.84
mm; 60% for retention in sieve #50, fractions from 0.84 to
0.30 mm; and 100% for fractions &amp;lt;0.30 mm sieved through
#50. These values represent the percentage of reaction in
the soil for three months (Brasil, 2006). However, particles
from silicate sources are more porous, due to the fusion
during the steel making processes, which increases the
specific surface area of the slag fractions ensuring greater
reaction speed of dissociation. The presence of the
accompanying anion SiO

3
 confers a six or seven-fold

increase of solubility compared to lime, where CO
3 
is the

anion (Alcarde, 1992). Therefore, rates of RER applied to
lime are not appropriate to determine silicate reactivity,
because the rates underestimate the neutralization capacity
of silicate sources and, consequently, overestimate the
amount to be applied for soil acidity correction.

It is essential to study the RER for silicate particle-size
fractions to establish appropriate recommendations for
soil acidity correction. This study aimed to evaluate the
reactivity of silicate materials affected by particle size

during incubation periods in comparison to lime reactivity,
and to calculate the RER for silicate particle-size fractions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The study was conducted under greenhouse
conditions in Botucatu, São Paulo State, Brazil. Treatments
were tested in three soils collected in Botucatu: Rhodic
Hapludox (RH), Typic Quartzipsamment (TQ) and Alfisol
Ferrudalfs (AF) (Soil Taxonomy, 2010) (Table 1). The ex-
perimental design was completely randomized with four
replications, analyzed as a 5 x 4 +1 factorial, five sources
for soil acidity correction (Table 2) and four particle-size
fractions, and an additional treatment (wollastonite).

It was used three slags from distinct origins (slags 1
and 2, originated from steel provided by Mannesmann®

and Silifertil®, respectively and slag 3 originated from
stainless steel provided by Recmix ®), as well as
wollastonite, dolomitic lime, and calcitic lime. Wollastonite
is an international standard of calcium silicate, mostly used
in studies to compare different silicate sources.

Except for wollastonite, the sources were separated
into four particle-size fractions established by Brazilian
legislation for lime (Brasil, 2006), described as ABNT #10
- corresponding to particles retained by #10 sieve, with
diameter &gt; 2 mm; ABNT #20 - corresponding to particles
sieved through #10, but not #20, with diameter between
2-0.84 mm; ABNT #50 - corresponding to particles sieved
through #20, but not #50, with diameter between 0.84-0.30

mm; ABNT &amp;lt;50 - corresponding to particles sieved
through #50, with diameter &amp;lt;0.30 mm.

A previous experiment was carried out for three months
to establish the doses to be used. The same materials
tested in this experiment were separated in particle-size
fractions and applied at increasing amounts (0, 1, 2, 4, and
8 t ha-1) in the three soils. The previous study allowed to
obtain the neutralization fitting curve for each source and
particle-size to calculate the dose to increase the pH (CaCl

2
)

of each soil class to 5.5 (Table 3). In the first experiment,
the 2-mm fraction of slag 1 and lime, except calcitic lime
applied in TQ, did not influence soil pH; therefore, the
dose could not be calculated. In this case, it was used the
dose calculated for the 0.84-mm fraction.

The experimental units consisted of plastic pots with
punched lids. Each filled with 1 kg of soil and the material
to increase the pH (CaCl

2
) to 5.5, according to particle-

size and source (Table 3). The soil moisture was kept at
70% of field capacity, through weekly weighing. At the
end of each incubation period (30, 60, and 90 days), soil
samples were collected to determine the pH (CaCl

2
) (Raij

et al., 2001). Considering the pH variations after 90 days,
it was evaluated the RER for particle-size fractions.
According to Brazilian legislation, reactivity of dolomitic
lime is considered 100% for particle-size fractions &amp;lt;0.30
mm. Therefore, this was considered the reference value to
calculate the increase in all other fractions and corrective
sources.

It was analyzed the RER for each fraction and source
to calculate an average value for all three soils. This value
was used to calculate the RR of corrective sources
according to their particle size (Table 2) in the equation:

being: F1, F2 ..... Fn = rate of particle-size fractions
   RE1, RE2 ..... REn = rate of relative efficiency

reactivity for each particle-size fraction

Afterwards, the ECC was calculated for each correction
source, hereby denominated Experimental ECC, in the
following equation:



268 Angélica Cristina Fernandes Deus et al.

Rev. Ceres, Viçosa, v. 61, n.2, p. 265-272, mar/abr, 2014

being: NP = neutralization power, obtained in
laboratory

           RR = reactivity rate

The NP was determined by the acid base titration
method (Alcarde, 2009). The results were submitted to
the analysis of variance (F test). The means were compared
in the Tukey test (p &amp;lt;0.05) whenever significant differences
occurred.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Considering the same particle-size fraction of
corrective sources (Tables 4, 5 and 6), the pH results
showed distinct solubility and reaction between silicates

and carbonates. Therefore, physical characteristics of
different fractions may have affected the speed of reaction
and solubilization, given that amounts of Ca and Mg oxi-
de were applied equally in all treatments. Particle-size
fractions smaller than 0.30 mm (ABNT &amp;lt;50) showed higher
pH at the beginning of the incubation period and small
variations between correction sources, this particle size
is thinner and showed greater surface contact with the
soil, increasing solubility. However, over time, larger
particles were soluble and modified the pH. This shows
that the particle size can influence reactivity, even after
the use of high doses. Larger fractions take a longer time
to start neutralizing soil acidity and reach pH 5.5, compared
to thinner particles. Longer incubation periods of larger
particles possibly increase pH values more than thinner
particles, which immediately influence soil properties, but
do not extend residual effects.



269Determination of Reactivity Rates of Silicate Particle-size Fractions

Rev. Ceres, Viçosa, v. 61, n.2, p. 265-272, mar/abr, 2014

Gonçalves et al. (2011) studied limes of different
particle sizes and observed a quick increase of the lime
pH in thinner particles. This is explained because the
reaction of corrective sources is highly affected by the
material grinding and smaller-size particles react quickly,
however, the residual effect is kept for a shorter period than
in materials with larger-size particles. Except for fractions
between 2-0.84 mm (ABNT #20) in RH and TQ, calcitic and
dolomitic limes showed similar effects on soil correction,
within the same particle size fraction, regardless of the
incubation period and soil type. Slags showed distinct
effects depending on particle size (Tables 4, 5 and 6).

The chemical component of slags varies according to
the furnace type, steel grades, and pretreatment method
(Yi et al., 2012), which may justify these differences
between slags. Besides, slags are obtained through
distinct industrial processes, which leads to

recrystallization affected by Ca and Mg levels and cooling
time, influencing solubility (Pereira et al., 2010). Materials
are submitted to different types of cooling processes that
may also affect slag composition, by either air or
quenching. When slag is cooled by air, recrystallization
of its components occurs reducing solubility when applied
to the soil, consequently, decreasing the material reactivity
(Prado et al., 2001).

Slag 1 and both limes with particle size fractions greater
than 2 mm (ABNT #10) did not affect the pH in RH and
AF. This was expected once it was not possible to
establish appropriate doses to increase the pH to 5.5 in
the previous experiment. Conversely, slags 2 and 3 that
had established doses to increase the pH to 5.5 did show
positive effects in neutralizing soil acidity.

The RER was influenced by sources for soil acidity
correction and varied depending on soil type (Table 7).



270 Angélica Cristina Fernandes Deus et al.

Hence, it is essential to study soils with distinct chemical,
physical, and mineralogical attributes, to estimate the RR
of corrective sources.

Although this study did not aim to evaluate the
influence of soil type on reactivity of correction sources,
it was observed that the effects of particle-size fractions
on acidity correction varied between soil types. Slags with
particles varying from 0.84-0.30 mm (ABNT #50) did not
differ from each other in RH, however, they differed in TQ
and AF. Slags 1, 2 and 3 with particle-size fractions
between 2.0-0.84 mm (ABNT #20) showed similar behavior
in AF in all incubation periods. Nevertheless, in RH, slag
1 showed lower RER than in the other slags. These results
can be explained by the distinct mineralogy of the clay
fraction in all three soil types. Pandolfo &amp;amp; Tedesco (1996)
reported that climate and soil conditions also influence the
efficiency of corrective sources in neutralizing soil acidity.

The RER of silicate was higher than in carbonates,
mainly in larger particle-size fractions, considering the
average from all soil types (Table 7). These results do not
corroborate Prado et al. (2004). The authors applied the
amounts 0.00, 5.04, and 10.08 t ha-1 for ABNT sieves #10,
#20, #50 and&amp;lt;50 of steel slag in an dystrophic Red Latosol
and found RER close to the values established by Brazilian
legislation for lime. The same amounts for each ABNT
sieve and the evaluation only in one soil may have
contributed to the differences between the results obtained
by the authors and our results.

The RER of lime reactivity increased with smaller
particle-size fractions. Slag particles between 0.30-0.84
mm and 0.84-2.0 mm showed higher RER than sizes
smaller than 0.30 mm.  RER in slag 3 was higher in particle
sizes &gt; 2.0 mm. Increasing RER of lime materials through
reducing particle size is a consequence of lower solubility

and faster acidity neutralization caused by enhanced
surface contact between the soil and the source.
However, the number of pores in silicates may also have
influenced the silicate effects, improving hydrolysis and
dissolution speed. Larger particles had their size reduced
as internal specific surface increased, therefore, soil
acidity correction was enhanced. Studies conducted
under controlled conditions (Ramos et al., 2006) and in
the field (Corrêa et al., 2007) showed that silicate sources
are more efficient to correct soil acidity than lime. As
mentioned before, abundant pores and increased surface
area of silicates increase solubility and RER. Therefore,
products from the dissociation process show higher

mobility in deeper soil layers (Corrêa et al., 2007, 2008,
2009; Castro &amp;amp; Crusciol, 2013).

The RER of particles mainly for silicates sources was
higher than reference values established by Brazilian
legislation. Particle reactivity determined in laboratory is
often higher than under field conditions, since the
corrective source is mixed in the soil and moisture is kept
at an appropriate level (Alcarde et al., 1989). Considering
the mean of the soils the RER of lime and wollastonite was
similar to the values established by Brazilian legislation
(Table 7). The higher RR increased ECC values in silicates
(Table 8), reducing the doses required for acidity
correction.

CONCLUSIONS

Dolomitic and calcitic limes tend to show similar RER
for a given particle-size fraction whereas slags have their
RER varying to the same particle size. Additionally, RER
of slags used in this study are higher than the reference
values established in Brazilian legislation, which shows
that the method used for lime should not be used for the
slags studies. Further studies should be conducted to
verify whether the RR obtained experimentally could be
considered in the ECC calculation for soil liming and
appropriate plant growth.
