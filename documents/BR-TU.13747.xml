resumo 

 

 

O consumo de energia a nível mundial aumenta a cada dia, de forma inversa 
aos recursos fósseis que decrescem de dia para dia. O sector dos transportes 
é o maior consumidor deste recurso. Face ao actual cenário urge encontrar 
uma solução renovável e sustentável que permita não só, diminuir a nossa 
dependência de combustíveis fósseis mas fundamentalmente promover a sua 
substituição por energias de fontes renováveis. O biodiesel apresenta-se na 
vanguarda das alternativas aos combustiveis derivados do petróleo, para o 
sector dos transportes, sendo considerado uma importante opção a curto 
prazo, uma vez que o seu preço pode ser competitivo com o diesel 
convencional, e para a sua utilização o motor de combustão não necessita de 
alterações. O biodiesel é uma mistura líquida, não tóxica, biodegradável de 
ésteres de ácidos gordos, sem teor de enxofre ou compostos aromáticos, 
apresenta boa lubricidade, alto número de cetano, e origina emissões gasosas 
mais limpas. 
O presente trabalho contribui para um melhor conhecimento da dependência 
das propriedades termofisicas do biodiesel com a sua composição. A 
publicação de novos dados permitirá o desenvolvimento de modelos mais 
fiáveis na previsão do comportamento do biodiesel. 
As propriedades densidade e viscosidade são o espelho da composição do 
biodiesel, uma vez que dependem directamente da matéria prima que lhe deu 
origem, mais do que do processo de produção. Neste trabalho os dados 
medidos de densidade e viscosidade de biodiesel foram testados com vários 
modelos e inclusivamente foram propostos novos modelos ajustados para esta 
família de compostos. Os dados medidos abrangem uma ampla gama de 
temperaturas e no caso da densidade também foram medidos dados a alta 
pressão de biodiesel e de alguns ésteres metilico puros. 
Neste trabalho também são apresentados dados experimentais para o 
equilíbrio de fases sólido-liquído de biodiesel e equlibrio de fases líquido-
líquido de alguns sistemas importantes para a produção de biodiesel. Ambos 
os tipos de equilíbrio foram descritos por modelos desenvolvidos no nosso 
laboratório. 
Uma importância especial é dado aqui a propriedades que dependem do perfil 
de ácidos gordos da matéria-prima além de densidade e viscosidade; o índice 
de iodo e temperature limite de filtrabalidade são aqui avaliados com base nas 
considerações das normas. 
Os ácidos gordos livres são um sub-produto de refinação de óleo alimentar, 
que são removidos na desodoração, no processo de purificação do óleo. A 
catálise enzimática é aqui abordada como alternativa para a conversão destes 
ácidos gordos livres em biodiesel. Estudou-se a capacidade da lipase da 
Candida antartica (Novozym 435) para promover a esterificação de ácidos 
gordos livres com metanol ou etanol, utilizando metodologia de superfície de 
resposta com planeamento experimental. Avaliou-se a influência de diversas 
variáveis no rendimento da reacção.

abstract 

 

World energy consumption rises every day and, inversely, fossil fuel resources 
are dwindling day by day. Transportation sector is the bigger consumer of oil. 
Faced with the actual scenario a renewable and sustenable alternative is 
needed, not just to decrease our dependence of petroleum but also to base our 
power in a renewable source. Biodiesel is at the forefront of the alternatives to 
petroleum based fuels in the transportation sector, being considered an 
important short-time option since its price can be competitive with conventional 
diesel and no motor changes are required. Biodiesel consists on a liquid blend 
of, non toxic, biodegradable fatty acid esters, with non sulfur and aromatic 
content, good lubricity, high cetane number, nontoxic character of their exhaust 
emissions and cleaner burning. 
Aiming at tuning biodiesel to optimize the fuel composition, the present work 
contributes for a better knowledge of de depencende of thermophysical 
properties of biodiesel on their compositon. New data is required to help in the 
development of reliable models to predict biodiesel behavior. 
Density and viscosity data are a mirror of biodiesel composition, as both 
depend on the raw material, more than the production process. New data of 
density and viscosity were measured and respective models were tested and 
compared, and new adjusted parameters proposed for this family of 
compounds. The measured data include a wide range of temperatures and in 
the case of density data were also measured at high pressure for biodiesel and 
some pure methyl esters. 
This work also reports experimental data for the solid-liquid-phase equilibria of 
biodiesel and, liquid-liquid equilibria of some important systems in biodiesel 
production. Both type of equilibria were described with models developed in 
our laboratory. 
A special importance is here given to properties that depend on fatty acid 
profile of raw material besides density and viscosity; the iodine value, and cold 
filter plugging point are here evaluated based on norm considerations. 
Free Fatty Acids (FFA) are a by-product in edible oil refining, that are removed 
in the deodorizing step on oil purification. Enzymatic catalysis is here studied 
as an alternative to convert this by-product into biodiesel. The ability of 
immobilized lipase from Candida antartica (Novozym 435) to catalize the 
esterification of FFA with methanol and ethanol were evaluated using response 
surface methodology with an experimental design. Influence of several 
variables were evaluated in the yield of reaction.

With the depletion of oil resources as well as the negative environmental impact 

associated with the use of fossil fuels, there is a renewed interest in alternative energy 

sources. Since the world reserves of fossil fuels and raw materials are limited, active 

research interest has been focusing in nonpetroleum, renewable, and nonpolluting fuels. 

Biofuels are one of the most important alternative source of energy for the foreseeable 

future and can still form the basis of sustainable development in terms of socioeconomic 

and environmental concerns. Biodiesel appears to be a promising future energy 

sources.1 

 

Work Aims and Motivations 

 

Biodiesel derived from oil crops is a potential renewable and carbon neutral alternative 

to petroleum fuels. Chemically, biodiesel is a monoalkyl ester of long chain fatty acids 

derived from renewable feed stock like vegetable oils and animal fats. It is obtained by 

the transesterification reaction between oil or fat and a monohydric alcohol in presence 

of a catalyst. Biodiesel has to fulfill quality standards which are compiled in the norm 

that specify minimum or maximum requirements and test methods to evaluate biodiesel 

quality. In Europe the biodiesel fuel standards are compiled in the norm CEN EN 

14214, and in USA in the norm ASTM D6751. Some of these properties depend on the 

raw materials used on the biodiesel fuel production and as a consequence on the fatty 

acid esters profile of biodiesel fuel. Differences in chemical and physical properties 

among biodiesel fuels can be explained largely by the fuels’ fatty acid content. 

For technical reasons, political and economic production of biodiesel obeying the 

required quality standards cannot be made from one single oil but only from mixtures of 

oils. The main goal of this work is to develop relations between the oils composition 

and the final characteristics of the biodiesel which indicate the most appropriated 

formulation for a biodiesel fuel. Nevertheless, the environmental conditions can limit 

biodiesel utilization, as some specific norm parameters differ between regions and 

seasons (winter and summer).

This work was motivated by the lack of information on the thermophysical properties 

of biodiesel fuel and their dependency on the fuel composition. Unlike diesel fuels, 

biodiesels are composed by a limited number of compounds, which allows the study of 

the properties of each individual compound and the development of relationships 

between them and the fuel properties. It was thus necessary to study the thermophysical 

properties of the components of biodiesel, namely methyl and ethyl esters of long 

saturated and unsaturated alkyl chains (C8-C22). In this work the focus was on the 

densities and viscosities of the biodiesel fuels and their components. These properties 

were measured not just at temperatures set in the norms, but in a wide range of 

temperatures from 278K to 363K. Concerning the density the influence of pressure has 

been also studied. 

Some biodiesel specifications involve biodiesel performances at low temperature, but 

there is little information about the low-temperature behavior of biodiesel fuels. To 

overcome this limitation, the liquid- and solid- phase composition as well as fractions at 

temperatures below the cloud point were studied. 

Mutual solubilities of fatty acid with water and solubility of water in biodiesel were 

studied due to their importance in biodiesel production and purification. Measurements 

were done to help the development of models to describe the phase equilibria with 

water. 

The possibility of using residual fatty acids, obtained in the process of deodorization 

of edible oils as raw material in fatty acid ester production was also studied. Given the 

limitations of both basic and acid catalysis on this process, enzymatic catalysis was 

attempted in this work using a commercial lipase from Novozymes.

The world energy demand is on the rise. Worldwide energy consumption is 

projected to grow by 53 percent between 2008 and 2035, with much of the increase 

driven by strong economic growth in the developing nations especially China and India. 

In European Union (EU) energy consumption is expected to level out in future but 

world energy consumption will continue to grow due to global population growth and 

economic catching up as shown in Figure 1.1 

 

 

 

Figure 1- World energy demand.1(Mtoe - Million tonnes of oil equivalent) 

 

 

The EU energy mix is slowly changing. Fossil fuels still represent up to 80% of the 

energy mix today. In a “business as usual” scenario, the share may still be 70% by 2030, 

but renewable sources are expected to account for an increasing proportion (Figure2).2,3

The fossil fuel resources are dwindling day by day. Oil is becoming increasingly 

scarce and soon will not be able to meet the numerous demands, arising mainly from the 

transport sector. Decline of available oil reserves and more stringent environmental 

regulations have motivated the global interest in other energy sources. But there are 

other ways of fueling our cars??? That question has already been answered: “The use of 

vegetable oils for engine fuels may seem insignificant today. But such oils may become 

in the course of time as important as the petroleum and coal tar products of the present 

time“. This sentence could be pronounced today, but I am quoting Rudolf Diesel which 

had such a visionary idea in 1900. The concept of using alternative, renewable energy 

was demonstrated by the German engineer at World Exhibition in Paris, the first diesel 

engine using peanut oil as fuel. The engine was built for petroleum and was used with 

the vegetable oil without any change. In this case also, the consumption experiments 

resulted in heat utilization identical to petroleum.4 

The extremely low cost of mineral oils and their abundant supply made research and 

development activities on vegetable oil not seriously pursued. These activities only 

received attention recently when it was realized that petroleum fuels were dwindling 

fast and environment-friendly renewable substitutes ought to be identified. 

Faced with the energy crisis and environmental degradation, due to the massive use of 

fossil energy sources, biodiesel became an attractive alternative to diesel fuel. 

In 2001, the European Commission adopted a policy to promote biofuels for 

transport, and a number of targets were set. The integrated energy and climate change 

strategy agreed at the end of 2008 foresees the share of renewable (such as biofuels) in 

total fuel consumption rising to at least 10 % by 2020, percentage in energy value.5 

Biodiesel production has increased exponentially in the last decade; from worldwide 

negligible productions in 1990 its production reached over 2500 million tons in 2008 

being biodiesel the most used biofuel in Europe.6 

Biofuels are a renewable source of energy that may be described as 'carbon neutral' as 

shown in Figure 4. 

 



 

 

12 

 

 

Figure 4- Biodiesel cycle.7 

 

Biodiesel fuel is seen as an alternative to the conventional petroleum based fuels in 

the transportation sector, being considered as an important short-time option as its 

prices can be similar to petroleum based fuels and no motor changes are required, 

reducing the dependency on fossil fuels and controlling green house gases emissions.4 

Biodiesel fuel advantages and applications are well established as described.4,8-14         

As a fuel it offers many benefits such as ready availability, portability, renewability, 

domestic origin, lower sulfur and aromatic content, biodegradability, better ignition 

quality, inherent lubricity, higher cetane number, positive energy balance, higher 

density, greater safety, nontoxic character of their exhaust emissions and cleaner 

burning.15-18     

Gasoline and diesel come in the category of non-renewable fuel and will last for a 

limited period of time. Another important point is that carbon contained in the fossil 

fuel deposits was removed from the atmosphere millions of years ago and has been 

locked up within Earth's crust ever since. When this fossil carbon is put back into the 

atmosphere as a result of burning fossil fuels, it represents a new input of carbon into 

the modern atmosphere. These non-renewable fuels also emit pollutants in the form of 

oxides of nitrogen, oxides of sulphur, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, lead, 

hydrocarbons, etc. during their processing and use.19 Table 1 presents a brief description 

of advantages and disadvantages of the use of biodiesel fuels.

Having on view the various pro’s and con’s presented in Table 1, no wonder the 

number of studies related to biodiesel has grown exponentially in recent years, as shown 

in the Figure 5.

Figure 5- Exponential increase of publication number per year since 2000 related to 

“biodiesel” theme (based on a search in ISI Web of Knowledge with papers, abstracts 

and patents included). 

 

Biodiesel refers to the pure fuel before blending with neat diesel fuel, namely B100. 

Biodiesel blends are denoted as “BXX” with “XX” representing the percentage of 

biodiesel contained in the blend e.g., B20 is 20% of biodiesel, 80% of petroleum diesel. 

Use of biodiesel can greatly benefit the environment by reducing emissions. Using 

biodiesel instead of conventional diesel reduces emissions such as the overall life cycle 

of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides 

(SOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and unburned hydrocarbons. However, 

while reducing the aforementioned types of emissions, nitrogen oxides (NOx) 

emissions, mostly NO and NO2, are increased. NOx is formed at high temperature in the 

combustion chamber when oxygen and nitrogen combination occurs. This type of NOx 

is generally formed during fuel combustion such as gas or diesel. Nevertheless the 

combustion of biodiesel needs more energy (as oxygen represents in mass 11% of 

biodiesel) and consequently higher temperatures that promote the increase of NOx.
21 

Figure 6 shows the impact that biodiesel-diesel blends have on emissions. 

Photography was taken one minute after start the light, as 4 minutes late in diesel lamp 

it was impossible to see the flame.

As already mentioned chemically the biodiesel is a fuel comprised of mono-alkyl 

esters of long chain fatty acids derived from vegetable oils, animal fats, or mixtures of 

them. It is usually produced by the transesterification reaction of triglycerides with a 

short chain alcohol, generally methanol or ethanol, in presence of a catalyst, leading to 

the formation of mixtures of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) or fatty acid ethyl esters 

(FAEEs) respectively.4, 14 The stoichiometry requires 3 mol of alcohol and 1 mol of 

triglyceride to give 3 mol of fatty acid esters and 1 mol of glycerine, as shown in Figure 

7, where R1, R2 and R3 are alkyl chains derived from fatty acids, which most common 

are presented in Table 2, R4 is the alcohol alkyl chain.
19 22 23 

 

 

Figure 7- Transesterification reaction for biodiesel production. 

 

The transesterification reaction consists of a sequence of reversible reactions that 

occurs in three different steps, in the presence of an alcohol (A). In the first step, 

triglycerides (TG) are converted to diglycerides (DG) which get converted to 

- Nitrogen Oxides (NOx)   - Particulate Matter (PM)    - Carbon Monoxide (CO)   - Hydrocarbons (HC)

monoglycedies (MG) in the next step. In the third and last step monoglycerides are 

converted to glycerol (G). A mole of esters is liberated at each step, normally namely 

fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). Thus three FAMEs are obtained from one 

triglycerides molecule.19 Equation [1] to [3] summarizes the reaction of 

transesterification.

development. The reactions are reversible, although the equilibrium lies towards the 

production of fatty acid esters and glycerol. Figure 8 shows the concentration profiles of 

all components until equilibrium is reached, based in reactions described.

The transesterification can be performed using alkaline, acid, or enzymatic catalysts. 

At industrial scale alkaline catalysis reaction is worldwide used; while acid and 



 

17 

 

enzymatic catalysis have little or no expression. The acid catalysis is slower and 

requires higher temperatures; while the enzymatic catalysis suffers from the enzymes 

being too expensive.24 

There are also two noncatalyzed transesterification processes, namely BIOX process 

and supercritical alcohol process. The BIOX process developed in Canada uses inert co-

solvents that generate an oil-rich one-phase system and with 99% of yield in seconds at 

ambient temperature.25 The supercritical methanol reacts with the oil as a single phase 

reaction, the process involves much simpler purification of products, has lower reaction 

time.26 

In alkaline catalysis of biodiesel several factors affect the transesterification reaction 

as the type of catalyst, the alcohol/oil molar ratio, temperature, the reagents purity, the 

amount of free fatty acids, the alcohol used and the mixing, as this is a two phase 

reaction.23,27 

Methanol is the preferred alcohol due to its low cost, physical and chemical 

advantages in the process.23 Nevertheless, ethanol can prevail in regions where it is less 

expensive than methanol, due to its easier production and accessibility28, and higher 

chain alcohols have as well been suggested.29,30 Moreover, the process is easy to control 

and biodiesel purification easier with methanol than with heavier alcohols.31 An excess 

of alcohol is necessary in order to displace the transesterification reaction towards 

product creation.23 After the reaction is complete, two major products form: glycerin 

and biodiesel. The glycerin phase is denser than the biodiesel phase and the two can be 

gravity separated. 

The basic catalyst is typically sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. As alkali-

catalyzed systems are very sensitive to both water and free fatty acid (FFA) content, the 

glycerides and alcohol must be substantially anhydrous because the water promotes a 

secondary reaction, saponification, which produces soaps, thus consuming the catalyst 

and reducing the catalyst efficiency, as well as causing an increase in viscosity, and 

difficulty in separations.23 Figure 9 shows a flow chart of alkaline catalysis of biodiesel.

content to an acceptable value by the biodiesel required standards (Figure 10 (3)). 

The removal of excess alcohol from the fatty acid ester stream leaving the 

transesterification reactor can be performed by flash evaporation or distillation.23,33 

Distillation is the most used method and the recovered alcohol is re-used in the 

transesterification process.

There are biodiesel properties that directly depend on the raw materials composition 

while others have more dependence on the production process. Knowing the profile 

fatty acid esters in biodiesel is of great importance as it controls some of its properties

At Section 1 Thermodynamic Properties are discussed. Viscosities and densities are 

two of the main properties evaluated in this work which will depend on the raw 

materials used on the biodiesel fuel production and in consequence on the profile of 

methyl or ethyl esters of the biodiesel fuel.36 

Density data are relevant because injection systems, pumps and injectors must deliver 

the amount of fuel precisely adjusted to provide a proper combustion.42 Boudy and 

Seers43,44 showed that the fuel density is the main property that influences the amount of 

mass injected. The viscosity is required not only for the design of pipes, fittings and 

equipment to be used in industry of oil and fuel45, but also for monitoring the quality of 

fuel itself to be used in diesel engines. A viscous fuel, causing a poorer atomization, 

which is the first step of combustion, is responsible for premature injector cooking and 

poor fuel combustion.43,46 

Many studies have been devoted to the measurement and prediction of the density and 

viscosity of biodiesel fuel as function of temperature. Being able to predict those 

properties is of high relevance for the correct formulation of an adequate blend of raw 

materials that optimize the cost of biodiesel fuel production while allowing the fuel to 

meet the required quality standards. 

Inside Section 1 the work addressing the low temperature behavior and phase 

equilibria of biodiesel are also presented. The biodiesel cold flow performance depends 

both on the oil and alcohol used in the transesterification. A biodiesel with a large 

concentration of saturated fatty acid esters, although less vulnerable to oxidation and 

displaying better combustion properties, has a worst performance at low temperatures 

because of its tendency to crystallize.47 This work reports experimental data for the 

solid-liquid-phase equilibria of biodiesel modelled with the UNIQUAC model. 

In the biodiesel production process, the fatty esters rich current coming from the 

reactor is saturated with glycerol, alcohol, catalyst and unreacted soaps. This current is 

washed in a liquid-liquid extractor in counter current with acidified water to neutralize 

the catalyst and to convert soaps to free fatty acids. The raffinate current is composed of 

water saturated biodiesel while the extract is a low pH aqueous solution containing the 

polar compounds33. The design and optimization of the purification of biodiesel with 

water requires a model that can describe the water solubility in biodiesel and mutual 

solubility of fatty acid + water systems. In this work new experimental data was 

successfully modelled with the Cubic-Plus-Association EoS. 



 

25 

 

In fact, in process operation and optimization the use of predictive models for 

biodiesel fuel properties could be a most useful tool. 

Biodiesels with different profile are synthesized and evaluated in this work; 

specifically fatty acid methyl esters of soybean, rapeseed, palm oils and their mixtures 

(binary and ternary) and also, sunflower. The properties that depend on fatty acid profile 

of raw material which are studied are namely density, viscosity, iodine value, and cold 

filter plugging point (CFPP). 

In Section 2 enzymatic catalysis is addressed. Free Fatty Acids (FFA) are a by-

product in edible oil refining, that are removed in the deodorizing step on oil 

purification. The deodorization is carried not just in edible oils but also in some cases 

before alkaline catalysis in biodiesel production. Enzymatic catalysis is here studied as 

an alternative to convert this by-product into biodiesel.

General Context 

Density and Viscosity are an important biodiesel parameter, with impact on fuel 

quality. Predicting these properties is of high relevance for a correct formulation of an 

adequate blend of raw materials that optimize the cost of biodiesel fuel production while 

allowing the produced fuel to meet the required quality standards. 

For the higher FAEEs and FAMEs, the density and viscosity data for a wide range of 

temperatures available in the literature, are either scarce or contradictory, limiting their 

use in the development and testing of models to predict those properties for biodiesels. 

To address this limitation, in this work densities and viscosities of ethyl esters and 

methyl esters, present in biodiesel ranging in alkyl chain from C8 to C18, were 

measured at atmospheric pressure and temperatures from 273.15K to 363.15K, and are 

reported in Paper 1. Some of the minor components of biodiesel have received little 

attention in the past but they may have a non negligible influence on the biodiesel fuel 

properties and, depending on the raw material used, these components can be present in 

a significant concentration. In Paper 2 new density and viscosity data for the minority 

components of biodiesel fuel such as methyl palmitoleate, methyl linolenate, methyl 

arachidate, methyl gadoleate, methyl behenate, methyl erucate, methyl lignocerate, ethyl 

linoleate, ethyl linolenate, and ethyl arachidate, at atmospheric pressure and 

temperatures from 273.15K to 363.15K are presented. 

In both these works, a comparison with the experimental data available and its critical 

evaluation is performed. Correlations of these experimental data using the equations on 

which the multicomponent models are based, a linear correlation of the densities with 

temperature and the Vogel Tamman Fluch (VTF) equation for the viscosities were 

carried and reported. The densities and viscosities of the pure ethyl and methyl esters 

here measured were also used to evaluate the performance of three predictive models. 

The group contribution method GCVOL48 was evaluated for the prediction of densities 

while the models of Ceriani et al.45,49 and Marrero and Gani50,51 were evaluated for the 

viscosity. The behavior of these models is compared against the data for the compounds 

studied. 

  



 

 

30 

 

 

The capacity to correctly predict biodiesel densities is of major relevance for a correct 

formulation of an adequate blend of raw materials aiming at producing biodiesel 

according to the required quality standards52,53 with the lowest production costs. 

There are three main types of methods exist for estimating liquid densities of pure 

compounds. The first type are the methods based on the corresponding states theory, 

such as the Rackett equation and the Spencer and Danner method.16,36,44,54-56      

These methods have, however, some disadvantages such as the requirement of critical 

properties and since they often use experimental data adjusted parameters, they have a 

limited predictive ability. The second type of methods is based on mixing rules, such as 

Kay’s57, that allow the estimation of a mixture density provide that the composition of 

the fuel and the densities of the pure compounds are known. They are only applicable to 

simple mixtures with a near ideal behavior. Finally, the third type is group contribution 

models that only requires the chemical structure of the desired molecule to be known to 

estimate the thermophysical properties, such as liquid densities. The group contribution 

method GCVOL48 is a predictive model that was shown in previous works to be able to 

provide pure fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) densities descriptions within 1% 

deviation. 

In the work presented in Paper 3, new experimental density data was reported for ten 

biodiesel samples, for which a detailed composition is presented. They were produced 

from different vegetable oils or oil blends, in our laboratory. The data covers the 

temperature range from 278.15K to 373.15K at atmospheric pressure. Correlations for 

the temperature dependency of the experimental data are reported and the isobaric 

expansivities estimated. In this paper a comparison between Mixing Rules based in 

different concentration units (molar, volumetric and mass fraction) are presented but the 

aim is the comparison of the predictive capabilities of GCVOL model as well as 

extended CGVOL for the estimation of the density of several biodiesel. A revised 

version of the GCVOL model is also proposed and evaluated. 

These data, along with other data collected from literature, are used to carry out a 

critical evaluation of biodiesel density predictive models. 

Knowledge and description of biodiesel densities as a function of pressure and 

temperature are required for a proper design and optimization of common rail engines 

injection systems, in order to a precisely adjusted amount of fuel be delivered to provide  



 

31 

 

a proper combustion while minimizing NOx emissions42. However, in spite of its 

importance, little attention has been given to high pressure densities of biodiesels and 

measurements and predictions of that property have been restricted to ambient 

conditions. After reporting experimental data for the atmospheric pressure temperature 

dependence of density for several fatty acid methyl and ethyl esters for different 

biodiesels53,52, and studying the best models to predict the densities of biodiesel58, new 

experimental high pressure density data were carried out for several of these pure 

compounds and biodiesels. In Paper 4 new high pressure density data is reported in this 

work for three fatty acid methyl esters and seven biodiesels, in the temperature range 

283K to 333K and from atmospheric pressure up to 45 MPa. Experimental densities 

were correlated using the modified Tait-Tammann equation59 and thermodynamic 

properties such as isothermal compressibilities and isobaric expansion coefficients were 

as well calculated and evaluated, on the temperature and pressure ranges studied. 

Empirical models, like the modified Tait-Tammann equation, are the most commonly 

used to correlate high pressure density experimental data. In this work, a different and 

completely predictive approach was also applied, that consisted on the use of the Cubic-

Plus-Association equation of state (CPA EoS) to describe the experimental data. In 

previous works60 - 62 the CPA EoS was shown to be the most appropriate model to be 

applied to biodiesel production and purification processes. A discussion about the most 

appropriate CPA pure compound parameters for esters is also presented. 

There is still a lack of viscosity data of biodiesel blends and biodiesel-diesel over the 

whole composition range at different operational conditions of pressure and 

temperature. In this regard, the use of theoretical approaches to estimate the viscosity of 

biodiesel systems is of great practical interest and is presented in Paper 5. 

A number of works has presented predictive models and empirical equations with 

adjustable parameters for the viscosity of fatty acid esters. By knowing the viscosity of 

fatty acid esters, it is possible to determine the viscosity of biodiesel using the mixing 

rule suggested by Grunberg-Nissan or Hind63. Moreover there is a possibility to 

optimize its properties by simply changing the composition of fatty acid esters. The 

predictive capabilities of three models developed by Ceriani et al.64, Krisnangkura et 

al65. and Yuan et al.55 for the estimation of the viscosity of several biodiesel and their 

blends with diesel fuels were compared. A revised version of the Yuan model is also 

proposed and evaluated. 



 

 

32 

 

 

Besides density and viscosity there are other properties of biodiesel that can be 

directly related to the chemical composition of the raw material. Iodine index, CP (poor 

point) and CFPP (cold filter plugging point) were studied and evaluated based on norms 

considerations.

My direct contribution for Published Papers 

 

In first Chapter five published articles are presented, all related to new data for 

density and viscosity of biodiesel produced by myself from different oil sources, as well 

for pure components present in biodiesel fuel. All data were measured with a 

Viscometer Anton Parr Strabinger, in a wide range of temperatures. I was responsible 

for experimental measurements of density and viscosity of biodiesel and pure 

compounds, as well as the density modelling. High pressure density was measured on 

different equipment at University of Vigo and the modeling with CPA was also carried 

by me in collaboration with Mariana Belo. Viscosity modelling was made by Samuel 

Freitas.

Experimental section 

Biodiesel Synthesis 

Eight biodiesel samples, studied in this work, were synthesized at our laboratory by a 

transesterification reaction of the vegetal oils: Soybean (S), Rapeseed (R), and Palm (P), 

and their respective binary and ternary mixtures: Soybean+Rapeseed (SR), 

Rapeseed+Palm (RP), Soybean+Palm (SP), and Soybean+Rapeseed +Palm (SRP) and 

Sunflower (Sf). Transesterification reaction for all biodiesel samples was performed 

under specific conditions: the molar ratio of oil/methanol used was 1:5 with 0.5% 

sodium hydroxide by weight of oil as catalyst, the reaction was performed at 55 ºC 

during 24 h under methanol reflux and the reaction time chosen was adopted for 

convenience in order to guarantee a complete reaction conversion of one liter of oil. 

Raw glycerol was removed in two steps, the first after 3 h reaction and then after 24 h 

reaction in a separating funnel. Figure 11 shows the biodiesel production.

Biodiesel was purified by washing with hot distilled water until a neutral pH was 

achieved. The biodiesel was then dried until the EN ISO 12937 limit for water was 

reached (less than 500 ppm of water). The water content was checked by Karl- Fischer 

titration. 

It is necessary to present here additional information about biodiesel synthesis, as the 

procedure was adjusted during the work after testing several variables. For a correct 

characterization of biodiesel it is necessary to obtain close to 100% conversion on the 

reaction. This prevents the contamination of intermediate species as mono-, di-, and tri-

glycerides in the biodiesel with important impacts on the fuel properties. 

There are a lot of publications that report biodiesel productions in shorter times (3-4 

hours of synthesis). In the beginning of the present work this method was also followed 

but at some point we realized that the biodiesels did not possess a good quality level, as 

the yield was less than 90%. The presence of intermediate species in biodiesel 

influences dramatically their thermodynamic properties. Viscosities data were measured 

in these conditions and were used as training set to test the model developed by Ceriani 

et al.56 for the estimation of viscosity of fatty compounds and biodiesel esters as a 

function of the temperature and also to investigate the influence of small concentrations 

of intermediate compounds of transesterification reaction in the viscosity of 

biodiesels.57  

The conditions to produce biodiesel were tuned until conversion reaction obtained 

presented yields of more than 96%. Therefore the reaction time was increased to a limit 

value to guarantee a complete reaction conversion. 

 

Biodiesel Characterization 

Biodiesel was characterized by GC-FID following the British Standard EN14103 

from EN 142144 to know the alkyl esters composition of the samples. A Varian CP-

3800 with a flame ionization detector in a split injection system with a Select™ 

Biodiesel for FAME Column, (30 m x 0.32 mm x 0.25 µm), was used to discriminate 

between all methyl esters in analysis inclusively the polyunsaturated ones. The column 

temperature was set at 120ºC and then programmed to increase up to 250 ºC, at 4 

ºC/min. Detector and injector were set at 250ºC. The carrier gas was helium with a flow 

rate of 2 mL/min. Methyl heptadecanoate was used as internal standard.

Abstract 

To develop reliable models for the densities and viscosities of biodiesel fuel reliable 

data for the pure fatty acid esters are required. Densities and viscosities were measured 

for seven ethyl esters and eight methyl esters, at atmospheric pressure and temperatures 

from (273.15 to 363.15) K. A critical assessment of the measured data against the data 

previously available in the literature was carried out. It is shown that the data here 

reported presents deviations of less than 0.15 % for densities and less than 5 % for 

viscosities. Correlations for the densities and viscosities with temperature are proposed. 

The densities and viscosities of the pure ethyl and methyl esters here reported were used 

to evaluate three predictive models. The GCVOL group contribution method is shown 

to be able to predict densities for these compounds within 1 %. The methods of Ceriani 

and Meirelles (CM) and of Marrero and Gani (MG) were applied to the viscosity data. It 

is shown that only the first of these methods is able to provide a fair description of the 

viscosities of fatty acid esters.

Introduction 

 

In consequence of environmental, economical and also political turmoil, caused by 

the excessive use and dependency of conventional petroleum based fuels the attention of 

several countries has been addressed towards the development of alternative fuels from 

renewable resources.1,2 

Among those alternatives, biodiesel fuel, along with bioethanol fuel, is in the 

forefront of the substitutes to petroleum based fuels in the transportation sector, being 

considered as an important short-time option as its prices can be similar to petroleum 

based fuels and no motor changes are required.3 

Biodiesel is a fuel comprised of mono-alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids derived 

from vegetable oils, animal fats, or mixtures of them. It is produced by the 

transesterification of triglycerides with a short chain alcohol, usually methanol or 

ethanol, in presence of a catalyst, leading to the formation of mixtures of fatty acid 

methyl esters (FAMEs) or fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) respectively.3,4 The main 

components of biodiesel fuel are palmitate, stearate, oleate and linoleate esters.5 

However, and depending on the raw materials used, a larger range of esters can be 

present.6 

The biodiesel fuel has to fulfill a number of quality standards. In Europe the biodiesel 

fuel standards are compiled in the Norm CEN EN 142147, and in United States of 

America in the Norm ASTM D67518. Norms specify minimum requirements and test 

methods for biodiesel fuel to be used in diesel engines and for heating purposes, in 

order to increase the biodiesel fuel quality and its acceptance among consumers. 

Viscosities and densities are two of the main properties evaluated which will depend on 

the raw materials used on the biodiesel fuel production and in consequence on the 

profile of methyl or ethyl esters of the biodiesel fuel.6 

Density data are relevant because injection systems, pumps and injectors must deliver 

the amount of fuel precisely adjusted to provide proper combustion.9 Boudy and Seers 

show that fuel density is the main property that influences the amount of mass 

injected.10,11 The viscosity is required not only for the design of pipes, fittings and 

equipment to be used in industry of oil and fuel12, but also for monitoring the quality of 

fuel itself to be used in diesel engines. A viscous fuel, causing a poorer atomization, 



 

 

44 

 

which is the first step of combustion, is responsible for premature injector cooking and 

poor fuel combustion.10, 13 

Many studies have been devoted to the measurement and prediction of the density and 

viscosity of biodiesel fuel as function of temperature. Being able to predict those 

properties is of high relevance for the correct formulation of an adequate blend of raw 

materials that optimize the cost of biodiesel fuel production while allowing the fuel to 

meet the required quality standards. In fact, in process operation and optimization the 

use of correlative and predictive models for biodiesel fuel properties could be a most 

useful tool. 

Several models have been proposed in the literature to calculate biodiesel fuel density. 

The most important among them rely on the accurate knowledge of the properties of the 

pure compounds. Tat and Van Gerpen14 and Clements15 used a linear mixing rule of 

pure densities based on the empirical equation proposed by Janarthanan15. Huber16 et al. 

also use density mixing rule to develop preliminary thermodynamic model for biodiesel 

fuel fuel. Similarly for the viscosities the approaches proposed by Krisnangkura et al.17 

and Yuan et al.18 allow the estimation of the viscosity of biodiesel fuel using the 

Grunberg-Nissan equation that requires accurate values of the viscosities of pure 

FAME’s or FAEE’s19. 

For the higher FAEEs and FAMEs, the density and viscosity data for a wide range of 

temperatures available in the literature are sometimes scarce or contradictory, limiting 

the use of these models to predict those properties for biodiesels. 

To address this limitation, in this work densities and viscosities of seven ethyl esters 

and eight methyl esters, from C8 to C18, were measured at atmospheric pressure and 

temperatures from (273.15 to 363.15) K. A comparison with the experimental data 

available and its critical evaluation is performed. Correlations of these experimental 

data using the equations on which the multicomponent models are based, a linear 

correlation of the densities with temperature and the Vogel Tamman Fluch (VTF) 

equation for the viscosities were carried and reported. 

The densities and viscosities of the pure ethyl and methyl esters here measured were 

also used to evaluate the performance of three predictive models. The group 

contribution method GCVOL20 was evaluated for the prediction of densities while the 

models of Ceriani et al.12 and Marrero and Gani21,22 were evaluated for the viscosity.

Experimental Measurements. Measurements of viscosity and density were 

performed in the temperature range of (273.15 to 363.15) K at atmospheric pressure 

using an automated SVM 3000 Anton Paar rotational Stabinger viscometer-densimeter. 

The viscometer is based on a tube filled with the sample in which floats a hollow 

measuring rotor.  



 

 

46 

 

 

Due to its low density, the rotor is centered in the heavier liquid by buoyancy forces. 

Consequently, a measuring gap is formed between the rotor and the tube. The rotor is 

forced to rotate by shear stresses in the liquid and is guided axially by a built-in 

permanent magnet, which interacts with a soft iron ring. The rotating magnetic field 

delivers the speed signal and induces Eddy currents in the surrounding copper casing. 

These Eddy currents are proportional to the speed of the rotor and exert a retarding 

torque on the rotor. Two different torques influence the speed of the measuring rotor, 

and at the equilibrium, the two torques are equal and the viscosity can be traced back to 

a single speed measurement. The SVM 3000 uses Peltier elements for fast and efficient 

thermostability. The temperature uncertainty is 0.02 K from (288.15 to 378.15) K. The 

absolute uncertainty of the density is 0.0005 g•cm-3 and the relative uncertainty of the 

dynamic viscosity obtained is less than 1.5 % for the standard fluid SHL120 (SH 

Calibration Service GMbH), in the range of the studied temperatures. The repeatability 

of the equipment was measured with temperature and presents a maximum standard 

deviation relative value of 0.15 % in the studied viscosity range for the same 

temperature range. Also the reproducibility of the equipment was evaluated with time 

and presents a maximum of 0.25 %.23 Further details about the equipment and method 

can be found elsewhere.24 This viscometer was previously tested for other compounds 

and presented a very good reproducibility.25

Data shows that the density of FAMEs decreases with increasing alkyl chain length, 

and increases with the level of unsaturation, the same happening with FAEEs. 

Surprisingly the FAMEs present a higher value for density than the corresponding 

FAEEs with the same number of carbon atoms in acid side chain. This difference is 

higher than what would be expected from the addition of a methylene (CH2) group to 

the molecule. This results from a change in the ordering of the molecules in the liquid 

state akin to what can be observed in the crystal structures of methyl stearate and ethyl 

stearate.26 It was also previously observed for other light esters that the addition of CH2 

group in to the alcohol moiety induces a lower molecular packing efficiency decreasing 

density.27 

Figures 1 and 2 present the relative deviations between this work’s experimental data 

and density data available in the literature as function of temperature for FAEEs and 

FAMEs, respectively. This comparison shows a good agreement with relative average 

deviation of lower than 0.10 % for FAEEs and lower than 0.15 % for FAMEs, with 

exception methyl stearate measured by Gaikward and Subrahmanyan28, that presents a 

deviation below 0.25 % and methyl palmitate measured by Ott et al.29 that present a 

relative deviation of -0.25 %. The density values for methyl palmitate reported in this 

work were repeated using samples from various suppliers with a good agreement among 

them and with the data previously reported in the literature by other authors for this 

compound.28, 30-32

The GCVOL model20 was used to predict the densities of the compounds studied in 

this work. The results reported in Figure 3 show that the densities of FAMEs can be 

predicted within an uncertainty of ± 0.5 % with exception of methyl linoleate due to a 

poor model description of the unsaturation effect on the densities. In Figure 4 the 

deviations for the FAEE’s are reported. Due to the different effect of the introduction of 

a methylene group in the acid or alcohol moieties discussed above a group contribution 

model cannot produce an adequate description of the densities and an overestimation of 

between 1 and 1.5 % of the experimental densities is obtained. Again a problem 

associated to the unsaturation is observed although in this case it contributes to 

minimize the model deviations.

the temperature range investigated. The isobaric expansivities estimated from the 

experimental data are reported in Table 5. It is observed that ?p decreases with the 

increment of carbons in alkyl acid side chain and also decreases with unsaturation level 

for both ethyl and methyl esters. The isobaric expansivities are identical for the FAMEs 

and FAEEs within the experimental uncertainty of the data here reported.

Viscosity 

The experimental data of viscosity of the ethyl and methyl esters here studied are 

reported in Tables 6 and 7 respectively. As expected the viscosity of all esters increases 

with the ester chain length and decreases with its level of unsaturation. The ethyl esters 

also present a higher viscosity than the corresponding methyl ester of the equivalent 

fatty acid.

The experimental data here measured was compared with viscosity data previously 

reported in the literature for the same systems. The relative deviations for the FAMEs 

and FAEEs are presented in Figures 7 and 8. For the FAMEs the deviations are within ± 

4 % of the literature data with exception of the data by Meirelles et al.33 at high 

temperatures that show large deviations when compared with both our data and data 

from other authors. For the FAEEs the data available is far more scarce but in spite of 

being more than 50 years old it is in good agreement with the viscosities here reported 

with relative deviations of less than 1 %.

The measured data were also used to test two predictive viscosity models. The Ceriani 

and Meirelles 33(CM) and the Marrero and Gani21,22 (MG) group contribution models 

were used to estimate the dynamic viscosity of the fatty acid esters as a function of 

temperature. The average deviations of viscosity between the measured data and those 

estimated by CM and MG are shown in Table 9. 

 

 

Table 9. Average Deviation between the Measured Viscosity of Pure Ethyl and Methyl 

Esters over the Temperature Range (278.15 to 363.15) K and those Estimated 

by CM and MG Models. 

 CM (%) MG (%)

Ethyl Caprate 13.0 18.6 

Ethyl Laurate 3.35 18.9 

Ethyl Myristate 6.47 20.8

The CM method predicts the experimental data here measured with a global deviation 

of 4.53 % for FAMEs with maximum deviations of 9.50 % while for FAEEs the 

average deviations are of 7.92 % with maximum deviations of 14.8 %.

The MG method is far less accurate with average deviations of 12.0 % and 23.5 % for 

FAMEs and FAEEs respectively and maximum deviations of 25.5 % and 54.6 %. While 

the CM method provides a good description of the viscosities the deviations for the 

FAEEs are clearly superior than for FAMEs, meaning that the inclusion of a methyl 

group affects the viscosities differently depending on its location as also observed for 

the densities. Moreover this model also provides poor estimates for the viscosities of 

unsaturated esters at high temperatures. This may be related with the use of Ceriani et 

al.33 data on the estimation of the model parameters that, as discussed above, present 

large deviations from the data of other authors. 

 

Conclusions 

 

New experimental data for the density and viscosity of pure saturated and unsaturated 

methyl and ethyl esters in the temperature range (273 to 363) K and at atmospheric 

pressure are presented. An extensive critical review of the data available for these 

systems was carried out to identify spurious or poor quality data among the often 

conflicting data previously available in the literature. 

The experimental data here reported were used to test predictive models for these 

properties. The liquid densities were compared with GCVOL model predictions to show 

that it is able to describe the FAMEs with deviations smaller than 1 %. However, larger 

deviations were found for the correlation of FAEEs densities and GCVOL model 

predicted values, presenting a maximum deviation from the experimental data of 1.5 %. 

The Ceriani and Meirelles method is shown to be superior to the Marrero and Gani 

method with viscosity predictions with an average deviation of 4.53 % for FAMEs and 

7.92 % for FAEEs.

Abstract 

Biodiesel has several known components in their composition. The majority 

components are well described in literature but minority components are poorly 

characterized. These are however required to develop reliable models to predict the 

biodiesel behavior. This work considers minor components of biodiesel: the 

polyunsaturated compounds (in C18), the mono unsaturated (in C16, C20 and C22) and 

the long chain saturated esters. In this work densities and viscosities of pure fatty acid 

esters minor components of biodiesel fuel were measured (three ethyl esters and seven 

methyl esters), at atmospheric pressure and temperatures from (273.15 to 373.15) K. 

Correlations for the densities and viscosities with temperature are proposed. Three 

predictive models were evaluated in the prediction of densities and viscosities of the 

pure ethyl and methyl esters here reported. The GCVOL group contribution method is 

shown to be able to predict densities for these compounds within 1.5 %. The methods of 

Ceriani et al. (CM) and of Marrero et al. (MG) were applied to the viscosity data. The 

first show a better predictive capacity to provide a fair description of the viscosities of 

the minority esters here studied.

Introduction 

 

Nowadays, biodiesel fuel is seen as an alternative to the conventional petroleum based 

fuels, reducing the dependency on fossil fuels and controlling green house gases 

emissions.1 Biodiesel fuel advantages and applications are well established.2-9 This 

biofuel is comprised of mono-alkyl esters of fatty acids derived from vegetable oils, 

animal fats, or mixtures of them. It is usually produced by the transesterification 

reaction of triglycerides with a short chain alcohol, usually methanol or ethanol, in 

presence of a catalyst, leading to the formation of mixtures of fatty acid methyl esters 

(FAMEs) or fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), respectively.7, 9 The main components of 

biodiesel fuel depend on the raw materials used and, consequently, a wide range of 

esters can be present.10 Knowing the profile of methyl or ethyl esters in biodiesel is of 

great importance as it controls its main properties.10 

The fuel density influences the amount of mass injected at the injection systems, 

pumps and injectors.11-12 An amount of fuel precisely adjusted is necessary to provide 

proper combustion.13 Combustion is initialized trough atomization of the fuel. The use 

of a viscous fuel leads to a poor atomization which is responsible of premature injector 

cooking and poor fuel combustion.11, 14 

Densities and viscosities data are well established for the more important biodiesel 

compounds, however some of the minor components have received little attention in the 

past. However, they may have a non negligible influence on the biodiesel fuel properties 

and, depending on the raw material used, these components can be present in a 

significant concentration. 

The main goal of this work is to present new density and viscosity data for the 

minority components of biodiesel fuel such as methyl palmitoleate, methyl linolenate, 

methyl arachidate, methyl gadoleate, methyl behenate, methyl erucate, methyl 

lignocerate, ethyl linoleate, ethyl linolenate, and ethyl arachidate, at atmospheric 

pressure and temperatures from (273.15 to 363.15) K. Some of these esters can be found 

in biodiesel fuel from peanut, rapeseed or canola oils.9 

Among the studied esters, density data with temperature has been found only for 

methyl linolenate. Ott el al.15 compiled the available density data. Besides the seven 

points reported by them only Gouw and Vlugter16 measured two other data points, in 



 

 

68 

 

1964. For the other esters some isolated density data were obtained from the 

compound’s supplier. 

As experimental measurements are time consuming and expensive, especially for 

these minority biodiesel esters components, new models are necessary to predict these 

properties. 

Several models have been proposed in the literature to estimate biodiesel fuel density 

and viscosity. The most important among them rely on the accurate knowledge of the 

properties of the pure compounds.17 However, the scarcity of density and viscosity data 

available in the literature restricts the use of these models to predict properties for 

biodiesel fuel. In a previous work17, the densities and viscosities of common pure 

methyl and ethyl esters were measured and used to evaluate the performance of three 

predictive models. For prediction of density the group contribution method GCVOL18 

model was evaluated while the models of Ceriani et al.19 and Marrero et al. 20 were 

tested for the viscosity. The behavior of these models is here compared against the data 

for the compounds here studied. 

 

Experimental Section 

 

Materials and Procedure. Three ethyl ester and seven methyl esters were used in this 

study. Table 1 reports the name, purity, supplier, and CAS number of each compound 

used in this study. Compound purity was confirmed by gas chromatography/flame 

ionization detection (GC-FID). 

 

Experimental Measurements. Measurements of viscosity and density were performed 

in the temperature range of (273.15 to 373.15) K, or above melting point for saturated 

compounds, at atmospheric pressure using an automated SVM 3000 Anton Paar 

rotational Stabinger viscometer-densimeter. The viscometer is based on a tube filled 

with the sample in which floats a hollow measuring rotor. Because of its low density, 

the rotor is centered in the heavier liquid by buoyancy forces. Consequently, a 

measuring gap is formed between the rotor and the tube. The rotor is forced to rotate by 

shear stresses in the liquid and is guided axially by a built-in permanent magnet, which 

interacts with a soft iron ring. The rotating magnetic field delivers the speed signal and 

induces Eddy currents in the surrounding copper casing. These eddy currents are 



 

69 

 

proportional to the speed of the rotor and exert a retarding torque on the rotor. Two 

different torques influence the speed of the measuring rotor, and at the equilibrium, the 

two torques are equal and the viscosity can be traced back to a single speed 

measurement. The SVM 3000 uses Peltier elements for fast and efficient 

thermostability. The temperature uncertainty is 0.02 K from (288.15 to 378.15) K. The 

absolute uncertainty of the density is 0.0005 g•cm-3 and the relative uncertainty of the 

dynamic viscosity obtained is less than 0.5 % for the standard fluid SHL120 (SH 

Calibration Service GMbH), in the range of the studied temperatures. Further details 

about the equipment and method can be found elsewhere.21 This viscometer was 

previously tested for other compounds and presented a very good reproducibility.17, 22 

 

Results and Discussion 

 

Density. The experimental data obtained are reported in Table 2. For ethyl and methyl 

arachidate, methyl behenate, and methyl lignocerate the measurements were only 

carried out at temperatures above the melting point of these compounds.

In Figure 1 deviations from experimental values and available data were presented. 

Methyl linolenate is the only compound for which data is available in a wide 

temperature range15 presenting a deviation of 0.3 % against the experimental data here 

reported. For some of the other compounds only the supplier data were available to 

compare with measured data23. A few isolated points for erucate methyl ester16 and 

linoleate ethyl ester24 were also identified. The relative deviations of these data are less 

than 2%.

linolenate; ?, methyl palmitoleate; ?, methyl linolenate; and ?, methyl 

erucate. Zero line is this work’s experimental data. 

 

A linear temperature dependency using an optimized algorithm based on the least-

squares method was used to correlate the experimental density data measured, and the 

parameter values along with their confidence limits are reported in Table 3. This 

approach was already adopted previously for common pure methyl and ethyl esters.17

A number of models to describe the density can be found in literature, often based on 

the Racket equation12, 25-27, but since they require experimental data adjusted parameters 

they are not predictive. 

The group contribution method GCVOL model18 was here used to predict the molar 

volumes and the densities of the compounds studied in this work. Figures 2 and 3 show 

GCVOL deviations on the density property predicted for FAEEs and FAMEs, 

respectively, where unsaturated esters are represented by full symbols and saturated by 

empty symbols. The results reported that the densities of FAME and FAEE can be 

predicted within a deviation of ± 1.5 %, with exception of linolenate esters for higher 

temperatures due to a poor model description of the poliunsaturation effect on the 

densities.

To better ascertain the experimental data of viscosity here measured, these were 

compared with literature data as shown in Figure 4. Unfortunately the comparison 

limited due to the lack of viscosity data in literature for the esters here studied. Only 

viscosities of four FAMES and one FAEE 28-31 were found and used on this comparison. 

The relative deviations observed reached a maximum deviation of 15 % against the data 

by Meirelles et al. 19 as discussed in a previous work17 these deviations must be due to 

experimental problems on the data reported by the authors.

The Vogel Tammann-Fulcher equation (3) was used to describe the experimental 

viscosities as a function of temperature.

in conjunction with their uncertainty and the average absolute deviations (AAD %) of

The Ceriani et al.19 (CM) and the Marrero et al.32 (MG) group contribution models 

were evaluates against the viscosity data here measured. The deviations between the 

experimental and predicted viscosities are shown in Table 7. The CM model presented 

an overall deviation of 11.9 % for all minority esters studied with the maximum 

deviations of 21.7 % for ethyl linolenate and 25.9 % for methyl linolenate respectively. 

These deviations denote some limitations of CM model in predicting viscosity of the 

unsaturated esters. The MG method is much less accurate with an overall AAD of 25.7 

%, and large deviations for all minority esters.

Conclusions 

 

New experimental data for the densities and viscosities of pure saturated and 

unsaturated methyl and ethyl esters from minority biodiesel fuel composition, in the 

temperature range (273 to 363) K and at atmospheric pressure are presented. New 

correlations of the density and viscosity dependency with temperature are also 

proposed. The experimental data here reported were used to test density and viscosity 

predictive models. 

The GCVOL model predictions were compared with the experimental liquid densities 

to show that it is able to describe the FAMEs and FAEEs densities with deviations 

smaller than 1 % for saturated compounds and 2 % for unsaturated. 

The Ceriani et al. method showed to be superior to the Marrero et al. method in terms 

of predictive ability for viscosities, presenting an overall average deviation of 11.9 % 

for all minority esters here studied.

Abstract 

Density is an important biodiesel parameter with impact on fuel quality. Predicting 

density is of high relevance for a correct formulation of an adequate blend of raw 

materials that optimize the cost of biodiesel fuel production while allowing the 

produced fuel to meet the required quality standards. The aim of this work is to present 

new density data for different biodiesels and use the reported data to evaluate the 

predictive capability of models previously proposed to predict biodiesel or fatty acid 

methyl esters densities. Densities were measured here for ten biodiesel samples, for 

which detailed composition is reported, at atmospheric pressure and temperatures from 

278.15 to 373.15 K. Density dependence with temperature correlations was proposed 

for the biodiesels and isobaric expansivities are presented. The new experimental data 

here presented were used, along with other literature data, to evaluate predictive density 

models such as those based on Kay’s mixing rules and the GCVOL group contribution 

method. It is shown that Kay’s mixing rules and a revised form of GCVOL model are 

able to predict biodiesels densities with average deviations of only 0.3%. A comparison 

between biodiesel densities produced from similar vegetable oils, by different authors, 

highlights the importance of knowing the detailed composition of the samples. An 

extension of GCVOL for high pressures is also proposed here. It is shown that it can 

predict the densities of biodiesel fuels with average deviations less than 0.4%.

1. Introduction 

 

Biodiesel is a promising alternative energy resource for diesel fuel, consisting of alkyl 

monoesters of fatty acids, obtained from vegetable oils or animal fats combined with a 

short chain alcohol. It has properties similar to ordinary diesel fuel made from crude oil 

and can be used in conventional diesel engines without any motorization 

transformation. Transesterification by alkaline catalysis is the most common process for 

producing biodiesel at industrial level. Biodiesel is more environmentally friendly, 

nontoxic and biodegradable compared to diesel fuel.1-3  

Biodiesel fuel has to fulfill a number of quality standards. In Europe, the biodiesel 

fuel standards are compiled in the Norm CEN EN 142144 and in USA in the ASTM 

D67515. Norms specify minimum requirements and test methods for biodiesel fuel to be 

used in diesel engines and for heating purposes, in order to increase the biodiesel fuel 

quality and its acceptance among consumers. Density is an important fuel property, 

because injection systems, pumps and injectors, must deliver an amount of fuel 

precisely adjusted to provide proper combustion.6 Boudy and Seers7 and Baroutian et 

al.8 show that fuel density is the main property that influences the amount of mass 

injected. Density data is also important in numerous unit operations in biodiesel 

production. Density data is required to be known to properly design reactors, distillation 

units and separation process, storage tanks and process piping.9,10 Density depends on 

the raw materials used for biodiesel fuel production and on the biodiesel methyl esters 

profile.11 Following a previous work addressing biodiesels viscosity predictions 12, this 

work aims at evaluating the best predictive models for biodiesel densities and 

subsequent revision of them. 

Rapeseed, soybean and palm oils are the most commonly used oils to produce 

biodiesel, although non edible oils, such as Jatropha, are becoming more important.9 

The capacity to correctly predict biodiesel densities is of major relevance for a correct 

formulation of an adequate blend of raw materials aiming at producing biodiesel 

according to the required quality standards13,14 with the lowest production costs. 

Three main types of methods exist for estimating liquid densities of pure compounds. 

The first types are the methods based on the corresponding states theory, such as the 

Rackett equation and the Spencer and Danner method.8,9,11,15-19 These methods have, 



 

 

86 

 

however, some disadvantages such as the requirement of critical properties and since 

they oftenly use experimental data adjusted parameters, they have a limited predictive 

ability. The second type of methods is based on mixing rules, such as Kay’s20,21 that 

allow the estimation of a mixture density provide that the composition of the fuel and 

the densities of the pure compounds are known. They are only applicable to simple 

mixtures with a near ideal behavior. Finally, group contribution models are another 

approach that only requires the chemical structure of the desired molecule to be known 

to estimate the thermophysical properties, such as liquid densities. The group 

contribution method GCVOL22 is a predictive model that was shown in previous 

works13,14 to be able to provide pure fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) densities 

descriptions within 1% deviation. 

There are several publications in the literature presenting density data for biodiesels in 

wide ranges of temperatures, but usually no information about biodiesels compositions 

is provided and thus this data cannot be used for model evaluation. The scarcity of 

biodiesel density data for which composition information is available, limits the use of 

these models to predict this property for biodiesel fuels. 

In the present work, we report new experimental density data for ten biodiesel 

samples, for which a detailed composition is presented. They were produced from 

different vegetable oils or oil blends as reported below. The data cover the temperature 

range from 278.15 to 373.15 K at atmospheric pressure. Correlations for the 

temperature dependency of the experimental data are reported and the isobaric 

expansivities estimated. 

These data, along with other data collected from literature, are used to carry out a 

critical evaluation of biodiesel density predictive models. 

 

2. Experimental Section 

 

2.1. Biodiesel samples synthesis 

Ten biodiesel samples were studied in this work. Two of these samples were obtained 

from Portuguese biodiesel producers, namely Soy A and GP (Soybean+Rapeseed). 

Eight biodiesel samples were synthesized at our laboratory by a transesterification 

reaction of the vegetal oils: Soybean (S), Rapeseed (R), and Palm (P), and their 



 

87 

 

respective binary and ternary mixtures: Soybean+Rapeseed (SR), Rapeseed+Palm (RP), 

Soybean+Palm (SP), and Soybean+Rapeseed +Palm (SRP) and Sunflower (Sf). The 

molar ratio of oil/methanol used was 1:5 with 0.5% sodium hydroxide by weight of oil 

as catalyst. The reaction was performed at 55 ºC during 24 h under methanol reflux. The 

reaction time chosen was adopted for convenience and to guarantee a complete reaction 

conversion. Raw glycerol was removed in two steps, the first after 3 h reaction and then 

after 24 h reaction in a separating funnel. Biodiesel was purified by washing with hot 

distillated water until a neutral pH was achieved. The biodiesel was then dried until the 

EN ISO 12937 limit for water was reached (less than 500 ppm of water). The water 

content was checked by Karl- Fischer titration.  

Biodiesel was characterized by GC-FID following the British Standard EN14103 

from EN 142144 to know the methyl esters composition of the samples. 

 

2.2 Experimental Measurements 

Density measurements were performed in the temperature range of 278.15 to 373.15 

K and at atmospheric pressure using an automated SVM 3000 Anton Paar rotational 

Stabinger Viscometer. The apparatus was equipped with a vibrating U-tube densimeter. 

The absolute uncertainty of the density is 0.0005 kg·m-3. The SVM 3000 uses Peltier 

elements for fast and efficient thermostability. The temperature uncertainty is ±0.02 K 

from 288.15 to 378.15 K. The SVM was previously tested for other compounds and 

presented a very good reproducibility.13,23 The instrument was rinsed with ethanol 

three times and then pumped in a closed circuit at constant flow of the solvent during 

twenty minutes at 323 K. This cleaning cycle was repeated with acetone and then kept 

at 343 K for thirty minutes under a stream of air to ensure that the measurement cell was 

thoroughly cleaned and dried before the measurement of a new sample. 

Capillary gas chromatography was used to determine the composition in methyl ester 

of biodiesel samples. A Varian CP-3800 with a flame ionization detector in a split 

injection system with a Select™ Biodiesel for FAME Column, (30 m x 0.32 mm x 0.25 

µm), was used to discriminate between all methyl esters in analysis inclusively the 

polyunsaturated ones. The column temperature was set at 120ºC and then programmed 

to increase up to 250 ºC, at 4 ºC/min. Detector and injector were set at 250ºC. The 

carrier gas was helium with a flow rate of 2 mL/min.

3. Density models 

3.1. Linear Mixing Rules 

Kay’s Mixing Rules20,21 are the simplest form of mixing rules by which mixture 

properties are obtained by summing the products of the component properties by 

weighting factors, which are usually the concentrations of the components in a mixture. 

For example, 

i

m

i
ic ?? ?=  Eq. 1 

where ci is the concentration and ?i is the density of component i. 

The major drawback in the application of linear mixing rules is that they require the 

knowledge of the experimental densities of the pure components present on the mixture 

and assume that the mixture excess volumes are negligible. This may be not feasible for 

many real fluids because they are either composed by a large number of compounds or 

they have different natures and subsequently the excess volumes are non negligible. 

However biodiesels are simple mixtures composed, in general, by less than ten fatty 

acid esters all from the same family and consequently excess volumes are very small. In 

fact, they have been used before by several authors to predict biodiesels densities. 

Janarthanan and Clemments24 first used this approach with molar fraction as weighting 

factors. Tat and Gerpen18 proposed the use of mass fractions as weighting factor. 

Nevertheless, the dimensionally correct way to use concentrations in Kay’s mixing rules 

to predict densities would be as volumetric fractions. Recently, new accurate 

information about biodiesels fatty acid methyl esters composition was reported13,14 

allowing the application of Kay’s Mixing Rules to predict biodiesels density data 

 

3.2. GCVOL Group Contribution Method 

GCVOL is a group contribution method developed for the prediction of molar 

volumes of liquids. It is a completely predictive model based exclusively in the 

molecular structure of the compound. With this approach liquid densities, even for 

strongly polar solvents, can be predicted with an error of approximately 1% in the 

temperature range between melting temperature and the normal boiling point.22  

 



 

89 

 

In previous works13,14 we have shown that good descriptions of fatty esters densities 

could be obtained with this model. 

For the calculation of liquid densities the relation between molecular weight, MWj, 

and molar volume, Vj, is used 

j

Being xj the molar fraction of the component j. The molar volume of a liquid j is 

calculated by the following equation 

? ?=

iinV ?  Eq. 3 
where ni is the number of group i, and the temperature dependency of molar group, 

??i, in cm3·mol-1, is given by the following simple polynomial function 
2TCTBAv iiii ?+?+=?  Eq. 4 

where T is the absolute temperature that can vary between the melting point and the 

normal boiling point when the model is used to predict densities of solvents. The Ai, Bi 

and Ci parameters were obtained from Elbro et al.
22 The original GCVOL model 

presented 36 different group parameters for a variety of chemical classes, such as 

alkanes, aromatic, alkenes, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, esters, ethers, chlorides, and 

siloxanes. 

 

3.3. Extended GCVOL Group Contribution Method 

Since the publication of GCVOL in 1991 other new groups were defined and new 

parameters for different functional groups were published. In 2003 an extension and 

revised version of GCVOL, with new parameters for all groups, was published.25 This 

version of the GCVOL was also tested in this work.  

 

3.4. Database for Biodiesels Densities 

Although some biodiesel density data can be found in literature, information 

concerning the detailed biodiesel composition, other than just the oil used in the 



 

 

90 

 

biodiesel synthesis, is scarce. Densities in a range of temperature, instead of the 

standard value at 15 ºC required by the EN 142144, are also rare. 

Detailed biodiesel composition is required for the application of the models here 

selected. The database used in this study, reported in Table 1, was collected from the 

literature and supplemented with the new experimental data for ten biodiesels measured 

in this work. The most important oils used in biodiesel production (soy, rapeseed and 

palm) were covered by this study, and mixtures of them as well as other vegetable oils 

(sunflower and two biodiesel samples from a Portuguese biodiesel producer) were also 

used. Literature soybean biodiesel density data were compiled even without information 

about esters composition, in order to compare density data from distinct oil crops of the 

same kind.

New experimental density data for eight biodiesels synthesized in this work and for 

two industrial biodiesels are reported in Table 2. For palm oil biodiesel, measurements 

were only carried at temperatures above its cloud point. Table 3 reports the methyl 

esters compositions of the studied biodiesels.

The experimental data show that the biodiesels density decreases with increasing 

temperature and with the level of unsaturation of the FAMEs, as expected from 

previous works13,14 where the same behavior for pure compounds was observed.

The density data here measured were correlated using a linear temperature 

dependency using an optimization algorithm based on the least-squares method,

This approach was already adopted previously for several pure methyl and ethyl esters.

reported is estimated at 298 K and will be here taken as a constant for the biodiesel fuels 

studied. The isobaric expansivities estimated for the different biodiesels are reported in 

Table 5. These values are similar to those for other biodiesel fuels previously reported 

in the literature and to the expansivities observed for pure fatty acid methyl esters. 13,14 

Though the ?p values obtained are statistically similar a trend with the unsaturation

Three versions of the Kay’s Mixing Rule, with mass, molar and volumetric fractions, 

were used to predict the biodiesels densities. Pure compound densities were obtained 

from our previous works13,14. Detailed results are reported on Table 6 for all the 

biodiesel studied. Very good predictions were obtained with all the three approaches 

considered, with ARD of about 0.33%. No significant differences between the results 

obtained with the different versions of the Kay’s Mixing Rule are observed, what may 

come as a surprise but that can easily be justified by the similarity of the compounds, in 

nature and size, present in the biodiesels, resulting on similar concentrations values 

wherever are the units adopted resulting in a marginal impact on the prediction (Figure 

1A). 

The two versions of GCVOL model were also used to predict biodiesels densities. 

Results for the relative deviations are reported for all the biodiesels studied in Table 6. 

To define the ester group, parameters for both the –COO– and –CH2COO–groups were 

tested, and large deviations were reported when using the –CH2COO–group. 

Consequently, the –COO– group was adopted in this work to describe the ester group. 

The results reported suggest that, the original version of GCVOL, with overall average 

deviations of 0.60% is far superior to the Extended GCVOL version with overall 

average deviations of 2.7%. 

Results from previous works of ours13,14 and the ones shown in Figure 1B indicate 

that the GCVOL has a poor performance for unsaturated methyl esters and biodiesels 

with higher content of unsaturated esters, such as soybean biodiesel. The results suggest 

that the temperature dependency of the –CH= parameter is not correct and can be 

improved. 

New values for Ai, Bi and Ci for the double bond parameter (–CH=) were estimated 

based on the density data for fatty acid esters reported in previous works of ours13,14 and 

used to predict the densities of the biodiesels here studied. The new values for the –CH= 

parameter here proposed, reported in Table 7, reduce the overall relative deviations of 

the GCVOL predictions from 0.60% to 0.25%. Figure 1C presents the relative 

deviations obtained by the revised GCVOL model as function of the temperature and it 

is shown that the deviations are now essentially temperature independent.

where ? is the density in g/ cm3, Mw the molecular weight in g/mol, V(T) the molar

fitting parameter. Experimental high pressure densities of three methyl esters (laurate, 

myristate and oleate) reported by us elsewhere 27 were used to estimate the c parameter 

with a value of -5.7×10-4 MPa-1, describing high pressure densities of the methyl esters 

with average deviations of 0.3% as reported in Table 8. Equation 9, using this c value, 

was then used to predict high pressure densities for 7 biodiesel fuels. 27 The relative 

deviations (RDs) between experimental and predicted densities as function of pressure 

at 293.15 K are presented in Figure 3. The average relative deviations (ARD) for all 

compounds here studied are presented in Table 8. The overall average deviation 

(OAAD) of only 0.37 %, confirms that the extension to high pressures of the GCVOL 

model here proposed can provide excellent predictions of densities of different biodiesel 

fuels at high pressure.

It may be argued that the requirement of knowing the biodiesel detailed composition 

to predict biodiesel densities requires too much effort when there are plenty of density 

data in the literature for biodiesels from a large number of vegetable oils. A comparison 

between the data reported by different authors for the densities of biodiesels produced 

from soybean oil, presented in Figure 2, shows large differences that cannot be assigned 

to experimental errors but to the differences in the oil compositions. These results 

clearly support the idea that a detailed characterization of the biodiesel composition is 

required even for estimating a simple property such as density.

5. Conclusions 

 

New experimental data for the density of ten biodiesels in the temperature range 273 

to 363 K and at atmospheric pressure are reported. 

The experimental data here measured were used to test predictive models for 

biodiesels densities. Three versions of the Kay’s mixing rule and two versions of the 

GCVOL model were investigated. With exception of the Extended GCVOL model all 

approaches seem to be able to describe the biodiesels densities with deviations smaller 

than 1%. The various approaches to the Kay’s mixing rules studied produce similar 

results and the revised version of the GCVOL model here proposed predicts the 

biodiesels densities with deviations of only 0.25%. 

An extension of the GCVOL model to high pressures is here proposed based on 

correlated data for three methyl esters. It was tested in the 7 biodiesel fuels studied and 

it is shown that it can predict densities in a wide range of pressures and temperatures 

with an overall average absolute deviation (OAAD) of 0.37 %, being these deviations 

not sensible to the pressure.

Abstract 

Density is one of the most important biodiesel properties, since engine injection 

systems (pumps and injectors) must deliver an amount of fuel precisely adjusted to 

provide a proper combustion while minimizing greenhouse gases emissions. Pressure 

influence in fuel density has becoming particularly important with the increase use of 

modern common rail systems where pressure can reach 250MPa. 

Nevertheless, besides its importance, little attention has been given to biodiesels high 

pressure densities. In fact, there are almost no reports in literature about experimental 

high pressure biodiesel density data. 

To overcome this lack of information, in this work, new experimental measurements, 

from 283 to 333 K and from atmospheric pressure to 45MPa, were performed for 

methyl laurate, methyl myristate and methyl oleate and for methyl biodiesels from 

Palm, Soybean and Rapeseed oils and from three binary and one ternary mixtures of 

these oils. 

Following previous works, were the Cubic-Plus-Association equation of state (CPA 

EoS) was shown to be the most appropriate model to be applied to biodiesel production 

and purification processes, the new high pressure experimental data here reported was 

also successfully predicted with the CPA EoS, with a maximum deviation of 2.5 %. A 

discussion about the most appropriate CPA pure compound parameters for fatty acid 

methyl esters is also presented.

1. Introduction 

Biodiesel has recently been the focus of increasing attention from researchers due to 

its rising use as a new energy solution to replace petroleum based fuels. Its production 

has increased exponentially in the last decade, from worldwide negligible productions 

in 1990 its production reached over 2500 million tons in 2008. Biodiesel is the most 

used biofuel in Europe, reaching the 9.6 million tons of consumption1. 

Besides its well known environmental advantages over petroleum fuels2, biodiesel can 

be mixed in all proportions with regular diesel with no motor changes, it’s easier to 

store and transport and has a more favorable combustion profile3-4. It consists on a blend 

of fatty acid esters that are industrially produced trough the transesterification reaction 

of a vegetable oil or a fat with an alcohol, usually using a basic catalyst to increase 

reaction speed and yield3. Rapeseed, Soybean and Palm oils are the most commonly 

used oils to produce biodiesel5. 

Nowadays, most new vehicles operate with common rail diesel engines, which use 

high injection pressures to allow a rapid fuel atomization and combustion with 

consequent higher engine efficiencies and lower emissions6. Modern ultra-high-pressure 

injection systems can approach pressures of 250MPa7. 

Considering the predictable increase of biodiesel use, with Europe aiming to replace 

20% of fossil fuels for alternative renewable fuels such as biofuels until 20201, and the 

introduction of common rail engines in new vehicles, it is expected that these engines 

will work with biodiesel-fuel blends with high biodiesel content and eventually even 

with pure biodiesels. 

As Boudy and Seers8 explained, from the evaluation of the effect of different fuel 

properties on the injection process of common rail direct injection systems, density is 

the main property controlling the pressure wave in common rail systems and 

subsequently the total mass injected. NOx emissions increase from biodiesel use is 

partly related to advancing of injection timing caused by the more rapid pressure wave 

transfer from the fuel injection pump to the fuel injector causing it to open earlier.9-10 

The European Committee for Standardization (CEN) has established quality standards 

specifying minimum requirements and test methods for biodiesels, the DIN EN 

14214:201011, including density specifications. However, these standards at ambient 



 

 

108 

 

conditions can hardly be applied for common rail engines since densities suffer strong 

oscillations under high pressures. 

Knowledge and description of biodiesel densities as a function of pressure and 

temperature are therefore required for a correct biodiesel formulation and for a proper 

design and optimization of common rail engines injection systems, in order to a 

precisely adjusted amount of fuel be delivered to provide a proper combustion while 

minimizing NOx emissions7. However, in spite of its importance, little attention has 

been given to high pressure densities of biodiesels and measurements and predictions of 

that property have been restricted to ambient conditions. Only Aparicio et al.12-13 

reported density measurements, in the temperature range 288.15 to 328.15 K and 

pressure range 0.1 to 350 MPa, for the Rapeseed and Sunflower oil methyl esters. Their 

experimental results were correlated with the modified Tait-Tammann equation. 

After reporting experimental data for the atmospheric pressure temperature 

dependence of density for several fatty acid methyl and ethyl esters (from the most 

commonly found in biodiesels samples14 to the less common15), for different 

biodiesels16, and studying the best models to predict the densities of biodiesel16, we 

carried out here experimental high pressure density measurements for several of these 

pure compounds and biodiesels. 

New high pressure density data is reported in this work for three fatty acid methyl 

esters and seven biodiesels, in the temperature range 283 to 333 K and from 

atmospheric pressure to 45MPa. Experimental densities were correlated using the 

modified Tait-Tammann equation17 and thermodynamic properties such as isothermal 

compressibilities and isobaric expansion coefficients were as well calculated and 

evaluated, on the temperature and pressure ranges studied. 

Empirical models, like the modified Tait-Tammann equation, are the most commonly 

used to correlate high pressure density experimental data. In this work, a different and 

completely predictive approach was also applied, that consisted on the use of the Cubic-

Plus-Association equation of state (CPA EoS) to describe the experimental data. In 

previous works18-20, the CPA EoS was shown to be the most appropriate model to be 

applied to biodiesel production and purification processes. A discussion about the most 

appropriate CPA pure compound parameters for esters is also presented.

2. Experimental Section 

 

2.1. Materials 

Experimental densities were measured for three pure methyl esters, for methyl laurate 

and methyl myristate supplied by SAFC with purity 98% and for methyl oleate at 99% 

purity from Aldrich, and for seven different biodiesels samples. Biodiesels were 

synthesized by the transesterification reaction with methanol of the vegetal oils: 

Soybean (S), Rapeseed (R) and Palm (P) and their respective binary and ternary 

mixtures: Soybean + Rapeseed (SR), Rapeseed + Palm (RP), Soybean + Palm (SP) and 

Soybean + Rapeseed +Palm (SRP). The molar ratio of oil/methanol used was 1:5 using 

0.5% sodium hydroxide by weight of oil as a catalyst. The reaction was performed at 55 

ºC during 24 h under methanol reflux. The reaction time chosen was adopted for 

convenience and to guarantee a complete reaction conversion. Raw glycerol was 

removed in two steps, the first after 3h reaction and then after 24h reaction in a 

separating funnel. Biodiesel was purified trough washing with hot distillated water until 

a neutral pH was achieved. The biodiesel was then dried until the EN ISO 14214 limit 

for water was reached (less than 500 mg/kg of water11). 

Biodiesels were characterized by GC-FID following the British Standard EN14103 

from EN 1421411 to know their methyl esters composition. Capillary gas 

chromatography was used to determine the methyl ester composition of the biodiesel 

samples. A Varian CP-3800 with a flame ionization detector in a split injection system 

with a Select™ Biodiesel for FAME Column, (30 m x 0.32 mm x 0.25 µm), was used to 

differentiate all methyl esters in analysis inclusively the poli-unsaturated ones. The 

column temperature was set at 120ºC and then programmed to increase up to 250 ºC, at 

4 ºC/min. Detector and injector were set at 250ºC. The carrier gas was helium with a 

flow rate of 2 mL/min.

2.2. Experimental Procedure 

Experimental high pressure densities were determined using an Anton Paar 512P 

vibrating tube densimeter, connected to an Anton Paar DMA 4500 data acquisition unit. 

This device determines the vibration period of a metallic U-shape cell filled with the 

studied fluid, which is directly linked to the sample fluid density. The calibration 

procedure used in this case has been described previously in detail21-22 using water and 

vacuum as calibrating references. This method enables the highest accuracy in density 

determination over wide ranges of pressure, and even reliable density extrapolation can 

be performed. The repeatability in the density values determined from the vibration 

period measured by the DMA 4500 unit is 10-5 g cm-3. 

Temperature stability is ensured with a PolyScience 9510 circulating fluid bath, and 

the temperature value is determined with a CKT100 platinum probe placed in the 

immediacy of the density measuring cell, with an uncertainty that has been determined 

to be lower than 5•10-2 K. 

Pressure is generated and controlled using a Ruska 7610 pressure controller, whose 

pressure stability is 2•10-3 MPa. The pumping hydraulic fluid (dioctylsebacate fluid) is 

in direct contact with the fluid sample inside the 1.59•10-3 m diameter steel pressure line 

conduction, with a coil designed to keep a distance (around 1m) from the fluid contact 

interface to the measuring cell, avoiding any diffusion effect. The combinations of 

density determination repeatability, and the accuracies in temperature and pressure 

measurement, lead to an overall experimental density uncertainty value that is lower 

than 0.1 Kg m-3 for the whole pressure and temperature range studied in this work. 

 

 

3. Density models 

 

3.1. Modified Tait-Tammann equation.  

Liquid densities were correlated using the modified Tait-Tammann equation 17. Other 

thermodynamic properties were also derived from this equation, such as the isothermal 

compressibility coefficient, kT, and the isobaric expansion coefficient, ?p.

The Tait equation is an integrated form of an empirical equation representative of the

3.2. CPA Equation-of-State.  

The Cubic–Plus–Association (CPA) equation of state23-25 combines a physical 

contribution from a cubic equation of state, in this work the Soave–Redlich–Kwong 

(SRK), with an association term accounting for intermolecular hydrogen bonding and 

solvation effects26-27, originally proposed by Wertheim and used in other association 

equations of state such as SAFT28. The association term included in the CPA EoS 

allowed, in previous works from ours, to correctly describe the water solubility in fatty 

acid esters and biodiesels20, the atmospheric29 and near/supercritical30 VLE of fatty acid 

esters + alcohols systems and the LLE of multicomponent systems containing fatty acid 

esters, alcohols, glycerol and water18-19, 31, since it can explicitly take into account the 

solvation phenomena found in these systems containing non-self-associating 

compounds (esters) that can associate with self-associating compounds like water, 

alcohols and glycerol. As, in this work, we are dealing with esters mixtures and as esters 

are known to not self-associate, the association term disappears from the CPA EoS and 

it can be expressed in terms of the compressibility factor as:  

( )?

 Eq. 8 

where a is the energy parameter, b the co–volume parameter, ? is the molar density, g a 

simplified hard–sphere radial distribution function.  

The pure component energy parameter, a, is obtained from a Soave–type temperature 

dependency: 

( )[ ] 210 11)( rTcaTa ?+=
 

Eq. 9 

For mixtures, the energy and co–volume parameters are calculated employing the 

conventional van der Waals one–fluid mixing rules:

Eq. 11 

 

  



 

113 

 

 

As explained above, for non–associating components, such as esters, the association 

term disappears and CPA has only three pure component parameters in the cubic term 

(a0, c1 and b). These parameters are regressed simultaneously from vapor pressure and 

liquid density data. The objective function to be minimized is the following:

With this procedure, better density estimates are provided overcoming SRK 

deficiencies in liquid phase density estimates, while leaving the possibility for future 

modeling in associating systems. 

 

 

4. Results and Discussion 

 

Density measurements were carried at temperatures ranging from 283.15 to 333.15 K 

and pressures from 0.10 to 45.0 MPa, for methyl laurate, methyl myristate, methyl 

oleate, Rapeseed, Soybean, and Palm biodiesel, Soybean + Rapeseed biodiesel, 

Rapeseed + Palm biodiesel, Soybean + Palm biodiesel and for Soybean + Rapeseed + 

Palm biodiesel.  

Table 1 reports methyl esters compositions for the biodiesels selected for this work. 

This information is of major importance since biodiesels fatty acid esters profile 

determine their chemical and physical properties, such as densities32. In addition, in a 

previous work of ours16, we showed the importance of knowing the detailed 

composition of biodiesels to compute their densities even with simple empirical models 

based on mixing rules and group contribution schemes.

Considering high pressure experimental measurements, only Aparicio et al.12 reported 

previously data for the Rapeseed methyl ester biodiesel. In the pressure range 

considered in this work, experimental Rapeseed density values are in good agreement 

with the data reported by Aparicio and co-workers as seen in Figure 1. It should be 

recalled, however, that no detailed biodiesel composition is reported by Aparicio et al. 12 

which limits the validity of a comparison since the compositions of the two fluids are 

not the same as discussed elsewhere16. From the experimental results it is possible to 

observe, for all the pure compounds and mixtures studied, that density decreases both 

when temperature increases and pressure drops. As expected, since a similar behavior 

was previously observed for pure unsaturated fatty acid esters14, biodiesel densities also 

increase with increasing content on unsaturated FAMEs and their unsaturation level.

(Table 6). A graphical illustration is given in Figure 1 for the case of Rapeseed 

biodiesel.

From the modified Tait-Tammann equation it was also possible to compute 

isothermal compressibility coefficients, kT, and isobaric expansion coefficients, ?P. 

These properties are partial derivatives of the specific volume as a function of pressure 

or temperature, respectively. Examples of both properties in the temperature and 

pressure ranges studied are presented for Rapeseed biodiesel in Figures 2 and 3, 

respectively.

By applying the propagation law of errors at equations (5) and (7) and taking into 

account the uncertainties in the density, temperature, pressure and coefficients involved 

in equations(5) and (7), we obtained an uncertainty of the order of ± 0.05 GPa?1 for kT 

and ± 5•10?4 K?1 for ?P. 

For the compounds here investigated, fatty acid methyl esters and biodiesels, isobaric 

expansion coefficient values decrease with increasing ester chain length and pressure 

and, as previously observed14, 16, increase with increasing temperature. Expansion 

coefficients values are similar between them for the considered fatty acid methyl esters 

and biodiesels, and also similar to other values reported in literature for fatty acid esters 

and biodiesels12-16. Colza biodiesel has the highest and the lowest ?p values, at the 

lowest pressure and highest temperature and at the highest pressure and lowest 

temperature, of 0.88 and 0.67, respectively. A larger isobaric expansion coefficient 

means a larger engine power loss due to fuel heating.

Isothermal compressibility coefficients, kT, decrease when pressure increases and 

when temperature decreases. The selected fatty acid methyl esters and biodiesels present 

similar values for the isothermal compressibility coefficients, values raging from 0.67 

and 0.88 in the temperature and pressure ranges here selected. Again, similar values 

were also found in literature for the Soybean13 and Rapeseed12 biodiesels 

compressibility coefficients. 

The experimental data here reported was also used to evaluate the predictive character 

of the Cubic-Plus-Association equation of state (CPA EoS) in describing high pressure 

density data. Fatty acid esters are non–self–associating compounds and so only the three 

CPA pure compound parameters of the physical term (a0, c1 and b) are required to 

describe these compounds. CPA EoS parameters for several esters families were 

proposed in a previous work20 were it was also showed that the a0, c1 and b parameters 

follow trends with the ester carbon number. Correlations to compute these parameters 

were proposed enabling to estimate them for new compounds when pure compound 

data are scarce, as happened at the time for liquid densities of the higher carbon number 

fatty acid esters. Parameters calculated from the proposed correlations are presented, for 

all the esters found in the biodiesels studied, in Table 7.

Using our recently published density data for several fatty acid esters that can be 

found in biodiesels14-15, it was also possible in this work to estimate CPA pure 

compound parameters for all the fatty acid methyl esters found in the biodiesels 

samples, compounds ranging from 15 to 25 carbon atoms and with up to three 

unsaturated bonds (Table 4), by a simultaneous regression of pure component data. 

Critical temperatures (Tc) for these esters were determined from the group contribution 

method of Wilson and Jasperson33 that was previously assessed to be the best one to 

compute this property for methyl esters34, and vapor pressures were taken from Chickos 

et al. 35, Lipkind et al.36 and Yuan et al.37. Parameters values are presented at Table 7, 

along with liquid densities and vapor pressures deviations. An excellent description of 



 

125 

 

vapor pressures and liquid densities for all the fatty acid methyl esters is achieved with 

the CPA EoS, with global average deviations of 1.6 % and of 0.9 %, respectively. 

Having the CPA pure compound parameters for all the pure fatty acid methyl esters 

that compose the selected biodiesels, the CPA EoS was applied to predict the 

experimental high pressure density data. First, both set of parameters obtained from the 

correlations and from pure compound data regression were used to predict the pure fatty 

acid methyl ester high pressure density data. Higher deviations are obtained when using 

pure compound parameters computed from correlations, as presented at Table 8, with 

deviations below 6 %.

Experimental and modeling results are depicted in Figure 4 for methyl laurate. The 

experimental data slope and range differs from the ones provided by the CPA EoS due 

to the characteristic inability of analytic EoSs to match the shape of the density 

temperature dependence. It is also worthy to stand out that higher deviations are 

obtained with the CPA EoS in comparison with the results obtained with the modified 

Tait-Tammann equation as expected, since the EoS approach is applied in a totally 

predictive way and using a considerable inferior number of parameters.

5. Conclusions 

 

Europe aims to replace 20% of fossil fuels for alternative renewable fuels such as 

biofuels until 20201. For the introduction of common rail engines in new vehicles, the 

description of biodiesel high pressure densities is of primary importance to the fuel and 

automotive industries. New experimental high pressure density measurements were

performed for three fatty acid methyl esters and for seven biodiesels, overcoming the 

lack of available experimental data. 

The experimental data was correlated with the modified Tait-Tammann equation and 

predicted by the CPA EoS. New CPA EoS parameters were computed in this work for 

the 13 different fatty acid esters that constitute the biodiesel samples selected for this 

work, from C15 to C25 and with up to three unsaturated bonds. 

The CPA EoS can predict the high pressure density data of pure fatty acid methyl 

esters and biodiesels with a maximum deviation of 2.5 % showing to be an adequate 

model to predict properties of relevance for biodiesel fuels.

Abstract 

Viscosity is an important biodiesel parameter, subject to specifications, and with 

an impact on the fuel quality. A model that could predict the value of viscosity of a 

biodiesel based on the knowledge of its composition would be useful in the optimization 

of biodiesel production processes, and the planning of blending of raw materials and 

refined products. This work aims at evaluating the predictive capability of several 

models previously proposed in the literature for the description of the viscosities of 

biodiesels and their blend with other fuels. The models here evaluated are the Ceriani’s, 

Krisnangkura’s and Yuan’s models, along with a revised version of the Yuan’s model 

here proposed. The results for several biodiesel systems show that the revised Yuan 

model proposed provides the best description of the experimental data with an average 

deviation of 4.65 %, compared to 5.34 % for Yuan’s, 8.07 % for Ceriani’s and 7.25 % 

of Krisnangkura’s models. The same conclusions were obtained when applying these 

models to predict the viscosity of blends of biodiesel with petrodiesel.

1. Introduction 

Biodiesel refers to a fuel derived from renewable sources that consists of a mixture 

of methyl or ethyl esters of long-chain fatty acids which is obtained by 

transesterification of vegetable oils or other feedstocks largely comprised of 

triacylglycerols with a simple alcohol, such as methanol or ethanol in the presence of a 

catalyst1-2. It is nonflammable and nonexplosive, with a flash point of 423 K compared 

to 337 K for petrodiesel3. As a fuel it offers many benefits such as ready availability, 

portability, renewability, domestic origin, lower sulfur and aromatic content, 

biodegradability, better ignition quality, inherent lubricity, higher cetane number, 

positive energy balance, higher density, greater safety, nontoxic character of their 

exhaust emissions and cleaner burning4-7. 

It has expanded into the existing markets and infrastructures of gasoline and diesel 

and has undergone rapid development and acceptance as an alternative diesel fuel. Its 

worldwide production exceeded 2500 million tons in 20088. It can be blended with 

diesel fuel to be used in conventional engines9 and is able to reduce the carbon dioxide 

emissions by 78 %10. Although most commercially available biodiesel is still between 5 

and 20 % biodiesel blended with petroleum diesel due to the higher prices of feedstocks 

for biodiesel production the tendency of increasing production is expected to continue 

in the coming decades with the development and the growth of non-food feedstocks11. 

One of the major problems associated with biodiesel is that its viscosity may be 

higher than that for diesel fuel. A fuel of high viscosity tends to form larger droplets on 

injection, leading to poorer atomization during the spray and creating operation 

problems, such as increased carbon deposits12, and may enhance the polymerization 

reaction especially for oils of high degree of unsaturation13. It also leads to poor 

combustion and increased exhaust smoke and emissions, beyond the problems in cold 

weather due to the increase of viscosity with decreasing temperature. On the other hand, 

a fuel with low viscosity may not provide sufficient lubrication for the precision fit of 

fuel injection pumps, resulting in leakage or increased wear14. Thus the kinematic 

viscosity of biodiesel at 40 ºC, must be in the range of 3.5-5.0 mm2/s according to EN-

14214 specifications in Europe and of 1.9-6.0 mm2/s in accordance with American 



 

 

138 

 

Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) D-6751 specifications in the USA15 while the 

limit for diesel fuel is 2.0-4.5 mm2/s14. 

There is still a lack of viscosity data of biodiesel blends and biodiesel-diesel over the 

whole composition range at different operational conditions of pressure and 

temperature. In this regard, the use of theoretical approaches to estimate the viscosity of 

biodiesel systems is of great practical interest. 

A number of works has presented predictive models and empirical equations with 

adjustable parameters for the viscosity of fatty acid esters, of which biodiesel is 

comprised. By knowing the viscosity of fatty acid esters, it is possible to determine the 

viscosity of biodiesel using the mixture models suggested by Grunberg-Nissan or 

Hind12. Moreover there is a possibility to realize biodiesel maximum potential by 

simply changing the composition of fatty acid esters. 

This paper aims at comparing the predictive capabilities of three models developed 

respectively by Ceriani et al.16, Krisnangkura et al.13 and Yuan et al.17 for the estimation 

of the viscosity of several biodiesel and their blends with diesel fuels. A revised version 

of the Yuan model is also proposed and evaluated. 

 

2 Experimental Section 

2.1 Samples 

In this work the viscosities of seven biodiesel samples were measured. Two of 

these samples were obtained from Portuguese biodiesel producers, namely Soy A and 

GP (mix of soy and rapeseed methyl esters at 50 % w/w). B1 is methyl oleate of 

technical grade, 70 %, supplied by Sigma. 

The other four biodiesel samples: Sunflower, Soy B, Palm and Rapeseed were 

synthesized in our laboratory by a transesterification reaction of the respective vegetal 

oils. The molar ratio of oil/methanol used was 1:5 with 0.5 % sodium hydroxide by 

weight of oil as catalyst. The reaction was performed at 55 ºC during 24 h under 

methanol reflux. The reaction time chosen was adopted for convenience and to 

guarantee a complete reaction conversion. Raw glycerol was removed in two steps, the 

first after 3 h reaction and then after 24 h reaction in a separating funnel. Biodiesel was 

purified by washing with hot distillated water until a neutral pH was achieved. Then 



 

139 

 

biodiesel was dried until the EN ISO 12937 limit for water was reached (less than 500 

mg/kg of water). Some properties of produced biodiesel are presented in Table 1.

2.2 Experimental Measurements 

Measurements of viscosity were performed in the temperature range of (278.15 

to 363.15) K at atmospheric pressure using an automated SVM 3000 Anton Paar 

rotational Stabinger Viscometer. The temperature uncertainty is 0.02 K from (288.15 to 

378.15) K. The relative uncertainty of the dynamic viscosity obtained is less than 0.5 % 

for the standard fluid SHL120 (SH Calibration Service GMbH), in the range of the 

studied temperatures. This viscometer was previously tested for other compounds and 

presented a very good reproducibility18,19. 

 

3. Viscosity models  

The models here described are valid for the estimation viscosity of mixtures of 

fatty acid alkyl esters. The viscosities of biodiesel are calculated by using the equation 

of Grunberg-Nissan which is known to be the most suitable equation for computing the 

viscosity of liquid mixtures12,17. Given that biodiesel fuels are non-associated liquids, 

i.e., they have essentially dispersive interaction between the individual components, 

their dynamic viscosity can be estimated using the following equation: 

ln ?? = ? !"#"$? %&amp;amp; ?"         (1) 
where ?i is the dynamic viscosity of individual compound, ?m the dynamic viscosity of 

the mixture and xi the mole fraction. 

The ester nomenclature adopted on this work is based on the fatty acid chain length. 

A Cx:y ester means the methyl ester of fatty acid with x carbons and y unsaturation.

3.1- Ceriani’s Model  

Ceriani et al.16 proposed a model to predict the viscosity of fatty acid esters 

based on a group contribution method, i.e., a compound or a mixture of compounds is 

considered as a solution of groups and its properties are the sum of the contributions of 

each group16. The model for the pure compounds is described in Equations (2) – (4):  

%&amp;amp;'?" ()?. +? - = ? .? /??? +

1 2? ? 4?? %&amp;amp; ? 5 ?

and 

= = ? + @1/2 ? Bln '? 5- ? C ? 5??        (4) 

where Nk is the number of groups k in the molecule i; M is the component molecular 

weight that multiplies the “perturbation term”; A1k, B1k, C1k, D1k, A2k, B2k, C2k, and D2k 

are parameters obtained from the regression of the experimental data; k represents the 

groups of component i; Q is a correction term. f0, f1, s0 and s1 are optimized constants; ?, 

?, ? and ? are optimized parameters obtained by regression of databank as whole; Nc is 

the total number of carbon atoms in the molecule and Ncs is the number of carbons of 

the alcohol side chain. The parameter values can be found at Ceriani et al.16. 

 

3.2- Krisnangkura’s Model  

Krisnangkura et al.13 fitted Equation 5 to an experimental viscosity data bank and 

provided a set of parameters for the description of the viscosity of pure fatty acid methyl 

esters (FAMEs)13. 

ln'D- = ? + EF +&amp;lt;1 +
GH
1            (5) 

This equation was developed by considering the viscosity as the integral of the 

interaction forces of molecules. Based on this approach the temperature dependency of 
the viscosity for short chain methyl esters (C6-C12) can be estimated by Equation 6: 

ln'D- = ?2.915 ? 0.158F + NO?.??1 +
?;P.?QG

1       (6) 



 

141 

 

while for longer chain esters (C12:0-C18:0) the viscosity obeys the Equation 7: 

ln'D- = ?2.177 ? 0.202F + N;?.??1 +
?;O.SSG

1       (7) 

The viscosity of unsaturated FAMEs is estimated by Equations (8) - (11). 

ln'D-?P:? = ?5.03 +
?;Q?.Q

1         (8) 

ln'D-?P:? = ?4.51 +
?P??.Q

1         (9) 

ln'D-?P:? = ?4.18 +
??PQ.Q

1         (10) 

ln'D-??:? = ?5.42 +
????.?

1         (11) 

In all these equations µ is kinematic viscosity expressed in mm2/s and T is absolute 

temperature in K. 

Since Krisnangkura’s model does not provide equations for several unsaturated 

FAMEs such as C16:1, C20:0, C20:1 and C22:1, to predict the viscosity of biodiesel 

containing these compounds, it was necessary to resort to a pseudo-component 

approach where the biodiesel composition was modified by adding C16:1 to C16:0, C20:0 

and C20:1 to C18:3 and C22:0 to C22:1. 

Beyond that, given that Krisnangkura’s model provides only kinematic viscosities, 

their conversion into dynamic viscosities was done by considering the density data for 

pure FAMEs reported by Pratas et al.18,20 

 

3.3- Yuan’s Model  

Yuan et al.17 applied the Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher (VTF) equation to describe the 

viscosity-temperature relationship of pure FAME commonly present in biodiesel fuels  

ln ? ()?. +? = ? + 01/2W1X        (12) 

and then estimate the viscosity of biodiesel fuels based on their FAME composition 

through the mixture model. In Equation (12) A, B and To are parameters with values 



 

 

142 

 

were determined by fitting experimental viscosity data available and are reported by 

Yuan et al.17 

3.4- Revised Yuan’s Model  

In previous works Pratas et al.18,20 reported new and more accurate data for the 

viscosities of fatty acid methyl and ethyl esters. The revised Yuan’s model consists of a 

version of the Yuan’s model where the parameters of the VTF model were refitted to 

the new data. The new parameters for FAME are presented in Table 2.

3.5- Database of biodiesel viscosities 

Although values for the biodiesel viscosity are common in the open literature, 

information concerning the biodiesel composition that is more detailed than the 

information about the oil used for the biodiesel synthesis is scarce. To apply the models 

here studied detailed information about the biodiesel composition is required. The 

database used in this work was collected from the literature and supplemented with a 



 

143 

 

data for seven new biodiesel measured in our laboratory. The compositions in terms of 

FAMEs of all biodiesel used in this work are reported in Table 3. The biodiesels used in 

this study cover the most important oils used in biodiesel production such as soy, palm, 

canola, rapeseed and sunflower, but also other oils such as cotton seed, coconut and 

babassu, relevant due to their singular compositions. In terms of fatty acid methyl ester 

distributions it addresses both oils rich in short chain and saturated fatty acids such as 

coconut, in saturated fractions such as palm, and rich in unsaturated compounds such as 

soy and sunflower.

The database of blends analyzed in this work was collected from Knothe et al.1 and 

Yuan et al.21. The first author measured the low-temperature kinematic viscosity data of 

binary blends between methyl oleate, methyl linoleate and commercial biodiesel and 

petrodiesel in different mixing ratios while the last author reported the kinematic 

viscosity of blending of yellow grease methyl esters (YGME) and of soy methyl esters 

(SMEA and SMEB) and a genetically modified soy methyl esters (MGSME) with no. 2 

Diesel. The kinematic viscosity of the commercial petrodiesel and the no.2 Diesel are 

listed in Table 4.

The results suggest that all the models tend to underpredict the experimental 

viscosities. As one can see in Figures 1a and 1d, the predictions of Ceriani’s and 

Krisnangkura’s model are systematically larger than the Yuan type models (Figures 1b 

and 1c) and temperature dependent. Note, however, this dependency is opposite in the 

two cases: while Ceriani’s deviations tend to increase with temperature, the reverse 

effect is observed for Krisnangkura’s model, i.e., the deviations are lower at the higher 

temperatures, where the viscosities have lower values. In both cases, the deviations at 

the temperature extremes tend to be very large (up to 25 %). The temperature 

dependency of Ceriani’s model seems to be related with the poor description of the 

viscosity of unsaturated fatty acid esters as discussed in previous works.18,20 A 

reestimation of the parameters for these compounds should allow a better description of 

the experimental viscosities. The temperature dependency of the fatty acid esters is 

better described in large temperature ranges by a Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher (VTF) 

equation, as suggested by Yuan’s et al.17 than by the Arrhenius type adopted by 

Krisnangkura. The poor temperature dependency of this model is due to the equation 

used to describe temperature dependency of the viscosity of the pure components of the 

mixture. 

Figures 1b and 1c reveals that the relative deviations obtained with the two versions 

of the Yuan model are temperature independent and the maximum deviation observed 

are in general lower than 10 %. They are thus more robust and reliable, producing 

suitable average deviations in comparison with other models available in the literature. 

In numbers, both Ceriani’s and Krisnangkura’s models have global average relative 

deviations around 8 %, Yuan’s original model of 5.3 % and the revised version of 

Yuan’s model here proposed of just 4.7 % that must be close to the experimental 

uncertainty of many of the experimental data.

(for panel A only,  B10-B90 Med,  MO10-MO90 Med and  ML10-ML90 Med). 

 

The prediction of the viscosities of mixtures of biodiesel with petroleum diesel was 

also studied here by using Equation (1) where the biodiesel viscosity is estimated using 

the models here studied and the petroleum diesel viscosity used was the experimental 

value (panel A-D of Figure 2). The relative deviations were estimated using Equations 

(13) and (14) and are reported in Table 7. It was found that the deviations observed for 

the individual mixtures and the global deviations are in good agreement with those 

observed for the pure biodiesel, showing that their predictive capabilities of the 

approach here used is not affected by the presence of hydrocarbons in the mixture. 

Ceriani’s model shows an overall deviation of 6.47 %, Yuan’s and Krisnangkura’s 

models presented 5.59 % and 7.10 % respectively, while the revised Yuan’s model had 

the lowest global deviation of just 5.21 %, suggesting that the Yuan type models are 

also suitable to predict the viscosity data of biodiesel blends with petrodiesel.

5. Conclusions 

Viscosity data for seven well characterized biodiesel samples in terms of its FAME 

composition was measured and reported. Along with a database compiled from the 

literature, they were used to evaluate four models able to predict biodiesel viscosities 

based on information of their FAME compositions. It is shown that although all the 

models studied are able to predict the viscosities of both pure biodiesels and blends of 

biodiesel with petrodiesel with less than 10 % deviation in general, the models of 

Krisnangkura et al.13 and Ceriani et al.16 present deviations that are temperature 

dependent and that at the extremes of the temperature range studied can have deviations 

as high as 25 %. The deviations presented by the Yuan type models are more robust 

over temperature and also lower than those obtained with the two previous models. In 

particular the revised version of the Yuan’s model here proposed based on new and 

more accurate data for the fatty acid methyl esters produces predictions with 

uncertainties that are close to the experimental uncertainties of the experimental data 

and can thus be an interesting tool to the design of biofuels or biofuel blends with 

viscosities that comply with legal specifications.

ABSTRACT  

In spite of their interest for the understanding of the low temperature behavior of 

biodiesel, data on the phase equilibria of biodiesels at temperatures below the cloud 

point are not available in the literature. To overcome this limitation the liquid and solid 

phase compositions and fractions at temperatures below the cloud point were studied for 

three commercial diesels at temperatures ranging from 260 to 275 K.  

A thermodynamic framework able to describe these multiphase systems is presented. 

Two versions of the Predictive UNIQUAC model along with an approach assuming 

complete immiscibility of the compounds in the solid phase are evaluated with success 

against the experimental phase equilibrium data measured in this work

1. INTRODUCTION 

 

Biodiesel production and consumption has been increasing steadily in the last few 

years thanks to the environmental benefits that result from its utilization. The cost of the 

raw materials and the competition with food for oils or soils are the main limitations to 

a more widespread use of biodiesel. The use of waste oil or cheap and non-edible oils 

and fats can help minimize this problem but the formulation of a biodiesel must 

conform to a number of standards before approval for commercialization. 

The main biodiesel properties are dependent on the oils or fats used on its production. 

This biofuel is much less complex than conventional diesels. It consists on a liquid 

blend of, non toxic, biodegradable fatty acid esters, yellow coloured and immiscible 

with water. Its cold flow performance depends both on the oil and the alcohol used in 

the transesterification. A biodiesel with a large concentration of saturated fatty acid 

esters, although less vulnerable to oxidation and displaying better combustion 

properties, has a worst performance at low temperatures because of its tendency to 

crystallize1. There are a number of specifications for the biodiesel performance at low 

temperatures. The most important are the Cloud Point, CP, the Pour Point, PP, the Cold 

Filter Plugging Point, CFPP, and the Low Temperature Filterability Test, LTFT2. Dunn 

and co-workers have produced a large body of work that provides a comprehensive 

picture of the influence of the saturated fatty esters and various alcohols on the low 

temperature behaviour of biodiesel1, 3-8. What currently lacks is a good and reliable 

model that, from the knowledge of the biodiesel composition, could predict the low 

temperature behavior of the fuel8. This model would be an essential tool for a quick 

evaluation of the biodiesel characteristics, design of a biodiesel to meet the 

requirements for low temperature utilization, and design and operation of winterization 

processes for biodiesels9. 

Our previous work has addressed the low temperature behavior of conventional fuels. 

A thermodynamic model, Predictive UNIQUAC10-15, was developed and extensively 

tested in diesels16-18, jet fuels and other refined products17, 19-21and unrefined oils22-25 

with success. Lately we have been addressing the application of this model to the 

description of the cloud points of fatty acid mixtures26, and fatty acid methyl27 and ethyl 

ester28 mixtures. The Predictive UNIQUAC model was shown to be able to successfully 



 

 

166 

 

describe the cloud point of the mixtures studied but presented limited advantages 

compared to a simpler model where no solid solution formation was considered as 

discussed in a previous work28.  

The cloud point provides, however, a limited information about the low temperature 

behavior of a fuel. Both the CFPP and the LTFT are related to what happens below the 

cloud point, i.e. the composition of the material that precipitates and the amount of 

crystals formed. This last issue is particularly relevant as the gelling of the fluid and the 

plugging of filters is essentially dependent on the amount of solids crystallizing at low 

temperatures. The adequate design and operation of winterization processes to produce 

biodiesel that can conform to low temperature specifications also requires the capability 

to predict the composition of the liquid phase after partial crystallization of a biodiesel 

and the prediction of its new low temperature characteristics9, 29-31. To learn more about 

the behavior of a biodiesel below its cloud point an approach successfully used 

previously for the study of conventional diesels16, 18and other complex synthetic 

mixtures12, 32-36 was here applied to biodiesels. It consists in separating by filtration the 

liquid and solid phases at various temperatures below the cloud point and study their 

composition and relative amounts. 

In this work experimental data for the solid liquid phase equilibria of three 

commercial non-additivate biodiesels at temperatures ranging from 260 to 275 K are 

reported. A thermodynamic framework able to describe these multiphase systems is 

presented. Two versions of the Predictive UNIQUAC model along with a model 

assuming complete immiscibility of the compounds on the solid phase are evaluated 

with success against the experimental data as shown below. 

 

2. EXPERIMENTAL 

 

The three commercial biodiesels here studied, BDA, BDB and BDC, were obtained 

from Portuguese biodiesel producing companies. They were collected at the end of the 

production line before additivation and their composition was measured by gas 

chromatography on a Varian 3800CP chromatograph equipped with a split/splitless 

injector at 250ºC (split ratio of 1:20) and a FID detector at 220ºC. A DB1-HT column 

(length: 15m, internal diameter: 0.32mm and film thickness: 0.1µm) coated with a film 

of dimethylpolysiloxane, with a temperature program of 5 ºC/min from 80 ºC to 200 ºC 



 

167 

 

was used. The carrier gas was helium with a flow rate of 2mL/min. The compositions of 

the fatty acid esters present in concentrations above 0.5 wt% are reported in Table 1. 

The total concentration of other esters was less than 2 wt%.

The low temperature behavior of the biodiesels was studied using a methodology 

previously developed by us to measure solid liquid phase equilibria in hydrocarbon 

fluids12, 32 and widely used to the study of both synthetic mixtures12, 33-36 and diesels16, 

18. It consists in separating the liquid phase from the precipitate by filtration at 

controlled temperature and analyzing the phases by gas chromatography. The phase 

separation is achieved using UniPrep syringeless filters from Whatman of 5 mL 

capacity with filters of 0.2µm porosity. The biodiesel is distributed in 1 mL samples by 

the UniPrep that are introduced on a thermostatic bath where the samples are 

equilibrated for 24 hours before separation. When the separation is completed, the two 

phases recovered are analyzed using the gas chromatography analytical procedure 

described above. The liquid and solid phase composition and fractions are estimated by 

mass balances from the results of these analysis according to a procedure proposed 

previously12, 32 and detailed below. No multiple measurements were carried for each 

point so a correct value of reproducibility of the experimental data cannot be assigned. 

Based on our previous experience12, 32-36 and on the results for the points that were 

duplicated the estimated reproducibility is of 1% on the liquid phase composition, 5% 

on the solid phase composition and 5-10% on the solid fraction. 

The precipitate (P) recovered is composed by the solid phase (S) and important 

quantities of liquid (L) that remain entrapped in the crystals after the filtration. It is thus 

impossible to assess directly the composition of the solid phase after the filtration. Only 

the composition of the liquid phase (L) and the precipitate (P) can be determined 



 

 

168 

 

directly. Since the unsaturated fatty acid esters have melting points much lower than the 

corresponding saturated fatty acid esters they will not crystallize at the temperatures 

used on this study and thus the portion of liquid entrapped in the crystals of the 

precipitate can be determined from the quantity of unsaturated fatty esters present in the 

precipitate. Since the exact composition of the liquid phase is known from 

chromatography it is possible to calculate the fraction of entrapped liquid, c, as:

where W are the mass fraction of the compounds obtained from the chromatographic 

analysis and P and L stand for the precipitate and the liquid fractions. Using the value of 

this fraction c it is possible to estimate the composition of the various compounds i

The fraction of the initial biodiesel sample that crystallized, XS, can be obtained from 

a mass balance to any of the compounds present but is ideally estimated from the 

concentration of any of the unsaturated fatty acid esters on both the original biodiesel, 

BD, and the concentration in the liquid phase, L, under the conditions studied as

This experimental methodology allows an easy measurement of the composition of 

the liquid, WL, and solid phases, WS, as well as the fraction of crystallized material, XS, 

as function of the temperature.  

 

3. THERMODYNAMIC MODEL 

 

The precipitation of solids in biodiesel at low temperatures is described using an 

approach previously proposed by us for alkane mixtures 10-25 and also applied to fatty 

acids26, and fatty acids methyl and ethyl esters27, 28 with success. 

The solid-liquid equilibrium can be described by an equation relating the composition 

of component i in the solid and liquid phases with their non ideality, and the 

thermophysical properties of the pure component37

The heat capacity change upon fusion is usually regarded as being independent of the 

temperature and the bracketed term multiplied with mp,fusC? is often considered as being 

small, as the opposite signs inside the bracket lead to near cancellation38. This term was 

thus neglected on the calculations. The thermophysical properties of the crystallizing 

saturated fatty acid esters used were obtained from correlations developed in a previous 

work27 and are reported in Table 2.

Since the major compounds of a biodiesel are fatty acid esters of similar size and 

nature, the liquid phase may be treated as an ideal solution. Using Eq. (1), along with a 

multiphase flash algorithm, the composition and amount of the phases in equilibrium 

can be calculated if a model for the non-ideality of the solid phases is available. Due to 

its simplicity and robustness the algorithm of resolution of the Rachford-Rice equations 

proposed by Leivobici and Neoschil39 was used in the calculations.  

The solid phase non-ideality is described by the most recent version of the Predictive 

UNIQUAC model15. The UNIQUAC model can be written as

On this version of Predictive UNIQUAC the structural parameters, ri and qi are 

obtained from the UNIFAC parameter table40. 

The predictive local composition concept10-15 allows the estimation of the interaction 

energies, ?ij, used by these models without fitting to experimental data. The pair 

interaction energies between two identical molecules are estimated from the heat of 

sublimation of the pure component,

where Z is the coordination number with a value of 10 as in the original UNIQUAC 

model15, 41. The heats of sublimation are calculated at the melting temperature of the 

pure component as 

?subH=?vapH+?fusH                                                                                                  (8) 

The pair interaction energy between two non-identical molecules is given by  

( )ijjjjiij ???? +== 1                                                                                                  (9) 
where j is the ester with the shorter chain of the pair ij. The interaction parameter ?ij 

allows the tuning of the non ideality of the solid solution. In this work three approaches 

to the solid phase non ideality will be evaluated: assuming ?ij=0 (UNIQUAC) as was 

previously done for alkanes10-25; using ?ij=-0.05 (UNIQUAC -0.05) , a value similar to 

that used on the description of the phase diagrams of fatty acids26 and fatty acid esters27; 

and finally assuming that there is no solid solution formation and each compound 

crystallizes as a pure crystal (No solution). This last situation corresponds to an infinite 

value of the solid phase activity coefficient that within the framework of Predictive 

UNIQUAC can be achieved with a value of ?ij larger than -0.25. 

The solid-liquid equilibrium model used in this work is thus a purely predictive model 

that uses only pure component properties for the calculation of the phase equilibria. The 

three versions here evaluated will be used to predict the low temperature behavior of the 

three biodiesels studied in this work42.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

 

The experimental methodology used on this work provides direct information about 

the composition of the liquid phase. The compositions of the solid phase are estimated 

from the composition of the liquid phase and the precipitate according to Eqs. (1) and 

(2). The fraction of solids crystallizing from the biodiesel at each temperature is 

obtained from the differences between the concentrations of the unsaturated fatty acid 

esters on the original biodiesel and on the liquid phase according to Eq. (3). It follows 

that the uncertainty associated to the solid phase compositions and the solid fractions is 

consequently larger than that of the liquid phase, which is just the uncertainty associated 

to the GC analysis. The compositions of the liquid and solid phases along with the solid 

fraction formed are reported on Tables 3 to 5 at the various temperatures studied for 

each of the biodiesels used on this work. These values along with the predictions 

achieved by the three studied models are presented in Figures 1 to 9.

Since the lowest temperature studied was 260.65 K and the melting points of the 

unsaturated fatty acid esters present on the biodiesel are lower than this value it was 

admitted that these compounds did not crystallize under the conditions used in this 

work. The solid phase is thus composed solely by the saturated fatty acid methyl esters, 

methyl palmitate (C16:0) and methyl stearate (C18:0). The temperature dependency of 

the liquid phase compositions observed for all the biodiesels is similar as shown in 

Figures 1, 4 and 7. As the temperature decreases the saturated esters crystallize and then 

the liquid phase becomes depleted on the saturated esters and enriched on the 

unsaturated esters. This results on an increase of the unsaturated esters concentration at 

low temperatures while the saturated esters show the opposite behavior with a decrease 

in concentration with temperature. In what concerns the description of the liquid phase 

compositions the three models adopted have quite similar performances providing a 

description of the data that is essentially within their experimental uncertainty.  

The solid phase compositions presented in Figures 2, 5 and 8 display a richer and 

more complex behavior becoming a more stringent test to the models. Although the 

models predict a similar solid phase composition at temperatures 5 to 10 K lower than 

the cloud point, close to it they display a very different behavior. While the Predictive

UNIQUAC model with ?ij=0 (UNIQUAC) predicts that both saturated esters crystallize 

simultaneously, as expected from the formation of a solid solution, the model assuming 

that each ester crystallizes independently (No solution) starts with the crystallization of 

just one of the esters and, as the temperature decreases and the ratio between the stearate 

and palmitate esters reaches the eutectic point of the mixture, they start both to 

crystallize although as independent solid phases. This produces some interesting 

features on the phase equilibria predicted by the No solution model such as a small 

increase on the concentration of the methyl stearate on the liquid phase below the cloud 

point and down to 276 K for BDA while the methyl palmitate crystallizes alone.  

The kinks observed on the solid fraction lines predicted by this model and reported in 

Figures 3, 6 and 9 can also be assigned to the change of regimen of crystallization of a 

single ester to the simultaneous crystallization of two esters. In any case these behaviors 

would be too subtle to be observed on the experimental data to test the model validity. 

The Predictive UNIQUAC model with ?ij=-0.05 (UNIQUAC -0.05) presents an 

intermediate behavior between these two extremes. While it clearly favors the 

crystallization of one of the esters over the other at the cloud point it still predicts 

nevertheless that there is always some degree of co-crystallization. This allows the 

correct description of the decrease in methyl palmitate and increase in methyl stearate 

concentrations as the temperature decreases observed in BDA. The UNIQUAC model 

predicts the opposite behavior for all the studied biofuels, while the No solution model, 

although qualitatively correct, overestimates this composition change. This change in 

the solid phase composition is particularly visible for BDB shown in Figure 5. Because 

in BDB the methyl palmitate to methyl stearate ratio is much lower than in the two 

other fuels the crystallization will start on the opposite side of the eutectic point than the 

observed in BDA and BDC. This originates that at the cloud point it will be the methyl 

stearate, rather than the methyl palmitate that dominates in the solid phase. This peculiar 

behavior is rather clear in the experimental data with an inversion of the dominant ester 

in the solid phase as the temperature decreases.  

Although all the models can qualitatively describe the change in the dominant ester 

present in the solid phase the UNIQUAC model fails to adequately describe it while the 

two other models provide a fair description of the concentration inversion. On BDC, 

presented on Figure 8, the UNIQUAC model again fails to provide a description of the 



 

179 

 

qualitative trend observed in the solid phase compositions. The two other models show 

no differences within the experimental temperature range studied. 

The crystallization differences around the cloud point, along with the differences on 

the estimation of the cloud point itself, generate important differences on the solid 

fractions predicted by the three models studied on this work reported on Figures 3, 6 

and 9. The solid fraction, as well as the cloud point estimation, decreases with the 

increasing non ideality of the solid phase. In all cases the solid fractions predicted by 

the UNIQUAC model are larger than those estimated by the UNIQUAC -0.05 and these 

larger than those obtained from the No solution model. It is clear that the UNIQUAC 

model overestimates the solid fractions measured. Given the quality of the experimental 

data measured for the solid fractions it is not possible to clearly identify which of the 

two other models is the best since both describe the data within its experimental 

uncertainty.  

A global analysis of the data suggests that both the UNIQUAC -0.05 and the No 

solution model can provide an adequate description of the phase equilibrium data of 

biodiesels below the cloud point of the fuel. The UNIQUAC -0.05 model is probably 

superior with a better description of the cloud point and of the solid phase composition. 

A more extensive set of data and of higher quality seems to be required to reach a final 

conclusion.  

 

5. CONCLUSIONS 

 

This work reports experimental data for the solid liquid phase equilibria of three 

commercial, non-additivate, biodiesels at temperatures ranging from 260 to 275 K. A 

thermodynamic framework able to describe these multiphase systems is presented. Two 

versions of the Predictive UNIQUAC model along with a model assuming complete 

immiscibility of the compounds in the solid phase are evaluated against the 

experimental data measured. It is shown that both the Predictive UNIQUAC model with 

?ij=-0.05 (UNIQUAC -0.05) and a model assuming complete immiscibility on the solid 

phase are capable of providing an adequate representation of the phase equilibria for 

these systems below their cloud points.

Abstract 

European and American governments are targeting the incorporation of 10% and 

20%, respectively of biofuels in transportation fuels by 2020. A number of important 

properties of the biodiesel can be directly related to the chemical composition of the raw 

material. It is therefore possible to predict these properties for each biodiesel based on 

their fatty acid profile. 

The aim of this work is to study the biodiesel properties dependence with 

composition. To have a database to perform this study we synthesized methyl esters of 

rapeseed, soybean and palm as also their binary mixtures and ternary mixture, and also 

sunflower biodiesel. The properties evaluated were density, viscosity, iodine index, and 

CFPP. The objective of this study is to evaluate the properties of biodiesel oils obtained 

from different feedstock (soybean, rapeseed, palm, sunflower) and also their mixtures.

INTRODUCTION 

 

The fossil fuel resources are dwindling day by day. Oil is becoming increasingly 

scarce and soon will not be able to meet the numerous demands, arising mainly from the 

transport sector. Faced with the energy crisis and environmental degradation, due to the 

massive use of fossil energy sources, biodiesel became an attractive alternative to diesel 

fuel. Biodiesel can reduce the environmental impacts of transportation, reduce the 

dependence on crude oil imports and thus on related political and economic factors, they 

offer business possibilities to agricultural enterprises.1 

A substitute diesel fuel derived from vegetable oils or animal fats, biodiesel is a 

mixture of saturated and unsaturated long-chain fatty acid alkyl esters. It is the final 

product of a transesterification reaction of vegetal oil, with a short alcohol in a presence 

of a catalyst. Industrially the most used process is the alkaline-catalyzed reaction. 

The biodiesel fuel has to fulfill a number of quality standards. In Europe the biodiesel 

fuel standards are compiled in the norm CEN EN 142142, and in USA in the norm 

ASTM D67513. The norms specify the requirements and test methods for biodiesel fuel 

to be used in diesel engines, in order to increase the biodiesel fuel quality and its 

acceptance among consumers. According to the European legislation, there are 25 

parameters that have to be analyzed to certify biodiesel quality. Most of these analytical 

parameters provide indications of the quality of the production process. Some others 

reflect the properties of the raw materials that are used to produce the biodiesel. The 

transesterification does not alter the fatty acid composition of the feedstock and this 

composition plays an important role in some critical parameters of the biodiesel.4 

Properties such as density, viscosity, low temperature performance, flash point, cetane 

number, iodine index, or oxidative stability depend on the fatty acid esters profile. 

The biodiesel has a poor cold-temperature performance and a low oxidative stability, 

increased NO, and exhausts emissions. Solutions to one of these problems often entail 

increasing the problematic behavior of another property and require the use of additives 

or modifying the fatty acid composition, either through physical processes, such as 

winterization, or through changes in the raw materials.5 6 In this regard, the generation 

of transgenic soybean lines with high oleic acid content represents one way in which 

plant biotechnology has already contributed to the improvement of biodiesel.6 Viable

strategies for increasing oil production in seeds have also been demonstrated, although 

additional work is necessary to translate these to yield increases in the field. In addition, 

research at an early stage has also suggested ways of producing oil in vegetative tissue 

rather than in seeds. Combining these approaches to develop high-yielding energy crops 

will increase the production of plant oils suitable for biodiesel.6  

In order to test several fatty acid ester profile different biodiesels were synthesis and 

evaluated in this work. Fatty acid methyl esters of soybean, rapeseed, palm oils and 

their mixtures (binary and ternary) and also, sunflower were synthesized. The quality of 

biodiesel was tested for some parameters according to the European Standard EN 

14214:20032. 

A special importance is here given to critical properties that depend on fatty acid 

profile of raw material as density, viscosity, iodine value, and cold filter plugging point 

(CFPP).

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

 

Materials. The eight biodiesel samples studied in this work were synthesized at our 

laboratory by a transesterification reaction of the vegetal oils: Soybean (S), Rapeseed 

(R), and Palm (P), and their respective binary and ternary mixtures: Soybean+Rapeseed 

(SR), Rapeseed+Palm (RP), Soybean+Palm (SP), and Soybean+Rapeseed +Palm (SRP) 

and Sunflower (Sf). Methanol (99.9% m/m) was purchased from Lab-scan, and all other 

chemicals used were obtained commercially and were of analytical grade. 

 

Transesterification process 

The transesterification reaction for all biodiesel samples was performed under specific 

conditions: the molar ratio of oil/methanol used was 1:5 with 0.5% sodium hydroxide 

by weight of oil as catalyst. The reaction was performed at 55 ºC during 24 h under 

methanol reflux. The reaction time chosen was adopted for convenience and to 

guarantee a complete reaction conversion of one liter of oil. Raw glycerol was removed 

in two steps, the first after 3 h reaction and then after 24 h reaction in a separating 

funnel. Biodiesel was purified by washing with hot distilled water until a neutral pH 

was achieved. The biodiesel was then dried until the EN ISO 12937 limit for water was 

reached (less than 500 ppm of water). The water content was checked by Karl- Fischer 

titration. 

There are a lot of publications that report biodiesel productions in shorter times (3-4 

hours of synthesis). But in these conditions biodiesels did not possess a good quality 

level, as the yield was less than 90%. The presence of intermediate species in biodiesel 

influences dramatically their thermodynamic properties. Conditions to produce 

biodiesel were optimized until conversion reaction obtained has yields of more than 

96.5% (EN14103). Therefore the reaction time was increased to a limit value (24h) to 

guarantee a complete conversion at the reaction. 

In fact many author produce and test biodiesel considering the optimization 

procedures developed by other works, as a generic recipe.7 This could be acceptable 

where the target is to produce biodiesel from different raw materials, but yield needs to 

be always evaluated as esters content, in order to produce reliable data for scientific 

community. 



 

 

194 

 

After production the biodiesel fuels were stored under a nitrogen inert atmosphere 

until analysis of biodiesel quality. 

 

Biodiesel Characterization. 

Biodiesel was characterized following the EN14214:2003 and the results are 

presented in Tables 1. Detailed description of biodiesel composition is reported in Table 

2, showing qualitative and quantitative information. Figure 1 presents the quantity of 

saturated and unsaturated components of each biodiesel. 

 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

 

As presented in Table 1 and Figure 1 all biodiesel have different fatty acids profile. 

Palm oil has the higher quantity of saturated long chain such as palmitic (C16:0) and 

stearic (C18:0) acid. It has three times more saturated compounds then other raw 

materials studied. In the other hand soybean, rapeseed and sunflower oils are rich in 

esters of unsaturated fatty acids, namelly oleate (C18:1), linoleate (C18:2) and 

linolenate (C18:3) acid. However they differ in the relative percentages. Sunflower and 

soybean present a similar fatty acid profile but in the first linolenate acid (C18:3) 

doesn’t appear. Rapeseed oil has the higher percentage of monounsaturated compounds, 

especially oleate acid (C18:1). 

With such unique profiles of fatty acid esters the various biodiesel fuels, as reported 

in Table1 and presented in Figure 1, are expected to present different properties.

The best way to evaluate properties is compared them involving the standards limits 

present in the European norms. American norm has opened standard limitation for 

almost properties. The studied properties are density, viscosity, iodine value, and CFPP. 

Atomization and vaporization of fuel in engines are greatly influenced by the 

viscosity and density of the fuel and these properties are temperature and pressure 

dependents. The viscosity is defined as the resistance offered by one portion of a 

material moving over another portion of the same material.8 The viscosity is required 

for the design of pipes, fittings and equipment to be used in industry of oil and fuel9. A 

viscous fuel, causing a poorer atomization, which is the first step of combustion, is 

responsible for premature injector cooking and poor fuel combustion.10 11 The biodiesel 

standard EN 14214 sets the viscosity at 40°C measured with viscometer Stabinger in a 

range of 3.5 – 5 mm2/s. American limits lies in the range 1.9 - 6 mm2/s. It was shown12-

13 that viscosity decreases with decreasing of the length chain and with the alcohol 

length, and with increasing of unsaturation level. 

Figure 2 presents results of kinematic viscosity of all biodiesel samples at 40 ºC. In a 

general way it’s seen that biodiesel with great content of saturated compounds, as palm, 

presents higher viscosity, and soybean with more than 80% of unsaturated compounds 

presents the lower viscosity. The viscosity has almost no correlation with percentage of 

total saturated or total unsaturated compounds (0.50), but presents a high correlation 

coefficient of 0.94 with the percentage of polyunsaturated esters.

CONCLUSIONS 

 

New experimental data are presented for several biodiesel fuels produced in our 

laboratory with methyl esters profile information available. It was possible to evaluate 

the influence of unsaturation level in the properties measured and also correlate them.  

Studied properties were density, viscosity, iodine value, and CFPP (and CP). All 

properties related with original raw material composition. No correlation between the 

density and viscosity was observed, as in another investigation on biodiesel8 but all 

biodiesel compliances the European and American Standard for density and viscosity 

properties. 

Biodiesels made from feedstock containing higher concentrations of high-melting 

point saturated long-chain fatty acids tends to have poor cold flow properties. It was 

observed that the biodiesel from palm oil presents problems for cold flow properties 

with specification outside the European limits. Blends of it with other biodiesel fuels 

can improve these properties in order to comply with European specifications. 

The ideal biodiesel fuel profile presents a limited quantity of saturated esters for 

improving his cold behavior. Likewise a small quantity of polyunsaturated esters will 

reduce iodine value and increase stability.

This work takes a look at the mutual solubilities of water and fatty acids, and 

solubilities of water in biodiesel. Both are important to industrial biodiesel production 

and their scarcity on open literature motivated this study. I have made all experimental 

part, namely measurements on equilibrium phases: water solubility determined by Karl 

Fisher and solubility in water by turbidimetry in close glass ampoules. The biodiesel 

used was identified in Biodiesel Synthesis and characterized as described in Biodiesel 

Characterization.

Abstract 

Data for the mutual solubilities of fatty acid + water mixtures are scarce and so 

measurements for seven fatty acid (C5-C10, C12) + water systems were carried out. This 

new experimental data was successfully modelled with the CPA EoS. Using data from 

C6 to C10 and the Elliot’s cross-associating combining rule a correlation for the kij binary 

interaction parameter, as a function of the acid chain length, is proposed. The mutual 

solubilities of water and fatty acids can be adequately described with average deviations 

inferior to 6 % for the water rich phase and 30 % for the acid rich phase. Furthermore, 

satisfactory predictions of solid-liquid equilibria of seven fatty acids (C12-C18) + water 

systems were achieved based only on the kij correlation obtained from LLE data.

Introduction 

Fatty acids are important commodities with an increasing wide range of industrial 

applications1. Widespread use can be found in different products, such as: household 

and industrial cleaners, coatings and adhesives, paints, personal care products, 

pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, industrial lubricants, corrosion inhibitors, polymers, 

textiles, foods, paper, crayons, candles and waxes. Particular applications of some 

specific fatty acids can be found elsewhere1. Fatty acids can also be used as raw 

materials for fatty alcohols and biodiesel production1, 2. 

Although the chain length limits used to define fatty acids are not strict, these are 

typically higher chain length aliphatic carboxylic acids with 6-24 carbon atoms. 

According to literature, the worldwide production capacity for fatty acids in 2001 was 

around 4 x 106 metric tons1.  

Although shorter chain length carboxylic acids are usually produced synthetically, 

most of the fatty acids are obtained from natural oils and fats by hydrolysis (chemical or 

enzymatic). Hydrolysis converts the oil or fat (a triglyceride) into three fatty acid 

molecules and glycerol, usually at high temperature and high pressure conditions, using 

about 30-60 % water in a fatty acid weight basis. In some cases, acid washing is 

performed before the hydrolysis reaction in order to remove impurities. Following 

hydrolysis, different purification processes can be employed, among them 

crystallization (typically with methanol or acetone), solvent extraction (either liquid-

liquid or supercritical fluid extraction) distillation and adsorption. Distillation removes 

colour and odour bodies3, low boiling unsaponifiable materials, polymerized materials, 

triglycerides and heavy decomposition products. Other separation processes include 

hydrophilization, panning and pressing and formation of solid urea complexes1. 

Although fatty acids may be used for biodiesel production, transesterification is the 

most frequently used4 method for producing biodiesel from vegetable oils, tallow or 

waste cooking oils5. It consists on the reaction of an oil or fat with an alcohol to form 

fatty esters with glycerol as a byproduct. A catalyst is necessary to increase reactions 

rate and yield and basic catalysts are preferred due to higher reaction rates and lower 

process temperatures6. Methanol and ethanol can be used as alcohols in the reaction, but 



 

 

214 

 

methanol is preferred due to its low cost and physical and chemical advantages in the 

process4, 7. 

In the biodiesel production process the fatty esters rich current coming from the 

reactor is saturated with glycerol, alcohol, catalyst and unreacted soaps. This current is 

washed in a liquid-liquid extractor in counter current with acidified water to neutralize 

the catalyst and to convert soaps to free fatty acids. The raffinate current is composed of 

water saturated biodiesel while the extract is a low pH aqueous solution containing the 

polar compounds8. The design and optimization of the purification of biodiesel with 

water requires a model that can describe this phase equilibria.  

In spite of the importance of the phase equilibria of fatty acid + water systems, there 

is a lack of experimental data for their mutual solubilities. To overcome this limitation, 

measurements were carried out for the water solubility in six fatty acids and the 

complete phase diagrams were established for pentanoic, hexanoic and dodecanoic 

acids. 

Several models have been previously applied to systems containing fatty acids with 

different degrees of success. Carboxylic acids can form dimers in the vapour phase as 

well as dimers, trimers or even oligomers in the liquid phase, which make acid mixtures 

highly non-ideal, requiring a model able to take into account these interactions, in order 

to correctly describe their phase equilibria. 

One of those approaches is the UNIFAC model. Yet, this model does not perform 

well when dealing with polar compounds with association, such as the water + acid 

systems9-12, because it does not take explicitly into account the association interactions 

present in these systems. Moreover it does not take into account the dimerization in the 

vapour phase. Improvements with respect to the original UNIFAC model were achieved 

by the addition of an association term so as to take into account the association effects. 

The A-UNIFAC model was satisfactorily applied to predict vapor–liquid and liquid–

liquid equilibria and to compute infinite dilution activity coefficients for mixtures 

containing alcohols, carboxylic acids, water, esters, aromatic hydrocarbons and 

alkanes13. Applying the A-UNIFAC model to associating systems is quite demanding 

since it is necessary to analyze every UNIFAC functional group in order to recognize 

the presence of associating sites. 

Another thermodynamic model proposed for acid systems is the group contribution 

equation of state, GC-EoS developed by Skjold-Jørgensen14 that was extended by Gros 



 

215 

 

et al.15 to mixtures of fatty oils and their derivatives (fatty acids, fatty acid esters, mono- 

and di-glycerides) with supercritical solvents like carbon dioxide or propane. The 

association model proposed by Gros et al. provided results in better agreement with the 

experimental data than the GC-EoS. 

The coupling of a cubic equation of state (SRK) with a model that expresses the 

dimerization of the acid molecules was also used to correlate experimental VLE for 

gases in acetic acid16, 17. 

The Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (SAFT) model was used to compute phase 

equilibria of formic, acetic and propanoic acid binary systems with aromatic 

hydrocarbons18. The same approach was followed by Fu and Sandler19 and its results 

compared to those of the simplified SAFT EoS. These two models were also used, in 

the same work, to correlate cross-associating systems containing acids, alcohols and 

water. The original SAFT model performed better than the simplified one, but none of 

them was able to produce a good description of aqueous systems. 

The Cubic plus Association (CPA) EoS was used to correlate VLE and LLE for short 

chain acids + aliphatic hydrocarbons, in agreement with the experimental data20. The 

extension of the application of this model to binary aqueous mixtures was only made up 

to acetic acid systems, with satisfactory results21.  

As a result of our ongoing effort to develop an equation of state model for the 

description of the phase equilibria, relevant for the biodiesel production, in a previous 

work, the CPA EoS was shown to be an accurate model to describe the water solubility 

in fatty acid esters and commercial biodiesels22.  

In this subsequent study, which scope is also of interest for the biodiesel industry, the 

CPA EoS is applied for the first time to carboxylic acids heavier than propanoic acid 

(up to C20 for pure component properties and up to C18 for mixtures), and to the 

description of LLE and SLE of their binary mixtures with water.  

In the mentioned preceding paper, the CPA EoS was applied to mixtures of fatty acid 

esters (non-self-associating compounds) and water, while in this paper mixtures of acids 

(self-associating compounds) and water are studied. Systems with carboxylic acids are 

usually strongly non-ideal and considerably more difficult to model than ester mixtures. 

Two different associating combining rules are here evaluated on the basis of their 

ability to correlate these water + fatty acid systems. 



 

 

216 

 

It will be shown that short chain and long chain carboxylic acids have different 

behaviour requiring different cross-associating combining rules and that the dissociation 

of the acids smaller than pentanoic acid will have a major impact on their mutual 

solubilities with water. To correlate the mutual solubilities of water and carboxylic acids 

studied in this work, only binary interaction parameters (kij) in the physical part of CPA 

were used, and these were found to be linearly dependent on the acid chain length.  

Using this dependency for the interaction parameters, SLE predictions for seven fatty 

acids in water will also be presented in this work.  

 

Experimental Section 

 

Water solubility measurements were carried in: pentanoic acid (SIGMA, ? 99 %), 

hexanoic acid (SIGMA, ? 99.5 %), heptanoic acid (FLUKA, ? 99 %), octanoic acid 

(SIGMA, ? 99 %), nonanoic acid (SIGMA, ? 99.5 %) and decanoic acid (SIGMA, ? 98 

%), at temperatures from 288.15 to 323.15 K and at atmospheric pressure. The 

methodology used in this work, has previously been successfully used for other organic 

compounds at our laboratory22-25. The acid and the water phases were initially agitated 

vigorously and allowed to reach equilibrium by separation of both phases in 20 mL 

glass vials for at least 48 h. This period proved to be the time required to guarantee a 

complete separation of the two phases and that no further variations in mole fraction 

solubilities occurred. 

The temperature was maintained by keeping the glass vials containing the phases in 

equilibrium inside an aluminium block specially designed for this purpose, which is 

placed in an isolated air bath capable of maintaining the temperature within (± 0.01 K). 

The temperature control was achieved with a PID temperature controller driven by a 

calibrated Pt100 (class 1/10) temperature sensor inserted in the aluminium block. In 

order to reach temperatures below room temperature, a Julabo circulator, model F25-

HD, was coupled to the overall oven system allowing the passage of a thermostatized 

fluid flux around the aluminium block. The solubility of water in the acid rich phase 

was determined using a Metrohm 831 Karl Fischer (KF) coulometer. 



 

217 

 

The acid rich phase was sampled at each temperature from the equilibrium vials using 

glass syringes kept dry and at the same temperature of the measurements. Samples of 

0.1 to 0.2 g were injected directly into the KF coulometric titrator. 

For pentanoic, hexanoic and dodecanoic (SIGMA, ? 99 %) acids, measurements of 

the phase envelope for the two phase region were made by turbidimetry. Several 

samples covering the entire concentration range were prepared. The mixture was heated 

inside a closed glass tube in a thermostatic bath up to the one phase region. On slowly 

cooling, the phase separation temperature was registered. The temperature assigned to 

the phase envelope is an average of five measurements. 

For heavier acids, melting temperatures are significantly higher, what therefore 

prevents the measurements of solubilities in a temperature range adequate to the 

experimental techniques used in this work. 

 

Model 

The CPA equation of state can be described as the sum of two contributions: one 

accounting for physical interactions, that in the current work is taken as the SRK EoS, 

and another accounting for association, the Wertheim association term26, 27.

For non-associating components, such as n-alkanes, CPA has three pure component 

parameters (a0, c1 and b) while for associating components like organic acids it has five 

(a0, c1, b, ?, ?). In both cases, these parameters are regressed simultaneously from pure 

component experimental data. The objective function used is:

For a binary mixture composed by a self-associating and a non-associating 

compound, as for example water + n-alkane systems, the binary interaction parameter kij 

is the only adjustable parameter. 

For cross-associating systems, combining rules for the cross-association energy, ?ij,, 

and cross-association volume, ?ij (or the cross-association strength, ?AiBj) are required. 

Different sets of combining rules have been proposed by several authors19, 28-30:

CR-2 and CR-4 are the most commonly used. Only these combining rules have been 

found to be successful in previous applications27, 31. CR-2 provided very good results in 

the modelling of the VLE of glycol + water systems31, the LLE and VLE of water + 

heavy alcohol systems30 and the LLE of the water + amine systems32; on the other hand, 

the CR-4 approach performed better in predicting the VLE and SLE of water + small 

alcohols systems30, the VLE of small acids + water or small acids + alcohol systems20, 

the VLE of amine + alcohol32 systems and the SLE of the MEG + water systems33. In 

this work, the CR-2 and the CR-4 were evaluated on the basis of their ability to describe 

LLE and SLE of water and fatty acids binary mixtures.

where single phase or both phase data can be selected for the parameter optimization. 

The association term depends on the number and type of association sites. For water a 

four-site (4C) association scheme was adopted34, and for acids the carboxylic group is 

treated as a single association site (1A). 

Carboxylic acids can form dimers in the vapor phase as well as dimers, trimers or 

even oligomers in the liquid phase. Several previous works with the CPA EoS or with 

some variants of the SAFT EoS had already discussed the best association scheme for 

organic acids16-20. Several association schemes were evaluated for both the gas and 

liquid phases (1A, 2B and 4C). It was showed that when using the CPA EoS, the 1A 

scheme performs globally better than the two-site (2B) model (VLE, LLE, second virial 

coefficients and equilibrium constants20). Huang and Radosz using SAFT18 also used 

the one site model for carboxylic acids such as formic, acetic and n-propanoic. The 

same associating scheme for carboxylic acids (1A) can also be found in the paper of Fu 

and Sandler19. Therefore this association scheme was adopted in this work.

The results show that the water solubilities increase with temperature and decrease 

with chain length. The differences in water solubility between consecutive chain length 

acids also tend to become smaller as the chain length increases. 

Data concerning the water solubility in fatty acids are scarce but can still be found for 

the smaller pentanoic and hexanoic acids in the temperature range 293.15-343.15 K35. 

The data measured in this work are in good agreement with the few and old available 

literature data, as seen in Figure 1, showing the ability of the experimental methodology 

used for measuring the water solubility in heavier acids.  

The two experimental techniques used in this work provided very similar results for the 

water solubility.

Correlation of the CPA pure compound parameters 

The organic acids studied in this work are all self-associating and so the five CPA 

parameters must be estimated for each compound. This was done by a simultaneous 

regression of vapour pressure and saturated liquid density data, collected from the 

DIPPR database36, covering the range of reduced temperatures from 0.45-0.85, for 

linear saturated carboxylic acids from 1 up to 20 carbons atoms and the unsaturated 

oleic acid, an important natural product with 18 carbon atoms and a double bound at 

carbon 9, usually referred as 18:1. The reasonability of the application of DIPPR 

correlations in a broad temperature range is questionable when actual experimental data 

is missing, and extrapolation was required in some cases, as can be seen in Table 3, 

where the reduced temperature ranges for which experimental data for vapor pressures 

and liquid densities are available from DIPPR are presented for the organic acids 

studied. The results reported in Table 4, show that it is possible with CPA to achieve an 

excellent description of the experimental (correlated) vapour pressure and liquid 

densities for all the studied acids, with global average deviations of about 2 % for both 

properties.

Once again, as was observed previously for several families of other compounds (n-

alkanes, n-alcohols, n-FCs and esters)22, 37, the CPA pure component parameters for the 

acid series also seem to follow a smooth trend with the carbon number.  

 

Having estimated the pure component parameters it was possible to model binary 

mixtures of water with several acids (pentanoic acid, hexanoic acid, heptanoic acid, 

octanoic acid, nonanoic acid and decanoic acid). Although the solubility of these acids 

in water was available in the literature38 between 298.15 – 373.15 K, little information 

was found for the water solubility on the acids35 prompting the measurement of these 

data in this work.  

 

Correlation of the mutual solubilities 

To obtain a good description of the mutual solubilities of water and fatty acids the 

fitting of the binary interaction parameter kij of Eq. 7 is required. Data from both the 

organic and aqueous phases were used for the binary interaction parameter optimization. 

Values for the binary interaction parameters obtained using both combining rules under 

study are presented at Table 5.

In order to improve the predictive character of the CPA EoS, linear correlations for 

the kij values with the carbon number were previously proposed for alkanes + water
39 

and ester + water22 mixtures. For the heavier acids the trends of the kij values with the 

carbon number are also close to a linear tendency, as seen in Figure 2. The kij values for 

the smaller acids are somewhat off the linear tendency, particularly for pentanoic acid. 

Nevertheless, in order to increase the predictive character of the model, linear 

correlations of the kij with the chain length of the acid, Cn, for the two combining rules 

evaluated, were proposed, and described by equations (14) and (15) for CR-2 and CR-4, 

respectively, in order to allow the applicability of the model for heavier acids when 

equilibria data are not available. The extrapolation of the linear correlation will further 

be shown to be successful for the description of fatty acids + water systems from C12 to 

C18.

Results on the water rich phase are more dependent on the binary interaction 

parameter than the acid rich phase. Small variations in the kij’s values result in 

significant deviations in the description of the water rich phase with almost no impact in 

the acid rich phase. In fact, and for both association combining rules, the values for the 

kij’s optimized using both phases follow the same dependency as the kij’s evaluated 

solely from the water rich phase. The results obtained indicate that it is possible to 

predict the behaviour of the acid rich phase from the binary interaction parameters 

optimized using only data from the water rich phase. 

The estimated kij’s are small, indicating that the CPA EoS is able to take adequately 

into account the cross-association interactions that occur in water + fatty acid systems, 

with any of the combining rules studied. 

As shown in Figure 2, for the pentanoic acid + water system, the kij value was 

considerably off the linear tendency observed for the other compounds, indicating that 

different interactions may be present on this system. This deviation of the pentanoic 

acid from the behaviour of the other acids may be due to a higher degree of dissociation 

of the pentanoic acid in water, that the CPA EoS does not take into account. This may 

also be related to the unexpected behaviour of butanoic acid. From the analysis of the 

mutual solubilities of the higher acids, the phase envelopes of pentanoic and hexanoic 

acids, and the CPA predictions using the kij correlations, it would be expected that 

butanoic acid would only be partially miscible with water at room temperature. Yet, full 

miscibility of butanoic acid and water is observed under these conditions. The enhanced 

solubility of the lower acids in water results from new favourable interactions between 

the two compounds, not fully represented by the approached used in this work. 

 

Evaluation of the Combining rule 

The two combining rules studied produce very different descriptions of the acid rich 

phase but have no impact on the water rich phase, showing very similar global average 

deviations. 

 

As shown in Table 5 the CR-2 combining rule produces better results for smaller 

acids up to C7. An increase in global average deviations with the chain length of the 

acid is observed for the heavier compounds of the homologous series. 



 

229 

 

The opposite behaviour was observed for the CR-4 rule, producing very good results 

for the heavier acids. The CR-4 combining rule performs globally better than the CR-2 

with the advantage of increasing the calculation speed. With this combining rule, the 

water solubility in acids is described with a global average deviation below 30 %. The 

acid solubility in water is estimated with a global average deviation below 6 %, as 

reported in Table 5. Phase equilibria results for water + fatty acid systems are depicted 

in Figures 3 and 4.

water + octanoic acid (?, aqueous phase; ?, acid phase), and for water + octanoic acid 

(•, aqueous phase; ?, acid phase) and CPA results using two different combining rules 

(?, CR-2; …., CR-4 ). 

 

The results clearly indicate that the CPA-EoS provides a good description of the 

phase equilibria for water-fatty acid binary systems. The proposed model and the linear 

correlation for the binary interaction parameters can be used as a predictive tool to the 

description of systems of interest in industrial processes were organic and aqueous 

phases are present. For instance, for the oleic acid + water system, for which LLE data 

at higher temperatures and pressures were available in the literature40. The CR-4 

combining rule and the kij predicted through the linear correlation were used. As seen in 

Figure 3 very good results were obtained for the water solubility with a global average 

deviation inferior to 6 %. The same prediction was made for the dodecanoic acid + 

water system with global average deviations inferior to 22 % for the water solubility.

Prediction of the solubility of solid fatty acids in water 

Saturated fatty acids above decanoic acid are solid at room temperature and their 

solubilities in water are solid – liquid equilibria. 

The CPA EoS has been previously applied to the description of the SLE of alcohol – 

alkanes, glycol – water and alcohol – water26 mixtures, but never to the SLE of fatty 

acids and water systems. The purpose here is to investigate the predictive performance 

of the CPA EoS with the interaction parameter correlations obtained from LLE data and 

for each combining rule selected. 

Equations to describe the SLE for binary systems are well established in the 

literature41.  

Considering the formation of a pure solid phase and neglecting the effect of pressure, 

the solubility of a solute s can be calculated from the following generalized expression 

that relates the reference state fugacities:

where Hfus?  is the enthalpy of fusion, T is the absolute temperature, Tm is the melting

the gas constant. 

The heat capacity contribution can be neglected with respect to the enthalpic term, as 

already observed for fatty acid systems in the work from Costa et al42 where the high 

pressure solid-liquid equilibria of fatty acids was studied. Complete immiscibility in the 

solid phase and absence of a solid–complex phase were also assumed. 

The following expression for the solubility is considered,

Few experimental SLE data are available in the literature and only for 7 fatty acids 

(from C12 to C18)
38, 40. 

The values for the thermophysical properties needed to perform SLE calculations, 

melting temperature (Tm) and heat of fusion ( Hfus? ), found in literature for the pure 

compounds (from C12 to C18)
36 are presented at Table 6.  

These properties increase with the organic acid carbon number and a parity effect can 

be observed due to differences in the molecular packing of these compounds in the solid 

state.  

The CR-2 combining rule performed better than CR-4 with global average deviations 

of 51 % and 63 %, respectively, as seen in Table 6 and Figure 5.

Part of these deviations may be attributed to the low accuracy of the experimental 

data available. However, very satisfactory SLE predictions were achieved with the 

proposed model and using a single interaction parameter correlated from LLE data.

Conclusions 

Water solubilities in six fatty acids and LLE phase envelopes for three fatty acid + 

water systems were determined, using respectively Karl-Fisher coulometry and 

turbidimetry. The measured data are in good agreement with previously available 

measurements. 

The CPA EoS was here extended to long chain carboxylic acids and their binary 

aqueous mixtures. Two different combining rules were tested. 

A single, small, temperature independent and chain length dependent binary 

interaction parameter was enough to describe the mutual solubilities. A correlation for 

the binary interaction parameters was proposed. 

For small acids, from C5 to C7, the CR-2 combining rule produced somewhat better 

results for the mutual solubilities, while the Elliot combining rule (CR-4) performed 



 

 

234 

 

better for the heavier fatty acids up to C10. Using the CPA EoS and the CR-4 combining 

rule, global average deviations lower than 30 % were obtained for the water solubility 

and than 6% for the acid solubility.  

The kij correlation was successfully extrapolated to model the LLE of the oleic acid + 

water and dodecanoic + water systems and to predict, SLE of binary aqueous mixtures 

with fatty acids from C12 to C18, supporting the use of a linear correlation with the acid 

carbon number for the binary interaction parameters. 

The good results obtained for the different types of equilibria of water + fatty acid 

mixtures and for the mutual solubilities of water + ester binary systems encourage the 

application of the CPA EoS for the design of extraction units for fatty acid and biodiesel 

production.

Abstract 

 

In a previous work we addressed the importance of knowing and describing the 

water solubility in biodiesels, for producing high quality biodiesel using the most 

suitable feedstock and operating the processing plants at the optimal conditions. The 

lack of information on the water solubility in methyl linoleate limited the quality of the 

results then reported. To overcome the identified limitations new water solubility 

measurements were carried out for methyl linoleate and four methylic biodiesels 

synthetized at our laboratory from the main oil feedstock currently used for biodiesel 

production (soybean, palm, rapeseed and sunflower oils).  

The new experimental data presented here for the water solubility in methyl 

linoleate allowed to obtain the information about the binary system water/methyl 

linoleate (specifically the binary interaction parameter, kij) to be used in the modelling 

of multicomponent systems (biodiesels) with the CPA EoS. With this new interaction 

parameter the new experimental water solubilities reported in this work for four

1. Introduction 

 

The large number of recent research works addressing the production, 

characterization and use of biodiesel clearly demonstrate the increasing worldwide 

importance of this biofuel. Offering the various advantages known to characterize 

biofuels, sustainability, reduction of greenhouse gases emissions, regional development 

and secure supply  [1], biodiesel is actually the most promising alternative for 

petroleum based fuels for compressed ignition (diesel) engines. Due to its similarity in 

chemical structure and energy content with conventional diesel, it can be used in 

existing engines as pure or blended with regular diesel [2]. In fact, biodiesel, a blend of 

fatty acid alkyl esters, along with bioethanol, already represents 1.6% of the transport 

fuel used worldwide [3]. 

Although most research activities have been addressing different methods to 

produce biodiesel, involving new feedstock (such as cooking waste oil and microalgae 

oils  [4]), novel catalysts (heterogeneous catalyst and enzymes)  [4] and process 

conditions (supercritical [4]), the actual industrial way to produce biodiesel consists on 

the transesterification reaction of a vegetable oil with an alcohol (usually methanol [5] 

or ethanol in countries where this alcohol is easily produced and available [6]) with a 

basic catalyst, using mild operation conditions. The produced fatty acid esters cannot be 

labeled as biodiesel until they meet the EN 14214 [7] quality specifications in Europe 

,and the ASTM D6751 in the USA. As a consequence, after the transesterification 

reaction, the fatty acid methyl esters undergo several purification processes in order not 

to overcome the minimum contents in free glycerol, soap, metals, alcohol, free fatty 

acids, catalyst, water and glyceride established by the European and American 

standards. A high presence of these compounds in the biodiesel strongly affects the fuel 

properties and performance and consequently the engine life. 

One of these purification steps is the fatty acid esters washing with hot water. This 

is the most common method of purification as it is efficient in removing methanol 

glycerol, sodium compounds, free fatty acid esters and soaps [8]. 

However, one of the requirements of the European and American quality standards 

is the biodiesel water content, since water affects the calorific value of the biodiesel, can 

cause the esters to react to produce soaps and can cause blocking and wearing of the 



 

 

244 

 

engine injection system. Water in biodiesel also diminishes the shelf life of the fuel, 

since it decreases the biodiesel oxidation stability and promotes biological growth [[9, 

10]]. Consequently, after being washed with water, the fatty acid esters are dried in 

order to produce biodiesel with a water content not overcoming the maximum value of 

0.05% (w/w) imposed in Europe by the EN 14214. 

In the last few years, our research group has been addressing the measurement of 

phase equilibria and the development of thermodynamic models for the description of 

biodiesel production and purification processes [11-17]. Being able to predict the 

different phase equilibria of the binary and multicomponent systems found during the 

biodiesel production and purification, in a wide range of thermodynamic conditions, is 

essential for a correct design and optimization of these industrial processes, through the 

correct selection of suitable solvents, the most advantageous unit operations and 

separation sequence and their optimal size and operating conditions. 

Two of these studies were focused on the measurement and prediction of the water 

solubility in pure fatty acid alkyl esters and biodiesels [15, 17]. Knowing the water 

solubility in biodiesels is essential for the biodiesel production and purification 

processes, allowing tuning the more favorable raw materials and correctly designing and 

optimizing the biodiesel washing and drying units in order to produce high quality 

biodiesel in agreement with the European and American quality specifications.  

While assessing the poor performance of commonly used thermodynamic models, 

namely cubic equations of state and activity coefficient models, to describe the water 

solubility in fatty acid esters and their mixtures [15] , the authors also developed and 

applied a more theoretical sound model, the Cubic-Plus-Association equation of state 

(CPA EoS), that explicitly describes the specific interactions between like molecules (in 

this case water) and unlike molecules (cross-association, in this case between esters and 

water). In an accurate, predictive and simple way, this model proved to be the most 

appropriate to describe the water solubility in biodiesels [15, 17]. 

Following these studies, in this work, new experimental water solubility 

measurements were carried out for methyl linoleate and four biodiesels synthetized at 

our laboratory from edible oils commonly used for producing biodiesel [4]: rapeseed, 

soybean, palm and sunflower, and the CPA EoS was applied to predict these new 

experimental data.  



 

245 

 

As the CPA EoS prediction of the water solubility in biodiesels is performed using 

interaction parameters obtained from binary phase equilibria data, it was possible, using 

the new data for methyl linoleate, to evaluate the contribution of this binary system to 

the improvement of the model prediction capability for the water solubility in 

biodiesels, by reassessing the results presented before for the water solubility in six 

commercial biodiesels [17]. 

 

 

2. Experimental Section 

 

Materials  

The water solubility was measured in the biodiesels synthesized by the 

transesterification reaction with methanol of the vegetable oils: soybean, rapeseed, palm 

and sunflower. The molar ratio of oil/methanol used was 1:5 using 0.5% sodium 

hydroxide by weight of oil as a catalyst. The reaction was performed at 55 ºC during 24 

h under methanol reflux. The reaction time chosen was adopted for convenience and to 

guarantee a complete reaction conversion. Raw glycerol was removed in two steps, the 

first after 3h reaction and then after 24h reaction in a separating funnel. Biodiesel was 

purified through washing with hot distillated water until a neutral pH was achieved. The 

biodiesel was then dried until the EN ISO 14214 limit for water was reached [7]. 

Biodiesels were characterized by GC-FID following the British Standard 

EN14103 from EN 14214 [7] to know their methyl esters composition. Capillary gas 

chromatography was used to determine the methyl ester composition of the biodiesel 

samples. A Varian CP-3800 with a flame ionization detector in a split injection system 

with a Select™ Biodiesel for FAME Column, (30 m x 0.32 mm x 0.25 µm), was used to 

differentiate all methyl esters in analysis inclusively the poli-unsaturated ones. The 

column temperature was set at 120ºC and then programmed to increase up to 250 ºC, at 

4 ºC/min. Detector and injector were set at 250 ºC. The carrier gas was helium with a 

flow rate of 2 mL/min. 

The water solubility was also measured in methyl linoleate (Aldrich, 99%). 

 

 



 

 

246 

 

Experimental Procedure  

The water solubility measurements were carried out at temperatures from 288.15 to 

318.15 K and at atmospheric pressure. The methodology used in this work, has already 

been successfully used for measuring the water solubility in fatty acid esters, biodiesels 

[17] and fatty acids [12]. The ester and the water phases were initially agitated 

vigorously and allowed to reach the saturation equilibrium by the separation of both 

phases in 20 mL glass vials for at least 48 h. This period proved to be the minimum time 

required to guarantee a complete separation of the two phases and that no further 

variations in mole fraction solubilities occurred. 

The temperature was maintained by keeping the glass vials containing the phases 

in equilibrium inside an aluminium block specially designed for this purpose, which is 

placed in an isolated air bath capable of maintaining the temperature within (±0.01 K). 

The temperature control was achieved with a PID temperature controller driven by 

a calibrated Pt100 (class 1/10) temperature sensor inserted in the aluminium block. In 

order to reach temperatures below room temperature, a Julabo circulator, model F25-

HD, was coupled to the overall oven system allowing the passage of a thermostatized 

fluid flux around the aluminium block. The solubility of water in the ester rich phase 

was determined using a Metrohm 831 Karl Fischer (KF) coulometer. 

The esters rich phase was sampled at each temperature from the equilibrium vials 

using glass syringes maintained dry and at the same temperature of the measurements. 

Samples of 0.1 to 0.2 g were taken and injected directly into the KF coulometric titrator. 

The water solubility results at each individual temperature are an average of at 

least five independent measurements.

a Standard deviation 

 

The values presented for the water solubility in the biodiesels and in methyl 

linoleate are in agreement with the results previously presented [17]. As expected, since 

the water solubility in fatty acid esters increases with the ester insaturation [17], palm 

biodiesel presents the lowest water solubility, in agreement with its higher content in the 

saturated ester methyl palmitate. The other biodiesels present quite similar water 



 

249 

 

solubility values, as expected due to their analogous fatty acid ester composition, with 

the sunflower biodiesel presenting the highest water solubility. 

 

As explained at the introduction section, we have previously applied the CPA EoS 

to describe the water solubility in fatty acid esters and to predict it in biodiesels [17]. 

The information gathered in that work will be applied here, as subsequently shown, to 

predict the experimental results. 

 

Modeling with the CPA EoS starts with the definition of the CPA pure compounds 

parameters. Esters are non-self-associating compounds and consequently there are only 

three pure compound parameters from the physical term to be determined: a0, c1 and b. 

These parameters are usually determined from a simultaneous regression of vapour 

pressure and liquid density data. In a previous work [17] these parameters were 

estimated for the methyl esters C16:0, C18:0, C18:1, C18:2, which are the major components 

of commercial biodiesels . Due to the lack of reliable liquid density data for the 

unsaturated esters at the time, preference was given to the vapour pressure description. 

 

Recently, using density data for several fatty acid esters and biodiesels [21, 22], 

measured by us, it was possible to re-estimate the CPA pure compound parameters for 

all the fatty acid methyl esters found in the biodiesel samples considered in this work, 

compounds ranging from 15 to 25 carbon atoms and with up to three unsaturated bonds 

(Table 3), by a simultaneous regression of pure component data. Vapor pressures and 

liquid densities were described with global average deviations inferior to 2 % (Table 3).

Having the CPA pure compound parameters it was then possible to predict the water 

solubility in the ester multicomponent systems considered here. The kij’s for ester/ester 

were set to zero and, as already stated above, the solvation phenomena between the non-

self-associating ester and the self-associating water was considered as a cross-

association within the framework of the CPA EoS, where the cross-association energy 



 

251 

 

(?ij) was considered to be half the value of the association energy for the self-associating 

component (in this case water) and the cross-association volume (?ij) was left as an 

adjustable parameter, fitted to the equilibrium data along with the kij. 

When describing the water solubility in different fatty acid esters [17], a constant 

value for the cross-association volume, ?ij, was established (of 0.201), as well as a linear 

correlation for calculating the kij’s between esters and water was found with the chain 

length of the ester, Cn: 

 

kij=0.0136 Cn – 0.3322                       (1) 

 

This correlation, and the constant value for the cross-association volume, allowed 

predicting the water solubility in six commercial biodiesels from GALP, with global 

average deviations inferior to 15% [17]. Only for the kij between water and methyl 

oleate it was used the regressed value from phase equilibria data since it did not fit in 

the linear dependency with the carbon number determined for the saturated methyl 

esters. In addition, as phase equilibria data for the water/methyl linoleate system wasn´t 

available at that time, the kij value for this sub-binary system was made equal to the one 

established for the water/methyl oleate system. 

In this work, having measured the water solubility in methyl linoleate, the 

corresponding kij interaction parameter was determined, using the same constant value 

for the cross-association volume referred before. A kij value of -0.13 was obtained, 

describing the water solubility with global average deviations inferior to 3% (Table 4 

and Figure 1).

5. Conclusions 

 

Biodiesel is seen as one of the most important alternatives to conventional fuels 

since its use can solve the range of environmental, economic and political problems 

related to the use of conventional petroleum based fuels. 

The water content in biodiesel have significant effects on the fuel quality and 

performance and so the ability to predict this property is essential for dimensioning 

biodiesel production and purification processes and optimizing their operation within 

product specifications. 

Here new experimental measurements were performed for the water solubility in 

methyl linoleate and four methylic biodiesels synthetized from oils constituting the 

principal feedstock currently used for biodiesel production. 

The water solubility in the soybean, palm, rapeseed and sunflower biodiesels was 

predicted with the CPA EoS with global average deviations inferior to 7%.

Abstract 

Free Fatty Acids (FFA) are a by-product in edible oil refining, that are removed in the 

deodorizing step on oil purification. The deodorization is carried not just in edible oils 

but also in some cases before alkaline catalysis in biodiesel production. Enzymatic 

catalysis is here studied as an alternative to convert this by-product into biodiesel. 

As the oleic acid is one of the main components recovered in the deodorization step it 

was used in this work as model. The optimal esterification conditions of oleic acid with 

methanol and ethanol were evaluated by their influence in reaction yield. An 

experimental design 22 was followed to study the influence of the dependent variables 

in percentage of conversion, namely the alcohol / oleic acid molar ratio (R) and enzyme 

concentration (E). 

The optimal conditions obtained were R=6.3 and E=6.6% for methanol (100% 

conversion), and R=4.9 and E=5.7% for ethanol (95.5% of conversion). 

The influence of temperature on the reaction was also studied, in a range between 30 

and 60 °C for methanol, and between 30 and 70 °C for ethanol; with a molar ratio of 6 

and an enzyme concentration of 2%. It was found that the conversion increases 

monotonously with increasing temperature for ethanol. For methanol, the conversion 

has a maximum at 50 º C and then decreases. 

Another investigated variable was the pressure in the methanol esterification reaction, 

at constant temperature of 40ºC, in the same conditions as temperature study, and was 

observed that the yield increases 38% just with 90 bar of nitrogen in the vessel.  

The same enzyme was shown to the reusable up to 10 times in the esterification of 

oleic acid with ethanol, without significant loss of enzyme activity.

INTRODUCTION 

The energy used nowadays comes mostly from fossil fuels like coal, natural gas or 

oil. The fact that the reserves of fossil fuels are finite and the environmental problems 

associated with their use need a change in mindset and the use of alternative forms of 

energy production.1,2 

In these scenario vegetable oils, become more attractive, because of their renewable 

nature and environmental benefits. However, vegetable oils have some disadvantages to 

be used as a combustible.3,4 First of all, the direct use in internal combustion engines is 

problematic. Due to their high viscosity (about 5–10 times greater than diesel fuel) 5 and 

low volatility, they do not burn completely and form deposits in the fuel injectors of 

diesel engine.6 An improvement on viscosity can be obtained with transesterification, 

which seems to be the process that assures best results in terms of lowering viscosity 

and improving other characteristics.7-8 

The final product of a transesterifcation reaction of vegetal oil, with an alcohol in a 

presence of a catalyst, is a mixture of alkyl esters that is known as biodiesel. It is highly 

biodegradable in fresh water as well as in soil.9 Furthermore, the use of biodiesel in 

diesel engines reduces the emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, particulate 

matter and sulphur dioxide.5,10,11. Biodiesel is said to be carbon neutral, it means that 

CO2 produced from their combustion is being put back into the atmosphere, as recently 

has been removed from there by photosynthesis during the growth of the feedstock 

crops. 

The transesterification process, used in biodiesel production, can be carried out in 

different ways such as alkali, acid or bio-catalysis. Of all these methods, the alkali 

process is the most used in industrial scale but it presents problems of separation of 

catalyst and unreacted methanol from biodiesel.4,12 Biocatalysis eliminates these 

disadvantages producing biodiesel with a very high purity. Nevertheless enzyme 

catalyzed process offers several additional benefits:13 

-compatibility with variations in quality of the raw the raw materials, 

-few process steps, 

-higher quality glycerol, 

-improved phase separation (no emulsification from soaps) 

-reduce energy consumption and wastewater volumes. 



 

 

268 

 

 

However, the enzymatic process has not been implemented in an industrial scale due 

to enzymes high cost, lipase low activity or enzyme inhibition by methanol.14,15 

The raw material costs and limited availability of raw vegetable oil are being recently 

critical issues for the biodiesel production.16 Therefore, it has been necessary to look for 

another raw material to produce biodiesel. Acid oils or raw materials with high levels of 

available free fatty acids could be an alternative. In these cases the alkaline catalysis has 

serious limitations, and the enzymatic production of biodiesel is a good alternative. 

In this work the performance of lipase Novozym® 435 was tested as a biocatalyst in 

the enzymatic esterification reaction of oleic acid with an alcohol, to produce biodiesel 

in a solvent-free system, shown in Figure 1. It was also tested the effect of reactions 

factors, as enzyme quantity and alcohol / oil molar ratio. Another studied variable was 

pressure of an inert gas in the vessel reaction.

The process of biodiesel production was optimized by application of the experimental 

design and Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Using a factorial planning with 

three levels, the influence of temperature, enzyme/oil ratio and methanol/oil ratio was 

studied, as well as their interaction. After being verified that the temperature had no 

statistical significance, on the studied range, a new design factorial 22 was defined. In 

order to improve the response surface another design was defined on the region with 

higher conversions, central composite 22. The tested variables were methanol/oleic acid 

molar ratio and enzyme concentration. 

The reaction effects were studied to indicate the best stoichiometry conditions to 

perform the esterification reaction with Novozym 435. The temperature was studied 

later on a larger range of values under fixed conditions of alcohol/oleic acid molar ratio 

and enzyme concentration. To study the reuse of the immobilized enzymes was carried 

out a set of ten consecutive tests of three hours for each alcohol. In order to evaluate 



 

269 

 

pressure influence on esterification reaction, variable pressures of an inert gas were 

added in the beginning of the reaction, and then evaluated its effect on the yield. 

 

 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

 

Materials. Novozym 435, a commercial Lipase B from Candida antartiac, 

immobilized on macroporous acrylic resin was used as a catalyst in the esterification 

reaction of oleic acid. It was a kind gift of Novozymes to perform this work. 

Oleic acid (90.0% m/m) was supplied by Aldrich. Methanol and Ethanol (99.9% 

m/m) was purchased from Lab-scan, and all other chemicals used were obtained 

commercially and were of analytical grade. 

 

Esterification process. The enzymatic esterification reactions were carried out in a 

closed vase containing oleic acid, the enzyme and alcohol. All reagents and catalyst 

were weighted in a five digits balance. The reaction was carried out in an orbital stirrer 

with controlled temperature and stirring. After the reaction two samples were collected 

from the bottom of the final product. Finally the samples were dried passing through 

anhydrous sodium sulfate. Variables that could affect the yield, like total volume of 

vase, and total volume of reagents, were maintained constant in each experiment. 

The work was performed in several steps, a previous study was made to define 

reaction time in order to keep it constant though all experiments, then the influence in 

the yield of reaction factors, and at last temperature and pressure effects were studied. 

 

Sample derivatization. Before gas chromatography analysis, samples were silylated 

as follows17: approximately 30 µL of each dried sample was dissolved in 100 µL of 

pyridine. At this point compounds containing carboxyl groups were converted into TMS 

esters, by adding 100 µL of bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoro-acetamide (BSTFA) and 50 µL 

of trimethylchlorosilane, and keeping at 70°C for 30 min. Then the derivatized samples 

were analyzed by gas chromatography. 

 

Analysis of methyl esters. The methyl ester contents were quantified using a 

capillary gas chromatography. Each sylilated sample was injected into a gas

chromatographer with a flame ionization detector (Varian 3800 GC-FID) in a split 

injection system with the ratio of 1:20. On analysis a DB1-ht column (length: 15 m, 

internal diameter: 0.32 mm and film thickness: 0.1 µm) coated with 0.1 µm film of 

dimethylpolysiloxane was used. The column temperature was set at 100 ºC and then 

programmed to increase up to 200 ºC, at 8 ºC/min with a final landing of 5 min holding 

the temperature. Detector and injector temperatures were set at 220 ºC and 250 ºC, 

respectively. The carrier gas was Helium with a flow rate of 2 mL/min. 

 

Yield quantification. The percentage of conversion (alkyl esters formed) on the 

reaction was quantified by comparison between the areas from the peaks of alkyl esters 

and oleic acid on the chromatogram according to Equation 1 , where Aae is the area of 

the peak of alkyl ester and Aoa is the area of the peak of oleic acid.

Software. All statistical analysis were made using Statistica 8.0 from Statsoft© 

(ANOVA and pareto chart), Matlab R2009b from The MathWorksTM (response 

surface and contour plot) and Microsoft Office Excel 2007 from Microsoft©. The 

confidence level used was 90%. 

 

 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

 

Study of reaction time. An initial study of the conversion over time was made in 

order to define a reaction time that could be used though all experiments. Esterification 

reaction of oleic acid with methanol was followed during 24 hours (Figure 212). The 

alcohol/oleic acid molar ratio was 6 and the enzyme concentration was 2%. The 

agitation used was 150 rpm with a temperature of 40 ºC. All variables were selected 

based on available literature. 13  -  21 This reaction was repeated using ethanol, with similar 

results. 

To evaluate the influence of variable in the yield three hours of reaction time was 

chosen and was used in all experiments.

To carry a statistical analysis with the experimental results of each experimental 

design a second order mathematical model was generated where, not only the linear 

effects for each variable, but also the quadratic effects and the interaction between each 

variable were considered. Were considered as significant parameters those with p under 

10% (p&lt;0.1), due to the large variability inherent to bioprocesses.

On the Pareto chart shown on Figure  are represented the effects considered for the 

reaction. The height of the bars shows the absolute value of t calculated and the bars are 

arranged in descending order of significance. The vertical line gives the t tabulated  

(t10, 0.1/2 =1.81) from which the effects are considered significant for a confidence 

level of 90%. The parameters with no statistical significance are incorporated to 

residuals on ANOVA analysis (Table 2). 

In agreement with Figure 3 enzyme concentration is the most significant variable. The 

effects that show statistical significance (p&lt;0.10) are the enzyme concentration (E), 

methanol/oleic acid molar ratio (R), enzyme concentration-temperature interaction 

(ExT), temperature-methanol/oleic acid molar ratio interaction (TxR) and quadratic 

enzyme concentration (E2). 

The proposed method has a very good coefficient of determination (R2=0.971) and F 

calculated is highly significant (p=0.000002), as can be seen on Table 2, which 

demonstrates a good adjustment of the model to the experimental values.

For the statistical analysis the experimental values obtained from both experimental

on these results it was possible to create a second order mathematical model for studied 

parameters and their interaction, represented on Equation 3.

By the analysis of the Pareto chart and the table of regression coefficients (Figure 4), 

it can be seen that that the most significant effects (p&lt;0.1) are methanol/oleic acid molar 

ratio (R), quadratic methanol/oleic acid molar ratio (R2) and methanol/oleic acid molar 

ratio-enzyme concentration interaction (RxE). The most significant variable is the 

quadratic methanol/oleic acid molar ratio (R2).

The response surface and contour plot indicate that the reaction is favored by a 

methanol/oleic acid molar ratio equal to concentration of enzyme in the range 4 to 9. It 

is possible to obtain a complete reaction with a molar ratio of 4 and an enzyme 

concentration of 4%, as also 9 and 9% respectively. 

For values of enzyme concentration above 6, an increase of the molar ratio up to 

about 5 benefits the reaction, but the conversion decrease for higher enzyme 

concentration values. 

The oblique arrangement of curves in contour plot indicates that the interaction is 

significant in the tested model. 

The maximum value of the Equation 3 was over 100%, due to the mathematical 

extrapolation, which corresponded to the conditions of a molar ratio of 6.32 and an 

enzyme concentration of 6.64%. This point was tested experimentally and a conversion 

of 100% was obtained.

From the analysis of Pareto chart and the table of regression coefficients (Figure 7 

and Table 8) can be observed that the interaction ethanol/oleic acid molar ratio-enzyme 

concentration (RxE) is the only factor that has no statistical significance with a 

confidence level of 90%. The enzyme concentration is the most significant variable.

The correlation of the model is 0.760, which can be considered acceptable 

considering that we are working with biological catalysts. The value of F calculated is 

good when compared to the tabled (F 5;12;0.1=2.39) as shown in the ANOVA table.

Based on the response surface and contour plots represented on Figure 8 and Figure 9 

the conditions that result on a higher conversion of ethyl esters can be identified. It is 

possible to verify that the area with higher conversion (&gt;80%) lies between a molar 

ratio of 3 and 7 and an enzyme concentration between 4 and 7%. These graphs indicate 

that the conversion increases with increasing ethanol/oleic acid molar ratio up to about 5 

and there is a decrease on the conversion for higher molar ratio values. The increase in 

enzyme concentration has a positive effect in response up to values of about 6%, and 

from that value, the conversion decreases.  

The maximum value of the Equation 5 was about 93.4%, which corresponded to the 

conditions of a molar ratio of 4.87 and an enzyme concentration of 5.65%. The result 

obtained experimentally for these conditions was 95.5%, a value close to expected, 

confirming the suitability of the model.

Study of the Temperature influence on the reaction 

 

The influence of the temperature on the reaction was presented in Figure 10. As can 

be seen, the conversion increases monotonously with increasing temperature when 

ethanol is used for the range of values studied. For methanol the conversion increases 

up to approximately 50 ºC and decreases with increasing temperature for higher 

temperatures. This behavior can be explained by the fact that methanol is more adverse 

to the enzyme than ethanol. So, for higher temperatures, the enzyme is deactivated by 

methanol leading to lower conversions.

Study of pressure effect 

 

Esterification reaction was carried in a stainless-steel cell in which the pressure is 

varied, keeping all other parameters constants. A high pressure cell made in stainless 

steel was especially developed for the effect. The reaction occurs inside the cell that was 

carried on an incubator with orbital stirring at 40ºC, 150 rpm for 3 hours. Molar ratio

The same enzyme can be used 10 times in the enzymatic esterification of oleic acid

It was verified by the study of temperature influence, by the fact that the molar ratio 

between the alcohol and oleic acid is the variable with higher significance on 

esterification with methanol, contrary to esterification with ethanol, and in the study of 

enzyme reuse, that methanol is more deleterious to the enzyme than ethanol.

First section presents the biodiesel properties which were measured and modelled on 

this thesis. 

Density and Viscosity of biodiesel and its pure components have now new reliable 

data in a wide range of temperature, as well as in a range of pressure for the density. 

New experimental data of density and viscosity of pure saturated and unsaturated 

methyl and ethyl esters and biodiesel of different raw material in a temperature range of 

273K to 363K and atmospheric pressure are presented. Here were studied 15 methyl 

esters which 6 are unsaturated compounds (with 2 polyunsaturated) and 10 ethyl esters 

which 3 are unsaturated, as well as 8 different biodiesel samples, fatty acid methyl 

esters, produced in our laboratory.  

An extensive critical review of the data available for these systems was carried out 

to identify spurious or poor quality data among the often conflicting data previously 

found in the literature. For biodiesel fuels the lack of information about its composition 

limited the utility of most data available in the open literature. 

The performance of predictive models for these properties was evaluated. GC-VOL 

model was tested for density as its group contribution methods, it can predict the 

property directly from their structure. GC-VOL model shows to be able to predict 

density of pure methyl and ethyl esters with deviations lower than 1% for saturated 

esters and 2% for unsaturated. In order to improve predictive ability of GC-VOL model 

to this type of compounds, new coefficients were proposed. Thus deviations of density 

of pure esters were reduced to 0.25% and for biodiesel to 0.37%. 

Group contribution models were evaluated in prediction of pure esters viscosity. 

Ceriani &amp;amp; Meirelles model provide a fair description of viscosity of fatty acid esters 

with a global average deviation of 8.8% while Marrero &amp;amp; Gani model presents an 

average deviation of 20.9% for overall pure esters. 

Several models were tested in biodiesel viscosity evaluation. Yuan, Ceriani &amp;amp; 

Meirelles and Krisnangkura models present average deviation of 5.34%, 8.07% and 

7.25%, respectively. A revised Yuan’s model was proposed which provides the best 

description of experimental data with an average deviation of 4.65%. 



 

 

292 

 

Density at pressures up to 45 MPa was also measured for 3 pure methyl esters and 8 

biodiesels fuels. High pressure experimental data were successfully predicted with the 

CPA EoS, with a maximum deviation of 2.5%. 

To understand the biodiesel cold flow performances data on the phase equilibria of 

biodiesel below the CP were measured. The UNIQUAC predictive model is shown to 

be capable of providing an adequate representation of the phase equilibria for these 

systems below their cloud point. 

A large number of properties depend on the esters profile of biodiesel, such as 

density, viscosity, iodine index, and CFPP. The objective of this study is to evaluate the 

properties of biodiesel oils obtained from different raw materials. Biodiesels made from 

feedstock containing higher concentrations of high-melting point saturated long-chain 

fatty acids tends to have poor cold flow properties. Biodiesel made from raw material 

with higher concentrations of unsaturated long-chain fatty acids presents low resistance 

to oxidation as expressed by a high iodine value. 

Water solubility data on biodiesels were measured and modelled. The good results 

obtained for water + fatty acid mixtures, for the mutual solubilities of water + ester 

binary system, and for the solubility of water in biodiesel encourage the application of 

the CPA EoS for the design of extraction units for fatty acid an biodiesel production. 

In second section the study of enzymatic esterification of oleic acid catalyzed by 

Novozym 435 was presented. Different results were obtained for reaction with methanol 

or with ethanol. For the first alcohol, less quantity of enzyme and also less excess of 

alcohol are necessary to achieve 100% yield. Esterification reaction is benefited being 

carried out under pressure, obtained a yield 38% higher with just 90 bar.

Ideas to the future 
 

In consequence of environmental, economical and also political turmoil, caused by 

the excessive use and dependency of conventional petroleum based fuels the attention of 

several countries has been addressed towards the development of alternative fuels from 

renewable resources.1,2 

The world has got so accustomed to using petrofuels that we never realized that they 

came with an expiry date. Who can imagine a world without planes, cars and trains? 

Many scientists have started researching alternatives to the fuels that we use. These 

alternatives need to be lasting and renewable in nature. Initial attempts at replacing fuels 

with electricity to run cars have proved successful. However, the performance of these 

cars does not match that of the conventional petrol or diesel-run engines. So it becomes 

necessary to replace existing fuels and biodiesel appears as an alternative. 

After examining the pros and cons of biofuels, we may be left wondering if they are 

really worthwhile and right for us. On one hand biofuels could potentially reduce 

carbon emissions and can help save cash too; but on the other hand biofuels can 

negatively affect the habitat of many species and aren’t necessarily energy efficient at 

the production stage.  

With the increase in global human population, more land may be needed to produce 

food for human consumption (indirectly via animal feed). The problem already exists in 

Asia. Vegetal oil prices are relatively higher there. The same trend will eventually 

happen in the rest of the world. This is the potential challenge to biodiesel. From this 

point of view, biodiesel can be used most effectively as a supplement to other energy 

forms, not as a primary source. Biodiesel is particularly useful in mining and marine 

situations where lower pollution levels are important. 

Perhaps the biggest hope for biofuels is that the arrival of second and third generation 

alternatives should lead to more efficient production and diversify the plants as well as 

plant wastes used – therefore limiting the effects to any particular habitat. Biofuels are 

very much a work in progress. 



 

 

294 

 

The studies on biofuels are important but even if fossil diesel will not be completely 

substitute by biofuels, it can reduce our dependence from those kind of non renewable 

source of energy. 

Even though future discoveries and inventions in renewable energy might be 

surprising, it is nonetheless important for us to start learning how to consume energy 

more sensibly.
