resumo 
 
 

 

O trabalho aqui apresentado visa dar uma compreensão didática do 
dimensionamento de pontes mistas de aço e betão, assim como avaliar a 
resposta estrutural sob condições de serviço de pontes mistas, quando sujeitas 
a diferentes processos construtivos. Tendo isto em consideração, é apresentada 
uma descrição teórica, seguindo-se um exemplo numérico e um estudo focado 
no comportamento em serviço de pontes mistas, quando sujeitas a diferentes 
processos construtivos. 
 
A descrição teórica estabelece uma breve exposição das formas e dos 
elementos estruturais de uma ponte mista, seguindo-se as principais formas 
construtivas e as principais vantagens associadas a este tipo de pontes, 
terminando com uma descrição das etapas de cálculo de acordo com as 
metodologias preconizadas pelos Eurocódigos, com o intuito de desenvolver um 
conhecimento teórico relacionado com o dimensionamento de pontes mistas de 
aço e betão.  
 
O exemplo numérico tem como objetivo aplicar o conhecimento adquirido, 
exemplificando as diferentes etapas de cálculo do dimensionamento de pontes 
mistas, dando especial ênfase às diferentes ações que atuam na ponte e a forma 
como estas são modeladas, assim como à verificação aos estados limite último 
e de serviço das seções transversais do tabuleiro misto. 
 
O estudo focado no comportamento ao serviço das pontes mistas de aço e betão 
tem como finalidade analisar e avaliar a resposta estrutural das pontes mistas 
sob condições de serviço, quando sujeitas a diferentes processos construtivos. 
Assim sendo, o estado de tensões e as deformações devidas a cargas de curta 
e longa duração, bem como os efeitos da fissuração do betão sobre as zonas 
de suportes são analisados. Esta análise estrutural é efetuada com o programa 
de análise e dimensionamento MIDAS/Civil 2015 (V2.2).

abstract  
 

 

The work presented herein aims to give a didactical understanding related to the 

composite bridge designing according to the methodologies proposed by 

Eurocodes, as well as to evaluate the structural response under service 

conditions of composite bridges when considering different construction 

processes. Taking this into account, a theoretical description, followed by a 

numerical example, until a study focused on the serviceability behaviour of 

composite bridges when considering different construction processes are 

presented. 

 

The theoretical description establishes a brief description related to the structural 

forms and structural elements of a composite bridge, followed by the main 

constructive forms and the advantages of such type of bridges, until description 

of the steps calculation according to the methodologies performed by Eurocodes, 

in order to develop a theoretical knowledge related to the steel concrete 

composite bridge designing. 

 

The numerical example aims to apply the acquired knowledge, exemplifying the 

different calculation steps of a composite bridge designing, highlighting the 

various actions acting on the bridge, and how they are modelled, as well as the 

verification at ultimate and serviceability limit states of the deck cross sections. 

 

The study focused on the serviceability behaviour of composite bridges aims to 

analyse and evaluate the structural response under service conditions when 

considering different construction processes. Taking this into consideration, 

short and long term stresses, deflections, as well as the effect of concrete 

cracking above supports are analysed. This study is solved through the analysis 

Program MIDAS/Civil 2015 (V2.2).

Introduction 

 

1. Introduction 
The history of bridge engineering is in part connected with the history of humanity, 

which, since the earliest times, has sought for ways to cross over barriers in order to 

communicate. Franklin D. Roosevelt once said: “There can be little doubt that in many ways 

the story of bridge-building is the story of civilization. By it we can readily measure an 

important part of a people’s progress”. (Weingardt, 2005, p. 53) 

“The Romans understood that the establishment and maintenance of their empire 

depended on efficient and permanent communications. Building roads and bridges was 

therefore a high priority”. (Ryall, et al, 2000, p. 3) 

Actually Romans were truly the first great bridge builders to use stones and, in some 

cases, cement to build arch bridges, their characteristic structural form of bridges. With the 

fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century, bridge engineering did not have a major 

development until the 19th century.  

The industrial revolution brought huge changes to all aspects of life and bridge design 

was not an exception. “Wood and stone were gradually replaced by cast iron and wrought 

iron constructions, which in turn was replaced by first steel and then concrete; the two 

primary materials of bridge building in the twentieth century”. (Ryall, et al, 2000, p. 17) 

Of all types of bridges, steel-concrete composite ones have become most popular, 

particularly in Europe. “The greater majority of European countries now build composite 

bridges” (Sétra - Service d'études sur les transports, les routes et leurs aménagements, 2010, 

p. 13) 

 Thus, this dissertation aims to give an understanding of the behaviour of such type 

of bridges, including its advantages, followed by a description of the composite bridge 

designing, until the design of a composite bridge, highlighting the verification part of the 

design according to the methodologies proposed by Eurocodes, mainly by Eurocode 4 part 

2, which is related to design of composite steel and concrete bridges. Moreover, a structural 

analysis focused on the structural response under service conditions of composite bridges 

when considering different construction processes is under scope.

1.1 Objectives 

As it can be inferred by the above lines, the purpose of this dissertation is to present 

a didactical description about conceptual design of composite steel and concrete bridges, in 

order to give a better understanding of the behaviour of such type of bridges, followed by a 

numerical example which details the steps calculation according to methodologies proposed 

by Eurocodes, until the study of the influence of the construction process on the 

serviceability behaviour of composite bridges.  

The general description aims to establish the main reasons to combine the two 

structural materials, concrete and structural steel, as well as the connection between these 

two materials. Moreover, a description related to the structural elements of a composite 

bridge, and their main functions, followed by the constructive forms and advantages of such 

type of bridges, until description of the steps calculation according to the methodologies 

performed by Eurocodes is under scope.     

The numerical example is intended to exemplify the different calculation steps of a 

composite bridge designing, highlighting the various actions acting on the bridge, and how 

they are modelled, as well as the verification at ultimate and serviceability limit states of the 

deck cross sections. 

On its turn, the goal of the structural analysis is to analyse and evaluate the structural 

response under service conditions of composite bridges when considering different 

construction processes.  

 

1.2 Thesis Lay-out 

The present thesis contains 6 chapters, including this introduction (Chapter 1) and 

conclusion (Chapter 6). Chapter 1, provides a brief reference to the importance of the bridge 

engineering in the people’s progress, as well as it introduces the goals of this thesis.  

The second and third chapters covers a literature review of steel and concrete 

composite bridge designing. In Chapter 2, a general overview of composite steel and

into consideration in order to adopt the most proper constructive structural system, the 

advantages of such type of bridges, until an overall analysis of the properties of the two 

structural materials (concrete and structural steel), which play an important role on the 

behaviour of composite structures. Chapter 3 includes the standards used (Eurocodes) in the

Steel – concrete composite bridges 

 

2. Steel – concrete composite bridges 
“A bridge is a spatial object whose purpose is to cross an obstacle (valley, water, or 

road) with a communication route”. (Lebet, Hirt, 2013, p.13)  

The concept of steel-concrete composite bridges, commonly designated as composite 

bridges (Figure 2-1), is that the bridge combines different materials, namely concrete and 

steel. 

 
Figure 2-1 - Schematic view of the structural elements of a composite twin girder bridge (Lebet &amp;amp; Hirt, 

2013) 

The main reason to combine these materials is related to the benefits of both 

structural materials, because while concrete is excellent for dealing with compressive forces, 

steel also can carry large tensile stresses. (Vayas, Iliopoulos, 2013) Therefore, according to 

(Collings, 2005), to understand the basic behaviour of a composite structure, there are two 

primary points to consider:  

? The differences between the materials; 

? The connection of the two materials.  

In order to have a better understanding of this type of bridges, both points listed 

above, as well other relevant points, such as the structural form, structural elements, and 

construction forms, are to be detailed on the following sections. 



Design of Composite Steel and Concrete Bridges

2.1. Structural form 

“Most commonly, steel-concrete composite structures take a simple beam and slab 

form”. (Collings, 2005, p. 1) However, composite structures, allows the conception of a wide 

variety of possible solutions to different type of problems, such as truss beam, arch bridges, 

inclined leg bridge, cable stayed bridge and suspension bridge.  

“The choice and configuration of the longitudinal structure of a bridge are primarily 

a function of the size of the obstacle to be crossed, the length of the spans, the accessibility 

of the location, and the possible methods of execution”. (Lebet,  Hirt, 2013, p. 78) Figure 

2-2, shows the most usual longitudinal structural forms, according to the span ranges.  

 

Figure 2-2 - Span ranges for main bridge type (Lebet &amp;amp; Hirt, 2013) 

 

2.2. Structural elements of the bridge 

The structural elements that constitute the bridges are the substructure and the 

superstructure as represented in Figure 2-3.  

 

Figure 2-3 - Structural elements (Lebet &amp;amp; Hirt, 2013)



2 - Steel – concrete composite bridges

2.2.1. Substructure  

The substructure is formed by the elements that support the bridges, such as the piers, 

abutments and foundations. The main function of these elements is to provide support to the 

superstructure and transfer the actions down to the ground. (Lebet, Hirt, 2013) These 

elements are generally of reinforced concrete and for this reason are not be detailed on the 

present work. 

 

2.2.2. Superstructure 

The superstructure comprises the individual elements such as the slab, the main 

beams with their shear connectors, the cross bracing and the plan bracing. (Lebet, Hirt, 2013) 

The main function of the slab is essentially related to the transmission of the traffic 

loads to the primary structural elements of the bridge, while the main beams (longitudinal 

structural elements of the bridge) are responsible for the transference of the loads coming 

from the slab to the supports by bending, by shear, and by torsion. (Lebet, Hirt, 2013) 

“The steelwork is relatively slender and usually requires bracing to ensure stability”. 

(Collings, 2005, p. 20) Depending on whether this bracing system is composed by planar 

elements perpendicular to the bridge axis or by horizontal elements, is defined as cross or 

plan bracing, respectively.  

Cross bracing play an important role in composite bridges, because it prevents 

deformation of the bridge cross section, and transfers the horizontal forces which act on the 

main beams (due to wind, effects of curvature) to the plan bracing. Figure 2-4, illustrates the 

most common forms of cross bracing. (Lebet, Hirt, 2013) 

 
Figure 2-4 – Types of bracing (Lebet,  Hirt, 2013) 

Furthermore, the plan bracing, 

which sometimes is temporary used 

during construction (Figure 2-5), 

ensures the lateral behaviour of the 

bridge by stiffening the primary 

structure in the horizontal plane. 

(Lebet, Hirt, 2013) 

 
Figure 2-5 - Plan bracing (Lebet, Hirt, 2013)

The connection between the two structural materials (concrete and steel) has a 

fundamental role in composite behaviour, since that if is adequately connected, the two parts 

act as one whole structure, increasing the structural efficiency. This connection is achieved 

through shear connectors (Figure 2-6), which are defined as “devices for ensuring force 

transfer at steel-concrete interface that carry the shear and any connection between the 

materials”. (Collings, 2005, p. 13) 

There are two basic forms of 

connectors: flexible or rigid. Flexible 

connectors, such as headed studs behave 

in a ductile manner, allowing significant 

movement or slip at the ultimate limit 

state, while the rigid connectors, such as 

bars behave in a more brittle fashion. 

Therefore, bops are an intermediate type 

between the rigid and the flexible 

connectors. (Collings, 2005) 

 

Figure 2-6 - Types of shear connectors: studs, bars 

with bops and channels (Collings, 2005) 

 

2.2.3. Other components 

Other components are used to ensure the proper functioning of a bridge, namely, 

expansion joints, bearings and water evacuation system. (Lebet &amp;amp; Hirt, 2013) A brief 

description of these elements is presented below.   

 

2.2.3.1. Expansion joints 

Expansion joints are flexible links that are used at the ends of the bridges to “assure 

the continuity of the rolling surface between the deck and abutments, or between two 

separate parts of the deck”. (Lebet, Hirt, 2013, p. 26) They must be able to allow movement 

of the superstructure relative the substructure, as well as to support the vertical loads from 

the traffic.  

These flexible links should be manufactured and designed according to the 

regulations of the European Technical Approval (ETA), as well as not increase the degree 

of the bridge’s static indeterminacy by restraining degrees of freedom at supports, be 

waterproof and produce low noise when vehicles are passing over them. (Vayas, Iliopoulos, 

2013)

Since expansion joints have a limited design life (mainly due to the effects of traffic) 

and their replacement is expensive, “the current trend is to reduce the number of expansion 

joints for a bridge”. (Lebet, Hirt, 2013, p. 26)  

 

2.2.3.2. Water evacuation 

With the purpose of preventing standing water on the rolling surface that can be 

dangerous for traffic, as well as can accelerate structural degradation (damage of the concrete 

due to either freeze-thaw action or chlorides in the water and in the case of the steel can lead 

to corrosion), it is necessary to conceive a complete system for water evacuation. (Lebet &amp;amp; 

Hirt, 2013) 

 

2.2.3.3. Bearings  

Bearings are structural devices placed at the interface between the superstructure and 

the substructure (Figure 2-3), which ensure the transfer of the vertical and horizontal forces 

from the superstructure to the piers and abutments as well as the necessary movements of 

the superstructure (e.g. due to temperature and humidity changes, creep, shrinkage, fatigue 

effects, dynamic load effects and overload). (Lebet &amp;amp; Hirt, 2013) 

Generally, these devices have a short design life, during which require the necessity 

to “check them regularly, to provide the necessary maintenance, and if necessary to replace 

them”. (Lebet &amp;amp; Hirt, 2013, p. 25) Table 2-1, summarizes the most common types of 

bearings according to its major properties, as well as the typical use.

2.3. Construction forms  

There exist multiple aspects that should be taken into consideration in order to adopt 

the most proper constructive structural system, such as the available construction depth and 

the geographical and topographical characteristics of the bridge location, as well as the future 

reconstruction activities and maintenance. Since the composite bridges are structures which 

comprises a concrete slab connected to the steel structure, the construction form corresponds 

to the erection of the steel structure, and to the slab construction. Both points listed above 

are detailed on the following. 

 

2.3.1. Erection of steel structure 

As stated by (Vayas &amp;amp; Iliopoulos, 2013, p.57), “the erection method is a complicated 

issue and cannot be covered in few paragraphs”, in such a way that it “defines the load history 

of the bridge and has a primary influence on the evolution of stresses and deformations”. 

Taking this into account, a brief description of the most common methods of the steel 

structure erection is present on the following, highlighting the fundamental characteristics, 

as well as its advantages and drawbacks.

2.3.1.1. Installation by launching 

The method of erection by launching (Figure 2-7) is the most commonly 

implemented method, which consists on assembly the elements of the structuture in an area 

that is in line with the bridge axis (located at one or both ends), and launching it up to its 

final position. (Lebet &amp;amp; Hirt, 2013) On its turn,  according to (Sétra - Service d'études sur 

les transports, les routes et leurs aménagements, 2010) the steel structure can be moved by 

rolling over saddles incorporating rollers or by sliding on skids. In addition, a launching nose 

(temporary steeel structure) is fixed to the front of the permanent steel frames, in order to 

reduce the cantilever loads.      

 

 

Figure 2-7 - Erection by launching principle (Lebet &amp;amp; Hirt, 2013) 

 On the following, the main advantages and drawbacks related to this erection method, 

according to (Vayas &amp;amp; Iliopoulos, 2013) and (Sétra - Service d'études sur les transports, les 

routes et leurs aménagements, 2010), are listed. 

  

Advantages Drawbacks 

o It does not requires special 

installations, except on the permanent 

pier heads and behind abutments; 

o Allows all the steelwork  elements to 

be assembled on the ground in the 

assembly area, which leads to 

optimum safety conditions; 

o Adequate solution for traffic routes 

whit very small possibility of 

interrupting traffic. 

o Launching requires extensive 

technical capability and multiple 

specific equipment items; 

o The time to install the steel frame is 

longer; 

o Sufficient space is available behind an 

abutment and in line with the bridge 

axis for steelwork assembly; 

o The bridge must be either straight or 

curved in plan with a constant radius if 

it is to be launched from a single 

abutment.

2.3.1.2. Crane installation 

The method of erection by crane consists in lifting the steel structure and placing it 

on its permanent bearings using a crane. This method is possible either on a ground site, 

using mobile cranes on ground or on an aquatic site, using floating derricks, as illustarted in 

Figure 2-8. (Sétra - Service d'études sur les transports, les routes et leurs aménagements, 

2010) 

 

Figure 2-8 - Erection by crane principle (Sétra - Service d'études sur les transports, les routes et leurs 

aménagements, 2010) 

On the following, the main advantages and drawbacks related to this erection method, 

according to (Sétra - Service d'études sur les transports, les routes et leurs aménagements, 

2010), are presented. 

  

Advantages Drawbacks 

o Usually represents an economic 

solution: 

o It is possible for all bridge geometries; 

o It represents the installation method 

that applies the least stress to the steel 

frame; 

o Allows steel structure installation in 

usually less than one day; 

o It requires no launching area. 

o Post-installation operations are 

difficult and must effectively be 

performed at height and under less 

favourable conditions than at an 

assembly area; 

o When ground is of poor quality, the 

crane can represent large zones to be 

prepared and this increase the 

construction cost; 

o Floating derrick has a high cost 

associated; 

o Usually the use of floating derricks 

require an interruption of navigable 

waterway traffic.

2.3.1.3. Installation by shifting 

The method of erection by shifting consists in the construction of steel structure on 

temporary supports located parallel to its final position, and then sliding or shifting it for the 

final position using cables or jacks, as ilustrated in Figure 2-9. 

 

 

Figure 2-9 - Erection by shifting principle (Sétra - Service d'études sur les transports, les routes et leurs 

aménagements, 2010) 

On the following, the main advantages and drawbacks related to this erection method, 

according to (Sétra - Service d'études sur les transports, les routes et leurs aménagements, 

2010), are presented. 

 

Advantages Drawbacks 

o Very brief interruption of traffic on the 

supported road; 

o No steel frame weight limitation 

because of low friction coefficient 

(5%), allowing shifting of both 

steelwork, slab and possible deck 

equipment; 

o Very suitable method to replacing an 

existing bridge deck.  

o High cost; 

o Sometimes it may be difficult to find a 

sufficient wide area along the bridge to 

be replaced.

2.3.1.4. Installation by hoisting 

Installation by hoisting (Figure 2-10) is a method mainly appropriate for bridges 

crossing waterways, which consists in hoisting up the central parts of the bridge to their final 

level, through lifting devices attached to the cantilever parts of the bridge. (Vayas &amp;amp; 

Iliopoulos, 2013) 

 

 

Figure 2-10 - Erection by hoisting principle (Sétra - Service d'études sur les transports, les routes et leurs 

aménagements, 2010) 

 

On the following, the main advantages and drawbacks related to this erection method, 

according to (Sétra - Service d'études sur les transports, les routes et leurs aménagements, 

2010), are listed. 

 

Advantages Drawbacks 

o The main assembly work is 

undertaken on the ground or at the 

fabrication shop, thus under optimum 

safety and quality conditions; 

o Heavy and large elements can be 

hoisted in few hours, which leads to 

less interruption of river traffic.   

o Hoisting operations are complex and 

requiring particularly skilled work 

teams; 

o High cost; 

o The wind speed during erection must 

be very low (less than 5 m/s).

2.3.2. Slab construction  

According to (Sétra - Service d'études sur les transports, les routes et leurs 

aménagements, 2010), there exist two major families of composite bridge slab construction 

methods: cast in-situ and precasting. 

 Both methods above mentioned offer many advantages, depending of the details 

required for a specific situation. Casting in-situ is the most common option for constructing 

the slab, in such a way that “minimises the number of joints in the slab, allows the steel 

frame imperfections to be corrected and optimises both the slab reinforcement tonnage and 

the frame steel consumption”. (Sétra - Service d'études sur les transports, les routes et leurs 

aménagements, 2010, p.148)  

Precast slab construction ensures a quicker slab construction, a higher industrialised 

process of fabrication, and thus a better quality, as well as it reduces shrinkage effects, which 

leads greatly to slab cracking. On its turn, precasting has a number of major drawbacks, such 

as the reduction in the monolithistic character of the slab, and multiplication of potentially 

weakening closing joints, particularly when the joints are not in compression. (Sétra - 

Service d'études sur les transports, les routes et leurs aménagements, 2010) 

The following sections, provide a brief description of these two construction 

methods. 

          

2.3.2.1. Slab construction by in-situ casting using mobile formwork 

Slab casting in-situ with mobile formwork is a widely used solution for the majority 

of composite bridges, particularly to twin composite girder bridges. It is an advantageous 

solution for long bridges that are high above the ground, and consists in an equipment that 

supports the formwork for the slab cantilevers by means of hangers, which travels on the 

steel frame.  

Furthermore, the formwork between the steel beams is often supported on the cross 

bracing, and is moved by sliding. Thus, the need to move the formwork should be taken into 

consideration during the conceptual design of the bridge cross section. Taking this into 

account, the cross bracing needs to be located in an appropriate position, in order to facilitate 

these operations. (Lebet &amp;amp; Hirt, 2013) 

In Figure 2-11, an example of a typically mobile formwork, highlighting its main 

elements is represented.

Figure 2-11 - Example of mobile formwork (Lebet &amp;amp; Hirt, 2013) 

 

2.3.2.2. Slab construction by precasting 

Slab construction by precasting is a method associated with rapid execution, which 

involves the construction of slab by adopting precast elements, fabricated either in a factory 

or in site, and then transported and placed on the steel beams, prior to finally concreting the 

closing joints designed between the precast slab connection. (Lebet &amp;amp; Hirt, 2013); (Sétra - 

Service d'études sur les transports, les routes et leurs aménagements, 2010) 

Precast slab units have usually around 2 m long, weighing between 15 and 20 tonnes, 

and “are formed including voids, generally at 1 m centres, to facilitate subsequent creation 

of the steel to concrete connection using studs set out in groups”, as illustrated in Figure

As it can be seen on 2.3.2, the main disadvantage of precast slab construction is 

related to the numerous slab joints between precast elements. There exist two main ways of 

forming the transverse joints: the traditional option and the glued joints (Figure 2-13). The 

traditional joints, known as concreted joints (Figure 2-13 a)), are detailed in such a way that 

they will act as formwork for the joint, provided by reinforcement in order to ensure 

continuity, and to carry the slab shear forces to which the joint is subjected. On other hand,

glued joints are “detailed to include the shear keys (Figure 2-13 b)), which marry up precisely 

with the form of the face of the preceding element”. (Lebet &amp;amp; Hirt, 2013, p.163)

2.4. Advantages of steel-concrete composite bridges 

According to (Vayas &amp;amp; Iliopoulos, 2013, p.13) the advantages of steel-concrete 

composite bridges are mainly connected with safety (S), economy (E), constructional 

simplicity (CS), functionality (F), and aesthetic (A), as follows: 

? Low self-weight of superstructure 

o Cheaper foundations and bearings (E) 

o Lower seismic forces (E, S) 

o Cheaper reconstruction and retrofitting (E) 

? Assembly capability on site 

o Lower transport and lifting costs (E) 

o Flexible site planning (F, E) 

? No propping during construction 

o No traffic interruption (E, F) 

o Elimination of formworks (C, S) 

? Big spans and low construction depth 

o Slender appearance (A) 

o Fewer piers (F) 

? Maximum prefabrication 

o High quality (S) 

o Fewer Cast-in-place activities (CS) 

o High speed of construction (E) 

o Low labour costs (E)

2.5. Structural materials 

As it can be inferred by the above sections, materials play an important role on the 

behaviour of composite structures. In order to give a better understanding of the differences 

between structural steel and concrete, this sub-chapter makes an overall analysis of the 

properties of these two materials, following its most important properties. Thus, the 

following sections begin with the reference to concrete and steel grades typically used in 

bridges, followed by a brief explanation about the symbols used to define the grade 

materials, as well as reference to other relevant characteristics.   

 

2.5.1. Concrete 

Concrete is a material formed of cement, aggregate and water which are used in 

different proportions to obtain the requirement strength (generally, the more cement and less 

water added, the stronger the resulting concrete). Sometimes it may be also possible the use 

of admixtures in concrete composition to change some properties, as to improve workability 

and retard strength gain. (Collings, 2005) 

According to (EN 1994-2, 2005) the composite bridges design should be performed 

to concrete strength classes between C20/25 and C60/75. Also, the most common usual 

strength class of concrete slab is C35/45. (Vayas, Iliopoulos, 2013) 

Some properties of concrete are presented in Table 2-2. 

Specific weight c?  = 25 kN/m
3 

Specific weight of wet concrete wetc,? = 26 kN/m
3 

Poisson ratio for uncracked concrete c?  = 0,2 

Poisson ratio for cracked concrete c?  = 0 

Coefficient of thermal expansion c? = 10 × 10
-6 per ºC 

Table 2-2 - Properties of concrete (Vayas &amp;amp; Iliopoulos, 2013) 

 

2.5.1.1. Strength classes 

For normal concrete, the strength classes are defined by the letter C followed by two 

figures, which express the characteristic (5%) cylinder strength fck and the cubes strength 

fck,cube at 28 days. On its turn, lightweight concrete is denoted as LC followed the two figures 

of cylinder strength and the cube strength. (Vayas &amp;amp; Iliopoulos, 2013) The characteristic 

strengths for fck and the corresponding mechanical characteristics for normal concrete can be

19 

 

found in the  (EN 1992-1-1, 2004) (Table 3.1), while the properties of lightweight concrete 

can be determined according to (EN 1992-1-1, 2004) (chapter 11). 

 

2.5.1.2. Stress-strain relations 

The design value for the compressive stress of concrete is defined as: 

c

ck
cccd

f
f

?
? ??         (2.1) 

Where: 

ck
f  is the characteristic value of the compressive stress;  

cc
?  is a reduction factor that takes into account the long-term effects on the 

compressive strength. The recommended value is 0,85 for unconfined concrete and 

1,0 for confined one; 

c
?  is the relevant safety factor, 

c
? = 1,5 

For the capacity design of composite cross sections, the stress-strain relations of 

Table 2-3, may be used. The parabola-rectangle diagram describes the “exact” behaviour of 

compressed concrete, however, it obviously makes the calculations more onerous. On the 

other hand, the bilinear diagram offers a more simplified approach. (Vayas &amp;amp; Iliopoulos, 

2013)

2.5.1.3. Creep and shrinkage of concrete 

Concrete is subject to time-dependent deformations, due to creep and shrinkage, 

which in turn, “depend on the ambient humidity, the dimensions of the element and the 



Design of Composite Steel and Concrete Bridges 

20 

 

composition of the concrete. Creep is also influenced by the maturity of the concrete when 

the load is first applied and depends on the duration and magnitude of the loading”. (EN 

1992-1-1, 2004, p.37) The value of the creep coefficient and the total shrinkage may be 

determined from (EN 1992-1-1, 2004) (Chapter 3.1.4).  

 

2.5.2. Steel  

Steel used for building bridges and structures is a material that contains: iron, a small 

percentage of carbon and manganese, impurities that cannot be fully removed from the ore 

(namely sulphur and phosphorus), as well as some alloying elements that are added in very 

small quantities to improve the properties of the finished product (namely copper, silicon, 

nickel, chromium, molybdenum, vanadium and zirconium). (Chatterjee, 2003)   

The most usual steel grade for structural members of bridges such as main beams is 

S355, delivered in a normalized state. “It is designated S335J2 + N or S355K2 + N for non-

alloyed steels (EN 10025-2), and S355N or S355NL for fine grain steels (EN 10025-3). 

When thermomechanical steels are used, they are designated S355M or S355ML (EN 10025-

4)”. (Lebet,  Hirt, 2013, p.66)  

In some situations, “higher strength steels (S460) are of interest in highly stressed 

regions of continuous beams, such as over intermediate supports”. On other hand, “steel 

grades inferior to S355 are not used in the construction of bridges, except perhaps for 

secondary elements that are only lightly stressed”. (Lebet,  Hirt, 2013, p.66)  

   Some properties of structural steel are presented in Table 2-4. 

Specific weight a?  = 78,5 kN/m
3 

Modulus of elasticity aE  = 210 GPa 

Poisson ratio c?  = 0,3 

Shear modulus aG = 81 GPa 

Coefficient of thermal expansion c? = 10 × 10
-6 per ºC 

Table 2-4 - Properties of Structural Steel (Vayas &amp;amp; Iliopoulos, 2013) 

Structural steels used in bridges are particularly characterised by a grade (defined by 

the yield strength) and a quality (characterised by the resistance of the steel to bending 

impact as an indicator of the resistance to brittle fracture and to some degree the quality may 

also give an indicator of the weldability of steel).

21 

 

2.5.2.1. Steel grade 

    Steel grades are defined by a system based in the European Standard EN 10025. 

According to this system, structural steel is designated by the letter S (initial for the English 

word Structural steel), followed by a number providing its yield strength (fy) at thickness t 

?16 mm in [MPa] and one or two symbols specifying the material toughness. (Vayas &amp;amp; 

Iliopoulos, 2013) 

“The mechanical properties of structural steels are mainly characterized by the yield 

and the tensile strength that are defined in Eurocodes 3 and 4 as fy and fu correspondingly”. 

(Vayas &amp;amp; Iliopoulos, 2013, p.172)  

The design rules of the Eurocode 4 Part 2 (EN 1994-2, 2005) only covers steel grades 

inferior or equivalent to S460, such as S235, S275, S355, S420 and S460. However, the use 

of steel grades above S460, up to S700, are also available. The last ones, are covered by EN 

1993-1-12. (Steel Bridge Group, 2010)  

Table 2-5 shows the mechanical properties of structural steels as a function of 

nominal thickness of the element and grade of steel, produced to EN 10025, in accordance 

with (EN 1993-1-1, 2005).

2.5.2.2. Steel quality 

According to (Lebet &amp;amp; Hirt, 2013, p. 63), “the notion of steel quality is used to define 

the particularities of the material's resistance to bending by impact of a test specimen 

containing a notch (Charpy test), which is an indication of its resistance to brittle fracture”.  

 

Figure 2-14 - Charpy test (Vayas &amp;amp; Iliopoulos, 2013) 

As it can be seen in Figure 2-14, the Charpy test is carried out with a specimen at a 

specified (low) temperature, and measures the impact energy (in Joules) required to break a 

small notched specimen by a single impact blow from a pendulum. (Steel Bridge Group, 

2010)  

For each types of steel (non-alloy, normalized or thermomechanically treated), 

Standards EN 10025 in Parts 2 to 4, describes the qualities of steel as shown in Table 2-6.

2.5.2.3. Weldability 

Weldability is a characteristic of steel that indicates the aptitude of the metal to be 

welded to another piece via an intermediary metal (electrode). This characteristic cannot be 

quantified, for this reason, is rather based on a qualitative judgement. (Lebet &amp;amp; Hirt, 2013)  

As stated by (Steel Bridge Group, 2010, p.4), welding leads to a local heating of the 

steel, which subsequently cools. On its turn, the cooling can be quite fast, because the 

surrounding material that offers a large energy dissipation, as well as due to the weld (the 

heat introduced), which is usually relatively small. This situation can lead to hardening of 

the ‘heat affected zone’ (HAZ) and to reduced toughness. “The greater the thickness of 

material, the greater the reduction of toughness, because of the greater thermal conduction”.  

Weldability also depends on the chemical composition. “Increased amounts of 

carbon and manganese, which are necessary for higher strengths, make the steel harder and 

consequently more difficult to weld”. For the purpose of measuring weldability of a metal, 

its ‘carbon equivalent value’ is given as an indicative measure. The ‘carbon equivalent value’ 

is given by the following formula: 

    
1556

CuNiVMoCrMn
C

?
?

??
??       (2.2) 

 Where C, Mn, etc. represent the percentage of the elements in the chemical composition 

of the steel. (Chatterjee, 2003, p.44) 

Preheating (by blowtorch or combined series of torches) is always needed for steel 

grades S355 and above. The only exception are the thermomechanical steels, which due to 

their low carbon equivalent, do not need preheating. (Lebet &amp;amp; Hirt, 2013)  

 

2.5.2.4. Thermomechanical Rolled Steels 

Thermomechanical steels differ from traditional normalised steels, since for the same 

mechanical properties, they require less carbon and other hardening elements (lower carbon 

equivalent value), and for the same chemical composition, they have superior mechanical 

properties. (Lebet &amp;amp; Hirt, 2013)

2.5.2.5. Corrosion resistance 

According to (Collings, 2005, p.68), “the corrosion of steel is defined as an 

electromechanical process, where the steel in presence of oxygen and water converts to a 

hydrated ferric oxide, or rust”. In order to protect the steel structure of composite bridges 

against corrosion, it is common to provide a protection by painting, as well as the use of 

steels with improved anti-corrosion characteristics, known as weathering steels. 

 

? Protection by painting 

Protection by paint is the most frequently form used to protect steel against the 

corrosion. Paint systems used to protect steel consists of three basic stages: a base layer, an 

intermediate layer (may be one thick coating or several thinner layers) and a finishing layer. 

(Lebet &amp;amp; Hirt, 2013); (Collings, 2005) Table 2-7, summarize some common protective 

systems for highway and railway structures.

? Weathering steels 

Weathering steels are a low alloy steel (P, Cu, Cr, Ni, Mo), which present a good 

resistance to atmospheric corrosion. “This improved resistance to corrosion is due to the 

formation of a compact self-protective oxide film or ‘patina’ on the surface of the material”. 

(Lebet &amp;amp; Hirt, 2013, p.68)

The rust layers develops very 

quickly once the material is exposed to 

the atmosphere (Figure 2-15). While the 

rust layers formed on most ordinary 

structural steels are porous and detach 

from the metal surface after a certain 

time, for weathering steels, the rusting 

process is initiated in the same way, but 

the specific alloying elements in the steel  

 
Figure 2-15 - Schematic comparison between the 

corrosion loss of weathering steel and ordinary 

structural steel (Steel Contruction.info) 

produce a stable rust layer that adheres to the base metal, and is much less porous. 

(Steel Contruction.info);  (Lebet &amp;amp; Hirt, 2013) 

The main reasons for use of weathering steels in bridges design are related to: 

reduced first costs (saves painting costs and saves construction time) and reduced 

maintenance (no need to repaint, reduces traffic delays during maintenance, not as dependent 

on weather conditions, and reduces need for access). (Steel Bridge Group, 2010)  

   However, the experience gained from existing bridges, has shown that the use of 

weathering steels is not suitable for the following environments: (Steel Bridge Group, 2010); 

(Lebet &amp;amp; Hirt, 2013)  

o Where there is an atmosphere of concentrated corrosive or industrial fumes; 

o Where steelwork is continuously wet or damp; 

o Where steel is exposed to high concentrations of chloride ions or salt spray; 

o Where steelwork is located less than 500 m from the sea; 

o Where steel is less than 1 m above ground level (vegetation) or less than 3 m 

above a river.

Chapter 3 

Design of steel – concrete composite bridges 

 

3. Design of steel-concrete composite bridges 
The designing of a composite bridge is a complex and long process, starting with the 

consideration of an appropriate design criterion in accordance with (EN 1990, 2002), 

followed by a definition and combination of actions in accordance with (EN 1991, 2001) 

and (EN 1990, 2002), respectively, and a determination of resistances, durability and 

serviceability in accordance with (EN 1994-2, 2005).  

The calculation of the whole bridge in order to determine the internal forces and 

moments, as well as the corresponding stresses on its various sections is based on a structural 

model, which shall reflect the anticipated behaviour of the cross section, members, joints, 

and bearings. Eurocode 3, part 2 (EN 1993-2, 2006), recommends the use of elastic global 

analysis, except possibly on accidental design situations, however, (EN 1994-2, 2005) does 

not exclude the use of plastic global analysis at the ultimate limit state. (Composite highway 

bridge design, 2010) According to (EN 1994-2, 2005), the methods of global analysis should 

be taking into account the effect of shear lag, as well as the effect of local buckling. 

Furthermore, for a linear elastic analysis, appropriate allowance should be made for the 

effects of cracking on concrete, creep and shrinkage of concrete and sequence of 

construction. Taking this into account, the following sections provide a brief description of 

this process, as well as the standards used in the design of composite bridges. 

 

 

3.1. The Eurocodes and product standards 

Considering the importance of standards for a civil engineering designer, a set of 

structural design standards, commonly known as Eurocodes were developed by CEN 

(European Committee for Standardization) over the last 30 years, to cover the design of all 

types of structures in steel, concrete, timber, masonry and aluminium. (Composite highway 

bridge design, 2010) 

There are 10 Eurocodes, starting at Eurocode 0 till Eurocode 9. The connection 

between Eurocodes in relation to bridges is created by EN 199X-2 (Part 2). “Consequently, 

the leading document for the design of composite bridges is Eurocode 4, part 2 (EN1994-2). 



Design of Composite Steel and Concrete Bridges 

 

28 

 

However, since composite construction combines the use of both structural steel and 

reinforced concrete, EN 1994 calls, besides the generic Eurocodes, both relevant material 

Eurocodes, EN 1992 and EN 1993”. (Vayas, Iliopoulos, 2013, p.67) In order to briefly 

summarize it, Figure 3-1 depicts a schematic representation of the Eurocodes to be used in 

the composite bridge designing.  

 
Figure 3-1 Eurocodes to be used in a composite bridge design (COMBRI Design Manual, 2008) 

 

 Standards of the products used in composite bridges are presented in Table 3-1.

Table 3-1 - Product standards 

 

3.2. Limit state design 

The intended life for bridges is circa 100 years. During this span, bridges need to 

guarantee certain basic requirements related to structural resistance, serviceability and 

durability. According to (EN 1990, 2002), these requirements are based on consideration 

about ultimate and serviceability limit states. (Vayas, Iliopoulos, 2013) 

Ultimate limit states (ULSs) are related whit the safety of people, as well as of the 

structure, and for composite bridges may be due to: (Vayas, Iliopoulos, 2013)

29 

 

? EQU: Loss of static equilibrium of the structure or a structural element 

? STR: Failure by collapse or excessive deformation of a structure or structural element 

? GEO: Failure or excessive deformation of the ground where the strengths of soil or 

rock are significant in providing resistance 

? FAT: Failure caused by fatigue of the structural elements 

Serviceability limit states (SLSs) concern the functioning of the structure or 

structural members under normal use, the comfort of people and the appearance of the 

construction work, which are related with: (Vayas, Iliopoulos, 2013)  

? Stresses; 

? Deformations; 

? Cracking of concrete.  

 

3.3. Actions 

Actions are classified according to (EN 1990, 2002) in relation to their duration, 

magnitude, and probability of occurrence as: (Vayas, Iliopoulos, 2013) 

? Permanent (G), e.g. self-weight of structural members, fixed equipment and road 

surfacing, and indirect actions caused by shrinkage and uneven settlements; 

? Variable (Q), e.g. traffic loads, wind loads, and snow loads; 

?  Accidental (A), e.g. vehicle impact; 

? Seismic (AE), which develops during an earthquake ground motion.     

As it can be noted by Figure 3-1, the different types of actions are defined by (EN 

1991, 2001), except for seismic action which is covered by (EN 1998-1, 2004) and (EN 

1998-2, 2011). Given the fact that explanation of all actions is long, and tanking in to account 

the aim of this work, only traffic loads have been detailed on the following. However, on 

Chapter 4 a brief description about the determination of all actions considered for the global 

analysis of the numerical example is given. 

 

3.3.1. Traffic load 

Traffic loads correspond to the most relevant actions to take into account for bridge 

designing, which are determined in accordance to (EN 1991-2, 2003). Bearing in mind the 

purpose of this thesis, the methodology used to perform the traffic load actions for road 

bridges is described below. However, depending on the use of the bridge (roadway bridge, 



Design of Composite Steel and Concrete Bridges 

 

30 

 

railway, pedestrian or a combination of these), different traffic loads should be considered. 

Thus, the following guidelines begin with reference to the division of carriageway into 

notional lanes, followed by a brief explanation about determination of vertical and horizontal 

forces applied on the carriageway, as well as on footways and cycle tracks, until definition 

of groups of traffic loads on road bridges. 

 

3.3.1.1. Division of carriageway into notional lanes 

The first step in order to taken into account traffic loads when designing a bridge is 

to define the number of notional lanes on the carriageway, according to (EN 1991-2, 2003) 

(4.2.3). 

The number of notional lanes 

depends on the carriageway width (w), 

which should be measured between kerbs 

or between the inner limits of vehicle 

restraint systems (Figure 3-2), and should 

not include the distance between fixed 

vehicle restraint systems or kerbs of a 

central reservation nor the widths of these 

vehicle restraint systems. 

 

Figure 3-2- Example of lane numbering (Vayas &amp;amp; 

Iliopoulos, 2013) 

Taking this into consideration, the number and width of notional lanes are determined 

in accordance with Table 3-2.

     The lane giving the most unfavourable effects is numbered Lane Number 1, followed 

by the second most unfavourable effect, which is numbered Lane Number2, etc. As traffic 

loads are variable actions, they are placed in such a way that the most adverse effects are 

obtained.

3.3.1.2. Vertical loads on the carriageway 

For vertical forces due to traffic loads, there are four models to considerer: Load 

Model 1 (normal traffic), Load Model 2 (Single axle for short span members), Load Model 

3 (Special vehicles) and Load Model 4 (Crowd loading). However, these Load Models apply 

for loaded lengths less than 200 m. For greater loaded lengths, the load model may be defined 

in the National Annex. Taking this into account, on the following, a brief description of these 

four Load Models is presented. 

 

? Load Model 1 (LM1) 

Load Model 1 is a model used for general and local verifications, which cover most 

of the effects of the traffic of lorries and cars. It comprises a double-axle concentrated loads 

(tandem system (TS)) whit ?Qi?Qik per axle, and a uniformly distributed loads (UDL) whit 

?Qi?qik, determined in accordance to Table 3-3.

? Load Model 2 (LM2) 

Load model 2 consists in a single axle model, which is applied when a local 

verification for short structural elements (e.g. crossbeams, upper flange stiffeners of 

orthotropic decks, or deck panels of composite slabs with profile steel sheeting) is necessary. 

The magnitude of this single axle model may be defined in the National Annex, however 

(EN 1991-2, 2003) recommends that ?Q?Qak = ?Q1?Qak is equal to 400 kN. In order to brief 

summarize it, Figure 3-3 depicts a schematic representation of Load model 2 application. 

(Vayas &amp;amp; Iliopoulos, 2013) 

 

Figure 3-3 - Application of the Load model 2 (Vayas &amp;amp; Iliopoulos, 2013) 

 

? Load Model 3 (LM3) 

Load Model 3 is a model used for bridges that must be designed against special traffic 

loads, which is the case of bridges that may experience a military use during their lifetime. 

The standardized models of special vehicles, as well as their conditions of use may be 

defined in accordance with National Annex of (EN 1991-2, 2003).   

   

? Load Model 4 (LM4) 

Load model 4, commonly known as crowd loading is represented by a Load model 

consisting of a uniformly distributed load (which includes dynamic simplification) equal to 

5 kN/m2. Furthermore, load model 4 should be applied on the relevant parts of the length 

and width of the road bridge deck (the central reservation being included where relevant), 

and it should be associated only with a transient design situation.

3.3.1.3. Vertical loads on footways and cycle tracks 

Vertical loads on footways and cycle tracks are represented by a uniform distributed 

load (UDL) equal to 5 kN/m2 that acts on the unfavourable parts of the influence line in 

longitudinal and transverse directions. (Vayas &amp;amp; Iliopoulos, 2013) 

 

3.3.1.4. Horizontal forces 

The horizontal forces due to traffic loads, are defined in accordance with (EN 1991-

2, 2003) (4.4), in order to represent braking / acceleration and centrifugal forces. 

 

? Braking force 

The braking force is taken as a force that acts at the surfacing level of the 

carriageway, which in turn is transferred to the expansion joints, the bearings, and the 

superstructure. (Vayas &amp;amp; Iliopoulos, 2013) 

The characteristic value of the braking force Qlk for the total width of the carriageway 

(limited to 900 kN for the total width of the bridge), is calculated according to (EN 1991-2, 

2003) (4.4.1 (2)), as follows: 

? ? LwqQQ

   With: 

 kNQkN
kQ

900180

????        (3.2) 

 

? Acceleration force 

Acceleration forces are of the same magnitude as the braking forces but act in 

opposite direction, which means that both types of forces are considered as +/- Q1k. (Vayas 

&amp;amp; Iliopoulos, 2013)  

 

? Centrifugal force 

According to (Vayas &amp;amp; Iliopoulos, 2013, p. 81), “the centrifugal force is a transverse 

force that acts at the level of the finished carriageway level and radially to the carriageway 

axis”. The characteristic value of Qtk, in which dynamic effects are included, should be taken 

from Table 3-4.

Qtk = 0,2Qv (kN) if r &amp;lt;200 m 

Qtk = 40Qv / r (kN) if 200 ? r ? 1500 m 

Qtk = 0 if r &gt; 1500 m 

  

Table 3-4 - Characteristic values of centrifugal forces (Vayas &amp;amp; Iliopoulos, 2013) 

  

3.3.1.5. Groups of traffic loads on road bridges 

As it can be seen by the above sections, the traffic loads include vertical and 

horizontal forces on the carriageway and on footways. Since the probability of those loads 

appear simultaneously with their characteristic values is small, groups of loads are 

considered. “A group of load is treated as a single variable and thus may be considered as 

the leading action, Qk,1, or as an accompanying action”. (Composite highway bridge design, 

2010, p. 45) The groups of loads are defined according to (EN 1991-2, 2003) (4.5), as shown 

in Table 3-5.

3.4. Combination of actions 

The design values of the effects are determined for the combinations of actions that 

are considered to occur simultaneously. (EN 1990, 2002) “In the basic combination, one 

variable action is considered as leading variable action, the others being accompanying 

actions”. (Vayas &amp;amp; Iliopoulos, 2013, p. 124) The combination of action at ULS and SLS are 

presented on the following sections.

3.4.1. Ultimate Limit States (ULS) 

At the ultimate limit state it must be verified that the design value of the effect of 

actions does not exceed the design value of the corresponding resistance. (Composite 

highway bridge design, 2010) According to (EN 1990, 2002) the following combinations 

should be considered:

3.5. Structural analysis of composite bridges 

As it was referred, the structural analysis of composite bridges is based on a model 

calculation that is performed to give the real behaviour of the structure, taking into account 

the effects of shear lag and cracking of concrete, as well as the effects of creep and shrinkage, 

and the staged construction. Thus, an explanation about this effects, is described on the 

following sections.     

   

3.5.1. Effect of shear lag 

The verification of cross-section should be determined taking into account the 

distribution of effective width between supports and mid span regions, due to non-uniform 

distribution of stresses over the total width of the slab, as a result of an effect known as shear 

lag (Figure 3-4).  



Design of Composite Steel and Concrete Bridges 

 

38 

 

 

Figure 3-4 - Length Le and distribution of effective width of concrete along the span (Vayas &amp;amp; Iliopoulos, 

2013) 

The effective width beff, at mid span or an internal support, as well as at an end 

support, may be defined by (EN 1994-2, 2005) (Chapter 5.4.1.2). At mid-span or internal 

support, it is determined by the following: 

   ??? eieff bbb 0          (3.9) 

Where: 

0
b  is the distance between the centres of outstand shear connectors; 

ei
b  is the value of the effective width of the concrete flange on each side of the web 

and taken as Le/8 (but not greater than the geometric width bi 

e
L  may be assumed to be as shown in Figure 3-4. 

 

On its turn, at an end support may be determined by:

3.5.2. Local buckling and cross-section classification 

The plate elements of the cross-sections of a composite bridge are typically slender, 

which may leads to the development of a local instability phenomena, known as local 

buckling. This phenomena may be taken into account by classifying cross-sections of 

elements. (Lebet, Hirt, 2013) 

On its turn, the classification of cross-section aims to examine whether the bending 

resistance of cross-section may be determined by elastic or plastic resistance. This 



3 - Design of steel-concrete composite bridges  

39 

 

classification is defined according to the highest (least favourable) class of its compression 

parts, as described in detail in (EN 1994-2, 2005) (Chapter 5.5). 

According to (Vayas &amp;amp; Iliopoulos, 2013), four classes of cross-sections (Figure 3-5) 

are defined, as follows: 

? Class 1: Cross-sections develop their plastic bending resistance and have sufficient 

rotation capacity; 

? Class 2: Cross-sections develop their plastic bending resistance but limited rotation 

capacity; 

? Class 3: Cross-sections develop their elastic bending resistance; 

? Class 4: Cross-sections are subjected to local buckling and have a resistance lower 

than the elastic resistance. 

 
Figure 3-5 - Classes of cross sections (Vayas &amp;amp; Iliopoulos, 2013) 

Furthermore, (EN 1993-1-1, 2005) adds that cross sections with class 1 or 2 flanges 

and class 3 web may be classified as class 2, when the web is represented by an effective 

web, in accordance with Figure 3-6. 

 

Figure 3-6 - Effective class 2 web that was initially class 3 (Vayas &amp;amp; Iliopoulos, 2013)

3.5.3. Effect of cracking of concrete 

Cracking of concrete, in the negative moment regions should be taken into account 

when the tensile stresses are higher than the concrete’s tensile strength (fctm). Standard (EN 

1994-2, 2005), proposes two methods to considerer the effect of cracking of concrete: “one 

is that first an un-cracked analysis may be carried out and the extent of concrete determined 

(when the concrete tensile stress exceeds a certain value), followed by another analysis 

cracked section properties in these regions; the second allows a simpler one-stage method”. 

(Composite higway bridge design, 2014, p.37) The first method, called as “un-cracked 

analysis” and the second method known as “simplified method” should be determined in 

accordance with (EN 1994-2, 2005) (Chapter 5.4.2.3). 

The simplified method may be 

used, when the ratio of the length of 

adjacent continuous spans (shorter/ 

longer) is greater than 0,6. It is a method 

in which the cracked flexural stiffness 

Ea.I2 is used over 15% of the span on each 

side of each internal support and the 

uncracked values Ea.I1 elsewhere. (Figure 

3-7) 
 

Figure 3-7 - Simplified method principle (Lebet 

&amp;amp; Hirt, 2013) 

 

3.5.4. Effects of creep and shrinkage 

The effects of creep are taken into account by determining an appropriate modular 

ratio for long-term effects. This modular ratio for creep is given by (EN 1994-2, 2005) 

(5.4.2.2(2)), which requires a creep coefficient according to (EN 1992-1-1, 2004) (Chapter 

3.1.4). Thus, the modular ratios depending on the type of loading are given by: 

    ? ?tLL nn ???? 10         (3.12) 

Where: 

0
n  is the modular ratio Ea/Ecm for short-term loading; 

Ecm is the secant modulus of elasticity of the concrete for short-term loading according 

to (EN 1992-1-1, 2004) (Table 3.1 or 11.3.1) 

t
?  is the creep coefficient ? ?0, tt?  according to (EN 1992-1-1, 2004) (3.1.4 or 11.3.3) 



3 - Design of steel-concrete composite bridges  

41 

 

L
?  is the creep multiplier depending on the type of loading, which can be taken as 1,1 

for permanent loads, 0,55 for primary effects of shrinkage and 1,5 for prestressing 

by imposed deformations. 

On the other hand, the shrinkage strains is given by (EN 1992-1-1, 2004) (Annex 

B.2) and the modular ratio for shrinkage is given by (EN 1994-2, 2005) (Chapter 5.4.2.2(2)). 

 

3.5.5. Stages and sequence of construction 

(EN 1994-2, 2005) (Chapter 5.4.2.4), states that appropriate analysis should be made 

to cover the effects of staged construction, including where necessary separate effects of 

actions applied to structural steel and to wholly or partially composite members. However, 

adds that these effects may be neglected in analysis for ultimate limit states other than 

fatigue, for composite members where all cross-sections are in class 1 or 2 and in which no 

allowance for lateral buckling is needed. 

 

3.6. Verification by Ultimate Limit States 

In order to carry out a check according to (EN 1994-2, 2005) (6.1.1), the following 

parameters should be taken into account: 

? Resistance of cross-sections; 

? Resistance to lateral-torsional buckling; 

? Resistance to shear buckling and in-plane forces applied to webs; 

? Resistance to longitudinal shear; 

? Resistance to fatigue. 

 

3.6.1. Resistance of cross-sections 

As it was already explained, depending on the classification of cross-section, the 

resistance of a composite cross-section may be determined either by using a plastic resistance 

model or an elastic resistance model.  The resistance of cross sections of beams is described 

in detail in (EN 1994-2, 2005), where the (Clause 6.2.1.2) gives information related to the 

calculation of plastic resistance moment, and the (clause 6.2.1.5) gives information related 

to the elastic resistance to bending. 

 

 



Design of Composite Steel and Concrete Bridges 

 

42 

 

3.6.1.1. Plastic resistance moment of a composite cross-section 

The calculation of plastic resistance moment is performed in accordance with Figure 

3-8, taking into account the following assumptions: 

? There is full interaction between structural steel, reinforcement, and concrete; 

? The effective area of the structural steel member is stressed  to its design yield 

strength fyd in tension or compression; 

? The effective areas of longitudinal reinforcement in tension and in compression are 

stressed to their design yield strength fsd in tension or compression. Alternatively, 

reinforcement in compression in a concrete slab may be neglected; 

? The effective area of concrete in compression resists a stress of 0,85fcd (constant over 

the whole depth between the plastic neutral axis and the most compressed fibre of 

the concrete, where fcd is the design cylinder compressive strength of concrete). 

 

Figure 3-8 - Examples of plastic stress distributions for a composite beam with a solid slab and full shear 

connection in sagging and hogging bending (EN 1994-2, 2005) 

 

3.6.1.2. Elastic resistance moment of a composite cross-section 

The total stresses and strains of a composite cross-section that behaves essentially in 

an elastic manner, are determined by summation of the stress distributions for the bending 

moments at each stage of construction. Figure 3-9 shows diagrammatically this summation 

process, where some bending is carried on the bare steel beam, some is carried on a beam 

with long-term section properties (e.g. surfacing, mechanical components, etc.), and some is 

carried on a beam with short-term section properties (e.g. traffic loads and temperature). 

(Composite highway bridge design, 2010)  



3 - Design of steel-concrete composite bridges  

43 

 

 
Figure 3-9 - Summation of stresses acting on different resisting cross sections (Composite highway bridge 

design, 2010) 

Taking the aforementioned considerations, the elastic bending resistance can be 

determined using the following expression:   

EdcEdaRdEl
MkMM

,,,
???        (3.13) 

Where: 

Eda
M

,
 is the design bending moment applied to structural steel section before composite 

behaviour; 

Edc
M

,
 is the part of the design bending moment acting on the composite section; 

k  is an amplifying factor that just causes the stress limit (determined using 
1M

?  for 

steel strength) to be reached in either the structural steel section of the 

reinforcement (whichever occurs first) 

 

3.6.2. Resistance to lateral-torsional buckling 

In a composite beam, the only regions of the main girders that are potentially 

susceptible to buckling are the bottom flanges where they are in compression (in regions 

adjacent to intermediate supports of continuous spans and adjacent to end supports). The 

steel top flanges are not susceptible to lateral buckling, because the concrete slab provides 

lateral restraint to the steel member. (Composite highway bridge design, 2010)  

According to continuous U-frame model (Figure 3-10) from (EN 1994-2, 2005) 

(6.4.2), for beams with a uniform cross-section in class 1, 2, or 3, the design buckling 

resistance moment of a composite section can be expressed as:  

RdLTRdb
MM ?? ?

,
        (3.14) 

In eq. (3.14), 
LT

?  is the reduction factor for lateral-torsional buckling corresponding 

to the relative slenderness determined by (EN 1994-2, 2005) (6.4.2 (4)), which in turn, 

depends of the elastic critical moment. This elastic critical moment (
cr

M ) is neither in EN 



Design of Composite Steel and Concrete Bridges 

 

44 

 

1993 nor in EN 1994, therefore, it must be determined either by an elastic buckling analysis 

or by reference to other sources. However, for hogging regions of composite bridges it is 

difficult to find suitable theoretical models that will give realistic values of 
cr

M . 

Additionally, (EN 1994-2, 2005) (Chapter 6.4.2) refers to (EN 1993-2, 2006) (Chapter 

6.3.4), which does provide two general methods to determine the relative slenderness, one 

called ‘general method’ and one called ‘simplified method’. (Composite highway bridge 

design, 2010) 

 
Figure 3-10 - U-frame model (EN 1994-2, 2005) 

 

3.6.2.1. General method 

The general method may be applicable to both lateral and lateral torsional buckling. 

The first step is to calculate an amplifier (?ult,k) of the design loads to reach the characteristic 

resistance of the most critical section neglecting any out-of-plane effects (second order 

bending moments should be included), followed by calculation of an amplifier of the in-

plane design loads (?crit) to reach the fundamental buckling mode for lateral or lateral 

torsional buckling. In order to obtain the critical load factor (?crit), a 3D model should be 

used. (Vayas &amp;amp; Iliopoulos, 2013) 

The non-dimensional slenderness is then given by:

 On its turn, the reduction factor ?op is determined using the buckling curves of (EN 

1993-1-1, 2005) (6.3.1.2). Thus, the final step corresponds to the buckling verification, 

which may be written as:

3.6.2.2. Simplified method 

The simplified method is valid only to verify the resistance to lateral torsional 

buckling of a compression flange and not for lateral buckling of full systems. It uses a Tee 

section comprising the bottom flange and one-third of the compression zone of the web 

(Figure 3-11), and treats it as a compression member subjected to out-of-plane flexural 

buckling.    

 

Figure 3-11 - Modelling of the compression flange as a T-section column on rigid supports (Vayas &amp;amp; 

Iliopoulos, 2013) 

The steps to follow according to simplified method are listed on the following 

guidelines. In addition, Chapter 4 gives a detailed explanation of these steps. 

? Calculation of  Ncrit, according to (EN 1993-2, 2006) (6.3.4.2 (6)) for the Tee section 

at the more highly stressed end of the length L between rigid restraints; 

? Calculation of the restraint flexibility Cd for each intermediate restraint (EN 1993-2, 

2006) (Annex D); 

? Calculation of slenderness parameter 
L T

?  using equation 6.10 of (EN 1993-2, 2006) 

(6.3.4.2);  

? Calculation of reduction factor for lateral torsional buckling ?LT (EN 1993-1-1, 2005) 

(6.3.2.3); 

? Verification of resistance to lateral torsional buckling. 

 

3.6.3. Resistance to shear buckling and in-plane forces applied to webs 

The webs of plate girders are usually slender, which makes them more susceptible to 

buckling under the effects of shear. In order to understand the behaviour of a panel in shear, 

there are two important phases to be known: (Lebet, Hirt, 2013) 



Design of Composite Steel and Concrete Bridges 

 

46 

 

? Pre-buckling behaviour, where the state of the in-plane stresses is a combination of 

tension and compression of equal intensity, which means that exists diagonals in 

tension and compression at 45º relative to the edges for a square panel (Figure 3-12 

(a)); 

? Post-buckling behaviour, where the compression stresses will lead to the local 

buckling of the panel (Figure 3-12 (b)). This buckling occurs whenever the state in-

plane stresses are bigger than the critical shear stresses.    

 
Figure 3-12 - Buckling of a panel in shear (Lebet &amp;amp; Hirt, 2013) 

 According to (EN 1993-1-5, 2006), the resistance to shear buckling of a plate girder 

should be checked when:

Whenever it is necessary to check the shear resistance of webs, it should be 

determined according to (EN 1993-1-5, 2006). The rules presented on this standard leads to 

a long process that involves several variables and conditions. Taking this into account, a 

summary of the sequence considered for the resistance to shear buckling and in-plane forces 

applied to webs and respective reference in (EN1993-1-5) is listed on the following:    

? Resistance to shear, from (EN 1993-1-5, 2006), (chapter 5); 

? Resistance to transverse forces, from (EN 1993-1-5, 2006), (chapter 6); 

? Interaction M-V, from (EN 1993-1-5, 2006), (chapter 7); 

? Flange induced buckling, from (EN 1993-1-5, 2006), (chapter 8).

3.6.4. Resistance to longitudinal shear 

The longitudinal shear at the concrete-steel interface is the means by which the loads 

are transferred from the girder into the slab. The longitudinal shear resistance is achieved by 

shear connectors, which are required on the top flanges of the girders, to provide the required 

transfer of composite action between the steel girder and concrete slab. (Composite highway 

bridge design, 2010) On the following, a brief description related to the design process of 

shear connectors, and the determination of longitudinal shear is presented. 

 

3.6.4.1. Shear connectors 

The design process of shear 

connectors is determined according to 

(EN 1994-2, 2005) (6.6.3.1), and 

consists of deriving the value of the 

longitudinal shear and the verification 

of the connectors, and of the resistance 

of the slab adjacent to the connectors. 

(Composite highway bridge design, 

2010) Thus, the design value of the 

shear resistance may be defined by the 

following equation:

the dimension specific to these devices. Taking into consideration the procedure described 

on the above lines, Table 3-10 gives a synthesis of the design value of the shear resistance 

of headed studs with hsc/d ? 4 in solid slabs at ultimate limit states.

Iliopoulos, 2013) 

  

3.6.4.2. Longitudinal shear for elastic behaviour 

Where a uniform composite section is designed elastically, the longitudinal shear 

force may be determined from the simple relationship of mechanics:  

I

SV
V Ed

EdL

?
?

,         (3.22) 

Where: 

VEd is the design vertical shear force; 

S is the static moment of the concrete slab in respect to the centre of gravity of the 

composite section; 

I is the second moment of area of the composite section. 

According to (Composite highway bridge design, 2010, p.65), “In hogging moment 

regions, where the slab is in tension, longitudinal shear may be calculated using uncracked 

section properties; this give a safe value without the need for more complex calculation, even 

when the plastic resistance of the cracked section is relied upon. Short therm uncracked 

properties may be used for this purpose”. 

 

3.6.4.3. Longitudinal shear for plastic behaviour 

As indicated above, the Equation 3.22 is valid for elastic behaviour. However, at ULS 

and for cross sections of class 1 and 2, it is possible to exploit the plastic bending resistance 

(Figure 3-14), and then a slightly more complex evaluation is needed. (Vayas &amp;amp; Iliopoulos, 

2013) 



3 - Design of steel-concrete composite bridges  

49 

 

 

Figure 3-14 - Longitudinal shear in inelastic regions (Vayas &amp;amp; Iliopoulos, 2013) 

Plastic behaviour is reached for regions where the design moment is larger than the 

elastic moment resistance, which is determined by consideration of the construction stages, 

as indicated on section 3.6.1.2. (Vayas &amp;amp; Iliopoulos, 2013) In such case, the design shear is 

then determined in accordance with (EN 1994-2, 2005) (6.6.2.2). 

 

3.6.4.4. Longitudinal shear due to concentrated forces 

Additionally, it is necessary to consider a more complex evaluation if there is a 

concentrated introduction of shear force, which can be due to a change of cross section, or 

where temperature and shrinkage effects (Figure 3-15) are introduced at the end of a beam. 

(Composite highway bridge design, 2010)  

 

Figure 3-15 - Distribution of end shear due to shrinkage at an edge support (Vayas &amp;amp; Iliopoulos, 2013) 

 So, in this case, the shear flow (shear force per unit length) due to a concentrated 

introduction of force is approximated by a triangular distribution (Figure 3-15) whit a 

maximum value given by:

3.6.4.5. Longitudinal shear in concrete slabs 

The slab must also be checked in order to verify its ability to transfer the longitudinal 

shear transmitted from the girder by shear connectors, on the potential failure surfaces 

(Figure 3-16). (Composite highway bridge design, 2014) The resistance to longitudinal shear 

in concrete slab should be determined in accordance with (EN 1994-2, 2005) (Chapter 6.6.6). 

 
Figure 3-16- Failure mechanism and typical sections for checking shear failure (Vayas &amp;amp; Iliopoulos, 2013) 

 

3.6.5. Resistance to fatigue 

As defined by (Vayas, Iliopoulos, 2013, p.441): “Fatigue is a process in which 

damage is accumulated in the materials undergoing fluctuating loading”. According to (EN 

1994-2, 2005) (Chapter 6.8.1), the resistance of composite structures to fatigue shall be 

verified where the structures are subjected to repeated fluctuations of stresses. This 

phenomenon is more likely to take place at regions of stress concentration such as rapid 

changes of cross sections, at section reductions due to bolted connections or in welding 

regions, where the material undergoes metallurgic changes. (Vayas, Iliopoulos, 2013) 

Resistance to fatigue is covered generally in both (EN 1993-2, 2006) and (EN 1994-

2, 2005), and detailed rules are given in: (Composite highway bridge design, 2010) 

? (EN 1993-1-9, 2005), for structural steel;  

? (EN 1992-1-1, 2004), for reinforcing steel; 

? (EN 1994-2, 2005) (Chapter 6.8.7.2), for stud connectors. 

 

3.7. Verifications by serviceability limit states 

The verification of serviceability limit states should be performed for stress levels, 

deflections and cracking of concrete, which are calculated using an elastic global analysis 

and considering the effects of shear lag, creep and shrinkage of concrete. (Composite 

highway bridge design, 2010)

51 

 

3.7.1. Stresses  

Stress levels at SLS are verified for the characteristic combination of actions, to 

ensure that there is no inelastic behaviour. The stresses in the structural steel, in the concrete 

and the shear force per connector are limited by: 

? (EN 1993-2, 2006) (Chapter 7.3(1)), for structural steel 

? (EN 1994-2, 2005) (Chapter 7.2.2(2)), for concrete 

? (EN 1993-2, 2006) (Chapter 6.8.1(3)), for shear force per connector 

 

3.7.2. Deflections 

According to (Vayas, Iliopoulos, 2013), there exist no limit deflection on Eurocodes 

for road bridges so that such limits must be agreed with the owner of the bridge. On its turn, 

the limit deflections may also be determined by reference to other sources. According to the 

Spanish standard (Recomendaciones para el proyecto de puentes mixtos para carreteras RPX 

- 95, 2003), the indicative limiting value for deflections related to the overload for frequent 

SLS combination of action, should not exceed the following values: 

L/1000 : for roadway bridges; 

L/1200 : for footway bridges and roadway bridges with footway tracks.  

 

3.7.3. Cracking of concrete 

In order to ensure that the crack widths will be limited and durability of concrete slab 

will not be substantially affected, some agreed limits should be taken into consideration. 

These limits are performed by (EN 1994-2, 2005) (7.4), which defines a minimum 

reinforcement area placed at hogging moment areas , as well as it gives some limiting 

spacing and diameters of the rebars.

Numerical Example 

 

4. Numerical Example  
The numerical example presented herein, together with the previous chapters aims to 

illustrate the different calculation steps of a twin composite girder bridge designing, 

according to the methodologies proposed by Eurocodes.   

This example corresponds to a twin-girder bridge, commonly known as Ladder Deck 

Bridge, which, due to its simplicity has been a solution very implemented in many countries. 

The study carried out on this chapter is taken for a general situation, which does not 

corresponds to a real case, and covers only design of the superstructure.  

Taking into account the above considerations, this chapter begins with a reference to 

the structural description of the bridge designing, and the normative standards used, followed 

by the classification and combination of actions to taken into consideration, distribution of 

effective width and methodology of global analysis, verification of Ultimate and 

Serviceability Limit States, until the design of shear connectors.1 

 

 

4.1. Structural description 

In order to take an overall view of the composite bridge designing, a structural 

description is presented on this section, highlighting its type of use, and the structural 

arrangement. 

The numerical example corresponds to a continuous three-span road bridge, of 37,5 

m, 50 m, and 37,5 m (Figure 4-2), which is not designed to carry exceptional traffic. 

Moreover, the rolling surface has two traffic lanes of 3,5 m on either side, as well as it carries 

0,75 m wide marginal strip, and 1,5 m wide footway on each side of the traffic lane, as 

represented in Figure 4-1. 

As it can be seen by Figure 4-1, the steel beam depth, and the slab thickness are 

constant over the whole length of the bridge, at 2,12 m and 0,25 m respectively. However,

the geometric properties of the web and flanges, namely the width and thickness vary along 

the length of the steel beams (Figure 4-2).          

 

Figure 4-1 Cross section 

In order to brief summarize the structural arrangement of the steel-concrete 

composite bridge, Figure 4-2 depicts a representation of the longitudinal view of the bridge, 

followed by the distribution of longitudinal and transverse stiffeners, as well as the cross 

bracings, until the final dimensions for the elements of the plate girders. 

 

4.2. Materials 

The following material properties are taken into account: 

Structural Steel:    

S355 t ? 40 mm fy = 355 MPa (EN 1993-1-1, 2005) (3.2) 

S460 40 &amp;lt;t ? 80 mm fy = 430 MPa (EN 1993-1-1, 2005) (3.2)

  Es = 210 GPa (EN 1992-2, 2005) (3.2.2) 

* The modulus of elasticity of both structural steel and reinforcing steel is taken as 210 GPa, as permitted 

by EN 1994-2.

In addition to the steel grades defined above, the steel subgrades should be chosen to 

avoid the brittle fracture at low temperatures. This subgrade depends mainly on the plate 

thickness, on the tensile stress level ?Ed in the section and on the service temperature Ted.

The combination of actions to be considered to calculate ?Ed is the accidental one 

where the thermal action is the accidental load, however, in practice it can be assumed equal 

to the value for the frequent actions. 

The service temperature TEd can be taken as equal to the characteristic value of the 

minimum shade air temperature Tmin defined in Annex A of EN 1991-1-5. A value of Tmin 

equal to -20ºC have been assumed in this numerical example. 

Thus, for the structural steel of the deck, grade S355 and S460 are used with the 

subgrades indicated on the following:

As is can be noted on section 3.3, the actions are classified in relation to their 

duration, magnitude, and probability of occurrence, as permanent, variable, accidental and 

seismic actions. Taking into account the scope of this numerical example, as well as the 

characteristics of the bridge, the actions to take in consideration for this numerical example, 

are described on the following sections.  

 

4.5.1. Permanent actions 

 

? Self-weight of structural elements 

The density of structural steel (main girders, cross bracing and stiffeners) is taken as 

77 kN/m3, on its turn, the density of reinforced concrete and wet concrete (slab) is taken as 

25 and 26 kN/m3, respectively. Thus: 

a) Steel structure  ……………………………... 7,2 kN/m 

b) Concrete slab ……………………………... 35,94 kN/m 

c) Wet concrete  ……………………………... 37,38 kN/m 

             (during construction)  (each beam) 

 

? Self-weight of the non-structural elements (Dead loads) 

a) Asphalt layer  ……………………………... 0,08 x 24 = 1,9 kN/m² 

b) Waterproofing layer ……………………………... 0,03 x 24 = 0.7 kN/m² 

c) pedestrian footway* ……………………………... 6.75 kN/m 

d) Parapets * ……………………………... 0,5 kN/m 

e) safety barriers* ……………………………... 0,5 kN/m 

f) kerbs * ……………………………... 2,2 kN/m 

g) edge beam* ……………………………... 4,25 kN/m 

* (on either side)  25,25 kN/m  

(each beam)

4.5.2. Variable actions 

 

? Traffic loads  

Traffic loads on road bridges, include vertical and horizontal forces on the 

carriageway, which are determined by chapter 4 of (EN 1991-2, 2003). According to this 

standard, the vertical loads on the carriageway are represented by four load models, as stated 

in 3.3.1.2. Taking into consideration that the road bridge of this numerical example is not 

open to exceptional traffic, the load model 3 (special traffic) does not need to be checked. 

Furthermore, the horizontal actions due to acceleration and backing are not studied when 

checking the superstructure. Thus, the traffic loads on the present road bridge are represented 

by Load Model 1. 

Load Model 1 consists of two partial systems; a double axle concentrated loads, and 

uniformly distributed loads, as represented bellow (Figure 4-3). The first step to determine 

these two partial systems, is to define the number of notional lanes. For this example, the 

number of notional lanes is determined by the following:

? Pedestrian loads 

Pedestrian traffic load is represented by a distributed load of qfk=5kN/m
2, given by 

(EN 1991-2, 2003) (5.3.2.1) that acts on the unfavourable parts of the influence line in 

longitudinal and transverse directions. For road bridges, a vertical load represented by the 

reduced value in combination with the traffic loads is taken into account. Thus, 0,6 qfk is 

applied (qfk = 0,6 x 5,0 = 3,0 kN/m
2), as displayed in Figure 4-3. 

 

? Thermal loads 

Temperature effects are defined by (EN 1991-1-5, 2003). According to the mentioned 

standard, the real temperature distribution within an individual structural element may be 

divided into four independent components; a uniform temperature component, a linear 

varying temperature component about y-y axis, a uniform temperature component, a linear 

varying temperature component about z-z axis, and a non-linear temperature component. 

However, for the majority of the plate girder bridges, the consideration of a uniform 

temperature component, and a linear varying temperature component about y-y axis, is 

considered adequate. Thus, for calculation of internal forces and moments due to 

temperature in the numerical example, a linear varying temperature component is assumed.   

Table 6.1 by (EN 1991-1-5, 2003) (6.1.4.1), allows the recommended values of linear 

temperature difference component for different types of bridge decks, which on its turn, is 

modified by Portuguese National Annex. Thus, for a road bridge with a type 2 deck 

(composite deck), the following values are given:

The wind actions are not taking into consideration in this numerical example as they 

have no impact on the longitudinal global bending analysis of the bridge geometry.

? Shrinkage 

The shrinkage strain has two components, the drying shrinkage and the autogenous 

shrinkage. However, in composite bridges, only drying shrinkage is considered directly for 

the calculation of stresses and deformations.  

Taking into account the procedure outlined in clause 3.1(2) of (EN 1994-2, 2005), as 

well as in clause 3.1.4(5) and in Annex B.2) of (EN 1992-1-1, 2004), the calculation of the 

drying shrinkage is performed, as presented on the following lines.

loading is assumed to be 15 days, after concreting stage.

Construction loads are classed as variable loads, which comes from six different 

sources, Qca, Qcb, Qcc, Qcd, Qce, and Qcf, according to Table 4.1 of (EN 1991-1-6, 2005). For 

global analysis of steel structure during the casting of concrete, the following actions are 

taken into account simultaneously (wet concrete is assumed to have a density of 1 kN/m3 

higher than that of hardened concrete): 

a) Personal and hand tools (Qca)      …………………………….……… 1 kN/m
2 

b) Formwork and load bearing

4.6. Effective width 

As it was already explained on section 3.5.1, the verification of cross-section should 

be determined taking into account the distribution of effective width between supports and 

mid span regions, due to non-uniform distribution of stresses over the total width of the slab, 

as a result of an effect known as shear lag. The effective width beff, at mid span or an internal 

support, as well as at an end support, is determined according to (EN1994-2, 5.4.1.2), as 

presented on the following lines.

4.7. Global analysis 

The global analysis of the bridge is valid for Ultimate and Serviceability Limit States, 

and aims the calculation of the whole structure in order to determine the internal forces and 

moments, as well as the corresponding stresses on its various sections. This global analysis 

is calculated by respecting the stages of construction, the effects of creep and shrinkage, as 

well as the effect of cracking of concrete.

4.7.1. Stages of construction 

As it can be inferred by (EN 1994-2, 2005) (5.4.2.4), an appropriate analysis should 

be made to cover the effects of staged construction, including separate effects of actions 

applied to structural steel and to wholly or partially composite members. For this numerical 

example, the sequence of construction listed on section 4.3, is considered.     

 

4.7.2. Effect of creep 

The effects of creep are taken into account by using modular ratios nL for the concrete, 

as indicated by (EN 1994-2, 2005) (5.4.2.2). The modular ratios to consider, depending on 

the type of loading, are displayed on the following guidelines:

? To calculate the isostatics and hyperstatic effects of shrinkage:     

  13)88,155,01(
0

???? nn  

 

4.7.3. Effect of cracking of concrete 

Since the ratio of the length of adjacent continuous spans (shorter/ longer) between 

supports is greater than 0,6 (37,5/50 = 0,75), the effect of cracking of concrete may be taken 

into account by using cracked section properties over 15% of the span on each side of each 

internal supports, and as uncracked section elsewhere. (EN 1994-2, 2005) (5.4.2.3) 

   Thus, the cracked section properties may be considered at 5,6m (0,15 x 37,5 = 5,6m) 

over span 1 and span 3, and 7,5m (0,15 x 50 = 7,5m) over the span 2, adjacent to each pillar. 

However, since the variation of cross-section (Section Type 1 to Section Type 3) occurs at 

6 m adjacent to each pillar, for simplification, this length is assumed as the cracked zone.

4.7.4. Mechanical characteristics of sections 

As it can be observed by Figure 4-2, the effective widths and consequently the 

properties of the cross section vary along the bridge. However, according to (EN 1994-2, 

2005) (5.4.1.2 (4)), since an elastic global analysis is used, a uniform effective width may 

be considered. Thus, the mechanical properties of sections, for global analysis of this 

numerical example, are to be determined considering a uniform effective width equal to 5,75 

m, along the whole structure.

4.7.5. Model calculation 

In order to analyse the global longitudinal bending, the deck is modelled as a 

continuous beam, which is divided longitudinally by different section types, as show in 

Figure 4-8. This division is intended to give a realistic representation of slab, taking into 

consideration the mechanical properties of cross-sections determined on the previously 

section.  

 

 

Figure 4-8 - Model calculation 

As it can be inferred by 3.5, an appropriate allowance should be made for the effects 

of cracking of concrete, creep and shrinkage, and sequences of construction. Taking this into 

account, Table 4-5 summarises the properties of section types depending on the type of 

loading.

o Action effects due to shrinkage 

Taking into account the slab is connected with steel girder due to its shear connection, 

the shortening of the concrete due to shrinkage, leads to the development of a tension force 

Nsh, acting at the centre of the concrete flange. To re-establish the equilibrium, an equal 

compression force, as well as a bending moment Msh, are applied to the composite section. 

Thus, the actions due to shrinkage are calculated for mechanical characteristic 

sections with n = 13, considering a restraint force and a moment at the end spans girder 

(Figure 4-9), determined by the following:

4.7.8. Design value of the combined actions 

Taking into consideration the earlier considerations, the load combination of actions 

to be considered for Ultimate Limit States (ULS) and Serviceability Limit States (SLS) 

verifications in this numerical example are summarized on the following. 

 

4.7.8.1. Ultimate Limit States (ULS) 

The combined values of actions for ULS are performed for the cross sections at mid 

span and over pier, taking the group load model gr1a and the temperature, as leading variable 

actions. In addition, for the cross-section over pier two hypothesis are assumed, a hypothesis 

considering the values of the maximum moment and the concomitant shear, and other 

considering the concomitant moment and the maximum shear.

4.8. Verification by Ultimate Limit States (ULS) 

The verification of structural safety of the bridge for Ultimate Limit States, should 

be carried out, taking the clauses of Chapter 6 of (EN 1994-2, 2005) into account. 

Considering the values of combined loads determined on 4.7.8.1, the following parameters 

are checked on this section: 

? Verification of structural safety in bending, which is preceded by determination of 

the class of cross section, in order to examine whether the bending resistance of cross 

section may be determined by an elastic or plastic analysis; 

? Verification of structural safety in shear; 

? Verification of bending moment and shear force (M-V) interaction. 

 

4.8.1. Cross section at Mid-span 

4.8.1.1. Verification of structural safety in bending 

? Classification of cross section 

o Top flange (compression) 

Considering that after concrete casting, the top flanges are rigidly connected to the 

concrete slab through the shear connectors (providing the spacing of connectors is 

appropriately selected), the steel top flange, which is attached to the slab may be classified 

as class 1, since concrete prevents its local buckling.

 From the above conditions, it can be inferred that the plastic neutral axis is located 

in the thickness of the upper steel flange, which means that the web is subjected only to 

tensile stress, and therefore is class1.  

Thus, the cross section at mid-span can be classified as class 1.   

 

? Bending resistance of section 

o Location of the neutral plastic axis 

Taking into consideration that the neutral plastic axis is located in the thickness of 

the steel flange, the distance at which plastic neutral axis lies bellow the top of concrete

 The web of the section over pier is in tension on its upper part and in compression on 

its lower part. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the position of the Plastic Neutral Axis 

(PNA), which is deduced by equalizing the axial forces from tension and compression zones. 

 Since the concrete slab is cracked, it is necessaire to consider the design resistance 

of the reinforcing steel bars, for an effective section equal to 5,3 m, as defined on section

4.8.3. Lateral torsional buckling 

The resistance to the lateral torsional buckling of the compression flanges of in-plane 

loaded girders is carried out according to clause 6.4 of (EN 1994-2, 2005). Since the top 

flanges are connected to concrete slab, which provides lateral restraint, this element is not 

susceptible to lateral torsional buckling. Taking this into consideration, only bottom flanges 

at internal supports are susceptible to lateral deformations. The only exception may occur 

before concrete casting, where the top flange is not connected with concrete slab, and this 

element may deform laterally. 

(EN 1993-2, 2006), proposes two approaches to calculate the lateral torsional 

buckling, a simplified method, and a general method. Since the general method requires a 

software which performs critical load calculations, and bearing in mind the purpose of this 

numerical example, on the following, the simplified method during construction is 

performed.  

 

4.8.3.1. Rigidity Cd of bracing transverse frames 

 Figure 4-14 shows the structural form of cross section with cross bracing, including 

the notations defining the modelled transverse frame, for the present numerical example. 

 
Figure 4-14 - Notations defining the modelled transverse frame 

 The rigidity Cd of bracing transverse frames may be determined by application of a 

transverse force (H = 1) at the ends of the cross frames, which can leads to a symmetric or 

antisymmetric loaded cross bracing, as illustrated in Figure 4-15.

4.8.3.2. Simplified method 

The simplified method is performed by clause 6.3.4.2 and Annex D2.4 of (EN 1993-

2, 2006). This method may be used to verify the resistance to lateral torsional buckling, 

assuming a uniform cross-section and a uniform load over the whole length of the deck, as 

well as a uniformly distributed lateral spring support in span. 

Taking this into account, as well as the geometric properties of the sections (section 

4.7.4), this method is implemented to check the lateral torsional buckling resistance of the 

upper chord, which corresponds to a plate with constant geometric properties (500 x 450 

mm). It is performed for the principal span, treating this one as a uniform compressed 

member. This assumptions is thus safe-side. 

The resistance to lateral torsional buckling of the lower chord is not checked with 

simplified method, since the flange cross-section geometry is not constant, and the 

compressed part is limited to the zones around the piers. 

Thus, for the principal span: 

L = 50 m span length between the rigid supports; 

l = 6,25 m  distance between the springs. 

  The critical axial load Ncrit, considering the compressive force NEd constant over the 

length of the chord, is calculated by EN 1993-2, 6.3.4.2 (6) as described on the following:

4.9. Verification of Serviceability Limit States (SLS) 

According to clause 3.4 of (EN 1990, 2002), Serviceability Limit States concern the 

functioning of the structure and its structural members under normal use, the comfort of 

people, as well as the appearance of the bridge, in such a way, that it avoid excessive 

deformations, and cracking of the concrete slab. 

Thus, at Serviceability Limit State under global longitudinal bending, the following 

parameters have been checked: 

? Deflection control; 

? Stress limitations for structural steel, reinforcement, and concrete; 

? Control of cracking for concrete. 

 

4.9.1. Deflections 

As it was already explained in 3.7.2, there exist no limit deflection on Eurocodes for 

road bridge so that such limits must be agreed with the owner of the bridge, or by reference 

to other sources. Thus, as indicated in that section, the limiting value of (L/1200) related to 

the overload for frequent SLS combination of actions, has been adopted as the representative 

value to check the deformation of the bridge analysed in this numerical example. Then: 

? Deflection value due to overload

Heavy vehicle Tsk: 28,3 mm 

 

? Frequent SLS combination of actions 

? ? ? ? mm75,3375,03,284,03,31 ????  
 

? Limiting value 

mmLmm 67,411200/75,33 ??  

 

4.9.2. Stress limitations 

As it can be inferred by 3.7.1, the stress levels at SLS are verified for the 

characteristic SLS combination of actions, in order to ensure the bridge functioning under 

normal use and the comfort of users, limiting the deformations affecting the appearance and 

its vibrations, as well as to control the damage affecting its appearance, durability or its

functioning. On the following, the stress limitations refer to the structural steel and, concrete 

slab, and steel reinforcement are to be determined. 

 

4.9.2.1. Structural steel  

The stress limiting values for the characteristic SLS combination of actions are 

defined by clause 7.2.2 of (EN 1994-2, 2005), which on its turn refers to (EN 1993-2, 7.3). 

Thus, in order to ensure the elastic behaviour under service loads, the design stresses of 

structural steel, should be limited as follows:

Taking the aforementioned considerations, the stresses in the structural steel under 

characteristic SLS combination of actions obtained for each loading form, are summarised 

on the following table. It corresponds to the stresses in the top of upper flange, and to the

4.9.3. Cracking of concrete for longitudinal global bending 

The verification of cracking of concrete is concerned for quasi-permanent SLS 

combination of action, according to (EN 1994-2, 2005) (7.4). In order to check the limiting 

values of cracking of concrete, the following points will be analysed: 

o Maximum value of crack width; 

o Minimum reinforcement area; 

o Control of cracking under direct loads; 

o Control of cracking under indirect loads.    

 

o Maximum value of crack width 

The maximum values of the crack width, depending on the exposure class are 

determined according to Table 7.1N of EN1992-1-1, 7.3.1. Taking in to account that the 

exposure class of the upper and lower reinforcement of the slab is XC3 and XC4, 

respectively, the recommended value of the maximum crack width Wmax should be limited 

to 0,3 mm. 

 

o Minimum reinforcement area  

The control of cracking at Serviceability Limit States is covered by clause 7.4.2 (1) 

of EN 1994-2, which requires a minimum reinforcement area given by: 

    
s

?
?????

Where:

 is the mean value of the tensile strength of the concrete effective at the time 

when the first cracked may be expected to occur. This value can be taken as 

those for fctm (EN 1992-1-1, 2004) (Table 3.1), taking into account the concrete 

strength class, thus it will be equal to 3,2 MPa. 

ct
A  is the cross-sectional area of the tensile zone of the concrete (due to direct 

loading and the primary effects of shrinkage). For simplicity, the cross-

sectional area of the concrete may be adopted as the area determined by its 

effective width. 

s
?  is the maximum stress allowed in the reinforcement immediately after 

cracking of the concrete. To satisfy the required width limits, this value may

be taken as its characteristic yield strength fsk, according to EN-1994-2, 7.4.2. 

Thus, it will be equal to fsk = 500 MPa.  

k  is the 0,8 reduction factor allowing for the effect of non-uniform self-

equilibrating stresses.

o Control of cracking under direct loading 

Clause 7.4.3 of (EN 1994-2, 2005) covers the control of cracking under direct 

loading. According to this clause, where the minimum reinforcement calculated before is 

provided, the limitations of crack widths may generally be achieved by limiting the bar 

spacing according to Table 7.2 of  (EN 1994-2, 2005) (7.4.3), or limiting the bar diameters 

according to Table 7.1 of (EN 1994-2, 2005) (7.4.2) of the slab steel reinforcement. 

 For a composite beam where the concrete slab is assumed to be cracked and not pre-

stressed by tendons, stress in reinforcement increases due to the effects of tension stiffening 

of concrete between cracks compared with the stress based on a composite section neglecting 

concrete. Thus, according to (EN 1994-2, 2005) (7.4.3(3)) the tensile stress in reinforcement 

due to direct loading may be calculated as:

bar spacing is verified (127,5 &amp;lt;300 mm).

4.9.4. Connection 

As it can be noted by section 3.6.4.1, shear connectors are required on the top flanges 

of the girders to provide the required transfer of composite action between the steel girder 

and concrete slab. Thus, the design process of shear connectors is to be performed on the 

following.

The design value of the shear connectors is defined by (EN 1994-1-1, 2004) (6.6.3).

4.9.4.2. Determination of number of shear connectors 

The first step to determine the number of shear connectors, consists in the 

determination of the zones where the elastic resistance moment exceeds the moment acting 

on the structure, in order to determine where the structure behaviour remains elastic or 

plastic. 

As described on section 3.6.1.2, the elastic resistance moment for a composite cross-

section that behaves in an elastic manner, is determined by the summation of the bending 

moments at each stage of construction, as:

 Since for this numerical example, the bending moments acting on the structure, does 

not exceed the elastic resistance moment, the longitudinal shear at the steel-concrete 

interface, is determined by the following formula of mechanics:

The procedure above described, needs to be taken into consideration in order to 

calculate the distribution of shear connectors over all the length of the bridge. It should be 

noted that, in hogging moment regions, where the slab is in tension, longitudinal shear is 

calculated using uncracked section properties, which gives a safer value.

Chapter 5 

Influence of the construction process on the serviceability behaviour of 

composite bridges 

 
5. Influence of the construction process on the serviceability behaviour of composite bridges 

The goal of the study presented herein is to analyse and evaluate the structural 

response under service conditions of composite bridges when considering different 

construction processes. Taking this into consideration, short and long term stresses, 

deflections, as well as the effect of concrete cracking above supports are analysed. 

The aforementioned study is made over the bridge designed on the previous chapter, 

considering five construction sequences. In order to study the structural response under 

service conditions of the bridge at each stage, analytical models capable to take into account 

the time dependent response of the structures at early ages and along the structure service 

life are necessary.  

The models are solved through the analysis Program Midas/Civil 2015 (V2.2), in 

order to draw conclusions that lead to the most suitable construction solution depending on 

the most restrictive design criterion of the project. The study carried out on this chapter is 

based on the study developed by (Mari, Mirambell, &amp;amp; Estrada, 2002). 

         
 

5.1. Description of the structural analysis  

Clause 5.4.2.4 of Eurocode 4, part 2 states that an appropriate analysis shall be made 

to cover the effects of staged construction, in order to achieve the correct profile of the 

completed bridge, unless all the cross sections are class 1 or 2 and there is no allowance for 

lateral torsional buckling. 

In the current structural analysis, five different construction sequences will be 

analysed with the main purpose of comparing the structural response of the bridge on each 

construction sequence. The structural description, as well as the material properties of the 

bridge presented on the previous chapter, are adopted in the current structural analysis. 

 Bearing in mind that the verification of the serviceability limit states requires the 

realistic evaluation of internal forces, support reactions, stress and strains, together with 

crack widths and displacements, it is essential to take into account the following aspects that 

affects the structure’s response: (Mari, Mirambell, &amp;amp; Estrada, 2002) 



Design of Composite Steel and Concrete Bridges 

 

106 

 

? The cracking of concrete under tension, in such a way, that it reduces the structure 

stiffness, modifies the stress distribution between the concrete slab and the steel 

girder and, in the case of continuous bridges, it also affects the distribution of internal 

forces. In the current study, three methods for taking into account cracking of 

concrete above intermediate supports are compared:  

o Method 1 (uncracked analysis): first an uncracked analysis is carried out and 

the extent of cracking is determined, followed by another analysis using 

cracked section properties in these regions;  

o Method 2 (simplified method): it is assumed that, the concrete is cracked 

adjacent to internal supports over 15% of the span; 

o Method 3: this calculation method assumes an uncracked section and a 

default redistribution of 10% of the support moments into the spans. (Lebet 

&amp;amp; Hirt, 2013) 

? The difference in the rheological behaviour between the component materials: unlike 

steel, concrete suffers from time-dependent strains due to shrinkage and creep and 

its mechanical characteristics evolve with time, which leads to deflections and stress 

re-distribution changes during and after the construction process. MIDAS/Civil can 

reflect time dependent concrete properties such as creep, shrinkage and compressive 

strength, as explained on section 5.2.2 

? The construction process: since the structural configuration continuously changes 

with different loading and support conditions, and each construction stage affects the 

subsequent stages, the design of certain structural components may be governed 

during the construction. Accordingly, without consideration of construction process, 

the analysis for the post-construction stage will not be reliable. The five construction 

processes considered are presented and explained on section 5.3.     

In order to capture the time-dependent behaviour of the bridge under service 

conditions, the structural analysis strategy consists of a time step-by-step procedure, in 

which the time domain is divided into a number of intervals. A time forward integration is 

performed in which increments of displacements, stresses and other structural quantities are 

successively added to the previous totals as forward in the time domain. Thus, at each time 

step, the structure is analysed under three types of cycles defined, each one enclosing the 

previous one:

o Construction stages; 

o Time intervals; 

o Load steps. 

This structural analysis is performed by the analysis program Midas/Civil 2015 

(V2.2). 

 

5.2. General description of MIDAS/Civil 

The structural analysis, as described above has been incorporated into the computer 

program MIDAS/Civil 2015 (V2.2). MIDAS/Civil is an analysis and design software for 

structural engineering that offer special features for the analysis of any bridge structure. It 

has been developed by the Korean structural software development company MidasSoft, Inc, 

and its reliability has been established through applying them to thousands of real projects. 

(Analysis for civil structures)  

Midas/Civil offers many special features for the analysis and design of bridges, such 

as: 

? Construction stage analysis; 

? Time-dependent analysis feature; 

? Solution for unknown loads using optimization technique; 

? Analysis of prestressed concrete box girders; 

? Moving load analysis for bridge structures; 

? Hydration heat analysis; 

? Composite steel bridge analysis considering section properties of pre- and post-

combined sections; 

? ILM/MSS/FCM bridge wizard (automatic generation of the model data of a 

prestressed or post-tensioned box bridge constructed by: incremental launching 

method (ILM), a movable scaffolding system (MSS) or by free cantilever method 

(FCM)); 

? Cable-stayed bridge wizard (automatic generation of two-dimensional cable-stayed 

bridges). 

Although, it is not intention to use all these features. Actually, the first two 

specialities are considered and explained on the following, in order to perform the 

construction stage analysis.

5.2.1. Definition of construction stages 

In order to define construction activities MIDAS/Civil provides the Composite 

Section for Construction Stage command for performing the construction stage analysis of 

a composite section, which allows the activation and deactivation of elements, activation and 

deactivation of loadings at certain points in time, as well as it allows changes in boundary 

conditions. Taking this into consideration, the procedure to perform construction stage 

analysis of a composite bridge is as follows: 

1. Define the material and section properties; 

2. Define Structure Groups, Boundary Groups and Load Groups; 

3. Define construction stages; 

4. Activate the Boundary Groups and Load Groups corresponding to each construction 

stages; 

5. Activate the flooring sections corresponding to each construction stage as per the 

construction sequence for floor slab; 

6. Review the analysis results for each construction stage. (Construction Stage Analysis 

of a Bridge Using a Composite Section) 

 

5.2.2. Consideration of time-dependent material behaviour 

As it was already mentioned, deflections and stress redistributions continue to change 

during and after the construction of  composite bridges due to varying time-dependent 

properties, such as concrete creep, shrinkage, and modulus of elasticity (aging). 

MIDAS/Civil allows to performing the option of a time-dependent construction stage 

analysis considering the following time effects on materials: (Construction Stage Analysis 

of a Bridge Using a Composite Section) 

? Creep in concrete members having different maturities; 

? Shrinkage in concrete members having different maturities; 

? Compressive strength gains of concrete members as a function of time. 

The creep and shrinkage effects as well as the compressive strength gain properties 

of concrete in MIDAS/Civil can be defined by choosing one model code. When the European 

code is selected for the determination of creep and shrinkage the following input parameters 

are required: 

? Characteristic compressive cylinder strength of concrete at the age of 28 days (fck); 



5 - Influence of the construction process on the serviceability behaviour of composite bridges 

109 

 

? Relative humidity of ambient environment; 

? Notional size of the members (h=2Ac/u); 

? Type of cement (Class S, N or R); 

? Age of concrete at beginning of shrinkage. 

Based on these input parameters, MIDAS/Civil automatically computes the creep 

and shrinkage coefficients. Accordingly, Figure 5-1 and Figure 5-2 illustrates the creep 

coefficients and shrinkage strain respectively, for the current construction structural analysis.

On its turn, when the European code is selected for the determination of compressive 

Strength the following input parameters are required: 

? Mean compressive strength of concrete at the age of 28 days; 

? Cement type: (Class R: 0.20, Class N: 0.25, Class S: 0.38). 

Based on these input parameters, MIDAS/Civil automatically computes the 

compressive strength. Accordingly, Figure 5-3 illustrate the compressive strength, for the 

current construction structural analysis.

5.2.3. Running a construction stage analysis by MIDAS/Civil 

Bearing in mind the above considerations, on the following, a summary of the 

procedure used in MIDAS/Civil for carrying out a time dependent analysis reflecting 

construction stages is presented: (Analysis for civil structures) 

1. Create a structural model. Assign elements, loads and boundary conditions to be 

activated or deactivated to each construction stage together as a group; 

2. Define time dependent material properties such as creep and shrinkage. The time 

dependent material properties can be defined using the standards such as ACI, CEB-

FIP, or European; 

3. Link the define time dependent material properties to the general material properties. 

By doing this, the changes in material properties of the relevant concrete members 

are automatically calculated;

4. Considering the sequence of the real construction, generate construction stages and 

time steps; 

5. Define construction stages using the element groups, boundary condition groups and 

load groups previously defined; 

6. Carry out a structural analysis after defining the desired analysis condition; 

7. Combine the results of the construction stage analysis and the completed structure 

analysis. 

  

5.3. Considered construction process and loads applied at each stage 

Steel-concrete Composite bridges allows several construction processes, which may 

be influenced by many different parameters, such as the access, temporary support 

arrangements, and the need to minimise work during road or railway closures. In the current 

study, five different construction processes have been considered, which in turn differ in the 

execution sequence for the concrete slab and in the existence or not of propping. These are: 

1. Propped bridge: this solution correspond to the “pure” composite solution, in which 

the concrete slab is executed with the bridge completely propped. The slab is 

concreted in five phases with 6 days interval between each one, with lengths of 25 

meters.  

2. Alternate slab concreting: after the installation of the steel structure, the concrete is 

poured on site casting the slab elements in the mid-span sections before the pier 

sections. It corresponds to a solution that leads to a reduction of stresses in the slab 

in the support zones.  

3. Continuous slab concreting: once the steel structure is assembled, the slab is 

concreted in five phases with 6 days interval between each one, with lengths of 25 

meters, starting out from an abutment and arriving at the other without any alteration. 

This is a simple method, because the mobile formwork always moves in the same 

direction. However, this is an unfavourable option from the point of view of stresses, 

particularly above the intermediate supports.  

4. Simultaneous slab concreting: this is an option, in which the concrete is pour over 

the full length of the bridge at once, without the steel girder being propped. Although, 

it is not a common solution for practical reasons.  



Design of Composite Steel and Concrete Bridges 

 

112 

 

5. Propped bridge 2: this construction process consists firstly of concreting the span 

regions above the temporary supports, with lengths of 25 meters in 3 phases with 6 

days interval between each one, followed by the removing of temporary supports. 

After that, concreting support regions takes place. This method allows some of self-

weight of the concrete in the spans to be resisted by composite cross sections, as well 

as it reduces the tensile stresses at the support regions. 

   Figure 5-4 to Figure 5-8, shows the schematic construction procedures considered 

in the current study, as well as the loads applied at each stage. Unlike the Simultaneous Slab 

Concreting, in which the slab in concreting at once, concrete is poured on site casting the 

slab elements in a specific order, where the total length of the bridge (125 m) is split into 5 

identical 25 meters concreting segments. The time interval between each concreting stage is 

intended to be as 6 work days. The first day is devoted to the concreting, the next 3 days to 

its hardening and the last 2 days to moving the formwork. This sequences respects a 

minimum concrete strength of 20 MPa before removal of the formwork. (Composite higway 

bridge design: Worked Examples, 2014)       

   The Dead Load, consisting of asphalt layer, waterproofing layer, pedestrian footway, 

parapets, safety barriers, kerbs and edge beam, with a weight taken as being 25,25 kN, was 

placed after the final phase of slab concreting. These permanent loads are maintained in the 

analysis for 10000 days, so that creep, and shrinkage takes place. In order to clarify the 

results, the variable loads were considered as being due only to the traffic, as defined on 

section 4.5.2. The traffic load is applied at long term, at the most unfavourable position, 

which is: 

? To obtain the maximum deflections and positive moments at the central spans, 

distributed load at the central span, and heavy vehicle in the centre of the central 

span; 

? To obtain the maximum negative moments in the support, distributed load in spans 

1 and 2, and heavy vehicle at 55,44 meters from the abutment. 

  Table 5-4 to Table 5-8, shows the inputs parameters to perform the construction stage 

analysis in MIDAS/Civil. Taking this into consideration, on the following, a brief reference 

to the Loads considered is presented:

 In addition to the input parameters described on Table 5-4 to Table 5-8, Section 

Stiffness Scale Factors are included in Boundary Groups, at the moment of the concrete 

cracking. Section Stiffness Scale Factor is a function used for reducing flexural stiffness of 

the members. This scale factor is applied to the calculation for displacements, member 

forces, and stress calculations, in order to reflect cracked sections of concrete. Table 5-2 and 

Table 5-3 shows the required Moment of Inertia and Cross-sectional area Scale factors to be 

applied to each stiffness component.

5.4. Conclusions related to the influence of the construction sequence 

The results obtained after carrying out the analysis with MIDAS/Civil for the 

considered construction processes, are displayed and duly commented below. 

     

5.4.1. Longitudinal bending moments 

 

Figure 5-9 - Bending moments due to Dead load 

at short and long term 

 

By observing the Figure 5-9, it is 

possible to conclude that due to the effect of 

creep and shrinkage under the dead load, 

time-dependent longitudinal internal forces 

are developed; thus, a time-dependent 

longitudinal bending moment redistribution 

arises, increasing the negative bending 

moments, and reducing the positive ones.     

 The results obtained for bending moments at interior span, as well as at central 

support, due to the different actions on the bridge, namely dead loads and the traffic loads 

are displayed in Figure 5-10, Figure 5-11 and in Table 5-9.  From the observation of the 

results it is possible to conclude that a significant reduction with time of the positive 

moments takes place, varying between 30,8% for the Continuous slab concreting and 46,2% 

for the Propped 2 case. On its turn, an increment of the negative bending moments between 

16,0% for the Continuous slab concreting and 25,4% for the propped 2 case is observed.

Table 5-9 - Bending moments at central span and at support sections 

 

 Comparison of the results illustrates that whether for bending moments at central 

span and at support, Propped 2 case and Continuous slab concreting originates the extreme 

bending moment values due to the different action on the bridge, in its final state. 

Thus, while the maximum negative, and the minimum positive bending moment are obtained 

for the Continuous slab concreting, the minimum negative and the maximum positive 

bending moments are obtained for the Propped 2 case.

5.4.2. Deflections and stresses at critical sections

concrete and steel in the sections of the central span and the support are summarised in Table

Table 5-10 - Deflections and stresses at the critical sections 

 From the above table and Figure 5-11 it is visible that deflection at central span reach 

higher values for the Simultaneous and Alternate slab concreting case, and as it would be 

expected, the smaller deflection values are obtained for the Propped one. In addition to the 

construction process that affects significantly the total deflection, it is possible to observe 

the effect of the live load for each case, which varies between 54,4mm and 57,8mm.

Table 5-11 - Deflection values at central span (mm) 

Attention must be called to the fact that in deflection of the deck at central span under 

Dead load at long term, a deflection reduction is observed, which is comprised between 0,9% 

and 4,7% for the Propped and Continuous slab concreting case, respectively. The cause for 

these results is presented below.

From the results displayed in Figure 5-12, it is possible to observe that the time-

dependent deformations due to the creep increases the deflections in the central span while 

the shrinkage reduces the deformation at central span. Figure 5-12 a) shows the total 

deflections due to the sum of Creep and Shrinkage in the bridge deck, for the Simultaneous 

Slab concreting case. As it can be inferred, the sum of the time-dependent deformations due 

to Creep and Shrinkage leads to a negative deflection in the exterior spans and to a positive 

deflection in the central span. The evolution of the total deflection at interior span due to the 

effect of Creep and Shrinkage at t=0 and t=? is represented in Figure 5-12 c).

compression stress in concrete slab increases while the tension in the bottom steel plate is 

reduced. By other hand, as it would be expected, the maximum compression stresses in the 

concrete slab at interior span are observed for the Propped and Propped 2 case while the 

minimum stress is registered in the Alternate slab concreting. The Bottom steel plate arises 

the maximum tensile stresses in the Propped 2 and in the Simultaneous slab concreting, 

whereas the Propped case corresponds to the minimum tensile stress in the bottom steel plate. 

 

Figure 5-15 - Final deflections at interior span and bottom steel stresses at support 

Figure 5-15 summarises the final values of deflections at interior span and stresses at 

bottom steel plate. The comparison between the results illustrates that whether for the 

deflection at interior span or for the compression in the bottom steel support, Alternate and 

Continuous slab concreting originates higher values of deflection and compression stresses, 

while the Propped case leads to the smaller results. 

   

5.4.3. Effect of calculation method used to take into account the concrete 

cracking above supports 

As it was already explained, the influence of the calculation method used to take into 

account the cracking of the concrete above the intermediate supports is estimated by 

comparing the distribution of internal moments at central span and at support zones. In the 

Table 5-12, bending moments at central span and at support resulting from the “exact” 

calculation method are compared with the results predicted by two “non-exact” methods.

Table 5-12 - Influence of the bending moments on the bending moments 

In Figure 5-16, the bending moments at interior span are depicted for the analysis 

taking into account the three calculation methods. It can be observed that Method 2 and 

Method 3 are similar and give results that are by the safety side, when comparing with the 

Method 1. The only exception is noted for Propped 2 case, which originates a higher bending 

moment value than the Method 2 and 3.           

 

Figure 5-16 - Influence of the calculation method on the bending moments at Central Span 

On its turn, by observing the Figure 5-17, it is possible to conclude that for the 

bending moment at support, Method 2 and 3 do not give accurate results.

5.4.4. Final considerations 

Based on the study carried out throughout this structural analysis, it is possible to 

prove that the issue to analyse the correct profile of a composite bridge not only concerns 

the analysis of post-construction, but also requires an appropriate analysis to cover the 

effects of staged construction.  

The results obtained allows to conclude that the Propped case corresponds to the most 

rigid solution, since all the span works as a composite section under the self-weight of 

concrete slab, right from the beginning. 

In what concerns the deflections at centre of the interior span, as it would be expected, 

the Simultaneous and the Alternate slab concreting corresponds to the cases that leads to the 

most significant deflection values. These two concreting cases also leads to the higher 

stresses in the bottom steel plate at support section. 

Finally, it is possible to conclude that Method 2 and 3 gives accurate results for the 

calculation of bending moments at interior span, with exception of the Propped 2 case, while 

for the section at support, these two methods give results that are not by the safety side.

Conclusion 

 
6. Conclusion 

The thesis presented herein provided a general overview of the composite bridges 

designing according to the methodologies proposed by Eurocodes. 

As it was demonstrated, composite bridge designing is a long and complex process 

that involves several variables and conditions, starting with consideration of an appropriate 

design criterion, followed by a definition and combination of actions, until determination of 

resistances, durability and serviceability. Bearing in mid the earlier considerations, it can be 

concluded that covering all topics related to the composite bridge designing on this thesis, is 

clearly not possible. Thus, it was decided to focus this work on the design of a twin-girder 

bridge superstructure, with an emphasis on their verification part of the design. 

The numerical example have been developed, in order to provide as comprehensive 

a coverage as possible of composite bridge designing, highlighting the various actions acting 

on the bridge, and how they are modelled, as well as the verification at ultimate and at 

serviceability limit states  of the deck cross section. 

Through a structural analysis, the influence of the construction process on the 

serviceability behaviour of composite bridges have been studied. Short and long term 

stresses, deflections as well as the effect of concrete cracking above supports have been 

analysed and evaluated.  The following conclusions can be drawn from this study: 

1. Due to the effect of concrete creep and shrinkage, a time-dependent longitudinal 

bending moment redistribution arises, increasing the negative bending moments, 

and reducing the positive ones; 

2. Simultaneous and the Alternate slab concreting corresponds to the cases that 

leads to the most significant deflections at centre of the central span, as well as 

to the higher stresses in the bottom steel plate at support section; 

3. Method 2 and 3 do not give accurate results for the calculation of bending 

moments for the sections at support; 

4. Furthermore, this study proves that an appropriate analysis should be taken into 

consideration, in order to cover the effects of staged construction.

Future developments 

As it was already mentioned, this dissertation provides a didactical understanding 

related to the composite bridge designing according to the methodologies proposed by 

Eurocodes, giving emphasis to the verification part of the design. 

It would be interesting to apply the acquired knowledge to a real case study, in order 

to carry out a conceptual design of a composite bridge. Taking this into account, the 

following aspects should be taken into consideration: 

? Piers, abutments and bearings designing; 

? Geotechnical aspects of bridge design; 

? Overview of seismic issues for bridge design.
