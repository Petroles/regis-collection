RESUMO 

 
Obtenção de linhagens de Saccharomyces cerevisiae mediante hibridação para tolerância 
aos inibidores presentes no hidrolisado de bagaço para produção do etanol de segunda 

geração 
 

Mudança climática global e a volatilidade do preço do petróleo tem impulsionado a 
necessidade de redução e substituição de combustíveis fósseis por energias renováveis. A 
produção de bioetanol nos Estados Unidos e no Brasil a partir de milho e cana-de-açúcar, 
respectivamente, está estabelecida. Todavia, a produção de bioetanol mostra-se insustentável, 
pelo fato da utilização de produtos alimentares para tal produção. Em contrapartida, 
biocombustíveis produzidos a partir de resíduos lignocelulósicos têm sido vistos como uma 
solução plausível para o problema “alimento versus combustível”. No Brasil, o bagaço de 
cana é uma fonte disponível de biomassa lignocelulósica. No entanto, inibidores como 
furfural, 5-hidroximetil-furfural (HMF) e ácidos carboxílicos formados durante o pré-
tratamento ácido da biomassa lignocelulósica, têm efeito negativo sobre os microorganismos 
fermentadores - Saccharomyces cerevisiae. No Brasil, o etanol de segunda-geração (2G) tem 
possibilidade de utilizar um novo substrato, preparado a partir da mistura de melaço e 
hidrolisado de bagaço. O melaço será um adjuvante para suprir a deficiência nutricional do 
hidrolisado, contribuindo com minerais, aminoácidos e vitaminas. Por outro lado, o melaço 
apresenta alguns inibidores, como HMF, sulfito, e concentração tóxica de alguns minerais, 
como potássio (K) e cálcio (Ca), que afetam o crescimento e desempenho fermentativo de S. 
cerevisiae. O objetivo deste trabalho foi gerar descendentes tolerantes de linhagens industriais 
de S. cerevisiae, capazes de lidar com inibidores presentes no melaço e no hidrolisado de 
bagaço, por meio de hibridação e evolução adaptativa, para produção do etanol 2G. As 
linhagens industriais PE-2, CAT-1 e SA-1 foram esporuladas, seus haplóides foram irradiados 
por luz ultravioleta (UV), objetivando o aumento da diversidade genética e fenotípica das 
linhagens. Após cruzamento direcionado, 234 híbridos foram selecionados pelo crescimento 
(DO570nm) em meios de melaço e hidrolisado. Em paralelo, cruzamentos massais (intra e inter-
linhagens) de haplóides não-irradiados de PE-2, CAT-1 e SA-1 foram realizados e 
submetidos a evolução adaptativa por cerca de 100 gerações. As 120 estirpes de cruzamentos 
massais seguidos de evolução adaptativa foram selecionadas pelo crescimento em meios de 
melaço e hidrolisado. Seis isolados apresentaram boas características fermentativas em 
comparação às cepas referências, mostrando que hibridação e evolução adaptativa de 
linhagens de leveduras industriais brasileiras são boas estratégias para desenvolver novas 
linhagens para produção do etanol-2G. Para uma melhor utilização dos açúcares do 
hidrolisado, a cassete contendo os três genes responsáveis pela fermentação de xilose (xilose 
redutase, xilitol desidrogenase e xiluloquinase) foi integrada no genoma do haplóide 
segregante (272-1a) de uma das seis estirpes selecionadas (272), que apresentou a maior 
tolerância em hidrolisado de Miscanthus x giganteus. Estudos de fermentação mostraram que 
a estirpe foi capaz de metabolizar a xilose em etanol. Por fim, o haploide 272-1a foi analisado 
por quantitative trait loci (QTL) afim de identificar a base genética da tolerância ao 
hidrolisado. Apesar, do(s) gene(s) causativos não terem sido identificados nesse trabalho, os 
picos do mapa de QTL identificados servirão como ponto de partida para futuro mapeamento.

ABSTRACT 

 
Improvement of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by hybridization for increased tolerance 

towards inhibitors from second-generation ethanol substrate 
 

Global climate change and volatility of petroleum price have driven the necessity to 
reduce fossil fuel utilization and replace it by renewable energy. Bioethanol production in the 
United States and Brazil from cornstarch and sugarcane, respectively, is already established. 
However, the bioethanol industry appears unsustainable in view of the potential stress that its 
production places on food commodities. In contrast, second-generation biofuels produced 
from cheap and abundant lignocellulosic biomass, has been viewed as one plausible solution 
to this "food versus fuel" problem. Sugarcane bagasse is an abundant source of lignocellulosic 
biomass in Brazil and is generally recognized as a very promising feedstock for 
lignocellulosic ethanol production. Nevertheless, inhibitors such as furfural, 5-hydroxymethyl 
furfural (HMF) and carboxylic acids are formed during an acid thermochemical pretreatment 
of lignocellulosic biomass, which has a negative effect on the fermentative microorganisms – 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Second-generation (2G) ethanol in Brazil has the possibility to use 
a novel substrate, prepared as a blend of sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate and cane molasses. 
Molasses supplements the nutritional deficiencies of bagasse hydrolysate, contributing with 
minerals, amino acids and vitamins. However, molasses also contains additional inhibitors, 
such as HMF, sulfite, and toxic concentration of some minerals (K, Ca), which affect S. 
cerevisiae fermentation performance. The goal of this work was to generate tolerant 
derivatives of S. cerevisiae industrial strains that are able to cope with inhibitors present in 
bagasse hydrolysate and molasses, by means of sexual hybridization and adaptive evolution, 
which can be used for 2G-ethanol production. The industrial strains PE-2, CAT-1 and SA-1 
were sporulated, and haploids were irradiated by ultraviolet (UV) light in order to increase 
genetic and phenotypic diversity. After direct mating and screening in molasses and 
hydrolysate media, 234 hybrid strains were selected for further study.  In parallel, mass 
matings (intra and interlines) of PE-2, CAT-1 and SA-1 from non-irradiated haploids were 
performed and the generated strains were subjected to adaptive evolution for about 100 
generations. The 120 strains derived from mass mating and adaptive evolution were then 
screened for growth in molasses-hydrolysate media. Six isolates showed good fermentation 
properties compared to the reference strains, showing that hybridization and adaptive 
evolution of Brazilian industrial yeast strains was a good strategy to develop new tolerant 
strains for 2G-ethanol production.  To better utilize all the sugars present in bagasse 
hydrolysate, a cassette containing the three genes responsible for xylose fermentation (xylose 
reductase, xylitol dehydrogenase and xylulose kinase) was integrated into the genome of a 
haploid derivative (272-1a) of one of the six selected hybrids (272), which had the highest 
tolerance to Miscanthus x giganteus hydrolysate.  Fermentation studies demonstrated that this 
engineered strain was able to metabolize xylose into ethanol. Finally, the haploid 272-1a was 
analyzed by quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping to identify the genetic basis of hydrolysate 
tolerance.  Although the causative gene(s) were not identified in this work, a number of QTL 
peaks were identified that will serve as the starting point for future fine-mapping studies.

1 INTRODUCTION!
 
 

Global climate change and volatility of petroleum prices have driven the necessity to 

reduce the fossil fuel consumption and replace it with renewable energy source. Bioethanol 

production in the United States and Brazil, from corn and sugarcane respectively, is already 

established; however these renewable energy sources have some ethical limitations, because 

food-products are being used to produce biofuel (BELLISSIMI et al., 2009; WRIGHT et al., 

2011; KIM et al., 2013a). Additionally in Brazil, deforestation of new areas to expand the 

agricultural area is unsustainable. Non-food renewable feedstocks, such as lignocellulosic 

biomass (i.e. sugarcane bagasse) are an effective alternative to boost bioethanol production in 

Brazil by up to 30%, while preserving native areas (G20, 2014; GLOBO RURAL, 2014).  

Lignocellulosic biomass is mainly composed of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in 

an organized structure; however, a pretreatment is required to hydrolyze the hemicellulose 

and make the cellulose accessible to enzymatic hydrolysis. Although the commonly used 

method of acid thermochemical pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass releases pentose and 

hexose sugars (HA et al., 2011), the harsh reaction conditions also results in the formation of 

inhibitors (e.g. furfural, 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) and carboxylic acids) that have a 

negative effect on the growth and fermentation of ethanol producing microorganisms, such as 

Saccharomyces cerevisiae (JONSSON et al., 2013; SATO et al., 2014). 

 Second-generation ethanol in Brazil has the possibility to use a blend of sugarcane 

bagasse hydrolysate and cane molasses (co-product from the sugar industry). Molasses 

provides nutrients and minerals that are missing or deficient from hydrolysate, such as amino 

acids, B group vitamins (HARRISON, 1971), organic acids (trans-aconitc, citric, malic, 

which contribute a desirable buffer effect), fatty acids (linoleic, palmitic, oleic and linolenic) 

(GUTIERREZ; SILVA, 1993) and minerals (K, Mg, S, Ca, P, Zn, Cu, Mn, Al) (MORRISON, 

1959). These organic and mineral nutrients are crucial for maintaining S. cerevisiae cell 

viability during cell recycling that is practiced in Brazilian distilleries. Molasses also 

contributes to an increased sugar concentration that results in higher ethanol titers, and 

consequently lower energy consumption in the distillation step. However, molasses also has 

inhibitors, such as HMF, sulfite, and toxic concentration of some minerals (K, Ca) that affect 

S. cerevisiae fermentation performance (BASSO et al., 2008). 

First-generation ethanol production in Brazil uses a mixture of sugar cane juice and 

molasses in different proportions in fed-batch fermentations with cell recycling. The high cell 

density ensures a very short fermentation time. This process requires yeast cells with high

viability in order to sustain a large biomass inside the fermenter (BASSO et al., 2008). It is 

expected that second-generation lignocellulosic ethanol production will apply the same fed-

batch process using hydrolysate, and similarly, yeasts with high viability will be required to 

withstand the rigors of cell recycling. In addition, yeast strains for second-generation ethanol 

production in Brazil need to be tolerant to the cocktail of inhibitors present both in 

hydrolysate and molasses, and robust to the stresses encountered during the industrial process 

(i.e. high temperature, high ethanol content, acid treatment, osmotic pressure, cell recycling).  

However industrial yeast strains, used for first-generation (1G) ethanol, have been 

showing decreased implantation capacity due to the higher proportion of molasses in the 

current industrial substrate (BASSO et al., 2008); a new generation of more tolerant yeast 

strains are required for both first and specially second-generation (2G) ethanol production. 

One viable approach to developing these new yeast strains is sexual hybridization and mass 

mating of current 1G strains.  This is possible because current (1G) industrial strains are 

commercially available, they sporulate easily and generate viable spores, and they have 

already been selected for tolerance to industrial fermentation conditions (ALEXANDRINO, 

2012). In addition, to mating and sporulation, genotypic and phenotypic diversity can be 

further increased by induced mutation by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and adaptive laboratory 

evolution.   

In addition, it is essential for economic conversion of renewable feedstock into 

biofuels and chemicals, an efficient and rapid fermentation of mixed sugars, ~70% of hexoses 

and ~30% of pentoses present in lignocellulosic biomass (HA et al., 2011). However wild 

type S. cerevisiae used for first-generation (1G) ethanol cannot ferment pentose (xylose). 

The goal of this work was to generate new tolerant derivatives of 1G Saccharomyces 

cerevisiae industrial strains that are able to cope with inhibitors present in a mixture of cane 

bagasse hydrolysate and molasses, using sexual hybridization, UV mutagenesis, and adaptive 

evolution. Such tolerant strains would be valuable backgrounds for further metabolic 

engineering to enable xylose fermentation. The second goal was to understand the genetic 

basis of hydrolysate tolerance by quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. In the long-term, 

identification of hydrolysate tolerance genes and their mechanism(s) of action should enable 

future engineering efforts to generate optimal strains that are necessary for an economic 

lignocellulosic ethanol process.

2 REVIEW 

 

2.1 Second-generation ethanol in Brazil 

 

 Global concerns about climate change and international oil prices have increased the 

adoption of renewable energy policies. Biofuels (i.e. bioethanol and biodiesel) can contribute 

to minimizing fossil fuel consumption. Bioethanol production is obtained from sugarcane 

substrates (cane juice and molasses) and cornstarch fermentation by Saccharomyces 

cerevisiae, in Brazil and the United States, respectively. Currently, Brazil is the world’s 

second biggest ethanol producer (RENEWABLE FUELS ASSOCIATION - RFA, 2014) and 

production is expected to reach 27 billion liters of ethanol in the 2014/2015 season 

(COMPANHIA NACIONAL DE ABASTECIMENTO - CONAB, 2014). However, the first-

generation (1G) ethanol industry in Brazil and the United States appears unsustainable in 

view of the potential stress its production places on food commodities. In contrast, second-

generation (2G) biofuels produced from cheap and abundant non-food plant feedstocks, has 

been viewed as one plausible solution to this “food versus fuel” problem (GOMEZ et al., 

2008; BASSO et al., 2013). 

In Brazil, sugarcane bagasse and sugarcane straw are available sources of 

lignocellulosic biomass and are considered a very promising feedstock for 2G-ethanol 

production. Although burning bagasse/straw at ethanol distilleries for generation of electricity 

is current profitable, the development of 2G-bioethanol will be more advantageous (DIAS et 

al., 2011). Additionally, the high cost of 2G-bioethanol production, irrespective of the 

lignocellulosic feedstock used, can be partially solved by integrating the 1G and 2G 

technologies into a plant thus sharing energy and material streams in unit operations in order 

to exploit synergies (MACRELLI et al., 2012). 

First-generation bioethanol production in Brazil uses a mixture of cane juice and 

molasses (co-products from the sugar industry) in different proportions, in either a fed-batch 

or continuous fermentation process with cell recycling. Fed-batch process, or Melle-Boinot 

utilizes a high cell concentration in order to reduce fermentation time and biomass growth 

during cell recycling. Even so, some yeast growth is required at least to replace biomass 

(above 5-10%) that is lost during centrifugation in each fermentation cycle. The industrial 

process starts with the addition of must (a mixture of sugarcane juice and molasses) 

containing a total reducing sugar (TRS) concentration of 18-22% to the yeast cell suspension. 

After 6-10 hours of fermentation at 32-38oC, the final ethanol titer is about 8 to 10% (v/v). At 



!

the end of this fermentation, the yeast is separated from the fermented must by centrifugation 

and diluted to 30-40% (w/v) with water, and then submitted to an acid treatment (sulfuric 

acid, pH 1.8 to 2.5 for 1-2 hours) to reduce the bacterial contamination. After the acid wash 

the yeast is ready for the next fermentative cycle. The yeast cells can be submitted to two 

daily cycles during the annual sugarcane harvest season (200-250 days). Yeast cells must be 

tolerant to the stresses encountered during fermentation, such as high ethanol content, high 

temperature, osmotic pressure and cell recycling (BASSO et al., 2008). It is expected that 2G-

bioethanol production will utilize a similar industrial process and yeast cells will encounter 

stress condition present for 1G ethanol and 2G ethanol, such as organic acids and HMF. In 

addition, the yeast will need to be propagated during fermentations cycles to replace biomass 

that is lost during the centrifugation and acid-wash step. 

 In Brazil, a selection program was performed for 12 years hoping to select optimal 

yeast strains that are ideally suited for industrial ethanol production. Some of the desired traits 

are high ethanol yield, reduced glycerol and foam formation, maintenance of high viability 

during recycling, and long-term prevalence and persistence in the bioreactor. As a result of 

this selection program, a number of S. cerevisiae strains, such as BG-1, CAT-1, PE-2 and SA-

1 were identified, and became widely used in distilleries for many decades. Therefore, such 

strains were not suitable for 2G-ethanol production, but could be of great importance as 

biological material for a breeding program, generating better strains (BASSO et al., 2008).  

Mineral and organic nutrients are required for high cell viability maintenance, a 

crucial trait for a cell recycling process. Nevertheless the bagasse hydrolysate is devoid of 

such nutrients showing instead some yeast inhibitors formed and released during pretreatment 

(i.e. furfural, HMF, acetic acid). As an alternative, molasses can be blended with hydrolysate. 

Molasses will contribute with minerals (K, Mg, S, Ca, P, Zn, Cu, Mn, Al) (MORRISON, 

1959) and organic nutrients, such as amino acids, B group vitamins (HARRISON, 1971), 

organic acids (trans-aconitc, citric, malic, all contributing for a buffer effect) and fatty acids 

(linoleic, palmitic, oleic and linolenic) (GUTIERREZ; SILVA, 1993). Molasses also 

contributes for increased sugar concentration allowing a higher ethanol titer, and 

consequently lower energy consumption in the distillation step. On the other hand, molasses 

has some inhibitors compounds as HMF, sulfite, and toxic concentration of some minerals (K, 

Ca) affecting S. cerevisiae performance. All of the above considerations point to the need for 

new strains able to cope with inhibitors from both molasses and bagasse hydrolysate.

2.2 Genotypic and phenotypic diversity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains 

 

Currently, industrial strains represent only the tip of the “iceberg” of the genetic and 

phenotypic diversity present in natural S. cerevisiae isolates. Although it is possible to isolate 

additional strains as a source of genetic diversity, which could be used for breeding and 

selection, an alternative approach is to generate diversity artificially. A number of methods, 

such as mutagenesis, genome shuffling, adaptive evolution, and direct genetic modification 

could be used to develop 2G-ethanol production strains. These techniques can be used to 

select for specific traits and might lead to the generation of optimal strains more rapidly than 

traditional breeding and selection (STEENSELS et al., 2014). Many industrial strains often 

show aneuploidy, polyploidy, poor sporulation efficiency, and unstable mating type 

(homothallic); together, this makes it difficult to apply artificial diversity techniques 

(GIUDICI et al., 2005). In contrast, Brazilian industrial strains isolates from 1G-ethanol 

process are heterothallic (have stable mating types), diploid, and sporulate easily giving 

viable spores; together, these traits facilitate their genetic manipulation (ARGUESO et al., 

2009; ALEXANDRINO, 2012). 

Several different processes can generate genetic variation. Such processes include 

sexual reproduction, where the genomes of two parents are combined and shuffled by 

recombination. S. cerevisiae can undergo sexual reproduction and this can lead to the 

generation of new strains. In addition, S. cerevisiae can grow asexually, and spontaneous 

mutations can accumulate during mitotic growth (STEENSELS et al., 2014). 

Combining desirable characteristics by breeding and selection is a standard approach 

to improve the properties of sexual reproduction organisms (DARWIN, 1859 apud GIUDICI 

et al., 2005). Hybrids derived from different yeast strains may have better fitness and 

performance than either parental strain (i.e. heterosis). Hybridization of heterothallic yeast 

strains directly by micromanipulation or mixing of sporulated cultures was the first publish 

method of yeast strain improvement (WINGE &amp;amp; LAUSTEN, 1938; GIUDICI et al., 2005). 

Sexual hybridization (or reproduction) increases the evolutionary potential of a species 

(BUCKLING et al., 2009). Direct mating, mass mating or genome shuffling can be used to 

achieve hybridization in S. cerevisiae.  

Direct mating and selection of S. cerevisiae is a powerful approach to generate new 

strains, similar to selective breeding in agriculture. It consists of crossing two selected 

parents, each with desired phenotypes. If both parental strains are heterothallic, a prescreening 

of the stable vegetative haploid segregants of both parents can be carried out and the best 



!

!

20!

haploid segregant can be selected for hybridization (LINDEGREN; LINDEGREN, 1943). 

This technique is called “cell-to-cell” and consists of simply mixing cell cultures of the two 

selected haploids. In homothallic strain, no stable haploid segregants can be obtained, and the 

additional prescreening is not feasible (SIPICZKI, 2008).  

Although time-consuming, direct mating has proven to be an effective way to obtain 

hybrids that display desired phenotypes (SIPICZKI, 2008). For example, a hybrid of a haploid 

segregant of the Ethanol Red strain and an engineered inhibitor tolerant strain was used to 

develop an improved for fermentation of a mixture of glucose and xylose. This strain had a 

number of desirable traits, including faster growth rate in glucose medium, faster glucose 

consumption rate and higher ethanol accumulation capacity in very high gravity fermentation; 

also, it was able to metabolize a mixture of glucose and xylose (DEMEKE et al., 2013). 

Hybrids obtained by direct mating of flocculent strains of S. cerevisiae and cold-fermentation 

strains of S. uvarum, showed interesting characteristics for sparkling wines, such as less 

formation of fermentation products (i.e. glycerol, succinic acid, acetic acid, and malic acid) 

than the parental strains; fermentation at low temperatures and production of a wine that is 

highly aromatic (COLORETTI et al., 2006). Sipiczki (2008) had reported several works from 

different authors of interspecies hybrids obtained by direct mating of S. cerevisiae and S. 

uvarum wine strains, S. kudriavzevii and S. paradoxus. 

Mass mating is a technique in which a large number of haploid yeast cells, often from 

different parental strains are mixed and allowed to cross randomly. Mass mating has been 

used to generate industrial strains with improved characteristics (STEENSELS et al., 2014). 

Mass mating was used to create interspecific hybrids between different wine strains by 

crossing a top-fermenting S. cerevisiae strain with a cryophilic S. bayanus strain. The desired 

hybrid strain was then selected based on the combination of traits inherited from each parent, 

such as the ability to assimilate melibiose and growth at low temperature (20oC). The result of 

this interspecies hybridization was a new strain that exhibited both good low temperature 

fermentation and produce wine with new flavor characteristics (SATO et al., 2002). 

Genome shuffling is a technique related to mass mating that relies on repeated rounds 

of mating, sporulation, and selection to recombine desired traits from multiple parents into a 

single optimized strain (GONG et al., 2009; STEENSELS et al., 2014). Genome shuffling 

simulates the natural evolution process: once a mutation that confers an improved phenotype 

has arisen in the experimental population, the recombination tests it in association with all 

other beneficial traits already present, without all of these combinations having to be derived 

again. Moreover, the genome shuffling permits an efficient removal of a deleterious mutation 



!

!

21!

by replacing them with the wild type sequences, avoiding the hampering of general fitness 

(GIUDICI et al., 2005). Genome shuffling has been successfully applied as an effective 

whole-cell engineering approach for the rapid improvement of industrially important 

microbial phenotypes (GONG et al., 2009). Compared to other improvement techniques, 

genome shuffling has the advantage of exploiting the full genetic diversity in a population and 

makes it possible to combine useful mutations from many different individuals, while other 

hybridization methods, such as direct mating, typically involve only a limited number of 

haploid cells. Additionally, while traditional methods of strain improvement often select only 

the best-performing mutant for each subsequent round, genome shuffling exploits a much 

larger proportion of the diversity present in the population (STEENSELS et al., 2014). In this 

way, both laboratory and industrial S. cerevisiae strains have been selected for desired 

phenotypes such as ethanol tolerance, thermotolerance, acetic acid tolerance, and 

fermentation performance using genome shuffling. Some recent studies, reported by Steensels 

et al. (2014), combine metabolic engineering with genome shuffling (TAO et al., 2012; 

DEMEKE et al., 2013). These approaches are promising to optimize strains for second-

generation bioethanol production (STEENSELS et al., 2014). 

 

2.3 Mutagenesis  

 

Mutagenesis is often the first step in generating genetic variation in a cell or 

population, followed by sexual hybridization (direct mating, mass mating or genome 

shuffling) of the best-performing mutants (STEENSELS et al., 2014). Mutagenesis is 

commonly used to obtain interspecies hybrids for wine fermentation (GONZÁLES et al., 

2006; SIPICZKI, 2008), flocculent Saccharomyces strains for sparkling wines (COLORETTI; 

TINI, 2006), and for brewer’s yeast with desired characteristics (SATO et al., 2002). 

While mutations are induced with the same frequency in haploid, diploid or polyploid 

cells, they are not as easily detected in diploid or polyploid as in haploid cells because of the 

presence of non-mutated alleles. Only if the mutation is dominant will it affect the phenotype. 

Therefore, haploid derivatives are preferred for the mutagenesis program (PRETORIUS, 

2000). Because the rate of spontaneous mutation is low, approximately 10-6 per generation 

(PRETORIUS, 2000), the use of induced mutagenesis techniques, such as chemical of UV 

light is commonly used (GIUDICI et al., 2005). 

Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation is a physical process that damages DNA and induces 

mutations (IKEHATA; ONO, 2011). Short wave (UVC, 100-290 nm) causes a high quantity 



!

!

22!

of pyrimidine dimers, hydroxylated bases, and cross-linking of DNA strands (ROWLANDS, 

1984). A combination of UV irradiation and genome shuffling is a powerful strategy for 

strain improvement and had been used to improve thermotolerance, ethanol tolerance, and 

ethanol productivity of S. cerevisiae (SHI et al., 2008). For example, pools of S. cerevisiae 

haploid mutants were created by UV mutagenesis, then mated and subjected to five rounds of 

genome shuffling in order to generate strains that are tolerant to inhibitors present in 

hardwood spent sulfite liquor (PINEL et al., 2011). In another example, subjecting a pool of 

UV-induced variants to consecutive rounds of fermentation in very high gravity wort was 

used to obtain improved industrial yeast strains for lager brewing (BLIECK et al., 2007). 

   

2.4 Adaptive evolution 

 

Charles Darwin’s theory for the evolution of new species by natural selection is a long 

timescale process that can be observed in the fossil record. In the laboratory, microorganisms 

with a short generation time can be evolved for hundreds or even thousands of generations; 

therefore it is possible to generate new strains in a relatively short timespan. Adaptive 

evolution in the laboratory relies on genetic diversity and artificial selection, which is 

analogous to processes that occur in nature during the evolution of new species (BUCKLING 

et al., 2009) 

Strain improvement by evolutionary engineering, a term first described by Butler et al. 

(1996) and later referred to as adaptive, directed or experimental evolution, applies to the 

basic principles of natural, induced or both genetic variation (random mutation) and 

subsequent selection on this variation, allowing the organism to evolve the desired set of 

phenotypes. In sum, adaptive evolution, naturally selects a population adapted to a specific 

environment over time (NOVO et al., 2014).  

Adaptive evolution can also be combined with the use of mutagenesis, sexual 

hybridization or both within the evolving population in order to increase the genotypic and 

phenotypic variability that the selection can act on. When a specific mutation with fitness 

advantage occurs in a cell, this variant will be selected and enriched in the population 

(STEENSELS et al., 2014). Adaptive evolution is a feasible way to generate yeast strains 

with improved phenotypes because this microorganism has a short generation time and easy 

manipulation and cultivation in laboratory (ELENA; LENSKI, 2003; BUCKLING et al., 

2009; STEENSELS et al., 2014).  



!

!

23!

Adaptive evolution has proven to be a valuable tool to create yeast strains with 

specific improved characteristics (SAUER, 2001). Normally directed evolution is used to 

fine-tune a specific phenotype that is already present in the original population, but is not 

optimal yet (STEENSELS et al., 2014). Usually, adaptive evolution is performed for 100 to 

2000 generations and normally it takes a few weeks up to a few months of phenotypes 

competition for a dominance of suitable strain in the total population (DRAGOSITS; 

MATTANOVICH, 2013). Batch culture in shake flasks with serial transfers of cells to a new 

flask with fresh medium for an additional round of growth, or a continuous culture system 

such as a chemostat are different ways to setup an adaptive evolution experiment (Figure 1) 

(DRAGOSITS; MATTANOVICH, 2013; NOVO et al., 2014; STEENSELS et al., 2014). 

                                 a)            

                                       b)  
 
Figure 1 - Adaptive evolution experiment for microbial biotechnology: a) in batch culture shake flasks and b) 

continuous culture system - chemostat (DRAGOSITS; MATTANOVICH, 2013) 
 

Evolutionary engineering has successfully been used in a number of S. cerevisiae 

strains improvement studies (STEENSELS et al., 2014). Demeke et al. (2103) used this 

technique to select for a strain with improved xylose fermentation and inhibitor tolerance. In 

another example, long-term adaptive evolution (batch serial transfer for 450 generations) was 

used to select a S. cerevisiae wine strain with reduced ethanol content and increased glycerol 

levels. The resulting strain produced a wine with improved body and sweetness, which are 

characteristics desired by the wine industry (TILLOY et al., 2014). Adaptive evolution in 

shake flasks over 300 generations (more than 90 days) was also used to generate a S. 

cerevisiae strain with increased thermotolerance (CASPETA et al., 2014). In other examples, 

a home-made bioreactor was used to select an industrial yeast wine for enhanced growth 

under ethanol stress after 225 generations (NOVO et al., 2014). Finally evolutionary 

engineering has been used to improve acetic acid tolerance (an inhibitor widely present in 

plant hydrolysates) and xylose fermentation (BELLISSIMI et al., 2009; WRIGHT et al., 

2011).

24!

Adaptive evolution was recently demonstrated by an elegant method called visualizing 

evolution in real-time (VERT) (REYES et al., 2012). During adaptive evolution, mutants with 

increased performance (adaptive mutants) expand in the population. These adaptive events 

are identified by VERT, which uses differentially labeled fluorescent subpopulations and flow 

cytometry to monitor adaptive evolution in real-time (ALMARIO et al., 2013). 

 

2.5 Chromosomal rearrangements  

 

Chromosome rearrangements (CRs) may also represent a mechanism for evolution 

and adaptation of S. cerevisiae to environmental changes (LOPES, 2000). Variations that 

result in a difference in the size of the chromosomal DNA molecules can be caused by 

translocations, deletions or other genomic rearrangements. In addition, CRs are a known 

mechanism of generating strain variability in several fungal species (ZOLAN, 1995 apud 

LOPES, 2000).  

Chromosomal rearrangements have been observed in S. cerevisiae strains grown in an 

industrial fermenter. After an eight-month period of cell recycling, CRs were observed in the 

strain PE-2 (BASSO et al., 2008). During a given season (200-250 days) in a Brazilian 

distillery it is expected that an introduced starter strain will undergo anywhere from 60 to 70 

generations of growth (considering a 10% (w/v) yeast growth for each fermentation cycle, 

and two fermentation cycles per day) if the strain is able to persist in the bioreactor. In 

laboratory, CRs of a diploid wine strain were observed after 55 generations of mitotic growth. 

After 275 generations, about half of the population was represented by 11 different CRs 

(LONGO; VÉZINHET, 1993). Sporulation followed by germination and growth in rich 

medium allowed PE-2 strain to exhibit the same CRs as found in the industrial setting, 

suggesting that both mitotic growth and sporulation might have contributed to the different 

chromosomal karyotypes observed in various distilleries that used PE-2 as the starting strain 

(LOPES, 2000). The environmental conditions outside the fermentation tank could allow 

sporulation to occur and then new recombinant spores might settle again into the fermentation 

mixture and germinate, resulting in the production of new hybrids strains. 

It has been suggested that the unique selective pressures of each industrial process 

(such as wining, baking, distilling, etc.) leads to the generation of strains specifically adapted 

to their environment (CODÓN et al., 1998; INFANTE et al., 2003; SIPICZKI, 2011). In 

several occasions, CRs were correlated with improved yeast fitness to stressful process 

conditions, such as SO2 tolerance (ORTÍN et al., 2002), glucose limitation (DUNHAM et al., 



!

!

25!

2002; COLSON et al., 2004), starvation (COYLE; KROLL, 2008), and Cu tolerance 

(CHANG et al., 2013). Most of the studies on yeast adaptation were performed with wine 

strains or wine conditions and “due to its unique plasticity, the wine yeast genome can change 

easily both during vegetative propagation (mitotic divisions) and in the sexual cycle (meiosis-

sporulation-conjugation). During fermentation, the genomes of certain vegetatively 

propagating yeast cells undergo multiple, successive mutations and gross genomic 

rearrangements, resulting in a variety of clones with different genomes, some of them with 

beneficial changes that have become fixed in the evolution of certain populations” 

(SIPICZKI, 2011). 

Similar to wine strains, adaptive evolution mediated by CRs has been observed in fuel 

ethanol strains (BASSO et al., 2008). In both cases, the specific advantage(s) conferred by 

these CRs is not understood. 

 

2.6 Engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae for xylose fermentation 

 

Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is currently being used to produce ethanol, does not 

natively assimilate xylose (HAHN-HAGERDAL et al., 2006 apud KIM et al., 2013a). 

Currently two xylose-assimilation pathways have been used to engineer S. cerevisiae for 

xylose fermentation: xylose isomerase (XI) pathway (found in both bacteria and fungi), and 

the xylose reductase (XR) and xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH) pathway (genes from 

Schefferomyces stipitis). Both pathways require overexpression of xylulose kinase (XK), 

which connects xylulose to the endogenous pentose phosphate pathway of S. cerevisiae 

(Figure 2). Although the XR/XDH pathway has two intrinsic defects, including xylitol 

secretion and unbalanced cofactor requirements during anaerobic fermentation, its 

thermodynamic advantage compared to XI pathway results in faster xylose assimilation and 

greater ethanol production (KARHUMAA et al., 2007; KIM et al., 2013a). The XI pathway is 

of interest because it can be used for anaerobic xylose fermentation (KUYPER et al., 2005). 

A number of studies have been performed to optimize the XR/XDH pathway (KOTTER et 

al., 1990; TANTIRUNGKIL et al., 1993; WALFRIDSSON et al., 1995; HO et al., 1998; 

TOIVARI et al., 2001). In one recent example, a combination of rational and evolutionary 

engineering was used to optimize xylose fermentation. In their work, expression levels of 

xylose reductase (XYL1), xylitol dehydrogenase (XYL2) and xylulokinase (XYL3) had to be 

increased, in addition to deletion of the PHO13 and ALD6 genes. Together, these changes 

allowed for simultaneous fermentation of glucose and xylose at various concentrations (KIM 



!

!

26!

et al., 2013b). In addition to optimization of the XR/XDH pathway, additional genome 

modifications have been made to reconfigure yeast metabolism in order to improve xylose 

fermentation (HA et al., 2011). Even with optimization of xylose fermentation, efficient co-

fermentation of glucose and xylose is still problematic, exhibiting a long lag time to 

metabolize xylose. Co-fermentation of xylose and cellobiose has been developed as a possible 

solution (KIM et al., 2013b). 

             
 

Figure 2 - Xylose-assimilation pathways for S. cerevisiae: xylose isomerase (XI) and xylose reductase/xylitol 
dehydrogenase (XR/XDH). Both pathways require overexpression of xylulose kinase (XK), which 
connects xylulose to the endogenous pentose phosphate pathway of S. cerevisiae (KIM et al., 2013b) 

 

2.7 CRISPR-Cas9 

 

 Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR 

associated protein 9 (Cas9) are natural adaptive immunity systems present in bacteria and 

archaea for defense against invading foreign nucleic acids (i.e. virus and plasmids) (ISHINO 

et al., 1987). The Cas9 protein from Streptococus pyogenes is a RNA-guided endonuclease 

that catalyzes site-specific cleavage of double stranded DNA (JINEK et al., 2012). The 

CRISPR-Cas9 has been engineered into a powerful technology for “genome editing”. 

Induction of a specific DSB (double strand break) leads to activation of DNA repair 

pathways, which are the non-homology end-joining pathway (NHEJ) or homology directed 

repair (HDR). In the absence of a homologous repair template, NHEJ predominates and 

results in small INDELs in the target sequence. Providing a homologous repair template (or 

donor DNA) allows for high efficiency, markerless genome modifications to be made, such as 

precise mutations and knock-ins (GONG et al., 2005; CONG et al., 2013; HWANG et al., 

2013) (Figure 3). 



!

!

27!

The CRISPR/Cas9 system can be used to generate markerless loss-of-function alleles, 

insertion of heterologous alleles, allele swaps and engineered proteins in yeast by in vivo 

selection (DICARLO et al., 2013; RYAN et al., 2014). Cas9 is a relatively new and powerful 

tool for engineering yeast genomes.  

                   
Figure 3 – Illustration of CRISPR-Cas9 system genome editing 
 

2.8 Polygenic Analysis 

 

 The phenotypic variation between strains can be categorized as qualitative or 

quantitative (FALCONER; MACKAY, 1996 apud SWINNEN et al., 2012). Qualitative, or 

Mendelian traits are controlled by a single gene (or locus) and have a simple pattern of 

inheritance (SWINNEN et al., 2012). In contrast, most phenotypic traits are complex (or 

quantitative), and controlled by multiple genes (or loci). The genomic regions that underlie a 

complex trait are referred to as quantitative trait loci (QTL) (ABIOLA et al., 2003). Stress 

tolerance, heat tolerance (PARTS et al., 2011) and ethanol tolerance (HU et al., 2011) are 

examples of quantitative traits in S. cerevisiae. Hence, each QTL contributes a portion of the 

phenotype. Each QTL may include a single causative gene (QTG), or nucleotide (QTN), or a 

combination of multiple QTGs and QTNs (MACKAY, 2001; SWINNEN et al., 2012). 

Identifying QTLs for complex traits can be challenging; however, in S. cerevisiae a number 

of high-resolution QTL mapping methods have been established (PARTS et al., 2011). QTL 

mapping is performed by mating two strains that differ in a specific trait of interest, a parental 

strain possessing the trait and another lacking that trait (BOONE et al., 2007; SWINNEN et 

al., 2012).  



!

!

28!

 QTL depends on a large number of genotypes segregants; however, genotyping each 

segregant individually is laborious and expensive. An elegant strategy is genotyping the 

whole pool (MICHELMORE et al., 1991). This technique called bulk-segregant analysis 

(BSA) genotypes two pools (or bulks) – the selected pool and the control pool. The selected 

pool contains a large number of segregants that expresses the trait of interest, while the 

control pool contains similar number of segregants that were not selected for the trait 

(EDWARDS; GIFFORD, 2012; SWINNEN et al., 2012). 

 The extreme (X-QTL) method is similar to BSA, and relies on selection of a large 

pool of haploid segregants from a cross, using mating-type specific auxotrophy 

(EHRENREICH et al., 2010). The segregant pool is then subjected either to growth under a 

strong selective condition (which selects for the extreme of the phenotypic distribution) or a 

control condition (without selective pressure). Changes in allele frequency are calculated and 

used to calculate QTL intervals (PARTS et al, 2011). Therefore, QTL mapping is based on 

three steps: i) generation of a segregating population; ii) phenotype selection of these 

populations; iii) quantitative measurement of the pool allele frequency (Figure 4). While 

traditional QTL mapping uses a population size of 102 segregants, high-resolution extreme 

QTL (X-QTL) uses a much larger population size (107) (EHRENREICH et al., 2010). Using 

this large population size, it is possible to effectively sample many more recombination 

breakpoints; therefore, it is possible to map QTL intervals down to single gene resolution 

(PARTS et al, 2011). One QTL intervals are calculated, either reciprocal hemizygosity 

analysis (STEINMETZ et al., 2002) or allele swapping (LITI; LOUIS, 2012) can be used to 

narrow down each QTL intervals and indentify the QTG(s) or QTN(s) that underlie the 

complex trait. 

 
Figure 4 - QTL overall strategy - showing three-step QTL mapping strategy by crossing two phenotypically 

different strains to create a segregating pool of individuals of various fitness, and growing the pool in 
a restrictive condition that enriches for beneficial alleles that can be detected via sequencing total 
DNA from the pool (PARTS et al., 2011)

3 OBJECTIVE 

 

The aim of the present study was to generate new strains for efficient second-

generation ethanol fermentation using 1G-strains (CAT-1, PE-1 and SA-1) as a starting point. 

A breeding and selection program was developed based on direct mating and mass mating, 

mutagenesis and adaptive evolution. These methods were used to generate new hybrids S. 

cerevisiae strains that had desirable industrial traits, including hydrolysate tolerance. The 

second goal was to understand the genetic basis of hydrolysate tolerance by quantitative trait 

loci (QTL) mapping.

4 MATERIAL AND METHODS 

 
4.1 Direct mating 

 
4.1.1 Tetrad dissection  

 

S. cerevisiae strains (PE-2, CAT-1 and SA-1) were streaked on YPD-A (1% yeast 

extract, 1% peptone, 2% dextrose, 2% agar) and kept at 30oC for 48 hours. Cells were 

streaked on raffinose-acetate sporulation medium (0.02% of raffinose, 0.3% of potassium 

acetate, 2% of agar) and incubated at 30°C for 7 days until sporulation occurred. Using a 

sterile stick a portion of the sporulated cells were added to 1 µL of zymolyase enzyme 

(ZymoReasearch® 10 units/uL), 3 µL of mercaptoethanol and 296 µL buffer, in a 1.5 mL 

Eppendorf® tube and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. Treated cells were 

streaked using a new sterile stick on a new YPD-A plate. Tetrads were dissected using a 

micromanipulator (Carl Zeiss Scope A1 AXIO) and the mating type of isolated spores 

determined (MORTIMER et al., 1969) using testers strains. 

 

4.1.2 Stock culture preservation and growth media 

 

 Yeast stock cultures were maintained at -80oC in YPD (1% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 

2% dextrose) supplemented with 15% glycerol.  The following media were used for selection 

experiments in microplate reader: i) molasses-selective medium (15% total reduced sugar 

from molasses (TRS), 8% (v/v) of absolute ethanol, 0.6 g/L acetic acid, pH 4); ii) molasses-

hydrolysate medium I (16.6% TRS (31% of the sugar came from Novozymes hydrolysate), 

5.1 g/L acetic acid, 0.79 g/L furfural, 0.23 g/L HMF, pH 4.5-5); and iii) molasses-hydrolysate 

medium II (13% TRS, 3.6% (v/v) of absolute ethanol, pH 5, and the same content of acetic 

acid, furfural, and HMF). The ethanol added in medium iii had proposed to simulate a cell 

recycling fermentation process when fermentation starts with pre-formed ethanol. In media ii 

and iii molasses was blended with Novozymes hydrolysate and diluted for the desirable sugar 

concentrations. Cellobiose and pentose sugars were not taken into account. 

 
4.1.3 Direct mating of haploids from the same tetrad  

Four perfect tetrads (three from PE-2 and one from CAT-1), each containing four 

viable ascospores, were crossed according to their mating-type (LINDEGREN; 



!

!

32!

LINDEGREN, 1943) and 73 strains were obtained from among haploids of the same tetrad. 

The strains were evaluated by optical density measurements at 570 nm (OD570nm) and 

maximum specific growth rate (µmax) was calculated according to Tahara et al. (2013), in 

two different media: i) molasses-selective medium; and ii) molasses-hydrolysate medium I, in 

a 96-well microplate. The plate was set up in technical replicates with 90 µL of medium and 

10 µL of fresh cell culture (pre-grown in 3 mL of a YPD overnight culture) using PE-2, CAT-

1 and SA-1 as reference strains.  Growth experiments were performed in a TECAN Infinite® 

200 Pro Series plate reader at 30°C, and OD570nm was measured every 2 hours for 24 hours.  

Before each time point the plate was shaken for 10 minutes. 

 After screening 73 strains in the molasses-selective and molasses-hydrolysate (I) 

media, 26 strains were selected for additional screening in molasses-hydrolysate medium II, 

using the 96-well microplate assay described above. After this second-round of screening, 

four strains were selected for batch fermentation analysis (see Section 4.3).  

 
4.1.4 Ultraviolet irradiation and pre-screening of irradiated haploids  

 
Eleven haploids (derived from CAT-1, PE-2 and SA-1 after sporulation and tetrad 

dissection (see Section 4.1.1 above) of large colony size were selected by plating on YPD-A 

and each isolate was then grown overnight in 10 mL of YPD broth. Each overnight culture 

was then diluted to a starting OD 0.3 using 10 mL of fresh YPD broth and grown until log 

phase (~3-4 hours).  Five mL of each log phase culture were irradiated using ultraviolet (UV) 

light at 254 nm for 15 minutes at a distance of 30 cm (RESNICK, 1969). After UV irradiation 

each culture was plated on YPM-A (2% of total sugar from molasses, 600 mg/L acetic acid, 

5% added ethanol and pH 5), and kept in the dark to avoid photo-reactivation repair, at 30oC 

for 48 hours. Around 15 colonies from each irradiated haploid culture were selected based on 

fast growth (i.e. larger colony size). The selected 151 irradiated colonies were then evaluated 

in molasses-selective medium using a 96-well microplate assay (see Section 4.1.3 above) and 

21 irradiated haploids were selected based on growth (OD570nm and µmax) after 24 hours. 

 
4.1.5 Direct mating of irradiated haploids and pre-screening of the resulting hybrids  

 
The 21 UV-irradiated haploids selected above (Section 4.1.4) were then mated to each 

other based on their mating types. A small portion of cells freshly grown on YPD-A was 

mixed with another small portion of freshly grown cells of opposite mating type. After 4 

hours, a small fraction of the mating mixture was then streaked on a new YPD-A plate to

isolate zygotes (LINDEGREN; LINDEGREN, 1943). A total of 234 zygotes (UV-hybrids) 

were isolated using a micromanipulator (Carl Zeiss Scope A1 AXIO) and evaluated for 

growth (OD570nm and µmax) in a 96-well microplates using two different media: i) molasses-

selective medium, and ii) molasses-hydrolysate medium I.  After screening in these two 

media types, 125 UV-hybrids were selected for a second-round screening in molasses-

hydrolysate medium II.  After this second-round screening, six UV-hybrids were selected for 

a third round of screening by batch fermentation (see Section 4.3 below). 

 
4.2 Mass mating followed by adaptive evolution 

 
4.2.1 Mass mating 

 
A series of intra-strain and inter-strain matings were performed by mixing 100 µL of 

each haploid (first grown overnight in 3 mL of YPD at 30oC) in 250 mL erlenmeyer flasks 

containing 100 mL of YPD. Using haploids derived from PE-2, CAT-1, and SA-1, the 

following mass matings were performed: 91 haploids from PE-2 (P pool), 89 haploids from 

CAT-1 (C pool), 50 haploids from SA-1 (S pool), 180 haploids from PE-2 and CAT-1 (PC 

pool), 141 haploids from PE-2 and SA-1 (PS pool), 139 haploids from CAT-1 and SA-1 (CS 

pool), and 230 haploids from PE-2, CAT-1 and SA-1 (PCS pool). These seven different mass 

mating pools were maintained at 30oC for 48 hours (ALEXANDRINO, 2012).  

 
4.2.2 Adaptive evolution  

 
Seven different pools (P, C, S, PC, PS, CS and PCS) were subjected to about 100 

generations of laboratory evolution with an increasing concentration of sugar (from 10% to 

14%), ethanol (from 3% to 5.5%), and acetic acid (300 to 400 mg/L, pH 4 to 3.7).   Fifteen 

successive transfers (Figure 5) were performed over the course of 80 days by inoculating 1 

mL of cell culture from a saturated culture into 127 mL of fresh growth media according to 

the Table 1.

4.2.3 Karyotyping  

 
After the last transfer, the evolved pools were recovered by plating on YPD-A and 

incubating at 30oC for 48 hours. Fifteen colonies from each recovered pool were karyotyped 

by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) (BLONDIN; VÈZINHET, 1988; modified 

according to BASSO et al., 2008) (BioRad/CHEF-DR®III System), and grouped according to 

their electrophoretic profile (VÈZINHET et al., 1990; BASSO et al., 2008). Thirty colonies 

from the PCS pool were selected because this population can show higher variance 

(phenotypic and genotypic). However, only 15 colonies were karyotyped. Fifteen colonies 

from the original parent strains PE-2, CAT-1 and SA-1 were also karyotyped for comparison. 

 
4.2.4 Pre-screening of evolved strains  

 
One hundred and twenty strains derived from mass mating and adaptive laboratory 

evolution (Section 4.2.2 and 4.2.3) and 45 colonies from the parent strains (PE-2, CAT-1 and 

SA-1) were evaluated for their growth by measuring optical density at 570 nm (OD570nm) and 

maximum specific growth rate (µ an) in molasses-selective medium and molasses-hydrolysate 

medium I. Based on growth in these two media, 71 strains were selected for a second-round 

screening in molasses-hydrolysate medium II.  After this second-round screening, 14 strains 

were selected for batch fermentation studies (see Section 4.3 below) (Figure 6).

4.3 Batch fermentation screening with cell recycling (Brazilian fed-batch process)  

 
A total of 427 strains were generated by either direct mating or mass mating (see 

Figure 6 above).  After two rounds of screening, 24 strains were identified, which had the best 

growth (OD570nm) for screening by batch fermentation with cell recycling.  The parent strains 

PE-2, CAT-1, SA-1 and Mauri (baker's yeast) were also screened for comparison.  The final 

set of 24 strains included: four strains derived from direct mating of haploids from the same 

tetrad, six strains from direct mating of UV-irradiated haploids and fourteen strains derived 

from mass mating followed by adaptive laboratory evolution. The batch fermentation 

experiments were performed to simulate, to some extent, the conditions encountered in a 

Brazilian industrial distillery. Five fermentation cycles were performed, and the whole 

biomass was reused in each subsequent fermentation.  The following parameters were 

estimated (ethanol titer, biomass gain, glycerol content, residual sugar, cell viability, cellular

trehalose, and cellular glycogen contents) and used to select strains for detailed genetic and 

genomic studies (see Sections 4.4.7 and 4.4.8 below). 

 
4.3.1 Propagation medium  

 
Propagation medium was prepared by diluting cane molasses to 15% TRS, centrifuged 

(10,000 rpm for 20 minutes at room temperature) to remove the insoluble material, and the 

supernatant sterilized (121oC for 25 minutes). Once cooled, it was stored at -20°C until ready 

to use.  

 
4.3.2 Starting strains  

 
Twenty-four selected strains (see Section 4.3) and four reference strains (PE-2, CAT-

1, SA-1 and Mauri) were first grown to saturation in 5 mL YPD broth and then the whole 

volume was added to 100 mL of propagation medium and growth for 24 hours at 30oC. The 

necessary yeast biomass (1g wet weigh) was collected by centrifuging at 800 x g at room 

temperature for 15 minutes and then used for the first fermentation cycle.  

 

4.3.3 Novozymes bagasse hydrolysate 

 
 Sugarcane bagasse was pre-treated by steam explosion (STEX) with dilute phosphoric 

acid (9.5 mg H3PO4/g dry solids) at 180oC for 5 minutes. The pretreated material (both liquor 

and solid cellulose-lignin) was then digested with the Cellic® CTec3 enzyme mixture at 50oC 

for 72 hours (Novozymes Latin America Ltd).  The resulting bagasse hydrolysate (called 

Novozymes hydrolysate) has 18% total solids, 69.3 g/L of glucose, 38 g/L of xylose, 4.3 g/L 

of cellobiose, 2.9 g/L of arabinose; 6.8 g/L of acetic acid, 1.05 g/L of furfural and 0.3 g/L of 

HMF. 

 
4.3.4 Molasses-hydrolysate fermentation medium 

 
The fermentation medium was prepared by mixing molasses with Novozymes 

hydrolysate, in a way that 31% of the TRS came from the hydrolysate.  The medium was 

centrifuged at 10,000 rpm and 20°C for 20 minutes. The pellet was discarded and supernatant 

was sterilized (121oC for 25 minutes) in hermetic condition to avoid loss of acetic acid and 

aldehydes. Once cooled, it was stored at -20°C until ready to use.  Before use ethanol was

added  (3.6% - v/v), the pH was adjusted to 4.8 using 5N H2SO4, and 3 mg/L antibiotic 

Kamoran® was added. 

 

4.3.5 Fermentation  

 

Fermentations were conducted in 15 mL conical tubes initially containing ~1 g of wet 

biomass (i.e. pelleted yeast with 25% dry matter) using 10 mL molasses-hydrolysate 

fermentation medium. The first and second cycles were started with 6.5% TRS. The third and 

fourth cycles were started with 9.8% TRS (total reduced sugar), and the fifth cycle with 7.7% 

TRS. 

Fermentation experiments were conducted at 30°C at the end of each fermentation 

cycle the biomass was separated from the fermented medium by centrifugation (800 x g for 

20 minutes), weighed and used for a subsequent fermentation cycle (for a total of five cycles).  

The supernatant was stored at -20oC for further analysis (ethanol, residual sugars, xylitol and 

glycerol). Yeast cell viability was estimated at the end of the second to fifth fermentation 

cycles, while cell trehalose and glycogen contents were determined only at the end of the fifth 

fermentation cycle. 

 
4.3.6 Yeast cell viability estimation 

 

Yeast cell viability was estimated by optical microscopy using differential erythrosine 

staining of cells (OLIVEIRA et al., 1996). Viable cells (not stained) and non-viable cells 

(stained pink) were counted in a Neubauer chamber, and viability expressed as a percentage 

of total cells counted (OLIVEIRA et al., 1996).  

 
4.3.7 Biomass estimation 

 
The (wet) biomass was estimated by weighing the pelleted cells, after the 

centrifugation step. 

 
 
4.3.8 Ethanol content estimation in centrifuged wine 

 
The alcoholic content was determined, transferring 5 mL of centrifuged fermented 

must, into the micro Kjeldahl distillation apparatus and proceeded to drag steam distillation 

by collecting the condensate (distillate) in 25 mL volumetric flask. The density of the 



!

!

38!

distillate was measured using a digital densiometer (ANTON PAAR - DMA48) and ethanol 

content was calculated according (ZAGO et al., 1996).  

 
4.3.9 Xylitol, glycerol and residual sugars determination in the centrifuged fermented 

must 

 
Xylitol, glycerol and residual sugars (glucose, fructose, sucrose) were measured by 

high performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) using an ion exchange 

chromatograph (DIONEX - DX-300) equipped with a CarboPac PA-1 column 4 x 250 mm 

and a pulsed amperometric detector. The mobile phase used was 100 mM NaOH at a flow 

rate of 0.9 mL/min (BASSO et al., 2008).  

 
4.3.10 Glycogen extraction and quantification  

 
The glycogen content was estimated by the method of Becker (1978) and modified 

according to Rocha-Leão et al. (1984). Wet biomass (200 mg) was transferred to a test tube 

with a screw cap and washed with 5 mL of ice-cold distilled water. The tubes were then 

centrifuged at 3,500 rpm at room temperature for 6 minutes. The supernatant was discarded. 

The washed biomass pellet was then resuspended in 2 mL of freshly prepared 0.25 M 

Na2CO3. Tubes were sealed with a screw cap and boiled in a water bath for 90 minutes. 

Quantification of glycogen was performed using an enzyme-coupled (glucose oxidase and 

peroxidase) colorimetric assay (BECKER, 1978) (absorbance at 500 nm) based on glucose 

release after enzymatic hydrolysis of the glycogen with amyloglucosidase. 

 
4.3.11 Extraction and quantification of trehalose  

 
Washed, wet yeast biomass (200 mg) was extracted with 2 mL of 0.5 M 

trichloroacetic acid in an ice bath for 20 minutes with constant agitation (TREVELYAN; 

HARRISON, 1956). After 20 minutes, the tubes were centrifuged, and the supernatant stored 

in 1.5 mL Eppendorf® tubes at -20°C until the time of analysis. Quantification of trehalose 

was performed using HPAEC, as described by Basso et al. (2008), using a DIONEX ion 

chromatograph (Model DX-300) using the same protocol as for the determination of glycerol 

and residual sugars.

4.4 Pre-screening for Miscanthus x giganteus lignocellulosic hydrolysate substrate  

 
Three hybrid yeast strains (133, 272, 409) showing good tolerance and fermentation 

characteristics in molasses-hydrolysate medium (both feedstocks derived from sugar cane) 

together with their respective parent haploids were used for further screening in Miscanthus x 

giganteus hydrolysate and genetic studies at the University of California Berkeley. 

 
4.4.1 Stock culture preservation 

 
Stock cultures were maintained in YPD and 15% glycerol at -80oC using 2 mL 

Corning® cryogenic vials.  

 
4.4.2 Miscanthus x giganteus hydrolysate 

 
 Hydrolysate was obtained from the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) with the 

following conditions: Miscanthus x giganteus plant material (around 1 inch size) was 

pretreated with 1.5% (w/w) sulfuric acid at a 25% (w/w) biomass loading at 190°C for 

approximately 1 minute, and then the pressure was rapidly released. The liquid phase after 

filtration is referred to as hydrolysate. The hydrolysate thus obtained was stored at -20°C.   

Aliquots of hydrolysate were then adjusted to pH 5.5 with 3M KOH, centrifuged at 

4,000 rpm at room temperature for 10 minutes in an Eppendorf® 5810R centrifuge to remove 

insoluble material, then filter sterilized using a 0.2 micron filter system (Corning® Filter 

System).  After pH adjustment and filtering, the hydrolysate (now considered 100% by 

volume) was aliquoted again and stored at -80oC until use.  

The composition of the hydrolysate was determined by Greer et al. (2014). The M. 

giganteus hydrolysate from NREL has the following sugar composition: 21.39 g/L of glucose, 

50.44 g/L of xylose, 4.65 g/L arabinose. The following inhibitors were quantified: 1.08 g/L 

succinic acid, 0.09 g/L of lactic acid, 0.98 g/L formic acid, 9.71 g/L acetic acid, 1.05 g/L of 

levulinic acid, 0.83 g/L HMF, 1.88 g/L furfural, and 0.22 g/L glycerol.

4.4.3 Screening of selected hybrids and their haploids for growth in M. giganteus 

hydrolysate  

 
The reference diploid strains (S288C, CAT-1, PE-2 and SA-1), three selected hybrids 

(133, 272 and 409), and their haploid parents were evaluated in synthetic complete medium

containing 80 g/L of glucose (SC-80) supplemented with 20, 25, 30 or 50% (v/v) of M. 

giganteus hydrolyzate. SC-80 media contains: 80 g/L of glucose (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 g/L of 

complete dropout mix without YNB (US Biological), 6.7 g/L of yeast nitrogen base without 

amino acids (BD), 19.5 g/L of MES buffer (Sigma-Aldrich), pH adjusted to 5.5 with 3 M 

NaOH.  Strains were streaked on YPD-A from the -80oC stock culture and grown at 30oC for 

48 hours. To test biological replicates, three colonies from each strain were grown overnight 

(30oC, 150 rpm) in separate test tubes containing 10 mL of SC-80 broth.  The 96-well 

microplate growth assay was set up using 130µL of medium and 20 µL of fresh cell culture 

diluted in sterile deionized water to have initial OD600nm of 0.3 in final volume of 150 µL and 

final concentration of 1xSC-80. Growth was evaluated by measuring the OD at 600 nm every 

15 minutes for 72 hours using a Tecan Sunrise, in aerobic (under oxygen-limited condition), 

anaerobic or both conditions, at 30°C with continuous shaking (orbital shaker, frequency of 

9.2 Hz; with an amplitude of 4.4 mm).  Anaerobic experiments were set up into an anaerobic 

chamber (Coy Laboratory/Airlock). 

 
4.4.4 Tetrads dissection of selected hybrids and mating type identification 

 
To identify whether the strains were heterothallic or homothallic, three selected 

hybrids (133, 272 and 409) and the reference strain SA-1, were sporulated, tetrads dissected, 

and the mating type of the spore clones identified by PCR as Huxley et al. (1990).  

 
4.4.4.1 Sporulation and tetrad dissection  

 
The reference strain SA-1 and hybrids 133, 272 and 409 were streaked on YPD-A and 

grown at 30°C for 48 hours. After growth of isolated colonies, one colony of each strain was 

grown in 10 mL of YPD broth overnight on a roller wheel at 30°C.  The overnight culture 

was then diluted back to OD600nm 0.225 in 10 mL of fresh YPD and grown until log phase 

(OD600nm 0.6 to 0.8). The culture was then centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 10 minutes in 

Eppendorf® 5810R centrifuge, the cell pellet washed twice in 10 mL of sterile deionized 

water, and then resuspended in 10 mL of 1% potassium acetate medium to induce sporulation. 

Cultures were sporulated at room temperature for ten days on a roller wheel. 

After confirmation of cell sporulation using a microscope Zeiss Axio Scope A1, yeast 

cells (1 mL) were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 3 minutes using an 

Eppendorf® 5424 centrifuge. Cells were washed with 1 mL of Y1 Qiagen® buffer (yeast 

lysis buffer), and then resuspended in 1 mL Y1 Qiagen® buffer containing 1 µL of zymolyase 



!

41!

enzyme (ZymoReasearch® 10 units/µL) and incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes. After 

zymolyase treatment the samples were kept in an ice batch.  An aliquot of 10 µL was spread 

on YPD-A plate, and tetrads were dissected using a micromanipulator (Singer MSM System 

400).  

 
4.4.4.2 Mating type identification by PCR 

 
After growth of spore clones on YPD-A plate, the mating type of 34 putative haploids 

was determined by PCR. Each putative haploid was purified by restreaking on YPD-A and 

grown at 30°C for 48 hours. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated using a YeaStar® Genomic 

DNA Kit™. The integrity of the gDNA was confirmed by electrophoresis on an E-Gel 0.8% 

agarose containing ethidium bromide (Invitrogen, Life). The master mixture for one PCR 

reaction was prepared with 13 µL sterile deionized water, 21 µL of 3M Betaine (Sigma-

Aldrich), 1 µL dimethyl-sulphoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich), 5 µL 10x NEB TAQ buffer, 1 

µL dNTPs (10 mM of each dNTP), 5 µL gDNA (10 ng/µL), 4 µL of 10 µM primer mixture 

and 0.25 µL NEB TAQ. The primer mixture was prepared with primer MAT1 (5'-

AGTCACATCAAGATCGTTTATGG-3’), primer MAT2 (5'-

GCACGGAATATGGGACTACTTCG-3’) and primer MAT3 (5'-

ACTCCACTTCAAGTAAGAGTTTG-3’). PCR was performed using an Applied Biosystems 

Veriti™ thermal cycler with the following program: initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 

minutes; 30 cycles at 94°C for 30 seconds, 55oC for 30 seconds, 72°C for 2 minutes; and final 

extension at 72°C for 10 minutes (HUXLEY et al., 1990).  

After PCR and electrophoresis, the mating type (MATa, MAT?, or MAT a/?) was 

determined; all 34 spore clones were found to be haploid. The 34 haploids were then 

restreaked on YPD-A plates, gDNA isolated and the PCR repeated.  All 34 clones showed the 

same mating type as previously determined, confirming that they are stable haploids.  After 

sporulation and tetrad dissection the mating locus segregated with a 2:2 ratio for all three 

hybrids and SA-1; therefore, all of the tested strains were heterothallic diploids.  

 

 
4.4.5 Screening of haploid segregants from hybrid (272) for M. giganteus hydrolysate 

tolerance 

 
A total of 47 haploid segregants (derived from 12 tetrads) were obtained by 

sporulation and tetrad dissection.  Each haploid was screened for hydrolysate tolerance in SC-

80 medium supplemented with 50% (v/v) of M. giganteus hydrolyate grown under anaerobic 

conditions in a 96-well microplate format as described above. For comparison, three 

references strains were used: S288C, SA-1 and hybrid 272. The haploid segregant 272-1a 

(derived from the hybrid 272) and SA-1 were the most tolerant strains identified and were 

selected for further studies.  

 
4.4.6 Competent cells  

 
Competent cells of S. cerevisiae were prepared using a lithium acetate (LiAc) protocol 

(GIETZ; WOODS, 2002). Stock cultures of diploid SA-1 and haploid 272-1a (segregant 

derived from the 272 hybrid) were first streaked on YPD-A and grown at 30oC for 48 hours. 

After growth of individual colonies, a single colony was propagated overnight in 10 mL of 

YPD broth at 30°C with shaking at 150 rpm. In a 250 mL erlenmeyer flask, the cell 

suspension was diluted to OD600nm of 0.3 using 100 mL of fresh YPD and grown (as above) 

until OD600nm reached 1 to 1.2. The yeast cells were then pelleted in 50 mL falcon tube 

(Corning®) at 4,000 rpm for 2 minutes in an Eppendorf® 5810R centrifuge. The supernatant 

was discarded; the cells were then re-suspended in 500 µL lithium acetate 0.1 M in TE buffer 

(10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 Invitrogen, 1 mM EDTA) (LATE). The cell suspension was 

transferred to 1.5 mL Eppendorf® tubes, centrifuged at 6,000 rpm for 2 minutes in 

Eppendorf® 5424 centrifuge and the supernatant discarded. The washed cell pellet was 

resuspended in 300 µL of LATE and 300 µL of glycerol 40%. The tubes were mixed and 

aliquoted (90 µL per tube) in 1.5 mL Eppendorf® tubes and stored at -80oC until they were 

used for transformations (GIETZ; WOODS, 2002).  

 
4.4.7 Transformation for pentose fermentation  

 
4.4.7.1 X123 cassette insertion using Cas9  

 
A three-gene cassette (X123), which encodes three enzymes necessary for xylose 

fermentation XYL1 (XR, xylose reductase), XYL2 (XDH, xylitol dehydrogenase) and XYL3 

(xylulokinase) (KIM et al. 2013a), was integrated into the URA3 locus using a one-step, 

markerless protocol mediated by Cas9 (OWEN et al., 2014). The X123 DNA (donor DNA) 

was co-transformed into SA-1 and 272-1a along with a Cas9 plasmid (pCas9) that expresses 

an sgRNA with a specific 20nt sequence targeting the URA3 locus 

(ACGTTACAGAAAAGCAGGCT).  The 20nt guide directs Cas9 to generate a double-

stranded DNA break at the targeted locus (URA3 in this case), which greatly increases the 

frequency of homologous recombination.   

 Yeast transformation was adapted from Gietz and Woods (2002). The transformation 

mixture was prepared in 1.5 mL tubes with 90 µL competent cells (see above), 10 µL salmon 

sperm DNA Life Technologies® (ssDNA) previously heated to 100°C for 5 minutes and kept 

on ice for 5 minutes, 1 µg pCas9, 5 µg donor DNA, 260 µL 50% polyethylene glycol (PEG 

3500 w/v, Sigma-Aldrich), 36 µL 1 M LiAc. Tubes were incubated at 30oC and agitated on a 

tube shaker rotator for 30 minutes, then subjected to a heat shock (42oC for 20 minutes). The 

tubes were centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 2 minutes in an Eppendorf® 5424 centrifuge, the 

supernatant discarded and the pellets resuspended in 1 mL of YPD broth. The tubes were 

incubated at 30oC on a tube shaker rotator for 2 hours. The tubes were centrifuged at 5,000 

rpm for 1 minute, 700 µL of YDP removed and the pellet resuspended in the remaining 

volume and 300 µL was plated on YPD-A supplemented with 200 µg/mL of Geneticin® Life 

Technologies (G418). The plates were incubated at 30oC until isolated colonies were 

observed (2-4 days).  After growth of isolated colonies, they were restreaked twice on YPD to 

lose the pCas9 plasmid.  Loss of the pCas9 plasmid was confirmed by loss of G418 

resistance.  

 The 8 kb donor DNA was generated by PCR using a plasmid template (pX123, gift of 

the Yong-Su Jin lab, University of Illinois – Urbana-Champaign) using the primers 

URA_X123_foward (5’- 

GACTATTTGCAAAGGGAAGGGATGCTAAGGTAGAGGGTGAACGTTACAGAGAGA

TAGGGTTGAGTGTTGT-3’) and URA_X123_reverse (5’ –

CATTTACTTATAATACAGTTTTTTAGTTTTGCTGGCCGCATCTTCTCAAAAGTTAG

CTCACTCATTAGGC-3’). The reaction mixture for one PCR reaction was prepared as 

follows: 13 µL sterile deionized water, 21 µL of 3M Betaine (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 µL DMSO 

(Sigma-Aldrich), 10 µL 5x buffer (HF), 1 µL dNTPs (10 mM each dNTP), 1 µL DNA (1-5 

ng/µL), 2.5 µL of 10 µM primer mixture (forward and reverse), 0.5 µL Phusion Hot Start 

Flex DNA Polymerase® (New England BioLabs). PCR was performed using an Applied 

Biosystems Veriti™ thermal cycler with the following cycling program: initial denaturation at 

98°C for 5 minutes; 35 cycles at 98°C for 30 seconds, 55oC for 30 seconds, 72°C for 4 

minutes; and final extension at 72°C for 10 minutes. The PCR product was purified using the 

DNA Clean &amp;amp; Concentrator™-5 kit (ZymoResearch®).

4.4.7.2 X123 cassette insertion confirmation 

 
Integration of the X123 cassette into the URA3 locus was confirmed by streaking 

strains SA-1, SA-1-X123, 272-1a and 272-1a-X123 on 5-FOA plates (1 g/L of 5-FOA, 5 g/L 

of ammonium sulfate, 20 g/L of glucose, 20 mg/L of uracil, 1.7 g/L of yeast nitrogen base 

without amino acids, Difco BD). While URA3+ strains can metabolize 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-

FOA) into a toxic compound, URA- strains cannot metabolize 5-FOA and will grow 

normally. All of the strains that were co-transformed with the pCas9 plasmid and X123 donor 

DNA were 5-FOAR. 

In addition, correct integration was confirmed by PCR analysis and Sanger 

sequencing.  The gDNA of strains SA-1-X123 and 272-1a-X123 was isolated, and the URA3 

regions surrounding the integration site were amplified using the following primers: 

X123_Up_conf_fw (5’-CCTAGTCCTGTTGCTGCCAA-3’), X123_Up_conf_rev (5‘-

CAGGCTGTTGTTGTCACACG-3’), X123_Dn_conf_fw (5’-

CTTTCCAACAGCCGAAACCG-3’) and X123_Dn_conf_rev (5’-

GTTCCGTTTGACTTGTCGCC-3’).  Purified PCR products were sequenced at Quintara 

Biosciences (Berkeley, CA). 

 
4.4.7.3 Phenotype evaluation in synthetic medium  

 
Strains before (SA-1, 272-1a) and after the X123 cassette insertion (SA-1-X123, 272-

1a-X123) were evaluated in synthetic complete (SC) medium using a 96-well microplate 

growth assay. S288C-X123 and JAY291-X123 (obtained from Yong-Su Jin, UIUC), were 

used as reference strains. Strains were streaked on YPD-A plates and maintained at 30°C for 

48 hours. Three colonies of each strain were grown in 10 mL of YPD broth (30oC, 100 rpm 

shaking, 24 hours). The yeast biomass was washed with 500 µL of sterile deionized water in 

order to remove residual glucose. Strains were evaluated in synthetic complete medium 

without addition of any sugar as carbon source (SC), synthetic complete medium 

supplemented with 4% of dextrose (SCD), synthetic complete medium supplemented with 4% 

of xylose (SCX), YP (1% yeast extract, 1% peptone), YPD (1% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 

4% dextrose) and YPX (1% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 4% xylose). The 96-well microplate 

was set up with 130 µL of medium and 20 µl of fresh cell suspension to have initial OD600nm 

of 0.3 and 150 µL final volume in a final concentration of 1x. The microplate was incubated 

at 30oC with constant agitation (both aerobic, and anaerobic growth experiments were 

performed), OD600nm was measured every 15 minutes using Tecan Sunrise over a 72 hour

period. Anaerobic experiments were set up using an anaerobic chamber (Coy 

Laboratory/Airlock). 

 

4.4.7.4 Phenotype evaluation in YPX fermentation  

 
SA-1-X123 and 272-1a-X123 were also evaluated by batch fermentation in YPX.  The 

strains were streaked on a YPD-A plate and grown at 30°C for 48 hours. Three colonies 

(biological replicates) of each strain were grown in 10 mL of YPD broth at 30oC with 100 

rpm shaking for 24 hours. The yeast biomass was washed with 500 µL of sterile deionized 

water in order to remove residual glucose. Erlenmeyer flasks with 250 mL capacity were used 

for the fermentation studies. Each fermentation (in 50 mL YPX) was inoculated with a fresh 

overnight culture to have an initial OD600nm of 1. The flasks were incubated at 30°C with 100 

rpm shaking for 60 hours. Samples were collected every 12 hours: 100 µL was used to 

measure growth (OD600nm) using a Thermo Scientific Genesys 20 spectrophotometer, and 200 

µL sample was filtered and then stored at -20°C in glass screw-cap vials for xylose and 

ethanol analysis.  

Xylose and ethanol were analyzed using a high pressure liquid chromatography 

(HPLC) method (SLUITER et al., 2012) on a Agilent 1200 HPLC system (Agilent 

Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a refractive index detector (RID). 

Samples were injected onto a 300 mm × 7.8 mm Aminex HPX-87H column (BioRad, 

Richmond, CA, USA) with a guard column of the same material. Elution was performed at 

50°C with 5 mM sulfuric acid at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min.  

 
4.4.8 Quantitative trait loci - QTL 

 
4.4.8.1 Mating type switching  

  
The 272-1a haploid (MAT?), segregate from 272 hybrid, showed greater tolerance for 

M. giganteus hydrolysate compared to reference strains when evaluated in a 96-well 

microplate growth assay. This strain was chosen for X-QTL analysis (EHRENREICH et al., 

2010).  However, the mating type had to be switched to MATa and the HIS3 gene had to be 

deleted (see Section 4.4.8.3) so that a hybrid could be formed by mating to the S288C 

laboratory "magic marker" haploid strain (MAT? can1?::PrSTE2-HIS5 lyp1? his3?::NatMX4 

HO::HphMX4).  



!

!

46!

Escherichia coli (APA 608), which harbors the plasmid that contains a wild type HO 

gene, was used for mating type switching. The stock strain was streaked in Luria-Bertani 

supplemented with carbenicillin plate (LB, BD Bioscience®, 2% agar, 100 µg/mL 

carbenicillin) and maintained at 37oC. After 24 hours a colony was grown for 24 hours in LB 

broth supplemented with 50 µg/mL carbenicillin at 37oC and shaking at 200 rpm. 

Subsequently, 1 mL of the cell suspension was used for plasmid DNA isolation using a 

Qiagen Miniprep Kit®. The pHS2 plasmid was transformed into yeast using a LiAc (see 

Section 4.4.7).  The transformation mixture was prepared in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf® tube and 

contained the following ingredients:  260 µL 50% PEG (3500 w/v, Sigma-Aldrich), 10 µL 

ssDNA (preheated at 100°C for 5 minutes and kept on ice for 5 minutes), 36 µL 1M LiAc, 6 

µL gDNA pHS2 plasmid (1 µg DNA), 48 µL sterile deionized water and 90 µL of 272-1a 

competent cells.  The tubes were incubated at 30°C for 30 minutes on a tube shaker rotator, 

then 9% of DMSO was added, and then the tubes subjected to a heat shock (42oC for 20 

minutes). The cells were pelleted at 5,000 rpm for 2 minutes in an Eppendorf® 5424 

centrifuge and the supernatant discarded. Cells were resuspended in 1 mL of YPD and 

incubated at 30°C on a tube shaker rotator for 2 hours. Before plating, the cells were 

concentrated by centrifugation (5,000 rpm for 1 minute) and 700 µL of the supernatant was 

discarded. The pellet was resuspended in the remaining 300 µL and spread on YPD plates 

supplemented with 200 µg/mL hygromycin (HYG). After growth of isolated colonies at 

30°C, 12 colonies were restreaked on YPD and incubated at 30°C for 48 hours.  These 

colonies were restreaked a second time on YPD and loss of the pHS2 plasmid was confirmed 

by testing for loss of HYGR. Colonies that did not grow in the presence of hygromycin were 

recovered from the YPD plate and then frozen at -80oC in YPD supplemented with 15% (v/v) 

glycerol. These colonies are likely diploid after mating type switching; therefore, they were 

sporulated and five tetrads dissected in order to obtain twenty haploids.  The mating type of 

each haploid was determined by mating type specific PCR (see Section 4.4.5 for details). 

 
4.4.8.2 Confirmation of hydrolysate tolerance phenotype after mating type switching  

  
Twenty haploids of both mating types (MATa and MAT?) were evaluated in SC-80 

medium supplemented with 40% of M. giganteus hydrolyzate in a 96-well microplate growth 

assay (30oC, anaerobic, for 72 hours, initial OD600nm = 0.3, biological triplicates). Three 

haploids MATa (272-1c, 272-4a and 272-5d) showed good hydrolysate tolerance (greater

growth than the parental strain 272 hybrid) in the presence of 40% (v/v) of M. giganteus 

hydrolysate and were selected for the next step.  

 
4.4.8.3 HIS3 gene deletion and verification 

 
In order to facilitate the process of transformation, three MATa haploids (272-1c, 272-

4a and 272-5d) derived from 272-1a MAT? after mating type switching, were saved as frozen 

competent cells as described above. Escherichia coli (strain APA 544), which contains the 

plasmid pAG36 was used as a PCR template to amplify the NatMX4 cassette. The NatMX4 

cassette confers resistance to nourseothricin (Nat) and was used for making the HIS3 deletion. 

A single colony from the -80oC E. coli stock was isolated on a LB agar plate supplemented 

with carbenicillin (100 µg/mL), and then grown in 10 mL of LB broth supplemented with 

carbenicillin (50 µg/mL), and plasmid DNA isolated as described earlier. Each PCR reaction 

contained: 170 ng of plasmid DNA (1 µL), 21 µL 3M betaine, 1 µL DMSO, 10 µL 5x buffer 

(HF), 1 µL dNTPs (10 mM mix of each dNTP), 2.5 µL of 10 µM primer mixture (forward 

and reverse primers), 0.5 µL Phusion Hot Start Flex DNA Polymerase® (New England 

BioLabs), 13 µL sterile deionized water. The NatMX4 cassette was amplified using 100nt 

primers with 20nt homology to the drug cassette and 80bp flanking homology that matched 

the HIS3 gene. Five PCR reactions (50 µL each) were prepared in order to generate enough 

DNA for transformation. PCR was performed using an Applied Biosystems thermocycler 

Veriti™ using the following cycling program: initial denaturation at 98oC for 5 minutes; 35 

cycles at 98oC for 30 seconds, 60oC for 30 seconds, 72°C for 3 minutes; and final extension at 

72°C for 10 minutes. The PCR product size was confirmed using an E-gel 1.2% agarose with 

ethidium bromide (Invitrogen, Life). The PCR reactions were treated with 5 µL DpnI (New 

England BioLabs) at 37oC for 60 minutes, and then heat-inactivated at 80oC for 20 minutes in 

an Applied Biosystems Veriti™ thermocycler. The five reactions were then combined and 

purified using a DNA Clean &amp;amp; Concentrator kit (ZymoResearch®). 

Using a LiAc protocol (see above) 50-70 ng of purified PCR product was transformed 

into 272-1c, 272-4a and 272-5d competent cells. After a four-hour recovery at 30oC, the 

transformation mixture was plated on YPD-A supplemented with 100 µg/mL of 

nourseothricin. The plates were incubated at 30oC until growth of isolates colonies was 

observed (2-4 days), and then restreaked for single colonies on a second YPD-NAT plate. 

The HIS3 deletion strains were confirmed using both PCR analysis and phenotypic 

analysis. Genomic DNA from NATR colonies was isolated using the YeaStar® 



!

48!

ZymoResearch kit as previously described. Each PCR reaction contained: 100 ng gDNA (1 

µL), 21 µL 3M betaine, 1 µL DMSO, 10 µL 5x buffer (HF), 1 µL dNTPs (10 mM mix of 

each dNTP), 2.5 µL of 10µM primer mixture (forward and reverse primers), 0.5 µL Phusion 

Hot Start Flex DNA Polymerase® (New England BioLabs) and 9 µL sterile deionized water. 

Two sets of primers were used to confirm the HIS3 deletion: i) KanB (5'-

CTGCAGCGAGGAGCCGTAAT-3’) and his3_fw (5'-

GACAGAGCAGAAAGCCCTAGTAAAG-3’), and ii) his3_fw (5'-

GACAGAGCAGAAAGCCCTAGTAAAG-3’) and his3_rev (5'-

AATGATGCATTACCTTGTCATCTTC-3’). The reaction was performed using an Applied 

Biosystems thermocycler Veriti™, using the following program: initial denaturation at 98oC 

for 5 minutes; 35 cycles at 98oC for 30 seconds, 60oC for 30 seconds, 72°C for 3 minutes; and 

final extension at 72°C for 10 minutes. PCR products were analyzed using an E-gel 1.2% 

agarose with ethidium bromide staining (Invitrogen, Life).  

HIS3 gene deletion was also confirmed by histidine auxothophy analysis, using the 

following media: SC with all amino acids added (20 g/L of glucose, 2 g/L of dropout mix 

minus histidine without YNB, 2 g/L of histidine, 6.7 g/L of yeast nitrogen base without amino 

acids, 219.5 g/L of MES buffer at pH 5.5 adjusted with 3 M NaOH) and SC-HIS medium 

(with all amino acids added, except for histidine). Strains with a confirmed HIS3::NatMX4 

deletion were only able to grow on SC media when supplemented with histidine. 

 
4.4.8.4 Hydrolysate tolerance phenotype confirmation after HIS3 deletion  

 
After deletion and confirmation of the HIS3::NatMX4 strains, the hydrolysate 

tolerance phenotypes of the three strains (1c, 4a and 5d - MATa his3?::NatRMX4) were 

evaluated in SC-80 medium supplemented with 40% of M. giganteus hydrolysate at 30oC, 

using anaerobic growth conditions in a 96-well microplate format. Each strain was tested in 

biological triplicates. The OD600nm was measured every 15 minutes for 72 hours (initial 

OD600nm = 0.3). The haploid strains before HIS3 gene deletion, and JAY291 were used as 

positive controls to confirm that HIS3 deletion had no negative effect on hydrolysate 

tolerance. Strain 4a (APA 2877) retained the full tolerance phenotype and was used for the X-

QTL study.

4.4.8.5 Pre-QTL: evaluation of the parental strain phenotypes in a DASGIP® bioreactor  

 
The parents of the X-QTL selection experiment (272-4a MATa his3?::NatMX4 and 

S288C “magic marker” strain) were evaluated in an anaerobic bioreactor to confirm their 

tolerance phenotypes. Strain 272-4a (APA 2877) should be able to grow in the presence of 

30% (v/v) hydrolysate whereas the laboratory strain S288C “magic marker” (MM) cannot. 

Four sterile DASGIP® vessels, 1L capacity, were set up with 200 mL of SC-80 with or 

without 30% (v/v) of M. giganteus hydrolysate. The dissolved oxygen (DO) probe 

(Hamilton/VISIFERM DO 225) was calibrated to maintain an anaerobic condition; the 

temperature probe was calibrated to keep the temperature at 30oC, the pH probe (Mettler 

Toledo/405-DPAS-SC-K8S/225) and base addition pump (containing 4N KOH) were 

calibrated to maintain the pH at 5.5. Media was aseptically added to the vessels and 

maintained at 30oC for 24 hours prior to inoculating the cells in order to detect contamination. 

If the media remained clear (i.e. no contamination) then the vessels were inoculated. 

Parental strains (272-4a MATa his3?::NatMX4 and S288C MM MAT?) were 

streaked on YPD-A and maintained at 30°C for 48 hours. A colony was inoculated in 12 mL 

of SC-80 and grown overnight on a shaking platform at 30°C. The cell suspension was then 

diluted to OD600nm 0.25 in 200 mL of fresh SC-80 and grown overnight at 30°C on a shaking 

platform (250 rpm).  The cell culture was harvested and inoculated into DASGIP® vessels 

(containing media) to an initial OD600nm of 0.2 and grown at 30oC for 72 hours. In addition, 

0.005% of Antifoam 204 (Sigma-Aldrich) was added at the beginning of fermentation. 

Growth was monitored and recorded using an optical density probe (Fogale Nanotech OD 

Sensor/DN12-220-5). 

 
4.4.8.6 Hybrid between S288C MM MAT? and 4a MATa his3?::NatRMX4   

 
After evaluation of 272-4a MATa his3?::NatMX4 in SC-80 supplemented with 

hydrolysate and to confirm its tolerance phenotypes, it was then crossed with the laboratory 

strain S288C magic marker (MAT? can1?::PSTE2-HIS5 lyp1? his3?::NatMX4 

HO::HphMX4) (S288C MM). The stock cultures were streaked on YPD-A plate and 

maintained at 30oC. After 48 hours, a colony from each strain was mixed on YPD-A plate and 

incubated at 30oC. After 4 hours, a portion of the cells was spread on a YPD-A plate, and five 

zygotes were picked using a tetrad dissection microscope (MSM S400, Singer Instruments). 

The YPD-A plate was then maintained at 30oC for 72 hours. Only three of the five zygotes

grew. The ploidy (2n) was confirmed by mating type PCR as described earlier. The hybrids 

were stored in YPD containing 15% (v/v) of glycerol at -80oC. 

 
4.4.8.7 Hydrolysate tolerance evaluation of hybrids strains derived from 272-4a and 

S288C MM  

 
After it was confirmed that the three hybrids were diploid, they were evaluated in SC-

80 media supplemented with either, 0%, 30% or 45% (v/v) of M. giganteus hydrolysate, in a 

96-well microplate growth assay as described above (Section 4.4.3). The parental strains 

S288C MM (APA 5030) and 272-4a MATa his3?::NatMX4 (APA 2877) were used as 

controls. Two out of the three hybrids evaluated showed the highest tolerance. Hybrid #2 

(APA 2880) was chosen for subsequent X-QTL mapping.  

 
4.4.8.8 Obtaining a large F1 pool of MATa segregants for X-QTL analysis  

 
The stock culture of APA 2880, previously stored at -80oC in 15% (v/v) of glycerol, 

was streaked on YPD-A and grown at 30oC for 48 hours. A single colony was inoculated into 

a 250 mL erlenmeyer flask containing 100 mL of YPD broth and grown overnight (30oC, 100 

rpm shaking). The overnight culture was diluted to an initial OD600nm of 0.225 in 1 L of fresh 

YPD in a sterile flask (3 L capacity), and incubated at 30oC with 220 rpm shaking until 

OD600nm = 0.6 (around 3 hours). The yeast biomass was collected by centrifugation at room 

temperature (6,000 rpm, 10 minutes) in a Beckman Coulter Avanti J-26 XP JLA-8100 rotor. 

Cells were washed twice with sterile deionized water (500 mL and then 250 mL). Cells were 

then resuspended in 1 L of potassium acetate 1% and incubated at room temperature for 10 

days in a 3 L flask.  

After sporulation, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 rpm at room 

temperature for 10 minutes in a Beckman JA-10 rotor and then transferred to 50 mL conical 

tubes. They were then pellet and concentrated by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm and at room 

temperature for 10 minutes in an Eppendorf® 5810R centrifuge. Cells were treated with 

zymolyase enzyme (see Section 4.4.4.1). Cells were then spread on 10 plates containing 

magic marker media (6,7 g/L yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 20 g/L glucose, 2 g/L 

drop out mix synthetic minus histidine, minus lysine, minus arginine, 20 g/L agar, 50 µg/mL 

canavinine, 50 µg/mL thialysine) and incubated at 30oC for 48 hours. Magic marker media is 

used to select for MATa haploid segregants. Approximately 4x1010 segregants were isolated.

The haploid segregant pool was then scraped from the agar surface and resuspend in 20 mL of 

YPD supplemented with 15% (v/v) of glycerol and stored at -80oC.   

 
4.4.8.9 F1 pool selection in a DASGIP® bioreactor 

 
The F1 pool was selected in SC-80 medium supplemented with 0, 15 or 30% (v/v) of 

M. giganteus hydrolysate in turbiostat mode 15 days using a DASGIP® bioreactor system. 

Media was prepared and filter sterilized, 0.005% Antifoam 204 (Sigma-Aldrich) was added 

and the media, stored in 20 L Nalgene® carboys, was kept on ice for the duration of the 

experiment.  

The injector pump (feeder) and the ejector pump (waste) were calibrated to keep the 

vessel volume constant at 200 mL of medium. The temperature probe was calibrated to keep 

the temperature at 30oC. The DO probe was calibrated to maintain an anaerobic condition. 

Also the pH probe (Mettler Toledo/405-DPAS-SC-K8S/225) and injector pump (containing 4 

N KOH) were calibrated to maintain the pH at 5.5. The vessels were autoclaved at 121oC for 

30 minutes. After cooling, 200 mL of medium were added and maintained at 30oC for 24 

hours in order to detect contamination. If the media remained clear (i.e. no contamination) 

then the vessels were inoculated.  

The frozen haploid pool (OD600nm = 298) was recovered from -80oC storage by 

growing for ~5.5 hours in 800 mL of SC-80 (initial OD600nm = 0.25) at 30oC with 250 rpm 

shaking. This culture provided enough biomass to start three experiments). After 5.5 hours the 

OD600nm value reached 0.414. Three bottles containing 173 mL of cell suspension were 

centrifuged in a Beckman Coulter Avanti J-26 XP JA-10 rotor at 6,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 

room temperature. The supernatant was discarded and the cell pellet resuspended in 20 mL of 

the appropriate medium (SC-80 supplemented with either 0%, 15% or 30% (v/v) of 

hydrolysate). A syringe was used to add 15 mL of inoculum into each bioreactor vessel to 

start the fermentation with OD600nm = 0.25. Samples were collected at 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 

60, 80, and 100 generations (or population doublings). For each time point, 2 mL of the 

sample was purged from the collection line, and 10 mL of culture was collected. The first 

sample was collected at time point zero (T0 = 1st generation), the second sample was 

collected at generation 5, after 1L of fresh medium had been added to the bioreactor vessel 

(T1 = 5 generations). The amount of media added to each vessel was monitored and 

additional samples were collected every 5, 10 or 20 generations as Table 2.

Once the samples were collected in a falcon tube with 15 mL capacity, they were kept 

on ice and processed. The samples were first centrifuged at 4oC in an Eppendorf® 5810R 

centrifuge at 4,000 rpm for 8 minutes and the supernatant was stored at -80oC in a new 15 mL 

falcon tube (for subsequent analysis of ethanol and glucose). The yeast was resuspended in 1 

mL of sterile deionized water and transferred into 2 mL conical bottom cryogenic vials with 

screw caps, centrifuged at maximum speed (21,000 rpm) for 1 minute at room temperature in 

an Eppendorf® 5424 centrifuge. The supernatant was discarded and the biomass stored at -

80oC for subsequent genomic DNA isolation.  

 
4.4.8.10 Yeast Genomic DNA isolation 

 
 The yeast genomic DNA isolation protocol was adapted from Hoffman &amp;amp; Winston 

(1987). The yeast biomass stored at -80oC was first thawed, and then briefly mixed by 

vortexing. The pellet was resuspend in 200 µL TSENT buffer (2% Triton X-100, 1% sodium 

dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1 mM EDTA pH 8, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8) and 200 

µL Phenol/Chloroform/Isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). After addition of 0.3 g acid washed glass 

beads (Sigma-Aldrich), the cells were lysed by vortexing for 15 minutes at 4oC and placed 

then on ice. TE buffer (200 µL, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 1 mM EDTA pH 8) was added to 

each sample and then centrifuged for 18 minutes at 4oC in an Eppendorf® 5424 centrifuge. 

The upper aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube containing 1 mL of absolute ethanol. 

The tubes were gently mixed by inversion and placed at -80oC for 30 minutes. The tubes were 

centrifuged at maximum speed (21,000 rpm) for 5 minutes at 4oC in an Eppendorf® 5424

centrifuge. The supernatant was aspirated, and the pellet briefly dried and resuspended in 400 

µL of TE. Tubes were incubated for 5 minutes at 37oC with 30 µg RNase. DNA was 

precipitated by the addition of 5.3 µL of 7.5 M ammonium acetate (NH4Ac) and 1 mL of 

absolute ethanol, and then mixed by inversion. The DNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 

maximum speed (21,000 rpm) for 3 minutes and the supernatant was aspirated. After air 

drying, the DNA pellet was resuspended in 25 µL of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8. 

 
4.4.8.11 Illumina sequencing and QTL data analysis 

 
 Purified genomic DNA from the parental (272-1a MAT? and S288C MM) and the 

hydrolysate selection time points was submitted to the University of California Davis 

Genome Center (http://dnatech.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/) for Illumina library preparations 

and HiSeq 2500 sequencing. X-QTL data analysis was performed using custom scripts 

provided by Dr. Matthew Maurer (University of California Berkeley, Energy Biosciences 

Institute) based on the GATK variants analysis pipeline (EHRENREICH et al., 2010), i-QTL 

(PARTS et al., 2011), and MULTIPOOL (EDWARDS; GIFFORD, 2012) algorithms. QTL 

peaks were detected using i-QTL and confidence intervals calculated using MULTIPOOL. 

QTL plots were generated using custom R scripts (Dr. Matthew Maurer).

5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

 

5.1 Direct mating of haploids from the same tetrad and pre-screening of resulting 

strains 

 

Tetrad dissection of a heterozygous and heterothallic diploid results in four individual 

haploids with different genotypes and different phenotypes. The relative growth of each 

haploid can be assessed by colony size on a YPD agar (YPD-A) plate.  The goal of this 

experiment was to identify desirable growth phenotypes using two different molasses 

selective media (molasses-selective medium and molasses-hydrolysate medium I) of strains 

derived from crossing large, small, or a combination of large and small colony size haploids 

(LxS). The growth was evaluated for 24 hours, by measuring the optical density at 570 nm 

(OD570nm) in a 96-well microplate reader and maximum specific growth rate (?max) was 

calculated. 

Four perfect tetrads containing (four) haploids with different sizes for their colonies 

were chosen and their haploids mated to each other. Thirty strains were obtained from large 

colony crossings (LxL), 23 strains from large and small colony crossings (LxS), and 20 

strains from small colony crossings (SxS).  

The results showed that 47%, 40% and 65% of large colony strains came from LxL, 

LxS, and SxS crossings, respectively. The strain colony size is not determined solely by the 

haploid colony size used in breeding, at least on a YPD-A plate. Crossing small colony 

haploids can produce large colony strains, and crossing two large colony haploids can 

produce a small colony strain. Only a subset of all the strains had improved growth relative to 

the reference strains – PE-2, CAT-1 and SA-1: 47%, 43% and 35% of strains coming from 

LxL, LxS and SxS crossings, respectively, presented higher growth in molasses-selective 

medium (greater than 0.5 OD570nm after 24 hours) (Figure 7).  

Rough colonies were the products of some crossings (Figure 7). These colonies 

showed low final OD570nm after 24 hours, as a result of flocculation. This characteristic is 

undesirable for the fermentation process with cell recycling. These strains were discarded at 

this stage of selection.

Figure 7 - Anaerobic growth evaluation (OD570nm and µmax) for 73 strains derived from direct mating of 

haploids from the same tetrad that had different sized colonies (small x small, small x large, large x 
large) after 24 hours in molasses-selective medium (pH 4) at 30oC using a 96-well microplate reader.  
The reference strains are PE-2, CAT-1 and SA-1. The graphs show an average and standard deviation 
of three technical replicates for the final OD570nm (light green bars and light gray bars), and the 
average for µmax (green bars and gray bars). The strains are identified as (S) small colony, (L) large 
colony and (R) rough colony. Dark green bars show strains that were selected for second-round of 
screening in molasses-hydrolysate medium II (pH 5) 

 

The growth difference between small colony haploids and large colony haploids 

matings are more evident in molasses-hydrolysate medium I. Strains coming from SxS 

matings (31-33, 45-48, 81-90) had poor growth in this medium (Figure 8a, Figure 8c). On the 

other hand, strains coming from LxL matings (24-30, 37-44, 50-71) showed somewhat 

greater growth compared to the references PE-2, CAT-1 and SA-1 (Figure 8a, Figure 8b). 

These results suggest that crossings involving large colony haploids can generate strains more 

tolerant to molasses-selective medium and molasses-hydrolysate medium I compared to small 

colony matings. 

Eleven out of 73 strains were selected for their improved growth in molasses-selective 

medium (Figure 7) and 19 hybrids were selected for their improved growth in molasses-

hydrolysate medium I (Figure 8a, Figure 8b, Figure 8c). Strains 24, 26, 28 and 34 were 

selected based on improved growth in both media.  A total of 26 strains were selected for

5.2.2 Pre-screening of hybrids from direct mating of irradiated haploids  

 

Twenty-one irradiated haploids that were selected for improved growth (OD570nm and 

improvwere then crossed according to their mating type and 234 new hybrids (UV-hybrids) 

were obtained and evaluated in molasses-selective medium (Figure 10) and molasses-

hydrolysate medium I (Figure 11). Based on growth (OD570nm), 73 UV-hybrids were selected 

in molasses-selective medium (Figure 10) and 85 UV-hybrids were selected in molasses-

hydrolysate medium I (Figure 11).  Thirty-three UV-hybrids were selected based on improved 

growth in both media types.

Figure 10 - Anaerobic growth evaluation (OD570nm and µmax) for 234 UV-hybrids compared to the reference 

strains: PE-2, CAT-1 and SA-1, in molasses-selective medium (pH 4) at 30oC for 24 hours using a 
96-well microplate reader. The graphs show the average and standard deviation of three technical 
replicates for OD570nm (light red bars and light gray bars) and the average for µmax (red bars and gray 
bars). Dark red bars show selected UV-hybrids for the second-round of screening in molasses-
hydrolysate medium II (pH 5)

pH 4.7 (e to j) pH 4.8 at 30oC for 24 hours using a 96-well microplate reader. The graphs show the 
average and standard deviation of three technical replicates for OD570nm (light red bars and light gray 
bars) and the average for µmax (red bars and gray bars). Dark red bars show selected UV-hybrids 
for the second-round of screening in molasses-hydrolysate medium II (pH 5). Green bars show 
hybrids derived from direct mating of haploids from the same tetrad that had different sized

5.3 Evaluation of reference strains and pre-screening of strains from mass mating 

followed by adaptive evolution 

 

The reference strains PE-2, CAT-1 and SA-1, were plated on YPD-A and kept at 30oC 

for 48 hours. Fifteen colonies from each strain were isolated and karyotyped by pulsed field 

gel electrophoresis (PFGE).  These 45 colonies and also 120 colonies isolated from mass 

mating and adaptive evolution were screened for growth in molasses-selective medium.  

Most of the PE-2 derived colonies had the same PFGE profile (except PE-2-C13 and 

PE-2-C14 (Figure 14a). However, significant differences in growth were observed among the 

15 isolated colonies, even though they had the same karyotype (Figure 13a, Figure 14a), 

suggesting that they exhibit genetic differences that cannot be detected by PFGE. In contrast, 

PE-2-C13 and PE-2-C14 showed a distinct karyotype and are likely a different chromosomal 

rearrangement (CR), which represents a subpopulation of the original PE-2 sample (Figure 

13a, Figure 14a).  

 The P evolved population (mass mating of a mixture of 91 haploids from PE-2 

followed by adaptive evolution) showed new different CRs: the prevalent electrophoretic 

karyotype of the original PE-2 culture disappeared and two prevalent karyotypes arose: CR1 

(profiles 1, 3, 4, 7, 8 and 9) and CR2 (profiles 2, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15) (Figure 14b). 

Nevertheless a sub-dominant chromosomal rearrangement found in the original PE-2 

population (PE-2-C13 and PE-2-C14) (Figure 14a) could still be detected in the evolved 

population, but again without prevalence (colonies P-C5 and P-C10) (Figure 14b). The 

greater differences between karyotyping profiles were noticed in the region of smaller 

chromosomes (lower region of the gel), while the region of medium and large chromosomes 

were most conserved, allowing in most of the cases to infer the original strain (i.e. PE-2).  

These observations suggest that although chromosomal rearrangements are quite 

common in PE-2 and the evolved strains, they do not have a significant impact on the growth 

phenotype in molasses selective medium.  A more detailed genomic and phenotypic analysis 

would be necessary to understand the effects of these chromosomal rearrangements.

Figure 13 - Anaerobic growth evaluation (OD570nm and µmax) for single colonies isolated from either (a) PE-2, 

CAT-1 or (b) CAT-1, SA-1 original cultures, compared to the reference original parental strains 
(PE-2, CAT-1, SA-1) and baker's yeast (MAURI) in molasses-selective medium at 30oC for 24 
hours in a 96-well microplate. The graphs show the average and standard deviation of three 
technical replicates for OD570nm (light blue bars and light gray bars) and µmax (blue bars and gray 
bars) 

 

The CAT-1 derived population presented more phenotypic (i.e. growth) variability 

than the PE-2 population although it had less variability in its PFGE (i.e. genotypic) profile 

(Figure 13a, Figure 13b, Figure 14c). The predominant profile of the CAT-1 population 

(CAT-1-C1 to CAT-1-C8, CAT-1-C11, CAT-1-C13 and CAT-1-C15) was lost after evolution 

(C population). However, the subdominant PFGE profile (CAT-1-C9, CAT-1-C10, CAT-1-

C12 and CAT-1-C14) persisted in C evolved population (Figure 14c, Figure 14d). Strains 

derived from the C evolved pool (adaptive evolution of mass mating of 89 haploids derived 

from CAT-1) showed the most phenotypic variation based on growth and also significant 

variation in their PFGE profiles (Figure 14d, Figure 15a, Figure 15b). These results suggest 

that the evolved C population was a mixture of strains and further selection might select for a 

single genotype.  At least seven different chromosomal rearrangements were encountered in 

the evolved C population, including the subdominant profile from the original population (C-

C4, C-C5 and C-C6), but again without prevalent strains.

Figure 14 - Electrophoretic karyotypes of populations derived from (a) PE-2, (b) P evolved pool (haploids from 

PE-2), (c) CAT-1, (d) C evolved pool (haploids from CAT-1), (e) SA-1 and (f) S evolved pool 
(haploids from SA-1) 

 

Single colonies isolated from the SA-1 population also showed some growth variance, 

but all the karyotyped colonies exhibited only one profile (Figure 13b, Figure 14e). After 

evolution a new CR appeared in the S population (S-C3, S-C7, S-C8 and S-C12 from Figure 

14f), suggesting higher genetic variability in evolved populations compared to the parent 

strain (Figure 14e, Figure 14f). Strains derived from the S pool grew better than the parental 

strain SA-1 (Figure 15b). The two strains (S-C7 and S-C8) with the slowest growth rate also 

shared the same karyotype profile (Figure 14f, Figure 15b).

In sum, it was found that strains in the original population of PE-2, CAT-1 and SA-1 

strains showed different growth patterns even though they had indistinguishable PFGE 

profiles (Figure 13, Figure 14, Figure 15). It is likely that these strains did in fact have genetic 

differences, but they could not be detected at the resolution of a karyotype profile.  In 

contrast, strains derived from mass mating and adaptive evolution, showed a greater diversity 

in both phenotype (i.e. growth) and genotype (i.e. CRs), which suggests that a number of 

possible genotypes are adaptive for growth in molasses-selective medium. 

Our results showed that among the original cultures (CAT-1, PE-2 and SA-1) 

individuals with different electrophoretic karyotype are detected and also showing different 

growth patterns, although all of such strains were originally isolated from a single colony, 

suggesting the appearance of variants during laboratory replication and maintenance. 

Due to the great genome plasticity of these indigenous strains (ARGUESO et al., 

2009), variants could be generated over many years of laboratory replication of the culture. 

This was observed regarding CRs of a wine diploid strain in laboratory condition:  after 55 

generations of mitotic growth in YPD medium, a CR could be detect, but after 275 

generations about half of the population was represented by 11 different CRs (LONGO; 

VÉZINHET, 1993).

Figure 15 - Anaerobic growth evaluation of (OD570nm and µmax) for 120 strains from mass mating followed by 

adaptive evolution compared to Mauri, PE-2, CAT-1 and SA-1 in molasses-selective medium (pH 
4) at 30oC for 24 hours, in a 96-well microplate reader.  The graphs show the average and standard 
deviation of three technical replicates for OD570nm (light purple bars and light gray bars) and the 
average for µmax (purple bars and gray bars). Dark purple bars show strains that were selected for a 
second-round of screening in molasses-hydrolysate medium II (pH 5) 

 

Strains derived from the PC evolved population (derived by mass mating of 91 PE-2 

haploids with 89 CAT-1 haploids, followed by adaptive evolution) showed mostly superior 

growth to the parental strains PE-2 and CAT-1. This result suggests breeding between 

different strains could generate individuals with superior traits compared to their parents. 

These strains also showed higher karyotype profile variability. This variability was also 

noticed for strains derived from the PS evolved population (mass mating of 91 PE-2 haploids

with 50 SA-1 haploids, followed by adaptive evolution), the CS evolved population (mass 

mating of 89 CAT-1 haploids with 50 SA-1 haploids, followed by adaptive evolution) and the 

PCS evolved population (mass mating of all haploids from PE-2, CAT-1 and SA-1, followed 

by adaptive evolution) (Figure 15, Figure 16). 

During the recycling process in Brazilian distilleries, it is possible that a selected 

starter strain could growth for about 70 generations during a 250 days ethanol production 

season (considering two fermentation cycles per day with a 10% of biomass gain for each 

fermentation cycle). Additionally there are likely many occasions for yeast sporulation in the 

Brazilian distilleries, similar to that proposed by Sipiczki (2011) for the wine making, which 

could lead to a well-adapted strain. In fact, several PE-2 variants showing CRs were isolated 

from distilleries that had improved properties. When reintroduced into the same ethanol plant 

these PE-2 variants were able to outcompete the original strain, suggesting that adaptive 

evolution had occurred during the industrial fermentation process. One of these strains 

presented a remarkable acid tolerance that could have been selected for during the recycling 

process, which involves a much severe treatment with sulfuric acid (AMORIM, 2011). 

In this study, industrial strains (CAT-1, PE-2 and SA-1) were used for increasing the 

phenotypic diversity by means of sporulation, mating and adaptive evolution in stress 

conditions (ethanol and acetic acid), and the results showed that crossings between different 

strains increased variability drastically, in relation to not only CRs but also with respect to 

growth parameters.

Mass mating and adaptive evolution produced 120 strains.  All 120 isolates were first 

evaluated in molasses-selective medium and then in molasses-hydrolysate medium I (Figure

Figure 17 - Anaerobic growth evaluation (OD570nm and µmax) for 120 isolates from mass mating followed by 

adaptive evolution compared to reference strains: PE-2, CAT-1, SA-1 and Mauri, in molasses-
hydrolysate medium I at 30oC for 24 hours using a 96-well microplate. The graphs show the 
average and standard deviation of three technical replicates for OD570nm (light purple bars and light 
gray bars) and the average for µmax (purple bars and gray bars). Dark purple bars show strains that 
were selected for second-round of screening in molasses-hydrolysate medium II (pH 5). Red bars 
correspond to UV-hybrids previously described (Section 5.2) 

 

Seventy out of 120 strains were selected based on growth (OD570nm) by both media 

(molasses-selective medium and molasses-hydrolysate medium I) for a second-round of 

screening in molasses-hydrolysate medium II (pH 5). Fourteen out of 70 isolates were 

selected based on growth (OD570nm) for an additional round of screening by batch 

fermentation with cell recycling (Figure 18).

Figure 18 - Anaerobic growth evaluation (OD570nm and µmax) for 70 isolates derived from mass mating followed 

by adaptive evolution (purple bars) compared to four reference strains: PE-2, CAT-1, SA-1 or Mauri, 
in molasses-hydrolysate medium II (pH 5) at 30oC after 24 hours using a 96-well microplate. Dark 
purple bars (14 strains) represent isolates that were selected for an additional round of screening by 
batch fermentation with recycling. Graphs show the average and standard deviation of three technical 
replicates for OD570nm (light purple bars and light gray bars) and the average for µmax (purple bars 
and gray bars). Red bars correspond to UV-hybrids previously described (Section 5.2) 

 

5.4 Screening fermentation  

  

From 221 isolates (26 strains derive from direct mating of haploids from the same 

tetrad, 125 UV-hybrids, and 70 isolates from mass mating followed by adaptive evolution 

previously evaluated in molasses-hydrolysate medium II), a total of 24 strains (4 were strains 

derived from haploids from the same tetrad, 6 from irradiated haploids and 14 from mass 

mating followed by adaptive evolution) were selected based on growth (OD570nm) for further 

screening by fermentation with cell recycling. Fermentations started with about 8% (w/v) wet 

weight biomass using molasses-hydrolysate fermentantion medium. The whole yeast biomass 

was recycled and used for five rounds of batch fermentations.  CAT-1, PE-2, SA-1 and Mauri 

(baker’s yeast) were used as references. 

The major challenge in whole cell recycling fermentation is the maintenance of high 

viability, and at least 7 isolates (73, 132, 133, 178, 188, 272 and 409) presented equal or 

higher viabilities when compared with the reference SA-1 (Figure 19). Baker’s yeast had the

viability reduced to 50% at the end of cycle five, demonstrating the low tolerance of this 

strain to the used substrate.  The ability to survive the acid wash and cell recycling is an 

important industrial trait (BASSO et al., 2008), and varied widely among the strains that were 

tested.  Three isolates presented final cell viability even lower than baker’s yeast, for 

example.  Although the fermentation studies were performed without any replicates (due to 

resource constraints) they were used to select the final strains for detailed genomics studies.  

 

 
Figure 19 - Cell viability (%) of 24 selected strains compared to the reference strains PE-2, CAT-1, SA-1 and 

Mauri (baker’s yeast) for cycles two, three, four, and five 
 

In addition, biomass gain during recycling is a desirable trait, and Figure 20 shows 

that at least 16 isolates presented equal or higher biomass compared with PE-2 reference. All 

of the isolates with high viability were included in this high biomass cluster, except isolate 

132.

 Ethanol production did not show much variability among the strains. Only three 

isolates (261, 369 and 382) had poor ethanol production compared to other strains (Figure 

21). These three strains also presented lower biomass gain (Figure 20), reduced cell viability

poor ethanol production.

The best performing strains, based on cell viability, also produced less glycerol in 

cycle five when compared with the reference strains (Figure 23). Glycerol formation is 

connected to yeast growth (NORDSTROM, 1968) and various stress conditions (BASSO et 

al., 2011). Up to 5% of the input carbon can be diverted from ethanol to glycerol, which 

results in lower ethanol productivity at the industrial scale (ALVES, 1994). A possible reason 

for the lower glycerol formation for strains with high cell viability and high biomass gain, 

could be a higher tolerance towards the inhibitors present in the substrate used. Consequently, 

low glycerol formation makes the ethanol fermentation process more efficient.

 Small amounts of xylitol were also detected showing the variable capability of the 

isolates to transport and present partially metabolized xylose in the substrate (Figure 24), 

although most of this sugar remains after fermentation (data not shown).

 It is well known that yeast reserve carbohydrates (trehalose and glycogen) are able to 

protect the cell against several stressing conditions (WALKER, 1998) and high levels of these 

sugars are desirable in industrial strains. Both carbohydrates were found in variable 

proportions among the isolates at the end of cycle five (Figure 25). In a general fashion, 

isolates with higher levels of trehalose and glycogen also presented higher cell viabilities.

(trahalose+glycogen) of 24 selected strains compared to the reference strains PE-2, CAT-1, SA-1 
and Mauri (baker’s yeast) at the end of cycle five 

  

 Although this experiment was not conducted with replicates (the laboratory structure 

did not allow the number of analysis required) it was used to select good candidates for 

further studies.  Based on final viability, biomass gain and reserve carbohydrates content, 

seven strains were selected for detailed genomic studies (isolates 73, 81, 133, 178, 188, 272 

and 409). Strains 73 and 81 originated by breeding between haploids from the same tetrad and 

strains 133, 178, 188 and 272 are hybrids from UV irradiated haploids. Isolate 409 was the 

only strain selected from mass mating. These 24 strains previously selected from a total of 

427 isolates that were created and screened (Sections 5.1 to 5.4) all show promising growth 

properties in molasses-hydrolysate fermentantion medium and during batch fermentation with 

cell recycling.  With further development, some of these strains might be used for second-

generation ethanol production from lignocellulosic substrates. 

 

5.5 Segregants from selected hybrids  

 

Three hybrids selected in this study (133 and 272 were derived from mating irradiated 

haploids, and 409 was derived from mass mating and adaptive evolution) and SA-1 were 

sporulated and the mating type of the spores from each tetrad identified by PCR. All four 

hybrids produced stable haploid spores indicating that these strains are naturally heterothallic

5.6 Hybrids evaluation for Miscanthus x giganteus hydrolysate tolerance 

 

Three selected hybrids (133, 272, 409), their respective parental haploids after UV 

irradiation (PE2dC16, PE2dC19, CAT4aC18, SA7aC10) that were used for mating, three 

haploids before UV irradiation (PE2d, CAT4a, SA7a), three reference strains PE-2, CAT-1, 

SA-1, and the laboratory strain S288C, were all evaluated for growth in synthetic complete 

medium (SC-80) supplemented with either 20%, 25%, 30% or 50% (v/v) of M. giganteus 

hydrolysate at 30oC for 48 hours in a 96-well microplate.  

 All strains were able to grow in 20% (v/v) of hydrolysate except for the laboratory 

S288C strain. CAT-1 showed less tolerance in this medium compared to the other evaluated 

strains (Figure 27a). In 25% (v/v) of hydrolysate, hybrids 133, 409 and CAT-1 showed less 

tolerance compared to the evaluated strains (Figure 27b).

 PE-2, PE2d, PE2dC16, PE2dC19, CAT4a, CAT4aC18 showed sensitivity in 30% 

(v/v) of hydrolysate as well as CAT-1, hybrids 133 and 409. PE2dC16 and PE2dC19 (after 

UV irradiation) showed more tolerance in 30% (v/v) of hydrolysate than PE2d (before UV 

irradiation) (Figure 27c). This result suggests that UV irradiation could have generated an 

advantageous mutation that improves hydrolysate tolerance. However CAT4aC18 (after UV 

irradiation) showed less tolerance than CAT4a (before UV irradiation) (Figure 27c).   

 SA-1, hybrid 272, haploids SA7a and SA7aC10 were the only strains that showed 

growth in 50% (v/v) of hydrolysate under oxygen-limited conditions (orbital shaker, 

frequency of 9.2 Hz; with an amplitude of 4.4 mm). SA7aC10 (after UV irradiation) showed 

more tolerance in 50% (v/v) of hydrolysate than SA7a (before UV irradiation) (Figure 27d).

5.8 Re-evaluation of 272-1a for M. giganteus hydrolysate tolerance  

 

 Haploid 272-1a was evaluated in more detail by growth in 40%, 45% or 50% (v/v) of 

hydrolysate compared to strains SA-1 and 272.  SA-1 was found to be more tolerant than 272 

in 40% and 45% (v/v) of hydrolysate (Figure 30); however haploid 272-1a was still the most 

tolerant strain of the three tested.

hours, in a 96-well microplate format. Each graph shows the average and standard deviation of 
three biological replicates 

 

5.9 Construction of xylose utilizing strains by integration of a three-gene cassette using 

Cas9 technology  

 

The most tolerant strains identified in this work (SA-1 and 272-1a) were engineered 

for xylose utilization by integration of a three-gene cassette (X123) into the URA3 locus. This 

cassette (KIM et al., 2013a) expresses three heterologous enzymes from Schefferomyces 

stipitis necessary for xylose utilization: xylose reductase (XYL1), xylitol dehydrogenase 

(XYL2) and xylulokinase (XYL3) (KIM et al., 2013b). 

 Proper integration of the X123 (Figure 31) cassette was confirmed by three methods: 

PCR analysis and Sanger sequencing (data not shown), lack of growth on minimal media, and 

resistance to 5-FOA.  Once proper integration was confirmed, each strain was then evaluated 

for growth in xylose.

! SA-1, SA-1-X123, 272-1a and 272-1a-X123 strains were evaluated in synthetic media 

(SC with no carbon source, SC with 4% of dextrose (SCD), SC with 4% of xylose (SCX), YP 

with no carbon source, YPD with 4% of dextrose, and YPX with 4% of xylose) at 30oC for 72 

hours, under an oxygen-limited condition and also anaerobically in a 96-well microplate 

format.  For all experiments S288C-X123 and JAY291-X123 strains (gift of Yong-Su Jin, 

UIUC) was used as references.  

 No growth could be observed in SC or YP (without sugar) in both conditions - either 

oxygen-limited or anaerobic (Figure 32a, Figure 32d, Figure 33a, Figure 33d).  As expected, 

all strains were able to growth in SCD and YPD in both oxygen-limited and anaerobic 

conditions. Only strains that contained the integrated xylose cassette were able to grow in 

SCX and YPX (Figure 32c, Figure 32f). Also SA-1-X123 and 272-1a-X123 were able to 

grow better than S288C-X123 and JAY291-X123 strains.

 In contrast, yeast strains with X123 cassette did not grow on xylose under anaerobic 

condition. However, 272-1a-X123 showed a poor growth in SCX (Figure 33c), suggesting 

that it could be improved by laboratory evolution (Figure 33c, Figure 33f).

 SA-1-X123 and 272-1a-X123 were further evaluated by batch fermentation in YPX at 

30oC under an oxygen-limited condition (shaking at 100 rpm). Both strains were able to grow 

using xylose as their sole carbon source and to produce ethanol (Figure 34).  

 SA-1-X123 and 272-1a-X123 exhibited more efficient fermentation in xylose medium 

than several previously published strains (derived from D452-2) that contain the XYL1, XYL2, 

and XYL3 genes (DX123, SR7, and SR7e3, KIM et al., 2013b).  While SA-1-X123 and 272-

1a-X123 took 60 hours to convert 40 g/L of xylose in 10 g/L of ethanol, DX123 took 120 

hours to metabolize the same amount of xylose into 1 g/L of ethanol.  Meanwhile SR7 (D452-

2 wild type strain expressing multiple copies of XYL1 and two copies of XYL2 and XYL3) can 

convert 40 g/L of xylose into ~9 g/L of ethanol in 120 hours (KIM et al., 2013b). Kim et al. 

(2013b) used evolutionary engineering to further improve xylose utilization.  Between the 

second and third transfer there was a significant  increase in growth rate and ethanol yield 

suggesting accumulation of some advantageous mutation(s), which turned out to be an allele 

of PHO13. While SR7 before evolution took 144 hours to metabolize 40 g/L of xylose into ~8 

g/L of ethanol, after evolution (SR7e3) took 24 hours to metabolize the same amount of 

xylose into 13 g/L of ethanol (KIM et al., 2013b). Their results suggest that balanced

5.10 QTL analysis 

 

 To identify the genetic basis of hydrolysate tolerance in haploid 272-1a X-QTL 

analysis was performed (EHRENREICH et al., 2010). A large pool of segregants was isolated 

and subjected to hydrolysate selection in a controlled bioreactor for about 100 generations. X-

QTL peaks were identified using published methods (PARTS et al., 2011; EDWARDS; 

GIFFORD, 2012) and custom Bash and R scripts (provided by Matthew Maurer, University 

of California Berkeley). A number of preliminary steps were needed to prepare 272-1a for X-

QTL analysis (mating type switching, deletion of the HIS3 gene, and confirmation of the 

tolerance phenotype in a controlled bioreactor), which are described below. 

 

5.10.1 Mating type switching   

 

 The mating type of 272-1a was switched by lithium acetate (LiAc) transformation 

using the plasmid pHS2, which expresses the endonuclease HO, and plated on hygromycin. 

After growth of isolated colonies (which are probably diploids), they were purified (by 

streaking twice on YPD-A plates without hygromycin to lose the plasmid). A purified colony 

was grown in 10 mL of YPD overnight at 30oC, harvested and inoculated in 10 mL of 1% 

potassium acetate to induce sporulation. Five tetrads were dissected and the resulting 20 

haploids were then evaluated in SC-80 supplemented with 40% (v/v) of M. giganteus 

hydrolysate (Figure 35a to Figure 35e). Although these haploids should be genetically 

identical, except for the MAT locus, differences in the hydrolysate tolerance phenotype were

process). Three MATa haploids (1a, 4a, 5d) were selected that were most tolerant to 

hydrolysate and then re-tested in SC-80 supplemented with 40% (v/v) of M. giganteus 

hydrolysate using JAY291, SA-1, 272 and 272-1a as controls (Figure 35f).

5.10.2 HIS3 gene deletion  

 

 The HIS3 gene was deleted in each of the three MATa strains selected above (Section 

5.10.1) using homologous recombination with short flanking homology arms and 

transformation of the PCR product using LiAc (see Material and Methods). Deletion of HIS3 

gene was confirmed by PCR amplification and histidine auxotrophy (i.e. lack of growth on 

SC-HIS plates) (Figure 36).

5.10.3 Evaluation of haploid strains MATa his3?::Nat-MX4 in hydrolysate  

 

 After HIS3 gene deletion, haploid strains – MATa his3?::NatMX4, were evaluated in 

SC-80 supplemented with 45% (v/v) of M. giganteus hydrolysate in a 96-well microplate at 

30oC for 48 hours in order to confirm the maintenance of hydrolysate tolerance. JAY291 was 

used as the reference strain. Deletion of the HIS3 gene did not affect growth in the presence 

of hydrolysate (Figure 37).

M. giganteus hydrolysate, grown at 30oC for 48 hours in a 96-well microplate. Graphs show the 
average and standard deviation for three biological replicates 

 

 Although these strains should be genetically identical, differences were observed in 

their tolerance phenotypes. Strains 1c_MATa his3?::Nat-MX4 and 4a_MATa his3?::Nat-

MX4 maintained full hydrolysate tolerance whereas 5d_MATa his3?::Nat-MX4 had a 

reduced tolerance phenotype. Based on this data, strain 4a_MATa_his3?::NatMX4 was 

chosen for the X-QTL study.  Before performing the X-QTL selection the tolerance 

phenotype was confirmed in a 1 L bioreactor format.

5.10.4 Pre-QTL: performance of 4a_MATa_his3?::Nat-MX4 in a bioreactor  

 

 The growth performance of 4a_MATa his3?::Nat-MX4 (APA 2877) was confirmed 

in a 1 L DASGIP® bioreactor containing 200 mL of SC-80 medium supplemented with 0% 

or  30% (v/v) of M. giganteus hydrolysate. S288C MM was used as the reference strain. As 

expected, strain 4a_MATa his3?::Nat-MX4 showed much higher hydrolysate tolerance than 

S288C MM confirming the results obtained in a 96-well microplate (Figure 38).  

 
a                                                                              b

a 1 L DASGIP® bioreactor) 

 

5.10.5 Selection of hybrids for QTL  

 

 After HIS3 gene deletion and confirmation of the hydrolysate tolerance phenotype for 

strain 4a_MATa his3?::Nat-MX4 (APA 2877), three hybrids were obtained by crossing with 

S288C MM (APA 5030). Three hybrids (APA 2879, APA 2880, APA 2881) (Table 4) were 

evaluated for their growth (OD600nm) in SC-80 supplemented with either 0%, 30% or 45% 

(v/v) of M. giganteus hydrolysate. The hybrids 2 (APA 2880) and 3 (APA 2881) showed the 

same growth as the selected haploid in 30% (v/v) of hydrolysate, while hybrid 1 (APA 2879) 

showed intermediate growth (OD600nm) compared to the parental strains. In 45% (v/v) of 

hydrolysate only APA 2877 showed growth (Figure 39). Hybrid 2 was chosen for pool 

selection (Sections 4.4.8.8 and 4.4.8.9).

MULTIPOOL methods (PARTS et al., 2011; EDWARDS; GIFFORD, 2012, Dr. Matthew 

Maurer, UC Berkeley) (Figure 40, Table 5, Table 6). We then used the control pool and 

selected pool genotypes (see Section 4.4.8.10) to map QTL intervals for hydrolysate tolerance 

(see Sections 2.8 and 4.4.8.11 for details). As expected, the three genetic markers (MAT, 

CAN1, LYP1 used for haploid segregants selection were identified as strong QTL peaks, 

confirming that the X-QTL method worked. However, most of the peaks were not strongly

selected and the resulting QTL intervals are very large. The hydrolysate selection needs to be 

repeated using a higher concentration of hydrolysate (i.e. stronger selective pressure) to 

produce sharper QTL peaks and smaller confidence intervals. Although the existing QTL 

intervals are large, we examined genes that are near the enter of each QTL peak, in order to 

identify genes that may be important for hydrolysate tolerance. Further fine-mapping studies 

will be necessary to identify the causative QTG(s) and QTN(s). However, in the qHZT-02a 

and qHZT-04a peaks, ALG14 and GLT1 were identified (Figure 41, Table 5, Table 6).

 The ALG14 gene encodes a component of UDP-GlcNac transferase (BICKEL et al., 

2005; CHANTRET et al., 2005; GAO et al., 2005). This enzyme is required for the second 

step of dolichyl-linked oligosaccharide synthesis (GAO et at., 2005). During N-linked 

glycosylation of protein, oligosaccharide chains are assembled on the carrier molecule 

dolichyl pyrophosphate in the following order: 2 molecules of N-acetylglucosamine, 9 

molecules of mannose, and 3 molecules of glucose. These 14-residue oligosaccharide cores 

are then transferred to asparagine residues on nascent polypeptide chains in the endoplasmic 

reticulum. As proteins progress through the Golgi apparatus, the oligosaccharide cores are 

modified by trimming and extension to generate a diverse array of glycosylated proteins 

(HERSCOVICS; ORLEAN, 1993; BURDA; AEBI, 1999). The identification of ALG14 in

QTL peak 02a suggest that N-linked protein glycosylation might play a role in hydrolysate 

tolerance. 

 The GLT1 gene encodes NAD(+)-dependent glutamate synthase, necessary for 

synthesis of glutamate from glutamine and alpha-ketoglutarate. Together with Gln1p, Glt1p 

forms the secondary pathway for glutamate biosynthesis from ammonia. It also plays a role in 

stationary phase and starvation conditions (MAGASANIK et al., 1992; VALENZUELA et 

al., 1998; PETROVSKA et al., 2014). The identification of GLT1 in QTL peak 04a suggests 

that amino acid metabolism plays a role in hydrolysate tolerance.

5.11 Genomic sequence analysis  

 

 The genome sequence of 272-1a was determined using both Illumina and Pacbio 

sequencing technology. A detailed analysis of the genome sequence is still in progress.  

However, the Illumina sequence data was used to identify variant sites relative to S288C 

(Matthew Maurer, UC Berkeley).  In addition, the genome sequence of the UV irradiated 

haploids was determined in order to identify causative mutations that may yield improved.

Direct mating of irradiated haploids and mass mating followed by adaptive evolution 

were successfully used to generate new hybrid strains with improved inhibitor tolerance. 

These hybrids provide a strain background further development of second-generation ethanol 

production strains. 

 

Breeding of large colony haploids generates a higher proportion of tolerant strains to 

molasses and hydrolysate media than breeding of small colony haploids. 

 

Selected strains presenting higher cell viability during fed-batch fermentation with cell 

recycling also presented higher cell trehalose and glycogen contents in a substrate with 

molasses and bagasse hydrolysate. 

 

Selected hybrid was able to generate haploid with better tolerance profile, suggesting 

that tolerance could be further increased. 

 

Integration of a three-gene cassette into haploid 272-1a and diploid SA-1 was 

necessary and sufficient to confer xylose fermentation. 

 

 The identification of ALG14 and GLT1 genes, in QTL peaks 02a and 04a, might play 

a role in hydrolysate tolerance.
