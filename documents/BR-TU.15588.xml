ABSTRACT: Cold tolerance of rice (Oryza sativa L.) during the reproductive stage is important to guarantee
high yield under low temperature environments. Field selection, however, does not allow identification of
adequate tolerance sources and limits selection of segregating lines due to variable temperature. The
objective of this study was to devise methods for distinguishing rice genotypes as to their cold tolerance at
the reproductive stage when evaluated under controlled temperature. The effect of cold temperatures was
investigated in six rice genotypes at 17°C for varying length of time (three, five, seven and ten days) at
two reproductive stages (microsporogenesis and anthesis). Cold tolerance was measured as the percentage
of reduction in panicle exsertion and in spikelet fertility. Evaluating cold tolerance through the reduction
in panicle exsertion did not allow for the distinction between cold tolerant from cold sensitive genotypes
and, when the reduction in spikelet fertility was considered, a minimum of seven days was required to
differentiate the genotypes for cold tolerance. Genotypes were more sensitive to cold at anthesis than at
microsporogenesis and, as these stages were highly correlated, cold screening could be performed at anthesis
only, since it is easier to determine. Rice cold tolerance at the reproductive stage may be characterized by
the reduction in spikelet fertility due to cold temperature (17°C) applied for seven days at anthesis.

TOLERÂNCIA AO FRIO DO ARROZ NO ESTÁDIO
REPRODUTIVO SOB CONDIÇÕES CONTROLADAS

RESUMO: A tolerância do arroz (Oryza sativa L.) ao frio no período reprodutivo é importante para
garantir alto rendimento em ambientes com temperatura baixa. No entanto, a seleção em condições de
campo não permite identificar fontes adequadas de tolerância e limita a seleção de linhas segregantes
devido à temperatura variável. Este trabalho teve por objetivo definir uma metodologia capaz de distinguir
genótipos de arroz quanto à sua tolerância ao frio no período reprodutivo quando avaliados sob temperatura
controlada. O efeito do frio foi investigado em seis genótipos de arroz submetidos a 17°C por períodos
variáveis de tempo (três, cinco, sete e dez dias) em dois estádios do período reprodutivo (microsporogênese
e antese). A tolerância ao frio foi avaliada por meio da porcentagem de redução na exerção da panícula e
na fertilidade de espiguetas. O resultados indicaram que avaliar a tolerância ao frio por meio da redução na
exerção da panícula não permitiu separar genótipos tolerantes ao frio de genótipos sensíveis e, quando
avaliada por meio da redução na fertilidade de espiguetas, no mínimo sete dias foram necessários para
diferenciar os genótipos quanto à tolerância ao frio. Eles foram mais sensíveis ao frio na antese que na
microsporogênese e, como estes estádios foram altamente correlacionados, a seleção sob frio poderia ser
feita somente neste estádio, que é de mais fácil determinação. Logo, a tolerância do arroz ao frio no
período reprodutivo pode ser avaliada por meio da redução na fertilidade de espiguetas devido à temperatura
baixa (17°C) aplicada por sete dias no estádio de antese.

INTRODUCTION

Low temperature during the reproductive stage
in rice causes degeneration of spikelets, incomplete
panicle exsertion and increases spikelet sterility
(Terres, 1991), thus reducing grain yield. In Rio

Grande do Sul State (RS), southern Brazil, cold tem-
perature occurs once every three years, causing yield
losses in excess of 25% (Terres &amp;amp; Galli, 1985). This
is also a serious problem in many other countries, such
as Japan, China, Chile, USA and Australia (Futsuhara
&amp;amp; Kikuchi, 1984; Alvarado &amp;amp; Grau, 1991; Guorui,



Cruz et al.256

1991; Tilquin &amp;amp; Detry, 1993; McKenzie et al., 1994).
Despite the importance of cold tolerance, breeding for
this trait in RS has been conducted mainly under field
conditions and this has led to limited genetic progress
due to variable temperature and differences in matu-
rity among breeding lines, leading to low selection
pressure. Evaluation of genotypes under controlled
conditions seems to be the only way to get a consis-
tent characterization of cold tolerance.

Several screening procedures have been de-
scribed for evaluating cold tolerance under controlled
environment, which employ a range of air temperatures
from 10 to 20°C (Lin &amp;amp; Peterson, 1975; Lee, 1979;
Khan et al., 1986; Andaya &amp;amp; Mackill, 2003;
Gunawardena et al., 2003) or cold water (19°C) for the
screening (Saito et al., 2001; 2003; 2004; Takeuchi et
al., 2001). A simple method that allows for an objec-
tive evaluation of rice genotypes to low temperatures
manipulated in the local breeding programs might
make the selection process easier and less costly. Fac-
tors such as genotype, temperature stress (intensity and
duration of exposure), phase of the reproductive stage,
and the interaction among them must be considered
when defining a screening method. In this context, the
objective of the present study was to identify a method
for the characterization of six rice genotypes in terms
of cold tolerance at the reproductive stage.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Six rice genotypes were studied (Table 1),
which were expected to differ as to their cold toler-
ance at the reproductive stage, with the Japonica geno-
types being tolerant and the Indica being sensitive.

Conduction of the experiment
The experiment was conducted in a green-

house at Cachoeirinha, RS (29°57’04’’S and
51°05’38’’O). Seeds were directCly sown in plastic
pots (19.5 × 16 cm) containing soil collected in the ex-
perimental field and fertilized with 2 g of NPK (2-20-
20). The number of pots per genotype was 30 and, 20
days after sowing; each pot was thinned to three plants

per pot. Nitrogen fertilization was applied 40 days af-
ter emergence using 2 g of urea (45% N) per pot.

Plants were kept in the greenhouse at 28°C and
when one or more tillers in a pot reached one of the
two reproductive stages (microsporogenesis or anthe-
sis), it was individually labeled as to its reproductive
stage and the whole plant was taken to an artificially
lighted room where the cold temperature treatment was
initiated. This room had a constant temperature of 17°C
and a photoperiod of 9h/15h and, after cold exposure
(three, five, seven and ten days), the pots were taken
back to the greenhouse. Light in the cold room was
provided by fluorescent and incandescent lamps and
corresponded to 1517.7 ?mol s-1 m-2. Differences in
light intensity and quality between the cold room and
the greenhouse were an uncontrolled variable, since in
the latter the radiation source was the sun. For each
genotype, some plants were kept permanently in the
greenhouse, as the control treatment.

At maturation each labeled tiller had its panicle
individually harvested and evaluated for the degree of
panicle exsertion and percentage of spikelet fertility.
Degree of panicle exsertion was measured as the rela-
tive distance from the flag leaf ligule to the panicle
ciliar node. Positive and negative values indicate com-
plete (flag leaf ligule below the panicle ciliar node) and
incomplete panicle exsertion (flag leaf ligule above the
panicle ciliar node), respectively. Percentage of spikelet
fertility was obtained by counting the number of filled
and empty spikelets and expressed as percentage of
filled spikelets in relation to the total number of spike-
lets in the panicle.

Determination of the reproductive stage
Microsporogenesis was determined by the dis-

tance between the ligule of the flag leaf and that of
the penultimate leaf (Yoshida, 1981), considering an
interval of –3 (flag leaf ligule below the penultimate
leaf ligule) to +10 cm (flag leaf ligule above the
penultimate leaf ligule) as the indicative of this stage
(Figure 1). Maximum microsporogenesis may vary,
however, within this range, depending on the genotype.
In some genotypes it may take place at –3 cm, in oth-

ers at zero, and in others at +8 cm. To avoid this in
the present study, an equal number of tillers were taken
for each value in the range –3 to +10 cm in each geno-
type, so this interval would be equally represented in
each of them.

Anthesis was considered as the beginning of
panicle exposure (Figure 1) and, in the case of flow-
ers already open, they were manually removed.

Treatments, experimental design and statistical
analysis

Experimental design was completely random-
ized, with a variable number of replications, which cor-
responded to the number of tillers evaluated in each
treatment. The treatments consisted of combinations
among levels of the three factors studied: genotype,
reproductive stage and duration of exposure to cold,
in a 6 × 2 × 4 factorial.

For each genotype, traits measured under the
cold treatment were expressed as percentage of reduc-
tion in relation to the control, which represented the
mean value of the traits measured in the genotypes kept
in the greenhouse.

Residual and regression analysis were per-
formed to verify data normality and the need for trans-
formation, respectively, and based on them percentage
of reduction in panicle exsertion had to be transformed
by the ? (x + 10). The analysis of variance was per-
formed considering a factorial experiment in the com-
pletely randomized design with fixed effects for the

factors, using the GLM (general linear model) proce-
dure of SAS (SAS Institute, 2000). Means were com-
pared by the Tukey-Kramer method (P &amp;lt;0.05), due to
the different number of replications per treatment.

Linear regression analysis was performed for
the factor duration of exposure to cold, in order to
verify the behavior of panicle exsertion and spikelet
fertility in relation to the increase in cold temperature
exposure. Five levels were used: three, five, seven and
ten days of cold exposure and the level zero, which
corresponded to the control.

Pearson’s coefficients of correlation were ob-
tained in order to verify the correlations between the
two traits in each stage and the correlations between
the two stages. All the analysis were performed in the
Statistical Analysis System (SAS Institute, 2000).

RESULTS

The main effects of the factors studied as well
as the first and second order interactions were highly
significant for the two traits (Table 2), indicating that
genotype, reproductive stage and duration of cold ex-
posure differed for the percentage of reduction in
panicle exsertion and in spikelet fertility under 17°C.
The significance of the second order interaction indi-
cates that each factor was distinctly affected by the lev-
els of the other two factors and vice-versa. For this rea-
son, the traits were studied considering all the levels
of the three factors simultaneously.

Percentage of reduction in panicle exsertion
The high reduction in panicle exsertion, more

than 100% (Table 3), is due to the fact that this trait
exhibited both positive and negative values, which cor-
responded to complete and incomplete exsertion, re-
spectively. Thus a reduction in the degree of panicle
exsertion from +2 cm in the control treatment, for ex-
ample, to -2 cm, due to cold temperature, would mean
a reduction of 200%. This also explains the higher co-
efficient of variation (CV) associated with this trait
(Table 2).

In all durations of cold exposure, reduction in
panicle exsertion was generally, larger at anthesis than

at microsporogenesis (Table 3). The only exception
was Quilla 64117, in which reduction in panicle
exsertion was observed only at microsporogenesis
(Table 3).

There was no clear distinction between cold
tolerant and sensitive genotypes in regard to reduction
in panicle exsertion in any of the stages and durations
of cold exposure (Table 3). The sensitive genotype IR
8 showed the largest reduction in this trait, differing
from the others in all durations of cold exposure and
stages (Table 3).

All genotypes showed the largest reduction in
panicle exsertion with ten days of exposure to cold,

both at microsporogenesis and anthesis (Table 3),
with the exception of IRGA 417 at anthesis, whose
reductions were not increased by longer exposure to
cold.

Percentage of reduction in spikelet fertility
Anthesis was the most sensitive stage to cold

when cold tolerance was measured as the reduction
in spikelet fertility (Table 4). With three days of
cold exposure there was no difference between
the stages of development, with the exception
of Diamante, which was more affected at anthesis.
From five days of exposure on, the majority of
genotypes presented the highest reduction in spike-
let fertility at anthesis, except for BRS 7 and Quilla
64117.

At both stages, the cold sensitive genotypes
BRS 7, IRGA 417 and IR 8 presented the highest re-
duction in spikelet fertility due to cold (Table 4). At
microsporogenesis, Diamante was the genotype with
the lowest reduction in spikelet fertility with ten days
of cold exposure, but at anthesis Quilla 64117 was the
least affected with seven and ten days of cold expo-
sure (Table 4).

The influence of duration of cold exposure on
the reduction of spikelet fertility in both stages de-
pended on the genotype, although only after seven days
of cold exposure it was possible to differentiate the
Japonica cold tolerant genotypes from the Indica cold
sensitive ones (Table 4).

Panicle exsertion and spikelet fertility as a function
of cold temperature duration

Regression analysis for panicle exsertion
showed that, except for Quilla 64117, all genotypes
experienced significant linear reductions in panicle
exsertion as cold temperature duration increased at an-
thesis (Table 5). At microsporogenesis, linear regres-
sion was significant only for the genotypes IR 8, BRS
7 and Diamante, but according to the coefficient of de-
termination it only explained most the variation in the
response for IR 8 (Table 5).

The linear regression for spikelet fertility as a
function of duration of cold exposure was significant
for all the genotypes, at both reproductive stages, with
the exception of Quilla 64117 at anthesis (Table 5), in-
dicating that the higher the cold duration, the higher
the decrease in spikelet fertility. From the coefficients
of determination it follows that at anthesis the model
explained most of the variation of spikelet fertility in
all genotypes in which it was significant except Quilla
64117, which did not happen at microsporogenesis.

DISCUSSION

In the present study cold tolerance was ex-
pressed as percentage of reduction in panicle exsertion
and in spikelet fertility due to cold in relation to the
control, which allows for evaluating cold tolerance per
se and not only the trait under stress (Datta &amp;amp; Siddiq,
1983). In a study where spikelet fertility was divided

into four components, Satake &amp;amp; Shibata (1992) found
that the genotypes differed in relation to some com-
ponents, as number of pollen grains, even in the ab-
sence of cold. With the procedure employed in this
study, of quantifying the amount of reduction in each
trait due to cold in relation to the control temperature,
interpretation errors caused by the genotype’s intrin-
sic factors were minimized and they were compared
under the same criteria.

Evaluation of these traits in the present study
indicated that the temperature of 17°C for only three
days was already capable of causing damage to the
plants and this damage varied according to the geno-
type and reproductive stage. It is known that tempera-
ture is an important factor in determining greater or
lower damage to plants. Studies under controlled tem-
perature have used variable temperature between day
and night (Lin &amp;amp; Peterson, 1975; Gunawardena et al.,
2003) or constant temperature, which has varied
from 10 to 20°C (Lin &amp;amp; Peterson, 1975; Lee, 1979;
Khan et al., 1986; Andaya &amp;amp; Mackill, 2003). In choos-
ing the temperature for performing these evaluations,
it is important to consider that lower temperatures al-
low for the identification of highest levels of tolerance
and high temperatures help identify moderate toler-
ance. It has been reported that temperatures between
15 and 17°C are critical for cold tolerant genotypes and
between 17 and 19°C for cold sensitive ones
(Nishiyama et al., 1969 apud Terres, 1991). For this
reason the choice was for 17°C as the cold tempera-
ture for the tests reported herein, and the different lev-
els of stress were given by the variation in the dura-
tion of exposure to this temperature.

In all durations of cold exposure and stages
tested, Indica genotypes were more sensitive than
Japonica, when cold tolerance was evaluated by means
of percentage of reduction in spikelet fertility. This was
already expected, since the Japonica subspecies is gen-
erally considered more cold tolerant than Indica (Saito
et al., 2004). With regard to the percentage of reduc-
tion in panicle exsertion however, subspecies separa-
tion was not clear in any of the stages and cold dura-
tions (Table 3). The two traits evaluated were not cor-
related during microsporogenesis, but showed a signifi-
cant moderate correlation at anthesis (0.35**). The data
suggest that the percentage of reduction in spikelet fer-
tility is a more reliable way of evaluating cold toler-
ance in the genotypes studied. Damage caused by cold
temperature in panicle exsertion and spikelet fertility
may have distinct physiological bases, because while
decreases in exsertion are a result of the effects on
celular division and elongation, decreases in fertility
result from damage during pollen grain formation and
germination. Thus, these differences may explain the
lack of distinction among the tolerant and sensitive
genotypes when evaluated by panicle exsertion in re-
lation with what was observed for spikelet fertility,
where good distinction was possible.

Considering the percentage of reduction in
spikelet fertility, the largest reductions occurred when
cold was applied at anthesis, indicating that cold sensi-
tivity was higher at this stage (Tables 4 and 5). Among
the cold tolerant genotypes this was even more evident,
because despite being superior to the sensitive ones at
both stages, their degree of tolerance was higher at the
microsporogenesis stage (Tables 4 and 5). These results

Cold tolerance of rice in controlled environment 261

Sci. Agric. (Piracicaba, Braz.), v.63, n.3, p.255-261, May/June 2006

were unexpected since rice is considered more sensitive
to cold at microsporogensis than at anthesis (Lin &amp;amp;
Peterson, 1975; Nishiyama, 1984). Considering that the
maximum microsporogenesis occurs at some point be-
tween the interval –3 to 10 cm and this interval was rep-
resented for each genotype, it may be concluded that
microsporogenesis was misidentified when compared to
anthesis. This may also suggest that the longest cold
durations affected the panicles at anthesis more
uniformily than at microsporogenesis, leading to the
higher cold sensitivity for anthesis. Significant correla-
tions were found, however, between microsporogenesis
and anthesis for the percentage of reduction in panicle
exsertion (0.78**) and for percentage of reduction in
spikelet fertility (0.74**), suggesting that selection for
cold tolerance is possible by subjecting plants to cold
in only one stage. In this case, anthesis would be better
because besides being more sensitive to the temperature
of 17°C for the two traits evaluated, its determination
is easier and more precise, regardless of genotype. Lee
(1979), also reported high correlation between anthesis
and microsporogenesis with regard to spikelet fertility
and recommended anthesis for the evaluation of rice
cold tolerance.

Besides the stage in which the plant is to be
evaluated, duration of exposure to cold is also impor-
tant, because it defines the degree of stress that will
be imposed. According to Bertin et al. (1996), shorter
periods allow for the detection of genotypes that are
more sensitive and longer periods favors tolerant geno-
types. For the genotypes evaluated in this study, a mini-
mum of seven days was necessary to distinguish tol-
erant from sensitive, at both stages, based on reduc-
tion in spikelet fertility. In the present study exposing
rice genotypes to the temperature of 17°C for seven
days at the anthesis stage allowed for the distinction
between cold tolerant and cold sensitive genotypes in
terms of percentage of reduction in spikelet fertility.
This method may be useful if precise evaluations of
potential parents as well as segregating generations of
a breeding program for cold tolerance at the reproduc-
tive period are needed.
