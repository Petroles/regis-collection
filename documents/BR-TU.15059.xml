RESUMO 

O avanço tecnológico da microeletrônica permitiu o aumento da 
capacidade de transporte de informações dos microprocessadores e a 
redução do seu tamanho, tornando os computadores mais rápidos e 
menores. Porém, esses avanços apresentam consequências como uma 
maior taxa de produção de calor por efeito Joule, elevando a temperatura 
de operação desses componentes. Para garantir as condições de 
operação, são empregados dispositivos com capacidade de transferir 
grandes taxas de calor. Dentre estes dispositivos, se encontram os tubos 
de calor em circuito ou LHP’s (Loop Heat Pipes). No segmento 
aeronáutico, devido ao crescente uso de equipamentos eletrônicos, as 
tecnologias de tubos de calor, mais especificamente de LHPs, têm sido 
cada vez mais utilizadas, pois são passivas, podem funcionar sem o 
auxílio da gravidade e transportam o calor a média e longa distância. As 
estruturas capilares que compõem estes dispositivos são fabricadas 
basicamente de materiais porosos metálicos, poliméricos ou cerâmicos. 
Para materiais metálicos sinterizados, diversos arranjos de materiais e 
estruturas têm sido testados, visando aumentar a capacidade de troca 
térmica do dispositivo. A grande dificuldade no emprego de materiais 
metálicos como o cobre é a possibilidade de se formar vapor no interior 
do meio poroso, bloqueando o fluxo de fluido de trabalho pelo 
dispositivo, causado pela elevada condutividade térmica do elemento 
poroso. Associada ao uso de materiais porosos sinterizados de cobre, é 
usada água como fluido de trabalho, por sua compatibilidade química e 
pelo maior número de mérito dentre os fluidos de trabalho mãos 
comuns. Porém, a água apresenta uma variação muito baixa da pressão 
de saturação com relação à temperatura, de forma que deve-se projetar 
evaporadores com pequenas perdas de carga e mínima transferência de 
calor parasita para a câmara de compensação. Se uma quantidade 
considerável de vapor é produzida na câmara de compensação, este 
permanece confinado, bloqueando total ou parcialmente o fluxo de 
fluido de trabalho, impedindo o fluxo de vapor no canal do evaporador e 
o retorno do condensado para a região de bombeamento capilar e, 
consequentemente, aumentando a resistência térmica total do 
dispositivo. Nesse trabalho foi realizada uma análise teórica e 
experimental da transferência de calor e massa em meios porosos 
sinterizados, considerando-se mudança de fase do fluido de trabalho no 
evaporador de tubos de calor em circuito. Modelos matemáticos para as 
propriedades termofísicas dos meios sinterizados de cobre, empregados 



no evaporador de um LHP, foram propostos e comparados com dados 
experimentais. Nesta análise, foram estudados os parâmetros 
geométricos críticos para o projeto de um evaporador para um tubo de 
calor em circuito, considerando-se como parâmetro de entrada as 
características geométricas do material particulado utilizado na 
fabricação da estrutura capilar do meio poroso sinterizado do tubo de 
calor em circuito, assim como a temperatura de operação e a massa de 
fluido de trabalho.

ABSTRACT 
 

Technology advances in microelectronic systems lead to the 
development of high speed processing, with microprocessors of smaller 
sizes, which are ever lighter and faster. Conversely, these advances lead 
to the increase of the heat flux dissipation requirements. In this context, 
highly conductive heat transfer devices, able to remove the generated 
heat from electronic components, are required. Among these devices, 
heat pipes and loop heat pipes (LHP) are increasingly considered for the 
thermal management of electronic components. In aeronautics, where 
the use of electronic components has increased in the last decade, the 
heat pipes and loop heat pipes (LHP) are progressively being considered 
for thermal control due to the capacity to transfer large amount of heat, 
through short to considerable long distances, without the use of 
mechanical pumps or refrigeration systems. The wick structures that 
constitute these devices are basically made from metal, polymer or 
ceramic sintered porous media. Several arrangements have been tested 
for metal sintered porous media, in order to increase the heat transfer 
capacity of the LHP. The main concern of using copper is the possibility 
of blockage of the working fluid flow within the LHP, due to the 
presence of vapor inside the wick. Actually, due to the high thermal 
conductivity of porous media, vapor can be formed inside the wick, 
remaining confined, which can block fully or partially the working fluid 
passage along the evaporator. Associated with copper sintered porous 
media, water is selected as the working fluid due to its chemical 
compatibility with the copper and due to its large figure of merit in 
comparison to other working fluids. However, water presents a low 
variation of the saturation pressure as a function of temperature. This 
characteristic requires the design of evaporators with minimum pressure 
drop and minimum parasitic heat flows (heat leak) to the compensation 
chamber. Actually, an undesired heat leak to the evaporator 
compensation chamber may produce vapor, which may remain confined, 
fully or partially blocking the working fluid flow, and, consequently, 
increasing the total thermal resistance of the device. In this work, 
theoretical and experimental heat and mass transfer analyses of a copper 
sintered porous media, considering working fluid phase change, in a 
LHP evaporator, is developed. Mathematical models for the 
thermophysical properties of the copper sintered porous media were 
proposed and compared with experimental data. Analyses were 
performed on critical geometry parameters to LHP design, which 



includes the geometry characteristics of the powder used in the sintered 
porous media fabrication, as well as the operating temperature and the 
working fluid mass. 

 
Keywords: Loop heat pipes, sintered porous media design tool,

RESUMO EXPANDIDO 
 
 

ANÁLISE DA TRANSFERÊNCIA DE CALOR E MASSA EM UM 
TUBO DE CALOR EM CIRCUITO EM COBRE  

 

Introdução 

Os Tubos de Calor em Circuito (Loop Heat Pipes - LHP) e os 
Circuitos de Bomba Capilar (Capillary Pumped Loops - CPL) são 
dispositivos utilizados para transporte eficiente de calor. Uma de suas 
principais aplicações está no controle de temperatura de equipamentos 
eletrônicos, especialmente os localizados em satélites e aeronaves. 
Ambos são considerados variações da tecnologia dos tubos de calor 
clássicos, onde as regiões do evaporador e do condensador são 
separadas, hidraulicamente conectadas por pares de tubos, por onde 
circula apenas ou vapor ou líquido condensado. O bombeamento 
promovido pela estrutura capilar desloca o fluido de trabalho através do 
dispositivo e o vapor é transportado para a região do sumidouro de calor 
(condensador). As bombas capilares, que são estruturas responsáveis 
pelo bombeamento capilar do fluido de trabalho em LHPs, são 
fabricadas basicamente a partir de materiais porosos metálicos, 
poliméricos ou cerâmicos. Porém, em estruturas capilares metálicas, 
pode haver bloqueio do fluxo de fluido de trabalho através do meio 
poroso no interior do sistema de bombeamento capilar, devido à 
formação indesejável de vapor no seu interior. Na realidade, deseja-se 
que a formação de vapor ocorra em regiões próximas às paredes das 
bombas capilares, o qual deve escoar por ranhuras localizadas nesta 
região e projetadas para este fim. Porém, se o elemento poroso tem 
elevada condutividade térmica, pode-se formar vapor no interior deste 
meio, permanecendo confinado e bloqueando total ou parcialmente o 
fluxo do fluido de trabalho. Neste caso, o fluxo de vapor através do 
canal do evaporador é prejudicado, assim como o retorno do condensado 
para a região de bombeamento capilar. Desta forma, a resistência 
térmica total do dispositivo aumenta sensivelmente. Quanto menor o 
dispositivo, mais importante se torna este efeito. 

A capacidade de transportar calor está diretamente relacionada 
à eficiência da estrutura porosa em proporcionar o transporte do fluido 
de trabalho, a qual por sua vez, depende da geometria do evaporador e 
de sua estrutura porosa. Neste contexto, modelos matemáticos, capazes 



de predizer o comportamento térmico e hidráulico de bombas capilares, 
foram desenvolvidos nesta tese para o projeto de dispositivos eficientes. 

Propriedades como condutividade térmica efetiva e 
permeabilidade do meio poroso estão intrinsicamente ligadas tanto aos 
limites de operação quanto às respostas térmica e hidráulica dos LHPs. 
Nesta tese também foram desenvolvidos modelos matemáticos que 
relacionam propriedades importantes do meio poroso, tais como: 
condutividade térmica efetiva, porosidade, permeabilidade, etc., com o 
diâmetro da partícula do pó de cobre utilizado na fabricação do meio 
poroso da bomba capilar. A curva de aquecimento empregada no 
processo de sinterização também é um parâmetro de entrada nestes 
modelos. 

Finalmente, baseado nas ferramentas teóricas desenvolvidas na 
tese, foram projetados, construídos e testados dois tubos de calor em 
circuito. Os resultados experimentais apresentaram boa comparação com 
as predições dos modelos desenvolvidos nesta tese. 

 

Objetivo 

O principal objetivo desta tese é desenvolver uma análise teórica e 
experimental da transferência de calor e massa no evaporador de um 
tubo de calor em circuito, cuja estrutura porosa foi fabricada a partir de 
pó de cobre sinterizado, considerando-se mudança de fase no interior da 
estrutura e um fluido que satura o meio. 

 

Metodologia 

Esta tese está estruturada da forma apresentada a seguir. 
Inicialmente são apresentados os princípios físicos fundamentais que 

regem o funcionamento de tubos de calor em circuito (LHPs). São 
discutidas as compatibilidades entre materiais e fluido de trabalho, 
assim como as condições termodinâmicas de operação. Posteriormente, 
uma descrição do processo de sinterização dos meios porosos estudados 
é apresentada. Amostras de pós de cobre metálicos que apresentam 
diferentes tamanhos de partículas, obtidas pelo processo de 
peneiramento de um pó de cobre comercial, foram empregadas na 
fabricação da estrutura sinterizada. Modelos matemáticos para a 
condutividade térmica efetiva, permeabilidade e do raio efetivo do poro 
do meio poroso sinterizado são propostos. Bancadas experimentais e 
equipamentos de medição são empregados para avaliar as propriedades 



 
 

estudas e os resultados são comprados com os modelos experimentais 
desenvolvidos.  

Na segunda parte, foca-se na modelagem térmica e hidráulica do 
evaporador e do LHP. Foi proposta uma expressão para calcular a 
relação crítica entre a espessura e o comprimento da camada de estrutura 
porosa no evaporador.   

A descrição e a análise do procedimento de projeto do evaporador do 
LHP, com base nos modelos desenvolvidos são apresentadas. Um 
modelo matemático acoplado para determinar os campos da temperatura 
e da pressão é desenvolvido. As soluções analíticas das equações de 
conservação de massa, momento e energia utilizando o método de 
separação de variáveis são obtidas e a taxa de calor transferida para a 
câmara de compensação é calculada a partir de um balanço energético 
realizado sobre o modelo físico proposto. Baseados nos modelos 
desenvolvidos, dois LHPs foram projetados e construídos para trabalhar 
com água e metanol, respectivamente. Uma bancada experimental para 
avaliar o desempenho dos LHPs projetados é apresentada e os dados 
experimentais obtidos são comparados com as predições dos modelos. 

 

Conclusões 

Neste trabalho, foram desenvolvidos modelos para a previsão 
da distribuição de temperatura e pressão do material poroso usado como 
estrutura capilar, para um evaporador de LHP de forma cilíndrica. O 
estudo da estrutura porosa do evaporador nesta tese é composto por uma 
zona ativa de evaporação, isto é, um cilindro oco onde o calor da fonte 
de calor é transferido para a superfície de evaporação (menisco) e outro 
cilindro sólido que separa a câmara de compensação da a zona de 
evaporação. 

Modelos matemáticos para a distribuição de temperatura, 
considerando geometria bidimensional (2D) e unidimensional (1D), 
foram desenvolvidos. Para o modelo de pressão, foi utilizada apenas 
uma abordagem bidimensional (2D). Os modelos térmico e de pressão 
2D, acoplados, permitem a determinação dos parâmetros da geometria 
que garantem o desempenho correto do evaporador, isto é, sem a 
formação de bolhas de vapor dentro dos meios porosos. Deste estudo 
observou-se que os modelos 2D são ferramentas úteis para o projeto da 
estrutura porosa do evaporador do LHP, capazes de garantir um modo 
de operação seguro. No entanto, o modelo térmico 2D não considera a 



perda de calor através da parede do evaporador, apenas através da 
estrutura porosa com a câmara de compensação.  

Com base nos resultados 2D, que mostraram um 
comportamento muito próximo a fenômenos unidimensionais, tanto de 
distribuição de temperatura quanto de pressão, foi desenvolvido um 
modelo térmico 1D. Embora muito simples, este modelo, que faz uso da 
analogia entre circuito térmico e elétrico e permite contabilizar as perdas 
de calor do evaporador para a câmara de compensação e para a parede 
do evaporador, capturando o comportamento térmico real do 
evaporador. A distribuição de temperatura ao longo do condensador do 
LHP também foi obtida a partir deste modelo. Complementando a 
modelagem de um LHP, modelos de perda de pressão para fluidos, tanto 
monofásicos como de duas fases, também foram usados nas linhas de 
líquido, de vapor e no condensador. 

Os campos de temperatura e pressão mostram que a interface 
entre o cilindro sólido e oco é a região crítica a ser controlada para 
garantir o perfeito funcionamento do LHP, uma vez que, quando a carga 
de calor é aumentada, é possível que temperaturas superiores às críticas 
sejam atingidas, formando assim vapor e reduzindo a taxa de 
transferência de calor, aumentando consequentemente a queda de 
pressão no interior da estrutura porosa do evaporador. Assim, avaliou-se 
a possibilidade de formação de bolhas no interior da estrutura porosa, 
em termos de temperatura e pressão, comparando estas condições com 
um critério de para determinar a formação de bolhas dentro da estrutura 
capilar (estudos de ebulição). 

Uma expressão teórica do parâmetro de projeto de estruturas 
porosas, que determina condições satisfatórias de operação do 
evaporador do LHP, ?/l (espessura/comprimento do evaporador), a qual 
relaciona as propriedades termodinâmicas do fluido de trabalho com as 
propriedades termofísicas dos meios porosos, foi proposta para a 
determinação da espessura do evaporador. Dois LHPs foram projetados 
e fabricados para avaliar este critério teórico: um para operar com água e 
outro para operar com metanol. Os testes com os LHPs fabricados 
validaram o parâmetro crítico, mostrando que a equação proposta pode 
ser usada como ferramenta para a determinação da espessura do meio 
poroso em um LHP. 

Para a concepção de um meio poroso sinterizado com 
propriedades desejáveis (porosidade, permeabilidade, raio efetivo do 
poro e condutividade térmica efetiva), foram propostos modelos, onde o 
parâmetro de entrada é o diâmetro médio de partícula utilizadas na 
fabricação do meio poroso sinterizado. O processo de sinterização foi 



 
 

descrito utilizando modelos da literatura. Foi desenvolvido uma bancada 
experimental para medir as propriedades termofísicas e os dados obtidos 
foram comparados com valores teóricos, mostrando uma boa 
comparação. 

Foi feita uma análise estatística para determinar o efeito 
principal dos parâmetros geométricos e da condutividade térmica efetiva 
sobre a resposta térmica da geometria de estrutura porosa proposta nesta 
tese. Dois tipos de pós foram selecionados para produzir quatro meios 
porosos diferentes, resultantes da combinação das relações entre os 
parâmetros ?/l e ?/l, onde ? é a espessura da estrutura de porosa na zona 
ativa de evaporação, ? é o comprimento da estrutura de porosa inferior 
que separa a câmara de compensação da zona de evaporação e l é o 
comprimento da zona ativa de evaporação. Uma análise de variância 
(ANOVA) para um intervalo de confiança de 95 %, mostraram que os 
parâmetros: condutividade térmica efetiva e relação ?/l, no intervalo ?/l 
crítico &amp;lt;?/l&amp;lt;1,2· ?/l crítico, têm efeitos significativos sobre a resposta 
térmica (temperatura e perda de calor) da estrutura porosa do 
evaporador. Testes experimentais com um LHP operando com 
diferentes quantidades de fluidos, mostraram respostas coerentes com os 
inventários de fluido propostos para tubos de calor (HP) na literatura.

1 INTRODUCTION 

Advances in microelectronic systems, especially in computer related 
technologies, resulted in high speed processing, while the dimensions of 
the electronic components decreased, resulting in smaller, lighter and 
faster equipment. Conversely, these advances lead to the increase of the 
rate of heat dissipation per volume. Therefore, most of this thermal 
power must be removed to keep the operating temperatures within safe 
levels. In this context, high performance heat transfer devices, able to 
remove the excess of heat from electronic components, are required. 
Among others, heat pipes and related technologies have been 
increasingly considered for the thermal management of electronic 
devices for terrestrial and space applications.  

Aeronautics is one area where the use of heat pipe technologies has 
augmented in the last decade, in modern airplanes are increasingly 
electric/electronic. Heat pipes and loop heat pipes (LHP) are gradually 
being considered for the thermal control of aircraft guidance and control 
electronic systems as well as for passenger amusement devices (e.g. 
video, internet, telephone, etc.).  

Actually, heat pipes, and other related technologies, are able to 
transfer large amount of heat through short to considerable long 
distances, without the use of mechanical pumps or refrigeration systems, 
which could produce undesirable vibrations and maintenance. 

Loop Heat Pipes can be considered a variation of the classic heat 
pipes. Their major characteristic is the separation between the 
evaporator and the condenser sections that are connected by tubes that 
conducts or liquid (condensate) or vapor. Figure 1 shows a schematic of 
the operation of a LHP, with a cylindrical evaporator and a finned tube 
condenser.  

 
Figure 1 - Scheme of operation of a Loop Heat Pipe. 

 
When heat is supplied to the evaporator, the working fluid within 

this region, which is in saturating condition, changes of phase from 
liquid to vapor and the resulting vapor flows to the condenser through a 



40 
 

vapor line. In the condenser, the heat is reject and the vapor changes 
phase from vapor to liquid and the condensate is conducted back to the 
evaporator through a liquid line, which, in turn, is connected to the 
compensation chamber (liquid reservoir attached to the evaporator) and, 
finally, to the evaporator, closing the loop. 

The wick structure located in the evaporator provides the capillary 
pressure to pump the working fluid along the LHP. These capillary 
structures can be made from metal, polymer or ceramic materials. 
Maydanik et al. (2011b) show that LHPs in which wick structure is 
made of copper and water is the working fluid, achieved the highest 
capacity of heat power transfer. However, especially for this specific 
combination of materials, the design and fabrication of the evaporator 
wicks represent a challenge to the engineers, researchers and 
manufacturers. Due to the high thermal conductivity of porous media, 
vapor can be formed inside the wick, remaining fully or partially 
confined, blocking the working fluid inside the evaporator, resulting in 
the dry out of the LHP. In addition, an undesired heat leak from 
evaporator to the compensation chamber may increase the temperature 
and pressure of the working fluid, causing the collapse of the device. 
Besides, as the water presents high latent heat and high surface tension, 
a low variation of temperature can affect the pressure level of the 
working fluid, preventing the start-up of the device.  

Actually, the heat transferred to the wick structure caused the 
working fluid phase change. To keep the structure full of liquid, the 
evaporated mass must be replenished by the porous media. Therefore, 
the capillary structure must have both characteristics: enough capillary 
pressure to guarantee the fluid pumping over the whole loop and enough 
permeability to allow the liquid to flow through the evaporator. 
Structures with small pores have high capacity of capillary pumping but 
reduced permeability. Overall parameters such as effective thermal 
conductivity, permeability and effective porous radius can predict the 
response of the wick structure for heat and mass transfer. One process 
used to manufacture these media is sintering of metallic powder. In this 
process, necks are formed among the contact points of the particles, 
providing the bonding among the particles, responsible for the 
mechanical and geometric characteristics of the wick. Also, through 
these necks, heat is conducted along the media. Therefore, the geometry 
of necks involves important parameters that depend on the media 
sintering temperature and on the size of the powder particles.  

At this point, the following question arises: what is the best 
evaporator design that guarantees the performance of a LHP? The 



41 
 

 
 

design procedure must involve transport phenomena models (heat and 
mass transfer) and the selection of geometry of the wick structure. The 
resulting evaporator must satisfy the application requirements 
(temperature, geometry and heat transport capacity) and should 
guarantee that the device is able to transport the desired heat. This 
means that the evaporator must operate within its heat transfer limits, 
avoiding dry out. Models to be used as tools for the evaporator design 
should satisfy the first law of thermodynamic and so, must include the 
thermodynamic state of the working fluid. A global design scheme of an 
efficient LHP evaporator tool must contain the necessary models and 
their interactions with the operation requirements, including heat 
transfer limits and thermodynamic conditions, as presented in Figure 2.  
 

 

Figure 2 - Summary of the design of a LHP evaporator. 
 

In this work, a simple geometry, easy to fabricate LHP is proposed. 
Theoretical and experimental heat and mass transfer models of a copper 
sintered porous media located in a LHP evaporator is developed. As a 
result, the critical design parameters of a LHP evaporator, including 
characteristics of the powder geometry, used in the fabrication of the 
wick structure, are determined. Through the characteristics of the 
metallic powder used, the thermophysical properties of the sintered 
porous media can be controlled. The performance of fabricated LHPs is 
compared with predictions of heat and mass transfer mathematical 



42 
 

models which input parameters are the thermodynamic properties of 
LHP component materials.  

The first main focus of this thesis is on the analytical modelling the 
geometry characterization of the evaporator porous media, including the 
determination of the effective thermal conductivity, permeability and 
effective porous radius. Mathematical models are proposed to determine 
the thermophysical properties of the wick, taking the mean diameter of 
powder particles and the neck radius as the controlling parameters. The 
output of these models works as input of the thermal and hydrodynamic 
models that describe the thermal behavior of LHP evaporators.  

Therefore, the second model is focused on analytical models, based 
on the conservation equations of mass, momentum and energy, which 
were developed for prediction of temperature and pressure fields within 
the porous media of the evaporator. Thermodynamic equilibrium 
relations are used to couple all the elements of the LHP studied. The 
objective of this model is to provide a tool for the design of evaporators 
of loop heat pipes able to transport the desired heat power at the desired 
temperature level. 

Finally, based on the theoretical tools developed along the thesis, a 
LHP was designed, constructed and tested. The testing results were 
compared with the predictions from the model.  

 
1.1 Objectives 

 
1.1.1 General Objective 

 
The main objective of this thesis is to perform a theoretical and 

experimental analysis of the heat and mass transfer of a LHP evaporator,

change that happens within the porous media, considered saturated with 
working fluid.  

 
1.1.2 Specific Objectives

1.2 Thesis Organization  

 
This work is presented as follows.  
 
In chapter 1, a brief introduction of the present thesis subject and the 

objectives of the present work are presented. 
In chapter 2, to introduce the subject of the present investigation, the 

LHP working principles are presented, as well as the physical 
characterization of the materials and the fluid used and their operating 
thermodynamic conditions. 

In chapter 3, the descriptions of porous media and sintering 
processes are presented. Models for permeability, effective thermal 
conductivity and effective porous radius are presented. Careful sieving 
of a commercial powder resulted in different powders used for the 
fabrication of different sintered media. Several experimental set ups 
were constructed for this study; the test procedure is presented in details 
and the data obtained is compared with the theoretical results.  

In chapter 4, an equation to calculate the critical relation between the 
length and thickness of the porous media layer in the evaporation region

procedure, based on the developed models, is presented. A coupled 
mathematical model to determine the temperature and pressure fields are 



44 
 

developed. Analytical solutions of the conservation equations of mass, 
momentum and energy using the separation of variables method are 
obtained and the heat leak to the compensation chamber is calculated, 
from an energy balance performed over the proposed physical model. 
An experimental apparatus to evaluate LHP performance is presented 
and the experimental data obtained are compared with the model 
predictions. 

It is important to note that the present thesis organization is “paper 
oriented” as several papers, corresponding to sections or chapters of this 
thesis were published in journals and/or presented in national and 
international conferences. Therefore, the literature review is not 
concentrated in only one chapter but divided according to the chapter 
subject. In Table 1, the published articles are listed and related with the 
chapters or sections of the present thesis. Actually, as one can note 
along this work, the organization within the chapters and sections 
follows the usual order of the related paper.

2 HEAT PIPE TECHNOLOGIES WORKING PRINCIPLES 

The objective of this chapter is to describe the physical working 
principles of the devices analyzed in the present thesis, more specifically 
heat pipes (HP) and loop heat pipes (LHP). More detailed literature 
reviews will be presented along the other chapters. 

 
2.1  Heat pipes 
 

Heat pipes (HPs) are devices with high capacity to transfer thermal 
energy, also known as “heat super conductors”. These devices utilize the 
phase change of a working fluid to transfer heat from a source, like an 
electronic chip, transistor or computer processing unit, to a sink, such as 
the ambient, a fin-arrangement heat sink assisted by a fan, etc. Heat 
pipes are composed of a metallic case, internally lined with a porous 
media layer, which is filled with a working fluid. Heat Pipe is divided in 
three sections: evaporator, adiabatic and condenser (see Figure 3). When 
heat is supplied to the evaporator, the working fluid changes of phase. 
This vapor flows to the condenser through the internal channel. In the 
condenser section, heat is rejected and the saturated vapor within this 
section, changes of phase and the condensate flows through porous 
media back to the evaporator. Capillary pumping provides the driving 
force necessary to the condensate fluid to return to the evaporator. The 
capillary structure responsible for the working fluid pumping from 
condenser to evaporator, can be made from sintered porous media, 
metallic meshes or grooves.  

Paiva and Mantelli (2015) developed and modeled mathematically a 
HP composed by diffusion welding of a sandwich of several parallel 
copper wires between two flat plates. Paiva and Mantelli (2015) 
proposed other more efficient design, using sintered porous media in the 
evaporator and copper wire flat plates in the adiabatic and condenser 
sections. This hybrid configuration increased the heat transfer capacity 
compared to sintered wick HPs. Operational tests in a notebook, assisted 
by this new technology HP, showed a reduction of 5.11 °C in the 
computer processor temperature, compared to the original device. 

The volume of working fluid, inserted in a heat pipe, must be 
sufficient to saturate completely the capillary structure. Actually, high 
capillary pumping is obtained with small wick porous. However, small 
porous increase the liquid pressure drop and decrease the capacity of the 
liquid to flow through the porous media. Therefore, there is an optimal 



46 
 

wick design that combines high pumping capacity with pressure drop. 
Flórez et al., (2012) fabricated and tested heat pipes using two layers of 
copper powder sintered wick structures, increasing the device heat 
transfer capacity. However, despite of the porous media improvements 
reported in the literature, the liquid pressure drop and the countercurrent 
liquid-vapor dragging forces limit the distance between evaporator and 
condenser. Loop heat pipes (LHPs) are proposed as HP technology 
alternative solution to increase the distance between evaporator and 
condenser. A description of the main principles of LHP operation is 
presented in the following section. 

 

Figure 3 - Scheme of operation of a heat pipe. 
 
2.2  Loop heat pipes 
 

Loop heat pipe (LHP) is a variation of classic HPs. The main 
characteristic is these devices lies in the separation between the 
evaporator and condenser sections, that are connected by tubes where 
vapor from the evaporator and condensate liquid from the condenser are 
separately transported. In Figure 4, a flat plane evaporator LHP is 
shown. 

In LHP, all the wick structure and therefore the pumping capacity of 
the device is located in the evaporator. This gives a higher geometrical 
flexibility for device. The vapor produced in the evaporator, where heat 
is delivered, is transported to the condenser section by vapor tubes, with 
a low level of perturbation. In the condenser section, in steady state 



47 
 

 
 

conditions, all the heat transported is delivered to the heat sink. It must 
be noted that the capillary structure across the entire extension of HPs 
actually limits the distance which the heat is able to be transported 
between the source and the sink. In LHPs, this distance can be increased 
and so the heat transport capacity. 

 
Figure 4 - Loop heat pipe. 

 
One major characteristic for LHPs is the presence of a working fluid 

reservoir that ensures the constant supply of working fluid to the 
capillary pumping system. This reservoir is located beside the 
evaporator section and is commonly denominated as “compensation 
chamber” and, therefore, is joined thermally and hydraulic to the 
evaporator across a channel. LHP evaporator usually has geometry flat 
or cylindrical, as shown in Figure 5.  

 
2.2.1 Working Fluid 
 

Several factors must be considered in the selection of the working 
fluid to be used in heat pipes and loop heat pipes. According to Peterson 
(1994a), the range of temperature, vapor pressure, thermal conductivity, 
compatibly with material of wick structure, case, stability and toxicity 
are important aspects to be considered in the selection of the fluid in the 
design and fabrication stage. Reay and Kew (2006) presented data that 
describes the compatibility for same working fluid with different 
materials, typically used in heat pipes, which are summarized in Table 
2. By compatibility, one understands the chemical reaction among the 
capillary structure, the casing material and the working fluid, which can 
cause the production of non-condensable gases.

Ku (1999) considers that the mass of working fluid M in cool 

condition, that is, without applied thermal load in the evaporator and 
condenser, at minimum temperature level must satisfy the following 
equation:

where Vloop is the total volume of LHP minus the volume of the 
compensation chamber, ? is the fraction of compensation chamber 
occupied by liquid and ?l,c, ?v,c are the densities of liquid and vapor, 
evaluated at minimum operation temperature. Also, the mass of fluid 
can be estimated at condition of the high temperature, using the 
equation:

where Vliq is the volume of liquid line, Vw is the porous volume of the 
capillary structure, ?l,H  and ?v,H are the densities of liquid and vapor, ? is 
the fraction of free volume (not filled with liquid) in the compensation 
chamber. Once ? e ? are properly selected, the volume of compensation 
chamber can be calculated. In extreme conditions, LHP have to contain 
the amount of fluid equivalent to volume of liquid at maximum 
temperature in which the device starts the operation. This is mass can be 
calculated by:  
 

 ? ? ??,!?" ???

? ? ?

 ?, (2.3) 
 
where ?l,max is the density of liquid at maximum LHP operation 
temperature. In literature, the LHP liquid load is related to its total 
volume. Singh et al., (2009) tested a LHP with flat evaporator that 
operated normally with a working fluid volume ranging between 50 % 
and 80 % of the total volume of the device. The LHP presented dry out 
for fluid load below 50 % and the active area of condenser was not 
enough to remove the heat for a fluid load above 80 %. 
 
2.2.2 Thermodynamic process 
 

The thermodynamic states of the working fluid within a LHP can be 
represented in a pressure-temperature (PT) and pressure-specific volume 
diagram (Pv), as shown in Figure 6a and 6b, respectively. In the 
evaporator, the liquid evaporates at the meniscus (1). Actually, the 



50 
 

liquid-vapor meniscus, formed in the external surface of the wick 
structure, provides the capillary pressure drop, represented by the 
pressure difference between points (8) and (1) (Figure 6a), responsible 
for the liquid pumping along the LHP. The resulting vapor (2), which is 
in the superheated state, leaves the evaporator and flows through the 
vapor line duct (2-3). Also, the tube temperature levels decrease if the 
duct loses heat to the ambient. This happens if the tube external wall is 
not well thermally insulated and the ambient temperature is lower than 
the tube temperature. At point (3), vapor enters the condenser where 
heat is removed. Phase change starts when the vapor saturation state 
temperature is achieved. This is supposed to happen in the first section 
of the condenser (4-5). When the liquid leaves the condenser (6), the 
liquid is subcooled. Then, the condensate liquid flows through the liquid 
line and enters the compensation chamber (7). Then, the liquid flows 
through the porous structure (8) where it warms up, due to the heat input 
in the evaporator, reaching the liquid-vapor interface (1) in the 
meniscus, in the saturate conditions, closing the cycle. The fluid 
transportation within vapor and liquid lines generates pressure drops. A 
schematic representation of the LHP operation is shown in Figure 6c. 

When the liquid reaches the liquid-vapor interface (8), the liquid is at 
the saturation pressure, corresponding to the local evaporator 
temperature. Actually, the heat transferred through the wick structure 
solid matrix is the responsible for the working fluid phase change. 
Therefore, saturation states 7 and 8 are thermodynamically linked and 
must satisfy the following equation (FAGHRI, 1995; KU, 1999; 
MAYDANIK et al., 2011): 

 
 ?$ ? %&amp;amp;%'(' ?), (2.4) 

which also can be written as: 
 

 &amp;amp;*+&amp;amp;,,'*+',, ? %&amp;amp;%'(',, , (2.5) 
 
where Pv and Tv are the pressure and temperature of the evaporator, 
while Pcc and Tcc are pressure and temperature of the compensation 
chamber, respectively. The term dP/dT is the slope of the pressure-
temperature saturation line at Tcc and this rate depends on the working 
fluid.

2.3  Conclusions 

 
In this chapter, the physical phenomena that drive the heat transport 

capacity of HP and LHP were presented. The understanding of the 
working principles is fundamental for the several models developed and 
presented in the subsequent chapters of this thesis.

3 CHARACTERIZATION OF SINTERED POROUS MEDIA: 
MODEL AND DATA 
 

 In the present thesis, sintered porous media are used as capillary 
structures in the fabrication of the evaporator in LHP. This structure 
provides higher capillary pump that usual mesh or grooved wick 
structures. In this chapter, an analysis of the fundamental parameters 
involved in sintered wick fabrication process as well as the effective 
thermophysical properties of the resulting porous media will be present. 
The study is focus on wick structures obtained using copper powder. 
Each subsection is formed of an introduction where definitions and 
literature review is presented. Consistently, a mathematical model is 
proposed with the objective of relate the properties study with the mean 
particle diameter as parameter of enter. Experimental setups fabricated 
and used in the measured of each property also are descripted. Finally, 
the results and conclusions are discussed, both proposed, and literature 
models are compared with experimental data. 
 
3.1 Sintered process 
 

Sintering is one of the techniques used to process particulate 
materials, aiming among other purposes, the fabrication of porous 
media. Thümmler and Oberacker (1993) describe the sintering as 
thermally activated material transport, which happens in a bulk of 
compacted powder, where the specific surface area is reduced by the 
growth of the contact between the particles. The neck size depends on 
parameters such as: rate of heating, time, temperature of sintering, 
particle material and mechanisms of mass transport.  

The grain growth and the densification occur by means of the mass 
transport mechanism. Swinkels and Ashby (1981) divide the sintering 
process according to the transport mechanisms: surface diffusion, 
diffusion in the grain boundary and evaporation (see Figure 7). The 
grain boundary diffusion occurs due to defects in grain (vacancies, gaps 
and inconsistencies). According to these same authors, these transport 
mechanisms contribute to the growth of the neck but only the boundary 
and lattice diffusion contribute to the densification of the material. The 
sintering process can be divided in the following stages: formation and 
growth of the necks, densification and particulate material grain growth. 
Thümmler and Oberacker (1993) state that micro welding in the 
contacting areas within particulates form micro bridges (necks), which 



54 
 

size depends on the compression pressure. During the sintering, the 
shape of the sintered material does not change very much after 
compression. 

 

Figure 7 - Mass transport mechanism in sintering process. 
 
Ashby (1981) affirms that the superficial diffusion is the dominant 

mechanism for copper powder sintering and propose the following 
expression to determine the neck growing rate, given by ?? :

the superficial diffusion, ?s is effective superficial thickness, ? is the 
atomic volume, 23  is the constant of Stefan-Boltzmann and T is 
temperature. df is considered as the driving force of the sintering process 
and can be calculated from the expression:

of spherical particles r and the neck radius x is:

3.2  Porosity 

 
 This section presents a mathematical model that relate the sintered 
porous media porosity with the particle average diameters and sintering 
temperatures, aiming its application in the design of capillary structures 
for heat pipes and loop heat pipes. Copper is the material employed in 
the present study, as it has been used as a typical wick material due to its 
good chemical compatibility with water (probably the most used 
working fluid in heat pipes) and due to the facility of manufacturing.  
 The literature recognizes that the porosity is an important parameter 
for modeling and designing heat pipes and loop heat pipes (FAGHRI, 
1995; FLOREZ; NUERNBERG; PAIVA, 2012; MAYDANIK et al., 
2011; PETERSON; 1994) and usually links porosity with the effective 
thermal conductivity and permeability, especially for sintered porous 
media (ATABAKI; BALIGA, 2007). 
 Powder, with disperse particle size distribution, were separated 
through successive sieving to obtain narrow bands of particle sizes. 
Several sintered porous media made from these powders were fabricated 
and the porosity measured. The circularity of particles was measured to 
evaluate the influence of particle shapes in the resulting porous media. 
Experimental data is used in the comparison with the theoretical models. 
 
3.2.1 Physical model 
 

The powder particles from which the porous media is made are 
modeled as spheres of uniform radius r. Several packing configurations 
can be observed, when the same diameter spheres are in contact. In 
Figure 8, four packing configurations according to German (1989), are 
presented. These arrangements are employed to determine the 
theoretical porosity of a sintered porous media. The porosity is defined 
as the ratio between the empty volume (voids) and the total volume of a 
tridimensional box unit cell. The unit cell represents the particle packing 
and voids throughout the porous media for regular packing 



56 
 

arrangements. The unit cell edge corresponds to the line connecting the 
center of two adjacent spheres. In some arrangements, a sphere can be 
allocated in the center of the box. The spherical particles are 
mechanically bounded by means of a neck formed during the sintering 
process. The number of contact points in the box is determined 
according to neighbor spheres and depends on the packing arrangement 
considered. The edge angles of the “unit cell box” faces are represented 
in Figure 8. 

 

Figure 8 - Packing model.  a)Cubic, b)Orthorhombic, c)Tetragonal, 
d)Rhombohedric. 

 
The following hypotheses were adopted: 

• Sintering process shrinkage is not considered. In the initial 
sintering stage, neck growth occurs and superficial mass 
diffusion is the dominant mass transfer mechanism (KANG, 
2005). 

• The sintered porous media is considered isotropic; thus the 
porosity is the same in all directions. 

• Cubic packing scheme is adopted for modeling the porosity 
(Figure 8a). 

 
3.2.2 Mathematical model 

 
The porosity is calculated as the ratio between the void and bulk 

volumes of the unit cell. The void volume is calculated by subtracting 
from the volume of one cell, the volume corresponding to one sphere 
(two hemispheres) and half the volume of the necks (one neck for each 
sphere contact, according to packing scheme considered). Table 3 
presents the literature expressions for the determination of the unit cell 
volume for each packing arrangement and the number of contacting 
spheres.

For example, to calculate the porosity for a cubic packing 

arrangement, where each sphere particle has 6 neighboring particles, the 
porosity is calculated using the following expression:  

 
 D ? ?E ? ?/ ? F,C ???E  (3.5) 

 
where Vt is bulk volume, Vs is the solid volume and Vn is the neck 
volume determined as:

where the first term represents the volume of a revolving solid about its 
longitudinal axis of radius r(z) over the interval [z1,z2] and the second 
term represents the portion of the volume of a sphere, cut off by a plane 
in z1 and z2 heights. Supposing r(z) constant, the neck geometry 
approaches to that of a disk of radius rn: 

 &gt;?I? ? &gt;? ? ?2 ? &gt;2 =? ? &gt;!&gt; ? &gt;! ? (3.7) 
On the other hand, h is defined as: 

 ? ? IC ? IP2  (3.8) 



58 
 

This parameter can be expressed in terms of r and rm, yielding: 

 ? ? &gt; =1 ? &gt;&gt; ? &gt;! ? (3.9) 
Therefore, the Equation (3.6) can be written as:  

?? ? 2G?&gt;&amp;lt;?2 ? &gt;2 =? ? &gt;!&gt; ? &gt;! ?@
C

? G3&amp;lt;&gt; =1 ? &gt;&gt; ? &gt;! ?@C Q3&gt;
? &gt; =1 ? &gt;&gt; ? &gt;! ?R 

(3.10) 

Using this expression and the well know expressions for the 
determination of the sphere and cube volumes, one can easily determine 
the porosity using the Equation (3.5). This model can be adjusted by 
adding information of particle shape such as the circularly factor. The 
powder particle shape depends basically of the manufacture process. 
The powder copper used in this work is obtained by atomization process 
in water. In this process, the particles obtained presents irregular form. 
Images obtained by electronic microscopy of the copper powder show 
that smaller particles present circularly factor closed of 1 and decreases 
as size increases. 
 
3.2.3 Experimental procedure 

 
Atomized copper powder was employed during this study. Copper 

sintered porous media was selected as the object of the present study 
due to its chemical compatibility with water and its facility of 
manufacture as mentioned above. This material was employed in 
fabrication of samples, where the porosity and effective thermal 
conductivity were measured and presented in this study. Tests were 
conducted to determine the content of copper in the composition of the 
particulate material and a percentage of 95.45 ± 1 % of copper were 
observed. According to the ASM (1990) tables for pure copper and its 
alloys, the composition of the powder is similar to the copper alloy 
C21000, which has the thermal conductivity of 234 W/(K?m) at 20 °C. 
Physical properties of copper, provided by Swinkels and Ashby (1981) 
and shown in Table 4, where employed in the present work. 



59 
 

 
 

Particles of different sizes were obtained from successive mechanical 
vibration siftings of atomized copper powder obtained in the market and 
known commercially as PAM. The sieving process was conducted in 
equipment in batches with 300 g mass of powder PAM, during three 
hours. A set of sieves of mesh ASTM 100,150,250,275,300, 400 and 
500 were employed.  

The characterization of the particle size was made by laser 
granulometry, using the Fraunhofer diffraction method and the 
equipment Mastersizer 2000. Figure 9 presents the particle size 
distribution for PAM copper powder. 

 

 
 

 
 
Image analyses was employed to determinate the porosity of each 

sample. The image processing can be basically separated into four steps: 
image acquisition, preprocessing, segmentation, pattern recognition, and 
quantification. Mathematically, a monochrome digital image is 
represented by a function f(x,y) of luminous intensity of gray levels  of 
each point(pixel) image. The software counts the number of black (solid 
particles) and white (voids) pixels, allowing the calculation of porosity, 
according to the percentage area of each phase in the image. The 
software ImagemJ® was used to determine the porosity. The tested

samples have cylindrical geometries, with radio of 20 mm and thickness 
of 3 mm (see Figure 10). Each sample was made using a loose powder 
sintering process. The sample was deposited inside a cast made by 
stainless steel 304, as cooper has no chemical interaction with stainless 
steel, which facilitates the copper sample removal from the stainless 
steel casing. The sintering process was conducted in a vacuum (0.1 Pa, 
approximately) furnace with a controlled atmosphere of commercial H2. 
The heating rate was 5 K/min until the sintering temperature is 
achieved, in which level the samples stayed for more than 3000 s. The 
specimens were embedded in acrylic resin by vacuum impregnation, to 
preserve the porous structure integrity. Without the impregnation 
process, the porous structure could be deformed, during the polishing 
step. The porous media samples were submitted to a metallographic 
process, to get a flat surface free of scratches, so that the acquisition of 
appropriate images by optical microscopy (OM) was possible. Surface 
Preparation was performed in two operations, following the 
recommendations of ASM (1990): rough polishing, where 400, 600, 
1200 and 4000 grit, with water as the vehicle and a wheel speed of 
approximately 200 rpm were employed; and finish polishing, where 
finer alumina (Al2O3) 0.3-?m on napped cloths are used. After 
polishing, the specimen is rinsed in water and dried with warm air. This 
process was used to obtain a better digital image quality as surface 
scratches produce inaccuracies when porous media properties are 
measured employing image analysis. The digital image analysis was 
performed with a reflected light microscope at the Characterization 
Materials Laboratory (LCM/UFSC - Brazil). Digital images were taken 
from 20 different regions of each sample, using objective lenses at 
magnifications of 50, 100 and 200 times. The measuring uncertainties 
were calculated from the standard deviation of the 20 measurements.

3.2.4 Results and conclusions 
 
Figure 11 presents the particle size distribution and the binary 

images corresponding to each of the particles studied in this work. As 
already mentioned, the size of the particles was obtained by sifting 
atomized copper powder, resulting in particle sizes classified as A, B, C, 
D, E and F, in increasing mean particle diameter order. The Figure 11 x-
axis represents the equivalent spherical diameter of particles (in 
micrometers) and the y-axis represents the percentage (in volume) 
particles corresponding to the x-axis entry. The distribution functions of 
all types of powder analyzed showed a similar behavior, following a 
typical normal distribution. However, powder A presents a bimodal 
distribution. Actually, the present paper authors believe that this effect is 
due to the agglomeration of particles, as small particles present high free 
energy due to the high superficial area in relation to its volume, which 
produces particle cohesion. Figure 11 also presents, in the right side, 
binary images of the porous media made of the powder characterized at 
the left side. These images were obtained from an optical microscopic 
and processed by the software ImagenJ®. As already mentioned, in these 
images, white represents the sintered powder and black the pores. 
Binary images show that increasing the particle diameter also increases 
the porosity of sintered media. One should note that these media were 
sintered at a temperature of 850 ºC. 

Figure 12 presents a comparison between the experimental data and 
the predictions of the porosity proposed model, considering the four-
packing structure as shown in Figure 8, as a function of the particle 
mean diameter. One can note that the experimental porosity tends to an 
approximately constant value for particles of diameter larger than 
50 ?m. For porous media made from small particles (diameter smaller 
than 50 ?m), the porosity decreases, reaching a value of 0.30. Form this 
figure one can also note that the model based on sphere packing tends 
quickly to a constant porosity value, as the influence of the necks 
volume decreases as the particle increases and so, the packing void 
volume tends to a constant number which leads the porosity to reach a 
value of around 50 % for the cubic arrangement model. Observing 
Figure 12 one can conclude that cubic packing is the best theoretical 
particle arrangement configuration, as it presents the best comparison 
with data, with an average difference between data and model of about 
18.8 %.

The image obtained from electronic microscopy MEV, for 
powder PAM, shows a particle circularly factor of 0.74. The circularly 
factor changes with the particle size as shown in Figure 13a. 

In Figure 13a, a plot of the porosity as a function of the average 
particle diameter, in micrometers, for powders A, B, C, D, E and F is 
presented. Powder A showed a circularly factor of 0.85 while other 
powder was approximately 0.71. Actually the particles are non-circular 
and so, the perfect sphere lattice model may not be an accurate physical 
model for the porosity of the media. Therefore, the theoretical model 
may be adjusted to include the effect of particle non-circularity by a 
correction factor of 0.71 in equation (3.5). The present author 
acknowledge that the circularly factor may not be representative of all 
atomized particles as their geometry can change with the powder 
fabrication parameters, but, on the other hand, they are comfortable in 
proposing this circularity correction factor, as the particle images 
observed in this work are very similar to those published in literature 
(LAWLEY, 1992). 

 

Figure 12 - Porosity models without circularly factor. 
 
Figure 13b presents the adjusted theoretical model inserting a 

circularly factor in term associated to sphere volume in Equation (3.5). 
In this figure one can see that the data now compares well with the cubic 



64 
 

and orthorhombic packing models, for diameters larger than 50 ?m. 
Other important aspect in packing particles to consider is the variation 
of the particle diameters in the powder used for sintering. Small 
particles with diameters equal or smaller than the interstices left by the 
larger particles can be accommodated within these interstice spaces, 
reducing porosity. Also particle geometric characteristics such as 
roughness, prevent the spreading of particles during the powder 
deposition, resulting in media with scattering formation.

3.3  Effective thermal conductivity 
 

 Effective properties are usually used to define the physical 
characteristics of the porous materials. The effective thermal 
conductivity, for instance, is determined considering the thermal 
conductivity of the constituent phases of the material, i.e, the solid phase 
(matrix) and the fluid phase (liquid or gas).  
 Much of the heat transfer work in the literature treats all porous 
media equally, independently of the technology employed for their 
fabrication. Actually, there is a large difference among porous media 
produced by different technologies, as observed in sintered and bed 
packed metal powder. Usually, a distinction is made between the 
thermal conductivity of densified (or sintered) and not densified porous 
media. Carson et al. (2003) and Atabaki and Baliga (2007) verified that 
the thermal conductivity of a non-sintered material is much smaller than 
that of sintered materials.  
 In literature, an interesting model for the effective thermal 
conductivity based on experimental data was proposed in the PhD thesis 
of Alexander (1972) for metal felts, sintered powders, layers of wire 
cloth and unconsolidated beads. Sintering is also used in screens to 
produce heat pipe capillary structures. Atabaki and Baliga (2007) took 
literature models for non-sintered porous media (just packing spheres) 
and, by comparing with experimental test data, proposed a correlation 
for sintered porous media.  

Although Birnboim, Olorunyolemi and Carmel (2001), in their 
numerical study related the effective thermal conductivity with the 
fabrication process and modeled porous media as spheres in thermal 
contact, it can be affirmed that, in general terms, the literature 
theoretical models lack to associate the effective thermal conductivity 
with process fabrication parameters, such as: sintering temperature, 
particle size and geometry of the ceramic powder particles.  
 In this work, the physical association among effective thermal 
conductivity, porosity and mean diameter of the particle used for the 
fabrication of sintered porous media is analyzed. The analogy with 
electrical circuits was used to model the effective thermal conductivity, 
which physical model consists of two hemispherical particles joined by 
a neck, with a fluid layer around them. Thermal resistances are 
associated with the heat transfer paths of the unit cell, so that an 
expression of the effective thermal conductivity is obtained.  



66 
 

 Powder, with disperse particle size distribution, were separated 
through successive sieving to obtain narrow bands of particle sizes. 
Several sintered porous media made from these powders were fabricated 
and the porosity measured. The circularity of particles was measured to 
evaluate the influence of particle shapes in the resulting porous media. 
Experimental data is used in the comparison with the theoretical models. 
 
3.3.1 Physical model 
 

The physical model adopted to determine the theoretical effective 
thermal conductivity of a sintered porous media is displayed in Figure 
14. The model is based on the thermal analysis of a unit cell, which 
represents the whole porous media. The actual porous media can be 
reproduced by stacking several of these cells in a vertical arrangement 
and replicating this pile in a horizontal array, forming a three-
dimensional structure, according to several possible packing models as 
shown in Figure 8. As it will be explained later, in the present work, this 
cell applied to a cubic arrangement (Figure 8a). The cell is formed by 
two metal hemispheres of radius r. The hemispheres represent half of a 
solid metal particle of the powder from which the porous media is made. 
These radiuses are considered equal and equivalent to the powder mean 
radius. The hemispheres are joined by means of a neck formed during 
the sintering process. A stationary liquid film, in a hollow hemisphere 
shape, is considered around the hemispheres. x is the radius of the neck, 
given by the distance between the sphere contacting point and the neck 
outer radius, in the plane tangent to the contacting point. rm is the radius 
of the meniscus formed by the neck, in the plane which contains the 
center of the spheres (see Figure 14). The rectangular coordinate system 
origin is located in the center of one of the hemisphere with the abscissa 
crossing both the sphere centers. The empty space between adjacent 
cells is filled with stagnant liquid film in such a temperature level which 
allows one to neglect the heat exchanged with the solid hemispheres and 
within the liquid film.

All the geometric parameters must be determined as a function of r, 

which represent the size of the particles that compose the powder used 
for the porous media fabrication. These diameters are obtained from the 
statistical treatment of the distribution dimensions of particles. The 
radius of neck is calculated from the sintering curve theory. The 
effective thermal conductivity of porous media is calculated from a heat 
balance, where the following hypotheses were adopted: 

• Steady state. 
• Planes perpendicular to the plane shown in Figure 14 are 

isothermal.  
• Thermal equilibrium in the solid-fluid interface.  
• Solid and fluid constant properties.  
• The fluid layer surrounds and wets completely the particles. 

The fluid layer is considered stagnant; therefore, convective 
effects are neglected. 

• Prescribed temperatures T2 and T1, where T2 &gt; T1, are 
imposed to the two borders of the cell (see Figure 14) 

• All powder particles have spherical shape, have the same 
radius and are statistically represented by the mean 
diameter.   

• The neck has circular shape in the plane perpendicular to the 
heat flux.  

• Compaction external forces and phase change are not 
considered. 

 
3.3.2 Mathematical model 
 

The analogy between thermal and electrical circuits is used to model 
the effective thermal conductivity of the elementary cell just described. 
The resulting thermal circuit, consisting of two resistances in parallel, is 
present in Figure 15. In this figure, the thicker arrow refers the lower 
resistance path where larger amount of heat is transferred, while the 
thinner arrow refers to the large resistance path, where lower amount of 
heat is transferred. The first path is associated with the resistance due to 
the conduction heat transfer through the hemispheres (constriction 
resistance Rhs), in series with the neck Rps resistance. The other path is 
associated with the static fluid surrounding the spheres (Rl) and includes 
the resistance of the disk formed by the fluid in the neck (Rpl). This last 



69 
 

 
 

resistance is considered negligible. The s superscript refers to solid and l 
to liquid. The overall resistance of this circuit is determined by:

Figure 15 - Thermal equivalent circuit modeling the effective thermal 
conductivity. 

 
Flórez et al. (2013) measured the effective thermal conductivity of 

sintered copper porous media saturated with water, air and at vacuum. 
They concluded that the liquid resistance is much larger than the solid 
resistance and, therefore, the liquid resistance path can be removed from 
the circuit, resulting in:  

 
 SE ? S? / ? SZ /  (3.12) 

  
The effective thermal conductivity can be estimated, based on the linear 
approximation of the Fourier equation. For a unit cell, one gets: 

 2[55 \ ?)C ? )P ?] ? ?)C ? )P ?SE  (3.13) 



70 
 

which gives:
 

 2[55 ? ]\SE  (3.14) 
 The one-dimensional Fourier Equation (3.15) is also employed for 
the calculation of the thermal resistances of the neck region, for both 
liquid and solid phases, assuming that ^L is constant and A(z), the cross 
section area, is variable, which gives: 
 

 ^L ? ?2\?I? 4)4I  (3.15) 
 
This expression can be integrated in the form:  
 

 ^L H 4I\?I?

This integration of the Equation (3.16) results in:

The term in parentheses in the Equation (3.17) represents the inverse 

of neck thermal resistance:

Based on the geometry, the following expression for the neck radius 

as a function of its geometric parameters is proposed:

The thermal resistance of the neck solid phase becomes:

where z1 = r1 cos?1 and z2 = r1(2 - cos?1) are the lengths in z direction, 
measured from the sphere center (see Figure 14).  

Considering ( )r z  and substituting it by rm in the equation (3.20), the 
neck resistance can be presented as: 

 
 S?/ ? 2?G2/ ?&gt;! ?C (3.21) 

 
Substituting Equations (3.7) and (3.9) in this expression, one has the 
following equation for the neck resistance:  
 

 S?/ ? 8&gt; A1 ? ??V?mBG2/ n? ? &gt; A"V?m?V?m BoC (3.22) 
 
The constriction thermal resistances of the full (solid) and shell 

(liquid) hemispheres (RLs and RLl, respectively) were calculated 
employing the model presented by Yovanovich et al.  (1978), developed 
for the conduction heat transfer between solid or hollow spheres in 
contact. In this model, the heat flux enters the elementary cell by the left 
flat circular area of radius r maintained at temperature T1 and it is 
released to the right area maintained at temperature T2 (see Figure 14).  
The heat delivered to the hot hemisphere is constricted to the neck 
region when passing to the other hemisphere and then spread in the cold 
hemisphere. The same happens to the liquid shell. The lateral walls of 
the elementary cell are considered insulated. The solid and hollow 
sphere constriction thermal resistances are obtained from the exact 
temperature distribution solution of the heat equation in spherical 
coordinates, as a function of directions r and ?, solved by Yovanovich et 
al. (1978). Their solution is given in terms of a series. Bahrami et al. 
(2006) presented a simplified expression for Yovanovich et al.  (1978) 

solution, valid for a specific range of contact angles. In this thesis, a 
study similar to that presented by Bahrami et al.  (2006) was performed, 
but for a wider range of the solid contacting angles. The following 
expression for the constriction resistance is obtained:  



72 
 

 
 SZ/ ? 0.562/ ?  (3.23) 

Actually, the value of the constant proposed by Bahrami et al. (2006), 
instead of 0.56, was 0.5.  
 Substituting Equations (3.22) and (3.23) in the overall thermal 
resistance, Equation (3.12), one gets:  
 

 SE ? 0.562/ ? ?
8&gt; A1 ? ??V?mBG2/ n? ? &gt; A"V?m?V?m BoC (3.24) 

 
From Equation (3.13), the total resistance can also be defined as 
Rt=L/keffA. The porosity can also be defined in terms of areas (for 
constant thickness porous media) as: 
 

 D ? \E ? \/\E  (3.25) 
 
So that the total thermal resistance is: 
 

 SE ? 2&gt;P?1 ? D?2[55 \/  (3.26) 
 
Matching Equation (3.24) and (3.26), a non-dimensional effective 

thermal conductivity of the sintered porous can be determined:

8&gt; A1 ? ??V?mBG n? ? &gt; A"V?m?V?m BoCu

This Equation will be used latter to compare with literature data that 
include porosity as entry parameter.

3.3.3 Experimental procedure 
 
The effective thermal conductivity in the different types of powder 

obtained from sieving of PAM copper powder was measured using a 
thermal conductivity analyzer C-thermal Tci. According to manufacturer 
of device, Thermal Conductivity Analyzer employs a model transient 
heat transfer to calculate the thermal conductivity. A cylindrical sample 
is placed on the plane sensor. A known current is applied to the sensor's 
spiral heating element, providing a small amount of heat, which warms 
up the interface between the sensor and the sample, inducing a variation 
in the voltage readings of the sensor. Then, the rate of increase in the 
sensor voltage is used to determine the thermal properties of the sample. 
A photography and scheme of the experimental setup is presents in the 
Figure 16. Cylindrical samples with 25 mm of diameter and 5 mm of 
thickness was used to measure the effective thermal conductivity. To 
guarantee the plane face in the sample, it was sanded until obtained a 
planes superficies. The samples also were saturated with distillated 
water.

3.3.4 Results and conclusions 
 
In this subsection, the effective thermal conductivity measured to the 

different powers is presented and compared to theoretical model. The 
experimental data obtained by Flórez et al. (2013)  are also analyzed. 
The Equation (3.27) expresses non-dimensional effective thermal 
conductivity as a function of the neck radius and porosity. Substituting 
the porosity given by Equation (3.5) into Equation (3.27), one can have 
the effective thermal conductivity becomes a function of powder particle 
radius only.  

In Figure 17, the neck radius is plotted against the average particle 
diameter, for two different temperatures of sintering. In this figure, it is 
possible to observe that the neck is more sensitive to variations of the 
neck radius for small diameter particles, where a slope curve change is 
observed for particles diameters about 20 to 30 µ m. One can also see 
that the sintering temperature influences the neck formation: the higher 
the temperature, the higher the neck radius. Also, the differences 
between the neck radiuses for media sintered at these two temperatures 
levels varies from zero do around 15 %.

Figure 18 presents the comparison between the effective thermal 
conductivity calculated from the theoretical model presented in this 
work and with two sets of experimental data (run 1 and 2) obtained for 
copper sintered porous media fabricated in Labtucal at 850 °C from 
powders PAM (around 50µ m) and PAC (around 20 µm), saturated by 
distilled water, obtained by Flórez et al. (2013). The results of the 
effective thermal conductivity measured in the samples obtained from 
sieved of PAM copper powder showed the dependency of the effective 
thermal conductivity with particle size and neck compared to the 
proposed models (cubic and Orthorhombic). The results of effective 
thermal conductivity for particle diameter lower than 60 ?m present a 
difference that increases as the average article diameter decreases. The 
higher difference was obtained to the effective thermal conductivity 
measured to copper powder with average particle diameter of 22.23 ?m, 
it was a 45.7 % above of the value predicted by the proposed models. 
The lower difference of 6.8 % was to sample with the average particle 
diameter equal to 68.81 ?m when compared to the orthorhombic model. 

 

 
Figure 18 - Effective thermal conductivity model against average particle 

diameter. 
 
Even, in Figure 18, the results of the effective thermal conductivity 

based in cubic and orthorhombic packing arrangement show best 



77 
 

 
 

comparison with experimental data: for cubic model, the highest 
difference is 23.3 % and for the orthorhombic model, it is 11.5 %. One 
should note that the theoretical orthorhombic model curve is within the 
experimental uncertainty reported by the present author in Flórez et al. 
(2013), represented by vertical bars in this graphic. Note that, in this 
figure, the porosity model which provides the input parameter for the 
effective thermal conductivity model was not corrected by the 
circularity factor, as non-circular spheres where not taken into account 
in the physical model, which schematic is shown in Figure 14. 

One can see that experimental data obtained by Flórez et al. (2013) 
showed the best comparison with the proposed models than the results 
obtained for the porous media fabricated from sieved powder. This 
behavior can be explained due to following reasons. In the measurement 
using the thermal conductivity analyzer C-thermal Tci, one face of the 
sample in contact with the sensor was sanded. The original surface is 
modified closing the porous with the extract material. The measured 
method using by thermal conductivity analyzer C-thermal Tci is a flesh 
method. The response of the sample for a pulse of energy is modeled as 
a conductive heat problem in transient state. Then, the properties are 
determined as the parameter solution of the inversed problem. Hence the 
effective thermal conductivity measured can be modified due to 
reduction of the porosity of the surface of the sample analyzed. 

In the other hand, the measurement method used in the experimental 
work by Flórez et al. (2013) was the comparative method where the 
samples are not modified by application the pressure or sanding.  

Theoretical non-dimensional effective thermal conductivity and 
porosity against non-dimensional neck radius x/d are presented in the 
Figure 19. It can be observed that the porosity decreases as the x/d 
diameter increases, this effect is more pronounced for large values of 
x/d, while, for x/d ranging from 0.07 to 0.2, the porosity value is almost 
constant. On the other hand, the effective thermal conductivity shows a 
close to linear behavior with the particle diameter increase. Actually, the 
neck radio growth improves the heat transfer because there is more 
available area to transfer the heat. These results were calculated using 
the effective thermal conductivity for the theoretical model based on 
cubic and orthorhombic packing arrangements, for sintering temperature 
of 850 ºC. 

Figure 20 presents a comparison between experimental data and the 
effective thermal conductivity calculated from the model proposed in 
this work, considering the porosity resulting from cubic packing. This 



78 
 

figure also shows a comparison with literature models. It is important to 
highlight that the input parameter for the effective thermal conductivity 
of sintered porous media in literature models (ALEXANDER, 1972; 
ATABAKI; BALIGA, 2007) is the porosity, which has to be measured 
after the media is fabricated, since no literature model predicts the 
porosity as a function of the fabrication parameters. Instead, in the 
present model, the input parameter is the mean powder radius, data 
usually provided by the powder supplier. 

 
Figure 19 - Non-dimensional effective thermal conductivity and porosity 

against neck radius. 
It is interesting to note that, in the present model, porosity zero 

means that only the presence of the solid is observed, while porosity one 
means that only fluid phase is considered. So, there no sense in working 
with these two limits. In the present model, the porosity has a higher, 
bound limited by the selection of the packing arrangement. Therefore, 
the plots are limited to porosities ranging from 0.2 (achievable for 
powder with a large dimension spectrum and/or sintered at higher 
temperature levels) to around 0.6, the highest theoretical porosity for 
regularly arranged spheres, with no necks. This is supported by the 
observation of the experimental data presented in Figure 12, where the 
porosity achieves a maximum value, which is kept constant, regardless 
of the increase in the diameter of the particle.  



79 
 

 
 

 
Figure 20 - Effective thermal conductivity versus porosity for experimental data 

and values calculated from literature models for porous media saturated with 
water. 

 
The difference between the present effective thermal conductivity 

models ad data ranges from 14.7 % to 23.3 %. The Alexander (1972) 
model presents the best comparison with experimental data, which 
ranges between -4 % and -6.8 %. The model of Atabaki and Baliga 
(2007) also shows a good comparison with the data, varying from 23.6 
and 40 %. Actually, the present model compares very well with Atabaki 
and Baliga (2007)  model for low porosity porous media but the 
comparison deteriorates as the porosity tends to the physical model limit 
(porosity around 47 %), due to the reasons described in the last a 
paragraph.  

Again one should remember that, in Figure 20, to determine the 
present model effective thermal conductivity as a function of porosity, 
two models were used: one to obtain the x–axis data (porosity) and other 
for the y-axis parameter, or the effective thermal conductivity, both 
using the mean particle radius as input parameter. On the other hand, for 
the literature model, the input parameter is obtained by the direct 
measurement of the porosity. Therefore, the good comparison between 
data and present model and among the present and literature models, 



80 
 

show that the models presented can be applied for the prediction of the 
porosity and of the effective thermal conductivity of sintered porous 
media. 

 
3.4  Permeability 

 
One of the most important properties for porous media is the 

permeability. The knowledge of permeability enables the prediction of the 
flow rate for a pre-determined pressure drop or, on the other side, the 
prediction of the fluid pressure necessary to achieve a specific flow rate.  

Actually, permeability is associated with the porosity of the porous 
structure and with the powder particle diameter. This relation is known as 
Blake – Kozeny’s Equation (KAVIANY, 1995). Other permeability 
models such as Carman Kozeny and Rumpfe-Gupte are also used in heat 
pipes predictions. These models determine the permeability from porosity 
and particle diameter parameters (FAGHRI, 1995). Several works in 
literature are focused in the improvement of this model.  

Byon and Kim (2013) investigated experimentally and analytically the 
effects of the particle size distribution and of the packing structure. In this 
study, they considered two distinct types of porous media: mono-dispersed 
and bi-dispersed. The effect of the particle structure was represented by 
two geometry parameters: the particle arrangement and the particle bonded 
area, which depends on the sintering condition. The effect of the particle 
arrangement was studied for three unit-cell configurations: face centered 
cubic (FCC), body centered cubic (BCC) and simple cubic (SC). The 
effect of the bonded area (between sphere particles) and of the particle 
radius were also considered. They modified Blake Kozeny’s equation 
using two correction factors for the particle size: (the mean particle 
diameter and the mean cluster size) and obtained a correlation for 
permeability of bi-dispersed medium.   

Another commonly used relation is Darcy’s Law that relates the 
pressure drop to the flow velocity. Endo et al. (2009) used the analogy 
between electrical circuit and Darcy’s Law to obtain the permeability 
parameter. This author considered several particle diameters and the 
resulting packing bed was divided into small cubic regions, defined as unit 
cells. The unit cells have different electrical resistances, which were 
connected in a combination of series and parallel paths. Ohm and 
Kirchoff’s law were used in the solution of the equivalent thermal circuits, 
resulting in the hydraulic resistance model. Then, numerical method was 
employed in order to obtain the permeability of the bed packing. 
Experiments were done using several porosity glass beds, polypropylene 



81 
 

 
 

particles and silica particles, of different sizes and shapes. Their 
experimental data were in good agreement with the results of theoretical 
calculations.  

Yang et al. (2014) simplified an expression that determines the 
permeability for isotropic porous media as a function of the tortuosity, 
porosity and pore size, obtaining an equation that depends only of porosity 
and pore size. Therefore, this analytical study discusses the effect of these 
two morphological parameters on the permeability. Permeability of inverse 
wick (media in which porosity is larger than that found in conventional 
sintered particle wick, due to the sacrificial template used during the 
sintering particles process) was investigated numerically by Ngo and Byon 
(2016). As Blake – Kozeny’s and Kozeny – Carman’s equations cannot be 
applied for materials with very high porosity, these authors performed a 
non-linear regression analysis in order to embrace all configurations of 
wicks (KAVIANY, 1995). As a result, correlations based on numerical 
simulation were obtained for different packing structures. Two modified 
Kozeny–Carman equations were proposed: one for conventional wicks and 
another for inverse wicks. 

From this literature review, one can see that several parameters are 
necessary to predict the permeability of sintered porous media. In this 
section, an analytical model for prediction of the permeability of sintered 
porous media, made from particles of approximately the same dimensions, 
is presented. In this approach, the fluid flow through the gaps within 
spheres in contact of a simplified arrangement geometry is modeled. 
Sintered porous media is modeled as an arrangement of spherical particles, 
with several packing configurations. 

 
3.4.1 Mathematical model 

 
The powder particles from which the porous media is made are 

modeled as spheres of uniform radius r. Several packing configurations 
can be observed, when the same diameter spheres are in contact. In Figure 
21a, two packing configurations according to German (1989) are 
presented: simple cubic and orthorhombic. These arrangements are 
employed to determine the theoretical permeability of a sintered porous 
media.  

Any arrangement of same diameter spheres shapes channels with 
non-circular cross sections within where fluids subjected to pressure 
differences flow, following a pattern of consecutive constrictions and 
expansions. Figure 21b shows the schematic of cross the sections of the 



82 
 

ducts formed by spheres in simple and orthorhombic cubic packing 
arrangement. 

a)  

b)  

Figure 21 - Channels physical model a) Cubic b) Orthorhombic. 
 
In this work, the permeability was modelled using the Darcy’s law. Henry 
Darcy made an experiment based on the flow of water though a pipe packed 
with sand. He noticed that the velocity u is uniform and proportional to the 
negative of pressure gradient (AKBARI; SISTON; BAHRAMI, 2010). This 
relation, known as Darcy’s law is enunciated as: 

 ? 4$4? ? vw xy  (3.28) 
where ? is the permeability of the media (m2), µ is the dynamic viscosity 
of fluid and dP/dx is the pressure gradient in the direction of x-axis. In 
the present case, the fluid mass flow m&amp;amp;  within the bulk space among the 
spheres can be expressed as:  
 

 z? ? ?\? xy (3.29) 
 
where An is the transversal area at inlet of channel for each packing system 
considered and uD is Dacy’s velocity. Substituting Equation (3.28) in 



83 
 

 
 

(3.29) and integrating in the x direction along the L length, the mass ratio 
becomes: 
 

 z? ? ?\? wv ?$]  (3.30) 
 
From the analogy of Darcy’s law with Fourier’s law, the hydraulic 

resistance of the mass flux through a cross section can be defined as: 
 

 SZy ? v]?\? w (3.31) 
 
Another expression for the hydraulic resistance through ducts can be 

obtained from the solution of the internal flow, according to the particle 
arrangement. Akbari et al. (2010) obtained an expression for the 
hydraulic resistance, based on converging-diverging laminar fully 
developed flows. From the solution of conservation of mass and 
momentum equations, the unit cell pressure drop in z-axis direction can 
be obtained, with the adoption of the following hypothesis:   

• Steady state conditions. 
• Two dimensional (r,z) cylindrical coordinated problem.  
• Laminar regime. 
• Fully developed velocity profile. 
• Isotropic wick structure. 
• Particle material is represented by spheres of an average 

radius.  
• The working fluid is incompressible. 
• Constant properties. 
• Non-slip condition of the fluid on the walls. 
• Gravity effect is negligible. 

 
Therefore, the conservation of mass equation takes the following form, 
where u and v are the axial and radial velocities, respectively:  
 

 1&gt; ||&gt; ?&gt;}? ? |x|I ? 0 (3.32) 
 
The Navier-Stokes equation in r and z are: 



84 
 

 

 ? =} |x|&gt; ? x |x|I ? ? ? |$|I ? v ~1&gt; ||&gt;&amp;lt;&gt; |x|&gt; @ ? |C x|IC ? (3.33) 
 ? =} |x|&gt; ? x |x|I ? ? ? |$|&gt; ? v ~ ||&gt; ?1&gt; |?&gt;}?|&gt; ? ? |Cx|IC ? (3.34) 

 
These partial differential equations are subject to the boundary conditions: 
 

 x?S, I? ? 0, }?&gt;, I? ? 0, S ? ??I?, $?&gt;, 0? ? $? (3.35) 
 
where a(z) is the radio of the equivalent cross section liquid flow area, 
which depends on the geometry of the sphere arrangement, to be discussed 
in the next section. The axial and radial velocities profiles, proposed by 
Akbari et al. (2010) are respectively:  
 

 x?&gt;, I? ? 2x!,? &amp;lt;????I?@C ?1 ? = &gt;??I??C? (3.36) 
 

Integrating the Equation (3.33) for P in z and calculating the average 
pressure in z = 0 (a0) and z = r (a1), Akbari [9] obtained an expression 
for the pressure drop in z-axis direction: 

 ?$ ? 16vx!,?]??C ??
6 ? ? ? 13?C ? z? ?1 ? ??2?? ? (3.37) 

where m?=r'?z?, ?= a1/a0 is ratio between the minimum and the 
maximum radius. Again, from analogy between the hydraulic flow and 
electrical circuit, the following hydraulic resistance can be defined:  
 

 SZ?/+L ? ?$z?  (3.38) 
 
which is equivalent to a flow in a single converging-diverging tube. 
These fluid flow phenomena was considered as equivalent to the 
constriction-expansion observed in real channels, formed within spheres 
of a unit cell. The mass ratio m&amp;amp;  that flows across of the unit cell is 
defined as: 



85 
 

 
 

 z? ? ?v!,?Gx??C (3.39) 
 
where um,0 is mean velocity evaluated in z = 0. Substituting the 
Equations (3.30) and (3.38) in (3.39) yields: 
 

 SZ?/+L ? 16v?P?G??? ??
C ? ? ? 13?C ? z? ?1 ? ??2?? ? (3.40) 

 
Matching Equations (3.31) and (3.41), the permeability k can be isolated, 
resulting in the expression: 
 

 2 ? G]???16\? ?P ??
C ? ? ? 13?C ? z? ?1 ? ??2?? ? (3.41) 

 
Actually, the application of this model requires transformation of 

non-circular ducts into circular tubes using characteristic lengths. In the 
following section, several procedures are proposed to convert non-
circular sections into equivalent circular channels. 

 
3.4.2 Characteristic dimensions 

 
In the present work, non-circular ducts are modelled as circular, 

using several specific characteristic dimensions, such as the hydraulic 
ratio and the characteristic length ?\, as proposed by Bahrami et al. 
(2006). These dimensions vary along the liquid flow channel. The 
summary of the equivalent hydraulic diameter expressions (d) is 
presented in the Table 5.

• Cubic Packing 

From simple geometry analysis, several expressions can be obtained 
to calculate the fluid flow cross section area as function of the z 
direction. In Figure 22, a cross section area of a simple cubic packing in 
a specific z-axis point is shown.

The transversal irregular cross section geometry is considered as a 

circular duct using the well-known hydraulic diameter concept. In Table 
6, two expressions for the equivalent radius for the cubic packing 
arrangement are presented, where m(z) is a geometric parameter, defined 
as:

3.4.3 Experimental procedure 
 

The permeability of the porous media was indirectly measured 
through the following expression, based on Darcy’s law:

where A is the cross-section flow area, ? and ?P represents the density 
and pressure drop, respectively, and L is length in the direction of the 
flow within the porous material. In this work, to measure the 
permeability, an equipment was designed and built according to Darcy’s 
experiment. Figure 25 shows a sketch and a photography of the 
apparatus.

The measurement setup is composed of three main sections. The first 
one consists of a distilled water tank and an air pressure transducer, 
responsible for keeping the water flow in constant fluxes. The second 
section consists of a working fluid valve, which allows the controlling 
of the water mass fluxes during the permeability measurement, and a 
digital manometer Zürich-Z10B that measures the water pressure before 
entering the sample. In the third section, the sample is positioned 
between the two rubber gaskets by a holder and pressed against a 
stainless steel case. Between the second and the third sections, there is a 
tube, which length is more than 7.5 times higher than the diameter of 
duct, to guarantee the developed flow at inlet region of the sample 
(FOX; MCDONALD, 2001). The mass flow rate is calculated from the 
measurement of the water mass accumulated in a Becker recipient for a 
time period of 30 seconds, registered by a digital chronometer. The 
permeability of copper powder sintered cylindrical samples was 
measured. The properties of the distilled water, evaluated at 25 °C, were 
obtained from literature thermodynamic tables (CENGEL; BOLES, 
2006). Particles of different sizes obtained from successive mechanical 
vibration siftings of atomized copper powder were employed in 
fabrication of samples and the permeability were measured. 
 
3.4.4 Data analysis and results 
 

In this section, the analysis of the permeability measured according 
to procedure explained previous section is presents. The experimental 
porosity used to compare the permeability calculated from the literature 
model is presented in the Table 8.

• Present model comparison with data 

Figure 26 shows a comparison between the experimental data and the 
permeability calculated from the model proposed, for each sintered porous 
media experimentally studied. The x-axis represents the average particle 
diameter of the metal powder used to fabricate the sintered porous media 
tested and the y-axis represents the permeability. One can conclude, 
observing Figure 26, that the results of the permeability model, based on 
the cubic packing arrangement, where the hydraulic diameter is taken as 
the square root of the cross area, shows the best comparison with 
experimental data. However, the difference between this model and 
experimental data vary from 19 % to 143 %. This large difference can be 
explained by simplifications such as the hypothesis of perfect particle 
spherical shape and of their ordered arrangement. In this work, the 
fabrication method used to produce the powder was atomization of copper 
in liquid flow, which does not produce particles completely spherical 
(LAWLEY, 1992). 

 
Figure 26 - Permeability results compared with the proposed models. 

 
The permeability calculated using the proposed model has the same 

order of magnitude of the experimental data, which is a very good result, 
considering the magnitude of the permeability and the inherent difficulty in 
measuring and modelling such small physical parameters. In Figure 26, 
one can also observe the similar behavior trends followed by the 



92 
 

theoretical results and the experimental data. It suggests that the model 
based on a converging-diverging tube is a good approximation for the 
liquid flow into a porous media, in low Reynolds number regimen.  

The other models proposed based in cubic (hydraulic diameter 
calculated form 4A/P) and orthorhombic (hydraulic diameter calculated 
form 4A/P and the square of across area) packings present higher 
differences when compared with experimental measurement, that can be 
up to 400 % larger than the data.   

• Comparison with literature models 

Figure 27 shows a comparison between the experimental data and the 
permeability calculated from the proposed and literature models. Note that 
the permeability calculated from literature models require the porosity and 
the average particle diameter as input parameters, while, in the present 
model, only the particle dimension is the input data. In Figure 27, one can 
see that both literature and proposed models show similar behaviors. 
However, the smaller difference of the permeability estimated by models 
was 53 % and the largest was 400 % (Carman-Kozeny), when compared to 
experimental data.  

 

Figure 27 - Permeability results comparing the proposed and literature models, 
based on porosity and average particle diameter. 

 
Actually, in literature of LHPs, these models (Karman-Kozeny, Blake-

kozeny and Rumpte-Gupte) are used to calculate the permeability of 



93 
 

 
 

sintered porous (FAGHRI, 1995; KAVIANY, 1995). A good evaluation of 
the impact that the uncertainty in the determination of the permeability can 
have over the prediction of LHP behavior can be observed from the 
calculation of the pressure drop for water flow within sintered porous 
media with fixed geometry, which can be obtained from the equation:  

 ?$ ? ]w\ vz???  (3.50) 
This expression was applied for the presently tested device. In equation 

22, ? is the dynamic viscosity, ? is the density of water, L is the porous 
media thickness (8 mm), A is the cross section area (cylindrical sample of 
8 mm of diameter) and z?  is the mass flux of 1.91x10-3 kg/s. The pressure 
drop calculated using several permeability models, including the one 
proposed in the present work, is present in Figure 28, where one can see 
that the simple cubic packing model, based on the square root of the area, 
presents the best comparison with pressure drop data. The smallest 
difference observed is 16 % while the largest is 59 %. One can also note 
that, for all models, the difference between data and data increases for 
intermediate average particle diameter of the particles. Actually, this 
behavior follows the same trends observed in Figure 26 for the same range 
of particle diameter, where the permeability comparison between data and 
models also decreased.  

 
Figure 28 - Pressure drop results compared to the proposed and literature 

models. 



94 
 

Actually, one can consider as a reasonable prediction of the permeability 
if the model is able to calculate the permeability within the actual order of 
magnitude. Although, in Figure 26, the difference between the 
permeability predicted by the literature models and experimental data was 
of more than one order of magnitude, the largest pressure drop difference 
between prediction and data lies between 70 and 100 %.  

 
3.5  Effective porous radius 

 
Pores can be classified according to size: very large are called 

caverns and very small are called micropores or ultramicropores 
(KAVIANY, 1995). Pores of different size can be found inside the 
porous medium due to the process of manufacturing. Pore size is 
connected with other properties as permeability, porosity, effective 
thermal conductivity. The pumping capability of a wick in a loop heat 
pipe is expressed as function of the pore radius. The Laplace-Young 
(GENNES; BROCHARD-WYART; QUÉRÉ, 2004) equation indicates 
the capillary pressure of the wicks generated by the liquid-vapor 
interface and is known as: 
 ?$
?? ? 2?&gt;?  (3.51) 
where ? is the working fluid surface tension, rp is the pore radius and ? 
is contact angle formed between solid and liquid. In order to 
characterize the wicks more simply, the equation is replaced by: 
 

 ?$
?? ? 2?&gt;[55 (3.52) 
 
where reff  is the effective pore radius. 

In the literature, the effective pore radio is measured experimentally 
using the Equation (3.52). Singh et al. (2009) determined 
experimentally wick properties as permeability, pores radius, porosity 
and effective thermal conductivity. In order to measure pores radius, a 
transparent PVC tube was bent in the form of a U. Due to equality 
between air pressure and surface tension force of the water, bubbles 
emerge and allow to measure pore radius.  



95 
 

 
 

Giraudon et al. (2016) also used hydrostatic pressure to measure 
pore radius. Furthermore, they developed a model for the most 
appropriate porous structure characteristics taking into account some 
parameters as thickness, porosity, permeability, pore radius and thermal 
conductivity. The model predicts the final wick characteristics as a 
function of the manufacturing parameters. 

Tang et al. (2013) examined the permeability and capillary 
pressure in normal sintered and grooved wicks. They also studied the 
effects of powder size, wick type and gravity in these tests. For capillary 
rate-of-rise tests, an infrared thermal was employed which enables to 
observe the moving front of liquid. 

Holley and Faghri (2006) measured permeability and effective 
pore radius using the rate-of-rise test of sintered metal powder and 
carbon paper samples. For the rise of liquid in a wick, capillary pressure 
is assumed to be in balance with hydrostatic pressure and pressure loss 
associated with friction, taken from Darcy’s Law.  

Li et al. (2010) developed a method to investigate the capillary 
pumping amount changing curve recorded by experiment. For this, tree 
parameters were considered: capillary pumping amount (the maximum 
of working fluid that can be pumped into the porous wick), capillary 
pumping time (the time that the porous wick needs to reach saturation 
from the beginning of the capillary pumping) and capillary pumping rate 
(the velocity that the porous wick reaches saturation). They discovered 
that capillary pumping amount changing curve could be described with 
an exponential increase equation. The effect of porosity on capillary 
pumping was also studied. They conclude that capillary pumping rate 
increases with the increasing of the porosity. 

Another quantity commonly measured is representative pore 
radius that represents the pore radii at which 50 % of the non-wetting 
liquid intrusion volume occurs. Li et al. (2010) found differences 
between representative pore radii and effective pore radii. This 
difference is attributed to the variation in contact angle made by the 
wetting liquid on the solid surface in experiments, possibly induced by 
contaminations. Palakurthi et al. (2015) studied the relationship between 
effective and representative pore radii using numerical experiments that 
allow to eliminate the effect of contact angle variations by keeping the 
contact angle constant. They conclude that the disparity between 
effective and representative pore radii do not arise from the contact 
angle variations.  

 



96 
 

3.5.1 Mathematical model 
 

To model of effective porous radius is used the concept of hydraulic 
diameter proposed to calculate the permeability in the section 3.4. From 
geometrical transformation, similar expressions defined to a(z) are 
evaluated in z = 0 and z = rp. Therefore, the effective pore radius is 
defined as: 

 &gt;[55 ? ??I? (3.53) 
where a(z) is the hydraulic diameter evaluated for each packing 
arrangement (cubic and orthorhombic). 

 
3.5.2 Experimental procedure 

 
The effective pore radius tests are based in the measured of the 

pressure capillary required to equilibrate a meniscus of some specified 
size and shape. The bubble point test proposed by Dunn and Reay 
(1978) , where pressurized gas is applied to one side of a wick saturated 
with liquid. Thus, the gas pressure is gradually increased and the 
capillary pressure is measured at the point when bubbles form on the 
opposite side of the wick sample. Another test used by Faghri (1995) is 
the risen meniscus, where the liquid level rises in a wick sample until 
the capillary and hydrostatic pressures are equilibrated. 

To determine of effective porous radius was fabricated an 
experimental set up bases in the bubbles method according to Paiva 
(2011). The apparatus is composed for an argon gas cylinder where a 
pressure valve is coupled. Other, second valve controls the mass rate. 
Following, a pressure sensor (Omega PX409-015DWUV) is used to 
measure the pressure gas in the internal side of the sample. Finally, an 
acquisition system data (National Instruments NISCXI-1000) is used to 
register the gradually increased of pressure. The design and 
photographic of experimental apparatus is present are presented in the 
Figure 29.  

Copper sintered samples with cylindrical shape was fabricated and 
coated laterally with an epoxy resin. After, which the resin dried, the 
sample is attached into a silicone hose. The opposite side of the sample 
is filled with distillated water. The argon gas released across of sample 
until the gas pressure exceeds the hydrodynamic pressure and bobbles 
start appear. The measure process is repeated by 5 times.

3.5.3 Analysis and results 
 

Figure 30 shows a comparison between the experimental data and 
the effective porous radius, calculated from the proposed models. One 
can see that both Bahrami and Fox cubic packing hydraulic diameter 
curves (superposed) have reasonable comparisons with the experimental 
data. Due to the adopted physical model, the two hydraulic equivalent 
diameters are equal for z=0. Using 0.21dp as the effective porous radio, 
as suggested in the literature (SINGH; AKBARZADEH; MOCHIZUKI, 
2009), actually overestimate the pump capacity, as one can see by the 
light green curve in Figure 30.  

 
Figure 30 - Effective porous radio results compared to proposed, based on 

hydraulic diameter and average particle diameter. 
 
3.6  Conclusions 

 
In this chapter, several models based on the mean particle diameter 

as parameter input were proposed to estimate the porosity, effective 
thermal conductivity, permeability and effective porous radio of sintered 
porous media. The sintering process was descripted and mechanisms 
and models of literature were presented. Experimental apparatus were 
developed to measure the thermophysical properties and data were 
compared to theoretical values obtaining good comparison. These 



99 
 

 
 

models allowed to obtain the theoretical limit where the thermophysical 
properties analyzed are adequate and it becomes in a design tool. 

In Figure 31, a summary of the thermophysical properties as 
functions of the average particle diameter and the experimental data are 
presented. The theoretical curve and experimental data for the effective 
thermal conductivity and permeability show opposite behavior, while 
the effective thermal conductivity decreases as the average particle 
diameter increases, the permeability and the effective porous radio 
increase as average particle diameter increases. The effective thermal 
conductivity and the permeability curve have a cross point that can be 
considered a limit between desirable and undesirable design values for 
this property. In the active zone of the evaporator is necessary that the 
wick structure have a high permeability to flow the working fluid with 
the lowest pressure drop. The effective thermal conductivity linked to 
geometry should allow that the highest heat power achieves the 
evaporation surface and avoid the heat transferred to the compensation 
chamber. Then, according with the Figure 31, the material properties 
chosen must be one with average particle diameter higher than 20 ?m. 
However, one can be seen that capillary pressure depends on the 
effective porous radio, hence, small porous provide high capillary 
pumping. To determine the viability of a geometry and material for a 
wick structure of a LHP evaporator, the thermal and hydraulic response 
should be analyzed simultaneously.

particle diameter and the experimental data.

In the chapter 5, two type materials with 36 and 51 ?m will be 
studied using a statistical analysis to determine the effect of the 
thermophysical properties and the geometrical of wick on the thermal 
and hydraulic responses for a power and operating temperature 
prescribed.

4 EVAPORATOR MODEL FOR LOOP HEAT PIPES 

In this chapter, models for designing the geometry of cylindrical 
LHP evaporators and for predicting their thermal behavior are 
developed. In the first section, an expression based on scale analyses is 
proposed to determine a critical design factor, which relates the 
thermophysical properties of wick structure, the fluid properties and 
thermodynamic operation conditions with the geometrical parameters. 
Analytical models based on the solution of the mass, momentum and 
energy conservation equations in cylindrical coordinates were developed 
to analyze and avoid the dry-out of the liquid in evaporator wick 
structure. The temperature and pressure fields and the heat and mass 
flux were also obtained. Thermal and electrical analogy circuit model 
was used to estimate the operation temperature of the LHP. In this work, 
several literature models were used to calculate the thermal performance 
and pressure drop along the LHP, for comparison purposes. 

 
4.1 Heat Transfer analysis 

 
 Several LHP heat transfer models are found in the literature. Launay 
et al. (2008) proposed an analytical mathematical model based on an 
equivalent thermal circuit. Singh et al. (2009) presented a theoretical 
model based on a heat balance (first law of thermodynamics) performed 
for a LHP with a cylindrical evaporator, similar to the one studied by Ku 
(1999), a cylindrical evaporator LHP with a primary and a secondary 
porous media layers. Kaya et al. (1999) proposed models for the thermal 
behavior of LHPs based on known geometric and thermophysical 
properties of materials and working fluids. Other models proposed are 
based on solutions of the continuity and energy equations, for simplified 
sections of the porous media within the evaporator.  
 Cao and Faghri (1994) presented analytical solutions for the liquid 
pressure and velocity fields and for the temperature distributions. Their 
physical model consisted of a porous media section, heated by solid fins. 
Darcy´s equations were employed to solve the velocity fields. Their 
analytical temperature results compared well with numerical data. 
However, the temperature field obtained did not allow for the 
determination of the heat transferred to the compensation chamber (heat 
leakage), which disturbs the thermal performance of the device. A 
numerical solution for the temperature distribution of a section of the 



102 
 

porous media, heated by a fin, was also presented by Demidov and 
Yatsenko (1994). They observed that the vapor front in the evaporator 
starts in the contacting surface between the heater wall and the wick 
structure: high heat fluxes may cause the onset of vapor bubbles that 
may grow and coalesce, eventually covering the entire contacting 
surface.  
 Siedel et al. (2005) developed an analytical model to determine the 
thermo-hydraulic behavior of LHPs. They combined energy balance 
equation with two-dimensional (2D) temperature field equations for a 
cylindrical evaporator, including the wick structure and casing. The 
values of the temperature-sensitive thermophysical parameters were 
taken for temperatures observed experimentally. This model presented 
good agreement with numerical simulation results and with 
experimental data. 
 Santos (2010) solved numerically thermal and hydraulic models for 
ceramic wick of evaporators of LHPs and CPLs. He studied 
theoretically a porous media composed by two layers of media with 
different thermal conductivities. Experimental tests were performed for 
two working fluids: water and acetone. Li and Peterson (2011) 
developed a three-dimensional (3D) model to analyze the heat and mass 
transfer of a flat evaporator of a LHP. Simulation results show good 
agreement with the operational temperature experimental data. Sintered 
copper powder was the wick structure used in the studied evaporator.   
 Chernysheva and Maydanik (2012) presented a 3D mathematical 
model for a flat sintered copper porous media evaporator, filled with 
water. The geometries of vapor exit channel, compensation chamber and 
porous structure were considered in their model. Actually, due to the 
evaporator mounting design, only a small fraction of the area, available 
for the heat exchange between evaporator and heat source, was used and 
so, the surface contact temperature did not follow the trends observed in 
the rest of the compensation chamber. Therefore, the formation of vapor 
was not uniform and it concentrated mainly on the central contact area 
between the evaporator and the heat source, showing low evaporation in 
the peripheral regions.  
 The performed literature review shows that the several works 
concerning analytical and numerical predictions of the thermal 
performance of LHPs do not deal with the evaporator geometry studied 
in the present work. In addition, no available model provides a criterion 
to be used for the design of the porous media thickness. In this work, 
theoretical and experimental analyses of the temperature and pressure 
distribution within working fluid filled porous media are presented. It is 



103 
 

 
 

shown that the resulting model can be used as a tool for designing LHP 
evaporators. The general model for determination of the operation 
temperature is presented. In the next chapter, two evaporators were 
designed and fabricated using the tools developed in this work. The 
experimental data obtained were analyzed and used as “study cases”. 
 
4.1.1 Physical model 
 

The model proposed in this work is based on a copper LHP, with 
cylindrical shaped evaporator, as shown in Figure 32. The evaporator 
has two regions: the compensation chamber, with no porous media, and 
the capillary pump region, of length l, internally recovered by a copper 
powder sintered wick layer, of thickness ?. A porous media plug of 
length ? separates these regions (see Figure 32). The higher the pressure 
difference between the compensation chamber and the liquid-vapor 
meniscus interface, the better the system works. Therefore, the objective 
of the plug is, while allowing the liquid to reach the wick structure in the 
heated region of the evaporator, to decrease the heat leakage to the 
compensation chamber, avoiding its temperature increases, which would 
decrease the pressure difference and so disturb the LHP thermal 
performance, eventually stopping the system operation. In other words, 
the heat loss to the compensation chamber increases the working fluid 
temperature, decreasing the difference between the temperatures of the 
compensation chamber and of the evaporator meniscus. As a result, the 
working fluid pressure difference between these same regions of the 
LHP decreases (see Maydanik et al. (2011b)). The configuration studied 
in this work, is similar to the novel oval evaporator proposed by 
Maydanik et al. (2011b), which has been successfully tested and 
considered as an alternative to the conventional evaporators, because 
they allow for the use of copper and water. Actually, cooper is a 
material usually avoided due to its high thermal conductivity that causes 
large heat losses to the compensation chamber. Besides, water is also 
avoided because, despite of having good thermal properties such as high 
latent heat of vaporization and surface tension, it presents low pressure 
sensibility to temperature variations, for low operation temperatures 
(below 70 oC). A simplified sketch of the evaporator is shown in Figure 
33. This evaporator works similarly as the conventional ones: the 
condensate enters the evaporator through the liquid line and reaches the 
compensation chamber, crosses the porous media plug, reaching the 
capillary pumped region which external wall receives the heat power 



104 
 

input. In this work, the influence of the porous media layer ? and of the 
geometric parameters ? and l, in the thermal performance of capillary 
pumps in LHPs, are studied.  

 
Figure 32 - Sketch of the LHP studied. 

 
As already noted, heat power is delivered to the external area of the 

evaporator capillary pumping region, crossing the wall and reaching the 
wick structure. The wick must be designed so that the phase change 
occurs only in the liquid vapor meniscus (FAGHRI, 1995). In order to 
work properly, vapor must not be trapped within the porous media. As 
the vapor thermal conductivity is much lower than liquid´s, the thermal 
resistance of the evaporator can increase sensibly with the presence of 
vapor. In addition, vapor can cause working fluid pressure to increase 
and oscillate within the wick, disturbing the LHP behavior. Therefore, 
the wick design should provide proper permeability and porosity, to 
allow the liquid to flow through the media and adequate thermal 
conductivity, to avoid the vapor to be formed within the layer, out of the 
meniscus.  

Therefore, the most probable location of the onset of undesirable 
vapor bubbles is in the interface between the porous media and the 
casing wall, in the evaporator external wall heated region. So, if one is 
able to avoid the vapor formation in this interface, no vapor bubbles are 
expected in any other evaporator region. In other words, the design of 
the device should guarantee, for the specific power input under 
consideration, that the temperature of the wick-casing wall interface is 
kept lower than the phase change temperature for liquid saturation 
pressure inside the wick.

4.1.2 Evaporator geometry analyses 
 

In actual applications, LHPs must be designed to satisfy several 
operation requirements, including working temperatures, capacity of 
transferring heat for pre-established distances (between evaporators and 
condensers) and geometric limitations, due to the volume or area 
available for setting up the device. 
 The main criterion adopted to design the geometry (length and 
diameter) of the present studied LHP cylindrical evaporator is to 
provide, to the heat source, enough external area to capture the heat to 
be transferred. In addition, although pressure drops along the evaporator 
is not a subject treated in this work, the length of the evaporator must 
satisfy the capillary pumping requirements of the LHP. Actually, one 
should note that this wick must be thin enough to avoid the phase 
change to happen inside the structure and large enough to provide 
working fluid flow and capillary pumping capacity. However, it is not 
found in the literature any mathematical expression to be used in order 
to select the appropriate wick thickness ?. The present work develops an 
expression, based on geometric and thermophysical properties of the 
working fluid and porous media, which can be used as a criterion for the 
selection of the appropriate thickness of the porous media (wick) 
structure.  
 From the conservation of mass principle applied to the wick 
structure, the following relation can be obtained:  

 z? ? ? z? 
  (4.1) 
where z? ?  and z? 
  represents the wick structure inlet and outlet working 
fluid mass flow rates, respectively. Two different velocity components 
are relevant in this model. The u axial velocity is related to the liquid 
flowing within the porous media and can be obtained from Darcy´s 
equation. The normal v velocity is related to the mass of liquid 
evaporated in the vapor-liquid interface and dependents on the heat flux 
that reaches that interface. Using these velocities, Equation (4.1) can be 
rewritten as: 
  

 ?? x\?L ? ?? }\??  (4.2) 
 
where \?L  and \??  are the fluid flow normal areas, in the z and r 
directions and ?l is the liquid.

From Darcy´s law, one gets: 
 

 
|$|I ? ? v?w x (4.3) 

 
where µ l is the fluid viscosity and ? is the permeability of the media.  

From this equation, one can solve for the velocity to get: 
 

 x ? ? wv? |$|I  (4.4) 
 
It can be noted that this relation take into account the pressure drop 
within the wick structure.  

The velocity v can be obtained from a mass balance on the meniscus 
liquid-vapor interface, assuming that all the heat supplied in the 
evaporator is used for the liquid-vapor phase change, in the meniscus 
interface. So, one gets: 

   

 z? ? ???? (4.5) 
 
where hlv is the latent heat of vaporization and q is the heat applied. 
Substituting the right side of Equation (4.2) in the above expression, one 
gets: 

 ?? }\?? ? ????  (4.6) 
From the one-dimensional conduction heat transfer Fourier law, and 

considering keff as the effective thermal conductivity of the porous 
media, one gets:

Substituting Equation (4.7) in Equation (4.6) yields:

Substituting Equations (4.4) and (4.8) in Equation (4.2), one gets:

The following parameters are expected to have the order of

Substituting in Equation (4.9), and rearranging, one gets the

 (4.11) 

Actually, the compensation chamber and the evaporator present 
slightly different saturated states, due to the temperature differences 
observed along the LHP. These saturation states are thermodynamically 
linked and must satisfy the relation (FAGHRI, 1995; KU, 1999; 
MAYDANIK et al., 2011): 

 ?$ ? 4$4)?' ?) (4.12) 
which, also, can be written as: 

 
$? ? $

 ? 4$4)?' (4.13) 

where Pv and Tv are the pressure and temperature of the evaporator, 
while Pcc and Tcc are pressure and temperature of the compensation 
chamber, respectively. The term dP/dT is the slope of the pressure-
temperature saturation line at T and this rate depends on the working 
fluid. High dP/dT values result in larger pressure gradients within the 
evaporator and so in larger evaporator capillary pumping capacity, 
resulting in larger temperature difference between the compensation 
chamber and the rest of the LHP. Therefore, it is evident that dP/dT 
characteristics of the working fluid must be considered in the geometry 
design of LHPs. The reference temperature T, for which the derivative is 
taken, can be adopted as the compensation chamber temperature, as 
suggested by Ku (1999), or as the average between the evaporator and 
compensation chamber temperatures, as proposed by Faghri (1995). In 



109 
 

 
 

the present work, the evaporator temperature is adopted as the reference 
operation temperature. Then, from Equation (4.13), the term ?P/?T can

This equation provides a non-dimensional expression, involving 
geometry, capillary structure plus working fluid thermophysical 
properties and thermodynamic state of the working fluid, which can be 
used for the design of the wick structure thickness. The last term of 
Equation (4.15) can be calculated using the Clausius - Clapeyron 
Equation. In this work, the derivate of the pressure as function of the 
temperature is obtained from the FAGHRI (1995) polynomium.  
 One should note that the present model is useful not only to the LHP 
evaporator geometry under investigation in this work but also to 
conventional evaporators (FAGHRI, 1995; KU, 1999), see Figure 34, 
where Equation (4.15) can be used to determine the ratio between the 
evaporator wick thickness and its length l (?/l), which guarantees the 
LHP start up.

4.2 Loop heap pipe evaporator mathematical models 
 
As already mentioned, the porous media have two objectives: to 

provide a controlled means for working fluid evaporation and at the 
same time, to provide the capillary pumping necessary for conducting 
the fluid along the device. Therefore, the evaporator must be designed to 
guarantee that the heat delivered is able to reach the working fluid 
liquid–vapor meniscus formed, in the present configuration, in the most 
internal layer of the porous media. Also, the design should avoid vapor 
formation within the wick structure.  
 Therefore, thermal models for the temperature distribution within 
evaporator wick structure, able to predict the power transferred through 
the wick structure and the hot spots and hydraulic models, able to 
determine the pressure distribution (and so the pumping capacity of the 
evaporator) are important design tool of efficient LHP evaporators. 
 In the first part of this section, heat conduction models, to determine 
the temperature distribution and the heat transferred for the evaporator 
of LHPs are developed and presented. In the second part, hydraulic 
models able to predict the pressure distribution are developed and 
shown. These models are used in the design of evaporators of LHPs as 
discussed in the next chapter.  
 
4.2.1 Wick structure thermal models 
 

In the section, the wick, of thickness ? and length l which includes 
the heated and insulated lengths ? of the capillary pumping structure, 
and wick plug length ? are modeled (see Figure 33). Two-dimensional 
cylindrical coordinates were adopted, with the z axis located in the axis 
of cylindrical wick and the r axis located radial to the wick thickness 
direction, resulting in the physical model shown in Figure 35.  
 The following hypotheses were adopted:  

• Steady state conditions; 
• Isotropic wick structure; 
• Solid and liquid uniform thermophysical properties; 
• The evaporator ()?) and compensation chamber ()

) 

temperatures are prescribed, in saturation state, where )? &gt;)

.

Figure 35 - Sketch of the evaporator thermophysical model. 
 

The sketch of the heat transfer physical model, presented in Figure 
35, shows the following boundary conditions: 

• Prescribed temperature ()? ), at z=0. The working fluid 
within the compensation chamber, in its saturated state, 
contains both liquid and vapor phases. 

• Thermal insulation at (|) |&gt;? ? 0), at z=v. This boundary 
condition means that the heat transfer is negligible at end of 
the evaporator wall.  

• For &gt; ? ?, thermal insulation (|) |I? ? 0) for 0 ? I ? ?. 
This assumes that whole heat supplied in the heated surface 
is transferred or to the wick meniscus and or to the 
compensation chamber. The heat transfer in the wick plug 
and vapor regions interface is negligible. 

• Heat flux is known ( 2 |) |&gt; ? ^??? , for ? ? I ? ?). 
• Prescribed temperature ()?), at ? ?. This temperature 

corresponds to the saturated temperature of the vapor 
produced in the meniscus interface.  

• Liquid-vapor phase change happens only at the meniscus 
formed in the interface between liquid and vapor, in the 
wick structure (&gt; ? ?) (FAGHRI, 1995). 



112 
 

• Heat is supplied to the evaporator external wall and reaches 
the liquid-vapor interface, due to the high thermal 
conductivity of the porous media solid matrix (FAGHRI, 
1995). The physical mechanism is shown in Figure 36. 

 

 
Figure 36 - Sketch of the evaporator thermophysical model. 

 
• All the heat transferred by the wick structure to the liquid-

vapor interface is used for changing the phase of the 
working fluid. Also, the evaporation thermal resistance is 
much lower than the conduction thermal resistance of the 
sintered porous media, which effective thermal conductivity 
is keff. 
 

In this 2D model, the heat transfer through the evaporator case was 
neglected, in behalf of the design safety. A percentage of the heat flux is 
transferred through of case, but, by considering that the whole heat 
passes only through the wick structure, the maximum possible 
temperature is determined. As the actual temperature is lower than the 
calculated one, the liquid is colder that the saturation temperature, which 
is in favor of safety. Therefore, only the heat leak to the compensation 
chamber through the plug wick was considered. Adiabatic boundary 
condition at z = ? for 0 &amp;lt;r &amp;lt;? was assumed as the heat transfer in this 
face is small and so no evaporation is expected at this interface. This 
assumption considers that the whole working fluid flows through of 
surface at z = ? for ? &amp;lt;r &amp;lt;?, and so, the maximum pressure drop is 
obtained. 



113 
 

 
 

Due to the non-uniformity of the evaporator geometry (one solid and 
another hollow cylinders), the problem was split in two, (region 3 for 
the hollow, and 1 and 2 for the solid cylinders) as shown in Figure 37. 
The solid cylinder problem is also divided in two sub-domains, 1 and 2 
at r=?. The interface at z= ?and ? ? &gt; ? ? (subdomain 2 e 3, see 
Figure 37) couples the solid and hollow cylinders. The boundary 
conditions in this interface is the following: first a heat flux is assumed 
for the solid cylinder, then the model resulting temperature distribution 
T? (r), at z= ?, ? ? &gt; ? ?, is considered as the prescribed temperature 
distribution boundary condition for the hollow cylinder.

4.2.1.1 Solid cylinder 

 
Equation (4.15) was used to design the wick geometry. However, the 

temperature distribution of the wick structure can be determined through 
the solution of Laplace´s equation, subjected to appropriate boundary 
conditions, using the separation of variables method (ARPACI; 
LARSEN, 1984).   

Laplace´s equation solution can be simplified if the boundary 
conditions are homogeneous. For this purpose, the following 
temperature variable is proposed: 

 
 ? ? ) ? )

resulting in:  
 

 
|C?|&gt;C ? 1&gt; |?|&gt; ? |C?|IC ? 0 (4.17)

In Figure 38, the sketch of the evaporator plug (solid cylinder) 
physical model, which, as already mentioned, is split into two regions (1 
and 2), using the new temperature variable and so with the resulting 
homogeneous boundary condition in I ? 0, is presented.  

 

 
Figure 39 - Boundary conditions applied for the thermal problem 1. 

 
 In Figure 39, subdomain 1 of Figure 37 is presented. This conduction 
heat transfer problem can be formulated as

According to Poulikakos (1994), the general solution for this 
problem is:

On the other hand, it is displayed in the Figure 40, the physical 

model for the subdomain 2 conduction heat transfer problem. 
 

 
Figure 40 - Boundary conditions applied for the thermal problem: due to the 

non-uniform boundary conditions, the problem is split in two. 
 
Similarly, the problem 2 is also modeled using the Laplace equation:

 ?C?&gt;, 0? ? 0 (4.30) 

 

 
|?C?&gt;, ??|I ? ^­ ??2[55 (4.31) 

  
Due to the fact that this problem contains two non-homogeneous 

boundary conditions, the superposition method is applied and the 
problem is again divided in two, Problems 2a and 2b, each one with just 
one non-homogeneous boundary condition (see Figure 41).

Applying the boundary conditions (Equations (4.33), (4.34), (4.35) 

and (4.36)) and combining the Equations (4.37) and (4.38), the 
following solutions is obtained: 

 ??&gt;, I?C? ? ¨ ?! ?§P?®! ??¦P?®! ?? ¦??®? &gt;? ? §??®? &gt;??©!ªP sin?®! I? (4.39)

Similarly, the formulation of problem 2b, which schematic of the 
physical model is shown in Figure 41 is:  
 

 
|C?C¯|&gt;C ? 1&gt; |?C¯|&gt; ? |C?C¯|IC ? 0   ?? ? ? &gt; ? ? ,0 ? I ? ? (4.41)

Substituting the boundary condition, Equations (4.42), (4.43), (4.44) 

and (4.45) and combining the las two equations, one get the following 
transcendental equation:  

 

 
²??°!??±??°! ?? ? ²P?°! ??±P?°! ?? (4.48) 

 
Therefore, the following temperature distribution equation is obtained:

(4.50) 

 



122 
 

The two domains, 2a and 2b, are coupled through the &gt; ? ? 
interface, or: 

 ??&gt;, I?C? ? ??&gt;, I?C¯  (4.51) 
Substituting Equations (4.25) and (4.39) in the Equation (4.51), one 

gets:  

 

¨ ]! ¦???! &gt;?©!ªP sin??! I?? ¨ ?? ?§P?®! ??¦P?®! ?? ¦??®! &gt;?©?ªP? §??®! &gt;?? sin?®! I?

where Mm is defined as:

Now, from the energy conservation principle at the interface, one 

has: 

 
|?P?&gt;, I?|&gt; ? |?C?&gt;, I?|&gt;  (4.54) 

Due to the subdivision of region 2, one gets:  

 
|?P? ?&gt;, I?|&gt; ? |?C? ?&gt;, I?|&gt; ? |?C¯ ?&gt;, I?|&gt;  (4.55) 

Differentiating and substituting the temperature solutions (Equations 
(4.25) and (4.39) into Equation (4.54), the following expression is 
obtained:  ¨ ]! ?! ¦P??! ??©!ªP sin??! I?? ¨ ?! ®! ?§P?®! ??¦P?®!?? ¦P?®! ??©!ªP? §P?®!??? sin?®! I?

Ordering the terms of Equation (4.56) and applied the orthogonally

Finally, the matching of Equation (4.58) with Equations (4.59) and

4.2.1.2 Hollow cylinder 

 
Considering now the hollow cylinder region 3 (see Figure 37). The 

temperature T is modeled using Laplace´s equation: 
 



124 
 

|C)|&gt;C ? 1&gt; |)|&gt; ? |C)|IC ? 0 (4.61) 
 
Figure 42 shows the schematic of problem 3. 
 

 
Figure 42 - Schematic mathematical model of the thermal problem 3. 

 
As the boundary condition at z = ?, r = ? and r = ? are non-uniform, 

the superposition method can be used to solve this problem. Therefore, 
the problem is divided in three (3a, 3b and 3c), with uniform boundary 
conditions, as shown in Figure 43. 



125 
 

 
 

 

Figure 43 - Schematics of the superposition solution for the thermal problem 3.

The formulation of the Problem 3a (see Figure 43) is therefore:

 Solutions found for this boundary conditions show indeterminations 
in the solution due to the hyperbolic function when the eigenvalues 
become infinity. Therefore, in the solutions presented below, the 
boundary condition in z = ? was displaced to z = 0 and new dimensions 
l=?-? and ?=?-? were defined for the problems 3a, 3b and 3c. However, 
the information of original problem is conserved. Using the separation 
of variables method, the general solution for this problem is:

4.2.1.3 Energy balance 

 
As already mentioned, a well-designed evaporator must assure that 

most of the energy delivered to the evaporator is used to evaporate the 
working fluid in the liquid-vapor interface in the wick. This means that 
the heat should not flow to any other LHP component, especially the 
compensation chamber, where the heat leakage would increase the 
liquid temperature and so its pressure, decreasing the pressure drops 
along the LHP sections, which would, eventually prevent LHP operation 
or its start up. The present model provides a tool to verify, from the total 
energy delivered to the evaporator, the amount that is transferred to the 
liquid-vapor meniscus (conducted through the porous media hollow 
cylinder) and the heat lost to the compensation chamber (through the 
plug solid cylinder).  



130 
 

In steady state conditions, a simple heat balance within the 
evaporator establishes that the total energy delivered to the evaporator. 
This heat energy can be split into the one transferred to the meniscus 
interface qr|r=? (domain 3) and the other lost to the compensation 
chamber q? (passing through the interface between the porous media and 
the compensation chamber, qz|z=?), which gives: 

 
 ^[ ? ^? |?ª» ? ^L |Lª­  (4.92) 
  

Fourier Equation can be used to determine the heat transferred at 
both these interfaces, using the space derivatives of the temperature 
distribution expressions, obtained from the analytical models (Equations 
(4.70) and (4.80)), which is integrated along these surfaces. Actually, 
the heat leakage to the compensation chamber can be calculated by two 
means: considering the interface of the two cylinders or integrating the 
temperature distribution (Fourier law) along the cross-section area of the 
solid cylinder, at any point zi.  

 
The heat transfer in I ? I?  is 
 

 ^ ? ^P ? ^C, (4.93)

In the following section, the temperature field for a wick evaporator 

structure is determined using the set of equations developed in this 
section. The heat leak and heat used to evaporate the working fluid are 
also determined. A wick structure coupled to condenser, and liquid and 
vapor lines are modeled for one operation condition. 
 
4.2.2 Pressure distribution models 
 

The hydraulic behavior of the porous structure is modeled aiming the 
development of a tool for designing LHP wicks which are able to 
promote the working fluid pumping and phase change along the loop 
(see Figure 44). The following hypothesis were adopted: 

• The liquid-vapor phase change happens only at the 
interface between liquid and vapor, in the wick structure, 
according to Faghri (1995). It is considered that the heat 
supplied to the evaporator reaches the liquid-vapor 
interface due to the high thermal conductivity of the solid 
matrix in the porous media Flórez et al. (2013).  

• All the heat transferred by the wick structure to the liquid-
vapor interface is used for the working fluid phase change; 
therefore, the evaporation thermal resistance is much 
smaller than the conductance thermal resistance through 
the sintered porous media. 

• The fluid has uniform velocity within the compensation 
chamber. 

• The working fluid is incompressible. 
• Gravity effects are negligible. 
• The fluid that flows within the wick structure is laminar 

and has Reynolds number Re &amp;lt;1 (DYBBS; EDWARDS, 
1984), therefore Darcy´s equation is applied. The Reynolds 
number is based on the average velocity within the pore 
and its characteristic dimension is the pore diameter.  

Similar to the temperature distributions, the pressure field is also 
obtained from the solution of Laplace’s Equation, which results from the 



134 
 

mass conservation principle and the Darcy law applied for each 
component of the coordinate system (BEJAN, 2013; FAGHRI, 1995).  

 

 

Figure 44 - Sketch of the evaporator hydraulic model. 
 
The velocity is assumed to be  
 

 ç ? 7?? ?? ? 7?é ?é ? 7?? ?L, (4.108) 
 
The Darcy law can be written, in vector notation, as: 

 ç ? ? A?êëB ì$, (4.109) 
Where ì$ is the gradient of pressure, expressed in cylindrical 
coordinates as 

 

 ì$= 7?? í&amp;amp;í? ? 7?é P? í&amp;amp;íé ? 7?? í&amp;amp;íL  (4.110) 
 

 2ê is the permeability tensor and ? is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid. 
Substituting the Equation (4.110) into the Equation (4.109) and 
matching with the Equation (4.108)(4.115) , one can have:  

 

7?? ?? ? 7?é ?é ? 7?? ?L ? ? î2êvï =7?? |$|&gt; ? 7?é 1&gt; |$|? ? 7?? |$|I ? (4.111) 



135 
 

 
 

The velocity components of fluid can be obtained from the Darcy´s 
Law. For an isotropic medium, the tensor of the permeability becomes a 
zeroth order tensor (scalar): 

 

 ?? ? ? =2v? |$|&gt; , ?é ? ? =2v? 1&gt; |$|? , ?L ? ? =2v? |$|I  (4.112) 
 
Substituting the Equation (4.112)(4.119) components of velocity in 

the following conservation of mass equation in cylindrical coordinates 
one gets:  

 

 
|?|Ù ? 1&gt; |??&gt;?? ?|? ? 1&gt; |???? ?|? ? |???L ?|I ? 0 (4.113) 

 
resulting in a steady state Laplace equation for the pressure field, for the 
wick structure, 

 
|C$|&gt;C ? 1&gt; |$|&gt; ? |C$|IC ? 0    (4.114) 

As the geometry is non-uniform (solid and hollow cylinders), the 
problem is split into two, one hollow and one solid cylinder, as shown in 
Figure 45. The solid cylinder is also divided into two regions (problems 
4 and 5), to accommodate the non-uniform boundary condition at I ? ?.  

 

4.2.2.1 Hydraulic pressure distribution for solid wick structure 

 
The solution of the bidimensional Laplace equation requires four 

boundary conditions. Figure 45 shows these boundary conditions for the 
solid cylinder, which are: prescribed compensation chamber pressure Pcc 
at z = 0, hermetic conditions (no pressure gradient) at the evaporator 
case wall, r = ?, symmetry condition at r = 0. Two different boundary 
conditions for the solid cylinder are observed, z = ?: for 0 ? &gt; ? ?, 
?P/?z=0 and, for ? &amp;lt;r &amp;lt;?, a pressure gradient condition, obtained from 
the Darcy´s equation, where the liquid velocity is given by equation 
(4.4), is applied.  

The hydraulic problem for the solid cylinder region is expressed as 
 



136 
 

 
|C$|&gt;C ? 1&gt; |$|&gt; ? |C$|IC ? 0   ??  0 ? &gt; ? ? ,0 ? I ? ? (4.115) 

which is subjected to the following boundary conditions: 
 

 
|P?0, I?|&gt; ? 0 ? (4.116) 

 
 

|P??, I?|&gt; ? 0  (4.117)

138 
 

As already mentioned, the solid cylinder is divided into two regions, 
so that only one uniform boundary conditions is applied. However, even 
with this strategy, problems 4 and 5 still have two non-homogeneous 
boundary conditions, at I ? 0 and at I ? ?. To reduce one of these non-
homogeneities and so to be able to solve this problem using the 
separation of variable`s method, the parameter ?, which means the 
pressure difference relative to the compensation chamber pressure, is 
introduced:  
 
 c cP P? = ?  (4.120) 

 

 
 

Figure 46 - Schematic of the hydraulic problem divided for subdomains 4 and 5 
in terms of the new variable ?. 

 
Therefore, the problem given by Equations (4.115) to (4.126), in 

terms of the variable ? as present in Figure 46 is formulated as: 
 

 
|C?|&gt;C ? 1&gt; |?|&gt; ? |C?|IC ? 0   ?? 0 ? &gt; ? ?, 0 ? I ? ? (4.121)

 |õ|I ? 0  at 0 ? &gt; ? ?   and |?|I ? v? ^­2?? \???? at  ? ? &gt; ? ? (4.125) 
 
The non-homogeneous boundary condition given by Equation 

(4.125) is obtained using Equation (4.119), where the velocity is x ?z? ?? \??  in which z? ? ^­ ????  and q? is the heat flux that cross the 
boundary in z=?.

142 
 

On the other hand, problem 5 presents two non-homogeneous 
boundary conditions, as one can see in Figure 48. Therefore, in order to 
solve this problem using the separation of variables method, the problem 
is divided into two other problems, named 5a and 5b, with just one non-
homogeneous boundary condition each.  

Figure 48 presents the subdomain 5a. The mathematical formulation 
of this mass problem is

In Figure 48, the subdomain 5b and its boundary conditions are 
presented. The mathematical formulation of this problem is:

 Substituting the boundary condition into the last two equations, 
yields:

which is a transcendental equation, where the ?m values correspond to

one gets:

resulting in the equation:

To determine other parameter Rm, the following condition still needs

which can be written as:

145 
 

 
 

Again, substituting subdomains 5 and 4 solutions in the Equation 
(4.165), one obtain: 

 

¨ S! ?! ¦P?û! ??©!ªP sin?û! I?? ¨ ü! ?§P?0! ??¦P?0! ?? ¦P?0! ??©!ªP? §P?0! ??? sin?0! I?

(4.159) 

The Equation (4.159) can be arranged as an expanded Fourier series of a

4.2.3 Summary and application of the thermal model equations 

 
In this section, the temperature field and heat ratio for a wick

parameters and thermophysical properties used to apply the thermal 
model are shown. 

In Table 10 and Table 11, thermal solution equations for the solid

presented. The analytical solution for these equations was implemented 
in Maple software. The series convergence criteria are achieved when 
the difference between the heat ratio inlet and output for each domain is 
less than 0.01 W. Generally, the convergence criterion for Fourier series 
solution was obtained for 150 terms.

In order to solve the equations system, a heat ratio q? at the interface 

at z=? and ? ? &gt; ? ? (subdomain 2 e 3, see Figure 45) is chosen, for 
which results a temperature distribution T?(r). This solid cylinder 
temperature distribution T?(r) is used as the prescribed temperature 
distribution boundary condition for the hollow cylinder (domain 3) and 
a new heat transfer ratio q? in the interface at z = ? and ? ? &gt; ? ? is 
calculated. If the difference between the heat transfer ratio for domains 2 
and 3, and the q? considered in the interface at z = ? and ? ? &gt; ? ? is 
less than 0.01 W, the convergence is achieved. Otherwise, a new heat 
ratio q? is chosen and the procedure is repeated. In Figure 51 and Figure 
52, the temperature distributions of the wick structure, which geometry 
is described in Table 9, are shown. With this temperature distribution, 
together with the pressure field (to be presented in the following 
section), one is able to make a thermodynamic analysis of the 
evaporator wick structure operation. 

In Figure 51, one can see that temperature distribution in the solid 
cylinder presents a close to unidimensional behavior in the r direction. 
However, in the region close to the coupling with the solid cylinder, the 
isothermal lines show a bidimensional behavior, evidencing a heat leak 
to the compensation chamber. One can also see that the temperature 
distribution due to the boundary conditions in the vapor region are 
coherent with the physical model (hypothesis) with exception to the left 
lower region, due to the coupling of two different boundary conditions 
(insulation in the solid cylinder and prescribed temperature in the 
hollow cylinder).

In Figure 52a, at point (?,?) can be observed that the coupling solution 
do not satisfy the original boundary condition (prescribed temperature), this 
behavior can be due to boundary condition of uniform flux in z = ? in the 
subdomain 2. 

 
4.2.4 Summary and application of the pressure model equations 

 
In Table 12, the pressure solution equations for both the solid and the 

hollow cylinder that compose the wick structure evaporator are 
presented. Similarly, the numerical solution for these equations are 
obtained using the Maple software. Unlike the thermal solution, the 
pressure field for each domain is solved separately. The convergence for 
Fourier series solution was also obtained with 150 terms. In Figure 53 
and Figure 54, the field and gradient of pressure to geometry study are 
shown for all domains. The pressure drop in domain 3 presents the 
highest pressure drop for this configuration. The pressure drop in the 
domain 4-5 represents approximately the 30 % of the total pressure drop 
in the wick. The pressure field coupled to temperature field allows to 
evaluate the performance of the wick geometry proposed applied in the 
LHP evaporator. This model will be used in the chapter 5 in order to 
analysis the thermal and hydraulic performance of the wick structure.

From the temperature and pressure field is possible to determine the 
thermodynamic state of any point. Using the pressure-temperature curve 
and applying the thermal equilibrium condition (Equation 2.4) is 
possible to evaluate if the region of the domain contents vapor. In Figure 
55, thermodynamic states for the compensation chamber and the vapor 
are represented on the curve of saturation on a P-T diagram. For any 
point (r,z), its pressure is determined from the pressure field. This 
pressure represents the local saturation pressure with its corresponding 
temperature. Sequentially, the temperature for point (r,z) is determined 
from temperature field. Then, the difference of temperature ?T = T(r,z) - 
Tsat is determined (where Tsat evaluated at pressure P(r,z)). This 
difference of temperature is called as superheating of liquid.  If the 
superheating at any point is higher than the critical superheating, the 
nucleation boiling can happen and the bubbles are formed inside of wick 
structure. 

 

 
Figure 55 - Analyses of the thermodynamic equilibrium at two states inside of 

wick evaporator LHP. 
 
The presence of vapor in the wick structure produces an increasing 

of thermal resistance in the evaporator. When vapor is trapped in the 
wick structure, it prevents the flow of liquid to the evaporator active 
zone. In the Figure 51, one can see that the interface between the solid 
and hollow cylinder is in a critical region for this geometry, where the 
reduction of transversal area due to vapor formation can increase the 
pressure drop, reducing the capacity of heat transfer of LHP. 



160 
 

  

Reay and Kew (2006) present one equation based on the non-
homogeneous nucleation theory for commonly wick structures used in 
the heat pipes HP, expressed as: 

 

 ?) ? 3.06?? )£?Ù?? ??? ?'  (4.210) 
 
where ?l is the superficial tension, ?v is the fluid density, hlv is the heat 
latent of fluid and ?T is the thermal boundary layer thickness defined 
from model of Hsu (1962). This thickness is taken as 25 ?m for a typical 
heat pipe evaporator. 

For the geometry analyzed and described in the Table 9, the pressure 
and temperature on the compensation chamber are 18.6 kPa and 58.7 
°C, respectively. For the point (?,?) where the maximum temperature 
and minimal pressure is achieved by the working fluid, we have that 
T(?,?)=78.02 and P(?,?)=18.18 kPa. Here, for a water distillate at a 
temperature of 58.02 °C, the ?Tcrit defined by Equation (4.210) is 
9.63°C. On the other hand, the superheating for the point (?,?) is 20, 
thus as ?T &gt; ?Tcrit, bubbles are formed inside this point. The same 
evaluation can be made for the geometry and to determine which 
regions are occupied by bubbles. From this analysis is possible to 
determine if a geometry proposed for a power load will be affected by 
the presence partial or total of bubbles that increase the area to mass and 
heat transfer.  

In the chapter 5, same analysis will be applied to the geometry of the 
wick evaporator studied.  
 
4.3 Loop heat pipe operation model 

 
 In the last section, two bi-dimensional mathematical models were 
proposed to analyze the thermal and hydraulic behavior of the wick 
structure located within evaporators of LHPs. Obviously, the evaporator 
is the major component of a LHP and the geometry of the porous media 
located inside it has major influence in the performance of the device. 
Therefore, sophisticated detailed models are of prime importance, as the 
onset of LHP failure (usually by dry-out) commonly starts due to the 
undesired vapor formation in very specific points or regions of the 
evaporator.  However, electric analogy steady state simple models may 
be useful in the determination of LHP operation temperature (usually 
defined as the compensation chamber temperatures) and of the 



161 
 

 

maximum the system is able to transfer.  Kaya et al. (1999) employed 
thermal circuit analogy models to determine the operation temperature 
of cylindrical loop heat pipes. Later, Singh et al. (2009) also used these 
models to describe the operation of heat pipe with plane evaporator. 
  

 
Figure 56 - Sketch of the equivalent thermal circuit of the loop heat pipe. 

 
The sketch of the equivalent thermal circuit of the loop heat pipes 

proposed in this thesis is present in the Figure 56. In this circuit, the heat 
qH, delivered to the evaporator external wall (at temperature Th) has two 
different paths to follow. In one path, represented by Rw, heat is 
delivered to the wick structure and is transferred up to the wick working 
fluid meniscus, where phase change takes place, at temperature Tv. In 
the other path, heat is conducted to the compensation chamber through 
the evaporator casing wall (resistance Rc) at temperature Tcc. The heat 



162 
 

  

transferred in this second path is undesired, and so, considered as a heat 
loss. However, heat can also be lost to the compensation chamber 
directly through the wick plug (solid cylinder) through the R? thermal 
resistance. Finally, also through the casing and other materials that 
compose the LHP, heat qs can be exchanged directly between the 
compensation chamber and the liquid lines. The vapor and liquid lines 
are considered adiabatic. The net sensible heat qL transported by the 
vapor through the liquid line is eventually removed in the condenser 
region of the LHP.  

Figure 57 shows the evaporator equivalent circuit. The circuit is 
composed of three thermal resistances: hollow wick radial resistance R?, 
solid wick plug resistance R? and evaporator case Rc, representing the 
heat path between the evaporator section and the compensation 
chamber. In Figure 57, one can be also observe the heat transfer rates at 
each branch of the circuit. The applied power qH is delivered to the 
external wall of the evaporator section: part of the heat is transferred to 
compensation chamber (heat leak, qs), through the case wall and wick 
plug. In order to obtain a good performance from the device, it is 
expected that this heat leak should be compensated by the working fluid 
that entering the compensation chamber in subcooled liquid state.

An energy balance can be performed at each node of the circuit. For 
node H one has: 

 
 

^? ? ^
 ? ^[  (4.211) 
 
where qc is the heat transferred through the case and qe is the heat 
transferred to evaporation section. Using the thermal resistance analogy 
equation, this last expression takes the following form, in terms of 
temperature differences:   

  
where the thermal resistance of evaporation case Rc (unidimensional 
thermal resistance for a tube) is expressed as 

 S

and the thermal resistance of evaporation region (radial thermal 
resistance for a hollow cylinder) is: 
 

 S[ ? ??A ÖÆBC?? ?·¸¸, (4.214) 
 
 Likewise, to node W we have: 

 
 

^[ ? ^­ ? ^» , (4.215) 
where q? is the heat transferred from the wick plug to the compensation 
chamber and q? is the net heat used to evaporate the working fluid.

4.4  Liquid and vapor lines pressure drop 

 
 The pressure drops, due the friction of vapor and liquid flowing 
through the lines, are modeled using equations of the form:

Darcy-Weisbach developed the following equation for the calculation of

 ?$ ? ? ]D ?xC2  (4.222) 
where f is the Darcy friction factor, which depends on the Reynold number, 
and D is the internal diameter of pipe while L is the length of the pipe. For 
smooth channels in laminar regime, the friction factor is expressed as: 

 ? ? 64S[  S[ ? 2300 (4.223) 
For turbulent regime: 

 ? ? 0.316S[ ?.C?  S[ &gt; 2300 (4.224) 
where Re is the Reynold number based on the diameter.

4.5  Condenser analysis 
 
The condenser is an important component for the performance of LHPs. 

The condenser should be designed to reject the heat inserted in the LHP in 
steady state conditions. The condenser pressure drop and the output 
temperature of the condensate influence the operation temperature of LHP. 
Therefore, one important parameter is the length of the condenser. This 
length is used to calculate the pressure drop due to the working fluid phase 
change and in the transport of subcooled liquid.  

In this section, mathematical models are proposed to determine the 
phase change length in LHP condenser. For modelling purposes, the 
condenser is considered divided into two regions: the first used to transfer 
latent heat (and so to cause phase change) and second to transfer sensible 
heat (and so, to subcool the condensate). 
 
4.5.1 Heat transfer analysis 

 

Figure 58 - Schematics of the divisions of the condenser. 
 

The condenser configuration studied in this work consists of a U 
shaped bent tube, welded on a flat copper plate (see Figure 58), with the 
working fluid flowing through this tube. The copper plate is attached to 
an aluminum block. The aluminum block has channels inside, where 
water flows through it. The temperature of water is controlled by a 
thermostatic bath. Figure 59 shows a schematic of the tube, the plate 
cross section and the welding material, which connects them. For 
modelling purposes, the tube is considered straight, with the external 



166 
 

  

face subjected to convection heat transferred to the ambient air. A 
thermal resistance network is constructed to model the heat transfer 
between the tube and ambient air, as also shown in Figure 59.  

 

 

Figure 59 - Condenser latent heat transfer analysis. 
 

To calculate the condenser tube length, where the liquid changes phase, 
a heat balance over the condenser region is performed:

where  

 

 \? ? 2G&gt;? ]C? (4.226) 
 
Where ??y is the heat transfer coefficient for phase change in horizontal 
tube, \? is the internal area of tube, Tsat is the saturation temperature, ]2? 
is the length dimension of condenser necessary for the working fluid 
changes of phase. The heat transfer coefficient is calculated from Chato 
(1962) as: 

 

 ??y ? 0.555 ???? ??? ? ?? ?2?6????v? ?)/?E ? )/ ?.? ?

where ??} is the vaporization enthalpy, Cp,l is the specific heat, g is the 
gravitational acceleration, ?l is the density of fluid in liquid phase, ?v is the 
density of fluid in vapor phase, kl is the thermal conductivity of fluid, ?l is 
the dynamic viscosity of liquid and Di is the internal diameter of tube. 

From energy conservation balance, the power also can be expressed as:

where qlv is the latent heat, qcond is the heat transferred by conduction 
through the lower side of the pipe section and qconv is the heat transferred by 
natural convection in the upper side of section pipe. In terms of thermal 
resistances, this last equation takes the form: 
 

 z? ??? ? ?)[ ? )©?S?? ? ?)[ ? )? ?S%

where Rup and Rdown is the equivalent thermal resistance of the upper and 
lower sides of the tube, respectively. The upper resistance is composed by a

condenser necessary for the working fluid changes of phase. 

The mean thermal coefficient ?? is obtained from the definition of ³? ? ??. 2?  where Nu is calculated by the following equation according 
to Churchill and Chu (1975):

where Rb, Rl and Ri are the plane, tube wall and welding resistances, 
respectively.  

The output temperature of the condenser is determined from an 
energy balance in the second region of the tube, where the already 
condensed working fluid is sub-cooled. The heat balance over the 
condenser region, where the working fluid is in the liquid phase (see 
Figure 60), is calculated by:

4.5.2 Pressure drop 
 

The pressure drop observed in the two-phase flow region represents 
an important parcel of the total pressure drop observed in the loop heat 
pipe. After the length of condenser where the liquid changes phase is 
determined using the thermal model presented in the last section, the 
pressure drop can be calculated from the literature models. Kandlikar et 
al. (2005) presented several correlations to determine the pressure drop 
during the condensation. In these works, these authors selected the 
models of Lockhart and Martinelli (1949), Friedel (1979, 1980) and 
Chisholm (1973) to calculate de condensation pressure drops, according 
to the range of validation of each correlation. In order to use these 
correlations, the following parameters need to be determined.

4.6 Conclusions 

 
In this chapter, mathematical models for the temperature distribution 

of the evaporator and the condenser were proposed as design tools for 
LHPs. Literature models are also presented and will be used to predict 
the performance of the LHP in the next chapter. Two approaches were 
used for the mathematical model development: 2D and 1D. The 2D 
modeling was proposed to study and determine geometry parameters 
that will guarantee the correct performance and to allow for the design 
of the evaporator wick structure of LHP. The temperature and pressure 
fields allow for the identification of the dimensions of the wick structure 
able to prevent LHP dry out. From the 1D model approach, a critical 
theoretical parameter, which allows for the selection of the evaporator 
geometry and operation mode, was proposed. The analogy between 
thermal and electrical circuit was used to determine the operation 



174 
 

  

temperature and heat transfer limits. Several literature models to 
determine the heat transfer and pressure drops in LHP components, such 
as evaporator, liquid and vapor lines, were also presented.

5 EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL ANALISIS OF LHP 

In this chapter, an analysis of the geometry design of the wick 
structure of the loop heat pipe is presented. The thermal and hydraulic 
2D models proposed in the last chapter are used to evaluate the 
influence of geometrical and thermophysical properties of the capillary 
structure on the performance of the evaporator. A difference of 
temperature higher than the critical temperature leads to the formation 
of vapor within the wick structure and increases both the thermal 
resistance and the operation temperature. Additionally, the heat leak to 
the compensation chamber increases the temperature of the working 
fluid, reducing the thermodynamic drive force between evaporator 
region and the compensation chamber. On the other hand, a large 
pressure drop in the wick structure reduces the heat transfer capacity of 
the equipment. Therefore, the geometry design of the wick structure 
must guarantee the appropriate difference of temperature between the 
heater and evaporation zone, resulting in a small heat leakage to the 
compensation chamber, and the minimum pressure drop in the wick 
structure.  

In order to analyze the influence of the geometry parameters in the 
design of LHPs, the tools developed in chapters 3 and 4 of this work are 
used to design two LHPs. In the first section, a design procedure is 
proposed, based on two copper powders with different average particle 
diameters, selected to be used in the fabrication of the sintered porous 
media. In the second section, the experimental work developed to 
validate the hypotheses formulated from the experimental design is 
presented. In the last section, the 1D model, which is based on the 
electrical circuit analogy is compared with experimental evaporator 
operation temperatures.   

 
5.1 Loop heat pipe design methodology 

 
Figure 61 presents the main steps proposed to design an evaporator 

for a loop heat pipe. Four fundamental aspects are considered: 
requirements, working fluid, wick structure, and heat and mass transfer.   

The fist block shows the requirements of the design divided in two 
types: geometry and operation. The available area to transfer the heat Ae, 
and the distance L between the source and heat sink are the geometric 
requirements or constrictions. The operation temperature To and the 
power transferred qe are the operational requirements. They are related 



176 
 

  

to the conditions for safe operation of the electronic device or heat 
source that need thermal control.  

After defining the initial geometry parameters, the working fluid 
must be selected, according to the operation temperature. In the thermal 
control of electronic devices, methanol, ethanol and water are frequently 
used as working fluids. As mentioned in the chapter 2, the working fluid 
must also be chemically compatible with the wick and case material to 
avoid the formation of non-condensable gases.  
 The following steps are used to define the geometrical dimensions of 
the wick structure. Once the heat transfer area is established according 
to the application, it is possible to know the minimal active length of the 
evaporator. Equation (4.15) can be used to establish the critical ratio ?/l 
and so the thickness of the wick structure. Then, the thermal and 
pressure fields can be obtained using the 2D-model to determine the 
temperature distribution and pressure drops in the wick structure and to 
evaluate the performance of the geometry. As mentioned in chapter 4, 
the pressure field in the wick structure is coupled with the temperature 
field by the boundary condition in the evaporation surface. The 
thermophysical properties can be evaluated from the proposed models or 
experimental data. The wick structure should provide the heat and mass 
transfer to the evaporation region and to avoid, as much as possible, heat 
leakage to the compensation chamber. The 2D-model allows for the 
analysis of the behavior of wick structure in the worst operation 
conditions, guaranteeing a safe design for the application of the LHP. 
 After that the geometrical dimensions are determined, if the 
temperature distribution and pressure field are well behaved, the loop 
heat pipe performance can be determined using the 1D-model. 
According to Maydanik et al. (2011b), the failure of these devices 
occurs when the vapor is produced inside the wick structure. The 
presence of vapor within the porous media occurs due to the insufficient 
capillary pumping (able to continuously refill the whole wick structure) 
and to the superheating of the liquid above the critical temperature. The 
temperature criterion is evaluated using the 2D model. To determine the 
capillary limit, all pressure drops in the loop must be calculated, 
including the pressure drop of the wick structure. The first 
approximation to determine the fluid inventory is to consider that all 
heat applied is transferred to evaporation zone. The operation 
temperature is obtained from the heat balance equation, when the ratio 
between the total pressure and temperature in the wick is equal to slope 
of the pressure-temperature curve, at the temperature of operation.

5.5.1 Evaporator active section 
 
From the measurements performed with the defined type of powders 

and from the models developed, it can be concluded that for an average 
particle diameter smaller than 20 ?m, permeability and effective thermal 
conductivity are not adequate to be used in the fabrication of the 
evaporator of a LHP. From this particle type, the permeability begins to 
decrease and the thermal conductivity increases. Low permeability 
increases the pressure drop inside of wick structure, thus reduces the 
heat transfer capacity. On the other hand, high effective thermal 
conductivity increases the heat leak to compensation chamber, 
increasing the possibility to form vapor in the compensation chamber. 
The wick geometry should be designed to provide an equilibrium of the 
response of this property in the heat and mass transfer, minimizing the 
pressure drop and heat leak. 

The following study has the objective to identify the effects of each 
one property, comparing two types of powder and the wick parameters 
geometries (length of bottom ? and thickness of the wick active zone ?) 
on the performance of the LHP evaporator. Therefore, the temperature 
distribution is obtained from the 2D-model presented in chapter 4 and its 
maximum temperature and the heat leakage are determined. Table 13 
presents a summary of the thermophysical properties of the wick 
structure, fabricated using powders B and C, measured in the laboratory.

evaporator of the LHP tested.

As already highlighted, the selection of the appropriate wick 

thickness depends on the material, the geometry of the porous media, 
and the working fluid selected. The plots of the ratio ? ?? , Equation 
(4.15), as a function of the evaporator temperature are shown in the 
Figure 62 for a wick structure whose parameters are given by Table 13, 
and for two different working fluids: water and methanol. In this figure, 



179 
 

 

the value of ?/l for water at 60 °C is highlighted for both powder 
structures. These values will be used in the design of the LHP to be 
tested experimentally in the next section. In the Figure 62, one can see 
that, as the reference temperature decreases, thicker wick structures are 
necessary. In addition, one can also observe that methanol requires 
thinner wicks than water for a same reference temperature.  

To understand this behavior, each term of the critical relation ?/l 
equation (Equation (4.15), here reproduced) are compared, for both 
working fluids:

  , (4.15) 
 
One can see that the first term is the similar for both liquids, because, 

according to Florez et al. (2013), the influence of the liquid in the 
effective thermal conductivity is negligible The second term 
corresponds to the working fluid thermophysical properties and, besides 
the liquid dynamic viscosity and density for water and methanol are not 
very different, the latent heat of water is approximately twice the latent 
heat of methanol. This means that more methanol than water is expected 
to be evaporated for the same heat load. As the evaporated fluid must be 
replenished, more methanol is expected to be flow through the wick and 
so higher pressure drops for methanol are expected. Considering only 
this effect, methanol could need of a thicker wick, for the same heat 
load. However, this behavior is compensated by the last term, related to 
the slope of the curve pressure-temperature, which, for water is around 
four times smaller than methanol´s, for the temperature level analyzed.

The fabrication process of the LHP used in this work can be divided in 
several steps: 

• Cutting and bending of the tubes for the fabrication of the 
evaporator, the condenser and vapor and liquid lines, in the 
required dimensions.  

• Machining caps of the evaporator section. 
• Cleaning of pieces used in the several components of the LHP 

using detergent, acetone, trichloroethylene and finally a 
solution of sulfuric acid at 10 % in volume. 

• Fabrication of the wick structure with deposition of powder in 
the case of the evaporator (see picture of Figure 64). To obtain 
the designed thickness of the layer in the evaporation section, a 
steel matrix with the desirable diameter is employed.  

• Sintering of copper powder in special electrical furnace, with 
atmosphere and temperature controlled. 

• Assembling and welding of all components using acetylene- 
oxygen welding. After this step, the external surface is again 
cleaned with sulfuric acid solution to remove ash. This process 



183 
 

 

must be carried out carefully in order to avoid that the cleaning 
solution comes to interior of device. 

• Evacuating of the LHP is followed by leak testing using a 
spectrometer analyzer (see Figure 65). Helium gas is atomized 
on the external wall of LHP and the spectrometer detects the 
presence of gas inside of LHP. 

• Filling with the working fluid.

5.1.2.1 Wick geometry evaporator ANOVA analysis 

 
 This section presents a two-dimensional temperature distribution 
analysis of the porous media using the model presented earlier in the 
chapter 4. Statistical tools are used to study the influence of the 
geometric parameters on the thermal performance of evaporators of the 
LHP geometry under study (see Figure 63), with wicks made from the 
porous media described in Table 10. The values for the maximum 
temperature Tmax and the heat leak qcc are used as the response variables. 
The following parameters were selected for this analysis: the type of 
sintered porous media based on the different values of powder average 
particle diameter, ratio between evaporator thickness ? and evaporator 
length l (?/l), and ratio between the bottom evaporator length ? and 
evaporator length l, (?/l). Two levels (higher (+) and lower (-)) were 
selected for each parameter or factor. The levels for the parameter ? 
(which depends on the fluid, as established by equation (4.15)), were 
employed in this study, considering water as the working fluid. Table 15 
shows the parameter values adopted in this study. The combination of 
these variable levels results in 23 = 8 experiments of a factorial 
statistical design. The response variables were obtained for each 
experiment using the temperature distribution of 2-D model, the total 
pressure drop and the equilibrium thermodynamic Equation (2.4) 
presented in chapter 4.

numerical levels for the factor (?/l) change according to the 
characteristic powder diameter. The results, using the models presents in 
the former chapters, for the maximum temperature Tmax and heat leak qcc 
are presented in Table 17.

The influence of each one of the parameters on the responses (Tmax, 
qcc) was evaluated using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) 
(MONTGOMETY, 1991). The Statistica® software was used for data 
computation, considering a confidence interval of 95 % (?=0.05 of 
significance level).

identified a significant effect (p &amp;lt;0.5) for the factor “powder particle

Fisher Probability Distribution Function. The parameter ?/l showed no

Pareto chart presented in Figure 66, where the red line represents the 
level of significance considered for the analysis (5 %). The significant 
factors are those that present higher effects than the level of 
significance.

The analysis of variance for factorial design, with the heat leak qcc as 
response, is presented in Table 19. The statistical analysis with ANOVA 
identified that the main factors and their interactions are not significant 
(p &gt; 0.5) on the response heat leak qcc. From this analysis, the best 
thermal design is the case 7. This design produces the lowest 
temperature difference and heat leak. From these statistical analyses one 
can see that a wick evaporator geometry with 1.2· (?/l) can be used to 
guarantee the operation of LHP evaporator. The analyses also show that 
(?/l) larger than 0.1 is sufficient to separate the evaporation active zone 
and the compensation chamber.

5.2  Experimental work 

 
To evaluate the thermal performance of the first LHP constructed, an 

experimental setup was designed and built. Controlled thermal energy 
was provided by four electric cartridge heaters (maximum power 
generation capacity of 100 W), which were inserted in a thick copper 
plate, with the low surface machined so the evaporator could 
accommodate the heater perfectly (see Figure 69). The heaters were fed 
by a controlled electric energy source equipment. Cooling was provided 
by means of a small heat exchanger, made of a thick hollow aluminum 
block, with internally machined grooves, cooled by water from a 
thermal bath circulated.

A picture of the experimental setup is presented in Figure 68. The 
experiment control and the thermocouple readings were provided by a 
data acquisition system and respective software.

 Figure 70 shows a plot of the temperature (left vertical axis) and 
electric power input (right vertical axis) as a function of time, for the 
LHP Case A, operating in steady state conditions. The steady state 
conditions are considered achieved when the variations of all the 
monitored temperatures are smaller than 1oC. The evaporator 
temperatures (thermocouples T11, T12, T13 and T14, see Figure 69 for 
location) show obviously, the higher levels, while the condenser

(thermocouples T3, T4, T5, T6 and T7) show lower temperatures. The 
startup of the device is characterized by the temperatures T1, T2 and T3 
sudden increase. One can see that, for the first power input of 5 W, the 
LHP took around 2000 seconds to start up, which can be observed when 
the liquid line temperatures (Thermocouples T8, T9 and T10) starts to 
decrease, which means that the condensate reached the liquid line close 
to the compensation chamber (in other words, the working fluid cycle is 
closed). After that, the system operated for the power inputs of 10, 15, 
20 and 25 W, showing better performances (the temperature difference 
between evaporator and condenser decreases), for higher power inputs. 
After 30 W, the system stopped working. In the next section this limit is 
analyzed.

 The same LHP was then filled with water and tested (Table 20, right 
column). The thermal behavior of this LHP with water is shown in 
Figure 71, for the same conditions tested in Figure 70. One can easily 
see from this plot that the LHP did not work with water. This behavior 
was expected as the wick thickness was designed for methanol (see 
Section 5.5.1 explanation), showing that the design tool developed for 
determination of the wick thickness was correct.

Figure 71 - Thermal behavior of the LHPs described in Table 20, operating with 

water (case A). 
 
 Another LHP was designed to operate with water, as shown in Case 
B of Table 20. Comparing Cases A and B (see Table 20), one can 
observe that these LHP’s have basically the same geometry 
configuration, with the major difference being the wick thickness. 
Figure 72 shows the thermal behavior of Case B. In this figure, one can 
see that the startup was possible only after the application of 15W after 
approximately 2500 seconds, when the temperatures T1, T2 and T3 
starts a sudden increase. The LHP operated quite well up to 60 W of 
power input. Actually, the thermal performance of the device increased 
from 15 to 60 W, which can be observed by the decreasing of the 
temperature difference between evaporator and condenser. After this 
power level, the LHP started to show indications that the operational 
limits were close, as temperature pulses are observed for thermocouple 
T4, located in the condenser serpentine, near to condenser entry region, 
showing the presence of vapor. This means that, probably, the condenser 
is reaching its heat transfer limit before the evaporator. The plots of 
Figure 70, Figure 71 and Figure 72 show that the proposed model for 
the determination of the thickness of the porous media, among other 
usages, gives a good estimative of this parameter and should be used as 
a design tool for LHPs and heat pipes.

5.3 Validation of the mathematical model  

 
In this section, the temperature distribution obtained by the 

mathematical model is compared with the numerical simulation results. 
Commercial software Ansys was used in this study. The physical model 
sketched in Figure 35 was numerically reproduced. The objective of this 
model was to obtain results that would be impossible to obtain 
experimentally, such as the heat fluxes in the boundaries of the porous 
media and the temperature distribution along the wick. This numerical 
study is used in the validation of the theoretical model. The simulations 
were considered converged when the RMS residue (difference in the 
temperatures for two consecutive iterations for all elements) was less 
than 1x10-6. Table 21 shows the geometry of the evaporator porous 
media used in this comparison.

The heat leakage were determined theoretically using the heat 

balance equation, Equation. (4.92) and, numerically, directly with the 
software results (see Table 22). From this table one can see that the 
calculation of the power transferred to the meniscus q? and the power 
lost to the compensation chamber q? was not exactly the same, although 
the total heat transferred was the same, 70 W. Actually, this difference 
can be imputed to the discretization error, which is a function of the 
number of mesh elements employed, as well as the approximation of 
uniform flux used to couple of solid and hollow cylinder.  

The temperature and heat transfer data shown in Table 22 were 
obtained using 7.81x106 mesh elements. To obtain the same precision, 
around 300 terms of the Fourier series were employed, demanding lower 
computational processing time than that required for the numerical 
simulations. 

Figure 73 shows the 3D numerical temperature distribution of the 
wick structure studied. One can see from this figure that the temperature 
field is basically 2D and that the 2D hypothesis adopted to the analytical 
model is quite precise.

Figure 73 - 3D numerical temperature distribution.  

 
 The temperature distributions obtained from both numerical and 
mathematical analysis are shown in Figure 73. One can observe from 
this figure that the temperature distributions show very similar 
behaviors. The largest temperature gradients are observed vertically, 
from the top to the bottom direction (heat delivery surface to the 
meniscus direction). In the area behind the heated region (right), the 
temperature field has a quasi-one-dimensional behavior. Two larger 
direction variations are actually observed in the insulated left region of 
the evaporator (solid cylinder). Note that the numerical simulation map 
(upper map in Figure 73) is drawn observing the geometry of the actual 
wick structure studied. The comparison between theoretical model and 
numerical simulation results can also be observed from the temperature 
profile plots, for two porous media cross sections, vertical and 
horizontal lines shown in Figure 74.

Figure 74 - Cross section position for the plots shown in Figure 35. 
 
 Figure 74 shows the comparison between temperatures, obtained 
from analytical and numerical models, as a function of z at r = 5.6 mm 
and as a function of r at z = 7.89 mm. One can see from these plots that 
the temperature curves are quite similar for r = 5.6 mm, considering 
both temperature level and distribution. The average difference between 
theoretical and numerical simulation models is around 0.9 °C, 
equivalent to 1.5 % (modulus of the ratio of the difference between 
maximum theoretical and numerical temperatures and the maximum 
numerical temperature), showing the good quality of the model. In the 
other hand, the temperature curves for z = 7.89 mm show that the 
difference between temperatures increase as r increases. The highest 
difference is 1.51 °C, equivalent to 2.4 %. This difference can be 
explained by the effect of the hypothesis of uniform heat flux used to 
couple the two domains, in the analytical solution.   
 Concluding this section, one can see that the theoretical model was 
able to reproduce the heat fluxes at the evaporation surfaces, the heat 
leaks and the temperature distribution along the wick structure. 
Therefore, the theoretical model can be considered validated, showing 
that this model can be used in the design of the LHP evaporators.  
 In the next section, a complete LHP, using the designed evaporator, 
was constructed and tested. Also, the testing results are discussed.

5.4 Temperature and pressure fields analysis 
 

This section presents an analysis of the temperature and the pressure 
fields. Thermal and hydrodynamic responses of the wick geometry 
shown in Table 20 (case B) is modeled using the equations developed in 
chapter 4 for a power load of 70 W. The pressure drop in the loop 
calculated from the pressure models in the condenser, liquid and vapor 
lines are used to determine the boundary condition for the thermal 
model. The properties of the working fluid were calculated at 60°C. The 
objective of the analyses is to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed 
geometry to operate under the thermal power of 70 W, and to evaluate 
the presence of vapor bubbles inside the wick structure, the heat leak 
and pressure a maximum temperature. Figure 76, Figure 77, Figure 78, 
and Figure 79 present the contours and surfaces of the temperature and 
pressure field for the wick geometry described in Table 20 (case B).

The thermodynamic equilibrium was evaluated for a vapor 
temperature of 60 °C using the Equation (2.4) and for a power input of 
70 W. In the interface between the domains 1-2 and 3 for the point (?,?), 
the maximum temperature was 60.43 °C. This value shows that heating 
at the interface is very low. Therefore, the evaporation in the interface is 
small for this power load. The heat ratio that crosses the interface at z=? 
and ? &amp;lt;r &amp;lt;? calculated from the equations presented in Table 11 was 
0.85 W, which represents only 1.2 % of the total power applied into the 
heating surface. As shown by the ANOVA analysis, the heat leak is very 
low due to the strong temperature gradient in the radial direction of the 
hollow cylinder domain. From the Figure 77a and Figure 77b for the 
domain 3, one can see that maximum temperature at point (?,?) is 63.4 
°C. For the same wick geometry, the contours and gradients of the 
pressure field are presented in the Figure 78 and Figure 79. As one can 
see, the highest-pressure drop is in the domain 6 and it is about 64 % of 
the total pressure for this wick structure evaporator. In Figure 78b, the 
pressure at point (?,?) is 17.02 kPa. 

The total pressure drop should be smaller than the maximum 
capillary pressure of the LHP under operation. The pressure drop 
increases with the power load until the pumping capacity is achieved. 
This condition is called the capillary limit. However, the pressure drop 
increase is also produced by the presence of vapor inside of the wick 
structure that blocks the working fluid flow to the evaporative surface. 
Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate whether the thermodynamic state 
inside of wick structure is above the critical conditions where vapor is 
formed. In Figure 80, the thermodynamic state of the compensation 
chamber, the vapor zone and the point (?,?) of the wick structure are 
plotted in the P-T diagram for water. From this figure, one can see that 
the temperature at the point (?,?) is higher than the temperature of 
saturation corresponding to pressure 17.02 kPa. Hence, the working 
fluid (water) at this point is a superheated liquid with (Tl – Tsat) = 6.72 
°C. To determine if bubbles can be formed in this condition, the 
superheating (Tl – Tsat) should be compared to the superheating criteria. 
Superheating approach from homogeneous nucleation is very high to 
initiate the boiling at liquid-solid interface (CAREY, 2007). Usually, the 
literature presents criteria based on the theory of heterogeneous 
nucleation, which is the nucleation at the interface between the fluid in 
metastable state and a solid phase contacting it. The critical difference 
of temperature using Equation (4.210) for point (?,?) is 10.45 °C. 

 
 



206 
 

  

 
 

 
Figure 80 - P-T diagram for thermodynamic analysis of the LHP described in 

Table 20 (case B). 
 
The thermodynamic analysis of this specific point shows that this 

wick geometry can operate for a power load 70 W without formation of 
bubbles inside, according to the criteria calculated by equation (4.210). 
On the other hand, Maydanik et al. (2011b) and Faghri (1995) explain 
that LHP’s may continue to operate if the bubbles leave the wick 
structure through the liquid phase. Using the temperature and pressure 
field is possible to determine if a region inside of the wick structure 
present the formation of bubbles. The blockage of vapor can reduce the 
working fluid transversal flow area, making the device to achieve the 
capillary limit.  
 
5.5 Limit and operating temperature 
 

One should remember that the 2D-model (see chapter 4) considered 
that all heat transfer is through the wick structure. However, the high 
thermal conductivity of the evaporator case and the strong 
unidimensional heat transfer behavior observed in the wick geometry 
allows the application of a 1D model, keeping an acceptable accuracy. 
The heat leak is the result of two heat transfer paths: the case material 
and the wick plug. Figure 81 shows the heat loss through the case and 
through the wick plug. One can see that the heat transfer through the 
case is larger than the power transferred by the wick plug. The 



207 
 

 

percentage difference between these parcels decreases as the power 
input increases. The maximum heat leakage is equivalent to 3.1 % of the 
power applied. However, the 2D-model temperature fields shows that 
the temperature difference between the maximum and vapor 
temperatures is below the critical difference of temperature necessary 
for the onset of bubbles inside the wick structure, according with the 
criteria proposed by Reay and Kew (2006). 

 

Figure 81 - Heat leaks through the case and through the wick plug (case B). 
 
 The pressure drop is other important factor that determines the 
operation of a LHP. The maximum heat associated to the capillary 
capacity is called the capillary limit, as mentioned in chapter 2. This 
section analyzes the pressure drop in the wick structure. In Figure 82, 
theoretical values of pressure drop are presented as a function of the 
power load. The total pressure drop was calculated for each load power, 
considering the properties of distillate water at 60 °C. In this figure, the 
capillary limit is achieved at 120 W. 

In Figure 83, the total pressure drop in the wick structure is 
presented by three pressure drop portions. A first portion produced by 
the solid cylinder, identified in the 2D pressure model as subdomain 4-5. 
The second portion is represented by the number 6, and the third portion 
is due to the sum of all pressure drops through the liquid and vapor lines 
and condenser. From Figure 83 it can be seen that the higher pressure 



208 
 

  

drop is due to the subdomain 6, which represents 47 % of the total 
pressure drop for LHP studied. On the other hand, the pressure drop due 
to the plug and flow through the loop (condenser, liquid and vapor lines) 
are 16 and 37 % of the total pressure drop, respectively.

water (case B).

209 
 

 

Figure 84 shows a plot of the experimental vapor temperature 
corresponding to thermocouple T1 (see Figure 69) and the theoretical 
prediction obtained from 1D-model applied to the LHP studied (case B), 
against electrical power input. From this figure, one can see that the 
maximum temperature is 66.37 °C for an applied power of 15 W. After 
that, the temperature of vapor decreases gradually until a minimum 
value of 57 °C, for 70 W. According to Ku (1999), this behavior is 
called as operation under a variable conductance mode. In this power 
range, the temperature of the heat source remains constant, which is due 
to the returning liquid from condenser being subcooled enough to 
compensate the heat leak transferred form evaporation zone. 

 

 

Figure 84 - Comparison between theoretical and experimental values of the 
LHP evaporator temperature (case B). 

  
For heat transfer, larger than 80 W, the vapor temperature increases. 

However, the loop heat pipe continues operating. From this power load, 
the 1D mathematical model does not agree with the experimental data as 
well as for smaller heat loads. The smaller difference between the 
theoretical values and experimental data is 0.5 % for transfer rates less 
than 80 W, while the largest difference is of 6.63 % for heat transfer 
rates larger than 80 W. the LHP then operates in the constant 
conductance mode. From this power load, the compensation chamber 



210 
 

  

achieves its minimum temperature and the condenser is fully solicited 
by power applied. For this power, the temperature increases linearly 
with the heat load. The vapor temperature obtained using the 1D-model 
requires the inlet condensate temperature, which was taken from the 
experimental measurements of the compensation chamber, i.e., 
thermocouple T10 (see Figure 69). The condenser outlet temperature 
value predicted from the model proposed does not show variations with 
the increase of the heat input, as the inlet temperature was always 20 °C. 
Therefore, the experimental temperature outlet of condenser increased 
until the temperature of 25 °C, register by thermocouple 7 (see Figure 
72). The heat leak to the liquid line can be explicated by the increase of 
the temperature of the liquid inlet to the compensation chamber 
(thermocouple 11, see Figure 72) that is the temperature resultant of the 
heat transferred by the case and wick structure evaporator. As a result, 
the 1D model overestimated the real heat transfer capacity of the 
condenser.  

 
5.6 Condenser validation model 
 

In of chapter 4, a model to predict the temperature distribution of the 
condenser based on the analogy of electrical circuit was presented. The 
condenser was divided into two sections, the first section with length L2? 

where happens the phase change and the section with length L1? where is 
transferred the sensible heat. The thermal model of the first section is 
used to determine the condenser length necessary to reject the heat in 
the phase change. The mathematical model of the second section allows 
to calculate the fluid temperature at the outlet of the condenser and to 
determine the heat sensible transferred. In the Figure 85, the temperature 
distribution for the condenser for each power load is presented. One can 
see that the length L2? where temperature is constant corresponds to 
phase change of the fluid working. In the Figure 85, the minimal and 
maximum length L2? were 6.67 mm and 53.8 mm for a load power of 15 
and 100 W, respectively. These values represent the 2.64 % and 21.3 % 
of the length of the condenser. These results can be explained because 
the high heat transfer coefficient associated to phase change. In the 
Figure 85 again, one can see also that for a power load of 50 W at 150 
mm of length of the condenser, the temperature of the sink was 
achieved. For this power level, about of 40 % of total length becomes 
useless. Therefore, the condenser designing can be improved, reducing 
its length. 

 



211 
 

 

In Figure 86, the experimental data of temperature corresponding to 
thermocouples 3, 4, 5 and 6 (see Figure 69) and the predicted 
temperatures by condenser model are plotted. The highest difference 
between the results and theoretical values was 25 % and the smallest 
was 3 %. The experimental temperature is higher than the predicted 
value by model and this difference increases after that the applied power 
load is higher than 50 W, but in general, one can see that the theoretical 
values accomplishes the behavior of the temperatures. This difference 
between the temperatures may be reduced using the best approximation 
to welding resistance, where the heat flux found a constriction. Also, the 
thermal conductivity of welding can be modified by impurities or 
trapped gas. 

 
Figure 85 - Temperature distribution of the condenser against power 

supplied. 
 
Figure 87 presents the thermal resistance of the studied LHP (case B) 

evaluated for each power applied. This thermal resistance was evaluated 
taking into consideration of the temperature difference between 
thermocouples 1 and the average temperature between thermocouples 3, 
4, 5, 6, and 7 localized in the condenser. The curve shows that the 
thermal resistance decreases as the transferred heat power increases. The 
highest thermal resistance of 4 °C/W represents a non-operating 



212 
 

  

condition. On the other hand, the lowest thermal resistance observed 
was 0.21 °C/W. The highest difference between the experimental data 
and values predicted by the mathematical model was 0.09 °C/W that it is 
equivalent to 33 %. This thermal resistance value corresponds to power 
load of 70 W. For power higher than 50 W, the difference between the 
results and theoretical data increases. The lowest difference was of 2 %.

5.7 Working fluid inventory 
 
To determine the better working fluid filling ratio, case B of Table 

20 was tested with several different working fluid volumes: 2.4 ml, 2.5 
ml, 2.6 ml, 2.7 ml and 2.8 ml. The amount of working fluid inserted in 
the LHP is controlled using a graduated pipette with 0.05 ml of scale. 
Also, the LHP was tested for different applied heat power loads. 

Table 23 presents the volumes calculated for each section of LHP 
fabricated (see Figure 63). These values are used in Equations (2.2) and 
(2.3) to calculate the filling ratio and the compensation chamber size 
(KU, 1999). The increase of temperature of LHP in the startup can be 
due to decrease of volume of compensation chamber. 

 
Table 23. Volume of the components of LHP.

Evaporator vapor channel  1.09 ml 
Vapor line 0.17 ml 
Liquid line 0.32 ml 
Condenser  0.52 ml 
Compensation chamber 3.04 ml 

 
Figure 88, Figure 89 and Figure 90 show plots of temperature (left 

vertical axis) and electrical power input (right vertical axis) as a function 
of time, for the same LHP, operating with different volumes of the 
working fluid (2.4, 2.6 and 2.8 ml at 25 °C, respectively). In Figure 88, 
one can see that the startup was reached after the application of 30 W, 
reaching a temperature of 65 °C, as indicated by thermocouple T1 and 
T2. The comparison of the performance for three filling volumes show 
that, for an increase of 8.3 % in the working fluid, it is observed an 
increase in the operation temperature by 15.4 %.  

The maximum startup temperature was 77 °C for the LHP operating 
with a working fluid inventory of 2.8 ml. The experimental results of the 
Figure 88, Figure 89 and Figure 90 show an increase in the evaporator 
temperature when fluid inventory is increased. About 5 °C was 
augmented the evaporator temperature during the startup, for 0.2 ml that 
equivalent to 8.3 % of increase in the fluid inventory.

Figure 91 shows the inventory working fluid volume (in y-axis) 

against the experimental parameters ? (fraction of the compensation 
chamber occupied by vapor) used as input parameters in the equations 
2.2 (according to Ku, (1999)) for the determination of the mass of 
working fluid. These relations should be evaluated in two operation 
conditions: hot and cool condition. In Figure 91, the inventory working 
fluid is evaluated for 60 °C, for hot operation conditions. In the Figure 
91 again, the inventory volume of working fluid that present the lowest 
vapor temperature is also plotted. For this inventory volume, where the 
LHP presented the best behavior, corresponds to a value of the 
experimental coefficient ? = 0.8 for the hot condition (see equation 
(2.2)). On the other hand, this inventory of working fluid is also 
equivalent to 30% above of the LHP occupied by liquid volume, i.e. 
volume of porous wick structure plus liquid line. According to Paiva 
(2011) and Peterson (1994b), for HP, the fluid work inventory is 
approximately 10 to 20 % larger than the volume of HP that should be 
occupied by liquid.

5.8 Conclusions 
 
 An equation to determine a design criterion for the evaporation zone 
geometry was proposed and evaluate experimentally. LHP’s were tested 
using methanol and water as working fluids and different geometries 
satisfy and unperformed critical criteria. Using the 2D-model, an 
analysis of the of thermal response to variations of the geometry 
parameters ? and ?, regarding the temperature distribution and the heat 
leak inside the wick structure for the evaporator of the LHP was 
development. As result of this analysis, one can see that the proposed 
geometry presents low heat leakage and that the temperature gradient is 
high in the radial direction of the evaporation zone. Therefore, the wick 
geometry according to the case of study was modeled using a 1D 
approach. The experimental operation of the LHP was compared to the 
predicted temperature by the proposed 1D model showed good 
agreement. An experimental test to determine the inventory of working 
fluid was developed and the experimental parameter was determined 
and compared with other ones proposed in the literature.

6 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE 
WORK 

 
In this work, several models for the prediction of the temperature and 

pressure distribution of the wick structure porous media, for a 
cylindrical shape LHP evaporator, was developed. The wick structure 
evaporator study in this thesis is composed by an active zone of 
evaporation, i.e. a hollow cylinder where heat from the heat source is 
transferred to surface of evaporation (meniscus) and another solid 
cylinder that separate the compensation chamber for evaporation zone. 

For the thermal model, two approaches were applied for 
development of the mathematical model: two-dimensional (2D) and one 
dimensional (1D), while the pressure model only was approach for two-
dimensional (2D). The thermal and pressure 2D model coupled allows 
the determination of the geometry parameters that guarantees the correct 
performance of the evaporator, i.e., no vapor bubble formation within 
the porous media. Therefore, the 2D model is a useful tool for the design 
of the evaporator wick structure of LHP, able to provide a safe operation 
mode. However, the thermal 2D model does not take into account the 
heat loss from the evaporator wall, but only through the wick plug. 
Therefore, based on the 2D results which shows a very close to a one 
dimensional behavior, a 1D model was developed. Although very 
simple, this model, which makes use of the analogy between thermal 
and electrical circuit, allows for accounting the heat transfer losses from 
the evaporator to the compensation chamber, and so, to predict the 
actual thermal behavior of the evaporator. The analogy between thermal 
and electrical circuit was also used to determine the temperature 
distribution along the LHP condenser. Pressure drop models to single 
and two phase fluid were also used in liquid and vapor lines and 
condenser. 

The temperature and pressure fields show that the interface between 
the solid and hollow cylinder is the critical region to both heat and mass 
transfer. However, when the heat load is increased, temperatures higher 
than the critical ones in these regions can be reached forming vapor and 
reducing the transversal area heat transfer and increasing the pressure 
drop inside of wick structure evaporator. The procedure to evaluate the 
formation of bubble inside of wick structure was shown, the temperature 
and pressure were evaluated for a point, and it was compared with one 
boiling criteria to determine the formation of bobbles inside of wick 
structure.

Another theoretical expression for the critical parameter, which 
relates the thermodynamic properties of the working fluid with the 
thermophysical properties of the porous media, is proposed for the 
determination of the wick thickness of the LHP evaporator. LHP 
evaporator were designed and fabricated to evaluate the theoretical 
criterion. The LHP evaporator project to operate with methanol as 
working fluid attended the criteria ratio ?/l operating normally. The 
same LHP was tested with distillated water as working fluid without 
attend the critical criterion do not work. However, a second design of 
wick structure evaporator project to operate with water allowed to show 
that the equation proposed can be used as tool for design of wick LHP 
evaporator.  

To design a wick sintered porous media, with desirable parameters 
(porosity, permeability, effective porous radio and effective thermal 
conductivity), models, where the input parameter is the mean particle 
diameter, were proposed. The sintering process was described using 
literature models. Experimental apparatus was developed to measure the 
thermophysical properties and the obtained data were compared with 
theoretical values, showing a good comparison.  

A statistical analysis to determine the main effect of the geometrical 
parameters and effective thermal conductivity on the thermal response 
of a wick structure geometry proposed in this thesis was made. Two 
types of powders were selected to produce four different porous 
materials with different designs, resulting from the combination of the 
ratios between the parameters: ?/l and ?/l. Where ? is the thickness of 
the wick structure in the active zone of evaporation, ? is the length of 
bottom wick structure that separates the compensation chamber of 
evaporation zone and l is the length of the active zone of evaporation. 
ANOVA method was applied and, for a significance level of 95 %, the 
analyses showed that the parameters: effective thermal conductivity and 
ratio ?/l, in the range ?/l crit &amp;lt;?/l &amp;lt;1.2 ?/l, have significant effects over 
the thermal response (temperature and heat leakage) of the evaporator 
wick.  

Experimental tests with a LHP operating with different fluid 
inventory showed that best mass fluid inventory is related with others 
proposed in literature for HP. The experimental factor used to determine 
the inventory fluid base and the compensation chamber dimensions was 
also determined.

Future Works 
 

From the analyses presented in this thesis, the following future 
works are proposed: 

 
• To analyze the thermal and pressure criteria based on the 

powder diameter for the onset of vapor formation at the 
interface of coupling of the domains 2 and 3. The literature 
criteria to evaluate the bubble formation in sintered porous 
media are correlations that use parameters with a wide 
range. 

 
• To determine the optimal geometry parameters based on the 

2D and 1D models proposed in this work. The entropy 
generation approach can be used as the objective function in 
an optimization process. The present study provides the 
temperature and pressure drop to determine the optimal 
geometry. 

 
• To develop a 2D model for the heat and mass transfer in the 

transient regime. The start up in the loop heat pipe becomes 
difficult for low power. A transient modeling can be 
obtained from the present work, adding the transient term of 
the energy conservation equation. 

 
• To study the thermophysical properties for several 

combinations of powder materials with two different 
average particle diameters. In this work the equation 
development for thermophysical properties of sintered 
porous media was based on the average particle diameter. 
Other system considering the mixture of two particle 
diameters can be tested, in order to improve its properties. 

 
• To conduct an analytical and/or numerical study of a porous 

media with two layers with different geometries (porosity 
permeability, etc.) and effective thermal conductivities. The 
results should be compared with data resulting from an 
experimental study.

APPENDIX A. MEASUREMENT UNCERTAINTIES 
 

The measurement result is composed by a base result and an 
uncertainty. The  measurement uncertainties were determined according 
to INMETRO (2012). The uncertainties are classified as standard 
uncertainties type A and standard uncertainties type B. The standard 
uncertainties of type A are the uncertainties calculated from a group of 
observations or replications of the measurements. The standard 
uncertainties of type B are not obtained from observations replicated. 
They are based on the available information about the variables 
measured such as, previous measurements, the manufacturer's 
specifications or data supplied in calibration certificates. In this work, 
for all variables measured, standard uncertainty type B was considered, 
using the information available from the equipment manuals. 

The standard uncertainty type B of a variable x, uB(x), is estimated 
considering the equipment measurement chain. For its calculation, all 
sources of uncertainty ui(x) involved in the measurement chain 
(repeatability, equipment resolution, acquisition system, etc.) were 
combined as shown in Equation (A.1).  

x3C ??? ? xPC??? ? xCC??? ? ? ? x?C ??? (A.1) 
The equation above was used for directly measured variables, such 

as the temperature. When the variables were indirectly measured from 
other parameters, such as heat flux, the combined standard uncertainty 
was obtained through the following equation: 

x
C??? ? ¨ &amp;lt;|?|?? @
CF

? ªP xC??? ? (A.2)  
where f represents the variable under interest, defined as a function of 
the variables xi and u(xi) are the standard uncertainties of each variable 
xi. 

The combined uncertainty of each variable must be multiplied by a 
coverage factor kp (corresponding to t-Student coefficient) in order to 
obtain the expanded uncertainty U. The expanded uncertainty is the 
interval where, for a defined probability, one expects to find the aleatory 
error component of the measurement process. The coverage factor kp is 
an expansion interval of the combined uncertainty, corresponding with 
the level of probability of the t-Student distribution. 



228 
 

  

In this thesis, a confidence interval of 95.45 % was used for the 
calculation of the expanded uncertainty, obtained from the following 
equation: þ??? ? 2? x
 ??? (A.3) 

The coverage factor kp depends on the number of degrees freedom 
resultant from the combined standard uncertainty. In this work, the 
standard uncertainty type B of the different variables was considered 
with infinity degrees freedom. Therefore, for a t-Student distribution 
with confidence interval of 95.45 % and infinity degrees freedom, the 
coverage factor is kp = 2. This value was considered for the calculation 
of the expanded uncertainty of all the variables tested. 

The specified information about the uncertainty calculated for each 
variable tested is presented in the following sections.  
 
A.1. Uncertainty of the temperature  
 

The temperature measurement chain is composed by a Type T 
(copper-constantan) thermocouple with 0.07 mm diameter connected to 
a data acquisition system and an extension wire that sends the signal 
from the data acquisition system to a computer. The temperature 
readings are processed by LabVIEW 8.6. The summary of the 
uncertainties involved in the measurement of the temperature is 
presented in the Table A.1

A.2 Uncertainty of the length  
 

The uncertain associated to the measurement of the samples length, 
when calculating properties such as permeability and effective thermal 
conductivity were calculated from the caliper uncertainty. According to 
the manufacturer, the resolution is 0.01 mm. The uncertainty associated 
to the temperature variations was also calculated, considering an 
expansion coefficient for stainless steel ? = 11.5 µ m/m· K at 20 ± 10 °C.

A.3 Uncertainty of the mass  
 

The uncertainty of mass measurement was calculated from the 
weighing scale uncertainty. According to the manufacturer, the 
resolution is 0.1 g. A rectangular distribution was considered for the 
uncertainly of the resolution.  The uncertainly of the repeatability was 
calculated for 15 measures. The summary of the uncertainty calculated 
is presented in the Table A.3.

A.4 Uncertainty of the pressure  

 
For the permeability measurements, a digital manometer Zürich-

Z10B was used. The uncertainty of the pressure measurements was 
calculated from the resolution of the display: 100 Pa. A pressure sensor 
(Omega PX409-015DWUV) was used to measure the gas pressure for 
the measurements of effective porous radius. The uncertainty calculated 
for this equipment was 210 Pa.

A.5 Uncertainty of the effective thermal conductivity  
 

The effective thermal conductivity is calculated from other 
physical quantities, such as temperature, heat flux, cross area and length. 
Therefore, in order to determine the combined standard uncertainly of 
the effective thermal conductivity, the following equation was 
employed:

standard uncertainty for each quantity measured, i.e., heat flux, 
temperature, length and cross area of the sample, respectively. The 
following equation was presented by Florez et al. (2013) to determine 
the effective thermal conductivity from the comparative method.

The term within parentheses in the equation above is assumed as 

constant and negligible for the uncertainty. The combined uncertainty 
for the temperature and the length are shown in the Tables A.1 and A.2, 
respectively. The heat flux uncertainty was calculated from difference 
between the maximum heat flux measurement in the heat flux meter and 
the average heat flux.  

The cross area of the sample is calculated from the following 
equation: 

\E ?  
G (A.9) 
where W and H are the dimensions used to calculate the cross area of the 
sample. By calculating the partial derivate of Equation (A.9) and 
substituting into Equation (A.2), one obtains the following equation to 
determine the combined uncertainty of the cross area.

In relation to the measurement made by the thermal conductivity 
analyzer C-thermal Tci, the manufacturer reports 5 % of the 
experimental value as uncertainty of the effective thermal conductivity.
