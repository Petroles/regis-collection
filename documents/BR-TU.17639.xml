resumo 
 

 

Pós de titanato zirconato de chumbo, com um tamanho de partícula de 
aproximadamente 300 nm, foram usados como material base para a 
deposição electroforética (EPD) de filmes espessos de PZT em substratos 
flexíveis de cobre. Foram preparadas, modificadas e aperfeiçoadas várias 
suspensões a fim de optimizar a etapa de deposição. Para diminuir a 
temperatura de sinterização dos filmes espessos, de forma a tornar a sua 
utilização compatível com o uso de substratos de cobre, recorreu-se à 
utilização de diferentes aditivos de sinterização, nomeadamente um vidro 
composto por SiO2, PbO, Al2O3, B2O3 e uma mistura de dois óxidos (B2O3 e 
PbO). Foram então depositados por EPD filmes de PZT sobre folhas de cobre 
em presença destes aditivos de sinterização; primeiramente com a adição de 
5, 10 e 20 % em peso de vidro e, posteriormente, com a adição de 1 e 3 % em 
peso de uma mistura de diferentes proporções dos óxidos B2O3 e PbO (90/10, 
80/20 e 50/50) e os filmes foram sinterizados a diferentes temperaturas, entre 
800ºC e 900ºC e em atmosfera de baixa pressão parcial de oxigénio (pO2) (~ 
5x10

-5
 e 8x10

-7
 atm). Verificou-se que a deposição em presença de pós de 

vidro origina filmes não uniformes, com superfícies irregulares e 
microestruturas porosas, o que se deve à dificuldade em obter suspensões 
desfloculadas e estáveis. A resposta dieléctrica dos vários filmes espessos de 
PZT sobre cobre foi analisada em função da frequência à temperatura 
ambiente. Verificou-se que a presença dos óxidos aditivos de sinterização 
melhorou a densificação dos filmes. A adição da mistura de 3 % em peso de 
50%B2O3 + 50%PbO originou a melhor resposta dieléctrica de filmes 
sinterizados a 800 ºC e 850ºC (permitividade de ~1195 e perda dieléctrica 
de~0,02). Os resultados obtidos foram comparados com os da adição de uma 
mistura de V2O3 e PbO, previamente reportados. Foi então demonstrado que 
os filmes espessos de PZT aditivados com misturas de B2O3 e PbO e 
fabricados por deposição electroforética em substratos de cobre flexíveis são 
passíveis de serem usados como condensadores embutidos em circuitos da 
microelectrónica.

abstract 

 
 
Powders of lead zirconate titanate with a particle size of about 300 nm, were 
used as base material for the electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of PZT thick 
films on flexible copper substrates. With these powders, several 
suspensions were prepared, modified and improved in order to optimize the 
deposition step. To lower the sintering temperature of thick films to make its 
employment consistent with the use of copper substrates, different sintering 
additives, including a glass comprising of SiO2, PbO, Al2O3, and B2O3 and a 
mixture of two oxides (PbO and B2O3) were studied. Films were then 
deposited by EPD of PZT films on copper sheets in the presence of 
sintering additives, first with the addition of 5, 10 and 20% by weight of glass 
and, later, with the addition of 1 and 3% by weight of a mixture of PbO and 
B2O3 (90/10, 80/20 and 50/50) and the films were sintered at different 
temperatures between 800 º C and 900 º C in an atmosphere of low oxygen 
partial pressure (pO2) (~ 5x10

-5
 and 8x10

-7
 atm). It was found that the 

deposition in the presence of glass powder causes non-uniform films with 
rough surfaces and porous microstructures, which is due to the difficulty in 
obtaining deflocculated and stable suspensions. The dielectric response of 
the various PZT thick films on copper was examined as a function of 
frequency at room temperature. It was found that the presence of oxide 
sintering additives improved the densification of the films. The addition of 
mixing 3wt% of 50% B2O3 + 50% PbO led to an optimized dielectric 
response for the films sintered at 800 º C and 850 º C (permittivity ~1195 
and losses ~0.02). The results were compared with PZT films prepared with 
the addition of a mixture of PbO and V2O3, previously reported. In 
conclusion, PZT thick films manufactured by EPD on copper flexible 
substrates and sintered in the presence of PbO and B2O3 (as sintering aid 
mixtures) can be used as embedded capacitors in microelectronic circuits.

1. Introduction 

Lead zirconate titanate, PbZr1-xTixO3 (PZT) has a perovskite type structure. This structure 

is adopted by many functional oxides that have the chemical formula ABO3 and several of them 

exhibit important and useful technological properties such as ferroelectricity, pyroelectricity, 

piezoelectricity, non linear optical behaviour, inter alia, that make them very useful in 

applications such as catalysts, sensors, actuators, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), 

nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS), memories, superconductors, etc.[1],[2], [7],  

In PZT, Ti4+ and Zr4+ ions occupy randomly B sites of the perovskite lattice. At high 

temperatures PZT has the cubic perovskite structure, which is paraelectric. On cooling below 

the Curie point, the structure undergoes a phase transition to form a ferroelectric tetragonal or 

rhombohedral phase. In the tetragonal phase, the spontaneous polarization is along the&amp;lt;100&gt; 

set of directions while in the rhombohedral phase the polarization is along the&amp;lt;111&gt; set of 

directions. Below the Zr/Ti ratio of 95/5 the solid solution is antiferroelectric with an 

orthorhombic phase. On the application of an electric field to this composition a double 

hysteresis loop is obtained. This is because of the strong influence of the antiferroelectric 

PbZrO3 (Lead Zirconate) phase.

1.1 Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT): General Aspects  

The solid solution between PbZrO3 and PbTiO3 (Lead Titanate), well known as PZT, is 

important for electronic applications due to the peculiar electric properties displayed by some of 

the compositions, namely those within the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB), 

PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3. MPB compositions have mixed crystallographic symmetries and therefore are 

easily poled in the polycrystalline form and the electromechanical properties are maximised. 

Above the ferroelectric phase transition Tc (being the Curie temperature) at &gt;350ºC for the x = 

0.48 MPB composition, PZT is in the paraelectric phase, with a Pm3m cubic centrosymmetric 

space group. Below Tc, a mixture of ferroelectric rhombohedral and tetragonal phases exists 

and the high dielectric permittivity (?r ~1000), high remanent polarization value (Pr ~30 µC/cm
2), 

and high piezoelectric coefficients (d33 ~ 350 pC/N) make it useful in a wide range of 

applications.[4]  

Figure 1 depicts the perovskite-type PZT unit cell above the Curie temperature and its 

distorted unit cell below the Curie temperature. 

 

 

 

 
 

Figure 1: Perovskite lead zirconate titanate (PZT) unit cell in the symmetric cubic state, 

above the Curie temperature (left picture), and tetragonally distorced below the Curie 

temperature (right picture).[5] 

 

 

PZT MPB compositions exhibit anomalously augmented dielectric and piezoelectric 

properties as a result of the enhanced polarizability arising from the coupling between two 

equivalent energy states, i.e., tetragonal and rhombohedraI phases, allowing optimum domain 

reorientation during the poling process.[5] These properties make PZT-based compounds one of 



 

the most prominent and useful electroceramics

PZT ceramics are almost always used with dopants, modifiers, or other chemical 

constituent to improve and optimize their basic properties for specific applications. Examples of 

these additives include aliovalent donors, such as Nb5+ replacing Zr4+ or La3+ replacing Pb2+, to 

increase the electrical resistivity of PZT by at least three orders of magnitude. These additives 

(and vacancies) enhance for example domain reorientation; ceramics produced with some of 

these additives are characterized by square hysteresis loops, low coercive fields, high remanent 

polarization, high dielectric constants, maximum coupling factors, high dielectric loss, high 

mechanical compliance and reduced aging.[12] 

Dopants are usually added in concentrations of ? 3 at%. Modifiers are substituted into 

the original PZT composition as solid-solution constituents in concentrations ? 5 at%. The most 

common examples of modified PZT systems are (Pb,La), (Zr,Ti)O3, (Pb,Sr)(Zr,Ti)O3, 

(Pb,Ba)(Zr,Ti)O3, Pb-(Zr,Ti,Sn)O3, (Pb,La)TiO3, and Pb(Mg,Nb)O3–PbZrO3–PbTiO3, among 

others solid-solution systems.[12]

1.2 Perovskite Crystal Structure  

The perovskite crystal structure (ABO3) is perhaps one of the most common in nature 

and one of the most important structures behind ferroelectricity.[13]  

The structure of ABO3 perovskite can be described in terms of a close packing of AO3 

layers, where the B-site cations occupy 100% of the resultant BO6 oxygen octahedra. When the 

AO3 layers are arranged in cubic close packing, the BO6 octahedra are connected exclusively 

through corner sharing, and the structure is termed a cubic perovskite (Figure 2).  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 3: Prototypical perovskite unit cell (ideal cubic perovskite).[13] 

 

 

 

In an ideal cubic perovskite, the A and B cations establish their equilibrium bond 

distances to oxygen without inducing any distortion of the unit cell, and dA-O = ?2(dB-O). The 

resultant cubic symmetry is Pmm and the so-called Goldschmidt tolerance factor describes the 

perovskite lattice distortion and is defined as: 

 

(1) 

 

where RA, RB, and RO stand for the ionic radii of the A-site, B-site, and anion ions respectively. 
 

 As mentioned above this is the structure assumed by PZT, with a B-cation in the center 

of the cube (light blue ions in Figure 3), oxygen ions at the face centres of the cube (red ions in

a extensive disorder in the direction of the B-cation distortions within their oxygen octahedral 

can take place. There is also disorder in the direction of the displacements of both lead and 

oxygen ions away from their perfect perovskite positions. It is this local disorder within the 

framework of the orderly perovskite lattice that gives PZT its interesting properties.[14]

1.3 Dielectric, Piezoelectricity and Ferroelectricity of Ceramic Materials  

The group of functional materials (related to materials whose “function” is associated with 

their electric, magnetic, and or optical properties) mainly includes dielectrics, pyroelectrics, 

piezoelectrics, ferroelectrics, ferroelectric relaxors, incipient ferroelectrics, semiconductors, ionic 

conductors, superconductors, electro-optics and magnetic materials. It is common to identify the 

class of functional materials with applications such as Materials for Information Technology, 

Materials for Electrical Energy Conversion, Materials for Biologic Applications, Materials for 

Space Technology, among others. The application of functional materials, typified by 

electroactive materials including piezoelectrics, pyroelectrics and ferroelectrics, for sensing and 

actuation spans over most if not all industrial sectors.[15] 

 

 1.3.1 Dielectric Properties 

When an electric field E is applied to an ideal insulator there is no long-range charge 

transport. In an insulator there is only a short-range dislocation of the positive and negative 

charge centre, which causes electric dipole moments in the material. The material is called a 

dielectric. The effect of the electrical field can be twofold defined: 

1. The electric field induces electrical dipoles and aligns them in the field direction. In 

other words, the material does not contain electric dipoles without the electric field. 

2. The electric field aligns electrical dipoles that are already present in the material. In 

other words, the material contains spontaneous electric dipoles. In this case the dipoles are 

randomly oriented and for zero fields the net polarization is null. 

Figure 4 depicts the dielectric response of a regular dielectric material under the electric 

field.[16]

Figure 4: Dielectric constant dependence on the electric bias field.[Adapted from reference 23] 

 

The total effect of an electric field on a dielectric material is called polarization (expressed 

in µC/cm²). Several polarization mechanisms can be identified within a material: atomic, ionic, 

dipolar and space charge; being each related to the nature of the charged entities, which suffer 

charge displacement, or to the nature of the displacement. 

Dielectrics are insulators with high dielectric permittivity. Dielectric permittivity or 

dielectric constant is defined as the capacity of a material to store electrical charge and it gives 

rise to the simplest practical application of a dielectric material such as a capacitor.[16] 

The permittivity of a material is commonly measured as a change in dielectric 

displacement, D, with applied field, E, as shown in Equation 2.  

 

 

 

(2) [13] 

 

  

where ? ?r stands for the relative permittivity, D for the dielectric displacement and E for the 

applied field. The dielectric displacement in turn establishes the relationship between 

polarization and permittivity, as in Equation 3 and results in permittivity being essentially the 

change in polarization with applied field as in Equation 4.

where? P stands for the polarization. This holds particularly true near the ferroelectric phase 

transition where the change in polarization with field is much larger than unity and dominates 

the relation.  

The several polarization responses of the dielectric under an electric field are being 

increasingly used in micro and nanoelectronic devices.[13] The various polarization mechanisms 

contributing to permittivity, described in Figure 5, are: i) electronic polarization, ?e, defined as 

the shifting and/or stretching of the electron distribution around the nucleus; ii) ionic 

polarizations, ?I identified by the shifting of oppositely charged ions from their equilibrium 

position by an applied field; iii) dipole polarizations, ?d, which takes into account the rotation of 

internal dipole moments to align with an applied force; and iv) space charge polarizations ?s.c., 

related to the movement of charged internal defects with applied force. The sum of these 

polarization mechanisms gives the total change in polarization and thus the total contribution to 

permittivity. These contributions are generally frequency dependent, revealing a dispersive 

behaviour, with all polarizations mechanisms active at low frequencies and only electronic 

polarizations active at high frequencies.[13]  

  

Figure 5: Frequency dispersion of a dielectric showing all possible polarization 

mechanisms and the expected frequencies for their inactivation.[16] 

 

As each polarization mechanism reaches its frequency limit, subsequent increase in loss 

is observed. This loss increase can be attributed to a dissipation of heat energy by friction of the 

space charges and dipoles as they move under the applied field.[13] Electronic and ionic

polarizations show loss peaks over much finer frequency ranges than space charge and dipole 

polarizations. The peaks here are not so strongly related to internal friction, but are due to 

resonance of the bound electrons to the nuclear cores by high frequency electromagnetic 

radiation.[13]  

There is an intimate relationship between loss and the permittivity of a material. If the 

relative permittivity is expressed as a complex function, Equation 5, one may identify two main 

components to the permittivity: the real part, ?', and the imaginary part, ?'': 

 
(5) 

 

The loss in the material can then be expressed in terms of a phase angle between the 

polarizing field and the response of the material commonly called the dissipation factor or loss 

tangent delta (Equation 6) 

 

 

(6) 

 

                     

where ? stands for the phase angle of impedance as shown in Figure 6. For perfect insulators 

the phase angle is 90°, while for perfect conductors the phase angle is 0°. Real materials have 

values intermediate between the two extremes.[13]

1.3.2 Piezoelectric and Ferroelectric Properties 

In piezoelectric materials there is a coupling between electrical and mechanical energies 

and mechanical energy can be converted in electrical energy and vice-versa. [17] The direct 

effect (designated as a generator) is identified with the phenomenon whereby electrical charges 

(polarization) are generated from a mechanical stress (first part of Figure 7, designated as 

piezoelectric effect), whereas the converse effect (designated as a motor) is associated with the 

mechanical movement generated by the application of an electrical field (second part of Figure 

7 and designated as reverse piezoelectric effect).[12]  

The direct piezoelectric effect was originally discovered in 1880 by Jacques and Pierre 

Curie. Piezoelectrics did not come into widespread use until the First World War, when quartz 

was used in SONAR (Sound Navigation and Ranging). Quartz was replaced in the Second 

World War by Barium Titanate, and this has become one of the most important piezoelectric 

materials of the modern era. They are both now commonly used in many ways.[6] 

Ferroelectrics are polar dielectrics for which the dipole moment can be switched between 

two or more equilibrium symmetry equivalent states by the application of an appropriate electric 

field.[17] 

Of the 32 point groups of the crystal structures, 20 can be characterized as piezoelectric, 

that is, upon the application of a mechanical stress, an electronic displacement can be induced 

in the crystal. Equivalently, an applied electric field can induce a mechanical strain, a property 

known as the converse piezoelectric effect. The 20 point groups, which can support 

piezoelectricity, are non-centrosymetric. While the lack of a centre of symmetry is a necessary 

condition for piezoelectricity, it is not sufficient to observe a piezoelectric effect.[13] 

Further categorization of the piezoelectric point groups reveals that in ten out of the 

twenty, the electronic polarization is spontaneous, remaining finite in the absence of an applied 

stress or electric field. This spontaneous polarization is characteristic of pyroelectricity and is a 

consequence of the atomic arrangement within the unit cell where the positive and negative 

charge centres is not coincident, thus establishing a resultant spontaneous electric dipole.[13] 

Under an electric field, ions undergo asymmetric displacement and results in a small 

change in the crystal dimension, which is proportional to the applied field. Such electric field - 

induced strain (or piezoelectricity) has found extensive applications in actuators and sensors.[17]

The knowledge of the ferroelectric nature of ceramic BaTiO3 proved to be very useful 

when it was discovered by Gray (in 1945) that an external electric field could orient the domains 

within the grains, thus producing a ceramic material that acted very similar to a single crystal 

possessing both ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties. This electrical aligning, or “poling” 

process as it has come to be called, was thus correctly identified as the key to turning an inert 

ceramic into an electromechanically active material with a multitude of industrial and 

commercial uses.[12]  

With poling the ceramic becomes extremely useful, provided however that it is not heated 

above its Curie temperature (TC), where it loses its polarization and all of the orientation of the 

polarization produced by the poling process.

Figure 7: Piezoelectric effect and reverse piezoelectric effect.[Adapted from reference 9]  

 

All ferroelectric materials are pyroelectric, however, not all pyroelectric materials are 

ferroelectric. Below the transition temperature (Curie temperature, Tc) ferroelectric and 

pyroelectric materials are polar and have a spontaneous polarization or electric dipole moment. 

For ferroelectric materials this polarity can be fully, in part reoriented or reversed through the 

application of an electric field. Complete reversal of the spontaneous polarization is called 

“switching”.[13] 

The reverse polarization can be observed by measuring the ferroelectric hysteresis as it 

is shown in Figure 8. As the electric field strength is increased, the polar domains start to align 

in the positive direction giving rise to a rapid increase in the polarization (OB). At very high field 

levels, the polarization reaches a saturation value.[3]

Figure 8: Polarization versus electric field (P-E) hysteresis loop for a typical ferroelectric 

crystal.[3] 

 
The polarization does not fall to zero when the external field is removed. At zero external 

fields, some of the domains remain aligned in the positive direction; hence the crystal will show 

a remnant polarization (Pr). The crystal cannot be completely depolarized until a field of 

magnitude OF is applied in the negative direction. The external field needed to reduce the 

polarization to zero is called the coercive field (Ec). If the field is increased to a more negative 

value, the direction of polarization flips and hence a hysteresis loop is obtained. The value of 

the spontaneous polarization (Ps) (OE) is obtained by extrapolating the curve onto the 

polarization axes (CE).[3] 

The relative dielectric constant, in equation 8, increases as the temperature approaches 

the Curie point. In this region the dielectric constant is most sensitive to the magnitude of the 

applied electric field. Above Tc, permittivity decreases with temperature and often exhibits Curie-

Weiss behaviour. This is shown in Equation 8, 

 
(8) 

where C stands for the Curie constant. In the paraelectric regime, the spontaneous polarization 

is zero but the permittivity remains high. This effect is illustrated in the following figure (Figure 

9).[13], [16]

1.4 The Importance of Piezoelectrics and Ferroelectrics 

 

1.4.1 General Applications of Piezoelectrics and Ferroelectrics  

Due to the peculiar electrical properties of piezo -, piro - and ferroelectrics, that include 

high dielectric permittivity, high piezo and pyroelectric coefficients, in some cases low dielectric 

losses, high tunability of the permittivity with the electrical field, hysteretic response of the 

polarization, these materials find applications in a wide variety of electronic and microelectronic 

applications (as stated before), as indicated in Figure 10. These applications range from 

sensors and actuators, to electro optic based devices, having a particular relevance as 

dielectrics for capacitors and memories applications that per se cover utilization areas from 

telecommunications, electronics and engineering to healthcare. Some applications of 

piezoelectric ceramics are: medical ultrasound transducers, gas igniters, displacement 

transducers, piezoelectric transformers and impact printer heads.[3]  

Specific applications for ferroelectric ceramics are in capacitors, explosive-to-electrical 

transducers (EETs)[12], pyroelectric detectors and surface acoustic wave substrates[3], high 

dielectric constant capacitors, infrared detectors, piezoelectric transducers, optical modulators, 

optical waveguides, non-volatile memory chips and capacitors for dynamic random access 

memories (DRAM). Therefore they can be used to transform acoustic waves to electrical signal 

in sonar detectors and to convert electric field into motion in actuators and mechanical scanners 

requiring fine control. In a broader sense, ferroelectric materials can be used for pyroelectric 

and piezoelectric sensors (as mentioned before), voltage tunable capacitors, infrared detectors, 

surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices, microactuators, and nonvolatile random-access 

memories (NVRAMs), including the potential production of one transistor memory cells, and 

applications requiring nonlinear optic components. Another set of potential applications seeks to 

exploit the ferroelastic properties in stacked templates where they are justaposed to 

ferromagnetic materials.[3], [12], [18] 

Some of these applications are more appropriate for bulk materials and others for films 

and some for both bulk and films, as indicated in Figure 10. Similar to most materials, the 

successful application of these piezoelectric, pyroelectric, ferroelectric, electrostrictive, and 

electro optic ceramics and films is highly dependent on the relative ease of adaptation to useful 

and reliable devices. This is, to a great extent, the reason why they have been so successful 

over the years in finding an increasing number of applications. Their simplicity, compact size, 

low cost, and high reliability are very attractive features to the design engineer and have 

guaranteed a continuous increase of their applications.

1.4.2 Applications for PZT Materials 

Piezoelectrics based on PZT show the broadest range of individual applications ranging 

from applications on health-care, consumer electronics and environment monitoring,[3], [19] as 

microsensors and actuators for medical, military, telecommunication, environmental, vehicle 

and office automation industries (once again similarity as ferro- and piezoelectric 

applications).[3], [21]. PZT-based compounds are primarily used in the manufacturing of 

ultrasound transducers. A secondary use is in the manufacturing of ceramic capacitors and 

microelectronic chips. PZT films have been widely investigated for applications in non-volatile 

random access memories (NVRAMs) (similar with piezoelectrics and ferroelectrics 

applications), as well field effect transistors (FETs), ultrasonic vibrators, filters, microactuators 

and microsensors, dielectric capacitors; IR sensors, buffer layers, integrated optics, electro optic 

shutters, AR coatings and electrooptic displays.[15] 

Due to its lead content and to the environmental restrictions associated with its use, there 

is the need to find alternative materials to PZT. There are currently several R&amp;amp;D (Research and 

Development) programs for the search of lead free alternatives to PZT, but until now none of 

the barium titanate (BaTiO3), sodium potassium niobate ((Na0.5K0.5)NbO3) and or sodium 

bismuth titanate ((Bi1/2Na1/2)TiO3) based compositions demonstrate similar properties to the 

ones of PZT.[4] The so far reported properties for these several alternative materials are 

considerably inferior (as one can witness from table 2). This is the reason why PZT is still the 

most important piezoelectric material and is still considered, even for modern applications such 

as composite structures with multiferroics. 15]

1.5 Fabrication of Piezoelectric and Ferroelectric Films 

 

1.5.1 Bulk versus Films and Thin versus Thick Films 

The current trend in microelectronics industry is towards device miniaturization, 

increased functionalization and greater reliability with low processing costs. Films respond 

better to these requirements than their bulk counterparts.  

Thin films normally refer to layers with thickness below ~1µm and thick films above this 

range. However, the prime difference lies in the manufacturing process of the films.[21]. Thin and 

thick films of dielectric materials are being considered to replace the dielectric components 

presently in use in the form of bulk ceramics. This has been the driving force for the search for 

fabrication processes for mass-produced dielectric films with repeatable performance at low 

costs.[15]  

For some of the applications (communication industry, resonators, filters and antennas), 

thick films are required, rather than thin films, as these are volume devices that store 

electromagnetic energy within the dielectric volume. Furthermore, the ability to process thick 

films conformably on substrates, and also directly on metallic foils, opens up the possibility of 

innovative structures and designs.[12] However, for thick films the required high sintering 

temperatures present a challenge for processing on base metal substrates.[3]  

The techniques employed to prepare films are considerably different form the techniques 

used to prepared bulk ceramics and several techniques for making films are presently available. 

These can be divided into two main categories: physical deposition techniques, such as 

physical vapour deposition (PVD), and chemical techniques, which include chemical vapour 

deposition (CVD) and chemical solution deposition (CSD).[3] For the case of physical methods, 

the way the particles (atoms or ions) are removed from the target results in various deposition 

methods, such as radio frequency sputtering, ion beam sputtering, evaporation, electron beam 

and laser ablation, among others.[21], [22]  

Advantages of PVD techniques include: dry processing, high levels of purity, the 

possibility of growing epitaxial films, and compatibility with the processing of semiconductor 

integrated circuits. Nevertheless, the difficulty in controlling the stoichiometry of multicomponent 

films, the slow rates of deposition, the need to high-temperature deposition annealing 

crystallization and the high costs to purchase equipment and maintenance are the main 

disadvantages of these methods for the preparation of functional coatings.[21] 

The second group of technical processes (chemical) does not require a vacuum 

environment. Chemical methods are generally characterized by higher deposition rates, good 

control of stoichiometry, the production of large area defect free films and lower equipment 

costs. These advantages make chemical processes, for example, chemical vapour deposition, 

very attractive in terms of industrial production. However, CVD techniques are currently limited 



 

 

19 

 

due to the availability and toxicity of the precursor sources for functional materials what 

presents a major weakness of this technology. On the other hand, the methods of chemical 

solution deposition technique, such as sol-gel, are becoming increasingly important for the 

preparation of films of piezo, pyro - and ferroelectric materials.[23]  

The wet chemical methods involve three distinct steps: the preparation of a solution, the 

deposition of the solution onto the substrate by dip or spin coating and the subsequent thermal 

treatment of the deposited layer to remove the organics, to crystallize the desired phase and to 

densify the coatings. The details of experimental routines and chemical reactions, including the 

choice of precursors, the choice of pressure and temperature, and reactions of polymerization, 

make the difference among the several methods: sol-gel route, metalloorganic decomposition 

(MOD) and hydrothermal routes. Chemical methods provide a very convenient, economic and 

rapid processing methodology for the preparation of films or coatings on a variety of 

substrates.[21] 

The methods described before are mainly used for the preparation of thin films. The 

preparation of films with thicknesses between 10 and 100 µm requires different technologies, 

since thick films prepared by PVD and CVD become very expensive.[21] 

The simplicity and versatility of sol-gel technique also makes it attractive for the 

preparation of thick films but has several problems. For instance there is a severe limitation 

related to the thickness of the coating that can be obtained from the conventional sol-gel spin or 

dip-coating process. Depending on the concentration and viscosity of the solutions the 

thickness of single layer is in the range of hundreds of nm. In order to reach the thickness of 10 

µm the process of layer deposition has to be repeated many times. The deposition of a 10 µm 

thick green film will require several layers, making the process time consuming, tedious and 

cost-ineffective. Moreover the probability of creating defects (cracks, pores, and inclusions) in 

the films increases with to the number of layers. 

Defect-free films of PZT with thickness lower than 1 µm are relatively easy to fabricate. 
[39, 41] Therefore, other methods have been used to prepare thick films and in particular 

piezoelectric thick films. Most of the techniques described are based on the densification of 

powder films. The powder layer is usually obtained after the deposition of a slurry onto the 

substrate. The powder can be delivered to the substrate by various techniques such as tape 

casting, screen-printing, inkjet or electrophoretic methods. Dense films are then obtained after 

sintering. In all of these technologies, the sintering is a critical step because of the large surface 

area exposed to the environment and because of the relatively small thickness. Moreover, the 

films are under the influence of a controlled sintering process restricted due to the presence of 

the substrate below. In the case of lead piezoelectrics for which a sintering temperature above 

800° C is usually required, the evaporation of volatile elements (Pb) and problems of 

consolidation may occur.[21]  



 

 

20 

 

Tape casting is an ordinary process for making laminated thick layers of multilayer 

structures, like multilayer capacitors and actuators of PZT[12] and 1-3 PZT-based piezoelectric 

composites, used as transducers for ultrasonic devices, naval sonar systems, medical diagnosis 

and non - destructive testing of materials. Although a low-cost process that allows mass 

productions of laminates, tape casting is not easily compatible with the deposition onto rigid 

substrates and the suspension and firing without deflection are very difficult.[15] The screen-

printing method is one of the most appropriate technologies to prepare thick films with thickness 

ranging from 10 to 30 µm. ln the screen printing technique the powder is also suspended in an 

organic solution composed of a solvent, a dispersant and a plasticizer. The suspension or ink is 

applied, with the aid of a racket, on the substrate through a screen. The thickness of the 

deposited layer depends on the viscosity of the suspension, rate of deposition, pressure applied 

on the screen, among other experimental variables.[21]  

 
  



 

 

21 

 

1.5.2 The Electrophoretic Deposition 

Another thick film processing technique is the electrophoretic deposition (EPD) that 

utilizes a colloidal suspension of ceramic powders. The deposition by electrophoresis combines 

two processes: electrophoresis itself, in which the charged particles suspended in the solution 

move under the influence of an electric field (Figure 11) and, in a dc field, this motion results in 

the particle accumulation near the oppositely charged electrode; the deposited particles are 

attached by van der Waals forces or by chemical bonds and thus constitute a consolidated 

layer, forming a solid deposit. This particulate deposit can then be densified by a sintering step 

and form structures suitable for many applications.[24]  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 11: Schematic representation of the Electrophoretic Deposition process. After 

sintering, the coating densifies and becomes useful for example for piezoelectric applications.[25] 

 

Successful EPD requires the development of stable suspensions composed of 

electrostatically charged particles suspended in a suitable solvent where specific mechanisms 

are active keeping the particles from flocculating or agglomerating.[26]  

Among thick film production processes electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technology 

possesses a set of unique advantages. EPD is very versatile since it can be modified easily for 

a specific application. For example, deposition can be made on flat, cylindrical or any other 

shaped substrate with only minor changes in the electrode design and positioning. In principle, 

EPD can be applied to any solid and any material class that is available in the form of a fine 



 

 

22 

 

powder or a colloidal suspension including metals, polymers, carbides, oxides, nitrides and 

glasses.[26] 

Despite being a wet process, EPD offers easy control of the thickness and morphology of 

a deposited film through simple adjustment of the deposition time and applied potential.[26] The 

interest in the EPD technique is based not only on its high versatility to be used with different 

materials and combinations of materials but also because EPD is a cost-effective method 

usually requiring simple equipment. With EPD, particulate deposits can be made in seconds on 

suitable surfaces of planar or more complex geometry. Moreover EPD has high potential for 

being scaled up to large product volumes and sizes, as well as to a variety of product shapes 

and 3D complex structures.[26]  

 EPD has been quite investigated in the fabrication of high performance functional 

thick/thin films, such as (Ba,Sr)TiO3,
[16] BaTiO3,

[13] Pb(Zr,Ti)O3,
[29] and more recently in the 

manufacturing of thick films for high frequencies, such as BaO-Ln2O3-TiO2,
[29], [27] and tellurium 

based compositions (such as TiTe3O8).

1.6 Current Demands for Piezoelectrics and Ferroelectrics 

 

1.6.1 Miniaturization and Low Processing Costs 

Advanced functional components are made of materials systems rather than of discrete 

materials, therefore integration issues increase in importance. This is particularly true in 

miniaturized systems where interfaces play a very important role. Integration issues comprise 

both the integration of electroceramics thin films with the substrates and the semiconductor 

chips as well as the combination of bulk ceramics for different kinds and/or other materials such 

as metals, glass or polymers to form compound devices.[19] 

The key words associated with the current trends of microelectronic industry are: 

miniaturization, optimal performance, high integration and low costs (as alleged ahead of). [3] 

Miniaturization of systems such as planar circuits, antennas, filters and couplers are an example 

of a requirement and because of that it has been the driving force for the search for fabrication 

processes for mass-produced dielectric films with repeatable performance at low costs. Indeed, 

the advances attained over the recent years in thick-film technology have permitted this 

inexpensive process to become significantly useful in electronics manufacturing.[20] 

The growing need of the microelectronics industry for small, lightweight, multifunctional 

devices that use less battery power and have low manufacturing costs has also been the driving 

force behind the search for optimized materials. Thick films of materials with improved 

properties and capable of fabrication at low temperatures to replace the currently used bulk 

dielectric components are presently of paramount importance.[30] 

 The manufacturing of ferroelectric films on metal foils is an important mission for devices 

integrated into electronic packaging, an approach that is currently receiving considerable 

attention due to cost and space advantages. One of the significant costs in the manufacture of 

electroceramics is the energy consumed during thermal processing. The other one is 

associated with the high price of the substrates (Si based) and under layers (noble metals). 

From this perspective low sintering temperatures for the materials are desirable.[31]

1.6.2 Processing Compatibility with Metals 

Base metals are commercially attractive because of their low cost and simple 

patternability. However their compatibility with the current fabrication techniques of functional 

materials is difficult and sometimes impossible.

Copper presents an excellent electrical conductivity, as referred in Table 3, and has 

extensive use as an electrical and heat conductor, as a building material and as a component of 

various alloys. Copper does not react with water (H2O). Instead it reacts slowly at room 

temperature with the oxygen from air to form a layer of copper oxide on copper metal. 

Cu foils with thickness of several tens of micrometers are attractive substrates for thin 

and thick ferroelectric film deposition due to its low cost and high conductivity. The deposition of 

a high-permittivity material on Cu is promising for embedded capacitor applications in printed 

wiring boards (PWBs). Besides cost reduction, the required wiring board area is greatly reduced 

by replacing the surface - mount components with pre-embedded capacitive layers. This offers 

indeed advantages for electronic miniaturization.[33] 

Compared to platinum, which is widely used as an electrode material in many oxide thin-

film devices, the low cost and high conductivity of Cu makes it a promising candidate to replace 

Pt for non-volatile ferroelectric memories, other ferroelectric, complex oxide thin and thick film-

based devices (as is demonstrated in Table 2). However, the utilization of Cu foils as substrates 

for films poses several important problems. Cu is easily oxidized at high temperatures and the 

oxygen partial pressure (pO2) needs to be controlled to avoid oxidation of Cu. Moreover, 

ferroelectric films usually need to be annealed at high temperatures in oxygen atmosphere to 



 

 

25 

 

obtain the desired crystalline phase. Hence, success depends on finding deposition conditions 

that fulfil both requirements.[34] 

The successful use of Cu foils as substrates for the preparation of ferroelectric lead 

based and lead-free thin films have been reported by some authors.[32, 33] BaTiO3 thin films with 

high dielectric permittivity have been deposited by sol-gel technique directly on Cu foils for 

embedded component applications. Cu foils were also used for the preparation of sputtered 

Ba1-xSrxTiO3 (BST) thin films for tunable capacitors for radio frequency/microwave applications. 

The feasibility of the preparation of sol–gel-derived Ba1-xZrxTiO3 (BZT) thin films on Cu foils was 

also recently demonstrated for tunable capacitors with radio frequency/microwave 

applications.[12] High-resolution TEM cross-section microscopy studies of these films revealed 

no interfacial reactions. According to the authors, the success in the preparation of BaTiO3 

based capacitors on Cu is related to the very low oxygen partial pressures required to reduce 

TiO2 and BaO, compatible with the conditions under which Cu oxidizes. However, a different 

situation occurs for Pb-based systems. Due to the tendency of PbO to reduce at higher oxygen 

partial pressures than BaO, the processing window of PbO based films on Cu foils is 

comparatively narrow. Two approaches have been reported to avoid the oxidation of Cu. The 

first approach involves the use of a Ni/Ni phosphide interface layer between the Cu foil and the 

Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) and PLZT films. High-resolution cross-section microscopy studies revealed 

the formation of a NiO layer[34] and consequently, a linear dielectric capacitor with a reduced 

capacitance density was obtained. Although useful for embedded capacitors, this solution is not 

suitable when higher dielectric permittivity responses are required. The alternative approach 

involves the control of pO2 within a narrow processing window predicted by thermodynamics. 

High quality sol–gel-derived PZT thin films deposited directly on Cu foils with an accompanying 

ferroelectric fatigue resistance were reported.[34] Within that window the stability of Cu against 

oxidation is compatible with the stability of PZT against reduction. Generally, the annealing 

temperature for sol–gel PZT thin films on Cu does not exceed 700ºC. However, for thick films 

deposited on Cu, a much higher temperature is required to achieve sintering of the PZT 

particles. Hence, besides oxidation, problems such as diffusion, adhesion and interaction 

between film and substrate at such a temperature are envisaged. 

From the phase diagram of the Cu–Pb binary system, there also exists a eutectic point 

above 955ºC (Figure 12). It is considered therefore that this may also be a critical temperature 

in the processing of thick films containing Pb. The copper-lead phase diagram has a eutectic 

point at 326 ºC for 99.94 % Pb and as a result terminal solid solutions of most pure lead (0.007 

% Cu) and pure copper (0.005 % Pb) are formed at room temperature.[35] There are three 

important parts to consider: (1) the liquid that is miscible in all proportions at higher 

temperatures, but develops a miscibility gap below about 1000ºC; (2) the face-centered cubic 

(fcc) solid solution (Cu), with very limited solubility of Pb, and (3) the fcc solid solution (Pb), with 



 

 

26 

 

presumably negligible solubility of Cu.[36] The most important feature of this diagram is the 

monotetic invariant reaction at 46 % Pb and 955ºC. At the monothetic point (100% Cu), L1 

(46% Pb) and L2 (87% Pb) can coexist. Copper and lead are essentially insoluble in each 

other.[37] 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 12: Phase diagram of the Cu–Pb binary system.[37] 

 

Previous studies on the manufacture of thick PZT films on Cu by electrophoretic 

deposition (EPD) have shown, for the films sintered under a nitrogen based atmosphere at 950-

1000 ºC with controlled pO2, the formation of a Pb-Cu alloy at the Cu /PZT interface which 

migrates into the bulk of the film causing the PZT decomposition into ZrO2 and lead titanate 

(PT) rich PZT. The dielectric permittivity and remanent polarization responses are consequently 

deteriorated when compared with the properties of PZT thick films deposited on inert metal foils, 

such as, Pt. These studies clearly point to the need to decrease the sintering temperature of 

PZT thick films on Cu.[4]  

 

  



 

 

27 

 

1.6.3 Sintering Aids 

As well explained above, because of the need of expensive electrode materials such as 

platinum and palladium in many co-fired multilayer devices, imposed by the high sintering 

temperatures and the environmental concerns over PbO volatilization at these temperatures, 

much attention has been paid at reducing the sintering temperature of a wide range of 

electroceramics products such as barium titanate (BT) and lead zirconate titanate (PZT). 

Sintering ceramics at low temperature has been done by using for example liquid phase 

additives. Liquid phase sintering aids melt below the sintering temperature. Ideally, the sintering 

aid should be chosen so that the ceramic particles are both wetted by, and practically soluble in 

it. Wetting of the particles by the liquid, results in curved liquid meniscus surfaces on witch 

capillarity forces act tending to drown the particles together. When solubility of the solid occurs, 

a higher diffusivity into the liquid may increase the rate of mass transport and shrinkage. 

Porosity is also reduced by residual liquid filling the pores.[26]  

For BT, PbO–B2O3 and Bi2O3–B2O3 glass sintering aids have been commonly utilized.
[31] 

For the case of PbTiO3 ceramics it has been demonstrated that borate- and silicate-based 

glasses which contain a high mol% of TiO2 and PbO act well as sintering aids. 

The most studied additives for PZT have been: Pb5Ge3O11, PbO-B2O3, B2O3–Bi2O3—

CdO, PbO- Cu2O, Li2CO3–Bi2O3 and borate- and silicate-based glasses.
[4] Literature also refers 

the use of low melting oxides such as V2O5 and glass frits. The addition of glass frit enhanced 

density significantly to ~92% of the theoretical density, due to the low melting of the glass frit 

which helps densification during the initial and intermediate stages of the sintering. [1] However, 

deteriorating effects on the piezoelectric and dielectric properties were reported. 

From the phase diagram of PbO-B2O3 (Figure 13) several eutectic points at low 

temperatures can be identified, making these compositions suitable to be used as sintering 

aids. Indeed, in some works 4PbO·B2O3 frit was added because of its low melting temperature 

and high polarizability, which was helpful to the dielectric and piezoelectric properties of the 

system. If small amounts of 4PbO·B2O3 glass powder are added to the calcined PZT ceramics, 

the formed liquid phase increases the surface diffusion and enhances the grain growth during 

sintering. Hence, the sintering temperature can be reduced and the piezoelectric and dielectric 

properties are enhanced.[38]

The products of reaction between PZT and PbO-B2O3 glasses at 850°C were studied 

using powder and bulk PZT samples.[39] The use of this additive has not been reported yet in 

PZT thick films.

2. Objective of the Thesis  

As stated in the previous chapter, piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate ceramics find 

currently numerous applications. In some of these applications, noble metals such as platinum 

and palladium are used as internal electrodes; for applications in which the ceramic is cofired 

with the metallic electrode low cost based electrodes such as silver, nickel and copper, among 

others, cannot be used due to their low melting points as compared to the sintering 

temperatures commonly employed for PZT. The use of these expensive metals adds significant 

costs to the components. This issue becomes even more relevant when there is the need to 

embed capacitors into the circuit. It is then imperative to lower the sintering temperature of the 

electroceramics and to make it compatible with low cost based metals. Concomitantly, sintering 

at low temperatures also brings other benefits, as well, regarding the reduced power 

consumption and lead losses during sintering thereby contributing for a better environment.[3]  

 

Within this context, the topic of this work is related with the preparation of PZT thick films 

on flexible copper substrates for embedded circuit applications. And the main objective of this 

study is to decrease the sintering temperature of thick PZT films to make them compatible with 

the use of Cu substrates and concomitantly to improve the film quality and dielectric 

performance. One way of doing this is through the use of sintering aids. By adding a 

commercial glass powder and mixtures of PbO and B2O3 with different ratios, as sintering aids, 

a systematic study of the preparation and properties of PZT thick films on Cu is undertaken.  

Another important objective is to lower the fabrication costs of thick films to add value in 

terms of commercialization. Within this context electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method is 

exploited for the fabrication of these thick films and the processing conditions such as voltage, 

deposition time and suspension composition are studied in order to fabricate high-quality and 

reproducible coatings on the conductive substrates utilising a commercially available PZT 

powder.

3. Experimental Procedure 

In this work PZT thick films were fabricated by EPD on Cu metallic foils. In order to 

decrease the sintering temperature of the films, the effect of sintering aids was addressed. The 

sintering aids used were a lead containing-borosilicate glass and a mixture of boron oxide and 

lead oxide. Lead oxide is a glass former with low melting point (phase diagram, Figure 12), 

which will help to decrease the sintering temperature of PZT. B2O3, as V2O5, is also a low 

melting point oxide and a glass former one. 

The obtained results were compared with previous ones reported within this group for a 

mixture of PbO and V2O5.

The next table indicates the various compositions studied in this thesis.

obtained films [45] sintered with a mixture of PbO+V2O5.

A powder suspension was prepared using commercial PZT powders (TRS600FG, TRS 

Technologies Inc., State College, PA) as starting materials and glacial acetic acid (Pronalab, 

100%, Lisbon, Portugal) as the suspension medium. Glacial acetic acid was reported to improve 



 

 

31 

 

the electric properties of thick films prepared by EPD over aqueous and alcoholic media on 

platinised alumina substrate.[24] 

 A commercial borosilicate glass powder, Glass Powder 8465, manufactured by Schott 

Electronic Packaging was used in this study. Its transformation temperature is 385ºC and the 

dielectric constant of this glass is 15 and loss tangent is 0.0027. The glass powder 8465 was 

added to PZT in the amounts of 5, 10 and 20 weight percent (wt %) of PZT. PZT and glass 

powders were milled separately in acetone during 6 hours. The final particle size of 0,377 µm 

for PZT and 5,12 µm for Glass was determined by Coulter LS230 Instrument (Coulter LS 230, 

Coulter Electronic Limited, Luton, U.K.), 

Lead oxide (Panreac, 99%) and boron oxide B2O3 (commercial oxide) were used for the 

second set of compositions. The particle size of these oxides was also assessed by the Coulter 

LS230 Instrument. 

The mixture of PZT powders with sintering aids (glass or oxide powders) were 

ultrasonically mixed and dispersed in glacial acetic acid (Pronalab, 100%, Lisbon, Portugal) to 

form a suspension with a concentration of 3 wt % of PZT in acetic acid. 

In this work, an electrophoretic light scattering (ELS) spectrophotometer (Delsa-440 SX, 

Beckman Coulter, Inc., USA) was used to determine the zeta potential of the PZT suspensions. 

For that, a sample is typically placed in a disposable plastic cuvette and platinum electrodes 

inserted. The entire cell is placed into the internal chamber of Delsa 440 SX and the 

measurement automatically conducted. 

As it is well know, the dispersability of the glass powders in suspension is very difficult 

and because of that two one dispersant was used in this work. Commercial Dispex A 40 

(0,01g/mL) was used in the amount of 5 wt % and 5 - 7.5 wt % of polyvinyl butyral (PVB) 

(commercial product), was used as binder, added to a 10 and 20 wt % of glass suspension. 

Electrophoretic deposition was carried out in optimized conditions through varying the 

current, voltage and time of deposition. Figure 14 illustrates the electrophoretic deposition 

apparatus used in this work.

The distance between the metal foil cathode and the stainless-steel anode was kept at 2 

cm. A dc voltage supply (Glassman High Voltage Inc., Portugal) was used to generate the dc 

voltage required for the deposition, ranging from 200 to 400 V. 

 Prior to each EPD cycle the suspensions were ultrasonically dispersed and magnetically 

stirred for 5 and 10 min, respectively, followed by settling for 0,5 min in order to sediment the 

coarse particles. 

To fabricate &gt;1µm thick films for which the properties are shown below, the suspension 

was sonicated for 10 min and the deposition was carried out over 0.5 min at 200V. 

A mask with 10 mm diameter hole in centre (Figure 15 illustrates the mask with 10 mm 

diameter in centre) was used for the deposition. The metal foil substrate (Cu) used for film 

deposition was hold between the stainless steel and the mask.

In previously works at this group it was observed that the rate of formation of the 

consolidated layer during EPD is directly proportional to the amount of charge that passed 

through the cell. When EPD is operated under constant current conditions, the deposited weight 

increases linearly with time. However, in order to maintain constant-current conditions, the 

voltage has to be continuously increased as the deposit induces an increased electrical 

resistance to the system. Under constant-voltage conditions, the potential between the 

electrodes is maintained constant, which thus results in a decreased deposition rate as the 

deposit builds up.[42] 

After deposition, the obtained films were dried at room temperature overnight. The dried 

films were isostatically pressed at 2000 kg/cm2 during five minutes. The films were then sintered 

between 800 and 900 ºC under a low oxygen partial pressure (pO2) (between 5 x 10
-5 and 8 x 

10-7 atm), during 30 to 60 minutes. 

The thickness of the films was estimated by a Micrometer, and the structure and phase 

assembly were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Rigaku, ‘‘Geigerflex’’ D/Max- B, Tokyo, 

Japan) operated at 40 kV and 30 mA, scanned from 20° to 80° with a scan speed of 1°/ min and 

step interval 0.02° using Cu K radiation with a wavelength of ?=1.5406 Å. The microstructure of 

the films was analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4100, Japan) 

operated at 20 kV. 

Dielectric properties (dielectric permittivity and loss) were obtained using an HP 4284A 

precision LCR meter, measuring 5 dots for each condition. 

Capacitance–voltage dependence was measured with a Keithley current/voltage source 

meter. Before the measurements, gold (Au) top electrodes were sputtered onto the thick films 

through a shadow mask.

4. Results and Discussion 

 

4.1 Characterization of the Precursor Powders and Suspensions 

As mentioned before, there are three basic steps in EPD: formation of a stable 

suspension of the particles, electrophoretic migration of the particles to the opposite electrode, 

and deposition of the particles in the desired arrangement on the electrode surface. First step 

includes the preparation of a stable suspension in which the particles can move independently. 

In the second step a DC electric field is applied to the suspension causing the electrophoretic 

motion of charged particles toward the oppositely charged electrode. In the final step the inter-

particle repulsion forces that keep the particles stably suspended must be overcome. EPD is 

purely a method of moving and arranging particles. To produce a dense mechanically strong 

layer or object it must be combined with some other process such as sintering and, sometimes 

a pre-sintering isostatic pressing step to eliminate the pores between the particles and to 

densify the film.[41]  

 EPD should not be confused with electrodeposition, here ions are deposited and 

discharged at the electrode. EPD requires colloidal stable suspensions where the particles carry 

a substantial charge. There are several suspension and dispersant media that can be used in 

EPD, that include aqueous, organic, acid and basis. Although aqueous media are important 

from the point of view of costs and environmental issues, due to electrolysis that tend to occur in 

water based suspensions under an electric field, which causes bubbles and pores in the 

deposited layer, aqueous media is seldom used. Although electrostatic stabilization is 

considered most effective in aqueous medium, a substantial surface charge density – with the 

associated countering layer in solution – can also be created in organic and other suspension 

media, through the use of special additives. This is the case of the present work. 

 

4.1.1 Particle Size Distribution 

 Another important aspect that accounts for the stability of the suspension is the particle 

size. The particle size distribution of glass before and after milling and with and without Dispex 

is presented in the next graph (Figure 16). The curve of the glass particles without milling is 

characterised by three main peaks and the average particle size is 8.28 µm. After milling a 

bimodal curve was obtained with an average particle size of 3.58 µm. The dispersant effect of 

Dispex is not obvious, since similar results were obtained for dispersed and non dispersed 

suspension and the average particle size is 3.48 µm. This observation allowed us to conclude 

that Dispex was not effective in dispersing the glass particles. 

Concerning the PZT powders, the particle size distribution illustrated in Figure 17 reveals 

a bimodal distribution with a first major peak in the submicron region (peak at 0.2 µm) and a 



 

 

35 

 

second one peaking at 1.7 µm that might correspond to some particle agglomerates. The 

average particle size is 0.414 µm. The addition of Dispex is not particularly effective in removing 

the second peak and only a very subtle increase of the volume % of the finer particles is 

observed. For this last case the average particle size is 0.337µm. Combined with SEM 

observations (Figure 18 and 19), it is believed that the two peaks reveal a weak and stronger 

agglomeration of the original particle size, respectively.

4.1.2 Zeta Potential 

 

4.1.2.1 Brief Introduction to Zeta Potential 

Colloidal particles dispersed in a solution are electrically charged due to their ionic 

characteristics and dipolar attributes. In such a suspension each particle is surrounded by a 

layer of oppositely charged ions called the Stern layer. Outside the Stern layer, there are ions of 

opposite polarities which concentration varies, forming a cloud-like volume. This volume is 

called the diffuse double layer, and the whole volume is electrically neutral.[43] 

When a voltage is applied to the solution in which particles are dispersed, particles are 

attracted to the electrode of the opposite polarity, accompanied by the fixed layer and part of the 

diffuse double layer, usually called as the "sliding surface" (Figure 20). 

 
 
 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 20: Movement of charged particles under the electric field.[Adapted from reference 43] 

 
 

 

In the double layer model, the Zeta potential is considered to be the electric potential of 

this inner volume including this conceptual "sliding surface". As this electric potential 

approaches zero, particles tend to aggregate. 

The static layer is computed using the following formula.[Adapted from reference 43]

L = The distance between

To eliminate errors due to electroosmotic flow caused by any electrostatic charge on the 

measurement cell, the zeta potential is measured at the static layer, whose position can be 

calculated from the width and depth of the cell (the software performs this calculation 

automatically). 

Some considerations to have in mind that are important for EPD: 

• The magnitude of the zeta potential gives an indication of the potential stability of the 

colloidal system; 

• If all the particles have a large negative or positive zeta potential they will repel each 

other and there is a dispersion stability; 

• If the particles have low zeta potential values then there is no force to prevent the 

particles coming together and there is a dispersion instability; 

• A dividing line between stable and unstable dispersions is generally taken at either +30 

or -30mV (Figure 21), being suspensions with zeta potentials &gt; +30mV or &amp;lt;-30mV normally 

considered stable.

To guarantee the required suspension stability and a constant flow of particles under the 

applied electric field, during EPD, zeta potential curves are a good indicator of the surface 

charges and stability of the suspensions. Meanwhile, zeta potential sign (positive or negative) 

determines the direction and migration velocity of the powder particles during EPD. Moreover, 

because high green densities are required for these thick films a very well dispersed suspension 

is needed. It is then crucial to maximize the repulsive forces between the particles to prevent 

their coagulation and consequent flocculation that will markedly affect the quality of the 

deposited films. 

The surface charge of these PZT suspensions was analyzed by zeta-potential 

measurements and the zeta potential of PZT powders dispersed in Potassium Chloride (KCl) as 

a function of pH is depicted in Figure 22. At low pH, PZT is positively charged and presents a 

quite high zeta potential value, &gt; +30 mV, indicating its suitability for electrophoretic deposition; 

under an electric field the powders will be deposited onto the cathode. As the pH value 

increases zeta potential decreases being zero (isoelectric point) for pH ? 10.15 and then the 

negative surface charges increase for higher pH values.  

The zeta potential behaviour of the glass and oxide powders was analysed as well. The 

zeta potential curve for unmilled and milled glass is plotted in Figure 23. Similarly to the 

previous curve, the zeta potential of glass powders decreases as pH increases with an 

isoelectric point for pH ? 10.15 for glass before milled and pH ? 10.9 for glass after milled. For 

low pH values the zeta potential is around +30 mV, suggesting a good compatibility with PZT 

powders in terms of suspension stability towards an effective EPD. In accordance with the 

particle size distribution, milled glasses present slightly higher zeta potential values.  

Based on these results of zeta potential, suspensions of the films in this work were 

prepared in acetic acid media and under a pH value &amp;lt;5, and a cathodic EPD took place.

4.2 Characterization of the Films 

 

4.2.1 Structure and Phase Analysis 

The XRD patterns of sintered PZT films with addition of 5 wt % Glass additions deposited 

on Cu are depicted in Figure 25. The crystalline phases present in the film after sintering at 

800ºC for 30 minutes are PZT, ZrO2, Cu, PbO, and PbTiO3. To be noted here is the high 

intensity of the Cu peaks, what may related with the low thickness of the films deposited with 

glass addition. Similar phases were identified for the films sintered with the other glass contents 

and at different temperatures. No significant changes were observed and no phases resulting 

from the reaction of the glass with PZT or with Cu were observed.  

All this bad results for formed crystalline phases, the appearance of second phases and 

dominant phases being copper were probably the reason for such bad results on dielectric 

properties and the abandonment of these compositions for deposition of these films with glass 

addition.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 25: XRD patterns of PZT films with PZT with 5 wt % of Glass, sintered at 800ºC 

for 30 minutes. 

 

 



 

 

44 

 

The XRD patterns of sintered PZT films with B2O3 + PbO on Cu are represented in 

Figures 26, 27, 28 and 29. 

Figure 26 depicts the XRD patterns of PZT films with 1 wt % of (90% B2O3 and 10% 

PbO) and sintered at 800ºC and 900ºC for 30 and 60 minutes. For the low sintering 

temperatures (800ºC) three crystalline phases were identified as PZT, PbO and Cu, being PZT 

the dominant phase. The presence of PbO in these films is related with the used additives. The 

absence of boron based crystalline phases should be related with the glass formation character 

of boron oxide, implying an effectiveness of the role of PbO – B2O3 additions as sintering aid. 

Important to note here is the nonappearance of any cuprite phase, resulting from the oxidation 

of the Cu substrate, what indicates that the used reducing atmosphere was effective in 

preventing the oxidation of the substrate, at least under the current XRD detection limit. As the 

sintering temperature increases to 900ºC besides the phases previously detected, peaks 

corresponding to Pb and ZrO2 were identified as well. This may be due to a reaction between 

PZT and Cu leading to the separation of the PZT with the formation of lead oxide and zirconium 

oxide, and as a consequence may degrade the electrical response of these films. Another 

indication of the degradation of PZT is that the intensity of the peaks correspondent to PZT 

decreased as the sintering temperature increases to 900ºC. Indeed in a previous work [4] for 

PZT films deposited on Cu foils and sintered at temperatures higher than 950 ºC ZrO2 was 

detected as well. [34] It was then postulated that the formation of a Cux-Pb when sintering above 

950 °C caused the decomposition PZT accompanied by the Ti enrichment of PZT and formation 

of ZrO2.

The XRD patterns plotted in next figure (Figure 27) correspond to the PZT films with 1 wt 

% of (80% B2O3 and 20% PbO) sintered at 800ºC and 900ºC for 30 and 60 minutes. Similarly to 

the previous films, for the low sintering temperature only the phases corresponding to PZT, PbO 

and Cu were detected. As the sintering temperature increases the identified phases are PZT, 

Cu, PbO, ZrO2 and Pb, as observed before.

Figure 28 illustrates the XRD patterns of PZT films with 1 wt % of (50% B2O3 and 50% 

PbO) sintered at 800ºC and 900ºC for 30 and 60 minutes. The crystalline phases identified in 

these films are the same as in the two previous cases: PZT, Cu and PbO for the films sintered 

at 800 ºC and plus ZrO2 and Pb for the films sintered at 900ºC. In this case the intensity of the 

PZT degrades as well with the sintering temperature. 

From the above XRD results there are no obvious differences in terms of phases formed 

and in terms of crystallinity (inferred by peaks intensity) between the PZT films prepared with 

different B2O3 + PbO proportions. For all of the studied oxide mixtures the highest sintering 

temperature (900ºC) promotes reactions with the substrate and the formation of secondary 

phases. Due to the excess of PbO used as sintering aid, residual PbO is present in these films. 

In terms of phase formation the low sintering temperature of 800 ºC corresponds to the most 

adequate situation in terms of formed phases.

XRD patterns of PZT films with 3 wt % (50% B2O3 + 50% PbO) sintered at 800ºC for 30 

minutes are plotted in Figure 29. Six crystalline phases were identified as, PZT, ZrO2, Cu, PbO 

and cuprite (Cu2O), being the most intense peaks those correspondent to the PZT phase.  

For films sintered at 850ºC for 30 minutes the identified phases are PZT, ZrO2, PbO and 

Cu. In this case cuprite was not detected. Under the same sintering conditions but longer 

sintering times the same phase’s we present together with some peaks of TiO2. 

Differently from the previous cases is the detection of the peaks of cuprite in the films 

sintered at low temperatures that indicate the oxidation of the Cu substrate; as stated before 

this oxidation was not visible in some of the previous patterns. The oxidation of the substrate 

may be related with the experimental sintering conditions used in the course of this work, in 

which the control of the low oxygen partial pressure (pO2) is indeed not very accurate.

4.2.2 Film Microstructure and Thickness 

Figure 30 illustrates the optical micrographs of some of the PZT films as deposited and 

after drying. Thin and fluffy layers with irregular edges and surfaces cover some parts of the 

substrate for films prepared from PZT and glass powders suspensions. In these cases the film 

thickness was not uniform and in some cases it was even impossible to have a continuous layer 

of powder on the surface of the substrate. These observations support very well the XRD 

results obtained for these films (Figure 25). It is then expected that for some of these films the 

ability to measure the dielectric properties will be difficult. 

On the other hand conformal and uniform PZT films were obtained for the films with 

oxides additions. These observations are in agreement with the examinations during the 

electrophoretic deposition, with the results of the suspension studies and with the XRD results.

Typical microstructures of the PZT green films are represented in Figure 31 (a and b) for 

PZT films with (50% B2O3 + 50% PbO) additions. As expected, green films show higher porosity 

than those fabricated from milled powders, which show relatively close packed microstructures. 

To illustrate typical microstructures, samples sintered at 800 °C with 1wt % of (50% B2O3 

and 50% PbO) were selected for SEM analysis and the micrographs are presented in Figure 32. 

From the low magnification image it is clear that homogeneous and crack free films were 

obtained. However the film microstructure is not very dense and, as depicted in the high 

magnification micrograph the grains are loosely packed. The cross section micrograph of these 

films (Figure 32 c)) indicates that the thickness of these films is around 10 µm, the surface is 

quite smooth, the grains are very fine and the porosity is clearly seen.

The next micrographs correspond to films of PZT with 1wt % of (80% B2O3 and 20%

minutes. As clearly seem from the images and as expected at this high sintering temperature 

films are denser and grains are bigger. For some of these films, cracks were observed at these 

high temperatures, what might be related with the preparation conditions.

4.2.3 Electrical Properties 

 

4.2.3.1 Electrical properties of PZT + 5, 10 and 20 wt % Glass Frit 

The dielectric permittivity and losses as a function of the frequency and at room 

temperature of PZT films with glass additions and sintered at different temperatures are 

depicted in Figures 34 and 35. For very low frequencies, as the frequency increases the 

dielectric permittivity slightly decreases, keeping almost constant until 381 at 1 kHz. Similar 

behaviour is observed for the losses. The dielectric permittivity ranges from 50 to 350 and the 

losses from 0.05 to almost 2. In comparison with the values obtained in this work for the other 

PZT films and reported in the literature this range of permittivity values is quite low [1], [4], [39]  

As it can be seen there is no consistent variation of the dielectric response with the 

sintering cycle. For the films with 20 wt % of glass addition it was not possible to obtain any 

dielectric data. In this case the films presented very high porosity and almost all of the 

capacitors were short circuited when the electric field was applied. 

These observations are a result of the difficult deposition of PZT powders and glass and 

are consistent with the structural and microstructural analysis reported before.

As expected from the microstructures these properties are quite poor and reflect well the 

difficulties in getting homogeneous microstructures for these films, what is indeed related with 

the difficulty in depositing by EPD a homogeneous composite microstructure of PZT and glass 

powders.  

 

 

In order to improve the quality of the deposition binders were used. However the 

dielectric permittivity and losses of PZT films with glass additions and PVB were very poor, 

being the obtained dielectric permittivity quite small, ranging from 25 to 35, and the losses, 

consequently quite high, around 6, as depicted in Figures 36 and Figures 37, as an example. 

These results clearly indicate that the use of PVB was indeed not effective in improving films 

quality. The use of PVB didn´t improve the adhesion of the particles to the substrate, on the 

contrary it decreased the mobility under the electric field during EPD avoiding the deposition of 

continuous thick layers. The degree of sedimentation of these suspensions was still high. The 

decomposition of the binders, in the present case, left open residual porosity what hindered the 

densification of the films and somehow contradicted the sintering aid effect of the glass.

4.2.3.2 Electrical properties of PZT + 1 wt % (B2O3 + PbO) 

The electrical properties of PZT thick films with different amounts of oxide mixtures are 

presented in this section.  

The comparison between the permittivity of PZT with 1 wt % (xB2O3 + (100-x)PbO) films 

sintered at different temperatures and for different periods of time as a function of lead oxide 

and boron oxide content is depicted in Figures 38 and 39. As the sintering temperature 

increases the permittivity decreases. A similar statement holds for the effect of the sintering 

time: higher permittivities were measured for the films sintered for 30 minutes against films 

sintered for 60 minutes. The dielectric response of the films corroborates well the observations 

of the phase analysis (Figures 26 to 28). Prolonged sintering time or high sintering temperatures 

favoured the reaction between PZT and Cu, with the formation of secondary phases (ZrO2 and 

Pb) and modification of the stoichiometry of PZT, which damages the dielectric properties. 

 

 

 

Figure 38: Permittivity versus PbO % of PZT films with 1 wt % of (xB2O3 + (100-x) PbO), 

being x = 90, 80 and 50) and sintered at different sintering temperatures, 800ºC, 850ºC and 

900ºC for 30 minutes.

900ºC for 60 minutes.  

 

In the next graph of the permittivity versus frequency (Figure 40) for PZT films with 90% 

B2O3 and 10 % PbO one can observe that high permittivities are obtained for the films sintered 

at 850ºC for 30 minutes and the permittivity at 1 kHz was approximately 342. The lowest values 

of permittivity were obtained at 900ºC and 60 minutes.  

Figure 41 depicts the curves of dielectric losses versus frequency in which a similar 

tendency is observed with the highest losses being observed for the films sintered at 900 ºC 

and 60 minutes of sintering time.

The dielectric response of PZT films with 1wt % of (80% B2O3 and 20% PbO) and 

sintered at different temperatures are represented in Figures 42 and 43. A similar trend is 

observed for the variation of the permittivity with the frequency and with the sintering 

temperature. The best dielectric permittivity and losses were observed for the films sintered at 

850ºC and 60 minutes and the inferior response observed for those sintered at 900ºC and 60 

minutes. The dielectric losses of these films followed this behaviour.

Next graph (Figure 44) represents the dielectric permittivity for PZT films with 1 wt % 

(50% B2O3 + 50% PbO) and 3 wt % of (50% B2O3 + 50% PbO) as a function of the frequency. 

Two distinct zones in the graph can be clearly observed: i) films with 1wt% of (50% B2O3 + 50% 

PbO) and ii) films with 3 wt % of (50% B2O3 + 50% PbO) indicating the obvious role of the 

amount of the sintering aids in the dielectric response, that is optimised for 3wt% of the oxide 

addition. 

 For the same frequency (1 kHz) but with a composition of 3 wt % of (50% B2O3 + 50% 

PbO) the value obtained for permittivity was 1195 at 850ºC and 30 minutes. Indeed, the best 

dielectric response of this work was obtained for the composition of 3 wt % of (50% B2O3 + 50% 

PbO), that corresponds to the best film densification.

In terms of loss, better results were once again obtained for 3 wt % of (50% B2O3 + 50% 

PbO) (Figure 45). For the composition with the best permittivity, losses at 1 kHz are 0.02. 

Capacitance versus voltage curves of these films are shown in Figure 46. The best 

capacitance response was observed for the films sintered at low temperatures: a capacitance of 

0.503 pF for PZT films with 1wt % of (50 B2O3 + 50 PbO), sintered at 800ºC and 850ºC of 

sintering temperature 30 and 60 minutes, respectively.  

The discrepancies between the capacitance and dielectric response for the films with 1 

and 3 wt% may be related with microstructural details of the films, such as film thickness and 

interface layers, that under the applied electric field can affect differently the polarization and as 

a consequence the maximum capacitance is not observed for the film that exhibits the 

maximum permittivity.

4.2.3.3 Electrical properties of PZT + 1wt % (V2O3 + PbO) 

For comparison equivalent films with a mixture of V2O5 and PbO 
[45] were prepared and 

their dielectric properties measured and are presented in Figures 47 and 48. In general and as 

expected the permittivity and the losses decrease as the frequency increases, within the 

frequency range used in this work. 

As observed for the films with B2O3 and PbO, the best dielectric performance of PZT with 

1wt % (V2O3 + PbO) was observed for the films sintered at low sintering temperatures and times 

(permittivity of 381 and losses of 0.09 at 1 kHz,). While for PZT with (xB2O3 + (100-x) PbO), the 

best values of permittivity were in general obtained at 850ºC and 30 minutes, for PZT with (V2O5 

+ PbO) the highest values were obtained at 800ºC and 30 minutes. These differences reflect 

the different behaviour of the sintering aids, being the vanadium lead oxide mixture more 

effective in terms of dielectric response at lower temperatures than the boron lead oxide 

mixtures, although films with this last mixture presented the highest values of dielectric 

permittivity.

For comparison the next graph depicts the variation of the dielectric permittivity and 

losses as a function of frequency of PZT thick films on Cu foil sintered at 1000 ºC for 30 min at 

pO2 ~5 x10
-5 atm. The dielectric permittivity at a frequency of 10 kHz is 90 and the dielectric 

loss was 0.2. It´s obvious from these results that PZT thick films on Cu substrates sintered 

without sintering aids have not the required properties required to embed them into electronic 

systems. On the other hand and based on the above results, PZT films on Cu sintered with a 

mixture of B2O3 + PbO posses enhanced properties making these films good candidates for 

embedding microelectronics applications.These observations are well visible in the next table.

Table 6 presents the dielectric permittivity and dielectric loss of PZT thick films deposited 

on Cu foils without any additive, with glass, with a mixture of 1 and 3 wt % (B2O3 + PbO), with a 

mixture of 1 wt % (V2O5 + PbO) and with additions of PbO and sintered at different 

temperatures. 

Comparing all values one can see that the best dielectric response was obtained for the 

films with 3 wt % (50% B2O3 + 50% PbO) and sintered at 850ºC, 30 min and for PZT deposited 

on Pt foils and sintered 1150ºC and 30 minutes.

5. Conclusions  

In order to decrease the sintering temperature of thick PZT films to make them 

compatible with the use of Cu substrates and to improve the film quality and dielectric 

performance for embedded circuit applications, using a low cost based process, the following 

approaches were tested in this work: fabrication of PZT films by EPD and utilization of two 

different types of sintering aids: borate-based glass powders and a mixture of lead and boron 

oxide. 

It was verified that the addition of glass powders was not very effective as a sintering aid. 

The main reason behind this observation is associated with the difficulties in depositing 

homogenous thick films by EPD, what is related with problems in keeping stable the suspension 

of PZT and glass powder. The stability of the suspension depends on the interaction between 

electrostatic and van der Waals forces acting on the individual particles. The coagulation of a 

disperse system (suspension) is the result of the interaction of such forces. High electrostatic 

repulsion forces occur for highly charged particles what was impossible to obtain in these PZT + 

borate glass suspensions. To improve the quality of the deposition, binders were added, but 

weren’t effective and there was not any improvement in the quality of the deposition. As a 

consequence these films presented a poor dielectric response. More research is necessary to 

optimise the stability of the suspension what implies the understanding of the mechanism of 

charging glass particles. 

On the other hand, it was verified that under controlled pO2 atmosphere dense thick PZT 

films on Cu were obtained in the presence of 1 and 3 wt % of a mixture of B2O3 and PbO. In this 

case the stability of the suspension, related with the high zeta potential, was very good and 

homogeneous and compact films were deposited on Cu foils. The addition of B2O3 + PbO was 

indeed effective in reducing the sintering temperature of PZT thick films and the best dielectric 

behaviour was obtained for 3 wt % of (50% B2O3 + 50% PbO) and films sintered at 850ºC for 30 

minutes. For sintering temperatures higher than 850ºC the dielectric properties deteriorate, what 

may be related with the reaction of PZT with the Cu substrate.  

In conclusion, using EPD technology, crack-free PZT thick films with 3 wt % of addition of 

(50 % B2O3 + 50 % PbO) on Cu foils were obtained after sintering at temperatures lower than 

900ºC under controlled pO2 atmosphere and present dielectric permittivities ~1195 and 

dielectric losses ~0.02. The obtained dielectric performance is superior to the one of PZT films 

previously prepared in which lead oxide and vanadium oxide were used as sintering aids. In this 

case after sintering at 900ºC for 30 min a dielectric permittivity of ~450 and loss tangent of 1.39 

was reported.[45]
