AGRADECIMENTOS 

 

 É realmente difícil lembrar-se de todas as pessoas que devemos agradecer quando chega o 

momento. Talvez apenas uma página ou duas numa dissertação seja algo tão pequeno, ou até mesmo 

menor, que um simples obrigado sincero dito em um corredor da universidade. Pois nem é possível 

saber se os agradecimentos serão lidos por quem somos gratos. Não obstante, agradecer aqui é a 

única oportunidade de exercer a liberdade, no único espaço em que o rigor técnico não oblitera a arte 

e priva os sentimentos. 

 A Professora Lena Virgínia Soares Monteiro sem dúvida é a pessoa a quem devo maior 

agradecimento durante esta etapa, não só por todos os ensinamentos e conselhos, e tudo que já tive 

a oportunidade de agradecer, mas também pela compreensão e por todo apoio em minhas decisões. 

Mais do que o conhecimento passado, a Lena, me ensinou muito sobre convivência e ética profissional, 

se houvessem mais professores esforçados como ela, sem dúvida ninguém se formaria com 

defasagem educacional.  

 Também agradeço especialmente ao Professor Roberto Perez Xavier pelo auxílio e pelas 

discussões em que me embasei para tirar minhas próprias conclusões sobre este trabalho. 

 Agradeço à minha mãe, Inez Silva Pestilho, por todo amor e pela fé em mim, durante toda 

provação, mesmo sem saber o significado do que e para que eu estava estudando isto.  

 Agradeço com todo meu amor, à Pamela Cardoso Vilela, que me trouxe muito amor e 

companheirismo durante todo este período de estudos, apoiando e ouvindo, sempre dedicada e 

carinhosa. Sempre vou lembrar aqueles finais de tarde, quando após um dia separando amostras de 

minerais ou escrevendo este texto, ela esteve presente, fazendo-me sorrir e animando-me. 

 Aos amigos, eu agradeço a todos, mas especialmente ao Rafael Rodrigues de Assis pela 

paciência e pelo companheirismo, especialmente durante os períodos de mudança de nossas vidas, eu 

desejo que ele tenha muito sucesso nessa vida. Um obrigado aos velhos amigos Gabriel Bueno Martins 

e ao Paulo Henrique Oliveira, pelos papos e desabafos de fins de semana. Obrigado também ao 

Leandro Rodrigues Magalhães de Marco pelas conversas e os cafés eventualmente acompanhados por 

profundas discussões. 

 Obrigado também a Karen Cristina Perles e a Ana Carolina Buzato Marchi pelas conversas e 

pelo contínuo apoio, mesmo depois que nossos caminhos se afastaram. Também agradeço a Evângela 

Patrícia Alves da Silva, que me apoiou principalmente em todas as mudanças que ocorreram em minha 

vida. 

 Agradeço àqueles que viabilizaram este estudo, como a Companhia VALE, que permitiu nossa 

entrada em suas minas, a coleta de testemunhos e o suporte necessário para a pesquisa. Em especial 

eu gostaria de agradecer ao Benevides Aires por todo o trabalho. Também agradeço a Carolina 

Penteado Moreto e ao Professor Caetano Juliani pelo apoio durante o reconhecimento geológico 

regional e a descrição dos testemunhos que foi realizada.  

 Agradeço também a FAPESP pela concessão da bolsa que viabilizou este projeto. 

 Finally, but still important, I would like to thank Professor Anthony Edward Fallick for his 

priceless contribution with all isotopic analyses. I feel very ashamed due to my own slowness in 

finishing this study. I really hope I have reached reasonable interpretations and conclusions about 

these data.

DISSERTAÇÃO DE MESTRADO 

 

ANDRÉ LUIZ SILVA PESTILHO 
 

 Localizados na porção norte da Província Mineral de Carajás, a uma distância de cerca de 8 km do 

depósito de óxido de ferro-cobre-ouro de Sossego, estão os depósitos de cobre Alvo Bacaba e Alvo 

Castanha. Esses depósitos encontram-se ao longo de uma zona de cizalhamento regional de cerca de 60 

km de extensão, no limite entre o Supergrupo Itacaúnas e seu embasamento representados principalmente 

pelos migmatitos do complexo Xingu.  

 O Alvo Bacaba é hospedado pelo granito Serra Dourada e pelo tonalito Bacaba, enquanto o Alvo 

Castanha é Ambos os depósitos exibem amplas zonas de alteração hidrotermal que compreendem quase 

que respectivamente a albitização, a escapolitização, a formação de óxidos de ferro, a alteração sódico-

cálcica, a alteração potássica, a formação de turmalina, a sericitização, a cloritização, a epidotização e a 

carbonatização, embora estes depósitos mostrem diferenças, como a alteração sódico-cálcica que apesar 

de ser bem desenvolvida no Alvo Castanha, é quase inexistente no Alvo Bacaba, onde apenas ocorre como 

alteração nos gabros. Também o Alvo Bacaba possui uma associação de minerais distintas, composta por 

calcopirita±pirita±bornita, enquanto o Alvo Castanha exibe a associação calcopirita±pirrotita±pirita. 

 Informações sobre evolução paragenética e dados de isótopos estáveis indicam que os depósitos 

Alvo Bacaba e Alvo Castanha evoluíram durante progressivo resfriamento. Entretanto, esta redução com 

relação à evolução paragenética foi maior no Alvo Bacaba do que no Alvo Castanha, e a fugacidade de 

oxigênio foi mantida alta no Alvo Bacaba. A temperatura de deposição do minério estimada para o Alvo 

Bacaba pode ter ocorrido entre 220 °C e 410 °C, enquanto no Alvo Castanha esta teria ocorrido entre 350 

°C e 420 °C. A evolução isotópica do Alvo Bacaba é similar àquela caracterizada para o depósito de 

Sossego, com uma redução acentuada da temperatura acompanhada por um decréscimo no valor de ?18O 

e acréscimo no valor de ?D e evidências de misturas de fluido juvenil e de fonte não magmática. Já para o 

Alvo Castanha, as composições isotópicas dos fluidos hidrotermais indicam a predominância de uma fonte 

magmática. 

 Estas características e similaridades com aquelas de Sossego podem apontar para uma contribuição 

de águas magmáticas e oceânicas no sistema hidrotermal que originou todos estes  

depósitos.

ABSTRACT 

 

DISSERTAÇÃO DE MESTRADO 

 

ANDRÉ LUIZ SILVA PESTILHO 

 

 The Alvo Bacaba and Alvo Castanha copper deposits are located at the northern part of the Carajás 

Mineral Province, at a distant radius of about 8 km from the Sossego iron oxide-copper-gold deposit. 

These deposits occur along a regional shear zone 60 km wide, in the limit between the Itacaiúnas 

Supergroup and its basement represented mainly by migmatites of the Xingu Complex.  

 Both deposits exhibits widespread hydrothermal alteration zones comprising albitization, 

scapolitization, iron oxide formation, sodic-calcic alteration, potassic alteration, tourmaline formation, 

sericitization, epidotization and carbonatization, although these two deposits show differences like sodic-

calcic alteration, which is well developed in Alvo Castanha, but it is almost inexistant in Alvo Bacaba, 

being present only in its altered gabbros. Also the Alvo Bacaba shows ore minerals association essencialy 

composed by chalcopyrite±pyrite±bornite while the Alvo Castanha shows the association of 

chalcopyrite±pyrrhotite±pyrite.  

 Paragenesis and stable isotope data indicate that the Alvo Bacaba and Alvo Castanha deposits have 

evolved with temperature decrease. However, the temperature drop in relation to the hydrothermal 

alteration succession was greater in Alvo Bacaba than the Alvo Castanha, and the oxygen fugacity was 

kept higher at Alvo Bacaba. The estimated temperature for ore deposition in the Alvo Bacaba was 

between 220 °C and 410 °C, while the Alvo Castanha it would have occurred between 350 °C and 420 °C. 

The isotopic evolution of the Alvo Bacaba is similar to that characterized for the Sossego deposit, with a 

steep temperature reduction accompanied by decrease of ?
18

O and increase of ?D values and fluid mixing 

evidences. In the Alvo Castanha, isotopic compositions of the hydrothermal fluids indicate predominance 

of magmatic sources.  

 These characteristics and its similarities with those of the Sossego deposit could point to a 

contribution of magmatic and ocean waters in the hydrothermal system that originated all deposits.

 INTRODUÇÃO 

 Este estudo apresenta a síntese dos resultados e conclusões do projeto de Mestrado 

intitulado ?Sistemática de isótopos estáveis aplicada à caracterização da evolução dos paleo-

sistemas hidrotermais associados aos depósitos cupríferos Alvo Bacaba e Alvo Castanha, 

Província Mineral de Carajás, PA?, apresentados na forma de um artigo a ser submetido a 

periódico especializado no escopo deste trabalho. 

 A Província Mineral de Carajás hospeda importantes depósitos cupro-auríferos localizados 

ao longo de uma zona de cisalhamento regional de direção WNW–ESE com cerca de 60 km, que 

define o contato sul entre o Supergrupo Itacaiúnas, metavulcano-sedimentar, e o embasamento, 

representado por gnaisses tonalíticos e trondhjemíticos e migmatitos do Complexo Xingu 

(DOCEGEO 1988).   

 Estes depósitos, considerados semelhantes aos depósitos de óxido de Fe-Cu-Au (iron oxide-

copper-gold deposits ou IOCG como definido por Hitzman et al. 1992, 2000) se destacam pelo 

tamanho das reservas e teores, como os depósitos Salobo (com reservas de 789 Mt com 0,96% de 

Cu e 0,52 g/t de Au; Lindenmayer 1990), Igarapé Bahia-Alemão (219 Mt com 1,4% de Cu e 0,86 

g/t de Au; Tavaza 1999, Tallarico et al. 2000, 2005), Sossego (355 Mt com 1,5 % de Cu e 0,28 

g/t de Au; Cordeiro 1999, Lancaster e Olveira et al. 2000), Cristalino (500 Mt com 1,0% de Cu e 

0,3 Au; Huhn et al. 1999) e Alvo 118 (70 Mt com 1,0% de Cu e 0,3 g/t de Au; Rigon et al. 2000). 

Além dessas jazidas, outros depósitos e ocorrências cupríferas ainda em avaliação, tais como 

Castanha, Bacaba, Jatobá e Visconde, são conhecidos.  

 Na Província Mineral de Carajás a relevância econômica destes depósitos os torna alvos 

importantes da pesquisa mineral, porém faltam subsídios de um modelo genético que, além de 

refletir as peculiaridades da evolução da província, possa auxiliar na distinção entre alvos 

econômicos e sub-econômicos, contribuindo para a elaboração de guias de prospecção mineral.  

 Os resultados obtidos neste estudo, que tem como tema os depósitos cupríferos Alvo 

Bacaba e Alvo Castanha, foram comparados aos de pesquisas similares realizadas para o depósito 

de Sossego (Carvalho 2005, Carvalho et al. 2009; Monteiro et al. 2007, 2008a, 2008b), o que 

permite um maior entendimento da evolução espacial e temporal do paleo-sistema hidrotermal 

que deu origem a estes depósitos..  Esse estudo integra pesquisas em andamento vinculadas à 

linha de pesquisa em Evolução Crustal e Metalogênese do Departamento de Geologia e Recursos 



2 

 

Naturais do Instituto de Geociências da UNICAMP, com ênfase na identificação de vetores 

associados a depósitos minerais. Os resultados apresentados fornecem subsídios para a 

proposição de modelos metalogenéticos e prospectivos alternativos para os depósitos IOCG da 

Província Mineral de Carajás, com base na compreensão de mecanismos que controlam as 

variações dos tipos de alteração e de minério nos depósitos IOCG dessa importante província 

metalogenética. 

 

OBJETIVOS E JUSTIFICATIVAS 

 Com base na aplicação da sistemática de isótopos estáveis ao estudo dos halos de alteração 

hidrotermal e evolução dos paleo-sistemas hidrotermais associados aos depósitos de cobre Alvo 

Castanha e Alvo Bacaba, este projeto tem como objetivos: 

 (1)  Caracterizar a distribuição das zonas de alteração hidrotermal e suas relações com 

distintos níveis crustais e evolução temporal do sistema paleohidrotermal. 

 (2) Identificar a natureza das fontes de fluidos, metais e enxofre, e a participação 

relativa das fontes, principalmente se múltiplas, na formação de diferentes depósitos de uma 

mesma província. 

 (3) Identificar processos vinculados à evolução do(s) paleo-sistema(s) hidrotermal(is) e à 

deposição do minério. 

 A aplicação da geoquímica de isótopos estáveis na Província Mineral de Carajás possibilita 

considerações sobre a gênese dos depósitos sob o ponto de vista hidroquímico (Taylor 1987), 

baseado no reconhecimento de fluidos mineralizantes de diferentes origens e de evolução 

distintas, que incluem mistura de fluidos, processos de interação fluido-rocha e de magmas com a 

crosta superior. Como os estudos isotópicos dependem do conhecimento prévio da 

paragênese, características das inclusões fluidas, além do conhecimento necessário de 

paleogeografia, evolução estrutural e ambiente tectônico (Ohmoto &amp;amp; Rye 1979, Ohmoto 1986, 

Taylor 1987), é necessário para a aplicação dessa técnica o conhecimento  dos alvos estudados. 

Por esse motivo, foram selecionados para esse estudos os depósitos Alvo Castanha e Alvo 

Bacaba, para os quais informações geológicas, incluindo estudos paragenéticos já são disponíveis 

(Monteiro et al. 2007, Pestilho &amp;amp; Monteiro 2008, Augusto et al. 2008) ou foram levantadas nos 

estudos realizados durante o desenvolvimento desse projeto de Mestrado.

MÉTODOS DE ESTUDO 

(a) Revisão Bibliográfica 

 A revisão bibliográfica teve ênfase nos estudos sobre os depósitos de óxido de ferro–Cu–

Au da Província Mineral de Carajás, sobre os modelos genéticos dos depósitos cupro–auríferos 

em contextos semelhantes em outras províncias metalogenéticas e em estudos sobre geoquímica

ABSTRACT 

 The Alvo Bacaba and Alvo Castanha copper deposits are located at the northern part of the 

Carajás Mineral Province, at a distant radius of about 8 km from the Sossego iron oxide-copper-

gold deposit. These deposits occur along a regional shear zone 60 km wide, in the limit between 

the Itacaiúnas Supergroup and its basement represented mainly by migmatites of the Xingu 

Complex Both deposits exhibit widespread hydrothermal alteration zones comprising albitization, 

scapolitization, iron oxide formation, sodic-calcic alteration, potassic alteration, tourmaline 

formation, sericitization, epidotization and carbonatization although these two deposits show 

differences like sodic-calcic alteration, which is well developed in Alvo Castanha, but it is almost 

inexistant in Alvo Bacaba, being present only in its altered gabbros. Also the Alvo Bacaba shows 

ore minerals association essentially composed of chalcopyrite±pyrite±bornite while the Alvo 

Castanha shows the association of chalcopyrite±pyrrhotite±pyrite. Paragenesis and stable isotope 

data indicate that the Alvo Bacaba and Alvo Castanha deposits have evolved with temperature 

decrease. However, the temperature drop in relation to the hydrothermal alteration succession 

was greater in Alvo Bacaba than the Alvo Castanha, and the oxygen fugacity was kept higher at 

Alvo Bacaba. The estimated temperature for ore deposition in the Alvo Bacaba was between 220 

°C and 410 °C, while for the Alvo Castanha it was between 350 °C and 420 °C. The isotopic 

evolution of the Alvo Bacaba is similar to that characterized for the Sossego deposit, with a steep 



6 

 

temperature reduction accompanied by decrease of ?
18

O and increase of ?D values and fluid 

mixing. 

In the Alvo Castanha, isotopic compositions of the hydrothermal fluids indicate predominance of 

magmatic sources. These characteristics and its similarities with those of the Sossego deposit 

could point to a contribution of magmatic and ocean waters in the hydrothermal system that 

originated all deposits.

1.INTRODUCTION 

 Located at the southeastern margin of the Amazon Craton, northern Brazil, the Carajás 

Mineral Province is one of the largest known polymetallic mineral provinces in the world. It 

hosts a series of large-tonnage world class iron oxide-copper-gold deposits (IOCG; Hitzman 

1992, Hitzman et al. 2000), as example of Salobo (789 Mt at 0.96 wt.% Cu, 0.52 g/t Au, 55 g/t 

Ag; Souza and Vieira 2000), Cristalino (500 Mt at 1.0 wt.% Cu; 0.3 g/t Au, Huhn et al. 1999), 

Sossego (245 Mt at 1.1% Cu and 0.28 g/t Au; Lancaster et al. 2000), and Alvo 118 (170 Mt at 1.0 

wt% Cu, 0.3 g/t Au; Rigon et al. 2000) deposits.  

 On the outskirts of the Sossego Mine, at a distant radius of about 8 km, there is a set of 

minor copper deposits (e.g. Alvo Bacaba, Alvo Bacuri, Alvo Castanha, Alvo Jatobá and Alvo 

Visconde) with a variable content of iron and/or gold, which are designated satellite targets due 

to their proximity and similarities to the Sossego orebodies. These similarities include geological 

features, such as structurally controlled mineralization style, types of hydrothermal alteration, 

metal content and similar light rare-earth-elements enrichment of the ore (Xavier et al. 2010). 

The study of these copper deposits is of paramount importance for the understanding of the 

genesis of the Sossego Mine and other IOCG deposits of the Carajás Mineral Province, which is 

still controversial, since geological information about them is relatively scarce, in special in wich 

concerns those minor deposits.  

 Among the satellite targets, the Alvo Bacaba and Alvo Castanha deposits (Figure 1) have 

been studied previously by Monteiro et al. (2007), Augusto et al. (2008) and Pestilho and 

Monteiro (2008). These deposits showed contrasting geological features in relation to the nature 

of the host rocks, hydrothermal alteration zones and metal enrichment, which are summarized 

here. This paper aims to present new data on the geological setting, paragenetic evolution, and 

stable isotopes constraints on the genesis of these deposits. This study may draw influences for 

undertanding the evolution of the hydrothermal system that originated these deposits and its 

relationship with the Sossego orebodies.

2. THE CARAJÁS MINERAL PROVINCE GEOLOGICAL SETTINGS 

 Comprising an Archean block within the Amazon Craton, the Carajás Mineral Province 

(CMP) is limited to the north by the Paleoproterozoic Maroni–Itacaiúnas belt, to the east by the 

Neoproterozoic Araguaia fold belt, to the west by Paleoproterozoic plutonic granitic rocks and 

related volcanic rocks, and to the south by the Phanerozoic sedimentary cover of the Parecis 

Basin (Tassinari and Macambira 2004).  It is composed of two different tectonic domains: (I) the 

Rio Maria granite–greenstone terrane to the south (Huhn et al. 1988) and (II) the Carajás Domain 

to the north (Araújo et al. 1988). Both are limited by the Transition Domain (Gomes and 

Dall´Agnol 2007), also named Itacaúnas Shear Zone Imbricated Domain (Araújo and Maia 1991, 

Araújo et al. 1994, Costa et al. 1995), whose limit is suggested by geophysical evidence to 

coincide with a regional EW trending discontinuity situated to the north of Sapucaia and south of 

Canaã dos Carajás towns (Oliveira et al. 2009).

2.1. THE CARAJÁS DOMAIN 

 The Carajás Domain (Figure 2) is composed of a basement represented by tonalitic to 

trondhjemitic gneiss and migmatite of the Xingu Complex (2974 ± 15 Ma U-Pb zircon, Machado 

et al. 1991), mafic to felsic orthogranulites of the Pium Complex (3002 ± 14 Ma U-Pb SHRIMP 

zircon, Pidgeon et al. 2000; 3050 ± 57 Ma Pb-Pb whole-rock, Rodrigues et al. 1992) and 

supracrustal sequences. Both basement units were affected by a coeval high-grade metamorphism 

that took place at ~2.85 Ga (2859 ± 2 Ma U-Pb zircon, Machado et al. 1991; 2859 ± 9 Ma U-Pb 

SHRIMP zircon, Pidgeon et al. 2000).

Shear Belt; R.M.G.G. – Rio Maria Granite Greenstone Terranme. 2 - A geologic map of the 

Carajás Domain and the Transition Domain, showing the major ore deposits (DOCEGEO 

1988, CPRM 2004).  

 



10 

 

 The supracrustal sequence that overlies the basement rocks is referred to the Archean 

Carajás Basin, and comprises the ~2.76 Ga metavolcanic-sedimentary Rio Novo Group (Hirata et 

al. 1982) and the 2.73 to 2.76 Ga Itacaiúnas Supergroup (Wirth et al. 1986, DOCEGEO 1988, 

Machado et al. 1991). Besides the younger sequences of shallow-water marine to fluvial clastic 

deposits designated as Rio Fresco Group (Beisiegel et al. 1973, DOCEGEO 1988), also called 

Águas Claras Formation (Araújo et al. 1988, Nogueira et al. 1995).  

 The Itacaiúnas Supergroup hosts known Carajás IOCG deposits (eg. Salobo, Igarapé 

Bahia/Alemão). It comprises the Igarapé Salobo (Wirth et al. 1986; 2761 ± 3 Ma U-Pb zircon, 

Machado et al. 1991), Igarapé Pojuca (DOCEGEO 1988; 2732 ± 3 Ma U-Pb zircon, Machado et 

al. 1991), Grão Pará (DOCEGEO 1988; 2759 ± 3 Ma U-Pb zircon, Machado et al., 1991), and 

Igarapé Bahia groups (DOCEGEO 1988; 2747 ± 1 Ma Pb-Pb zircon, Galarza and Macambira 

2002).  

 The Igarapé Salobo Group includes paragneisses, amphibolites, meta-arkoses and ironstone 

formation. The Igarapé Pojuca Group includes basic metavolcanic rocks, pelitic schists, 

amphibolites and iron formations metamorphosed at the greenschist to the amphibolite facies. 

The Grão Pará Group comprises metabasalts, felsic mtavolcanic rocks and iron formation 

metamorphosed at lower-greenschist facies. Metavolcanic, metapyroclastic and ironstone rocks 

metamorphosed at greenschist facies are included in the Igarapé Bahia Group (DOCEGEO 1988). 

 Above the Itacaiúnas Supergroup, the Águas Claras Formation includes conglomerate, 

sandstone, locally manganese-rich dolomitic marble, talc-chlorite-rich rocks, carbonaceous 

siltstone and sericitic quartzites (Tallarico et al. 2000). This unit is constrained to be Archean by 

dating of detrital zircon in sandstones (2681 ± 5 Ma U-Pb SHRIMP, Trendall et al. 1998) and 

metagabbro sills (2645 ± 12 Ma U-Pb, Dias et al. 1996; 2708 ± 37 Ma U-Pb, Mougeot et al. 

1996). 

 Distinct episodes of granitic magmatism have been identified in the Carajás Domain, 

including: (1) 2.76 to 2.74 Ga alkaline granites, comprising the Plaquê, Planalto, Estrela and 

Serra do Rabo suites (Huhn et al. 1999, Avelar et al. 1999, Barros et al. 2004, Sardinha et al. 

2006); (2) 2.65 Ga dacitic to rhyolitic porphyry (2645 ± 9 Ma and 2654 ± 9 Ma; Pb-Pb SHRIMP 

zircon, Tallarico 2003), (3) 2.57 Ga peralkaline to meta-aluminous granites, characterized by the 

Old Salobo and Itacaiúnas granites (Machado et al. 1991, Souza et al. 1996); (4) 1.6 Ga alkali-

rich leucogranite dyke with a U-Pb SHRIMP age of 1583 ± 7 Ma (Pimentel et al. 2003); (5) 1.88 



11 

 

Ga A-type alkaline to sub-alkaline granites, including the Central de Carajás, Young Salobo, 

Cigano, Pojuca, Breves granites (Machado et al. 1991, Dall'Agnoll et al. 1994, Lindenmayer and 

Teixeira 1999, Tallarico 2003); (6) Neoproterozoic (~600-550 Ma) Formiga Granite, which can 

represent the younger event of granite magmatism in the province (Grainger et al. 2008). 

 Different intrusive rocks also occur in this domain, including the ~2.75 Ga mafic-ultramafic 

intrusions of Luanga, Onça, Vermelho and Jacaré-Jacarezinho (Machado et al. 1991), the 

Borrachudo, Santa Inês and Complexo Lago Grande gabbros (Villas and Santos 2001), and late 

diabase dikes, whose radiometric ages are unknown. 

 The Carajás Domain complex structural settings have been attributed to the development of 

regional E-W trending steeply dipping fault zones that show evidence of several episodes of 

reactivation (Pinheiro and Holdsworth 1997, Holdsworth and Pinheiro 2000). According to these 

authors, the long time period of the tectonic evolution was given by several events: (1) 2.85-2.76 

Ga – Sinistral transpression; (2) &amp;lt;2.76 Ga – Pull-a-part basin formation with the Grão Pará 

Group deposition; (3) 2.7-2.6 Ga – Dextral transtension followed by the Cinzento and Carajás 

strike-slip shear zones development concomitant to the the Águas Claras Formation deposition 

and the island arc type magmatism, with plutons, mafic dykes and sills; (4) ~2.6 Ga – Tectonic 

basin inversion due to faults system reactivation; (5) 1.9-1.8 Ga – Structural extension or 

transtension, which favored the anorogenic granite plutons and mafic dyke swarm intrusion 

(Costa et al. 1995).  

 

2.2. THE TRANSITION DOMAIN 

 The Transition Domain rocks host major IOCG deposits, such as the Sossego Mine, and 

several other copper deposits (e.g. Alvo Bacaba, Alvo Bacuri and Alvo Visconde). Feio et al. 

(2009) distinguished five magmatic associations based on geochemical evidence: (1) calc-

alkaline leucogranites, (2) tonalitic calc-alkaline associations, (3) TTG-like trondhjemites, (4) Ti, 

Y and Zr-rich tonalitic-trondhjemitic associations (Gomes and Dall´agnol 2007), and (5) sub-

alkaline A-type granites. Basic rocks, including variably deformed gabbro and amphibolites have 

been also identified (Gomes 2003). 

 Sardinha et al. (2004) reported Pb-Pb zircon ages for: (i) potassic leucomonzogranites with 

calc-alkaline affinity (2928 ± 1 Ma); (ii) sub-alcaline A-type biotite-hornblende granite (2734 ± 4 



12 

 

Ma), correlated to the Planalto granite, and (iii) trondhjemite of the tonalitic-trondhjemitic 

association (2765 ± 39 Ma).  

 The Neoarchean ages are comparable to those related to the extensive ca. 2.74 to 2.76 Ga 

alkaline magmatism recorded in the Carajás Domain, whereas the leucomonzogranites correlate 

to the Guaratã granite or the Caracol tonalite from the Rio Maria granite-greenstone terrane 

(Sardinha et al. 2004).  

 

2.3. THE SOSSEGO DEPOSIT 

 The Sossego Mine, operated by VALE mining company since 2004, is classified as an iron 

oxide–copper–gold deposit. The Sossego deposit occurs along a regional east-southeast-striking 

shear zone that defines the southern contact between the Itacaiúnas Supergroup and its basement 

within the Transition Domain (Carvalho et al. 2005, Monteiro et al. 2008a, 2008b, Carvalho 

2009, Xavier et al. 2009). 

 The Sossego deposit consists of two major orebody groups (Pista–Sequeirinho–Baiano and 

Sossego–Curral) with distinct alteration assemblages that are separated from each other by a 

major high angle fault. The deposit is hosted by granite, granophyric granite, gabbro, and felsic 

metavolcanic rocks (Monteiro et al. 2008a).  

 Sodic (albite-hematite association) and sodic-calcic hydrothermal alterations were 

characterized in both Sequeirinho and Baiano orebodies associated with massive magnetite-

(apatite) bodies surrounded by actinolite-rich zones (actinolitites), similar to other IOCG 

hydrothermal halos around the world (Monteiro et al. 2008a). These alterations are cut by 

spatially restricted zones of potassic (biotite and potassium feldspar) alteration that grade 

outwards to chlorite-rich assemblages (Monteiro et al. 2008a). The Pista orebody is hosted by 

mylonitized felsic metavolcanic rocks and exhibits a hydrothermal alteration stage characterized 

by biotite±hastingsite-turmaline–escapolite (Villas et al. 2005, Sousa 2007). 

 Nevertheless, the Sossego-Curral orebodies show more intensely developed potassic 

alteration, which is characterized by Cl-rich potassic feldspar and biotite that replace the 

granophyric granite. Chloritic alteration occurs mainly in the external halos associated with the 

hydrolytic alteration, represented by sericite-hematite-quartz association that is typical of very 

shallow sections in IOCG paleo-hydrothermal systems (Carvalho et al. 2005, Monteiro et al. 

2008a, 2008b, Carvalho 2009).  



13 

 

 Sulfide formation in both groups of orebodies is coeval to potassic alteration with 

potassium feldspar and a later assemblage of calcite–quartz–epidote–chlorite. The hydrothermal 

breccias from the Sequeirinho orebody have fragments of actinolitites and actinolite, apatite and 

magnetite crystals within a chalcopyrite-rich matrix. The Sossego orebody breccias show angular 

to sub-angular fragments from the hydrothermally altered host rock involved by magnetite within 

a matrix composed of chalcopyrite, calcite, quartz, chlorite, actinolite, epidote and apatite with 

open-space filling textures (Carvalho et al. 2005, Monteiro et al. 2008a, 2008b, Carvalho 2009). 

 Pista–Sequeirinho–Baiano sulfides range from undeformed to deformed, but sulfides in the 

Sossego–Curral orebodies are undeformed (Monteiro et al. 2008a). The gold-copper 

mineralization formed during late stages in relation to the evolution of the hydrothermal system 

in brittle conditions. Ore minerals are represented by chalcopyrite associated with pyrite (up to 

2.3 wt.% Co and 0.2 wt.% Ni), native gold (up to 14.9 wt.% Ag), siegenite, millerite, vaesite, Pd-

melonite, and hessite (Monteiro et al. 2008b). Pyrrhotite and pyrite are minor ore minerals in the 

Sequeirinho orebody while pyrite is relatively abundant in the Sossego–Curral bodies (Monteiro 

et al. 2008a, 2008b, Carvalho 2009). Chalcopyrite Pb-Pb dating indicates age of breccia 

formation from Sequeirinho orebody at about 2608 ± 25 Ma (Neves et al. 2006, Villas et al. 

2006). 

 Fluid inclusion studies from the Sossego deposit indicate that the chemical composition of 

the ore fluids is dominated by NaCl?CaCl2?H2O. Three different fluid types are related to the 

Cu-Au mineralization stages: (1) early mineralization stage: hypersaline and warm fluids 

(homogenization temperatures &gt; 500 ºC) composed of NaCl–CaCl2–H2O, with a NaCl/(NaCl + 

CaCl2) ratio of 0.7; (2) main mineralization stage: low salinity fluids, with low homogenization 

temperatures (~ 150 ºC) composed of NaCl–CaCl2–H2O, with a NaCl/(NaCl + CaCl2) ratio of 

0.3; (3) late mineralization stage: saline fluids, with low homogenization temperatures (&amp;lt;250 °C) 

composed of NaCl-H2O (Carvalho 2009). 

 The early sodic–calcic alteration stage of the Sequeirinho orebody was characterized by 

temperatures exceeding 500 °C and ?
18

OH2O values for the hydrothermal fluid of 6.9±0.9‰ 

(Monteiro et al. 2008a), which are consistent with fluid inclusion evidences of participation of 

early hot (&gt;500 °C) brines (Carvalho 2009). Paragenetically later copper–gold mineralization 

displays markedly lower temperatures (&amp;lt;300 °C) and was characterized by the introduction of 

?
18

O-depleted (?1.8±3.4‰) hydrothermal fluids (Monteiro et al. 2007, Monteiro et al. 2008a).  



14 

 

 The ?DH2O and ?
18

OH2O values suggest that the fluids associated with the early sodic-calcic 

alteration assemblage were of magmatic or formational/metamorphic origin. Influx of ?
18

O-

depleted shallow-derived waters could be related to episodic fluid overpressure, resulting in 

dilution and cooling of the metalliferous fluid, causing deposition of metals transported as metal 

chloride complexes (Monteiro et al. 2007, Monteiro et al. 2008a, Carvalho 2009). 

 All Sossego orebodies show heavier sulfur (?
34

S=4.9±2.4‰) than expected for a mantle 

source (Monteiro et al. 2008a). According to Monteiro et al. (2008a) three possible sulfur sources 

were proposed for the Sossego paleo-hydrothermal system: (i) inorganically reduced Archean 

seawater sulfate/evaporate; (ii) inorganically reduced sulfate from continental evaporates; (iii) 

leached magmatic rocks or fluids from magmas that acquired most of their sulfur by assimilation 

of country rocks. However, the potential sulfur sources outlined above cannot be distinguished 

using the data set by Monteiro et al. (2008a). Calculated ?
13

CCO2 values for the Sossego–Curral 

and Sequeirinho mineralized breccias are ?4.3±1.8‰. This ?
13

CCO2 signature reflects values 

similar to those of the surrounding rocks. 

3. SAMPLING AND ANALYTICAL METHODS 

 The methods included detailed sampling and description of drill cores, petrography, 

scanning electron microscope analysis (SEM) and carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and sulfur stable 

isotope analysis. Petrography and scanning electron microscope analyses were performed at the 

Geosciences Institute, University of Campinas, Brazil. Electronic microscope analyses were 

performed in a SEM model LEO 430i equipped with an energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) 

and were used in the identification of heavy element-bearing minerals and mineral inclusions in 

polished thin sections. 

 Non-random mineral sampling for isotopic studies was carried out, looking for 

representative samples of each hydrothermal alteration stage. In an effort of characterize data 

representativity, error propagation analysis was performed (Bevington and Robinson 2002) over 

paleothermometric calculations and in Dfluid and 
18

Ofluid values estimated from the isotopic 

composition of hydrated minerals, when a paragenetic mineral pair was found. For samples 

without a paragenetic pair, temperature was estimated by mineral stability fields available in the 

literature. 



15 

 

 Mineral samples for stable isotope analysis were separated by crushing followed by mineral 

handpicking using a binocular magnifying glass. Carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions in 

calcite were determined at NEG-LABISE, Federal University of Pernambuco, Brazil, using the 

conventional digestion method (McCrea 1950). Powdered samples were reacted with H3PO4 at 25 

°C to release the CO2.  The ?
13

C and ?
18

O values were measured on cryogenically cleaned CO2 

(Craig 1957) in a triple collector SIRA II mass spectrometer. Borborema Skarn Calcite (BSC), 

calibrated in relation to international standards, was used as the reference gas and reproducibility 

of the measurements was better than ±0.1‰.  

 Sulfur, hydrogen and oxygen analyses were performed at the SUERC, University of 

Glasgow, Scotland. Sulfur isotopic analyses were based on the standard techniques of Robinson 

and Kusakabe (1975), using a Micromass SIRA-11 mass spectrometer for measuring the SO2 gas. 

The ion beams monitored were m/zz 66 and 64, with standard correction factors applied to raw 

?
16

S ratios (eg. Craig 1957). Long term reproducibility was better than ±0.2‰, based on repeated 

analyses of internal international and international standards. Hydrogen and oxygen analyses 

were performed using standard techniques. 

 Samples selected for hydrogen isotopic analysis had the amount of 30-50 mg of hydrogen 

extracted by heating samples under vacuum to release bound hydrogen, mostly as water vapor. 

Water was then converted to hydrogen by reaction with hot uranium. Samples were placed into 

platinum crucibles that had previously been heated under vacuum to 1500 °C for more than 3 

hours, and the sample plus crucible was evacuated and degassed at 120 °C overnight prior to 

hydrogen extraction. The hydrogen produced was delivered to a mercury manometer by a 

Toepler pump and the yield determined by comparing the starting weight of mineral with the 

micromoles of gas produced. The extracted hydrogen was analyzed using a VG Micromass 602B 

mass spectrometer, with a working standard calibrated against international standards: NBS30 

gives ?D = -65‰. Estimated precision is ±2% for ?D analyses. 

 Oxygen isotopic analyses of silicate minerals were made by extracting oxygen from 

samples of ~1 mg weight using a laser fluorination system based on that of Sharp (1990). Oxygen 

was released from the samples by heating them with a CO2 laser whilst inside a ClF3-charged 

chamber. The oxygen was then converted to CO2 and analyzed on a VG PRISM III mass 

spectrometer. In this technique each sample is reacted to completion so that the entire oxygen is 

collected, and as a result no laser correction factor is required. The analytical precision of the 



16 

 

laser fluorination technique is similar to the conventional fluorination technique at ±0.2‰, and 

gives good reproducibility regardless of sample grain size.  

4. ALVO BACABA AND ALVO CASTANHA GEOLOGICAL SETTING 

 The Alvo Bacaba and Alvo Castanha deposits are still on evaluation by the VALE 

Company and estimation on tonnage and metal content were not available until this publication. 

Previous studies on these deposits (Augusto et al. 2008, Pestilho and Monteiro 2008, Moreto 

2009, Moreto et al. 2011) and new data on host rocks, hydrothermal alteration and ore 

paragenetic relationships are presented below.  

 

 

HOST ROCKS 

 In the Alvo Bacaba and Alvo Castanha area and its vicinities, strong mylonitization and 

hydrothermal alteration of the host rocks resulted in the almost complete obliteration of the 

original rock textures.  

 The Alvo Bacaba deposit, located within the Transition Domain, is hosted by the Serra 

Dourada Granite (2858 ± 30 Ma U-Pb zircon, Moreto et al. 2011), the Bacaba Tonalite (3004 ± 

7,8 Ma U-Pb zircon, Moreto et al. 2011) and gabbro bodies. The Serra Dourada Granite is light 

grayish pink with a predominant isotropic structure, coarse to medium equigranular texture with 

crystal sizes from 4 to 8 mm, which are mainly composed of quartz (~40%), white plagioclase 

(~30%), light red alkali feldspar (~20%), amphibole (~5%) and biotite (~5%). Accessory 

minerals include pyrite and magnetite. Micrographic textures and pegamatic facies (Figure 3A) 

of restrict occurrence have been recognized, as well as expressive disequilibrium textures related 

to hydrothermal alteration pervasive fronts. Veins and veinlets crosscut throughout the host rock 

(Figure 3B, 3E), sometimes showing open-space filling textures (eg. comb texture), especially 

close to the copper ore zones.  Mylonitic foliation is typical of well developed pervasive 

hydrothermal alteration zones. 

 The Bacaba Tonalite (Figures 3C, 3D) is gray, isotropic to strongly foliated, medium-

grained, has equigranular texture with crystal sizes from 1 to 8 mm and is composed of quartz 

(~40%), white plagioclase (~35%), amphibole (~10%), biotite (~10%) and light red alkali 

feldspar (~5%). Also the Bacaba Tonalite shows similar hydrothermal textures to those of the 



17 

 

Serra Dourada Granite, and it is difficult to distinguish each other in the intensely altered zones 

(Figure 3F).

 The Alvo Castanha is mainly hosted by hydrothermally altered subvolcanic acid rocks of 

rhyolitic to rhyodacitic composition, here named as the Castanha feldspar-quartz porphyry 

(Figure 4B). This rock has a black or dark gray colour and when least-altered is composed of 

quartz (~45%), plagioclase (~5%), potassium feldspar (~35%), and fine-grained biotite (~10%), 

even though this proportion varies with the intensity of hydrothermal alteration. These 

hydrothermally altered rocks can be distinguished by the presence of quartz megacrystals (Figure 

4F) that show euhedral to sub-euhedral bipiramidal habit with 0.5 to 3 mm in length, which often 

exhibit features similar to corrosion gulfs. Quartz megacrystals commonly present blue colour 

due to tiny ilmenite inclusions identified using SEM.  Inclusion-rich quartz rims with optical 

continuity with the megacrystal core (Pestilho and Monteiro 2008) commonly are partially 

replaced by hydrothermal biotite or potassium feldspar. Plagioclase also occurs as megacrystals 



18 

 

within the rock matrix, especially in the most preserved and distal portions in relation to the 

copper ore bodies. These plagioclase megacrystals show sub-euhedral habit with albite or 

chessboard twining (Figure 4D) and 1 to 3.5 mm in length.  

 The matrix of the Castanha feldspar-quartz porphyry shows fine-grained phaneritic texture 

with crystals size from 0.1 to 1 mm in length composed of quartz, alkali feldspar and 

subordinated biotite. Higher biotite content is observed in mylonitized samples, evidencing S–C 

structures accompanied with crystal stretching and comminuting of quartz and other mineral 

phases, including scapolite and biotite (Pestilho and Monteiro 2008). 

 Intrusive basic rocks (Figure 4A) occur in both deposits (Augusto et al. 2008, Pestilho and 

Monteiro 2008). These are represented by isotropic gabbro with dark green colour and medium- 

to fine-grained phaneritic textures. Gabbros of both deposits can be precisely characterized in 

relatively preserved sections due to the identification of sub-ophitic to ophitic textures (Figures 

4C and 4E).  However, under the microscope its composition consists essentially of 

hydrothermally alterated minerals, such as interstitial amphibole and epidote around plagioclase 

plates replaced by albite and scapolite. Magnetite and remains of ilmenite are the typical 

accessory minerals. Augusto et al. (2008) described scheelite inclusions into magnetite crystals in 

the Alvo Bacaba gabbro.  

 The contact between gabbro and hydrothermally altered granitoids in the Alvo Bacaba, in 

some cases, is characterized by intense hydrothermal alteration in both rocks concomitant to the 

ductile shear zones development (Augusto et al. 2008). Nevertheless, at the deposit vicinity 

metagabbro enclaves inside the Bacaba Tonalite was identified. In the Alvo Castanha the contact 

between the gabbro and the Castanha feldspar-quartz porphyry is not clear while observed in drill 

core samples.  

 In minor proportion, brown to reddish acid intrusive rock dykes also occur in both deposits 

crosscutting all the host rocks, including the Castanha quartz-feldspar porphyry. These rocks in 

the Alvo Bacaba deposit are designated as quartz-feldspar porphyry (Augusto et al. 2008), and 

have restrict occurrence and variable degree of deformation and hydrothermal alteration. It also 

presents porphyritic texture with bipiramidal quartz megracrystals and euhedral feldspar crystals. 

This quartz-feldspar porphyry occurs in the Alvo Castanha as small dykes intensely 

hydrothermally altered, not foliated, with restricted occurrence and composed of fine-grained 

biotite and quartz.

PARAGENETIC RELATIONSHIPS 

 Successive hydrothermal alteration stages have been characterized in the Alvo Bacaba and 

Alvo Castanha deposits and the paragenetic evolution of each deposit is summarized in Figure 5. 

Except the sodic-calcic alteration and expressive magnetite bodies, which are well developed 

only in the Alvo Castanha deposit, a similar paragenetic succession could be recognized in the 

two deposits.

21 

 

 

Albite Alteration 

 Albite alteration represents the earliest hydrothermal alteration stage for both Alvo Bacaba 

(Figure 6A) and Alvo Castanha (Figure 6B) deposits, even though later albite veins and veinlets 

were also reported. In all major host rocks, hydrothermal albite generally presents white to 

pinkish colour, due to hematite microinclusions.  

 Under microscopy, hydrothermal albite crystals can be distinguished from igneous 

plagioclase because they have cleaner aspect and/or show distinct twinning and textures from that 

of igneous origin. Hydrothermal albite crystals occur as sub-euhedral crystals, generally with 

albite (Figure 7A) or chessboard twinning (Figure 7B). In most cases, albite twinning does not 

show a regular pattern of lamellas, such as in fan texture, especially observed in late veinlets.  

 Both deposits show albitization strongly obliterated by late alteration stages. Initial albite 

alteration seems to have been pervasive and it was subsequently replaced by scapolite, biotite, 

epidote, calcite and chlorite in both deposits. Additionally, substitution by apatite and fluorite 

was reported in the Alvo Castanha samples.  

 In the Alvo Bacaba deposit, late hydrothermal albite is associated with ore minerals, such 

as chalcopyrite, and replaces potassium feldspar (Augusto et al. 2008). Late albite in the Alvo 

Castanha deposit occurs in vein and veinlets, sometimes without twinning, and is associated with 

chlorite, titanite and carbonate minerals. These veinlets were seldom observed associated with 

pyrite and chalcopyrite unlike the Alvo Bacaba samples. In this case, albite replaced potassium 

feldspar and scapolite, and it was substituted by sericite (Pestilho and Monteiro 2008). 



22 

 

 

Scapolite Alteration 

 Scapolite is associated mainly with fissural-controlled alteration and associated veinlets, 

veins and stockworks. These zones of scapolite alteration can be very extensive and they often 

result in erroneous interpretation of pervasive alteration zones, although disseminated scapolite 

are also common. Scapolite occurs as fibrous crystals oriented along the mylonitic foliation, 

showing kinematic indicators and, sometimes, undulatory extinction as observed in coarse-

grained scapolite crystals from the Alvo Bacaba. 

 Scapolite in the Alvo Bacaba is of widespread occurrence and was developed in, at least, 

two vein generations.  Reddish scapolite veins (up to 10 m in width) were crosscut by white 

scapolite veins with up to 20 cm in width. Under the microscope, the first scapolite generation 

(SCPI) is represented by coarse-grained fibrous or prismatic crystals with low birefringence, 

typical of marialite, associated with quartz, magnetite, fluorite and epidote. Veins with SCPI were 

crosscut by irregular zones of a late scapolite generation (SCPII), which is fine-grained, 

marialitic, and strongly oriented along foliation (Figure 7C). Locally, SCPII composes the matrix 

around SCPI fragments. Scapolite from veins (SCPI and SCPII) was partially replaced by alkali 

feldspar, biotite and sericite.  Uranium and thorium minerals, such as haiweeite 

[Ca[(UO2)2Si5O12(OH)2]•3(H2O)] and calciothorite [(Th,Ca2)SiO4•3.5H2O], also fill fractures 

between fibrous scapolite crystals. 

 In the Alvo Castanha, scapolite occurs in veins and in biotite-rich altered zones (as seen in 

Figure 6B).  In veins, scapolite and fluorite commonly occur in textural equilibrium and are also 

associated with chalcopyrite and pyrite. Within biotite-rich altered zones, scapolite crystals occur 

along the foliation as deformed crystals with pressure shadows. Commonly the crystals are zoned 

showing calcic cores and marialitic rims. Late alteration stages with alkali feldspar, sericite, 

biotite, actinolite (Figure 7D), calcite, and chlorite crosscut scapolite-rich zones. 



23 

 

 

Sodic-calcic Alteration 

 Sodic-calcic alteration is associated with actinolite and hastingsite formation. It is a 

characteristic and selective alteration of gabbros with subophitic to ophitic textures observed in 

the Alvo Bacaba (Augusto et al. 2008) and Alvo Castanha (Pestilho and Monteiro 2008) deposits.  

In these rocks, hastingsite replaces relicts of igneous augite and occurs in the interstitial spaces 

between albitized plagioclase laths, which were also partially replaced by clinozoisite. Sodic-

calcic alteration is overprinted by potassic alteration and actinolite is replaced by biotite and 

crosscut by K-feldspar veinlets. Sodic-calcic alteration was also recognized in distal areas in 

relation to the main copper orebodies in the Alvo Castanha deposit and show close spatial 

relationship with magnetite-rich zones (Figure 6D). In those zones, actinolite occurs in at least 

three distinct associations and compose intensely altered zones, in which amphibole represents 

the main mineral phase, named as actinolitite zone.  These associations include: 

 ACTI – Coarse-grained actinolite crystals (1 to 3 mm in lenght) associated with clinozoisite 

that replace scapolite (Figure 7D), albite and bipiramidal quartz megacrystals of the Castanha 

Porphyry.  

 ACTII – Fine-grained actinolite crystals (up to 1 mm in lenght) that partially replace ACTI 

(Figure 7F), scapolite and apatite and, in turn, are associated with biotite, which shows straight 

boundaries with actinolite crystals. Also actinolite and biotite occur oriented along the same 

foliation. ACTII occurs associated with hastingsite in two associations: actinolite + biotite + 

hastingsite or actinolite + hastingsite.  

 ACTIII – Coarse-grained actinolite crystals with sizes from 1 to 3 mm in lenght also occur 

in veinlets and veins with comb texture that crosscut ACTII association. 

 These distinct associations from the Alvo Castanha deposit were formed in an early 

alteration stage (ACTI), synchronous to potassic alteration with biotite (ACTII), and in a later 

alteration stage (ACTIII). Furthermore, some magnetite crystals with scattered occurrence seem 

to show straight contacts with actinolite crystal from ACTIII, although actinolite generally occurs 

partially replaced by magnetite, chalcopyrite and associated minerals. 



24 

 

 

Potassic Alteration (Alkali Feldspar) 

 Hydrothermal K-feldspar is associated with either pervasive or fissural alteration styles in 

both Alvo Bacaba (Figure 6C) Alvo Castanha (Figure 6F) deposits. Potassium feldspar occurs 

as sub-euhedral crystals without any twinning and/or with microcline twinning, being also 

partially or completly sericitized. Alkali feldspar crystals exhibit association with very fine 

hematite crystals, smaller than 10 ?m, that show ruby-red internal reflexes under reflected light 

and occur as scattered clusters between the feldspar crystals and in fractures within the alkali 

feldspar crystal boundaries.   

 Veins and veinlets with alkali feldspar crosscut zones with albite, scapolite and some 

magnetite veins, being generally prior to the main ore formation stage. Within pervasive potassic 

alteration zones, scapolite crystals are partially replaced by alkali feldspar. Also in these zones 

alkali feldspar was partially replaced by biotite from a clear later pervasive alteration. 

Commonly, feldspar occurs intensely sericitized. 

 Structurally-controlled potassic alteration zones in the Alvo Bacaba deposit associated to 

mylonitic foliation is represented by K-feldspar associated with rutile or with calcite ± 

musketovite (hematite replaced by magnetite) ± hematite ± chalcopyrite. Also at Alvo Bacaba, 

alkali feldspar veins and veinlets commonly show an external halo with chlorite and calcite.  

 In both Alvo Bacaba and Alvo Castanha deposits, late veins and veinlets with K-feldspar 

also crosscut biotite-rich zones, and in some cases these feldspar crystals were also replaced by 

biotite (Figure 6E). 



25 

 

Potassic Alteration with Biotite 

 Biotite-rich potassic alteration occurs in very extensive and pervasive zones (Figure 6 and 

Figure 8). Disseminated biotite occurs as brown lamellar crystals, mainly sub-euhedral, with 

sizes from 1 ?m, associated with quartz, magnetite, alkali feldspar, scapolite (Figures 9A and 

9B), zircon and rarely chalcopyrite and pyrite in pervasive alteration zones. 

 In the proximal areas from the pyrrhotite-rich copper ore from the Alvo Castanha, there is a 

common association of biotite and brown stilpnomelane. Also in the Alvo Castanha, biotite is 

associated wtih actinolite and hastingsite (ACTII). The relationship between actinolite and biotite 

suggests that some crystals formed in textural equilibrium, so that some biotite crystals show 

straight boundaries with actinolite crystals (Pestilho and Monteiro 2008).  

 Generaly, fine-grained biotite crosscut and replaces scapolite-rich rocks as well as potassic 

altered zones with K-feldspar. However, late alkali feldspar veins also crosscuts biotite-rich 

zones. Late biotite veins with coarser crystals (up to 1 mm in lenght) associated with quartz 

(Figure 8B) are also typical of both deposits, and generally they crosscut pervasive zones with 

fine-grained disseminated biotite.

calcite, Kfs – alkali feldspar, Cpy – chalcopyrite, Qtz – quartz, Ser – sericite, Scp – 

scapolite. 

 

 

Tourmaline Formation 

 The association between biotite and subeuhedral dark greenish-blue tourmaline (Figures 

9C and 9D) is common, especially in distal biotite-rich zones relative to the Castanha orebodies. 

Nevertheless, the higher tourmaline content (up to 30% molar volume) was reported in the Alvo 

Bacaba deposit by Augusto et al. (2008) in altered zones developed along the mylonitic foliation. 

In those zones, tourmaline occurs associated with scapolite (SCPI and SCPII) and reveal mutual 

replacement by biotite.  

 

Chloritic Alteration 

 In the Alvo Bacaba, chlorite replaces disseminated biotite from pervasive potassic 

alteration zones and it occurs in veinlets crosscutting alkali feldspar, albite, biotite, scapolite 

(Figure 8A) and amphibole. It is remarkable that some minerals were totally replaced by chlorite 

polymorphs, while others stood almost completely preserved in the same associations. That is the 

case of scapolite crystals that generally occurs chloritized associated with non-altered biotite.   

 

Sericitic Alteration 

 Sub-euhedral to anhedral sericite crystals occur associated with quartz ± alkali feldspar 

(Figure 8C) and rarely in association with chalcopyrite and biotite. Sericite veinlets also crosscut 

the biotite ± quartz ± scapolite (Figure 8D) association.  Sericite alteration at Alvo Castanha 

was less expressive than in the Alvo Bacaba and developed mainly in distal areas from the 

pyrrhotite-rich copper mineralized zones, whereas in proximal to the magnetitite bodies, sericite 

occurs associated to alkali feldspar ± magnetite. 

 



27 

 

Carbonate and Epidote Alteration 

 Rare late calcite veinlets and veins (calcite ± alkali feldspar ± musketovite ± hematite 

(Figure 9E) or only calcite ± hematite) are recognized in the Alvo Bacaba deposit. 

 In the Alvo Castanha, pervasive and fissure-controlled carbonate alteration was more 

widespread than in the Alvo Bacaba.  In veins and veinlets (Figure 9F), calcite is associated with 

sulfides ± epidote ± chlorite and occur cutting through all the previous minerals. Pervasive 

carbonate alteration is closely related to pyrrhotite-rich copper orebodies. Calcite, REE-bearing 

carbonates, and epidote also occur in breccia matrix enclosing magnetite, chalcopyrite and pyrite 

in distal zones from the pyrrhotite-rich copper orebodies. 

 

Iron Oxide Formation 

 Iron oxides occur in distinct associations in both Alvo Bacaba and Alvo Castanha deposits, 

evidencing that these hydrothermal oxides were not formed in a single event. These iron oxide 

associations represent the main distinguishing feature between these deposits, besides the copper 

ore characteristics.  

 In the Alvo Bacaba, early magnetite occurs as euhedral to sub-euhedral crystals infilling 

fractures in scapolite (SCPI) crystals from veins and along the mylonitic foliation as elongated 

magnetite crystals. In intensely mylonitized scapolite zones, magnetite relics occur as smaller 

xenomorphic crystals associated to Fe-Ti-(Mn) oxides and goethite. In this deposit, a large 

amount of disseminated magnetite associated with alkali feldspar replaced the host rocks, 

forming magnetitites, which are in turn crosscut by K-feldspar veinlets.   

 In the Bacaba ore bodies, lamellar musketovite has been identified, suggesting that previous 

hematite was replaced by magnetite resulting in a pseudomorph. Some hematite crystals were 

totally replaced by magnetite, as well as musketovite. However, late hematite is also observed 

along fracture or rims of the musketovite crystals. Euhedral hematite lamellas in straight contact 

with chalcopyrite are also associated with the Alvo Bacaba ore. 

 In the Alvo Castanha, minor magnetite occurs associated with scapolite veins. Magnetite 

also occurs as sub-euhedral to euhedral crystals associated with chalcopyrite and pyrite in distal 

veinlets from the main mineralized zones. However, larger amounts of magnetite occur as 

disseminated crystals associated with chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite within carbonate altered and 

mineralized zones.  



28 

 

 In distal portions of the Alvo Castanha deposit in relation to the main pyrrhotite-rich 

orebodies, magnetite-rich zones are associated with sodic-calcic alteration, mainly with 

actinolitite bodies. These zones are represented by magnetite in different associations: (I) 

disseminated fine-grained sub-euhedral crystals associated with the least-altered Castanha 

Porphyry or associated with actinolitites; or (II) magnetite (up to 85%) associated with apatite + 

monazite ± actinolite ± chlorite ± calcite ± biotite ± pyrite ± chalcopyrite forming massive 

magnetitite bodies, as seen in Figures 7D and 8B.  

 In the association (I), disseminated magnetite partially replaces actinolite, and also 

magnetite crystals occur with straight boundaries with actinolite crystals, whereas in the 

association (II), calcite and chlorite fill fractures in magnetite crystals and replces apatite. Apatite 

is partially replaced by stilpnomelane, which in turn occur in straight contacts with monazite. 

Magnetite in the association (II) is later than all other hydrothermal mineral phases, except 

chlorite and stilpnomelane.  

 

Silicification 

 Silicification occurs in both deposits as a pervasive and mainly fissural style of alteration. 

Different generations of quartz veins and veinlets are composed of crystals with sizes from &amp;lt;1 

mm to about 1 cm or more, and associated with: (I) early albite, scapolite and biotite; (II) late 

sericite; and (III) pyrite and chalcopyrite. 

 Pervasive silicification zones overprint early albitization in the Alvo Bacaba host rocks. In 

the Alvo Castanha, pervasive silicification zones are associated with biotite from potassic 

alteration, or combined with chalcopyrite that occur disseminated in the magnetite and actinolite-

rich bodies.

Copper Ore Zone 

 In the Alvo Bacaba, sulfides occur as veinlets, veins and mineralized breccias (Figures 

10A and 10B) in structurally-controlled replacement zones up to 30-cm thick along the mylonitic 

foliation. Chalcopyrite (Figure 10C) represents the principal ore mineral and occurs associated 

with bornite (Figure 10D) and pyrite.  

 Mineralized zones show spatial relationship with zones of potassic alteration with alkali 

feldspar, which is crosscut by mineralized veins with chalcopyrite accompanied by chlorite, 

calcite, epidote, clinozoisite, allanite, apatite, monazite, rutile, magnetite/musketovite (Figure 

10E), and hematite (Figure 10F). Commonly, a thin albite-rich halo (up to 1 mm) separated the 

K-feldspar crystals from the crosscutting sulfides. 

 Melonite (NiTe2) and altaite (PbTe) are important accessory phases of the Bacaba 

mineralized zones, which fill fractures or represent mineral inclusions into chalcopyrite or gangue 

minerals. Other accessory minerals are represented by galena, uraninite, hessite, cheralite 

[CaTh(PO4)2], olsacherite (Pb2SO4SeO4), and tsumoite (BiTe), which occur as thin inclusions in 

chalcopyrite. Hessite occurs associated with melonite in chalcopyrite edges, whereas olsacherite 

were identified as needles in fractures walls within chalcopyrite crystals (Augusto et al. 2008). 

 In the Alvo Castanha, the copper orebodies occur with two distinct associations: (I) 

chalcopyrite (up to 75%) + pyrite (up to 25%) + molybdenite + quartz + monazite + magnetite, 

which occur associated with the magnetite and actinolitite bodies; (II) chalcopyrite + pyrrhotite + 

pyrite + sphalerite + marcasite in the richest and more extensive ore bodies. 

 The ore association (I) occurs mainly in veins and veinlets that crosscut the hydrothermally 

altered Castanha Porphyry, and in magnetitite or actinolitite or within structurally-controlled 

breccias with magnetitite fragments and magnetite crystals. Chalcopyrite-epidote-magnetite-

allanite veinlets also crosscut sodic-calcic alteration. In contrast with association (II), in the 

association (I) there is no occurrence of large amount of calcite with the ore bodies, and calcite 

occurs as a minor phase associated with epidote and accessory minerals. 

 In the main mineralized zone of the Alvo Castanha deposit, ore occurs in veins, veinlets, 

stockwork and breccias (Figure 10G and 10H). Transition zones between vein stockwork and 

breccia zones have matrix composed of ore minerals. Mineralized breccias are also structurally-

controlled and present deformed clasts of altered host rocks. The estimated mineral abundances 



31 

 

in association (II) are chalcopyrite (~ 35%), pyrite (~15%; Figure 10I) and pyrrhotite (~50%; 

Figure 10J).   

 Also in the mineralized zone with the association (II), veins and veinlets are composed of 

sub-euhedral to euhedral pyrite crystals, generally associated with chalcopyrite, quartz, calcite, 

albite, scapolite, Cl-apatite, fluorite, and magnetite. In the breccias matrix, pyrrhotite occurs 

associated with chalcopyrite, pyrite, sphalerite (Figure 10K), and minor marcasite. However, 

direct contact between pyrite and pyrrhotite was not observed. The breccia lithic clasts within the 

ore breccia comprises host rocks replaced by biotite, chlorite, allanite, stilpnomelane, calcite and 

REE-bearing carbonate minerals. Allanite occurs as zoned euhedral crystals included in 

pyrrhotite and calcite, and it is rarely found chloritized. 

 In the mineralized zone from association (II) it was also identified a variety of accessory 

minerals that includes: uraninite, galena, monazite [(Ce,La,Nd)0.94P1.04O4], pentlandite, Co-

pentlandite [(Ni,Co,Fe)9.20S8.39], Pd-melonite [(Fe,Ni,Pd)0.31Te0.61], sugakiite 

[Cu0.66(Fe,Ni)8.4S8.42], Ni-pyrite [(Fe,Ni)0.79S1.72], molybdenite (Mo0.34S2.06). Co-pentlandite and 

pentlandite are commonly associated with pyrrhotite and occur as inclusions or at the pyrrhotite 

crystal edges, where they have granular or flame textures (Figure 10L). Pd-melonite was 

observed as thin crystals included in pyrrhotite. Uraninite occurs in both host rock clasts and as 

small (~1 ?m) anhedral inclusion in sulfides. Similarly galena occurs as small anhedral crystals 

(~1 ?m) disseminated in the lithic fragments within the breccias in the mineralized zones, and 

rarely occurs associated with sphalerite. Monazite was observed in the Cl-apatite edges, whereas 

euhedral molybdenite crystals occur as inclusion in Cl-apatite and allanite (Pestilho and Monteiro 

2008).

 The ?DV-SMOW values were obtained for hydrated minerals, including actinolite (AC – -

104.0‰ to -99.0‰, n=2), biotite (AB – -104.0‰ to -84.0‰, n=2;    AC – -100.0‰ to -86.0‰, 

n=2), and sericite (AB – -52.0‰, n=2; AC – -69.0‰, n=1).  

 Actinolite and magnetite were sampled from the actinolite + magnetite association (ACTII) 

from the Alvo Castanha deposit. In this deposit, magnetite was also sampled from magnetitite 

bodies associated with the main iron oxide formation stage. 

 Biotite and associated quartz were sampled in both deposits and are related with potassic 

alteration with biotite-rich zones. Sericite, quartz and alkali feldspar were also sampled in both 

deposits from the association sericite ± quartz ± alkali feldspar, which represent the sericite 

alteration stage. 

 Additionally, calcite, alkali feldspar, hematite and/or musketovite were sampled from the 

associations: (1) veins with alkali feldspar ± hematite/musketovite ± chalcopyrite; (2) veins with 

calcite that crosscut alkali feldspar ± hematite/musketovite ± chalcopyrite; (3) calcite veins with 

calcite and hematite/musketovite; (4) veins with calcite associated or not with quartz ± 

chalcopyrite; (5) veins with calcite and biotite. The calcite from associations (1), (2), and (3) 

were sampled in veins from Alvo Bacaba, whereas the associations (4) and (5) were sampled in 

the Alvo Castanha deposit.  

 In the Alvo Bacaba the association (1) was previous (or partially coeval) to the main 

mineralization event, while the associations (2) and (3) were possibly late to the main 

mineralization event. In the Alvo Castanha, the association (4) is possibly synchronous or later to 



39 

 

ore deposition, whereas the association (5) is associated with magnetitites and might be previous 

or concomitant to the mineralization stage.

 Oxygen isotopic compositions of the hydrothermal fluid in equilibrium with analysed 

mineral phases were estimated based on calculated temperatures. These values (Table 5) were 

calculated based on oxygen isotopic fractionation factors between mineral–H2O for the following 

minerals: magnetite–H2O (Zheng 1991), hematite–H2O (Zheng 1991), alkali feldspar–H2O 

(Zheng 1993a), quartz–H2O (Zheng 1993a), actinolite–H2O (Zheng 1993b), biotite–H2O (Zheng 

1993b), muscovite–H2O (Zheng 1993b), calcite–H2O (Zheng 1994).  



40 

 

 The hydrogen isotopic composition of the hydrothermal fluid was calculated using the 

isotopic fractionation factors for biotite–H2O (Suzuoki and Epstein 1976), muscovite– H2O 

(Suzuoki and Epstein 1976), and actinolite–H2O (Graham et al. 1984).

 From Tables 4 and 5, the ?
18

OH2O and ?DH2O values were calculated from isotopic data 

measured in hydrated minerals from both deposits (see Table 6) and these results are shown in 

Figure 11 with special emphasis on different alteration stages. 

 For the calculation of ?
13

Cfluid from calcite, we assumed that carbon was speciated as 

H2CO3 during ore formation and that H2CO3 isotopically behaves like CO2. The isotopic 

fractionation factor for carbon between calcite and CO2 of Ohmoto and Rye (1979) was used to 

calculate the carbon isotopic composition of the fluid. 

 

Table 6 – Calculated oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition of fluids in equilibrium with hydrated 

minerals and associated error. Note: 
a

and it considers analytical error of 0.2‰ for oxygen and 2‰ for hydrogen. Values with * were calculated 

using empirical estimates of temperature, even though it considers analytical error.

Estimated isotopic composition for fluids responsible for the pervasive sodic-calcic 

alteration, associated with actinolitite and magnetitite formation in the Alvo Castanha, 

corresponds to ?
18

OH2O = 7.7 ± 0.5‰ and ?DH2O = -72 ± 2‰ at 345 ± 25°C. The hydrothermal 

fluid associated with alkali feldspar from potassic alteration have ?
18

OH2O = 6.2 ± 1.0‰ for the 

Alvo Bacaba and ?
18

OH2O = 5.6 ± 0.7‰ for the Alvo Castanha deposit, at the temperature range 

of 450 ± 50°C, which was taken to be close to that suggested for formation of feldspar-rich 

molecule orthoclase and anorthite-poor (500 °C), formed in subsolvus conditions (Brown and 

Parlsons 1989). Also, in the Alvo Castanha deposit, magnetite associated with alkali feldspar was 

formed from fluids with ?
18

OH2O = 6.0 ± 0.3‰ at 450 ± 50°C. 

 For the Alvo Bacaba deposit, the fluid in equilibrium with biotite and quartz, associated 

with the potassic alteration with biotite, has lower ?
18

OH2O values (5.1 ± 0.3‰) and ?DH2O of -51 

± 11‰ at 420 ± 10 
o
C. Similar oxygen isotopic composition was estimated for chloritized biotite 

(?
18

OH2O = 5.1 ± 0.3‰), in the same temperature range. 

 In the Alvo Castanha, potassic alteration with biotite and quartz was developed from 

hydrothermal fluids with the estimated composition range: (Bt I) with lower values of ?
18

OH2O 

(7.5 ± 0.4‰) and ?DH2O (-59 ± 3‰) at 440 ± 20 °C; and (Bt II) with slightly higher values of 

?
18

OH2O (8.1 ± 0.3‰) and (?DH2O = -54 ± 2‰) at 525 ± 25 °C.  

 For Alvo Bacaba, the fluid associated with sericite alteration, at 370 ± 50°C, have two 

isotopic composition intervals; (SI) with ?
18

OH2O = 3.4 ± 1.4‰, and (SII) with ?
18

OH2O = 7.1 ± 

0.7‰, with a similar hydrogen isotopic composition (?DH2O = -17 ± 8‰) for both (SI) and (SII). 

In the Alvo Castanha, sericite alteration was developed at higher temperature from hydrothermal 

fluids with ?
18

OH2O = 7.1 ± 0.7‰ at 500 ± 50°C (SIII); and ?
18

OH2O = 8.7 ± 0.3‰ and ?DH2O = -55 

± 2‰ at 525 ± 25°C (SIV). 

 Carbonate alteration occurs associated with fluids with distinct isotopic composition in the 

two deposits. Higher

 Associated hematite and musketovite (HI), selected in the Alvo Bacaba, formed from a 

fluid with estimated ?

OH2O = 4.1 ± 0.4‰ at 90 ± 10°C. Also in the Alvo Bacaba, hematite (HII) 

from calcite veins was in equilibrium with fluids with ?
18

OH2O = 0.4 ± 0.1‰ at 190 ± 40°C. For 

the Alvo Castanha, the estimated ?
18

OH2O values          (6.6 ± 0.3‰) in equilibrium with magnetite 

from alkali feldspar veins is similar to that of fluids associated with magnetite-actinolite and 

magnetite-calcite.  

 Even though no quartz sample in textural equilibrium with sulfides have been observed, 

quartz from late veins with respect to the ore deposition or/and the previous alterations had its 

isotopic composition measured. The isotopic composition of the fluid associated with this late 

silicification was estimated based on temperature ranges calculated for quartz associated with 

sericitization and potassic alteration with biotite. 

 Quartz that fills open spaces in sulfide veins from Alvo Bacaba might have formed from a 

fluid with ?
18

OH2O = 5.1 ± 0.8‰ at 415 ± 45°C, which is similar to the  isotopic composition of 

fluid in equilibrium with potassic alteration with biotite. In the same temperature range, late 

quartz veins from the Alvo Bacaba deposit, which crosscut pervasive potassic zones with biotite, 

display ?
18

OH2O = 5.1 ± 0.8‰ identical to the value of quartz associated with sulfides. The 

Figure 13 summarizes all estimates of fluid isotopic compositions described here.

6. SULFUR ISOTOPES 

 Sulfur isotopic analyses (Figure 14) were carried out on sulfides (chalcopyrite and 

pyrrhotite) associated with mineralized zones. The ?
34

SCDT values for the Alvo Bacaba deposit 

range from 1.3‰ to 5.4‰, while for Alvo Castanha vary from 0.1‰ to 3.0‰. Also chalcopyrite 

samples from other different copper deposits and occurrences of the Transition Domain were 

collected for comparison, including data from small irregular mines (1.2 to 1.5‰), Alvo Bacuri 

(0.8 to 1.1‰), Alvo Visconde (1.5‰), Pedra Branca and Alvo 118 deposits. Figure 15 shows 

these values compared with those available in the literature.

Province. Note: * – This study; 1 – Monteiro et al. (2007); 2 – Torresi et al. (2009). 

 

 The ?
34

S value for pyrrhotite sampled in Alvo Castanha directly reflects the fluid isotopic 

composition, because in redox and pH conditions of pyrrhotite precipitation all sulfur was 



48 

 

converted to H2S (Ohmoto 1972). Also, as observed in all sampled deposits, without sulfates, the 

sulfur isotopic composition of sulfides is meanly equal from that of the sulfur source (Ohmoto 

1972). Therefore the Figure 15 shows that the major Cristalino deposit, the minor copper 

deposits (Alvo Castanha, Alvo Bacuri, Alvo Visconde, Pedra Branca), as well as the minor 

irregular mines (designated as Garimpo Ponto 11, Garimpo Ponto 18 and Garimpo Ponto 41) 

located near the Sossego Mine show sulfur isotopic composition strictly within the magmatic 

signature field. However, the Alvo Bacaba, Alvo 118, and the Sossego deposits show higher ?
34

S 

values than those typical of magmatic source.

7. Discussion  

 

7.1. HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEM EVOLUTION, FLUIDS AND SULFUR SOURCES 

 The Alvo Bacaba and Alvo Castanha deposits share a similar evolution indicated by the 

sequence of hydrothermal alteration stages accompanied by relative decrease of ?
18

O values of 

the hydrothermal fluid and temperature. Nevertheless, according to mineral pair geothermometry 

and empirical estimations, the changes in temperature and ?
18

O values were not the same for both 

deposits.  

 The Alvo Bacaba shows more abrupt decrease in temperature accompanying the 

paragenetic succession in relation to the Alvo Castanha deposit. Also, the Alvo Castanha, with 

few exceptions, displays higher ?
18

O values of the hydrothermal fluid, and higher temperatures 

for the same hydrothermal alteration stages (eg. potassic alteration with biotite). Therefore the 

hydrothermal system in the Alvo Castanha area is marked by having evolved in conditions of 

higher temperature than the Alvo Bacaba.  

 Taking into account the paragenetic relationships in comparison to the temperature 

estimates (Figure 13) for the hydrothermal alteration stages, conditions for ore deposition may be 

inferred. The potassic alteration with biotite is earlier than the mineralization stage, whereas 

carbonatization is later in both deposits, suggesting that the mineralization stage in the Alvo 

Bacaba have occurred between 220 ° C and 410 ° C, while in the Alvo Castanha would have 

occurred between 350 ° C and 420 ° C. 

 Comparison of paragenetic evolution with the variation of ?
18

O and ?D values (Figure 11 

and Figure 13) shows distinctive fluid isotopic signatures in the hydrothermal system. Oxygen 

and hydrogen isotopic data for the Alvo Bacaba deposit suggest that at least two fluid sources 

have contributed to the system: (i) a magmatic source with high ?
18

O values; (ii) a non-magmatic 

source with low ?
18

O values, which tends to be close to the Standard Mean Ocean Water 

composition, as noted in Figure 11. It might suggest: (1) a system that evolved through mixing of 

two fluids, one corresponding to water with composition near that of ocean water and another 

with magmatic signature; (2) a system that evolved from a non-magmatic fluid, with signatures of 

meteoric or low latitude oceanic waters, which acquired magmatic signature from assimilation 

through fluid-rock interaction with the igneous host rocks.  

 The ?
18

O and ?D values for the Alvo Castanha deposit are close to those of the magmatic 

water field (Figure 11 and 13) with a slight variation in the sericite and carbonate alteration 



51 

 

stages. It suggests a possible fluid contribution from non-magmatic sources depleted in heavy 

isotopes (eg. meteoric/ocean waters). Nevertheless, considering the inherent error for estimating 

the temperature by geothermometry, the high temperatures of the system and the predominance 

of isotopic composition within the field of primary magmatic water suggest for the Alvo 

Castanha deposit a genesis related to magmatic hydrothermal system.  

 The ?
13

C values show that the mineralizing fluid from the Alvo Bacaba deposits was under 

conditions of oxygen fugacity (fO2) greater than those of the Alvo Castanha, in accordance with 

the association of ore minerals of each deposit (pyrrhotite-chalcopyrite at Alvo Castanha) and 

(chalcopyrite-bornite at Alvo Bacaba).  

 The ?
18

O versus ?
13

C values (Figure 12) for carbonates from Alvo Bacaba indicate a small 

increase in the fO2 during the hydrothermal system evolution, which is evidenced by a reduction 

in the ?
13

C value of the hydrothermal fluid, and an increase in the ?
18

O value possibly due to 

increased contribution of magmatic fluids.The ?
13

C values of the Alvo Castanha hydrothermal 

fluid indicate lower oxygen fugacity than that of the Alvo Bacaba. 

 The sulfide ?
34

S from both deposits show values near the composition of sulfur from 

magmatic source, but higher ?
34

S values for the Alvo Bacaba sulfides could be caused by mixing 

of sulfur from different sources, such as sulfates from meteoric/ocean waters or, alternatively, 

from assimilation of sulfur from host rocks.  

 

7.2. METALLOGENETIC IMPLICATIONS FOR THE SOSSEGO HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEM EVOLUTION 

 Geological and isotopic similarities among the Alvo Bacaba, Alvo Castanha and the 

Sossego orebodies might indicate that these deposits were formed in different portions of a single 

or similar hydrothermal systems.  

 From the standpoint of isotope geology, the evolution of the Alvo Bacaba, hosted by the 3.0 

Ga Bacaba Tonalite and 2.86 Ga Serra Dourada Granite (Moreto et al., 2011) is similar to that of 

the Sossego orebodies (Monteiro et al. 2008a). This evolution is characterized by a sudden 

reduction in temperature accompanied by decrease in ?
18

O and increasing ?D, which reflects a 

trend from a magmatic fluid signature to values close to those of ocean waters. The Alvo 

Castanha, which has predominance of nickel-enriched pyrrhotite-chalcopyrite breccias, however, 

shows magmatic sources for fluids, besides evidence of limited contribution from non-magmatic 

fluids. 



52 

 

 The ?
34

S values for Alvo Bacaba also show similarities with the Sossego orebodies (Figure 

15), except to Corpo Pista (Monteiro et al. 2008a). However, the Alvo Castanha and other copper 

deposits (Alvo Bacuri, Alvo Visconde, Pedra Branca) and occurrences (garimpos) located 

westward from the Sossego Mine, displays mainly sulfur with magmatic signature. This might 

indicate a regional E-W trend (Figures 16) with regional prevalence of fluids with magmatic 

sulfur source and influx of external fluids with non-magmatic sulfur components along NE faults. 

This trend relates to the highest tonnages and metal content with higher ?
34

S values, whereas the 

magmatic sulfur relates to the minor deposits with low metal content.  The exception is the 

world-class Cristalino deposit, which could represent an example of major magmatic-dominant 

IOCG deposit. 

 However, a magmatic source for hydrothermal fluids is yet unkown, in part due to lack of 

robust geochronological data in the Carajás IOCG deposits. The available data are insufficient to 

connect a specific magmatic event with the genesis of the IOCG deposits (Monteiro et al. 2008a, 

Xavier et al. 2010). Because all host rocks from Sossego and other deposits in its vicinities are 

igneous, all interpretations converge to the following assumptions: (1) There were fluids from 

two distinct sources: non-magmatic and magmatic; (2) the hydrothermal fluids were essentially 

from non-magmatic source and assimilated the isotopic characteristics of igneous source through 

interaction with igneous host rocks. 

 Both hypotheses have been addressed in studies on boron isotopes, which indicated that 

some IOCG deposits in the Carajás Mineral Province, such as Salobo and Igarapé Bahia, have 

mostly boron from non-magmatic source, while the Corpo Pista orebody from the Sossego 

deposit displays boron contribution of a possible magmatic origin (Xavier et al. 2008). 

Additionally, studies of boron isotopes combined with systematic study of the Cl/Br-Na/Cl ratios, 

suggest that the fluids responsible for formation of these deposits, including Sossego, involved 

significant contribution of residual fluid from evaporative source (eg. brines generated by 

evaporation of sea water) that may have mixed with fluids of magmatic origin (Xavier et al. 

2010). 

 Although controversial, due to the lack of geochronological data from ore genesis, the Alvo 

Castanha appears to be a magmatic end member, with a predominance of magmatic signature of 

oxygen, hydrogen, and sulfur. Also the Cl/Br-Na/Cl result obtained by R. P. Xavier (personal 

communication) for the Alvo Castanha points to a fluid of magmatic origin. Further, the Alvo 



53 

 

Bacaba data in comparison with data of the Sossego Mine (Monteiro et al., 2008a; Xavier et al., 

2010) reinforce the evidence that there was a seawater contribution, or more specifically, ocean 

brines. This corroborates with the idea that Sossego IOCG deposits have originated from a 

magmatic-hydrothermal system in a marine paleoenvironment. 

8. CONCLUSIONS 

 Despite the similarities of geological features, the Alvo Bacaba and Alvo Castanha deposits 

show distinct isotopic evolution of the hydrothermal systems. Both deposits have evolved with 

temperature decrease, but the temperature drop in relation to the hydrothermal alteration 

succession was greater in Alvo Bacaba than in the Alvo Castanha, and the oxygen fugacity was 

kept high at Alvo Bacaba during the process that culminated with ore deposition.  

 The ore deposition may have remained at similar temperature range, estimated for the Alvo 

Bacaba between 220 °C to 410 ° C, while the Alvo Castanha it would have occurred between 350 

° C and 420 ° C. The isotopic evolution of the Alvo Bacaba is similar to that of Sossego, with a 

steep temperature reduction accompanied by decrease of ?
18

O and increase in ?D values. This 

may suggest an evolving system with early fluids with magmatic isotopic signature that 

interacted with late fluids derived from ocean waters. This mixing process favors a broad range 

of sulfur composition from magmatic to non-magmatic sources. By contrast, the Alvo Castanha 

deposit appears to be an end member, with predominance of magmatic sources for both fluids 

and sulfur. 

 The correlation of these characteristics with those of Sossego strengthens the evidence that 

there was a contribution of magmatic and ocean waters in the hydrothermal system for the 

genesis of all these deposits.
