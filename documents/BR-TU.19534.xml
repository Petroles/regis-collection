resumo A contaminac?a?o de sedimentos tornou-se numa grande preocupac?a?o, uma

vez que pode originar contaminac?a?o nas a?guas e na cadeia alimentar.

Quando se pretende estimar os efeitos to?xicos no meio ambiente, as

medic?o?es de elementos qu??micos fornecem informac?a?o sobre quais esta?o

presentes e em que concentrac?o?es, mas na?o fornecem informac?a?o sobre

a possibilidade de estes serem biologicamente perigosos. Assim, os

bioensaios laboratoriais sa?o ferramentas fundamentais na determinac?a?o

da ecotoxicidade de um sedimento. Neste estudo foram levados a cabo

diversos bioensaios.

Numa primeira abordagem foram testados va?rios sedimentos, com a

finalidade de definir qual a melhor granulometria de sedimento a utilizar

nos testes de toxicidade, para a oligoqueta aqua?tica L. variegatus. Apesar

dos sedimentos finos terem mostrado os melhores resultados para a

sau?de e vitalidade da espe?cie em estudo, sedimentos ecologicamente mais

relevantes, tais como sedimentos “inteiros” devera?o ser utilizados tanto

nas culturas como nos ensaios de toxicidade.

Uma segunda abordagem teve como objectivo desenvolver novos testes

automa?ticos para toxicidade de sedimentos, utilizando L. variegatus como

espe?cie de estudo e o comportamento como novo para?metro em testes

padra?o. Foram testados diferentes to?xicos: um metal (chumbo) e um pesti-

cida (imidacloprid), representando dois grupos de qu??micos completamente

diferentes. Foram observadas diferenc?as substanciais no modo de acc?a?o

dos dois to?xicos testados. A exposic?a?o a sedimentos contaminados com

chumbo resultou em n??veis aceita?veis de sobrevive?ncia, o que significa que

ocorre acumulac?a?o do metal nos organismos, podendo haver transfere?ncia

para pro?ximas gerac?o?es e organismos de n??veis tro?ficos superiores. A

exposic?a?o ao pesticida, por seu lado, causou elevada mortalidade no ??nicio

da experie?ncia; contudo alguns organismos foram capazes de sobreviver

tanto como os organismos controlo.



Numa abordagem final foi efectuado um ensaio com sedimentos recolhidos

no campo. O objectivo foi avaliar a toxicidade de sedimentos provenientes

de uma mina abandonada de pirite cu?prica, medindo a mortalidade, cresci-

mento e comportamento de L. variegatus durante 10 dias. O local de

estudo escolhido foi a Mina de Sa?o Domingos (Sul de Portugal), um local

com grande potencial para estudos ecotoxicolo?gicos, devido a? existe?ncia de

um gradiente de pH e de metais provenientes da drenagem a?cida das minas.

Os resultados dos ensaios com L. variegatus indicam forte contaminac?a?o e

os elevados valores encontrados apontam tambe?m para contaminac?a?o sev-

era, o que pode revelar-se um factor limitante na recuperac?a?o ecolo?gica

daquela a?rea.



abstract Sediment contamination has become a great concern, since may lead to

water and food web contamination. When assessing the toxic effects in

the environment measurements of sediment chemicals provide information

on the existing pollutants and their concentrations, but do not provide in-

formation on whether or not these pollutants are biologically damaging.

Therefore, laboratory bioassays are a fundamental tool to determine the

ecotoxicity of the sediment. In the present study different ecotoxicological

tests were carried out.

Several sediments were tested to define the best grain-size to use in sedi-

ment toxicity tests, for the aquatic oligochaete L. variegatus. Although fine

sediment showed the best results for health and vitality of the study species,

ecologically relevant sediments such as whole sediments should be used on

both culture and toxicity tests.

In a second stage the purpose was to develop new automated sediment

toxicity tests using L. variegatus as a test species, with behaviour as a new

parameter to standard tests. Different toxics were tested: a metal (lead)

and a pesticide (imidacloprid), representing two completely different groups

of chemicals. Substantial differences in the action of the two tested toxics

were observed. Exposure to sediments contaminated with lead showed ac-

ceptable rates of survival, meaning that the metal can accumulate in the

organism and metal transfer can occur to next generations and organisms

from higher trophic levels. The pesticide caused high mortality at the be-

ginning of the experiment, however some organisms were able to live for as

long as control.

In a final stage, one assay with field-collected sediments was performed.

The purpose was to evaluate the toxicity of sediments from an abandoned

cupric pyrite mine, by measuring the 10-day mortality, growth and behaviour

of L. variegatus.

1.1 Sediments: definition and concerns

Sediments are dynamic environments with a wide range of interacting processes with variable

rates (US EPA - United States Environmental Agency, 2000a). According to the European

Sediment Research Network (SedNet, 2004a) sediments are suspended or deposited solids, of

mineral as well as organic nature, acting as a main component of a matrix, which has been,

or is susceptible to being transported by water. Sediments originate in river basins mainly

through land and channel erosion processes and are transported in river systems in the direction

of the coast, with the oceans being the final sink (SedNet, 2004a). The rate of mixing in

surficial sediment layers by physical processes such as turbulence and bioturbation competes

with the rate of sedimentation to determine the depth to which contaminated sediment will

be buried. Diffusion and resuspension can also have a large impact on the bioavailability of

sediment-associated contaminants either by re-exposing epibenthic filter feeders to contaminated

particulates or by increasing the aqueous concentration of a contaminant via desorption from

the particulates within the water column (US EPA, 2000a).

Sediment dynamics and gradients form favourable conditions for a large biodiversity (Sed-

Net, 2004a). In addition sediment provides habitat for many aquatic organisms and is a major

repository for many of the more persistent chemicals that are introduced into surface waters

(US EPA, 2000b). In the aquatic environment, most anthropogenic chemicals and waste ma-

terials including toxic organic and inorganic chemicals eventually accumulate in sediment (US

EPA, 2000b). From a contamination point of view, sediments are extremely important to the

food web and serve both as habitat for the benthic community and as contaminant reservoir

for bioaccumulation and trophic transfer (Burton and Landrum, 2003). Many contaminants go

into waters every day from industrial and municipal discharges, urban and agricultural runoff,

and atmospheric deposition from remote sources. Due to their physical and chemical properties

many of these substances tend to accumulate in sediments. In addition to providing sinks for

many chemicals, sediments can also serve as potential sources of pollutants to the water column

when conditions change in the receiving water system (e.g., during periods of anoxia, after severe

storms) (US EPA, 2002).

Since the industrial revolution, human-made chemicals have been emitted to surface wa-

ters and due to their properties many of these chemicals stick to sediment (SedNet, 2004a).

Sediment contamination features an important environmental concern and contaminated sedi-

ments have been demonstrated to be toxic to sediment-dwelling organisms and fish. Exposure

to contaminated sediments can result in decreased survival, reduced growth and/or impaired

reproduction in benthic invertebrates and fish. Additionally, certain sediment-associated con-

taminants (termed bioaccumulative substances) are taken up by benthic organisms through a

2

process called bioaccumulation. When larger animals feed on these contaminated prey species,

the pollutants are taken into their bodies and are passed along to other animals in the food web

in a process call biomagnification. As a result, benthic organisms, fish, birds, and mammals can

be adversely affected by contaminated sediments. Contaminated sediments can also compromise

human health due to direct exposure when wading, swimming, or through the consumption of

contaminated fish and shellfish (US EPA, 2002).

areas downstream (SedNet, 2004).

Traditionally, concerns about the management of aquatic resources in freshwater ecosystems

have focused primarily on water quality. While initiatives undertaken in the past twenty years

have unquestionably improved water quality conditions, a growing body of evidence indicates

that management efforts directed solely to attain surface water quality criteria may not provide

an adequate basis for protecting the designated uses of aquatic ecosystems. In recent years,

issues concerning the health and vitality of aquatic ecosystems have begun to re-emerge in North

America. Due to this, many toxic and bioaccumulative chemicals that are only found in trace

amounts in water [such as metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls,

chlorophenols, organochlorine pesticides, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers] can accumulate

in higher levels in sediments (US EPA, 2002). Despite the huge effort in research over the past

two decades, the ability to assess the impact of contaminated sediments in ecosystems remains a

challenge that is inherent to the very nature of sediments (Burton and Landrum, 2003; Burton

et al., 2007).

The problem of contaminated sediments is widespread in freshwater and marine systems

throughout the world. Contaminated sediments can be a long-term source of toxic substances to

the environment and can impact wildlife and humans through the consumption of food or water

or through direct contact. These impacts may be present even though the overlying water meets

water quality criteria (US EPA, 1992). At a certain level, contaminants in sediment will start

to impact the ecological or chemical water quality status and complicate sediment management.

In the end, effects may occur such as the decreased abundance of sediment dwelling (benthic)

species or a decreased reproduction health of animals consuming benthic species (SedNet, 2004a).

1.2 Sediment contamination in Europe

The US EPA estimates that 10% of freshwater sediments in the United States are sufficiently

contaminated to cause a significant risk to fish, wildlife and humans (US EPA, 1997). Unfortu-

nately, in Europe this issue is less well defined because of non-standardized assessment techniques

and monitoring programs between individual countries (Fleming et al. 1997). The formation

of European Sediment Research Network (SedNet) provided an opportunity to define European

goals for sediment management and to let these goals drive framework design, resulting in effi-

cient sediment assessment and management (Apitz and Power, 2002). Despite regular sediment

quality assessment, a reliable estimation of the overall amount of contaminated sediment in Eu-

rope is hard to give, mainly because of the absence of uniformity in sampling methods, among

European countries (SedNet, 2004a).

The European Union Water Framework Directive (WFD), in force since 2000, does not

4



New sediment toxicity tests for Lumbriculus variegatus

specifically address sediment management. However, it can be a tool to tackle the sources

of sediment contamination. It offers an opportunity to further improve the knowledge about the

relationship between sediment quality and water quality and to harmonise quality assessment and

sediment management on a river-basin scale (SedNet, 2004a). The WFD does not adequately

deal with “sediment” and “dredged material”, although sediments are a natural and essential

part of the aquatic environment and their management has to play an important role within

water legislation (SedNet, 2004a). The article 16.7 of the WFD states that “the Commission

shall submit proposals for quality standards applicable to the concentrations of the priority

substances in surface waters, sediments and biota” (SedNet, 2004b).

Research in several European rivers has demonstrated that sediment-associated contaminants

can have adverse effects on sediment dwelling species (SedNet, 2004a). The abundance of certain

species may decrease as a result of sediment contamination, while other more susceptible species

may disappear completely, resulting in a decreased biodiversity. A decreased abundance results

in a decline in food availability for higher organisms and, thus, disrupting the aquatic ecosystem

(SedNet, 2004a).

1.3 Assessment of sediment contamination

Unfortunately, there is no single method that will measure all contaminated sediment impacts,

at all times and to all biological organisms. This is the result of a number of factors, including

environmental heterogeneity and associated sampling problems, variability in the laboratory

exposures, analytical variability, differing sensitivities of different organisms to different types

of contaminants, the confounding effects caused by the presence of unmeasured contaminants,

the synergistic and antagonistic effects of contaminants, and the physical properties of sediments

(US EPA, 1992). The objective of a sediment test is to determine whether chemicals in sediment

are harmful to or are bioaccumulated by benthic organisms. These tests can be used to measure

interactive toxic effects of complex chemical mixtures in sediment. Sediment tests can be used

to:

(1) determine the relationship between toxic effects and bioavailability;

(2) investigate interactions among chemicals;

(3) compare the sensitivities of different organisms;

(4) determine spatial and temporal distribution of contamination;

(5) evaluate dredged material;

5

(6) measure toxicity as part of product licensing or safety testing or chemical approval;

(7) rank areas for cleanup, and

(8) set cleanup goals and estimate the effectiveness of remediation or management practices.

To assess toxicity of contaminated sediments, several standard methods were developed us-

ing amphipods, polychaetes, oligochaetes and cladocerans, among others (i.e., OECD, 2006;

ASTM, 1999a; ASTM, 1999b; ASTM, 1999c; USEPA, 1994a; USEPA, 1994b). Endpoints such

as survival, growth, reproduction and behaviour are suggested; though, the most frequently used

endpoint is 10-day survival. Short-term tests that only assess survival are useful to detect high

levels of contamination, but may not be able to identify moderately contaminated sediments

(Sibley et al., 1998; Benoit et al., 1997; Ingersoll et al., 1998). Sublethal responses to toxic

exposure are also common and may indicate the impairment of important organism functions

prior to death (Walker et al. 2001). Some authors also defend that the use of sublethal endpoints

can provide better evaluations of responses of benthic communities to contaminants in the field

(Kemble et al., 1994).

Existing sediment test methods that include measurement of sublethal endpoints can be

used to provide a rapid and direct measure of effects of contaminants on benthic communities.

Laboratory testing with field-collected sediment can also be carried out to determine temporal,

horizontal, or vertical distribution of contaminants in sediment. Furthermore, sediment tests

with complex contaminant mixtures are important tools for making decisions about the extent

of remedial action for contaminated aquatic sites and for evaluating the success of remediation

activities (US EPA, 2000b).

The use of sediment tests presents some advantages: (1) Sediment tests measure the bioavail-

able fraction of contaminant(s); (2) Sediment tests provide a direct measure of benthic effects,

assuming no field adaptation or amelioration of effects; (3) Limited special equipment is required

for testing; (4) Ten-day toxicity test methods are rapid and inexpensive; (5) Legal and scien-

tific precedence exists for use; ASTM standard guides are available; (6) Sediment tests measure

unique information relative to chemical analyses or benthic community analyses; (7) Tests with

spiked chemicals provide data on cause-effect relationships; (8) Sediment toxicity tests can be

applied to all chemicals of concern; (9) Tests applied to field samples reflect cumulative effects

of contaminants and contaminant interactions; (10) Toxicity tests are amenable to confirmation

with natural benthos populations (US EPA, 2000b, Modified from Swartz (1989)).

On the other hand, some disadvantages can be pointed out: (1) Sediment collection, han-

dling, and storage may alter bioavailability; (2) Spiked sediment may not be representative of

field-contaminated sediment; (3) Natural geochemical characteristics of sediment may affect the

response of test organisms; (4) Indigenous animals may be present in field-collected sediments;

(5) Route of exposure may be uncertain and data generated in sediment toxicity tests may be

difficult to interpret if factors controlling the bioavailability of contaminants in sediment are

unknown; (6) Tests applied to field samples may not discriminate effects of individual chemicals;

(7) Few comparisons have been made of methods or species; (8) Only a few chronic methods for

measuring sublethal effects have been developed or extensively evaluated; (9) Laboratory tests

have inherent limitations in predicting ecological effects (US EPA, 2000b, Modified from Swartz

(1989)).

1.4 The choice of a test species

The choice of a test organism has a major influence on the relevance, success, and interpreta-

tion of a test. Both practical concerns and environmental relevance are crucial on the choice of

the test organism (DeWitt et al., 1989; Swartz, 1989). Ideally, a test organism should have a tox-

icological database demonstrating relative sensitivity and discrimination to a range of chemicals

of concern in sediment; should also have a database for interlaboratory comparisons of proce-

dures (e.g., round-robin studies); be in contact with sediment (e.g., water column vs. benthic

organism); be readily available through culture or from field collection; be easily maintained

in the laboratory; be easily identified; be ecologically or economically important; have a broad

geographical distribution, be indigenous (either present or historical) to the site being evaluated,

or have a niche similar to organisms of concern (e.g., similar feeding guild or behaviour to the

indigenous organisms); be tolerant of a broad range of sediment physico-chemical characteristics

(e.g., grain size); and be compatible with selected exposure methods and endpoints (ASTM,

1999d).

The existence of information concerning relative sensitivity of the organisms (both to single

chemicals and complex mixtures) should be an important consideration in the selection of specific

species (US EPA, 2000b). The route of exposure and biochemical response to chemicals is related

to the sensitivity of an organism. Sediment-dwelling organisms can receive exposure from three

primary sources: interstitial water, sediment particles, and overlying water. Food type, feeding

rate, assimilation efficiency, and clearance rate will control the dose of chemicals from sediment

(US EPA, 2000b).

1.4.1 Oligochaetes as test species

Oligochaete worms are key macroinvertebrate constituents of terrestrial and freshwater ecosys-

tems (Edwards and Lofty, 1977; Brinkhurst and Gelder, 1991) and aquatic species are important

7



Ana Margarida Sardo

contributors to the functioning of lotic foodwebs (Benke and Jacobi, 1994; Thorp and Delong,

2002). Locomotion and other behavioural activities of these organisms are significant determi-

nants of the physical, chemical, and biological properties of soils and sediments. In addition,

locomotor functions are the cornerstone of such vital functions as foraging, sexual reproduction,

predator avoidance, dispersal, and general orientation to environmental cues (Drewes, 1997).

Because feeding rates are relatively high the so-called “conveyor-belt” feeding exhibited by many

oligochaetes (including L.variegatus) results in the regular reworking of the top layer of sed-

iment, which can have profound effects on the properties of sediments and overlying waters

(Robbins, 1982). Oligochaetes are infaunal benthic organisms that meet many of the test cri-

teria listed. Certain oligochaete species are easily handled and cultured, provide reasonable

biomass for residue analyses, and are tolerant of varying sediment physical and chemical charac-

teristics. Oligochaetes are exposed to chemicals via all appropriate routes of exposure, including

pore water and ingestion of sediment particles (US EPA, 2000b).

Aquatic oligochaetes have an extremely long history of use for pollution assessments (Chap-

man, 2001) and were used in several studies both to assess metal pollution (Phipps et al., 1995;

Hansen et al., 1996; Veltz-Balatre et al., 2000; Ingersoll et al., 2002; Demuynck et al., 2006;

Redeker et al., 2007) and also pesticide pollution (Drewes, 1997; Zou et al., 2007; Amorim et

al., 2008; Garcia et al., 2008). Oligochaetes offer a rare experimental advantage for behav-

ioral toxicology - the ability to non-invasively detect spiking from identified interneurons and

motorneurons that mediate rapid escape responses (Drewes, 1997).

1.4.2 Lumbriculus variegatus: biology and importance in ecotoxicology

Lumbriculus variegatus (Mu?ller 1774) is a freshwater oligochaete of the family Lumbriculidae

(Table 1.1), found throughout North America and Europe. It prefers shallow habitats at the

edges of ponds, lakes, or marshes where it feeds on decaying vegetation and microorganisms

(Brinkhurst and Gelder 1991) and it tolerates a wide range of substrates (US EPA, 2000b).

Worms cultured in the laboratory are usually small (4-6 cm in length), compared to field

collected worms, and never reach sexual maturity or produce cocoons. Reproduction under

laboratory conditions is always by asexual fragmentation, during which a worm spontaneously

divides into two or more body fragments. Each surviving fragment then undergoes rapid regen-

eration of body segments to form a new head end, tail end, or both ends (Brinkhurst and Gelder

1991). Eventually, each fragment grows into a normal sized worm comprising a combination of

older and newer segments, representing two or more “generations” of development (Lesiuk and

Drewes, 1999). The regeneration is achieved after 7 days at 20?C and goes through eight char-

acteristic stages, even if the sectioning is artificially induced (Veltz-Balatre, 2000). L.variegatus

has a remarkable capacity for regeneration of lost body segments (epimorphosis) and for neural

plasticity within original body segments (morphallaxis) following injury-induced fragmentation

(Hyman, 1916).

L.variegatus is recommended for use in toxicity tests with sediments based on ease of culture

and handling, known chemical exposure history, adequate tissue mass for chemical analysis, tol-

erance of a wide range of sediment physical-chemical characteristics, low sensitivity (in terms of

mortality) to contaminants associated with sediment, and amenability to long-term exposures

without feeding (Ingersoll et al., 2003). This species has been proposed by the American Society

of Testing and Materials (ASTM, 1995) as a standard organism for tests of sediment bioaccumu-

lation and is listed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD,

1992) as a good organism for bioaccumulation studies. The response of L.variegatus in labora-

tory bioaccumulation studies has been confirmed with natural populations of oligochaetes (US

EPA, 2000b). Judging by the number of internationally published articles, the most common

Oligochaeta species used in evaluations of freshwater toxicity has been L. variegatus (Hansen et

al., 1996; Leppa?nen, 1999; Veltz-Balatre et al., 2000; Ingersoll et al., 2002).

1.5 Behaviour as an endpoint in ecotoxicology

Mortality, bioaccumulation, growth and reproduction have been the most common endpoints

used in the vast majority of studies in environmental toxicology (Leppa?nen and Kukkonen, 1998).

There is a lack of data regarding sublethal toxicological endpoints, such as effects on growth,

reproduction, morphology or behaviour. Without this kind of information, the complex biological

actions cannot be fully understood and reliable predictions of ecological impacts of environmental

toxicants cannot be made (Rogge and Drewes, 1993).

Behaviour is a sublethal parameter readily altered by stress (Beitinger, 1990) and it is con-

sidered as a promising tool in ecotoxicological studies (Cohn and MacPhail 1996). The use of

this parameter as an endpoint has some advantages since behavioural differences can be easily

related to the fitness of individuals, which means that this endpoint is a real biomarker of effect.

Nevertheless, the lack of standardised methods can be a major downside, as well as the possible

influence of biotic and abiotic factors (Capowiez et al., 2003). Since behaviour integrates many

cellular processes that are vital to the organism’s survival and reproduction, it can be considered

as an excellent tool when evaluation of toxicity of chemicals needs to be made (Janssen et al.,

1994). Behaviour is probably an important path to search for mechanisms of toxicity (Macedo-

Sousa, 2007) and once we are able to quantify this parameter, it has the potential to be used as a

biomarker in the assessment of stress (Beitinger, 1990). Biomonitoring should rely on sublethal

endpoints rather than mortality alone (Macedo-Sousa, 2007).

Since the early 1970s, contaminants have been shown to affect virtually every aspect of be-

haviour in terrestrial and aquatic organisms. Behaviour integrates many cellular processes as is

essential to the viability of the organism, population and community. Therefore, observations of

behaviour provide a unique toxicological perspective: one that links the biochemical and ecolog-

10

ical consequences of environmental contamination (Little, 1990).

Many toxicants are known to alter the behaviour of aquatic biota (Weis et al., 2001). Contam-

inants can induce behavioural or defensive responses that may change the outcome of biological

interactions or even intensify the effect of a contaminant (Fleeger et al., 2003).

During the last decades, there has been an increasing interest in investigating sublethal end-

points (Aisemberg et al., 2005) and some studies used behaviour as an endpoint. West and

Ankley (1998) believe that behaviour may be a useful tool in the assessment of contaminated

sediments. However, as with other endpoints, an important aspect of assay validation is con-

ducting field studies to determine predictive capabilities (West and Ankley, 1998). Loureiro et

al (2005) observed avoidance behaviour in both isopods and earthworms and based on the rapid

information obtained, suggested that avoidance behaviour tests should be regarded as a valuable

tool in the screening evaluation of soil contamination. A study by De Lange (2006) showed that

behaviour is a much more sensitive endpoint than growth or survival, based on results obtained

from the activity of Gammarus pulex. Several aspects of changes in the swimming behaviour

of fish caused by sublethal exposure to xenobiotics have been used as sensitive indicators of

11

toxic stress (Diamond et al., 1990; Little and Finger, 1990). O’Gara et al (2004) documented

the adverse effects of copper exposure on the locomotory and escape behaviour of the aquatic

oligochaete L. variegatus, which reduces the ability to escape from predators.

Behavioural parameters reflect biochemical changes and have ecological consequences (La-

gadic et al., 1995, Janssen et al., 1994), they are one of the most sensitive responses to occur

and are non-destructive. These facts suggest that responses based on behaviour are optimal for

cost-effective and ecologically relevant toxicity evaluations and very adequate for biological early

warning systems.

Based on behavioural responses to toxics some online biomonitoring systems have been de-

veloped, using different organisms as sensors. Some examples are the Koblenz behavioural fish

test, the Dreissena-Monitor and the Mussel-Monitor (Untersteiner et al., 2003). Video tracking

is a popular method to assess behaviour, with very good results (Alchanatis et al., 2000; Un-

tersteiner et al., 2003; Venkateswara et al., 2006). However, studying oligochaete behaviour is

difficult, since these organisms tend to be buried in the sediment, which excludes methods like

video tracking as an option to assess behaviour.

1.6 Aims of the research

With the main aim of developing new behavioural online sediment toxicity tests for L.variegatus,

this thesis includes initial experiments to gather information about good culture practices (Chap-

ter 2), studies with toxics as different as metal (Chapter 3) and pesticide (Chapter 4) and a final

step with a field case study (Chapter 5).

Bellow is a brief explanation of the steps taken.

- Behaviour, growth and reproduction of Lumbriculus variegatus (Oligochaetae)

in different sediment types. (Chapter 2) In this preliminary study, locomotory activity

of L. variegatus was used to determine appropriate sediment (based on grain-size) for

standard sediment toxicity tests. Assessments included measures of behaviour, growth

and reproduction. A large amount of literature is available about the laboratorial culture

conditions for L.variegatus, but the majority use paper towels as subtract. In this work a

more realistic approach was proposed, using sediment as subtract in order to understand

what grain-size was more suitable for this species growth and behaviour. In addition,

locomotory behaviour of adults from a normal and a clone population was studied.

- Short and long-term exposure of Lumbriculus variegatus (Oligochaetae) to

metal lead: ecotoxicological and behavioural effects. (Chapter 3) After a care-

ful study of the best conditions for culture and the best conditions to record behavioural

12

signals, there was an attempt to develop a new automated sediment toxicity test using

L.variegatus and to assess differences between short and long-term exposures. In addition,

this study investigated the use of behaviour of L.variegatus as a new parameter to standard

toxicity tests. Lead was chosen as chemical stressor since is a well know polluter and due

to its affinity to sediment particles.

- Assessment of the effects of the pesticide imidacloprid on the behaviour of the

aquatic oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus. (Chapter 4) Imidacloprid has been

found in streams and rivers and is likely to be bioavailable to aquatic organisms. Because

there were few studies on the toxicity of imidacloprid to relevant lotic species (Alexander et

al, 2007), here we investigated the impact of imidacloprid on the behaviour of the aquatic

oligochaete L.variegatus. In this study, a new automated sediment toxicity test using

L.variegatus was developed to assess differences between short and long-term exposures

to different concentrations of the pesticide. In addition, this study investigated the use of

behaviour of L.variegatus as a tool to assess sublethal effects of a toxic substance.

- Evaluation of sediment toxicity from an abandoned cupric pyrite mine (Portu-

gal) using the aquatic oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus as test species and

behaviour as an endpoint. (Chapter 5) In this research work a new approach for on-

line biomonitoring using field contaminated sediments was developed. This new approach

combined behavioural and standard toxicity parameters, such as mortality and growth of

L.variegatus. The main goal of this work was to evaluate the toxicity of sediments from an

abandoned cupric pyrite mine, by measuring the 10-day mortality, growth and behaviour

of L.variegatus. Other tested parameters included TOC, AVS, grain size and metals in sed-

iment and in whole-body. One major challenge in this study was the presence of chemical

mixtures, a common feature in field-collected sediments. The study site was Sa?o Domingos

Mine, a potentially good site for ecotoxicological studies, due to a pH and metal gradient

of acid mine drainage.

The final chapter (Chapter 6) of the present thesis constitutes a general discussion and final

remarks of the research. Throughout the thesis we suggest possible future studies.

ABSTRACT
Lumbriculus variegatus is an oligochaete widely used in sediment toxicity tests. The

locomotory behavior of adults from a normal and a clone population was studied in
the Multispecies Freshwater BiomonitorTM along with growth and reproduction to
determine how different sediment types may affect this worm and forced clones dur-
ing testing. Four different sand size classes were established by sieving: fine (&lt;1 mm),
medium (1 &amp;lt;× &amp;lt;2 mm), coarse (&gt;2 mm), and whole sediment. Locomotory ac-
tivity was highest in fine and then in coarse sediment, while in whole and medium
sediment size classes worms grew and reproduced less, and had lower locomotory
activity levels. Fine sediment (&lt;1 mm) should be used as the negative control in
L. variegatus whole sediment toxicity tests. A clone population, generated by cut-
ting all worms over six generations, showed lower locomotory activity levels than
normal worms. Artificial cloning is not recommended for obtaining additional test
organisms.

Key Words: Lumbriculus variegatus, sediment toxicity, behavior, growth, reproduc-
tion, Multispecies Freshwater BiomonitorTM.

INTRODUCTION

Aquatic oligochaetes have an extremely long history of use for pollution assess-
ments (Chapman 2001). Lumbriculus variegatus is a freshwater oligochaete of the fam-
ily Lumbriculidae, found throughout North America and Europe. It prefers shallow
habitats at the edges of ponds, lakes, or marshes where it feeds on decaying vegetation
and microorganisms (Brinkhurst and Gelder 1991). It is widely used in sediment tox-
icity testing (Dermott and Munawar 1992; Phipps et al. 1993; USEPA 2000; Ingersoll
et al. 2003). Worms cultured in the laboratory are usually small (4–6 cm in length)
compared to field collected worms, and never reach sexual maturity or produce co-
coons. Reproduction under laboratory conditions is always by asexual fragmentation,
during which a worm spontaneously divides into two or more body fragments. Each

surviving fragment then undergoes rapid regeneration of body segments to form a
new head end, tail end, or both ends (Brinkhurst and Gelder 1991). L. variegatus has
a remarkable capacity for regeneration of lost body segments (epimorphosis) and
for neural plasticity within original body segments (morphallaxis) following injury-
induced fragmentation. Lumbriculidae body fragments regenerate eight new head
segments and tails of variable lengths (Drewes and Fourtner 1990; Martinez et al.
2006).

The Multispecies Freshwater Biomonitor©R (MFB) measures, in an automatic and
quantitative manner, different behaviors of aquatic species in an electrical field of
high frequency alternating current, caused by movements of the organisms in their
test chambers (Gerhardt et al. 1994; Gerhardt 2000). The individual test organism
is placed in a cylindrical flow-through test chamber with two pairs of stainless steel-
plate electrodes, attached at the opposite chamber walls. One pair generates a high
frequency alternating current, the other non-current carrying electrode pair senses
impedance changes due to the movements of the organism in the electrical field
(record time: 4 min; interval: 6 min). Different types of behavior generate charac-
teristic electrical signals (Gerhardt 1999, 2000). The electrical signals are processed
by a discrete Fast Fourier Transformation and generate a histogram of the occur-
rence of all signal frequencies in % (summarized in intervals of O.5 Hz from 0 to
10 Hz), hence yielding a “fingerprint” of the behavioral pattern of the organism.
This transformation gives the percentage of occurrence of each single frequency
during the record of 4 min. The unit of measurement is the test chamber, which can
have different sizes, forms, materials and arrangements of electrodes. This method
has been shown to be a valuable biomonitoring and toxicity testing tool using epi-
benthic crustaceans, insects, and planktonic and pelagic species of fish and tadpoles
(Gerhardt 2000).

The main purpose of the present study is to define the best sediment types for use
of L. variegatus in sediment toxicity tests, based on grain-size. Assessments included
measures of behavior, growth, and reproduction.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Sediment Grain Size Classes

L. variegatus were kindly provided from an existing culture at the University of
Joensuu (Finland), by Matti Leppa?nen. The cultures, each with 50 worms, were
reared in plastic aquaria (8.5 × 17.5 × 12 cm), covered with lids, containing ASTM
(ASTM 1980) water (pH 7.6 ± 0.3), at 20?C, in a CT-room (16:8 h light:dark cycle
and 50% humidity). A commercially available sand-pebble mixture (grain sizes: 0–
8 mm) was acid washed (pH 2) and ashed (4 h, 450?C). Afterwards it was sieved
in different size classes (fine:&amp;lt;1 mm; medium: 1 mm &amp;lt;× &amp;lt;2 mm; coarse: &gt;2
mm; whole sediment—sediment that had minimal manipulation (USEPA 2000)).
Each plastic PE-aquarium comprised a 2 cm layer of one sediment class size with
continuous and moderated aeration of the overlying water. The entire water volume
was renewed every 10 days. 30 worms were fed with approximately 5 mg powdered
TetraMin:Tetraphyll (1:1), applied 2 to 3 times a week. The behavior of the worms
kept in different sediment sizes was tested with the MFB after 2.5 and 5 months,

Sediment Behavior of L. variegatus

to verify if the worms behave differently in different sediment types. For MFB tests,
4 worms from each sediment size were used, during 24 h, in chambers filled with
50% ASTM water and 50% sediment. For this test, the chambers (10 mm diameter)
had 2 pairs of stainless steel electrodes positioned opposite to each other: one pair
generated the high frequency electric field and the other pair sensed impedance
changes in electric field caused by movements of the worms. Three chambers were
used as controls, filled with 50% whole-sediment and 50% ASTM water and without
worms in order to evaluate potential external disturbance signals.

Clone Population

The population was reared in a plastic aquarium (7 × 13.5 × 10 cm), covered with
lids, containing ASTM (ASTM 1980) water (pH 7.6 ± 0.3), at 20?C, in a CT-room
(16:8 h light:dark cycle and 50% humidity). A 2 cm layer of fine sediment was added
to the plastic aquarium. Continuous and moderated aeration was provided. Using
a plastic pipette, the worms were transferred from the culture aquarium to a Petri
dish. The excess water was withdrawn and 25 adults of L. variegatus were cut in two
pieces each with a stiletto. Water was renewed every 10 days; 30 worms were fed with
approximately 5 mg of Tetraphyll, applied 2 to 3 times a week; all organisms were
cut once a month. Differences between normal and clone worms were studied with
the MFB, in chambers filled with half ASTM water and half sediment. Activities were
measured continuously over tracks of 4 min in 10 min intervals for a period of 24 h.
The chambers and the controls used were the same as for the previous test.

Statistical Analysis

Normality and homoscedasticity were tested using the Software Package Sigma-
Stat for Windows, version 3.1. As the data were non-normal, the chosen statistic
was non-parametric. The overall effect of the sediment on population behavior was
investigated using a Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA on ranks (p &amp;lt;0.001) (Zar 1996); the
Dunn’s method post-hoc test was run to check for significant differences (p &amp;lt;0.05),
also using SigmaStat.

RESULTS

Sediment Grain Size Classes

The populations in four different sediment sizes and the clones are easy and not
expensive to maintain. The results (Figure 1) show that worms prefer the fine sed-
iment and reproduce better, a significant trend (p &amp;lt;0.05) which was followed up
for two and a half months. After two and a half months (Table 1), worms reared in
coarse and whole sediment were more active in the same sediment size class than

resented signal frequencies between 0.5 and 1.0 Hz, corresponding to L. variegatus
peristaltic movements. Band 2 corresponded to whole body locomotory movements
between 1.0 and 3.0 Hz. The activities of worms cultured in different sizes of sediment
were all significantly different (p &amp;lt;0.05) in both bands (Table 2).

After five months (Table 3), worms reared and exposed in fine and coarse sedi-
ment had higher activities values than those in whole and medium sized sediment
(Figure 2) (p &amp;lt;0.05). Hence, after a long culture time, the culture stabilized and
the measured spontaneous locomotory activities represent exactly the “state” of the
cultures: the healthier and numerous cultures (fine and coarse) had the higher
activities, whereas whole and medium sediment worms grew and reproduced less
and had lower activities. Statistical analysis (Table 2) showed that, after five months,
there were significant differences between the worms’ activities on band 1 (peri-
staltic movements) except while comparing fine and coarse and coarse and whole
worms. On band 2 (locomotion) there were significant differences in worms from
all sediments except when comparing worms in fine and coarse sediment.

Clone Population

There was no mortality after 24 h, which means that cutting did not increase
mortality rates. The culture of forced clone worms was marked by induced regen-
eration. Due to artificial segmentation, the worms did not reproduce themselves by

asexual segmentation. When comparing MFB signals from normal (cultured in all
the sediment sizes) and forced clone worms (Table 2; Figure 3), significant differ-
ences (p &amp;lt;0.05) were found. Normal worms were much more active than clones,
and had high activity in terms of peristaltic movements (band 1) and more locomo-
tion (band 2), except when compared with medium sediment, where worms were
less active (Table 3).

DISCUSSION

Fine sediment proved to be the best for the health and vitality of L. variegatus,
and should be used as reference test material in culture as well as in toxicity tests
of the species. Ecologically relevant sediment toxicity tests typically use whole sedi-
ment, however in doing so it must be recognized that these may comprise less than
ideal sediments for the organism, affecting behavior, growth, and reproduction.
Fine sediment should be used as the laboratory control for this test, although eco-
logical relevance requires comparisons between exposed and field reference whole
sediments.

Culture of forced clone worms was marked by induced regeneration, and due
to this artificial process, the worms did not reproduce by asexual reproduction.
Although the process of forming new anterior or posterior ends during a round of
fission is sometimes loosely referred to as “regeneration,” the two processes (fission
and regeneration) are biologically very different. Regeneration is triggered when

Sediment Behavior of L. variegatus

some external force, for example, an unpredictable predatory attack, breaks a worm
into pieces. In contrast, fission (either architomy or paratomy) is initiated by the
worm itself, and is thus at some level predictable. It is therefore possible, perhaps even
likely, that the worm prepares itself physiologically or developmentally for the latter
event (Bely 1999). This discrepancy in behavior between fission and regeneration
processes can explain the differences found in this study, between natural and cloned
worms.

An important assumption in ecotoxicology is that results of biotests obtained in
the laboratory are relevant and reasonable approximations of natural environmen-
tal conditions. Empirical and theoretical studies have shown that small and isolated
populations decrease in their genetic allelic richness over time and that this genetic
impoverishment may result in reduced health, adult sterility, and a high sensitivity
to environmental stress (Frankham et al. 2002). High degrees of genetic impov-
erishment in laboratory cultures of ecotoxicological model organisms could have
severe effects on their response to environmental contaminants and thus lead to bi-
ased estimates of the tested chemicals’ toxicity. For example, Nowak et al. (personal
communication) have shown that laboratory cultures of Chironomus riparius exhibit
much lower levels of genetic variation (allelic richness) than field populations. In
the present study, after a few generations the worms generated by cloning showed a
decrease in movement, which may indicate genetic impoverishment.

CONCLUSION

This study showed that fine sediment (&lt;1 mm) is most suitable to achieve healthy,
active, and numerous worm cultures and should be used as the negative control when
using L. variegatus in sediment toxicity tests. The forced (artificially induced) clone
population was marked by induced regeneration, less growth and less locomotory
activity compared to normal worms. Accordingly, artificial cloning is not a recom-
mended method to obtain additional test organisms.

Abstract 

Metals are naturally occurring constituents in the environment and although many are essential 

nutrients for living organisms, at higher concentrations they can be toxic. Some aquatic species can help 

understand and even predict the impact of those contaminants. Lumbriculus variegatus is a 

recommended species to use in sediment toxicity tests and is known to have a remarkable ability of 

segmental regeneration. A short (10 days) and a long-term (28 days) toxicity test was used to test the 

effects (short and long-term) of a metal in survival, growth and behaviour of L. variegatus. This work aims 

to investigate and validate the use of behaviour as a new parameter in standard toxicity tests. Lead was 

chosen as chemical stressor due to its known affinity to sediment particles. Worms were exposed to 

sediments contaminated with different levels of lead and the results indicated a positive relation between 

lead concentrations and mortality and growth: higher lead concentrations resulted in higher mortalities 

and strong inhibitions in growth. An inhibition of behaviour was observed and results suggested that 

although behaviour could not be used in sediment toxicity tests, it can be proved useful as an addition to 

short-term tests and helps select sediments. Thus, exposure to sediments contaminated with lead affect 

the presence of this species in nature, because interferes with growth and with survival.

Introduction  

The vast majority of studies in environmental toxicology use mortality, bioaccumulation, growth 

and reproduction as endpoints (Leppänen and Kukkonen, 1998). Therefore, there is a lack of data 

regarding sublethal toxicological endpoints, such as effects on development, fecundity, morphology, 

behaviour or physiology. Without this kind of information, the complex biological actions cannot be fully 

understood and reliable predictions of ecological impacts of environmental toxicants cannot be made 

(Rogge and Drewes, 1993). During the last decades, there has been an increasing interest to investigate 

other sublethal endpoints (Aisemberg et al, 2005). Behaviour is a sublethal parameter readily altered by 

stress (Beitinger, 1990) and it is considered as a promising tool in ecotoxicology studies (Cohn and 

MacPhail 1996). Locomotion in particular has been found to be a consistently sensitive measure of toxic 

stress for a wide range of environmental contamination (Little and Finger, 1990). Behavioural changes 

may have ecological consequences, e.g. avoidance behaviour or decreased activity may influence 

population levels by affecting migration or susceptibility to predation (Gerhardt, 1995). Biomonitoring 

should rely on sublethal endpoints rather than mortality alone (Macedo-Sousa et al, 2007). Biomonitoring 

instruments have been proved to have the best deterrent effect upon polluters (Gerhardt, 2000) 

addressing the need to determine the effects of pollutants on benthic invertebrates (Macedo-Sousa et al, 

2007).  

Oligochaete worms are key marcoinvertebrate and play a major role in terrestrial and freshwater 

ecosystems (Edwards and Lofty, 1977; Brinkhurst and Gelder, 1991) contributing to the functioning of 

lotic foodwebs (Benke and Jacobi, 1994; Thorp and Delong, 2002), reason why they were chosen as test 

species in the present study. Locomotion and other behavioural activities of these organisms are 

significant determinants of the physical, chemical, and biological properties of soils and sediments. In 

addition, locomotor functions are the cornerstone of such vital functions as foraging, sexual reproduction, 

predator avoidance, dispersal, and general orientation to environmental cues (Drewes, 1997). Aquatic 

oligochaetes have an extremely long history of use in pollution assessments (Chapman, 2001). 

Lumbriculus variegatus (Müller 1774) is recommended for use in toxicity tests with sediments based on 



 

   33 

ease of culture and handling, known chemical exposure history, adequate tissue mass for chemical 

analysis, tolerance to a wide range of sediment physical-chemical characteristics, low sensitivity (in terms 

of mortality) to contaminants associated with sediment, and amenability to long-term exposures without 

feeding (Ingersoll et al, 2003). This species has been proposed by the American Society of Testing and 

Materials (ASTM, 1995) as a standard organism for tests of sediment bioaccumulation and is listed by the 

Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 1992) as a good organism for 

bioaccumulation studies. L. variegatus is a freshwater oligochaete known to have remarkable powers of 

segmental regeneration (Hyman, 1916). Reproduction under laboratory conditions is always by asexual 

fragmentation, during which a worm spontaneously divides into two or more body fragments (Lesiuk and 

Drewes, 1999).  

Lead is a metal well known as a toxic material (IPCS, 1995) that occurs naturally in the 

environment.  However, most of the lead found throughout the environment comes from human activities 

(ATSDR, 1997). Lead may interfere with the essential metal metabolism of a range of plants and animals 

(Behra, 1993). A significant toxic effect of lead, although indirect, might be indicated if organisms showed 

some form of adaptive tolerance to the metal (Posthuma and van Straalen, 1993). 

The Multispecies Freshwater Biomonitor® (MFB) measures online different behaviours of 

aquatic species, based on the registration of changes in a high frequency alternating current that are 

caused by movements of the organisms in their test chambers (Gerhardt et al., 1994; Gerhardt, 2000b). 

The individual test organism is placed in a flow-through cylindrical test chamber with two pairs of stainless 

steel-plate electrodes, attached at the opposite chamber walls. One pair generates a high frequency 

alternating current, the other non-current carrying electrode pair senses impedance changes due to the 

movements of the organism in the electrical field (record time: 4 min; interval: 6 min). Different types of 

behaviour generate characteristical electrical signals (Gerhardt, 1999, 2000b). The electrical signals are 

processed by a discrete Fast Fourier Transformation and generate a histogram of the occurrence of all 

frequencies in % (summarized in intervals of O.S Hz from 0 to 10 Hz), hence yielding a ”fingerprint” of the 

behavioural pattern of the organism. This transformation gives the percentage of occurrence of each 



 

   34 

single frequency during the record of 4 min. This method has already shown to be a valuable 

biomonitoring and toxicity testing tool using epi-benthic crustaceans, insects, as well as planktonic and 

pelagic species of fish and tadpoles (Gerhardt, 2000b). Behavioural responses may have a role in 

searching mechanisms of toxicity and the MFB, as a sophisticated device, may help to explore those 

mechanisms (Gerhardt et al, 2005). 

There is a need for further research on the toxicity of metals to freshwater invertebrates and this 

should concentrate on the effects of sublethal exposures (Bat, 2000). The aims of this study were to 

develop a new automated sediment toxicity test using L. variegatus and to assess differences between 

short and long-term exposures. Furthermore, this study investigated the use of behaviour of L. variegatus 

as a new parameter to standard toxicity tests. The hypothesis was that the presence of lead would cause 

behavioural early warning responses, particularly on locomotion and peristaltic movements. 

 

Material and Methods 

Culture - Laboratory cultures of Lumbriculus variegatus (Müller 1774) used throughout these tests 

originated from the University of Joensuu, Finland.  Animals were reared in a PE (Polyethylene) aquarium 

(8.5 x 17.5 x 12 cm), covered with lids, containing ASTM (ASTM, 1980) medium (pH 7.6 ± 0.3), at 20ºC, 

in a controlled temperature (CT) room (16:8h light:dark cycle and 50% humidity). A commercially available 

sand-pebble mixture (grain sizes: 0-8 mm) was acid washed (pH 2), ashed (4h, 450ºC) and used as 

sediment. Cultures were maintained in a plastic aquarium contained a 2 cm layer of sediment with 

continuous and moderated aeration. The worms were fed with approximately 5mg/30 worms of Tetraphyll, 

applied 2 or 3 times a week. 

 

Spiking - Whole-sediment (sediment that have had minimal manipulation (US EPA, 2000)) used in the 

experiments had the following characteristics: 4.9% sand, 74.4% clay and 20.7% silt; pH of pore water 

6.77; ammonia of pore water 3.04 mg/Kg; total carbon content 0.54%. Metal-spike solutions were 

prepared by dissolving the appropriate amount of metal salt ((CH3COO)2Pb.3H2O; supplied by Merck) in 



 

   35 

distilled water. These solutions were added immediately to the control dry sediment. Then, the sediment 

was capped and rapidly shaken for 1 min. The spiked sediments equilibrated for a minimum of 48h, to 

allow the lead to adsorb or bind to the sediment particles. During this time, sediments were shaken every 

day during approximately 2 min. Contaminated water was replaced by ASTM medium before adding the 

worms. Nominal lead concentrations in the sediment were 0 (control of uncontaminated sediment), 15.0, 

30.0, 60.0, 80.0 and 150.0 mg/Kg.  Sediment was sampled for metal analysis at the start and termination 

of each test; the overlying water (ASTM medium) was sampled only at the end of the tests. 

 

Exposure design – Two tests were performed: one short-term (10-day) and one long-term (28-day), both 

with contaminated sediment and clean water. Exposures were conducted at ± 20ºC, in a CT-room (16:8h 

light:dark cycle and 50% humidity), in 100 mL plastic beakers, containing 35 g of whole sediment and 20 

mL of ASTM, in a static system. Seven replicates per concentration were used, each with six young 

worms (about 1.5 cm), totalling 42 organisms per concentration, carefully introduced into the beakers with 

the help of a plastic Pasteur pipette. Mortality/survival, size class/growth (size class 1: worm &amp;lt;2cm; size 

class 2: 2cm &amp;lt;worm &amp;lt;2.5cm; size class 3: worm &gt; 2.5 cm), colour, activity and presence in sediment or 

water were monitored, every 48h for the short-term test and every 5 days for the long-term test. For this 

task, worms were removed from sediment and carefully observed and measured.  During the long-term 

test, worms were fed once a week with 2.4 mg of Tetraphyll per pot; no food was added during the short-

term test. The survival worms were collected and dried at 40ºC, for about 24h. For water, sediment and 

whole-body samples the Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP-OES) method was used (ICP-OES acc. to DIN 

EN ISO 11885; Limit of quantitation (LOQ): 0,010 mg/L for water and 0,1 mg/Kg for sediment and whole-

body). Biomass (dry weight of surviving organisms divided by the initial number of organisms, according 

to US EPA, 2000) was also calculated. The behaviour of the worms was tested and recorded using the 

MFB. For these tests, seven worms from each concentration (one per replicate) were used, during 2h 

(plus 30 min acclimation period), in chambers filled with 50% ASTM water and 50% whole-sediment. 

Three chambers were used as control, filled as the others and without worms. Chambers with on single 



 

   36 

worm were connected to the MFB and settings were made for channel information, noise level (50mV) 

and threshold value (Gerhardt and Schmidt, 2002) to obtain response data for the analysis of signal 

frequencies. 

  

Statistical analysis - Linear regression analyses were carried out using Excel® software package 

(Microsoft, USA). For each tested concentration, selected behavioural signal frequencies (0 – 1Hz and 1 – 

3 Hz) were plotted over time. Normality and homoscedasticity were tested using the Software Package 

SigmaStat for Windows, version 3.5. Original behavioural MFB data were arcsin transformed and the 

overall effect of lead concentrations on population behaviour was investigated using a Kruskal-Wallis one-

way ANOVA on ranks (p&lt;0.001), followed by a post hoc Dunn’s test (p&lt;0.05) to check for significant 

differences (Zar 1996). 

 

Results  

Short-term Test 

Some study parameters, such as colour, activity after a small prod, and presence in sediment or 

in water, were monitored during the experiment. No changes in colour occurred on organisms exposed to 

any lead concentration. Regarding activity, worms were little active after being cut, but were always active 

on the other test days. No avoidance occurred: despite the contaminated sediment, worms never escaped 

to the clean water.

Figure 1. Total mortality (%) of L. variegatus after exposure to short-term and long-term tests. 

 

A positive connection between metal concentration and mortality (Figure 1) was observed: 

mortality of L. variegatus increased linearly (R2=0.949) with increasing lead exposure. Highest mortalities 

were observed for the concentrations of 60.0, 80.0 and 150.0 mg/Kg (19.0, 28.6 and 31.0%, total 

mortality, respectively). Only one worm died in the control (2.4%), demonstrating that the holding facilities 

and handling techniques were acceptable for conducting such tests, as required by the viability criteria 

(mean survival for control should be 90%) (ASTM, 1990).  



 

   38 

 

Figure 2. Growth (size class) of worms (mean+STDEV) throughout short-term test. 

 

Growth was the most affected test parameter. Only worms exposed to the lowest concentration 

(15.0 mg/Kg) were not affected; all the other tested concentrations had a strong influence on the growth 

of the organisms. Higher concentrations of lead corresponded to slower growth (Figure 2): a control 

juvenile reaches the adult length (about 3 cm) after 7 to 8 days, on average, but the higher the lead 

concentration in sediment, more days are needed for juveniles to became adults. A good linear relation 

was found between lead concentrations and L. variegatus growth (R2 = 0.938). Biomass data (Table I) 

corroborated the results of mortality and growth: biomass value decreased with the increase of lead 

concentration, because worms grew less and the mortalities were higher.

peristaltic movements) was observed for all tested days, strongly linked with the increase of lead 

concentrations. Variances were not homogeneously distributed but the results of the one-way ANOVA on 

ranks indicated a significant concentration effect (p&lt;0.05), both for locomotion and peristaltic movements. 

 

Sediment, Water and Whole-body Analysis 

Lead concentrations in the initial and final sediment samples had values as expected (Table II), 

confirming that the spiking method was correct and well performed. No important differences between 

initial and final lead values were found. At the end of short-term test there was some lead in water 

samples, probably due to collection of worms from the sediment for measurement and observation. Those 

concentrations in water were, anyway, residual. Whole-body, as expected, presented high values of lead, 

at the end of the short-term test (Table I). Worms exposed to higher levels of lead in the sediment 

presented higher concentrations of metal in the whole-body, which shows an enormous capacity to 

absorve and store this metal. The absorption of lead by the worms’ whole-body increased as the 

exposure to metal increased (Figure 4), but not in a linear pattern: lead in whole-body followed a power 

trend (R2 = 0.93).

Long-term Test 

Parameters such as colour, activity and presence of worms in the sediment showed no 

influence to the exposure of lead: colour was always normal; worms were always active and never 

escape to clean water. After 28 days of exposure, high mortalities (Figure 1) were observed in worms 

exposed to 60.0 mg/Kg (52.4%) and 150.0 mg/Kg (59.5%) and also to 80.0 mg/Kg (38.1%). No mortality 

occurred on control demonstrating that the holding facilities and handling techniques were acceptable for 

conducting such tests. There was a clear positive linear relation (R2 = 0.92) between mortality and Pb 

concentrations: higher mortalities were observed in worms exposed to higher Pb concentrations.

Figure 5. Growth (size class) of worms (mean+STDEV) throughout long-term test. 

 

Only worms exposed to 15.0 mg/Kg grew as CRT worms (Figure 5), all the other concentrations 

inhibited the growth of L. variegatus. Worms exposed to 150.0 mg/Kg (highest tested concentration) 

almost did not grow. A linear relation between lead exposure and growth was found in the long-term test, 

but the regression was not so strong (R2 = 0.82) as it was for the short-term test. Yet still, it is clear that 

the growth of the worms was inhibited by the exposure to lead concentrations. Comparing long and short-

term tests, the results for growth are different: control worms grew more in the long-term test than in the 

short-term-test, as expected. As observed for short-term test, biomass data (Table III) corroborated the 

results of mortality and growth: biomass value decreased with the increase of lead concentration, 

because worms grew less and mortalities were higher.  

Reproduction was not one of the study endpoints, but was anyway observed during the long-

term test. Reproduction occurred for control (16.6% of the worms reproduced), 15.0 mg/Kg (7.1%) and 

30.0 mg/Kg (4.8%), and was clearly higher for control worms. This indicates that exposure to higher 

concentration of lead also inhibited the reproduction of L. variegatus.

During the long-term test (figure 6), a decrease of both peristaltic movements and locomotion 

associated with the increase of lead concentrations was observed. This trend was observed for all tested 

days. On day 21, low activity values were measured for control worms. This was possibly due to the fact 

that some worms were reproducing, which causes a decrease in the movements, affecting activity. On 

day 27 control worms presented high activity values. Again, variances were not homogeneously 

distributed but the results of the one-way ANOVA on ranks indicated a significant concentration effect 

(p&lt;0.05), both for locomotion and peristaltic movements.

Sediment, Water and Whole-body Analysis 

In the short-term test, concentrations of lead present in the initial and final sediment samples 

were as expected (Table IV), meaning that the spiking method was correct and well performed. In 

general, lead concentrations in the sediment did not vary between the beginning and the end of the 28-



 

   45 

days exposure and residual concentrations of metal were found in water final samples. Very high values 

of lead were found in L. variegatus whole-body (Table III). The absorption of lead increased as the 

exposure to metal increased (Figure 4), following a linear trend (R2 = 0.86).

Discussion 

Environmental pollution by heavy metals has been a matter of growing concern over the last 

decades (Loumbourdis et al, 2007). A variety of human activities, such as mining industries, and various 

by-products, such as motor car exhaust fumes and fertilizers, are responsible for releasing heavy metals 

into the environment (Loumbourdis, 1997). Some populations are able to survive in the presence of high 

metal concentrations, because they possess efficient detoxification mechanisms, or can lower the amount 

of metal accumulated in their bodies either through excretion (Gerhardt, 1993).   Populations that live for 

generations in contaminated environments can also develop a genetic resistance to metals (Gerhardt, 

1993), thus the importance of the study of sublethal effects and new endpoint such as behaviour. 

For mortality, a linear trend was observed in both tests, short-term and long-term, which means 



 

   46 

that on short and long-term exposures to the metal lead, mortality linearly increases with the increase of 

exposure concentrations. Total mortality was higher at the end of the long-term test than at the end of the 

short-term test, indicating that mortality increased over time, as expected.  

Comparisons of our data with other published studies is rather difficult, especially because of 

the lack of works using behaviour as an endpoint and oligochaetes as test species. Maboeta et al. (1999) 

concluded that growth of some oligochaetes (P. excavatus) was a sensitive endpoint for lead toxicity. 

Growth of L. variegatus was particularly sensitive to lead and was affected by the exposure to 

contaminated sediments. Lowest observed effect concentration for growth was 30.0 mg/Kg. Worms 

exposed to lead concentrations above 15.0 mg/Kg grew slowly than non-exposed worms; hence growth 

was inhibited by exposure to lead-contaminated sediment. After the short-term test it was obvious that 

growth was inhibited but when the exposure was prolonged (long-term test), growth inhibition was clearly 

higher. Nevertheless, long-term tests are more adjusted to confirm effects on growth and even 

reproduction. Short-term tests are very useful for identifying highly toxic chemicals but do not test key life 

stage events during which sensitivity to toxicants may be increased (Scarlett et al, 2007). The exposure to 

lead will affect the presence of this species in nature and its health, because of interference in growth 

process. Growth proved to be a sensitive endpoint to lead toxicity.  

L. variegatus does not have a chitinous exoskeleton and can only accumulate toxics in soft 

tissues, simplifying the interpretation of the relationship between survival and body concentrations of toxic 

materials (Meyer et al, 2002). Considerably quantities of lead were found in the worms’ whole-body. 

Chloragogen cells of lumbricid worms (such as L. variegatus), which surround the gut and the large blood 

vessels, contain numerous granules named chloragosomes that are able, among other abilities, of bind 

toxic cations and organic xenobiotcs, enabling the worms to survive mild poisonings (Fischer, 1977). It 

has also been documented that chloragosomes are involved in the accumulation and immobilization of 

metals (Ireland and Richards, 1977; Morgan and Morgan, 1989).  According to Aisember et al (2005), the 

levels of lead concentration in L. variegatus and the levels of metal exposure showed strong positive 

correlations in 48h short-term tests, which could be described by highly significant linear regression 



 

   47 

equations. This data is consistent with our results, which showed that worms exposed to higher 

concentrations of lead presented a higher value of metal in the whole-body. The uptake of lead by L. 

variegatus in the long-term test was linearly related to the nominal concentration of the metal in the 

experiment, which implies that a steady state was not reached. Similar results were obtained by Mino et 

al (2006). When comparing biomass data from short-term and long-term tests (Figure 7), it was observed 

that control and worms exposed to 15.0 mg/Kg presented much higher biomass after long-term exposure 

then after short-term exposure. For all the other concentrations, short-term and long-term tests presented 

similar values of biomass and these results were consisting with mortality and growth data. 

For behaviour, at the end of the short-term test only concentrations of 80.0 and 150.0 mg/Kg 

were significant different (p&lt;0.05) from control worms. But at the end of the long-term test behaviour of 

worms exposed to all concentrations above 30.0 mg/Kg was significant different (p&lt;0.05) from control. In 

general, exposures to lead concentrations above 30.0 mg/Kg resulted in a significant (p&lt;0.05) decrease 

in activity. Locomotion and peristaltic movements were endpoints extremely sensitive to lead exposure: 

along 28 days both behaviours were strongly inhibited. From the results of the MFB recordings, it is clear 

that they cannot replace standard endpoint for short-term and long-term sediment toxicity tests, but the 

data suggests that useful information can be obtained from recording the behaviour of L. variegatus in the 

MFB. Some studies already showed that behaviour can be a powerful tool when assessing metal 

exposure. O’Gara et al (2004) observed that copper induces in locomotor behavior of L. variegatus. 

Untersteiner et al (2005) successfully used behaviour of Crustacea to access cadmium pollution.

The adverse effects of lead exposure on the behavioural function noted in this study would be 

expect to reduce the ability of L. variegatus to escape from predators, which may increase predation 

compared to unexposed worms, and thus facilitate the transfer of metal lead from benthic oligochaetes to 

organisms occupying higher trophic levels. Although behaviour cannot replace standard toxicity 

endpoints, we suggest that it should be introduced as an additional parameter. It is a fast approach (faster 

than mortality and growth) thus important in early warning systems and results can be obtained at 

ecological relevant concentrations (lower that lethal concentrations), which not always happen with 

mortality and growth. Behaviour integrates many cellular processes as is essential to the viability of the 

organism, population and community. Therefore, observations of behaviour provide a unique toxicological 

perspective: one that links the biochemical and ecological consequences of environmental contamination 

(Little, 1990). Because behaviour is important in activities such as predator avoidance, sexual interactions 

and feeding, an impact on behaviour leads to an impact on population dynamics. As hypothesised, 

detecting early warning signals of exposed worms was possible, proving that behavioural parameters may 



 

   49 

be included in risk assessment protocols. 

 

Conclusions 

Exposure to lead affects the presence of L. variegatus in nature, because interferes in the 

growth process, indicating that growth is a sensitive endpoint for lead toxicity. Behaviour as a test 

parameters showed great potential and provided important data and we suggest that should be 

introduced as a new parameter in toxicity tests.

Abstract 

Contaminants such as pesticides can cause direct toxic effects when released into aquatic 

environments.  Sensitive and suitable species can help understand and predict the impacts of such 

pollutants. Automated sediment toxicity testing and biomonitoring has grown rapidly. Biomonitoring 

instruments have been proven appropriate in the study of the effects of pollutants. A new approach in 

online biomonitoring, using a Multispecies Freshwater Biomonitor  (MFB), was developed in the present 

study using whole-sediment toxicity tests and behavioural responses of the freshwater oligochaete 

Lumbriculus variegatus. Endpoints such as mortality and growth were used to study the effects of the 

pesticide imidacloprid (family neonicotinoids) and to achieve a gradient of responses. Exposures to 

contaminated sediments were performed during 10 days (short-term tests) and 28 days (long-term tests). 

High mortality was observed in the three highest concentrations of imidacloprid. An inhibition of behaviour 

was observed along the gradient of the pesticide concentration. The exposure to imidacloprid-

contaminated sediments affected growth, behaviour and avoidance of L. variegatus.

Introduction 

Mortality, bioaccumulation, growth and reproduction have been the most common endpoints used in the 

vast majority of studies in environmental toxicology (Leppänen and Kukkonen, 1998). There is a lack of 

data regarding sublethal toxicological endpoints, such as effects on growth, reproduction, morphology or 

behaviour. Without this kind of information, the complex biological actions cannot be fully understood and 

reliable predictions of ecological impacts of environmental toxicants cannot be made (Rogge and Drewes, 

1993). During the last decades, there was an increasing interest in investigating sublethal endpoints 

(Aisemberg et al, 2005). Behaviour is probably an important path to search for mechanisms of toxicity 

(Macedo-Sousa et al, 2007). Once a behaviour can be quantified, it has the potential to be used as a 

biomarker in the assessment of stress (Beitinger, 1990). Biomonitoring offers an appealing tool for the 

assessment of metal pollution in aquatic ecosystem (Zhou et al, 2008), and should rely on sublethal 

endpoints rather than mortality alone (Macedo-Sousa et al, 2007) 

Aquatic species are important contributors to the functioning of lotic foodwebs (Benke and 

Jacobi, 1994; Thorp and Delong, 2002), reason why they were chosen as test species in the present 

study. Oligochaete worms are key marcoinvertebrate constituents of terrestrial and freshwater 

ecosystems (Edwards and Lofty, 1977; Brinkhurst and Gelder, 1991). Locomotion and other behavioural 

activities of these organisms are significant determinants of the physical, chemical, and biological 

properties of soils and sediments. In addition, locomotor functions are the cornerstone of such vital 

functions as foraging, sexual reproduction, predator avoidance, dispersal, and general orientation to 

environmental cues (Drewes, 1997). Aquatic oligochaetes have an extremely long history of use in 

pollution assessments (Chapman, 2001). Lumbriculus variegatus (Müller 1774) is recommended for use 

in toxicity tests with sediments based on ease of culture and handling, known chemical exposure history, 

adequate tissue mass for chemical analysis, tolerance to a wide range of sediment physical-chemical 

characteristics, low sensitivity to contaminants associated with sediment, and amenability to long-term 

exposures without feeding (Ingersoll et al, 2003). Judging by the number of internationally published 

articles, the most common oligochaete species used in evaluations of freshwater toxicity has been L. 



 

 59 

variegatus (Leppanen, 1999; Aisemberg et al, 2005). This species was proposed by the American Society 

of Testing and Materials (ASTM, 1995) as a standard organism for tests of sediment bioaccumulation and 

is listed by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 1992) as a good 

organism for bioaccumulation studies. L. variegatus is a freshwater oligochaete known to have 

remarkable powers of segmental regeneration (Hyman, 1916). Reproduction under laboratory conditions 

is always by asexual fragmentation, during which a worm spontaneously divides into two or more body 

fragments. Each surviving fragment then undergoes rapid regeneration of body segments to form a new 

head, tail, or both ends (Lesiuk and Drewes, 1999).  

All pesticides found on the market have been evaluated by sets of standardized protocols (the 

so-called a priori evaluation). One of the aims of these standardized tests is to evaluate the negative 

effects of pesticides on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Since the direct impact on ecosystems is 

difficult to study, these tests are based on detrimental effects observed upon a set of model organisms, 

which play key roles in ecosystem structure and function. However, although the European Comission 

(EC) encouraged development of tests determining sublethal effects on model organisms, most of these 

protocols focused on mortality (Capowiez et al, 2005). The EC recognized the importance of sublethal 

tests for earthworms in particular when the active substance is potentially persistent or multi-applied (EC 

2003). Imidacloprid [1-(6-chloro-3-pyridylmethyl)-2nitroimino-imidazolidine] is a relatively new systemic 

insecticide (product names: AdmireTM, Confidor®, Gaucho® and Provado®). It was the first member of a 

new family called neonicotinoids and is chemically related to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) 

agonists nicotine and epibatidine (Matsuda et al, 2001). It acts as an agonist of acetylcholine (Bai et al., 

1991) and is therefore effective against many insects currently resistant to carbamates, 

organophosphates, and pyrethroids. It was first introduced to the UK in 1998, and is now marketed in 

more than 120 countries to protect more than 140 crops (Simms et al, 2006). It is widely used in 

agriculture for controlling sucking insects, as a seed dressing, for soil treatment, and as a foliar treatment 

in a variety of crops and orchards. It is also used for controlling cockroaches and termites and is found in 

many domestic products used for pets and gardens (Cox, 2001). Some studies have shown that 



 

 60 

imidacloprid can induce behaviour modifications in parasitoid hymenoptera (Stapel et al, 2000) and 

termites (Thorne and Breisch, 2001) (namely foraging and burrowing activity, respectively). Effects of 

imidacloprid on earthworms have not been yet extensively studied (Capowiez and Berard, 2006). Luo et 

al (1999) and Zang et al (2000) found sperm deformities in Eisenia fetida at imidacloprid concentrations 

as low as 0.5 mg/kg of dry soil. More recently, Mostert et al (2000, 2002) showed that the LC50 for worms 

of the Pheretima group was 3 mg/kg of dry soil and no effect was observed on earthworm weight at 0.66 

mg/kg of dry soil. Finally, Lal et al (2001) observed a decrease in the production of earthworm casts over 

120 days in field conditions. Capowiez et al (2003) realized that the behaviour of earthworms was 

significantly altered (decrease in burrow length, rate of burrow reuse, and distance covered) for 

concentrations of imidacloprid between 0.5 and 1 mg/kg of dry soil.  

Imidacloprid has been found in streams and rivers and is likely to be bioavailable to aquatic 

organisms.  Because there were few studies on the toxicity of imidacloprid to relevant lotic species 

(Alexander et al, 2007), here we investigated the impact of imidacloprid on the behaviour of the aquatic 

oligochaete L. variegatus. In this study, a new automated sediment toxicity test using L. variegatus was 

developed to assess differences between short-term and long-term exposures to different concentrations 

of the pesticide. In addition, this study was an attempt to investigate the use of the behaviour of L. 

variegatus as a tool to assess sublethal effects of a toxic substance. Our hypothesis was that the 

exposure to the pesticide would cause behavioural early warning responses, particularly on locomotion 

and peristaltic movements. 

 

Material and Methods 

Culture - Laboratory cultures of Lumbriculus variegatus (Müller 1774) used throughout these tests 

originated from the University of Joensuu, Finland.  Animals were reared in a PE (Polyethylene) aquarium 

(8.5 x 17.5 x 12 cm), covered with lids, containing ASTM (ASTM, 1980) medium (pH 7.6 ± 0.3), at 20ºC, 

in a controlled temperature (CT) room (16:8h light:dark cycle and 50% humidity). A commercially available 

sand-pebble mixture (grain sizes: 0-8 mm) was acid washed (pH 2), ashed (4h, 450ºC) and used as 



 

 61 

sediment. Aquariums contained a 2 cm layer of sediment with continuous and moderated aeration. The 

worms were fed with approximately 5mg/30 worms of Tetraphyll, applied 2 or 3 times a week. 

 

Spiking - Whole-sediment (sediment and associated pore water that have had minimal manipulation (US 

EPA, 2000)) used in the experiments had the following characteristics: 4.9% sand, 74.4% clay and 20.7% 

silt; pH of pore water 6.77; ammonia of pore water 3.04 mg/Kg; total carbon content 0.54%. Solutions 

were prepared by dissolving the appropriate amount of imidacloprid (C9H10ClN5O2; supplied by Sigma 

Aldrich) in distilled water. These solutions were added immediately. Then, the sediment was capped and 

rapidly shaken for 1 min. The spiked sediments equilibrated in the dark (due to the light sensitivity of the 

pesticide) for a minimum of 48h, to allow the imidacloprid to adsorb to the sediment particles. During this 

time, sediments were shaken every day during approximately 2 min. Contaminated water was replaced 

by ASTM water before adding the worms. Nominal imidacloprid concentrations in the sediment were 0 

(control of uncontaminated sediment), 0.05, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 mg/Kg. Sediment was sampled for 

imidacloprid analysis at the start and termination of each test; the overlying medium (ASTM) was sampled 

only at the end of tests. 

 

Exposure design – Two tests were performed: one short-term (10-day) and one long-term (28-day), both 

with contaminated sediment and clean water. Exposures were conducted at ± 20ºC, in a CT-room (16:8h 

light:dark cycle and 50% humidity), in 100 mL plastic beakers, containing 35 g of whole sediment and 20 

mL of ASTM, in a static system. Seven replicates per concentration were used, each with six young 

worms (about 1.5 cm), totalling 42 organisms per concentration, carefully introduced into the beakers with 

the help of a plastic Pasteur pipette. Mortality, growth (size class 1: worm &amp;lt;2cm; size class 2: 2cm, &amp;lt;

worm &amp;lt;2.5cm; size class 3: worm &gt; 2.5 cm), colour and presence in sediment or water were monitored, 

every 48h for the short-term test and every 5 days for the long-term test. For the monitoring, worms were 

removed from test beakers and carefully observed and measured.  Sediments were replaced by newly 

spiked ones every 5 days, for both tests. During the long-term test, worms were fed once a week with 2.4 



 

 62 

mg of Tetraphyll per beaker; no food was added during the short-term test. The surviving worms were 

collected and dried at 40ºC, for about 24h and then weighed. Before drying, worms were rinsed rapidly in 

distilled water and gently dried with filter paper. There was no attempt to remove sediment from L. 

variegatus intestines, by allowing a depuration period (putting the worms in water for 24h), because an 

increase in the water content of worms could decrease or erase negative effects on weight (Dalby et al. 

1996, Capowiez et al. 2005). Imidacloprid in water, sediment and whole-body samples was analysed, 

after extraction with acetonitrile by HPLC-UV at 270 nm (Limit of quantitation (LOQ): 0.1 µg/L for water, 

0.001 mg/Kg for sediment and 0.01 mg/Kg for whole-body). Prior to analysis sediment, water and whole-

body samples were kept in the dark. Biomass (dry weight of surviving organisms divided by the initial 

number of organisms, according to US EPA, 2000) was also calculated. 

 

Multispecies Freshwater Biomonitor - The Multispecies Freshwater Biomonitor® (MFB), suitable for both 

invertebrates and vertebrates, measures online different behaviours of aquatic species and it is based on 

the registration of changes in a high frequency alternating current, that is caused by movements of the 

organisms in their test chambers (Gerhardt et al., 1994; Gerhardt, 2000). The individual test organism is 

placed in a flow-through cylindrical test chamber with two pairs of stainless steel-plate electrodes, 

attached at the opposite chamber walls (Figure 1). A high-frequency alternating current signal (100kHz) is 

sent by one electrode pair across the chamber, while the second pair (not current carrying) detects 

changes in impedance – the electrical field change due to organisms’ movements.

Different types of behaviour (movements) generate characteristical electrical signals (Gerhardt, 1999, 

2000), that can be characterized by their amplitude and frequency. Using L. variegatus two different 

movements can be measured: peristaltic movements (band 1: 0.5 – 1 Hz) and locomotion (band 2: 1 – 3 

Hz). The electrical signals are then processed by a discrete Fast Fourier Transformation and generate a 

histogram of the occurrence of all frequencies in % (summarized in intervals of O.S Hz from 0 to 10 Hz), 

hence yielding a ”fingerprint” of the behavioural pattern of the organism. This transformation gives the 

percentage of occurrence of each single frequency during each record period. Records occur over a 4 

min period, with an interval of 6 min between records. This method has already shown to be a valuable 

biomonitoring and toxicity testing tool using epi-benthic crustaceans, insects, as well as planktonic and 

pelagic species of fish and tadpoles (Gerhardt, 2000). Behavioural responses may have a role in 

searching mechanisms of toxicity and the MFB, as a sophisticated device, may help to explore those 

mechanisms (Gerhardt et al 2005). The behaviour of the worms was tested and recorded using the MFB. 

For these tests, seven worms  from each concentration (one per replicate) were used and behaviour was 

record during 2h (plus 30 min acclimation period). Chambers (1cm diameter, 4 cm length) were filled with 



 

 64 

50% ASTM water and 50% whole-sediment and three chambers were used as control, filled as the others 

and without worms. Chambers with one single worm were connected to the MFB and settings were made 

for channel information, noise level (50 mV) and threshold value (Gerhardt and Schmidt, 2002) to obtain 

response data for the analysis of signal frequencies.  

 

Statistical analysis - Linear regression analyses were carried out using Excel software package 

(Microsoft, USA). For each tested concentration, selected behavioural signal frequencies (0 – 1Hz and 1 – 

3 Hz), were plotted over time. Normality and homoscedasticity were tested using the Software Package 

SigmaStat for Windows, version 3.5. Original behavioural MFB data were arcsin transformed and the 

overall effect of imidacloprid concentrations on population behaviour was investigated using a Kruskal-

Wallis one-way ANOVA on ranks (p&lt;0.001), followed by a post hoc Dunn’s test (p&lt;0.05) to check for 

significant differences (Zar 1996). 

 

Results  

Short-term Test  

Colour of worms showed no change when exposed to imidacloprid: colour was always normal 

(reddish brown). Avoidance was measured by counting the number of worms that were not in the 

sediment. As seen in Figure 2, L. variegatus clearly avoided contaminated sediments and the avoidance 

was higher (100%) on sediments contaminated with higher concentrations of the pesticide. For worms 

exposed to 0.05 and 0.5 mg/Kg, avoidance increased along the test days.

Mortality (Figure 3) on control was very low (2%), demonstrating that the holding facilities and 

handling techniques were acceptable for conducting such tests, as required in the standard protocol 

where mean survival for control should be 90% (ASTM, 1990). After 10 days of exposure, high mortalities 

were observed in worms exposed to 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 mg/Kg. There was a clear positive relation between 

mortality and imidacloprid concentrations: higher mortalities were observed in worms exposed to higher 

pesticide concentrations. A power trendline  (R2 = 0.838) shows that mortality increased at a specific rate. 

All tested concentrations induced a growth inhibition: in fact, worms exposed to higher concentrations (2.5 

and 5.0 mg/Kg) did not grow at all. After the short-term test, it was clear that the growth of the worms was 

inhibited by the exposure to sediments contaminated with imidacloprid (Figure 4). All tested 

concentrations clearly inhibited the worm’s growth and a linear correlation was found between pesticide 

concentrations and L. variegatus growth (R2 = 0.84). Biomass is, according to USEPA (2000), the dry 

weight of surviving organisms divided by the initial number of organisms. Biomass data (Table I) 

corroborated the results of mortality and growth. As expected, biomass decreased with increasing 



 

 66 

imidacloprid concentrations, because mortality was higher and growth was lower. The exponential 

trendline (Figure 4) also shows that biomass values decreased at increasingly higher rates of 

imidacloprid.

Behavioural tests showed that exposure to imidacloprid strongly inhibited both locomotion and 

peristaltic movements (Figure 5). Control worms showed higher activities; activities decreased with the 

increase of pesticide concentrations. Variances were not homogeneously distributed but the results of the 

one-way ANOVA on ranks indicated a significant concentration effect (p&lt;0.05), for both locomotion and 

peristaltic movements.

Sediment, Water and Whole-body Analysis 

Concentrations of pesticide present in the initial and final sediment samples were as expected 

(Table II), confirming the adequacy of the protocol designed to spike sediments with imidacloprid. 

Differences were found between initial and final values of imidacloprid in the sediment: at the end of 10 

days and despite the frequent sediment change, the concentration of the pesticide was much lower. 

Water samples collected at the end of the test presented some imidacloprid due to pesticide degradation 

and to collection of worms from the sediment for measurement and observation.  As expected, whole-

body tissues presented a higher level of Imidacloprid when exposed to higher concentrations of the toxic 

(Table I). Worms exposed to higher levels of imidacloprid (2.5 and 5.0 mg/Kg) had higher concentrations 

of the pesticide in the whole-body tissues, which confirms a great ability to absorb and store this toxic. 

The concentration of imidacloprid in the worm’s whole-body (Figure 6) increased at increasingly higher 



 

 69 

rates of the pesticide (exponential trendline R2 = 0.87).

Long-term Test 

Parameters such as colour showed no change when exposed of imidacloprid: colour was 

always normal (reddish brown). This species clearly avoided sediments contaminated with imidacloprid 

(Figure 7), with values of 100% avoidance for concentrations of 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 mg/Kg since day 5. 

Avoidance of worms exposed to 0.05 and 0.5 mg/Kg increased along the test days, with similar results to 

the ones found in short-term tests. Despite not being one of the endpoint in evaluation, reproduction was 

observed during the long-term test, but only on control worms by the 20th day of exposure. Worms 

exposed to any of the used imidacloprid concentrations did not reproduce, which indicates that exposure 

to this pesticide inhibits L. variegatus reproduction.

Figure 8. Total mortality (%) of L. variegatus at the end of the long-term test. 

 

After 28 days of exposure all worms exposed to 0.5, 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 mg/Kg died (Figure 8) and 

no mortality occurred in the controls. There was a clear positive logarithmic relation (R2 = 0.86) between 

mortality and imidacloprid concentrations: the rate of change in the data increases quickly and then levels 

out. All concentrations inhibited the growth of L. variegatus (Figure 9). Only specimens from the lowest 

imidacloprid level (0.05 mg/Kg) grew, although less than in the control. As observed for the short-term 

test, biomass data (Table III) corroborated the results of mortality and growth: biomass value decreased 

with the increase of lead concentration, because worms grew less and mortalities were higher.

Behavioural tests (Figure 10) showed that both locomotion and peristaltic movements were 

affected by the exposure to contaminated sediments, and activities decreased with the increasing of the 



 

 73 

imidacloprid concentration. Although both behaviours were affected, after day 15 it was clear that 

locomotion was much more inhibited than peristaltic movements, which means that although worms 

present some activity their locomotion was strongly reduced. Locomotion has been found to be a 

consistently sensitive measure of toxic stress for a wide range of environmental contamination (Little and 

Finger, 1990).  

Variances were not homogeneously distributed but the results of the one-way ANOVA on ranks 

indicated in general a significant concentration effect (p&lt;0.05), for both locomotion and peristaltic 

movements.

Sediment, Water and Whole-body Analysis 

Concentrations of imidacloprid present in the initial and final sediment samples had values as 

expected (Table IV), thus the spiking method was correct and was well performed. Concentrations of the 

pesticide in the initial sediment samples presented values close to the nominal concentrations, but final 

samples had low imidacloprid concentrations.  Although an effort was made to renew contaminated 

sediments to maintain the toxic concentration, the fast degradation of the pesticide made it not possible. 

Water samples collected at the end of the 28 days test presented very low values of imidacloprid. Due to 

low survival and very high mortalities (100%), analysis of imidacloprid present in worm’s whole-body are 

not of relevance.

Discussion 

Pesticides are designed to kill rapidly and degrade but insecticides, such as imidacloprid, 

despite being highly toxic, are degraded gradually after application (Laskowsky, 2001). The survival 



 

 75 

probability of organisms that are able to stay alive the first days after a pesticide application increases as 

the environmental concentration of the pesticide decreases with time due to biodegradation (Laskowsky, 

2001). The design of our tests did not account for this situation, since several renewals of contaminated 

sediment were performed. 

Mortality showed different trends for short and long-term tests. For short-term tests, mortality 

increased at a specific rate, following a power trendline. A logarithmic trendline was observed for long-

term tests: the rate of change increases quickly and then levels out. This indicates, as expected, that 

results for short-term tests represent just the initial response of the organisms to the toxic exposure.  Total 

mortality was higher at the end of the long-term test than at the end of short-term test, which means that 

mortality increased over time, as expected. Growth of L. variegatus was particularly affected by the 

exposure to contaminated sediments.  

The lowest observed effect concentration of imidacloprid for growth was 0.05 mg/Kg: exposed 

worms grew slower than non-exposed worms. Hence, growth was inhibited by exposure to imidacloprid-

contaminated sediments, in both short and long-term tests. Nevertheless, as expected, long-term tests 

are more appropriate to confirm effects on growth and reproduction. Acute (short-term) tests are very 

useful for identifying highly toxic chemicals but do not test key life stage events during which sensitivity to 

toxicants may be increased (Scarlett et al, 2007). Because L. variegatus does not have a chitinous 

exoskeleton it can only accumulate toxics in soft tissues, simplifying the interpretation of the relationship 

between survival and body concentrations of toxic materials (Meyer et al, 2002). Considerable quantities 

of imidacloprid were found in the worm’s whole-body tissues. Chloragogen cells of lumbricid worms (such 

as L. variegatus), which surround the gut and the large blood vessels, contain numerous granules named 

chloragosomes that are able of binding toxic cations and organic xenobiotcs, enabling the worms to 

survive mild poisoning (Fischer, 1977). Contaminants may accumulate from ingested sediment particles 

by desorption followed by absorption across the gut wall in the presence of digestive fluids (Weston et al. 

2000), which can explain the high values of imidacloprid present in the whole-body tissues. 

Using acute mortality estimates alone it is not possible to predict how a population’s growth rate 



 

 76 

will respond or change, hence the assessment of a xenobiotic based solely on acute mortality estimates 

would lead to flawed conclusions about a population’s exposure response (Walthall and Stark, 1997). 

Acute lethal concentration estimates are a poor estimator of population level endpoints such as the 

population growth rate. This may be due to the ability of surviving individuals, of species’ with high 

reproductive rates, to act as ‘‘reservoirs’’ and compensate for lost individuals following toxicant exposure. 

Thus, application of the population growth rate as a measure of sublethal effects is more relevant and 

predictive than lethal concentration estimates when determining the potential impact of a xenobiotic on a 

population (Walthall and Stark, 1997). 

As hypothesised, detecting early warming signals of exposed worms was possible, proving that 

behavioural parameters may be included in risk assessment protocols. These experiments showed that 

imidacloprid significantly changed the behaviour of L. variegatus, in terms of both locomotion and 

peristaltic movements, confirming the findings of Alexander et al (2007). The reduction in oligochaete 

movement could increase predation risk by limiting the ability to avoid capture (Drewes, 1997). Previous 

experiments using earthworms showed that imidacloprid can also change the burrowing behaviour for 

concentrations between 0.5 and 1 mg/kg (Capowiez et al. 2003). In another experiment, Capowiez et al. 

(2006) observed that several aspects of the earthworm behaviour (distance travelled, oscillations) or of 

the resulting burrow systems (area, topology, sinuosity and depth) were affected by imidacloprid 

concentrations. The high water solubility and low Koc of this chemical indicate a low tendency to be 

adsorbed to soil particles.  Field studies show that imidacloprid can persist in soil, with a half-life ranging 

from 27 to 229 days (Miles Inc., 1993). In laboratory studies, imidacloprid has a half-life greater than one 

year in oxygenated sand loam soil (US EPA, 1994). It is not easy to homogeneously spike sediments with 

a contaminant. Bearing this in mind, the effectiveness of our spiking protocol appears satisfactory. 

Decrease in biomass seems to be a sensitive endpoint, since it was possible to detect 

decreases in biomass even at low concentrations of imidacloprid. Capowiez et al (2005) observed that 

weight loss of earthworms was a sensitive biomarker for exposure to imidacloprid even for low 

concentrations (0.5 mg/Kg dry soil). To explain weight decrease, these authors proposed different but not 



 

 77 

exclusive factors: (1) inactivity, as a direct response to the insecticide or as a mechanism of avoidance, or 

(2) physiological causes such as less efficient assimilation or development of a costly mechanism of 

detoxification. We believe that these two factors may also be the responsibles for the biomass decrease 

observed in the present study. 

An interesting observation was that both on short and long-term tests all worms exposed to 

concentrations above 0.05 mg/Kg that survived were found together in one single aggregate. This seems 

to be also a result of the exposure to imidacloprid and raises many questions. Is it a defence mechanism? 

Will it help the worms survive longer? Further investigation is needed to address these questions. 

Oligochaetes feed on subsurface sediments and egest onto the sediment surface, hence 

recycling deposited material. In high worm densities, reworking can considerably modify the structure of 

sediments (Krezoski &amp;amp; Robbins, 1985; McCall &amp;amp; Fisher, 1980). Thus, when imidacloprid presence affects 

the survival, growth and behaviour of L. variegatus it is also affecting the balance of the ecosystem. As it 

is likely that behaviour inhibition could have a severe effect on oligochaete performance in the 

environment, this endpoint is important to evaluate the impacts of pollutants and pesticides on sediment 

ecosystems. Although behaviour cannot replace standard toxicity endpoints, we suggest that it should be 

introduced as an additional parameter. It is a fast approach (faster than mortality and growth) thus 

important in early warning systems and results can be obtained at ecological relevant concentrations 

(lower that lethal concentrations), which not always happen with mortality and growth. Behaviour 

integrates many cellular processes as is essential to the viability of the organism, population and 

community. Therefore, observations of behaviour provide a unique toxicological perspective: one that 

links the biochemical and ecological consequences of environmental contamination (Little, 1990). 

Because behaviour is important in activities such as predator avoidance, sexual interactions and feeding, 

an impact on behaviour leads to an impact on population dynamics.  

 

Conclusions 

The pesticide imidacloprid proved to affect the presence of L. variegatus, because reduces 



 

 78 

survival, inhibits behaviour, interferes in the growth process and can shorten the lifespan of the species. 

Growth and avoidance proved to be sensitive sublethal endpoints to imidacloprid contamination. 

Behaviour tests should be conducted in addition to classical sediment tests.

Abstract 

The abandoned São Domingos mine (southern Portugal) is a potentially good site for 

ecotoxicological studies, due to a pH and metal gradient of acid mine drainage (AMD). To 

evaluate the toxicity of several sediments from an abandoned cupric pyrite mine, the aquatic 

oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus was used as a test organism and behaviour was one of the 

endpoints. L. variegatus is a freshwater oligochaete, largely used in toxicity tests and presents a 

remarkable ability to regenerate. Behavioural stress responses were monitored online with the 

Multispecies Freshwater Biomonitor (MFB). Metal and metalloid pollution at a disused pyrite mine 

were investigated by considering five sediment samples as representatives of the different pH 

values of the area. Five sediments were collected at São Domingos Mine, their characteristics 

analysed and ecotoxicological tests were performed. Survival, growth, avoidance, as well as 

behaviour were monitored. Results showed poor sediment quality in most of the collected 

sediments. High mortalities were observed in this study, ranging from 100% to 32.6%, which 

indicates severe contamination. Our data demonstrated that collected sediments did not support 

good L. variegatus growth and significantly changed and reduced the behaviour of L. variegatus, 

in terms of both locomotion and peristaltic movements.

Introduction 

Metal polluted sites represent a potentially hazardous risk for human health and the 

environment (Martinéz-Sánchez et al., 2007). Abandoned mines can be responsible for several 

impacts in their surrounding environment due to the chemical nature of their effluents (Boult et al., 

1994). The dissolution of metals from the sulphide ores in contact with oxygen can cause acid 

mine runoffs, even after mining activity has ceased, with consequent release of acid mine 

drainage (AMD) (Kelly, 1991). AMD is known to cause major environmental problems in river and 

floodplain water and sediment quality (Lottermoser, 2003). São Domingos Mine (Portugal) 

sediments are severely contaminated with metals (MINEO, 2003) but the extension of such 

contamination has not been investigated. One of the major challenges in assessing the ecological 

risk associated with exposure to contaminated sediments is the presence of chemical mixtures. 

Field-collected sediments, as a rule, contain complex mixtures of chemicals and other factors that 

influence toxic response (US EPA, 2005). A critical factor for sediment toxicity is contaminant’s 

bioavailability – the degree to which contaminants can be taken up by plants and animals (Ankley 

et al., 1996). Sediment parameters that affect metal bioavailability include cation exchange 

capacity, total organic carbon (TOC), iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) oxides and acide volatile 

sulfides (AVS) (Bentivegna et al., 2004). 

Biomonitoring should rely on sublethal endpoints rather than mortality alone (Macedo-

Sousa et al., 2007). Biomonitoring instruments have been proven to have the best deterrent effect 

upon pollutants (Gerhardt, 2000) addressing the need to determine the effects of pollutants on 

benthic invertebrates (Macedo-Sousa et al., 2007). Behavioural changes may have ecological 

consequences, e.g. avoidance behaviour or decreased activity may influence population levels by 

affecting migration or susceptibility to predation (Gerhardt, 1995). Behaviour is probably an 

important path to search for mechanisms of toxicity (Macedo-Sousa et al., 2007) and behavioural 

endpoints are more sensitive than mortality tests (Gerhardt, 1995), reflecting different levels of 

susceptibly of organisms to environmental stimuli and are, therefore, appropriate indicators for 

biomonitoring purposes (Gerhardt et al., 1994; Ulfstrand, 1996). Once a determined behaviour 

can be quantified, it has the potential to be used as a biomarker in the assessment of stress 



 89 

(Beitinger, 1990). Online biomonitoring represents a continuous and automated biotest, that 

strives for detect early warming signals from specimens when those react to the stress of being 

exposed to a toxic. The assumption is that behaviour of organisms will change rapidly and 

sensitively because of the presence of toxic substances. Furthermore, the detection of early 

warning signals is ecologically more relevant, faster, and cheaper than chemical detection of a 

selection of chemicals (Gerhardt, 1999). 

Oligochaete worms are key marcoinvertebrate constituents of terrestrial and freshwater 

ecosystems (Edwards and Lofty, 1977; Brinkhurst and Gelder, 1991). Their locomotor and other 

behavioural activities are significant determinants of the physical, chemical and biological 

properties of soils and sediments (Drewes, 1997). Testing sediments for toxicity generally relies 

on the use of test organisms (Bentivegna et al., 2004) and aquatic oligochaetes have an 

extremely long history of use for pollution assessments (Chapman, 2001).  Lumbriculus 

variegatus (Müller 1774) is recommended for use in toxicity tests with sediments based on ease 

of culture and handling, known chemical exposure history, adequate tissues mass for chemical 

analysis, tolerance of a wide range of sediment physical-chemical characteristics, low sensitivity 

(in terms of mortality) to contaminants associated with sediment, and amenability to long-term 

exposures without feeding (Ingersoll et al., 2003). This species has been proposed by the 

American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM, 1995) as a standard organism for tests of 

sediment bioaccumulation and is listed by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and 

Development (OECD, 1992) as a good organism for bioaccumulation studies. L. variegatus is a 

freshwater oligochaete known to have remarkable powers of segmental regeneration (Hyman, 

1916). Reproduction under laboratory conditions is always by asexual fragmentation, during 

which a worm spontaneously divides into two or more body fragments (Lesiuk and Drewes, 

1999). 

In this research work, the Multispecies Freshwater BiomonitorTM (MFB) was used to 

develop a new approach for online biomonitoring. This new approach combined behavioural and 

standard toxicity parameters, such as mortality and growth of L. variegatus. Behaviour was 

chosen because its fast response time and sub-lethal sensitivity (Gerhardt, 1999). The main goal 



 90 

of this work was to evaluate the toxicity of sediments from an abandoned cupric pyrite mine. We 

assessed sediment toxicity by measuring the 10-day mortality, growth and behaviour of L. 

variegatus. Other tested parameters included TOC, AVS, grain size and metals in sediment and 

in whole-body. 

 

Materials and Methods 

Culture - Laboratory cultures of L. variegatus used throughout these tests originated from the 

University of Joensuu, Finland. Organisms reared in a PE (Polyethylene) aquarium (8.5 x 17.5 x 

12 cm), covered with lids, containing ASTM (ASTM, 1980) medium (pH 7.6 ± 0.3), at 20ºC, in a 

controlled temperature (CT) room (16:8h light:dark cycle and 50% humidity). A commercially 

available sand-pebble mixture (grain sizes: 0-8 mm) was acid washed (pH 2), ashed (4h, 450ºC) 

and used as sediment. Cultures were maintained in a plastic aquarium contained a 2 cm layer of 

sediment with continuous and moderated aeration. The worms were fed with approximately 

5mg/30 worms of Tetraphyll, applied 2 or 3 times a week.

Study site and sample collection - Located in southern Portugal [37 39’ 56’’ N, 7 28’ 46’’ W] 

(Pereira et al., 1999) within the Alentejo Province, the São Domingos mining area (Figure 1) is 

integrated in the Iberian Pyrite Belt. The climate is semiarid and the mine has been abandoned 

for more than 30 years. The ore body was formed by a unique vertical mass of cupriferous pyrite 

associated to zinc and lead sulphide, hosted by the Volcanic Sedimentary Complex of 

Tournaisian age (Oliveira, 1997). It contains ores of pyrite (Fe, S), chalcopyrite (Fe, S, Cu), 

sphalerite (Zn, S) and galena (Pb, S) (MINEO, 2003). The area has not been submitted to any 

remediation measures until now (MINEO, 2003). Over the years, shafts and retention basins were 

filled with water and a continuous stream of AMD with a pH of 2.3 now flows down the main 

excavated valley toward the Chança River. Along its course, the AMD receives a few tributaries 

with pH 6 to 7, creating small mixing zones. By the time it reaches an artificial reservoir on the 

Chança River, the water pH may have climbed to 5 in rainy periods. However, the pH may remain 

very low in dry periods. At the confluence of the Mosteirão stream (southern Portugal) with the 

AMD main channel, a dynamic pH gradient between 6.4 and 2.3 exists over less than 200 m (De 

Bisthoven et al., 2004). The study area is situated at the confluence of the Mosteirão stream with 

the mine effluent. It represents an area with a natural pH and metal concentration gradient, where 

five sites with different pH and associated metals were investigated (sed-A – pH=2.5, sed-B – 

pH=3.5, sed-C – pH=4.5, sed-D – pH=5.5 and sed-E – pH=6.5; Figure 2). In addition, a pristine 

local reference site was taken on the River Vascão, flowing along the edge of the Parque Natural 

Vale do Guadiana, south of the mining belt. The area is anthropogenically unaffected, but 

situated in the same climatic ecoregion (Gerhardt et al, 2004). The following physical parameters 

were recorded at each site before sediment collection: pH, dissolved oxygen (mg/L), conductivity 

(mS/cm) and temperature (ºC). Because of high variation within a single location, it is important to 

take at least 3 to 5 subsite samples (Herr and Gray 1997). In this study, for each pH (each site), 

three replicates were collected, each with approximately 3kg (Herr and Gray 1997). Sediment 

samples were collected using plastic scoop (washed with 10% nitric acid and rinsed with distilled 

water to avoid any contamination) at all sampling sites, from the top 30mm of the oxidized layer 



 92 

(Herr and Gray 1997). Pre-sieving in the field through 2mm mesh using river water is a quick and 

efficient method of particle size separation, easing subsequent work in the laboratory (Herr and 

Gray 1997). Pre-sieving was performed in site for all the samples and replicates. Samples were 

labelled, placed in plastic containers and transported to the laboratory. In the laboratory, sediment 

from the three existing replicates was mixed and homogenised and then placed in plastic bags 

and frozen during 48 h, to prevent bacteria activity. Sediment was defrosted at room temperature 

prior to use. 

 

Figure 2. Sampling sites. 

 

Exposure design – Short-term (10 days) tests were performed using contaminated sediment 

collected at the Mine and clean ASTM medium (ASTM, 1980). Exposures were conducted at ± 

20ºC, in a CT-room (16:8h light:dark cycle and 50% humidity), in 100 mL plastic beakers, 

containing 2 cm of sediment and 20 mL of ASTM, in a static system. Seven replicates per site 

were used, each with seven young worms (about 1.5 cm), totalling 49 organisms per 

concentration, carefully introduced into the beakers with the help of a plastic Pasteur pipette.. 

Mortality/survival, size class/growth (size class 1: worm &amp;lt;2cm; size class 2: 2cm &amp;lt;worm &amp;lt;

2.5cm; size class 3: worm &gt; 2.5 cm), colour and avoidance were monitored and no food was 

added during the test. The survival worms were collected and dried at 40ºC, for about 24h and 

then weighed. Before drying, worms were rinsed rapidly in distilled water and gently dried with 



 93 

filter paper. There was no attempt to remove sediment from L. variegatus intestines, by allowing a 

recovery period (putting the worms in water for 24h), because an increase in the water content of 

worms could decrease or erase negative effects on weight (Dalby et al. 1996, Capowiez et al. 

2005). For sediment and whole-body samples the Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP-OES) 

method was used (ICP-OES acc. to DIN EN ISO 11885; Limit of quantitation (LOQ) for sediment 

and whole-body samples (mg/Kg): Cadmium (Cd): 0.1; Copper (Cu): 0.5; Zinc (Zn): 0.1; 

Manganese (Mn): 0.05; Lead (Pb): 0.5; Arsenic (As): 0.5; Iron (Fe): 0.1; Sulphur (S): 0.5. Biomass 

(dry weight of surviving organisms divided by the initial number of organisms, according to US 

EPA, 2000) was also calculated. Bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) were calculated for each metal 

according to the formula [BAF = metal concentration (mg/kg dry wt.) in tissue / metal 

concentration (mg/kg dry wt.) in sediment x 100%], according to Barron (1995). 

 

Behavioural responses - The MFB construction and functioning is described elsewhere (Gerhardt 

et al., 1999; Gerhardt, 2000). Briefly, it measures online different behaviours of aquatic species 

and it is based on the registration of changes in a high frequency alternating current, that is 

caused by movements of the organisms in their test chambers (Gerhardt et al., 1994; Gerhardt, 

2000). The individual test organism is placed in a flow-through cylindrical test chamber with two 

pairs of stainless steel-plate electrodes, attached at the opposite chamber walls (Figure 3).  

 

Figure 3. Constituents of the behavioural experiment (chambers, measuring instrument and 

lpatop computer). (adapted from Macedo-Sousa et al., 2007). 



 94 

Different types of behaviour (movements) generate characteristical electrical signals (Gerhardt, 

1999, 2000), that can be characterized by their amplitude and frequency. For L. variegatus two 

different movements can be measured: peristaltic movements (band 1: 0.5 – 1 Hz) and 

locomotion (band 2: 1 – 3 Hz). The electrical signals are then processed by a discrete Fast 

Fourier Transformation and generate a histogram of the occurrence of all frequencies in % 

(summarized in intervals of O.S Hz from 0 to 10 Hz), hence yielding a ”fingerprint” of the 

behavioural pattern of the organism. For these tests, seven worms  from each concentration (one 

per replicate) were used and behaviour was record during 2h (plus 30 min acclimation period). 

Measurement were recorded for 4 min, every 10 min. Chambers (1cm diameter, 4 cm length) 

were filled with 50% ASTM water and 50% sediment and three chambers were used as control, 

filled as the others but without worms. Chambers with one single worm were connected to the 

MFB and settings were made for channel information, noise level (50 mV) and threshold value 

(Gerhardt and Schmidt, 2002) to obtain response data for the analysis of signal frequencies. 

 

Statistical analysis – The statistical relationship between some sediment parameters and 

L.variegatus mortality was determined by bivariate correlation using Pearson coefficient in a two-

tailed test, p&lt;0.05. These statistical analyses were performed using Minitab software (version 

14.1). For each tested sediment, selected behavioural signal frequencies (0 – 1Hz and 1 – 3 Hz), 

were plotted over time. Normality and homoscedasticity were tested using the Software Package 

SigmaStat for Windows, version 3.5. Original behavioural MFB data were arcsin transformed and 

the overall effect of contaminated sediments on population behaviour was investigated using a 

Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA on ranks (p&lt;0.001), followed by a post hoc Dunn’s test (p&lt;0.05) 

to check for significant differences (Zar, 1996).

In this study metals, metalloid (As) and sulphur pollution in an abandoned cupric pyrite 

ore mining area was investigated (“metals” will be used therefore to refer to metals and 

metalloid). To study the role of sediment toxicity in a mining area several sediments collected at 

the mine were analysed and tested. The results of the sediments characterization analysis are

TOC values in sediments were very low, ranging from&amp;lt;0.30% to 1.70%. Mine 

sediments presented values of pH that ranged from 2.72 (sed-B) to 3.73 (sed-E). Sample 

collection was performed in June, during a long dry period (several months), which can explain 

the very low pH values found in the sediments. Temperature ranged from 19.1ºC (sed-A) to 



 96 

29.1ºC (reference sediment). Although great differences were found in temperature values, it is 

most likely that these differences are due to the time of the sediment collection. Even though all 

efforts were made to perform the collection as quickly as possible, the first one was collected at 

7am (sed-A) and the last one at 10:20am (sed-E). Bearing in mind that in June, in this part of 

Portugal, temperature rises very quickly, the differences observed in temperature values are 

easily explained. Reference sediment was collected at 12pm, which clearly justify the very high 

temperature registered. Dissolved oxygen ranged from 1.33 mg/l (sed-A) to 10.35 mg/l (sed-E) 

and organic matter in the sediments ranged from 2.26% in the reference sediment to 6.24% in 

sed-B. AVS lowest value was found in reference sediment (0.57 mg/kg) and sed-D presented the 

highest value (0.90 mg/kg). Organic matter ranged from 2.26% (reference sediment) to 6.24% 

(sed-B). Sediments were mainly composed of sand (Figure 4) (ranged from 76.82% for sed-E to 

85.51% for sed-C) except sed-A and B. Clay and silt (small particles) combined ranged from 

14.49% (sed-C) to 67.20% (sed-B). Conductivity (Figure 4) values ranged from 253 µS/cm 

(reference sediment) to 715 µS/cm (sed-B).

To estimate the possible environmental consequences of the metal contamination, 

metal values in the sediment were also compared to sediment quality guidelines (SQG) (Table II). 

SQG provide concentrations of metals that have no effect on the majority of sediment dwelling 

organisms (Threshold Effect Level – TEL) and concentrations that indicate polluted sediments 

and are likely to affect organisms health (Probable Effect Level – PEL). Most sediments 

presented concentrations of As above the PEL (Table III), which indicate that those sediments, 

based on their metal content, should have been toxic. Sediments A and B had the most metals 

exciding PEL and only the reference site had no metal exceeding PEL, but As exceeded TEL. 

Cadmium did not exceeded TEL in any of the sediments, values were all below the detection 

limit. Knowing the nature of this mine, low values of cadmium were in fact expected.  Comparing 

contaminated sediments and based on metal concentrations, sed-B is the most contaminated and 

sed-C is the least contaminated. In general, samples collected in place B had the highest 

concentration of all elements. Moving away from this area, the metal concentrations decreased 

progressively, reaching the lowest values in sed-C.

analyzed do not have sediment criterion) (Buchman, 1999) (TEL = Threshold Effect Level; PEL =

Toxicological tests 

Reference sediment proved to be excellent control sediment with 100% survival. For 

contaminated sediments, mortalities (Table IV) ranged from 100% (sed-A and B) to 32.6% (sed-

D). Correlations were calculated between mortality and total metal in the sediment, TOC, AVS 

and silt+clay (Table V). The strongest correlation was found between mortality and total metal in 

sediments (r=0.707), meaning that mortality increases when concentration of metals in sediment 

is higher. Furthermore, a strong correlation was found between mortality and silt+clay (r=0.632), 

indicating that sediments with a higher percentage of fine grains are more toxic. Moderate 

association was found between mortality and TOC (positive association) and mortality and AVS 

(negative association). The influence of Fe was evaluated by correlating and Fe/MT (the ratio of 

Fe to total metal) with L. variegatus mortality (Table V). Correlation was r=-0.858, indicating a 

strong linear negative association, which means that sediments with a high proportion of Fe were 

less toxic.

After exposure to contaminated sediments, it was clear that the growth of the worms 

was inhibited (Figure 5). All the tested sediments clearly inhibited the worms’ growth and worms 

exposed to sed-E were the ones that grew less. Correlations were calculated between growth 

and total metal in the sediment, AVS, Fe/MT and silt+clay (not with TOC because data were 

bellow detection level) (Table V). Correlations were made for sediments C, D and E, since 



 100 

organisms exposed to sed-A and B did not survive until the end of the experiment. The strongest 

correlation was between growth and AVS (r=0.811), meaning that growth increases when AVS 

levels are higher. Negative correlations were found between growth and silt+clay (r=-0.661) and 

growth and Fe/MT (r=-0.500), which means that worms grow more in sediments with less 

silt+clay percentage and with sediments with more Fe (or lower Fe/MT ratio).

Concentrations of metals in the whole-body (Table VI) are only available for seds C, D 

and E, since after 10 days no worm survived the exposure to sed-A and B. Metals levels in 

whole-body were very high for worms exposed to sed-C and Fe and S were the elements with 

higher concentrations (as they were the most abundant in those sediments). Correlation between 

metals in the sediment and metals in the whole body presented a weak association (r=-0.038). 

BAF’s (Table VII) values presented huge variations. Highest and lowest BAF values were found 

for sed-C, for S and Mn, respectively. The highest BAFs generally occurred at the relatively clean 

sites (sed-C), which often contained low concentrations of elements in sediment. This seems to 

indicate that the potential for bioaccumulation was greatest at that site.

Behavioural signals (Figure 6) showed that both locomotion and peristaltic movements 

were affected by the exposure to contaminated sediments and activities decreased with the 

increasing of the total metal concentration: activities were lower for sed-D and sed-E. Although 

both behaviours were affected, after day 10 it was clear that locomotion was much more inhibited 

than peristaltic movements, which means that although worms present some activity, their 

locomotion was strongly reduced. Locomotion has been found to be a consistently sensitive 

measure of toxic stress for a wide range of environmental contamination (Little and Finger, 1990). 

No locomotion signals were observed since day 4 for worms exposed to sed-D. Variances were 

not homogeneously distributed but the results of the one-way ANOVA on ranks indicated in 

general a significant sediment effect (p&lt;0.05), for both locomotion and peristaltic movements.

Discussion 

In this investigation analysed the metal distribution in sediments collected at São 

Domingos Mine (Portugal). As the study mine is a cupric pyrite one, with ores of pyrite, 

chalcopyrite, shalerite and galena (MINEO, 2003), high values of Fe, S, Cu, Zn and Pb in the 

collected sediments were expected. Sediments were characterized in terms of TOC, AVS, grain 

size and metal content to investigate if these parameters contribute to the toxicity of sediments 

from São Domingos Mine. The low TOC levels, ranged from&amp;lt;0.30% to 1.70%, may indicate the 

absence of potentially harmful organic chemicals. TOC is added to sediments primarily through 

the decomposition of plant and animal matter and can directly adsorb metals from solutions 

applied to sediments (Liber et al., 1996). However, it can also contain metals accumulated by 

plants that have been exposed to contaminated sediment during their lifetimes (Peltier et al., 

2003). Nonetheless, high percentages of organic matter and/or small grains in sediment are 

generally associated with reduced metal bioavailability and toxicity (Ankley et al., 1996). Organic 

matter presented low values in all collected sediments probably due to the high temperature, 

which causes high degradation of organic matter. 

Cation exchange capacity is based on the surface area of sediment grain particle 

available for binding cations, such as hydrogen and free metal ions. Sediments with a high 

percentage of small grains, such as silt and clay, have high surface-to-volume ratios and can 

absorb more metals than sediments composed of large grains, such as sand (Bentivegna et al., 

2004). Sand (levels above 32.8%) dominated, generally the grain size of sediments collected at 

São Domingos Mine and sediments with lower percentage of sand (sed-A and B) presented 

higher concentrations of metals.  Using conductivity as a tool to classify according to grain size 

distribution it is known that higher electric conductivity is representative of fine-grained sediments, 

such as silt or clay, whilst sand is characterized by distinctly lower electric conductivity (Segura et 

al, 2006). This was observed for sediments collected at the Mine where sediments A and B, the 

ones with higher % of silt and clay presented the highest conductivity values, whilst sediments 

with high % of sand (C, D and E) registered lower conductivity values. 



 104 

Results showed poor sediment quality in most of the collected sediments, which was 

supported by some visual observations: there were no resident organisms in the collection areas, 

only an occasional specimen was found in sed-E (highest pH and the most distant from the mine 

effluent). Previous studies showed that Cu, Zn, Fe, S and As were the major contaminants in the 

São Domingos Mine (Gerhardt et al., 2004; Pereira et al., 2004). All the sediments collected 

presented at least one metal above the PEL, which indicate contamination. Most metal 

concentrations were several orders of magnitude above threshold values reported for sediment, 

indicating the presence of severe pollution. 

Fe and Mn are major metal components of both soil and sediment and can exist as 

dissolved ions or various precipitates, such as oxyhydroxides (oxides) and sulfides. Both Fe and 

Mn oxides can remove other metals from solution, thus making them less bioavailable (Fan and 

Wang, 2001). Our reference sediment showed high values of both Fe and Mn but was not toxic 

sediment, due to the presence of these metals that made other elements less available. Fe 

chemistry of sediments is known to control metal bioavailability. Research has shown that Fe 

oxide precipitates can adsorb metals (Dong et al., 2000). For the sediments collected at São 

Domingos, once Fe levels increased relative to the total of other metals (Fe/MT), toxicity was 

reduced.  

As a consequence of metal pollution in aquatic systems, macroinvertebrates 

accumulate metals in concentrations that depend on those in the environment (Hare et al., 1991). 

These accumulated concentrations could be used as an indirect tool to determine the degree of 

environment alteration (Solá et al., 2006). The accumulated metal concentrations are the result of 

the input and output of metals in the body, which are determined by different processes that may 

vary among species, depending, for example, on cuticle type, the presence of external plate gills 

(Kiffney and Clements, 2003), physiology (Hare, 1992) or the processes which control metal 

distribution in the cell (Luoma, 1989). Metal concentrations in macroinvertebrates are also directly 

related to those in the environment (Hare et al., 1991; Goodyear and McNeill, 1999) and, 

therefore, to the degree of mine pollution. Pollution due to pyrite dissolution increases 

environmental metal concentrations, as well as conductivity (as a result of the sulphates present), 



 105 

and decreases pH and alkalinity (as a result of protons) (Chapman and Kimstach, 1996; Farmer 

and Graham, 2003). Generally, these variables and metal concentrations tend to return to control 

values with the increasing distance to the source of pollution (Farmer and Graham, 2003). This 

was observed for São Domingos Mine, with the totality of metal percentage tending to approach 

control values on worms exposed to sed-E. 

Whole body metal concentrations and BAF may give information about the exposure of 

worms to metals, because worms accumulate metals when exposed to metal contaminated soil 

and sediment (Ireland and Wooton, 1976). Correlation between metals in the sediment and 

metals in the whole body were weak and BAF’s values seem to indicate that sed-C present a 

great potential for bioaccumulation. 

Analysis of the sediment chemistry provides information on the pollutants present and 

their concentrations, but does not provide information on whether these pollutants are biologically 

damaging. Laboratory bioassays are thus used to determine whether the sediment is in fact 

biologically damaging (Lee et al., 2006). When testing sediments for toxicity, researchers 

commonly use test organisms that incorporate and respond to multiple toxicity parameters and 

allow them to discriminate measurable concentrations of contaminants (Bentivegna et al, 2004). 

The bulk of the literature on the subject shows that various natural sediment components can 

interact with contaminants and limit their bioavailability and associated toxicity (Ankley et al., 

1996). L. variegatus have low sensitivity (in terms of mortality) to contaminants associated with 

sediment (Ingersoll et al, 2003). However, even with Lumbriculus low sensitivity, high mortalities 

were observed in this study, which indicates severe contamination. Our data showed that 

collected sediments did not support good L. variegatus growth. Several sediment parameters 

showed strong correlations with L. variegatus mortality and growth and this indicates that the 

parameters were influencing toxicity even though responses between some sites did not appear 

to be very different. 

These experiments showed that the behaviour of L. variegatus, in terms of locomotion 

and peristaltic movements, was significantly influenced by the exposure to sediments collected at 

São Domingos. The reduction in oligochaete movement could increase predation risk by limiting 



 106 

the ability to avoid capture. In addition, locomotor functions are integrally involved in vital worm 

behaviours such as foraging, sexual reproduction, predator avoidance, dispersal, and general 

orientation to environmental cues (Drewes, 1997). Behaviour is involved in many fundamental 

functions and the present study strongly indicates that behavioural parameters give crucial 

information that cannot be ignored. Behaviour proved to be an important parameter and it was 

possible to detect early warning signals of exposed worms, demonstrating that behavioural 

parameters may be included in risk assessment protocols. 

Although the metal values in this work are total metal concentrations and do not provide 

a direct indication of bioavailability, the high values found indicate that severe contamination 

within São Domingos Mine will probably be a limiting factor for the ecological recovery of that 

area. We recommend further studies of metals in the sediment of São Domingos Mine, as well as 

an investigation of the potential contribution of organic contaminants to sediment toxicity.

6.1 General Discussion

Toxicity tests with whole sediment and in-benthic invertebrates are viewed as potentially

new alternative approaches to existing methods. In this thesis, new behavioural online sediment

toxicity tests for L. variegatus were developed and compared to existing standard methods.

Sediments are one of the areas where environmental problems are a concern and for that reason

in this study behaviour of sediment organisms, as a toxicological test parameter, was evaluated

(although other parameters were also used).

Another major goal of this work was to improve the scientific knowledge about the use of

behavioural parameters in standard toxicity tests. The selected species and the assays developed

to assess the environmental impact of metals and pesticides on behaviour were very successful,

as shown on Chapters 3 and 4. The development of behavioural endpoints in toxicity assessment

has improved the sensitivity and versatility of toxicological studies (Little, 1990). Behavioural

responses are often effective indicators of contamination in biomonitoring programs (Diamond

et al., 1990).

Before starting the assessment of the potential use of behaviour as a test parameter, some

preliminary studies were performed. The purpose of these tests was to identify the best sediment

types for the use of L. variegatus in sediment toxicity tests, based on grain-size and included

measures of behaviour, growth and reproduction.

After the preliminary tests, two experiments were designed using two different chemicals,

with different mode of action and different behaviour in the environment: a metal (lead) and

an insecticide (imidacloprid). Metals are relatively low toxic but do not degrade and have a

tendency to accumulate in the environment and organisms (Laskowski, 2001). The insecticide

used here is known to be highly toxic but is degraded gradually after application.

The last experiment (Chapter 5) was performed with sediments collected at a polluted site:

an abandoned cupric pyrite mine. Sa?o Domingos mine (southern Portugal) (Figure 6.1) contains

sediments that are severely contaminated with metals (MINEO, 2003) but the extension of such

contamination has not been investigated. The chosen study area was situated at the confluence

of the Mosteira?o stream with the mine effluent, representing an area with a natural pH and

metal concentration gradient, where five sediments with different pH and associated metals were

collected and investigated.

Some major outputs can be drawn from this work, regarding several aspects under investi-

gation:

- Type of sediment and artificial cloning (Chapter 2): This study shows the role of behaviour

in assisting the design of appropriate sediment toxicity tests. Our findings will help making

114

standard tests more useful in the future and also lead to other uses of aquatic behavioral re-

sponses. Although fine sediment showed the best results for health and vitality of the study

species, ecologically relevant sediments such as whole sediments should be used on both

culture and toxicity tests. Furthermore, to achieve successful cultures, artificial cloning is

not recommended. Even though L. variegatus present an extraordinary power of regenera-

tion (Hyman, 1916), no forced cloning should be performed to obtain extra test organisms.

Worms generated by forced cloning showed a decrease in movements and less growth, which

may point to genetic impoverishment.

- Effects of exposure to metal lead (Chapter 3): If lead is available, the presence of L.

variegatus in nature will be affected since this metal interferes in the growth process. Some

adverse effects of exposure to lead were noted on behaviour and may reduce the ability of

L. variegatus to escape from predators. This would obviously lead to metal transfer from

oligochaetes to organisms occupying higher trophic levels. Behaviour as a test parameters

showed great potential and provided important data.

- Effects of exposure to pesticide imidacloprid (Chapter 4): Oligochaetes feed on subsurface

sediments and egest onto the sediment surface hence recycling deposited material. In high

worm densities, reworking can considerably modify the structure of sediments (Krezoski

and Robbins, 1985; McCall and Fisher, 1980). Imidacloprid exposure affects the survival,

growth and behaviour of L. variegatus, thus also affects the balance of the ecosystem. As

it is likely that behaviour inhibition could have a severe effect on oligochaete performance

115

in the environment, this endpoint is important to evaluate the impacts of pollutants and

pesticides on sediment ecosystems.

- Differences between tested toxics (Chapters 3 and 4): the toxics used in this study represent

two completely different groups of chemicals. While metals tend to accumulate slowly

in the environment and later in the organisms without degrade, pesticides are primarily

designed to kill rapidly and then degrade (Laskowski, 2001). Substantial differences in

the action of the two tested toxics (lead and imidacloprid) were observed. Exposure to

sediments contaminated with lead showed acceptable rates of survival (low mortality),

meaning that the metal can accumulate in the organism and metal transfer can occur to

the next generations and organisms from higher trophic levels. The pesticide caused high

mortality at the beginning of the experiment, however some organisms were able to live for

as long as in the control. Higher concentrations of imidacloprid decreased growth rate and

activity. Similar results were observed by Laskowski (2001) while comparing the effects of

a metal (cadmium) to a pesticide (imidacloprid).

- Sediment toxicity in a cupric pyrite mine (Chapter 5): The abandoned Sa?o Domingos mine

is a potentially good site for ecotoxicological studies, due to a pH and metal gradient of acid

mine drainage. Metal polluted sites represent a potentially hazardous risk for human health

and the environment (Martine?z-Sa?nchez et al., 2007). Abandoned mines can be responsible

for several impacts in their surrounding environment due to the chemical nature of their

effluents (Boult et al., 1994). L. variegatus have low sensitivity (in terms of mortality)

to contaminants associated with sediment (Ingersoll et al., 2003). However, even with

this species low sensitivity, high mortalities were observed, which indicates very strong

contamination. The highly metal concentrations found indicate that severe contamination

within Sa?o Domingos Mine will probably be a limiting factor for the ecological recovery

of that area. Several sediment parameters showed strong correlations between mortality

and growth, which indicates that those parameters were influencing toxicity even though

responses between some sites did not appear to be very different. The behaviour of L.

variegatus was significantly reduced when worms were exposed to sediments collected at

the Sa?o Domingos Mine, which may lead to a decrease in the ability to avoid capture and

thus increase the predation risk.

- Importance of laboratorial tests with field collected sediments (Chapter 5): Sediment toxic-

ity testing on field collected whole sediments and laboratory dosed sediments is an essential

line-of-evidence that the contaminants in sediment can produce the effects that are observed

in benthic communities (Burton and Landrum, 2003). These studies represent more real-

116

istic approaches and are a fundamental “calibration” for the previous experiments. One

of the major challenges in assessing the ecological risk associated with exposure to field-

contaminated sediments is the presence of chemical mixtures. Field-collected sediments,

as a rule, contain complex mixtures of chemicals and other factors that influence toxic

response (US EPA, 2005) and our study site was not an exception. Sediments collected at

the mine presented at least six different metals, one metalloid and sulphur pollution.

6.2 Final Remarks

The main purpose of this study was to develop new sediment toxicity tests using behaviour

of L. variegatus as one of the tested parameters. Since alterations of behaviour can be linked to

effects at the ecosystem levels, behaviour represents a promising tool in ecotoxicological studies

(Doving, 1992; Little, 1990; Scherrer, 1992).

It is likely that behaviour inhibition could have a severe effect on oligochaete performance

in the environment, increasing predation risk by limiting the ability to avoid capture. In ad-

dition, locomotor functions are integrally involved in vital worm behaviours such as foraging,

sexual reproduction, predator avoidance, dispersal, and general orientation to environmental

cues (Drewes, 1997). Therefore, behaviour is important to evaluate the impacts of pollutants on

sediment ecosystems. When used as hazard assessment tools, behavioural assays reflect sublethal

toxicity and often give a highly sensitive estimate of no-effect concentrations (Little and Finger,

1990; Goodrich and Lech, 1990; Strickler-Shaw and Taylor, 1990).

Although behaviour cannot replace standard toxicity endpoints, we suggest that it should

be introduced as an additional parameter. It is a fast endpoint (faster than mortality and

growth) thus important in early warning systems and results can be obtained at ecological rele-

vant concentrations (lower that lethal concentrations), which not always happen with mortality

and growth. Behaviour integrates many cellular processes as is essential to the viability of the

organism, population and community. Therefore, observations of behaviour provide a unique

toxicological perspective: one that links the biochemical and ecological consequences of envi-

ronmental contamination (Little, 1990). Because behaviour is important in activities such as

predator avoidance, sexual interactions and feeding, an impact on behaviour leads to an impact

on population dynamics. One major advantage of the use of behavioural parameters is that

responses based on behaviour are optimal for cost-effective and ecologically relevant toxicity

evaluations and very adequate for biological early warning studies.

Detecting early warning signals of exposed worms was possible on this investigation, demon-

strating that behavioural parameters may be included in risk assessment protocols. Behaviour

proved to be an important parameter, and in the future different ways of measure or assess

behavioural parameters should be tested and explored.

Further studies regarding the presence and availability of metals in the sediments of Sa?o

Domingos Mine should be performed, as well as an investigation of the potential contribution

of organic contaminants to sediment toxicity. Our results indicate severe contamination and the

high values found point to acute contamination within Sa?o Domingos Mine, which will probably

be a limiting factor for the ecological recovery of that area. Because some small livestock is

exposed to metals by grazing in the mine area and since transfer of contaminants to humans

may occur through meat and milk, a Human Health Risk Assessment should also be made.
