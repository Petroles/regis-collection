INTRODUCTION

Respiratory infections are significant 
causes of death in goats and result a variety 
of factors, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, 
parasites, environmental conditions, farming, 
and host characteristics (MAHU et al., 2015 
PONNUSAMY et al., 2017). Bacteria are the main 
infectious agents in goats with respiratory disease. 
M. haemolytica is an opportunistic bacterium that 
causes pleuropneumonia in ruminants, mainly 
cattle, and although, goats are less susceptible they 

are also vulnerable in stressful conditions such as 
transportation (RAHAL et al., 2014; PONNUSAMY 
et al., 2017; SINGH et al., 2011).

M. haemolytica pleuropneumonia can 
affect goats of all ages (RAHAL et al., 2014; 
EKONG et al., 2015). The disease can cause high 
economic losses due to treatment costs, slowdown 
in weight gain, condemnation of carcasses, and a 
decrease of meat and milk production (EMIKPE et 
al., 2010; PONNUSAMY et al., 2017). Diagnosis is 
based on clinical history, clinical signs, gross and 
histopathological findings, associated with bacteria

ABSTRACT: This study described the epidemiological, clinical, pathological and bacteriological aspects of Mannheimia haemolytica 
pleuropneumonia in goats associated with shipping stress. Forty goats transported from the Northeast to the Southern region of Brazil died 
during shipment, or 2-3 days after unloading. Clinical signs included dyspnea, mucopurulent nasal discharge, and coughing. All goats were 
necropsied, and multiple tissues were collected for histopathological analysis and involved agent identifications. All lungs showed pulmonary 
consolidation, predominantly affecting the cranioventral lobes, in addition to the marked fibrinous pleuritis, pleural thickening, and pleural 
adhesions, that affected 90% of the goats. Histologically, there was fibrino-suppurative pleuropneumonia characterized by a diffuse neutrophilic 
infiltrate admixed with fibrin. Non-hemolytic [85% (34/40)] and hemolytic [15% (6/40)] species were obtained in bacteriological culture. Fir 
Mannheimia spp. was reported in 26 isolates and subsequently confirmed as M. haemolytica (99% identity), after amplification and partial 
sequencing of the 16S rDNA gene. Stress may trigger the development of bacterial pleuropneumonia in goats, and non-hemolytic strains of M. 
haemolytica may cause this condition in goats with severe immunosuppression.
Key words: goat diseases, respiratory diseases, pathology, PCR.

RESUMO: Descreve-se os aspectos epidemiológicos, clínicos, patológicos e bacteriológicos da pleuropneumonia por Mannheimia haemolytica 
em caprinos, após transporte prolongado. Quarenta caprinos transportados da região Nordeste para a região Sul do Brasil morreram durante 
a viagem ou 2-3 dias após o desembarque. Clinicamente, observou-se dispneia, secreção nasal mucopurulenta e tosse. Na necropsia foram 
coletados múltiplos fragmentos de órgãos para análises histopatológicas e identificação do agente envolvido. Todos os pulmões apresentaram 
consolidação pulmonar predominantemente em região cranioventral, associada à deposição acentuada de fibrina, espessamento e aderência 
pleurais em 90% dos casos. Histologicamente, havia pleuropneumonia fibrinossupurativa caracterizada por infiltrado neutrofílico difuso 
associado à fibrina. Colônias não hemolíticas [85% (34/40)] e hemolíticas [15% (6/40)] foram obtidas pelo isolamento bacteriológico. 
Mannheimia spp. foi isolada em 26 amostras, os quais posteriormente foram confirmados como Mannheimia haemolytica (99% de identidade), 
pela amplificação e sequenciamento parcial do gene 16S rDNA. O estresse pode favorecer o desenvolvimento de pleuropneumonia bacteriana 
em caprinos, e cepas não hemolíticas de M. haemolytica podem causar doença em animais com imunodepressão acentuada.

isolation, and confirmation by molecular techniques 
(AHMED et al., 2017; EKONG et al., 2015; 
PONNUSAMY et al., 2017; RICE et al., 2008).

Treatment consists of antimicrobial drugs 
such as ampicillin, penicillin, ceftiofur, ceftriaxone, 
and enrofloxacin (RAHAL et al., 2014). However, 
prevention strategies are more effective and include 
the improvement of housing conditions, sanitary 
management, and biosecurity practices. Avoiding 
stressful factors, such as the assembly of animals 
from different origins without proper quarantine is 
also effective (SILVA et al., 2012; ZECCHINON et 
al., 2005). Additionally, administration of minerals, 
vitamins, food, and water of high quality, can aid in 
prevention (EMIKPE et al., 2010). Many farmers do 
not understand the effects of poor transport conditions, 
which often lead to a reduction in immunity and 
colonization of the lung by opportunistic agents. 
This report described the epidemiological, clinical, 
pathological, and bacteriological findings of 40 M. 
haemolytica pleuropneumonia cases associated with 
stress due to shipment.

MATERIALS   AND   METHODS

Epidemiology, clinical signs, pathology, and 
bacteriology

Over a 1.5-year time span (June 2016 to 
December 2017), eight trucks transported hundreds 
of goats along similar routes from the Northeast 
Brazil to Porto Alegre. These goats were housed in 
two farms located in the municipality of Porto Alegre 
(Parallel 30º between 29º10’30’’ South and Meridian 
50º between 51º05’00’’ West), where 40 goats died 
and were sent for necropsy. At necropsy, fragments 
of various organs were collected and fixed in 10% 
neutral buffered formalin. Samples were routinely 
processed and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin 
(HE) for histopathological analysis. Samples of 
lungs were also collected for bacteriological culture. 
Data on the outbreak was obtained through field-
work on the farms.

Samples were processed and cultivated 
under aerobic and microaerobic conditions in 
5% sheep blood agar and MacConkey agar, and 
incubated for 72h at 37°C. The isolated bacterial 
colonies were identified by their cultural, 
morphologic and biochemical characteristics 
according to MARKEY et al. (2013).

Molecular identification
Twenty-six bacterial isolates were submitted to 

polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to identification. 

Bacterial cells were harvested from blood agar and total 
bacterial DNA was extracted using QIAmp DNA Kit 
(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
The PCR assay was projected for the amplification of 
a 499bp fragment of Mannheimia spp. 16S rRNA gene 
(forward primer: 5’-TCACCAAGCCGTCGATCTCT-3’, 
reverse primer: 5’-TTCGCACATGAGCGTCAGTAC-3). 
PCRmix included 1U Taq Platinum (Invitrogen), 10X 
of buffer Taq, 15pmol of each primer, 200nM of each 
deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP), 1.5mM MgCl2 and 
20ng of the total DNA in a final volume of 25?L. The PCR 
conditions were: 95°C for 5min followed by 35 cycles of 
95°C for 30 seconds (s), 59°C for 45s and 72°C for 30s, 
and a final cycle of 72°C for 10min. The Mannheimia 
specie determination was performed amplifying the whole 
16S rRNA ribosomal sequence (1,450bp) following by 
sequencing and analysis according previously described 
by SIQUEIRA et al. (2018). The generated sequence was 
deposited in the GenBank (accession number MK106144). 
Multiple alignment were performed with Mannheimia 
related species 16S rDNA sequences, available from 
GenBank (NCBI) database, in ClustalW alignment, and 
a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the genetic 
distance model of Tamura-Nei by UPGMA method with 
1,000 replicates, including Escherichia coli as outgroup, in 
the Genious Tree Builder (Geneious version 9.1).

RESULTS

In eight shipments of goats conducted 
from June 2016 to December 2017 from Northeast 
Brazil to Porto Alegre in closed trucks with poor 
ventilation and hygiene, 40 6–month-old to 4-year-
old goats (28 males and 12 females) died due to 
pleuropneumonia. All goats were densely crowded 
together, irrespective of their origin, age, sex or 
health condition. The mortality levels varied in 
each transport, and included other causes, such as 
haemonchosis, cetosis, E. coli, Salmonella spp. and 
Eimeria spp. enteritis. Each truck carried 300-700 
goats and traveled a distance of 3,769km over for 
approximately 5 days. According to the owners, 
goats were not allowed to leave the truck during the 
shipment, and water was not available. On arrival, 
some goats were dead, and others showed symptoms 
including poor body condition, apathy, anorexia, 
dyspnea, bilateral mucopurulent nasal discharge 
(Figure 1A), and died within 3-5 days.

At  necropsy, goats had a regular to poor 
body condition, were dehydrated, and showed 
mucopurulent nasal discharge. Consistent findings 
included non-collapsing lungs with varying degrees 
of right cranioventral consolidation (Table 1). These

consolidation areas were dark-red and firm, and 
frequently covered by fibrin (Figure 1B and 1C), in 
addition to a pinkish foam in the trachea and large 
bronchi. In 90% (36/40) of the cases, adhesions of the 
visceral to parietal pleura were observed. Gelatinous 
pleural effusion occurred in 37.5% (15/40) of the 
necropsied goats. Twenty percent (8/40) of the goats 
had large numbers of nematodes (Haemonchus 
contortus) in the abomasal lumen.

Histologically, all goats had a 
fibrinosuppurative pleuropneumonia, characterized 
by a marked focally extensive inflammatory infiltrate 
in the pleura, alveoli, bronchi, and bronchioles. 

Exudate consisted mainly of intact and degenerate 
neutrophils occasionally with deformed elongated 
nuclei (“oat cells”) associated with marked necrosis 
of the respiratory epithelium and fibrin deposition 
(Figure 1D). Additionally few lymphocytes, plasma 
cells, or macrophages were observed within the 
cellular infiltrate. The visceral pleura was markedly 
thickened by a layer of fibrin associated with 
neutrophils (Figure 1E). Marked intra-alveolar and 
interlobular edema of the pulmonary septa was 
observed in all cases.

In all samples cultured in blood agar, pure 
cultures of the genus Mannheimia were isolated, of

which 85% (34/40) were non-hemolytic and 15% 
(6/40) were hemolytic phenotype. The isolates 
were positive for esculin-hydrolysis, negative for 
ONPG beta-galactosidase and unable to grow on 
MacConkey’s agar.

The PCR assay was positive for 
Mannheimia spp. in all isolates, as identified 
by the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Subsequently, 
M. haemolytica was confirmed by complete 
sequencing of the 16S rDNA gene with 99% 
identity in all analyzed isolates. Furthermore, the 
phylogenetic analysis (Figure 2) confirmed the 
bacteria as M. haemolytica, by the clusterization 
of the N706/16 others M. haemolytica strains with 
high confidence. 

DISCUSSION

The diagnosis of pleuropneumonia 
in the goats of the current report was based on 
epidemiological, pathological, bacteriological, 
and molecular findings. The shipment of goats is 
a common farm practice (SINGH et al., 2011). 
However, transportation of live animals between 
distant regions without animal welfare consideration 
may result in high mortality. Deaths are most often 
caused by respiratory disease, a condition known 
as “shipping fever” (VIANA et al., 2007; ROSA 
et al., 2013). Aggravating adverse conditions in 
transportation were evident in our study. The 
goats were transported between two distant and 
markedly different regions (the Northeast and the 
Southern Brazilian regions are climatically distinct, 
especially, regarding temperature and humidity). 
Transportation vehicles had a closed environment 
with poor air quality and densely crowded animals. 
Pneumonia caused by stress due to transportation has 
been described in shipping fever in cattle (ROSA et 
al., 2013), sheep, and goats (AHMED et al., 2017; 
EKONG et al., 2015; RICE et al., 2008). 

Gross and microscopic lesions observed 
in all goats examined in the present study are similar 
to those described for shipping fever (WILD &amp;amp; 
MILLER, 1991; MAHU et al., 2015; ZECCHINON 
et al., 2005). Aggravating stress factors related to 
transportation most likely affected the development 
and severity of the disease observed in the goats 
of this report; stress factors such as commingling 
animals from different origins, transmission of the 
agent among animals, and the maintenance of the 
infection due to the high humidity, resulted in high 
morbidity during transport (PONNUSAMY et al., 
2017; SINGH et al., 2011). It is likely that the clinical 
signs were aggravated by the lack of food, and 
water, the long duration of the shipment, parasitism 
by bloodsucking nematodes and poor management 
practices (EKONG et al., 2015; ZECCHINON et al., 
2005). It is suggested that all these adverse conditions 
cause changes in the respiratory microenvironment 
resulting in upper airway irritation and reduction of 
mucociliary clearance, reduction in innate immunity, 
and consequently, adhesion and colonization of the 
lungs by pathogenic bacteria (RAHAL et al., 2014; 
VIANA et al., 2007). 

M. haemolytica is characterized by 
hemolysis in blood agar, growth on MacConkey’s 
agar and biochemical positivity and negativity for 
beta-galactosidase and esculin hydrolysis tests, 
respectively (MARKEY et al., 2013). However, 
atypical phenotypic characteristics were reported 
in 85% of the isolates of our cases; although, M. 
haemolytica was identified in all samples through 
the molecular analysis. Using phylogenetic 
analysis we were able to infer that the isolates 
are M. haemolytica, since other closely related 
Mannheimia species did not align to our isolates in 
the phylogenetical analysis. 

M. haemolytica with deletion of the 
hemolysin gene was previously reported in association 
with pleuropneumonia and septicemia in a bovine 
calf (MAHU et al., 2015) and in nasopharyngeal 
biopsy of healthy sheep (WILD &amp;amp; MILLER, 1991). 
Non-typical characteristics of the isolates obtained in 
the present study included no growth in MacConkey 
agar, as well as beta-hemolytic negative colonies and 
positive beta-galactosidase ONPG, which is atypical 
for M. haemolytica. It is likely that the immuno 
compromised goats became more vulnerable to 
changes from commensal non-hemolytic bacteria to 
opportunistic pathogens (YENER et al., 2009). 

Several factors may interfere in the 
phenotypic variation of microorganisms, such 
as environmental factors (RAHAL et al., 2014), 
enzymatic inhibition by drugs, serotype particularities

(RICE et al., 2008) and handling of samples (YENER 
et al., 2009). Other authors have also obtained non-
hemolytic M. haemolytica isolates and confirmed 
them using molecular methods (YENER et al., 2009; 
MAHU et al., 2015). High sensitivity and specificity 
of the test were observed in hemolytic as well as 
non-hemolytic isolates, which makes the molecular 
test indispensable and recommended for definitive 
diagnosis of M. haemolytica pneumonia (RAHAL et 
al., 2014; AHMED et al., 2017). 

In conclusion, stressful factors may favor 
the development of bacterial pleuropneumonia in 
goats of all ages, and non-hemolytic M. haemolytica 
colonies can also generate the disease in goats under 
inadequate welfare conditions.
