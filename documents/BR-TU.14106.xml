Abstract 

 

The current socio-economic developments and lifestyle trends indicate an increasing 

consumption of technological products and processes, powered by emergent concepts, such as 

Internet of Things (IoT) and smart environments, where everything is connected in a single 

network. For this reason, wearable technology has been addressed to make the person, mainly 

through his clothes, able to communicate with and be part of this technological network. 

Wireless communication systems are made up of several electronic components, which over 

the years have been miniaturized and made more flexible, such as batteries, sensors, actuators, 

data processing units, interconnectors and antennas. Turning these systems into wearable 

systems is a demanding research subject. Specifically, the development of wearable antennas 

has been challenging, because they are conventionally built on rigid substrates, hindering their 

integration into the garment. That is why, considering the flexibility and the dielectric 

properties of textile materials, making antennas in textile materials will allow expanding the 

interaction of the user with some electronic devices, by interacting through the clothes. The 

electronic devices may thus become less invasive and more discrete.  

Textile antennas combine the traditional textile materials with new technologies. They emerge 

as a potential interface of the human-technology-environment relationship. They are becoming 

an active part in the wireless communication systems, aiming applications such as tracking and 

navigation, mobile computing, health monitoring and others. Moreover, wearable antennas 

have to be thin, lightweight, of easy maintenance, robust, and of low cost for mass production 

and commercialization.  

In this way, planar antennas, the microstrip patch type, have been proposed for garment 

applications, because this type of antenna presents all these characteristics, and are also 

adaptable to any surface. Such antennas are usually formed by assembling conductive (patch 

and ground plane) and dielectric (substrate) layers. Furthermore, the microstrip patch 

antennas, radiate perpendicularly to a ground plane, which shields the antenna radiation, 

ensuring that the human body is exposed only to a very small fraction of the radiation. 

To develop this type of antenna, the knowledge of the properties of textile materials is crucial 

as well as the knowledge of the manufacturing techniques for connecting the layers with glue, 

seam, adhesive sheets and others. Several properties of the materials influence the behaviour 

of the antenna. For instance, the bandwidth and the efficiency of a planar antenna are mainly 

determined by the permittivity and the thickness of the substrate. The use of textiles in 

wearable antennas requires thus the characterization of their properties. Specific electrical 

conductive textiles are available on the market and have been successfully used. Ordinary 

textile fabrics have been used as substrates. 



 VIII 

In general, textiles present a very low dielectric constant, ?r, that reduces the surface wave 

losses and increases the impedance bandwidth of the antenna. However, textile materials are 

constantly exchanging water molecules with the surroundings, which affects their 

electromagnetic properties. In addition, textile fabrics are porous, anisotropic and 

compressible materials whose thickness and density might change with low pressures. 

Therefore, it is important to know how these characteristics influence the behaviour of the 

antenna in order to minimize unwanted effects.  

To explain some influences of the textile material on the performance of the wearable 

antennas, this PhD Thesis starts presenting a survey of the key points for the design and 

development of textile antennas, from the choice of the textile materials to the framing of the 

antenna. An analysis of the textile materials that have been used is also presented. Further, 

manufacturing techniques of the textile antennas are described.?	

The accurate characterization of textile materials to use as a dielectric substrate in wearable 

systems is fundamental. However, little information can be found on the electromagnetic 

properties of the regular textiles. Woven, knits and nonwovens are inhomogeneous, highly 

porous, compressible and easily influenced by the environmental hygrometric conditions, 

making their electromagnetic characterization difficult. Despite there are no standard 

methods, several authors have been adapting techniques for the dielectric characterization of 

textiles. This PhD Thesis focuses on the dielectric characterization of the textile materials, 

surveying the resonant and non-resonant methods that have been proposed to characterize the 

textile and leather materials. Also, this PhD Thesis summarizes the characterization of textile 

materials made through these methods, which were validated by testing antennas that 

performed well.  	

Further a Resonant-Based Experimental Technique is presented. This new method is based on 

the theory of resonance-perturbation, extracting the permittivity and loss tangent values based 

on the shifts caused by the introduction of a superstrate on the patch of a microstrip antenna. 

The results obtained using this method have shown that when positioning the roughest face of 

the material under test (MUT) in contact with the resonator board, the extracted dielectric 

constant value is lower than the one extracted with this face positioned upside-down. Based 

on this observation, superficial properties of textiles were investigated and their influence on 

the performance of antennas was analysed.  

Thus, this PhD Thesis relates the results of the dielectric characterization to some structural 

parameters of textiles, such as surface roughness, superficial and bulk porosities. The results 

show that both roughness and superficial porosity of the samples influence the measurements, 

through the positioning of the probes. Further, the influence of the positioning of the dielectric 

material on the performance of textile microstrip antennas was analysed. For this, twelve 

prototypes of microstrip patch antennas were developed and tested. The results show that, 

despite the differences obtained on the characterization when placing the face or reverse-sides 



 IX 

of the MUT in contact with the resonator board, the obtained average result of ?r is well suited 

to design antennas ensuring a good performance. 

According to the European Commission Report in 2009, “Internet of Things — An action plan for 

Europe”, in the next years, the IoT will be able to improve the quality of life, especially in the 

health monitoring field. In the Wireless Body Sensor Network (WBSN) context, the integration 

of textile antennas for energy harvesting into smart clothing is a particularly interesting 

solution for a continuous wirelessly feed of the devices. Indeed, in the context of wearable 

devices the replacement of batteries is not easy to practice. A specific goal of this PhD Thesis 

is thus to describe the concept of the energy harvesting and then presents a survey of textile 

antennas for RF energy harvesting. Further, a dual-band printed monopole textile antenna for 

electromagnetic energy harvesting, operating at GSM 900 and DCS 1800 bands, is also proposed. 

The antenna aims to harvest energy to feed sensor nodes of a wearable health monitoring 

system. The gains of the antenna are around 1.8 dBi and 2.06 dBi allied with a radiation 

efficiency of 82% and 77.6% for the lowest and highest frequency bands, respectively. 

To understand and improve the performance of the proposed printed monopole textile antenna, 

several manufacturing techniques are tested through preliminary tests, to identify promising 

techniques and to discard inefficient ones, such as the gluing technique. Then, the influence 

of several parameters of the manufacturing techniques on the performance of the antenna are 

analysed, such as the use of steam during lamination, the type of adhesive sheet, the 

orientation of the conductive elements and others. For this, seven prototypes of the printed 

monopole textile antenna were manufactured by laminating and embroidering techniques.  

The measurement of the electrical surface resistance, Rs, has shown that the presence of the 

adhesive sheet used on the laminating process may reduce the conductivity of the conductive 

materials. Despite that, when measuring the return loss of printed monopole antennas 

produced by lamination, the results show the antennas have a good performance. The results 

also show that the orientation of the conductive fabric does not influence the performance of 

the antennas. However, when testing embroidered antennas, the results show that the 

direction and number of the stitches in the embroidery may influence the performance of the 

antenna and should thus be considered during manufacturing.  

The textile antennas perform well and their results support and give rise to the new concept 

of a continuous substrate to improve the integration of textile antennas into clothing, in a more 

comfortable and pleasure way. A demonstrating prototype, the E-Caption: Smart and 

Sustainable Coat, is thus presented. In this prototype of smart coat, the printed antenna is fully 

integrated, as its dielectric is the textile material composing the coat itself. The E-Caption 

illustrates the innovative concept of textile antennas that can be manipulated as simple 

emblems. The results obtained testing the antenna before and after its integration into cloth, 

show that the integration does not affect the behaviour of the antenna. Even on the presence 

of the human body the antenna is able to cover the proposed resonance frequencies (GSM 900 

and DCS 1800 bands) with the radiation pattern still being omnidirectional.  



 X 

At last, the exponential growth in the wearable market boost the industrialization process of 

manufacturing textile antennas. As this research shows, the patch of the antennas can be easily 

and efficiently cut, embroidered or screen printed by industrial machines. However, the 

conception of a good industrial substrate that meets all the mechanical and electromagnetic 

requirements of textile antennas is still a challenge. Following the continuous substrate 

concept presented and demonstrated through the E-Caption, a new concept is proposed: the 

continuous Substrate Integrating the Ground Plane (SIGP). The SIGP is a novel textile material 

that integrates the dielectric substrate and the conductive ground plane in a single material, 

eliminating one laminating process. Three SIGP, that are weft knitted spacer fabrics having one 

conductive face, were developed in partnership with the Borgstena Textile Portugal Lda, 

creating synergy between research in the academy and industry. The results of testing the 

performance of the SIGP materials show that the integration of the ground plane on the 

substrate changes the dielectric constant of the material, as a consequence of varying the 

thickness. Despite this, after the accurate dielectric and electrical characterization, the SIGP 

I material has shown a good performance as dielectric substrate of a microstrip patch antenna 

for RF energy harvesting. This result is very promising for boosting the industrial fabrication of 

microstrip patch textile antennas and their mass production and dissemination into the IoT 

network, guiding future developments of smart clothing and wearables.

Resumo 

 

Os atuais desenvolvimentos socioeconómicos e tendências de estilo de vida apontam para um 

crescimento do consumo de produtos e processos tecnológicos, impulsionado por conceitos 

emergentes como a Internet das Coisas, onde tudo tudo está conectado em uma única rede. 

Por esta razão, as tecnologias usáveis (wearable) estão a afirmar-se propondo soluções que 

tornam o utilizador possivelmente através das suas roupas, capaz de comunicar com e fazer 

parte desta rede.  

Os sistemas de comunicações sem fios são constituídos por diversos componentes eletrónicos, 

que com o passar dos anos foram sendo miniaturizados e fabricados em materiais flexíveis, tais 

como as baterias, os sensores, as unidades de processamento de dados, as interconexões e as 

antenas. Tornar os sistemas de comunicações sem fios em sistemas usáveis requer trabalho de 

investigação exigente. Nomeadamente, o desenvolvimento de antenas usáveis tem sido um 

desafio, devido às antenas serem tradicionalmente desenvolvidas em substratos rígidos, que 

dificultam a sua integração no vestuário. Dessa forma, considerando a flexibilidade e as 

propriedades dielétricas dos materiais têxteis, as antenas têxteis trazem a promessa de 

permitir a interacção dos utilizadores com os dispositivos eletrónicos através da roupa, 

tornando os dispositivos menos invasivos e mais discretos.  

As antenas têxteis combinam os materiais têxteis tradicionais com novas tecnologias e emergem 

assim como uma potencial interface de fronteira entre seres humanos-tecnologias-ambientes. 

Expandindo assim a interação entre o utilizador e os dispositivos eletrónicos ao recurso do 

vestuário. Assim, através das antenas têxteis, o vestuário torna-se uma parte ativa nos sistemas 

de comunicação sem fios, visando aplicações como rastreamento e navegação, computação 

móvel, monitorização de saúde, entre outros. Para isto, as antenas para vestir devem ser finas, 

leves, de fácil manutenção, robustas e de baixo custo para produção em massa e 

comercialização. 

Desta forma, as antenas planares do tipo patch microstrip têm sido propostas para aplicações 

em vestuário, pois apresentam todas estas características e também são adaptáveis a qualquer 

superfície. Estas antenas são geralmente formadas pela sobreposição de camadas condutoras 

(elemento radiante e plano de massa) e dielétricas (substrato). Além disso, as antenas patch 

microstrip irradiam perpendicularmente ao plano de massa, que bloqueia a radiação da antena, 

garantindo que o corpo humano é exposto apenas a uma fração muito pequena da radiação. 

Para desenvolver este tipo de antena, é crucial conhecer as propriedades dos materiais têxteis, 

bem como as técnicas de fabricação para conectar as camadas, com cola, costuras, folhas 

adesivas, entre outros. Diversas propriedades dos materiais influenciam o comportamento da 

antena. Por exemplo, a permitividade e a espessura do substrato determinam a largura de 



 XII 

banda e a eficiência de uma antena planar. O uso de têxteis em antenas usáveis requer assim 

uma caracterização precisa das suas propriedades. Os têxteis condutores elétricos são materiais 

específicos que estão disponíveis comercialmente em diversas formas e têm sido utilizados com 

sucesso para fabricar o elemento radiante e o plano de massa das antenas. Para fabricar o 

substrato dielétrico têm sido utilizados materiais têxteis convencionais. 

Geralmente, os materiais têxteis apresentam uma constante dielétrica (?r) muito baixa, o que 

reduz as perdas de ondas superficiais e aumenta a largura de banda da antena. No entanto, os 

materiais têxteis estão constantemente a trocar moléculas de água com o ambiente em que 

estão inseridos, o que afeta as suas propriedades eletromagnéticas. Além disso, os tecidos e os 

outros materiais têxteis planares são materiais porosos, anisotrópicos e compressíveis, cuja 

espessura e densidade variam sob muito baixas pressões. Portanto, é importante saber como 

estas grandezas e características estruturais influenciam o comportamento da antena, de forma 

a minimizar os efeitos indesejáveis. 

Para explicar algumas das influências do material têxtil no desempenho das antenas usáveis, 

esta Tese de Doutoramento começa por fazer o estado da arte sobre os pontos-chave para o 

desenvolvimento de antenas têxteis, desde a escolha dos materiais têxteis até ao processo de 

fabrico da antena. Além disso, a tese identifica e apresenta uma análise dos materiais têxteis 

e técnicas de fabricação que têm sido utilizados e referidos na literatura. 

A caracterização rigorosa dos materiais têxteis para usar como substrato dielétrico em sistemas 

usáveis é fundamental. No entanto, pouca informação existe sobre a caracterização das 

propriedades eletromagnéticas dos têxteis vulgares. Como já referido, os tecidos, malhas e 

não-tecidos são materiais heterogéneos, altamente porosos, compressíveis e facilmente 

influenciados pelas condições higrométricas ambientais, dificultando a sua caracterização 

eletromagnética. Não havendo nenhum método padrão, vários autores têm vindo a adaptar 

algumas técnicas para a caracterização dielétrica dos materiais têxteis. Esta Tese de 

Doutoramento foca a caracterização dielétrica dos materiais têxteis, revendo os métodos 

ressonantes e não ressonantes que foram propostos para caracterizar os materiais têxteis e o 

couro. Além disso, esta Tese de Doutoramento resume a caracterização de dieléctricos têxteis 

feita através dos métodos revistos e que foi validada testando antenas que apresentaram um 

bom desempenho. 

No seguimento da revisão, apresenta-se uma Técnica Experimental Baseada em Ressonância. 

Esta nova técnica baseia-se na teoria da perturbação de ressonância, sendo a permitividade e 

tangente de perda extraídas com base nas mudanças de frequência causadas pela introdução 

de um superstrato no elemento radiante de uma antena patch microstrip. Os resultados de 

caracterização obtidos através deste método revelam que, ao posicionar a face mais rugosa do 

material em teste em contato com a placa de ressonância, o valor da constante dielétrica 

extraída é inferior ao valor extraído quando esta face é colocada ao contrário. Com base nesta 

observação, as propriedades estruturais da superfície dos materiais têxteis foram investigadas 

e a sua influência no desempenho das antenas foi analisada. 



 XIII 

Assim, esta Tese de Doutoramento relaciona os resultados da caracterização dielétrica com 

alguns parâmetros estruturais dos materiais, como rugosidade da superfície, porosidades 

superficial e total. Os resultados mostram que tanto a rugosidade como a porosidade superficial 

das amostras influenciam os resultados, que dependem assim do posicionamento do material 

que está a ser testado. Também foi analisada a influência do posicionamento do material 

dielétrico na performance das antenas têxteis tipo patch microstrip. Para isso, foram 

desenvolvidos e testados doze protótipos de antenas patch microstrip. Os resultados mostram 

que, apesar das diferenças observadas durante o processo de caracterização, o valor médio da 

permitividade é adequado para a modelação das antenas, garantindo um bom desempenho. 

De acordo com o relatório da Comissão Europeia, “Internet das Coisas - Um plano de ação para 

a Europa”, emitido em 2009, nos próximos anos a Internet das Coisas poderá melhorar a 

qualidade de vida das pessoas, nomeadamente pela monitorização da saúde. No contexto das 

Redes de Sensores Sem Fios do Corpo Humano, a integração de antenas têxteis para recolha de 

energia em roupas inteligentes é uma solução particularmente interessante, pois permite uma 

alimentação sem fios e contínua dos dispositivos. De fato, nos dispositivos usáveis a substituição 

de baterias não é fácil de praticar. Um dos objetivos específicos desta Tese de Doutoramento 

é, portanto, descrever o conceito de recolha de energia e apresentar o estado da arte sobre 

antenas têxteis para recolha de energia proveniente da Rádio Frequência (RF). Nesta tese, é 

também proposta uma antena impressa do tipo monopolo de dupla banda, fabricada em 

substrato têxtil, para recolha de energia eletromagnética, operando nas bandas GSM 900 e DCS 

1800. A antena visa recolher energia para alimentar os nós de sensores de um sistema usável 

para monitorização da saúde. Os ganhos da antena apresentada foram cerca de 1.8 dBi e 2.06 

dBi, aliados a uma eficiência de radiação de 82% e 77.6% para as faixas de frequência mais 

baixa e alta, respetivamente. 

Para entender e melhorar o desempenho da antena impressa tipo monopolo de dupla banda em 

substrato têxtil, várias técnicas de fabrico foram testadas através de testes preliminares, de 

forma a identificar as técnicas promissoras e a descartar as ineficientes, como é o caso da 

técnica de colagem. De seguida, analisou-se a influência de vários parâmetros das técnicas de 

fabrico sobre o desempenho da antena, como o uso de vapor durante a laminação, o tipo de 

folha adesiva, a orientação dos elementos irradiantes e outros. Para isto, sete protótipos da 

antena têxtil monopolar impressa foram fabricados por técnicas de laminação e bordado. 

As medições da resistência elétrica superficial, Rs, mostrou que a presença da folha adesiva 

usada no processo de laminagem pode reduzir a condutividade dos materiais condutores. Apesar 

disso, ao medir o S11 das antenas impressas tipo monopolo produzidas por laminagem, os 

resultados mostram que as antenas têm uma boa adaptação da impedância. Os resultados 

também mostram que a orientação do tecido condutor, neste caso um tafetá, não influencia o 

desempenho das antenas. No entanto, ao testar antenas bordadas, os resultados mostram que 

a direção e o número de pontos no bordado podem influenciar o desempenho da antena e, 

portanto, estas são características que devem ser consideradas durante a fabricação. 



 XIV 

De um modo geral, as antenas têxteis funcionam bem e seus resultados suportam e dão origem 

ao um novo conceito de substrato contínuo para melhorar a integração de antenas têxteis no 

vestuário, de maneira mais confortável e elegante. A tese apresenta um protótipo 

demonstrador deste conceito, o E-Caption: A Smart and Sustainable Coat. Neste protótipo de 

casaco inteligente, a antena impressa está totalmente integrada, pois o seu substrato dielétrico 

é o próprio material têxtil no qual é feito o casaco. O E-Caption ilustra um conceito inovador 

de antenas têxteis que podem ser manipuladas como simples emblemas. Os resultados obtidos 

testando a antena antes e depois da integração no casaco mostram que a integração não afeta 

o comportamento da antena. Mesmo na presença do corpo humano, a antena têxtil é capaz de 

cobrir as frequências de ressonância propostas (bandas GSM 900 e DCS 1800), e de assegurar 

um padrão de radiação omnidirecional. 

Por fim, o crescimento exponencial do mercado de dispositivos usáveis impulsiona o processo 

de industrialização do fabrico de antenas têxteis. Como mostrado ao longo desta investigação, 

os elementos radiantes das antenas podem ser cortados, bordados ou serigrafados por máquinas 

industriais de forma fácil e eficiente. No entanto, a conceção de um bom substrato industrial, 

que satisfaça todos os requisitos mecânicos e eletromagnéticos das antenas têxteis, ainda é um 

desafio. Seguindo o conceito do substrato contínuo apresentado e demonstrado através do E-

Caption, propõe-se um novo conceito: o desenvolvimento de um Substrato contínuo Integrando 

o Plano de Massa (SIGP). O SIGP é um material têxtil inovador que integra o substrato dielétrico 

e o plano de massa em um único material, eliminando assim uma das fases do processo de 

laminagem. 

Três SIGP, que são malhas 3D com uma face condutora, foram desenvolvidos em parceria com 

a Borgstena Textile Portugal Lda, criando assim uma sinergia entre academia e indústria. Os 

resultados dos testes de desempenho dos SIGP mostram que a integração do plano de massa no 

substrato dielétrico altera a constante dielétrica do material, devido à variação da espessura 

ocasionada pela integração do plano de massa. Apesar disso, após a caracterização 

eletromagnética do material, o material SIGP I mostrou um bom desempenho quando aplicado 

como substrato dielétrico de uma antena tipo patch microstrip para recolha de energia 

eletromagnética. Este resultado é muito promissor para impulsionar a fabricação industrial de 

antenas têxteis do tipo patch microstrip, e a sua produção em massa e disseminação na rede 

da Internet das Coisas, orientando futuros desenvolvimentos de tecnologias usáveis e vestuário 

inteligente1.

Introduction  

 

Nowadays, the socio-economic development and lifestyle trends indicate an 

increasing consumption of technological products and processes, powered by emergent 

concepts such as Internet of Things (IoT), where everything is connected in a single network 

[1]. According to Cisco, IoT describes a system where items in the physical world, and sensors 

within or attached to these items, are connected to the Internet via wireless and wired Internet 

connections. These sensors can use various types of local area connections such as Radio 

Frequency Identification (RFID), Near Field Communication (NFC), Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and 

Zigbee. Sensors can also have wide area connectivity such as Global System for Mobile 

Communication (GSM), Global Positioning System (GPS), 3G, and Long-Term Evolution (LTE) [2]. 

Following the European Commission Report [3], in the next years, the IoT will be able to 

improve the quality of life, especially in the health monitoring field. The development of smart 

objects for IoT applications, include the capacity of this objects to be identifiable, to 

communicate and to Interact [4]. In this context, wearable technology has been addressed to 

make the person, mainly through his clothes, able to communicate with and be part of this 

technological network. Figure 1-1 illustrated the growing of the IoT in the last decades. 

 
Figure 1-1 Growing of IoT, based on Cisco data [5]

Wireless communication systems are made up of several electronic components, which over 

the years have been miniaturized and made more flexible, such as batteries, sensors, actuators, 

data processing units, interconnectors and antennas [6]. In the systems for on-body 

applications, the antennas have been challenging, because they are conventionally built on 

rigid substrates, hindering their efficient and comfortable integration into the garment. 

However, embedding antennas into clothing allows expanding the interaction of the user with 

some electronic devices, making them less invasive and more discrete. Since 2001, when P. 

Salonen et al. [7] proposed the first prototype of flexible antenna made of fabrics, the use of 

textile materials to develop wearable antennas has increased exponentially.  

The integration of electronics into textiles has started a new era for the apparel industry. In a 

near future, wearable antennas will be part of everyday clothing, transforming the garment in 

an interface for wireless communication actions. Thus, textile antennas that are designed 

combining the traditional textile materials with new technologies emerge as a potential 

interface of the human-technology-environment relationship, aiming applications such as 

tracking and navigation, mobile computing and others. ? 

To achieve a low profile and unobtrusive integration of the antenna into the garment, antennas 

have to be thin, lightweight, robust and easy to maintain.  Moreover, they must be low cost for 

manufacturing and commercializing. In this way, planar antennas have been proposed for 

wearable applications, because this type of antenna topology combines all these 

characteristics, and is also adaptable to any surface. Such antennas are usually formed by 

assembling conductive (patch and ground plane) and dielectric (substrate) layers [8], as shown 

on Figure 1-2.  Furthermore, planar antennas, such as the microstrip patch antenna, radiate 

perpendicularly to a ground plane, which shields the antenna radiation, ensuring that the 

human body is exposed only to a very small fraction of the radiation. 

 

Figure 1-2 Layout of microstrip patch antenna (a) Front view and (b) cross section 

To develop planar textile antennas, the knowledge of the properties of textile materials is 

crucial as well as insight into the manufacturing techniques for assembling the layers, such as 

laminating with glue, seam and adhesive sheets. Fabrics are planar fibrous materials whose 

(a)

properties are mainly determined by the properties of the component fibres and the structure 

of the yarns and/or of the fabric. They are porous materials, in which the density of the fibres, 

air volume and size of the pores determine general behaviour, for instance, air permeability 

and thermal insulation. Moreover, as these features are somehow difficult to control in real 

applications of textiles, it would be very important to study how they influence the behaviour 

of the antenna in order to minimize any unwanted effects2.   

1.1 Motivation 
Besides IoT being a hot current research topic challenging textile engineers to develop novel 

materials, processes and products for wearable electronics, according to the ATP - Associação 

Têxtil e Vestuário de Portugal (in English, Textile and Garment Association of Portugal) the 

technical textiles applied to Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), are pointed 

as one of the ten macro trends for the textile market until 2020 [9]. 

Based on the ATP study [9], the growing market of technical textiles for ICT means an 

interdependence between research fields. The studies that combine intersections of science, 

technology, materials engineering, business and fashion, emerge in Europe and will lead the 

R&amp;amp;D strategies, on the next decades, following the diagram presented on Figure 1-3.

for ICT, based on [9] 

                                                   
2 In this PhD Thesis on Textile Engineering some fundamental parameters of antennas will be discussed, 
in order to relate the performance of the antennas with the applied textile materials and manufacturing 
techniques. The fundamental parameters of antennas are described on Appendix A. 



 4 

The integration of wearable technologies and wireless communications into textile materials 

and products still is in an emerging phase. The majority of the studies found in the state of the 

art of textile antennas, were made by electrical engineers, only a few works presented the 

point of view of textile engineering. For this reason, the main motivation of this work is to 

contribute for the expansion of the textile presence in IoT, through advancing on the 

integration of wearable devices and systems for IoT into textiles, covering some gaps on the 

state of the art, fully described in the following Chapters. Four main gaps have been lead to 

this study: 

• Despite the growing study of textile antennas in the past decades, the electromagnetic 

characterization of dielectric textile materials, to use as dielectric substrate, is still a 

challenge. Until now, none work has analysed the influence of the structural parameters of 

textiles on their dielectric behaviour; 

• Also, so far, all textile antennas have been built stand-alone and are further glued into 

clothing to measure the performance when close to human body. No one has so far fully 

integrated a textile antenna on clothing, consequently there are no studies about the 

influence of the human body on the integrated antenna; 

• Several manufacturing techniques of textile antennas are presented in the state of the art, 

but no industrial solution was found; 

• At last, the integration of wearable devices raises the question about how to feed them. 

The textile antennas for energy harvesting emerge as a particularly interesting solution 

when the replacement of batteries is not easy to practice, such as in embedded wearable 

systems. Despite the growth in rigid antennas for energy harvesting and wireless power 

transmission, only few works have been presented using textile antennas. 

1.2 Objectives 
The general objective of this PhD Thesis is to characterize the dielectric properties of the 

textile materials, in order to select and develop a group of industrial textile materials, well 

suited to apply as dielectric substrates for textile antennas for energy harvesting. To achieve 

this goal, six specific objectives were considered: 

1. Characterize the dielectric properties of textile materials, studying the influence of some 

structural properties of textiles on their electromagnetic behaviour;

1.3 Outline 
This PhD Thesis is organized in nine Chapters. This first one presents the motivation to study 

textile antennas and the objectives of this work. Chapter 2 describes the electromagnetic 

properties of the textile materials used to manufacturing textile antennas. Also, presents a 

survey of the key points for the design and development of textile antennas, from the choice 

of the textile materials to the framing of the antenna. Still, manufacturing techniques of the 

textile antennas are described.		

Chapter 3 gives an overview about the resonant and non-resonant methods to characterize the 

dielectric properties of textile materials. Moreover, it presents and compares the obtained 

results in the dielectric characterization to the performance of textile antennas. Chapter 4 

presents the Resonator-Based Experimental Technique. This new method to characterize the 

dielectric properties of textiles is based on the theory of resonance-perturbation. It aims 

extracting the permittivity and loss tangent values based on the shifts caused by the 

introduction of a superstrate on the patch of a microstrip antenna. Also, this Chapter correlates 

the results obtained on the dielectric characterization with some structural parameters of 

textiles, such as surface roughness and superficial and bulk porosities. 

Chapter 5 describes the concept of the energy harvesting and presents a survey of textile 

antennas for RF energy harvesting. A dual-band printed monopole textile antenna for 

electromagnetic energy harvesting, operating at GSM 900 and DCS 1800 bands is also proposed 

in this Chapter. In order to improve the performance of this printed monopole textile antenna, 

Chapter 6 then tests several manufacturing techniques by evaluating the S11 parameter of a 

patch microstrip textile antenna. Also, the electrical resistance sheet of two conductive fabrics 

was characterized and analysed. Further, seven prototypes of the printed monopole textile 

antennas were manufactured by laminating and embroidering techniques and were tested.  

Chapter 7 presents the first prototype with a fully integrated textile antenna, named E-Caption: 

Smart and Sustainable Coat. It has an embedded dual-band printed monopole textile antenna 

for RF energy harvesting. This printed antenna is fully integrated, as its dielectric is the textile 

material composing the coat itself. The E-Caption illustrates the innovative concept of textile 

antennas that can be manipulated as simple emblems. Furthermore, this Chapter analyses the 

results obtained, before and after the integration of the antenna into cloth.  

Finally, Chapter 8 ends the experimental work presenting the first continuous Substrate 

Integrating the Ground Plane (SIGP). The SIGP is a novel textile material that integrates the 

dielectric substrate and the conductive ground plane in a single textile fabric. The 

manufacturing and electromagnetic characterization processes are described. Also, to validate 

this new substrate, a microstrip patch antenna for energy harvesting was developed and tested.

To sum up, Chapter 9 gives a final remark, summarizing the main conclusions and presenting 

the future works.

Materials and Processes for Textile Antennas  

 

The content of this chapter was partially published on Sensors Journal (2012), and as chapter 

on the books Fashion Spaces: Geographical, Physical and Virtual (2016), and Wearable 

Technologies and Wireless Body Sensor Networks for Healthcare (2017). 

 In the context of IoT, textile antennas offer the possibility of ubiquitous monitoring, 

communication and energy harvesting and storage. Several properties of the materials 

influence the behaviour of the antenna. For instance, the bandwidth and the efficiency of a 

planar antenna are mainly determined by the permittivity and the thickness of the substrate. 

The use of textiles in wearable antennas requires the characterization of their properties. 

Specific electrical conductive textiles are available on the market and have been successfully 

used. Ordinary textile fabrics have been used as substrates. In general, textiles present a very 

low dielectric constant that reduces the surface wave losses and increases the impedance 

bandwidth of the antenna. However, textile materials are constantly exchanging water 

molecules with the surroundings, which affects their electromagnetic properties. In addition, 

textile fabrics are porous, anisotropic and compressible materials whose thickness and density 

might change with low pressures. Therefore, it is important to know how these characteristics 

influence the behaviour of the antenna in order to minimize unwanted effects. This Chapter 

presents a survey of the key points for the design and development of textile antennas, from 

the choice of the textile materials to the framing of the antenna. An analysis of the textile 

materials that have been used is also presented. Further, manufacturing techniques of the 

textile antennas are described.? 

 

2.1 Introduction 

Body worn systems endowed with sensing, processing, actuation, communication and energy 

harvesting and storage abilities are emerging as a solution to the challenges of ubiquitous 

monitoring of people in applications such as healthcare, lifestyle, protection and safety [10], 

[11]. Accordingly, the new generation of clothing will be able to sense, communicate data and 

harvest energy in a nonintrusive way. The wearable antenna is thus the bond that integrates 

cloth into the communication system, making electronic devices less obtrusive. To achieve good 



 10 

results, wearable antennas have to be thin, lightweight, low maintenance, robust, inexpensive 

and easily integrated in radio frequency (RF) circuits. Thus, planar antennas are the preferred 

type of antenna as, despite the fact their maximum attainable bandwidth-efficiency is 

significantly lower than the theoretical limit for electrically small antennas, they allow an 

excellent integration of the antenna with the RF circuits, feeding lines and matching circuits 

on a standard multilayer board material [8]. Specific requirements for the design of wearable 

antennas are thus: planar structure; flexible conductive materials in the patch and ground 

plane; and flexible dielectric materials. The characteristics of the materials are crucial for the 

behaviour of the antenna. For instance, the permittivity and the thickness of the dielectric 

substrate mainly determine the bandwidth and the efficiency performance of the planar 

antenna [8]. Also, the conductivity of the ground plane and of the patch is an important factor 

in the efficiency of the antenna and must be the highest possible.  

Textile materials, being universally used and easily available, are possible materials to design 

wearable antennas. Therefore, specific conductive textiles, sometimes designated 

electrotextiles, that are commercially available have been successfully used in antennas. 

Ordinary textile fabrics have been used as dielectric substrates. However, little information is 

found on the electromagnetic properties of regular commercialized textiles.  

Fabrics are flexible and compressible materials which thickness and density might change with 

low pressures. Moreover, the main orientation of the fibres and/or yarns introduces an intrinsic 

planar anisotropy of general properties. Plus, fibres are constantly exchanging water molecules 

with the surroundings, which affects their morphology and properties. All these features are 

somehow difficult to control in real applications of textiles. This Chapter presents the state of 

art reviewing the characteristics of textiles that influences the performance of the antennas.  

2.2 Electromagnetic Properties of Textiles 
As explained on Chapter 1, planar antennas, such as microstrip patch type, have been proposed 

for wearable applications. These antennas are usually formed by assembling conductive and 

dielectric layers, as previously presented on Figure 1-2. Their dimensions are directly related 

to the desired resonance frequency which are defined as portions of the wavelength of 

propagation [8]. The wavelength is dependent on the permittivity and permeability of the 

propagation medium (e.g. the dielectric substrate). For this reason, the knowledge of the 

electromagnetic properties of the textile materials is crucial to design wearable antennas [12].  

The response of the material to the electromagnetic fields is described by the constitutive 

parameters of the material: permittivity (?), permeability (µ) and conductivity (?). These 

parameters also determine the spatial extent to which the electromagnetic field can penetrate 

the material at a given frequency. The relationship between these constitutive parameters and 

the electromagnetic fields is described through the Maxwell’s equations [13]. For the design of 

antennas, the permittivity is the key parameter to characterise the substrate material and the 



 11 

conductivity characterises the conductive components. The next subsections will present the 

definition and physical significance of the main variables. The conductive and dielectric textile 

materials, that have been used to develop wearable antennas, will also be described and 

discussed. 

2.2.1  Dielectric Textiles 

In the dielectric materials, the conductivity is very small or null (?&amp;lt;&amp;lt;1). Thus, their 

electromagnetic behaviour is mainly determined by the permittivity and the permeability. 

Permittivity describes the interaction of the material with the electric field applied on it, 

whereas permeability describes the interaction of the material with the magnetic field applied 

on it.  

Permittivity is a complex value that generally depends on frequency, temperature and moisture 

[13]–[15]. Furthermore, permittivity is usually expressed as a relative value (?r), given by (2-1), 

where ?o is the permittivity of vacuum, equal to 8.854×10)*+	F/m. 

? = ?2?3 = ?2 ??3 ? ??"3                                             (2-1) 

The relative permittivity is often called dielectric constant. The real part of the relative 

permittivity (?’r) is a measure of how much energy from an external electric field is stored in 

the material. The imaginary part of the relative permittivity (?”r), or loss factor, is a measure 

of how dissipative a material is to an external electric field.  

The ratio between the imaginary and the real part of the relative permittivity is the loss tangent 

(tan?) – often called the material dissipation factor (Df), expressed by (2-2). In the ideal 

scenario, the perfect dielectric material has tan? = 0.  

????	 =&amp;lt;"=
&lt;&gt;=

                                                      (2-2) 

When designing antennas, the key parameter for the performance of the dielectric substrate is 

the relative permittivity as well as the loss tangent.  

As textile materials are anisotropic materials, their characterization also depends on the 

electric field’s orientation. This anisotropy is fully described by a permittivity tensor, although 

in most practical applications like the ones herein surveyed, one specific component of this 

tensor is enough to characterize the behaviour of the textile material for a specific application.   

Besides the dielectric behaviour of textile materials being dependent on frequency, 

temperature and humidity [16]–[19], it also depends on the properties of the component fibres 

and the structure of the yarns and/or of the fabrics, and on the fibre packing density in the 

fibrous material [16], [20]–[22]. Also, textile materials incorporate some intrinsic singularities 

difficulties due to their inhomogeneity and instability, being a challenge in terms of accurate 

characterization, as will be discussed on Chapters 3 and 4. 



 12 

In general, textiles present a very low dielectric constant as they are very porous materials and 

the presence of air approaches the relative permittivity to one. As reference, Table 2-1 shows 

the dielectric constant of different materials.

For the development of wearable antennas, several conventional textile fabrics have been 

applied as dielectric substrate, exhibiting very low ?r and tan?, which reduce the surface wave 

losses and improve the impedance bandwidth of the antenna. Surface waves are connected to 

the guided wave propagation within the substrate. Hence, by reducing the dielectric constant, 

the contribution of the spatial waves increases, and consequently the impedance bandwidth of 

the antenna increases, allowing the development of antennas with higher gain and acceptable 

efficiency [27]–[30]. A sufficiently wideband and efficient planar textile antenna is realized by 

selecting a substrate with a low dielectric constant (preferably ? 4) and a low loss tangent  

(&lt;10-2) [31]. 

2.2.1.1  Influence of the Thickness of Dielectric Textiles 

The thickness of the substrate is critical in the design of the antenna. As textile materials 

present a quite narrow range of relative permittivity values, it is therefore their thickness, 

which values may present much larger variations, that will mainly determine the bandwidth as 

well the input impedance of the antenna and so its resonance frequency [8], [32]. 

For a fixed relative permittivity, the substrate thickness may be chosen to maximize the 

bandwidth of the planar antenna. Therefore, the choice of the thickness of the dielectric 

material is a compromise between efficiency and bandwidth of the antenna [32]. The influence 

of the thickness on the bandwidth (BW) of the antenna may be explained by Equation (2-3), 

where Q is the antenna quality factor:  

??~1/?                                                      (2-3) 

The Q factor is influenced by the space wave (Qrad) losses, the conduction Ohmic (Qc) losses, 

the surface waves (Qsw) and dielectric (Qd) losses as shown in Equation 2-4 [8]:

 13 

For thin substrates (h«?), where h is the thickness of the material and ? is the wavelength of 

the frequency), the quality factor associated with radiation (Qrad) is usually the dominant factor 

and is inversely proportional to the height of the substrate [8], [32]. Therefore, increasing the 

height of the substrate lowers the Q factor (Qt). As the Q-factor decreases with an increased 

spacing between the patch and the ground planes of the antenna, a thicker substrate yields a 

larger antenna bandwidth [31]. 

Moreover, the thickness of the substrate also influences the geometric sizing of the antenna. 

This means that a thick substrate with low dielectric constant (value between 1 and 2) results 

in a large patch and a thin substrate with the same dielectric constant results in a smaller patch 

[33]. There are commercially available fabrics with a very large range of thickness values. Plus, 

nominal thickness values are given in any technical data sheet, allowing a careful choice of the 

material based on the required thickness. Moreover, accurate values of the thickness of fabrics 

under specific pressure are easily obtained by simple standard methods, such as ISO 5084:1996 

[34] or with the Kawabata’s Evaluation System for Fabrics [35]. Therefore, the thickness of the 

fabrics is a feature that may guide the search for suitable textile dielectrics.  

2.2.1.2 Influence of the Moisture Content 

Textiles always establish a dynamic equilibrium with the temperature and humidity of the air 

surrounding they are in contact with, as the fibres are constantly exchanging water molecules 

with the air. However, the amount of water that a material takes until reaching this equilibrium 

depends on the type of material. The extent to which a material is sensitive to moisture is 

described by its regain, which is defined, by the ratio of the mass of absorbed water in specimen 

to the mass of dry specimen, expressed as a percentage [16]. In [16], page 169 shows the 

relation between regain and relative humidity of the air (RH), for various textile fibres, 

compiling studies made by several authors. Indeed, for the same RH conditions, there are 

textile fibres with largely different moisture contents. For instance, at 65% RH, wool fibre might 

present a regain of 14.5%, cotton might present a regain of 7.5% and polyester fibre might 

present a regain of 0.2%.  

In general, the moisture absorption changes the properties of the fabrics. Because of this, 

textile metrology is performed always in a conditioned environment (20°C and 65% RH). Also, 

for commercial transactions there are national legislations setting nominal values of moisture 

content that are values close to the regain obtained at 65% RH.  

Water has a dielectric constant of ?r = 78 at 2.45 GHz and 25°C [18]. Although this value depends 

on the salinity, temperature and frequency, water has a much higher and more stable dielectric 

constant than textile fabrics, whose dielectric constant is generally in the range ?r = 1 – 2 

because of their high porosity, as previously presented. Therefore, when water is absorbed by 

the textile fibres or is trapped into the fabric structure, it changes the electromagnetic 

properties of the fabric, increasing its dielectric constant and loss [16]–[18], [22], [36]. Charts 

presenting the relationship between the RH of the air or the moisture content of various fibres 



 14 

and their dielectric properties can be found in [16]. Additionally, several authors have been 

correlating the electromagnetic properties of fabrics to their absorption properties [17], [18], 

[37], [38].  

Likewise, the absorbed water by or trapped into the textile components of the antenna 

dramatically changes the behaviour of the antenna. The higher permittivity of the water drives 

the performance of the antenna, reducing its resonance frequency and bandwidth [18], [29], 

[36], [37].  

Beyond these effects, when textile fibres absorb water they swell transversely and axially, 

causing tightening of the fabrics [16]. This tightness affects the dimensional stability of the 

fabrics and therefore affects the dimensional stability of the antenna, influencing its behaviour 

[36].  In general, the characteristics of antennas based on textile materials with small moisture 

absorption values (regain less than 3%) are more stable [18]. Therefore, materials with low 

regain are preferable for use as substrates and the same conclusion applies to the textile 

conductive components of the antenna.  

2.2.2  Conductive Textiles 

Generally, the fabrics are insulating materials. However, there are materials with high 

electrical conductivity, which incorporate fibres, filaments or coatings of metals or conductive 

polymers [39]–[44]. There is a large range of commercially available electrotextiles (e.g., Less 

EMF Inc. at http://www.lessemf.com or Shieldex Trading at http://www.shieldextrading.net) 

with high conductivity, enabling the development of antennas with acceptable performance.  

Fabrics are planar materials and, therefore, their electrical behaviour may be quantified by 

the surface (or sheet) resistance (Rs) and characterized by the surface (or sheet) resistivity (?s). 

The resistance, which unit is [?], is the ratio of a DC voltage (U) to the current flowing between 

electrodes that are in contact with the same face of the material under test in a specific 

configuration, as shown on Figure 2-1. In a conductivity measuring apparatus, the resistance 

may be dependent on the geometry of the electrodes used for measurement. Nevertheless, 

resistance can be related to the sheet resistance, which is independent of the geometry of the 

conductor. The sheet resistance is the ratio of the DC voltage drop per unit length (L) to the 

surface current (Is) per unit width (D). It is thus a property of the material, not depending on 

the configuration of the electrodes used for the measurement [45]. The results of sheet 

resistance (Rs) are given in [?/?] [46].The sheet resistivity is then determined by multiplying 
the sheet resistance by the thickness of the material.  



 15 

 
Figure 2-1 Basic setup for surface resistance and surface resistivity measurement 

The conductivity of the fabric, which unit is Siemens per meter [S/m], is related to the sheet 
resistance by Equation (2-5), where h is the thickness of the fabric:  

? =	 *
(LH	.		M)

                                                     (2-5) 

The sheet resistance is usually given by the manufacturer and may be measured by standard 

methods, such as, ASTM Standard D 257-99 Standard Test Method for DC Resistance or 

Conductance of Moderately Conductive Materials [46], ASTM Standard F 1896 – Test Method for 

Determine the Electrical Resistivity of a Printed Conductive Material [47], AATCC Test Method 

76-2011: Electrical Surface Resistivity of Fabrics [48], among others [49], [50]. Despite the 

existence of several standard methods, an accurate characterization of highly conductive 

fabrics demands specific techniques, such as for instance the ones based on transmission lines 

and waveguide cavities [26], [51]–[53]. 

Besides the dielectric constant of the substrate, the choice of the conductive fabric for the 

patch and the ground planes is also very important to assure a good performance of the 

antenna. In general, the conductive fabrics must have a very low electrical sheet resistance, 

?1 ?/?, in order to minimize the electric losses and thus increase the antenna efficiency. 

Despite the fact that the surface resistance value should be constant over the area of the 

antenna [36], the fabric may present some heterogeneities, such as for instance some 

discontinuities in the electric current. If these discontinuities are parallel to the surface current 

they will not interfere with the electromagnetic fields [54], but if discontinuities prevents the 

flow of the electrical current, the fabric resistance will increase [36].  

Other factors, as for instance the float, which is the length of the conductive yarns laying on 

the surface of the woven, also influence the electrical behaviour of the material. The side with 

the longest floats  of conductive electric wires exhibit lower sheet resistance than the other 

side [36]. Likewise, a higher density of conductive wires also cause lower sheet resistance [51]. 

Furthermore, the humidity content in the material is also an important factor to consider when 



 16 

determining the electrical resistivity of textile materials, because the presence of moisture in 

the fibres significantly decreases the electrical resistivity [16], [38], [52], [55]. 

2.3 Influence of Mechanical Deformation of Conductive 
and Dielectric Textiles 

Flexibility and elasticity are other requirements of the textile materials used to develop 

wearable antennas, in order to withstand the deformations caused by the bending angles of the 

human body. However, when the textile fabric adapts to the surface topology it bends and 

deforms, causing changes to its electromagnetic properties and thus influencing the antenna 

performance [29], [56]–[59]. Indeed, the bending and the elongation of the dielectric fabric 

change the geometric precision of the shape of the antenna, influencing its permittivity and its 

thickness, which affects the resonance frequency of the antenna and especially the bandwidth, 

as previously explained.  

Moreover, knits may present higher anisotropy than woven, showing different electric surface 

resistance along the longitudinal and the transversal directions and this anisotropy may increase 

with the knit deformation. According to Locher et al. [36], for the studied knit material that is 

composed of silver plated polyamide fibres, deformations under 8% of elongation along the 

direction of the wales (see on Figure 2-2) slightly change the surface resistivity. However, when 

elongating the knitted fabric along the direction of the courses the electric surface resistivity 

results stable up to 3% of elongation but then increases and at 8% of elongation it reaches the 

triple of the initial value.

example of plain weave – warp and weft

 17 

In addition, from the point of view of manufacturing antennas, the elasticity of the fabrics is 

an inconvenience as it makes difficult the precise definition and cut of the shape of the 

components and also makes difficult the superposition of the several materials without folds. 

Woven and nonwovens, being more stable fabrics than knits, allow higher geometrical 

accuracies of the frame of the antenna. In general, the accuracy depends on the thickness of 

the component yarns or fibres. For instance, conductive woven may allow an accuracy of about 

±0.15 mm [36].  

2.4 Brief Survey on Textile Materials Used in Wearable 
Antennas 

Wearable antennas are a recent research subject [27]. One of the first proposals on the subject 

was a Planar Inverted F Antenna (PIFA) for dual-band operation, built on a flexible unspecified 

substrate, presented in 2001 by Salonen et al.[7]. It was intended to be placed in the sleeve of 

clothing and operate at Global System for Mobile (GSM) (900 MHz) and Bluetooth (2.4 GHz) 

frequency, although the lower band was not achieved, the antenna still showed good 

performance, even in human-body presence, around the 2.4 GHz band. Later in 2003, they 

presented an antenna built on a textile substrate intended for Wireless Local Area Network 

(WLAN) applications [60], where results are claimed to be acceptable. Furthermore, in 2004 

Salonen et al. [28] proposed a Global Positioning System (GPS) antenna with circular 

polarization, in which they have experimented with five different synthetic fabric materials as 

dielectric substrates. The conductive parts were made of copper tape. The dielectric synthetic 

materials used were: (1) Vellux®, which is a 5 mm thick fabric covered on both surfaces with 

thin layers of plastic foam; (2) synthetic felt, which is a 4 mm thick nonwoven in which fibres 

are looser on the surface than in the centre; (3) Delinova 200®, which is a strong fabric made 

of polyamide Cordura® fibres laminated with Gore-Tex membrane, weighing about 370 g/m2 

and having a thickness of 0.5 mm; (4) fleece, which is a very soft polyester fabric with 4 mm 

thickness, commonly used in sportswear; (5) upholstery fabric, which is composed of three 

fabric layers bound together resulting in a thin (1.1 mm) fabric of polyester and acrylic that 

has firmness. The ?r, of the five fabrics was measured by a cavity perturbation method, at 1.575 

GHz, and the values ranged between 1.1 and 1.7. Among the studied fabrics, the one made of 

high tenacity polyamide fibres (Cordura®) was pointed out as the more interesting fabric for 

the development of a flexible antenna, because of its constant thickness and its high resistance. 

These properties yield more stable geometric dimensions of the antenna. 

More recent demonstrations on wearable antennas for personal area networks (PANs) to operate 

in the 2.45 GHz industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) band and for GPS applications are 

presented in [33], [61]. In these examples, antennas for wearable protective clothing intended 

for professional use under rough conditions are presented and their behaviour in various 

practical scenarios is discussed. High performance aramid fabric that can withstand high 



 18 

temperatures is applied as substrate while conductive textiles, like Shieldit® and Flectron®, are 

used for the antenna patch and ground planes. These antennas have shown acceptable 

performance, even in a real environment with human-body presence and when subjected to 

bending and deformations. 

In 2006, Locher et al. [36] have built four purely textile wearable patch antennas for Bluetooth 

applications. They have used three electrical conductive fabrics: (1) a nickel-plated woven 

fabric (with plating thickness about 250 nm applied on the fabric surface); (2) a silver-plated 

knitted fabric; (3) a silver-copper-nickel-plated woven fabric. Fabric (3) is the one preferred 

for building textile antennas with geometric precision, as it is woven and not knitted and its 

electric surface resistance was more homogeneous than the one of fabric (1). For the dielectric 

substrate, they used two types of fabrics: (1) woollen felt of 1.050 g/m2 with a thickness of 3.5 

mm and (2) polyamide spacer fabric, of 530 g/m2, with a thickness of 6 mm. The felt was 

dimensionally more stable and harder to bend, whereas the spacer fabric was lighter and more 

elastic owing to its knitting-based structure. The dielectric properties were measured by a 

transmission line method, at a frequency of 2.4 GHz, obtaining as results for the felt: ?r = 1.45 

and tan? = 0.02, and for the spacer fabric: ?r = 1.14 and the loss tangent was negligible. The 

four different antennas produced have shown good performance and could satisfy the Bluetooth 

specifications, even when subjected to bending effects. However, the antennas lose their 

circular polarization when subject to bending. 

In the same year, Tronquo et al. [29] presented rectangular-ring textile antennas for body area 

networks (BAN) that are circularly polarized, covering a bandwidth of more than 190 MHz. For 

the conductive antenna patch and ground plane they applied Flectron®, which is a thin copper 

plated fabric with low sheet resistance, lesser then 0.1 ?/? For the dielectric substrate they 
relied on a fleece fabric of 2.56 mm thickness. Its dielectric properties were measured by 

testing antennas and they obtained a dielectric constant of ?r = 1.25. 

In 2007, Zhu and Langley [62] developed a dual-band coplanar patch antenna integrating 

electromagnetic band gap material (EGB), to operate at the 2.45 and 5.8 GHz wireless bands. 

The conductive parts were made of Zelt® fabric whereas the dielectric substrate was a thin 

felt, with 1.1 mm thickness, and with ?r = 1.30 and tan? = 0.02. 

The performance of the textile antennas presented earlier can be improved with integrated 

solutions, if diverse techniques such as for instance Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) are 

considered [63], or, as shown in [64], by introducing a low-noise amplifier (LNA) in a garment 

to achieve an active integrated antenna, increasing the sensitivity and the gain of the overall 

system. 

Declercq et al. [65] showed another integrated solution consisting of an aperture-coupled 

antenna on a textile and foam substrate, with a flexible solar cell for tracking and monitoring 

solutions. Instead of integrating a LNA to increase the wearable antenna performance, Zhu and 

Langley [62], [66] developed a dual-band coplanar patch antenna, to operate in the 2.45 and 



 19 

5.8 GHz wireless bands, in which they integrated an electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) to reduce 

body-presence effects and increase antenna gain. As shown in Table 1, the conductive parts 

were made of Zelt® fabric while the dielectric substrate was a thin felt with ?r = 1.30 and       

tan? = 0.02. They proved that the introduction of the 3x3 arrays EBG with the coplanar patch 

could reduce the radiation towards the body by 10 dB, while increasing the antenna gain in        

3 dB. 

In order to improve flexibility in the antenna design and to achieve compact dimensions for 

easier antenna integration into clothing, in 2015 [67] S. Agneessens et al. designed and 

manufactured a circular quarter-mode textile antenna, using Substrate Integrate Waveguides 

(SIW) technology, operating in the ISM band. The patch and ground planes were made of 

conductive e-textile copper-plated polyester plain woven fabric, with low sheet resistance 0.18 

?/? at 2.45 GHz, whereas the dielectric substrate was a flexible closed-cell expanded rubber 

protective foam, with 3.7 mm thickness, ?r = 1.495 and tan? = 0.016. Furthermore, this paper 

studies the influence of the human body on the antenna behaviour, obtaining gains equals 3.8 

and 4.2 dBi in an on-body and free space scenario, respectively. Previously, in 2014 [68], these 

authors had already proposed another antenna design, a dual-band antenna for body-worn 

application operating in the ISM frequency bands 2.4 and 5.8 GHz, using the same materials 

described above. In this SIW technology, several wearable antennas were implemented with 

conductive fabrics and diverse flexible substrates, including 3D knit and cork [69]–[71]. 

In the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) context, the miniaturization of the tag technology 

brought significant advances in this field, improving their functionality and applicability. 

Nowadays, the size of the RFID tag depends on the constraints of the antenna. For this reason, 

the design of suitable antennas continues to be challenging. Based on this framework, some 

authors have been investigating textile antennas for commercial advertisement proposes, such 

as brand names and logotypes. Elmahgoub et al. [72] in 2010 proposed two RFID tags based on 

the merge of logos from The University of Mississippi (TUM) and Tampere University of 

Technology (TUT). The authors applied four different substrates, (1) PET - Polyethylene 

Terephthalate film, (2) thin film, (3) paper and (4) fabric, and applied three manufacturing 

techniques: (A) manual cutting, (B) stitching and (C) screen print, in order to verify the 

efficiency of the designed logo. In the textile fabric case, despite the woven fabric used as 

dielectric substrate remains unspecified, the most promising results in terms of conductivity 

and performance by screen printing with silver ink. Using the materials described above (3 and 

C), two tags have been proposed: one operating at 866 MHz and another at 915 MHz. Both tags 

performed well when compared with simulation, and long read distances of 11.2 and 7 meters, 

were achieved respectively.  

Not only limited to RFID tags, Tak and Choi in 2015 [73], developed a Luis Vuitton logo antenna 

for integration into a handbag. This dual-band antenna, for ISM 2.45GHz and 4.5 GHz, was 

designed and fabricated using five layers of sheepskin-leather substrate with 0.7 mm thickness 

for each layer (3.5 mm in total), ?r = 2.5 and tan? = 0.035. For the conductive parts, Zell
® fabric 



 20 

(Shieldex Trading, Palmyra, USA), with Rs = 0.02 ?/? and 0.1 mm thickness was used. The 
antenna is essentially a microstrip patch antenna, in which the patch assumes the form of the 

Louis Vuitton logo. It achieves dual band operation due to its characteristic structure. The size 

of the logo was obtained through optimization in order to match its input impedance in the ISM 

bands. The radiation pattern is expected to be directive. However, due to the large losses of 

the dielectric, the efficiencies fall short at 15.2% at 2.49 GHz, and at 41.4% at 4.52 GHz, 

yielding gains of -0.29 dBi and 3.05 dBi, respectively. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to consider 

this antenna for IoT applications, which usually comprises short distances of communication. 

Table 2-2 summarizes the several textile materials that have been applied to develop wearable 

antennas.

2.5  Manufacturing Techniques of Textile Antennas 
In the printed antennas developed by Hertleer et al. [18] an alteration of no more than 0.5 mm 

on the length or the width of the patch influenced the performance of the antenna by causing 

a slight shift of the antenna characteristics. For this reason, woven fabrics, being more stable, 

are preferred to make the patches. However, the antenna geometrical stability can be achieved 

if at least one component is less deformable. For example, bonding using an adhesive sheet 

with a deformable patch, such as a conductive knit, with a less deformable substrate, such a 



 21 

woven dielectric, results in a stable frame [28], [36].  

The techniques used to connect the various layers must not affect the electrical properties of 

the patch, such as its surface resistivity, nor the permittivity of the substrate. Connections 

using adhesive sheets or conductive fabrics with a thermal adhesive face have shown good 

results [33], [36], [37], [73], [75]. This process of attachment of the superposed layers is very 

simple to perform by a simple ironing operation. However, attention should be made to the 

ironing process, in special if the patch is made of a fabric with metallic components. Indeed, 

the oxidation of the metallic component, due to the hot moistening of the fabric, may increase 

the surface resistance of the fabric and so decrease the efficiency of the textile antenna [51], 

[76].  

Connection with seams is an alternative technique [28], [29], [36], [58] but it presents some 

difficulties. Firstly, the seam must be plane, without wrinkling, what might be difficult to 

achieve with deformable materials. Secondly, the stitch passes through all materials: the 

patch, then the substrate and further the ground plane of the antenna, which may cause 

electrical shorts between them. In Locher et al. [36] report that the sewing needle has pulled 

conductive fibres from the patch through the substrate, shorting the patch with the ground 

plane.  

Another technique is connecting with liquid adhesives. However, it is difficult to apply a thin 

layer of glue. This difficulty introduces heterogeneity and in the zones where there are 

accumulations the glue may play the role of insulator between the conductive yarns of the 

patch. Furthermore, these adhesives are usually stiff and brittle, and so they cannot be applied 

in an area-wide manner on textiles as they will interfere in their flexibility [36]. In order to 

obtain a uniform thickness of the attachment of the several layers, Tronquo et al. [29], [30] 

perform an additional stitch, in addition to the glue. Also, in [33] a smooth fabric was added 

to both faces of the substrate to optimise the attachment of the conductive components.  

The positioning of the textile components must consider the differences between right and 

back faces, in terms of roughness and of density of conductive elements [51], [52], [77]. In 

[51], [77], a satin 5 woven was tested in a microstrip resonator, placing it in two positions: (1) 

with the right face against the dielectric substrate and (2) with the back face, the conductive 

one, against the dielectric substrate. It was observed that when the conductive face is placed 

on the top of the substrate and so underneath the nonconductive yarns of the nonconductive 

face, most of the electrical field is contained in the substrate. Thus, the dielectric loss in the 

nonconductive yarns is minimized.  

Besides the use of conductive fabrics, several other ways to manufacture the conductive parts 

of the antenna have been explored, such as embroidering and screen printing. Matthews and 

Pettit presented in [78] three types of antennas, which are integrated into clothing: a 

broadband wire dipole, a bowtie and a spiral antenna, operating in frequencies from 100 MHz 

to 1 GHz. They have tested different materials (textiles and others), different frames and 



 22 

manufacturing techniques. Among the tested conductive materials there are conductive ribbon, 

conductive paint and ink, conductive nylon fabric (that is also adhesive on the back face), 

phosphor bronze mesh fabric (also adhesive on the back face), conductive thread, liquid crystal 

polymer (LCP) and copper coated fabric. The phosphor bronze mesh, LCP and copper coated 

fabric have the advantage that the antennas can be directly soldered onto. In some antennas, 

a conducting epoxy was used to bond the materials, but this results in some lack of robustness. 

In terms of radio frequency (RF) performance of the designed antennas, the spiral antenna, 

where the spiral is embroidered with conductive thread, performed worse than any other 

antenna and was clearly lossy. Overall, based on RF performance, they concluded the most 

attractive materials to design wearable antennas were the textile fabrics: the conductive nylon 

and the copper coated fabrics. 

In [74] the stability and efficiency of wearable and washable antennas are discussed for textile 

antennas in which the conductive parts were screen printed with conductive ink. These 

antennas have shown acceptable performance. The combination of screen-printing with a 

breathable thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) coating ensured that performance was 

maintained even after several wash cycles. Also in [79] the authors were used screen printing 

technique to manufacture a rectenna for 2.45 GHz for RF power transfer and harvesting. In this 

work, to reduce the surface roughness insuring the continuous conductivity of the conductive 

layer, an interface ink layer was applied between the textile substrate and the conductive ink. 

Besides the interface layer increase the losses on the dielectric substrate, the measured and 

the simulated S11 of antenna
3, agree very well. 

An embroidered technique was applied in [62], [66] to sew conductive fibres into polymer and 

fabric substrates. It was proved that by increasing the density of the embroidering stitching, 

the conductivity of the conductive section increases as well as the accuracy of the fabricated 

prototypes, yielding better agreement with the simulations. Dipole, spiral and microstrip patch 

antennas were fabricated with this technique. They yielded very good RF performance when 

compared to the corresponding rigid copper structures.  

Finally, the connections at the antenna terminals may also be critical as in wearable and 

flexible antennas these connections have to be mechanically robust. In general, textile fabrics 

cannot be directly soldered to (an exception is Flectron®
 
that already showed good resistance 

to soldering [33]). Therefore, conductive epoxy has been used, but some concerns remain as 

this connection is not very resistant [78]. 

A promising way to produce conductive elements is integrating conductive wires into the 

textiles through the three-dimensional (3D) weaving technique. This technique may contribute 

to improving the mechanical robustness and to eliminating the influence of the glue and/or 

seam [80].

2.6 Conclusions 

The developed wearable antennas are mainly planar ones, specifically microstrip patch 

antennas, because they mainly radiate perpendicularly to the planar structure and also their 

ground plane efficiently shields the human body. The bandwidth and efficiency performance of 

a planar microstrip antenna is mainly determined by the substrate dielectric constant and its 

thickness.  

In general, textiles present a very low dielectric constant, between 1 and 2, as they are very 

porous materials and the presence of air approaches the relative permittivity to one. The low 

dielectric constant reduces the surface wave losses that are tied to guided wave propagation 

within the substrates. Therefore, lowering the dielectric constant increases spatial waves and 

hence increases the impedance bandwidth of the antenna. However, lowering the substrate 

permittivity can also increase the resonance frequency of the antenna, allowing the 

development of antennas with acceptable efficiency and high gain.  

In addition, the ability of the fibres to absorb moisture must also be considered in the 

characterization of the dielectric behaviour of textiles. Water has a much higher and more 

stable dielectric constant than textile fabrics. Therefore, when water is absorbed by the textile 

fibres or is trapped in the fabric structure, it changes the electromagnetic properties of the 

fabric, increasing its dielectric constant and loss tangent. Likewise, the absorbed water by or 

trapped into the textile substrate reduces the resonance frequency and bandwidth of the 

antenna. In general, the characteristics of antennas based on textile materials with small 

moisture absorption (regain less than 3%) are more stable. Therefore, materials with such low 

regain values are preferable for use as substrates and as conductive components of the antenna.  

The thickness of the dielectric material is also crucial in the design of antennas. For a fixed 

relative permittivity, the substrate thickness may be chosen to maximize the bandwidth of the 

planar antenna. However, this value may not optimize the antenna efficiency. Therefore, the 

choice of the thickness of the dielectric material is a compromise between efficiency and 

bandwidth of the antenna. Moreover, the thickness of the substrate also influences the 

geometric sizing of the antenna.  

The conductive fabrics for the patch and the ground planes must have a very low electrical 

sheet resistance in order to minimize the electric losses and so increase the antenna efficiency. 

There are several conductive textile fabrics, and also yarns, available on the market that have 

been successfully used in planar antennas. Coated fabrics might perform worse than the fabrics 

having conductive fibres, because of discontinuities that may increase the surface resistivity. 

Woven and nonwovens, being more stable fabrics than knits, allow higher geometrical 

accuracies of the frame of the antenna and thus may be preferred to make the patch. In 

general, the sizing accuracy of the patch made of woven fabric depends on the thickness of the 

component yarns.  



 24 

Finally, after choosing the textile materials, their assemblage may also be critical, as the 

elongation and bending causes mechanical deformations that interfere with the antenna 

behaviour. The presence of at least one textile material presenting high tensile strength, high 

bending rigidity and stable geometry stabilizes the frame of the antenna. When connecting the 

various layers making up the antenna, the positioning of the textile fabrics must consider 

differences between right and back faces in terms of roughness and of density of conductive 

elements, in order to minimize losses.

Dielectric Characterization Methods Applied to 

Textiles Materials: A Survey  

 

The content of this Chapter was partially published as Chapter on the Book Wearable 

Technologies and Wireless Body Sensor Networks for Healthcare (2017).  

The accurate characterization of conventional textile materials to use as dielectric substrates 

in wearable systems is fundamental. However, little information can be found on the 

electromagnetic properties of regular textiles. Woven, knits and nonwovens are 

inhomogeneous, highly porous, compressible and easily influenced by the environmental 

hygrometric conditions, making their electromagnetic characterization difficult. Despite there 

is no standard method, several authors have been adapting techniques for the dielectric 

characterization of textiles. This survey gives an overview of the resonant and non-resonant 

methods to characterize the textile materials and leather, to be used as dielectric substrate 

on wearable antennas. Also, this Chapter summarizes the characterization of textile materials 

made through these methods and that were validated by testing antennas which perform well. 

 

3.1 Introduction  
The knowledge of the electromagnetic properties of the materials is essential to a good design 

of the antenna. As reviewed on Chapter 2, many criteria should be considered, as several 

characteristics of the textile materials directly affect the behaviour of the antenna. Specific 

electrically-conductive textiles are available on the market and have been successfully used in 

the radiating components. Conventional textile fabrics have been used as substrates. However, 

little information can be found on the electromagnetic properties of these regular textiles. 

Since [81], during the past century, several textile engineers have studied the dielectric 

properties of single fibres [16]. The main challenge founded on these works was the 

heterogeneity of air and fibres. Lather, in 2010, Bal and Kothari have reported a comparison of 

formulas for the air fibre mixture, used in the dielectric characterization [21]. Besides the large 

reports on the fibre context, only few researches on the characterization of fabrics were 

founded.  



 26 

The dielectric behaviour of textiles depends on the properties of the component fibres and the 

structure of the yarns and/or of the fabrics, and on the fibre packing density in the fibrous 

material [16], [22]. Also, being textiles highly porous materials, the presence of air and 

moisture influences their dielectric characterization.  

Despite the growth of research studies on textile antennas, the accurate characterization of 

the dielectric properties of the textile materials is still a challenge due to the intrinsic 

inhomogeneity and deformability of textiles [82]. Up today there is no standard method to 

measure the dielectric properties of textiles.  

The main objective of the methods for the electromagnetic characterization of dielectric 

materials is to measure the relative permittivity of the specimen for a specific frequency, or 

bandwidth frequency, and field orientation [15]. The methods for the characterization of the 

dielectric properties that have been used are generally subdivided into two main categories: 

resonant and non-resonant methods [13]. Each of these categories includes several procedures. 

The following Subsections describe the ones that have already been proposed and applied to 

characterize textile materials. 

3.2  Non-resonant Methods 
The non-resonant methods mainly include procedures based on reflection and 

transmission/reflection measurements. As the reflection-based techniques, the dielectric 

properties of the Material Under Test (MUT) are extracted based on the reflection of the 

electromagnetic waves in free space by the sample [13]. In transmission/reflection methods, 

the dielectric properties are calculated based on the reflection from and transmission through 

the sample [13]. For the characterization of textile materials, several non-resonant methods 

have been tested, such as transmission lines [12], [76], [83]–[85], metallic and dielectric 

waveguides [26] and free space [11], [62]-[63]. 

3.2.1  Parallel Plate Method 

The parallel plate method is the oldest way to measure the dielectric properties in fibre 

materials [81]. In this method, the material under test is placed between two parallel plates, 

as shown on Figure 3-1. In this case, the structure creates a capacitor whose capacity is 

measured by a LCR meter4. Owing to the simplicity of the procedure and the power measured 

by the LCR, this method is limited to the maximum 1 MHz frequency. Details about the 

theoretical equations can be found in [12]-[13]. In [89], nine textile fabrics were characterized 

at 200 kHz, under controlled ambient conditions to avoid the influence of moisture. The 

obtained results are summarized in following Table 3-1.

(R) of an electronic component.

3.2.2  Planar Transmission Lines Methods 

Planar transmission lines methods are the most common methods applied to characterize 

textile materials. Based on the scattering (S-) parameters, the advantage of this method is that 

it can also be applied to determine conductive properties, as presented in [14]-[15]. The planar 

transmission lines are subdivided into three types: microstrip, coplanar and stripline ones, as 

illustrated on Figure 3-2. 

As shown on Figure 3-2 (d), the stripline consists of upper and lower grounding planes, and a 

central conductive line. The dielectric material under test is placed between the grounding 

planes and the central line. The advantage of this structure of transmission line is that the 

radiation losses are negligible. In [83], a stripline prototype was built to characterize a denim 

fabric, 100% cotton, at 2.45 GHz. For the conductive parts Flectron® fabric was applied and to 

design the transmission line they used an estimated ?r = 1.2. As this stripline required h = 2.45 

mm, five layers of denim fabric were superposed. The measurements with the VNA yielded ?r = 

2.117 and tan? = 0.01. To validate this method, a microstrip patch antenna for 2.45 GHz was 

designed and manufactured using the same materials. The antenna has shown good 

performance and 6.1594 dBi of gain was obtained.

with ground plane and (d) stripline. Where: h and t are the thickness of the dielectric and conductive 
materials, respectively; w is the length of the line and g is the gap between the line and the ground plane  

in coplanar lines; Wgnd is the length of the ground plane, respectively 



 28 

In [84], Mantash  et al. propose a comparison between a stripline and an open stub resonator, 

described in [91], to characterize felt and denim fabric. For the stub resonator, a copper tape 

was used for the conductive parts. Measuring at a non-specified single frequency, for the denim 

they extract ?r = 1.6 and tan? = 0.05, and for felt ?r = 1.22 and tan? = 0.016. As to the broadband 

measurements, the authors have used a stripline fixture resonator for the dielectric material. 

The results between 1 GHz and 6 GHz have shown a range of values from ?r = 1.215 to ?r = 1.225 

for the felt material, and from ?r = 1.6 to ?r = 1.65 for the denim fabric. Comparing the obtained 

results from the two methods, both are acceptable. In order to validate the results, two patch 

antennas for 2.45 GHz were proposed, using the permittivity value extracted at single 

frequency, and Shieldit® Super fabric (Rs =&amp;lt;0.5 ?/?) for the conductive parts. These antennas 
have shown a good agreement between the results and the simulated parameters.  

The propagation characteristics of two microstip transmission lines with different lengths were 

measured in [85]. The lines were made using Nora® fabric, with Rs = 0.03 ?/?, for the 
conductive parts, and an acrylic fabric with 0.5 mm of thickness for the dielectric substrate. 

Knowing the length difference and measuring the S-parameters between 3 and 10 GHz, the 

permittivity value for the acrylic fabric was calculated: ?r = 2.6. In order to validate the method, 

two Ultra Wilde-Band (UWB) (3.1 - 10.6 GHz) wearable antennas were designed. The measured 

antenna parameters have shown to be in agreement with simulation estimations. Besides, the 

antennas have been tested for transmission of UWB pulses into the human body in order to 

evaluate reflectivity, which can be used in diagnosis applications. Moreover, they have proven 

to be reliable when in close contact with the human body, proving the usefulness of the 

development of such antennas in textiles. 

In [79] the authors have used the two-lines technique as well. They characterize a fabric, whose 

fibrous composition is 65% PES and 35% CO, to use as a dielectric substrate of patch antenna 

for 2.45 GHz RF power transfer and harvesting. The fabric showed ?r = 3.23 and tan? = 0.06. 

The measurement of the S11 of screen printed antenna shows an excellent agreement with the 

simulated results. 

In [76], the authors have combined the two-lines method for microstrip lines with the matrix-

pencil technique, in order to reduce the perturbations in the parameters of the transmission 

lines. They have characterized four different materials: (1) woven fabric, 98% aramid and 2% 

carbon, with h= 0.60 mm and ?r = 1.57; (2) woven fabric, 98% aramid and 2% carbon, with h= 

0.40 mm and ?r = 1.91; (3) nonwoven polypropylene fabric with h= 3.60 mm and ?r = 1.18; (4) 

fleece with h= 2.56 mm and ?r = 1.25. For the conductive parts, copper sheet and Flectron® 

fabric were used to manufacture the transmission lines. The authors concluded that the lines 

using copper sheet enabled to estimate the loss tangent of the substrates under test, given that 

the losses in copper sheet are much smaller than in the Flectron®. To validate this method, the 

authors designed three textile antennas for 2.45 GHz, using the tested materials (1, 2 and 3)

as dielectric substrate. For the conductive parts, copper sheets and Flectron® fabric were used, 

and both copper and Flectron® based antennas exhibited good results.  

3.2.3  Free Space Methods 

This method typically consists in placing the material under test between two horn antennas, 

as show on Figure 3-3. By measuring the S-parameters - transmission (S11) and reflection (S21) 

coefficients - of the antennas with a VNA, the dielectric constant is estimated. The main 

advantage of the free space method is that it is contactless and non-destructive. The main 

drawback of this method is the required precise calibration of the horn antennas. 

 
Figure 3-3 Free-space measurement system 

In [86], this method was used to measure the dielectric properties of textile composites. The 

results of these characterizations can be found on Table 3-1. Furthermore, in [88] the authors 

present a variation of this method, based on an angular-invariant approach. Due the typical 

non-regular surface of the textiles and leathers, in this angular-invariant approach based on 

Rayleigh scattering, the authors have measured the scattering parameters of the antenna by 

varying the angle of the material under the test. All materials tested in this work have shown 

variations in the complex permittivity as a function of the different incidence angles, due to 

irregular thickness, surface roughness and texture of the materials. Also, the free-space 

method can be used to characterize the conductive textiles [87].

for low-loss materials [14], even though they only allow material characterization for a single

resonator method is based on the fact that the resonant frequency and quality factor of a 

dielectric resonator with given dimensions are determined by its permittivity and permeability. 

These methods are usually applied to measure low-loss dielectric materials. The resonance-

perturbation method is based on resonant perturbation theory. For a resonator with given 

electromagnetic boundaries, when part of the electromagnetic boundary condition is changed 

by introducing a sample, its resonant frequency and quality factor (Q-factor) will also change. 

Measuring these shifts in the frequency and in the Q-factor is possible to extract the 

permittivity value, as presented in [13]. The Q-factor [13] is a parameter often used to describe 

an electromagnetic material, according to equations (3-1), (3-2) and (3-3):

where Qe is the electric quality factor and Qm is the magnetic quality factor. Based on this, it 

is possible to calculate the total quality factor (Q) of the material:

3.3.1  Cavity Perturbation Methods 

The most common resonance techniques are those based on resonant cavities formed by a 

rectangular or circular waveguide. The material under test is inserted into the resonant cavity 

and their electromagnetic properties are calculated from the changes in the resonant frequency 

and in the quality factor of the cavity caused by the introduction of the material [13], [92]–

[94]. This phenomenon is illustrated on Figure 3-4 and the theoretical equations can be found 

in [13]. 

 
Figure 3-4  Cavity perturbation (a) original cavity (b) perturbed cavity after the material insertion. E1 
and H1 are the electric and magnetic fields, respectively; ?1 and µ1 are the permittivity and permeability 
of the cavity; Vc is the volume of the cavity; ?2 and µ2 are the permittivity and permeability of the  

material; and Vs is the volume of the sample 
 

 



 32 

These methods are difficult to apply as in every measurement the sample has to be placed in 

the same position. Figure 3-5 shows some examples of resonant cavities. Also, the cavity needs 

to be dismantled and reassembled every time a new sample is tested [13], consuming time and 

maybe introducing errors on the measurements. Moreover, the cavity resonator methods 

measure the permittivity in the plane of the sample and, therefore, cannot determine any 

anisotropy in the measured plane [14].  

 
Figure 3-5  Examples of resonant cavities: (a) circular resonator cavity (b) rectangular resonator cavity 

In [94], Kumar and Smith present the electromagnetic characterization of yarns and fabrics 

using a cylindrical split cavity resonator. In this work, the averaged result obtained for five 

yarns with different diameters, ?r = 3.1141, is compared to the averaged result for three fabrics 

made with these yarns ?r = 2.7851. As the textile materials are a mixture of nylon fibres and 

air, the authors concluded that fabrics exhibit higher porosity and, for this reason, a lower 

permittivity value than the yarns measured stand-alone.  

Furthermore, [90] presents the dielectric characterization of nine textiles, using a closed cavity 

resonator. The authors have measured the textiles in all planes (x, y and z). The obtained 

results showed the influence of different alignments of the material with the electromagnetic 

field. The anisotropy caused by the different density of yarns in the warp and weft directions 

is clearly seen. 

3.3.2  Microstrip Resonator Ring Method 

The microstrip resonator methods are based in the resonance-perturbation method.  The 

sample of the material under test is placed over the microstrip resonator affecting its resonant 

frequency and quality factor. Measuring the shift in the frequency and in the Q-factor enables 

to extract the permittivity values [13]. The microstrip resonator methods are subdivided into 

three types: straight ribbon resonator, ring resonator and circular resonator, as shown on Figure 

3-6. 



 33 

 
Figure 3-6  Types of microstrip resonators: (a) straight ribbon resonator (b) ring resonator and (c) circular 
resonator. Where: l is the length of straight ribbon resonator; r1 and r2 are the inner and outer radius of  

the resonator ring, respectively; and r is the radius of the circular resonator 
 

The microstrip ring resonator does not have open ends, decreasing the radiation loss and 

consequently increasing the quality factor. For this reason, the ring resonator is more accurate 

and sensitive than the straight and circular resonators. Details about the theoretical equations 

of microstrip resonator can be found in [13]. For the characterization of the textile materials, 

the procedure of the microstrip ring resonator method only involves attach the conductive 

parts, made of copper foil, to the textile dielectric probe under test. In [95],  the 

characterization of a “Bakhram” textile fabric at two different frequencies (831.940 MHz and 

1.6890 MHz) is presented. After the measurements, the permittivity and loss tangent extracted 

values were ?r = 2.031 and tan? = 0.0038, and ?r = 1.965 and tan? = 0.0024, respectively. To 

validate the method, the authors designed a textile patch antenna to resonate at 831.940 MHz, 

also made of copper foil in the conductive parts. Despite the deviation in the measured 

frequency, the authors considered the characterization method well suited for the 

characterization of textile materials, considering this deviation as part of the design and 

manufacturing process of the antenna.  

3.3.3  Microstrip Patch Sensor 

The microstrip patch sensor consists of a patch antenna covered with the dielectric material 

under test, called superstrate, as shown on Figure 3-7. As for the microstrip ring resonator 

method, this technique relies on the resonance-perturbation method, where the calculation of 

the permittivity value is based on the shift in frequency caused by the introduction of the 

superstrate. More information about theoretical equations can be found in [96]–[98]. 



 34 

 

Figure 3-7 Setup up of dielectric material covering a patch antenna  

In [97], this method is presented to measure solids and liquids. In [98], the method is used to 

test six nonwoven materials at 1.9 GHz. All tested nonwoven materials were manufactured by 

the stitching method and the results of their electromagnetic characterization are presented 

in Table 3-2. This non-destructive method can be a solution for a quick, easy and low-cost 

characterization procedure.  

3.3.4  Microstrip Resonator Patch Method 

In [20], Sankaralingam and Bhaskar proposed a novel microstrip patch radiator method, that 

consists in designing a patch antenna using an estimated permittivity value found by literature 

review. After manufacturing the antenna and measuring its S11, the real value of the dielectric 

constant is calculated based on the shift of the resonant frequency. Six different textile 

materials were characterized and the extracted values can be found in Table 3-2. To validate 

this method, the authors designed some textile antennas for 2.45 GHz, using three tested 

materials as a dielectric substrate, and copper sheets for the conductive parts. Despite that 

these antennas exhibit good results, confirming the suitability of this method, the results can 

be influenced by the manufacturing technique. Indeed, the use of an interface to assembly the 

layers, such as glue or an adhesive sheet, and the inaccuracies when soldering the SMA 

connector to the microstrip patch radiator, can introduce errors in the final values.  

3.3.5  Agilent 85070E Dielectric Measurement Probe Kit 

The Agilent 85070E Dielectric Measurement Probe Kit, is an equipment by Agilent Technologies, 

available on the market to measure the dielectric properties of several types of materials [99]. 

In [73], the characterisation of textile and leather was performed using the open-ended coaxial 

probe method. In this method, the permittivity value is calculated only from the S11 parameter 

from the coaxial probe, measured with the VNA or impedance analyser, as illustrated on Figure 

3-8. On the one side, the advantages of this method are: non-destructive technique, quick and 

easy to perform. On the other side, this method is very expensive (price of probe kit + software) 

and a complex calibration of the probe is required, using standard materials such as distilled 

water or methanol. 



 35 

Five types of leather were characterized at 2.45 GHz: (1) original cowhide, ?r = 1.76 and         

tan? = 0.0009, (2) original sheepskin ?r = 2.5 and tan? = 0.035, (3) oiled sheepskin ?r = 2.66 and 

tan? = 0.085, (4) scratched cowhide ?r = 3.13 and tan? = 0.15, and (5) oiled cowhide ?r = 2.3 

and tan? = 0.04. Among the characterized leathers, considering the operating frequency, 

leather (2) was chosen to develop a dual-band wearable antenna for 2.45 GHz and 4.5 GHz 

applications. Due to the structure of five-layered substrate, the simulated and measured results 

deviate. For this reason, the authors included a new simulation using four air gaps of 0.0875 

mm thickness to correct the results. The size of the air gaps was obtained through the 

difference between the simulated substrate thickness (3.5 mm) and the measured thickness of 

the final substrate (3.85 mm). The gain and the radiation efficiency at the lower frequency 

(2.49 GHz) are -0.29 dBi and 15.2%, respectively; and at the higher frequency (4.52 GHz) 3.05 

dBi and 41.4%, respectively.  

In [100] a denim fabric was characterized using the open-ended coaxial probe method, as well. 

The denim fabric, with 1.6 mm of thickness, was show ?r = 1.7 and tan? = 0.085; and was used 

as dielectric substrate for a slotted antenna for RF energy harvesting between 2.22 – 2.59 GHz.

3.4 Conclusions 
This Chapter has presented a review of the methods to characterize the dielectric properties 

of textile materials, to be used as dielectric substrates of wearable antennas and systems. Also, 

this Chapter summarizes the characterization of textile materials made through these methods 

and that were validated by testing antennas which perform well.   

The resonant and non-resonant techniques were presented. Despite the resonant techniques 

only characterize the material in a single frequency, generally, the resonant methods provide 

higher accuracy and sensitivity than non-resonant methods for low-loss materials. In this review 

all methods have shown good results and have characterized textile materials, which are 

summarized on Table 3-1 and Table 3-2, that are suitable for use as dielectric substrate in 

antennas. Table 3-3 summarizes the presented methods and describes their advantages and 

drawbacks.

Resonator-Based Experimental Technique: Method 

and Analysis 

 

The content of this Chapter was partially submitted to the Textile Research Journal (June of 

2017) and published on the IEEE International Microwave Workshop Series on Advanced 

Materials and Process (2017), and as Chapter of the Book Wearable Technologies and Wireless 

Body Sensor Networks for Healthcare (2017). Also, was presented in The Fiber Society 

Conference (2016 and 2017) - the paper presented in 2017, received the 3rd place in The Fiber 

Society Graduate Student Paper Competition. The experimental research presented in this 

Chapter was developed during the Short Term Scientific Mission (STSM), in the framework of 

the European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) – Project IC 1301 – Wireless Power 

Transmission for Sustainable Electronics (WIPE), held on the Department of Information 

Technology of Ghent University (Belgium), under the supervision of Prof. PhD. Hendrik Rogier.  

The knowledge of the electromagnetic properties of the textile materials is crucial to design 

wearable antennas. Despite the increase of research studies on textile antennas, the accurate 

characterization of the dielectric properties of textile materials is still a challenge due to the 

intrinsic inhomogeneity and deformability of textiles. In this Chapter, the Resonator-Based 

Experimental Technique is presented. This method is based on the theory of resonance-

perturbation, extracting the permittivity and loss tangent values based on the shifts caused 

by the introduction of a superstrate on the patch of a microstrip antenna. The results obtained 

using this method have shown that when positioning the roughest face of the MUT in contact 

with the resonator board, the extracted dielectric constant value is lower than the one 

extracted with this face positioned upside-down. Based on this observation, superficial 

properties of textiles were investigated. Thus, this paper relates the results of the dielectric 

characterization to some structural parameters of textiles, such as surface roughness, 

superficial and bulk porosities. The results show that both roughness and superficial porosity 

of the samples influence the measurements, through the positioning of the probes. Further, 

the influence of the positioning of the dielectric material on the performance of textile 

microstrip antennas was analysed. For this, twelve prototypes of microstrip patch antennas 

were developed and tested. The results show that, despite the differences obtained on the 

characterization when placing the face or reverse-sides of the MUT in contact with the 



 40 

resonator board, the obtained average result of ?r is well suited to design antennas ensuring 

a good performance.  

 

4.1 Introduction 
To alleviate the problems and complexity of the sample preparation, the influence of the 

conductive material and the expensive equipment required in the methods described on 

Chapter 3, an experimental resonator-based technique was developed. It is based on the 

resonance-perturbation theory, based on similar principles as the microstrip patch sensor 

technique presented in 3.3.3. However, the method outlined on this Section relies on full-wave 

simulators rather than approximating formulas for the extraction of the electromagnetic 

properties of the MUT, thus yielding an overall higher accuracy. More specifically, it consists in 

computing the electromagnetic parameters of the MUT by comparing the simulated and 

measured shifts in the resonance frequency and in the value of Q-factor of a microstrip patch 

antenna. These shifts are caused by the introduction of a superstrate on the patch that is the 

material under study, MUT.  

Indeed, the presence of the superstrate will change the characteristics of the antenna, such as 

resonance frequency, as shown on Figure 4-1. This shift in the frequency (fr1 – fr2) is caused by 

the difference of the electromagnetic wavelength of the uncovered antenna, simulated during 

the design process, and the measured antenna covered by a dielectric material of unknown ?r. 

The amplitude of the frequency shift depends on the ?r and on the thickness of the covering 

material. 

 

Figure 4-1 Measurement results from the patch antenna stand-alone and after the introduction of 
superstrate 

The test equipment consists of a board on which a microstrip patch antenna is implemented 

and in a vector network analyser to perform the measurements. The antenna is designed to 

operate at 2.25 GHz, thus in the proximity of the 2.45 GHz, ISM frequency band, which is 

paramount for wearable systems. The antenna is realized on a rigid I-Tera MT40 high-frequency 



 41 

laminate, with ?r = 3.56, tan? = 0.0035 and thickness h = 0.508 mm, whereas the patch is etched 

in a copper layer with a thickness of 35 µm. It is fed by a coaxial line through the SMA connector, 

with 50? of impedance. The designed antenna is shown on Figure 4-2 and its dimensions are 

given on Table 4-1. Also, the measurement set-up of the resonator-based experimental 

technique is illustrated on Figure 4-3. To stabilise the planar geometry of the MUT and avoid 

large air gaps between the MUT and the microstrip patch antenna of the resonator board, a 

block of Styrofoam was placed over the MUT. All dielectric measurements were performed in

4.1.1  Experimental Procedure 

In order to extract the ?r and tan? of the textile fabric under test, the following procedure is 

carried out: 

1. Prepare the textile samples, cutting a square 10x10 cm2 (or sized enough to cover all the 

patch of the antenna) from the selvedge of the fabric and numerating its sides clockwise, 

as shown on Figure 4-4;  

2. Calibrate the VNA in the frequency range of interest by using the electronic calibration 

module; 

3. Connect the microstrip patch antenna to the VNA; 

4. Measure the S11 parameter of the antenna;  

5. Save the data; 

6. Put the textile sample on the resonator board and mark the board in order to place future 

samples in the exact same place;  

7. Measure again the S11 parameter of the antenna, this time with the textile sample on the 

patch; 

8. Save the data; 

9. Repeat the previous steps (6, 7 and 8) four times by positioning the substrate sample such 

that each time one different side is aligned with the microstrip feed of the antenna. Then, 

repeat the complete procedure by turning the sample upside-down. As a result, a total 

number of 8 measurements is acquired (2 faces x 4 positions); 

10. Finally, by leveraging full-wave simulations of the antenna, extract the ?r and tan? of the 

material under test by fitting the measured shift (fr1 – fr2) in the antenna’s resonance 

frequency and the measured variation in the Q-factor to the simulates ones, respectively.

The most advantageous feature of this experimental method is that it does not require 

sophisticated equipment, so it is fast and simple to apply. Moreover, in contrast to some of the 

aforementioned techniques, this method is non-destructive. As such, the MUT is not modified 

during the characterization process, thus yielding values of the permittivity and loss tangent 



 43 

that are not influenced by the glue, the conductive material or the manufacturing of the 

measured structures. 

4.1.2  Results 

In order to study general relationships between the structure and the dielectric properties, 

eleven fabrics which vary in terms of composition, porosity and structure were analysed. More 

specifically, two samples of each material were characterized according to the procedure 

outlined in 4.1.1. All these fabrics are deliberately composed of synthetic fibres, aiming a low 

interaction with moisture, minimizing its effect on the electromagnetic performance of the 

materials. Table 4-2 presents the structural features of the studied fabrics.  

The thickness of the samples was measured using the KES-F – 3 Compressional Tester of 

Kawabata’s Evaluation System for Fabrics, presented on Figure 4-5, under controlled 

environment conditions of 25ºC and 65% of RH, on Department of Textile Science and 

Technology (DCTT) at Universidade da Beira Interior. In this method the specimen is compressed 

by two circular-plates of steel having 2 cm2 area. The velocity of the compression is 50 sec/mm 

and when the pressure attains 50 g/cm2, the recovery process proceeds at the same velocity 

[35].

In resonator methods, such as the experimental technique presented here, the superficial 

roughness of the material may introduce some inaccuracies in the results due to the air gap 

between the sample and the resonator board. Figure 4-6 presents the extracted dielectric 

constants obtained by positioning the sample with each of the two faces contacting the board. 

We notice that the permittivity values vary according to the position of the sample on the 

patch. In particular, the largest variation is observed for the coated textiles. Even though the 

presence of this air gap can be accounted for during the characterization process, it is 



 45 

important to analyse the superficial properties of the material in order to understand whether 

the results are correct and the material is compatible with this kind of characterization 

method.

sides in contact with the resonator board 

4.2 Surface Characterization Method  
The influence of the surface parameters, such as superficial roughness and porosity, on the 

dielectric behaviour of the textiles have never been studied. Due to the results presented on 

Figure 4-6, detailed investigation of the influence of the surface parameters of the 

characterized textile was performed on this Subsection, in order to understand how these 

parameters can affect the performance of textile antennas. 

4.2.1  Surface Roughness 

The surfaces of the textile materials were characterized by measuring the superficial geometric 

roughness (SMD) with KES-F – 4 Surface Tester of Kawabata’s Evaluation System for Fabrics, see 

Figure 4-7. The SMD is measured by pulling a U-shaped steel wire with 0.5 mm diameter through 

the fabric length under a normal force of 10 gf. In this way, a height profile of the fabric along 

its length is obtained. The standard mean deviation of this height profile is considered as 

surface roughness and is called geometric roughness [35]. This test was carried out in both the 

warp and the weft directions (5 measurements per each direction), for both face- and reverse-

sides of the sample (20 measurements in total). The average value of these measurements is 

presented on Table 4-4. All measurements were performed under controlled environment 

conditions of 25ºC and 65% of relative humidity, on DCTT at Universidade da Beira Interior.

Tests – DCTT, UBI) 

4.2.2  Superficial Porosity 

The superficial porosity (Øsup) was measured through image analysis using the DiameterJ tool 

[101], of the ImageJ software image analyser [102]. To obtain the superficial pores data, the 

first step was to take pictures of the textiles’ surface, in a random area, with an optical 

microscope Nikon Eclipse LV1005. The images were taken using lenses of 5X magnitude for the 

3D fabrics and 12X magnitude for the Neoprene, Cordura® and Fake Leather fabrics. The same 

amount of contrast and brightness was used in all pictures.  

Using ImageJ software all images were converted to 8-bit greyscale level images. Then, the 

images were segmented in a binary image6 using algorithms and thresholding tools of 

DiameterJ. In this method, the fibre components were converted into white colour and the 

pores became black.  

After the segmentation process, some white pixels could still remain in the pores areas. In this 

case, the morphological noise was removed using the binary commands – erode and dilate - of 

the ImageJ. The images were thus refined, eliminating the isolated pixel areas and highlighting 

the fibre edges.     

Thereafter, the segmented image was analysed through the DiameterJ tool which gives the 

percentage of porosity as the ratio of the total number of black pixels to the total pixels in the 

image. The DiameterJ also gives the total number of pores found in the image. Figure 4-8 

illustrates the image analysis process, and the obtained results are shown on Table 4-4.

that is the image will only have black and white pixels, using the thresholding techniques.

As shown on Table 4-4, the surface features of the MUT may significantly influence the results 

obtained with the resonator-based experimental technique of dielectric characterization. 

Analysing the ?r values on Table 4-4, one may verify that the dielectric constant extracted when 

placing the rougher face turning down contacting the resonator board presents a lower value. 

This is observed for all samples. Indeed, when positioning the rougher face in contact with the 

board more air is trapped on the interface between the MUT and the resonator board, lowering 

the measured value of ?r.  

Several structural parameters, such as stitch density and loop length, can influence the 

differences on the roughness of face and reverse sides of the textile materials. These features 

may be represented by the superficial roughness and porosity. Also, as one may observe on 

Table 4-4, the faces that have higher roughness SMD also have the higher number of superficial 

pores per cm2. This fact corroborates that, as expected, a higher number of superficial pores 

is related to a higher value of the surface roughness. Accordingly, positioning the faces with 

higher number of pores in contact with the board lowers the measured permittivity values. 

Considering all 176 ?r measurements (8 measurements per probe, 2 probes per material and 11 

materials) and plotting these data against the number of superficial pores per cm2 of each face 

of the materials, an logarithmical regression is found, with R2 = 0.97574, as shown on Figure 

4-9.  

 



 49 

 
Figure 4-9 Relative dielectric constant vs Pores per cm2 (logarithmical regression) 

This means the dielectric constant value exponentially decreases with the increase of number 

of pores per cm2, due to the presence of the air on the textile surface. Furthermore, the 

relative difference, ?, of ?r and Øsup among faces of the textile was calculated by (4-3), 

expressed in %: 

?	=	(jklO	*)jklO	+)
jklO	+

? 100                                                     (4-3) 

where: side 1 is the face with higher value and side 2 is the face with lower value. 

The results are plotted on Figure 4-10. A linear regression describes very well the relationship 

between the relative differences of ?r and Øsup, with R
2 = 0.99146 as shown on Figure 4-10. 

 
Figure 4-10 Relative difference of dielectric constant vs relative difference of superficial porosity 

(linear regression) 

As presented on Figure 4-10, the largest relative difference between the ?r of the face- and of 

the reverse-sides is observed for the coated textiles (Fake Leather I – 33.87 % and II – 34.42%). 

The 3D fabrics IV and II presented the lowest relative difference (0% and 2.78%, respectively). 

Coherently, these textiles also present the largest (Fake Leather I – 2019% and II – 2130%) and 

lowest (3D fabric IV – 10.56% and II – 11.30%) difference of superficial porosity among faces.

Where: m is the mass per unit surface (g/m2) and h is the thickness of the fabric (m). The 

results of the calculated bulk porosity of textiles are shown on Table 4-5.

Fake Leather II PES = 1380 | PU = 1150 446.370 67.00 

 

The results of bulk porosity also were analysed Plotting the 176 ?r measurements against the 

bulk porosity results, a linear regression describes well the relationship between ?r and Ø, with 

R2 = 0.97169 as shown on Figure 4-11.   

 
Figure 4-11 Relative dielectric constant vs bulk porosity (linear regression) 



 51 

This is an expected result, as higher values of bulk porosity mean higher percentage of air into 

the fabric structure, lowering the dielectric constant of the fabric as air presents ?r ?1.  

4.4 Significance of the Dielectric Results on the Design 
of Microstrip Patch Antennas  

In order to analyse the impact of the differences of the ?r values on the performance of textile 

antennas, six microstrip textile antennas were designed using the CST Microwave Studio 2016 

full-wave simulator. All antennas were designed to resonate at 2.25 GHz, the same frequency 

used on the electromagnetic characterization procedure. Indeed, if the positioning of the MUT, 

placing the face or reverse-side in contact with the resonator board, leads to differences in the 

measured results of ?r, it is important to verify the significance of these differences when 

manufacturing the microstrip antenna, when placing the patch in one or other face. 

The antennas were manufactured using a commercial e-textile (Pure copper polyester taffeta 

fabric, Less EMF Inc., USA), with Rs = 0.05 ?/? and thickness equal to 0.080 mm, for the patch 
and the ground plane.  

For the dielectric substrate, six diverse fabrics were considered, chosen among the previously 

characterized ones. The antennas were designed using the ?r averaged value,	shown on Table 

4-3. For each substrate, two antennas were produced placing the patch on the face and on the 

reverse-side, respectively, as shown on Figure 4-12. The specification of these antennas is 

reported on Table 4-6.

To ensure the geometric accuracy of the radiating element, a square patch was deliberated 

designed. All patches were cut with a laser cutting machine (LC6090C CCD, from Jinan G. Weike 

Science &amp;amp; Technology Co. Ltd., Jinan, China), on Department of Aerospace Science at 

Universidade da Beira Interior. The prototypes were produced by assembling the components 

with a thermal adhesive sheet I, and feed by SMA connector, with 50 ? of impedance. After the 

construction, all prototypes were tested measuring the S11, between 2 and 3 GHz, using a VNA, 

at Instituto de Telecomunicações – Aveiro. Figure 4-13 shows the comparison between the 

simulated and measured return loss.

The prototype 1 has shown the best result resonating at the proposed frequency (2.25 GHz). 

Also, the measured bandwidth matches with the simulated (2.22 – 2.29 GHz) on both cases – 

when the patch is placed on the face (2.21 – 2.29 GHz) and on the reverse-side (2.20 – 2.29 

GHz). Looking at the results of prototype 2, despite the small shift on the bandwidth, both 

measured antennas are resonating on 2.24 GHz, showing good agreement with the simulated 

values. It is important to notice that these small shifts may be caused by the manual 

manufacturing process.  

Prototypes 3 and 4 have shown a larger shift on the resonant frequency. In fact, the neoprene 

is highly deformable and when heat was applied to assemble the conductive parts the neoprene 

has shrunk, reducing the thickness of both antennas in 1.5 mm. Despite this, the prototypes 3 

and 4 still present an acceptable result, as one can see on Table 4-7, the resonate frequency 

still close to the simulated one. 

The prototypes 5 and 6, whose dielectric substrates are fake leather fabrics, show the biggest 

difference of performances when positioning the patch in the face or reverse - side of the 

substrate. The resonant frequency of the prototypes whose patch was placed on the face-side, 

the less rough one, was shifted to a lower frequency (2.17 – 2.23  and 2.20 – 2.26 , respectively 

for antennas 5 and 6), proving that the substrate positioned this way presents a higher ?r then 

the values considered on simulation, as expected. Similarly, in prototypes whose patch was 

placed in the reverse-side, the roughest one, the S11 was shifted to a higher frequency (2.23 – 

2.28 and 2.27 – 2.33 GHz, respectively for antennas 5 and 6), that the substrate positioned this 

way has a lower ?r than the value used on the simulation process. This is explained by the fact 

the bandwidth of the microstrip patch antenna is inversely proportional to the square root of 

the dielectric constant of the substrate [8], [32] .  

In summary, prototypes 1, 2, 3 and 4, present a quite similar behaviour when placing the patch 

on the face or reverse- sides of the substrate. Indeed, as previously shown on Figure 4-6, the 

3D and the neoprene fabrics used as substrate in these prototypes present low differences of 

the measured values of ?r when placing the face or reverse-sides in contact to the resonator-

board (less than 4.6%). On the contrary, prototypes 5 and 6 show different performance when 

placing the patch in one or other faces of the substrate as expected considering the higher 



 54 

difference of values of ?r (around 34%) measured placing the substrate in one and other 

positions, as previously presented on Figure 4-6. Despite these differences, prototypes 5 and 6 

perform reasonably well, as the resonant frequency is close to the simulated one, as presented 

on Table 4-7.  

Therefore, one may conclude that, despite the observed differences in results obtained for 

different positioning of the dielectric substrate, the average value of ?r characterizes well the 

material and ensures a reliable performance of the textile antennas. Thus, the average value 

of ?r measured by the resonator-based experimental technique is suitable to be considered for 

the design of microstrip patch antennas. 

As one can see on Table 4-7, for all tested prototypes the measured resonance frequency was 

quite close to the simulated one. For samples presenting even larger structural differences 

between faces, the precision of the resonant frequency might be improved by adjusting the 

dielectric constant value by adding or subtracting the standard deviation value. Therefore, if 

the patch is placed over the roughest face, the ?r is adjusted by subtracting the standard 

deviation to the measured averaged value of ?r; and the other way around. 

4.5 Conclusions 

The new Resonator-Based Experimental Technique was introduced to characterise several 

textile fabrics of interest. This method is based on the theory of resonance-perturbation, which 

consists in computing the electromagnetic parameters of the material under test, at a single 

frequency (2.25 GHz), by measuring the shift in the resonance frequency and in the value of 

the Q-factor of a microstrip patch antenna.  

In general, the resonant methods yield higher accuracy than non-resonant ones and do not 

require complex sample preparation. Another advantage of the method is that it is only applied 

to the antenna substrate. Therefore, the procedure is not affected by arbitrary effects, such 

as, for example, the type of glue/adhesive sheet, the connector and the manufacturing 

technique of the probe, which can lead to the non-repeatability of the measurements and 

introduce variations in the final values.  

The air-fibre mixture content on fabrics leads to a heterogeneous characterization process. In 

this work the studied materials showing higher bulk porosity also show lower dielectric constant 

values, which is due to the higher amount of air inside the fabric structure. The presented 

results corroborate that roughness correlates well with the number of pores on the surface: the 

textiles that present higher number of pores on the surface, also show higher SMD values. 

Furthermore, when characterizing fabrics with the resonator-based experimental technique, 

placing the faces of higher SMD in contact with the resonator board results in  lower values of 

?r. Also, it is reported that the ?r exponentially decreases with the superficial porosity increase. 



 55 

Both of these facts occur because of the presence of the air on the surface, trapped in the 

superficial pores.   

Besides the measured values of the dielectric constant differ when placing the face or reverse-

sides in contact to the resonator board, and are thus influenced by the structure of the surface 

of the fabrics, this does not seem not be significant for the development of textile antennas. 

When designing microstrip patch antennas, the average of ?r is well suited to ensure a reliable 

performance of the antenna.

Textile Antenna for RF Energy Harvesting 

 

The content of this chapter was partially published on IEEE International Symposium on 

Antennas and Propagation (2013), 24th IEEE Annual International Symposium on Personal, 

Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (2013), 7th International Symposium on Medical 

Information and Communication Technology (2014), 21th International Conference on 

Telecommunications (2104) and 5th STS Italia Conference?A Matter of Design: Making Society 

through Science and Technology. The paper presented in this last conference was chosen as 

one of the ten best papers by young researchers and was awarded with a grant.  

The Internet of Things (IoT) scenario is strongly related with the advance of the development 

of Wireless Body Sensor Network (WBSN) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems. 

Additionally, in the WBSN context, the integration of textile antennas for energy harvesting 

into smart clothing is a particularly interesting solution for a continuous wirelessly feed. 

Indeed, in the context of wearable devices the replacement of batteries is not easy to practice. 

This chapter describes the concept of the energy harvesting and presents a survey of textile 

antennas for RF energy harvesting. A dual-band printed monopole textile antenna for 

electromagnetic energy harvesting, operating at GSM 900 and DCS 1800 bands, is also proposed. 

The presented printed monopole antenna was developed in the framework of the PROENERGY 

PROJECT - Prototypes for Efficient Energy Self-Sustainable Wireless Sensor Networks, 

reference PTDC/EEA-TEL/122681/2010. The antenna aims to harvest energy to feed sensor 

nodes of a wearable health monitoring system. The gains of the antenna are around 1.8 dBi 

and 2.06 dBi allied with a radiation efficiency of 82% and 77.6% for the lowest and highest 

frequency bands, respectively. 

 

5.1 Introduction 
 Nowadays, the socio-economic development and lifestyle trends indicate an increasing 

consumption of technological products and processes. The IoT scenario boosts the concept of 

wearable systems, as for instance health-monitoring systems ones [4], [103], [104]. The 

development of smart objects for IoT applications, include the capacity of identification of 

these objects in order to communicate and to interact with [4].  



 58 

In this context, wearable technology has been addressed to make the person, mainly through 

his clothes, able to communicate with, and be part of, this technological network [105]. For 

instance, the wearable health-monitoring systems are not only endowed with sensing, 

processing, actuation and communication abilities, but also with energy harvesting and storage 

applications, emerging as a solution to the challenges of ubiquitous monitoring of people in 

several contexts.  

The integration of WBSN on clothing puts the question about how to feed them. The batteries 

are an obvious choice, but they are bulky, require frequent replacement or recharging, and 

their short longevity is an ecological concern of current times. In this framework, the need for 

battery-free systems is increasing dramatically. Therefore, textile antennas for energy 

harvesting, emerge as a particularly interesting solution when the replacement of batteries is 

not easy to practice, such as in embedded systems.  

Energy harvesting, or power scavenging, is the process of extracting energy from the surround 

environment and converting it into consumable electrical energy [106]. There are several 

sources of energy that can be harvested, such as acoustic, wind, solar, wave, mechanical and 

thermal.  

Nowadays, RF energy is currently broadcasted from billions of radio transmitters and, thus, can 

be collected from the ambient environment or from dedicated sources [107]. Additionally, RF 

transmitters and receivers can be used when other potential intermittent energy scavenging 

sources (e.g., vibration and heat) are not available.  

These radio waves present a widely available source of energy if effectively and efficiently 

harvested. Therefore, electromagnetic energy harvesting (EEH) holds a promising future for 

power supply of wearable low-power devices, offering a unique solution, enable for the 

implementation of a battery-free wireless sensing solution for 24 hours.  

According to [108], there are two basic approaches, that will depend on the environmental 

condition, to harvest the electromagnetic energy: 

1. Ambient source: in this approach, the harvester system uses the electromagnetic waves 

already present in the environment, such as solar [65], artificial light [109], or both [110], 

[111]. Also, can use the random RF sources, prevenient from telecommunication systems, 

like Wi-Fi hotspots [112] and cell phone signals [113], [114], available specially in highly 

populate areas.  

2. Dedicated source: in this approach, the harvester system is designed for a known RF source. 

This method can be more advantageous due to the previous knowledge about the RF source, 

that includes the frequency, directionality and polarization, as occur in the case of Wireless 

Power Transmission (WPT) [115]. 

This means, whereas in EEH the concept is harvesting the electromagnetic waves from the air, 

in WPT the electromagnetic beams are clearly directed in the direction of the device to power 

up, both of them working on far-field region [116]. 



 59 

Nevertheless, in the WPT context, there are other methods of transmitting energy wirelessly, 

working on near-field region, such as inductive coupling and magnetic resonance coupling [115], 

[117]. Also, it is possible to combine energy harvesting with wireless power transmission 

techniques, as presented in [108], [116]. This PhD Thesis will only focus on the electromagnetic 

energy harvesting, working on far-field region. The application, the range and field region from 

each wireless power transmission technique are described on Table 5-1.

Considering the recent advances in the wireless energy transfer technologies, not limited to 

the WSN and WBAN, in the near future, smart cities will be fully covered by small stations of 

dedicated sources, to wirelessly power wearable devices, such as augmented reality glasses 

and wellness devices [118]. 

5.2 Review of Textile Antennas for RF Energy Harvesting 

The state-of-art of textile antennas for RF energy harvesting was based in search criteria that 

included 6 combinations of index terms, presented on Table 5-2, inquiring three main 

databases:  

1. Scopus®: The largest interdisciplinary database across science, mathematics, technology, 

engineering, health and medicine, social science and humanities. The database includes

 60 

The search was restricted to the combination of the index terms in the title, abstract and

Scopus®, ISI® and IEEE Xplore®, respectively. After excluding the papers that use rigid antennas 

or rigid materials, and eliminating the repeated works, a group of 20 papers remained. In this 

group, only papers using textile materials for both, conductive and dielectric parts and used 

for far-field RF energy harvesting were considered. In the following section, 12 works will be 

briefly described.  The others 8 papers are related to the work developed in the framework of 

PROENERGY PROJECT - Prototypes for Efficient Energy Self-Sustainable Wireless Sensor 

Networks, reference PTDC/EEA-TEL/122681/2010. Therefore, will be partially described on the 

next Subsections and on Chapters 6 and 7. Table 5-2 presents the index terms used in the search

Besides EEH and WPT, using rigid antennas, are nowadays hot research topics [106], [115], 

[117], [134], the development of textile antennas for wearable systems is a very new subject, 

that has emerged only in the past decade.  

Some harvester systems that convert the received RF energy from ambient sources into DC 

power were called rectifying antennas, it is also known as rectennas. As explained in [135], the 

antenna performs the transduction of the RF energy into an electrical AC signal. A matching 

network is used to transfer a maximum AC power to the rectifier. Then, the rectifier converts 

the AC signal into a DC voltage, charging a load. In 2010, [130] Constanzo et al. presented the 



 61 

first scheme of a triple-band ring textile rectenna for RF energy harvesting, operating at GSM 

900, GSM 1800, and Wi-Fi frequencies.  

This antenna was developed with a multilayer configuration and for its conductive parts the 

Global EMC shielding fabric with sheet resistance of 0.02 ?/? was used. An unspecified fabric 

with ?r = 1.23 was used as a substrate support of the antenna. The Kapton
® fabric with ?r = 3.4, 

tan? = 0.002 and 1 mm of thickness, was used as the dielectric substrate. The predicted antenna 

efficiencies of this antenna are 61% at 900 MHz, 54% at 1.750 MHz, and 85% at 2.450 MHz. The 

integration of this triple-band ring textile rectenna, in a fully-autonomous RF energy 

harvesting, was further presented in [122], [124]. Later, the authors present the first scheme 

of a jacket, integrating this antenna into a harvester circuit  [113], [125], [129]. 

In 2013, a circular patch slotted textile antenna was proposed for RF energy harvesting, 

operating at 2.45 GHz [100]. A denim fabric, with 1.6 mm of thickness, ?r = 1.7 and                    

tan? = 0.085, was used as dielectric substrate. This study investigated the performance of the 

antenna under bending conditions. The authors observed that when the antenna have small 

bending radius, major changes on the gain and radiation pattern of the antenna will occur. For 

example, in the normal state (no bending applied) the antenna shows a gain of 7.34 dBi, while 

under bending conditions (R = 20mm), the maximum gain obtained was 7.10 dBi. 

Later, in 2014, Tallos et al. presented the draft of a coat with multiple body-worn embroidered 

textile antennas, to be integrated into a harvester system operating in the 2.45 GHz WLAN band 

[112]. This study has shown that body-worn textile antennas with rectifying circuits can supply 

enough power to feed low-power sensors. 

In 2015, Adami et al. presented a textile patch antenna and a rectenna for 2.45 GHz RF power 

transfer and harvesting, to feed low-power sensors on clothing [79]. In both cases, a fabric 

composed of polyester abd cotton (35% PES 65% CO) was used as dielectric substrate, having    

?r = 3.23 and tan? = 0.06. For the conductive parts, silver ink – Dupont 500 was applied, through 

the screen printing technique. Both, patch antenna and rectenna, were replicated using RF-4 

as dielectric substrate, in order to compare the efficiency.  

The textile patch antenna showed 11% of radiation efficiency against 30% efficiency of antenna 

made of RF-4. The authors indicate that the difference on the radiation efficiency is correlated 

to the dielectric losses of the substrates, as the fabric presents tan? = 0.06 and RF-4 presents 

tan? = 0.0175. Furthermore, the rectennas were tested varying the power source. For the 

highest power source used, the textile rectenna was capable to generates 100 µW. In 

comparison, the RF-4 rectenna generated 230 µW, being this difference coherent with the 

discrepancy in the radiation efficiency previously measured.   

In 2016, a broadband spiral textile rectenna was presented and integrated on a RF energy 

harvesting system [119]. The designed system operates over a frequency range from 0.9 GHz 

to 4 GHz. In order to improve results, four different combinations of materials for the dielectric 

substrate and conductive parts, were proposed: (A) felt (?r = 1.14 and h = 5 mm) and Shieldit 



 62 

Super® (? = 1.96x105 S/m), (B) fleece (?r = 1.17 and h = 3 mm) and Shieldit Super
® (? = 1.96x105 

S/m), (C) felt (?r = 1.14 and h = 5 mm) and stainless steel conductive yarns (? = 3.88x10
4 S/m). 

Also, a rigid antenna (C) FR-4 (?r = 4.3 and h = 1.5 mm) and copper (? = 5.96x10
7 S/m), was 

made in order be the reference antenna to which compare the efficiency of the textile ones. 

All antennas worked well, resonating at frequencies very close to the simulated ones. Moreover, 

antenna A shows the best result. Antenna B has a small shift in the resonance frequency due to 

the presence of air gaps between the fleece layer, while antenna C shows the higher shift 

because the improper attachment of the conductive yarns. Also, the measurements show that 

the spiral textile antenna A substrate had a higher fractional bandwidth in comparison with B. 

The harvester system was tested in two different indoor and outdoor scenarios, measuring 1.5 

V and 0.5 V, respectively. The efficiency of the wearable system was around 30%. 

Recently, in 2017, Ivši et al. have shown a spiral wideband textile antenna for RF energy 

harvesting, operating between 470 MHz up to 8 GHz, and a rectifier circuit to wirelessly feed 

on-body sensors [132]. To ensure the flexibility of the antenna, aiming the integration into 

cloth, the spiral antenna was embroidered with conductive yarns, using a denim fabric as 

dielectric substrate. This antenna was capable to cover all frequency ranges of interest – digital 

television, GSM and Wi-Fi. The measured gain was 1 dBi. 

5.3 Spectrum Opportunities  

The advance of technology stimulates the growing number of wireless transmitters, especially 

in highly populated urban areas, naturally increasing the power density of available RF in the 

environment. In order to identify the most promising frequencies for harvesting, measurements 

of the electromagnetic spectrum availability from 350 MHz to 3 GHz were performed, in the 

scope of the PROENERGY PROJECT – PTDC/EEA-TEL/122681/2010 and as reported in [121], 

[123].  

The field trials were performed using the NARDA- SMR spectrum analyser with measuring 

antenna, and the Signal Hound spectrum analyser. By analysing the power density 

measurements in 40 different indoor/outdoor locations in Covilhã and Lisbon, was possible to 

identify the best opportunities that may be considered to conceive wideband or multiband 

antennas for electromagnetic energy harvesting. Figure 5-1 presents the locations of the  

measurements performed in Covilhã, and the average result of all measurements results is 

depicted on Figure 5-2.

Observing the Figure 5-2, the sets of frequency bands with more available energy are:  

• 390 to 392 MHz – Emergency broadcast stations; 

• 750 to 759 MHz – Television broadcast stations;? 

• 934 to 960 MHz – GSM 900; 

• 1.763 to 1.773 MHz – GSM 1800; 

• 1.854 to 1.892 MHz – GSM 1800; 

• 2.115 to 2.160 MHz – Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS); 

• 2.359 MHz – Amateur, Services Ancillary to Broadcast / Services Ancillary to Programme 

(SAP/SAB) applications;  

• 2.404 to 2.468 MHz – Wi-Fi.

5.4 Printed Monopole Textile Antenna 

Based on the previous analysis, it is possible to conclude that the best set of frequency bands 

for energy harvesting is the mobile phone bands. Therefore, a dual-band printed monopole 

textile antenna to harvest in the GSM 900 and DCS 1800 bands was proposed.  

The simulation of this antenna was made using CST Microwave Studio, using textile materials 

commercially available. For the dielectric substrate, a synthetic fabric (100% high tenacity PA 

6.6), Cordura® (B. W. Wernerfelt Group, Søborg, Danmark), was chosen, as it is geometrically 

stable, presenting very low mechanical deformation. It also has low regain and minimizes the 

effect of the moisture absorption on lowering the resonance frequency of the antenna [128]. 

For the conductive parts, Zelt® (Less EMF Inc., Latham, USA) was considered. Table 5-3 

describes the properties of the used textile materials.

Figure 5-4 Simulated radiation pattern for the proposed printed monopole, YZ plane (dashed) and XZ 
plane (solid), for (a) 900 MHz and for (b)1800 MHz 

As one can see on Figure 5-4 radiation pattern of this antenna is clearly omnidirectional. An 

omnidirectional radiation, was chosen as the privileged direction of signal reception is 

unknown. The obtained gain, from numerical simulation, for the dual band antenna, is about 

1.8 dBi and 2.06 dBi allied with 82% and 77.6% radiation efficiencies for the GSM 900 and DCS 

1800 frequency bands, respectively.  

Further, the printed monopole textile antenna was produced assembling the components with 

a thermal adhesive sheet (Fixorete Losango, JAU Têxteis, Serzedo, Portugal). Figure 5-3 shows 

the textile antenna after assemblage. The antenna is fed by a SMA connector, with 50 ? of 

impedance. The return loss, presented in Figure 5-6, was measured using VNA at Instituto de 

Telecomunicações – Aveiro.

Figure 5-6 Simulated and measured S11 of the dual-band printed monopole 

One may observe that this textile antenna presents an operating frequency range capable of 

completely covering the GSM 900 (880-960 MHz) and the DCS 1800 (1710-1880 MHz). Also, 

observing the S11 on Figure 5-6 some small differences between the simulated and the measured 

values are expected due to imprecisions related with the manual manufacturing process.  

As presented on Subsection 5.1, it is possible to harvest RF electromagnetic energy from 

multiple sources. References [121], [126], [131] presents the fully integration of this printed 

monopole textile antenna in a harvester system. In summary, a five-stage Dickson voltage 

multiplier enables perpetual operation of an IRIS mote by a received RF power larger than 1 

dBm. In addition, a TX91501 Powercast® RF transmitter was applied as dedicated source, 

providing a predictable and reliable RF energy power source to wirelessly charge battery-based 



 67 

systems. With this system it was possible to charge sensor nodes up to 3 meters from the 

dedicated source. Figure 5-7 shows the printed monopole textile antenna connected to the 5-

stage Dickson during the tests. This PhD Thesis is focussed on the development of textile 

antennas, but more information about the integration of this antenna on the harvester system 

and on power supply of sensors nodes for health monitoring can ne found in references reporting 

complementary work made on the scope of PROENERGY PROJECT [121], [126], [131].

5.5 Conclusions 
The advance of wearable technology and the miniaturization of the electronic devices are 

boosting the development of smart garments, for instance able to provide information about 

the state of user’s health and environment.  

Energy harvesting can be a solution for powering battery-free devices. This technology is 

considered essential for the industry in several areas of expertise, including medical, consumer 

electronics, fashion, automotive, and industrial control process. In the context of wearable 

systems, textile antennas are emerging as the solution for feeding low-power devices and/or 

Wireless Sensors Body Networks, where the change of batteries is not easy to perform. 

Besides, the electromagnetic energy harvesting and the wireless power transmission are trendy 

research topics. A wearable systems using textile antennas is a very new subject, having 

emerged only in the past decade. For this reason, the state-of-the-art of textile antennas for 

RF energy harvesting is short. Also, the usage of electronic devices increases the availability of 

RF sources on the environment. Indeed, after field trials at Covilhã and Lisbon, two different 

cities in Portugal, the most available frequencies to harvest are from the emergency and 

television broadcasts, Amateur and GSM bands.

This Chapter has also presented a dual-band printed monopole textile antenna which was tested 

on the scope of the PROENERGY PROJECT – PTDC/EEA-TEL/122681/2010. It can be able to 

charge low-power devices, as well as extending the lifetime of tiny devices by using 

electromagnetic energy harvested at GSM 900 and DSC 1800. The printed monopole textile 

antenna was made using commercially available textiles. It has shown good behaviour on stand-

alone measurements. The gains of the antenna are around 1.8 dBi and 2.06 dBi allied with a 

radiation efficiency of 82% and 77.6% for the lowest and highest frequency bands, respectively. 

After its integration on the harvester system, was possible to charge the nodes of WSBN up to 

3 meters from the dedicated source.

Influence of the Manufacturing Techniques on the 

S11 Parameter of Printed Textile Antennas 

 

The content of this Chapter was partially published on Sensors Journal (2016), 10th European 

Conference on Antennas and Propagation (2016), Electronic Conference on Sensors Applications 

(2016) and IEEE International Microwave Workshop Series on Advanced Materials and Process 

(2017). In this last conference, the paper was received an honourable mention in the student 

paper competition.  

Beyond the selection of the textile materials to design an antenna, the process of 

manufacturing the antenna is also crucial, due to the very high deformability of the materials. 

In this Chapter, several techniques are tested through preliminary tests, to identify promising 

techniques and to discard inefficient ones, such as the gluing technique. Then, the influence 

of several parameters of the manufacturing techniques on the performance of the antenna 

are analysed, such as the use of steam during lamination, the type of adhesive sheet, the 

orientation of the conductive elements and others. Further, seven prototypes of the printed 

monopole textile antenna were manufactured by laminating and embroidering techniques. The 

measurement of sheet resistance has shown that the presence of the adhesive sheet used on 

the laminating process may reduce the conductivity of the conductive materials. Despite that, 

when measuring the return loss of printed monopole antennas produced by lamination, the 

results show the antennas have a good performance. The results also show that the orientation 

of the conductive fabric does not influence the performance of the antennas. However, when 

testing embroidered antennas, the results show that the direction and number of the stitches 

in the embroidery may influence the performance of the antenna.  

 

6.1 Introduction 
Beyond choosing the textile materials, the construction technique of the antenna is also crucial 

because the textile materials are highly deformable. The geometrical dimensions of the 

conductive patch and of the dielectric substrate should remain stable when connecting them, 

as the mechanical stabilization of both materials is essential to preserve the desired 

characteristics of the antenna. The geometrical precision of the conductive patch is also 



 70 

critical, especially when the antenna has thin details, as the one proposed in 5.4.  

As previously reviewed in Chapter 2, several techniques have been used to manufacture the 

textile antennas, using commercial available materials and low-cost procedures. The next 

Subsections describe and analyse several manufacturing techniques, aiming to improve the 

performance of the printed monopole textile antenna presented in previous Chapter 5. 

6.2 Preliminary Results: Miscellaneous Techniques 
In order to select the best procedures for manufacturing textile antennas, a textile antenna 

was designed to be reference and undergo preliminary tests. It is a microstrip patch antenna 

for 2.45 GHz, produced using the materials described on Table 5-3. It has a rectangular shape 

to guarantee the mechanical stability during the tests. The antenna was designed to be fed by 

a microstrip line, using a SMA connector, with 50 ? of impedance. The design and dimensions 

of the microstrip patch antenna are described in Figure 6-1 and Table 6-1, respectively.

Sixteen prototypes of the microstrip patch antenna were produced, as described in Table 6-2, 

using four manufacturing techniques: laminating, sewing, gluing and coating. Through the 

laminating technique, three adhesive sheets were tested, varying in terms of porosity, 

thickness and composition. Images of two of these thermal adhesive sheets are shown below in 



 71 

Table 6.4. The glued antennas were produced using three different glues available on the 

market, being one specific for textiles. Considering the high risk of short cuts between the 

patch and the ground plane, as reported on 2.2, one sewed antenna was made, sewing with 

non-conductive thread. Also, two antennas were fabricated through the coating process. In one 

of them, the prototype 14, the assembly is completely wrapped by the coat eliminating the 

material interface between the substrate and the conductive parts. Table 6-2 describes the 

prototypes and the materials used on the assembly process.

The S11 of all prototypes was measured with a VNA at Instituto de Telecomunicações – Aveiro 

and the results are shown on Figure 6-2. The coating process has severely affected the electrical 

properties of the conductive fabric, decreasing its conductivity. For this reason, the antennas 

produced with this technique did not result in viable antennas and the results of prototypes 14 

and 15 were eliminated, not being presented on Figure 6-2. 

 

Figure 6-2 S11 of the microstrip patch antennas  

Taking in account the inaccuracies due to the manual process, which cause small shifts on the 

resonance frequency, the prototypes 2, 4, 8, 10, 11, 13 and 16 show good results as one can 

see on Figure 6-2. The prototype 10 presents the best result, nearly matching the simulated 

S11.  

Focussing on the laminating technique, it is important to report that the prototypes 1, 2, 3 and 

4 were assembly ironing during 12 seconds (6 seconds for each conductive layer). However, due 

the higher thickness of the Fast2Fuse adhesive sheet, the prototype 5 was maintained under 

heating press for 20 seconds. This has caused a shrinkage of the dielectric substrate, resulting 

in less five millimetres on L dimension and less two millimetres on W dimension. Also, such 

thick interlining predictably changes the permittivity value of the substrate as add an interlayer 

between it and the conductive layer. The association of these both phenomena contributes to 

the mismatch of prototype 5, whose resonance frequency is significantly different from the 

simulated one. 

The sewed antenna, prototype 16, has presented a satisfactory result. Also, the grid pattern of 

seams contributes to create air gaps between the substrate and conductive parts, decreasing 

the permittivity value of the Cordura® as more air is trapped approaching thus the permittivity 



 74 

to 1. This way, the resonance frequency of the prototype 16 was shifted to a higher frequency, 

as one can observe in Figure 6-2. Air gaps between substrate and conductive layers are also 

clearly and visually observed on prototypes 1, 3, 9 and 12. As consequence the resonance 

frequency of these antennas are also shifted to higher values than the simulated one, as shown 

in Figure 6-2. 

Unexpectedly, the glued prototypes show the worse results. Moreover, the process to apply a 

thin and smooth layer of glue is difficult to practice in draws of fine details as the one of the 

printed monopole textile antenna, proposed in 5.4. Likewise, despite the satisfactory results 

of the sewed antennas, it is not possible to use the sewing technique to reproduce the printed 

monopole textile antenna, due to its fine details. For these reasons, in the next Subsection, 

among the techniques preliminarily considered, only the laminating manufacturing technique 

will be deeper analysed. 

6.3 Laminating Manufacturing Technique 
As briefly surveyed on Chapter 2, the laminating process is the most common manufacturing 

technique used to assembly printed textile antennas. It consists in assembling the components 

with the thermal adhesive sheet, through the ironing operation. The geometrical dimensions of 

the components should remain stable to preserve the desired characteristics of the antenna.  

Moreover, despite the adhesive remains at the interface of the material, in [29] authors affirm 

the adhesive layer introduces extra losses in the substrate and the conductivity may thus 

decrease after the laminating process, lowering the efficiency of the textile antenna. 

Moreover, the usage of thermal adhesive layers may also influence the conductivity properties 

of the conductive textile elements of the antenna, which is then important to analyse. 

6.3.1  Influence of using Thermal Adhesive Sheet on the Sheet 
Resistance of Conductive Fabrics  

In order to verify the influence of the adhesive sheet used in the laminating process on the 

conductivity of the materials and thus on the performance of the textile antennas, 

measurements of sheet resistance were performed, following the ASTM standard F 1896 – Test 

Method for Determine the Electrical Resistivity of a Printed Conductive Material [47].  

In this standard process, the resistance is measured with an ohmmeter, i.e. a resistance 

measuring electronic device. In this case, a sourcemeter Keithley 2602A was used.  To calculate 

the sheet resistance, the measured value of resistance is divided by the number of squares 

contained in the probe, given by the length divided by the width of the probe. The sheet 

resistance is thus given in ?/?. Figure 6-3 illustrates the set-up of the resistance measurement 

tests. The laminated probes were prepared using a Press MTA2012 FESPA, model SWH-2. The 



 75 

conductive materials under test (MUT) and the dimensions of the testing probes are described 

in Table 6-3. Table 6-4 presents the characteristics of the adhesive sheets used in lamination.

The resistance measurements were performed under controlled environmental conditions, 24ºC 

and 35% relative humidity, at the Printed Electronics Lab of EURECAT Technologic Centre, in 

Mataró, Spain. The planning of experiments consisted in testing two conductive materials, Zelt® 

and Pure copper taffeta fabric, and analyse the influence of three main variables of the 

lamination process that are: usage of steam, type of adhesive layer and superficial features of 

the laminated substrate. Therefore, the conductive textile materials were tested in the 

following conditions: 

A. stand-alone; 

B. stand-alone after wet heat treatment, of 12 seconds on 200ºC with steam; 

C. with adhesive sheet type I (grid network) and II (continuous web), after applying the 

adhesive sheets at 200ºC, under 10 bar, during 6 seconds, without steam; 

D. laminated to three different textile substrates, the 3D spacer fabric I and II, and Cordura II, 

described on previous Table 4-3. For each conductive material, six laminated probes were 

prepared, placing the conductive MUT in each of the two surfaces, face and reverse side, of 

all three substrates, and laminating at 200ºC, under 10 bar, for 12 sec., without steam. The 

following Figure 6-4 schematises the laminated probes prepared per substrate, placing the 

MUT over the two faces, the rougher and smother ones. 

 

Figure 6-4 Example of the group D of probes, for 3D I substrate. 

For all MUT of groups A, B and C, three probes were prepared and tested three times. Figure 

6-5 and Table 6-5 present the averaged values of these 9 measurements and their standard 

deviation.  



 77 

 

Figure 6-5 Results of sheet resistance measurements ([?/?], n = 9) 

As one can see in Figure 6-5, for both conductive MUT the lowest value of sheet resistance is 

obtained when testing  the material stand-alone. As expected, the measured value is higher 

than the one given by the producer, but closest to the value reported in [68]. As expected, the 

Pure copper polyester taffeta fabric presents a lower sheet resistance then Zelt®. As one may 

observe, major changes occur when steam is applied on the conductive fabrics, the sheet 

resistance increasing 27.5% and 46.2% after applying steam, for Zelt® and Pure copper polyester 

taffeta fabric, respectively.  This can be explained by the fact copper is more susceptible to 

the oxidation caused by the steam than the copper and thin alloy is, as reported in [76]. When 

no steam is applied, and adhesive sheet is placed on one surface of the conductive materials, 

pressing at 200ºC, under 10 bar for 6 seconds, a small increase on sheet resistance is observed. 

In the case of Pure copper polyester taffeta fabric, when laminating the adhesive sheet I and 

II on the conductive material, the Rs increases 23.28% and 24%, respectively. In the case of 

Zelt®, the increase of Rs is much lower, being 5.88% and 3.26% when applying the adhesive 

sheets I and II, respectively.

Observing the results of the laminated 3D fabrics in Table 6-5, it is possible to note that, 

independently of the type of adhesive sheet, the lowest Rs is obtained when the conductive 

MUT is laminated on the reverse-side of the 3D substrates, which is the face presenting the 

highest superficial roughness value, as previously characterised  (see Table 4-4). Laminating 

onto a rougher face corresponds to lowering the number of contact points. This way, less glue 



 78 

of the adhesive sheet penetrates deeply on the structure of the conductive fabric, preserving 

so the continuity of the electric flow through the conductive fabric.  

In turn, when the MUT is laminated onto the face-side of the substrate, which is the smoother 

surface, this creates a higher number of contact points, contributing for a deeper penetration 

of the adhesive into the MUT. In this case, the presence of the adhesive will create barriers 

that cause discontinuity in the electrical current flow. As result, Rs increases. 

In the case of the substrate Cordura II, despite the reverse-side is rougher than the face-side 

(Table 4-4), the MUT laminated on its reverse-side shows the highest Rs. Indeed, as the face-

side is coated, the glue of the adhesive sheet is easily absorbed by the coating, thus remaining 

as an interface material, improving continuity for the current flow in this face and as result the 

Rs decreases. 

Also, for both conductive MUT, independently of the substrate, the lowest Rs was generally 

obtained when using the adhesive sheet I. Figure 6-6, shows the Scanning Electron Microscope 

(SEM) images of the face where the adhesive was not applied. As one can see in the SEM images, 

even in this face there is the presence of adhesive. In (a) is possible to observe that, due to 

the shape of the adhesive sheet I (grid network), the glue covers a limited zone of pores, that 

is highlighted by the red arrows. Therefore, some area remains without adhesive and thus not 

interfering with the current flow. While in (b) the adhesive sheet II (continuous web) covers all 

pores of the surface, thus making more difficult for the electric current flow going through and 

thus the Rs increases.

6.3.2  Laminated Printed Monopole Antenna 

In order to confirm the results obtained on previous section, two printed monopole antennas 

were assembly by the laminating technique and their performance was analysed. These textile 

printed monopole antennas were the same one presented in Section 5.4, made using Zelt® for 



 79 

the conductive part and the Cordura® fabric as dielectric substrate. To insure the geometrical 

accuracy, all patches were cut by a laser cutting machine (Jinan G. Weike Science &amp;amp; Technology 

Co. Ltd., Jinan, China), on the Department of Aerospace Science at Universidade da Beira 

Interior.  

To investigate the consequence of using steam on the laminating process, and its influence on 

the return loss of the printed monopole antenna, prototype A was assembled applying steam 

during the ironing process, while in prototype B steam were not used. Both prototypes, A- with 

and B- without steam, were assembled using the thin thermal adhesive sheet I, following the 

ironing conditions presented on Table 6-6.  

Table 6-6 Ironing conditions 

Temperature (°C) Pressure (bar) Time (s) Vacuum table 
200 10 12 (6 for patch + 6 for ground plane) Yes 

To feed the antenna a SMA connector, with 50 ? of impedance, was used. Considering the 

experience obtained during the manufacturing process of the printed monopole reported on 

Section 5.4, and the experimental knowledge of how difficult it is welding on Zelt®, the SMA 

connector was glued using the conductive glue Elecolit®, with 70% of silver (Panacol – Elosol 

GmbH, Taunus, Germany). After, an extra layer of an elastic and conductive glue, the Wire 

Glue™ Advanced Microcarbon Technology (Andres Products, Andover, USA), was applied to 

protect the previous silver layer and reinforce the connection between the SMA connector and 

the Zelt®. The S11 of prototypes A and B were measured with a VNA at Instituto de 

Telecomunicações – Aveiro, and the obtained results are shown on Figure 6-7.  

 
Figure 6-7 Comparison between ironing processes with and without steam 

According to the measured results presented on Figure 6-7, one can see a higher mismatch on 

the frequency of the antenna made using steam during the ironing process. In order to 

investigate the cause of this mismatch, the thickness of the antenna was measured, using KES-



 80 

F-3 Compressional Tester of Kawabata’s Evaluation System for fabrics. The thickness of the 

antenna made without steam is 0.62 mm, and the thickness of the antenna made with steam is 

0.60 mm. This difference can be due to the higher compaction of the materials when steam is 

applied. As one can see in the SEM images of cross section of the antenna shown on Figure 6-8, 

in the antenna without steam the adhesive sheet (highlighted by yellow arrows in image (a)) 

remains at the interface between the conductive and dielectric layers. However, when steam 

is applied, the adhesive sheet merges with the textile structure (highlighted by green arrows 

in image (b)).  

Based on the results and analysis presented on Subsection 6.3.1, this effect is responsible for a 

decrease in the conductivity due to the presence of the glue among the conductive yarns. 

Moreover, the presence of the adhesive sheet into the Cordura® fabric will presumably change, 

even if slightly, its permittivity. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that it is important to further 

study and quantify the effect of steam in the performance of the antenna, in order to consider 

it in the design of the antenna improving this way the modelling and simulation of its 

performance.

Figure 6-8 SEM images: cross-section of the antenna assembled (a) without steam and (b) with steam 

6.3.3  Influence of the Cutting Direction of the Conductive Fabrics 

The cutting process of the conductive material is critical, mainly when the antenna has very 

thin lines as for instance the Wf dimension of the printed monopole (see 5.4). Beyond the 

cutting precision, the alignment of the fabric with the cutting direction may also influence the 

performance of the antenna. Therefore, in order to analyse the influence of the orientation of 

the conductive woven (Zelt®) in the S11 parameter, an extra prototype of printed monopole was 

fabricated:  

• Prototype C: patch of antenna was cut on bias of the fabric (45°). 

This prototype was tested and its results were compared to the ones of prototype B, whose 

patch was cut parallel to the warp of the fabric. One should note that Zelt® is a plain weave 



 81 

woven with the same amount of yarns per cm2 (45 yarns) in the warp and in the weft, and for 

this reason only the warp direction was considered. Both prototypes were assembled using the 

thermal adhesive sheet I, without steam, following the ironing conditions presented on Table 

6-6. Figure 6-9 presents the simulated and measured values of S11 parameter of both antennas. 

 
Figure 6-9 Simulated and measured return loss of laminated antennas 

Both antennas, produced by the lamination technique, have shown good results, as the S11 

parameter shows. The orientation of the conductive patch does not seem to influence the 

performance of these antennas. As one can see on Figure 6-9, the measurements match the 

simulation fairly well, although there is a small shift of the frequency. This shift of frequency 

might be due to the narrow manufacturing tolerances that exist even when cutting the fabric 

by laser. Still, the reflection coefficient is low at the operating frequencies, meaning that the 

antenna presents a good impedance match in both GSM and DCS bands. 

6.4  Embroidery Manufacturing Technique 
Embroidering is a promising method in terms of repeatability and mass-manufacturing as the 

embroidered antennas do not need a cutting neither lamination process, thus reducing the 

production costs. For this reason, several embroidered antennas have been proposed, for 

instance spiral antennas [25-26], RFID tags [27-28], and antennas without a ground plane [29–

31]. This Section explores the embroidering technique to produce antennas that can be easily 

applied in clothing as an emblem. This way the embroidering technique might enlarge the 

dissemination of the textile antennas into clothing.  

The experimental study on embroidering is based on the same printed monopole antenna, 

previously presented at Section 5.4. As this antenna requires a ground plane, the embroidering 

manufacturing process has to be adapted in order to eliminate the short cuts between the patch 

and the ground plane. Therefore, the construction technique of these embroidered antennas 

was: firstly, embroidering the patch in a thin textile; secondly, cut the embroidery; and, finally, 

attach the embroidery to the dielectric substrate using the thermal adhesive sheet. This process 



 82 

is the same one used to produce the traditional emblems for cloth customization. Further, the 

SMA connector was glued using conductive glues, as described in previous Subsection 6.3.2.  

Five antennas were developed with this technique, using an automatic embroidering machine 

(SWF MA-6, SWF Central, Creve Coeur, USA), on the Department of Textile Science and 

Technology at Universidade da Beira Interior, see Figure 6-10. The patches were embroidered 

in the Atlantic fabric (B. W. Wernerfelt Group, Søborg, Danmark) using Silverpam yarn (Tibtech 

Innovations, Roncq, France). Table 6-7 describes the characteristics of these materials used on 

the embroidering process of the printed monopole textile antennas.

The orientation of the stitch was considered by performing stitches along four different 

directions for antennas 1, 3, 4, and 5. The number of stiches was considered by varying the 

float of the stitch for antennas 2 and 3. To avoid differences in the fringe effect on the feed 

line (Wf × Lf) due the different directions of the stitches, all antennas have feed lines 

embroidered with a horizontal step stitch. The parameters of the embroidery are described in 

Table 6-8, and Figure 6-11 shows the embroidered patches.

Figure 6-12 shows the simulated and measured values of the S11 parameter of these antennas, 

measured with a VNA, at Instituto de Telecomunicações - Aveiro. It is clear that the 

measurements match closely to the simulations. A prototype 3 is the one with the best match 

of the return loss. 



 84 

 
Figure 6-12 Simulated and measured return loss of embroidered antennas 

The prototype 3 presents the closest result to the simulation line. This can be due to the fact 

the embroidery stitch direction is parallel of the feed line, homogenizing the current flow [75]. 

Prototypes 4 and 5 present very similar behaviours that might indicate the angle of the diagonal 

direction is not influencing it. Coherently, prototype 1 shows the higher shift of the frequency 

that can be due to the fact the direction of the embroidery stitch is perpendicular to the feed 

line. Additionally, prototype 2 was made using a vertical stitch, as well as prototype 3, having 

however, a higher number of stitches. This may make the current flow less continuous, due the 

constant breaks and higher number of air gaps in the embroidery  as already reported by other 

authors [36]. This probably reduces the conductivity of the patch, which explain the difference 

between the magnitudes of the return loss of prototypes 3 and 2. 

6.5 Conclusions 
Considering the manufacturing techniques, seams can be considered since non-conductive 

threads are used to avoid short cuts between the patch and the ground plane. Textile glue is 

not enough to completely assembly the conductive fabrics. Although gluing with permanent 

glue and super glue works well, gluing is a problematic technique as it is difficult to apply a 

smooth and continuous portion of glue. 

In the laminating technique, a thin adhesive sheet most be used to minimise its interference 

on the permittivity of the dielectric material. Also, the presence of the glue of the adhesive 

sheet affects the sheet resistance of the conductive fabric. The choice of a patterned adhesive 

sheet, such as sheet I, whose pattern is a grid network, can reduce the discontinuity of the 

current flow. On the laminating process, when the conductive material is assembled to a 

smooth face of the substrate, its sheet resistance will increase due to the high number of 

contact points which cause discontinuities on the electric current flow. Therefore, when 

producing antennas using substrates with different faces, as for instance the 3D spacer fabrics, 

to preserve the conductivity of the material of the patch, it should preferably be assembled to 

the rougher face of the substrate.  



 85 

When laminating, the ironing process without steam seems to be preferable as it better 

preserves the electromagnetic performance of the materials. Additionally, this work also shows 

that the orientation of the conductive fabric used for the patch, plain weave woven, is not 

influencing the performance of the laminated antenna.  

When embroidering antennas, it is preferable to use stitches that are parallel to the feed line, 

to ensure a continuous current flow. In addition, this work shows that the number of stitches 

in the embroidery may contribute to increase the conductivity of some elements, thus 

improving the performance of the antenna. Therefore, it is a parameter that should be 

considered when manufacturing embroidered antennas. 

Finally, embroidering is a promising technique to customize the application of antennas on 

clothing and fashion, as embroidered antennas may be addressed as emblems are.

Smart Coat with a Fully Embedded Antenna for RF 

Energy Harvesting 

 

The content of this Chapter was partially published on Sensors Journal (2016), Smart Fabric 

and Wearable Technologies Conference (2015), 10th European Conference on Antennas and 

Propagation (2016) and Electronic Conference on Sensors Applications (2016). This Chapter 

presents the E-Caption: Smart and Sustainable Coat. It has an embedded dual-band printed 

monopole textile antenna for RF energy harvesting, operating at GSM 900 and DCS 1800 bands. 

This printed antenna is fully integrated, as its dielectric is the textile material composing the 

coat itself. The E-Caption illustrates the innovative concept of textile antennas that can be 

manipulated as simple emblems. The comparison of results obtained, before and after the 

integration of the antenna into cloth, shows that the integration and the presence of the 

human body does not affect the behaviour of the antenna.  

 

7.1 Introduction 
The recent technological developments made electronic devices become imperative and 

indispensable, being present in our daily routines, all over the world. The development of smart 

and wearable textile products requires bringing technologies to the consumer in an acceptable 

and desirable format.  

In the framework of textile antennas for RF energy harvesting, as reviewed on 5.2, different 

designs have been proposed in the past decade. Nevertheless, only two works [112], [113], 

known to the author, have outlined the integration of these antennas in smart clothing. This 

leads to conclude that, despite the advance on the manufacturing techniques of the textile 

antennas, their integration into clothing is still a difficult task.  

Until now, the printed textile antennas have been produced separately and are then posteriorly 

integrated in the lining of the garment, into pockets or simply glued to the cloth. Only on the 

RFID context textile antennas have been integrated in products in a pleasing way, for instance 

for commercial advertisement proposes, where antennas are dissimulated in brand names and 



 88 

logotypes [73], [141]. Nevertheless, none author has analysed the influence of its integration 

on clothing on its performance.  

7.2 Integration into Clothing 
This Chapter proposes an innovative solution that presents the first printed monopole textile 

antenna (presented on 5.4) manufactured directly in the clothing as it is made with the same 

textile materials composing the cloth. This innovative solution to integrate antennas into cloths 

is illustrated on Figure 7-1. The antenna is integrated into the clothing by manipulating it as a 

simple emblem. In the future, the antennas can be incorporated into patterns and drawings, 

mixing conductive and non-conductive embroideries, creating fashionable emblems that 

function as antennas. These “emblem” antennas may be accessible to the end user for 

customization of smart cloth, for several applications. 

 
Figure 7-1 Comparison of techniques of integration of antennas into cloth (a) typical integration and (b) 

“emblem” approach 

The curvature of the human body consists of a superposition of bends in arbitrary directions. 

This hinders the integration of the conventional and rigid antennas into clothing. Due the 

flexibility and drapability of fabrics, textile antennas have been used for on-body applications.  

However, when the textile fabric adapts to the surface topology it bends and deforms, causing 

changes to its electromagnetic properties and thus influencing the antenna performance [28], 

[29], [36]. Indeed, the bending and the elongation of the dielectric fabric influences its 

(a) 

(b) 



 89 

permittivity and its thickness, which affects the resonance frequency of the antenna and 

especially the bandwidth, as explained in [28], [36].  

The relationship between the performance of ex-situ textile antennas and the curvature of the 

human body have been studied in the last decades. To simulate the curvature of arms and legs, 

the authors have used PVC pipes to bend the antenna in different radius of curvature, along 

the width and length dimensions [36], [58], [142]. The measurements in the bended antennas, 

have shown a detuning of resonance frequency, independently of the direction of bending and 

of the radii of the pipes, in comparison to the resonance frequency of antennas on flat state 

[36], [58], [142]. Also, under bend conditions, as smaller bend the radius the is, as lower the 

resonance frequency becomes [36], [142].  

The place to integrate the printed monopole antenna on the coat, has to be a place with large 

curvature radius, in order to minimize the influence of bending on the performance of the 

antenna.  In this framework, considering the unobtrusive areas to integrate wearable devices 

identified in [143], the chosen area to place the antenna was “waist and hips”, as it is also an 

area easily accessible as one can see on Figure 7-2. 

 

Figure 7-2 Unobtrusive areas to integrate wearable devices, according to [143]  

7.3  E-Caption: Smart and Sustainable Coat 
The integration of textile antennas for energy harvesting into smart clothing emerges as a 

particularly interesting solution when the replacement of batteries is not easy to practice, such 

as in wearable devices. A fully-embedded antenna in clothing contributes for the integration 

of electronic devices in less obtrusive ways, improving the good aesthetic and the technical 

design, making the garment more comfortable and desirable to the final consumer. This might 



 90 

enhance niche markets where form and function work together in order to create new 

attractive textile products that can assist the user in many aspects of their daily routine. 

The E-Caption: Smart and Sustainable Coat was developed combining these concepts. It is a 

smart coat for electromagnetic harvesting, named E-Caption: Smart and Sustainable Coat, in 

which the antenna has a substrate that is continuous and was cut according to the pattern-

making of the coat, thus being part of it [127]. The integrated printed monopole textile antenna 

was manufactured based in the results presented on Chapter 6. That means, the patch was cut 

parallel to the warp, using laser cutting machine, and was produced by laminating 

manufacturing technique, without steam on the process. Also, the SMA connector was glued 

using conductive glues. The coat is made of Cordura® and of a 3D fabric (Reference 3003, LMA—

Leandro Manuel Araújo, Ltda., Matosinhos, Portugal). Figure 7-3 shows the E-Caption coat with 

the integrated printed monopole textile antenna for RF energy harvesting. Also, Figure 7-4 

presents the logotype of E-Caption created for marketing proposes, such as when the E-Caption 

was presented on a television show (see Appendix E). Figure 7-5 shows the integrated 5-stage 

Dickson multiplier voltage, and illustrate the system operation.

7.4 Influence of the Human Body on the Performance of 
E-Caption  

Despite the concern about the influence of the human body on the performance of antennas, 

detuning the resonance frequency and changing the radiation patterning [68], [144]–[147], none 

results about the influence of the body on the performance of textile antennas already 

integrated into clothing were presented in the literature up to now. Thus, this Subsection will 

describe the performance of the antenna belonging to the E-Caption: Smart and Sustainable 

Coat. The coat was tested in the anechoic chamber, at Instituto de Telecomunucações – Aveiro, 

as shown on Figure 7-6.

measurements 



 92 

Figure 7-7 presents the variation in the S11 parameter obtained through numerical simulation 

and measured in free space, before and after the integration into the smart coat. It is possible 

to see the agreement between the simulated and measured values even in the on-body 

measurements. In both situations, the textile antenna presents an operating frequency range 

capable of completely covering the GSM 900 (880–960 MHz) and the DCS 1800 (1710–1880 MHz). 

 
Figure 7-7 Simulated and measured return loss, before/after dressing the coat 

The Figure 7-8 shows the radiation pattern of the antenna fully integrated into the smart coat 

structure, the free-space and on-body measurements. Even after integrated into clothing, the 

radiation pattern of the antenna is clearly omnidirectional. The results depicted on Figure 7-8 

corresponds to the XZ plane. This is the only possible and measurable plane, as can be seen in 

previous Figure 7-6, due to the configuration and placement of the antenna on the coat. 

Nevertheless, it is the most relevant plane in order to evaluate the omnidirectional 

characteristic of the antenna. Moreover, given the position of the antenna on the coat, it is 

clear that the direction at which the antenna will present less influence from the coat or from 

the person occurs at nearly 30° in the broadside direction. This is confirmed by the results 

depicted on Figure 7-8. 



 93 

 
                                   (a)                                                                        (b) 

Figure 7-8 Measured radiation pattern of the textile antenna into the coat, free-space and on-body 
measurements at (a) 900 MHz and (b) 1800 MHz 

According to the results presented in Figure 7-8, one may conclude that, as expected, the mass 

of the coat and mainly of the person influence the radiation characteristic of the antenna. In 

the measurement of the empty jacket, when the coat places between the probe antenna and 

the test antenna, around 160°, there is a reduction in the gain of the antenna, which is due to 

the presence of a large dielectric body, that is, the coat. Nevertheless, the antenna shows a 

nearly omnidirectional pattern.  

The on-body antenna performs differently. Since the human body is conductive, it absorbs and 

reflects radiofrequency waves. The results on Figure 7-8 show that when the body is behind the 

test antenna, at 30° broadside, a slight increase in gain is measured. However, when the body 

is between the probe and the test antenna, at 160°, it will absorb a high amount of radiation 

and will reflect the rest in the opposite direction, shielding the test antenna and, thus, create 

a null of radiation at this point. This happens for both frequencies, being clearer at 1800 MHz. 

7.5 Conclusions 
In the future, garments will not only communicate social conditions or protect the human body 

against the extremes of nature, but will also provide information and communication tools. 

Clothes are becoming able to communicate wirelessly without the need of large and expensive 

equipment. This is possible because textile technologies can produce new types of sensors and 

antennas that are so small, flexible, and inexpensive that they can be applied in different types 

of clothing, shoes, and accessories. 

The effective integration of wearable systems contributes to the advance of the IoT. Based on 

the wearability guidelines, the innovative concept of producing textile antennas to integrate 

into clothing by simply manipulating it as an “emblem” has emerged, may improve the usage 

of the wearable technologies. In the future, the wearable antennas can be incorporated into 



 94 

textile patterns and drawings, creating fashionable antennas. These “emblem” antennas may 

be easily acceded by the end user, for customization of smart cloth for several applications.  

The E-Caption: Smart and Sustainable Coat is the first prototype of this concept, integrating an 

“emblem” antenna capable of completely covering GSM900 (880–960 MHz) and the DCS1800  

(1710–1880 MHz) bands, for IoT applications. In this context, the integration of textile antennas 

for energy harvesting into smart clothing can be a solution for recharging wearable devices, 

such as low-power electronics and WBSN. 

Embedding antennas in clothing contributes for the advance of the integration of electronic 

devices in less obtrusive way, making the smart clothes more comfortable. In the E-caption, 

the antenna is manufactured directly on the clothing, having a continuous dielectric substrate 

made with the textile materials composing the coat. Therefore, a continuous substrate of the 

antenna does not influence its performance. Moreover, the presented results show that, despite 

the masses of the coat and of the body influence the radiation characteristic of the integrated 

antenna, the antenna still shows a nearly omnidirectional radiation pattern.

Development of a Continuous Substrate Integrating 

the Ground Plane 

 

The exponential growth in the wearable market is boosting the industrialization process of 

manufacturing textile antennas. The patch of planar antennas can be easily cut, embroidered 

or screen printed by machines. The conception of an optimal industrial substrate that meets 

all the mechanical and electromagnetic requirements is still a challenge. Following the 

continuous substrate concept presented in previous Chapter 7, this Chapter presents a 

continuous Substrate Integrating the Ground Plane (SIGP). The SIGP is a novel textile material, 

which is a double fabric that integrates the dielectric substrate and the conductive ground 

plane in a single textile, eliminating thus one laminating step in the manufacturing process of 

microstrip patch antennas. Three SIGP materials, that are weft knitted spacer fabrics, were 

developed in partnership with the company Borgstena Textile Portugal Lda, creating synergy 

between academy and industry. The tests of the performance of SIGP show that the integration 

of the ground plane into the substrate changes the dielectric constant of the material. Despite 

this, after the accurate dielectric and electrical characterization, the SIGP I has shown a good 

performance as dielectric substrate of microstrip patch antenna for energy harvesting. 

 

8.1 Introduction 
According to the Wearable Technology 2017-2027: Markets, Players and Forecasts report by 

IDTechEx [148], the market for wearable devices will reach over $150 billions per year until 

2027. Technical textiles will follow the same path as well [9]. For this reason, the 

industrialization of the manufacturing processes, aiming the mass production of textile 

antennas, emerge with great relevance.  

Although the patch of microstrip antennas may have fine details, they can be easily cut or 

embroidered by industrial machines, as previously discussed on Chapter 6. Therefore, the focus 

of this Chapter will be on the industrial production of a dielectric substrate together with the 

ground plane. Based on previous results reported in Chapter 7, which have proven that a 

continuous substrate does not influence the performance of the textile antenna, this chapter 



 96 

presents a new continuous substrate which, in plus, integrates the ground plane. This new 

material is from now designated SIGP - Substrate Integrating the Ground Plane.  

The SIGP is thus a novel textile material that integrates the dielectric substrate and the 

conductive ground plane in a single sheet, as one can see on Figure 8-1. This way, the 

manufacturing process of the textile microstrip patch antennas may become easier and faster. 

The integration of the ground plane into the substrate can contribute to decrease the losses 

and mismatches caused by the incurrences due to the hand-made manufacturing process. Also, 

the continuous ground plane, shields the antenna radiation, ensuring that the human body is 

exposed only to a very small fraction of the radiation. 

 
Figure 8-1 Continuous Substrate Integrating the Ground Plane - 3D Weft knitted spacer fabric (white) 

with an integrated conductive layer (gold) 

The concept of integrating the antenna in a multiple fabric, was already presented in [80], 

[149], [150]. In these works, the authors present a 3D Integrated Microstrip Antenna, which is 

woven into a 3D orthogonal fabric. This microstrip antenna, for aerospace application, was 

developed to work as radar L-band (1.5 GHz). It was made using copper yarns in the conductive 

parts and aramid (Kevlar 129) yarns in the dielectric layer. Despite the measured resonance 

frequency is 1.8 GHz, higher than the planned one, this antenna shows a great result as proves 

that the antenna can be integrated in a unique material, composed of multiple layers. 

8.2 Method and Materials 
The SIGP is a weft knitted spacer fabric, produced in a double circular machine, the V-LEC6BS 

Knitting Machine (Monarch Knitting Machinery Ltd., Leicester, England). Figure 8-2 presents 

this machine, which has a routable needle cylinder and needle dial, being capable to produce 

a 3D weft knit with differentiated conductive and dielectric faces. The SIGP was developed and 

manufactured at Borgstena Textile Portugal Lda, following the manufacturing process of the 

Patent US 6779369 B2 [151]. Figure 8-3 presents the scheme of the needles and yarns on the 

knitting machine.

the green, orange and purple yarns correspondent to the conductive, dielectric and spacer yarns, 

respectively, based on [151]; (b) SEM image of the SIGP I, with 35X amplification 
 

Based on the knitting structure presented in Figure 8-3, three different SIGP were developed, 

using the following yarns: 

• for the dielectric substrate a 100% PES yarn.  

• for the spacer yarn, a Monofilament FH yarn, 100% PET, 225 dtex, produced by Monosuisse 

AG (Emmenbrücke, Switzerland).  

• for the conductive layer two different yarns, “Shieldex® 117/17 dtex Z-turns HC+B” and 

“Shieldex® 22/1 dtex + 113/32 dtex PES”, produced by Shieldex Trading (Palmyra, USA).  



 98 

The Shieldex® 117/17 yarn (Shieldex® 117/17 dtex Z-turns HC+B) is a high tenacity PA 6.6 

filament yarn, composed by 17 twisted filaments coated with 99% pure silver. The linear mass 

of this yarn is 141 dtex and it presents a resistivity&amp;lt;500 ?/m (values given by the 

manufacturer). The Shieldex® 22/1 yarn (Shieldex® 22/1 dtex + 113/32 dtex PES) is a twisted 

yarn composed by two different materials: a PA 6 monofilament plated with 99% pure silver 

twisted with 32 PES filaments. The linear mass of this yarn is 145 dtex and it presents a 

resistivity&amp;lt;30.000 ?/m (values given by the manufacturer).  

The choice of these two materials is founded on the linear mass (dtex) of the yarns that must 

be suitable for work with the V-LEC6BS knitting machine and of course on their electrical 

conductivity. The price of the yarns was considered as well. Thus, the Shieldex® 117/17 yarn 

was selected because of its highly conductivity, suitable for producing antennas. The Shieldex® 

22/1 yarn was selected because of its price (82€/Kg, in October 2016), being four times less 

expensive than the other one (307€/Kg, in October 2016). These yarns were worked separately 

and also mixed, looking for a good compromise between conductivity and price.    

The three developed SIGP are listed below: 

• SIGP I -  Ground plane made using the Shieldex® 117/17 yarn; 

• SIGP II -  Ground plane made using the Shieldex® 22/1 yarn; 

• SIGP III -  Ground plane made mixing both conductive yarns, alternating yarns every two 

courses.  

Previous Figure 8-1 presents an image of the SIGP I material, which is composed of one 

conductive face made of Shieldex® 117/17 yarn, and one dielectric face made of 100% PES yarn. 

Also, a control and reference material was produced using the 100% PES yarn on both sides of 

the spacer knit. This control material aims to serve as reference to compare with and to analyse 

the influence of the integration of the ground plane in the properties of the dielectric substrate. 

The structural parameters and the electromagnetic properties of these spacer knits will be 

described in the next Subsections. 

8.3 Structural Parameters  
The thickness and the surface roughness of the samples were measured using the KES-F – 3 

Compressional Tester of Kawabata’s Evaluation System for Fabrics. The tests were performed 

at the Textile Department of UBI, under controlled environmental conditions, 25ºC and 65% RH, 

testing 5 probes of each SIGP, for determining the total thickness. The thickness of the 

conductive layer was measured trough SEM image analysis, at the Laboratory of Electron 

Microscopy of UBI. The superficial porosity was calculated through the image analyser method 

previously presented on Chapter 4, using SEM images with 35X amplification. Table 8-1 

summarises the structural parameters of the SIGP. Table 8-2 shows the structural parameters 

of the reference spacer knit.

As one can see on Table 8-1, despite the same number of loops in both dielectric and conductive 

faces, the superficial porosity is slightly different. As previously explained in Chapter 4, the 

superficial porosity depends on the structure of the knit as well as on the properties of the 

yarns. In these materials, the knit structure is unique and for this reason, the small variations 

in the superficial porosity of the conductive face are due to the differences of the diameter 

and title of the conductive yarns. Indeed, the SIGP I, which is made of Shieldex® 117/17 yarn, 

the thinnest conductive yarn (141 dtex), presents the highest superficial porosity. Accordingly, 

the SIGP II that was made of Shieldex® 22/1 yarn, the thickest one (145 dtex), presents the 

lowest superficial porosity. While the SIGP III shows an intermediate superficial porosity value, 

as expected as it is made of a mixture of both conductive yarns.  

8.4 Characterization of the Electromagnetic Properties 

8.4.1  Dielectric Constant  

As the SIGP has a conductive layer, the Resonator-Based Experimental Technique previously 

presented in Chapter 4 cannot be used to characterize the dielectric properties. For this reason, 

the dielectric constant was measured through the Microstrip Resonator Patch Method [20]. As 

presented in 3.3.4, this method consists in designing a microstrip patch antenna using an 

estimated ?r value, and calculating the real ?r based on the shift of the measured resonant 

frequency of the tested antenna. 

Thus, one microstrip patch antenna was designed to resonate at 2.45 GHz and to be 

manufactured using the three SIGP materials. The antenna was simulated in the CST Microwave 

Studio 2017 full-wave simulator, using estimated values of ?r = 1.10 and tan? = 0.006. These 

estimated values were based on the obtained results for the 3D fabrics, during the dielectric 



 100 

characterization in Chapter 4. For manufacturing the radiant element, i.e. the conductive 

patch, the Pure copper polyester taffeta fabric (previous Table 6-3) was used and assembled 

by laminating technique. As the conductivity of the ground plane is unknown, the antenna was 

simulated considering the conductivity value of the Pure copper polyester taffeta fabric. Figure 

8-4 presents the design and the dimensions (mm) of this microstrip patch antenna. 

As control, a prototype using the reference spacer knit was also manufactured, using the Pure 

copper polyester taffeta fabric for both patch and ground plane.  

 

Figure 8-4 Microstrip patch antenna designed for the dielectric characterization, dimensions in mm 

All patches were cut on laser cutting (Jinan G. Weike Science &amp;amp; Technology Co. Ltd., Jinan, 

China), on Department of Aerospace Science at Universidade da Beira Interior; and the antennas 

were assembled by the laminating process, using the Adhesive Sheet II (previous Table 6-4). 

Due to the knitted structure, it was impossible welding the SMA connector in the ground plane 

as usually performed in some previous antennas. For this reason, the SMA connector was glued 

to the ground plane using a conductive glue Elecolit® and to ensure the mechanical stability an 

extra coating of Slow-Cure™ Epoxy (Bob Smith Industries Inc., Atascadero, USA) was applied. In 

the patch side, the SMA connector was welded on the conductive fabric, as usual. The antennas 

were tested using a VNA, at Instituto de Telecomunicações – Aveiro and Figure 8-5 presents the 

obtained results. 



 101 

 
Figure 8-5 Measured S11 of the microstrip patch antenna designed for the dielectric characterization 

As one can see on Figure 8-5, the prototype 4, that is the control antenna which was made with 

the reference spacer knit and the conductive fabric (Pure copper polyester taffeta), presents 

the best agreement with the simulated S11. This was expected, as the simulation was made 

using the conductivity value of the Pure copper polyester taffeta fabric. This result shows that 

the estimated values of ?r = 1.10 and tan? = 0.006 characterize well the dielectric behaviour 

of the reference spacer knit. 

Prototypes 2 and 3 do not work, due to the low conductivity of the ground plane. These results 

are thus discarded. Prototype 1 presents an acceptable performance. Comparing the return 

loss of prototypes 1 and 4, it is possible to see that the integration of the ground plane on the 

substrate increases the dielectric constant value, as the resonant frequency of prototype 1 

shifted for a lower frequency. This can be explained by the fact the integration of the ground 

plane reduces the thickness of the substrate, thus changing the Q-factor of the antenna as 

described in 2.2.1.1. Indeed, the total thickness value is 2 mm for all knit spacer fabrics herein 

considered. However, the SIGP fabrics already include the ground plane, whose thickness is 

0,043 mm (Table 8-1), and thus its dielectric substrate is thinner than 2 mm. While the control 

antenna has a substrate 2 mm thick overlapped by the conductive fabric whose thickness is 

equal 0,08 mm (Table 6-3).   

Based on these results, a new simulation of the prototype 1 was made, changing the ?r value 

until the new simulated return loss be in agreement with the already measured return loss, to 

then extract the real ?r value. Figure 8-6 plots the result of the S11 obtained in the new 

simulation and the previously result obtained testing the prototype 1.

Figure 8-6 Plot of the previously measured S11 and of the new simulation of the prototype 1 

Through comparing these two return losses, the new value ?r = 1.28 is extracted, according to 

the method presented at 3.3.4. Assuming this ?r as the real value of the substrate, one may 

estimate the conductivity of the ground plane of SIGP I as ? = 50 kS/m. The validation of these 

results is further presented in Section 8.5. 

8.4.2  Surface Resistance 

To characterize the conductivity of the ground plane, the sheet resistance was measured 

following the ASTM Standard F 1896 – Test Method for Determine the Electrical Resistivity of a 

Printed Conductive Material [47], already presented in 6.3.1. The tests were performed at the 

Department of Aerospace Science of UBI, under the environmental conditions of 25ºC and 50% 

RH. Four probes of each SIGP were measured with an Agilent HP 34401A Multimeter. Also, the 

conductivity was calculated by the Equation 2-5. Table 8-3 reports the measured results.

As expected, the ground plane of SIGP I material, made of the most conductive yarn (Shieldex® 

117/17), has shown the best result, presenting the lowest Rs value. Accordingly, the ground 

plane of SIGP II material, made of the less conductive yarn (Shieldex® 22/1), presents the 

highest Rs value. While the ground plane of the SIGP III material presents an intermediate Rs 

value. The conductivity of the knitted fabric depends on the properties of the conductive yarns 

composing it.  Observing the SEM images, with 200X of amplification, presented in Figure 8-7, 



 103 

it is possible to see in (a) that all filaments of the Shieldex® 117/17 yarn are coated with silver. 

While in (b) one can observe that in the Shieldex® 22/1 yarn there exists only one conductive 

plated monofilament that is twisted with non-conductive filaments. This observation 

corroborates the results obtained for the sheet resistance of the ground plane. Also, in (c) it is 

possible to observe loops establishing some but few contacts between the Shieldex® 22/1 and 

Shieldex® 117/17 yarns. The SIGP III material, compared to the SIGP II one, presents a better 

performance, but its sheet resistance is still too high due to the few contacts between both 

conductive yarns.  

Finally, the measured conductivity of the ground plane of SIGP I, which is 54 kS/m, agrees very 

well with the result estimated through the measurement on the microstrip patch antenna, 

which is 50 kS/m, as reported in previous section.

8.5 Validation of the Performance of SIGP 
To validate the results obtained in previous section 8.4, a new microstrip patch antenna for 

energy harvesting at ISM band (Industrial, Scientific and Medical), between 2.4 and 2.5 GHz, 

was designed using the SIGP I as substrate and ground plane and the Pure copper polyester 

taffeta fabric as patch. This bandwidth also serves to support to the services of WLAN, 

Bluetooth, and among others. Figure 8-8 presents the design and the dimensions (mm) of this 

microstrip patch antenna. 

 
Figure 8-8 Microstrip patch antenna for energy harvesting at ISM band, dimensions in mm 

This antenna was produced using the same manufacturing conditions as the antennas presented 

in previous 8.4.1. The microstrip patch antenna was tested using a VNA, at Instituto de 

Telecomunicações – Aveiro and Figure 8-9 presents the results. 



 105 

 
Figure 8-9 S11 of the microstrip patch antenna for energy harvesting at ISM band 

As one can see on Figure 8-9, the antenna shows a good impedance, validating so the results of 

the electromagnetic characterisation presented in previous Subsections. The small shift 

presented on S11, as the simulated frequency is 2.42 GHz and the measured frequency is 2.40 

GHz, is not significant and can be explained due to the inaccuracies on the manufacturing 

process, such as the gluing of the SMA connector.  

8.6 Conclusions 
This chapter presents the development and validation of a continuous Substrate Integrating the 

Ground Plane (SIGP). The integration of the textile ground plane into the surface of the textile 

substrate, all in one fabric that has multiple layers, is the first step to the industrialization of 

the textile microstrip patch antennas. The knitting spacer technologies, warp and weft 

technologies, are particularly suited for this propose as allow the production of thick fabrics 

with different surfaces. The weft knitted spacer fabrics with an integrated conductive layer, 

herein developed and presented, have shown how promising is this approach. The SIGP I 

presented good dielectric and electrical properties, being thus suitable to be used for industrial 

fabrication and mass production of textile microstrip patch antennas and further smart clothing 

and wearables.  

In this Chapter the electrical properties of the spacer knitted fabrics were characterized using 

the ASTM Standard F 1896. Also, the dielectric constant was characterized through the 

microstrip patch radiator method.  

Three SIGP materials, which are weft knitted spacer fabrics, were developed using two types 

of conductive yarns. The SIGP I, made using a highly conductive yarn in which all filaments are 

coated, shows the best conductivity result and best performance when tested on antenna. The 

SIGP II, made using a less conductive yarn in which only one plated monofilament is conductive, 

and the SIGP III, made with a mix of both yarns, are not conducting enough to be applied on 

antennas as the S11 results show. Despite the conductivity is too low for the requirement of 



 106 

antennas, these weft knitted spacer fabrics are interesting materials as complement for other 

applications, such as electromagnetic shielding, textile switches and other interactive textiles. 

Being cheaper materials, these SIGP II and III fabrics may complement other more expensive 

ones and contribute thus to develop affordable smart clothing and wearables. 

The integration of the ground plane on the surface of the substrate changes the dielectric 

properties of the substrate material, increasing its dielectric constant value. This is mainly due 

to the decrease of the thickness of the substrate. Further, a microstrip patch antenna for 

energy harvesting at ISM band was designed and manufactured using the novel knit material 

SIGP I. This antenna presented a great impedance adaptation, proving that the Substrate 

Integrating the Ground Plane is suitable for the development of textile antennas. This result is 

very promising for boosting the industrial fabrication of microstrip patch textile antennas and 

their mass production and dissemination into the IoT network, guiding future developments of 

smart clothing and wearables.

Final Remarks 

 

9.1 General Conclusions 
In the near future, the IoT developments will boost the use of garments which will not only 

communicate social conditions or protect the human body against the extremes of nature, but 

will also provide information and communication tools, will also harvest energy to feed 

wearable systems. Clothes are becoming able to communicate wirelessly without the need of 

large and expensive equipment, neither the need of replacing batteries. This is possible 

because textile technologies can produce new types of flexible devices, such as antennas that 

are small, flexible and inexpensive and can thus be applied in different types of clothing, as 

well as shoes and accessories. Textile antennas have thus been emerged to extend the 

interaction ability of clothing, giving rise to the development of smart cloth. Furthermore, 

planar antennas of the type microstrip patch are antennas secure to use in the vicinity of the 

body as radiate perpendicularly to a ground plane, which shields the antenna radiation, 

ensuring that the human body is exposed only to a very small fraction of the radiation. 

This PhD Thesis focuses on the wearable textile antennas, giving an overview about the 

influence of the textile materials on the performance of textile microstrip patch antennas. 

Such antennas are usually formed by assembling conductive (patch and ground plane) and 

dielectric (substrate) layers. For this reason, the knowledge about the electromagnetic 

properties of textiles and about the assembly manufacturing techniques is crucial. Specific 

electrical highly conductive textiles are available on the market and have been successfully 

used. Ordinary textile fabrics have been used as substrates and it is thus important to study 

and characterize their electromagnetic properties. Woven, knits and nonwovens are 

inhomogeneous, highly porous, compressible and easily influenced by the environmental 

hygrometric conditions, making their electromagnetic characterization difficult. Despite there 

are no standard methods, several authors have been adapting techniques for the dielectric 

characterization of textiles. Thus, this PhD thesis reviews the resonant and non-resonant 

techniques that have been used to characterize the dielectric properties of textiles. Despite 

the resonant techniques only characterize the material in a single frequency, for low-loss 

materials the resonant methods generally provide higher accuracy and sensibility than non-

resonant ones. Some methods require a complex sample preparation, such as the methods of 

transmission lines. Thus, the results obtained through this method can be influenced by the 



 108 

conditions of some variables, as for example, the type of e-textile or conductive metal that is 

used, the used glue/adhesive sheet, the connector and the manufacturing technique to make 

the probe. To alleviate the problems and complexity of the sample preparation and the 

influence of the conductive material on the dielectric characterization process, a new 

Resonator-Based Experimental Technique was presented and performed. 

This method is based on the theory of resonance-perturbation, which consists in computing the 

electromagnetic parameters of the material under test, at a single frequency (2.25 GHz), by 

measuring the shift in the resonance frequency and in the value of the Q-factor of a microstrip 

patch antenna. Eleven textile materials were characterized and the results show differences in 

the ?r values, when placing the face or reverse-side of textiles in contact with the resonator 

board. These differences are due to the air gap between the surface of the material and the 

board. Based on this observation, superficial properties of the textile materials were 

investigated. The results highlight that, as expected, the faces with higher surface roughness 

also present the higher number of pores on the surface. This way, when characterizing textile 

fabrics with the resonator-based experimental technique, placing the faces of higher surface 

roughness in contact with the resonator board results in lower values of ?r. Also, the ?r 

exponentially decreases with the superficial porosity increase. Both of these observed facts 

occur because of the presence of the air on the surface, trapped in the superficial pores. 

Despite the measured value of the dielectric constant ?r differs when placing the face or 

reverse-sides in contact to the resonator board, and is thus influenced by the structure of the 

surface of the MUT, the average value of ?r represents well the bulk material and may be 

considered when designing antennas. The observed superficial differences of the substrate do 

not seem significant for the development of textile antennas, even when using substrates with 

clearly different faces.  

Energy harvesting can be a solution for powering battery-free devices, contributing to the 

growth of wireless wearable devices. In this context, the textile antennas are emerging as the 

solution for feeding low-power devices and/or Wireless Sensors Body Networks, where the 

change of batteries is not easy to perform. This PhD Thesis also presents a dual-band printed 

monopole textile antenna which was developed on the scope of the PROENERGY PROJECT – 

PTDC/EEA-TEL/122681/2010. It can be able to charge low-power devices, as well as extending 

the lifetime of tiny devices by using electromagnetic energy harvested at GSM 900 and DSC 

1800. The printed monopole textile antenna was made using commercially available textiles, 

Zelt® for the conductive parts and Cordura® as dielectric substrate. To improve the performance 

of this antenna, several manufacturing techniques were preliminary tested to identify 

promising techniques and to discard inefficient ones. The results of these tests allow to 

conclude that: 

• Coating technique: applying PU coating on Zelt® reduces significantly the conductivity of the 

conductor Zelt® material and the antenna does not work; 



 109 

• Seam technique: can be considered since non-conductive threads are used to avoid short cuts 

between the patch and the ground plane and the conductive elements are hold and remain in 

the conductive fabric; 

• Gluing technique: textile glue is not strong enough to completely assembly the conductive 

fabrics; 

despite permanent glue and super glue work well, gluing is a problematic technique as it is 

difficult to apply a controlled smooth and continuous coat of glue; 

• Laminating technique: in the laminating technique, a thin adhesive sheet most be used to 

minimise its interference on the permittivity of the dielectric material; 

the presence of the glue of the adhesive sheet affects the sheet resistance of the conductive 

fabric and may decrease it; 

the choice of a patterned adhesive sheet can minimize the discontinuity of the current flow 

and so preserve the conductivity; 

when the conductive material is assembled to the smoother face of the substrate, its sheet 

resistance increases due to the high number of contact points which cause discontinuities on 

the electric current flow; 

the ironing process without steam seems to be preferable as it better preserves the 

electromagnetic performance of the materials; 

additionally, a plain weave woven, such as Zelt®, shows that the orientation of the conductive 

fabric used for the patch does not influence the performance of the laminated antenna.  

• Embroidery technique: is preferable to use stitches that are parallel to the feed line, to 

ensure a continuous current flow; 

the number of stitches in the embroidery may contribute to increase the conductivity of some 

elements, thus improving the performance of the antenna.  

The effective integration of wearable systems contributes to the advance of the IoT. Based on 

the wearability guidelines, the innovative concept of producing textile antennas to integrate 

into clothing by simply manipulating it as an “emblem” has emerged. This concept may improve 

the usage of the wearable technologies. In the future, the wearable antennas might be 

incorporated into textile patterns and drawings, creating fashionable antennas. These 

“emblem” antennas may be easily acceded by the end user, for customization of smart cloth 

for several applications.  

The E-Caption: Smart and Sustainable Coat is the first prototype demonstrating this concept. 

It integrates an “emblem” version of the presented printed monopole textile antenna for 

energy harvesting. In the E-caption, the antenna is manufactured directly on the clothing, 

having a continuous dielectric substrate made with the textile materials composing the coat. 

Therefore, it is shown that a continuous substrate of the antenna does not influence its 

performance. Moreover, the results show that, despite the masses of the coat and of the body 

influence the radiation characteristic of the integrated antenna, the antenna still shows a 

nearly omnidirectional radiation pattern. 



 110 

In order to contribute to the industrialization of textile antennas, based on the results obtained, 

a new continuous Substrate Integrating the Ground Plane was developed (SIGP). It is a novel 

textile material, which is a double fabric that integrates the dielectric substrate and the 

conductive ground plane in a single textile, eliminating thus one laminating step in the 

manufacturing process of microstrip patch antennas. In this thesis, three SIGP were produced 

using two types of conductive yarns, being one a highly conductive yarn well suitable for the 

design of antennas: 

• SIGP I - made using a highly conductive yarn in which all filaments are coated, shows as 

expected the best conductivity result and best performance when tested on antenna; 

• SIGP II - made using a less conductive yarn in which only one plated monofilament is 

conductive; 

• SIGP III - made with a mix of both yarns, it is not conducting enough to be applied on antennas 

as the S11 results show.  

Despite SIGP II and III present too low conductivity for the requirement of antennas, these weft 

knitted spacer fabrics are interesting materials as complement for other functionalities, such 

as electromagnetic shielding, textile switches and other interactive textiles. Being cheaper 

materials, these SIGP II and III fabrics may complement other more expensive ones and 

contribute thus to develop affordable smart clothing and wearables. 

To characterize the dielectric properties of SIGP I, the microstrip resonator patch technique 

was used. The results show that the integration of the ground plane on the surface of the 

substrate changes the dielectric properties of the substrate material, increasing its dielectric 

constant value, ?r. This is mainly due to the decrease of the thickness of the substrate.  

Further, a microstrip patch antenna for energy harvesting at 2.45 GHz was designed and 

manufactured using the SIGP I. This antenna presents a great impedance adaptation, proving 

that the substrate integrating the ground plane (SIGP) is suitable on the development of textile 

antennas. Finally, the integration of the ground plane in the substrate, fabricated through an 

industrial process, may boost the industrial fabrication of microstrip patch textile antennas and 

their mass production. The SIGP associated with the “emblem” antenna concept are important 

contributions giving novel guidelines for the advance of the integration of electronic devices in 

less obtrusive ways. 

9.2 Future Works 
This PhD thesis has established guidelines to integrate antennas into clothing that rise new 

approaches for developing smart clothing. It would be interesting to continue the work of this 

PhD Thesis, merging fashion design to textile engineering in order to create functional and 

fashionable smart clothing which includes antennas. Having these double formations, this is an 

ongoing research for me and the opportunity to undertake business actions.  



 111 

Thus, a new version of E-Caption coat is already under development, as one can see in Appendix 

E. The E-Caption 2.0 – Smart and Safety Coat, is a Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) 

developed to warning the tower climbers to the radiation level exposure. As the first version 

of E-Caption, this coat will be a proof-of-concept of the textile antennas used for energy 

harvesting. 

Until now, the tower climbers carry a portable radiation monitor for exposure to RF and non-

ionizing radiation, that has a LED display, alarm and vibration notifications. Despite the great 

performance of this equipment, it is typically heavy, big (about 200 mm x 150 mm) and 

expensive (between $599.00 and $2.500).  

The E-Caption 2.0 is made using the continuous SIGP III in order to protect the tower climbers 

by shielding the RF radiation. Also, the left front side will be made using the SIGP I, integrating 

a textile RF harvest system manufactured directly on the SIGP. This development is based on 

the System-on-Substrate (SoS) concept [152], [153], where every part of the system is placed 

on the same substrate. Furthermore, several LED’s will be placed in this front of the coat to 

warning the user for the radiation levels.  

The analysis and study of this prototype may go deeper in diverse scientific subjects. After 

finishing the manufacturing process of E-Caption 2.0, measurements of S11 and radiation pattern 

of the textile antenna, on free space and on-body, should be performed. Also, the efficiency 

and wearability of the system may be tested. It would be interesting to analyse the washing 

conditions in order to test the stability of the antenna, and establish the wear and maintenance 

conditions of the SIGP and the assemblies performed. Further, tests of Specific Absorption Rate 

(SAR) may be performed to measure if and how much energy the body absorb from the harvest 

system and to characterise the shielding efficiency of SIGP II.  

This new coat is expected to contribute for the advance of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) 

for tower climbers. The E-Caption 2.0 will be able to disseminate the applicability of textile 

antennas for energy harvesting into clothing, also contributing to the development of wearable 

wireless devices and smart clothing aiming to reach the specific market of PPE 7.

Fundamental Parameters of Antennas   

 

In this PhD Thesis some fundamental parameters of the antennas will be discussed, in order to 

relate the performance of the textile antennas to the textile materials and manufacturing 

techniques. The fundamental parameters of antennas are summarily described in this appendix, 

to support the reading of the thesis. All descriptions of the parameters are based on the IEEE 

Standard Definitions of Terms for Antennas. A more in-depth information and description is 

given in [8], [154]. 

A.1 Evaluation of Antennas  

Along this PhD Thesis, the performance of the antennas will be evaluated through their S11 

parameter and radiation pattern. The S11 parameter is one of the Scattering parameters (S-) 

that describes the input-output relationship between ports, or terminals, in an electrical 

system. The S11 defines the relationship between the injected signal into the antenna and the 

reflected signal, hence is known as the return loss. The reflection of the injected signal occurs 

due to the mismatch of impedances. A minimum return loss is reached when there is a perfect 

adaptation of the impedance of the antenna. The S11 is measured using a Vector Analyser 

Network (VNA), which is an instrument that measures the network parameters of electrical 

networks. The VNA measures both amplitude and phase properties of networks. Figure A-1 

presents an example of a VNA measuring the return loss of a textile antenna, at the Department 

of Technology Information at Ghent University, in Belgium.  

The radiation pattern is the spatial distribution of a quantity that characterizes the 

electromagnetic field generated by an antenna. This distribution can be expressed as a 

mathematical function or as a graphical representation. The quantities that are most often 

used to characterize the radiation from an antenna are proportional to or equal to power flux 

density, radiation intensity, directivity, phase, polarization, and field strength. 

Also, the radiation pattern is measured at the anechoic chamber. It is a room designed to 

completely absorb reflections of either sound or electromagnetic waves. It is also often isolated 

from waves entering from its surroundings. Figure A-2 shows an example of an anechoic 

chamber at Instituto de Telecomunicações – Aveiro.

A.2 Parameters of antennas 

Input Impedance - The input impedance of an antenna is presented by an antenna at its 

terminals. The input impedance is the ratio between the voltage and the input current. Usually, 

has a real part associated with the radiated power and the dissipated power in the antenna, 

and an imaginary part constituted by the reactive power stored around the antenna. This 

parameter is defined by the geometry and the way to feed the antenna. Typically, the antennas 

and RF circuits are designed to have an input impedance of 50 ?. Also, the impedance mismatch 



 127 

factor is associated with the Scattering parameters (S-) explained in A.1, and is defined by the 

ratio of the power accepted by an antenna to the power incident at the antenna’s terminals 

from the transmitter.  

Bandwidth – Is the range of frequencies within which the performance of the antenna conforms 

to a specified standard with respect to some characteristic. In the case of planar antennas, 

such as the ones presented in this thesis, the typical bandwidth can be defined as the range of 

frequencies which return loss is less than one tenth of the injected signal into the antenna. 

That is, all frequencies whose value of the S11 parameter is below -10dB. 

Resonance Frequency - A frequency at which the input impedance of an antenna is 

nonreactive.  

Directivity - The ratio of the radiation intensity in a given direction from the antenna to the 

radiation intensity averaged over all directions.?If the direction is not specified, the direction 

of maximum radiation intensity is implied.  

Gain - Although the gain of the antenna is closely related to the directivity, it is a measure that 

takes into account the efficiency of the antenna as well as its directional capabilities. Gain of 

the antenna is defined by the ratio of the radiation intensity in a given direction to the radiation 

intensity that would be produced if the power accepted by the antenna were isotropically 

radiated. Also, If the direction is not specified, the direction of maximum radiation intensity is 

implied.

Experiments with Cork 

 

C.1 Dielectric Characterization 

During the Short Term Scientific Mission (STSM), in the framework of the European Cooperation 

in Science and Technology (COST) – Project IC 1301 – Wireless Power Transmission for 

Sustainable Electronics (WIPE), realized in the Department of Information Technology at Ghent 

University (Belgium), besides the textile materials, several cork materials were also 

characterized.  

Cork was chosen due to their intrinsic characteristics, such as flexibility, non permeability to 

liquids and gases, thermal and electrical insulating. Also, cork is an emblematic material of 

Portugal, being this STSM a great opportunity to explore other applications for it. Further, on 

the past decade, several fashion products were emerged using cork materials. 

Five cork sheet materials were characterized using the Resonator-Based Experimental Method, 

following the procedure presented on Chapter 4, at 2.25 GHz. Table B-1 presents the average 

values of measured permittivity and the characteristics of the tested corks. Thickness was 

characterized using Kawabata’s Evaluation System for Fabrics, KES – 3 Compressional Tester, 

at UBI.

C.2 Validation 

In order to validate the results, a coaxial antenna to resonate at 2.45 GHz, using cork 3 as 

dielectric substrate, was designed. For the conductive parts, Pure copper taffeta fabric (Less 

EMF Inc., Latham, USA), with sheet resistance = 0.05 ?/? and thickness equal to 0.080 mm, 
was used. The antenna was assembled using the Adhesive Sheet II (see Table 6-4). Figure C-1 



 134 

presents the design and dimensions of the coaxial cork antenna, and Figure C-2 shows the 

measured return loss. 

 

Figure C-1 Design and dimensions of coaxial cork antenna for 2.45 GHz 

 

 
Figure C-2 Measured S11 of coaxial cork antenna 

Based on the return loss parameter presented in Figure B-2, one may observe the measured 

coaxial cork antenna works well at 2.44 GHz, that is in agreement with the simulated resonance 

frequency (2.45 GHz). Further, one may conclude that the Resonator-Based Experimental 

Technique is also suitable to characterize the permittivity of other planar materials, at 2.25 

GHz, such as cork composites.   

C.3 Experiments at 5 GHz  

During the STSM, cork 3 was also characterized, using the Resonator-Based Experimental 

Technique, at 5 GHz. The obtained average values were ?r = 1,3571 and tan? = 0,0089.  



 135 

In order to validate these results, two coaxial antennas, with the same dimensions (see Figure 

B-3) were manufactured using the Copper taffeta fabric for the conductive parts, feed by a 

SMA connector. The antennas were designed to resonate at 5 GHz and Figure B-4 shows the 

measured S11. 

 

Figure C-3 Design and dimensions of coaxial cork antenna for 5 GHz (a) front (b) rear 

 

 
Figure C-4 Measured return loss of coaxial cork antennas (prototype 1 – red line and prototype 2, blue 

line) 

As one can see on Figure B-4, the manufactured antennas presented very different results, and 

thus the obtained ?r values do not well characterize the material. At this frequency, 5 GHz, the 

cork composite has shown an instable electromagnetic behaviour, and due to the naturally high 

superficial porosity of cork, it is not compatible to the Resonator-Based Experimental 

Technique. 

Further, cork 3 was characterize at 5 GHz, using the method explained on [155] and the an 

antenna combining cork substrate and conductive fabric was designed and published in [70].

Preliminary Tests of Integration of Textile Antenna 

on Cloth 

 

The first experiment to integrate a textile antenna on cloth was performed at Ghent University, 

during the STSM reference IC1301-18709. A miniaturised textile antenna was made using the 

Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) technique. This Quarter-Mode wearable antenna has a 

compact dimension, and has been excellent for off-body communications. Also, this antenna is 

an adaptation of the wearable antenna presented in [67], using protective foam as dielectric 

substrate.  

In this version, 3D fabric II is used for the substrate and Pure copper taffeta fabric is uded for 

the conductive parts. The antenna was assembled using the Adhesive Sheet II. The waveguides 

were hand made using manual embroidering technique [152], with Silverpam conductive yarn 

(see Table 6-7) . The antenna was designed for 2.4 GHz ISM band. Figure D-1 shows the Quarter-

Mode SIW textile antenna.

Due to the small size of the antenna, a glove was designed to integrate this antenna. In order 

to facilitate the measurements, a front pocket was created to place the antenna. Also, a 

structure using Styrofoam was made to stabilise the glove during the measurements, as one can 

see on Figure D-2.  

 
(a)                                                                   (b) 

Figure D-2 Styrofoam support to stabilise the glove during the measurements. In (a) antenna stand-
alone (b) on the glove 

For the first time, the results between a stand-alone and integrated antenna were compared. 

Figure D-3 presents the measured return loss and Figure D-4 shows the 3D radiation pattern. 

Both measurements were performed in the anechoic chamber on Department of Technology 

Information at Ghent University.

glove – blue line

Figure D-4 3D radiation pattern of Quarter-Mode SIW textile antenna (a) stand-alone and (b) on glove 

As one can see in Figures D-3 the integration process does not influence the performance of 

the antenna. In fact, both measurements gave similar results, both antennas work at 2.52 GHz, 

covering the ISM band, and the efficiency of the antenna is 0.5026 for the stand-alone, and 

0.5056 for the integrated antenna. Also,  observing Figure D-4, is possible see that the radiation 

pattern still being clearly omnidirectional even after the integration on the glove.
