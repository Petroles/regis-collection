Primary gold deposits in Portugal- "mesothermal" or epithermal?

CARLOS M. c. INVERNO*

Key-words: Epithennal; "mesothermal"; intrusion-related; gold; deposits; Portugal.

Abstract: The concepts of epithermal, "mesothennal" and intrusion-related gold deposits are briefly reviewed. Their possible application to
primary gold deposits and occurrences in the Ossa Morena, Central Iberian and Galiza- Tras-os-Montes zones in Portugal is discussed.

Palavras-chave: Epitennal; "mesotermal"; associado a intrusao; ouro; jazigos; Portugal.
