RESUMO  

Este trabalho apresenta duas maneiras inovadoras de avaliar projetos de mineração. 
A primeira é a elaboração e aplicação do modelo tecnológico para uma mina de cobre 
e ouro já a segunda refere-se à confecção de um modelo de tomada de decisão a ser 
usado para a análise dos benefícios de aplicação de britagem semimóvel em cava. 
Para melhorar os processos e maximizar a produção e/ou o valor de um projeto de 
mineração, existe a necessidade de integração dos dados de geologia, planejamento 
de mina, beneficiamento e geometalurgia. Com esse foco, uma nova metodologia foi 
proposta para a criação do modelo tecnológico. Este modelo pode ser interpretado 
como a consolidação dos diferentes modelos necessários para uma melhor 
compreensão das informações geológicas e técnicas do depósito. Este conceito foi 
desenvolvido e aplicado em uma mina de cobre de ouro localizada no Brasil. Com base 
na avaliação de diferentes cenários de perfuração e desmonte de rochas e de 
produtividade do moinho, usando uma abordagem de mina-usina, foi possível obter 
ganhos operacionais de curto prazo, tais como um aumento de 10,7% na taxa de 
produção de usina e um aumento de 2,2% na taxa de alimentação da britagem com 
pouco ou nenhum investimento de capital. Uma outra questão relevante para 
empresas de mineração é o transporte de material. Um custo significativo na maioria 
das minas surge da compra e manutenção de caminhões de transporte. A britagem 
em cava e correias (IPCC em inglês) vem sido avaliada em diversos casos devido ao 
seu potencial para reduzir os custos de transporte. Neste estudo, um modelo de 
tomada de decisão foi criado para identificar em etapas iniciais de um projeto os 
benefícios de aplicação de IPCC semimóvel (SMIPCC em inglês) em comparação com 
método convencional, exclusivamente por caminhões. O método baseia-se na análise 
de custos e na avaliação de impactos ambientais testado em uma mina a céu aberto, 
onde os resultados indicaram que o SMIPCC foi a opção mais econômica para a 
operação. Embora o investimento inicial do IPCC foi 60% maior do que a abordagem 
convencional, o custo operacional do IPCC foi 43% menor, resultando em uma 
redução de 28% do custo total a valor presente.

ABSTRACT  

This work presents two innovative ways to evaluate mining projects. The first is the 
application of a Technological Model in a copper-gold mine and the second is a 
decision making model to evaluate the benefit of semi-mobile in pit crusher and 
conveyor alternatives during the early stages of mining projects. In order to improve 
the process and to maximize the production and/or value of a mining project, there 
needs to be an integration of the geology, the mine plan, the processing and the 
geometallurgy data. In order to accomplish this, a new methodology is proposed for 
the creation of a technological model. This model can be interpreted as the 
consolidation of the different models required for a better understanding of the 
geological and technical information of the deposit. This concept was developed and 
applied at a copper and gold mine site located in Brazil. Based on the evaluation of 
different blasting and mill productivity scenarios through a pit-to-plant approach, it was 
possible to obtain operational short-term gains such as a 10.7% increase in the plant 
production rate and a 2.2% increase in the crusher’s feed rate with little or no capital 
investment. Another important issue faced by mining companies is related to material 
handling. A significant cost in the operating budget of most mining operations arises 
from purchasing and maintaining haulage trucks. Recently, in-pit crushing and 
conveying (IPCC) has been subject to research because of its potential to reduce 
haulage costs. A decision-making model was created to identify early on in a project 
whether or not the semi-mobile IPCC (SMIPCC) is an appropriate alternative to the 
conventional truck haulage based on the loading and hauling approaches. The method 
is based on cost analysis and the evaluation of environmental impacts, being 
successfully tested at an existing open-pit mine, where the results indicated that the 
IPCC was the most cost-effective option for the operation. Although the IPCC’s initial 
CAPEX was 60% higher than the conventional approach, the IPCC’s OPEX was 43% 
lower, resulting in a 28% reduction of the life-of-mine net present cost (NPC). 

  
Key words: Strategic mine planning. Pit-to-plant. Technological model. Geometallurgy. 
Semi-mobile IPCC. Cost saving. CO reduction.

1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 

  
The strategic mine plan is a crucial step for the success of mining companies 

and for its development it is necessary to use a number of inter-related variables that 

are usually estimated independently. These variables include operational data that is 

traditionally isolated in information islands between the different departments in the 

mine or they are consolidated into individual models. This reduces the holistic view of 

the deposit thereby causing a negative impact on the results of the strategic planning 

itself. In order to improve the process and to maximize the production and/or value of 

a mining project, there needs to be an integration of the geology, the mine plan, the 

processing and the geometallurgy data.   

Another important issue faced by mining companies is related to material 

handling. A significant cost in the operating budget of most mining operations arises 

from purchasing and maintaining haulage trucks. Recently, in-pit crushing and 

conveying (IPCC) has been subject to research because of its potential to reduce 

haulage costs, however its is normally considered as an alternative during later stages 

of the project development, in feasibility studies. A tool to analyse it during early stages 

of a mining project can be very helpful as it has the potential to reduce an enormous 

amount of engineering hours that in many cases is applied to the project that does not 

have the propensity for semi-mobile IPCC application (SMIPCC).    

This study presents two innovative ways to evaluate mining projects. The first is 

the development of a Technological Model applied to a copper-gold mining project. 

This methodology integrates the geometallurgy and the mine-to-mill concept aimed to 

optimize mill productivity. The second is the creation and use of a decision-making 

model in the early stage of Front End Loading (FEL) studies of a Mining Project.   

The first innovative way to evaluate mining projects, the technological model 

can be interpreted as the consolidation of the different models required for a better 

understanding of the geological and technical information of the deposit. This concept 

was developed and applied at a copper and gold mine site located in Brazil together 

with the consultant support of Metso. Based on the evaluation of different blasting and 

mill productivity scenarios through a pit-to-plant approach, it was possible to obtain 

operational short-term gains as the plant and crusher’s feed rate increased. 



11  
  

The second innovative way to evaluate mining projects, the decision-making 

model to evaluate the SMIPCC benefit is based on cost analysis and the evaluation of 

environmental impacts. It was successfully tested at an existing open-pit mine, where 

the results indicated that the IPCC was the most cost-effective option for the operation. 

 

1.1. OBJECTIVES  

  
• To develop a methodology for the creation and application of the technological 

model for a copper-gold deposit;  

• To technically evaluate the use of the decision-making model to assess the benefits 

of a semi-mobile in-pit crushing and conveying alternative during the early stages 

of a mining project.

MODELS FOR STRATEGIC MINE PLANNING OF COPPER AND GOLD 
DEPOSITS  

  

 
2.1. INTRODUCTION  

  
This research topic is part of an article to be published by the author in 20191. 

The strategic planning of a mine is a crucial step for the success of mining companies, 

since it provides the necessary information for the decision-making process concerning 

the development of the deposit (SILVA, 2008). Therefore, in terms of strategic mine 

planning, it is important that the uncertainty related to the orebody is properly 

quantified, assessed, and managed (GODOY, 2018). For the preparation of the 

strategic mine plan, it is necessary to use models and data that are often estimated 

independently.  

The technological model presented in this manuscript aims to solve the 

disconnected and in many times, inaccurate view of the deposit. This new approach 

consolidates the different data used to gain a better understanding of the geological, 

mine planning and processing data of the project. Lund and Lamberg (2014) state that 

the construction of technological models can reduce operational risks and could help 

to optimize the production, taking into account sustainability and socio-economic 

factors. 

The data that is being referred to in this study includes the resource and 

structural models, the geometallurgical model, the cost model and the operating 

Selective Mining Unit (SMU) model, which is the smallest volume of material that the 

classification of ore and waste can be determined (SINCLAIR; BLACKWELL, 2002).

The Geometallurgical model, a component of the technological model, allows 

for a better understanding of the ore characteristics. The importance of this increased 

knowledge base is that by knowing the strength, structure, and grade, there are 

adjustments that can be made to the crushing, grinding, and flotation processes (LA 

ROSA et al., 2014). 

Gomes et al. (2016) used a geometallurgical model to support an economic 

study considering reserve volumes, product quality and operational cost. From the 

model remarkable gains were obtained in the iron ore reserve and in the reduction of 

the operation cost. Its use is also essential to strategic mining planning for mines that 

seek to optimize the use of mining resources over the life of mine (PHILANDER;  

ROZENDAAL, 2014). Navarra et al. (2018) incorporated the geometallurgical 

modelling in long-term planning and confirmed its great impact on the life of mine.   

As noted by Augustin et al. (2017) the models should continually be updated 

whenever possible, by way of additional exploratory drill holes, to ensure that a greater 

detail of accuracy is achieved. Nadolski et al. (2015) complement that these models 

require constant adjustment, with the insertion of the geotechnical, geological, 

metallurgical and other operational data from the plant, which will also serve to calibrate 

predictive models.    

The development process for the preparation of the technological model in 

question, used the work undertaken at a large-scale copper and gold open-pit mine of 

sulphide ore located in Brazil, as a reference. This work was carried out between the 

mine and the consultant expertise of Metso (2014). The process includes crushing, 

grinding, and flotation. The saleable product is a copper-gold concentrate.  

In the studied mine, the ore comes from different mining faces feeding the plant 

at the same time. The technological model created tracked the ore characteristics back 

to its original mining face. One of the main objectives of the technological model was 

to determine the plant performance by the ore domain on an industrial scale and, to 

adjust the blasting parameters aiming to increase the plant throughput but keeping the 

metallurgical recoveries at similar or higher levels. This concept of pit-to-plant 

optimization has been used at other mine sites around the world where different 

processes of integration and optimization were applied (JANKOVIC; VALERY, 2011).

2.2. METHODOLOGY  

  
As a starting point for the model, the different unit operations of the mine and 

plant were characterized. Blasting designs, mine and plant sampling, and operational 

testing were carried out. The data obtained was used to develop the specific models 

for the prediction processes of blasting, crushing, and grinding. These models were 

the basis of the construction of the technological model. Figure 1 summarizes the 

components of the technological model.

The methodology used for the preparation of the technological model is based 

on the following steps: 

• Characterization and delineation of areas based on their geological structure, 

strength, and correlation with their lithological and structural domains.   

• Establishing operating restrictions such as the stability of benches, the presence of 

water, SMU size, ore dilution allowance, the blast pile characteristics, the size of 

the equipment, and the size/power of the crushers/mills, in addition to any other 

bottlenecks in the process. 

• Defining the main requirements of the subsequent steps to plan for each geological 

domain in order to meet their specific requirements. 

• Use of software, mathematical models, and process simulation. 

•Structural Geology/ Lithology/ Alterations 
•Grades 
•Geotechnical Parameters for mine design

Resource and Structural Model

•Metallurgical Recoveries
•Hardness
•Plant Productivity for different litho-structural domains

Geometallurgical Model

•Operational cost estimates for the mine, plant, etc by litho-
structural domains

•Creation of SMUs based on planned mining and dilution methods

Cost Model and SMU

• Implementation and monitoring of the defined operational strategy (suitable plans 

for each domain followed by the ideal adjustment for the crushing and grinding 

cycle). 

• Analysis and management of data and results. 

• Project implementation and maintaining the benefits obtained. 

The above methodology is simplified in the Figure 2.

         Source: Modified from PIO (Mine to Mill) – Metso, 2014 

 

 The first step required an audit to be carried out during the drilling and blasting 

operations. This was necessary in order to obtain data, pictures, and other 

observations that are required to provide enough information for the creation of the 

fragmentation models. Once the information is obtained, the blasting techniques can 

be tailored to the rock characteristics, which will allow for substantial improvements in 

the downstream operations (KANCHIBOLTA et al., 2015). 

Simulations of the blasting plan were executed with both the soft and hard ore. 

Various parameters were changed depending on the simulation. Compared to the base 

case these variations included, a slight increase in bench height, an increase in hole 

diameter, a change in spacing, sub drilling, hole depth, stemming, and an increase in 

the column charge. 

In the second phase of the preparation of the technological model, laboratory 

tests, image analyses, data processing, and mathematical models were consolidated. 

In order to optimize the ROM fragmentation from the mine blasting, a fragmentation 

model was developed. This model is sensitive to the main parameters that affect the 

blasting performance. The fragmentation model was then calibrated with the data 



16  
  

obtained from the observed blasting during the audit process and used to predict 

changes in the particle size distribution of the ROM. 

 
2.2.1. Fragmentation Measurement Using Image Analysis 

                              

Particle size distribution of the ROM is one of the parameters used in calibrating 

the fragmentation model. Prior studies of operations around the world have indicated 

that image analysis is a good and practical method for this purpose. Photographs of 

the piles formed after the verified blasting and primary crushing were processed using 

the Split-Desktop software (SPLIT ENGINEERING, 2017). Each image contains an 

object for scale. For this project, two Styrofoam balls were used and are pictured in 

Figure 3.

2.2.2. Blast Tracking 
 

Electronic tags were used to track the blasted material, enabling the verification 

of when the material enters the crushing/grinding cycle. Therefore, the complete 

sampling of the plant could be performed using the audited blasted material. Samples 

collected from the conveyor belts and the main streams for laboratory tests determined 

the breaking characteristics of the material. Specific models were developed for the 

blasting, crushing, grinding, and classification processes by using the audited blast 

data, sampling, and testing. Figure 4 shows the electronic tag with a diameter of 60mm 

and a height of 30mm used in the study as well as the typical installation of the 

electronic tag system with an antenna positioned above the conveyor belt.

  In total 274 electronic tags were used in the survey data. They were put in the 

stem, in the piles formed after detonation, and in the feed of each primary crusher. In 

order to obtain the data for calibrating the mathematical models for the different 

equipment in the circuit, sampling was performed in the crushing and grinding circuit. 

Operational data was also collected during the sampling to determine the production 

rates and power consumption of each piece of equipment listed in Table 1. The 

sampling points are shown in the flowchart in Figure 5. Once the sampling was 

complete, the data was balanced and modelling was performed in the JKSimMet 

software (JKTECH, 2014).

After the completion of the mass balancing, the mathematical models of all the 

processing units were calibrated according to the Anderson and Awachie model for the 

primary crushers in the JKSimMet software version 6.0 (JKTECH, 2014) and Whiten 

(Whiten and White, 1979). The objective was to model the grinding cycle at the time of 

sampling. The perfect blend model and the variable rate model were adjusted to the 

ball and SAG mills, respectively. The cyclones were adjusted using Nageswararao’s 

model (NAGESWARARAO, 1995). 

Using the balanced flow data, that includes the mass flow rate, the percentage 

of dry solids, and the particle size distribution, the models could be adjusted with 

respect to the parameters of each specific operation. Other information taken into 

account were the characteristics of the ore, the dimensions of the equipment, and the 

information related to the operation during sampling, which includes the load and 

speed levels of the mills, the energy consumption, and the operating pressure of the 

cyclones. Historical data was also considered to ensure that the results are consistent 

and that they represent the operation of the cycle as accurately as possible. 

 
 

2.3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  

                             
In total there were 24 blasting simulations carried out. Eleven of those 

simulations were performed on soft ore, and the remaining thirteen, which are shown 

below, were carried out on hard ore. Once the simulations were complete, one of the 

thirteen (base case) was selected to be applied to the blasting plan in the field. The 

hard ore simulations are presented in the Table 2 below.

The use of electronic tags in the blasted material proved to be effective in 

tracking the ore from the mine to the plant and assured that the audited blasted material 

was fed to the plant during sampling. During the 34-hour monitoring period, 131 

electronic tags out of the 274 were detected. The spatial coordinates of each detected 

electronic tag are shown in Figure 6 below.

After the completion of the plant sampling and gathering of the experimental 

data, the model could be created. The mass balancing results compared well to the 

experimental data, indicating that the sampling data is valid for further analysis. In 

general, the models developed in JKSimMet (JKTECH, 2014) were well adjusted with 

respect to the data, and are considered appropriate for long-term simulation studies 

that are to be used in strategic mine planning. The experimental and modelled data 

can be compared in Table 3 below.

The results of the rock blasting simulations demonstrated the importance of 

improving the results of fragmentation, especially when analysing the productivity of 

an integrated comminution process for harder lithology. There was a 37% reduction in 

the production rate of the SAG (2026 to 1269 t/h) when the circuit supply consisted 

only of hard material. Under this same condition, increasing the powder factor to 2.78 

kg/m3 resulted in an increase in the mill’s productivity by 10.7%. This result directly 



23  
  

relates to the finer particle size distribution obtained from the increased energy in the 

rocks from the blasting.  

The SAG cycle improves with an increase in the load (the percent of mill volume 

occupied by media plus voids) from 8% mill balls (measured after grinding) to 10-13% 

mill balls. These changes allowed the grinding circuit to increase to within 2-4% of the 

productivity achieved with the largest open area. In order to better utilize the installed 

power of the pebble crushers, SAG mill grates with larger openings were installed. 

When comparing the scenario to the finer ROM, the simulation resulted in a 14% 

increase in pebble generation, while the feed rate increased by 2.2%. It is important to 

note that by increasing the opening of the grate, the grate life is shortened. Therefore, 

it was suggested to find alternatives in order to minimize the wear on the grate.  

 An outcome of this methodology, the technological model, has shown to be 

adherent to the plant results and operational data collected after many reconciliation 

processes. This methodology is still in use at the mine, which constantly updates the 

model with the new input data.

3. A DECISION MAKING-METHOD TO ASSESS THE BENEFITS OF A SEMI-
MOBILE IN-PIT CRUSHING AND CONVEYING ALTERNATIVE DURING THE 
EARLY STAGES OF A MINING PROJECT  

  
  

3.1. INTRODUCTION 

  
This research topic is part of an article to be published by the author in 20192. 

One of the challenges while evaluating the early stages of open pit mining projects is 

to determine which of the alternatives for material transportation and which location for 

the primary crusher should be considered for further detailed studies and scenario 

selection. A parallel study between the alternative of the conventional truck haulage 

with the primary crusher located outside of the pit and the in-pit crushing and conveying 

alternative can be a long, expensive process. Mining companies with portfolios that 

contain many open pit projects usually face issues in evaluating the benefits of an IPCC 

implementation due to the massive workload and time necessary for completion. 

Properly evaluating these alternatives is important since the haulage costs in open pit 

mines can be 60% or more of the mine’s operating cost (RIBEIRO, 2013). IPCC 

systems are now receiving more attention due to the rising cost of the truck haulage 

cycles, which can be attributed to the cost of diesel and spare parts, leading to the 

IPCC being the favourable option. In contrast, the IPCC is considered a low-cost 

alternative in terms of operating costs due to its continuous operation regime, reduced 

labour, and lower energy consumption, but it requires a high capital cost, and has 

reduced flexibility (LONDOÑO et al. 2014).       

There have been studies carried out in the past proposing the use of SMIPCC 

systems as an alternative to conventional trucking and regular IPCC systems, where 

the crusher is fully mobile and only a conveyor is used for haulage.

the early stages of a mining project.  REM – International Engineering Journal. Published in 2019-(2)

A SMIPCC can exploit the advantages of both systems, conventional trucking 

and fully mobile IPCC, but it is important to ensure that the in-pit crusher is at an 

appropriate distance from the work front and that its location will be suitable for at least 

one year of operation before it needs to be moved (RAHMANPOUR et al. 2014). 

SMIPCC systems are considered flexible and adaptable because of the continuous 

use of trucks and being able to install a crusher in a suitable location (NEHRING et al. 

2018). The majority of studies that compare IPCC with truck based haulage systems 

using conveyors, result in large operational savings due to a more efficient energy and 

capital allocation.  

Although the IPCC concept is not new, as it was introduced in the 1950’s in 

Germany (RITTER et al. 2014), companies are still concerned with the implementation 

of such an alternative due to the high risk involved. Another issue is that it is not as 

simple as choosing a particular haulage system; one also needs to know how to adapt 

it to the mine plan to ensure a reduction in the overall mining costs. Therefore, the 

uniqueness of a project poses a contractual constraint, as no pre-made off-the-shelf 

options are available (DEAN et al. 2015).     

Furthermore, from environmental licensing process standpoint, the method 

used for decision-making can be a relevant tool to be used before going through the 

preliminary environmental licensing process, so that the SMIPCC alternative can be 

considered to demonstrate a reduction in environmental impact.   

To get a better understanding of the IPCC alternative, a new method is proposed 

that aims to estimate the technical, economic, and environmental benefits of the semi-

mobile IPCC alternative from an early project stage. The proposed approach has been 

tested using data from the initial design studies (PMI, 2013) of an open-pit copper-gold 

mine located in Brazil.     

 
 

3.2. METHODOLOGY  

  
The method was designed as a model that uses the data available from the early 

stages of the evaluation of mining projects, usually from the scoping studies, as its 

input parameters. The model analyses both the conventional trucking and the SMIPCC 

scenarios. In order to properly estimate the truck requirements, production capacities, 



26  
  

and costs, the following should be calculated: truck payload, engine powering and 

propulsion, cycle time estimations, and production rates (HUSTRULID et al. 2013). 

The input can be classified into the following groups:  

• Material: the material itself, in situ density, and swell factor; 

• Truck Size: to be chosen from a payload of either 100, 150, 200, or 250 short 

tonnes; 

• Operating: average haulage distance (flat, uphill, and downhill), rolling resistance, 

grade, speed limit, typical fixed times for spotting, dumping, and waiting, primary 

crushing P80 and design safety factor, working hours, hourly efficiency, conveyor’s 

average speed, length, and elevation; 

• Production: throughput, and life-of-mine; 

• Economic: operating costs, discount rate, and exchange rate (if applicable). 

The input models considered for the evaluation of the conventional trucking and 

the SMIPCC scenarios remain unchanged, with the exception of:    

• Operating: Haulage distance (flat, uphill, and downhill) considering the location of 

the semi-mobile in-pit crusher, the conveyor average speed, length, and elevation; 

•  Economic: capital and operating costs, considering the capital and operating costs 

resulting from the implementation of the conveyor, reduction of the haulage fleet, 

and relocation of the semi-mobile in-pit crusher. 

It is important to highlight the three assumptions used in this model:   

(1) The mine’s throughput and, consequently, the life of mine for the conventional and 

SMIPCC scenarios remain the same, given that only the haulage fleet and the 

conveyor’s input must be changed from one scenario to the other; 

(2) The truck payload (referred to below as the truck size) is an input parameter instead 

of a calculated one and is then used to select the loading equipment. This method 

is the reverse of the conventional fleet selection method. The payload relates to 

known off-road truck models that cover most mine operation cases; 

(3) Since both alternatives use the same number of excavators, the excavator CAPEX 

and OPEX were not included in the economic analysis and calculations because 

their costs will be equal. 

 



27  
  

The model continues the analysis as follows: 

(1) Truck and auxiliary equipment fleet dimensioning;  

(2) Conveyor dimensioning;  

(3) Economic Analysis; 

(4) Environmental Impact Analysis. 

 

The method proposed in the article aims to be a tool to help in deciding on the 

best type of transport alternative to be used. It includes important topics such as the 

transportation scenario for the open pit mine, a comparison between the conventional 

model and the SMIPCC, and the economic feasibility and sustainability of each 

scenario. 

 The truck fleet size is determined by evaluating the model that is based on the 

mine’s production capacity and operating parameters, specifically, the average 

haulage distance (AHD). These two factors are very important as they hold great 

weight in the decision to use the IPCC system (NEHRING et al. 2018). By selecting 

the truck size (model) from one of the four options, the number of trucks is calculated, 

as well as the number of bulldozers and motor graders required (Figure 7). It is worth 

mentioning that, because the transportation model considered in this study is a 

SMIPCC, it is still necessary to use trucks to move the material from the mining face 

to the in-pit crusher, where it will then be crushed and loaded onto the conveyors 

(MCCARTHY, 2011; MOHAMMADI et al. 2011).   

Therefore, only the AHD from the mining face to the in-pit crusher is considered 

in the SMIPCC sizing, whereas the entire route is considered for the conventional 

model. In Figure 7, the AHD node indicated by [1] is subject to change based on the 

material transport alternative selected. The output nodes, indicated by [2], can be 

determined by using a rule of thumb based on the required truck units of one bulldozer 

for every 20 trucks and one motor grader for every 15 trucks, with a minimum of one 

unit in both cases.

The conveyor’s characteristics, such as the width, the power of the required 

motor, and the data to calculate the SMIPCC installation costs, are selected based on 

the material characteristics and operating parameters, such as the P80 for the primary 

crusher, and the mine production data (OSMETTI et al., 2012; BERTINSHAW et al., 

2012) (Figure 8). Also in Figure 8, refer to Osmetti et al. (2012), and Bertinshaw et al. 



29  
  

(2012), for three of the input parameter nodes, [3], in order to determine the conveyor 

dimensioning.    

The economic analysis of the mine for the two alternatives is performed 

considering these inputs. All the costs are included in this analysis and are separated 

into capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operating expenditure (OPEX) throughout the 

life of the mine (LOM). The costs are brought to the present value based on the 

discount rate(s) selected, resulting in the present value of the cost (NPC) (Figure 9).

   Using the discount rate when evaluating mining projects serves the same 

purpose as it does when evaluating projects in other fields: it considers the time value 

of money and the project risk (ATAEE-POUR et al., 2009). Since each project involves 

a different set of risks, the discount rates analysed in each one will be different. Product 

standards for nodes [4] are used for the input parameters. These standards were based 

on the truck cost, freight cost, and the import tax associated to it. In addition to the 

discount rate and the LOM, the total OPEX for the conveyor [5] also considers 

relocating the in-pit crusher and the cost of the conveyor’s electricity consumption. 



30  
  

  The model also proposes comparison of each scenario’s environmental 

analysis on gas emissions. Based on the previously sized fleet, the amount of 

equipment and the type of engine is assessed and the tonnage of gases emitted during 

the LOM is calculated based on the EPA`s Tier 4 Standard (US EPA 2004). The gases 

being analysed are the following: carbon monoxide (CO), non-methane hydrocarbons, 

(NMHC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM) (Figure 10).

3.3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  

  

Data from a Brazilian copper-gold mine was used for for this analysis. This study 

was implemented for a conceptual study based on the Project Management Body of 

Knowledge (PMI 2013). This decision-making process can be applied to any open pit 

mining project, as long as the specifications for each project are incorporated.    

The life of mine was set as 20 years with an annual production of 16 million tons 

using 150-short ton trucks (Table 5). The AHD for the two alternatives was 1.6km. In 

the case of the SMIPCC scenario, the trucks travel 0.5km from the mining face to the 

in-pit crusher (IPC), and then for the next 1.1km, the material is transported by the 



31  
  

conveyor to the transfer chute. In the conventional scenario, the trucks travel the entire 

1.6km along the ramp that closely follows the conveyor’s profile, to a crusher that would 

be located near the indicated transfer chute in Figure 11.

The cost values for the mine were obtained by compiling the above data from 

the previous two tables with the initial data from the mine (Table 8). A noticeable 

difference in the initial CAPEX (before year 3) is that the SMIPCC installation is 

approximately 60% higher than the conventional scenario. This is due to the high 

installation cost of the crusher and conveyor belt.   

However, the sustaining CAPEX (after year 3) for the conventional alternative is 

more than two times greater than that of the SMIPCC, due to the need for fleet 

replacement. Furthermore, when considering the OPEX, for the conventional case 

without including the discount rate, it is about 43% greater than that of the SMIPCC 

because of high maintenance costs, tires, fuel, and labour.

The net present cost (NPC) is an important factor for a project. In this study, five 

different discount rates were taken into account, which expanded the possible number 

of scenarios. The considered discount rates were 0.0%, 2.5%, 5.0%, 7.5%, and 10.0%. 

The values obtained from using a discount rate of 5% are presented above (Table 8). 

It shows that the NPC for the conventional alternative is about 50 million dollars more 

expensive than using the semi-mobile IPCC. When considering the total cost per ton 

(CAPEX &amp;amp; OPEX), the SMIPCC has a value almost 34% lower than that of the 

conventional alternative (Table 9).

The results of the environmental analysis were also very insightful. During the 

LOM, when opting for only using trucks, the carbon monoxide emissions are more than 

double that of the SMIPCC alternative (Table 10). The additional emissions are due to 

the high number of trucks required for the conventional trucking compared to the 

SMIPCC. For the examined mine, eight trucks are needed for the strictly trucking 

alternative, whereas when using the SMIPCC, only three trucks are needed. Therefore, 

the results also corroborate that the IPCC alternatives are also a means of reducing 

carbon emissions (MCCARTHY, 2011; COOPER; TURNBULL, 2009).

3.3.1. Discussion 
 

The expected result of the decision-making method presented was to conclude 

on which alternative should be selected while considering the proposed parameters, 

the OPEX, the CAPEX, the NPC, and the environmental analysis. Achieving this result 

was successful. The evaluation method allowed for a broader view of the importance 

of such variables in the decision-making process. In the discussed case, the SMIPCC 

alternative resulted in a lower sustaining CAPEX and OPEX, as well as a lower cost 

per tonne compared to the conventional alternative. There were also environmental 

benefits from using the SMIPCC system: the amount of carbon monoxide, non-

methane hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and other particulate matter was reduced.  

   The economic, operational, and production data of the initial study were 

compared for both transportation systems (conventional and SMIPCC), which exposed 

the pros and cons of each one and allowed the company to improve data interpretation 

so they could make an informed decision on whether or not to continue to the next 

project phase. In the case of the studied mine, the SMIPCC was the more viable 



35  
  

method considering the net present value and the lower costs and gas emissions. Even 

though the production is not extremely high, nor is the AHD very long, there was still a 

noticeable difference in costs.  

 

4. CONCLUSIONS   
  

With the increased challenge and complexity of mines, it is imperative to evolve the 

way that projects are being done. The two methodologies presented have shown the 

value. 

In relation to the objective 1, the technological model has proved to be a viable 

option for the case evaluated and it has the potential to be applied to different projects 

with similar grinding processes. For the studied mine, the technological model was 

incorporated into the short and medium term mine-planning schedules. It was 

formulated as a block model and was used together with the mine planning software.  

  The different technological variables presented in the model enabled the 

engineers to simulate different blasting and plant productivity scenarios, supporting the 

decision making process for the development of the deposit. As a result, it was possible 

to improve of the plant with little or no capital investment by optimizing the breaking 

and fragmenting mechanisms through blasting, crushing, and grinding. This resulted 

in:  

 

• A reduction of the top size of the ROM, which allowed the primary crusher to 

operate with a higher feed rate by 2.2%, a reduced opening, and to feed the SAG 

with a smaller top size.  

• Operating the SAG with more fines (&lt;10mm) by increasing the powder factor to 

2.78kg/m3, increased the plant production rate by 10.7% while using the same 

power. 

 

In relation to the objective 2, the decision-making method presented to evaluate the 

SMIPCC alternative is meant to be used for a conceptual study level. By using the 

proposed decision-making method, it is possible to identify the projects that have the 

potential for SMIPCC implementation without necessarily spending a large amount of 

time, which can be expensive and wasteful. Therefore, it enables mining companies to 



36  
  

shift their focus to the alternatives that continue to show potential for further in depth 

studies. In general, IPCC installation is an attractive option due to its lower sustaining 

CAPEX and OPEX. After evaluating the decision-making model for the specific case 

treated, the sustaining CAPEX is approximately halved, and the OPEX is 34% lower.  

   However, due to the high initial cost of installing the SMIPCC, which in this case 

is seen to be 60% higher, installation is only feasible when there is a long mine life. In 

addition, if the mine has a small AHD and/or low production, the IPCC is not very 

appealing because the initial CAPEX may not be paid back during the LOM. In this 

particular case, the haulage distance and mine life are sufficient to notice a 0.28$/t 

decrease in total expenditure. Savings are not solely restricted to the costs; there are 

also noticeable environment benefits.   

  For the discussed case, carbon monoxide emissions drop 58% when using the 

SMIPCC scenario. Later, the mine moved to a feasibility study and detailed design 

phases and the SMIPCC is now installed and in operation at the site.
