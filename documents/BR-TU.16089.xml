Abstract
Leaf area estimation is an important biometrical trait for evaluating leaf development and plant growth in field and 
pot experiments. We developed a non-destructive model to estimate the leaf area (LA) of Vernonia ferruginea using 
the length (L) and width (W) leaf dimensions. Different combinations of linear equations were obtained from L, L2, 
W, W2, LW and L2W2. The linear regressions using the product of LW dimensions were more efficient to estimate 
the LA of V. ferruginea than models based on a single dimension (L, W, L2 or W2). Therefore, the linear regression 
“LA=0.463+0.676WL” provided the most accurate estimate of V. ferruginea leaf area. Validation of the selected model 
showed that the correlation between real measured leaf area and estimated leaf area was very high.

Modelo linear não-destrutivo para estimativa de área  
foliar de Vernonia ferruginea Less

Resumo
A estimativa de área foliar é um importante traço biométrico para avaliação do desenvolvimento foliar e do crescimento 
vegetal em experimentos de campo e casa-de-vegetação. Foi desenvolvido um modelo linear não destrutivo capaz 
de estimar a área foliar (AF) de Vernonia ferruginea usando o comprimento (C) e a largura (L) foliar. Diferentes 
combinações de equações lineares foram obtidas a partir de C, C2, L, L2, CL e C2L2. As regressões lineares usando o 
produto de dimensões CL foram mais eficientes para estimar a AF de V. ferruginea do que os modelos baseados em 
uma única dimensão (C, L, C2 ou L2). O modelo linear “AF = 0,463+0,676 CL” forneceu com maior precisão a AF de 
V. ferruginea em relação aos demais modelos testados. A validação do modelo selecionado revelou elevada correlação 
entre a área foliar real e a área foliar estimada pelo modelo.

1. Introduction

The leaf area measurement is one of the most common 
parameters evaluated in green house and field ecophysiological 
studies (Wang and Zhang, 2012) on Brazilian savanna 
(locally know as “cerrado”) woody species, crops and 
weeds. Therefore, the accurate measurements of leaf area 
(LA) in field experiments may be time-consuming and 
generally requires the use of expensive equipment (e.g. 
portable leaf area meters). Such destructive methods require 
the excision of the leaves, thus removing the possibility of 

successive measurements of the same leaf. The excision of 
a large number of leaves (causing the artificial reduction 
of the leaf life span) can interfere with the photosynthesis 
rate, reducing the plant growth and interfering with the 
phenology of this species, due to the reduction of the 
canopy (Chabot and Hicks, 1982). In conservation areas 
(e.g. cerrado), many researchers are conducting different 
research using the same communities at the same time. So,

Leaf area estimation of Vernonia ferruginea

the excision of the leaves can interfere with the results of 
other experiments that are sharing the same group of plants.

The use of non-destructive models to estimate the leaf 
area has been used to understand the ecophysiology of 
crops (e.g., Crocus sativus L. (Kumar, 2009), Juglans nigra 
L. (Zellers et al., 2012), terrestrial weeds (e.g. Merremia 
cissoides Lam. (Carvalho et al., 2011a) and aquatics (e.g. 
Pistia stratiotes L. (Carvalho et al., 2011b)), and more 
recently cerrado species (e.g. Styrax ferrugineus Nees &amp;amp; 
Mart and Styrax pholii A. DC. (Souza and Habermann, 
2014)). Linear models based on length and width leaf 
measurements have been considered the most simple and 
efficient models to estimate the leaf area of some species 
(Demirsoy and Lang, 2010, Giuffrida et al., 2011, Wang 
and Zhang, 2012). However, models to estimate the leaf 
area of the cerrado species are almost absent. So, non-
destructive models to estimate LA are not only required 
by agronomists, but also biologists and ecologists.

Vernonia ferruginea (Asteraceae) is a native species 
from Brazilian’s cerrado with a good distribution by the 
cerrado remains. This species is often found as an invasive 
species of wastelands, pastures and shoulders of highways 
in São Paulo state, Brazil. The aim of this study was to 
develop and validate an efficient and non-destructive model 
to estimate the leaf area of V. ferruginea using leaf length 
and width dimensions.

2. Material and Methods
2.1. Studied site

This study was carried out in a field within Jaboticabal 
municipality, São Paulo state, Brazil (21°14’19’’S, 
48°16’09’’W). The climate in this region may be classified 
as CWA with a wet season from October to March and 
a dry season from April to September. The mean annual 
temperature is approximately 23 °C and the total annual 
rainfall is approximately 1411 mm.

2.2. Plant samples and leaf measurements
We sampled a total of 200 well-developed leaves of 10 

adult V. ferruginea plants in the beginning of March 2013. 
Immediately after cutting, leaves were carefully placed in 
plastic bags and transported to the laboratory. They were 
individually scanned at 300 dpi, using a HP Photosmart 
C3100 series scanner coupled to a microcomputer. Leaf 
area (LA), length (L) and width (W) of each leaf were 
determined using the software ImageJ (Rasband, 2013), 
where L is the maximum length along the midrib and 
W is the maximum value perpendicular to the midrib 
(Figure 1). The LA is expressed in cm2 while L and W 
are expressed in cm.

2.3. Model building
We used the 200 leaf measurements described above, 

testing the relation between LA and L and/or W (Table 1). 
Leaf area (LA) was considered to be the dependent variable, 
while the independent variables were L, L2, W, W2, the 
product of LW and L2W2. We tested the internal validity 
of the models using the coefficient of determination (R2), 
mean square error (MSE), error sum of squares (SSE) 
and predicted residual error sum of squares (PRESS) 
as described in Ghoreishi et al. (2012). Residuals were 
also analyzed to determine the presence of outliers and 
non-constant error variance (Rouphael et al., 2010). The 
best model was selected according to the combination 
of the higher R2 and the lowest MSE, SSE and PRESS 
(Table 1, Figure 2).

When L and W were involved in the same model, we 
tested the co-linearity between them calculating the variance 
inflation factor (VIF) (Marquardt, 1970) and the tolerance 
value (T) (Gill, 1986). If the VIF value was higher than

10 or if the T value was smaller than 0.10, the co-linearity 
may interfere with the final result, making necessary the 
exclusion of one of the variables from the model.

2.4. Model validation
To further validate the developed model, 185 extra leaves 

of V. ferruginea were sampled from the same site on the same 
year and season, but from different plants. The LA, L and 
W were measured according to the procedures previously 
described. The predicted leaf area (PLA) of each leaf was 
determined according to the parameters obtained from the 
selected model. We performed a linear regression using 
the PLA and the observed leaf area (OLA = LA measured 
with ImageJ) (Figure 3). The correlation between OLA and 
PLA was tested using a Spearman-Rank test (Souza and 
Habermann, 2014). The relative bias was estimated by the 
mean of differences (d) and the standard deviation of the 
differences (SD) (Figure 4). The distribution is considered 
normal if at least 97% of the differences in a population lie 
between the limits of agreement (Rouphael et al., 2010). 
Linear regressions between LA, L and W were performed 
using R 2.15.1 (R Core Team, 2012). The MSE and SSE 
were determined using the R package systemfit while the 
PRESS was determined using the R package asbio.

3. Results

The LA of V. ferruginea ranged from 6.73 to 22.97 cm2 
(average = 14.43 cm2), the L ranged from 4.49 to 9.52 cm 
(average = 6.93 cm) and the W ranged from 1.95 to 4.04 cm 
(average = 2.99 cm). The VIF was smaller than 10 (1.01) and 
T was higher than 0.1 (0.99), showing that the co-linearity 
between W and L may be considered negligible, and both 
variables may be included in the models n° 5 and 6.

All models were statistically significant (p&lt;0.001). 
The regression analysis suggested that LA was strongly

correlated with LW and L2W2 but not so strongly correlated 
with L, L2, W and W2 (Table 1). The model n°5 presented 
the highest R2 and lowest SSE, MSE and PRESS in relation 
to the other models (Table 1), being considered the most 
efficient model to predict V. ferruginea’s leaf area (PLA 
= 0.463 + 0.676LW) (Figure 2).

Leaf area estimation of Vernonia ferruginea

To validate the selected model, we predicted the leaf 
area of 185 leaves of V. ferruginea using the model n° 5. 
The correlation between OLA and PLA was significant 
(rs=0.999) by Spearman-Rank test. We also observed 
significant correlation after applying a new linear 
correlation between OLA and PLA (R2=0.95, p&lt;0.001) 
(Figure 3). Considering that sometimes the correlation is 
an insufficient analysis to explain relationship between 
OLA and PLA, we plotted the differences between PLA 
and OLA against OLA (Figure 4). In the current study we 
observed that the differences between PLA and OLA were 
normally distributed and 98.4% of the plots lay between 
d ± 3SD (Figure 4).

4. Discussion

Regression analysis suggested significant correlations 
(p&lt;0.001) between LA and L, L2, W, W2, LW and L2W2. 
These correlations seem universal since they were previously 
observed in many models to estimate LA of crops (for 
references see Rouphael et al. 2010), bedding plants 
(Giuffrida et al., 2011) and woody species (Ghoreishi et al., 
2012) among others). These significant relations were 
most evident between LA vs. LW and LA vs. L2W2, and 
in both cases, we observed coefficients of determination 
(R2) higher than 0.95 (Table 1). The model based on the 
relationship between LA vs. LW (model n° 5) was selected 
not only based on the higher R2 but also because it presented 
smaller SSE, MSE and PRESS than the model between 
LA vs. L2W2. This criterion was used in accordance with 
Rouphael et al. (2010) and Giuffrida et al. (2011).

In this study, we clearly observed that models with a 
single measurement of L, L2, W and W2 were less acceptable 
for estimating the LA of V. ferruginea, presenting R2 around 
0.40 for the models using L and L2, and 0.66 for models 
using W and W2. Souza and Habermann (2014) observed 
a similar pattern when estimating the leaf area of Styrax 
ferrugineus (savanna species) and S. pohlii (riparian forest 
species). In fact, the differences observed for S. pohlii among 
the models using a single measurement (L or W) were not 
so discrepant as observed by V. ferruginea, producing the 
lowest R2 (0.82) observed for the model correlating LA 
and W2. However, as observed in this paper, the lowest R2 
(0.58) found among the models used to estimate the LA of 
S. ferrugineus was observed in the models that correlated 
LA and L, and LA and L2.

As observed by Rouphael et al., (2010), the shape 
coefficient of the selected model (model n°5, ? = 0.68) 
can be described by a shape between an ellipse (0.78) 
and a triangle (0.50) of the same length and maximum 
width. Our shape coefficient (0.68) showed similarity to 
those calculated for native species and crops. Values of 
0.68 have been reported by S. pohlii, 0.70 for S. ferrugineus 
(Souza and Habermann, 2014), 0.72 for Rosa hybrida 
L. (Rouphael et al., 2010), 0.68 for Helianthus annuus 
L. (Rouphael et al., 2007), 0.69 for Diospyros kaki 
L. (Cristofori et al., 2008) and 0.73 for Salvia sclarea 
L. (Kumar and Sharma, 2010).

5. Conclusion

A simple and efficient model (LA=0.463+0.676LW) was 
developed, and validated, to estimate the LA of Vernonia 
ferruginea. Considering that leaf length and width can be 
easily measured with a ruler, this model is an important tool 
for ecophysiological studies of V. ferruginea in the field 
or greenhouse experiments. The use of this model would 
enable researches to do non-destructive measurements and 
repeat measurements in the same leaf, excluding the use of 
expensive electronic equipment such as leaf area meters.
