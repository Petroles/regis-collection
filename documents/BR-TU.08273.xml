Resumo
O stresse hídrico é o factor que mais limita a produção vegetal à escala mundial, reduzindo significativamente os lucros da actividade agrícola. Do ponto de vista ecofisiológico, designa-se por stresse hídrico qualquer limitação ao funcionamento óptimo das plantas imposta por uma insuficiente disponibilidade de água. As respostas das plantas à falta de água são complexas, envolvendo uma série de adaptações/aclimatações e efeitos nefastos, ou ambos. Por outro lado, à secura do solo associa-se uma forte evaporação causada pela secura do ar, elevada temperatura e elevados níveis de radiação durante o período estival, pelo que é frequente classificar este efeito conjunto de stresse estival.
A oliveira (Olea europaea L.) é uma árvore de folhagem persistente, crescimento lento e grande longevidade. Conta-se entre as poucas plantas cultivadas de origem mediterrânea e a sua difusão é muito antiga. Julga-se que foi domesticada por volta de 3000-4000 anos antes de Cristo na Ásia Menor e a partir daí foi introduzida no Norte de África, Península Ibérica e resto do Sul da Europa pelas civilizações que sucessivamente ocuparam a região mediterrânica. Nos últimos 500 anos foi levada para as Américas, África do Sul, Austrália, China e Japão, mas mantém-se principalmente uma cultura da bacia mediterrânica. O seu cultivo prosperou na região, mesmo em solos pobres, porque esta espécie é capaz de produções aceitáveis, apesar de sujeita à característica falta de água prolongada durante o Verão.
A crescente popularidade da oliveira como árvore de fruto relaciona-se com o aumento da procura dos seus produtos. Esta tendência favorável do mercado é parcialmente devida aos estudos científicos que demonstram as vantagens do consumo regular de azeitonas e azeite na saúde humana. De facto, o baixo teor de ácidos gordos saturados e a presença de antioxidantes pode ajudar a prevenir certas doenças. Os benefícios para a saúde induzidos pelo consumo de azeitonas e azeite virgem são devidos à acção sinérgica de diversos constituintes, como vitaminas (por exemplo a-tocopherol), fitoesteróis, pigmentos, ácidos terpénicos e compostos fenólicos.
Segundo a Organização das Nações Unidas para a Agricultura e a Alimentação (FAO), a área mundial de olival é cerca de 7,5 milhões de hectares e os principais produtores são a Espanha, Itália, Grécia, Tunísia, Turquia, Síria, Marrocos e Portugal. A cultura da oliveira é conhecida em Portugal desde o domínio romano, sendo uma das mais importantes culturas do País, particularmente em Trás-os-Montes, onde detém considerável importância económica, social e ambiental. A excelente qualidade do azeite produzido na região e as suas características únicas são responsáveis pela denominação de origem protegida 'Azeite de Trás-os-Montes
DOP’ A criação da denominação de origem é relativamente recente e estimulou a economia local, nomeadamente adicionando valor ao azeite produzido na região.
Tal como outras regiões do Sul da Europa, Portugal é um local de clima Mediterrânico temperado, mas vulnerável às alterações climáticas. Todos os modelos, em todos os cenários, prevêem um aumento de temperatura média em Portugal no final do século XXI. Os cenários de precipitação são muito mais incertos. Contudo, quase todos os modelos prevêem uma redução da precipitação em Portugal Continental durante a Primavera, Verão e Outono. As alterações climáticas à escala global irão afectar significativamente as colheitas das culturas da região mediterrânica. No entanto, o impacto na produção das culturas será determinado pela capacidade dos agricultores/técnicos de se adaptarem aos novos cenários.
São várias as práticas culturais que podem auxiliar a oliveira a sobreviver e a produzir em ambientes de baixa disponibilidade hídrica. Estas práticas visam alcançar um equilíbrio entre a necessidade de transpiração e a água disponível, especialmente durante o longo e seco Verão. Decisões estratégicas são a selecção de cultivares, a densidade de plantação e o tamanho da copa, juntamente com a gestão da superfície do solo. Recentemente, a rega foi introduzida para aumentar produtividade do olival. A expansão do cultivo da oliveira devido à crescente procura dos seus produtos levou a que as novas plantações fossem caracterizadas por um maior número de árvores por hectare, comparativamente aos olivais tradicionais. Nestes sistemas de cultivo intensivo, a rega é essencial para garantir a optimização da aplicação de água para o crescimento da árvore e produção de azeitona. Todavia, isso pode ser problemático devido aos limitados recursos hídricos disponíveis na região mediterrânica. Uma gestão prudente da água é, por isso, essencial para uma olivicultura sustentável.
A redução da disponibilidade hídrica antecipada pelos cenários das alterações climáticas à escala global irá inevitavelmente agravar o problema da escassez de água em toda a região mediterrânica. Uma vez que a oliveira é a principal cultura da bacia mediterrânica, é fundamental analisar como esta espécie será afectada por uma reduzida disponibilidade hídrica. A melhoria da performance da oliveira não pode ser conseguida sem que os mecanismos de resistência à seca sejam claramente identificados. Tal não é possível sem que haja uma completa compreensão das limitações e dos danos induzidos por um fornecimento de água insuficiente.
A análise da literatura científica apresentada no capítulo 1 revela que a oliveira possui importantes atributos que lhe permitem sobreviver e produzir em ambientes áridos. No entanto, muitos aspectos importantes da resistência à seca não foram ainda abordados e são poucas as diferenças estabelecidas entre cultivares de O. europaea. Apesar das cultivares com maior
importância na região de Trás-os-Montes serem consideradas bem adaptadas às condições locais, não existem estudos científicos que documentem a sua adaptação ao défice hídrico. Por isso, traçaram-se três grandes objectivos: (1) Identificar, em condições de campo, as adaptações morfo-anatómicas, fisiológicas e bioquímicas de várias cultivares de oliveira; (2) Estudar, em condições controladas, as respostas imediatas e as estratégias adaptativas das cultivares de oliveira mais representativas na região de Trás-os-Montes e avaliar os sintomas de stresse oxidativo induzidos pela baixa disponibilidade hídrica; (3) Estudar num olival comercial a influência de diferentes níveis de rega no comportamento fisiológico de oliveiras adultas e analisar os danos oxidativos e a protecção antioxidante ao nível foliar em árvores regadas e não regadas. Para alcançar tais objectivos, foram realizadas três experiências. A componente experimental desta dissertação resulta dos dados obtidos nessas experiências e está estruturada em cinco capítulos, cujos conteúdos incluem integralmente a informação publicada ou submetida a revistas indexadas na lista do Journal Citation Reports.
A primeira experiência decorreu em 2001 e 2002 num olival da Direcção Regional de Agricultura de Trás-os-Montes, instalado em Mirandela (Terra Quente Transmontana). Foram analisadas oliveiras com dez anos de idade de cinco cultivares com diferentes origens geográficas (Trás-os-Montes e diferentes regiões de Espanha): Arbequina, Blanqueta, Cobrançosa, Manzanilla e Negrinha de Freixo (daqui em diante designada simplificadamente por Negrinha).
No capítulo 2 o objectivo específico foi identificar os mecanismos morfo-anatómicos e as adaptações estruturais para reduzir a perda de água pelas folhas das cinco cultivares de oliveira. Foram analisados diversos parâmetros foliares: a espessura dos diferentes tecidos, a densidade estomática, a área foliar, a massa por unidade de área foliar (LMA), a densidade do tecido foliar (D), o conteúdo relativo em água (RWC), a suculência, o défice de saturação em água (WSD), o conteúdo em água em folhas saturadas (WCS) e a taxa de transpiração cuticular. Foram também efectuadas determinações do potencial hídrico do caule antes do nascer do sol (Trd) e ao meio-dia solar (Tmd). Este estudo indicou que as folhas das cinco cultivares possuem diferentes mecanismos ao nível morfo-estrutural para ultrapassar o stresse estival. Apesar das folhas de todas as cultivares serem bem adaptadas à luminosidade intensa, foi demonstrado que as cultivares nativas de regiões mais secas, como a Cobrançosa, a Negrinha e a Manzanilla apresentaram folhas mais protegidas contra a perda de água do que as cultivares oriundas de regiões com um clima mais temperado, como a Arbequina e a Blanqueta. Verificou-se que as folhas das cultivares mais resistentes apresentavam maior grau de esclerofilia. A Cobrançosa revelou elevada densidade do tecido foliar (i.e. elevada razão
parênquima clorofilino em paliçada/parênquima clorofilino lacunoso) e espessas camadas de cutícula e de escamas peltadas, enquanto a Manzanilla e a Negrinha aumentaram a esclerofilia ao nível foliar, aumentando a espessura dos tecidos parenquimatosos e de estruturas de protecção, como a cutícula superior (Negrinha) e as epidermes superior e inferior (Manzanilla). As folhas da Arbequina apresentaram a menor espessura total da lâmina e uma camada de escamas peltadas mais fina, o que implica que são menos protegidas contra a perda de água. Para além disso, esta cultivar apresentou os valores mais elevados de transpiração cuticular, em resultado de possuir uma camada cuticular mais fina e/ou devido a diferenças na estrutura e composição da cutícula. Como consequência, e apesar do desenvolvimento de folhas mais pequenas, esta cultivar apresentou menor RWC e Tmd e maior WSD. Por seu lado, a Blanqueta apresenta folhas de maiores dimensões, responsáveis por uma maior perda de água.
No capítulo 3 foram estudadas as variações diurnas das trocas gasosas das cinco cultivares e avaliadas as limitações na fotossíntese impostas pelas condições de sequeiro. Foram também analisados mecanismos de tolerância à seca associados à acumulação de açúcares solúveis, proteínas solúveis e prolina nas folhas. A variação diurna da taxa de fotossíntese das cultivares de oliveira seguiu uma tendência típica da vegetação lenhosa mediterrânica, com um máximo de manhã e mínimo ao meio-dia ou durante a tarde. Contudo, o grau de depressão da fotossíntese ao meio-dia foi dependente do genotipo, com um máximo na Arbequina e um mínimo na Negrinha. O controlo estomático da perda de água foi identificado como uma resposta inicial das oliveiras ao défice hídrico, levando a uma limitação da assimilação do carbono pelas folhas. No entanto, verificou-se que as reduções na taxa de assimilação de CO2 também foram atribuídas a factores não estomáticos, particularmente na cultivar Blanqueta. A acumulação de prolina nas folhas de todas as cultivares, essencialmente na Manzanilla, indica um possível papel deste aminoácido na tolerância à seca da espécie O. Europaea.
A segunda experiência foi efectuada numa estufa situada no campus da UTAD durante o ano de 2002. Este estudo foi desenvolvido em oliveiras envasadas, com um ano de idade, das três cultivares mais representativas na região de Trás-os-Montes (Cobrançosa, Madural e Verdeal Transmontana), submetidas a diferentes regimes hídricos durante a época estival (bem regadas - regadas três vezes por semana com a água necessária para manter o solo à capacidade de campo; baixa disponibilidade hídrica - 1/3 da água aplicada às bem regadas).
negativamente o crescimento e a acumulação de biomassa em todas as cultivares, embora em menor grau na Cobrançosa. Verificou-se também que as plantas reagiram à baixa disponibilidade hídrica desenvolvendo mecanismos para evitar a seca baseados no controlo estomático, alterações das propriedades hidráulicas do xilema e redução da área foliar. O decréscimo na taxa de crescimento relativo (RGR) das plantas sob baixa disponibilidade hídrica foi associado a decréscimos da taxa média de assimilação aparente (NAR) e da razão da área foliar (LAR). A menor LAR foi devida a uma menor translocação de biomassa para as folhas (LWR) e, sobretudo, a uma menor área foliar específica (SLA), em consequência de uma maior densidade do tecido foliar. As plantas da cultivar Verdeal Transmontana foram uma excepção a este comportamento, revelando uma tendência para uma maior LAR sob baixa disponibilidade hídrica, em resultado de uma maior expansão das folhas jovens. Sob stresse hídrico, a área foliar por planta foi drasticamente reduzida em todas as cultivares devido a uma combinação da redução da expansão foliar e da abscisão precoce das folhas mais velhas. Outra constatação importante foi que a baixa disponibilidade hídrica induziu um aumento na frequência de vasos xilémicos em todas as cultivares, proporcionado um maior potencial vascular e uma maior segurança da condução da seiva. As plantas da cultivar Cobrançosa que cresceram em condições de baixa disponibilidade hídrica foram as únicas que revelaram maior condutividade hidráulica relativa que as plantas controlo, mas igual índice de vulnerabilidade à cavitação.
No capítulo 5 foram estudados o efeito da cultivar e do regime hídrico na anatomia e estrutura foliar, composição química e relações pressão-volume das folhas e os sintomas de stresse oxidativo induzidos pela baixa disponibilidade hídrica. Anatomicamente, a Cobrançosa e a Madural mostraram-se capazes de lidar melhor com a baixa disponibilidade hídrica que a Verdeal Transmontana. As folhas da Cobrançosa e da Madural revelaram uma epiderme superior e um parênquima clorofilino em paliçada mais espessos e maior densidade estomática que a Verdeal Transmontana. A disponibilidade hídrica apresentou um papel determinante na modificação da estrutura foliar. Assim, as folhas das plantas que cresceram com baixa disponibilidade de água tiveram uma menor SLA que as plantas controlo, em resultado de um aumento da D, uma vez que não foram observadas diferenças de espessura. Entre cultivares, a Cobrançosa apresentou menor SLA e maior D. A maior D pode ser útil para esta cultivar, uma vez que as folhas com maior D têm mais capacidade de resistir à seca severa, apresentando maior resistência aos danos físicos por dessecação. A Cobrançosa e a Madural também mostraram maior capacidade de ajustamento osmótico e um aumento da rigidez dos tecidos em condições de baixa disponibilidade hídrica. Contrariamente, a Verdeal Transmontana não exibiu ajustamento osmótico, mas foi capaz de aumentar a elasticidade dos tecidos e a concentração
de proteínas solúveis. As folhas que cresceram com baixa disponibilidade hídrica mostraram sinais de stresse oxidativo, com decréscimos nas concentrações de pigmentos fotossintéticos e tióis totais e níveis elevados de peroxidação lipídica. No entanto, essas plantas desenvolveram alguns mecanismos de defesa contra o stresse oxidativo, como o aumento das concentrações de compostos fenólicos totais e de proteínas solúveis totais. O aumento da concentração de substâncias reactivas com o ácido tiobarbitúrico (TBARS) e o decréscimo da concentração de tióis totais em condições de baixa disponibilidade hídrica sugere que os mecanismos de defesa contra o stresse oxidativo foram menos eficazes na Madural. Do comportamento da Cobrançosa, com menor translocação de biomassa para as folhas, uma menor redução de NAR, um transporte de água pelo xilema mais eficiente, uma maior eficiência do uso da água para a produção de biomassa em condições de baixa disponibilidade de água e maior protecção contra o stresse oxidativo, é possível concluir que se trata da cultivar mais adequada para cultivo em condições de baixa disponibilidade hídrica.
A terceira experiência decorreu durante três anos consecutivos, de 2002 a 2004, num olival comercial (cv. Cobrançosa) em Vilarelhos (Vale da Vilariça, Terra Quente Transmontana). As oliveiras com oito anos de idade foram submetidas às situações de sequeiro (T0) e três tratamentos de rega durante o período estival (T1, T2, T3), equivalente a 30, 60 e 100% da evapotranspiração potencial, respectivamente.
No capítulo 6 foi estudada a influência dos diferentes regimes hídricos nas trocas gasosas e fluorescência da clorofila a. Foram também analisados os danos por stresse oxidativo e a protecção antioxidante ao nível foliar em árvores regadas e não regadas. O estudo revelou que todos os níveis de rega melhoraram a taxa de fotossíntese aparente das oliveiras e reduziram a depressão da fotossíntese e da condutância estomática observada durante os períodos do meio-dia e tarde. Verificou-se também a ocorrência de fotoinibição dinâmica ao meio-dia solar nas árvores regadas principalmente nas árvores sujeitas aos tratamentos T2 e T3, o que parece ter sido eficaz para proteger o aparelho fotossintético. As folhas das oliveiras que cresceram em condições de sequeiro revelaram sintomas de stresse oxidativo, como um menor teor clorofilino e níveis elevados de peroxidação lipídica. Observou-se também a redução da actividade da enzima superóxido dismutase nas árvores não regadas. Contrariamente, as baixas concentrações de TBARS nas folhas das plantas regadas, indicam que a rega reduz os danos oxidativos por peroxidação lipídica. Concluiu-se também que a rega aumenta a protecção antioxidante ao nível foliar, visto que as folhas das árvores regadas apresentavam maiores concentrações de tióis totais e maior actividade antioxidante total in vitro. Contudo, a maior actividade da enzima guaiacol peroxidase nas folhas das plantas de sequeiro, associada à
manifestação de danos oxidativos, sugere que esta enzima não tem um papel antioxidante muito importante na oliveira. Adicionalmente, os resultados demonstraram que as árvores regadas com o equivalente a 30% da evapotranspiração potencial tiveram maior eficiência intrínseca do uso da água ao meio-dia e à tarde, permitindo economizar grandes volumes de água, o que justifica o RWC similar às árvores dos tratamentos T2 e T3. Para além disso, este nível de rega pareceu ser suficiente para reduzir os danos oxidativos ao nível foliar. Este resultado é importante, uma vez que uma estratégia de rega deficitária é essencial para uma olivicultura sustentável devido aos limitados recursos hídricos na região mediterrânica.
Abstract
Olive (Olea euopaea L.) is an evergreen tree traditionally cultivated in the Mediterranean basin for oil and table fruit consumption. During the summer months, olive, like other Mediterranean xerophytes, is usually subjected to high solar irradiances, high air temperatures, high vapour pressure deficits and limited water availability in the soil. The reduction of moisture availability anticipated in the climate change scenarios would inevitably add to the problem of water scarcity throughout the Mediterranean region. So, how olive trees are affected by restricted water availability, is of great concern.
A survey of the scientific literature revealed that olive has important attributes that enable survival and production in drought-prone environments (chapter 1), but important areas are still untouched and few differences have been established between O. europaea cultivars. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to identify the drought resistance mechanisms of olive tree cultivars and the limitations and damages imposed by water shortage. It was also our goal to investigate how irrigation assists the olive tree to withstand Mediterranean field conditions.
The experimental work was divided in five chapters, which include the information published or submitted to journals belonging to the Journal Citation Reports. Three experiments have been conducted. In the first experiment, we investigated the morpho-anatomical, physiological and biochemical adaptations of five field-grown olive cultivars with different geographical origins (Arbequina, Blanqueta, Cobran^osa, Manzanilla and Negrinha) to drought conditions (chapters 2 and 3).
Chapter 2 presents data on the leaf-level morphological and structural adaptations to reduce water loss. Leaf measurements included leaf tissue thickness, stomatal density, leaf area, leaf mass per unit area, density of leaf tissue, relative water content, succulence, water saturation deficit, water content at saturation and cuticular transpiration rate. The results revealed that olive cultivars native to dry regions, such as Cobran^osa, Negrinha, and Manzanilla, have more capability to acclimate to drought conditions than cultivars originated in regions with a more temperate climate, like Arbequina and Blanqueta. Adaptation was effected by an increase in sclerophylly. Cobran^osa avoids water loss with high density of foliar tissue and the presence of the thick cuticle and trichome layers. Manzanilla and Negrinha enhanced their sclerophylly by building parenchymatous tissues and increasing protective structures like the upper cuticle (Negrinha) and both the upper and lower epidermis (Manzanilla).
were investigated in the five olive cultivars. Stomatal control of water loss was identified as an early response of all olive cultivars to water deficit, leading to limitation of carbon uptake by the leaves. However, the degree of midday depression of photosynthesis was genotype dependent, with a maximum in Arbequina and a minimum in Negrinha. Non-stomatal factors also play an important role in limiting photosynthesis when olive cultivars (mainly Blanqueta) are submitted to prolonged drought under field conditions. In all cultivars, but mostly in Manzanilla, free proline was accumulated in the foliage. However, olive trees have other mechanisms of drought resistance in addition to the solely proline accumulation, such as stomatal closure and soluble protein accumulation.
In a subsequent study, a glasshouse experiment was conducted. One-year-old plants of three Portuguese O europaea cultivars (Cobrangosa, Madural and Verdeal Transmontana, the more representative cultivars in Trás-os-Montes) were submitted to contrasting water availability regimes during the dry season (chapters 4 and 5).
Chapter 4 presents the effect of cultivar and watering regime in the vegetative growth, gas exchange, xylem hydraulic properties and water use efficiency of biomass production. Low water availability (LW) affected growth and biomass accumulation of the three cultivars. However, Cobrangosa plants were the less affected. Under LW conditions, total leaf area was sharply reduced due to a combination of leaf growth reduction and shedding of older leaves, minimising water losses by transpiration. Water stress also caused a marked decline on photosynthetic capacity and stomatal control was the major factor affecting photosynthesis. Under LW, water use efficiency of biomass production was improved in Cobrangosa, whereas it decreased in Madural and Verdeal Transmontana. In all cultivars, water stress induced an increase in xylem vessel frequency, providing a greater vascular potential and a greater security of xylem sap conduction under drought conditions. From the behaviour of Cobrangosa plants, with a lower allocation of assimilates to leaves, smaller leaves, a smaller reduction in net assimilation rate and photosynthetic rate, a more efficient water transport through the xylem, and an enhanced water use efficiency of biomass production under LW, we consider this cultivar the more appropriate for cultivation under restricted water availability.
Chapter 5 presents the effect of cultivar and watering regime in leaf anatomy, sclerophylly, pressure-volume relationships, chemical composition and oxidative stress symptoms. Anatomically, Cobrangosa and Madural were more capable than Verdeal Transmontana to cope with LW availability, with a thicker upper epidermis, a thicker palisade parenchyma and higher stomatal density. Cobrangosa leaves also revealed the lowest specific leaf area and the highest density of the foliar tissue. Under LW conditions, Cobrangosa and
Madural showed greater capability for osmotic adjustment and increased tissue rigidity. By contrast, Verdeal Transmontana did not exhibit osmotic adjustment, but was able to increase tissue elasticity and total soluble protein concentration. Leaves grown under LW conditions revealed signs of oxidative stress, with decreases in chlorophyll, carotenoid and total thiol concentrations and increased levels of lipid peroxidation. Nevertheless, LW plants developed some defence mechanisms against oxidative stress, like the increase in total phenol and total soluble protein concentrations. Comparatively, Cobrangosa revealed more protection against oxidative stress. In opposition, the increased levels of lipid peroxidation and the decreased total thiol concentration under LW conditions suggest that the mechanisms against oxidative stress were less effective in Madural.
In chapter 6, the influence of different irrigation regimes were investigated on an 8-year-old olive (Olea europaea L., cv. Cobrangosa) commercial orchard located in northeast Portugal. Trees were subjected to a rainfed control (T0) and 3 treatments (T1, T2, T3) that received a seasonal water amount equivalent to 30, 60 and 100% of the estimated local evaporative demand by a drip irrigation system. All irrigation levels improved carbon assimilation of olive trees and reduced the midday and afternoon depression of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance. The experiment also revealed the occurrence of a dynamic photoinhibition in irrigated trees, mainly in trees irrigated with 60 and 100% of the estimated local evaporative demand, which seemed to be effective in protecting the photosynthetic apparatus from photodamage. Leaves grown under rainfed conditions revealed symptoms of oxidative stress, like the reduction in chlorophyll concentration and the increased levels of lipid peroxidation. We also found that the scavenging function of superoxide dismutase was impaired in rainfed plants. In contrast, the low thiobarbituric acid reactive substances concentration in irrigated trees indicates that irrigation decreases the oxidative damage by lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, we concluded that irrigation enhanced antioxidant protection at leaf level since leaves of irrigated trees had high levels of -SH compounds and the highest antioxidant potential. Meanwhile, the finding that guaiacol peroxidase activity increased in rainfed plants, associated with the appearance of oxidative damage, suggests that this enzyme has no major antioxidative function in olive. Additionally, this experiment demonstrated that olive trees irrigated with 30% of the estimated local evaporative demand had high intrinsic water use efficiency at midday and afternoon, saving consistent amounts of water and revealing a relative water content similar to trees irrigated with high amounts of water. Moreover, this level of irrigation seemed to be sufficient to reduce oxidative damage at leaf level. This is an important
finding since a sagacious irrigation approach is essential for viable olive industry due to the limited water resources available in the Mediterranean region.
Chapter 7 present the general conclusions from the research work that was undertaken and indicates some directions for future research.

GENERAL INTRODUCTION
1.	GENERAL INTRODUCTION
1.1.	Introduction
Olive is a perennial, long-lived, evergreen tree of subtropical origin (Bongi and Palliotti,
1994). It was domesticated around 3000 to 4000 B.C. in the eastern Mediterranean and from there was spread widely in northern Africa, the Iberian Peninsula, and the rest of southern Europe by civilizations that successively occupied the region. During the last 500 years, olive has been taken to the Americas, South Africa, Australia, China and Japan, but remains principally a crop of the Mediterranean basin (Connor, 2005). Although growth is possible in other latitudes, olive grows best in areas between 30°-45° north and south latitude (Hagidimitriou and Pontikis, 2005). The recognized tolerance of olive to drought, and its capacity to grow in shallow, poor quality soils, makes the species among the most interesting for cultivation in arid and semiarid areas. This agronomic interest is enhanced by the fact that, despite its tough character, the tree shows a remarkable response to any improvement in the cropping conditions (Fernández and Moreno, 1999).
The olive tree is the only species with edible fruits in the family Oleaceae (Rapoport,
2001). Although there are different systems for the botanical classification of the species, it is generally accepted that the commercial cultivars are included in the subspecies sativa and the wild types belong to the subspecies syivestris (Lavee, 1996). The recent and growing popularity of the olive as fruit tree is related with the increasing demand of its products, both oil and the fruits. This favourable market trend is partly due to dietetic studies providing the advantages of the regular consumption of olives and olive oil for human health. In fact, the low saturated-to-unsaturated fatty acid ratio and the presence of natural antioxidants could prevent certain human diseases (Saldanha, 1999). In most cases, health and dietary benefits induced by consumption of olives and virgin olive oil are due to the synergistic activity of several constituents, such as vitamins (e.g. a-tocopherol), phytosterols, pigments, terpenic acids, and phenolic compounds (Visioli et ai., 2002). In particular, phenolic compounds are strong antioxidants and are also responsible for the astringency and bitterness of olive oils. The presence of some phenolic compounds in olive oil and drupes has been related to the prevention of coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis (Caturla etai., 2005).
The world area of olive is around 7.5 million ha and the primary producers of olive oil are Spain, Italy, Greece, Tunisia, Turkey, Syria, Morocco and Portugal (FAOSTAT, 2006). These countries alone account for more than 90% of world production. Portugal is an important table olives and olive oil producer (11,291 t table olives; 280,000 t olive oil, in 2003) (GPPAA, 2004).
Olive cultivation is known in Portugal since the Roman domination (Ribeiro, 1991) and is one of the most important crops in the country. Olive has traditionally been grown in Tras-os-Montes (northeast Portugal) where it is of considerable economic, social and environmental importance. Its excellent quality and unique characteristics are responsible for the denomination of protected origin 'Azeite de Tras-os-Montes DOP’The creation of the denomination of protected origin is relatively new and stimulated the local economy, namely by adding value to the olive oil produced in the area. As a result of the recent strategy to promote quality, we can see today old olive groves, some with more than one century, and modern ones spread throughout the region, especially in the warmer areas.
During the summer, olive, like other Mediterranean xerophytes, is usually subjected to high solar irradiances, high air temperatures, high air vapour pressure deficits and limited water availability in the soil. The severity of these stresses is predicted to increase in the future as a result of global environmental change (Fischer et al, 2001; Centritto, 2002). Research into plant response to water stress is becoming increasingly important, as most climate change scenarios suggest an increase in aridity in many areas of the globe (Petit et al, 1999). Plant responses to water scarcity are complex, involving adaptive changes or deleterious effects (Chaves etal, 2002), or both. A better understanding of the effects of drought on plants is vital for improved management practices and breeding efforts in agriculture and for predicting the fate of natural vegetation under climate change (Chaves etal, 2003).
As other southern European regions, Portugal is a place of mild Mediterranean climate, but with well known vulnerability to climate variability, namely to drought and desertification (Santos et al, 2002). All models, in all scenarios, predict a significant increase in the mean temperature, in all Portuguese regions, by the end of the 21st century (IPCC, 2001). Precipitation scenarios are much more uncertain. However, almost all models predict a reduction in precipitation over mainland Portugal during spring, summer and autumn (IPCC,
2001). Future changes in climate would significantly affect crop yields in the Mediterranean region. However, the overall impact on crop production will be determined by the ability of farmers to adapt to the new scenarios.
There is a range of management practices that assist olive to survive and produce in water-limited environments. These practices seek to balance transpiration demand with water available, especially during the long, dry summer. Strategic decisions are selection of cultivars, tree density, and canopy size, together with surface management (Connor, 2005). Recently, irrigation has been introduced to increase the low land productivity. The expansion of olive cultivation, due to increased demand for olive oil, has led new plantations to be characterized
by higher number of trees per ha compared to traditional orchards. Under such intensive systems, irrigation is essential to ensure optimum water application for tree growth and olive production (Patumi et al, 1999). However, this can be problematic due to limited water resources available in the Mediterranean regions (Villalobos et al, 2000). Prudent management of water is, therefore, essential for a viable olive industry.
1.2.	Objectives
The reduction of moisture availability anticipated in the climate change scenarios would inevitably add to the problem of water scarcity throughout the Mediterranean region. Since olive is a major crop in the Mediterranean basin, how olive trees are affected by restricted water availability at Mediterranean latitudes, is of great concern.
The potential for improvement of olive performance cannot be realised until characteristics and mechanisms of drought resistance are clearly identified. This in turn cannot occur without a through understanding of the restrictions and damages that are induced by an insufficient water supply. A survey of the scientific literature revealed that olive has important attributes that enable survival and production in drought-prone environments, but important areas are still untouched, and few differences have been established between O. europaea cultivars. Although the cultivars most frequently grown in Tras-os-Montes are considered well adapted to drought, there are no studies documenting the drought adaptation of these cultivars. Therefore, the general objectives of this thesis were:
•	to identify the morpho-anatomical, physiological and biochemical adaptations that enable olive tree cultivars with different geographical origins (Tras-os-Montes and several regions of Spain) and diverse genetic background to cope with summer stress in the field;
•	to study the immediate responses and adaptative strategies of the three more representative O. europaea cultivars in Tras-os-Montes (Cobrangosa, Madural and Verdeal Transmontana) growing in a glasshouse under contrasting water availability regimes during the dry season, and to evaluate the symptoms of oxidative stress induced by low water availability;
•	to study the influence of different irrigation regimes on the physiological behaviour of mature olive trees (cv. Cobrangosa) growing in commercial-like field conditions and to analyse the oxidative damage and antioxidative protection at leaf level in irrigated and non-irrigated trees.
1.3.	Literature review
1.3.1.	Drought and related terms
Water is an important component of the metabolism of all living organisms, facilitating many vital biological reactions by being a solvent, a transport medium and evaporative coolant (Bohnert et al., 1995). In plants and other photoautotrophs, water plays the additional role of providing the energy necessary to drive photosynthesis. Water molecules are split, in a process termed autolysis, to yield the electrons that are used to drive the energy yielding photosystem II reaction centre (Salisbury and Ross, 1992). Thus, any limitation in the availability of water has a great influence on plant life.
Many environmental conditions can lead to water deficit in plants (Bray et al, 2000). Periods of little or no rainfall can lead to meteorological condition called drought. Transient or prolonged drought conditions reduce the amount of water available for plant growth. Other climatic factors such as high temperature, high irradiance, high wind, and low relative humidity are often associated with it in many regions of the world and can significantly aggravate its severity. Drought can be permanent, as in arid regions, or seasonal or even random. The period of time without rainfall actually needed to produce a drought depends mainly on the water holding capacity of the soil and the rate of evapotranspiration (Jones, 1992; Larcher, 1995; Kozlowski and Pallardy, 1997).
Water deficit can also occur in environments in which water is not limiting (Bray et al, 2000). In saline habitats, the presence of high salt concentrations makes it more difficult for plant roots to extract water from the environment. Low soil temperatures reduce soil and plant hydraulic conductance and eventually water uptake (e.g. Kramer and Boyer, 1995) through an increase in water viscosity and a decrease in membrane permeability and in metabolic activity of roots (Kaufmann, 1975), as well as hampering the production of new fine roots. Exposure to freezing temperatures can lead to cellular dehydration as water leaves the cells and forms ice crystals in the intercellular spaces. Occasionally, well-watered plants will show periodic signs of water stress such as transient loss of turgor during some periods of the day. In this case, wilting indicates that the transpirational water loss has exceeded the rate of water absorption.
Drought is considered a multidimensional stress affecting plants at various levels of their organization (Yordanov et al, 2000). The responses of plants to drought stress are highly complex, involving deleterious and/or adaptive changes. The plant response to drought at the whole plant and crop levels reflects the integration of stress effects and responses at all underlying levels of organization over space and time (Blum, 1996).
1.3.2.	Time scales of plant response to drought stress
Plant responses to stresses such as drought involve a variety of temporal scales, from a matter of seconds to evolutionary time scales. Lambers et al. (1998) recognize at least three distinct time scales of plant response to stress: stress response, acclimation and adaptation (Figure 1.1). Stress response is the immediate detrimental effect of a stress on a plant process. This usually occurs over a time scale of seconds or days in which the net effect is a decline in plant performance.
Figure 1.1
Typical time course of plant response to environmental stress (Lambers et al., 1998).
Acclimation is the morphological and physiological adjustment by plants to compensate the decline in performance following exposure to stress. Acclimation occurs within the life time of the plant, usually within days or weeks of the stress exposure. During acclimation, an organism alters its homeostasis, its steady-state physiology, to accommodate shifts in its external environment.
Adaptation is the evolutionary response that results from genetic changes in populations leading to morphological and physiological compensation for the decline in performance caused by stress. This may be similar to acclimation, but because it requires genetic changes, it must occur over many generations. Some plants possess adaptations to arid environments, such as the C4 and CAM modes of metabolism (Taiz and Zieger, 1998). In CAM plants the stomata are open during the night and can be closed in daytime, so that water loss is very low in relation to dry matter production. C4 plants exhibit no photorespiration and can fix CO2 even in hot and dry conditions, requiring less water as a consequence.
1.3.3.	Sensing and signalling drought stress
A stress response is initiated when the plant recognises a stress at the cellular level (Bray et al., 2002). Stress recognition activates signal transduction pathways that transmit information within individual cells and throughout the plant. It is not perfectly clear how cells perceive cellular water deficit and how cellular water deficit is transduced and transcribed into the various consequences of this stress. Furthermore, it has not been clearly established which of these responses are stress adaptive and which are expressions of system degradation. The nature of the primary mediators of cellular responses to water deficit-water status, turgor, bound water, hormones (e.g. abscisic acid, ABA), alteration in cell membranes and others-are still under debate (Chaves et al, 2003). After the first stress-recognition events, cell-to-organ drought-mediated responses diverge in different pathways according to the involvement or not of ABA (Chaves et al, 2003). In the ABA-dependent pathway, the accumulation of ABA activates numerous 'stress responsive’genes. These gene products are either functional (such as aquaporins or the enzymes of osmoprotectant biosynthesis) or regulatory (such as protein kinases) and they are involved in mediating various cellular responses some of which are recognized as adaptive (Chaves et al, 2003). Several genes are induced by cell dehydration in ABA-deficient and ABA-insensitive mutants, suggesting that such genes do not require ABA for expression (Shinozaki and Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, 1997; Luan, 1998). The ABA independentpathway so far identified is still poorly understood, but is known to be rapidly induced by water stress. Although the ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways are usually considered to function independently from each other, it is certainly possible that some cross-talk exists between them, as supported by Kizis et al (2001).
1.3.4.	Drought effects and symptoms
Many factors can affect the response of a plant to drought stress. The duration, severity, and rate at which a stress is imposed all influence how a plant responds (Gaspar et al, 2002). Stress due to drought, in contrast to many other stressful events, does not occur abruptly, but develops slowly and increases in intensity the longer it lasts (Larcher, 1995). Features of the plant, including organ or tissue identity, developmental age, and genotype, also influence plant response to stress (Bray etal, 2000).
(1995) has proposed an alternative, but broadly compatible, classification of mesophytes, based on relative water content (RWC): values down 90% are associated with effects on stomata and cell expansion; 80-90% with effects on photosynthesis and respiration; and bellow 80% (corresponding to water potentials of -1.5 MPa or lower) with the cessation of photosynthesis and the disruption of cell metabolism.
The interpretation of the effects of water stress on plant physiology can be complicated by the fact that responses can be evoked at the organ, tissue, cell or molecular level. Figure 1.2 outlines the influence of water stress on the physiology of plants. Some of the earliest responses to water stress appear to be mediated by biophysical events rather than by changes in chemical reactions resulting from dehydration (Taiz and Zieger, 1998). As the water content of the plant decreases, the cells shrink and the cell walls relax. This decrease in cell volume results in lower hydrostatic pressure, or turgor. Cell expansion is a turgor driven process and appears to be one of the plant processes most sensitive to water stress (Hsiao, 1973). Inhibition of cell expansion results in a slowing of leaf expansion early in the development of water deficits. The smaller leaf area transpires less water, effectively conserving a limited supply in the soil for use over a longer period (Taiz and Zieger, 1998). If plants became water stressed after a substantial leaf area has developed, leaves will senesce and eventually fall off. Water stress limits not only the size of individual leaves, but also the number of leaves on an indeterminate plant, because it decreases both the number and growth rate of branches. The process of growth of the other organs is probably affected by the same forces that limit leaf area during stress.
In addition to slowing growth, a lowering of water potential by less than 0.5 MPa is associated with some disruption of biosynthetic activities (Figure 1.2). The inhibition of cell expansion is usually followed closely by a reduction in cell wall synthesis (Fitter and Hay, 2002). Protein synthesis may be almost equally sensitive to water stress (Salisbury and Ross, 1992). At slightly more negative water potentials, protochlorophyll formation is inhibited (Fitter and Hay,
2002). Some studies also indicate that activities of certain enzymes, especially nitrate reductase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase and few others, decrease sharply as water stress increases (Salisbury and Ross, 1992).
Under moderate water stress there is further reduction in turgor, leading to the narrowing of stomatal aperture and a progressive reduction in photosynthetic activity (Figure
1.2). Increased respiration may also play a part in stomatal closure owing to an increase in CO2 concentration within the leaf air spaces (Fitter and Hay, 2002).

Influence of water stress on the physiology of plants. The horizontal bars are guides to the level of stress at which the relevant symptoms first occur. The lowering of leaf water potential is in relation to a well-watered plant under mild evaporative demand (Updated from Hsiao et al, 1976).
Because guard cells are exposed to the atmosphere, they can lose water directly by evaporation and so loose turgor, causing the stomata to close by a mechanism called hydropassive closure. A second mechanism, called hydroactive closure, closes the stomata when the whole leaf or the roots are dehydrated and depends on metabolic processes in the guard cells. A reduction in the solute content of the guard cells results in water loss and decreased turgor, causing the stomata to close (Taiz and Zieger, 1998). Solute loss from guard cells can be triggered by decreasing water status in the rest of the leaf, and there is much evidence that ABA plays an important role in this process. The stomata respond to two sources of ABA: (1) an 'early warning system’ involving root ABA, indicating that some roots are drying; and (2) ABA translocation within the leaf, resulting from desiccation of the leaves themselves (Taiz and Zieger, 1998). Nevertheless, stomatal responses to dehydration can vary widely both within and across species.
There are several reports, which mark the stomatal limitation of photosynthesis as a primary event, followed by respective changes of the photosynthetic reactions (Chaves, 1991; Cornic and Massacci, 1996). However, at long-term water deficit the non-stomatal limitation predominates (Yordanov et al., 2001). Non-stomatal limitations has been attributed to reduced
carboxilation efficiency (Wise et al, 1991; Jia and Gray, 2004), reduced ribulose-1,5-biphosphate (RuBP) regeneration (Gimenez et al, 1992; Tezara and Lawlor, 1995), and/or to a reduced amount of functional Rubisco (Kanechi et al, 1995).
With the onset of severe stress, a general disruption of metabolism is signalled by high rates of respiration and the build up of proline and soluble sugars in leaf tissues (Figure 1.2). In plants resistant to drought such accumulation of organic solutes, leading to osmorregulation, can occur at lower stress (see section 1.3.5.3.).
Under moderate and severe water stress (xylem water potential lower than -1.0 MPa), herbaceous plants begin to show symptoms of xylem cavitation and reduced xylem conductance (Tyree et al, 1986). However, cavitation of xylem elements in trees tends to begin at much lower potentials, typically -2.0 to -3.0 MPa (Jones and Sutherland, 1991). There can also be reductions in the supply of mineral nutrients to the leaf via the xylem, and, under severe stress, in rates of flow in the phloem (Schulze, 1991) (Figure 2.2).
In summary, exposure of plants to even mild water stress can affect growth and disturb metabolic processes. Depending on their severity, such effects can reduce the ability of plants to survive and reproduce. Much of the relevant research on drought effects was done with herbaceous plants, but the results probably are equally applicable to woody plants (Kozlowski and Pallardy, 1997).
1.3.5.	Strategies to survive drought
The ability of plants to survive the consequences of drought is termed drought resistance. There is no universal way by which this can be achieved and in consequence the different components of drought resistance have been classified in different ways by different authors. Classically, plant resistance to drought has been divided into escape, avoidance and tolerance strategies (Levitt, 1972; Turner, 1986). Nevertheless, these strategies are not mutually exclusive and, in practice, plants may combine a range of response types (Ludlow, 1989).
1.3.5.1.	Drought escape
Plants that escape drought, like desert ephemerals and annual crop and pasture plants, exhibit a high degree of developmental plasticity, being able to complete their life cycle before water deficit occur. Escape strategies rely on successful reproduction before the onset of severe stress. Improved reproductive success also includes better partitioning of assimilates to
developing fruits. This is associated with the plant's ability to store reserves in some organs (stems and roots) and to mobilise them for fruit production, a response well documented in crop plants, such as cereals (Gebbing and Schnyder, 1999; Bruce et al, 2002) and some legumes (Rodrigues etal, 1995; Chaves etal, 2002).
I.3.5.2.	Drought avoidance
Plants that tend to avoid drought generally have tissues that are very sensitive to dehydration, and thus they have to avoid water deficits whenever water shortage occurs (Ludlow, 1989). Dehydration avoidance is common to both annuals and perennials and is associated with a variety of adaptative traits. These involve maximising water uptake and minimising water loss (Chaves etal, 2003).
The most effective protection against drought is a deep, extensively branched root system that can absorb water from a large volume of soil (Arndt, 2000). Moreover, roots with low hydraulic conductance or few but long roots can permit a slow but sustainable supply of water to the plant (Passioura, 1983).
Water movement from the roots to the atmosphere is controlled by the conductance of the components of the water pathway (Lovisolo and Schubert, 1998). Traditionally, stomatal conductance and root conductivity have been considered the main controlling factors of water flow in the plant (Jones, 1992). However, the efficiency of the water transport system (the xylem vessels in angiosperms) can also significantly affect water movement by imposing conductivity constrains (Tyree and Ewers, 1991). It has been reported that water stress affects shoot conductivity by inducing embolism in xylem vessels (Schultz and Matthews, 1988; Tyree and Sperry, 1989; Tognetti et al, 1996) or by a reduction in the vessel diameter (Lovisolo and Schubert, 1998). Embolisms are important because they reduce the hydraulic conductivity of the xylem, giving rise to the possibility of 'runaway’ reduction in hydraulic conductivity unless transpiration is reduced to relieve tension and prevent further cavitation (Tyree and Ewers,
1991). Adaptation requires a fine balance because features that reduce vulnerability to cavitation, narrow conduits and many inter-conduit connections, also reduce hydraulic conductivity that generates the high xylem tensions that trigger cavitation (Sperry, 2003). In general, vessels with narrow diameters are less susceptible to embolism (Lovisolo and Schubert,
1998). However, variations in xylem conduit diameter can radically affect the function of the conducting system because of the fourth-power relationship between radius and flow through a capillary tube, as described by the Hagen-Poiseuille law (Fahn, 1986).
Leaves growing under conditions of water deficiency develop smaller but more densely distributed stomata. This modification makes a leaf able to reduce transpiration by a quicker onset of stomatal regulation (Larcher, 1995). Stomata are mainly confined to the abaxial surface and are often hidden beneath dense hair or in depressions (grooves or crypts). In this way the boundary layer resistance is increased and the air outside the stomata becomes moister (Larcher, 1995). Other morpho-anatomical traits that help to minimize water loss during drought include leaf rolling (Schwabe and Lionakis, 1996), dense leaf pubescence (Palliotti et al, 1994; Karabourniotis and Bornman, 1999; Liakoura et al, 1999), a thick cuticle and epicuticular wax layer (Leon and Bukovac, 1978; Liakoura et al, 1999; Richardson and Berlyn,
2002), heavily lignified tissue (Richardson and Berlyn, 2002), smaller mesophyll cells and less intercellular spaces (Bongi et al, 1987; Mediavilla et al, 2001). Moreover, leaf movements, such as para-heliotropism, can also prevent damage by high temperatures, dehydration, and photoinhibition (Ludlow, 1989). Another common feature in water stressed plants is the reduction of the canopy leaf area through reduced growth and shedding of older leaves. This usually begins with the oldest leaves and progresses toward stem tips. Although the loss of leaves results also in a reduction of the photosynthetic surface it consequently reduces water loss and prolongs survival (Kozlowski et al, 1991).
Ludlow (1989) outlined the ecophysiological implications of drought avoidance. Plants that avoid water deficits by obtaining access to water deep in the soil may have little penalty in terms of carbon acquisition. On the other hand, in plants where water deficits are avoided by minimising water loss, rather than maximising water uptake, there will be both short- and longterm costs for carbon acquisition, depending upon whether the responses are elastic or plastic. Elastic responses, like stomatal closure or leaf movements, allow leaves to survive short-term stress periods, and so contribute to growth and yield after rainfalls, and so there may be few long-term costs. In contrast, for plastic responses, like reduced leaf area expansion in new leaves or the shedding of older leaves, there will be both short- and long-term costs.
In summary, because of their ability to postpone or avoid tissue water deficits, plants that avoid drought could be said to have good short-term survival. However, they have poor long-term survival, because the avoidance mechanisms eventually fail to prevent dehydration of tissues that are relatively sensitive to desiccation (Ludlow, 1980).
1.3.5.3.	Drought tolerance
The ultimate drought strategy is drought tolerance (Connor, 2005). Drought tolerance refers to adaptations that allow the plant to withstand the stress, with or without a reduction in performance.
Osmotic adjustment is generally regarded as an important drought tolerance mechanism. Osmotic adjustment, or accumulation of solutes by cells, is a process by which water potential can be decreased without an accompanying decrease in turgor (Taiz and Zieger,
1998). It is normally a slow process (at least in shoots) and is triggered above a certain threshold of cell water deficit (Chaves etal., 2003).
It is usually accepted that the increase in cellular osmolarity which results from the accumulation of non-toxic (thus 'compatible) osmotically active solutes is accompanied by the influx of water into, or at least a reduced efflux from cells, thus providing the turgor necessary for cell expansion (Hare et al, 1998). Nonetheless, a conclusive demonstration that osmotic adjustment contributes to fitness in stressful environments has yet to be achieved (Munns, 1993).
Most of the adjustment can usually be accounted for by increases in concentration of a variety of common solutes including sugars, organic acids, and ions (especially K+) (Taiz and Zieger, 1998). Enzymes extracted from the cytosol of plant cells have been shown to be severely inhibited by high concentrations of ions. The accumulation of ions during osmotic adjustment appears to occur mainly in the vacuoles, where are kept out of contact with enzymes in the cytosol or subcellular organelles (Taiz and Zieger, 1998). Because of this compartmentation of ions, other solutes must accumulate in the cytoplasm to maintain water potential equilibrium within the cell. These other solutes, called compatible solutes (or compatible osmolytes), are organic compounds that not interfere with enzyme functions. These compatible solutes may protect cell membrane and the metabolic machinery under dehydration (Chaves et al, 2003). However, it should be pointed out that osmoprotection mechanisms are probably not functional until severe dehydration occurs, with the implication that osmotic adjustment may be critical to survival rather than to increase plant growth and crop yield under drought (Chaves etal, 2003).
The osmotic compounds synthesised in response to water stress include amino acids like proline, aspartic acid and glutamic acid (Samuel et al, 2000; Hamilton and Heckathorn, 2001), methylated quaternary ammonium compounds (e.g. glycine betaine) (Rathinasabapathi et al, 2001; Sakamoto and Murata, 2000), carbohydrates (Vijn and Smeekens, 1999), polyols (Smirnoff, 1998) and low-molecular-weight proteins (Ingram and Bartels, 1996).
One of the most studied compatible solutes is the amino acid proline. Accumulation of high proline content in cells has also been associated with prevention of protein denaturation, preservation of enzyme structure and activity (Rajendrakumar et al, 1994; Samuel et al., 2000), and protection of membranes from damage by reactive oxygen species produced under drought and high-light conditions (Saradhi et al, 1995; Hamilton and Heckathorn, 2001).
Betaines are quaternary ammonium compounds in which the nitrogen atom is fully methylated (Chen and Murata, 2002). The most common betaines in plants include glycine betaine (GB, the most widely studied betaine), as well as proline betaine, p-alanine betaine, choline-O-sulfate and 3-dimethylsulfoniopropionate (McNeil et al, 1999; Rhodes and Hanson, 1993). GB is widely distributed in higher plants and is synthesized in many species at elevated rates in response to various types of environmental stress, appearing to be a critical determinant of stress tolerance (Rhodes and Hanson, 1993). In addition, studies in vitro have shown that GB is effective as a compatible solute in stabilizing the quaternary structures of enzymes and complex proteins, as well as in maintaining the highly ordered state of membranes (Papageorgiou and Murata, 1995).
In several species, polyols accumulate in leaves in response to water stress (Noiraud et al., 2000). The most common polyols in plants include acyclic forms, mannitol, glycerol, sorbitol, and cyclic forms (cyclitols), ononitol and pinitol (Ashraf and Harris, 2004). In addition to their role in osmoregulation, polyols also function as oxygen radical scavengers. For example, mannitol was found in vitro to act as a scavenger of hydroxyl radical (Halliwell and Gutteridge,
1999), thereby protecting the proteins from oxidative damage in drought stressed plants (Moran et al, 1994).
In general, soluble sugars content tends to be maintained in the leaves of droughted plants, in spite of lower rates of carbon assimilation (Chaves et al, 2003). This is achieved at the expenses of starch, which drastically declines (Chaves, 1991). This response favours osmorregulation, enhances desiccation tolerance and allows metabolic activity to be regained more quickly in young leaves (Chaves etal, 2003).
During drought periods, plants undergo many physiological changes and induce a large number of genes for adaptation (Ingram and Bartels, 1996). A typical change in gene expression is the induction of genes involved in the synthesis of low-molecular-weight proteins, e.g. dehydrins and late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins (Ingram and Bartels, 1996). The functions of LEA proteins are multiple as they are involved not only in seed maturation and desiccation but also in vegetative organs, where they can stabilise enzyme complexes and membrane structures and promote ion sequestration (Close, 1996; Garay-Arroyo et al, 2000).
Dehydrins are involved in a range of responses to abiotic stress that share a dehydration component (e.g. low temperature and salt stress). However, the mechanisms by which dehydrin synthesis is enhanced and is functions in vivo remain poorly understood (Cellier et al,
2000). There is increasing evidence that another class of proteins, the small heat-shock proteins (sHsps), may play a role in cellular protection during dehydration (Alamillo et al, 1995; Alper and Olivier, 2002). Strong evidence support that sHsps function as molecular chaperones (Hendrick and Hartl, 1995; Hong and Vierling, 2000) that bind to partially folded or denatured substrate proteins and thereby prevent irreversible aggregation or promote correct substrate folding (Sun et al, 2002). They are also described as being developmentally regulated, being abundant in dry mature seeds, and disappearing during germination (Wehmeyer et al, 1996).
Although compatible solutes must be compartmentalized to perform their physiological roles, the mechanisms that generate and maintain this compartmentation have received little attention to date. Membrane associated carriers or transporters are probably involved in differentially distributing osmolytes within the cell and may also participate in regulating the transport and distribution of these solutes throughout the plant (Bray et al, 2000). Aquaporins have been implicated as the major facilitators for the movement of water across membranes (Chrispeels and Agre, 1994; Bray et al, 2000). In addition, the capacity of aquaporins to transport small neutral solutes and/or gases has raised the intriguing possibility that aquaporins may work as membrane channels with multiple functions (Tyerman et al, 2002). Evidence suggests that aquaporins (or water channel proteins) may facilitate water movement in drought-stressed tissues and promote the rapid recovery of turgor on watering (Bray et al, 2000).
Changes in the elastic properties of plant cell walls can also contribute to turgor maintenance under drought (Patakas and Noitsakis, 1999). An inelastic cell wall should act to increase the uptake of water from drying soil because more negative water potentials would result from a relatively small decrease in water content (Schulte, 1993). On the other hand, a more flexible cell should allow shrinkage during water loss, thus maintaining high turgor for a given change in water content (Robichaux et al, 1984; Joly and Zaerr, 1987; Patakas and Noitsakis, 1999).
The extreme desiccation tolerance is found in the angiosperm resurrection plants’ as well as in some ferns, non-vascular plants, algae and lichens (Chaves et al, 2003). The leaves of resurrection plants, like Craterostigma plantagineum, can equilibrate with air close to 0-2% (v/v) relative humidity and are still able to fully recover their physiological activity upon rehydration (Bartels et al, 1990). When water is withheld from mature individuals of C.
plantagineum, changes rapidly occur at the messenger RNA and protein levels, eventually leading to the tolerant state (Ingram and Bartels, 1996).
The disadvantage of tolerance of water deficits is that the continued carbon fixation is inevitably accompanied by water loss. Thus, plant water status must ultimately fall, what can result in some cases in death (Arndt, 2000).
1.3.6.	Oxidative damage induced by drought
Under water stress, when the use of absorbed light in either photosynthesis or photorespiration and the thermal dissipation are not enough to cope with excess energy, the production of highly reactive molecules is exacerbated (Chaves et al., 2003). The excess of reducing power determines a redirection of photon energy into processes that favour the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mainly in the photosynthetic (Asada, 1999) and mitochondrial electron transport chains (Moller, 2001). Reactive oxygen species is a collective term often used to include not only the oxygen radicals but also some non-radical derivatives of O2 (Table 1.1) (Halliwell and Gutteridge, 1999).

Formally, the ROS represent the products of successive single-electron reductions of oxygen (Eqn. 1 in Figure 1.3). Ground state O2 is a triplet-state molecule and is relatively unreactive, but it can accept a single electron from a variety of reducing agent, particularly if it has been converted to the singlet stage (for instance, by the transfer of energy from photochemically excited chlorophyll), if the reducing agent has been photochemically excited, or if the oxygen and reducing agents are in the presence of an appropriate enzyme (Gaspar et al,
2002). The product of this reduction is superoxide, which under acidic conditions protonates to the hydroperoxyl radical (Eqn. 2 in Figure 1.3). Subsequent reductions will form hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radical, and water. In cells, the appearance of H2O2 and hydroxyl radical generally does not occur through the sequence of reactions shown in Eqn. 2. Instead, once superoxide has been synthesized, interconversions of the various ROS may account for the appearance of the more reduced forms. For instance, disproportionation of hydroperoxyl radical, or of superoxide in the presence of superoxide dismutase (SOD), forms hydrogen peroxide (Eqn. 3a,b in Figure 1.3). The combination of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide in the presence of iron or other transition metals forms hydroxyl radical (the Fenton reaction - Eqn. 4a,b in Figure 1.3).

Reactions producing ROS and organic free radicals (Gaspar etal, 2002).
ROS are necessary for the correct functioning of plants and can play a role in inter- and intracellular signalling (Foyer and Noctor, 1999). Plants are endowed with a complex antioxidant system to cope with ROS (Smirnoff, 1993). However, when the accumulation of ROS under water stress conditions exceeds the removing capacity of the antioxidant system, the effects of
oxidative damage arise, including lipid peroxidation and oxidation of DNA and proteins, destruction of photosynthetic pigments and inactivation of photosynthetic enzymes (Smirnoff, 1993; Yordanov et al, 2000). Oxidative stress is a general term defined by Sies (1991) as 'a disturbance in the prooxidant-antioxidant balance in favour of the former, leading to potential damage. Such damage is often called oxidative damage.
Oxidative stress can result in adaptation or cell injury. Cells can usually tolerate mild oxidative stress, which often results in up-regulation of the synthesis of antioxidant defence systems an in attempt to restore the oxidant/antioxidant balance (Halliwell and Gutteridge,
1999). However, severe drought may cause cell injury, especially in the field, when there is too much light and the plants cannot dissipate excess excitation energy (Smirnoff, 1993; Asada, 1996; Osmond et al, 1997). In photosynthetic tissues the risk of cell injury is increased because of the presence of photosensitizing pigments (Garcia-Plazaola and Becerril, 1999).
ROS, especially hydroxyl radical, play a crucial role in causing cellular injury under drought stress (Reddy et al, 2004). Free radicals can attack directly polyunsaturated fatty acids in membranes and initiate lipid peroxidation (Cabiscol et al, 2000). It is widely reported that ROS bring about peroxidation of membrane lipids leading to membrane damage (Shalata and Tal, 1998). Some studies have been shown lipid peroxidation in water-deficit conditions (Paulin et al, 1986; Sofo et al, 2004a). Since cell membranes are the first targets of many plant stresses, the maintenance of their integrity and stability under water stress conditions is a major component of drought tolerance in plants (Bajji et al, 2002). On the other hand, membrane disruption leads to a series of events, namely the decrease of photosynthetic activity (Lauriano et al, 2000). Traditionally, lipid peroxidation is quantified by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal, the degradation products of polyunsaturated fatty acids hydroperoxides (Esterbauer et al, 1991). Sensitive colorimetric assays have been developed to measure these aldehydes, but is probably best to report the results as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) due to the possibility of the presence of substances (e.g. pigments and sugars) either produced in vivo or in vitro during tissue work-up that interfere with the analyses (Smirnoff, 1993; Davies and Swanson, 2001).
A decrease in the protein concentration has been observed in drought-stressed plants (Seel et al., 1992; Moran et al, 1994). Attack of ROS upon proteins produces carbonyls and other amino acid modifications (Halliwell and Gutteridge, 1999). Thiol groups can be easily oxidized by attack of many ROS and by direct reaction with transition-metal ions, forming thiyl radicals (Halliwell and Gutteridge, 1999). These modifications lead to functional changes that disturb cellular metabolism. Although several mechanisms of protein oxidation are known in
detail, most of the studies were done in in vitro systems. In vivo modifications of proteins due to oxidative stress have been much less studied, especially because of the difficulty to identify modified proteins in a whole extract (Cabiscol etal, 2000).
DNA is also a main target of ROS. DNA is the blueprint for both future form and function. Any damage to its integrity could mean that proteins that would have been essential for optimal function of the plant will not be synthesized (Mundree etai, 2002).
According to Smirnoff (1993), the decrease of chlorophyll content (chlorophyll bleaching) is a typical symptom of oxidative stress and may be the result of chlorophyll degradation or be due to chlorophyll synthesis deficiency together with changes of thylakoid membrane structure. Bussis et al (1998) indicated that expanded leaves exposed to water deficit started to degrade their photosynthetic apparatus, possibly to mobilise resources for the production of new acclimated leaves.
1.3.7.	Protection against oxidative damage
Before discussing specific components that protect plants from ROS under drought, we should note that the exquisitely sophisticated mechanisms that regulate electron transport and photosynthesis in general, are, in fact, the primary defence against oxidative stress (Perl-Treves and Perl, 2002). One of the most studied forms of protection is the non-photochemical energy dissipation resulting in a lower quantum yield of photosynthesis, similar to photoinduced damage, except that no maximal photosynthetic rate reduction is observed (Osmond, 1994; Demmig-Adams and Adams, 1996). Overexcitation and overreduction of the photosynthetic apparatus are thus avoided, and the formation of ROS is reduced to a minimum.
To mitigate the oxidative damage initiated by ROS, plants have developed a complex antioxidative defence system that include enzymatic and non-enzymatic and antioxidants (Figure 1.4). These compounds and enzymes are not distributed uniformly, so defence systems vary among specific subcellular compartments. The degree to which the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the amount of antioxidants increase under drought stress are extremely variable among several plant species and even between two cultivars of the same species. Antioxidant capacity is also greatly dependent on the severity of stress, as well as the species and the developmental stage (Chaves etal, 2003).
Acclimation to drought is generally associated with enhanced activity of the antioxidant enzymes, thus keeping ROS concentration relatively low (Smirnoff, 1998). Superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase and catalase are important enzymes that protect plants against oxidative damage (Santos et al., 2004). Normally, the production of hydroxyl radical is
limited by the presence of superoxide dismutases (SODs, EC 1.15.1.1.) which keep superoxide concentration low (Gaspar et al, 2002). SODs are metalloenzymes first discovered by McCord and Fridovich (1969) that dismutate superoxide anion to hydrogen peroxide (Eqn. 3b in Figure 1.3; Figure 1.4). Because superoxide is the first product of univalent reduction of oxygen and also the first species to form in many biological systems, SOD is considered as the 'primary defence ’ against oxygen radicals (Bannister et al, 1987). SOD is the fastest enzyme known and its three-dimensional structure has been intensely studied (Kitagawa et al, 1991; Getzoff et al.,
1992). The dismutation is catalyzed by the metal ion at the active site (Perl-Treves and Perl, 2002). SODs are classified as MnSODs and FeSODs, both types are phylogenetically related, and a third unrelated class of Cu/ZnSODs (Perl-Treves and Perl, 2002). Plants contain all three types, and distinct SOD isoenzymes have been identified in the cytosol, mitochondria, chloroplasts (Kanematsu and Asada, 1990; Bowler et al, 1992), peroxisomes (Sandalio and del Rio, 1988), glioxisomes (Bueno and del Rio, 1992), and in the extracellular space (Castillo et al, 1987; Schinkel et al., 1998).
O2
Figure 1.4
Defence systems (enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants) against ROS (Adapted from Gaspar et al, 2002).
The product of SOD, hydrogen peroxide, requires further detoxification. This is achieved by other enzymes and non-enzymatic antioxidants that may differ among the various subcellular compartments (Perl-Treves and Perl, 2002). In the chloroplasts, the so-called 'Asada-Halliwell pathway’ of detoxification has been studied in detail (Figure 1.4) (Foyer and Halliwell, 1976; Nakano and Asada, 1981; for a review see Creissen et al., 1994).
Catalase (EC 1.11.1.6) or peroxidases (EC 1.11.1.7), which remove hydrogen peroxide, also restrict the production of hydroxyl radical (Gaspar et al, 2002). On the other hand, free radicals may be formed also by peroxidases, using H2O2 as initial oxidant (Eqn. 5a,b,c in Figure 1.3; Figure 1.4).
Non-enzymatic antioxidants play an important role delaying or preventing the oxidation of cellular oxidable substrates (Singh and Rajini, 2004). They exert their effects by scavenging ROS, activating a battery of detoxifying proteins, or preventing the generation of ROS (Halliwell et al, 1992). The major antioxidants in plants are ascorbate, reduced glutathione, a-tocopherol, and carotenoids (Figure 1.4) (Gaspar etal, 2002).
Ascorbate (AA), also known as ascorbic acid or vitamin C, is one of the most studied and powerful antioxidants (Smirnoff, 1996; Noctor and Foyer, 1998; Blokhina et al, 2003). It has been detected in the majority of plant cell types, organelles and in the apoplast (Blokhina et al,
2003). The ability to donate electrons in a wide range of enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions makes AA the main ROS-detoxifying compound in aqueous phase (Blokhina et al,
2003). AA can directly scavenge superoxide, hydroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen and reduce hydrogen peroxide to water via ascorbate peroxidase reaction (Noctor and Foyer, 1998). In chloroplasts, AA acts as a cofactor of violaxantin de-epoxidase thus sustaining dissipation of excess exitation energy (Smirnoff, 2000). AA also regenerates tocopherol from tocopheroxyl radical providing membrane protection (Thomas et al, 1992).
Tocopherols (tocopherol isomers: a-, p-, y-, 8-) are essential components of biological membranes where they have both antioxidant and non-antioxidant functions (Kagan, 1989). Tocopherols act as chemical scavengers of oxygen radicals, especially singlet oxygen (via irreversible oxidation), and as physical deactivators of singlet oxygen by charge transfer mechanism (Fryer, 1992). Relative antioxidant activity of the tocopherol isomers in vivo is a &gt; p &gt; y &gt; 8 which is due to the methylation pattern and the amount of methyl groups attached to the phenolic ring of the polar head structure (Blokhina et al, 2003). Plants synthesize tocopherols by enzymes localized in the inner chloroplast membrane (Soll et al, 1985). Chloroplast membranes contain a-tocopherol as the predominant tocopherol isomer, and are hence well protected against photooxidative damage (Fryer, 1992). Being a lipid-soluble
molecule, it is very important as a chain terminator of free-radical reactions that cause membrane-lipid peroxidation (Burton et al, 1982).
Glutathione, (y-glutamylcysteinylglycine, GSH) is the major low molecular weight thiol compound in most plants and acts as disulphide reductant to protect thiol groups on enzymes, regenerate ascorbate and react with singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radical (Arora etal, 2002).
Carotenoids are lipid-soluble molecules that protect plants against oxidative damage. In the photosynthetic apparatus, p-carotene quenches both excited triplet-state chlorophyll and singlet oxygen, preventing them from initiating lipid peroxidation (Parker and Joyce, 1967). An excited p-carotene molecule can return to the ground state either by energy transfer to other pigments in the antenna (acting as secondary photosynthetic pigment, but also by heat dissipation (acting as quencher of superfluous excitation energy) (Perl-Treves and Perl, 2002).
A particular class of carotenoids, the xantophylls, constitute a pool that undergoes prominent changes in response to strong light (Perl-Treves and Perl, 2002). The size, as well as the composition of the pool change, allows better photoprotection. Zeaxanthin, the deepoxidized form, better dissipates energy and is derived from the epoxidized pigment violaxanthin. The rapid changes between the two forms, brought about by special enzymes, constitute the 'xantophyll cycle’ (Demmig-Adams and Adams, 1996).
Under drought, plants usually increase endogenous a-tocopherol and carotenoid levels to cope with oxidative stress (Fryer, 1992; Munne-Bosch and Alegre, 2000). However, oxidative damage appears in severe stress, if the pools of a-tocopherol and xantophyll are not efficiently restored by AA and reduced glutathione (Liebler et al, 1986; Eskling et al, 1997).
Other compounds also may provide some protection from free radical injury under drought stress. Flavonoids are a group of phenolic compounds that may have antioxidant activity (Yuting et al, 1990). As previously reported in section 1.3.5.3., some compatible solutes may also function as antioxidants, such as proline (Saradhi et al, 1995; Hamilton and Heckathorn, 2001) and mannitol (Halliwell and Gutteridge, 1999).
1.3.8.	Olive capacity to withstand arid environments
Olive is a perennial, long-lived, evergreen tree of subtropical origin (Bongi and Palliotti, 1994) that, in the Mediterranean, flowers in mid-to-late spring. This adaptation allows olive to escape the deleterious effects of cold on flowering and fruit set but serves to increase reliance on a range of avoidance and tolerance mechanisms that maintain internal water status and metabolic activity during the hot, dry summers (Connor, 2005).
Olive tree is well known to be very resistant to drought (Fernández and Moreno, 1999; Giorio et al., 1999; Tognetti et al, 2004; Connor, 2005). Furthermore, it has been postulated that the minimum water requirement for olive is 200 mm year-1 (Bongi and Palliotti, 1994). Abd-El-Rahman et al (1966) measured the water content of olive leaves at saturation, finding a value, 1.59 g water g-1 dry weight, extremely low compared with other species growing in the same environment (5.77 g water g-1 dry weight for fig, 5.85 g water g-1 dry weight for grape). There are many mechanisms by which it resists to more or less extended drought periods but some differences among olive cultivars have been observed concerning their ability for adaptation and production under drought conditions (Chartzoulakis et al, 1999a; Bosabalidis and Kofidis, 2002).
Olive culture has prospered under rainfed conditions in Mediterranean environments because the tree is capable of acceptable yield while subjected to the characteristic prolonged summer water shortage. Olive achieves this result with physiological, biochemical and morpho-anatomical responses that reduce water loss and maintain water uptake at high plant water status as drought commences (drought avoidance), and with others that tolerate dehydration at low plant water status as the drought deepens (drought tolerance) (Connor and Ferreres, 2005).
Olive leaves are well designed to control water loss. Morphological characteristics allow minimum radiation load and maximum heat exchange while the physiological responses of stomata to leaf water status and atmospheric humidity provide effective control of transpiration (Loreto and Sharkey, 1990; Fernández et al, 1997). Leaves minimise radiation load by small size, a dominantly vertical display (Mariscal et al, 2000) that is further aided by paraheliotropic movement under water stress (Natali et al, 1999) (Figure 1.5A), a dense packing of the mesophyll layers (Bongi et al, 1987) and high reflectivity by a thick cuticle and epicuticular wax layers (Leon and Bukovac, 1978) (Figure 1.5B). This combination of morphological features restricts temperature increase in leaves with small latent heat exchange when transpiration is restricted by stomatal closure.
Stomata are small and dense and occur only on the abaxial surface, under dense layers of peltate trichomes (or peltate scales) (Figure 1.5C). The peltate trichomes reflect the sunlight and reduce the transpiration of the leaves.

An interesting characteristic in the anatomy of olive leaf is the presence of a complicated, dense network of filiform sclereids that are of idioblast nature (Karabourniotis et al, 1994) (Figure 1.5D). This entangled network follows two major distribution patterns: the 'subepidermal layer consisting of the 'T -shaped sclereids extending between the adaxial epidermis and the palisade layer, and the branched the 'polimorphic sclereids that transverse the spongy mesophyll layers, producing a chaotic pattern. Sclereids act like synthetic optical fibres and, besides other functions, may contribute to the improvement of the light microenvironment within the mesophyll of the thick and compact sclerophyllous olive leaves (Karabourniotis et al, 1994).
(Chartzoulakis et al, 1999a; Bosabalidis and Kofidis, 2002). However, Lo Gullo and Salleo (1988) observed that despite all this protection against water loss, leaves of the wild olive tree (Olea oleaster underwent a substantial water loss under conditions of water stress.
A drought avoidance response not displayed by olive is the development of a deep rooting system (Bongi and Palliotti, 1994). However, the extensive root system of olive tree seems to be designed for absorbing the water of the light and intermittent rainfall usual in its habitat (Fernández and Moreno, 1999). Most of the main roots grow more or less in parallel to the soil surface, and the highest root density is found close to the trunk, although the volume explored by the roots can easily extend beyond the canopy projection (Fernández and Moreno, 1999). This rooting habit is probably the result of sensitivity to hypoxia and may allow for efficient water absorption (Bongi and Palliotti, 1994; Fernández and Moreno, 1999). A high portion of the root is of small diameter, which also favours the absorption capacity. Absorption by olive roots is also enhanced by high potential gradients between roots and soil caused by osmotic adjustment (Fernández and Moreno, 1999).
The olive is a diffuse-porous tree having a dense wood with abundant fibers and little parenchyma (Fernández and Moreno, 1999). The large amount of fibers, which makes olive wood so hard, accounts for the low vessel lumina of the species in comparison with other diffuse-porous Mediterranean plants. Salleo et al (1985) observed that the vessel lumina, when expressed as percentage of the total xylem cross-sectional area, was half that measured in other Mediterranean species such as Vitis vinifera. The low hydraulic conductivity of olive xylem is a feature that seems to play an important role in the tree's water relations. Salleo and Lo Gullo (1993) observed losses of about 10% of hydraulic conductivity in 1-year-old twigs of young Olea oleaster trees, when these became stressed, due to xylem cavitation. One consequence of this is that olive trees prevent excessive water loss on days of high water demand by closing their stomata soon after midmorning (Fernández et al, 1997).
During periods of water stress, olive tree typically experience reductions in transpiration, stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis (Giorio et al, 1999). Nevertheless, environmental and physiological factors do not affect H2O and CO2 exchange to the same extent, resulting in possible variations in water use efficiency in this species (Xiloyannis et al, 1988). Meanwhile, some differences in gas exchange responses to water stress between olive cultivars have been observed in previous experiments (e.g. Chartzoulakis etal, 1999b; Tognetti etal, 2002).
accumulation in the various plant parts, in particular in the root system, creating a higher root/leaf ratio compared to well-watered plants (Xiloyannis et al., 1999).
Olive tolerates drought by maintaining turgor through osmotic adjustment and changes in cell wall elasticity (Connor, 2005). Active and passive osmotic adjustment play an important role in maintaining cell turgor and leaf activities which depend on it (Xiloyannis et al, 1999). Mannitol and glucose play a major part in the osmotic adjustment of olive leaves (Cataldi et al,
2000). In addition, the osmotic adjustment observed in the root system allows maintenance of cell turgor, avoiding or delaying the separation of roots from soil particles (Xiloyannis et al, 1999). The accumulation of proline under drought stress in both leaves and roots of 2-year-old O. europaea (cv. Coratina) plants (Sofo et al, 2004a) also indicates a possible role of proline in drought tolerance.
Under field conditions, particularly in the Mediterranean regions, water stress is often accompanied by other environmental constraints, such as steep leaf-to-air water vapour gradients, and high irradiance and temperature (Osorio et al, 2006). Measurements have revealed non-stomatal limitations to photosynthesis consistent with photoinhibition in olive leaves exposed to high irradiance (Angelopoulos et al, 1996). The synergic action of high irradiance level and water stress reduces the capacity of the photosynthetic systems to utilize incident radiation, leading to a higher degree of photodamage (Sofo et al, 2004b). The increase of malondialdehyde content and lipoxygenase activity, two markers of oxidative damage, observed by Sofo et al. (2004a) in both leaf and root tissues of olive plants during the progressive increment of drought stress, indicate that water deficit induces lipid peroxidation. This result suggests that higher activities of some antioxidant enzymes and non-enzymatic antioxidants are required for a better protection against oxidative stress related to water deficit.

2.	SCLEROPHYLLY AND LEAF ANATOMICAL TRAITS OF FIVE FIELD-GROWN OLIVE CULTIVARS GROWING UNDER DROUGHT CONDITIONS
2.1.	Abstract
Leaf-level morphological and structural adaptations to reduce water loss were examined in five olive (Olea europaea L.) tree cultivars (Arbequina, Blanqueta, Cobrangosa, Manzanilla and Negrinha) growing under field conditions with low water availability. Leaf measurements included leaf tissue thickness, stomatal density, leaf area, leaf mass per unit area, density of leaf tissue, relative water content, succulence, water saturation deficit, water content at saturation and cuticular transpiration rate. We found considerable genotypic differences among the cultivars. Negrinha, Manzanilla and Cobrangosa had more morphological and structural leaf adaptations to protect against water loss than the other cultivars. Manzanilla and Negrinha enhanced their sclerophylly by building parenchyma tissues and increasing protective structures like the upper cuticle and both the upper and lower epidermis. Cobrangosa exhibited good protection against water loss through high density of foliar tissue and by thick cuticle and trichome layers. Compared with the Negrinha, Manzanilla and Cobrangosa cultivars, Arbequina leaves had a thinner trichome layer, implying that the leaves were less protected against water loss; however, the development of smaller leaves may reduce water loss at the whole-plant level. Among cultivars, Blanqueta had the largest leaves and some anatomical traits that may lead to high water loss, especially from the adaxial surface. The mechanisms employed by the cultivars to cope with summer stress are discussed at the morpho-structural level.

2.2.	Introduction
During the summer, olive (Olea europaea L.), like other Mediterranean xerophytes, is usually subjected to high solar irradiances, high air temperatures, high vapour pressure deficits and limited water availability. The severity of these stresses is predicted to increase in the future as a result of global environmental change (Fischer etal, 2001; Centritto, 2002).
Plant responses to water scarcity are complex, involving adaptive changes or deleterious effects (Chaves et al, 2002), or both. Several studies (e.g. Castro-Diez et al, 1999; Bussoti et al., 2002) have shown that some species react to adverse environmental field conditions with
an increase in sclerophylly. Because the leaf is the most flexible organ in its response to environmental conditions (Nevo etal., 2000), its structure reflects, more clearly than that of the stem and roots, the effects of severe summer stress. Leaves of xeromorphic plants are characterized by a low surface/volume ratio (Karabourniotis and Bornman, 1999; Richardson and Berlyn, 2002) as a result of changes in cell number and cellular dimensions (Chartzoulakis et al, 2000), and by a greater density of both the vascular system and stomata (Bolhar-Nordenkampf, 1987). Other morpho-anatomical traits that help to minimize water loss during drought include leaf rolling (Schwabe and Lionakis, 1996), dense leaf pubescence (Palliotti et al, 1994; Karabourniotis and Bornman, 1999; Liakoura et al, 1999), a thick cuticle and epicuticular wax layer (Leon and Bukovac, 1978; Liakoura et al, 1999; Richardson and Berlyn, 2002), heavily lignified tissue (Richardson and Berlyn, 2002), smaller mesophyll cells and less intercellular space (Bongi et al, 1987; Mediavilla et al, 2001). Such traits are frequently accompanied by the accumulation of mucilage and other secondary metabolites (Margaris, 1981).
Olive leaves are well adapted to avoid excessive water loss during the severe summer drought that characterizes the Mediterranean region where this species grows (Fernández and Moreno, 1999). These adaptations to drought imply a metabolic cost because reserves are diverted from growth (Bussoti et al, 2002). Mechanisms like the reduction in leaf area almost certainly lead to a significant reduction in productivity (Turner and Jones, 1980). Because of this trade-off, differences have been observed among olive cultivars in their ability to adapt to drought conditions (Chartzoulakis et al, 1999).
Olive has traditionally been grown in Trás-os-Montes (northeast Portugal) where it is of considerable economic and social importance. The region produces almost 25% of Portuguese olive oil. Its excellent quality and unique characteristics are responsible for the protected origin denomination of olive oil from Trás-os-Montes. Although the cultivars most frequently grown in the region are considered to be well adapted to drought, there are no studies documenting the drought adaptations of these cultivars. We tested the hypothesis that adaptation to drought is effected by an increase in sclerophylly. Specifically, we compared, under field conditions, the olive cultivars most commonly grown in the region with foreign cultivars to identify morphological and structural adaptations that reduce water loss, and specific leaf-level mechanisms that enable olive trees to cope with summer stress.
2.3.	Materials and methods
2.3.1.	Study site
The experiment was conducted in a shallow schistic soil at Mirandela in northeast Portugal (41°31' N and 7°12' W) at 250 m above sea level. The climate at this xeric study site is typically Mediterranean with high temperatures and severe drought during the summer (Figure
2.1)	(INMG, 1991). Mean annual rainfall is 520.1 mm, most of which falls in the winter with negligible rainfall during the summer months, although periods of drought can occur during winter. The warmest months are July/August and the coldest months are December/January, with mean daily temperatures of 23.6/22.9 and 6.3/6.1 °C, respectively. During the study year (2001), temperature and rainfall differed from the mean values (Figure 2.1). Rainfall was extremely high during the winter months (reaching 284 mm in March) and rare during the summer months. Two months before the measurements, rainfall was almost zero, ensuring the development of leaves under drought conditions.

2.3.2.	Plant material, leaf anatomy study and tissue measurements
We studied five cultivars of field-grown, unirrigated, 10-year-old, own-rooted olive trees. Two cultivars, Cobrangosa and Negrinha, originated in Trás-os-Montes (Portugal). Cobrangosa is a regional cultivar with a wide distribution throughout Trás-os-Montes, whereas Negrinha (denomination of origin) is a local cultivar from Freixo de Espada a Cinta. Both cultivars have high economic significance in the region (Gomes et al., 1998). The other cultivars are native to different regions of Spain. Arbequina is the major cultivar in Cataluña (northeast), Blanqueta is of great importance in Valencia and Alicante (southeast), and Manzanilla is important in Extremadura (centre). Arbequina and Blanqueta are from regions with a Mediterranean climate, tempered by a maritime influence, and Manzanilla comes from the central interior of the Iberian Peninsula, with a climate similar to Trás-os-Montes.
Leaf material was collected on July 25, 2001, and all anatomical studies and tissue measurements were performed on 10 healthy, current-year, sun-exposed, fully expanded mature leaves. Because sclerophylly does not change substantially through time in mature leaves (Gratani, 1996; Bussoti etal, 2002), the study was restricted to the summer period.
The thickness of leaf blade, palisade and spongy parenchyma, upper and lower epidermis, and trichome layer were measured in leaf cross sections of fresh material prepared for microscopic examination. Sections were taken from the middle of the leaves to avoid differential thickness along the leaf.
Upper cuticle thickness was assessed after staining fresh material with Sudan III, which stains the cuticle components a deep red (McLean and Ivimey Cook, 1965). We were unable to distinguish between the lower epidermis and the lower cuticle layer.
To make stomatal impressions, one or two coats of polish (colodium) were applied to the abaxial surface of each leaf after peltate hairs were removed. The polish was then carefully peeled off and placed on a microscope slide. The number of stomata was determined for 10 peels per cultivar.
2.3.3.	Morphology, sclerophylly and leaf water relations parameters
At midday, three sun-exposed mature leaves were gathered from each of five trees per cultivar. The following parameters were examined: leaf area (LA), measured with an LI-3100 leaf area meter (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE), fresh mass (FM), fresh mass at full turgor (SM), measured after immersion of leaf petioles in demineralized water for 48 h in the dark at 4 °C, and dry mass (DM), measured after drying at 70 °C to a constant weight.
The index of sclerophylly, leaf mass per unit area (LMA=DM/LA) and density of foliar tissue (DM/FM) were calculated according to Groom and Lamont (1999). Several indices of leaf water status were also calculated: relative water content [RWC=(FM-DM)/(SM-DM)100], succulence [S=(FM-DM)/LA], water saturation deficit [WSD=(SM-FM)/(SM-DM)100] and water content at saturation [WCS=(SM-DM)/DM]. Cuticular transpiration rate (E) was estimated on the basis of leaf mass loss during dehydration.
2.3.4.	Stem water potential
Predawn (Tpd) and midday (Tmd) stem water potentials were measured on six sun-exposed shoots with a pressure chamber (PMS, Corvallis, OR) according to Scholander et al. (1965). We measured stem water potentials rather than leaf water potentials because several field studies (Garnier and Berger, 1985; McCutchan and Schackel, 1992; Naor and Wample, 1994; Naor, 1998) have shown that TMD is better correlated with soil water availability than midday leaf water potential. Care was taken to minimize water loss during the transfer of the shoot to the chamber by enclosing it in a plastic bag immediately after excision (Turner and Long, 1980).
2.3.5.	Statistics
Data were subjected to analysis of variance with prior data transformation when required. Proportional data expressed as percentages and ratio were arcsine square-rooted and log transformed, respectively. Mean separations were determined by Duncan's multiple range test (P &amp;lt;0.05).
2.4. Results and discussion
2.4.1.	Leaf anatomy study and tissue measurements
In leaf cross sections of all cultivars, the palisade parenchyma of the mesophyll comprised two parts, one being in contact with the upper epidermis and the other with the lower epidermis. The upper palisade parenchyma consisted of three compacted layers of elongated cells interspaced by tricosclereids. The lower palisade parenchyma consisted of one layer of relatively elongated cells. The presence of palisade parenchyma in contact with both the upper and lower epidermis is a common feature of olive leaves under drought conditions (Bosabalidis and Kofidis, 2002). Mesophyll compactness leads to low cellular conductance
thereby providing an efficient system to limit cellular water loss during drought (Bongi et al,
1987). The presence of this feature indicates that all cultivars are adapted to the high-light regimes of the region and are protected against water loss.
In leaves of all cultivars, a continuous rough wax layer and a few stellar trichomes covered the upper epidermis. The upper epidermis comprised one layer of irregularly shaped cells with heavy, thick outer walls and the lower epidermis comprised one layer of isodiametric cells with a continuous layer of overlapping, stellar trichomes hiding the small and abundant stomata.
Total lamina thickness differed significantly between cultivars (Table 2.1); it was thick in Manzanilla and Negrinha but thin in Arbequina and Cobrangosa. Differences in lamina thickness were attributable to differing proportions of mesophyll components in leaves.
Among cultivars, Negrinha had a thicker upper cuticle and thicker mesophyll tissue (palisade and spongy parenchyma). During the summer, cuticle thickening may enhance survival and growth in this cultivar by improving water relations.
In Manzanilla, besides the palisade and spongy parenchyma, the upper epidermis and lower epidermis were also thicker than in the other cultivars. The upper cuticle layer was less well developed, presumably because the epidermis already provided protection for the inner tissues.
Leaves of Cobrangosa were thin compared with leaves of other cultivars as a result of a thin spongy parenchyma (tissue with numerous veins, polymorphic sclereids with relatively wide lacunae). The palisade/spongy parenchyma ratio was high in this cultivar (1.06), suggesting a compact arrangement of cells and high mesophyll surface area per unit leaf area that could facilitate CO2 uptake and thus maintain photosynthesis under drought conditions (Chartzoulakis et al, 2000). On the other hand, high-density leaf tissue leads to a decrease in the fractional volume of intercellular spaces and tends to decrease the diffusion component of CO2 conductance (Chartzoulakis et al, 2000, Mediavilla et al, 2001). There is evidence, however, that this component of the total internal conductance is of minor importance in olive leaves (Syvertsen et al, 1995).
At the histological level, Cobrangosa was well protected against water loss as shown by the thick cuticle and the well-developed trichome layer covering the abaxial surface. Leaf pubescence is a common feature of xeric genotypes (Abrams, 1994; Karabourniotis and Bornman, 1999; Liakoura et al, 1999). It is thought to increase water-use efficiency by increasing leaf boundary-layer resistance (Palliotti et al, 1994; Save et al, 2000) and decreasing transpirational water losses (Fahn, 1986; Baldini et al, 1997). Trichomes may also
function as an effective filter, protecting the underlying tissues against ultraviolet-B radiation damage (Karabourniotis and Bornman, 1999). Trichomes may allow olive leaves to take advantage of light rain or condensation of water (Savé et al., 2000), thereby increasing the probability of water uptake by leaves (Grammatikopoulos and Manetas, 1994).
Arbequina is characterized by a thin lamina and a thin trichome layer that would not provide much protection against water loss. Furthermore, its leaf surface structure may facilitate water removal through transpiration, and its thin lower palisade layer may enhance water loss.
The lamina of Blanqueta was intermediate in thickness among the cultivars examined, but it had a thin upper cuticle, upper epidermis and upper palisade layers. These features may lead to high water loss from the adaxial surface. However, Blanqueta had a high proportion of lower palisade parenchyma and a dense trichome layer that may protect against water loss from the abaxial surface.
In olive leaves, the stomata are located on the abaxial side (hypostomatous), below the trichome layer, which prevents dehydration (Baldini et al, 1997). Leaves developed during drought usually have smaller and more numerous stomata than leaves that develop under well-watered conditions (Larcher, 1995). Although Negrinha had the highest stomatal density of the studied cultivars (Table 2.1), it probably avoids water stress by possessing flexible regulation (Bolhar-Nordenkampf, 1987).
2.4.2.	Morphology, sclerophylly and leaf water status
Leaf area was higher in Blanqueta and lower in Arbequina (Table 2.2), whereas values for Cobrangosa, Negrinha and Manzanilla were intermediate. Several studies (Abrams, 1994; Nevo et al, 2000; Pita and Pardos, 2001) have shown that genotypes from xeric areas generally have smaller leaves than genotypes from mesic areas. Because small leaf areas transpire less water than large leaf areas, the production of small leaves may help reduce water loss in Arbequina and balance the negative anatomical features observed in this cultivar. In contrast, the large leaves produced by Blanqueta may be susceptible to desiccation, especially because this feature was associated with high vegetative growth (data not shown).
Leaves developed during drought generally have a higher LMA than leaves produced under well-watered conditions. A high LMA is usually a consequence of an increase in density or thickness of foliar tissue and normally occurs when the costs of the assimilatory apparatus are increased (Centritto, 2002), such as during long periods of drought. In our study, LMA ranged from 183.9 g m-2 in Cobrangosa to 234.2 g m-2 in Blanqueta, indicating that leaves of all

Chapter 2. Sclerophylly and leaf anatomical traits of five Held-grown olive cultivars growing under drought conditions
cultivars developed under drought conditions. Among the cultivars, Cobrançosa had the lowest LMA, a consequence of low leaf thickness. On the other hand, Cobrançosa had the highest density of foliar tissue (i.e. a greater fraction of the foliar volume was occupied by dry matter). These results corroborate the anatomical study showing a thinner mesophyll for this cultivar and a compact arrangement of cells. The high density of foliar tissue in Cobrançosa is probably related to the thick cuticle layer and to the small volume of intercellular spaces and may also be associated with an increase in supporting tissue or cell wall thickness. It is possible that leaves with high tissue density are better able to survive a severe drought because of a higher resistance to physical damage by desiccation (Mediavilla etal., 2001).
The indices of leaf water status showed that, compared with the other cultivars, Arbequina had lower RWC and higher WSD and WCS, indicating higher water loss. Arbequina had the highest E (Table 2.2) (reaching 45% more than in Blanqueta) as a result of the thin cuticle layer (Table 2.1) or differences in cuticle structure and composition, or both.
After the stomata, the main site for water loss by transpiration is the cuticle. High cuticular permeability affects not only the non-stomatal transpiration pathway, but also water loss from guard cells and, therefore, guard cell water status and stomatal aperture. During the hot, dry Mediterranean summer, when stomata are tightly closed for most of the day (Lange,
1988), the contribution of cuticular transpiration to water loss may be important in Arbequina.
The RWC of Arbequina was about 77%, which is considered the turgor loss point for olive (Hinckley et al, 1980). Jorba et al (1985) found that a reduction in RWC from 96 to 65% induced an 85% reduction in photosynthesis of potted olive trees. Thus, the low RWC of Arbequina likely inhibits photosynthesis during the summer.
Abd-El-Rahman et al (1966) reported that olive leaf WCS was extremely low (1.59 g H2O g-1 dM) compared with fig and grape growing in the same environment (5.77 and 5.85 g H2O g-1 DM, respectively). We found that WCS values of Cobrançosa and Manzanilla were even lower (Table 2.2) than the value reported by Abd-El-Rahman et al (1966), suggesting that these cultivars have the capacity to withstand arid environments. Larcher (1960) suggested that a WSD of 8% is optimal for CO2 absorption and transpiration and 17% is the limit for stomatal closure. Blanqueta, Cobrançosa, Negrinha and Manzanilla had WSD values of around 8%, whereas Arbequina had a WSD near 12.5%, a value reported by Larcher (1960) as the point of highest maximum water-use efficiency. Based on these results, we conclude that Arbequina has adopted a desiccation-tolerance mechanism that facilitates the maintenance of high assimilatory rates during the onset of water deficit (Gulías et al, 2002). However, the leaves of this cultivar
were sensitive to progressive desiccation during the summer, and survival may be threatened, especially during hot dry summers.
Water storage mechanisms are important for desiccation avoidance, especially when they are coupled with surface reduction and high transpiration resistance of the epidermis (Larcher, 1995). A special form of water conservation is the binding of water to mucilage in cells and ducts and intercellular cavities (Margaris, 1981). Water reserves of this kind can protect the plant from sudden wilting and severe leaf shrinkage. Blanqueta, Negrinha and Manzanilla seemed to use this kind of protection, showing a higher succulence index (Table
2.2). The close relationship between succulence and leaf thickness, also reported by Bussoti et al. (2002), arises because thicker leaves contain a greater volume of water per surface unit.
2.4.3.	Stem water potential
Although data based on water content are informative in assessing the reserves available in the event of drought, the most suitable measures of specific desiccation tolerance of plants are osmolarity and water potential of cells or tissue. The trends of water potential are illustrated in Figure 2.2.
Among cultivars, Arbequina and Blanqueta had the lowest Tpd values, which may be indicative of incomplete overnight rehydration, probably associated with a poor water transport system. The xeromorphic nature of olive roots has been observed in anatomical studies (Fernández et al, 1994) and by hydraulic functioning (Moreno et al, 1996).
Based on the daily pattern of stem water potential, differences between TPD and TMD were significant in all cultivars. Arbequina presented the lowest Tmd (-2.68 MPa), suggesting that this cultivar is anatomically or physiologically less protected against water loss. This result, combined with the low RWC data, supports the hypothesis that Arbequina has a desiccationtolerance mechanism. In addition, Arbequina showed large changes in water potential for a given change in leaf RWC, indicating that its leaves may have a high bulk elastic modulus (Niinemets, 2001). If so, Arbequina leaves may have low cell wall elasticity, frequently cited as a mechanism enabling drought-stressed plants to maintain cell volume and avoid deleterious reductions in RWC (Tyree and Jarvis, 1982). In contrast, the other cultivars, especially Blanqueta, avoided critical water deficits by stomatal regulation, and by reducing leaf transpiration and the differences between TPD and TMD.
2.5.	Conclusions
The five olive tree cultivars possessed different leaf-level mechanisms to cope with summer stress. Among the Spanish cultivars, only Manzanilla seemed to be well protected at the anatomical level against water loss during the summer. Manzanilla and Negrinha enhanced their sclerophylly at the leaf level by building parenchymatous tissues, thereby increasing the protection provided by the upper cuticle (Negrinha) and upper and lower epidermis (Manzanilla). The leaves of these two cultivars also had a higher succulence index than the other cultivars, which affords protection against sudden wilting and severe shrinkage. Cobrangosa is well adapted to drought conditions as a result of the high density (high palisade/spongy parenchyma ratio) of the foliar tissue and the presence of thick cuticle and trichome layers.
Arbequina leaves are anatomically less well protected against water loss because of a thinner trichome layer than some of the other cultivars. Because Arbequina leaves are susceptible to progressive desiccation, survival may be threatened, especially during hot dry summers. However, the development of small leaves may reduce water loss at the whole-plant level. Compared with some of the other cultivars, Blanqueta had larger leaves and some anatomical traits including a thinner upper cuticle, upper epidermis and upper palisade layers that may lead to high water loss, especially from the adaxial surface.

3.	PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL RESPONSES OF FIVE Olea europaea L. CULTIVARS TO WATER STRESS IN THE FIELD
3.1.	Abstract
Gas exchange rates, chlorophyll a fluorescence, photosynthetic pigments, plant water relations, total soluble sugars, starch, soluble proteins and proline concentrations were investigated in five Olea europaea L. cultivars (Arbequina, Blanqueta, Cobrangosa, Manzanilla and Negrinha) grown under Mediterranean field conditions. Cobrangosa, Manzanilla and Negrinha had higher photosynthetic rates (A) than Arbequina and Blanqueta. The first group, with high stomatal conductance (gs), high ratio of intercellular to atmospheric CO2 concentration and low intrinsic water use efficiency (A/g), use a prodigal water use strategy and reveals to be better acclimated to the region, whereas Blanqueta and Arbequina, with high A/g, employ a conservative water use strategy. Diurnal trends of A followed a typical pattern, with a maximum in the morning and declining at midday. However, the degree of midday depression in photosynthesis was genotype dependent, with a maximum in Arbequina and a minimum in Negrinha. Reductions in A resulted from both stomatal and non-stomatal limitations. Stomatal closure could not prevent lower stem water potentials at midday in Arbequina. However, this cultivar has high concentration of soluble proteins on leaves, suggesting that have developed some mechanisms of drought tolerance. Chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements showed a down-regulation of photochemical efficiency of photosystem II around midday, revealing the occurrence of a dynamic photoinhibition. In all cultivars, but mainly in Manzanilla, free proline was accumulated in the foliage. However, olive trees have other mechanisms of drought resistance in addition to the solely proline accumulation, such as stomatal closure and soluble protein accumulation.
Key words: chlorophyll a fluorescence, gas exchange, proline, soluble proteins, water use strategy.
3.2.	Introduction
Soil and atmospheric water deficits are the most important limiting factors for photosynthesis, growth and survival of plants growing in semiarid climates, such as the Mediterranean. In the field, high irradiance and high temperature also contribute to the reduction in leaf net carbon uptake (Faria et al, 1996). Stomatal control of water losses has
been identified as an early event in plant responses to water deficit under field conditions, leading to a limitation of carbon uptake by the leaves (Abd-El-Rahman et al., 1966; Chaves, 1991; Cornic and Massacci, 1996). When carbon assimilation is limited by the decrease in stomatal conductance during the warmest period of the day chloroplasts may be subjected to an excess of energy resulting in the down-regulation of photosynthesis or in photoinhibition (Demmig-Adams and Adams, 1996).
The olive tree (Olea europaea L.) has a reputation of being drought tolerant from very early reports (Spiegel, 1955) but few studies have been conducted in the field that quantified its responses to water deficits. Among such responses, gas exchange is of particular importance in determining the efficiency of water use in response to the limited resources. Knowledge on gas exchange of olive leaves is limited and most studies have been conducted on young trees growing in pots (Bongi et al, 1987; Chartzoulakis et al, 1999). In potted olive trees, Angelopoulos et al (1996) observed that leaf conductance was limiting photosynthesis in trees subjected to mild and moderate water stress, whereas non-stomatal factors influenced photosynthesis only under severe stress conditions. Angelopoulos and co-workers (1996) also observed that the diurnal course of photosynthesis and leaf conductance in potted trees exposed to the natural environment exhibited a maximum value in the morning, declined towards midday and was more or less constant throughout the afternoon, describing a pattern that is common in Mediterranean woody vegetation (Tenhunen et al, 1990; Fernández and Moreno, 1999; Chaves etal, 2002; Ogaya and Peñuelas, 2003).
In order to preserve photosynthesis, the olive tree, like some plants grown in arid and semi-arid environments, have evolved physiological processes to maintain to some extent tissue turgor and thus stomatal opening (Dichio et al, 1997; Chartzoulakis et al, 1999). Lowering of osmotic potential due to net accumulation of compatible solutes in the cytoplasm such as proline, glycine betaine, organic acids and sugars as mannitol and sucrose, is a well established ecophysiological mechanism whereby many plants adjust to low soil water availability (Morgan, 1984; Ingram and Bartels, 1996; Hare et al, 1998).
Olive has traditionally been grown in Trás-os-Montes (northeast Portugal) were it is of considerable economical and social importance. Cultivars most frequently grown in the region are considered to be well adapted to drought. In a previous study (Bacelar et al, 2004) two cultivars originated in Trás-os-Montes reveal to possess different morpho-anatomical leaf-level mechanisms to cope with summer stress. Nevertheless, there are no studies documenting the drought adaptations of these cultivars at the physiological and biochemical level. The aims of this study were to: (1) compare diurnal gas exchange rates and chlorophyll fluorescence
measurements of the cultivars most commonly grown in the region with foreign cultivars; (2) evaluate limitations to photosynthesis imposed by drought conditions; (3) study the existence of drought tolerance mechanisms associated with soluble sugars, soluble proteins and proline accumulation in the foliage; and (4) to examine intraspecific variation of those features in O. europaea.
3.3.	Materials and methods
3.3.1.	Study site
The experiment was conducted in a shallow schistic soil at Mirandela in northeast Portugal, (41O31' N and 7O12' W) at 250 m above sea level, during 2001 and 2002. The site has a Mediterranean climate with hot dry summers. Mean annual rainfall is 520 mm and minimal rainfall is usually recorded during the summer months, although some periods of drought can occur during winter. The warmer months are July/August and the coldest are December/January, with average daily temperatures of 23.6/22.9 °C and 6.3/6.1 °C, respectively.
3.3.2.	Plant material
We studied five cultivars of field-grown, unirrigated, 10-year-old, own-rooted olive trees. Cobrangosa and Negrinha are native to Trás-os-Montes (Northeast Portugal), Arbequina is the major cultivar in Cataluña (Northeast Spain), Blanqueta is of great importance in Valencia and Alicante (Southeast Spain), and Manzanilla in Extremadura (Centre Spain). Arbequina and Blanqueta are from regions with a Mediterranean climate, tempered by a maritime influence, and Manzanilla comes from the central interior of the Iberian Peninsula, with a climate similar to Trás-os-Montes.
3.3.3.	Gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence
Leaf gas exchange rates were measured at natural incident photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) in the field using a portable IRGA (ADC-LCA-3, Analytical Development, Hoddesdon, U.K.), operating in the open mode. Since diurnal patterns of gas exchange rates were similar in both years, only the data obtained on a typical day of late July 2001 (severe drought period, minimum photosynthesis) are presented. Measurements were performed on
eight well exposed current year leaves (fully expanded, of the same stage of development), during the morning (08.30-09.30 h), midday (13.30-14.30 h) and afternoon (17.30-18.30 h). PPFD was always higher than 1000-1200 pmol m-2 s-1 (mean values of 1626, 1791 and 1424 m-2 s-1 at morning, midday and afternoon, respectively), which is known to be over the saturation point in olive (Natali et al., 1991). The vapour pressure deficit (VPD) was 3.84, 5.48 and 4.84 kPa at morning, midday and afternoon, respectively. Net CO2 assimilation rate (A), stomatal conductance (g), transpiration rate (E) and the ratio of intercellular to atmospheric CO2 concentration (C/C) were estimated from gas exchange measurements using the equations developed by von Caemmerer and Farquhar (1981). Intrinsic water use efficiency was calculated as the ratio of A/gs. Values for liquid phase diffusive conductance to CO2 (gm) were calculated in accordance with Izuta etal (1996).
In vivo chlorophyll a fluorescence was measured with a portable chlorophyll fluorometer (Plant Stress Meter, BioMonitor SCI AB, Ume§, Sweden) at predawn and midday on eight attached intact leaves similar to those used for gas exchange measurements. Prior to the measurements, a small part of the leaves was kept in the dark for 30 min using cuvettes for dark adaptation. A 5-s light pulse at 400 pmol m-2 s-1 was used. We evaluate the minimal fluorescence (F0), which occurs when all PSII reaction centres are open, and maximal fluorescence (Fm), which occurs when all PSII reaction centres are closed (Ball et al, 1994). The difference between F0 and Fm is variable fluorescence, Fv. Maximum quantum yield of PSII was estimated by the F/Fm ratio (Krause and Weis, 1991).

Stem water potential measurements were used to evaluate tree water status. Predawn (Tpd) and midday (Tmd) stem water potentials were measured on eight sun-exposed shoots using a pressure chamber (PMS, Corvallis, U.S.A.), according to Scholander et al. (1965). Care was taken to minimise water loss during the transfer of the shoot to the chamber by enclosing it in a plastic bag immediately after excision (Turner and Long, 1980).
3.3.5.	Photosynthetic pigments and metabolites assays
All metabolic compound analyses were made with leaf discs taken at morning (10.00 h) from 6 fully expanded leaves of comparable physiological age, thereby eliminating developmental effects. Leaf sections of a known area were ground in 80% acetone for chlorophyll and carotenoid determination. Total chlorophyll (Chla+b) and Chla/Chlb ratio was
determined according to Sestak et al (1971) and total carotenoids (Car) according to Lichtenthaler (1987).
Total soluble sugars (SS) were extracted by heating leaf discs in 80% ethanol, according to Irigoyen et al, (1992). SS were analysed by the reaction of 200 gl of the alcoholic extract with 3 ml of fresh anthrone and placed in a boiling water bath for 10 min. After cooling, the absorbance at 625 nm was determined. After the extraction of the soluble fractions, the solid fraction was used for starch analysis. Starch (St) was extracted with 30% perchloric acid, according to Osaki et al (1991). The starch concentration was determined by the anthrone method as described above. Glucose was used as a standard for both soluble sugars and starch.
The amount of soluble proteins (SP) was quantified using the method of Bradford (1976). Leaf discs were homogeneized in a grinding medium that contained 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), 0.1 mM EDTA, 100 gM PMSF and 2% PVP (w/v). Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard.
Proline was determined following the ninhydrin method as described by Bates et al. (1973). Briefly, fresh leaf tissue was extracted in 6 ml of 3% sulfosalicylic acid. After centrifugation at 5000 g for 20 min, 4 ml of the supernatant was added to 2 ml of a mixture of glacial acetic acid and ninhydrin reagent in a 1:1 (v:v) ratio. The reaction mixture was incubated in a water bath at 100 °C for 1 h and then portioned against 3 ml of toluene. Absorbance was read in the organic phase at 520 nm. A standard curve was performed with proline. All reagents and chemicals used were of the highest grade of purity commercially available.
3.3.6.	Statistics
All data were subjected to an analysis of variance with prior data transformation when required. Proportional data expressed as ratio data were log transformed. Significant different means were separated using the Fisher's LSD test (P &amp;lt;0.05).
3.4.	Results
3.4.1.	Gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence
Photosynthetic rate was affected by time of day and cultivar. Figure 3.1A depicts the diurnal changes of A in the five olive cultivars. The values of A followed a pattern characteristic
of woody Mediterranean vegetation, with a maximum in the morning that declines towards midday, in a closely association with increased evaporative demand and soil water deficits. In the morning, A was lowest in Blanqueta. Later on, at midday, Blanqueta and Arbequina had the lowest A, whereas Negrinha had the highest A. No recovery of A towards the afternoon was observed. On the contrary, Negrinha and Blanqueta had a tendency to drop A. Negrinha decreased A mainly due to increased stomatal resistance (Figure 3.1B), while in Blanqueta the decrease was more related to decreased mesophyll conductance (Figure 3.1C). The gs values followed a diurnal pattern very similar to those of A (Figure 3.1B). Nevertheless, gs was relatively more affected during the day than A, which means that the A/gs increased from the morning towards the afternoon in all cultivars. In any case, it was evident that Blanqueta had the lowest variation in A/gs (28%). Among the cultivars, Arbequina and Blanqueta had high A/gs, whereas the group of cultivars including Cobrançosa, Manzanilla and Negrinha had low A/gs values (Figure 3.1F). In general, the C/C decreased along the day (Figure 3.1E). However, we observed a much greater reduction in gs compared with C/C, from morning to midday. Moreover, Blanqueta had an almost constant C/Ca from midday to afternoon (Figure 3.1E), despite the reduction of gs (Figure 3.1B).
The variation of E throughout the day (Figure 3.1D) was related to gs and mainly by VPD values. In all the cultivars, except in Arbequina, E increased at midday relatively to the morning period as a result of higher VPD, despite the lowest gs. Arbequina had an opposite trend, in a more closely association with decreased gs. Meanwhile, E decreased from midday towards the afternoon, due to increased stomatal resistance and/or decreased atmospheric evaporative demand.
Daily recordings of chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters (Table 3.1) showed that F/Fm decreased from predawn to midday in all cultivars, being paralleled by decreases of Fm. A tendency to decreased F0 was also observed, except in Manzanilla (Table 3.1). Across cultivars, Cobrançosa had the lowest F0 and Fm. The Fv/Fm values were not significantly different among the cultivars in both periods.

3.4.2.	Plant water relations
Stem water potential at predawn and midday indicate that olive trees were mildly water-stressed (Figure 3.2). Arbequina and Blanqueta had significantly lower TPD than the other cultivars. Stem water potential decreased gradually during the morning reaching a minimum of -2.80 MPa at midday in Arbequina. Differences between TPD and TMD were higher in Cobrangosa, Manzanilla and Negrinha (above 200%) and lower in Blanqueta (115%).

3.4.3.	Photosynthetic pigments and metabolites in leaves
Significant differences in Chla+b and Car concentrations and in Chla/Chlb ratio were observed among the olive cultivars (Table 3.2). Higher values of Chla+b and Car were observed in the leaves of Blanqueta, Cobrangosa and Manzanilla, but no differences were detected in Chla+b/Car ratio. Arbequina and Cobrangosa had higher Chla/Chlb ratio and Blanqueta the lowest.
There were also significant differences in SS, St, SP and proline concentrations among cultivars (Table 3.2). Negrinha had the lowest SS concentration (26% less than Manzanilla), whereas the St concentration was significantly higher in Cobrangosa. This cultivar had 230% more St than Arbequina. Nevertheless, Arbequina leaves were richest in SP. Among the cultivars, Manzanilla had the highest proline concentration, whereas Blanqueta and Negrinha had low proline levels.

3.5.	Discussion
The diurnal trends of A in the field-grown olive cultivars (Figure 3.1A) followed a typical pattern described for woody Mediterranean vegetation (Tenhunen et al., 1990; Fernández and Moreno, 1999; Chaves et al, 2002; Ogaya and Peñuelas, 2003), with a maximum in the morning and declining at midday. However, we observed that the degree of the midday depression in photosynthesis was genotype dependent, with a maximum in Arbequina and a minimum in Negrinha. The midday depression in photosynthesis is a common phenomenon in higher plants and is the result of a complex effect of many interacting internal and external factors (Xu and Shen, 1996). The causes for this depression are still not fully understood and seem to involve mechanisms at both stomatal (Downton et al, 1988) and chloroplastic level (Correia et al, 1990). Our results suggest that the reductions in A in drought-stressed olive plants were dependent from both stomatal and non-stomatal limitations. Stomata closed partly in response to high air temperatures and water vapour pressure deficits, but these factors did not fully explain the closing response, as was observed previously by Faria et al (1996) in Quercus súber. It is possible that an increased xylem sap ABA concentration (Davies et al, 2000; Liu et al, 2001) and circadian rhythms (Snaith and Mansfield, 1986; Correia et al, 1995) may also be involved.
The much greater reduction in gs compared with C/C, from morning to midday (Figure 3.1B, E), indicates that non-stomatal factors may play an important role in limiting photosynthesis when olive cultivars are submitted to prolonged drought under field conditions. This was more evident in Blanqueta that had an almost constant Ci/Ca, from midday to afternoon (Figure 3.1E), despite the reduction of gs (Figure 3.1B). Similar results were obtained by Giorio et al (1999) in a study with field-grown olive trees under water deficit conditions. Possibilities include a higher mesophyll resistance (Figure 3.1C), a reduced Rubisco content,
activity and/or specificity factor, and/or higher respiration rates. We consider that further studies are needed to elucidate the role of each of these possible limitations to olive photosynthesis.
Photochemical factors could also be responsible for midday depression of A in olive cultivars. In fact, a decline in photochemical efficiency of PSII, given by Fv/Fm in dark-adapted leaves (Table 3.1), was parallel to midday depression of A in all cultivars. Since no alterations occurred in predawn values of Fv/Fm, the diurnal decrease of Fv/Fm revealed the occurrence of a dynamic photoinhibition, which seemed to be effective in protecting the photochemical apparatus from the high risk of photodamage (Sobrado, 1999; Souza et al., 2004). Thus, the excessive excitation energy is deflected away from PSII and dissipated harmlessly, primarily as heat (Osmond, 1994; Luttge et al., 2003). Such down-regulation may be the response to excessive radiation and resulted from reversible declines in both F0 and Fm (Table 3.1). Downregulation of photochemical efficiency around midday has been shown in O. europaea trees under field conditions (Faria et al., 1998). Among cultivars, Cobrangosa had the lowest F0 and Fm, namely at midday, indicating a highest absorption efficiency of photons by chlorophyll a in the light-harvesting complex and of the reaction centre of PSII (Giorgieva and Yordanov, 1993) and a higher non-radiative energy dissipation (Oberhuber and Bauer, 1991).
Our study didn't show any association between Chla+b concentration and photosynthetic activity/quantum yield in olive cultivars. This was an expected result, since for C3 species the relationship between quantum yield and chlorophyll is relevant only when Chla+b concentration is bellow 4 mg dm-2 (Bjorkman 1981). Apparently, the lower Chla+b concentration of Arbequina and Negrinha (Table 3.2) was a good way to avoid excessive absorption of light energy, but it occurred in the absence of reduction in chlorophyll fluorescence yield (Table 3.1). As a consequence, there was a continued efficient use of light captured by chlorophyll in those cultivars. Furthermore, Blanqueta had the lowest Chla/Chlb ratio (Table 3.2), which reflects the relative increase in the light harvesting chlorophyll a/b proteins at the expense of the chlorophyll a containing reaction centre complexes (Evans, 1993). In addition, the low Chla/Chlb ratio of Blanqueta is probably associated with a decline in cytocrome f content (Watanabe et al., 1994), which causes the reduction in electron transport capacity, and may also help to explain the low A of Blanqueta.
In general, gs was relatively more affected than A (Figure 3.1A, B), which means that A/gs increased from the morning towards the afternoon in all cultivars (Figure 3.1F). Nevertheless, olive cultivars have different water-use behaviours. Passioura (1982) pointed out that two types of water-use behaviour may be employed in woody plants. The prodigal water
use behaviour is beneficial in conditions where water supply is interrupted for short periods only. In this situation there is little danger of serious desiccation despite rapid water-use, and it enables a plant to grow quickly. The conservative water-use behaviour is beneficial in conditions where a long dry period prevails, enabling the plant to use the available water efficiently. According to this theory of plant water-use behaviour, the group of cultivars including Cobrangosa, Manzanilla and Negrinha, with high gs, high C/Ca and low A/gs that is positively related with A, employ a prodigal or non-conservative strategy, whereas Blanqueta and Arbequina, with high A/gs, employ a conservative strategy in the use of water. Nevertheless, our data showed that the reductions in gs for Arbequina could not prevent lower Tmd values (Figure 3.2). Moreover, we found evidence for the feed-forward hypothesis for stomatal closure in Arbequina in response to air drought as proposed by Farquhar (1978), because there was evidence of decreasing E at high VPD (i.e. at midday), whereas the relationship between E and VPD of the other cultivars well abided by feedback effect (Monteith,
1995).
In our experiment, we observed the accumulation of SS and proline in the foliage (Table
3.2), probably for further osmotic adjustment. Some studies have already dealt with a decrease in osmotic potential in olive cultivars as a result of water deficit in the leaf tissue (Dichio et al., 1997; Chartzoulakis et al, 1999; Bacelar et al, 2006). However, osmotic adjustment was probably accomplished mainly by accumulation of a wide range of other metabolites and inorganic ions. In fact, the compounds involved in osmotic adjustment differ widely among plant species (Patakas et al, 2002). Gucci et al. (1997) reported that osmotic adjustment in olive leaves under salt stress was accomplished primarily by accumulation of inorganic ions, despite the osmotic contribution of soluble carbohydrates.
Although it's highest A, Negrinha had the lowest SS concentration (26% less than Manzanilla). As highlighted by Chaves (1991), it is difficult to establishing a clear relationship between the sugar content of the leaves and the photosynthetic activity, which may be partly explained by the complex compartmentation of sugars in the leaf. On the other hand, the St concentration was significantly lower in Arbequina (Table 3.2), probably related with a high export rate of photosynthates to sink organs and/or lower A imposed by drought (Souza et al,
2004).
We observed that in all cultivars, but mainly in Manzanilla, free proline accumulates in the foliage for further osmotic adjustment (Table 3.2). Sofo et al (2004) previously reported that in olive trees the proline content increases in relation to the severity of stress, particularly in leaves and medium roots. Very little is known about the linkages between drought stress and
proline accumulation. Proline within the cell can act as an osmolyte with compatibility for enzymes and other cell macromolecules, therefore protecting them from drought-stress induced damage (Hare et al, 1998). Osmotic adjustment produced by proline accumulation causes a drop of the osmotic potential in plant tissues (Hare and Cress, 1997). Lower osmotic potentials allow leaves to withstand a greater evaporative demand without loss of turgor. Moreover, proline has a protective action which prevents membrane damage and protein denaturation during severe drought stress (Hare et al., 1998; Ain-Lhout et al, 2001). It has also been proposed that proline can act as an electron acceptor, avoiding damage of photosystems due to their photoinibition by activated oxygen species (Hare et al, 1998). Accumulation of proline, which is a common metabolic response to water deficit, salinity and cold stress in many higher plants (Delauney and Verma, 1993), may also facilitate the continued synthesis of nitrogenous compatible solutes using excess photochemical energy available when stomata are closed (Smirnoff et al, 1985). This process seems to be species related. In fact, proline accumulation in two Mediterranean shrubs (Halimium halimifolium L. and Pistacia lentiscus L.) during increasing water deficit was twice the amount found in olive tree (Ain-Lhout et al, 2001). Despite its known role in osmotic adjustment, proline has been considered, in some studies, a symptom of injury (Irigoyen et al, 1992), probably resulting from an excessive protein breakdown during water deficits (Levitt, 1980).
We observed that olive cultivars have other mechanisms of drought resistance such as stomatal closure and possess morpho-anatomical traits that help to minimize water loss (Bacelar et al, 2004). In particular, Manzanilla and Negrinha enhanced their sclerophylly at the leaf level by building parenchymatous tissues, thereby increasing the protection provided by the upper cuticle (Negrinha) and lower epidermis (Manzanilla) and Cobran^osa is well adapted to drought conditions as a result of the high density (high palisade/spongy ratio) of the foliar tissue and the presence of thick cuticle and trichome layers (Bacelar et al., 2004). In arid environments, the trichome layer, which covers the abaxial surface of olive leaves, also enhance reflectance in the thermal wavebands, regulating leaf energy balance (Baldini et al., 1997). Arbequina leaves are anatomically less well protected against water loss because of a thinner trichome layer and Blanqueta had larger leaves and a thinner upper cuticle, upper epidermis and upper palisade layers that may lead to high water loss, especially from the adaxial surface (Bacelar et al, 2004). Despite anatomically protected against water loss, Arbequina leaves exhibited higher levels of SP (Table 3.2). Changes of SP contents are important to understand the impact of stress on cell proteolysis and protein synthesis (Santos and Caldeira 1999). During drought periods, plants undergo many physiological changes and induce a large number of
genes for adaptation (Ingram and Bartels, 1996). Under water-deficit conditions, a typical change in gene expression is the induction of genes involved in the synthesis of various osmolytes and low-molecular-weight proteins, e.g. dehydrins and late embryogenic-abundant proteins (Ingram and Bartels, 1996). Moreover, the higher SP concentration in Arbequina may represent increased activity of oxidative stress defence enzymes. In fact, under mild water deficit, an increase in activities of superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase and catalase has been reported (Baisak et al., 1994). The accumulation of leaf proteins under water deficit may also represent a reserve for post-stress recovery and with probable implications in stress tolerance (Millard, 1988).
In conclusion, Cobrangosa, Manzanilla and Negrinha seem to be well acclimated to the region, with high A along the day, using a prodigal water use strategy, whereas Blanqueta and Arbequina employ a conservative water use strategy. The discussed aspects of drought stress metabolism may have an adaptative meaning, supporting the hypothesis that olive cultivars native to dry regions, such as Cobrangosa, Negrinha, and the Spanish Manzanilla, have more capability to acclimate to drought conditions than cultivars originated in regions with a more temperate climate, like Arbequina and Blanqueta. Such ecophysiological comparison may prove useful for the choice of olive cultivars to plant in new orchards, aiming to use water resources in a sustainable way.

4.	CHANGES IN GROWTH, GAS EXCHANGE, XYLEM HYDRAULIC PROPERTIES AND WATER USE EFFICIENCY OF THREE OLIVE CULTIVARS UNDER CONTRASTING WATER AVAILABILITY REGIMES
4.1.	Abstract
Differences in vegetative growth, gas exchange, xylem hydraulic properties and water use efficiency of biomass production were investigated on young plants of three Olea europaea
L.	cultivars (Cobrangosa, Madural and Verdeal Transmontana), submitted to contrasting water availability regimes. Low water availability (LW) affected growth and biomass accumulation of the three cultivars. However, Cobrangosa plants were the less affected. Under LW conditions, total leaf area was sharply reduced due to a combination of leaf growth reduction and shedding of older leaves, minimising water losses by transpiration. Water stress also caused a marked decline on photosynthetic capacity and stomatal control was the major factor affecting photosynthesis. Under LW, water use efficiency of biomass production was improved in Cobrangosa, whereas it decreased considerably in Madural and Verdeal Transmontana. In all cultivars, water stress induced an increase in xylem vessel frequency, providing a greater vascular potential and a greater security of xylem sap conduction under drought conditions. From the behaviour of Cobrangosa plants, with a lower allocation of assimilates to leaves, smaller leaves, a smaller reduction in net assimilation rate and photosynthetic rate, a more efficient water transport through the xylem, and a more enhanced water use efficiency of biomass production under LW, we consider this cultivar very promising for cultivation in semi-arid areas.
Key words: gas exchange, growth, water use efficiency, water stress, xylem anatomy.
4.2.	Introduction
Water availability is an important factor affecting photosynthesis, growth and survival of plants, mainly in arid and semi-arid regions, such as the Mediterranean. In general, strategies of drought-avoidance or drought-tolerance can be recognized, both involving diverse plant mechanisms that provide the plants the ability to respond and survive drought (Levitt, 1980).
Stomatal control of water losses has been identified as an early event in plant response to water deficit (Chaves, 1991; Cornic and Massacci, 1996). As drought progresses, stomatal
closure occurs for longer periods of the day, reducing daily carbon assimilation and water loss at the time of highest evaporative demand, leading to a near optimization of carbon assimilation in relation to water supply (Cowan, 1982; Jones, 1992).
A common response of plants to water deficit is a reduction in the conductivity to water flow along the soil-plant-atmosphere pathway. Stomatal control and root conductivity are traditionally considered as the main controlling factors of water flow in plants (Jones, 1992). However, water transport system can also significantly affect water movement by imposing conductivity constrains (Tyree and Ewers, 1991). It has been reported that water stress affects shoot conductivity by inducing embolism in xylem vessels (Schultz and Matthews, 1988; Tyree and Sperry, 1989; Tognetti et al, 1996) or by a reduction in the vessel diameter (Lovisolo and Schubert, 1998).
At the whole plant level, water deficit has repercussions on plant phenology, growth, carbon assimilation, assimilate partitioning and plant reproduction processes. Some of the earliest structural responses to stress appear to be mediated by biophysical events resulting from dehydration (Taiz and Zeiger, 1998). As the water content of the plant decreases, the cells shrink and the cell walls relax, resulting in turgor maintenance. Since leaf expansion depends mostly of cell expansion, the inhibition of cell expansion results in a limitation of leaf area during water deficit. On the other hand, water stress limits not only the size of individual leaves, but also their number. If plants became water-stressed after a substantial leaf area has developed, leaves will senesce and eventually fall off (Taiz and Zeiger, 1998).
Another early response to water deficit is the cessation of shoot growth (Pereira and Chaves, 1995), often followed by prompt resumption of growth when available water is restored in the soil. Water deficit also affects the development of the root system. Water stress induces a change in carbon partitioning used for root formation in olive water-stressed plants, thereby reducing the carbon available for photosynthetic end-product formation and canopy growth (Bongi and Palliotti, 1994). This different pattern of dry matter distribution allows the water-stressed plants to maximise the efficiency of assimilates in water deficit conditions. Changes in root-shoot ratio or the temporary accumulation of reserves in the stem are usually accompanied by alterations in nitrogen and carbon metabolism whose fine regulation is still largely unknown (Pinheiro etal, 2001).
The study of water use efficiency of biomass production (WUE), defined as the ratio of dry matter production to water use, is particularly interesting in situations where growth is affected as a result of limiting water availability (Anyia and Herzog, 2004). The increase of WUE under water stress is attributed to biomass production being reduced less by drought than
water use (Anyia and Herzog, 2004). Thus, genotypes that are characterised by high values of WUE appear to be the most promising for production on relatively dry sites.
Olive tree (Olea europaea L.) is well known to be very resistant to drought (Bongi and Palliotti, 1994; Fernández and Moreno, 1999; Giorio et al, 1999; Tognetti et al, 2004; Connor, 2005; Bacelar et al, 2006). There are many mechanisms by which it resists to more or less extended drought periods (Chartzoulakis et al, 1999; Giorio et al, 1999; Bacelar et al, 2004), but some differences among olive cultivars have been observed concerning their ability for adaptation and production under drought conditions (Chartzoulakis et al, 1999; Bosabalidis and Kofidis, 2002; Bacelar et al, 2004). Our working hypothesis was that differences exist in drought resistance mechanisms among Portuguese Olea europaea L. cultivars. To clarify the response of olive trees to drought in order to find the cultivars that are able to resist better to this abiotic stress, we accomplished an experiment where young plants of three olive cultivars (Cobrangosa, Madural and Verdeal Transmontana) were submitted to two contrasting water availability regimes. After an induced drought period, differences in growth, biomass allocation, xylem anatomy, gas exchange rates and water use efficiency of biomass production were evaluated in plants under water stress and in well-watered plants.
4.3.	Materials and methods
4.3.1.	Plant material and growth conditions
The experiment was conducted at the University of Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro, Vila Real, Portugal (41° 19'N and 7° 44'W; 450 m elevation). The study was carried out with tree Portuguese olive cultivars (Olea europaea L. cv. Cobrangosa, Madural and Verdeal Transmontana), widely cultivated in Trás-os-Montes (northeast Portugal). One-year-old, own-rooted plants were grown in a glasshouse situated at the University campus in 10 dm3 pots (one plant per pot) filled with a mixture of soil and peat (2:1, v/v). Pots were randomly arranged and periodically rotated to minimize the effects of environmental heterogeneity. During early May 2002, forty uniform plants (based on height, leaf number and total leaf area) of each cultivar were selected for study. The experiment comprised six treatments of 3 cultivars x 2 watering regimes in a factorial design. Sixteen pots of each cultivar were watered three times a week (between 27 May and 16 September 2002) to field capacity O 400 ml; control, well-watered plants - WW). Another sixteen pots received once per week only one-third of the water needed to maintain the soil at field capacity, in order to simulate a moderate plant water stress (plants under low water availability - LW). The amount of water added during each
watering, combined with the size of containers, resulted in negligible leaching through the bottoms of the containers. The pots were covered with plastic film and aluminium foil in order to avoid evaporation from the soil surface and to minimize temperature increases inside the containers.
4.3.2.	Biomass production and growth
Prior to beginning the treatments, eight randomly chosen plants of each cultivar were harvested to assess initial biomass, height, leaf number and total leaf area. At the end of the experiment, eight plants per treatment of each cultivar were harvested and the following parameters were measured: leaf area (LICOR 3100, Lincoln, NE, USA), number of total green leaves, shoot height and dry weight of aboveground and belowground organs (after drying in a force-draft oven at 70°C to a constant weight). Based on the data of leaf area and/or dry weight, the relative growth rate (RGR; rate of biomass gain per biomass), net assimilation rate (NAR; rate of biomass gain per leaf area), leaf area ratio (LAR; leaf area per total plant biomass) and specific leaf area (SLA; leaf area per leaf biomass) were calculated using the equations shown in Hunt (1978). Root, shoot, stem and leaf weight ratio and root per shoot biomass ratio (R:S) were also calculated.
4.3.3.	Water use efficiency of biomass production
Water use efficiency of biomass production (WUE) was determined for each plant by dividing total dry matter production by cumulative amount of water used throughout the growing season. Total dry matter included the oven-dried leaves, stems and roots.
4.3.4.	Gas exchange and water potential
Leaf gas exchange measurements were performed at midday on a summer cloudless day in five plants per treatment transferred outdoors under natural irradiance and prevalent environmental conditions. These measurements were made at midday because the water limitation treatment effects in olive plants are greatest at this time than in the morning (Moriana et al, 2002). Atmospheric conditions consisted of photosynthetic photon flux density of 1916 ± 14 pmol m-2 s-1 and air temperature of 34.3 ± 1.2°C. Measurements were performed on two well exposed and fully expanded leaves of each plant using a portable IRGA (LCA-3, Analytical Development Co., Hoddesdon, England), operating in the open mode. Net CO2 assimilation rate (A), stomatal conductance (gs), transpiration rate (E) and intercellular CO2
concentration (C) were estimated from gas exchange measurements using the equations developed by von Caemmerer and Farquhar (1981). Intrinsic water use efficiency was calculated as the ratio of Ag.
Leaf water potential measurements were used to evaluate plant water status. Midday leaf water potential (Tmd) was measured on the same leaves used for gas exchange measurements using a pressure chamber (PMS, Oregon, Corvallis, USA), as described by Scholander et al (1965). Care was taken to minimise water loss during the transfer of the leaf to the chamber by enclosing it in a black plastic bag immediately after excision (Turner and Long, 1980). We also measured the gravimetric moisture content of soil in each pot during the final plant harvest.
4.3.5.	Xylem anatomical analyses
At the end of the experiment, shoot samples of similar diameter were collected in five plants per treatment of each cultivar for microscopic investigation of xylem anatomy. Shoot transverse sections, approximately 50 pm thick, were cut at the same distance from the apex with a hand microtome, stained in a combination of alum carmine and iodine green (Deysson, 1965) and then mounted with synthetic resin. This double staining brought out the lignified elements in green and the cellulose in pink. Measurements of xylem vessel frequency and xylem vessel diameter were made on each cross section. Vessel frequency (vessels mm-2) represents the mean of 90 fields per treatment and vessel diameter (pm) was calculated from the average of two orthogonal measurements of vessel lumen. Average values for vessel diameter were based on 90 vessel elements per treatment. Efficiency and susceptibility to damage during water conduction was evaluated through relative hydraulic conductivity (Zimmermann, 1983) and vulnerability index (Carlquist, 1977). The relative hydraulic conductivity was estimated using a modified Hagen-Poiseuille equation (Fahn, 1986): RC = r4VF, where RC is the relative hydraulic conductivity, r the vessel radius and VF the vessel frequency. The vulnerability index (VI) was calculated as proposed by Carlquist (1977): VI = VD/VF, where VD is the vessel diameter and VF the vessel frequency.
4.3.6.	Statistics
Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to examine cultivar and water availability treatment effects on biomass production and growth, gas exchange, water relations and xylem hydraulic properties of olive plants and least significant difference tests were used to compare among individual treatment means (P &amp;lt;0.05). All data sets satisfied the assumptions
of ANOVA based on homogeneity of variances, normality of errors, and independence of errors. Associations among characters were examined by a Fisher correlation analysis.
4.4.	Results
4.4.1.	Biomass production and growth
To account for differences in initial size of the plants, we assessed biomass production by calculating the variations in biomass over the 111-day treatment period. Biomass at the initial harvest averaged 12.5, 10.1 and 8.7 g in Cobrangosa, Madural and Verdeal Transmontana, respectively. Relative plant biomass produced was significantly different among genotypes and watering regimes (Figure 4.1). Verdeal Transmontana had higher total biomass, but only under well-watered conditions. Not surprisingly, water availability had a significant effect on total relative biomass production, with plants under lower water availability producing less biomass, averaging 68%. However, the extent of the decrease was dependent on olive cultivars. Cobrangosa was less affected (45%) by water stress, whereas Madural and Verdeal Transmontana were more affected (82 and 74%, respectively). Similar decreases were observed for above and belowground biomass production in Cobrangosa and Verdeal Transmontana. Meanwhile, in Madural water-stressed plants the decrease in aboveground biomass was higher than in belowground biomass, a fact suggesting different biomass allocation patterns. Although not statistically significant (P = 0.119), under drought conditions, Madural plants had a tendency to higher root weight ratio and lower shoot weight ratio than Cobrangosa (Table 4.1) and, thus, Madural had a tendency to higher root/shoot ratio (P = 0.147). Moreover, the higher shoot weight ratio of Cobrangosa was due to a higher allocation of biomass to stems, since a slightly decrease of biomass was allocated to leaves.

Significant effects	of genotypes	and watering regimes were			observed on some
morphological parameters (Table 4.2). Cobrangosa had the lowest average leaf surface, but at the same time higher number of leaves than Madural. More pronounced were the effects of watering regimes, since a drop in relative total leaf area was observed in water-stressed plants, mainly due to a decrease in leaf number. In addition, a significant drop in the shoot height was also observed in water-stressed plants. Interestingly, the lower number of leaves in low water availability was associated with a negative balance between leaf emergence and leaf abscission,					
except for Cobrangosa plants (Table 4.2).

Total biomass production was positively correlated with leaf area, although some differences exist among genotypes. In Verdeal Transmontana (Biomass = - 0.365 + 0.053 x leaf area) each unit decrease (1 cm2) in total leaf area resulted in a reduction of 53 mg in total biomass production, whereas in Cobrangosa (Biomass = 7.184 + 0.036 x leaf area) and in
Madural (Biomass = 0.963 + 0.037 x leaf area) the decreases were lower (36 and 37 mg, respectively).
Water stress resulted in marked drop in RGR (Table 4.3), due to a combination of decreases of NAR (43%) and LAR (17%). However, when the responses of cultivars were examined individually, we observed a lower decrease of NAR (22%) in Cobrangosa and a slightly increase of LAR (4%) in Verdeal Transmontana. Moreover, the decrease of RGR in Madural was more dependent from reductions in NAR (68%) than in LAR (28%). Biomass allocation and growth analysis (Tables 4.1 and 4.3) also revealed that the lower LAR in Cobrangosa was mainly caused by the lower leaf weight ratio. Furthermore, SLA was significantly reduced by low water availability.

4.4.2.	Water use efficiency of biomass production
Significant differences in WUE were observed among cultivars (Figure 4.2). Cobrangosa had the highest WUE, but only under drought conditions. The effects of water stress on WUE varied appreciably among genotypes. Low-water availability improved the efficiency in Cobrangosa plants, whereas a reverse trend was noted in Madural and Verdeal Transmontana, although in the last cultivar the difference was not statistically significant. WUE was significantly and positively correlated with total dry weight accumulated in the growing season at the two watering regimes. However, the sensitivity of WUE to changes in biomass (i.e. the slopes of the WUE vs. total dry matter regression lines) was greater in the drier treatment. For instance, the amount of change in WUE for each unit change in total biomass was almost tree times greater in water-stressed plants (WUE = 1.040 x 10-10 + 0.155 x biomass) than in the well-watered controls (WUE = 2.817 x 10-10 + 0.052 x biomass).

4.4.3.	Gas exchange and water potential
Plants subjected to water deficits had lower Tmd, A, E, g3, and Ci/Ca than the well-watered controls, averaging 58, 76, 81, 86 and 28%, respectively (Table 4.4). Although both A and gs decreased in water-stressed plants, gs was comparatively more reduced and intrinsic water use efficiency was higher (65%) in stressed than in well-watered plants. Intraspecific differences and the interaction between genotype and water treatment effects were only
significant on CO2 assimilation rate. In fact, A was higher in Cobran^osa and the extent of the decrease of A by water stress was more pronounced in Madural.

4.4.4.	Xylem anatomy
Significant differences were found in xylem VF among cultivars and watering regimes (Table 4.5). Verdeal Transmontana had the lowest VF. Moreover, water stress induced an increase in VF. Statistical analysis for VD showed significant differences between cultivars and a significant cultivar x water availability regime interaction. VD increased 7% in Cobran^osa water-stressed plants, whereas Verdeal Transmontana plants showed a significant reduction (9%) in VD under low water availability. No significant effects of water availability were detected on VD of Madural plants. The RC had a tendency to decrease in Verdeal Transmontana plants under water stress conditions due to a drop on VD, but increased
significantly in Cobrangosa water-stressed plants, due to both high VF and VD. Nevertheless, no differences were observed in the VI of Cobrangosa water-stressed and control plants. In contrast, VI decreased in Madural and Verdeal Transmontana water-stressed plants.

4.5.	Discussion
Water stress affected growth characteristics and biomass accumulation of the Olea europaea L. cultivars (Figure 4.1; Tables 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3), as it has been observed to other plants species (Pedrol et al., 2000; Pita and Pardos, 2001; Sanchez-Blanco et al., 2002; Anyia and Herzog, 2004). Generally, when water is not restricting growth, plants invest a considerable fraction of photoassimilates in the expansion of photosynthetic tissues, maximizing light interception and, as a consequence, growth (Fisher and Turner, 1978; Dale, 1988). However, under water stress a different strategy imposes a different pattern of allocation of assimilates,
resulting in the decrease of investment in leaves relative to other organs, or the alteration of the relative amounts of photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic tissues (Maroco et al, 2000). This is also in line with the theory of the functional balance proposed by Brouwer (1963), which predicts that plants will react to limited water availability with a relative increase in the flow of assimilates to the root, leading to an increased root weight ratio. In our study, we observed only a slightly increase of root weight ratio in Madural plants, whereas a tendency to lower leaf weight ratio was observed in Madural and Cobran^osa. Overall, root weight ratio of these olive cultivars remained unaffected by water availability, which is in accordance to Poorter and Nagel (2000), who found in a meta-analysis of the literature, that changes in allocation patterns associated with water limitations were modest. Meanwhile, Sobrado and Turner (1986) suggested that a similar root to shoot ratio in well-watered and droughted plants might have been due to a similar degree of osmotic adjustment in root and leaf cells. Interestingly, Cobran^osa plants, mainly in drought conditions, had higher allocation of assimilates to stems, at the expense of allocation to leaves. As a consequence, Cobran^osa plants minimise water loss and, at the same time, could have better partitioning of assimilates to developing fruits, after mobilisation of store reserves in stems. This response is well documented in Lupinus abus L. (Rodrigues et al., 1995).
The drop of RGR in olive water-stressed plants was associated with decreases of net assimilation rate (NAR) and leaf area per unit of total plant biomass (i.e. LAR). Moreover, lower LAR was accomplished by allocating relatively less biomass to leaves (leaf weight ratio) and by producing leaves of high tissue density that would decrease leaf area per unit leaf mass (i.e. SLA), that provided less surface area and therefore lower light harvesting capability per unit of investment in leaf mass (Morse et al, 2002). Similar results were reported in cowpea (Bala Subramanian and Maheswari, 1992; Anyia and Herzog, 2004). An exception to this behaviour was presented by Verdeal Transmontana plants, which had a tendency to higher LAR under low water availability, as a result of increased expansion of younger leaves. In fact, Verdeal Transmontana stressed plants had a tendency to higher leaf size. Similar results were obtained by Pita (1998) in a greenhouse experiment with Eucalypthus genotypes.
Under water stress, total leaf area was sharply reduced in all cultivars due to a combination of leaf growth reduction and shedding of older leaves. The two cultivars with the highest decline in leaf area under water stress (Madural and Verdeal Transmontana) also experienced the highest decline in total biomass. Moreover, these cultivars also had higher decreases of NAR compared to Cobran^osa, the best performing cultivar under drought conditions. In addition, they had large leaves, which suggest that they must be classified as
high-risk cultivars for planting in drought-prone areas (Pita and Pardos, 2001). Cobrangosa plants, with small leaves, are well adapted to the high light and temperature prevailing in Portuguese summer. In fact, a lower leaf size permits greater sensible heat dissipation and efficacious control of water loss by stomatal closure (Jarvis and McNaughton, 1986). The reduction in total leaf area can be considered as a dehydration avoidance mechanism, which minimises water loss by transpiration, enabling plants to resist long water deficit periods while keeping the leaves photosynthetically active (Dichio et al, 2002). Meanwhile, shedding of older leaves that contribute to water saving can also be viewed as a recycling program within the plant, allowing the reallocation of nutrients stored in older leaves to the stem or younger leaves (Chaves et al., 2003). The high performance of Cobrangosa could be also related to their anatomical adaptations to arid habitats such as the high density of the foliar tissue and the presence of thick cuticle and trichome layers, contributing to low water loss (Bacelar et al,
2004).
Decreases in NAR under drought conditions suggest that water availability affects net photosynthetic rate. Gas exchange measurements showed reductions in CO2 assimilation rates in water-stressed olive plants that were associated with increased stomatal resistance (Table 4.4), which decreased available internal CO2 and restricted water loss through transpiration. This response seemed to be effective in preventing large decreases in water potential and, thus, appeared to be the earliest response for dehydration avoidance in olive. Similar results were obtained in field-grown olive trees (Giorio et al, 1999) and in vegetable amaranth (Liu and Stutzel, 2004). As stomatal conductance was more affected than net photosynthesis by water stress, intrinsic water use efficiency increased under low water availability in all cultivars (Table 4.4), indicating an optimisation of carbon uptake versus water loss (Raven, 2002). Moreover, the greater reduction in gs compared with Ci/Ca indicates that non-stomatal components can also play an important role in limiting photosynthesis when olive is submitted to prolonged water deficit under field conditions (Giorio et al, 1999). The C values should be treated with some caution, due to the non-uniform aperture of stomata over the leaf surface (patchiness). Under environmental stress conditions (such as water stress), the Ci calculated from gas exchange measurements can be overestimated and lead to erroneous conclusions of non-stomatal limitation of photosynthesis (Downton et al, 1988). However, our analysis is based on the assumption that patchy stomatal closure did not occur in mature olive leaves (Loreto and Sharkey, 1990; Nogues and Baker, 2000).
important for the general function of plants as they exert a strong influence on water transport and, therefore, on the potential for carbon uptake (Zimmermann, 1977). In all cultivars, water stress induced an increase in VF, providing a greater vascular potential and a greater security of xylem sap conduction under drought conditions (Terral and Mengüal, 1999). Cobrangosa water-stressed plants revealed the highest VF, suggesting that its water flow system has a lower probability to suffer a dysfunction, since the abundant vessels allow the well functioning of the conduction system if some vessels are disabled by cavitation (Carlquist, 1977). On the other hand, Verdeal Transmontana control plants revealed the lowest VF, suggesting a higher probability to suffer a dysfunction of its water flow system, confirmed by its high VI.
Madural and Verdeal Transmontana plants showed a significant reduction in VD under low water availability. In general, vessels with narrow diameters are less susceptible to embolism (Lovisolo and Schubert, 1998). However, variations in xylem conduit diameter can radically affect the function of the conducting system because of the fourth-power relationship between radius and flow through a capillary tube, as described by the Hagen-Poiseuille law. As a consequence, the RC decreased in Madural and Verdeal Transmontana plants under water stress conditions. Decreases in hydraulic conductivity of xylem under drought conditions have already been observed: Salleo and Lo Gullo (1993) observed losses of about 10% of hydraulic conductivity in one-year-old twigs of young Olea oleaster trees, when these became water-stressed, due to xylem cavitation. The low hydraulic conductivity of xylem seems to play an important role in the olive water relations since it allows the tree to avoid water loss on days of high atmospheric demand (Fernández et al, 1997).
Under water stress conditions, Cobrangosa plants were able to maintain the same level of protection against cavitation and to turn more efficient the water transport through the xylem, revealing a trade-off between safety (low vulnerability to cavitation) and efficiency (large hydraulic conductivity). An increased RC was advantageous for Cobrangosa water-stressed plants by increasing leaf water supply and, therefore, increasing the potential for carbon uptake, contributing to a high water use efficiency of biomass production. It is well established that plant biomass production depends on the amount of water used for growth as well as on WUE (Anyia and Herzog, 2004). WUE was enhanced by 64% in Cobrangosa water-stressed plants (Figure 4.2), while in the rest of the genotypes it was either unaffected (Verdeal Transmontana) or considerably decreased (Madural). For production on relatively dry sites, cultivars that are characterised by high values of WUE, such as Cobrangosa, appear to be the most promising. The absence of a significant association between A/gs (increased in all cultivars) and WUE (increased only in Cobrangosa) reflects the difference in time scale of both
processes (from seconds to months) and non-accounted energy expenses in growth and maintenance in the long-term water-use (Maroco etal., 2000).
Passioura (1982) pointed out that two types of water-use behaviour may be employed in woody plants. The prodigal water-use behaviour is beneficial in conditions where water supply is interrupted for short periods only. In this situation there is little danger of serious desiccation despite rapid water-use, and it enables a plant to grow quickly. The conservative water-use behaviour is beneficial in conditions where a long dry period prevails, enabling the plant to use the available water efficiently. According to this theory of plant water-use behaviour, Madural and Verdeal Transmontana with lower WUE appear to employ a prodigal water-use strategy, whereas Cobrançosa with high WUE appears to employ a conservative water-use strategy. In fact, under low water availability, the soil moisture at the final harvest was higher in Cobrançosa (mean = 9.8%; data not shown) than Madural (7.3%) and in Verdeal Transmontana (7.1%). Under high water availability, the soil moisture content was slightly low in Verdeal Transmontana (19.2%) than in Madural (23.2%) and in Cobrançosa (24.4%).
From the above mentioned results, it can be concluded that olive cultivars responded to water stress by developing avoidance mechanisms based on stomatal closure, changes in xylem hydraulic properties and reduction in the canopy area. The results also indicate that young Cobrançosa plants can withstand water stress conditions more effectively than Madural and Verdeal Transmontana plants. From the behaviour of Cobrançosa plants, with a lower allocation of assimilates to leaves, smaller leaves, a smaller reduction in net assimilation rate and photosynthetic rate, a more efficient water transport through the xylem, and a more enhanced water use efficiency of biomass production under water stress conditions, we consider this cultivar very promising for cultivation in semi-arid areas.
In summary, intraspecific differences were found in growth, gas exchange, xylem hydraulic properties and water use efficiency of biomass production of olive tree cultivars subjected to water stress. However, in order to clarify the mechanisms by which olive cultivars cope with drought stress, it will be necessary to relate the results obtained in this study to data from future field trials.

5.	IMMEDIATE RESPONSES AND ADAPTATIVE STRATEGIES OF THREE OLIVE CULTIVARS UNDER CONTRASTING WATER AVAILABILITY REGIMES: CHANGES ON STRUCTURE AND CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF FOLIAGE AND OXIDATIVE DAMAGE
5.1.	Abstract
Changes in anatomy, sclerophylly, pressure-volume relationships, chemical composition and oxidative stress symptoms were studied in leaves of three Olea europaea L. cultivars (Cobrangosa, Madural and Verdeal Transmontana), submitted to contrasting water availability regimes. Anatomically, Cobrangosa and Madural were more capable than Verdeal Transmontana to cope with low water (LW) availability, with a thicker upper epidermis, a thicker palisade parenchyma and a higher stomatal density. Cobrangosa leaves also revealed the lowest specific leaf area and the highest density of the foliar tissue. Under LW conditions, Cobrangosa and Madural showed greater capability for osmotic adjustment and increased tissue rigidity. By contrast, Verdeal Transmontana did not exhibit osmotic adjustment, but was able to increase tissue elasticity and total soluble protein concentration. Leaves grown under LW conditions revealed signs of oxidative stress, with decreases in chlorophyll, carotenoid and total thiol concentrations and increased levels of lipid peroxidation. Nevertheless, LW plants developed some defence mechanisms against oxidative stress, like the increase in total phenol and total soluble protein concentrations. Comparatively, Cobrangosa revealed more protection against oxidative stress. In opposition, the increased levels of lipid peroxidation and the decreased total thiol concentration under LW conditions suggest that the mechanisms against oxidative stress were less effective in Madural.
Key words: elastic and osmotic adjustment, leaf anatomy, lipid peroxidation, Olea europaea L., oxidative stress, water availability.
5.2.	Introduction
Olive (Olea europaea L.) is a schlerophyllous evergreen tree with a high degree of drought tolerance (Lo Gullo and Salleo, 1988). The olive ability to acclimate to water availability includes alterations at leaf level, associated with morphological, anatomical and physiological characteristics. Olive cultivars well adapted to drought-field conditions reveal enhanced sclerophylly, with high density of the foliar tissue and the presence of thick cuticle and trichome layers (Bacelar et al, 2004a). Adaptations to water availability also involve changes in foliar
chemistry. Lowering the osmotic potential due to the accumulation of compatible solutes in the cytoplasm is a well-established ecophysiological mechanism whereby many plants adjust to low soil water availability (Morgan, 1984; Ingram and Bartels, 1986). On the other hand, changes in cell wall elasticity can also contribute to turgor maintenance under drought conditions (Patakas and Noitsakis, 1999).
Upon mild and moderate water deficit conditions, photosynthesis decreases in olive plants mainly due to stomatal closure (Angelopoulos et al., 1996). However, as the stress progresses, biochemical constraints may limit the photosynthetic CO2 fixation more directly (Lawlor, 1995). The limitation of CO2 assimilation in water-stressed plants causes the overreduction of photosynthetic electron chain. This excess of reducing power determines a redirection of photon energy into processes that favour the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mainly in the photosynthetic (Asada, 1999) and mitochondrial electron transport chains (Moller, 2001). Reactive oxygen species, which include singlet oxygen, superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals, are necessary for the correct functioning of plants and can play a role in inter-and intracellular signalling (Foyer and Noctor, 1999). Plants are endowed with a complex antioxidant system to cope with ROS (Smirnoff, 1993). However, when the accumulation of ROS under water stress conditions exceeds the removing capacity of the antioxidant system, the effects of oxidative damage arise, including oxidation of cellular lipids and proteins, destruction of photosynthetic pigments and inactivation of photosynthetic enzymes (Smirnoff, 1993; Yordanov et al, 2000). It has been reported that water supplied by irrigation minimizes the negative effects of water stress on olive performance (Fernández and Moreno, 1999), probably reducing the oxidative damage at leaf level. Therefore, we assumed that the damages caused by oxidative stress are reduced in well-watered plants. To test this hypothesis, we submitted one-year-old plants of three Portuguese O.europaea cultivars to contrasting water availability regimes during the dry season. As symptoms of oxidative stress, we investigated the leaf concentration of photosynthetic pigments (chlorophylls, carotenoids), total soluble proteins, total thiols and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. In this work, we also evaluated the alterations on leaf anatomy, sclerophylly and on both elastic and osmotic adjustment, in order to improve the knowledge about the adaptative strategies of young olive plants to water availability.
5.3.	Materials and methods
5.3.1.	Plant material and growth conditions
The experiment was conducted at the University of Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro, Vila Real, Portugal (41°19'N and 7°44'W; 450 m elevation), between 27 May and 16 September 2002. The study was carried out with three Portuguese olive cultivars (O. europaea L. cv. Cobrançosa, Madural and Verdeal Transmontana), widely cultivated in Trás-os-Montes (northeast Portugal). One-year-old, own-rooted plants were grown in 10 dm3 pots filled with a mixture of sandy-loam soil and peat (2:1, v/v) in a glasshouse situated at the University campus as described in Bacelar et al. (2006). Samples were analysed using standard procedures at the University of Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro Soil Analysis Laboratory. Chemical analysis revealed an initial water pH of 6.3 with an organic matter content of 100.2 g kg-1 and a cation exchange capacity of 9.9 meq 100 g-1. Pots were randomly arranged and periodically rotated to minimize the effects of environmental heterogeneity. During early May 2002, 40 uniform plants (based on height, leaf number and total leaf area) of each cultivar were selected for study. The experiment comprised six treatments of three cultivars x two watering regimes in a factorial design. Sixteen pots of each cultivar were watered to field capacity supplying weekly (between 27 May and 16 September 2002) an amount of water equal to transpirational losses (control, well-watered plants, WW). Another sixteen pots received once per week only one-third of the water needed to maintain the soil at field capacity, in order to simulate a moderate plant water stress (plants under low water availability, LW). The amount of water added during each watering, combined with the size of containers, resulted in negligible leaching through the bottoms of the containers. The pots were covered with plastic film and aluminium foil in order to avoid evaporation from the soil surface and to minimize temperature increases inside the containers.
5.3.2.	Leaf anatomy study and tissue measurements
Anatomical tissue measurements were performed on eight healthy, fully expanded mature leaves collected at the end of the experiment. The thickness of whole leaf blade, palisade and spongy parenchyma, upper and lower epidermis and trichome layer were measured by micrometer in leaf cross sections of fresh material prepared for microscopic examination. Sections were taken from the middle of the leaves to avoid differential thickness along the leaf. Stomatal density (number of stomata per unit leaf area) was measured in artificial replicas of polish (colodium) applied to the abaxial surface of eight leaves per treatment after peltate hairs were removed.
At the end of the experiment, other eight mature leaves per treatment were gathered. In those leaves, the following parameters were examined: leaf area (LA), measured with an LI-3100 leaf area meter (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE), fresh mass (FM), fresh mass at full turgor (TM), measured after immersion of leaf petioles in demineralised water for 48 h in the dark at 4 °C and dry mass (DM), measured after oven-drying at 70 °C to a constant weight. Further, the sclerophylly indices were calculated: the specific leaf area (SLA), determined as the ratio of LA to DM of individual leaves and leaf tissue density (D), calculated as D=(DM/FM)1000 (Dijkstra,
1989).
Several indices of leaf water status were calculated in the same leaves used to determine the sclerophylly indices: relative water content (RWC), calculated as RWC=(FM-DM)/(TM-DM)100, succulence [S=(FM-DM)/LA], water content at saturation [WCS=(TM-DM)/DM] and water saturation deficit [WSD=(TM-FM)/(TM-DM)100].
Plant water parameters were estimated by pressure-volume (P-V) curves constructed with a repeat pressurization method (Hinckley et al, 1980), using a nitrogen gas supplied pressure chamber (PMS, Oregon, Corvallis, USA). Five mature leaves were sampled per treatment in each cultivar. The leaf samples were immediately put in tubes with the petioles sunken in distilled water and kept in darkness until reception at the laboratory. In this way, oversaturation and sources of error in the rehydration process of the tissues for reaching turgor are presumably avoided (Aranda et al, 1996). At the laboratory, leaves were subjected to a rehydration treatment by dipping their petioles in distilled water for 24 h. An analysis by water potential isotherms through a progressive loss of symplasmic water was carried out. At periodic intervals, samples were weighted and immediately water potential was evaluated using a pressure chamber (internally covered with moist paper to reduce transpiration during measurement). Leaves were dried on a laboratory bench at a constant temperature of 20 °C and the drying period in each curve was about 6-8 h. Pressure-volume curves were drawn using a type II transformation (Tyree and Ritcher, 1982) and allowed the deduction of the following parameters: osmotic potential at full turgor (TOft), osmotic potential at turgor loss point (T| Itlp), maximum bulk modulus of elasticity (smax) and relative water content at turgor loss point (RWCtlp). Osmotic adjustment (OA) was calculated as the difference of TOft between WW and LW treatments.
5.3.3.	Foliar metabolic assays and oxidative stress indicators
sections were ground in 80% acetone for chlorophyll and carotenoid determination. Total chlorophyll Chl(a+b) concentration was determined according to Sestak et al (1971) and total carotenoids (Car) concentration according to Lichtenthaler (1987).
Total soluble sugars (SS) were extracted by heating leaf discs in 80% ethanol, according to Irigoyen et al (1992). SS were analysed by the reaction of 200 ml of the alcoholic extract with 3 ml of fresh anthrone and placed in a boiling water bath for 10 min. After cooling, the absorbance at 625 nm was determined. After the extraction of the soluble fractions, the solid fraction was used for starch analysis. Starch (St) was extracted with 30% perchloric acid, according to Osaki etal. (1991). The St concentration was determined by the anthrone method, as described above. Glucose was used as a standard for both SS and St.
The concentration of total phenols (TP) in leaf extracts was determined on the same extract used for pigment analysis, according to the Folin-Ciocalteu's procedure (Singleton and Rossi, 1965).
The amount of total soluble proteins (SP) was quantified using the method of Bradford (1976). Leaf discs were homogeneized in a grinding medium that contained 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), 0.1 mM EDTA, 100 mM PMSF and 2% (w/v) PVP. Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard.
Total thiol content (-SH) of soluble protein extract was assayed according to Ellman (1959), using 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB). Total soluble protein extract (0.5 ml) was mixed with 1 ml of 4% (w/v) sulfosalicylic acid and centrifugated at 20,000 g for 5 min. The supernatant (1 ml) was incubated with agitation during 15 min with 4 ml of 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8) and 70 ml of 10 mM DTNB, freshly prepared in ethanol absolute. Absorbance was determined at 412 nm and the -SH concentration was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 13,600 M-1 cm-1 (Ellman, 1959).
The degree of lipid peroxidation was used to calculate membrane integrity. The lipid peroxidation products in olive leaves were estimated following the method of Heath and Packer (1968), with some adaptations. Briefly, leaves samples previously freezed with liquid nitrogen were ground in 3 ml of 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid (TCA) using mortar and pestle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 3,500 g for 20 min. To 1 ml of the supernatant, 1 ml of 20% TCA containing 0.5% (w/v) thiobarbituric acid and 1 ml 4% (w/v) butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), were added. The mixture was heated at 95 °C for 30 min and then quickly cooled in an ice bath and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min and the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 532 nm. The value for the non-specific absorption at 600 nm was subtracted. The total thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) concentration was expressed in terms of mg g-1 DM, using an extinction coefficient of 155 x 10-3 M-1 cm-1 (Costa etal, 2002).
All reagents and chemicals used were of the highest grade of purity commercially available.
5.3.4.	Statistics
All data were subjected to a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with previous data transformation whenever required. Proportional data expressed as percentages and ratio were arc sine square-root and log transformed, respectively. Significant different means were separated using the Fisher's LSD test (P &amp;lt;0.05).
5.4.	Results
Anatomical characteristics of leaves are presented in Table 5.1. Water availability did not significantly influenced leaf tissue thickness and stomatal density of olive plants. Nevertheless, intraspecific differences were observed in some parameters. Verdeal Transmontana leaves showed a thinner upper epidermis and palisade parenchyma and the lowest stomatal density. In addition, those leaves had the lowest palisade/spongy parenchyma ratio. On the other hand, Cobrangosa leaves had a thinner spongy parenchyma and Madural leaves revealed an increase in spongy parenchyma thickness under LW conditions.
Leaves developed under LW conditions had a lower SLA (15%) than leaves produced under WW conditions (Table 5.2), associated with an increase in D (21.2%). Among cultivars, Cobrangosa had the lowest SLA and the highest D (Table 5.2). In our study, the LW plants revealed lower RWC, S and WCS and higher WSD than control plants (Table 5.2). No differences were observed among cultivars in the indices of leaf water status except for WCS, with Cobrangosa revealing the lowest value (1.04 g H2O g-1 dm).
Low water availability caused significant decreases in T| Ift , T| Itlp, TM/DM and cultivar effect was significant for T| 1^ and sMAX (Table 5.3). The TnFT values for Cobrangosa were the lowest among cultivars (1.43 MPa), whereas sMAX was higher in Madural. Osmotic adjustment was more pronounced in Cobrangosa and Madural (0.77 and 0.88 MPa, respectively) than in Verdeal Transmontana (0.16 MPa). The sMAX values increased in Cobrangosa and Madural plants and decreased in Verdeal Transmontana under LW conditions. No cultivar or watering regime effects were observed on RWCTLP. However, a cultivar x watering regime interaction was observed: no significant differences were detected in Cobrangosa and Verdeal Transmontana, but Madural plants revealed a 13% decline in RWCTLP under LW conditions.
The Chl(a+b) and Car concentrations were lower in LW plants (more evident as expressed on leaf dry mass) (Table 5.4), and this result was accompanied by a significantly lower Chl/Car ratio. Meanwhile, low water plants presented higher levels of SS and St, mainly in Cobrangosa and Madural (Table 5.4).

Water availability had statistically significant effects on TP and SP expressed by leaf area (Table 5.5). Plants under LW conditions revealed higher concentrations of TP and SP. Among cultivars, no significant differences were observed in TP concentrations. On the other hand, Verdeal Transmontana plants revealed higher SP concentration, mainly under LW conditions.

5.5.	Discussion
Water availability did not significantly influenced leaf tissue thickness and stomatal density of young olive plants (Table 5.1). Nevertheless, the analysis of leaf anatomical traits may explain the different strategies of O. europaea cultivars under LW conditions. In fact, Cobran^osa and Madural leaves showed a thicker upper epidermis and palisade parenchyma and higher stomatal density than Verdeal Transmontana leaves. A thicker upper epidermis (including upper cuticle) and a thicker palisade parenchyma in those cultivars may enhance
survival and growth under LW conditions by improving water relations and providing higher protection for the inner tissues (Bacelar et al., 2004a). On the other hand, the highest stomatal density of those cultivars, certainly contributes to avoid water stress by possessing flexible regulation (Bolhar-Nordenkampf, 1987).
As expected, the results indicated that water availability plays a primary role in modifying leaf structure. Leaves developed under LW conditions have a lower SLA than leaves produced under WW conditions (Table 5.2). Specific leaf area has often been observed to be reduced under drought conditions and variations in it may be due to variations in leaf thickness and/or variations in leaf density (Veneklaas et al, 2002). In our study, the reduction in SLA under LW conditions was due to an increase in D (Table 5.2), since no differences in leaf thickness were observed by the anatomical study (Table 5.1). Water stress can increase D, since reductions in turgor pressure and cell expansion result in the same dry mass within a smaller leaf area (Peña-Rojas et al, 2005). Among cultivars, Cobrangosa had the lowest SLA and the highest D (Table 5.2). According to Witkowski and Lamont (1991), variations in leaf density, manifested as variations in the dry mass to fresh mass ratio, may be the result of differences in thickness and density of the cuticle and cell walls, inclusions in the cells (starch grains, crystals) and abundance of air spaces, sclereids, fibre groups and vascular bundles. Leaves with high D are better able to survive a severe drought because of a higher resistance to physical damage by desiccation (Mediavilla et al, 2001). The leaves with high D are also mechanically more stable than leaves with low D, and this may be the fundamental cause for their longer life-span (Niinemets, 2001). The highest D in Cobrangosa plants corroborate the anatomical study, which revealed a thinner spongy parenchyma for this cultivar, and is probably related to the small volume of intercellular spaces.
According to the RWC values (Table 5.2), LW plants reached a moderate level of water stress. In addition, LW plants had lower S and WCS than control plants but higher WSD (Table
5.2). On average, LW plants had WSD values of around 8%, a value suggested by Larcher (1960) as optimal for CO2 absorption and transpiration. No differences were observed among cultivars in the indices of leaf water status except for WCS (Table 5.2). In fact, Cobrangosa plants revealed the lower WCS values, what means that this cultivar have a greater capacity to withstand arid environments (Abd-El-Rahman etal, 1966; Bacelar etal, 2004a).
Modifications of leaf structure in response to water stress not only improve resistance of leaf cells to collapse (Oertli et al, 1990), but also bring about changes in tissue elasticity (Niklas, 1989). In our experiment, sMAX significantly increased in Cobrangosa and Madural plants under LW conditions (Table 5.3). However, a significant drop in sMAX (i.e. increased tissue
elasticity) was observed in Verdeal Transmontana plants under LW conditions. Decreases and increases of smax as an effect of drought have also been described in other species (Aranda et al., 1996, DaMatta et al, 2003; Lemcoff et al, 2002). Both increases and decreases in smax may aid survival during LW conditions. A decrease of smax in Verdeal Transmontana plants under LW conditions may reflect changes on cell wall composition (Munoz et al, 1993). More elastic cell walls can shrink more easily when subjected to stress, helping the maintenance of higher turgor pressure and protecting cell walls from rupturing (Joly and Zaerr, 1987). The higher turgor maintenance ability may help Verdeal Transmontana plants to tolerate tissue dehydration and maintain leaf growth under moderate water stress conditions (Jane and Green, 1983). On the other hand, increases of sMAX in Cobran^osa and Madural plants under LW conditions, combined with reduced TM/DM values (Table 5.3) were indicative of cell wall adjustment, reduced turgorloss volumes and tightening of the cell walls around the protoplasts, suggesting a cell size reduction (Lemcoff, et al, 2002). Rigid cells may also help to maintain lower water potential at any given volume than do elastic ones (Patakas et al, 2002). This can result in an increase in the gradient in water potential between the soil and the plant, thereby promoting more effective water uptake from drying soils and/or accelerating recovery after watering (Bowman and Roberts, 1985).
Madural plants revealed a 13% decline in RWCTLP under LW conditions (Table 5.3). A decrease in RWCtlp is reported to be closely associated with drought tolerance (Turner, 1986; Wan et al, 1998), and recent findings suggest that may be a function of cell wall adjustment and tightening of cell walls around the protoplasts (Marshall and Dumbroff, 1999).
In Cobran^osa and Madural plants, LW availability caused significant decreases in TOft and in TOtlp (together with strong increases in smax) (Table 5.3). This indicates a greater ability for OA, presumably as a consequence of an active increase in the concentration of solutes (DaMatta et al, 2003). In fact, both cultivars revealed increases in SS concentrations under LW conditions (Table 6.4). Altogether, these traits should act to decrease the water potential and relative water deficit at zero turgor (Pavlik, 1984). It is commonly observed that water stress conditions induce an accumulation of soluble sugars in leaves (Quick et al, 1992). Total soluble sugars may act as osmoprotectants as well as being sources of carbon for maintenance and regrowth during recovery (Chaves et al, 2002). Moreover, Sofo et al. (2004) reported that olive trees under drought-stress conditions activate OA mechanisms not only in leaves, but also in roots, in such a way increasing their capacity to extract water from dry soil.
et al, 1992), resulting in an increase in sucrose concentration (Chaves, 1991). Thus, we had expected an increase in SS concentration in leaves of LW plants, as a consequence of greater sucrose synthesis plus starch degradation (Patakas et al, 2002). However, this was not evident in our results. The higher concentrations of St in the leaves of LW plants, in spite of the lowest photosynthetic rates (Bacelar et al, 2006), suggest that carbon was not translocated out of the leaves because these plants were sink-limited.
Leaves grown under LW conditions revealed signs of oxidative stress. One of the signs was the large reductions in leaf Chl(a+b) and Car concentration (Table 5.4). According to Smirnoff (1993), the decrease of chlorophyll content is a typical symptom of oxidative stress and may be the result of chlorophyll degradation or be due to chlorophyll synthesis deficiency together with changes of thylakoid membrane structure (Brito etal, 2003). Bussis etal (1998) indicated that expanded leaves exposed to water deficit started to degrade their photosynthetic apparatus, possibly to mobilise resources for the production of new acclimated leaves. The Chl/Car ratio was significantly lower in olive plants under LW conditions. This result can be used as an early indicator for chlorosis of LW plants and reveals an increased need for photoprotection of chlorophylls by carotenoids (Tausz et al, 1998). It is now well documented that carotenoids are involved in the protection of the photosynthetic apparatus against photoinhibitory damage by singlet oxygen (1O2), which is produced by the excited triplet state of chlorophyll (Young et al, 1997).
Another sign of oxidative stress in leaves grown under LW conditions was the increased levels of lipid peroxidation (Figure 5.2). Several studies have been shown lipid peroxidation in water-deficit conditions (Paulin et al, 1986), including studies with Olea europea L. plants (Sofo et al, 2004; Bacelar et al, 2004b). Lipid peroxidation is a natural metabolic process under normal aerobic conditions and is one of the most investigated ROS actions on membrane structure and function (Blokhina et al, 2003). It is widely reported that ROS bring about peroxidation of membrane lipids leading to membrane damage (Shalata and Tal, 1998). Since cell membranes are the first targets of many plant stresses, the maintenance of their integrity and stability under water stress conditions is a major component of drought tolerance in plants (Bajji et al, 2002). Considering the TBARS concentration as a biochemical marker for the ROS mediated injury, results suggest that WW availability reduces the oxidative damage on cell membranes by lipid peroxidation (Sofo et al, 2004), validating our working hypothesis. However, the results also revealed different levels of susceptibility to lipid peroxidation of the olive tree cultivars (Figure 5.2). In fact, Cobrangosa plants revealed higher peroxidation
resistance under LW conditions, observed by the lowest increase in TBARS concentration (21%).
In response to LW conditions, leaves exhibited higher levels of TP and SP (Table 5.5). Environmental conditions, such as water stress, may restrict plant growth rather than reducing the rate of photosynthesis. Under such conditions non-structural carbohydrates tend to accumulate and more phenolic compounds are produced (Bryant et al, 1983). Some of those secondary metabolites, like the polyphenols, possess ideal chemistry for free radical scavenging actively acting as plant antioxidants (Blokhina et al, 2003). Another mechanism underlying the antioxidant properties of phenolics is the ability of flavonoids to alter peroxidation kinetics by modification of the lipid packing order and to decrease fluidity of the membranes (Arora et al, 2000).
Low water plants revealed 22% more SP than WW plants and, among cultivars, the Verdeal Transmontana plants had the highest SP concentration (Table 5.5). Changes of soluble protein contents are important to understand the impact of stress on cell proteolysis and protein synthesis (Santos and Caldeira, 1999). During drought periods, plants undergo many physiological changes and induce a large number of genes for adaptation (Ingram and Bartels,
1996). Under water-deficit conditions, a typical change in gene expression is the induction of genes involved in the synthesis of various osmolytes and low-molecular-weight proteins, e.g. dehydrins and late embryogenic-abundant proteins (Ingram and Bartels, 1996). Moreover, the increase of SP under LW conditions may represent increased activity of oxidative stress defence enzymes. In fact, under mild water deficit, an increase in activities of superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase and catalase has been reported (Baisak et al, 1994).The accumulation of leaf proteins under water deficit may also represent a reserve of nitrogen to be used during the recovery after summer drought (Millard, 1988).
Bartoli et al (1999) observed that total thiol concentration in wheat leaves was altered under oxidative stress conditions. In our study, low water availability induced a decrease in total thiol content in Madural (Figure 5.1), probably due to the oxidation of non-proteic -SH groups. Oxidative stress depletion of non-proteic thiols enhances the susceptibility to membrane damage by TBARS and may trigger ROS irreversible negative effects on cellular function (Ali et al, 2005). In opposition, Cobrangosa plants respond to LW conditions with a tendency to an enrichment of -SH compounds (e.g. glutathione) that may function as reducers of oxidative damage (Ali et al, 2005).
support our hypothesis that WW availability reduces the damages caused by oxidative stress. In fact, the high Chl and Car concentrations, the lower extent of lipid peroxidation and the high -SH content indicates that WW plants were less damaged by oxidative stress than LW plants. On the contrary, in olive plants submitted to LW conditions, the ROS-induced lipid peroxidation, associated with pigment degradation, may result in loss of photosynthetic functionality. In fact, Bacelar et al. (2006) indicates a decrease of 76% in the photosynthetic rate of LW plants. Nevertheless, it was possible to observe that LW plants developed some defence mechanisms against oxidative stress, like the increases in TP and SP concentration. We consider that further studies investigating the activity of protective enzymes (e.g. superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase and glutathione reductase) and other non-enzymatic antioxidants (ascorbic acid, tocopherol) are required to establish the relevance of the results.

6.	PHYSIOLOGICAL BEHAVIOUR, OXIDATIVE DAMAGE AND ANTIOXIDATIVE PROTECTION OF OLIVE TREES GROWN UNDER DIFFERENT IRRIGATION REGIMES
6.1.	Abstract
Irrigation effects were investigated on an 8-year-old olive (Olea europaea L., cv. Cobrangosa) commercial orchard located in northeast Portugal. Trees were subjected to a rainfed control (T0) and 3 treatments (T1, T2, T3) that received a seasonal water amount equivalent to 30, 60 and 100% of the estimated local evaporative demand by a drip irrigation system. Irrigation increases the photosynthetic activity of olive trees, in association with increases in water status, and reduces the midday and afternoon depression in gas exchange. The closely association between photosynthetic rate (/I) and stomatal conductance (gs) revealed that the decline in net photosynthesis over the course of the day was largely a consequence of stomatal limitation. However, the ratio of intercellular to atmospheric CO2 concentration increased markedly from morning to midday in non-irrigated plants, in spite of lower gs, suggesting that non-stomatal limitations of photosynthesis also occur when environmental conditions become more stressful. The occurrence of perturbations at chloroplastic level in rainfed plants was demonstrated by a lower maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II during the afternoon. Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements also revealed the occurrence of a dynamic photoinhibition in irrigated trees, mainly in T2 and T3, which seemed to be effective in protecting the photosynthetic apparatus from photodamage. Irrigation enhances antioxidant protection and decreases the oxidative damage at leaf level. Leaves grown under rainfed conditions revealed symptoms of oxidative stress, like the reduction (14%) in chlorophyll concentration and the increased levels (57%) of lipid peroxidation. We also found that the scavenging function of superoxide dismutase was impaired in rainfed plants. In contrast, the low thiobarbituric acid reactive substances concentration in T3 indicates that irrigation enhances the repairing mechanisms and decreases the oxidative damage by lipid peroxidation. Accordingly, leaves in T3 treatment had high levels of -SH compounds and the highest antioxidant potential. Meanwhile, the finding that guaiacol peroxidase activity increased in rainfed plants, associated with the appearance of oxidative damage, suggests that this enzyme has no major antioxidative function in olive.
Key words: antioxidant enzymes, chlorophyll fluorescence, gas exchange, lipid peroxidation, photoinhibition, radical scavenging activity.
6.2.	Introduction
During the summer, Olive (Olea europaea L.) is often subjected to periods of severe drought and leaves exhibit large reductions in relative water content and water potential (Nogués and Baker, 2000). Frequently, large decreases in photosynthetic activity are associated with such changes in water status. Upon mild and moderate water deficit conditions, photosynthesis decreases in olive plants mainly due to stomatal closure, whereas non-stomatal factors would limit carbon assimilation under severe drought (Angelopoulos et al, 1996). Even under irrigation, stomatal conductance can substantially restrict CO2 entry into the leaves as a result of the interaction of low vapour pressure deficits in the atmosphere with high temperature and irradiance (Osório et al, 2006). It has been demonstrated that the combination of these factors predispose plants to photoinhibition or down-regulation process. In particular, a CO2 deprivation at the chloroplast level by stomatal closure during the warmest period of the day could enhance the sensitivity of the photosynthetic apparatus to high irradiance (Faria et al, 1998; Flexas et al, 1998).
The limitation of CO2 assimilation in water-stressed plants causes the over-reduction of photosynthetic electron chain. This excess of reducing power determines a redirection of photon energy into processes that favour the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mainly in the photosynthetic (Asada, 1999) and mitochondrial electron transport chains (Moller, 2001). Plants are endowed with a complex antioxidant system to cope with ROS (Smirnoff,
1993). However, when the accumulation of ROS under water stress conditions exceeds the removing capacity of the antioxidant system, the effects of oxidative damage arise, including oxidation of cellular lipids and proteins, destruction of photosynthetic pigments and inactivation of photosynthetic enzymes (Smirnoff, 1993).
Previous studies reported that water supply minimises the negative effects of water stress on olive performance (Fernández and Moreno, 1999), and reduces the oxidative damage in young olive plants growing in pots (Bacelar et al, 2006). However, the response of field-grown olive trees to irrigation is not well documented at this level. The aim of this work was to evaluate the benefits of irrigation in mature olive trees growing under Mediterranean conditions. We hypothesize that irrigation improve carbon assimilation and protect the photosynthetic apparatus from the high risk of photodamage occasioned by the superimposed stresses to which the plants were subjected under field conditions. To test this hypothesis we compared plant water status, gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence in olive trees growing under different irrigation regimes. We also hypothesize that irrigation enhances antioxidant protection
and decreases the oxidative damage at leaf level. To this aim we have carried out measurements of the leaf concentration of photosynthetic pigments (chlorophylls, carotenoids), soluble sugars, starch, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, total phenols, UV-B absorbing compounds, total soluble proteins and total thiols. We also evaluated the radical scavenging activity of leaf extracts and antioxidant enzymes activities.

6.3.1.	Site description, plant material and treatments
The experiment took place during three consecutive years, from 2002 to 2004, on an 8-year-old olive (Olea europaea L., cv. Cobrangosa) commercial orchard located at Vilarelhos (41O21' N and 6O45' W; at an elevation of 320 m above sea level), a typical olive-growing area in northeast Portugal. The sandy-loam soil of the experimental site (organic matter 0.74%, P2O5 102 mg kg-1, K2O 89 mg kg-1 and pH 5.8) was characterized by volumetric water content of 23.6% at field capacity (soil matric potential of -0.03 MPa) and 9.7% at wilting point (soil matric potential of -1.5 MPa). Tree arrangement was 6 m x 6 m and the experimental design was a complete randomized block (one tree per block), replicated four times. During the first years after planting, all plots were irrigated equally to guarantee the uniform tree development. Differentiation of irrigation levels started in May 2002. Four irrigation treatments were applied: a rainfed control (T0) and three treatments (T1, T2, T3) that received a seasonal water amount equivalent to 30, 60 and 100% of the estimated local evaporative demand. The trees were drip-irrigated daily by two drippers per tree, each with a flow rate of 4 l h-1. Trees were irrigated in the following periods: May 17-September 30 in 2002, June 26-September 30 in 2003, and June 4-October 6 in 2004. Olive trees have been trained, pruned and managed every year according to standard commercial procedures suited to high-density plantings.
The climate in the zone is typically Mediterranean (Figure 6.1), with 520 mm of average rainfall, concentrated mainly from autumn to spring (INMG, 1991). The warmer months are July/August and the coldest are December/January, with average daily temperatures of 23.6/22.9 °C and 6.3/6.1 °C, respectively.
The effects of irrigation on the physiology of olive trees were analyzed in 2002, 2003 and 2004. Since the results were quite similar in the 3 studied years, only the data obtained in 2003 (the driest and the hottest year from May until September) are presented. To facilitate the study, the more time-consuming measurements were made only for the extreme irrigation treatments T0 and T3.

6.3.2.	Leaf water status and stem water potential
Six mature leaves per treatment were detached in a similar position to determine leaf water status. After cutting, the petiole was immediately immersed in demineralised water inside a glass tube, which was immediately sealed. The tubes were then taken to the laboratory where the increased weight of the tubes was used to determine leaf fresh mass (FM). After 48 h in the dark, the leaves were weighed to obtain fresh mass at full turgor (TM). Dry mass (DM) was measured after oven-drying at 70 °C to a constant weight. Leaf water status was assessed by the relative water content (RWC), calculated as RWC=(FM-DM)/(TM-DM)x100, and the water content at saturation (WCS=(TM-DM)/DM).
Stem water potential measurements were used to evaluate tree water status. Predawn stem water potentials (TPD) were measured, on 6 sun-exposed shoots using a pressure chamber (PMS, Corvallis, OR), according to Scholander et al. (1965). Care was taken to minimise water loss during the transfer of the shoot to the chamber by enclosing it in a plastic bag immediately after excision (Turner and Long, 1980).
6.3.3.	Gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements
On August 6, 7, 27 and September 10, 2003, leaf gas exchange rates were measured at natural incident photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) in the field using a portable IRGA (ADC-LCA-3, Analytical Development, Hoddesdon, U.K.), operating in the open mode. Diurnal patterns of gas exchange rates were very similar throughout the season, so only the data obtained on September 10 (severe drought period, minimum photosynthesis) are presented. Measurements were performed on 8 well exposed current year leaves (fully expanded, of the same stage of development), during the morning (09.30-10.30 h), midday (13.30-14.30 h) and afternoon (17.30-18.30 h). PPFD was always higher than 10.00-12.00 pmol m-2 s-1 (1450, 1900 and 1520 m-2 s-1 at morning, midday and afternoon, respectively), which is known to be over the saturation point in olive (Natali et al., 1991). The values of vapour pressure deficit in the same periods (VPD) were 2.08, 3.79 and 4.09 kPa, respectively. Net CO2 assimilation rate (A), stomatal conductance (gs) and the ratio of intercellular to atmospheric CO2 concentration (C/C) were estimated from gas exchange measurements using the equations developed by von Caemmerer and Farquhar (1981). Intrinsic water use efficiency was calculated as the ratio of A/gs.
In vivo chlorophyll fluorescence was measured with a portable chlorophyll fluorometer (Plant Stress Meter, BioMonitor SCI AB, Ume§, Sweden) at morning, midday and afternoon on the same leaves used for gas exchange measurements. Prior to the measurements, a small part of the leaves was kept in the dark for 30 min using cuvettes for dark adaptation. A 5-s light pulse at 400 pmol m-2 s-1 was used. Maximum quantum yield of PSII was estimated by the Fv/Fm ratio (Krause and Weis, 1991).
6.3.4.	Photosynthetic pigments, soluble sugars and starch
All metabolic compound analyses were made with leaf discs taken at morning (10.00 h) in the same date of gas exchange measurements from 6 fully expanded leaves of comparable physiological age, thereby eliminating developmental effects. Leaf sections of a known area were ground in 80% acetone for chlorophyll and carotenoid determination. Total chlorophyll (Chla+b) and Chla/Chlb ratio was determined according to Sestak et al (1971) and total carotenoids (Car) according to Lichtenthaler (1987).
Total soluble sugars (SS) were extracted by heating leaf discs in 80% ethanol, according to Irigoyen et al (1992). SS were analysed by the reaction of 200 pL of the alcoholic extract
with 3 ml of fresh anthrone and placed in a boiling water bath for 10 min. After cooling, the absorbance at 625 nm was determined. After the extraction of the soluble fractions, the solid fraction was used for starch analysis. Starch (St) was extracted with 30% perchloric acid, according to Osaki et al (1991). The St concentration was determined by the anthrone method as described above. Glucose was used as a standard for both SS and St.
6.3.5.	Lipid peroxidation
The lipid peroxidation products in olive leaves were estimated following the method of Heath and Packer (1968). More details can be found in Bacelar et al (2006). The total thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) concentration was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 155 x 10 -3 M-1 cm-1 (Costa etal, 2002).
6.3.6.	Total phenol, UV-B absorbing compounds, soluble protein and total thiol
Total phenol concentration (TP) in leaf extracts was determined on the same extract used for pigment analysis, according to the Folin-Ciocalteu's procedure (Singleton and Rossi, 1965).
The ultraviolet-B absorbing compounds (UV-BAC) were extracted by heating leaf discs in 10 ml of methanol:HCl:water (79:1:20 (v/v)) according to Mirecki and Teramura (1984). After centrifugation (3,000 g for 10 min), the supernatant was used for absorbance measurement at 300 nm, peak of maximum absorption.
The amount of soluble protein (SP) was quantified using the method of Bradford (1976). Leaf discs were homogenised in a grinding medium that contained 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 100 pM phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 2% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) (w/v). Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard.
Total thiol content (-SH) of soluble protein extract was assayed according to Ellman (1959), using 5,5'-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB). Absorbance was determined at 412 nm and the -SH concentration was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 13,600 M-1 cm-1 (Ellman, 1959).
6.3.7.	Radical scavenging activity
scavenging activity (RSA) of leaf extracts was measured as a decrease in the absorbance of DPPH at 517 nm and was calculated using the equation: RSA = (1- Asample 517 nm/Acontrol 517 nm) x 100.
6.3.8.	Antioxidant enzymes
Extracts for determination of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC
1.15.1.1)	and guaiacol peroxidase (GPX, EC 1.11.1.7) activities were prepared from leaf discs homogenised with a mortar and pestle in 1.5 ml of ice-cold 50 mM potassium-phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), containing 0.1 mM EDTA and 0.2% PVP (w/v). SOD activity was measured according to the method described by Flohe and Otting (1984) using xanthine-xanthine oxidase system. GPX activity was calculated following the oxidation of guaiacol at 470 nm using an extinction coefficient of 26,600 M-1 cm-1 (Laloue et al., 1997).
All reagents and chemicals used were of the highest grade of purity commercially available.
6.3.9.	Statistics
All data were subjected to an analysis of variance with prior data transformation when required. Proportional data expressed as ratio data were log transformed. Significant different means were separated using the Fisher's LSD test (P &amp;lt;0.05).
6.4.	Results
6.4.1.	Leaf water status and stem water potential
The RWC of T0 was significantly lower than all the other irrigation treatments (Table
6.1)	. Moreover, no significant variation among the treatments was observed in the WCS. Like the RWC, the TPD was significantly lower in T0 plants.

6.4.2.	Gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements
The typical diurnal course of gas exchange rates for the different irrigation treatments is shown in Figure 6.2. The A values measured in the morning period were significantly different among treatments. The highest A was observed in T2 and T3 (19.0 and 18.4 pmol m-2 s-1, respectively) and the lowest in T0 (7.8 pmol m-2 s-1). T1 presented an intermediate photosynthetic rate (15.3 pmol m-2 s-1). Then, a progressive decline in A was observed until midday in all irrigation regimes. Moreover, the importance of water availability in olive photosynthesis is more evident at midday. In fact, at midday A is 594% higher in T3 than in T0 whereas in the morning it was 136% higher. We verify again that the midday A values of T2 are similar to those of T3. On the other hand, A of T1 is now clearly lower than A of T2 and T3, but still higher than A of T0. Furthermore, no recovery of A was observed in the afternoon in all treatments. At this period of the day, the photosynthetic rate of T1 is at the same level of T0.

Columns are means (n = 8) and vertical bars represent the standard error. Measurements of each diurnal period followed by a different letter are significantly different at P &amp;lt;0.05 (LSD test).
The gs exhibited maximal values between 71 (in T0) and 235 (in T3 and T2) mmol m-2 s-1 in the morning, followed by a decline thereafter, in a closely association with the decrease of A (Figure 6.2). The minimum values of gs were obtained at midday, ranging from 22 (in T0) to 140 (in T3) mmol m-2 s-1. Thus, stomatal closure might be one of the factors responsible for the reduction in A. Nevertheless, the relative influence of irrigation on A and gs differed among treatments and changed during the diurnal period. Intrinsic water use efficiency was higher in
T0 in the morning, whereas in the other periods was higher in T1 plants. Interestingly, A/gs decreased along the day in T0 and increased in the other treatments, mainly at midday, in a negative association with the behaviour of C/CC In fact, C/C decreased from morning to midday in T1, T2 and T3 (Figure 6.2). From midday to the afternoon the C/Cs increased considerably in T2 and T3, but did not changed in T1. T0 revealed a different trend of C/Cs. It increased markedly from morning to midday suggesting that non-stomatal limitations are also responsible for the decrease in A in T0 plants.
Daily recordings of Fv/Fm are shown in Figure 6.3. The morning values of Fv/Fm were high (varying between 0.71 and 0.74) and not significantly different across the irrigation treatments. Then, a decline in Fv/Fm was observed at midday, mainly in irrigated plants. Interestingly, a recovery of Fv/Fm was observed in the afternoon in irrigated plants, namely in T2 and T3.

6.4.3.	Lipid peroxidation
The concentrations of TBARS in the leaves of olive trees are shown in Figure 6.4. The TBARS concentration was higher in T0 leaves (12.4 nmol cm-2), showing signs of oxidative damage. Irrigated plants revealed low levels of TBARS. Meanwhile, no significant differences were registered among T1, T2 and T3. For the succeeding assays, only the T0 and T3 treatments were used to explore the effect of irrigation in olive trees.

6.4.4.	Photosynthetic pigments, soluble sugars and starch
The Chl(a+b) amount per unit leaf area and the Chla/Chlb ratio were higher in T3 than in T0 (Table 6.2). However, no differences between treatments were observed in the Car concentration and in Chl/Car ratio. Concerning the SS concentration, no differences between irrigation treatments were observed, but the T3 leaves contained high concentration of St than T0 leaves (Table 6.2), in a straight association with their high A rates (Figure 6.2).

6.4.5.	Total phenol, UV-B absorbing compounds, soluble protein and total thiol
Irrigation had no statistically significant effects on TP and UV-BAC (Table 6.3).
Meanwhile, T0 plants revealed higher SP concentration and lower levels of -SH.
6.4.6.	Radical scavenging activity
The results obtained in the present study clearly demonstrate that olive leaf extracts contain antioxidant compounds, which can effectively scavenge various reactive oxygen species/free radicals under in vitro conditions (Table 6.3). Nevertheless, the antioxidant activity of T3 leaf extract was 31 % higher than in TO extract.
6.4.7.	Antioxidant enzymes
Water availability significantly changed the specific activities of SOD and GPX (Table
6.3). The drought-stressed leaves had 27% lower SOD activity than irrigated plants, whereas GPX was 52% higher.

6.5.	Discussion
The extremely low values of WCS observed (0.97 g H2O g-1 DM in T0) were even lower than those reported by Abd-El-Rahman et al. (1966) and Bacelar et al. (2004), suggesting that the cultivar used in this study had the capacity to withstand arid environments. Meanwhile, we found an increase in RWC from 65 (in T0) to 91% (in T3), which is of particular significance in photosynthesis. The diurnal trends of gs and A in the field-grown olive trees, either irrigated or non-irrigated, followed a typical pattern described for woody Mediterranean vegetation (Fernández and Moreno, 1999; Ogaya and Peñuelas, 2003; Tognetti et al, 2004), with maximum values during the morning hours (Figure 6.2). Over the course of the day, even under irrigation, gs substantially restrict CO2 entry into the leaves, as a result of the interaction of low vapour pressure deficits in the atmosphere with high temperature and solar irradiance. Thus, a decrease in photosynthesis and a cascade of different processes contributing to the protection of chloroplasts may occur. However, irrigation significantly decreased the midday and afternoon depression of A and gs. In fact, T3 plants exhibited by midday decreases of 32 and
41% (in A and gs, respectively) in relation to morning values, as compared to decreases of 77 and 69% observed in TO plants. Similar influence of water availability on A was obtained by Jorba et al (1985) who found that a reduction in RWC from 96 to 65% induced an 85% reduction in photosynthesis of potted olive trees.
The closely association between A and g3 suggests that the decline in net photosynthesis over the course of the day is largely a consequence of stomatal limitation. Since stomatal limitation of photosynthesis is exerted through the control of intercellular CO2 concentration, a decrease in C/C along the day was observed in irrigated plants (Figure 6.2). However, we observed that C/Ca increased markedly from morning to midday in TO, in spite of lower gs, suggesting that non-stomatal limitations to photosynthesis also occur when environmental conditions become more stressful. Similar results were obtained by Giorio et al (1999) in a study with field-grown olive trees under water deficit conditions.
The A/gs of olive plants differed among the irrigation treatments (Figure 6.2). According to Passioura's theory of plant water-use behaviour (1982), T2 and T3, with high gs, high C/Ca and low A/gs, appear to employ a prodigal or non-conservative strategy, whereas TO (at morning) and T1 (at midday and afternoon), with high A/gs, appear to employ a conservative strategy in the use of water. The prodigal water-use behaviour enables a plant to grow quickly and the conservative water-use behaviour is beneficial in conditions where a long dry period prevails, enabling the plant to use the available water efficiently.
The analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence rates reveals that non-stomatal limitations are also responsible for the low of A in TO plants (Figure 6.3). The occurrence of perturbations at chloroplastic level in TO plants is demonstrated by a low Fv/Fm during the afternoon and by a high minimal fluorescence along the day (data not shown). Thus, TO plants had lower maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII and lower absorption efficiency of photons by chlorophyll a in the light-harvesting complex (Giorgieva and Yordanov, 1993).
No alterations occurred in morning values of F/Fm, indicating that the maximal PSII primary photochemistry was not permanently affected by the stressful conditions previously experienced by the trees. At midday, the decrease of F/Fm, mainly in T2 and T3, revealed the occurrence of a dynamic photoinhibition, which seemed to be effective in protecting the photosynthetic apparatus from the high risk of photodamage occasioned by the superimposed stresses to which the plants were subjected under field conditions (Souza et al, 2OO4). Thus, the excessive excitation energy is deflected away from PSII and dissipated harmlessly, primarily as heat (Osmond, 1994). Such down-regulation in T2 and T3 leaves may be the response to
excessive radiation. Down-regulation of photochemical efficiency around midday has also been shown in Quercus suber trees under field conditions (Faria et al, 1996).
Interestingly, T0 plants were able to maintain a similar amount of leaf SS as in T3 plants (Table 6.2), in spite of the low A (Figure 6.2), at the expenses of leaf starch, which drastically decreased. This may be linked to their ability to perform tissue osmotic adjustment, as observed in potted olive trees (Bacelar et al, 2006). In fact, upon exposure to drought and extreme temperatures, plants accumulate osmotic compounds including soluble sugars, amino acids like proline, aspartic and glutamic acid, methylated quaternary ammonium compounds (e.g. glycine betaine and alanine betaine), hydrophilic proteins (e.g. late embryogenesis abundant, LEA) and cycitols (e.g. pinitol, manitol) (Chaves et al, 2003). One of the main sources of these osmolytes is the starch reserves (Amundson et al., 1993), which supply hydrolyzed sugars.
As photosynthesis decreased under water stress, an excess of reducing power is frequently generated and, thus, over-reduction of photosynthetic electron chain may result in the formation of ROS that can cause oxidative damage. In fact, leaves grown under rainfed conditions revealed signs of oxidative stress. One sign was the large reduction (14%) in leaf Chl(a+b) (Table 6.2). According to Smirnoff (1993), the decrease of chlorophyll content (chlorophyll bleaching) is a typical symptom of oxidative stress and may be the result of chlorophyll degradation or be due to chlorophyll synthesis deficiency together with changes of thylakoid membrane structure. Bussis et al. (1998) indicated that expanded leaves exposed to water deficit started to degrade their photosynthetic apparatus, possibly to mobilise resources for the production of new acclimated leaves. Furthermore, the higher Chla/Chlb ratio in T3 than in T0 plants (Table 6.2) reflects the relative increase of the chlorophyll a containing reaction centre complexes at the expense of the light harvesting chlorophyll a/b proteins (Evans, 1993).
Another sign of oxidative stress in T0 leaves was the increased levels (57%) of lipid peroxidation (Figure 6.4). Several studies have been shown lipid peroxidation in water-deficit conditions, including studies with Olea europea L. plants (Sofo et al., 2004; Bacelar et al., 2006). Lipid peroxidation is a natural metabolic process under normal aerobic conditions and is one of the most investigated ROS actions on membrane structure and function (Blokhina et al.,
2003). It is widely reported that ROS bring about peroxidation of membrane lipids leading to membrane damage (Shalata and Tal, 1998). Considering the TBARS concentration as a biochemical marker for the ROS mediated injury, results suggest that irrigation reduces drastically the oxidative damage on cell membranes by lipid peroxidation, validating our working hypothesis.
Meanwhile, in our study, TO plants showed a lower -SH concentration (Table 6.3), probably due to the oxidation of non-proteic -SH groups. Oxidative stress depletion on non-proteic thiols in TO enhances the susceptibility to membrane damage by TBARS and may trigger ROS irreversible negative effects on cellular function (Ali et al, 2005). In opposition, T3 plants revealed a high level of -SH compounds (e.g. glutathione) that may function as reducers of oxidative damage (Ali etal, 2005).
According to the DPPH test, the highest antioxidant potential was observed in T3 leaf extract (Table 6.3), reflecting their low susceptibility to oxidation. Similar results were focused by Marron et al (2002) in a Populus x euramericana clone. Antioxidants play an important role delaying or preventing the oxidation of cellular oxidable substrates (Singh and Rajini, 2004). They exert their effects by scavenging ROS, activating a battery of detoxifying proteins, or preventing the generation of ROS (Halliwell et al, 1992). Natural antioxidants constitute a broad range of compounds including phenolic compounds, nitrogen compounds and carotenoids (Velioglu et al, 1998). Olive leaves are rich in phenols, such as oleuropein, verbascoside, ligstroside, tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol, which have exhibited antioxidant and antimicrobial properties (Caturla et al, 2005). However, Yu et al (2002) claim that there is no correlation between the TP and the radical scavenging capacity. Our results support this claim. In fact, the TP concentration was similar in T0 and T3 leaves (Table 6.3).
Interestingly, T0 plants revealed higher SP concentration (69%) than T3 plants (Table
6.3). Changes in soluble protein concentration are important to understand the impact of stress on cell proteolysis and protein synthesis (Santos and Caldeira, 1999). During drought periods, plants undergo many physiological changes and induce a large number of genes for adaptation (Ingram and Bartels, 1996). Under water-deficit conditions, a typical change in gene expression is the induction of genes involved in the synthesis of various osmolytes and low-molecular-weight proteins, e.g. dehydrins and late embryogenic-abundant proteins (Ingram and Bartels, 1996). The accumulation of leaf proteins under water deficit may also represent a reserve of nitrogen to be used during the recovery after summer drought (Millard, 1988).
Under mild and/or moderate drought stress some adapted species exhibit increases in activities of antioxidant enzymes, such as SOD and peroxidase (Lima et al, 2002; Liang et al, 2003). However, severe drought stress may cause damage to cells by inducing active oxygen production or by disrupting the scavenging systems that quench active oxygen and eliminate the detrimental effects (Van Breusegem et al, 1998). In our study, the decline in SOD activity in T0 plants (Table 6.3) indicated that the scavenging function of SOD was impaired, which would favor the accumulation of O2-. Similar results were achieved in water-stressed Norway
spruce (KronfuP et al., 1998) and in maritime pine and pendunculate oak (Schwanz et al, 1996). Meanwhile, the finding that GPX activity increased in rainfed plants (Table 3), associated with the appearance of oxidative damage, suggests that this enzyme has no major antioxidative function in olive as in chieves (Egert and Tevini, 2002), which is consistent with Asada's classification of peroxidases (Asada, 1992) into 'antioxidatively and 'physiologically (e.g. during the synthesis of lignin) function ones. In fact, the increased peroxidase activity was reported in water-stressed marigold (Tagetes erecta L.), accompanying with increased lignin concentration (Kurup et al, 1994).
In conclusion, results fit well with the hypotheses presented. All irrigation levels improved carbon assimilation of field-grown olive trees and protected the photosynthetic apparatus by down-regulation of photochemical efficiency around midday. Furthermore, irrigation enhanced antioxidant protection and decreased the oxidative damage at leaf level. Additionally, results demonstrated that olive trees irrigated with 30% of the estimated local evaporative demand had high A/gs at midday and afternoon, saving consistent amounts of water and revealing an RWC similar to T2 and T3 trees. Moreover, this level of irrigation seemed to be sufficient to reduce oxidative damage at leaf level. This is an interesting result since a sagacious irrigation approach is essential for viable olive industry due to the limited water resources available in the Mediterranean region. Further studies are needed to compare the effects of different irrigation levels in terms of productivity and oil quality.

GENERAL CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES OF FUTURE RESEARCH
7.	GENERAL CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES OF FUTURE RESEARCH
This chapter presents the general conclusions from the research work that was undertaken, highlighting the most important research contributions of the thesis, which correspond to its main objectives, and indicates some directions for future research.
7.1.	General conclusions
Field and glasshouse experiments showed that olive plants possess important drought resistance mechanisms. However, considerable variation exists within the studied cultivars. In the first experiment we compared, under field conditions, the olive tree cultivars most commonly grown in Trás-os-Montes for oil and table fruit consumption (Cobrangosa and Negrinha, respectively) with foreign cultivars (Arbequina, Blanqueta and Manzanilla) with the objective of identifying the morpho-anatomical, physiological and biochemical adaptations that enable olive trees to cope with summer stress (chapters 2 and 3). It was demonstrated that olive cultivars native to dry regions, such as Cobrangosa, Negrinha, and the Spanish Manzanilla, have more capability to acclimate to drought conditions than cultivars originated in regions with a more temperate climate, like Arbequina and Blanqueta. Although the leaves of all cultivars are anatomically adapted to the high-light regimes of the region, Cobrangosa, Manzanilla and Negrinha have more morphological and structural leaf adaptations against water loss (chapter
2). Adaptation was effected by an increase in sclerophylly. Cobrangosa exhibited good protection against water loss as a result of the high density of foliar tissue and the presence of the thick cuticle and trichome layers, and Manzanilla and Negrinha enhanced their sclerophylly by building parenchymatous tissues and increasing protective structures like the upper cuticle (Negrinha) and both the upper and lower epidermis (Manzanilla). Another important mechanism employed by the olive trees to avoid drought is stomatal closure (chapter 3). Stomatal control of water loss was identified as an early response of all olive cultivars to water deficit, leading to limitation of carbon uptake by the leaves. However, the degree of midday depression of photosynthesis was genotype dependent, with a maximum in Arbequina and a minimum in Negrinha. Non-stomatal factors also play an important role in limiting photosynthesis when olive cultivars are submitted to prolonged drought under field conditions. This was more evident in Blanqueta that had an almost constant ratio of intercellular to atmospheric CO2 concentration from midday to afternoon, despite the reduction of stomatal conductance. It was found evidence for the feed-forward hypothesis for stomatal closure in Arbequina in response to air drought, because there was a decrease of transpiration rate at high vapour pressure deficit (i.e.
at midday). Finally, the accumulation of proline in the leaves of all cultivars, but mainly in Manzanilla, indicates a possible role of proline in O. europaea drought tolerance.
In a subsequent study, a glasshouse experiment was conducted to investigate the immediate responses and the adaptative strategies of one-year-old plants of three Portuguese O europaea cultivars (Cobrangosa, Madural and Verdeal Transmontana, the more representative in Trás-os-Montes) to different water supply during the dry season, and to evaluate the symptoms of oxidative stress induced by low water availability (chapters 4 and 5). Water stress affected growth and biomass accumulation of O europaea cultivars and young olive plants responded to water stress by developing avoidance mechanisms based on stomatal closure, changes in xylem hydraulic properties and reduction in the canopy area (chapter 4). The drop of relative growth rate in olive water-stressed plants was associated with decreases of net assimilation rate and leaf area per unit of total plant biomass (LAR). Moreover, the lower LAR was accomplished by allocating relatively less biomass to leaves (leaf weight ratio) and by producing leaves of high tissue density that would decrease leaf area per unit leaf mass, that provided less surface area and, therefore, lower light harvesting capability per unit of investment in leaf mass. An exception to this behaviour was presented by Verdeal Transmontana plants, which had a tendency to higher LAR under low water availability, as a result of increased expansion of younger leaves. Under water stress, total leaf area was sharply reduced in all cultivars due to a combination of leaf growth reduction and shedding of older leaves. Another important finding was that in all cultivars, water stress induced an increase in xylem vessel frequency, providing a greater vascular potential and a greater security of xylem sap conduction under drought conditions. Under water stress conditions, Cobrangosa plants were able to maintain the same level of protection against cavitation and to turn more efficient the water transport through the xylem, seeming to reveal a trade-off between safety (low vulnerability to cavitation) and efficiency (large hydraulic conductivity). Anatomically, Cobrangosa and Madural revealed to be more capable than Verdeal Transmontana to cope with low water availability (chapter 5). Cobrangosa and Madural also showed greater capability for osmotic adjustment and increased tissue rigidity under low water conditions (chapter 5). By contrast, Verdeal Transmontana did not exhibit osmotic adjustment, but was able to increase tissue elasticity and total soluble protein concentration. Leaves grown under low water conditions revealed signs of oxidative stress (chapter 5), with decreases in chlorophyll, carotenoid and total thiol concentrations and increased levels of lipid peroxidation. Nevertheless, plants growing with low water availability developed some defence mechanisms against oxidative stress, like the increase in total phenol and total soluble protein
concentrations. The increased levels of lipid peroxidation and the decreased total thiol concentration under low water conditions suggest that the mechanisms against oxidative stress were less effective in Madural. From the behaviour of Cobrangosa plants, with a higher allocation of assimilates to stems, at the expense of allocation to leaves, a smaller reduction in net assimilation rate, a more efficient water transport through the xylem, an enhanced water use efficiency of biomass production under low water availability, and more protection against oxidative stress, we consider this cultivar very promising for cultivation in semi-arid areas.
The third experiment studied the influence of different irrigation regimes on the physiological behaviour of mature olive trees (cv. Cobrangosa) growing in commercial-like field conditions and analysed the damages caused by oxidative stress and the antioxidative protection at leaf level in irrigated and non-irrigated trees (Chapter 6). It is important to underline the fact that, although the previous experiments had revealed that Cobrangosa have important drought resistance mechanisms, all irrigation levels improved carbon assimilation of olive trees and reduced the midday and afternoon depression of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance. The experiment also revealed the occurrence of a dynamic photoinhibition in irrigated trees, mainly in trees irrigated with 60 and 100% of the estimated local evaporative demand, which seemed to be effective in protecting the photosynthetic apparatus from photodamage. Leaves grown under rainfed conditions revealed symptoms of oxidative stress, like the reduction in chlorophyll concentration and the increased levels of lipid peroxidation. We also found that the scavenging function of superoxide dismutase was impaired in rainfed plants. In contrast, the low thiobarbituric acid reactive substances concentration in irrigated trees indicates that irrigation decreases the oxidative damage by lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, we concluded that irrigation enhanced antioxidant protection at leaf level since leaves of irrigated trees had high levels of -SH compounds and the highest antioxidant potential. Meanwhile, the finding that guaiacol peroxidase activity increased in rainfed plants, associated with the appearance of oxidative damage, suggests that this enzyme has no major antioxidative function in olive. Additionally, this experiment demonstrated that olive trees irrigated with 30% of the estimated local evaporative demand had high intrinsic water use efficiency at midday and afternoon, saving consistent amounts of water and revealing a relative water content similar to trees irrigated with high amounts of water. Moreover, this level of irrigation seemed to be sufficient to reduce oxidative damage at leaf level. This is an important finding since a sagacious irrigation approach is essential for viable olive industry due to the limited water resources available in the Mediterranean region.
7.2.	Perspectives of future research
This thesis provided background information from which several areas of future research could be developed. Potential future research directions are:
The application of regulated deficit irrigation strategies to olive tree
Deficit irrigation is a very important management tool to cope with scarce water supplies and to maximize water use efficiency. There are several deficit irrigation experiences in many areas that could orient future research in this field. One approach is that of regulated deficit irrigation (RDI), currently under consideration for widespread use in some tree crops. The ecophysiological effects of RDI strategies applied to O. europaea cultivars and the effects in terms of productivity and oil quality are interesting topics for future research.
The effects of partial root drying applied to olive tree
The underlying theory that root signals from the dry part of the root system close stomata and reduce transpiration at high plant water status is physiologically attractive but the critical experiments required to test the hypothesis have yet to be made. The nature of the signal or signals involved in the olive's stress signalling system could be the topics for new lines of research.
The use of saline water or treated wastewater for irrigating olive tree
Global change will definitely introduce changes in agricultural ecosystems. Olive trees will have to grow in a hotter, drier and, in some cases, more saline environment. In order to overcome water shortages and to satisfy the increasing water demand for agricultural development, the use of water of low quality, such as recycled, brackish and drainage waters, is becoming important in many countries. The use of saline water or treated wastewater for irrigating olive trees are interesting options.
The interactions between drought and other abiotic and biotic stresses in olive tree
Future investigation in this area will enlarge the knowledge about the reaction mechanisms of olive plants imposed to different unfavourable conditions. Cross-adaptation or synergism will be revealed and the specificity of the multiple-stress interaction will be better elucidated. For example, will olive plants be better able to tolerate drought under future enhanced CO2 conditions? Such information will open new possibilities for improvement of O. europaea.
Molecular biology and biochemistry level studies
A sizable amount of cross-disciplinary research work is still required. Plant genomics and proteomics are radically improving our understanding of plant response to drought. With modern molecular research tools it becomes fairly straightforward to reveal hundreds of genes that are up regulated or down regulated in response to plant tissue water loss. However, research into the function of most of these genes is not as developed. Subsequently, the exact function at the whole plant level of the found gene responses to cellular water deficit is not well understood to the extent that they can be used in plant breeding.
Knowledge transfer
It is imperative that the research effort is linked to an effective programme of education and knowledge transfer to ensure that the benefits are rapidly and effectively transmitted to the olive industry.</field>
