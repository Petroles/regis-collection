ABSTRACT 

The focus of this work is to use reservoir engineering data from numerical flow simulation 

to improve the quantitative interpretation of 4D seismic signals. The idea is to use engineering 

knowledge to minimize possible incorrect information provided by 4D seismic before using it to 

update reservoir simulation models in a history matching procedure. In this work the integration 

between the two dataset is done in the pressure and saturation domain. So, the first part of the 

work presents a methodology to estimate pressure and saturation changes from 4D seismic 

through a petro-elastic inversion procedure. This procedure can be seen as a tool to apply the 

integration methodology of the second part which is one of the main contributions of this work. 

The integration methodology uses multiple simulation models to constrain the estimation of 

pressure and saturation from 4D seismic. As a result, less noisy maps were obtained, allowing a 

better interpretation of the reservoir changes. Following the traditional sequence, the estimated 

saturation map is then used as input to the history matching process presented in the third part of 

the work. It was shown that the history matching procedure provides better results if the input 

data, in this case the saturation map, respects the expected mass balance, which was not the case 

for the dataset considered. Thus, a methodology to calibrate the volume of injected water 

associated to the saturation map provided by 4D seismic is presented in the last part of the work, 

which is another important contribution to be highlighted. To better control the results of all the 

methodologies here presented, a synthetic dataset was used in the entire work. Although 

satisfactory results were observed for this dataset, it is important to highlight that the main 

contributions of this work are not only the results, but the methodologies proposed, that present 

an innovative perspective for 4D seismic and reservoir engineering data integration. 

Keywords: 4D seismic; reservoir simulation; history matching; time-lapse seismic 

integration.

RESUMO 

O foco deste trabalho é usar dados de engenharia de reservatórios gerados através da 

simulação de fluxos para melhorar a interpretação quantitativa da sísmica 4D. A ideia é usar os 

conhecimentos de engenharia para minimizar possíveis informações incorretas geradas pela 

sísmica 4D, antes de usá-la para atualizar modelos de simulação de reservatórios em um 

procedimento de ajuste de histórico. Neste trabalho a integração entre estes dois conjuntos de 

dados é feita no domínio da pressão e saturação. Dessa forma, a primeira parte do trabalho 

apresenta uma metodologia para estimar variações de pressão e saturação a partir da sísmica 4D 

através de um procedimento de inversão petro-elástica. Este procedimento pode ser visto como 

uma ferramenta para aplicar a metodologia de integração da segunda parte, que é uma das 

principais contribuições deste trabalho. A metodologia de integração usa múltiplos modelos de 

simulação para restringir a estimativa de pressão e saturação a partir da sísmica 4D. Como 

resultado, observaram-se mapas menos ruidosos que permitem, portanto, uma melhor 

interpretação das variações ocorridas no reservatório. Seguindo a sequencia tradicional de 

trabalho, o mapa de saturação estimado foi então usado como dado de entrada em um processo de 

ajuste de histórico apresentado na terceira parte da tese. Foi mostrado que o procedimento de 

ajuste gera melhores resultados quando o dado de entrada, neste caso mapa de saturação, respeita 

o balanço de massa, o que não acontecia para os dados considerados. Assim, uma metodologia 

para calibrar o volume de água injetada associado ao mapa de saturação gerado pela sísmica 4D é 

apresentada na última parte do trabalho, que é outra contribuição importante a se destacar. Para 

melhor controlar os resultados de todas as metodologias aqui apresentadas foram usados dados 

sintéticos em todo o trabalho. Embora resultados satisfatórios tenham sido observados para este 

conjunto de dados, é importante destacar que as principais contribuições deste trabalho não são 

apenas os resultados observados, mas as metodologias propostas, que apresentam uma 

perspectiva inovadora para integração entre dados de sísmica 4D e engenharia de reservatórios.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Reservoir simulation is one of the main tools used for dynamic reservoir characterization 

and management. Thus, one of the principal tasks of geoscientists and reservoir engineers is to 

build reliable models, which is not an easy task due to the complexity present in this kind of 

problem. The complexity comes mainly from the lack of geological information required to build 

such models. The confidence in the simulation models can be improved by incorporating 

dynamic data in a history matching procedure.  

Traditional history matching procedures use well information such as pressure, oil, water 

and gas rates, to update the static model properties such as permeability, porosity, faults 

transmissibility and so on. The use of well data is generally insufficient to give confidence to 

simulation models because the process is an inverse and ill-posed problem.    

The use of time-lapse seismic (also called 4D seismic) in history matching procedures is 

relatively new, but has become increasingly common in the recent years. The main contribution 

that this data brings is the areal information regarding the dynamic properties variations (such as 

pressure and saturation changes) observed due to production. Thus, instead of having only 

production profiles at very few points in the reservoir (well locations), spatial variations of 

dynamic properties also become accessible. This type of information can be used to update 

reservoir models in several ways, from qualitative interpretation, which helps to better map the 

uncertainties, to quantitative incorporation of seismic information inside the objective function 

(that measures the quality of the matching) of a history matching procedure. Another issue to be 

considered when 4D seismic is used to update reservoir models, is which seismic attribute should 

be used. In general, there are three possibilities (Figure 1): (1) time-lapse seismic can be 

incorporated into the history matching in its original domain, i.e., in the form of seismic 

amplitudes; (2) it can be inverted to seismic impedances; and (3) it can be converted to pressure 

and saturation data. Although there are several works in the literature proposing different 

methodologies to integrate 4D seismic in the history matching, there is not a standard procedure 

to follow concerning the optimization algorithm to use, or the choice of the integration domain. 

     1



Usually the procedure for integrating 4D seismic data and reservoir information can be 

split into two independent steps: the first is related to the efforts of geophysicists to manipulate 

4D seismic data and interpret the changes of reservoir properties and the second is the engineer 

driven process of including this new information in the reservoir simulation model (by running a 

history matching procedure, for instance).   

This work is based on the idea that the integration between 4D seismic and simulation 

data should be done not only by following the traditional sequence, where 4D seismic is an input 

for a history matching. The idea is to use engineering knowledge to minimize possible incorrect 

information provided by 4D seismic before adding it to the matching procedure. Thus, this work 

proposes two methodologies that use simulation results to condition the estimation of dynamic 

properties from 4D, which are later used in a history matching procedure.   

All of this work was developed to perform the integration between the two datasets in the 

pressure and saturation domain (Figure 1). The reason for working in this domain is determined 

by the fact that the values of these physical quantities can be controlled better than the elastic 

properties of rock (such as impedance); i.e., it is easier to establish feasible limits of pressure and 

saturation for a given production scenario than it is to determine corresponding limits of 

impedances. Thus, working in this domain allows a clear view of the methodologies presented 

here.  

Thereby, this thesis is structured in four papers (figure 2), the first of which describes the 

4D inversion procedure proposed to estimate pressure and saturation from time-lapse seismic. 

The second paper proposes the first methodology of integration that uses reservoir simulation 

results to constrain the estimation of pressure and saturation maps to flow conditions. The third 

paper then proposes a history matching procedure that uses the previously estimated saturation 

map to perform a local history matching. Due to noise in seismic data and errors in the 

characterization of static properties, the estimated saturation map shown in paper 2 presented a 

volume of injected water larger than the expected. Thus, in the fourth and last paper, its effects on 

the history matching results of paper 3 are discussed and a methodology to calibrate the volume 

of water is proposed.

1.1. Motivation 

The motivation of this work is to generate more reliable reservoir models by improving 

the integration between reservoir simulation and 4D seismic. Since reservoir simulation models 

     3



can be seen as one of the main tools for reservoir management, the accuracy of these models is 

directly related to more efficient field operations and better financial return. 

1.2. Objective 

The objective of this work is to develop a methodology that uses reservoir behavior 

prediction from a flow simulator to improve the quantitative interpretation of 4D seismic data. 

Thus, the work proposes a quantitative integration that allows the estimation of dynamic 

properties from 4D signals, in agreement with information available from engineering data such 

as simulation results and volume of injected water. The goal is to generate a more reliable 

quantitative interpretation of 4D seismic, to be used as input to update reservoir simulation 

models, achieving a safer model updating when performing a history matching. 

1.3. Premises 

• In order to verify the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed methodologies, all the 

work was developed using synthetic data. Two simulation models were considered, 

called base and reference models. The base model represents the available knowledge 

of the reservoir, so it has a lack of information on the static properties (uncertainties). 

The reference model represents the true earth model, namely the answer that all the 

processes aim to reach. 

• The synthetic seismic data considered in this work are P and S impedances, which are 

generated by running a petro-elastic model with the reference model properties and 

scale. Some noise was added to the impedances in order to mimic real problems (more 

details in paper 2). No seismic amplitudes were generated so no kind of elastic 

inversion was run. 

• All data are at the same scale. All the simulation models considered in this work and 

seismic data were created at the same grid (110 x 90 x 5 blocks).  

• As the seismic data (P and S impedances) are at the reservoir scale, they have 5 layers. 

So, when the term “map information” is used, it can be interpreted as volume, or five 

maps information (one for each layer). 

     4



• The base survey of the 4D seismic is considered to be acquired before production starts, 

so the dynamic properties of the reservoir (pressure and saturation) are considered to be 

known at the initial time (it has no uncertainties). 

• No presence of gas (waterflood example above bubble pressure). 

• Case studied: sandstone reservoir. 

• The dynamic properties considered in this work are pressure and water saturation. 

1.4. Description of the work  

This thesis is structured in four scientific papers. This section presents a summary of each 

paper, highlighting the main contributions and how they are connected in the building of the 

whole thesis. The thesis also comprises three appendixes with complementary analyses and 

results of the papers; the relations between the papers and the appendixes are described in this 

section as well.  

The papers in full extension are presented in the following chapters. 

1.4.1. Paper 1: “Pressure and saturation estimation from P and S impedances: a 
theoretical study” 

Alessandra Davolio, Célio Maschio, Denis José Schiozer 
Journal of Geophysics and Engineering, August 2012, v.9, p.447-460 

 
The first paper of this work presents a theoretical study of the proposed petro-elastic 

inversion process, which estimates pressure and saturation from time-lapse seismic. The 

estimation is achieved by an optimization procedure solved by a gradient-type method. As stated 

in the premises, this work considers synthetic data so, this paper presents a discussion that starts 

with an ideal dataset (free of error or noise) to explain the necessity of using two seismic 

attributes (P and S impedances). Then, some uncertainties in the static properties and errors in the 

seismic data were gradually considered and the inversion behavior was analyzed. When 

errors/uncertainties were considered, it was possible to verify the importance of using a 4D 

approach in the inversion scheme instead of a 3D inversion. The main goal of this paper is to 

better understand the inversion itself and the robustness and confidence of the optimization 

algorithm used; hence, it presents discussions on the objective function behavior, initial guess and 

     5



uniqueness of solution. To be able to visualize these issues, all the results presented are related to 

single reservoir blocks. This is possible because the inversion is run independently for each grid 

block.  

The main contribution of this paper to the thesis is the implementation of a 4D inversion 

algorithm to obtain pressure and saturation from time-lapse seismic and the understanding of its 

advantages and limitations.   

Appendix A presents some complementary results from paper 1. The same issues 

discussed in paper 1 for a single reservoir location are presented in Appendix A for an entire 

reservoir model so that the inversion results can be analyzed for different combinations of static 

and dynamic properties (namely different reservoir locations). The results presented in Appendix 

A were extracted from the work of Davolio et al (2011), which is attached at the end of the same 

appendix.  

1.4.2. Paper 2: “A methodology to constrain pressure and saturation estimation from 
4D seismic using multiple simulation models and observed data” 

Alessandra Davolio, Célio Maschio, Denis José Schiozer 
Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, April 2013, v. 105, p. 51-61 
Presented at SEG/SPE/AAPG Workshop “New advances in integrated reservoir 
surveillance”, California, 24-29 June 2012  
 

This paper proposes a methodology to constrain the inversion process presented in paper 1 

to flow conditions. It is well known that seismic data carry errors due to a number of causes, from 

the acquisition methods to specific data processing procedures that can yield wrong reservoir data 

estimation. The central idea of the proposed methodology is that before using 4D seismic data in 

a history matching process, especially quantitatively, this data can be conditioned to some known 

engineering information. As in any optimization process, the solution space of the proposed 

inversion procedure can be constrained by known limits. For instance, in our case, they could be 

considered as general constraints of water saturation, connate water and one minus the residual 

oil saturation. But, instead of using these general values, the methodology proposes to extract 

minimum and maximum values for saturation and pressure from the simulation of multiple 

reservoir models. The multiple models are generated through the combination of the most 

important reservoir attributes, mapped as uncertainties. So, the limits imposed to the 4D seismic 

     6



are derived from the knowledge available at the current stage of the characterization process. The 

results presented show that the dynamic properties estimated through these constraints are less 

noisy and have more confidence to be further applied qualitatively or quantitatively in a history 

matching procedure. The main contribution of this work is the proposed methodology that allows 

checking the information extracted from 4D seismic to verify that it is in agreement with the 

uncertainties mapped in the characterization process. 

1.4.3. Paper 3: “Local history matching using 4D seismic data and multiple models 
combination” 

Alessandra Davolio, Célio Maschio, Denis José Schiozer 
Presented at the EAGE/SPE Europec Annual Conference &amp;amp; Exhibition, London, United 
Kingdom, 10–13 June 2013 
 
The third paper proposes a history matching methodology that uses the water saturation 

distribution obtained from 4D seismic data (resulting from paper 2) to update local properties. 

The idea behind the process is the use of saturation changes estimated from 4D seismic as local 

information for each injector well. The procedure proposed uses several model realizations as 

input, which are the same as those used in paper 2. The updating step is then made by a “copy 

and paste” procedure of the grid properties, such as porosity and permeability that are represented 

by geostatistical images. Then, the methodology replaces the base model properties with those 

extracted from the best model chosen for each region. The results showed that the updated model 

yielded a saturation map that is closer to the one observed from seismic. Thus, the main 

contribution of this paper is an easy-to- implement procedure that generates an updated model 

that reproduces the changes observed in 4D seismic and presents updated properties with 

geological aspects. So, it can be seen as an alternative to the sophisticated algorithms that 

incorporate geostatistical images in the history matching process. 

The results of paper 2 are maps of saturation and pressure, so, for the dataset considered 

in this work, both maps would be available to perform the history matching. However, as 

presented in Appendix B, a satisfactory pressure map was achieved after a calibration of the 

global reservoir properties, which justifies the use of only the saturation map in the history 

matching presented in paper 3. See Appendix B for more details on pressure behavior.

1.4.4. Paper 4: “A methodology to calibrate water saturation estimated from 4D 
seismic” 

Alessandra Davolio, Célio Maschio, Denis José Schiozer 
To be submitted to a journal 
 

Although the local history matching proposed in paper 3 yielded an updated model that 

better follows the map provided by 4D seismic, this model presents more injected water than it 

should. The increase in the amount of injected water in the updated model was caused by the 

saturation map used as input in the matching procedure, since the volume of injected water 

associated to this saturation map was larger than the known injected volume (due to errors during 

the inversion caused by noise in seismic data and errors in the static properties). Thus, the 

updating process (local history matching procedure) is working properly, but the input parameter 

for this process needs to be calibrated so that the matching process yields a more reliable updated 

model. In this sense, this last paper presents a methodology to calibrate the volume of injected 

water presented in the estimated saturation map. This methodology can be seen as an extension of 

the methodology proposed in paper 2.  

Paper 4 presents a discussion concerning the improvement in the estimated saturation 

map, followed by a comparison of the history matching results when different saturation maps are 

used as input (with and without the calibration).  

The main contribution of this paper is to show the importance of having a better 

estimation of saturation changes from 4D seismic to update reservoir models. 

There are some complementary results regarding this paper in Appendix C, which include 

an analysis of how the methodologies of papers 2 and 4 improve the optimization response and 

the well curves after applying the history matching.

Abstract

This work represents the first step of a study to integrate time lapse seismic and reservoir

engineering data where a petro-elastic inversion from seismic data to pressure and saturation is

presented. This inversion is made through an optimization procedure. In order to better

understand and validate the initial step of the methodology, synthetic data (initially free of

noise and errors) have been used. Through this ideal set of data, it was possible to show that

pressure and saturation can be extracted from P and S impedances using only one seismic

survey (3D inversion). It is also shown that this 3D approach is not robust when errors are

assumed in reservoir data and it fails when, for instance, uncertainty in porosity data occurs.

Thus, an improvement is made and the algorithm is rewritten based on 4D differences that

diminish the wrong reservoir data effect. For both algorithms (3D and 4D), we have presented

a discussion of the objective function behaviour concerning the use of P and S impedances

simultaneously, the initial guess and the solution space. A sensitivity analysis discussing the

influence of porosity and the dynamic properties on P and S impedances for 3D and 4D

approaches is also presented. After understanding the inversion process behaviour for an ideal

data set, an analysis of its results assuming different combinations of pressure and saturation

variations and including some errors in the data set used is presented in the last subsections.

1. Introduction

The use of time lapse seismic data to improve reservoir

simulation models is becoming more frequent. The spatially

dense information that comes from 4D seismic data

complements well production data, helping in the reservoir

model calibration. Tuttle et al (2009) and Castro et al (2009)

have shown successful integration of these two sets of data.

Therearedifferentdomainswherethis integrationcanbedone.

In the amplitude (or impedance) domain, for instance, the

reservoir simulation data are converted to seismic attributes

through forward modelling and these synthetic seismic data

are matched with the acquired seismic data (Dadashpour et al

2009, Fahimuddin et al 2010). Another way to perform the

integration is by converting 4D seismic data into pressure and

saturation and matching them with simulated values (Souza

et al 2011). The last is a more complex procedure and there

is no standard process to extract pressure and saturation from

seismic data.

The selection of the inversion process and the seismic

attributes to be used to obtain pressure and saturation

information are not well established in the literature.

Dadashpour et al (2008) presented a nonlinear inversion

scheme that estimates pressure and saturation from synthetic

zero offset seismic data. The work presented by Souza

et al (2010) has shown the difficulty of obtaining this

dynamic information fromonesetof seismicdata (anacoustic

impedancevolume),mainlybecauseoftheproblemofmultiple

answers present in this inversion problem. One way to handle

this is to add another seismic attribute into the process that

has a different response to the dynamic property changes.

Severalworkscombinedifferentsetsofseismicdata torecover

pressure and saturation information. Tura and Lumley (1999)

showed that it is possible to estimate changes in pressure

and saturation through IP and IS (P and S seismic-derived

impedances). Landro (2001) defined a methodology based on

time lapse difference of intercept and gradient to differentiate

pressureandsaturationeffects from4Dseismicdata.MacBeth

et al (2006)alsoproposedamethodology to identifypressure

and saturation changes using time lapse seismic data; their

methodology is able to use any kind of seismic attributes (two

or more) since they have a different response to pressure and

saturation changes.

In the work of Tura and Lumley (1999), the estimation

of the dynamic properties from 4D seismic data is done

through a crossplot of the attributes. The procedure consists

of first identifying regions (through forward modelling) in the

crossplot of IP and IS that correspond to three production

scenarios: (1) only saturation changes, (2) only pressure

changes and (3) saturation and pressure changes. Then the

seismic impedance values are mapped according to these

regions and consequently classified as one of the three

scenariosmentioned.Themethodologyproposed in thiswork,

whichwillbebetterdetailedinthefollowingsections,alsouses

IP and IS to estimate the dynamic property variation but the

estimation is done through an optimization process, aiming to

quantify the results obtained.

This work represents the first steps of a theoretical study

that aims to convert seismic data into pressure and saturation

valuestobeincorporatedinahistorymatchingprocessthrough

a feedback loop in a future work. It is known that this

conversion isnotasimpleproceduresince it is subject tomany

sources of errors like different scale data, noise, uncertainty

in the static properties, etc. So, here we are proposing an

initial study that starts from an ideal set of data, free of any

kind of error, in order to validate and verify the limitations

of the inversion procedure. Thus, a discussion is presented

concerning the simultaneoususeof P and S impedances in the

objective function, the possibility of using only one seismic

vintage and the necessity of using time lapse seismic data to

estimatepressureandsaturation.Then,afterunderstandingthe

inversion behaviour, some results are presented concerning

different scenarios of production, i.e. different time lapse

variation of pressure and saturation and also when a non-ideal

dataset isassumedbyincludingsomeuncertaintiesanderrors.

2. Synthetic seismic data

2.1. Petro-elastic modelling (PEM)

Theinversionalgorithmisbasedonanoptimizationprocedure

where the differences between the seismic attributes and

the simulation-derived seismic attributes are minimized. To

generate seismic attributes from simulation data, a PEM,

which is a set of relationships that relate fluid/rock and elastic

properties, is required. The seismic attributes that are used

in the inversion are compressional and shear impedances,

called here IP and IS, respectively. Considering ?, Vp and

Vs as the density, compressional and shear wave velocities of

the medium, the impedances can be written as

IP = Vp?, (1)

IS = Vs?. (2)

Seismic velocities depend on rock-saturated bulk (Ksat) and

shear (µsat) moduli according to the equations

The medium density can be written as

where ? is the porosity, ?min is the mineral density and ?fl is

the fluid density which is defined according to the equation

?fl = ?oSo + ?wSw (6)

where S is the saturation and the subscripts stand for oil and

water.

The most used approach to determine the rock-saturated

bulk and shear moduli are the Gassmann equations that are

described as follows (Avseth et al 2005):

where Kdry, Kmin and Kfl are the bulk moduli of the rock

frame, the mineral and the fluid mixture. µdry and µsat are

the shear moduli of the dry rock and the rock with pore fluid,

respectively.

To compute the dry bulk and shear moduli, the known

friable,oruncemented, sandmodel (Mavko et al 2003) isused

in this work. This model makes use of the Hertz–Mindlin

contact theory and a heuristic modified Hashin–Strikman

of internal deformation which is assumed to be equal to 1 in

this work.

where Kw and Ko denote oil and water bulk moduli,

fromthefluidbulkdensitiesandfluidacousticvelocitythrough

the equations of Batzle and Wang (1992). The bulk densities

?o and ?w can also be exported from the flux simulation and

used as an input to compute bulk fluid modulus. A summary

can be found in Mavko et al (2003). Note that in this work, it

is assumed no gas is present.

2.2. Forward modelling

In order to validate the inversion scheme, synthetic seismic

data are being considered in this work. As will be detailed

later, the seismic attributes considered here are IP and IS. To

build the synthetic impedance volumes, the PEM is run over

a reference simulation model that represents the true earth

modelling. This forward modelling uses as input pressure and

saturation values, generated by the simulation, and computes

acoustic and shear impedances through the PEM for each

simulation grid block. Apart from the dynamic property pair

(Pre, Sw), the reservoir properties such as porosity, mineral

compressibility, fluid properties and temperature are also

needed.

Anothersimulationmodel isusedintheinversionscheme,

which refers to the engineering simulation model, here called

the base model, built based on the reservoir characterization

process and, therefore, assuming a lack of information that

makes it different from the reference model. This lack of

information can be, for instance, a missing channel, a wrong

permeability field or a wrong facies modelling. These two

models are generated according to the necessity of each

study; in this case, they were different enough to produce

considerable time lapse differences.

Initially, this work considers an ideal set of data, i.e.

(i) Seismic impedance is generated at simulation scale

(reference and base models have the same scale).

(ii) Noise-free seismic data.

(iii) Elastic inversion errors are not considered.

(iv) No errors or uncertainties are assumed for the PEM and

its input parameters. The same PEM is first used for the

forward modelling to generate the synthetic impedance

and then for the inversion process.

(v) Water flooding example (no presence of gas).

In section 4, a discussion is presented for some cases

where these ideal conditions are not totally assumed.

3. Preliminary studies

Before starting the discussion of the petro-elastic inversion

itself, some verifications were made in order to check the

importance of having more than one kind of seismic data

(P and S impedances, in this case) when it is wanted to

estimate pressure and saturation. Moreover, the influence of

pressure, saturationandporosity in IPand ISwasalsoverified

for3Dand4Ddata.Understandingtheseissueshelpstocontrol

the inversion behaviour.

3.1. P and S impedances

An initial test based only on forward modelling was run

to check and illustrate that the combination of P and S

impedances would lead to a single pair (Pre, Sw), assuming

the ideal set of data presented above. To achieve this,

values of P and S impedances were computed through

the PEM, varying pressure and water saturation within

a known range. All other parameters (porosity, rock and

fluid compressibility, temperature, etc) remained constant.

These computed impedance values generated the solid red

surfaces seen in figure 1. If a pressure and saturation pair

is selected randomly, for instance, 24 MPa and 0.3, then

the corresponding IP and IS values are 6367 × 103 and

3731 × 103 kg s?1 m2, respectively. In the same figure, the

red-dashed planes represent these constant impedances.

highlighted.Thesepoints, in light blue, represent all pairs that

would give IP = 6367 × 103 kg s?1 m2 and, in yellow, all

pairs thatwouldgiveIS = 3731 × 103kg s?1m2. Infigure 1,

it can be noted that the use of only IP to obtain pressure and

saturation yields a multiple answer inversion problem. But, if

both impedances are considered simultaneously, the solution

setisnowreducedtotheintersectionofthesetwosetsofpoints,

which, for this case, reduces to the single pair (24 MPa, 0.3).

So, it was shown that if the measured seismic attributes

(impedances, in this case) and the PEM were perfect, without

any noise, or error, the inversion procedure of converting

IP and IS into pressure and saturation should convert to the

right answer since therewouldbeonlyaglobalminimum. It is

also important to highlight that this simple illustration is valid

for all pressure and water saturation pairs that belong to the

range considered and depend on the PEM used.

3.2. Sensitivity analysis

The relationships between rock and fluid properties described

through thePEMarenotvery simpleand the influenceofeach

unknown on the computed values of IP and IS is not easy

to identify, especially due to the inter-dependence of them.

So, a simplified uncertainty analysis is presented here, since

it is not the scope of this work to deeply study this issue, in

order to verify the influence of the independent rock and fluid

properties used as input to the PEM described previously. To

calculate these influences, one property was varied at a time

and the respective percentage variations of IP and IS were

saved. Each curve displayed in figure 2 corresponds to the

variation of one property in the range described in table 1;

theotherproperties remainedconstant (including thedynamic

properties). Note that these ranges were defined within a

feasible set of values, according to the sand reservoir model

assumed.

From figure 2, it can be verified that porosity is the

parameter that most influences impedance calculation. It is

necessary toobserve that the rangeofvariation considered for

porositywaswide,whichconsequentlyproducesbigvariations

in IP and IS, but even if a smaller range is considered, such as

20% for instance, the variation in impedances is still relevant

and bigger than the ones observed for the other parameters.

The same kind of sensitivity was done for temperature and

even assuming a wide range of variation for these properties

(?50% +50%), the impedance variation observed was not

bigger than 2%. As these results were not significant, they are

not shown here.

Thefocusofthisworkistodiscusstheinversionprocedure

to obtain dynamic properties from 4D seismic data, first

considering an ideal set of data and after assuming some

errors/noise. Thus, the discussion presented in the following

sections aims to consider one source of error, which is the

uncertainty on reservoir properties. As shown in this section,

porosity is a very important property when calculating P and

S impedances, so this property will be used to discuss the

potentials and limitations of the inversion proposed.

3.3. Porosity influence on P and S impedances assuming

dynamic property variation

This section proposes a sensitivity analysis to check the

porosity influenceonIPandISfor3Dand4Ddatafordifferent

values of pressure and saturation. The procedure consists of

computingboth impedances throughPEM,usingpressureand

saturationvalues generated froma reservoir simulationmodel

at two production times (considering two seismic surveys)

assuming different porosity values; the intention of using

different values of porosity is to analyse the influence of

porosity on the results. The use of reservoir engineering

simulated values was chosen in order to have a consistent

time lapse difference for these unknowns. It is necessary to

highlight that the model details of the static properties are

not important for the analysis proposed here, because we just

want toevaluate impedancevariabilityforagivenpressureand

saturationpairassumingdifferentporosities.So, thesimulated

block values are used as single points on the crossplots shown

below.

The reservoir model used has an average initial pressure

of 32 MPa and 15% of connate water saturation. After eight

years of production, simulated values for different blocks

belong to the pressure range (24–29 MPa) and the water

saturation range (0.15–0.85). Figure 3 shows the impedances

versus pressure and saturation crossplots for these data. The

colours represent different porosities used to compute IP and

IS.Foronecolour, eachpoint representsa reservoir simulation

grid block. This image shows the strong influence of porosity

on both impedances, since there is a considerable distance

between each colour point cloud.

The details of one of these cases can be seen in figure 4,

where only the point cloud corresponding to ? = 0.15 is

displayed. This kind of display allows us to check some

relationsbetweenbothimpedancesandthedynamicunknowns

(pressure and saturation) that were not clear in figure 3

because of the y-scale. Looking at figure 4(a), the vertical

point dispersion of the cloud is due to different saturation

values assumed, ranging from (0.15–0.85). This means that

saturation has a strong influence on IP, because, for a fixed

pressure, the range of possible values that IP can assume is

wide.Doing the sameanalysis forpressure, it canbeobserved

in figure 4(b) that the IP range is much smaller for a constant

Sw than the one observed in figure 4(a). Therefore, saturation

is more influential than pressure for these data. It is important

to emphasize that the pressure range for this reservoir model

is not as wide as the saturation range, in agreement with the

expected behaviour of a predefined production strategy with

controlled pressure drop (water flooding, for instance).

Making an equivalent analysis for shear impedance, in

figures 4(c) and (d) the strong influence of pressure on IS

can be seen in contrast to the weak influence of saturation

(as expected), highlighted by the constant IS behaviour of

the point cloud in figure 4(d). These different responses, or

sensitivity, of IP and IS to pressure and saturation variations

are good indicators that these two data should be used

simultaneously in the inversion, as will be discussed in the

following sections.

When time lapse differences are considered, the distance

between each colour cloud observed in figure 3 becomes

less significant, as shown in figure 5, where the colours

represent the same porosity values considered previously.

Now, these clouds are practically superimposed and have

a much smaller deviation among themselves than the ones

observed in figure 3, which means that even if the porosity

model is wrong, the 4D differences of IP and IS are going to

be close to the true one, i.e. porosity errors will be minimized

by the subtraction of the vintages.

Still in figure 5, the red point cloud is not really

superimposed over the others, especially for figures 5(a) and

(b), but this is not an important issue because, in this case, the

porosity is too low, i.e. it can be considered a non-reservoir

rock. In other words, if the porosity model is not able to

identify reservoir and non-reservoir rocks, then not even the

4Ddifferences shouldbeable togiveuseful informationabout

pressure and saturation variations.

Looking at any one of the four different porosity cases,

some features can be observed in figure 5. One of them

is the cloud dispersion of 1IP × 1Pre that occurs due

to the variations of 1Sw, which covers quite a wide range

(0–0.7), showing that for the same 1Pre the P-impedance 4D

variation can assume very different values. Therefore, 1Sw is

more influential than pressure on 1IP. This is confirmed by

the crossplot of 1IP × 1Sw where the point clouds are much

lessdispersed, showingabetter correlationbetween these two

properties.

Clearly, the same cannot be observed for the graph of

1IS × 1Pre, as expected, since shear impedance is not

sensitive to saturationchanges.For the same reason, thegraph

1IS × 1Sw displays constant 1IS behaviour when 1Sw
varies. On the other hand, the dispersion of any of the point

clouds on this graph shows the influence of 1Pre on 1IS,

which is also confirmed by the good correlation presented in

the crossplot of 1IS × 1Pre.

The main points to highlight are (1) regarding 3D data,

IP and IS modelling is very sensitive to porosity; (2) when

time lapse data are considered, the porosity influence on

1IP and 1IS is much weaker compared to that observed for

3D data; (3) the variations observed on 1IP and 1IS due

to dynamic property changes are more evident than those

observed for porosity variation; (4) the strong correlations

between 1IP × 1Sw and 1IS × 1Pre are a good indication

that 1IP and 1IS can be used simultaneously to obtain 1Sw
and 1Pre.

4. Petro-elastic inversion

4.1. 3D inversion

The 3D inversion algorithm proposed here follows the

idea presented in Souza et al (2010) and adds the shear

impedance into theprocess inorder tocouplewith themultiple

answer issue. The basic idea of the process is to minimize

the difference between seismic impedance and synthetic

impedance computed from a reservoir simulation model

(figure 6). This minimization is done through an optimization

processthatusessimulatedpressureandsaturationvaluesfrom

the base model as an initial guess.

This work uses synthetic seismic data, so it is necessary

to run a previous step to generate the synthetic impedance

represented by the green box in figure 6.

The objective function of the optimization process is

defined as

OF =

where IPseis and ISseis are the P and S impedances computed

from seismic amplitudes, or in this case, it is the synthetic

impedance computed considering the reference model and

IPsim and ISsim are the P and S synthetic impedancescomputed

with the base model simulation results.

Aswill bepresented later, some testswere runcomparing

the inversion process when the objective function is defined

by equation (15) and also when this equation is modified

by removing the shear impedance from it. It is important to

highlight that theproceduresshowninfigure6areall runat the

an internalMatlabfunctioncalled fmincon whichisagradient-

based method for constrained problems. It is important to

highlight that the convergence criteria are based not only on

the minimization of the objective function but also on the size

of the step between each answer found; if this size is smaller

than a tolerance, then the algorithm ends.

In order to illustrate the objective function behaviour, we

will consider singlepressure and saturationpairs thatwewant

to obtain from synthetic seismic data (as the inversion is run

for each block separately, there is no problem to look at the

inversion for only one block). As cited before, there are two

different simulation models: the reference model (true earth

model) and the base model (reservoir engineering model).

Assuming that the simulation of these models gave the values

listed in table 2 and that the inversion is constrained by the

ranges 0.1 &amp;lt;Sw &amp;lt;1 and 5 &amp;lt;Pre &amp;lt;50 (MPa), then all

possible values that the OF can assume, combining saturation

and pressure with a step of 0.01 and 0.35, respectively, are

defined by a surface that can be visualized in a 3D plot (OF,

Pre, Sw).

Figures 7(a) and (b) show these corresponding surfaces

forthecasewhereOF= f(IP)andOF= f(IP,IS), respectively.

The multiple response issue can be visualized on the bottom

of these surfaces, where the contour plot is drawn. Note that

figure 7(b) clearly shows a global minimum in opposition

to several local minima seen in figure 7(a). Another way of

showing this is illustrated infigures7(c)and(d).These images

show two things: the first one is the set of coloured points

corresponding to the lower objective function’s values (hot

colours stand for higher values) and the second is the three

points given by the initial guess (cyan), the inversion solution

(green)andthetrueanswer(magenta).Onecouldsaythat there

is no doubt now that, if only IP was used, the optimization

algorithm could be stuck in a local minimum as happened in

theexampleshowninfigure7(c).Furthermore, thepresenceof

shear impedanceyields anoptimizationproblemwithaglobal

minimum easily found by the optimization algorithm.

Davolio et al (2011) showed an application of this

methodology in a synthetic reservoir model. In that paper,

the case where only IP was considered is referenced by

‘Algorithm 1’ and when both impedances are used in the

objective function, it is referenced by ‘Algorithm 2’. The

applicationof thisalgorithminanoise-freedata set shows that

it is possible to obtain pressure and saturation if the second

algorithm is used. The paper also shows that, if a simple

perturbation is assumed in the porosity field (multiplying it

byaconstant), the3D inversionalgorithmfails and, therefore,

a 4D approach should be used.

As shown in a previous section, porosity has a strong

influence on shear and acoustic impedances, indicating that

if this parameter is wrong, the inversion procedure may fail.

The images of figure 8 show a comparison of the inversion

procedureusing the3Dalgorithmpresentedbefore forasingle

known and in figure 8(b) it is not. The base and reference

model values are listed in table 3 under the ‘Time 1’ column.

For the second case, the reference model porosity is 0.1956

and thebasemodelporosity is0.2590.Fromfigure8(b), it can

be shown that the inversiondoesnotwork for suchcases since

the answer (magenta) is far from the global minimum.

The idea of 4D studies using seismic data is always

related to 4D differences because it is expected that errors

from static properties (like porosity) will be diminished when

the data are subtracted, thus highlighting dynamic effects, as

discussed in section 3.3. So, the natural improvement of the

algorithm proposed was to incorporate this approach in order

tomitigatewrongporosityeffects.The4Dinversionalgorithm

closely follows the same idea as the 3D, aiming to minimize

the differences between seismic impedances and synthetic

impedances computed from simulation data. As illustrated in

the workflow of figure 9, the main difference now is that the

algorithm deals with two seismic surveys (base = time 0 and

monitor = time 1) and the objective function is written as

where the indexseisstandsfor theseismic impedances,which,

in this case, is a synthetic impedance computed through the

reference model, and the index sim stands for the synthetic

impedances computed using the base simulation model. Note

that now the 4D difference is minimized, so the operator

14D stands for the time lapsedifference: monitor ? base. One

importantassumption that isbeingused is thefact that thebase

thatpressureandsaturationareknownat time0.Anotherpoint

to highlight is that as in the 3D approach, the 4D inversion is

also run for each block independently.

The same data used to generate the images of figure 8

are now used to run the 4D inversion algorithm. The base and

reference model values are listed in table 3 for the two 4D

times considered. Note that it is considered that the base 4D

time corresponds to the reservoir initial time, which means

that pressure and saturation are known at this time, yielding

equal values for both reservoir models at time 0.

Figure 10 presents the results of the 4D inversion. For

the case where the porosity is known (figure 10(a)), the

4D inversion algorithm yielded results very close to the

true answer (the errors obtained correspond to the numerical

errors of the optimization), as happened in the 3D inversion

algorithm(figure8(a)).However,when theporosityvaluesare

assumed to be wrong, the 4D approach makes the difference,

yielding a pressure and saturation pair (figure 10(b)) much

closer, although not exact, to the answer than the one seen in

figure 8(b).

In order to check the algorithm, different initial guesses

were tested but, since this optimization problem has a well-

behaved objective function with a global minimum, this input

does not make much difference.

4.3. 4D inversion on different production scenarios

In order to have a more robust study, in this section, the

4D inversion results are presented for different production

scenarios, i.e. different saturation and pressure pairs are

evaluated.

The possible production scenarios are summarized in

this work in six cases, as described in table 4.These six cases

subsection (and the following ones) show the 4D difference

of thedynamicproperties, insteadof the second surveyvalues

as used before. Still in figure 11, the 4D inversion results for

each scenario are plotted considering that porosity is known

and assuming three different values: ? = 0.1, ? = 0.2 and

? = 0.3. This image shows that no matter what the saturation,

pressure and porosity values are, the 4D inversion provides

correct values (just having the numerical error of the process)

when the ideal data set, with no errors or uncertainties, is

considered.

Figure 12 presents the results for the same scenarios

but now assuming that the porosity is not known (?T is the

true porosity and ?E is the estimated porosity); it shows

the results for each scenario assuming that the estimated

porosity was not totally correct. An important issue that can

be observed in figure 12 is that looking at the inversion

results for the same porosity case (red points, for instance),

the quality of the estimated pressure and saturation variations

depends on the scenario considered. One explanation for this

may be that the error induced by the wrong porosity in the

synthetic impedances (IPsim and ISsim) calculation overrides

theeffects that thedynamicproperty4Dvariationhasonthem.

Nevertheless, ingeneral, theerrorsobtainedareacceptableand

it can be said that the 4D inversion works well in all scenarios

and porosities.

4.4. 4D inversion assuming noise in seismic data

Another important source of error in the inversion process

studied is the noise presented in seismic data. For the type of

analysis that is being presented in this work, which looks at

each point of the reservoir separately, the presence of noise

in seismic data can be represented simply by a percentage

perturbation on 14DIP and 14DIS. So, these wrong values

that the impedances assumecan represent seismicnoise, scale

issues and even wrong modelling. Note that, when looking to

the whole reservoir behaviour, these sources of errors need to

be modelled more properly, since the spatial effects must be

accounted for. Again, in this work, these effects just provide

wrong point values of impedances since the algorithm is run

for each reservoir simulation block.

In this sense, figure 13 shows the results of the

4D inversion assuming different perturbations on seismic

impedances, also the porosity is considered known and the

results are shown for three porosity cases (0.1, 0.2 and 0.3)

for the depletion and injection scenarios described in table 4.

Different colours stand for different perturbation applied to

the time lapsedifferenceof IPand IS, according to the legend.

Again, it is observed that the quality of the inversion depends

on the scenario assumed, which is expected since the success

variationsforacertainvariationofpressureandsaturation. It is

important to highlight that the solution set of the optimization

was constrained by the limits of the scenarios considered

(14DSw = [0–0.75] and 14DPre = [?15–15 MPa]); this fact

justifies some results falling in theboundary. Ingeneral, it can

be said that the results are acceptable for impedance errors up

to15%.Forerrorsbigger than that, the results can still capture

the trend expected (pressure or saturation decrease/increase),

but the quantification of these values can be compromised; so

additional research is necessary to verify how noisy data can

be inverted with more confidence.

4.5. 4D inversion assuming uncertainty in the reservoir

initial conditions

The last analysis shown in this work concerns the fact that the

initial conditions of the reservoir are not known. Four cases

were tested where the initial pressure and saturations used in

the 4D inversion are the ones detailed in table 5, instead of

assuming the correct values: Sw = 0.15 and Pre = 32 MPa.

One thing to highlight is that at the initial time, pressure can

be considered known, since the 4D acquisition occurs after

some years of production and usually the reservoir pressure

in the past is known, so the uncertainty is small. The connate

water value can be uncertain since the reservoir can have

different facies that cannot be correctly located. This explains

the small variation for pressure considered in table 5 around

the true values and the chosen values for the initial saturation.

Figure 14 shows the results for these cases. The errors

observed are acceptable, showing that even if these properties

have some uncertainty, it should not interfere too much with

the results (not as much as for noisy seismic data as shown in

the previous section).

5. Conclusions

A theoretical study of a petro-elastic inversion to obtain

pressure and saturation from seismic attributes was presented.

Using an ideal set of data, free of any kind of noise or

error in order to observe only the influence of the technical

parameters, itwaspossibletoshowthatpressureandsaturation

could be recovered from seismic data using only one seismic

survey through the 3D inversion algorithm proposed, where

P and S impedances were considered simultaneously. The

necessity of a time lapse approach arises when errors start

to be considered in the ideal set of data, assuming that the

reservoir properties (initially represented only by porosity in

this work to simplify the process) are unknown (which is the

most common case).

The importance of the reservoir properties (represented

in this work by porosity) to the petro-elastic modelling used

was illustrated by a simple sensitivity analysis, from which it

couldbeconcluded that, for thePEMused,porosityhasahigh

influence on 3D impedances and that this influence decreases

when 4D differences are considered. Some tests of the 3D

and 4D inversion algorithms proposed were presented and,

in agreement with the sensitivity analysis, the 3D inversion

failed when errors in porosity were considered and, as long as

minimumknowledgeabout theporosityvalue is available, the

4D inversion yielded satisfactory results.

Differentproductionscenarioswereconsideredtovalidate

the 4D inversion proposed. It was verified that for the ideal

data set, the inversion results were practically exact for all

scenarios analysed. If anot totally ideal data set is considered,

assuming errors or uncertainties, it was observed that the

quality of the inversion depends on the current scenario.

Although, when uncertainties are considered in the porosity

values and under the initial reservoir conditions, the inversion

errors are still acceptable. When the time lapse difference of

seismic impedances was disturbed up to 15%, the results of

all scenarios were acceptable; if impedance differences are

disturbed more than that, the results can still capture the

trend expected (pressure or saturation decrease/increase), but

the quantification of these values can be compromised, and

additionalwork isnecessary toproperly estimatepressureand

saturation.

The use of time-lapse seismic data to improve reservoir characterization is becoming a common practice in

the oil industry. Nevertheless, the integration of datasets with different characteristics, such as flow simulation

and seismic data, is still a challenge. One of the possible ways to perform the integration is the use of extracted

pressure and saturation from 4D seismic in the history matching process. However, the quantitative use of

pressure and saturation difference maps in the objective function needs more accurate estimation of these

dynamic properties. Thus, this work proposes a methodology to use multiple simulation model realizations,

generated through the combination of uncertain reservoir attributes, to guide an inversion process that

evaluates pressure and saturation from 4D seismic, in order to provide estimations that are more reliable. The

application of the methodology in a synthetic dataset showed promising results. The main contribution of this

work is to show that it is possible to use available knowledge from flow simulation and reservoir

characterization to constrain time-lapse data and extract from it more reliable information.

that yields a better understanding of the reservoir and conse-

quently, more efficient field operations and better financial return.

There are several works in the literature describing successful

applications of this technology (Castro et al., 2009; Helgerud et al.,

2011; Tuttle et al., 2009).

Time-lapse seismic can provide not only information about

dynamic properties (pressure and saturation changes) but it can

also help to map static properties such as fault transmissibility or

facies modeling. The work of Castro et al. (2009) is an example of

the application of 4D seismic in both situations.

Another aspect to highlight, concerning the application of this

kind of data, is how to integrate it with reservoir flow simulation.

The information provided by 4D seismic can be used in a

qualitative or quantitative way. The works of Helgerud et al.

(2011) and Tuttle et al. (2009) are examples of qualitative

application, where 4D seismic was used to determine barriers

and baffles. The quantitative integration of time-lapse seismic and

reservoir simulation data is usually made via history matching, by

defining a procedure to match not only the well production and

pressure data but also 4D seismic attributes.

Concerning seismic attributes, the matching is done between

the observed seismic and the synthetic seismic derived from the

simulation results. In this sense, the procedure can match seismic

amplitudes, impedances or any other seismic-derived attribute.

Several works, regarding this kind of application, can be found in

the literature. Dadashpour et al.'s (2009) work is an example

where a quantitative integration between production and seismic

data is presented, given that the seismic is used in the form of zero

offset amplitudes and gradients. Fahimuddin et al. (2010) compare

the use of different seismic data when performing history match-

ing in the ensemble Kalman filter framework. The authors con-

clude that, in the realistic case considered, the use of impedances

yields better results than the ones obtained by using amplitudes.

Another work that presents the quantitative use of 4D seismic in

the impedance domain is that of Kazemi et al. (2010). In this case,

the authors discuss techniques to normalize seismic derived

impedances, to make the order of magnitude of these values

comparable to the synthetic impedances computed from flow

simulation.

It is also possible to extract information about pressure and

saturation variations from time-lapse data and quantitatively

match these estimated parameters with flow simulator results.

Gervais and Roggero's (2010) work is an example, in which the

authors propose a local parameterization technique and incorpo-

rate saturation information provided by the seismic data in an

assisted history matching process. Jin et al. (2011) present another

example of the use of saturation patterns extracted from 4D

seismic, in which the authors show a comparison of stochastic

optimization methods to integrate quantitatively seismic and

production data.

An effective estimation of saturation and pressure values from

4D seismic data is a more complicated task than extracting

saturation patterns. Tura and Lumley (1999) showed that it is

possible to estimate changes in pressure and saturation through P

and S seismic impedances. Landro (2001) proposed a methodology

based on mathematical expressions that combines 4D AVO attri-

butes to extract pressure and saturation changes. In the same

work, he demonstrates a successful application of his technique on

the Gullfaks field. These results were also included in the discus-

sion presented by Landro et al. (2001), which focuses on reservoir

management, showing that time-lapse seismic improved the

drainage understanding of the Gullfaks field. MacBeth et al.

(2006) also proposed a methodology to identify pressure and

saturation changes using time-lapse seismic data. Their metho-

dology is able to use any kind of seismic attributes (two or more)

since these attributes have a different response to pressure and

saturation changes. The work of Dadashpour et al. (2008) present a

petro-elastic inversion methodology that uses zero offset 4D

seismic amplitudes to recover pressure and saturation changes.

Davolio et al. (2012) also present a methodology to estimate

dynamic properties from 4D seismic through the P and S seismic

impedances. Different from Tura and Lumley (1999), the metho-

dology of this work is based on an optimization process aimed at

quantifying the results obtained.

There are many challenges to overcome when converting

seismic data into pressure and saturation values. The main issues

are noise/errors presented in acquired seismic data, together with

errors/uncertainties in reservoir properties and modeling (petro-

elastic modeling). Davolio et al. (2012) present a discussion about

how some of these issues influence the estimation of dynamic

properties from time-lapse seismic.

The methodology we are proposing in this work attempts to

mitigate these influences by using known information (from

engineering data) to guide the estimation of pressure and satura-

tion changes from time-lapse data, avoiding unfeasible results

(considering flow conditions) that can occur due to the problems

mentioned. The methodology uses the combination of uncertain

reservoir attributes to generate multiple reservoir models, from

which limits are established for the unknown pressure and

saturation. Then, these limits are used in a petro-elastic inversion

algorithm to estimate pressure and saturation from 4D seismic.

More specifically, these limits will constrain the solution space of

the optimization procedure used to invert 4D data to pressure and

saturation.

Observed well pressure and production data are also incorpo-

rated into the methodology, reducing the initial range of the

reservoir response. The effects of this reduction are reflected on

the estimated pressure and saturation values, since stricter limits

are used in the inversion process.

If reservoir characterization and uncertain attributes selection

are done properly, the limits extracted from multiple simulations

can, for instance, restrict areas where the saturation front should

reach, although that could be estimated from 4D seismic with

some errors or noise. This kind of result is shown in the applica-

tion presented in a synthetic dataset.

The focus of the proposed methodology is then to calibrate 4D

seismic response using the knowledge available from reservoir

simulation data as support for the inversion process. The main

contribution of the work is to show how reservoir engineering

data can be used to guide the inversion process by means of a

robust and simple implementation method.

2. Methodology

The methodology proposed here has the objective of guiding

the inversion process to estimate pressure and saturation from

time-lapse seismic data, in order to obtain results that are more

consistent with flow conditions (considering uncertainties). As

illustrated in Fig. 1, the procedure consists of extracting limits for

pressure and saturation from the simulation of multiple models

(generated by flow simulation of scenarios that represent the

combination of uncertain attributes). Then, these limits are used to

constrain the solution space of the optimization process that

estimates the dynamic parameters.

Well history data is also used to improve the methodology by

selecting the models that provide production curves closer to the

observed data. The reduced number of models consequently

reduces the computed limit range that is used to constrain the

estimation of pressure and saturation.

This section is divided into two parts: the first one describes

the inversion process used to estimate pressure and saturation

variations from 4D seismic data and the second one explains how

the multiple models generated from the uncertainty analysis are

used to constrain the inversion.

2.1. Petro-elastic inversion

The inversion procedure (Davolio et al. (2012) for more details)

is based on an optimization process that minimizes the differences

between seismic impedances and synthetic impedances computed

from flow simulation data in order to obtain pressure and satura-

tion variations. To generate seismic attributes from reservoir

simulation data, a petro-elastic model (PEM), which is a set of

relationships that relates fluid/rock and elastic properties, is

required.

The inversion is run at the flow simulation scale and is

performed for every grid block independently (therefore, an

upscaling/downscaling procedure is required to convert data from

seismic scale to flow simulation scale). The input data are the 4D

seismic, represented by two 3D surveys at time 0 (base) and time 1

(monitor), and the flow simulated pressure and saturation for both

times. The procedure is run according to the following steps (see

Fig. 2):

1. Go to the first grid block location.

2. At the current grid block, the initial guess (Pre, Sw) is taken

from the simulated reservoir model at time 1.

impedances.

Fig. 1. General workflow of the proposed methodology. The simulation of multiple models (generated from the combination of uncertain attributes) together with

production data defines limits (minimum and maximum) to be used in the inversion process, constraining the unknowns that will be estimated (pressure and saturation).

3. At the current grid block, compute IP and IS via PEM with the

current values of (Pre, Sw).

4. Compute the objective function described in Eq. (1) for the

current grid block. If the objective function value is smaller

than a tolerance, go to step 5; if it is not, go to step 6.

5. The optimization finishes and the solution for the current block

at time 1 is assumed to be the current pair (Pre, Sw). If it is not

the last grid block location, go to the next block and return to

step 2.

6. A gradient search algorithm updates the parameters (Pre, Sw)

inside the constrained solution space and return to step 3.

The objective function depends on the difference of the time-

lapse differences according to the equation:

where the index seis stands for seismic impedances, the index sim

stands for synthetic impedances computed from flow simulation

results and the operator ?4D stands for time-lapse difference:

monitor-base.

The constraints used in step 6 to limit the solution space are the

key points of the proposed methodology. As described in the next

section, this work proposes to define these constraints based on

multiple reservoir simulation models.

The optimization algorithm used is a gradient-based method

for constrained problems. Note that the way the problem was set,

it is a simple and fast optimization problem with only two

unknowns for each grid block. Therefore, a gradient method is

being used, since there is no need for more sophisticated methods.

One important assumption that it is being used is based on the

fact that the base 4D time corresponds to the reservoir at

equilibrium conditions (initial time), which means that pressure

and saturation are assumed to be known (or estimated with good

accuracy) at time 0. Therefore, the final answer of the process is an

estimation of pressure and saturation for the second survey

(time 1).

Note that this procedure does not update any static reservoir

property. The goal here is to extract pressure and saturation values

from 4D seismic. These results should be further used in a history

matching process, which will then update reservoir properties.

Since history matching is not the focus of this work, this kind of

application will not be shown here.

2.2. Multiple flow simulation models

One common approach for uncertainty analysis is the combination

of different uncertain parameters such as porosity, permeability, faults

transmissibility etc., and the generation of multiple simulation models.

The proposed methodology aims to use the simulation results of all

these models, in order to constrain the solution space of the inversion

described in the previous section. The procedure consists of defining

limits (minimum and maximum) for the unknown pressure and

saturation at each reservoir block, and using them to constrain the

solution space of the optimization process defined in Section 2.1.

These limits are used more specifically in step 6.

Fig. 3 presents a scheme showing how these limits are extracted.

The left side of the image illustrates an uncertainty analysis

procedure assuming there are “n” uncertain attributes (which could

be porosity, permeability, relative permeability etc.). After the

combination of these attributes, “m” reservoir simulation models

are built. After simulating all the models, “m” scenarios of pressure

and saturation are generated. Thus, every single reservoir block

location has “m” possible values of pressure and saturation. So, for

every single location, the minimum and maximum values along all

the possible “m” values are extracted.

The idea behind this methodology is to guide the inversion by

using reservoir simulation results, avoiding pressure and satura-

tion estimated values that are not compatible with the limits

obtained from flow simulation considering the mapped reservoir

uncertainties. Consequently, the methodology aims to avoid

incorrect estimated values that can be generated due to noise/

errors presented in seismic data and/or petro-elastic modeling and

parameters, by constraining the solution space of the optimization

process through the limits extracted.

If uncertainties are underestimated, as can be observed in several

practical cases (generally described by unknown unknowns), flow

simulation conditions can impose incorrect limits to the inversion

process. In these instances, other iterations can be used to gradually

improve the process.

2.3. Using observed production data

In addition to the use of the multiple models, it is possible to

make an improvement in the methodology by using observed

production data. The idea is to reduce the models dispersion by

selecting only the ones that produce values close to the history data.

If the models range is reduced, then tighter limits for pressure and

Fig. 3. General procedure used to define limits (minimum and maximum) of pressure and saturation for each reservoir block. ‘Attribute 1’, ‘Attribute 2’ and ‘Attribute n’ are

generic representations of the reservoir uncertainty and ‘Model 1’, ‘Model 2’ and ‘Model m’ are generic reservoir models generated from the combination of the reservoir

uncertainties.

saturation are expected, constraining the solution space of the

inversion even more.

In this case, an additional step in the scheme presented in Fig. 3

is required in order to estimate the limits for the dynamic

properties. It is necessary to do a selection of these models based

on the distance between their simulation results and the history

data. So, instead of using the “m” models generated, only certain

selected models are used to determine minimum and maximum

values for pressure and saturation.

The criterion used to exclude a model is based on the misfit (M)

between observed (dobs) and simulated data (dsim), according to

the equation below:

M ¼ ?
N

i ¼ 1

ðd
obs
i ?d

sim
i Þ

2
ð2Þ

where N is the number of observed data. In this work, the only

available data is bottom-hole pressure. Models with misfit smaller

than a given percentage, in relation to the model with the

maximum misfit, are used to define the new limits of pressure

and saturation.

3. Application

This section describes the dataset used to generate the results. In a

real problem, the data needed to apply the proposed methodology is

4D seismic data (P and S impedances), the reservoir simulation model

and the multiple model realizations resulting from an uncertainty

analysis. This work uses a synthetic dataset, so, apart from the

simulation model (called here base model) and the multiple realiza-

tions, there is another model (called here reference model) that is

used to generate the synthetic seismic. Thus, the reference model

represents the true earth model, and the base model represents the

model available to the engineer. These models differ from each other

by the uncertainty properties described in Section 3.2. Everything else

(like grid definition, fault location etc.) is the same for both models.

As mentioned in the previous section regarding the inversion

process (step 3), a petro-elastic modeling is used to generate the

seismic attributes. The petro-elastic model described in Section 3.4

is used for two purposes: the first one is the forward modeling

inside the inversion (step 3) and the second is the generation of

the synthetic seismic dataset considered in this work, which is

better detailed in Section 3.5.

3.1. Reservoir model description

The reservoir model considered in this work was discretized in

a corner-point grid with 90 $ 110 $ 5 blocks, 60 m in size in the x

and y directions (5400 $ 6600 m2) and 15 m (on the average) in the

z direction. There are three facies characterized according to three

permeability ranges. The reservoir also comprises four faults, as can

be seen in Fig. 4. The reservoir is drained by eight vertical producer

wells, which are supported by seven water injector wells (Fig. 4).

3.2. Model uncertainties

The uncertain attributes considered in this work, defined by

multipliers are as follows:

(1) Four faults transmissibility: three discrete values (0, 0.1 and 1).

(2) Relative permeability curves (Corey exponents for the water

phase) for each of the three facies.

(3) Permeability ratio (vertical/horizontal).

Uniform distributions were used to start the procedure for each

of these eight attributes.

The other two uncertain parameters are the porosity and

horizontal permeability, both of which were generated by geosta-

tistical techniques. Using the sequential Gaussian simulation tech-

nique (SGS), 200 realizations of porosity were generated, with the

seismic P-impedance volume at time 0 (base survey) as a secondary

variable. Each of these porosity fields was used later as a second

variable for the SGS to generate 200 realizations of permeability.

Using the slice sampling technique (Neal, 2003), 400 simula-

tion models were generated from the combination of the 10

uncertain attributes, which were sampled from uniform distribu-

tions. As uniform distribution was assumed, in principle, any other

appropriate sampling technique could have been employed, such

as Latin Hypercube for example, as presented by Maschio et al.

(2010).

3.3. Reference and base model

As detailed in Section 3.5, a synthetic seismic is being used. To

generate the seismic attributes, it is being considered a reference

simulation model, which represents the true earth model.

Fig. 4. Reservoir simulation model: 3D view (on the left) and 2D view of the third layer (on the right). The color represents the horizontal permeability field of the reference

model. The reservoir has four main faults and the production is carried by eight vertical producer wells, supported by seven water injector wells. (For interpretation of the

references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

A second simulation model (the base model) is also used in the

process, representing the reservoir model available to the engi-

neer. This model represents the available knowledge about the

reservoir. Hence, its reservoir properties (like porosity) are used as

input in the inversion process, as well as its simulated pressure

and saturation, which are used as the initial guess for the

optimization process, as indicated in Fig. 2.

The base model was selected as one of the 400 model realiza-

tions generated after combining all the uncertainties. Thus, the

differences between the two models concern the 10 uncertain

parameters described previously. The values of the parameters

defined as multipliers are presented in Table 1. The other two

uncertain parameters are the permeability and porosity fields

shown in Fig. 5 for the third reservoir layer. The porosity field of

the base case was calibrated to the 3D seismic data, which allowed

the capture of the general features of the true porosity field,

although with little resolution.

As this work is focused on the process of extracting pressure

and saturation variations from time-lapse seismic data, the most

important question regarding the differences between the two

models is the differences observed in the simulation results. In this

sense, Fig. 6 displays pressure and saturation maps for the third

layer of the reservoir for both models after six years of production.

One of the most influential differences between the models is the

sealing fault located in the middle of the reservoir (Fault 2), which

is presented only in the reference model. This can be clearly

visualized by comparing Fig. 6c and d, where the reference

pressure map has two well defined regions (more and less

pressurized) in opposition to the homogenous behavior of the

pressure map of the base model.

In relation to the petro-elastic inversion, Fig. 6b and d repre-

sents the initial guess while the answer that the algorithm aims to

reach is displayed in Fig. 6a and c.

3.4. Petro-elastic modeling

A petro-elastic modeling is required to generate seismic attri-

butes from simulation data. The seismic attributes used in the

inversion described in Section 2.1 are compressional and shear

impedances, called here IP and IS, respectively. Considering ?, Vp
and VS the density, compressional and shear wave velocities of the

medium, respectively, the impedances can be written as:

IP ¼ Vp?; ð3Þ

IS ¼ VS?: ð4Þ

Seismic velocities depend on rock-saturated bulk (ksat) and

shear (?sat) modulus according to the equations:

with S being the saturation and the subscripts standing for oil

and water.

The most commonly used approach to determine the rock

saturated bulk and shear modulus are the Gassmann equations

To compute the dry bulk and shear modulus, the known friable

or uncemented sand model (Mavko et al., 2003) is used in this

work. This model makes use of the Hertz–Mindlin contact theory

and a heuristic modified Hashin–Strikman lower bound, according

and Wang (1992) equations. The bulk densities ?o and ?w can also

be exported from the flow simulation and used as an input to

compute bulk fluid modulus. A summary can be found in Mavko

et al. (2003). Note that in this work it is assumed that there is no

presence of gas.

3.5. Synthetic seismic

The input unknowns for the petro-elastic modeling can be

single constants, or grid properties. The single constants can be

temperature, overburden pressure, mineral properties (bulk and

shear moduli, mineral density etc.) and fluid properties (salinity,

density etc.). For the dataset considered in this work, the only grid

properties used as input for the PEM are the porosity field, facies

location and the dynamic properties (pressure and saturation). In

other cases, it can have other parameters, such as, for instance,

net pay.

To build the synthetic P and S impedances, the petro-elastic

modeling is run using the reference model parameters. The same

forward modeling that is done within the inversion process (with

the base model properties) is previously applied to convert

simulated pressure and saturation (from the reference model)

into IP and IS for each simulation grid block. As the same PEM is

used in both situations, this work assumes that errors are not

being accounted for in the petro-elastic equations.

From the point of view of the inversion process, the most

important error/uncertainty assumed in the considered dataset

concerns the porosity field (Fig. 5), since this property has a high

influence when computing seismic attributes. A more detailed

discussion about the influence of noise/errors in the inversion

process is presented in Davolio et al. (2012). In this work, the

authors show that, for the PEM considered (the same one

considered here), porosity is the most influential attribute to

compute seismic impedances, but even if this property is not

totally known, it is still possible to estimate pressure and satura-

tion information from seismic data (provided that 4D data is used,

not 3D).

Two production times are considered in this work; the initial

time (before production starts) and after six years of production,

yielding a total of four impedance volumes representing the

seismic data (P and S impedances for each survey).

With the purpose of having the synthetic data closer to real

cases, an independent random noise of 1% of the average was

added to each P and S impedance volume. To avoid the high

frequency content that appears when computing time-lapse

differences from these noisy attributes, a 2D median filter was

applied to the noisy impedance volumes. Figs. 7 and 8 show the

time-lapse difference for the synthetic attributes generated before

and after disturbing them. Because of the median filter application,

the perturbation observed in the impedances present different

magnitudes for each reservoir location ranging from 1% to 50%, as

shown in Fig. 9.

The dataset used in this work does not take into account scale

differences between seismic and simulator data, which means that

reference and base models are at the same scale. Another

simplification made concerns the presence of gas, i.e., the dataset

corresponds to a water-flooding example (no presence of gas).

3.6. Multiple models: limits extraction

After combining all the uncertainties described in Section 3.2,

400 simulation models were generated. Each model was run using

a Black-Oil reservoir simulator and, for each model, pressure and

saturation values of each reservoir grid block were recorded. Then,

for each block, a vector with 400 values of saturation and pressure

was obtained, from which the minimum and maximum values

were extracted along all the 400 possibilities, as shown in Fig. 3.

Thus, these are the new limits used to constrain the solution space

of the inversion process; the results of this application are shown

in Section 4.2.

The well bottom-hole pressure curves (for four injector wells)

for the 400 simulated models are presented in Fig. 10, in red. They

represent the initial dispersion of the models. The green curves

represent the models closer to the history, after the application of

the exclusion criteria. In this case, a cut-off value of 20% was used.

This means that models with misfit greater than 20% with respect

to the more misadjusted model are discarded. The number of

models was then reduced to 64. The procedure of extracting

minimum and maximum values was repeated for this reduced

set of models and the results of using these limits in the inversion

are presented in Section 4.3.

4. Results and discussion

The inversion procedure was run for three different cases; for

each of them the optimization assumed different constraints for

the variables of pressure and saturation. In case 1, generic, or

usual, constraints were used. For the second case, new limits

extracted from the 400 models were used to constrain the solution

space; the same was done in case 3, considering only the 64

models that were selected according to the applied cut-off.

4.1. Case 1: inversion results using generic constraints

The constraints applied to pressure and saturation for the first

case were established according to known reservoir simulation

assumptions. For Sw the limits were the connate water saturation

(lower limit) and one minus residual oil saturation (upper limit).

For pressure, the injection pressure was used as the upper limit

and the minimum well bottom-hole as the lower limit. The

estimated pressure and saturation maps for the third layer can

be seen at the top of Fig. 11. The errors are displayed at the bottom

of the same image, computed through the difference: reference

?estimated.

Knowing that the true answer is displayed in Fig. 6a and c, it

could be said that the inversion did a good job, since the main

features were captured, especially for the pressure map, where a

nice improvement can be seen when compared to the initial guess

(Fig. 6d).

Clearly, the estimated maps present a noisy aspect due to the

errors presented in the synthetic seismic data, showing the

necessity for the proposed methodology to use engineering data

in order to minimize the noise influence on the estimated proper-

ties. These results are presented in the next section.

4.2. Case 2: inversion results using multiple models simulation

As mentioned previously, the combination of the uncertainties

produced 400 models. From the simulation results of all these

models, minimum and maximum values were extracted for

pressure and saturation for each reservoir block. Therefore, the

solution space of the optimization process is now constrained by

these limits. Following the same layout as Fig. 11, the improvement

of the estimated properties can be observed in Fig. 12 when these

new constraints are applied. Comparing the error maps in Figs. 11c

and 12c, a less noisy behavior of the new estimated saturation can

be noted. Observe that, especially for regions where the water was

not supposed to reach, the new estimated saturation map pre-

sented more corrected values.

Although not as pronounced as the saturation maps, the new

estimation of pressure has shown an improvement that can be

better observed by comparing Fig. 11d and Fig. 12d.

4.3. Case 3: inversion results using multiple model simulation

and well dynamic data

Reducing the number of simulation models by selecting only

the ones closest to the history data automatically produces stricter

limits to be used in the inversion process. As a result, it can be

observed in Fig. 13 that these new limits, computed from the 64

selected models, allowed a reduction in the observed errors for

both parameters (pressure and saturation).

Another way to compare the three results presented is by

looking at the images displayed in Fig. 14, that show the histo-

grams of water saturation and pressure errors for the three

inversion results (built using the data of Figs. 11c, d, 12c, d and

13c, d).

Fig. 14a clearly shows the largest concentration of values close

to zero for case 3 when compared to the other two cases,

indicating that the inversion constrained by the new limits

(obtained from 64 simulations) yielded the best results for

saturation. Another interesting feature observed is the gradual

improvement from case 1 to case 2 and then to case 3.

Although less pronounced, the same improvement can be

observed for the pressure errors in Fig. 14b. Again, case 3 presented

the largest concentration of points close to zero, indicating that

this is the best estimation of pressure.

4.4. Comments

The focus of the proposed methodology is to use flow simula-

tion information to guide the estimation of pressure and satura-

tion from 4D seismic. Its relevance remains in the calibration of

computed dynamic properties with flow conditions. This is an

innovative aspect, since the works presented in the literature

usually do not use engineering data (such as production profiles,

uncertainty analysis etc.) for quantitative interpretation of time-

lapse seismic anomalies.

It is important to emphasize that this work does not concern

reservoir uncertainties mitigation. Nor is it proposing a new

inversion technique to estimate the dynamic properties. Both

techniques (uncertainties analysis and inversion) are used as tools

to apply the proposed methodology.

The proposed methodology has the benefit of better exploring

4D seismic signals, since this helps in the quantification of the

saturation and pressure values by imposing limits that come from

flow simulation (considering uncertainties). The limits imposed by

the multiple models can, for instance, clean some areas in the

estimated water saturation map where, according to the simula-

tions, water should not have reached. This kind of result was

observed in the synthetic example presented.

Although the application of the proposed methodology was

successful for a synthetic model, there are some additional

challenges to be addressed in real data. In cases where the

uncertainty analysis is not done properly (e.g., having not taken

into account an unknown unknown), for instance, the methodol-

ogy might force the inversion limits to the boundaries. Therefore,

the next step of the proposed methodology would be to verify the

locations where this kind of behavior is observed and to evaluate

whether the time-lapse seismic or the uncertainty analysis has

some problems. This kind of integration will be useful, at least, to

verify if the uncertain attributes are being correctly represented,

and if the flow behavior, taking into account these uncertainties, is

in agreement with the time-lapse signals, which can be indicative

of the quality of the reservoir characterization.

5. Conclusions

A methodology to integrate time-lapse seismic data and

reservoir simulation has been proposed. The process uses multiple

simulation models, generated through the combination of uncer-

tain reservoir attributes, to derive limits for pressure and satura-

tion. These limits are later used to constrain an inversion scheme

for estimating the dynamic properties from 4D seismic, avoiding

values that are incompatible with flow conditions constrained by

the characterization process.

The methodology was applied to a synthetic dataset, yielding a

better estimation of the dynamic properties, especially for the

water saturation front. The use of well dynamic data to reduce the

models dispersion complemented the methodology, improving

the results even more. The important contribution of this work

remains in the quantitative use of available knowledge from

reservoir characterization and flow simulation, tying them to

observed changes in 4D seismic, and thus extracting, in a more

reliable way, changes due to production (pressure and saturation

changes).

The proposed methodology presented promising results, show-

ing that the integration between seismic and simulation data can

improve the reservoir dynamic properties characterization. It has

an innovative aspect in the sense that the works in the literature

concerning quantitative integration between the two different

datasets usually incorporate seismic attributes into the history

matching. Here, the proposal is to calibrate the 4D signals

response before running a history matching, in order to avoid

incorporating too much incorrect information into the matching.

Although an application of the estimated maps in a history

matching process was not presented here (which is the next step

in this type of methodology), what has been shown is that the

proposed methodology can yield more robust pressure and satura-

tion maps with less uncertainty, which can then be incorporated

quantitatively into the history matching process.

The application of this methodology was successful for a

synthetic model; however, there are some additional challenges

for real data. Future work should attempt to extend the methodol-

ogy to a statistical approach, in order to deal with more complex

cases. In this case, instead of extracting minimum and maximum

values, probability density functions (pdf) will be generated for

each reservoir block from both engineering and 4D seismic data.

The main idea is that by matching these pdfs, it will be possible to

more effectively integrate 4D seismic and reservoir simulation in

cases of greater complexity.

Abstract 
Nowadays there are several methodologies to incorporate quantitatively 4D seismic data in the history matching of reservoir 

simulation models. Most of them add a map attribute derived from 4D seismic, which can be impedance maps, saturations etc., in 

the objective function of the optimization process. In these cases, the goal is to match the dynamic information provided by 4D 

seismic with simulation response in the whole reservoir area, or the whole area covered by seismic data. In this work, it is 

proposed a history matching methodology that uses 4D seismic information locally for each injector (and the associated produc ers) 

individually, trying to match the water front movement related to each injector with the observed dynamic changes.  

In order to guarantee consistency with geology, the matching is done by combining static properties that comes from different  

simulation models. These models are generated through a combination of the most important uncertain parameters in an 

uncertainty analysis procedure, geologically consistent, that should be run previously. Then, the matching procedure is based  on 

the computation of the water saturation errors at some sub-regions defined around the injector  for multiple scenarios; the error is 

computed between water saturation derived from 4D seismic and each model simulation result. The models which presented the 

smallest error for each sub-region are selected and a new simulation model is built by combining the static properties extracted 

from the selected models at each sub-region. Before calculating the saturation errors the volume of water computed from 4D 

seismic is calibrated to the volume of injected water providing a more robust calibration. The methodology was applied to a 

synthetic case where porosity and permeability were the main uncertainties updated by the methodology proposed. Since these 

properties were generated through geostatistic realizations, the adjusted model kept the geological features. The promising results 

observed in the synthetic case showed that the methodology can be a good alternative for history matching, since it is an eas y to 

implement procedure and it does not require sophisticated optimization algorithms to incorporate 4D seismic into the process.  

 

Introduction 
Reservoir simulation is one of the main tools used for reservoir management. Thus, one of the main tasks of geologists and 

reservoir engineers is to build reliable models, which is not an easy task, due to the complexity present in this kind of problem. The 

complexity comes mainly from the lack of geological information needed to build such models. This issue can be minimized by 

matching dynamic data (well production, 4D seismic, etc) in a history matching procedure, which is an ill poised inversion process 

with several possible solutions. As it is a difficult and important task, several works can be found in the literature approaching the 

problem with different optimization algorithms, discussing how to use the dynamic data available to be matched and so on. There 

two relevant issues that has been subject of active research in the last ten years. One is the quantitative incorporation of 4D seismic 

data in the history matching procedure and the other is the development of history matching methodologies that generates models 

geologically consistent.  

The works of Caers (2003) and Hoffman and Caers (2005) are good examples of history matching methodologies geologically 

consistent. In Caers (2003) it is proposed the multiple-point geostatistics method where geological information is jointly integrate 

with well production data through a geological training image. An extension of this approach is presented in Hoffman and Caers 

(2005) where the authors propose a methodology to use the same kind of probability perturbation method (using the training 

     41

images) but now performing regional perturbations. Consequently, the reservoir can be split into regions and the method allows 

different amount of properties change for different parts of the model, being that no discontinuities are formed along the borders. 

The two methodologies mentioned above originally consider only well data to perform the matching, however an application of 

the probability perturbation method proposed by Caers (2003) that also includes 4D seismic data quantitatively can be seen in 

Castro et al (2009), for the Oseberg field, and Tolstukhin et al (2012) for the Ekofisk field.  

Landa and Kumar (2011) and Stephen et al (2005) are other examples of history matching process that consider well 

production and 4D seismic data jointly to perturb the model properties; their methodologies also keep the integration with 

geological information. Both of them perform the history matching with a probabilistic approach but with different algorithms. 

Landa and Kumar (2011) uses a Monte Carlo type sampling algorithm and Stephen et al (2005) uses the Neighbourhood 

Algorithm (NA). 

This work proposes a new methodology to run a local history matching using 4D seismic data quantitatively. Multiple models 

are used to perform the local matching in a simple process of comparing the errors between 4D seismic data and the reservoir 

model realizations. Differently of the methods usually find in the literature, as the one mentioned before, in the methodology 

proposed here no optimization process is performed. Another point is that it assumes that an uncertainty analysis was run 

previously so that it generated several model realizations. These realizations are used to update the reservoir properties, hence the 

model obtained after the matching will keep some geological consistence. In order to validate the methodology an application in a 

synthetic dataset is presented. The main contribution of this work remains in the simple approach proposed which can be an 

alternative to the sophisticated algorithms mentioned before.  

 

Methodology 

It is common nowadays to run statistical analysis to better understand the effect of uncertainties on reservoir behavior; as a 

result of this kind of procedure, several model realizations are generated by combining the most important uncertainties. The goal 

of the methodology proposed in this work is to harness these models together with 4D seismic to run a local history matching 

procedure that updates the reservoir properties without losing their geological aspect. The proposed approach aims to use the data 

provided by 4D seismic locally, by performing a local matching, considering each injector region, trying to adjust the movement of 

the water front.  

The 4D seismic data considered in this work consist of water saturation difference map (?4DSwseis), generated by an inversion 

process such as the one described in Davolio et al (2012a). Thus, the local matching is done by dividing the reservoir into regions 

according to the location of the injector wells and its correspondent water saturation error map observed. Then, local properties 

such as porosity, permeability etc., are modified in order to minimize water saturation errors between the data provided by 4D 

seismic and the simulation model. The local modification of the static properties is done by using several model realizations. A 

more detailed description of the whole matching process is presented below. Note that the operator ?4D stands for the time lapse 

difference:  property at time 1 – property at time 0 (time 0 and 1correspond to two seismic surveys). 

1- Simulate the n models generated by an uncertainty analysis procedure run previously and calculate the water saturation 

time lapse difference for each model (?4DSwsim_i, for i=1:n); 

2- Simulate the base model and calculate the water saturation time lapse difference (?4DSwbase); 
3- Compute water saturation error map of the base model:  

                             ;      (1) 
4- Select an injector well and define regions around it according to the error map computed in step 3; 
5- For each region and each of the n model realization calculate the quadratic error: 

   ?           
   

         
   

      ,     (2) 

being that i,j,k are the block coordinates inside the region. 

6- For each region select the model which presents the smallest quadratic error computed in step 5; 
7- For the models selected in step 6, cut the local properties inside each region; 
8- Replace the base model properties inside each region for the properties extracted in step 7; 
9- Simulate the new base model and analyze the error map (equation 1), if the errors are acceptable select another injector 

and go to step 2, if not, redefine de regions and go back to step 5. 

In order to use water saturation maps provided by 4D seismic data quantitatively, as described above, it is important to 

calibrate this information with engineering data. In this sense, an additional procedure is run before the step 3 defined above. It 

consists of computing the amount of injected water according to the water saturation map provided by 4D seismic and dividing this 

value by the known volume of injected water. The result is a correction factor that should be applied to the 4D seismic data by 

dividing the water saturation map by this number. 

Another important fact to highlight is that the methodology described above should be used for local properties, so if there are 

global properties, such as relative permeability, that plays an important role in the reservoir response, then a global matching 

should be applied before starting the local matching. 

     42



SPE 164883-MS  3 

Since it is not the focus of this work to perform a complex global match, a simple manual matching procedure based only in 

well data is proposed. The procedure treats each set of global property at a time and it consists of building hundreds of models 

through the derivative tree technique (Schiozer et al, 2004), where all the levels of one set of parameters are combined. Then, the 

quadratic error between each well production curve of each model and history data is computed according to the equation: 

       ?            
  

   ,       (3) 

where m is the number of production data and obs is the history. After that, for each model is calculated an average of the 

quadratic error of all wells, then the 20 models (which correspond to 10% of the amount of models used in this work) that 

produced the smallest average are selected. Finally a histogram showing the frequency of occurrence of each level for the 20 

selected models is built and the analysis of the histograms indicates the value (defined by the levels) that should give the best 

match. Once a parameter is adjusted the model keeps this value and the procedure is repeated for the next global parameter to be 

matched. 

One more thing to comment about the methodology proposed concerns the different scales of simulation and seismic data. In 

the data considered in this work, this is not an issue because the synthetic 4D seismic was generated at the simulation scale. 

However, in more realistic cases, this issue needs to be addressed; the simplest way would be to convert seismic data to the 

simulation scale. The efficiency of the methodology will depend on how much information is left after the scale transfer. 

 

Application 

The data required to apply the proposed methodology are 4D seismic data (converted to water saturation maps), the reservoir 

simulation model (base model) and the multiple model realizations resulted from an uncertainty analysis. This work uses a 

synthetic dataset, so, apart from the base model and the multiple realizations, there is also the reference model that represents the 

true earth model used to check the accuracy of the history matching proposed. This model was also used to generate the synthetic 

4D seismic, which was disturbed by adding some noise. Follow bellow the description of all the data used. 

Reservoir model description 

The reservoir model considered in this work was discretized in a corner-point grid with 90?110?5 blocks, 60m in size in x and 

y direction (5400 ? 6600m) and 15m (on the average) in z direction. There are three facies characterized according to three 

permeability ranges. The reservoir also comprises four faults, as can be seen in figure 1. The reservoir is drained by eight vertical 

producer wells, supported by seven water injector wells.

Model uncertainties 

There are a total of ten uncertain parameters considered in this work, being that eight of them are defined as multipliers as 

follow: 

? Four faults transmissibility; 

? Relative permeability curves (Corey exponents for the water phase) for each of the three facies; 

? Permeability ratio (vertical/horizontal). 
The other two uncertain parameters are porosity and permeability; both were generated by geostatistical techniques. Using the 

sequential Gaussian simulation technique (SGS), 200 realizations of porosity were generated having the seismic P-impedance 

volume at time 0 (base survey) as a secondary variable. Each of these porosity fields was used later as a second variable for  the 

SGS to generate 200 realizations of permeability. 

Base and reference model 

The differences of the base and reference models are the 10 uncertainties described above. The base model was built by a 

random combination of the ten uncertainties described above. The values of the parameters, for both models, defined as multipliers 

     43

are presented in table 1. The other two uncertainties are the porosity and permeability fields that can be seen on figure 2. The 

reference model properties were not built by the same geostatistic procedure mentioned before, i.e., they do not belong to the set of 

200 realizations. Thus it can be observed relevant differences in the images especially for permeability.

Saturation from 4D seismic data 

The 4D seismic data used in the history matching is the estimated volume (it is not a map because in this synthetic dataset the 

seismic data has the same scale of the simulation model, i.e., 5 layers) of the time lapse difference of water saturation. The base 

survey (time 0) corresponds to the initial reservoir state, before production start and the second seismic survey corresponds to the 

reservoir after 6 years of production. The estimation of water saturation differences was made by an inversion process conditioned 

to flow conditions according to the methodology described in Davolio et al (2012b) and it is shown in figure 3b. Due to the noise 

added to the synthetic seismic data the estimated water saturation front presents some errors (figure 3c) when compared to the true 

answer given by the reference model (figure 3a).

Global matching 

The case considered in this work has two important global properties: relative permeability (kr) and faults transmissibility. As 

mentioned before, in the global matching these two parameters are treated individually. In this work the procedure starts with the 

faults transmissibility. Four levels are considered for the four faults: level 0= 0, level 1= 0.001, level 2= 0.01 and level 3= 1. Thus, 

256 models are created by combining all the possibilities through the derivative tree technique. Then, the quadratic error (equation 

3) of the Bottom Hole Pressure (BHP) curves of each model for each well is computed. Although fault transmissibility is a global 

parameter, its influence is limited to some wells. The consequences of changing the transmissibility of fault 1, for instance, will not 

interfere considerably the production of PROD5. So, for each fault only the closer wells are considered to compute the average of 

the quadratic error. The well selected for each fault are: 

? Fault 1: INJ1,INJ2,INJ3,INJ7,PROD1,PROD2,PROD3; 

? Fault 2: INJ3,INJ6,PROD3,PROD4,PROD6,PROD8; 

? Fault 3: INJ4, INJ5, PROD6; 

? Fault 4: INJ4, PROD5 
Hence, taking fault 1 as an example, the average of the quadratic error of only the 7 wells defined above is computed for each 

of the 256 models. Then, the 20 models that gave the smallest quadratic error are selected to do the histogram analysis. The same 

procedure is valid for the other three faults.

Once the faults transmissibility of the base model are updated, the next step is to repeat the same procedure for relative 

permeability. In this case five levels for the Corey exponent was considered, the values are: level 0= 1, level 1= 2, level 2= 3, level 

3= 4 and level 4= 5. As there are three facies, after combining all the uncertainties levels through the derivative tree technique, 125 

models are created. In this case the quadratic error is computed using the water rate curves (Qw). After that, it is calculated an 

average of the quadratic error of all the 8 producer wells for each of the 125 models. And, again the 20 models that gave the 

smallest quadratic error are selected to do the histogram analysis. Note that, although some trend can be observed for the facies 

logs at the well location, it is not coherent to select the wells according to that for each facies (as it was done with the faults), 

because the flow depends on the facies in a neighborhood of the well not only at its position (the flow in a given facies influences 

wells located in other facies). This explains why all the 8 wells are considered simultaneously in this analysis. 

 

Results 

Global matching 

The histograms shown in figure 4 were built using the 20 models selected by the average of the quadratic error of the BHP 

curves of the corresponding selection for each fault. Analyzing the results it can be said that for the faults 1, 3 and 4 the level 3 

should be used, which correspond to a transmissibility multiplier value of 1 and that for fault 2 the most frequent level is 1, 

denoting that the transmissibility multiplier value for this fault should be 0.001. 

 

 
Figure 4: Frequency of occurrence of each level of transmissibility for the four faults: (a) fault 1, (b) fault 2, (c) fault 3 and (d) fault 4. 

 

Following the analysis of the best 20 models, but in this case for Qw curves, the second global match (for Kr) done produces 

the histogram displayed in figure 5. From the histograms it can be said that for facie 1 there is nothing to conclude since the 

frequency of occurrence of the 5 levels of the Corey exponent are similar, so the value of the base model is kept. For facies 2, the 

results indicate level 2, so the Corey exponent is set as 3. For facies 3 the Corey exponent is 1, corresponding to level 0.

Local matching 

Now that the global properties are updated the proposed methodology for the local matching can be applied. One of the input 

data for the local matching is the set of model realizations that come from the uncertainty analysis. Let’s consider that the global 

matching done previously reduced the uncertainties, so the faults transmissibility and the relative permeability curves are fixed 

now and. Since the ratio kz/kx is not such an important parameter for this model, the remaining uncertainties are porosity and 

absolute permeability. Thus, the number of model realizations is 200, being that the only difference between them are the 

correlated porosity and permeability fields. To start the local matching the first procedure is to analyze the error map of the time 

lapse difference of the water saturation provided by 4D seismic and the one computed from the base model (with the global 

properties updated). 

 
Figure 6: Error map between the data provided by 4D seismic and the base model after the global matching: ?4DSwseis-?4DSwbase_global. (a) 
Layer 3. (b) Layer 4. (c) Layer 5. 

 

In the dataset used in this work seismic data is at the simulation scale, so this information is available at all the five layers of 

the model. Figure 6 shows the error map for the last three layers, which are the ones containing more water. From figure 6 it can be 

verified that the main water saturation error observed are related to the injectors: INJ3, INJ4, INJ5 and INJ1. Thus, these wells 

were selected to perform the local matching in order to update the porosity and permeability fields of the base model. Since the 

well INJ3 has a central location, its water front could reach several wells, so this injector was the first one used to define the 

regions where the properties should be modified. Four regions were defined around it, see in figure 7 regions R1a, R1b, R1c and 

R1d; being that each of them includes one producer: PROD1, PROD3, PROD6 and PROD8, respectively. Then, the other 3 

regions seen in figure 7 (R2, R3 and R4) were also defined by including the corresponding producer of each injector as well as 

analyzing the error observed in the maps. Note that the regions should not overlap. The next step of the methodology is to compute 

the quadratic error (equation 2) within each region for the 200 models and then to update porosity and permeability inside each 

region by replacing these properties of the base model by the ones presented in the models that yielded the smallest quadratic error. 

Before computing the quadratic error of the time lapse difference of water saturation maps, the data provided by 4D seismic s hould 

be calibrated with the volume of injected water. Although this is an important step of the methodology the tests for this case did 

not present good results and some improvements need to be done to better evaluate volume differences. 
 

Figure 7: Regions where the local matching is performed. 
 

The definition of the regions depends on the error map observed which depends on the resolution of the 4D seismic data. In 

this work the 4D data has the same vertical scale of the simulation model, so the regions can also be defined vertically. After some 

     46



SPE 164883-MS  7 

tests it was verified that for some of the regions a much better matching was reached when each of these regions was split into 

five, i.e, each layer is considered as another region. This kind of sub-division was made in the regions R3 and R4. Thus, for these 

two regions the quadratic error was computed for each layer separately which means that the properties (porosity and permeability) 

update for different layers can come from different models. For the regions around INJ3 (R1a, R1b, R1c, R1d) and around INJ1 

(R2) the quadratic error was computed considering all the five layers together, so if, for instance, the model 37 was the one which 

presented the smallest error for the region R2 then the porosity and permeability values of the base model was replaced (just inside 

the region) by the ones from model 37 in all layers.

model (d), the reference model (e) and the base model after the local matching (f). All the images correspond to the fourth model layer. 

Figures 8c and 8f show the results of the local matching for permeability and porosity, respectively. In the same figure it is 

possible to check how the properties were modified by comparing with the base model images (figures 8a and 8d) and also to 

check if the results are closer to the reference model (figures 8b and 8e). It is important to note that the reference model properties 

were not generated through the same geostatistics procedure, more than that, all the 200 realizations of porosity and permeability 

are not very close to the reference model ones, especially for permeability, this explain the big difference between these properties 

and the ones of the base model. Another point to highlight is that the procedure tries to match the water saturation information that 

comes from 4D seismic which has some noise included, so the match cannot be perfect. Apart from these issues it is still possible 

to identify some similarities between the reference model properties and the ones updated after the local matching. An example is 

the zone of high permeability observed in the region R1c (figure 8c) that is better defined than the one of the base model. Another 

example is the low porosity zone between INJ1 and PROD2 that is also improved after the local matching.  

Even not having a perfect agreement between the properties of the reference model and the model after the history matching, a 

substantial improvement can be verified in the error maps of water saturation. The images of figure 9 show the initial error maps, 

i.e., the error between the data provided by 4D seismic and the initial base model. Note that the white areas observed inside the 

reservoir correspond to points where the error is outside the range of the color scale [-0.35, 0.35], so these areas present the biggest 

errors. Following the same layout of figure 9, figures 10 and 11 display the results of the global matching  and  the final history 

matching performed (global+local), respectively. After the global matching (figure 10) some improvement can be observed in the 

error maps, but the error decrease of water saturation is actually relevant after the application of the local matching (figure 11). 

Although some errors can still be observed in the maps of figure 11, the local matching performed presented satisfactory results 

correcting the water front movement of the injectors selected. Note that the level of error reduction was similar for all the regions 

defined, this shows that the regions delimitation can be coarser like region R2 (defined as a regular region), or it can be more 

refined as it was done for regions R3 and R4 where the vertical subdivision was applied turning them into 5 sub-regions each. The 

choice of how to define the regions is then made according to the error observed and the resolution of the data available.

Figure 12 shows the histogram of the water saturation errors presented in figures 9, 10 and 11. This is just another way (a 

quantitative measure) to verify the improvement already observed in the error maps. The bigger concentration of values around 

zero together with the smaller concentration of higher errors, are confirming the improvement obtained after applying the local 

history matching. 

Figures 13 and 14 show the pressure and production curves for some wells, including the forecast period (marked by the 

magenta line), remembering that the history matching was performed in 1996. In both figures it is possible to verify that the global 

matching presented better curves then the initial model. As the global match did a good job, few improvements were obtained in 

the curves after the application of the local matching.  In this sense, the BHP curves presented in figures 13 show a pretty similar 

behavior between the global and global+local matching. For the water rate curves (figure 14) there are slightly differences between 

the two adjusted models like, for instance, well PROD2 had its breakthrough corrected and PROD8  presented a better forecast 

behavior after the local matching. 

The improvement in the water rate curves is mainly in the forecast period since the water had not reached the majority of the 

wells during the history (1990-1996); this behavior is also observed for the producers not shown here due to the limited space. It is 

important to highlight that even if a not so relevant improvement is observed in the production curves during the history period, the 

local matching, that diminish the errors observed in the maps, is still very important especially when new wells need to be planned 

since the necessity of reliable map information becomes more latent.   

Final comments 

The methodology proposed is a simple way to perform a history matching using quantitatively the information provided by 4D 

seismic. A good feature to highlight is that the procedure aims to harness the results of an uncertainty analysis run previously by a 

simple procedure of comparing water saturation errors of the several model realizations available, followed by a “cut and paste” 

property update. As a result, geological inconsistencies can be avoided. Thus, it is a simple way to incorporate geological 

uncertainties without running sophisticated algorithms like the ones proposed by Caers (2003), Caers and Hoffman (2005) and 

Stephen et al (2005). A pitfall of the methodology is that it does not ensure continuity in the boundaries of the regions and in some 

cases the geostatistic properties can be missed. One way to minimize this issue would be to delineate the regions according to 

     49



10  SPE 164883-MS 

geological structures, instead of doing it based only on well location and error map. But, even though, the method will not 

guarantee total geostatistic coherence as the one proposed by Caers and Hoffman (2005), for instance, so it can be improved in 

future work. 

Another feature of the methodology is that although this work considers 4D seismic data in the form of water saturation maps 

the methodology could be applied with another seismic attribute like acoustic impedance, for instance. Clearly, it would require an 

extra work which includes the conversion of simulation data to impedance and a previous study to match time lapse differences of 

impedance with water movement. In a way, the second issue is already addressed here when water saturation information is 

extracted from 4D seismic through an inversion process. So, the main point to add is the creation of impedances for all the 

simulation models used. 

The synthetic dataset used in this work does not presented too much challenges with respect to the uncertainties of the model, 

in a sense that they were all known uncertainties (even porosity and permeability had their geostatisc parameters not very far from 

the true) and just their values needed to be calibrated. However in more complex cases the uncertainties can be more difficult to 

define. Thus, 4D seismic could be first used in a qualitative way to better map these unknowns, after that a more consistent 

uncertainty analysis can be run yielding in better defined model realizations to be used in the local matching proposed in this work, 

when 4D seismic is quantitatively used. Another drawback of the lack of challenges regarding the uncertainties is that no much 

improvement could be seen in the production curves between the global and local matching applied. Again, in more realistic cases 

a good well history matching (and forecast) can be not so easy to reach and the local matching can be as important as it is for the 

error map reduction. 

In general, the application of the methodology produced promising results, having as a main point the reduction of the water 

saturation errors by a simple procedure that yields model properties with some geological consistence.  

  

Conclusion 
A methodology that uses 4D seismic information to perform a local history matching was proposed. The main point to highlight is 

the simple way to incorporate uncertainties without running sophisticated algorithms. Moreover, after the match, geological 

features of the updated reservoir properties can be kept. In the application shown the history matching was done in two steps, 

firstly a calibration of the global properties of initial model was made by using well production curves. After that the local 

matching was performed incorporating 4D seismic information quantitatively. The results obtained with a synthetic dataset showed 

promising results with a significant improvement of the map information. There are two improvements that can be done in future 

works, one concerns the water volume calibration between seismic and simulation data and the other would be to investigate 

possible ways of guarantee geostatistic consistence in the borders of the regions.

Abstract 

Time-lapse seismic data can be used to estimate saturation changes within a reservoir. This 

is valuable information for reservoir management, as it can play an important role in 

reservoir simulation models updating. The process of updating reservoir properties, so-

called history matching, can incorporate estimated saturation changes qualitatively or 

quantitatively. Especially for quantitative approaches, it is important to have reliable 

information from 4D seismic. Thus, in this work, a methodology to calibrate the volume of 

water present in the estimated saturation maps is proposed, as saturation maps can be 

wrongly estimated due to problems related to seismic signals (such as noise, errors 

associated to data processing and resolution issues). The idea is to condition the 4D seismic 

data to known information provided by engineering, in this case the known amount of 

injected water in the field. The application of the proposed methodology in an inversion 

process (previously published) that estimates saturation from 4D is presented, followed by a 

discussion concerning the use of such data in a history matching process. To validate the 

results, the methodology is applied to a synthetic dataset. The main results are: (1) a better 

estimation of saturation, namely reduction of noise and errors effects, yielding more reliable 

data to be used quantitatively or qualitatively and (2) an improvement in the properties 

update after using this data in a history matching procedure.

1. Introduction 

Time-lapse seismic is becoming an important tool for reservoir monitoring as it provides a 

better understanding of the dynamic properties variations due to production within the reservoir. 

This is valuable information because it can be used to update reservoir models, which are an 

important tool for reservoir management (optimization strategy, planning infill drillings among 

others). There are several works in the literature showing successful use of 4D seismic (Johann et 

al, 2009, Tolstukhin et al, 2012, Castro et al, 2009).  

The integration between 4D seismic and reservoir simulation is still a topic of intense 

research. There are several approaches that can be used, from qualitative interpretation of 4D 

seismic anomalies (Johann et al, 2009) that are further incorporated into reservoir simulation 

models, to quantitative use of 4D seismic data in an objective function of a history matching 

procedure (Brito et al, 2010, Landa and Kumar, 2011). Another branch of possibilities is the domain 

of integration of the two data, which can be generalized into three options: amplitude, impedance, 

saturation and pressure domains.  

To perform the integration in the saturation and pressure domain, which is the focus of this 

work, it is necessary to estimate these properties from seismic amplitudes or impedances. Different 

methodologies can be applied to estimate saturation and pressure from 4D seismic attributes 

(Landro 2001, Lumley et al 2003, MacBeth et al 2006, Davolio et al 2012). Their differences 

concern the type of seismic attribute used to estimate the dynamic changes and how the data is 

manipulated to obtain these estimations.  

Although these methodologies could be applied to any field that holds enough seismic data 

(usually pre-stack data is needed for base and monitor surveys), there are still some challenges to 

overcome concerning seismic signal related problems (such as noise, tuning and uncertainties in 

rock properties).  

Thus, in order to be able to extract more reliable information from time-lapse seismic 

signals, another source of information can be used, for instance, engineering data (well production 

profiles, reservoir simulation data). Engineering data, such as reservoir simulation results, are 

normally used in forward modeling for feasibility studies, or to help in the understanding of 

observed 4D seismic anomalies. However, there are few works that effectively use this type of 

     56



 

 

information to constrain the estimation of dynamic properties from 4D seismic. The work of Huang 

et al (2011) is an example of such application; in this work the authors demonstrated that well 

production data (predominantly used for history matching) can be used to constrain the observed 4D 

seismic data and as a result, more robust information is extracted from seismic signals. Toinet et al 

(2011) can be cited as another example; in this case, the authors presented a workflow to perform a 

4D pre-stack inversion that is constrained by a range of elastic properties variations computed from 

reservoir simulation results. In addition, reservoir model information was also included as a 

constraint to better locate water-bearing sands. Davolio et al (2013a) also presented a methodology 

that uses reservoir simulation results to constrain dynamic estimation from 4D seismic. But, 

different from Toinet et al (2011), in the work of Davolio et al (2013a), the constraints are used in a 

petro-elastic inversion that estimates saturation and pressure from seismic impedances.  

The current work inclines toward the idea of using engineering information to constrain the 

estimation of dynamic properties from 4D seismic. More specifically, this work proposes a 

methodology to correct the volume of water present in estimated saturation maps from 4D seismic, 

based on the known volume of injected water in the field. This type of calibration is important, 

especially when employing a quantitative use of the estimated properties in a history matching 

procedure, since poor estimates used as input can lead to incorrect model updating. The volume 

calibration proposed here can be applied to saturation maps estimated from 4D seismic through one 

of the techniques mentioned previously. In this work, the saturation maps are estimated by the 4D 

petro-elastic inversion constrained to flow conditions proposed by Davolio et al (2013a). After 

analyzing the results of the calibration, a discussion about the importance of this type of information 

as input to a history matching procedure is also presented. To validate and demonstrate the benefits 

of the proposed methodology, the results are shown with synthetic data.  

 

2. Methodology 

The methodology presented here aims to calibrate the volume of injected water present in the 

water saturation (Sw) maps provided by 4D seismic with the known volume of injected water. The 

calibration is performed by applying a multiplicative correction factor in the Sw map provided by 

4D seismic. The calibrated Sw values should belong to a feasible range, which is defined by the 

methodology proposed by Davolio et al (2013a). So, prior to running the volume calibration, it is 

necessary to estimate this range. 

As displayed in figure 1, the methodology used to compute the feasible range starts by 

combining all the “n” uncertainties, or the most important “n” uncertainties of the reservoir model. 

Thus, “m” model realizations are created and simulated. Then, for each reservoir block, the range 

of possible values is defined by extracting the minimum and maximum Sw value along all the “m” 

possibilities. Therefore, the range [Swmin Swmax] is defined according to the flow conditions and is 

consistent with the current characterization stage. This range is defined to the production time 

corresponding to the monitor seismic survey. Note that, according to figure 1, the same procedure 

was applied for pressure. However, the current work only uses the limits for Sw. 

After estimating the range [Swmin Swmax] for every grid block of the model, the volume 

calibration can be performed. Bellow, a detailed workflow of the volume calibration procedure is 

proposed: 

1. Compute the amount of injected water (in reservoir conditions) present in 4D seismic data 

according to equation 1:

where nb is the number of blocks of the model, ? is the porosity, Vb is the block volume,

where Vinj  is the known volume of injected water, Vprod is the known volume of produced

6. Verify if the calibrated Sw belongs to the feasible range:

7. If inequality 6 holds, then the value of the current reservoir block (ith block) is set by 

equation 5, set i=i+1 and return to step 4; else go to step 8.

The steps 2 to 9 can be repeated until a satisfactory volume calibration is reached, namely until 

CF-1 &amp;lt;tolerance. Another point to highlight is that the steps 1 to 9 can be applied to the whole 

reservoir or to different reservoir zones, independently. 

There are some assumptions to be considered when applying the methodology proposed above: 

? 4D seismic data are at the same scale of the reservoir simulation model. Therefore, for real 

data, an upscaling/downscaling procedure is required to convert data from seismic scale to 

flow simulation scale. 

? 4D base survey was acquired in the pre-production period, so that the time-lapse difference 

of saturation provides information about the volume of injected water. 

? No presence of an aquifer. 

 

3. Application 

To evaluate the results of the proposed methodology, all data used in this work are synthetic, as 

described in the following sections.  

The application of the proposed volume calibration procedure is divided into two parts. The 

first part presents a discussion of the volume calibration on the estimated Sw map from 4D seismic. 

     58



 

 

Then, the second part shows the importance of using a calibrated Sw map in a history matching 

procedure.

representations of the reservoir uncertainty and „Model 1?, „Model 2? and „Model m? are generic 

reservoir models, generated from the combination of the reservoir uncertainties (extracted from 

Davolio et al, 2013a). 

 

3.1. Synthetic dataset construction 

This section presents a brief description of the synthetic dataset used in this work, which is the 

same as that used in Davolio et al (2013a, b); see these references for more details. Some 

simplifications of these dataset are: 

? All data (seismic and reservoir simulation) are at the same scale, which corresponds to 

a grid with 90x110x5 blocks. Thus, all simulation models used in this work have this 

grid. 

? Initial Sw is considered known (with good estimation of water-oil contact and capillary 

pressure). 

? The seismic data considered here are composed of P and S impedances for two surveys 

(base and monitor). These impedances were generated by a forward modeling through a 

petro-elastic model that uses reservoir simulation results and static properties, such as 

porosity, from the reference simulation model (described below). 

 

3.1.1. Reference simulation model and seismic data 

This model represents the true earth model. The static and dynamic model properties 

represent the answer that the methodologies should reach. Thus, for instance, the closer the 

estimated Sw map (from 4D seismic) is to the simulation results of the reference model, the better it 

is. In the same way, when history matching is applied, it is desired that the updated static properties 

get closer to those of the reference model. Besides validating the results, the reference model is also 

used to generate the seismic. The seismic dataset is composed of four volumes of impedances, P 

     59



 

 

and S impedances for two production times (pre-production and 6 years of production). A random 

noise was added to the impedances, which can be observed in figure 4. The impedances were 

generated through a petro-elastic model considering the unconsolidated sand model (Mavko et al, 

2003) that is described in Davolio et al (2013a). Note that the seismic data considered here are not 

originated from a pre-stack inversion, as no amplitudes were generated.  

 

3.1.2. Reservoir uncertainties  

Reservoir static properties can be divided into two categories: global and local. The former 

have a global influence on the reservoir, meaning that changes in these properties affect the flow 

behavior of the whole reservoir (or of a large area of it). The latter have a local effect, i.e., regional 

changes affect regional flow (around a well, for instance). 

The global uncertainties of the dataset used here are fault transmissibility, relative 

permeability (represented by the Corey exponent) and permeability ratio (vertical/horizontal). The 

local uncertainties are porosity and horizontal permeability. 

The focus of this work is the use of a Sw map to update the reservoir model?s properties. 

Here we propose to use this type of information to update static properties locally, following the 

history matching methodology presented by Davolio et al (2013b). Before running a local matching, 

the global uncertainties need to be calibrated. Thus, this work assumes that this calibration has 

already been performed, as described by Davolio et al (2013b); table 1 shows the true values  and 

the results obtained. Therefore, only local properties (porosity and horizontal permeability) are 

being assumed as uncertainties in this work. Using the Sequential Gaussian Simulation technique 

(SGS), 200 realizations of porosity were generated, having the seismic P-impedance volume (base 

survey) as a secondary variable. Each of these porosity fields was later used as a second variable for 

the SGS to generate 200 realizations of permeability (figure 2). Each pair of porosity and 

permeability images was used to generate 200 simulation models. Although the characterization 

process was not perfect, as it can be seen in table 1 and by comparing figure 2 with figure 5c, the 

mapping of the uncertainties yielded a satisfactory dispersion in the well production curves. On the 

top of figure 3, the field average pressure and water rate are displayed for all the 200 models and the 

history; on the bottom of the same figure the bottom hole pressure (BHP) curves are displayed for 

two wells.  

One important aspect to consider when using several simulation models to constrain 4D 

seismic information is to ensure that production curves dispersion comprise the history data like the 

ones shown in figure 3. If a poor uncertainty characterization is performed, generating models that 

do not comprise the history data (e.g. all models bellow the history curve), the constraints applied to 

the 4D seismic lead to biased estimations. In the case studied, the proper uncertainties mapping 

performed was important to improve the estimation of saturation and pressure, as discussed in the 

following sections.

3.1.3.  Base simulation model  

This model represents the knowledge available regarding the reservoir and needs to be 

history-matched. The base model was built by a random combination of the uncertainties described 

above, differencing it from the reference model. The global uncertainties of these models are 

already calibrated with well production data (Davolio et al, 2013b) as displayed in table 1. Figure 5 

shows the porosity and permeability images for the reference and base model; these properties are 

calibrated with 4D seismic data, as described in the results. 

 

3.2. Estimating Sw from 4D seismic 

The water saturation map used in this work was estimated by a 4D petro-elastic inversion 

procedure described in Davolio et al (2013a). The inversion is carried out by an optimization 

process and is performed for each simulation block, independently. As discussed in Davolio et al 

(2012), this is an optimization problem with only two unknowns (pressure and saturation for each 

     61



 

 

block) with a well-behaved objective function. So, a gradient-type algorithm is used to search for 

the solution within the defined solution space.   

 The input data for the inversion are the time-lapse differences of the noisy synthetic P and S 

impedances (figures 4c, d). Another important input of the petro-elastic inversion is the porosity 

field which, in this work, was extracted from the base model (figure 5b). Thus, there are three 

important sources of errors in the estimation of Sw: the wrong estimative of porosity and 

overburden pressure and the presence of noise in seismic impedances. The same petro-elastic 

modeling used to generate the synthetic impedances was used in the inversion process, so no errors 

are being assumed in this modeling.

impedance. (b) S-impedance. Time-lapse difference of the synthetic seismic attributes after noise

Three inversions were performed (case 1, 2 and 3) in order to highlight different steps of the 

calibration of 4D seismic information with reservoir simulation results. The calibrations performed 

are related to the delimitation of the solution space of the petro-elastic inversion process. Thus, the 

differences among the three cases are: 

Case 1: the inversion procedure is performed with “general constraints”, meaning that the 

solution space is defined by the limits: Swc&lt;Sw&lt;1-Sor and PreProdMin&amp;lt;Pre&lt;PreInjMax.  

Case 2: the solution space is defined by the minimum and maximum values [Swmin Swmax] and 

[Premin Premax] estimated by the methodology proposed in Davolio et al (2013a) that is schematically 

presented in figure 1. By applying this methodology, the estimated dynamic properties are 

conditioned to the flow conditions according to the reservoir uncertainties characterization stage.  

     62



 

 

Case 3: in this case, the calibration of the volume of water proposed in this work is applied. 

Note that the methodology proposed in this work is using the constraints applied in case 2 ([Swmin 

Swmax]). Indeed, this work can be seen as an improvement of the methodology proposed in Davolio 

et al (2013a). 

 

3.3. History matching 

The importance of having calibrated water saturation maps estimated from 4D seismic is the 

incorporation of such data in a history matching procedure, especially in a quantitative way.  The 

history matching procedure applied in this work was proposed by Davolio et al (2013b). The 

methodology uses 4D seismic information to perform a local matching. The water saturation map 

estimated from 4D seismic is used as an input to update local properties, such as porosity and 

permeability, within regions defined around the injector wells. Several model realizations constitute 

other input data, which, in this work, are the same “m” models mentioned before (figure 1). 

The local matching starts by dividing the reservoir into regions according to the location of the 

injector wells and their observed corresponding water saturation error anomaly (figure 6). Then, a 

simple process of comparing the errors between 4D seismic data and the reservoir model 

realizations is performed within each region. The models that present the smallest error for each 

region are selected and a new simulation model is built by a procedure of “copy and paste” of the 

static properties (porosity and permeability) extracted from the selected models at each region, a 

process similar to building a patchwork. 

 

 

Figure 6: Workflow of the local history matching methodology. 

It is important to highlight that before performing this local history matching, the global 

uncertainties of the reservoir need to be calibrated. As mentioned before, the dataset considered 

here has its global parameters already matched. The results can be seen in Davolio et al (2013b), 

     63



 

 

where a methodology that uses well production data was proposed and applied. A satisfactory 

match for the global uncertainties was reached, although the process was not able to recover the 

reference model values perfectly. Even so, the global uncertainties were set with the updated values 

and only local uncertainties needs to be matched. Therefore, the “m” model realizations are only 

accounting for the local properties (porosity and permeability), yielding a total of 200 models 

(m=200). 

This local history matching procedure was applied to three cases, the only difference among 

them being the input Sw map: 

LHM1 = local history matching using as input the estimated Sw map from case 1;  

LHM2 = local history matching using as input the estimated Sw map from case 2; 

LHM3 = local history matching using as input the estimated Sw map from case 3.  

For cases 2 and 3, the limits [Swmin Swmax] were extracted from the 200 simulation results. 

 

4. Results 

The volume calibration methodology was applied to the whole reservoir, meaning that all the 

correction factor calculations considered the volume of water present in the whole reservoir.  

 

4.1. Estimating Sw from 4D seismic 

As mentioned in section 2, steps 2 to 9 of the volume calibration proposed can be repeated until 

a satisfactory calibration is reached. In this work, 15 iterations were enough to reach a good 

calibration. Figure 7 shows the performance of the volume calibration. The iterations correspond to 

the execution of steps 2 to 9. The first correction factor computed was: CF = 

(4.24x10
7
)m

3
/(3.03x10

7
)m

3
 ? 1.4. Thus, after the first iteration, the calibrated volume was 

?3.32x10
7
 m

. This new volume yielded a CF?1.09. After applying this second CF, the new volume 

was ?3.18x10
7
 m

3
 and so on until the 15

th
 iteration that yielded CF-1=10

-4
. Therefore, after 15 

iterations, a satisfactory volume calibration was reached for this case.

Figure 8 shows the estimated water saturation map for the three inversions performed and the 

water saturation map yielded from the simulation of the reference model, which represents the 

answer that the inversions aim to reach. The same figure also shows the respective error map of the 

three inversion results. Due to the noise added to seismic impedances and the wrong porosity used 

as inputs for the petro-elastic inversion, the results of case 1 presented a noisier aspect that is clearly 

seen in the error map. Note that there is a zone with high errors, indicated by a red arrow; the white 

region in the error map means that the error is out of scale (bigger than 0.2). The main causes of this 

error are the low porosity region that was wrongly characterized (compare figures 5a and 5b) 

together with wrong pressure values; remember that the petro-elastic inversion estimates saturation 

and pressure, simultaneously. Figure 9 follows the same layout of figure 8 but showing the 

estimations of pressure for cases 1 and 2; the same noisy behavior of case 1 previously mentioned is 

observed for pressure as well. In the same way, the region with the highest errors marked in the Sw 

map presents a high error for pressure too.

right, the reference model (answer), the estimated Sw map for cases 1 to 3. Bottom: from left to 

right, the error (reference – estimated) for the three estimations. Layer 3. 

When the estimation of Sw is constrained to flow conditions by imposing the computed limits 

of case 2, an error reduction is clearly observed in figure 8. Note that the application of these 

constraints cleaned some areas that were being wrongly estimated due to the seismic noise. Also, 

the region with high errors observed in case 1 now presents a better response. This happened 

because the constraints applied to the solution space “forced” the dynamic properties estimations 

(saturation and pressure) to values more physically consistent, diminishing the effects of wrong 

static properties characterization. This improvement in the estimation of Sw can also be seen as a 

consequence of the relevant error reduction observed in the estimation of pressure for case 2 (figure 

     65



 

 

9). The good estimation of pressure was ensured by the proper uncertainties mapping performed, 

that was verified with the pressure curves presented in figure 3.

right, the reference model (answer), the estimations of cases 1 and 2. Bottom: from left to right, the 

error (reference – estimated) for the two estimations. Layer 3. 

Although the result of case 2 presented a water saturation map closer to the reference, it can be 

observed that the error anomalies are predominantly negative. This means that the estimated water 

saturation presents more water than the reference model, showing the necessity of calibrating the 

volume of water. As in practice, these errors are not available information, this could be checked by 

a simple computation of the volume of water (equation 1) and comparison with the known volume 

of injected water.  

After applying the volume calibration proposed in this work (case 3), it can be observed that the 

injection anomalies are better defined. Also, the observed error is indicating that the mass balance is 

being respected, as it presents positive and negative anomalies, meaning that the error is now more 

related to an incorrect water front displacement and not with the amount of water. 

Figure 10 shows the histogram of the errors observed in figure 8. Aside from the gradual error 

reduction observed from case 1 to cases 2 and 3, another interesting aspect to highlight is the error 

distribution of the third case. In case 3, the errors are centralized at zero, with some positive and 

negative values, indicating again that the amount of water present in the estimated map is better 

balanced than in the other two cases. 

     66

4.2. History matching 

The first step in performing the local history matching is to define regions based on the Sw 

error observed and the location of injector wells. The definition of the regions in this work is 

illustrated in figure 11. The injector wells that presented the highest errors (for all layers) were 

selected to perform the local match: INJ1, INJ3, INJ4 and INJ5. See Davolio et al (2013b) for more 

details about the regions? definition.  

The estimated Sw of case 2 (figure 8) was used to compute the error map shown in figure 11, 

which is exactly the same input used to define the regions in Davolio et al (2013b). As previously 

mentioned, the local matching procedure described in section 3.3 was performed for three cases 

(LHM1, LHM2 and LHM3), the difference among them being the Sw map used as input. Although 

the region definition is dependent on the input data, in this work, the same regions shown below 

were used for the three history matchings performed with the goal of comparing the results.

??? ) with the regions defined to 

perform the local matching. 

Figure 12a shows the Sw error map (compared to the true answer) of the base model before the 

local matching. Figures 12b, 12c and 12d show the error maps for the three updated models. The 

first thing to note is that the updated models LHM1 and LHM2 present more water than they 

should; observe the predominance of negative anomalies. These results are explained by the fact 

that the matching procedure is updating the static properties in order to match the Sw maps of case 

     67



 

 

1 and 2, displayed in figure 8. Figure 13 shows the saturation error (compared to the Sw map 

estimated from 4D seismic) for each case, i.e., the differences in the base model before and after 

applying each of the three history matchings. Thus, figure 13 is showing that the local matching 

procedure is working for LHM1 and LHM2, i.e., the updated models are providing Sw maps that 

better follow the behavior observed in 4D seismic data. However, these results are not satisfactory, 

since the matching process is increasing the saturation errors when compared to the true answer as 

displayed in figures 12b and 12c.

the local matching LHM1 (b), LHM2 (c) and LHM3 (d). Layer 3.

1(d), case 2 (e) and case 3(f) and the saturation of the base model after the respective history 

matching (LHM1, LHM2 and LHM3). 

The quantitative use of estimated Sw from 4D seismic was successful in the third history 

matching (LHM3). Figure 12d shows a decrease in the Sw error when compared to LHM1 and 

LHM2. Some errors are still observed for this case for two reasons: (1) although better calibrated, 

the Sw map of case 3 still carries some errors and (2) the characterization process is not assumed to 

     68



 

 

be perfect, i.e., the image realizations of porosity and permeability are not able to reproduce the 

reference properties. The graph bar displayed in figure 14 corresponds to the sum of the Sw errors 

at every reservoir location. This graph shows that LHM3 presents a much better balance of errors 

(positive and negative values). 

One can say that the base model (figure 12a) presents the same amount of errors as LHM3 

(figure 12d). Indeed, there is a slight error reduction in the Sw map after the local matching LHM3. 

This could be improved, for instance, by re-defining the regions according to the observed error 

anomalies specific for this case. But, it is important to highlight that the focus of this work is not to 

guarantee the best history matching result but to analyze the importance of having better input 

information when performing such a process. In this sense, the results of figures 12 and 14 

demonstrated that the use of the calibrated water saturation map (LHM3) is the safest option. 

Looking at the updated properties, especially for the porosity field, the model updated after the 

matching process LHM3 (figure 15) showed an improvement in the base model and better results 

than the other matches. The regions marked in figure 15d are examples of a good agreement with 

the reference porosity field displayed in figure 5a. Concerning the permeability field update, a less 

pronounced improvement is observed (figure 16). From figure 16, it can also be seen that the 

characterization process of permeability needs to be improved, since the image realizations do not 

present the expected features seen in figure 5c. Even so, a better definition of a high permeability 

zone can be observed, as highlighted in figure 16d.

5 Final remarks 

The results presented here showed that it is possible to use reservoir simulation data to better 

extract dynamic changes from 4D seismic data. The addition of engineering information helps to 

diminish the effects of poor static properties characterization and problems related to seismic 

signals. Concerning the history matching process, the results demonstrated that the calibrated 

estimation of water saturation maps is important to update reservoir models, namely LHM3, which 

provided the best result when compared to the other two history matchings performed. One point 

worthy of comment is that, for this dataset, the comparison of the Sw errors in the model before and 

after the history matching (LHM3) did not show very relevant differences. As already mentioned, 

this result could be improved by re-defining the regions, for instance. But, again, the result to be 

highlighted in this work is the comparison among the three history matchings performed, as the 

focus was not to achieve the best history matching possible. 

The methodology proposed to calibrate the volume of water was applied to a synthetic dataset. 

In this dataset, the Sw map provided by 4D seismic presented more water than it should for the 

entire reservoir. But, it is important to emphasize that the volume calibration and the history 

matchings were built to be performed locally. Thus, for more complex cases, it can happen that 

some regions of the reservoir present a volume bigger or smaller than expected. Then, the 

correction factor that was computed here and applied to the entire reservoir, in such cases, can be 

computed/applied individually for each region of interest. In this case, there would be an additional 

step, which is to identify the water anomalies associated to each injector well in order to compute 

individual volumes related to each injector.  

 

6 Conclusions 

A methodology to calibrate the volume of water present in water saturation maps provided 

by 4D seismic was proposed. The volume calibration is performed based on reservoir flow 

conditions imposed by the simulation of several models. As these models account for the 

uncertainties mapped, the calibrated water saturation map is consistent with flow conditions 

resulting from the current stage of characterization. 

The advantages of applying the proposed methodology were shown in two forms: (1) by 

comparing the water saturation maps resulted from a petro-elastic inversion process, with and 

without the volume calibration, and (2) by comparing the results of a history matching that uses the 

estimated water saturation maps to update static properties locally. Synthetic data was used in both 

cases and it was important to validate the methodology. 

     70



 

 

As for the main results, it can be highlighted that: (1) the calibrated water saturation map 

provided more reliable information to be used for interpretation purposes (qualitatively or 

quantitatively), since it is more physically consistent (respecting the mass balance); (2) the 

quantitative use of a calibrated water saturation map in a history matching is very important to 

ensure a proper static properties updating.

6. CONCLUSIONS 

The current work proposed four methodologies: (1) an inversion scheme to estimate 

pressure and saturation from 4D seismic, (2) a procedure that uses simulation data to better 

extract variations of dynamic properties from 4D seismic data, (3) a history matching process that 

uses water saturation maps, generated in the previous papers, in a local matching procedure and 

(4) a procedure to calibrate the volume of injected water associated to the saturation map 

estimated from 4D seismic. In addition to the methodologies, which can be seen as the main 

results of this work, especially the second and the fourth, there are some important results 

specific to each of the four of them, which should be highlighted. 

From the inversion process (paper 1), it could be concluded that: 

? The use of only one seismic attribute (P impedance, for instance) is not enough to 

estimate pressure and saturation variations, since it yields a multiple answer problem. 

A second attribute with a different response to the changes in dynamic properties 

should be considered, such as S impedance. 

? If an ideal dataset is considered (without any errors/noise and known static properties), 

a 3D seismic survey would be enough to estimate dynamic properties. However, for 

more realistic cases, which consider errors in the static properties and noise in seismic 

data, the time-lapse difference becomes absolutely necessary. 

? The inversion was implemented to estimate pressure and saturation for each single 

block individually. Thus, the optimization procedure is simple, with only two 

unknowns to be estimated. The objective function considering the 4D approach and P 

and S impedances simultaneously presented a good behavior with a well-defined 

global minimum. Thus, the initial guess did not influence the results for the cases 

studied. 

? When noise in seismic data and errors in the static properties are considered, the 

objective function still presents a global minimum. However, the global minimum is 

displaced from the expected correct position and does not coincide with the true 

answer, yielding errors in the estimated pressure and saturation values.  

     73



 

 

  

 

The methodology presented in paper 2 is a relevant result as it proposes an innovative 

procedure to integrate 4D seismic and simulation models. Some of the results to be highlighted 

are: 

? The proposed procedure applies constraints in the solution space that are derived from 

the combination of the mapped reservoir uncertainties. Thus, it is a quantitative way of 

incorporating the knowledge available from the reservoir characterization and 

simulation processes with 4D seismic signals. 

? In the case study presented, the application of the methodology allowed the reduction 

of errors in some regions of the estimated water saturation map, where, according to 

the simulations, water should not have reached. Before applying the methodology, 

these areas had been wrongly estimated from 4D seismic due to the presence of noise 

in the region. As mentioned before, in these cases, the minimum of the objective 

function is displaced and does not coincide with the true answer. Thus, the constraints 

determined by the methodology cut the solution space and now the minimum inside 

the new space is closer to the true answer. 

? The methodology allows checking the flow behavior, taking into account the reservoir 

uncertainties, to verify that it is in agreement with the time-lapse signals. Thus, it can 

be useful to identify possible problems with 4D seismic data or with the mapping of 

uncertainties. Better results are achieved when the most important uncertainties are 

properly mapped. However, in the cases where this is not achieved as, for instance, in 

the presence of an "unknown unknown", the methodology might force the inversion 

limits to the boundaries and this could be used as an indication that the 

characterization process needs to be improved. This type of situation was not 

considered in this work but must be considered in future works. 

The results obtained from the history matching methodology proposed in paper 3 are: 

? A history matching process that uses 4D seismic information locally (regions around 

injector wells) and that provides updated reservoir properties with geological features. 

? It is an easy-to-implement procedure, which can be a good alternative when more 

sophisticated methods may be unfeasible due to the complexity of implementation or 

to high computational demand. 

     74



 

 

  

 

? The results obtained in the synthetic case studied showed a considerable error 

reduction in the water saturation map. This kind of information can play an important 

role in the decision making process of developing and managing a petroleum field. 

Some points to highlight concerning the volume calibration procedure of the fourth and 

last paper of this work are: 

? The proposed methodology allowed the estimation of a saturation map from 4D 

seismic that respected the expected mass balance. This was verified by observing 

the saturation errors after the calibration, which presented positive and negative 

values. 

? The history matching results showed that the methodology was able to update 

reservoir properties and, thus, produce a simulation model that better follows the 4D 

seismic data. When a poor estimation of the saturation changes was used as input 

for the history matching, an improper update of the reservoir properties was 

observed. Thus, the results highlighted the importance of estimating a calibrated 

map, in order to use it in a quantitative history matching procedure. 

? The volume calibration procedure provides a more reliable saturation map and it is 

important to avoid bias in the amount of water in the updated model after 

performing a history matching, concentrating the matching procedure in the 

localization of the water front. 

The last aspect to highlight in the current work is that the integration methodologies (papers 

2 and 4) could be used in different contexts. For instance, the methodology of paper 2 could be 

extended to be performed in the impedance domain, instead of the pressure and saturation 

domain. In the same way, the volume calibration proposed in paper 4 could be applied to 

saturation maps estimated by other published methodologies (Landro 2001, Lumley et al 2003, 

and MacBeth et al 2006). Thus, the main contribution of this work is related to the ideas of 

integration methodologies and not only to the results presented here.

7. FUTURE WORKS 

Some points to be addressed to extend the study presented in this work are described 

below: 

? Application of the methodologies in a more challenging dataset, considering, for 

instance, data with different scales, the presence of gas, the presence of unknown 

unknowns and uncertainties in the petro-elastic modeling.  

? In more complex cases if the spatial correlation of the estimated properties is not 

respected the petro-elastic inversion must be improved by adding a continuity factor, 

or by performing the inversion for all the blocks simultaneously. For the latter a more 

sophisticated optimization algorithm might be necessary. 

? Performance of volume calibration locally, around the injector wells, creating an 

additional step to identify the volume of water corresponding to each selected well. 

? Improvement of the proposed local history matching procedure to guarantee 

continuity in the borders of the regions, generating models more consistent with

APPENDIX A  
Complementary results of the paper “Pressure and saturation estimation 
from P and S impedances: a theoretical study” 

Paper 1 presents some discussions concerning the objective function behavior of the 

petro-elastic inversion proposed. To visualize the optimization aspects of the inversion, all 

discussions were presented assuming one single reservoir location (one grid block). The 

results presented here complement those discussions by showing the inversion results in an 

entire reservoir model. These new results allow verification of the reflection of the 

optimization issues in an entire reservoir model, evaluating different combinations of static 

and dynamic variables.  

These results were extracted from the published paper Davolio et al (2011), which is 

attached at the end of this appendix. The goal of this appendix is to highlight the 

relationship between the studies presented for one single block in paper 1 and the results for 

the entire reservoir, presented in Davolio et al (2011). For more details, see the respective 

references. 

The relationship between the results of the two works is shown in the figures below 

that follow the layout: the results in a single reservoir location are displayed on the top 

(some images were extracted from paper 1) and the results of the same inversion process 

are displayed at the bottom, under the same optimization conditions, for an entire reservoir 

(images extracted from Davolio et al, 2011). In order to check the accuracy of the results, 

Figure A-1 presents the true answer to the problem for the entire reservoir. 

1. 3D approach: the non-uniqueness issue 
The first result of the petro-elastic inversion presented in paper 1 highlights the non-

uniqueness problem when changes in pressure and saturation are estimated from P 

impedance. These results are displayed at the top of Figure A-2. At the bottom of the same 

figure, the manner in which this problem affects different locations of a reservoir is 

presented.  

Given that the expected solution (true answer) is displayed in Figure A-1, FigureA-2 

shows that the dynamic properties are being poorly estimated. The saturation anomalies are 

not being recovered and the pressure map is influenced by these water anomalies, 

     87



indicating that this process could not differentiate the effects of the two dynamic properties 

from seismic data (IP).

Figure A-2: 3D inversion results, assuming only the P impedance in the objective function: 
OF=f(IP). Top: considering one single reservoir location (extracted from Davolio et al, 
2012). Bottom: estimated pressure (MPa) and saturation considering the entire reservoir 
(extracted from Davolio et al, 2011). 

     88



 

For an ideal dataset (no errors/noise), the non-uniqueness problem can be solved by 

considering, simultaneously, P and S impedances in the objective function. This is 

illustrated in Figure A-3. The exact solution found by the 3D algorithm, which is observed 

for the single block location, is explained by the very well-behaved objective function that 

holds a well-defined global minimum. This situation is observed for the entire reservoir. As 

illustrated in Figure A-3, the estimation of pressure and saturation for the entire reservoir 

was very precise.

OF=f(IP,IS). Top: considering one single reservoir location (extracted from Davolio et al, 
2012). Bottom: estimated pressure (MPa) and saturation  considering the entire reservoir 
(extracted from Davolio et al, 2011).

2. 3D approach: assuming an incorrect porosity 

When a non-ideal dataset is assumed, the 3D inversion starts to fail. The non-ideal 

dataset was represented in paper 1 by assuming an inaccurate value of porosity, which is an 

important input for petro-elastic inversion. For the inversion performed in the entire 

reservoir, this inaccuracy was added by multiplying the true porosity image by a constant 

(1.15). 

For this case, the global minimum of the objective function does not coincide with 

the expected answer, as illustrated in Figure A-4. The results of the inversion in the entire 

reservoir also reflect this poor estimation.

OF=f(IP,IS),  and an incorrect porosity as input. Top: considering one single reservoir 
location (extracted from Davolio et al, 2012). Bottom: estimated pressure (MPa) and 
saturation  considering the entire reservoir (extracted from Davolio et al, 2011). 

     90



3. 4D approach 

The problem of imperfect static properties to be used as input for the petro-elastic 

inversion can be mitigated by using the 4D approach. The objective function for this case 

presents a well-defined global minimum again (Figure A-5). As a consequence, the results 

of the entire reservoir also present acceptable errors. Indeed, these errors are smaller than 

6%, as illustrated in Davolio et al, 2011 – Figure 7. 

 

Figure A-5: 4D inversion results, assuming wrong porosity as input. Top: considering one 
single reservoir location (extracted from Davolio et al, 2012). Bottom: estimated pressure 
(MPa) and saturation considering the entire reservoir (extracted from Davolio et al, 2011). 
 

4. 4D approach: assuming uncertainties in the initial reservoir 
conditions 

The last result presented here concerns the assumption of knowledge regarding the 

initial reservoir conditions. The images below were not extracted from Davolio et al (2011) 

     91



but were generated with the same dataset presented in that paper. One of the premises of 

this thesis is that the first seismic survey was acquired in the pre-production period and that 

pressure and saturation are known at that time, given the equilibrium conditions. In this part 

of the appendix, an example is presented, where this condition is not satisfied. To illustrate 

this example, an incorrect facies characterization was considered, which yielded the 

incorrect initial water saturation (connate water) displayed in Figure A-6b. The initial 

pressure is not totally correct either, as it is assuming the constant value of 32MPa (Figure 

A-6d). 

 

Figure A-6: Water saturation and pressure at the initial time (first survey). (a) and (c) 
represent the true properties. (b) and (d) represent the available knowledge.  

To illustrate the effect of these uncertainties in the inversion process, the other input 

properties of the inversion were considered correct and no noise was added to seismic data. 

The inversion results are shown in Figure A-7. Looking at the error at the bottom of the 

image, it is possible to see that the main problem regarding the saturation map is related to 

the initial water saturation (compare with Figure A-6). Note that the injection anomalies 

were properly recovered and that the relevant errors are concentrated at the locations where 

     92



the initial saturation was wrong (Figures A-7c). The pressure is also presenting some 

influence on the error considered at time 0; observe the differences between the expected 

image (Figure A-1) with the estimated one (Figure A-7b).  

 

Figure A-7: Estimated saturation (a) and pressure (b) maps for the second seismic survey 
time. Saturation (c) and pressure (d) errors (estimated – reference). 
 

  To visualize the objective function behavior for this case, one point in the reservoir 

was selected (indicated by the arrow in Figure A-7c) and the same type of analysis shown 

before was repeated. Figure A-8 shows that, when this type of uncertainty is assumed, the 

minimum of the objective function does not coincide with the expected answer. This 

behavior was also observed, in a less pronounced form, in Figure A-5 (where porosity was 

not totally correct). More generally, it can be said that any source of error considered in the 

inversion (uncertainties in the static properties, inaccuracy in the seismic impedances etc.) 

will cause a displacement in the minimum of the objective function, and more problematic 

cases can yield very wrong estimates of the dynamic properties. Appendix C presents an 

     93



example of this kind of situation and how the methodologies of papers 2 and 4 help to 

improve the estimations.  

 

Figure A-8: Objective function behavior for one grid block (indicated in Figure A-7c). 

The dynamic properties of the base model (pressure and saturation) are used as 

input for the inversion. These properties at the initial time (corresponding to the first 

survey) are kept constant during the optimization process and those corresponding to the 

second time (second survey) are modified in order to minimize the objective function. 

Thus, if the dynamic properties at the initial time carry some errors, these errors are 

reflected in the response of the optimization process, i.e., the estimated pressure and 

saturation for the second time (remember that the objective function minimizes the time 

lapse difference). This explains the errors observed in Figure A-7.  

However, these errors are substantially diminished when the time lapse difference 

of the estimated dynamic properties is analyzed, as shown in Figures A-9 and A-10. The 

true change in saturation and pressure are shown in Figures A-9a and A-10a, respectively. 

The second column of these images displays the changes observed according to the 

available information (represented in this work by the so-called Base model) and the third 

column displays the estimated changes. The errors displayed in Figures A-9e are totally 

acceptable for saturation and the same can be said for pressure, which yielded error values 

smaller than 1MPa (Figure A-10e). Thus, Figures A-9 and A-10 show that, even if the 

properties at the initial time are inaccurate, the pressure and saturation changes are being 

properly recovered, which is, indeed, the information needed for reservoir monitoring.

Abstract 
Time-Lapse seismic attributes has been showed as a promising tool to be used in the history matching process. The most 

common seismic attribute used to integrate these data is P-impedance. The procedure usually made is a minimization of the 

differences between the seismic P-impedance and the synthetic P-impedance computed from the flow simulation data through 

a forward modeling. On this paper, we propose a methodology that goes in the opposite way. We invert the seismic data to 

pressure and saturation and then incorporate these results in the history match procedure in order to integrate the inversion 

process with the flow simulator, using the results of the reservoir simulation to guide the process. Another feature is that 

instead of using only the P-impedance in our inversion procedure we are also taking into account a second seismic attribute the 

S-impedance, which is more sensitive to pressure than saturation variations. A discussion is presented regarding the results 

obtained using a model with characteristics similar to the Brazilian offshore fields and synthetic seismic data. The main 

contribution of this work is the integration of the seismic attributes inversion and reservoir simulation processes. We also show 

the advantages of the inversion procedure to obtain pressure and saturation considering prediction of petroleum production and 

the details used in the methodology to avoid multiple combinations of saturation and pressure in the inversion process. 

 

 
Introduction 
 

 Traditional history matching uses production and pressure data measured in the wells, such as oil, water and gas rate, 

flowing and static pressures etc, for conditioning of reservoir simulation model in order to reproduce the observed data. The 

utilization of survey seismic derived data, such as pressure and saturations maps, in the history matching is relative new. 

Although this practice is relative new it has become increasingly common due to the improvement generally observed when it 

is compared to the traditional workflow using only production data. Gosselin et al (2001) and Gosselin et al (2003) presented a 

methodology in which the fluid flow simulator was coupled with a petro-elastic model to convert the simulated 

saturation/pressure and static rock properties into simulated elastic properties and run the history matching on the elastic 

domain. Kjelstadli (2005) showed the use of seismic surveys acquired through permanent ocean-bottom seismic cables. 

Sedighi and Stephen (2009) worked on a fast method based on neighbourhood algorithm using time-lapse seismic to 

effectively condition saturation and pressure changes in history matching. Dadashpour (2009) proposed a computer aided 

history matching methodology for porosity and permeability estimation integrating production and time-lapse seismic data in 

the form of zero offset amplitudes and amplitude versus offset (AVO) gradients. Another work that concerns integration of 4D 

seismic data into the history matching process by a forward modeling is Ida (2009), where the author proposes a methodology 

that matches the data in the elastic domain, adjusting impedance maps. Thus, there are several ways to integrate these two set 

of data, Fahimuddin et al (2010) addressed this question presenting a discussion regarding which kind of seismic data and at 

which level of history matching process these data should be integrated. The authors compare the integration of seismic data in 

the elastic and amplitude domains and conclude that the elastic domain performs better than the other one.  

Most of the works found in the literature utilize the acoustic impedance or seismic amplitudes in the history matching 

process trough a forward petro elastic modeling and the matching is done in the seismic domain (elastic or amplitudes). The 

idea of using pressure and saturation maps, the purpose of second part of this work, has as main motivation on the use of 

reservoir parameters as input of the process, which it seems to be a more natural way from the point of view of reservoir 

behavior understanding. The point is that extracting pressure and saturation information from seismic data is not a trivial task. 

It can be found in the literature several works aiming to recovery dynamic properties from 4D seismic data. Tuna and Lumley 

     96

(1999) showed that it is possible to estimate changes on pressure and saturation through P-wave and S-wave impedances 

seismic derived. On Landro (2001) the author derived mathematical expressions that can be used to extract pressure and 

saturation changes using 4D AVO data, he also shows that the application of his technique to real 4D seismic data was made 

successfully. Later on the work of Nunes et al (2009) shows an application of Landro’s (2001) method in a real Brazilian field, 

with good results. MacBeth et al (2006) also proposed a methodology to identify pressure and saturations changes using time 

lapse seismic amplitudes. The work of Dadashpour et al (2008) presented a petro-elastic inversion methodology that uses zero 

offset 4D seismic amplitudes to recovery pressure and saturation changes. Following this line, this work presents a 

methodology that estimates pressure and saturation from P ans S impedances through a petro-elastic inversion. Then on the 

second part, these estimated dynamic properties are coupled into history matching process. 

 

Petro-elastic modeling 
The methodology proposed in this work is divided in two parts, the first one attempt to generate saturation and 

pressures maps inverting seismic attributes and the second one attempt to use these data in the history matching process. 

The inversion algorithm is made through an optimization procedure where the differences between the seismic 

attributes and the simulation derived seismic attributes are minimized. To generate seismic attributes from simulation data, a 

petro elastic modeling (PEM), which is a set of relationships that relates fluid/rock and elastic properties, is required. Follows 

below the relationship that composes the PEM considered in this work. 

The seismic attributes that are used in the inversion are compressional and shear impedances, also called P-impedance 

(IP) and S-impedance (IS), respectively. Considering ?, VP and VS the density, compressional and shear wave velocities of the 

medium the impedances can be written as:  

 ?? ? ???,        (1) 
?? ? ??? .       (2) 

Seismic velocities depend on rock saturated bulk (Ksat) and shear (µ sat) modulus according to the equations: 

 

?? ? 	
??
?????????
? ?      (3) 
 

?? ? ????
? ?       (4) 
 

The most used theoretical approach to determine the rock saturated bulk and shear modulus are the Gassmann 

equations that can be described as follows (Avseth et al. 2005): 

???? ?????? ? ? !
"#$%"&amp;amp;'()*+",-??? ./+?"012?!?

"345"012*
?         (5) 

 6789 ? 6????          (6) 
 

where Kdry, Kmin and Kfl are the bulk modulus of the rock frame, the mineral and the fluid mixture. µ  is the shear modulus and + is the porosity. Note that Gassmann equations predict that the rock bulk modulus change if the fluids change, but the rock 
shear modulus do not. 

To compute the dry bulk and shear modulus the known friable, or uncemented, sand model (Mavko et al. 2003) is 

used in this work. This model makes use of the Hertz-Mindlin contact theory and a heuristic modified Hashin – Strikman 

lower bound, according to the equations:

Proposed Petro-elastic inversion 
 

 The link between simulation and seismic data is done through the equations presented above, i.e., given  

saturation/pressure pairs provided by simulation and rock and fluids properties the elastic parameter such as P and S 

impedances can be computed through forward modeling. So, in the opposite direction the inversion is done when the elastic 

parameters are provided and the dynamics properties are estimated. 

The minimization of the objective function is carried out through an optimization algorithm based on numerical 

gradients computation and sequential quadratic programming, available in MatLab software (fmincon). In this work three 

different approaches of the objective function is presented. The main objectives are to verify the improvement when more than 

one seismic attribute is used into the objective function and also how to handle time lapse data set into that.  

For the first two algorithms proposed the objective function can be generally described as: 

 [\ ? ]?^_`? F ?^T?a]      (12) 
 

where obs and cal stands for observed and calculated, respectively; SA means seismic attribute, which can be SA =IP  or the 

vector SA = [IP  IS].  

 The objective function of the third algorithm is given in terms of dSA instead of SA which means time lapse 

difference of the seismic attributes so,  

 [\ ? ]b?^_`? F b?^T?a]      (13) 
 

where again d is the 4D difference between two vintages and the vector dSA is defined as dSA =[dIP dIS]. 

In order to better control the inversion scheme synthetic seismic data is used, so the petro elastic modeling will be 

also used to generate the synthetic seismic attributes. To do so two simulation models have to be considered, the one used to 

create the synthetic seismic, called reference model and the second one called base model that represents the model we want to 

adjust. 

Pressure and saturations derived from the base model simulation are used as initial guess to all inversion algorithms 

and the inversion is run for each reservoir model cell independently.  

 

Algorithm 1: inversion algorithm using IP 

 

The first algorithm built follows the ideas presented in (Souza et. al, 2010). The main input data for this algorithm are 

the observed seismic P-impedance (in equation 12,  SA=IP) and the initial guess. Before running the inversion the base model 

(the one that will be adjusted) is simulated and the pressure and saturations values estimated are used as initial. Then, using the 

petro elastic modeling the optimization algorithm finds the saturation and pressures values that best match the two P-

impedances, the one coming from seismic and the one computed from the simulation data.  

Assuming that the initial reservoir conditions are known the inversion aims to work only with the second production 

time, so the algorithm uses only one time production data.  

 

Algorithm 2: inversion algorithm using IP and IS 

  

As stated in (Souza et. al, 2010) estimating pressure and saturation from P-impedance end up in a no uniqueness 

problem. In order to better handle this issue the second algorithm we propose incorporate more seismic information into the 

inversion process. The use of two different kind of seismic data simultaneously (P and S impedances), instead of only using 

the well known P-impedance, helps to differentiate between pressure and saturation effects since these attributes have different 

answers when the dynamic properties change (Tuna et al, 1999). One reason for this difference is that S-impedance is not as 

     98



4  SPE 142946 

sensitive to fluids change as P-impedance,  remembering that shear modulus does not depends on pore fluids contents as 

mentioned before. So, the 4D changes observed on shear impedance data should be more related to pressure than saturation 

and that makes the difference compared to the P-impedance, which is sensitive to both effects. Figure 1 shows this behavior, 

where it can be seen that big changes for saturation yields very small changes in IS, the opposite is observed for IP. The values 

of IP and IS shown on figure 1 were calculated through the petro elastic modeling previously presented, so it represents the 

sensitivity of the elastic properties to pressure and saturation changes considering those relationships. 

Following the same scheme defined in algorithm 1, the difference now is that SA in the objective function (equation 

12) is the vector SA=[IP IS]. The same assumption about the date considered in the previous algorithm is used here and the 

whole procedure is done with only one seismic survey. 

 

Algorithm 3: inversion algorithm using IP and IS and a 4D approach 

  

One of the best arguments to work with time lapse seismic data is that making the difference between two vintages 

allows mitigating de effect of noise, or uncertainty in the reservoir properties when synthetic seismic needs to modeled. 

Following our study, if we start to consider uncertainties in the reservoir model the two algorithms presented before may fail. 

To try to overcome these issues the third algorithm proposes to minimize the 4D impedances differences. This code, as the one 

defined before, keeps the use of both impedances (IP and IS) into the objective function and a diffent aspect compared to the 

previous methodology is that now the evaluation of 4D differences requires two seismic surveys as input data. Here the 

objective function is defined by equation 13. 

 

 
Figure 1- P and S impedances sensitivity to saturation and pressure changes, considering three values of porosity (0.2, 0.25 

and 0.3). Note that S-impedance is almost insensitive to saturation effects. 

Constraints 
  All the inversion procedures are limited by known boundaries that come from engineering data. The water saturation 

values are constrained by connate water saturation and one minus irreducible oil saturation: 

 

Swc ? Sw ? 1-Sor.       (14) 

 

 The water saturation boundaries vary according to the facies reservoir distribution. 

 As no gas will be considered another constraint applied to Sw is that the sum of the oil and water saturations is equal 

to one, 

So + Sw = 1.                 (15) 

 

 For the pressure range we are assuming the pressure bubble point and the overburden pressure, 

 

Pbub ?  P ? Pover.       (16) 

 

 As this work concerns only synthetic seismic data we are not dealing with scaling issues.

Model description 
 

 The reservoir was discretized in a corner-point grid with 90×110×5 blocks, 60 meters in size in x and y direction 

(5400 m × 6600 m) and 15 meters (in average) in z direction. The model was generated through geostatistical techniques. 

There are three facies characterized according to three permeability ranges. The reservoir also comprises four faults, as can be 

seen in Figure 2. The transmissibility of each fault was included as uncertain attribute in the study. The reservoir is drained by 

eight vertical producer wells supported by seven water injector wells. A reference reservoir model (chosen from the possible 

combinations of the 16 uncertain attributes) was simulated to generate a history of 3600 days. The description of the 16 

attributes considered is shown in Table 1. For the generation of Base model, multiplier values for the parameters 1 to 9 was set 

to 1. For the four faults (parameters 10 to 13), multipliers equals to 0.5 were used. For relative permeability (parameters 14 to 

16), exponent of water phase (Corey Model) was set to 3. Oil rate of the production wells and water rate of the injection wells 

(obtained from the reference model - history) are imposed to the Base model. 

 

    

Figure 2 - Horizontal permeability (mD) of model studied 

 Concerning time-lapse seismic data,  it will be considered as the base data the synthetic seismic generated from the 

reference simulation model at the initial production time (year 1990), when no fluids neither pressure changes has occurred. 

The monitor surveys will be assumed after 4 and 8 years of production, represented by the years 1994 and 1998 of the same 

simulation model. All the inversion schemes proposed aim to find pressure and saturation values for the monitor surveys.  

  

Application: Petro-elastic Inversion 
 

 Remembering that the static reservoir properties used as input to run the petro elastic model, such as porosity, fluid 

properties, compressibility, etc, were the same for both models (base and reference), when we apply the inversion procedures 

proposed we are evaluating the possibility of recovery pressure and saturation information from seismic attributes assuming 

we know these static reservoir parameters.  Figure 3 shows the saturation and pressure maps for the reference model for the 

third layer after four years of production, these data were used to generate the seismic impedances and they represent the 

answer we want to reach.

Algorithm 1 

 Application of Algorithm 1 intends to show how much information about pressure and saturation effects it is possible 

to recovery when only P-impedance data is available. Figure 4 shows the results for the third layer of the model. Comparing 

qualitatively these maps with the ones shown on Figure 3 it can be noticed that the inversion algorithm was not able to capture 

the water saturation anomalies. Also, the pressure map presented some influence of the saturation behavior showing that the 

effects of both dynamic properties could not be properly differentiated from P-impedance data. Although some information 

especially about the pressure field could be recovered the results were not very satisfactory.

the application algorithm 1. 

Algorithm 2 

 This second case aims to evaluate the contribution of shear impedance for the inversion when it is included into the 

objective function. Incorporation of this new seismic attribute is the only difference between the results provided by running 

algorithm 2 and the ones obtained through algorithm 1. Observing Figure 5 we clearly see the improvement of the inversion 

results when IS is considered together with IP in the objective function, showing that now the inversion was able to 

discriminate pressure and saturation effects. Further, the error maps shown in the same figure reveals that the results were very 

close to the answer we wish to reach, giving a percentage error &amp;lt;1%. This means that the problem of non-uniqueness was 

reduced by incorporating IS into the process.

Algorithm 2 – applied in a modified porosity model 

 Knowing that the use of both impedances improves the inversion algorithm response being quantitatively close to the 

solution, we start to consider uncertainties in the reservoir base model. The generation of seismic attributes was done exactly 

as before, using the reference model. However the base simulation model is now composed by a modified porosity field, 

where a constant multiplier was applied to it. So, the inversion algorithm uses this modified porosity field as input and the 

simulated pressure and saturations values used as initial guess were generated incorporating this change. This case would be 

closer to a field case, where the reservoir simulation model does not accurately represent the real porosity values. Saturation 

and pressure maps resulted from this case can be seen on Figure 6. 

We do not even need to look at the error maps to realize that this small change in one reservoir property messed up 

the inversion process, yielding results very far from the expected. This result shows the instability of the process when 

recovering saturation and pressure information by a petro elastic inversion. A good sign is that the general trend was kind of 

recovered, what means that some improvements could be done in the process to guide the inversion and produce better results.

the application algorithm 2 considering a modified porosity field in the base model. 

Algorithm 3 – applied in a modified porosity model  

In the previous application it was noted the instability of the inversion when the porosity field is disturbed. This third 

algorithm we are proposing deals with this issue by defining the objective function concerning time lapse differences. As 

mentioned before this methodology is based on a minimization between the 4D differences of the seismic and simulation 

derived impedances, where the main objective is to mitigate the error in the porosity field by subtracting the seismic attributes.

The application of this methodology requires a minimum of two seismic vintages. Remember that in this work the 

base survey corresponds to the initial state of the field, i.e., the production has not started. The results for this case are 

illustrated on Figure 7 and as it can be seen the 4D approach really improves the inverted saturation and pressure maps, 

mitigating the effect of inaccuracy in the porosity field. The errors are now acceptable (see the bottom of the same figure) 

presenting values less than 6%.  

Comparing the results shown so far one can say that the use of S and P impedance together allows to quantitavely 

recovery pressure and saturations information. If uncertainties in the reservoir static properties are considered, the 4D 

difference of seismic attributes helps to minimize this error on the inversion results. On the second part of this work the results 

provided by the application of algorithm 3 are used in the history matching process as described below. 

 

History matching 

 

Saturation and pressure maps obtained from the application of Algorithm 3 are used in the history matching process. 

The minimization of the objective function is carried out through an optimization algorithm based on numerical gradients 

computation and sequential quadratic programming, available in MatLab software (fmincon). The objective function is 

mathematically represented by the Equation 17:

 In Equation 17, obsi and simi represent observed and simulated production data, respectively, n is the number of 

production data and s is the number of data series (well water rate, for example) and wp is a weight factor for production data. 

Sobs and Ssim are observed and simulated saturation maps and Pobs and Psim are observed and simulated pressure maps, wm 

is a weight factor for pressure and saturation data and b is the number of grid blocks. Dp, Ems and Emp are differences related 

to production data, saturation and pressure maps, respectively. Remembering that observed pressure and saturation maps 

considered here is those ones obtained from the inverse procedure (Algorithm 3). 

The subscript “B” in previous equations represents quantities (differences) computed for Base model. Therefore, the 

division by Base model quantity represents normalization in order to combine data with different magnitude (production rates, 

pressure and saturation maps) in the objective function. This signifies that if a given modified model has a OF value greater 

than 1, it has a match worse than the Base case. Conversely, if OF is lower than 1, the model has a match better than the Base 

case. 

Eight situations considered in the history matching process are shown in Table 2. The processes are classified 

according to the following three aspects: (1) the amount of data considered in the history period (2940 and 3600 days); (2) the 

composition of the objective function (with and without the use of the pressure and saturation maps and (3) the number of 

parameters considered in the history matching. In the third one, the objective is to show, in a simplified way, how pressure 

maps can be used to identify reservoir compartmentalization, in this case, the pressure error maps (Figure 8) reveals clearly the 

presence of the two sealing faults (transmissibility multipliers near from zero in the reference model). Therefore, the history 

matching processes with 16 parameters consider the presence of these two faults and the processes with 14 parameters do not 

consider. The objective function was composed by water rate of the eight producer wells plus four maps: pressure and 

saturation for 1470 and 2940 days.

difference in saturation maps related to the best model is shown in Figure 10. Both analysis show that the use of pressure and 

saturation maps in the objective function produced better results. Regarding the convergence of the minimization process, it 

can been observed in Figure 11-a that HM16PM_2940 used more simulation, however, the reduction of the objective function 

was much higher.

Figure 10 - Difference in saturation maps related to the best solution: comparison of history matching process with 

(HM16PM_2940) and without (HM16P_2940) pressure and saturation maps in the objective function 

In Figure 12 is presented results from the history matching process considering 3600 days of production. In this case, 

the increase in amount of production data improves the results for well PROD7 obtained from the process using only 

production data in the objective function. However, the number of simulation was greater as can be seen in the convergence 

behavior (Figure 11-b) and the reduction of the objective function was smaller. It can also be seen from Figure 11 that the use 

of pressure and saturation maps in the objective function stabilizes the optimization process, considering the similar number of 

simulations and similar (and expressive) reduction of the objective function in both cases (2940 and 3600 days). A 

summarized quantitative analysis of the best solution of each history matching process is shown in Table 3. As would be 

expected, the assumption of 14 parameters (without the two sealing faults) gives a worse result, mainly for the wells PROD4 

and PROD7, near the region comprising the sealing main fault.

Conclusions 
Regarding the inversion the main result observed is the big contribution that shear impedance brings to the petro 

elastic inversion when it is simultaneously considered with P-impedance into the objective function. Another relevant point is 

that the time-lapse difference should be considered in order to minimize the error caused by uncertainties in the reservoir 

model. It has to be highlighted as well that the methodology makes the assumption that the base survey corresponding to the 

initial reservoir state when time lapse differences is computed. This supposition takes advantage of using a data with less 

uncertainty once there is no fluid movement or pressure changes at this time.  

Concerning the initial guess some tests were run comparing constant values and model base simulated values of 

pressure and saturation and it was noted that the results did not presented big differences. This happen because of the 

constraints applied during the inversion, so these restrictions plays an important role guiding properly the inversion; even more 

than the initial guess. Another point to highlight is that this process is not time consuming as the inversion is run independently 

for each reservoir grid cell. 

For the cases studied in this work, the use of pressure and saturation maps in the objective function improves the 

history matching process, mainly when less production data is available. Differences between observed and simulated pressure 

maps can be useful to identify reservoir compartmentalization, aiming the reservoir parameterization for posterior history 

matching. 

This work is a preliminary study of a seismic/simulation integration study that is being developed. We are currently 

working on adding more uncertainty at model properties aiming to build a more robust set of constraints through the definition 

of regions where some knowledge is proved by field measured data.

  APPENDIX B
Complementary results of the paper “Local history matching using 4D 

seismic data and multiple models combination” 

Pressure matching 

The local history matching methodology proposed in paper 3 uses Sw maps to 

estimate static reservoir properties, such as porosity and permeability. The Sw map is 

provided by 4D seismic and, for the dataset used in this work, it was also possible to 

estimate pressure maps from 4D seismic (according to the results presented in papers 1 and 

2). Thus, pressure maps could also be considered an input parameter for the history 

matching. The choice of not using this information came from the results obtained after the 

application of the global matching procedure. For the dataset of this work, the global 

matching procedure, which uses only well production data (BHP and water rate), provided 

an updated model with a satisfactory pressure matching. Thus, there was no need to extend 

the methodology to incorporate pressure map information. This appendix shows the results 

that led to this conclusion.  It is important to point out that, in cases where a satisfactory 

pressure matching is not achieve using only well data, a procedure similar to the one 

presented in paper 3 could be applied for estimated pressure maps as well.   

From Figure B-1, it can be observed that the average reservoir pressure of the model 

after global matching (black diamond) is considerably better than the one from the base 

model (solid blue). The average pressure curve of this updated model closely follows the 

expected behavior of the history data (red circles). 

 

Figure B-1: Average reservoir pressure. The magenta vertical line indicates the two 

periods: history and forecast. 

     109



The pressure map of the model after the global matching (Figure B-2d) also shows an 

improvement when compared to that of the base model (Figure B-2c). Although differences 

can be observed around some wells such as INJ1, INJ2, INJ3, the pressure distribution 

along the reservoir grid is following the expected trend from 4D seismic (Figure B-2b). 

Figure B-2a shows the true pressure map from which it can be verified that the estimation 

from 4D seismic was reliable. 

Figure B-3 shows the percentage errors of the pressure maps for the base model and 

this same model after the global matching, compared to the map estimated from 4D 

seismic. After global matching, the majority of errors observed are smaller than 10%. Thus, 

the pressure maps are already close to the one estimated from 4D seismic and, again, it is 

clear that there is no need to include this information in the history matching.

seismic (b), the base model (c) and the model after global matching (c).

after global matching (b). The error is computed among the pressure map estimated from 

4D seismic (Figure A2-b) and the simulation models. 

     110



The BHP curves for the individual wells (Figure B-4) also confirm the same results. 

This information is complementary to the results discussed in the paper. Based on these 

results, the local matching methodology was proposed to incorporate only water saturation 

maps. Indeed, this assumption is also in agreement with the difficulty to extract pressure 

maps from 4D seismic in real cases and with the fact that, usually, engineering data is 

enough to calibrate the pressure behavior.

APPENDIX C  
Complementary results of the paper “A methodology to calibrate water 

saturation estimated from 4D seismic” 

This appendix presents some complementary results and discussions that comprise 

the two parts of paper 4: the first one is related to the estimation (and calibration) of a 

saturation map and the second is focused on the use of the estimated map in a history 

matching process. 

1. Estimation of saturation from 4D seismic 

The first part of this appendix presents a discussion on the 4D petro-elastic 

inversion defined in paper 1, which is used as a tool to estimate saturation and pressure 

maps in all the subsequent papers. Here, the discussion is focused on how the constraints 

applied to the solution space of the optimization process help to improve the solutions. 

These constraints are the base of the most important results of this thesis, which are the 

methodologies, presented in papers 2 and 4.  

Paper 1 presents a discussion concerning the objective function behavior of the 4D 

petro-elastic inversion proposed, considering one single grid block (Figures 10a and 10b in 

the paper). These images show that, if an ideal dataset is used (without any error/noise), the 

objective function is very well-behaved, with a global minimum that can be easily found by 

any optimization process (Figure 10a). However, when an imperfect scenario is assumed by 

adding some errors in one of the input parameters of the inversion (porosity), the objective 

function still presents a global minimum, though this point does not coincide with the 

expected answer (Figure 10b). Actually, the inversion result presented in Figure 10b is very 

accurate, although not exactly correct. However, when greater inaccuracy or another source 

of errors (noise in seismic data, for instance) is assumed, the location of the global 

minimum of the objective function can be very different from the true answer of the 

problem. In this type of situation, the use of the constraints proposed in paper 2 plays an 

important role to improve the estimation of pressure and saturation.  

This appendix shows an analysis similar to the one presented in paper 1, concerning 

the details of the optimization, but highlighting the role of the constraints to improve the 

     113



solutions. To do this, one point of the model grid was selected, based on the inversion 

results shown in Figure 6 of paper 4. In this sense, Figure C-1 displays a zoom in the region 

highlighted with the red arrow in Figure 6 in paper 4; the error maps presented here are 

exactly the same; only the color scale has been modified. The point marked with a yellow 

star was selected to perform the analysis of the objective function behavior, in order to 

understand the improvement seen, especially from Case 1 to Case 2. As stated in paper 4, 

the sources of error for the inversion are: the wrong estimate of porosity and overburden 

pressure and the presence of noise on seismic impedances. These errors are described in 

Table C-1 for this selected grid location. 

Remember that the only difference among these inversions is the definition of the 

solution space due to new constraints. These differences are described in Table C-2, where 

the constraints applied to the selected grid location for each of the inversions are displayed. 

Note that Cases 2 and 3 have the same values, because Case 3 corresponds to the estimated 

saturation of Case 2 with the volume calibration.

marked with the yellow star was selected to analyze the objective function behavior of the 

three inversions performed (Cases 1, 2 and 3).

Besides the inversions shown in Figure C-1, another test was run as an illustrative 

example, where the solution space is defined according to more general values: 0 ? Sw ? 1 

and 1 ? Pre ? 50 (MPa). Here, this test is called ApC (appendix C). The results of this case 

are shown in Figure C-2. Following the same layout of the images of paper 1, Figure C-2a 

shows the objective function behavior and Figure C-2b the location inside the solution 

space of the estimated values, the initial guess and true answer. This example clearly 

demonstrates the fact that when errors are considered, such as those in Table C-1, the 

global minimum is displaced and it does not coincide with the true answer.

values of the objective function, where hot colors stand for higher values; initial guess 

(black cross), estimated (green circle) and true answer (magenta asterisk). 

In the second inversion, the solution space is constrained with the values presented 

in paper 4 (Case 1 in Table C-2) that are defined by: Swc&lt;Sw&lt;1-Sor and PreProdMin 

&lt;Pre&lt;PreInjMax. The inversion behavior of this case is shown in Figure C-3. Note that, by 

     115



cutting the solution space, the feasible values of pressure are closer to the expected value, 

which caused a better response of the optimization (compare the pressure values of Cases 

ApC and 1 in Table C-3).

objective function, where hot colors stand for higher values; initial guess (black cross), 

estimated (green circle) and true answer (magenta asterisk). 

The third inversion performed for the selected single location considered the 

solution space of Case 2 in Table C-2. This means that the range for saturation and pressure 

are estimated by the methodology proposed in paper 2. Figure C-4 shows the results for this 

case. Again, it can be observed that, as the solution space is stricter now, a better estimation 

is reached. 

Table C-3 summarizes all the inversion results discussed here. Note that the last row 

corresponds to the third inversion performed with the volume calibration presented in paper 

4 (Case 3 in Table C-2). The last column corresponds to the norm of the error of the 

solution found:

The norm values indicate a gradual improvement obtained from the first inversion 

(assuming a general solution space) to the last case that considers a stricter and more 

consistent range, together with the water volume calibration applied to Sw.

2. History matching results: well curves 

The discussions presented in paper 4, concerning the history matching process 

applied to the data, were focused on the improvement of the saturation map yielded from 

the updated simulation model. To complement those results, this appendix displays the well 

curves of the simulation model before and after the history matching. To tie these results 

with paper 3 as well, the images below follow the same pattern of curves (color and style) 

presented in paper 3: 

     117



1. History (red circles) 

2. Base model  (blue solid line): represents the initial model without any matching; 

3. Base + GL (black diamond):  base model after the global matching presented in 

paper 3. This model was used as input to perform the (local) history matching of 

paper 4.  

4. LHM2 (dashed green): base model + GL after the local matching presented in paper 

3 that was called LHM2 in paper 4. 

5. LHM3 (yellow solid circles): base model + GL after the local matching that uses the 

calibrated saturation map as input for the local history matching (paper 4). 

As already mentioned in paper 4, after applying the local history matching (LHM3) 

slight changes were observed in the simulation results, before and after this matching. One 

point to be highlighted is that the goal of the last paper was not to achieve the best history 

matching, but to show that LHM3 was the best option among the three local history 

matching presented there. In general, the well curves presented below show a relevant 

improvement from the initial base model and the model after global matching. Then, small 

changes are observed among the model after the global matching and the two models 

LHM2 and LHM3.  

Figure C-5 shows the field water rate and average pressure. Observing the water 

rate curves, it can be said that the best model is LHM3, as it presents an excellent 

production forecast. For the average field pressure, in the history period, LHM3 also 

provided the best match; in the forecast period, LHM2 and LHM3 have a similar 

performance. 

The curves for the individual wells are shown in Figures C-6 and C-7. As already 

mentioned, generally there are not significant differences among the models after the 

matching. Some wells can be pointed out, where LHM3 performed better than LHM2 as, 

for instance, the wells PROD5 and PROD6 of Figure C-6.
