ABSTRACT 

 

Green chemistry has drawn attention from researchers and even some 

industries due to concerns about the depletion of fossil oil reserves and 

aggravation in the global warming and other environmental issues. 

Polymeric materials from biofeedstocks-derived monomers are a 

promising environmentally friendly alternative to petrol-derived 

polymers, especially for high value added applications. In this context, 

vegetable oils and saccharides are interesting raw materials that can be 

applied as chemical platforms in the synthesis of novel fully renewable 

monomers through chemical modification. In addition, thiol-ene 

polymerization has been shown as a versatile tool to produce polymers 

from fully renewable ?,?-diene monomers bearing, for example ester, 

ether, or amide functional groups in the backbone chain. However, 

works portraying the polymerization of renewable monomers through 

thiol-ene polymerization in dispersed medium are still uncommon. 

Herein, it is presented the synthesis and characterisation of 

poly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles via thiol-ene polymerization in 

miniemulsion using a monomer derived from renewable resources. The 

synthesis of a renewable ?,?-diene diester monomer, dianhydro-D-

glucityl diundec-10-enoate (DGU), produced from 10-undecenoic acid 

(derived from castor oil) and isosorbide (derived from starch) was 

performed. DGU was copolymerized with 1,4-butanedithiol (Bu(SH)2) 

through thiol-ene polymerization both in bulk and miniemulsion to yield 

linear semi-crystalline poly(thioether-ester)s. Different parameters were 

evaluated such as reaction temperature, initiator concentration, 

surfactant type and surfactant concentration. Particle size distribution 

and morphology was observed by DLS and TEM respectively resulting 

in spherical particles with an intensity average particle diameter around 

200 nm. Polymer with higher molecular weight was obtained by 

miniemulsion polymerization when compared to bulk polymerization. 

Number average molecular weight of 11 kDa was obtained through 

miniemulsion polymerization at 80°C for 4h using AIBN at 1 mol% (in 

relation to Bu(SH)2). Furthermore, DSC and XRD analyses have shown 

that the synthesized polymer was semi-crystalline with a degree of 

crystallinity above 20% and Tm around 60°C. Finally, depending on the 

co-stabilizer type, hexadecane or Crodamol, and amount, phase 

segregation within polymer particles was observed through DSC.

RESUMO 

 

A química verde tem chamado a atenção de pesquisadores e até mesmo 

de algumas indústrias devido à preocupação com o esgotamento das 

reservas fósseis e o agravamento de problemas ambientais. Materiais 

poliméricos obtidos de monômeros derivados de fontes renováveis são 

uma alternativa ambientalmente correta aos polímeros derivados do 

petróleo, especialmente para aplicações de alto valor agregado. Neste 

contexto, óleos vegetais e sacarídeos são matérias-primas interessantes 

que podem ser utilizadas como plataformas químicas para a síntese de 

novos monômeros, completamente renováveis, através da modificação 

química. Além disso, polimerização tiol-eno mostrou-se uma versátil 

ferramenta para a produção de polímeros a partir de monômeros verdes 

(?,?-dienos) providos de grupos funcionais como éster, éter ou amida na 

cadeia principal. Entretanto, trabalhos sobre a polimerização de 

monômeros renováveis através da polimerização tiol-eno em meios 

dispersos ainda são escassos. Neste trabalho, a síntese e a caracterização 

de nanopartículas de poli(tioéter-éster) via polimerização tiol-eno em 

miniemulsão usando um monômero proveniente de fontes renováveis 

são apresentadas. O monômero verde utilizado é um ?,?-dieno diéster, 

diundec-10-enoato de dianidro-D-glucitila (DGU), produzido a partir de 

ácido 10-undecenóico (derivado do óleo de mamona) e isosorbídeo 

(derivado do amido). DGU foi copolimerizado com 1,4-butanoditiol 

(Bu(SH)2) através polimerização tiol-eno em massa e em miniemulsão 

para produzir poli(tioéter-éster) linear e semicristalino. Diferentes 

parâmetros foram avaliados, como por exemplo temperatura, 

concentração de iniciador, tipo e concentração do surfactante. A 

distribuição de tamanho e a morfologia das partículas foram observadas 

por DLS e TEM respectivamente, revelando partículas esféricas com 

diâmetro de 200 nm. O polímero obtido pela polimerização em 

miniemulsão, 11 kDa onde as condições reacionais foram 80°C por 4h 

usando 1 mol% de AIBN (em relação ao Bu(SH)2), mostrou-se com 

maior massa molar em comparação àquele obtido em polimerização em 

massa. Análises de DSC e DRX mostraram que o polímero sintetizado é 

semicristalino com grau de cristalinidade de pelo menos 20% e Tm em 

torno de 60°C. Dependendo do tipo de co-estabilizador utilizado, 

hexadecano ou Crodamol, e da quantidade, pode-se observar por DSC 

segregação de fases nas partículas poliméricas.

renovável. Nanopartícula.

CHAPTER I 
 

1 INTRODUCTION 
 

Green chemistry has drawn attention from researchers and even 

some industries due to concerns about the depletion of fossil oil reserves 

and aggravation in the global warming and other environmental issues 

(CLARK, 2009). Therefore, in the past few decades, sustainable efforts 

have been extensively devoted to prepare new polymers from renewable 

environmentally friendly raw materials. In this context, fatty acids from 

vegetable oils and saccharides, or sugars, stand out as highly convenient 

raw materials because they are both abundant worldwide, inexpensive, 

provide stereochemical diversity and can potentially yield biocompatible 

and biodegradable materials (MEIER; METZGER; SCHUBERT, 2007; 

BELGACEM; GANDINI, 2008).  

However, polymerization attempts of vegetable oils, which are 

multifunctional monomers, usually ended up with the synthesis of cross-

linked polymers. Vegetable oils are usually copolymerized to non-

renewable monomers such as styrene (LU; LAROCK, 2010; MEIORIN; 

ARANGUREN; MOSIEWICKI, 2012), divinylbenzene, norbonadiene, 

and acrylates (LU; LAROCK, 2009, 2010) to achieve the required 

thermal and mechanical properties. On the other hand, they are 

promising platforms for the synthesis of novel monomers by chemical 

modification. Vegetable oils are mainly composed by triglycerides, 

which in its turn possess several reaction sites within the molecule such 

as the acyl group, double bonds and even hydroxyls that can undergo 

chemical modifications to yield a vast variety of monomeric molecules 

(MUTLU, 2012; VILELA; SILVESTRE; MEIER, 2012). By designing 

the monomer using vegetable oils, or other biofeedstocks such as sugars, 

as chemical platform, it is possible to include in the polymer molecule 

functional groups or even chemical bonds that facilitate biodegradation. 

For example, the inclusion of strategically positioned grafts in the 

polymeric back-bone that could enable the enzymes to attach more 

easily to the substrate binding site or the inclusion of disulphide bonds 

in the polymer‘s main chain. 

Thiol-ene reactions are often considered as either click or green 

chemistry reactions because they can be carried out at mild conditions, 

normally achieve high conversion and do not generate any 

environmentally hazardous by-products (HOYLE; LEE; ROPER, 2004; 

HOYLE; BOWMAN, 2010; CLAUDINO, 2011). Thiol-ene reactions 

have been extensively utilized for surface and molecules 



 

 

 

functionalization (FEIDENHANS‘L et al., 2014; CHEN et al., 2015; 

IONESCU et al., 2015; KUHLMANN et al., 2015), molecules 

conjugation (STENZEL, 2013; KUHLMANN et al., 2015), crosslinking 
(ACOSTA ORTIZ et al., 2010; WANG et al., 2013), grafting (KOLB; 

MEIER, 2013), UV-curable coatings (BLACK; RAWLINS, 2009; 

SANGERMANO et al., 2009; ÇAKMAKÇI et al., 2012) and 
polymerization of renewable monomers (KREYE; TÓTH; MEIER, 

2011; TÜRÜNÇ et al., 2012; KOLB; MEIER, 2013; TÜRÜNÇ; 
MEIER, 2013; YOSHIMURA et al., 2015). 

Thiol-ene polymerization possess a step-growth mechanism 

through free-radical reactions. A reaction between monofunctional ene 

and thiol molecules leads to adducts. Difunctional monomers 

polymerize to yield linear polymers, whilst multifunctional monomers 

form a polymeric network (CRAMER et al., 2003). Most of the work 
found in the literature portrays cross-linked thiol-ene polymers, such as 

hydrogels and resins, to use in diverse applications that range from 

photocurable coatings (BLACK; RAWLINS, 2009; CARLBORG et al., 

2014) to biomedical (KI et al., 2014; LIN; KI; SHIH, 2015). Recently, 

linear thiol-ene polymers have been utilized to synthesize nano- and 

microparticles through heterogeneous phase polymerization 

techniques (DURHAM; SHIPP, 2014; JASINSKI et al., 2014a; LOBRY 
et al., 2014; AMATO et al., 2015).  

Moreover, thiol-ene polymerization has been shown as a versatile 

tool to produce polymers from fully renewable ?,?-diene monomers 

bearing, for example ester, ether, or amide functional groups in the main 

chain (TÜRÜNÇ; MEIER, 2013). Some of these moieties, such as ester 

functionality, are interesting because they can be readily hydrolysed and 

therefore are potentially (bio) degradable. Moreover, sulphide bonds 

were found to tune degradability of acrylates (RYDHOLM; BOWMAN; 

ANSETH, 2005; RYDHOLM et al., 2006b; RYDHOLM; ANSETH; 

BOWMAN, 2007). 

Based on the above facts and considerations, polymeric materials 

from biofeedstocks-derived monomers are a promising environmentally 

friendly alternative to petrol-derived polymers, especially for purposes 

as biomedical applications when either biocompatibility or 

biodegradability (or even both) become highly relevant. Nanoparticles 

from renewable monomers are only recently being studied, in addition 

there are only 4 papers, so far, published in the literature concerning 

thiol-ene polymerization in heterogeneous systems. Thiol-ene 

polymerization in miniemulsion is a promising technique to synthesize 

nanoparticles, or even nanocapsules and hybrid particles, from 

26



 

 

 

renewable monomers. Besides, thiol-ene polymerization kinetics in 

miniemulsion is expected to greatly differ from both traditional free-

radical and step-growth miniemulsion polymerizations and it certainly 

needs to be evaluated.

CHAPTER II 
 

2 SYNTHESIS OF MONOMERS FROM RENEWABLE 

RESOURCES 
 

In the past few decades, efforts to achieve sustainability in 

diverse scientific and technologic fields have been done. Concerns about 

the depletion of fossil oil reserves and an aggravation in the global 

warming are driving a pursuit for renewable raw materials 

substituents(MEIER; METZGER; SCHUBERT, 2007). The utilization 

of renewable resources should be a compromise assumed in the 

development of new technologies. The replacement of the traditional 

non-renewable raw materials of existent technologies should also be 

stimulated. 

Renewable raw materials commonly utilized in the chemical 

industry are plant oils, polysaccharides from vegetal or animal fonts 

(starch, cellulose, chitosan and chitin), mono- and disaccharides, and 

wood (cellulose, lignin, hemicellulose and natural rubber) (MEIER; 

METZGER; SCHUBERT, 2007; BELGACEM; GANDINI, 2008; 

MUTLU, 2012). 

The modification of natural polymers is a longstanding approach, 

which has been exhaustively investigated since the nineteenth century. 

There are several techniques developed to chemically modify natural 

polymers in order to achieve the desired characteristic for the material, 

e.g. inserting functional groups, cross-liking, blending or 

copolymerizing to a different class of polymer (SHALABY; SHAH, 

1991; GÜNAY; THEATO; KLOK, 2011, 2013). However, modifying 

naturally-obtained materials can be complicated due to its structural 

complexity. On the other hand, the synthesis of novel classes of 

monomers is a very interesting manner of designing the polymeric 

macromolecule and overcome some issues such as (bio) degradability 

and physical properties. 

By designing the monomer, it is possible to include in the 

polymeric molecule functional groups or even chemical bonds that 

facilitate biodegradation, e.g.  the inclusion of strategically positioned 

grafts in the polymeric backbone that could enable the enzymes to attach 

more easily to the substrate binding site or the inclusion of disulphide 

bonds in the polymer‘s main chain. 

Modification of natural polymers is also restrained to the physical 

properties of the material to be modified. Desired features for specific 

applications could be more easily reached by polymerization of 



 

 

 

monomeric species rather than modification of an already existing 

macromolecule. 

 

2.1 VEGETABLE OILS AS RENEWABLE RESOURCES IN 

POLYMER CHEMISTRY 

 

Vegetable oils are one of the most widely used renewable 

resources in the chemical industries owing to their excellent 

environmental credentials, including their biodegradability, low toxicity, 

avoidance of volatile organic chemicals, easy availability and relatively 

low price (VERHÉ, 2004; BELGACEM; GANDINI, 2008). According 

to a report from USDA (2015), the global production of the major 

vegetable oils in the period 2013/14 summed 170.87 million metric tons 

(Table 1), comparing it to annual production from 2012/13 there was an 

increase of roughly 10 million metric tons. The prospective is that the 

worldwide production continues to rise based on the data from Table 1.

Vegetable oil‘s average price is higher when compared to petrol, 

for instance palm, canola and coconut oils have average prices (Oct-Sept 

2013/14) of respectively USD 803; 954; 1278 per metric ton according 

to USDA. Crude oil‘s price for the same period was USD 93.26 and 

98.52 per barrel from WTI (EUA) and Brent (Europe), 

respectively (EIA, 2015), which is approximately USD 684 and 722 per 

metric ton depending on the oil density. The price of vegetable oil is 

expected to decrease in the future with the increase of its utilization in 

sustainable industries. In fact, vegetable oils are used in chemical 

industries as ingredients or components in many manufactured products, 

such as soaps, drying agents, paints, coatings, insulators, hydraulic 

fluids, lubricants, monomers (e.g. dimer acids and polyols) and 

polymers (TURLEY, 2008). 

Vegetable oils consist mainly of triglycerides (TG), about 93–98 

wt.%, together with di- and monoglycerides and phosphoglycerides as 

minor components (SENIHA GÜNER; YA?CI; TUNCER ERCIYES, 

2006; LU; LAROCK, 2009). Triglycerides consist of three fatty acid 

chains esterified to a glycerol molecule (Figure 1). TG differ 

dramatically in the ratio and the type of fatty acids, which depends on 

their origins (Table 1). Table 2 shows the fatty acid content and double 

bond per TG of commodity vegetable oils from different origins.

Some important structural features make the fatty acids an 

interesting platform for polymer chemistry such as straight carbon chain, 

unsaturation, also some special fatty acids contain other functional 

groups such as hydroxy or epoxy groups in the vicinity of the double 

bonds (VERHÉ, 2004). Figure 2 shows the chemical structures of the 

fatty acids most commonly used in polymer chemistry: oleic, linoleic, 

linolenic, ricinoleic, and erucic acids (ESPINOSA; MEIER, 2011).

2.1.1 Polymerization of Vegetable Oils 

 

The polymerization of plant oil has been vastly studied, however 

it is still a challenge to obtain polymers suitable for applications in 

which petrol derived polymers are already well-established (LU; 

LAROCK, 2009, 2010). Triglycerides can undergo cationic 

polymerization (LI; LAROCK, 2005), free radical polymerization 

(ESEN; KÜSEFO?LU; WOOL, 2007), or olefin metathesis 

polymerization (RYBAK; FOKOU; MEIER, 2008; ROMERA et al., 

2015), due to the presence of double bonds in their chain. 

 

2.1.1.1 Free Radical Polymerization of Vegetable Oil 
 

Carbon-carbon double bonds contained in plant oils are likely to 

be polymerized via free radical mechanism. Even so, radical 

polymerization of fatty acids and triglycerides has not been given plenty 

attention due to the presence of chain transfer processes which occur in 

the allylic positions of fatty acids chains (LU; LAROCK, 2009). Chain 

transfer processes reduce the average molecular weight of the final 

polymer; therefore, there is a high chance of obtaining low molecular 

weight polymers through free radical method. 

Conjugated carbon–carbon double bonds in vegetable oils are 

usually used for free radical polymerization because their double bonds 

are relatively easily attacked by free radicals (LI; LAROCK, 2001, 

2002a; LI; HANSON; LAROCK, 2001). 

 

2.1.1.2 Cationic Polymerization of Plant Oil 

 

Carbon-carbon double bonds in fatty acids are slightly more 

nucleophilic than those in ethylene and propylene; therefore, vegetable 

oils are also capable of being polymerized through cationic route. The 

conjugated double bonds from drying oils – oils that undergo 

crosslinking by the action of oxygen – are even more reactive for 

cationic polymerization. Plant oils can be thermodynamically considered 

as cationic monomers (LU; LAROCK, 2009) 

 

2.1.1.3 Olefin Metathesis Polymerization of Plant Oils 

 

Olefin metathesis is a metal-catalysed reaction where the 

alkylidene groups are exchanged. The most common metal-complexes, 

utilized for this process, are those containing W, Mo, Re or Ru.  

33



 

 

 

Several techniques have been developed for olefin metathesis to 

be employed in polymer synthesis such as acyclic diene 

metathesis (ADMET) polymerization (RYBAK; FOKOU; MEIER, 

2008), acyclic triene metathesis (ATMET) polymerization (RYBAK; 

FOKOU; MEIER, 2008; ROMERA et al., 2015) and ring-opening 

metathesis polymerization (ROMP) (XIA; LAROCK, 2010).  

Meier‘s group (2008) has performed ADMET and ATMET 

polymerizations of soybean oil and glyceryl triundec-10-enoate 

respectively, resulting in a range of materials from sticky oils to rubber. 

Romera and colleagues (2015) studied the ATMET polymerization of 

linseed oil both in bulk and in miniemulsion. The authors reported low 

molecular weight (MN = 6 kDa) and justified that the presence of oleic 
acid moieties and saturated fatty acids limited both molecular weight 

increase and cross-linking because they acted as chain-stoppers. 

 

2.3 MONOMERS FROM PLANT OILS 
 

Despite all the attempts to synthesize green polymers capable of 

replacing commercial polymers, the polymerization of raw vegetable 

oils has not quite shown itself as a suitable alternative to achieve 

physical and chemical properties similar to petrol-derived polymers. The 

polymerization attempts of triglycerides, which are multifunctional 

monomers, usually ended up with the synthesis of cross-linked 

polymers. Vegetable oils are usually copolymerized to non-renewable 

monomers such as styrene, divinylbenzene, norbonadiene and acrylates  

to achieve the required physical-chemical properties (LI; LAROCK, 

2001, 2002b; LI; HANSON; LAROCK, 2001; LU; LAROCK, 2009, 

2010; MEIORIN; ARANGUREN; MOSIEWICKI, 2012). 

Novel monomers derived from plant oils have been investigated 

due to the possibility of designing the monomeric molecules. Many 

types of polymers can be synthesized from fatty acids-derived 

monomers; for instance polyesters and polyamides (MEIER; 

METZGER; SCHUBERT, 2007; KREYE et al., 2012; VILELA; 

SILVESTRE; MEIER, 2012). 

Fatty acids are very interesting platforms for novel monomers 

syntheses because they provide a vast stereochemical diversity and a 

variety of chemical modifications are possible. There are typically 5 

chemically reactive sites, shown in Figure 3, where a triglyceride can be 

chemically modified to synthesize different kinds of monomers 

(MUTLU, 2012).  

 

34

sites.

Many are the chemical reactions that triglycerides can be 

submitted to, e.g. hydrolysis, transesterification, halogenation, 

saponification, reduction, amination, ozonolysis, epoxidation, 

metathesis, thiol-ene coupling, carbonylation, addition reaction, Fiedel-

Krafts alkylation, Claisen condensation, ?-oxidation and numerous 

more. Traditionally most of the reactions utilized to modify the chemical 

structure of fatty acids focus on the ester group to synthesize fatty 

alcohols, soaps, esters, thioesters, hydrazides, amides or amines. 

However, in the past two decades the attention has turned to 

functionalize the alkyl chain of the fatty acid, especially through 

reactions involving the double bond present in some fatty acids chains 

(MUTLU, 2012).  

Many sorts of monomers can be synthesized starting from 

vegetable oil platforms, such as hydrocarboxylic acids, hydroxyesters, 

diesters, dicarboxylic acids, polyols and ?,? dienes containing several 

functionalities (OVETKOVI? et al., 2008; RYBAK; MEIER, 2008; 

QUINZLER; MECKING, 2009, 2010; KREYE; TÓTH; MEIER, 2011; 

TRZASKOWSKI et al., 2011; KREYE et al., 2012; CARDOSO et al., 
2014) 

Ovetkovi? et al. (2008), synthesized 9-hydroxynonanoic acid 
methyl ester from castor oil through ozonation followed by reductive 

ozonolysis. The monomer was prepared in two steps and then 

polycondensed to yield polyhydroxy alcanoate. Quinzler and Mercking 

(2010) used catalysed methoxycarbonylation reactions (PUGH; 

PRINGLE; DRENT, 2001; JIMÉNEZ-RODRIGUEZ; EASTHAM; 

COLE-HAMILTON, 2005) to produce ?,?-diesters monomers from 
unsaturated fatty acid esters and subsequently longer-chain aliphatic 

polyesters (Mw up to 2·10
4
 g·mol

-1)
. Interestingly, the complete 

incorporation of the carbon-backbone in the polymeric chain provided 

sufficient melt and crystallization temperatures for thermoplastic 

35



 

 

 

processing and applications similar to conventional non-renewable 

polymers.  

Yang and co-workers (2010) described a biochemical route to 

produce ?-carboxy fatty acid monomers from oleic, erucic and epoxy 

stearic acids through whole-cell biotransformations catalysed by C. 

tropicalis ATCC20962. After the biochemical oxidation of terminal 

methyl groups into carboxylic acids moieties, the monomers underwent 

enzymatically catalysed polycondensation with diols yielding polyesters 

formed by unsaturated and epoxidized repeating units, i.e. a good 

retention of functionality of the fatty acid was observed. 

Trzaskowski and co-workers (2011) synthesized poly (1,20-

eicosadiyl-1,20-eicosanedioate) (Mn = 10
4
 g mol

-1
) through 

polycondensation of stoichiometric amounts of 1,20-eicosanedioc acid 

and eicosane-1,20-diol catalyzed by titanium alkoxides. The C20 diacid 

and C20 diol used as co-monomers were synthesized by self-metathesis 

of undec-10-enoic acid followed by hydrogenation. The corresponding 

?,?-diene undec-10-enyl undec-10-enoate was prepared by esterification 

of undecenoic acid with undec-10-en-1-ol catalysed by titanium 

isopropoxide as previously reported in the literature by Rybak and Meier 

(2008). ADMET polymerization of the corresponding ?,?-diene yielded 

a molecular weight 2.8 times higher.  

Kreye et al. (2011) synthesized through Ugi reaction (UGI; 

FETZER; STEINBRÜCKNER, 1959; DÖMLING, 2006) ?,?-diene amide 

monomers . Kreye and colleagues produced successfully different 

varieties of poly-1-(alkylcarbamoyl) carboxamides via ADMET and 

thiol-ene polymerization. Thus, Ugi reaction is a powerful tool to 

synthesize highly substituted ?,?-diene amide monomers from 

renewable resources, in this case, castor oil derivatives. 

Vilela and co-workers (2012) reported the utilization of a fatty 

acid from rapeseed oil, erucic acid, as platform to produce monomers by 

self-metathesis followed by hydrogenation of the 9-? unsaturation, 

yielding 1,26-hexacosanedioic acid. This long-chain ?,?-dicarboxylic 

acid was then polycondensed to hexacosane-1,26-diol, generated from 

the former by reduction, which yielded an aliphatic long-chain polyester 

26,26. The research group also successfully polymerized the 1,26-

hexacosanedioic acid with short-chain alkanediols, dodecane-1,12-diol 

and butane-1,4-diol, generating polyesters 12,26 and 4,26, respectively. 

Cardoso et al. (2014) synthesized an ?,?-diene diester, namely 

1,3-propylene diundec-10-enoate, from undec-10-oic acid and 1,3-

propanediol derived from castor oil and glycerol, respectively. ?,?-

Diene diester monomer underwent homopolymerization through 

36



 

 

 

ADMET both in bulk and in miniemulsion. Polymer particles obtained 

from miniemulsion presented sizes from 150 to 350 nm, depending on 

the type and concentration of the surfactants utilized. ADMET 

polymerization in miniemulsion yielded polymers with higher molecular 

weight (Mn up to 15 kDa) than ADMET polymerization in bulk (Mn up 

to 7 kDa). 

 

2.4 SUGARS AS RENEWABLE RESOURCES IN POLYMER 

CHEMISTRY 

 
Sugars or carbohydrates, as vegetable oils, are renewable 

resources that have been explored in polymer chemistry. Carbohydrates 

are essential building blocks in nature, therefore are widely available at 

inexpensive prices. The total global supply of carbohydrates in 2012 

was 2.4 billion tons; in addition, cellulosic material and others wastes 

can be processed into sugar, e.g. by hydrolysis with acids, and other 

organic raw materials for chemical industries (DELOITTE, 2014). 

Consequently, the inevitable changeover of the chemical industry to 

biofeedstocks as its raw materials, due to fossil resources depletion, 

might certainly embrace carbohydrates and its derivatives. In polymer 

chemistry, carbohydrates are important building blocks to produce 

biodegradable and biocompatible materials. There is a rich variety of 

sugar-based monomers that can be obtained, e.g. alditols; lactones, 

aldonic and aldaric acids; and aminosugars (GALBIS; GARCÍA-

MARTÍN, 2008). 

 

2.4.1 Polymerization of sugar-based monomers 

 

Carbohydrates are multifunctional monomers; therefore, its 

polymerization is not straightforward. Their functionality usually needs 

to be reduced in order to prevent side reactions, for instance overly 

crosslinked polymers. (GALBIS &amp;amp; GARCÍA-MARTIN, 2008). The 

most representative sugar-derived polymers that have been synthesized 

are polyesters, polycarbonates, polyethers, and polyurethanes, usually 

synthesized from dianhydroalditols (OKADA; TACHIKAWA; AOI, 

1997, 2000; YOKOE; KEIGO; OKADA, 2003; GALBIS; GARCÍA-

MARTÍN, 2008; FENOUILLOT et al., 2010; BESSE et al., 2013; 
YOON et al., 2013; POLLONI, 2014; SADLER et al., 2014).  

Alditols are polyols and they occur extensively in nature. In 

addition, aldoses and ketoses can be reduced to alditols with the 

37



 

 

 

generation of new hydroxyl groups from the carbonyl functions; for 

instante, D-glucose (aldose) is reduced into D-glucitol (polyol), trivially 

referred to as ?sorbitol‘. The reduction of ketoses generates a new 

stereogenic centre, and gives two epimeric alditols; for example, D-

fructose produces D-mannitol and D-glucitol. Acyclic alditols are 

multifunctional molecules; therefore, in order to avoid undesirable side-

reactions, their cyclic forms, dianhydroalditols, are usually used in 

polymer chemistry. Furthermore, the thermostability of these 

dianhydroalditol monomers may be higher than that of other aliphatic 

diols, which raises the glass transition temperature of the corresponding 

polymers (GALBIS; GARCÍA-MARTÍN, 2008). 

 

2.4.2 Isosorbide 

 

Isosorbide (dianhydro-D-glucitol) is a polyol indirectly derived 

from glucose. It is produced by dehydration from sorbitol and, therefore, 

it is a renewable raw material from biomass. Dianhydro D-glucitol has 

been produced in industrial scale by several years due to the commercial 

importance of its nitro and methyl derivatives. The production is a 

multi-step process where isosorbide is the very last product, starting 

from starch and going on with D-glucose and sorbitol. Isosorbide has 

been already remarkably commented and discussed in the literature as 

an important chemical platform for the future replacement of petroleum-

based materials (FLÈCHE; HUCHETTE, 1986; ROSE; PALKOVITS, 

2012).

Isosorbide is a secondary cyclic alcohol made of two cis fused 

tetrahydrofuran rings. The angle between the rings is 120°, with two 

secondary alcohol groups in position 2 and 5. The hydroxyl in position 2 

is in exo conformation while the one in 5 has an endo conformation, 

what promotes an intra-molecular hydrogen bond that can be detected 

through IR spectroscopy (FLÈCHE; HUCHETTE, 1986). Some 

physical-chemical properties of crystallized isosorbide are shown in 

Table 3.

Isosorbide possesses a unique chemical structure and it is worth 

to comment some details on its reactivity. Hydroxyl groups‘ reactivity in 

position 2 and 5 depends on the reagent and the solvent used and on the 

steric hindrance, especially in the case of substitution reactions that 

could be either inside or outside the V-rings. For example, the endo-

group 5 presents higher reactivity toward esterification with acyl halides 

due to intra-molecular hydrogen bonding of this group with the adjacent 

ring-oxygen atom, whereas it has been demonstrated that esterification 

with acetic anhydride in pyridine takes place favourably in position 

2 (FLÈCHE; HUCHETTE, 1986). 

Isosorbide has been widely used in the pharmaceutical industry 

for several years. Its nitro and dinitro derivatives are known since 1939 

as vaso-dilators and there is a great interest in using dinitrate isosorbide 

for infarct treatment (FLÈCHE; HUCHETTE, 1986) 

In the field of polymeric materials, isosorbide, as a diol, is firstly 

employed to synthesize or modify polycondensates, such as 

polyurethanes and polyesters (FENOUILLOT et al., 2010). Nonetheless, 
due to its physical-chemical properties, isosorbide has also been applied 

in the synthesis of novel monomers to be polymerized via 

metathesis (FOKOU; MEIER, 2009).

Fokou and Meier (2009) described the synthesis of a novel 

monomer using isosorbide and 10-undecenoic acid as 100% renewable 

building blocks. The resulting molecule is an ?,?- diene diester and it 

was polymerized by ADMET polymerization. They obtained polyesters 

with molecular weight (Mn) up to 8400 Da depending on the reaction 

conditions; also they reported the physical-chemical characteristics of 

the polymer such as melting temperature and degree of isomerization. 

Yoon and co-workers (2013) produced high-molecular-weight 

polyester, up to 71100 Da weight-average molecular weight, and with a 

high Tg of 131°C. Isosorbide was esterified to cis/trans-1,4-

cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid to yield homopolyesters. Isosorbide is a 

diol with considerably low reactivity which normally results in a long 

polymerization time. However, the authors utilized acetic anhydride to 

perform an in situ acetylation of isosorbide, they found out that this 
method accelerates the chain growth of the polymer. 

Besse and colleagues (2013) synthesized isocyanate-free 

polyurethanes from isorsorbide derived dicyclocarbonate and four 

different diamines. Dicyclocarbonate was obtained from epoxidized 

isosorbide by carbonatation. Synthesized linear and branched 

polyhydroxyurethanes presented Tg from -8 to 59°C and degradation 

temperatures from 234 to 255°C depending on the diamine utilized. 

Sadler et al. (2014) utilized isosorbide as one of the diol 

structural constituents to produce unsaturated polyesters (UPE) to be 

used as thermosetting resins. Isosorbide was found to increase 

mechanical properties and Tg according to its concentration. However, 

the increase in the isosorbide content reduced the solubility of the resin 

in styrene, which was used as reactive diluent for blending the resins. 

Authors stated that although current formulations are inadequate for 

high-performance thermosetting applications, these resins do have 

viscosities that fall within the necessary ranges for composite 

application and adequately compare to some commercial UPE resins. 

Furthermore, it may be possible to use isosorbide in the future to 

improve current aromatic-based UPE resins. 

Azizi and co-workers (2014) synthesized isosorbide-based 

polyurethane microcapsules for cosmeto-textile applications. 

Microcapsules were prepared by interfacial polycondensation method in 

an o/w emulsion system. SEM images have clearly shown spherical 

core-shell morphology of the particles, where the shell was constituted 

of PU and the core was constituted of neroline perfume. Particles 

presented unimodal size distribution in volume, with an average particle 

40



 

 

 

size of 27 ?m. Encapsulation efficiency of perfume was determined 

through 
1
H NMR and accounted for 30%. 

Finally, isosorbide is an attractive renewable resource derived 

compound to be used in the polymeric materials field due to its unique 

bi-ring structure, physical-chemical properties and the fact that it is 

derived from starch, not from petroleum. Isosorbide polymers have 

superior thermal and optical properties due to its molecular rigidity and 

the chirality of its asymmetrical hydroxyl groups (YOON et al., 2013). 
In addition, several works can be found in the literature reporting 

biodegradable polymers obtained from isosorbide which widens its 

application scope (OKADA; TACHIKAWA; AOI, 1997, 2000; 

OKADA et al., 2000; OKADA, 2002; YOKOE; KEIGO; OKADA, 

2003; YOKOE; AOI; OKADA, 2005). 

 

2.5 FINAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 

An extensive number of papers have been published in the past 

two decades regarding the use of biofeedstocks in polymer chemistry. 

Herein, two promising platforms for novel renewable polymeric 

materials were presented: vegetable oils and carbohydrates. Both 

renewable raw materials are inexpensive and worldwide available.  

Natural polymers can be modified to yield different materials, for 

instance, natural rubber undergoes vulcanization and has its individual 

polymer chains cross-linked, improving mechanical properties. That 

being said, modifying naturally-obtained materials can be complicated 

due to its structural complexity, for example many natural polymers are 

multifunctional such as starch, a polymeric carbohydrate. On the other 

hand, the synthesis of novel classes of monomers is a very interesting 

manner of designing the polymeric macromolecule. 

Vegetable oils can undergo polymerization by different 

mechanisms, however, the straightforward polymerization of raw 

vegetable oils has not quite shown itself as a suitable alternative to 

achieve physical and chemical properties similar to petrol-derived 

polymers. Carbohydrates have been used to synthesize polyesters, 

polycarbonates, polyethers and polyurethanes. The most utilized 

carbohydrate monomers are dianhydroalditols, such as isosorbide, 

because they possess only two hydroxyl groups. 

Rather than being polymerized directly, triglycerides and 

carbohydrates can be used as chemical platforms for new monomers 

syntheses. Triglycerides and fatty acids by extension, and carbohydrates 

feature a vast stereochemical diversity and many reactive sites that can 

41



 

 

 

be chemically modified. One of the purposes of the present study is, 

therefore, to combine both fatty acid and carbohydrate into an 

environmentally friendly monomer. 10-Undecenoic acid, obtained bt 

pyrolysis of castor oil, and isosorbide, derived from starch, were utilized 

to synthesize a ?,?-diene diester monomer.

3 THIOL-ENE REACTIONS 
 

Thiol-ene reactions are often considered as click-chemistry 

reactions because they can be carried out under mild conditions and 

normally provide a high yielding and generation of inoffensive by-

products (HOYLE; LEE; ROPER, 2004; HOYLE; BOWMAN, 2010). 

Novel materials are arising from thiol-ene reactions due to the interest 

on the unique crosslinking structure, improved mechanical properties, 

clean and environmentally harmless reaction, fast and regioselective 

polymerization, and degradability improvement that sulphide moieties 

can provide (REDDY; ANSETH; BOWMAN, 2005; RYDHOLM et al., 
2007; RYDHOLM; ANSETH; BOWMAN, 2007). In this context, thiol-

ene polymers containing hydrolysable functional groups (RYDHOLM; 

BOWMAN; ANSETH, 2005; RYDHOLM et al., 2006a, 2006b, 2007; 

RYDHOLM; ANSETH; BOWMAN, 2007; AIMETTI; MACHEN; 

ANSETH, 2009; WANG et al., 2013), e.g. ester groups, are especially 
interesting in order to obtain (bio) degradable materials. In addition, 

many of the diene monomers used in thiol-ene polymerization are 

derived from renewable raw materials (TÜRÜNÇ; MEIER, 2010, 2013; 

FIRDAUS; MONTERO DE ESPINOSA; MEIER, 2011; WU et al., 

2011; TÜRÜNÇ et al., 2012; VAN DEN BERG et al., 2013). 

Thiol-ene reactions have been extensively utilized for surface and 

molecules functionalization (FEIDENHANS‘L et al., 2014; CHEN et 

al., 2015; IONESCU et al., 2015; KUHLMANN et al., 2015), molecules 

conjugation (STENZEL, 2013; KUHLMANN et al., 2015), 

crosslinking (ACOSTA ORTIZ et al., 2010; WANG et al., 2013), 

grafting (KOLB; MEIER, 2013), UV-curable coatings (BLACK; 

RAWLINS, 2009; SANGERMANO et al., 2009; ÇAKMAKÇI et al., 

2012) and polymerization of renewable monomers (KREYE; TÓTH; 

MEIER, 2011; TÜRÜNÇ et al., 2012; KOLB; MEIER, 2013; 

TÜRÜNÇ; MEIER, 2013; YOSHIMURA et al., 2015). In addition, 

some studies reported a set of biomedical applications for thiol-ene 

polymers such as preparation of nanoparticles and hydrogels suitable for 

drug-delivery systems, biomimetic hydrogels, dental restorative resins 

and hydrogels for tissue regeneration (CARIOSCIA et al., 2005; LU et 



 

 

 

al., 2005; AIMETTI; MACHEN; ANSETH, 2009; ZOU et al., 2011; 

ROBERTS; BRYANT, 2013; ŠTORHA; MUN; KHUTORYANSKIY, 

2013; HACHET et al., 2014; KI et al., 2014; VANDENBERGH et al., 
2014; YANG et al., 2014). Thiol-ene polymers as biomaterials is, 

however, an underexplored field. 

 

3.1 HISTORY AND CONTEXT 

 

Thiol chemistry is a versatile tool and its use has been reported 

over several years comprising several fields. Posner (1905) first 

described, in 1905, the addition of mercaptans to olefins, the author 

reports the thiol coupling to different types of mono and bi-unsaturated 

compounds such as aliphatics, aromatics, terpenes, and hydroaromatics. 

Posner noticed that the structure of the olefin exercises strong influence 

on the fate of the reaction and that mercaptans are added to double 

bonds in an anti-Markovnikov arrangement. Furthermore, two of the 15 

studied diolefins, namely limonene and cyclo-pentadiene, yielded only 

monoaddition products, probably in reason of the different reactivity of 

the double bonds present in the molecules.  

Amongst a set of thiol group reactions, thiol-ene free radical 

addition drags special interest due to its application range and 

simplicity. Early work on this field has appeared in late 1930s to early 

1950s (KHARASCH; READ; MAYO, 1938; MEISSNER; 

THOMPSON, 1938; HOYLE; LEE; ROPER, 2004). For over 70 years 

the photochemistry of thiols has been investigated from several points of 

view e.g. thiol decomposition, as a source of hydrogen atoms in the gas 

phase and in solution, as a source of thiyl radicals (  ?) (CARLSON; 
KNIGHT, 1973). Marvel and Chambers (1948) developed the first 

method to synthesize solid polymeric alkylene sulphides with molecular 

weight up to 14 kDa based on papers published then that reported non-

distillable residues upon allyl mercaptan synthesis and afterward the 

utilization of dithiols and diolefins to synthesize liquid polymeric 

alkylene sulphides with molecular weight up to 1.3 kDa. 

Marvel and Chambers (1948) utilized a set of different dithiols 

and diolefins but the UV-initiated polymerization between 

hexamethylenedithiol and 1,5-hexadiene portrayed the best result. 

Infrared absorption analysis revealed that the synthesized linear 

polymers had a structure resulted from an anti-Markovnikov addition, 

which agrees with Posner‘s work. X-ray diffraction showed that the 

solid polymers obtained presented crystalline structure. 

44



 

 

 

There were several efforts, from late 1970s to early 1990s, to 

solidly introduce thiol-ene photopolymerization in industrial scale 

(HOYLE; LEE; ROPER, 2004). By the early 2000‘s many of the basics 

of thiol–ene chemistry were well defined, thiol-ene free-radical 

photoinitiated polymerization became significant due to several 

advantages over conventional free radical-polymerization such as fast 

reaction rates and reduced influence of oxygen inhibition. Their use for 

relatively simple materials applications, such as protective coatings and 

film were amply touted (HOYLE; LEE; ROPER, 2004; HOYLE; 

BOWMAN, 2010).  

In the past few years the growing interest in green chemistry has 

drawn attention to thiol-ene polymerization as a technique to synthesize 

polymers from non-depleting sources and in several others emerging 

technologies. Moreover, thiol-ene reactions are regioselective, most 

require mild conditions, and are insensitive to ambient conditions such 

as oxygen and humidity (HOYLE; BOWMAN, 2010); this versatility 

makes thiol-ene chemistry a promising tool that can be applied in a set 

of applications e.g. resins (AUVERGNE et al., 2012), protective 

polymers (BERGER; DELHALLE; MEKHALIF, 2009; 

SANGERMANO et al., 2009; ÇAKMAKÇI et al., 2012; CHEN et al., 

2015), polymers with optical properties (LI; ZHOU; HOYLE, 2009; 

FEIDENHANS‘L et al., 2014), biomedical and bioconjugated molecules 

(ROBERTS; BRYANT, 2013). 

Thiol-ene reaction relies on the liability of thiol hydrogen. 

Thermochemical characteristics of thiols are an important factor 

influencing mechanistic elucidations of thiol-ene kinetics. Initial work 

on thiol group free-radical reactions had been done through a 

photochemical approach (KNIGHT, 1974), however the cleavage of 

sulphur-hydrogen bond can be promoted indirectly by heat- or light- 

generated nucleophilic radicals obtained from the cleavage of initiators, 

as in conventional free-radical polymerization (HOYLE; LEE; ROPER, 

2004; CLAUDINO, 2011). 

The     bond is the weakest one in the molecule, about 73 
kcal mol

-1
, while the     bond is 88 ± 5 kcal mol

-1
. Regardless of this 

energy difference, the main decomposition is the     cleavage due to 
liability of the sulphydryl hydrogen, which is the essentially exclusive 

site of abstractive attack on thiol molecule. In a system where there are 

others molecules susceptible to radical attack, e.g. olefins, the 

considerably lower activation energy for hydrogen removal from thiol 

group as compared to other hydrogen donor groups results in a high 

reactivity (KNIGHT, 1974) 

45



 

 

 

The hydrogen abstraction from the thiol group generates highly 

reactive thiyl radicals (  ?) that add to a wide range of unsaturated 
compounds, virtually, any non-sterically hindered ene is capable of 

participating the reaction; though, for a given thiol, electron-rich enes 

polymerize much more rapidly than electron-poor enes (HOYLE; 

BOWMAN, 2010). The addition of a thiol across the olefin double bond 

is an exothermic reaction and the enthalpy depends mainly on the sort of 

the double bond, i.e. electron-poor double bonds give off more energy 

than electron-rich double bonds (HOYLE; BOWMAN, 2010). 

 

3.1.1 Thiol-ene reaction mechanism 

 

Primary studies regarding thiol-ene kinetics took place through 

the prism of photochemistry. The first investigations of the 

photochemical decomposition of thiols date back to 1938 

(KHARASCH; READ; MAYO, 1938; MEISSNER; THOMPSON, 

1938). Steer and Knight (1969) wrote a very elucidating paper on 

reactions of thiyl radicals; the authors studied the photolysis of 

methanethiol as a pure substrate and with added NO, as radical 

scavenger, C2H4, and inert gases. The mechanism proposed by the 

authors presented qualitative agreement to the observed kinetics data, 

thus several rate-constant ratios had been determined.   

Knight (1974) provided a detailed description of the kinetic steps 

of the photoinitiated addition of methanethiol to ethylene in gas phase: 

 

                ?   ? (1
) 

 ?            ?     (2
) 

 ?           ?   (3

  ?                       ? (4

                                       ? (5
) 

     ?

    ?               ?   (7
) 

      ?                ?            (8
) 

46



 

 

 

The previous mechanism presents the existing reactions involved 

in a thiol-ene addition elucidated by analysing the products formed in 

the overall reaction, in this instance: methyl ethyl sulphide (8), hydrogen 

(2), and ethane (4). Methyl ethyl sulphide (        ) is the major 
product observed in the process. Hydrogen and methyl ethyl disulphide, 

the main chain termination products, decrease with increasing ethylene 

pressure (STEER; KNIGHT, 1969).  

Knight‘s group (1969, 1973) studied the photolysis of 

mercaptans, namely ethanethiol, in condensed phase. Hydrogen and 

diethyl disulphide were the only products detected; in addition, 

hydrogen and disulphide yields were the same. Due to the equivalence 

between the reaction products, the authors ruled out termination through 

thyil radical disproportionation, therefore termination occurs by 

combination of two radicals. 

Martin, Jourdain and Le Bras (1988) wrote a clarifying paper 

portraying the fate of the hydrogen atom in reactions with methanethiol 

and ethanethiol; rather than participating in molecular hydrogen 

production or triggering the formation of a carbon-centred radical in the 

alkene,  ? can take part in hydrogen sulphide production among other 
possible reaction paths. The authors estimated kinetic constants and 

elucidated the reaction mechanisms. 

 

3.2 THIOL-ENE POLYMERIZATION 

 

Thiol-ene polymerization proceeds as the traditional free-radical 

polymerization, featuring three steps: initiation, propagation, and 

termination, plus a chain transfer step. In the mechanistically 

fundamental chain-transfer pace a carbon-centred radical transfers its 

electron to a thiol group. Generally, it is used a thiol:ene ratio of 1:1 in 

order to avoid side-reactions, such as reaction 6 where disulphide is 

formed. It is important to notice that a proper copolymerization between 

olefin and thiol molecules will only take place if the first is a diene and 

the latter a dithiol. 

Figure 5 shows a simplified scheme of thiol-ene 

copolymerization. Firstly, a thiol is decomposed into thiyl radicals 

through hydrogen abstraction, which can be by photo- or 
thermoinitiation with the aid or not of initiators. Secondly, the thiyl 

radical attacks the double bond and add to the olefin. Finally, chain 

transfer occurs and the unpaired electron from a carbon-centred radical 

is transferred to another thiol group and another thiyl radical is 

generated, re-initialising the cycle. Thus, thiol-ene polymerization 

47



 

 

 

revolves around the alternation between thiyl radical propagation across 

ene functional groups and chain-transfer reactions (HOYLE; 

BOWMAN, 2010). Termination, Figure 6, occurs through radical 

combination rather than disproportionation, as discussed by Carlson and 

Knight (1973), thiyl/thiyl coupling yielding a disulphide specie, 

thiyl/carbon-centred radical coupling and carbon-centred/carbon-centred 

radicals coupling. Cramer and co-workers (2003) elucidated   that chain 

transfer is the rate-limiting step by performing studies on thiol-ene 

photo-polymerization modelling through the polymerization kinetics 

behaviour.

In the ideal step-growth thiol–ene reaction, there is no 

propagation of the carbon-centred radical through the ene moiety 

(homopolymerization), the carbon-centred radical is always transferred 

to a thiol moiety.  Normally, conversions approach 100 % unless mass-

transfer limitations prevent such from being achieved. The net reaction, 

therefore, is simply the combination of the thiol and ene functional 

groups, which causes the molecular weight and network structure to 

evolve in a manner that is identical to any other step-growth 

polymerization reactions at the same time as empowering all of the 

benefits of a rapid, photo- or thermoinitiated radical mediated process 

(HOYLE; BOWMAN, 2010). The diene may undergo 

homopolymerization in a non-ideal system. It depends on the relative 

reactivity of both monomers, i.e., the propagation rate constant (  ) is 
significantly higher than chain transfer rate constant (   ). 

Differently from traditional free-radical polymerization, the 

presence of oxygen does not inhibit thiol-ene polymerization. In the 

presence of oxygen, additional chain-transfer reactions occur, the 

oxygen is incorporated into the growing polymer chains as a peroxy 

radical that undergoes chain transfer with a thiol to generate a thyil 

radical (CRAMER; BOWMAN, 2001). For a detailed discussion on the 

role of the oxygen in the thiol-ene reaction, the reader is referred to the 

49



 

 

 

work by O‘Brien, Cramer and Bowman (2006) approaching the overall 

effect of oxygen in thiol-acrylate photopolymerization. 

 

3.2.1 Reactivity of thiol and ene compounds 
 

Morgan, Magnota and Ketley (1977) evaluated  the effect of both 

thiol and olefin structures on the overall rate towards thiol-ene addition 

reaction. Their work stated two fundamental rules. First, the overall 

conversion of thiol-ene reaction is directly related to the electron density 

on the ene, with electron-rich enes reacting faster than electron-poor 

enes in reason of the electrophilic nature of thiyl radicals. Electron-

donating substituents attached or close to the double bond accelerate 

thiol addition while electron-withdrawing groups decrease the addition 

rate. The most common exception to this rule is when the carbon-

centred allyl radical is resonance-stabilized, e.g. conjugated dienes. 

Second, mercaptopropionate esters copolymerize more rapidly than 

mercaptoacetate esters, which in turn react more rapidly than alkyl 

mercaptans, because of the intramolecular interaction between the 

sulphydryl hydrogen and the carbonyl that weakens     bond 
enhancing hydrogen liability. 

Roper and co-workers (2004) also investigated the influence of 

chemical structure in the reactivity of alkenes towards thiol-ene 

photopolymerization and their results corroborate Morgan et al.‘s 

observations. Primarily, any non-hindered terminal ene group reacts 

rapidly and its aliphatic hydrocarbon substituent chain length has no 

effect on the reaction; accordingly, its reactivity is higher than internal 

alkenes. The authors observed that chain transfer to the thiol is the rate-

limiting step corroborating Cramer et al.‘s (2003) results. Therefore, any 
change in the alkene structure that disrupts chain transfer from the 

carbon-centred radical to the thiol, e.g. steric hindrance, causes a 

reduction in kct, and therefore decreases the overall reaction rate 

(ROPER et al., 2004). 

Hoyle; Lee &amp;amp; Roper (2004) classify the reactivity of the enes 

towards thiol-ene reaction through the ratio kp/kct; even though not all 

the olefins cited are dienes, the following sequence also can be 

considered regarding thiol-ene polymerization: 

Norborene &gt; Vinyl ether &gt; Propenyl &gt; Alkene ? Vinyl ester &gt; N-

Vinyl amides &gt; Allyl ether &gt; N-Vinyl amides &gt; Acrylate &gt; Acrylonitrile 

~ Methacrylate &gt; Styrene &gt; Conjugated dienes. 

Norborene presents a remarkably fast polymerization rate because 

of the significant energy liberation after the thiyl radical addition across 

50



 

 

 

the ?-bond, which reliefs the ring strain, and the succeeding quick H-

abstraction rate of the sulphydryl hydrogen by the carbon-centred 

radical. Methacrylate, styrene, and conjugated dienes possess low 

reaction rates owing to the high stability of their respective carbon-

centred radicals that have intrinsically low H-abstraction rate constants 

(HOYLE; LEE; ROPER, 2004). 

 

3.2.2 Thiol-ene polymers degradation 

 

Bowman‘s group performed primary works on the subject of 

thiol-ene polymers degradation. Initial studies in the literature presented 

results on thiol-acrylate polymers degradation and others containing the 

ester group in the main chain (poly (thioether-ester)) probably due to the 

ease hydrolysis of ester groups, already demonstrated elsewhere 

(MÜLLER; KLEEBERG; DECKWER, 2001; WITT et al., 2001; 

MUELLER, 2006; NAIR; LAURENCIN, 2007; LEJA; 

LEWANDOWICZ, 2010).  

Reddy, Anseth and Bowman (2005) investigated the 

degradability of thiol-acrylate hydrogels. The authors have shown it is 

possible to synthesize polymeric networks with specific degradation 

profiles. Hydrogels were obtained through copolymerizing 

multifunctional thiol monomers with PLA-b-PEG-b-PLA based 

diacrylate monomers.  Due to the nature of the acrylate double bonds, 

two different polymerization mechanisms are observed: chain growth 

polymerization, i.e. acrylate homopolymerization, and step growth 

polymerization, addition of thiol across the ene double bond.  The 

balance between these two mechanisms, which is controlled through 

stoichiometry, dictates the network structure and, ultimately, the 

degradation behaviour. In addition, the number of crosslinks per kinetic 

chain was shown to decrease with increasing thiol concentration or 

decreasing thiol functionality, thus providing a facile means to control 

the network evolution and hence the degradation behaviour. 

A paper recently published (WU et al., 2015) evaluated the acidic 

degradation of linear poly(ß-thioether ester) and poly(ß-thioether ester-

co-lactone) copolymers. Although Wu et al. chose an enzymatic 

polymerization route; ß-thioether ester moieties are achievable also 

through thiol-ene click chemistry. Wu et al. (2015) analyzed molecular 
weight loss and polydispersity variation according to the pH under 

which the degradation was carried out and to the duration of the 

degradation essay. The authors stated that the thioether-ester polymers 

are stable under physiological pH conditions but can be easily 

51



 

 

 

hydrolyzed under acidic conditions, and therefore these polymers are 

potential acid-degradable polymers for biomedical applications.  

Bowman‘s group obtained further results on biodegradability of 

thioether-ester polymers regarding the influence of the position of the 

sulphide groups in the degradation rate. Rydholm, Anseth &amp;amp; Bowman 

(2007) observed  that the distance between the sulphide and the ester 

groups affects directly the degradation. The closer the sulphide group is 

to the ester group the faster hydrolysis is; e.g. when the number of 

carbons between these two groups are increased from 1 to 2 hydrolysis 

rate constant became about 4 times lower. For further information 

regarding thioether-ester/acrylate polymers degradation, the reader is 

referred to the works of Bowman‘s group (REDDY; ANSETH; 

BOWMAN, 2005; RYDHOLM; BOWMAN; ANSETH, 2005; 

RYDHOLM et al., 2006b; RYDHOLM; ANSETH; BOWMAN, 2007). 
Natural and synthetic biodegradable polymers have prospective 

applications in drug and protein delivery, tissue engineering, and 

environmental issues. These polymers breakdown into smaller 

molecules under specific biological stimuli. Novel biomaterials are 

arising from thiol-ene polymerization due to the interest on the unique 

crosslinking structure, improved mechanical properties, clean and 

environmentally harmless reaction, fast and regioselective 

polymerization, and degradability improvement that thiol-ene moieties 

can provide (REDDY, ANSETH &amp;amp; BOWMAN, 2005; RYDHOLM, 

ANSETH &amp;amp; BOWMAN, 2007). Thiol-ene polymers are thereby good 

candidates for biomedical applications and some of these applications 

have already been reported in the literature (AIMETTI, MACHEN &amp;amp; 

ANSETH, 2009; WANG et al., 2013; VANDENBERGH et al., 2014). 
Bowman‘s group performed primary works on the subject of 

thiol-ene degradation. Initial studies in the literature presented results on 

degradation of thiol-acrylate hydrogels; probably due to the ease 

hydrolysis of ester groups already discussed elsewhere (MÜLLER; 

KLEEBERG; DECKWER, 2001; LUCAS et al., 2008; TIAN et al., 
2012). 

 

3.3 THIOL-ENE REATIONS: APPLICATIONS 
 

Thiol-ene reactions have been extensively utilized for surface and 

molecules functionalization (FEIDENHANS‘L et al., 2014; CHEN et 
al., 2015; IONESCU et al., 2015; KUHLMANN et al., 2015), molecules 

conjugation (STENZEL, 2013; KUHLMANN et al., 2015), crosslinking 

(ACOSTA ORTIZ et al., 2010; WANG et al., 2013), grafting (KOLB; 

52



 

 

 

MEIER, 2013), UV-curable coatings(BLACK; RAWLINS, 2009; 

SANGERMANO et al., 2009; ÇAKMAKÇI et al., 2012), and 

polymerization of renewable monomers. (KREYE; TÓTH; MEIER, 

2011; TÜRÜNÇ et al., 2012; KOLB; MEIER, 2013; TÜRÜNÇ; 

MEIER, 2013; YOSHIMURA et al., 2015). However, little attention has 

been paid to the potential to synthesize biocompatible and biodegradable 

polymers for biomedical application through thiol-ene polymerization. 

Natural and synthetic biodegradable polymers have prospective 

applications in drug and protein delivery, tissue engineering, and 

environmental issues. These polymers breakdown into smaller 

molecules under specific biological stimuli. Innovative biomaterials are 

arising from thiol-ene polymerization due to the interest on the unique 

crosslinking structure, improved mechanical properties, clean and 

environmentally harmless reaction, fast and regioselective 

polymerization, and degradability improvement that thiol-ene moieties 

can provide (REDDY; ANSETH; BOWMAN, 2005; RYDHOLM et al., 
2006b, 2007). Thiol-ene polymers are thereby good candidates for 

various biomedical applications, and some of these applications have 

already been reported in the literature (AIMETTI; MACHEN; 

ANSETH, 2009; WANG et al., 2013; VANDENBERGH et al., 2014; 

AMATO et al., 2015).  
 

3.4 FINAL CONSIDERATIONS 

 

Herein, the basics of thiol-ene polymerization and its applications 

were discussed. Thiol-ene polymerization is very often considered as a 

click-chemistry reaction for it can be carried out under mild conditions 

and normally provides a high yielding and generation of inoffensive 

byproducts. Thiol-ene polymerization is a versatile method that can be 

carried out by thermal or photoinitiation and normally yields high 

conversion (&gt;99%) and possess a rapid kinetics. In addition, by using 

monomers with different functionalities, it is possible to tune some 

polymers properties such as degree of crosslinking, degradability, 

shrinkage stress and other physical features. Depending on the 

application, different physical and chemical characteristics are desired; 

e.g. for drug release within the human body it is very important for 

polymeric vectors to be (bio) degradable, on the other hand it is essential 

for dental restorative composites or coatings to be non-degradable and 

possess hydrolytic stability.  

53



 

 

 

Applications for thiol-ene polymers in the past few years are 

mostly as hydrogels and cross-linked polymers. These polymers have 

been successfully synthesized comprising different kinds of 

multifunctional enes and thiols. Studies reported that thiol-ene polymers 

are suitable for preparation of nanoparticles, and hydrogels for drug-

delivery systems, biomimetic hydrogels, and dental restorative resins. 

Furthermore, many authors reported the possibility of tuning the surface 

chemistry of hydrogels and nanoparticles by using non-stoichiometric 

thiol-ene ratios, which could lead to free thiol groups on the surface, 

which in turn are capable of binding to other molecules such as proteins. 

This is a very good prospective to further study enzyme-responsive 

nanoparticles by anchoring a substrate on the nanoparticle surface. As a 

dental restorative resin, thiol-ene polymers displayed superior 

mechanical characteristics when compared to the currently utilized 

methacrylate resins. Thiol-ene polymers as biomedical materials is a 

field still underexplored; not many papers have been published under 

this subject even though there are many advantages in using these 

materials. For instance, it could be studied the accelerated ester group 

degradation due to the presence of sulphide moieties in the polymeric 

backbone towards drug release, the possibility to create bioconjugates 

on nanoparticles surface using non-reacted thiol groups on its surface to 

create stimuli-responsive nanocarriers and nanodevices for clinical 

exams and imaging.

CHAPTER IV 
 

4. MINIEMULSION POLYMERIZATION 

 

Miniemulsions are heterophase systems in which sub-

micrometric droplets of one phase, typically ranging from 50 to 500 

nm (ANTONIETTI; LANDFESTER, 2002), are dispersed in a second 

continuous phase. When the miniemulsion consists in an oil-in-water 

dispersion it is called direct miniemulsion; the contrary system, i.e. 

water-in-oil dispersion, is named inverse miniemulsion.  

In contrast to conventional emulsion polymerization, that features 

micelar nucleation, miniemulsion polymerization presents droplet 

nucleation, as shown in the pioneering work of Ugeldtad et al. (1973), 

i.e. there is no need for mass transfer of monomer through the 

continuous phase, and therefore the droplets are the polymerization loci. 

Ideally, this means that every droplet formed through 

(mini) emulsification process may become a particle after 

polymerization. Consequently, it is often considered that every droplet 

acts like a bulk polymerization nanoreactor (BECHTHOLD et al., 2000; 

ANTONIETTI; LANDFESTER, 2002).  

Miniemulsion is formed prior to polymerization by high shear 

energy (e.g. by ultrasonication or high-pressure homogenization) which 

breaks down the disperse phase into sub-micrometric droplets, typically 

droplet size range from 50 to 500 nm (BECHTHOLD et al., 2000; 

ANTONIETTI; LANDFESTER, 2002). Although miniemulsion 

droplets are thermodynamically unstable, they are kinetically metastable 

and therefore preserve their colloidal property for a few hours up until a 

few months. Figure 7 shows a scheme to produce a direct miniemulsion. 

Two immiscible phases are subjected to high shear, resulting in small, 

homogeneous, and narrowly distributed nanodroplets. Inside the droplet 

phase, an osmotic pressure agent (co-stabilizer) and possible agents for 

further encapsulation are included. In a subsequent reaction process, 

ideally no change of the droplets is observed (LANDFESTER, 2009).

The organic phase contains traditionally monomer, a co-

stabilizer, and initiator. Aqueous phase contains water and surfactant. 

Organic and aqueous phases undergo either a mechanical or a magnetic 

stirring to form a macroemulsion. Miniemulsion is then obtained when 

the macroemulsion is submitted to high shear energy by means of, 

usually, an ultrasonic probe. Once droplets are formed they may be 

polymerized into particles. Droplets are stabilized by two main 

mechanisms. First, surfactant minimizes droplets coalescence (see 

Figure 8) and stabilizes the particles electrostatically or sterically and 

hence impedes droplets, as well as particles, to come in close contact 

and aggregate. 

 

Second, miniemulsion always features a distribution in droplet 

size even when surfactant provides sufficient colloidal stability. 

Droplets with different sizes present different interfacial energies or 

Laplace pressures, which is inversely proportional to size, and this 

determines droplet size distribution; in addition, it is a driving force for 

Figure 8. Coalescence scheme.

diffusion between the droplets. Diffusion leads to the growth of the 

bigger droplets in detriment of the smaller ones, a process known as 

diffusional degradation or Ostwald ripening. Figure 9 shows a scheme 

of diffusional degradation. The addition of co-stabilizer in the dispersed 

phase, substance with the least water solubility of all components in the 

system, retards the diffusional degradation. 

 

 

Co-stabilizers cannot be able to diffuse through the aqueous 

phase from one droplet to another; therefore, a difference in 

concentration of the co-stabilizer inside the droplets, which increases 

with decreasing droplet size, creates a counterforce upon monomer 

diffusion. Consequently, due to the presence of co-stabilizer an osmotic 

pressure builds up that counteracts the Laplace pressure responsible for 

diffusional degradation. (ANTONIETTI; LANDFESTER, 2002; ASUA, 

2002; LANDFESTER, 2003; SCHORK et al., 2005; STAUDT et al., 

2013). 

Many types of polymerization reactions can be adapted to be 

carried out using a miniemulsion system, e.g. 

polycondensation (ANTONIETTI; LANDFESTER, 2002; BARRÈRE; 

LANDFESTER, 2003; LANDFESTER, 2003; VALÉRIO; ARAÚJO; 

SAYER, 2013; VALÉRIO et al., 2014), radical 

polymerization (ANTONIETTI; LANDFESTER, 2002; ASUA, 2002;

SCHORK, 2006; KOHRI et al., 2012), ATMET (DE O. ROMERA et 

al., 2015) and ADMET (CARDOSO et al., 2014) polymerization, and 
thiol-ene polymerization (JASINSKI et al., 2014b; LOBRY et al., 

2014). 

In addition, miniemulsion polymerization is a versatile technique 

to synthesize sub-micrometric particles or capsules that suit for a wide 

range of applications that can hardly be achieved through other 

heterophase processes, e.g. in situ encapsulation (ROMIO et al., 2009a, 

2009b; BERNARDY et al., 2010; CARDOSO; ARAÚJO; SAYER, 

2013), hybrid particles (ROMIO et al., 2013; STAUDT et al., 2013; 
CHIARADIA et al., 2015; MERKEL et al., 2015), drug delivery 

systems (MESSERSCHMIDT et al., 2009; BEHZADI et al., 2014; 

BAIER et al., 2015; FEUSER et al., 2015). 
 

4.1 THIOL-ENE POLYMERIZATION IN MINIEMULSION 

 

Thiol-ene polymerization in miniemulsion is a fresh field, many 

characteristics are still to be studied, such as kinetics and 

mechanism (JASINSKI et al., 2014b; LOBRY et al., 2014; AMATO et 

al., 2015). Some studies have been performed on the production of 
cross-linked polymer through thiol-ene polymerization in miniemulsion. 

Only in 2014, the first papers portraying the synthesis of linear polymers 

through thiol-ene polymerization were published.  

Lobry et al. (2014) published a short communication reporting 

the synthesis of linear poly(thioether) nanoparticles via thiol-ene 

photopolymerization in miniemulsion in a continuous-flow 

microreactor. Co-monomers used were ethylene glycol dithiol and 

diallyl adipate. Hexadecane was used as co-estabilizer against 

diffusional degradation and sodium dodecyl sulphate was used as 

surfactant. A thermal analysis of the produced polymer through DSC 

revealed a glass transition temperature (Tg) of – 63 °C and a melting 

temperature (Tm) of 18 °C. The polymer was insoluble in most organic 

solvents due to its high crystallinity (55%) and therefore the authors 

characterised the molecular weight only for the soluble part (M n = 

30 kDa). 

Jasinski et al. (2014) presented a complete work regarding the 
synthesis of linear poly(thioether) nanoparticles in miniemulsion using 

ethylene glycol dithiol and diallyl adipate as co-monomers.  Thiol-ene 

photopolymerization in miniemulsion yielded a poly(thioesther-ester) 

58



 

 

 

latex with average particle size of 130 nm. Calorimetric analyses 

showed a Tg of – 63 °C and a semicrystalline behaviour (degree of 

crystallinity = 55%) indicated by an endothermic melting peak at 18 °C 

and an exothermic recrystallization peak at 6 °C.  

Amato et al. (2015) synthesized cross-linked polythioether 

nanoparticles through thiol-ene photopolymerization in miniemulsion. 

Amato et al. investigated the effects of surfactant concentration, organic 

phase weight percentage and the influence of the co-stabilizer in thiol-

ene miniemulsions. In addition, by performing non-stoichiometric thiol-

ene polymerizations nanoparticles containing either thiol or ene 

functional groups on the surface, depending on which monomer was in 

excess, were obtained. These surface functional groups were utilized for 

post-polymerization modifications; fluorescent markers were attached to 

the surface. Polythioether nanoparticles with ene surface groups 

underwent radical-mediated thiol-ene addition with 7-mercapto-4-

methylcoumarin (blue marker), and nanoparticles with thiol surface 

groups underwent thiol-ene Michael addition with Texas Red maleimide 

(red marker). Post-polymerization modified nanoparticles were analysed 

via fluorescence microscopy. 

At first glance, thiol-ene polymerization in miniemulsion, as free-

radical reactions that follows through step-growth mechanism, might 

present kinetic characteristics very different from traditional free-radical 

miniemulsion polymerization. Few works have been published 

regarding thiol-ene bulk polymerization  (CRAMER; BOWMAN, 2001; 

CRAMER et al., 2003; COLE; JANKOUSKY; BOWMAN, 2013). 

Cramer et al. (2003) stated that in thiol-ene polymerization complicating 

kinetic factors from diffusion controlled reactions or early gelation are 

not as significant as in traditional chain growth systems because thiol-

ene systems do not exhibit conventional auto-acceleration behaviour and 

do not gel until high conversions are obtained due to their step-growth 

nature. However, many other important factors, such as the average 

number of radicals per particle, nucleation mechanism and solubility of 

the monomer(s) in the aqueous phase are relevant to miniemulsion 

polymerization kinetics (SCHORK et al., 2005). 
Furthermore, in thiol-ene co-polymerizations in miniemulsion 

where thiol and ene monomers possibly will present different solubility 

towards water, co-monomer composition in the polymerization locus, 

i.e. inside the droplets, might be quite different from the overall co-

monomer composition; and since thiol-ene reactions are very sensible to 

functional group ratio (thiol:ene) this could be a serious hindrance to 

overcome. 

59



 

 

 

4.2 FINAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 

Miniemulsion polymerization has become an important technique 

in the past decades due to its versatility. Many types of materials can be 

synthesized through miniemulsion polymerization and the application 

range is vast.  

Historically, the synthesis of aqueous polymer dispersions has 

focused on radical chain-growth polymerization of low-cost acrylate or 

styrene emulsions. In addition, step-growth polymerization to produce 

polyesters and polyurethanes were also performed in miniemulsion. 

Thiol-ene step-growth polymerization in miniemulsion is being 

currently investigated and only a handful of articles have been published 

in the literature. Thiol-ene polymerization is a click reaction that has 

been utilized for many applications from UV-curable coatings to 

biomedicine. In addition, thiol-ene polymerization has been remarkably 

utilized to produce polymers from fully renewable diene monomers that 

are usually derived from fatty acids and therefore provide potential 

degradability properties to the polymer. The prospective of obtaining 

high molecular weight polyesters in aqueous dispersed medium is, per 

se, a great advantage in performing thiol-ene polymerization in 

miniemulsion. In addition, henceforth many other types of interesting 

materials could be obtained, e.g. nanocomposites, nanocapsules, hybrid 

particles and so on.

CHAPTER V 
 

5 RENEWABLE RESOURCES DERIVED POLY (ESTER-

THIOETHER) NANOPARTICLES AND CAPSULES VIA 

THIOL-ENE POLYMERIZATION IN MINIEMULSION  

 
5.1 INTRODUCTION 

 

This chapter presents the experimental procedure and the results 

and discussion of the synthesis of a fully renewable diene diester 

monomer (derived from castor oil and isosorbide) and its 

copolymerization with butanedithiol via thiol-ene polymerization in 

miniemulsion to yield poly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles. Step-growth 

polymerization normally comprises water-sensitive precursors 

(polyurethane) or water byproduct (polyester) leading to equilibrium 

processes. Polyurethanes are produced based on water-sensitive 

precursors (isocyanates), their reaction with water generates polyurea, 

and in aqueous dispersed medium this leads to the formation of 

polyurea-urethane; urea moieties possess lower molecular weight than 

urethane moieties causing an overall decrease in the molecular weight. 

In addition, synthesis of polyester involves the formation of water as 

byproduct and thus synthesis of polyester in aqueous dispersed medium 

leads to low yield and low molecular weight due to chemical 

equilibrium. Although their implementation in aqueous dispersed 

medium has proven to be feasible, peculiar conditions are required to 

avoid poor yields and low molecular weights (BARRÈRE; 

LANDFESTER, 2003; VALÉRIO; ARAÚJO; SAYER, 2013; 

VALÉRIO et al., 2014).  

In this work, the synthesis of poly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles 

via thiol-ene step-growth polymerization in miniemulsion is presented. 

Thiol-ene polymerization in miniemulsion is a field still underexplored 

and poly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles have prospective applications as 

biodegradable biomaterial. 

 

5.2 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 

 

5.2.1 Materials 

 

10-Undecenoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%, CAS: 112-38-9), 

dianhydro-D-glucitol (Aldrich, 98%, CAS: 652-67-5), p-toluenesulfonic 



 

 

 

acid monohydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, 98.5%, CAS: 6192-52-5), sodium 

dodecyl sulfate (SDS, Vetec, CAS: 151-21-3), potassium persulphate 

(KPS, Vetec, 99%, CAS: 7727-21-1), azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN, 

Vetec, 98%, CAS: 78-67-1), Lutensol AT80 (Lut. AT80, BASF), which 

is a C16C18 fatty alcohol ethoxylate with 80 ethylene oxide units, 

Lutensol AT50 (Lut. AT50, BASF) poly(ethylene oxide) hexadecyl 

ether with 50 ethylene oxide units, hexadecane (HD, Vetec, 99%, CAS: 

544-76-3), and Crodamol GTCC (Crod.), a fully saturated triglyceride 

consisted mainly of esters of caprylic acid (C8) and capric acid (C10) 

extracted from coconut oil purchased from Alfa Aesar. All materials 

were used as received except for AIBN that was recrystallized. Distilled 

water was used in all experiments. 

 

5.2.2 Dianhydro-D-glucityl diundec-10-enoate (DGU) Synthesis 
 

60 g of 10-undecenoic acid (purity: 98%, 318.9 mmol), 16.08 g of 

1,4 dianhydro-D-glucitol  (purity: 98%, 107.8 mmol) and 3 g (15.7 

mmol) of p-toluensulfonic acid were placed in a round-bottomed flask 

with magnetic stirrer and a Dean-Stark apparatus. Then, 200 mL of 

toluene were added and the resulting reaction mixture was heated to 

reflux, up to 135°C. Water was collected as the reaction proceeded and 

once the reaction was completed, the reaction mixture was allowed to 

cool down. Figure 10 shows a scheme of the esterification reaction. 

Toluene was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was 

filtered through a short pad of basic aluminium oxide followed by a 

short pad of silica gel 60 using hexane as eluent. After removing the 

hexane, the crude product was dissolved in diethyl ether (200 mL), 

washed twice with 1N NaHCO3 solution (200 mL) and once with water 

(200 mL) from reverse osmosis. The organic fraction was dried with 

anhydrous MgSO4 and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. 

The resulting product was subjected to thin-layer chromatography over 

silica gel and eluted with mixtures of hexane/diethyl ether (7:1) and 

hexane/diethyl ether (8:2).

5.2.3 Bulk Polymerization 

 
DGU was placed in a conical vial and organic-soluble initiator 

was added, then the mixture was let under magnetic stirring until 

complete initiator solubilisation. After initiator solubilisation, BuSH2 
was added to the system (typically, 1:1 BuSH2-to-DGU molar ratio). 

The polymerization was carried out at determined temperature (60, 70, 

80 or 90 °C) for 4 to 8 h in a dry block heater. 

Table 4 shows a typical bulk polymerization formulation which 

contains 2.1 mmols of both DGU and Bu(SH)2, initiators at 1 mol% in 

relation to Bu(SH)2. Formulations were eventually modified to test 

different conditions but every modification or condition tested is 

specified in the discussion.

5.2.4 Miniemulsion Polymerization 

 
The aqueous phase was prepared using water and surfactant at 

determined concentration in relation to distilled water and, if used, 

water-soluble initiator (KPS); the mixture was let under magnetic 

stirring until complete surfactant (and initiator, if used) solubilisation. 

The organic phase was prepared using dianhydro-D-glucityl diundec-10-

enoate (DGU) and, if used, organic-soluble initiator (AIBN); the 

mixture was let under magnetic stirring until complete initiator 

solubilisation. The aqueous phase was added to the organic phase in a 

20 mL vial and an emulsion was formed under vigorous magnetic 

stirring (500 rpm) for 10 minutes. Then 1,4-butanedithiol (BuSH2) was 

added (typically, 1:1  BuSH2-to-DGU molar ratio) to the system with a 

micropipette and it was let under mild magnetic stirring (250 rpm) for 5 

minutes. The final emulsion underwent sonication for 2 minutes, at 

70 % of amplitude in a pulse regimen (10 s sonication, 5 s pause) using 

a Fisher Scientific Sonic Dismembrator model 500 and a 1/2? tip in ice 

bath. After miniemulsion preparation, the system was placed in a 

silicone oil bath at determined temperature (60, 70, 80 or 90 °C) and 

polymerization was carried out for 4 to 8 h. 

Figure 11 shows a scheme of miniemulsion preparation. Table 5 

displays standard formulations for miniemulsion polymerizations, 

typically 2.1 mmol of both DGU and Bu(SH)2, initiators at 1 mol% in 

relation to Bu(SH)2 and 8 mmol·cm

Crod. were used as co-stabilizers at 10 wt.% in relation to monomers 

combined weight. Water amount in miniemulsions containing co-

stabilizers was increased in order to maintain the same organic 

phase/aqueous phase weight ratio. Formulations were eventually 

modified to test different conditions but every modification or condition 

tested is specified in the discussion.

5.2.4.1 Thiol-ene polymerization kinetics in miniemulsion 

 

Thiol-ene polymerization in miniemulsion kinetics experiments 
were carried out in sealed ampoules in order to evaluate the dithiol

an ice bath to stop the reaction. Miniemulsion was prepared as described 

in the section 5.2.4. Kinetics experiments were performed using 3 g of 

DGU (6.3 mmol), 0.735 mL of Bu(SH)2 (6.3 mmol), 0.0368 g of SDS, 

15 g of distilled H2O, and either 10.3 mg of AIBN (63 µmol) or 17.0 mg 

of KPS (63 µmol).  

Dithiol monomer conversions were calculated from the ratio of 

polymer weight and initial monomer weight. The polymer weight of 

each sample was determined gravimetrically. 

 

5.2.5 Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (

H NMR) 

 
1
H NMR analyses were recorded in deuterated chloroform, 

CDCl3, using a Bruker Ascend 600 spectrometer at 600 MHz. Chemical 

shifts (?) are reported in part per million (ppm) relative to 

tetramethylsilane (TMS) intern standard used for calibrating chemical 

shift (TMS, ? = 0,00 ppm). Analyses were performed it the Laboratório 

de Ressonância Magnética Nuclear – LRMN, University of Brasília – 

UnB, Brazil. 

 

5.2.6 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)  

 
FTIR for liquid samples (DGU) was performed on an IR Prestige-

21 spectrophotometer from Shimadzu with Horizontal Attenuated Total 

Reflectance (HATR) accessory (ZnSe plate) from Pike, in the range of 

wavenumbers 4000–600 cm
-1

. A single drop of the liquid sample was 

placed on the ZnSe plate and analysed in order to investigate the 

functional group peaks and the presence of water. 

For solid polymer samples, Attenuated-total-reflectance Fourier-

transform-infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy was performed on a 

Bruker spectrometer, model TENSOR 27, in the range of wavenumbers 

4000–600 cm
-1

 by accumulating 32 scans at a resolution of 4 cm
-1

. Solid 

polymer samples ATR-FTIR analyses were performed in the 

Laboratório de Materiais (LABMAT) at the Mechanical Engineering 

Department of the Federal University of Santa Catarina. Samples were 

analysed as powder. 

 

5.2.7 Particle Size Measurements  

 

Particle size distribution was measured by dynamic light 

scattering (DLS) using a Zetasizer Nano S equipment from Malvern 

Instruments. A drop from either the miniemulsion or the latex was 

68

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterated_chloroform


 

 

 

placed in a glass cuvette and diluted in distilled water prior to the 

measurement. Analyses were performed in the Laboratório de Controle 

e Processos de Polimerização (LCP) at the Department of Chemical and 

Food Engineering of the Federal University of Santa Catarina. 

 

5.2.8 Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) 

 

The polymer was precipitated from the latex by adding the latter 

in cold methanol under vigorous stirring, then the mixture was filtered 

and 0.05 g of the polymer retained was diluted in 4 mL of 

tetrahydrofuran (THF). The obtained solution was filtered through a 

nylon syringe filter, pore: 0.45 µm, diameter: 33 mm. The molecular 

weight distributions were obtained through gel permeation 

chromatography using a high-performance liquid chromatography 

equipment (HPLC, model LC 20-A, Shimadzu) and Shim Pack GPC800 

Series columns (GPC 801, GPC 804 e GPC 807), also from Shimadzu. 

THF was used as eluent with volumetric flow rate of 1 mL?min
-1

using a DSC 4000 Perkin Elmer, under inert atmosphere (20 mL?min

from - 60 to 150 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The thermal history 

was removed prior to the analyses at a heating rate of 20 °C/min and 

cooling rate of -20 °C/min. The melting temperatures were thus obtained 

from the second heating run. Analyses were performed in the 

Laboratório de Propriedades Físicas de Alimentos (PROFI) at the

The crystallinity of the synthesized thioether-ester polymers was 

analysed through X-ray diffraction. The degree of crystallinity was 

estimated using Eq. 9 (CHALMERS; MEIER, 2008):

where IC is the sum of the area of all crystalline reflections, IA is 

the area of the amorphous halo, and K is a proportionality constant to 

account for the relative scattering of the amorphous and crystalline 

phases which is close to 1 in many cases (CHALMERS; MEIER, 2008). 

Analyses were performed in the Laboratório de Difração de Raios

Particle morphology characterisation was performed by 

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) using a JEM-1011 TEM (100 

kV).The as-synthesized latex was diluted, in distilled water, down to 

0.01% of solids content. One single drop of the diluted latex (0.5% of 

solid content) was placed on an either carbon-coated or parlodium-

coated copper grid and it was dried under room conditions overnight. 

Analyses were performed in the Laboratório Central de Microscopia 

Eletrônica (LCME), Federal University of Santa Catarina. 

 

5.3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

 

5.3.1 Synthesis and characterisation of a fully renewable monomer 

derived from castor oil and isosorbide 

 

A fully renewable diene diester monomer, Dianhydro-D-glucityl 

diundec-10-enoate (DGU), was produced through esterification in 

organic solvent (toluene) of 10-undecenoic acid (derived from castor 

oil) and isosorbide (derived from starch). Fokou and Meier (2009) 

reported the synthesis of this same diene monomer structure through a 

different, more complex, synthetic route. Fokou and Meier utilized DGU 

for metathesis polymerization and obtained number average molecular 

weight up to 8400 with experiments carried out at 80°C for 5 h using 

second generation Grubbs metathesis catalyst; herein, the diene 

monomer is used for thiol-ene polymerization in miniemulsion.

DGU was copolymerized with Bu(SH)2 both in bulk and in 

miniemulsion. All miniemulsion and latex samples presented fair 

stability. DGU-to-Bu(SH)2  ratio was kept 1:1 for most polymerization 

experiments. In addition, miniemulsions were prepared to obtain lattices 

with high solid content of 20 to 25%. 

 

5.3.2 Development of poly (thioether-ester) via thiol-ene 

miniemulsion polymerization 
 

Poly (thioether-ester) nanoparticles were prepared via 

miniemulsion polymerization using a diene monomer (DGU) derived 

from renewable resources. Table 6 shows the intensity average droplet 

size and dispersion of DLS, and ultimately particle size and dispersion 

of DLS, from three miniemulsion polymerization experiments carried 

out at 80°C for 4h using 1 mol% of AIBN as initiator, i.e. identical 

reactions except for the type of surfactant utilized. All surfactants were 

tested in the same concentration, 8 mmol·cm
-3
.

Figure 14 displays the particle size distribution (PSD) for 

miniemulsions from Table 6. It shows a very small population of 

macrodroplets, which is attributed to issues in sonication step during the 

miniemulsion preparation. It is important to consider that part of the 1,4-

butanedithiol generates thiyl species during the sonication, once a 

radical is formed it triggers the polymerization before the 

miniemulsification step is concluded. Premature polymerization may 

ultimately affect sonication efficiency due to the viscosity increase. In 

addition, DGU is a very hydrophobic compound and therefore no co-

stabilizer was necessary in order to avoid diffusional degradation.

al. (2015) have included inhibitor in the miniemulsion formulation to 

avoid polymerization during sonication step. This attempt was not 

adopted in this work in order to achieve a fair comparison between 

different types of initiator (AIBN and KPS). However, gravimetric 

analyses revealed a Bu(SH)2 conversion of at least 35 % and 10 % after 

sonication when, respectively, AIBN and KPS were utilized; plus an 

initiatorless attempt evidenced a 10% conversion owe to polymerization 

during sonication. 

Samples using non-ionic surfactants M1 and M2 showed 

considerable difference between droplet and particle sizes. For sample 

M3 with the anionic surfactant SDS the difference between droplet and 

particle size as well as dispersion before and after polymerization is less 

than 10% and therefore can be neglected. Lut. AT50 yielded higher 

droplet and particles sizes than Lut AT80. SDS provided the lowest 

particle size and the narrowest PSD. There are two explanations for the 

observed results. Firstly, Lut. AT80 possesses a higher molecular weight 

and a higher surface coverage per mole unit – as it normally happens for 

non-ionic surfactants when their chain/molecular weight is increased – 

than Lut AT50 (HOLMBERG et al., 2002). Thus a higher quantity of 
Lut. AT 50 – which possesses molecular weight 1.5 times lower (see 

Table 7) – is needed for a similar system to be obtained in order to 

balance number of moles of surfactant and surface coverage. Secondly, 

even though SDS provides lower surface coverage, differently from 

non-ionic surfactants, it provides electrostatic stabilisation to the 

droplets/nanoparticles, a powerful mechanism to avoid loss of colloidal 

stability.

 the final lattices presented particle 

diameter of 175 ± 1 and 138.5 ± 0.4 for miniemulsions containing, 

respectively, Lut. AT50 and SDS; plus low PDI (&lt;0.2) was obtained. 

Note that doubling up Lut AT50 molar concentration its weight 

percentage becomes higher than the weight percentage in which Lut 

AT80 was added to the miniemulsions. 

Figures 15 and 16 exhibit some TEM images of the synthesized 

lattices. Figures 15a and 15b show poly (thioether-ester) nanoparticles 

stabilised with Lut. AT80 and Lut. AT50 respectively – some particles 

in Figure 14b are indicated by black arrows. Figure16a shows 

poly DGU-Bu(SH)2 nanoparticles stabilised with SDS. It is important to 

mention that, herein, it is presented the first TEM images of thiol-ene 

linear polymers sub-micrometric particles, specifically poly (ester-

thioether). 

 

 

The morphology of non-cross-linked polymer particles with low 

glass transition temperature and low melting point (&lt;100°C) are not 

very often successfully analysed by TEM, except in cases when cryo-

TEM is available. Nonetheless, the morphology of poly (DGU-Bu(SH)2) 

particles was effectively visualized when TEM equipment was operated 

at the lowest current possible, which in its turn provides low image 
resolution. Polymeric particles melted during the microscopy session 

when the current was increased in order to obtain better images; Figure 

16 compares the same particles before (a) and after melting (b).

Poly(thioether-ester) particles produced by thiol-ene 

copolymerization of DGU with Bu(SH2) in miniemulsion presented 

spherical morphology. Furthermore, TEM analyses corroborate DLS 

results, that even though there is a majority of small particles, a 

population of macroparticles is also existent and draws more attention in 

TEM images due to their bigger size and easier visualization.  

Polymerization reactions were carried out under different 

conditions, such as reaction time, temperature, and amount of initiator, 

to evaluate the effect on molecular weight distribution. Thiol-ene 

polymerization is an unique reaction that combines both step-growth 

and free-radical mechanisms (HOYLE; LEE; ROPER, 2004; HOYLE; 

BOWMAN, 2010), therefore it was expected to obtain higher average 

molecular weights for higher functional groups conversion, which 

increases with the time of the reaction. Table 8 shows the average 

molecular weight and the molecular weight dispersion (MW/MN) for 4, 6 

and 8 h of polymer samples synthesized via bulk polymerization (B 

samples) at 70°C and using 1 mol% of AIBN in relation to Bu(SH)2.

Bulk polymerization results (B1) from Table 8 suggest that 

molecular weight does not change from 4 to 8 hours, which might 

indicate that functional group conversion may have already reached a 

maximum value. Ideally, functional group conversion should increase 

with time and by consequence the degree of polymerization; however, 

many are the issues such as the increase in viscosity that causes low 

mobility of growing polymer chains that affect directly functional group 

conversion and restrict the degree of polymerization.  

A set of polymerization experiments were carried out at different 

temperatures (see Table 9), ranging from 60 to 90°C, for 4 h. Both bulk 

and miniemulsion polymerizations used 1 mol% of AIBN in relation to 

Bu(SH)2. Figure 17 and Figure 18 display miniemulsion 

polymerizations and bulk polymerizations obtained molecular weight 

distribution in terms of the normalized signal vs. retention time from 

GPC. In Figure 17, correspondent to miniemulsion polymerization, 

molecular weight distribution curves are closer than in Figure 18, 

correspondent to bulk polymerization, and therefore apparently 

molecular weight distribution is less sensitive to temperature in 

miniemulsion than in bulk polymerization.

Table 9 shows that comparing the molecular weight of polymer 

samples synthesized at the same conditions except for the 

polymerization technique, either miniemulsion or bulk; samples 

synthesized via thiol-ene polymerization in miniemulsion resulted in 

higher molecular weight than in bulk polymerization for all the 

temperatures tested, except for 60°C. This indicates that at some extent 

there is an effect of radical compartmentalization, which in its turn 

occurs when a single radical is confined to the droplet and thus 

bimolecular termination (Figure 6) is supressed (LANDFESTER, 2003). 

At 60°C, the initiator half-life is about 20h (Eq. 11) and, therefore, 

polymerization reaction occurs virtually with no initiator decomposition; 

thus there is no difference in molecular weight of the samples from both 

bulk and miniemulsion polymerizations.

Results in Table 9 and Figures 17 and 18 show that, in general, 

increasing the temperature of the polymerization there is an increase in 

molecular weight. Nevertheless, at 90 °C a decrease in MN was 

observed. Firstly, rate constants – from initiator decomposition (kd), 

propagation (kp), chain-transfer (kct), and termination (kt) – are 

temperature-dependent. Constant rates dependence from different 

polymerization steps behave differently towards temperature. It could 

mean that, for example, at 90 °C kt becomes much higher than kct. In 

addition, thiol-ene polymerization is a step-growth polymerization that 

proceeds as free radical reactions and therefore it needs to undergo 

initiation (Figure 5). In step-growth polymerizations, molecular weight 

depends on functional group conversion, which in its turn depends on 

temperature. As thiol-ene polymerization combines both step-growth 

and free radical mechanisms; it is reasonable to consider that with the 

increase in temperature the initiator decomposes at a faster rate and thus 

functional groups are allowed to react faster and the degree of 

polymerization is enhanced because more thiyl radicals are being 

generated. 

Thus, based on the displayed results, 80°C is the temperature 

condition that provided the highest molecular weight results for both 

miniemulsion and bulk polymerization.  

79



 

 

 

Reaction conditions were fixed at 4 h and 80°C also because of 

the half-life of AIBN in order to test the effects of other parameters. In 

free-radical polymerization, various initiators are used depending on 

their rates of decomposition. The decomposition of initiators can be 

conveniently expressed in terms of the initiator half-life (t1/2), which is 

defined as the time for the concentration of initiator to decrease to one 

half of its original value (ODIAN, 2009). The decomposition constant of 

AIBN in toluene is given by the Eq. (10) (BRANDRUP et al., 1999): 
 

  ( 
  )               (

       

         ( )
)   (10) 

 

and its half-life is given by: 

 

  
 

( )  
   
 

 

   
      (11) 

 

Therefore, at 80 °C and considering toluene as solvent, 

    (AIBN) is 1.4 h, this way a reaction time of 4 h means that roughly 

7/8 of the AIBN would have been decomposed. 

Table 10 shows the effect of different particle sizes on the 

average molecular weight of thiol-ene polymerization in miniemulsion 

at 80 °C using 1 mol% of AIBN (in relation to Bu(SH)2) as initiator. As 
it is shown in Table 10, number-average molecular weight seems to 

reach a peak value as average particle size approaches 190 nm when 

thiol:ene ratio is 1:1 (M3). Non-stoichiometric experiments (M11, M12) 

were performed in order to observe the effect in molecular weight and if 

the molecular weight would respond to the change in the particle size 

similarly to its behaviour in stoichiometric reactions (M1, M3, M10).

When thiol-to-ene ratio was increased to 1.2:1, M11 and M12, 

molecular weight dropped considerably in comparison to the 

stoichiometric polymerization, M3 and M10. 

Comparison between bulk and miniemulsion polymerization 

results indicates radical compartmentalization effect occurs in thiol-ene 

polymerization in miniemulsion; however not as prominent as it 

happens in traditional free-radical polymerization in miniemulsion. 

Radical compartmentalization occurs when a single radical is confined 

to the droplet and thus bimolecular termination is supressed. On the 

other hand, a significant increase in the droplet size might make 

bimolecular termination more likely to occur due to the higher content 

of radicals inside the droplet. In traditional miniemulsion systems 

radical compartmentalization leads to faster polymerization rates and 

higher molecular weights (LANDFESTER, 2003 COSTA et al., 2013). 
On the other hand, thiol-ene polymerization in miniemulsion not only 

depends on average number of radicals per particle but mainly of the 

stoichiometry. Therefore, there is a radical compartmentalization effect 

as long as the stoichiometry in the polymerization locus is not 

compromised. 

Miniemulsion polymerization is a heterophase technique, which 

means that the components are partitioned between organic and aqueous 

phases, especially those compounds that possess a significant solubility 

in the both phases, which is the case of the 1,4-butanedithiol. This 

partition between the two phases may change local stoichiometry inside 

the droplet, the polymerization locus, which may be accounted for the 

observed results because thiol-ene polymerization is intrinsically reliant 

on the stoichiometry (CRAMER et al., 2003). 
The observed effect can be explained by the great difference in 

interfacial area inflicted by the change in droplet/particle diameter. Thiyl 

radicals are mostly produced inside the droplet because AIBN is an 

organo-soluble initiator. However, Bu(SH)2 has a significant solubility 

in water (1.32 mg·mL
-1

), close to the solubility of MMA in water, and 

therefore Bu(SH)2, and consequently thiyl radicals, are able to leave the 

droplet to the water phase. An increase in interfacial area means that 

more radicals are capable of leaving the droplet to the water phase and 

consequently the composition inside the droplet is changed. Thiol-ene 

step-growth polymerization is strictly dependent on the functional group 

ratio, non-stoichiometric reactions are known to significantly reduce 

functional group conversion in thiol-ene photopolymerization 

(CRAMER; BOWMAN, 2001; CRAMER et al., 2003) and therefore the 

81



 

 

 

molecular weight is also reduced as observed when comparing reactions 

M3 to M11 and M10 to M12. 

The influence of the type and the amount of initiator were 

evaluated. Table 11 displays number average and weight average 

molecular weight results of miniemulsion and bulk polymerizations 

where AIBN (organo-soluble) and KPS (water-soluble) were used as 

initiators in different concentrations (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 mol%). Miniemulsion 

and bulk experiments underwent polymerization for 4 h at 80°C.

It can be seen in Table 11 that increasing the concentration of 

AIBN from 0.5 to 1% MN increases for both miniemulsion (M13 and 

M1 respectively) and bulk (B5 and B6 respectively) polymerizations, 

however when AIBN concentration is further increased molecular 

weight starts to fall off. As for KPS, it was observed a decline in 

molecular weight with the increase in initiator concentration just as 

happens in traditional free radical polymerization (ODIAN, 2009). 

Figures 19, 20 and 21 show the molecular weight distributions of the 
samples from Table 11. Figure 19 corresponds to miniemulsion 

polymerizations containing 0.5; 1; 1.5 and 2% of AIBN; Figure 20 

corresponds to bulk polymerizations containing 0.5; 1; 1.5; and 2% of 

AIBN; and Figure 21 corresponds to miniemulsion polymerizations 

containing 0.5; 1; 1.5; and 2% of KPS.

relation to dithiol. 

 
 

The influence of initiator concentration in molecular weight is 

very little explored in thiol-ene polymerization, probably because, in 

most cases, a polymeric network is obtained and in this case, molecular 

weight cannot be measured. Even initiator concentration effects on 

kinetics are not well explored; most of the works (CRAMER et al., 

2003; NORTHROP; COFFEY, 2012) focus on thiols and enes with 

different functionalities and thiol–to-ene ratios. However, a 

paper (COLE; JANKOUSKY; BOWMAN, 2013) evaluates the 

influence of initiator concentration in the kinetics of redox initiated 

thiol-ene bulk polymerization, but only functional groups conversion 

was evalueated.

retention time of bulk polymerization experiments (80°C, 4 h) containing AIBN 

at 0.5 (B5), 1 (B6), 1.5 (B7) and 2 mol% (B8) in relation to dithiol. 

 
 

Figures 19, 20 and 21 show the difference in the molecular 

weight distribution according to the amount and type of the initiator. In 

traditional free radical polymerization, molecular weight is directly 

dependent of the amount of initiator, the higher the concentration the 

lower the molecular weight; and this behaviour is observed independent 

on the type of the initiator, water or organo-soluble. However, in thiol-

ene polymerization a different behaviour is observed. AIBN provided 

the best molecular weight result at the concentration of 1 mol%, 

concentrations of 0.5, 1.5 and 2 mol% resulted in lower molecular 

weight for both miniemulsion and bulk polymerization. In its turn, KPS 

behaved exactly the way is considered common in free radical 

polymerizations, the lower the concentration the higher the molecular 

weight. The precise explanation for the observed results might be 

obtained through further kinetic experiments.

5.3.3 Thermal properties and crystallinity 

 

Polymeric samples were submitted to thermal analysis through 

differential scanning calorimetry and results are displayed in Figure 22. 

The melting temperature of polymers resultant from either miniemulsion 

or bulk polymerization are presented in Table 12. The synthesized 

poly(thioether-ester)s presented a double-melting behaviour observed in 

semicrystalline polymers (HIRAKAWA; HIRAMATSU, 1980; YU et 

al., 1983; YASUNIWA et al., 2004). The lower temperature peak is due 

to the partial melting and recrystallization of the imperfect crystallite, 

whilst the higher temperature peak corresponds to the melting of the 

better-organised crystallite (YU et al., 1983). It was observed a slight 
variation in the temperature of melt according to molecular weight of 

miniemulsion samples, i.e. samples with lower molecular weight had 

their melting peak shifted to the left and therefore indicating a melting 

temperature a few degrees lower (see Figure 22).

It was not possible to observe the glass transition temperature 

(TG) through DSC, even though some samples were cooled down to -

70°C; and this is due to their crystallinity. It may be possible, however, 

to determine the TG through relaxation methods such as dynamic 

mechanical and dielectric spectroscopies as reported (FOCARETE et 

al., 2001) by other authors who worked with highly crystalline 
polymers. The crystallinity observed in these poly(thioether-ester)s is an 

effect of intra- and intermolecular interactions between functional 

groups, and a highly linear structure. It is important to notice that it was 

not possible to determine the degree of crystallinity through DSC due to 

the lack of data about the polymer such as the enthalpy of a fully 

crystalline reference or an exothermic recrystallization event. The 

method used by calculating the degree of crystallinity through Eq. 9 

based on the peaks from XRD gives a fair approach, even though it is 

86



 

 

 

difficult to draw an amorphous halo unambiguously. Poly (DGU-

Bu(SH)2) samples presented crystallinity degrees between 20 and 50%.

Jasinski et al. (2014a) also reported the synthesis of 

poly(thioether-ester) with a high degree of crystallinity (55%) through 

thiol-ene polymerization in miniemulsion. They observed the 

semicrystalline behaviour revealed by an exothermic recrystallization 

peak at 6°C and an endothermic melting peak at 18°C. 

Polymers comprising a high degree of crystallinity are interesting 

because it plays a large role on the thermal, mechanical, and other 

important properties of polymers. The extent of crystallinity developed 

in a polymer sample is a consequence of both thermodynamic and 

kinetic factors (ODIAN, 2009). 

 

5.3.4 The effect of co-stabilizers and their possible use as liquid core 

 

Crodamol GTCC and hexadecane were tested as co-stabilizers. 

They were added in a concentration of 10% (w.% in relation to the 

monomers) to miniemulsion whose formulations contained 12 

mmol·cm
-3

 of Lutensol AT50. Figure 25 shows the particle size 

distribution for the latex containing 10% of either HD or Crodamol. The 

addition of either co-stabilizers yielded lower average particle size and 

narrower size distribution in comparison to M2 (Table 6) by preventing 

the Ostwald ripening. However, PSD results from previous 

miniemulsion experiments also indicates that depending on surfactant 

type and concentration there is no need for co-stabilizers because DGU 

is sufficiently hydrophobic to provide some diffusional stability. 

Co-stabilizer concentrations were further increased to 50% in an 

attempt to produce nanocapsules. The amount of water was increased in 

order to maintain the weight ratio between organic and aqueous phases. 

Samples containing 50% of co-stabilizer, M19 and M20, presented an 

increase of roughly 15 nm in the average particle size though size 

distribution dispersion was preserved. Table 13 summarizes the results 

obtained in the co-stabilizer evaluation.

water/organic phase w./w. ratio). Lut. AT50 was used at 11 mmol·cm

 (M5,

and the co-stabilizer. Therefore, it can not be stated that morphology of 

these samples are core-shell or any other type of morphology for that 

matter. The morphology of the samples containing 50% of co-stabilizer 

must be further investigated through different analytical techniques such 

as DSC. 

Figure 25 displays the PSD for the nanoparticles synthesized 

using different type and concentration of co-stabilizers. M5 and M6 

present only a slight difference regarding the distribution and both 

contain a small population of macro-particles, the same behaviour is 

observed for M19 and M20.

Differential scanning calorimetry (Figure 26) and transmission 

electron microscopy (Figure 24) were used also to investigate whether 

sub-micrometric capsules were formed or not.  

Differential scanning calorimetry thermal analysis have shown 

(Figure 26a) a clear phase separation between the hexadecane and the 

polymeric phase; i.e. separated melting peaks for the hexadecane at 

18°C (further confirmed independently through DSC) and for the 

polymer at 66°C. However, morphology is not quite clear since no phase 

segregation can be observed in Figure 24b. Morphology could be, for 

example, nanocapsules with hexadecane as liquid core and polymer as 

shell or hexadecane could be divided in several small liquid cores 

dispersed in the polymeric matrix.

Melting temperature of Crodamol is around - 3 °C (measured 

through DSC, Figure 26). However, it has been verified through DSC 

(Figure 26b) that there is not any peak for the melting of Crodamol for 

miniemulsion polymerization when using Crodamol as co-stabilizer 

(M20, Table 13) at the same concentration (50 w.%) as hexadecane. The 

apparent melting temperature of the sample containing Crodamol 

(Figure 26b (M20)) has decreased from 66 to 63 °C. In addition, the 

partition of the double Tm peaks is not as clear as in the pure polymeric 

sample. Furthermore, the enthalpy of melting (?Hm) of the polymer 

sample synthesized with Crod. as co-stabilizer is 23 J·g
-1

; whilst a 

polymer synthesized similarly but without co-stabilizer has ?Hm = 42 

J·g
-1

. This means that the addition of 50 w.% of Crodamol (in relation to 
the monomers) to the formulation reduced crystalline domains by half 

approximately. Therefore, DSC results indicate that phase separation did 

not occur and Crodamol is most likely solubilized in the polymeric 

matrix. due to the formation of the homogeneous mixture polymer-

Crodamol. Some other analytical techniques can be useful to further 

91



 

 

 

investigate the internal structure of nanoparticles such as TEM of 

microtomed samples and solid state NMR (STUBBS; SUNDBERG, 

2005). In addition, tension interface measurements between 

polymer/water phase, polymer/HD, polymer/Crod., HD/water phase, 

and Crod./water phase would help to figure out how phases behave in 

the nanostructure. 

 

5.3.5 Thiol-ene polymerization kinetics in miniemulsion 
 

Thiol-ene polymerization kinetics in miniemulsion of DGU and 

Bu(SH)2 was investigated using either AIBN or KPS as initiators. Both 

initiators were tested in the same concentrations of 1 mol% in relation to 

the dithiol monomer in experiments carried out at 80°C. Gravimetric 

conversions of Bu(SH)2 higher than 85% were obtained within 15 

minutes of reaction. Moreover, dried latex samples were submitted to 

FTIR analyses with the intention of quantifying the double bonds of the 

residual diene monomer. However, samples taken after 15 minutes of 

reaction did not display any measurable double bond peak in FTIR 

spectra. 

FTIR spectra of dried latexes taken at 0 min. and 20 min. of 

polymerization are presented in Figure 27 for the polymerization using 

AIBN and in Figure 28 for polymerization using KPS. Both experiments 

were carried out at 80°C with 1 mol% of either AIBN or KPS and 

thiol:ene 1:1.

thiol:ene 1:1. The comparison evidenced rapid consumption of double bonds 

(1640 cm
-1

) and the formation of sulphide bonds (720 cm
-1

). 

 
 

It can be noticed in Figure 27 that peaks at 3076 cm
-1

 and 910 cm
-

, that correspond respectively to =C—H stretch in the unsaturated 

hydrocarbon chain and CH2 out-of-plane wag from CH=CH2 in vinyl 

compounds, no longer are discernible in Figure 27 when compared to 

Figure 13. A very small peak at 1640 cm
-1

 (C=C stretch) can be seen in 

Figure 27 in the curve correspondent to the sample taken at the 

beginning of the polymerization (0 min.), however for the sample taken 

at 20 min. no peak can be seen at 1640 cm
-1

. Samples were not washed 

prior to the FTIR analyses, which means that the peaks correspondent to 

double bonds are most likely due to the presence of residual DGU. 

Furthermore, it can be noticed the presence of sulphide bonds (S—C) at 

720 cm
-1

 in the sample resultant from the addition of the thiyl radicals 

across the double bond. 

A similar behaviour can be observed in Figure 28 correspondent 

to the thiol-ene polymerization in miniemulsion with KPS. However, 

KPS provided a slower kinetics and therefore at the beginning of the 

polymerization (0 min.) a strong peak at 910 cm
-1

 (indicated in Figure 28 

by a black arrow) can still be noticed, and corresponding to =C—H 

93



 

 

 

stretch in the unsaturated hydrocarbon chain of DGU. A peak at 

1640 cm
-1

 (C=C stretch) can be also seen in Figure 28 in the curve 

correspondent to the sample taken at the beginning of the 

polymerization (0 min.). However, for the sample taken at 20 min. no 

peak can be seen at 1640 cm
-1

 and the strong peak at 910 cm
-1

 cannot be 

seen. In addition, it can be noticed (20 min.) the presence of sulphide 

bonds (S—C) at 720 cm
-1

 in the sample resultant from the addition of 

the thiyl radicals across the double bond.

(1640 cm

Figure 29 shows the normalized number and weight average 

molecular weights progress with the polymerization time in thiol-ene 

miniemulsion polymerization at 80°C using 1 mol% of AIBN (in 

relation to dithiol) and 8 mmol cm
-3

 of SDS. The increase of molecular 

weight with reaction time is a characteristic of step-growth 
polymerizations. It is important to notice that even though FTIR (Figure 

27) does not indicate any measurable peak of double bonds after 20 

minutes, molecular weight still increases until 200 minutes of reaction. 

This is probably because there are sufficient double bonds associated to 

94



 

 

 

oligomers to keep polymer growth but not many DGU single molecules, 

if any; and thus double bond signal is insignificant toward other 

functional groups present in the macromolecule.

molecular weights progress with the polymerization time in thiol-ene 

miniemulsion polymerization at 80°C using 1 mol% of KPS (in relation 

to dithiol) and 8 mmol cm

 of SDS. Kinetics using KPS shows a 

behaviour similar to the molecular weight kinetics using AIBN as 

initiator displayed in Figure 28. Even though FTIR (Figure 28) does not 

indicate any measurable peak of double bonds after 20 minutes, 

molecular weight still increases until 200 minutes of reaction. Probably 

FTIR technique is not sensitive enough to pick up residual double bond 

peaks in macromolecules such as oligomers and polymers. 

It is not clear the reason why KPS provides a much lower, half 

approximately, molecular weight than AIBN. KPS, being a water-

soluble ionic compound, only forms radicals in aqueous phase and this 

might be favourable to thiyl-thiyl termination (Figure 6) to form 

disulphide in the water even before thiyl radicals could enter the 

droplets. On the other hand, AIBN, being an organo-soluble initiator, 

favours droplet nucleation (LANDFESTER, 2003).  
 

5.4 FINAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 

Herein, thiol-ene polymerization was utilized to synthesize 

poly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles through miniemulsion 

polymerization using a fully renewable monomer (DGU) indirectly 

derived from vegetable oil and sugar. Different parameters were tested: 

reaction temperature, reaction time, initiator concentration, and 

surfactant type and concentration, and the addition of co-stabilizer. 

Lattices did not present great difference regarding stability or particle 

diameter when co-stabilizer were added to the formulation, noticeable 

increase in particle size was observed only when co-stabilizers were 

used at high weight percentage (50%). In general, by increasing the 

temperature higher molecular weight was obtained probably due to 

functional group conversion since thiol-ene follows step-growth 

mechanism. In addition, AIBN (organo-soluble initiator) was found to 

present an ideal concentration among the tested concentrations to 

improve molecular weight, while when KPS (water soluble initiator) is 

used a decrease in initiator concentration enhances molecular weight. 

Moreover, AIBN provided polymeric samples with higher molecular 

weight than KPS. .Particle morphology was observed by TEM. Particle 

size was   200 nm and particle size dispersion ? 0.2. The best results 
regarding molecular weight (MN up to 11 kDa) were obtained through 

miniemulsion polymerization at 80°C using AIBN at 1% (mol% in 

96



 

 

 

relation to dithiol) Furthermore, DSC and XRD analyses showed that 

the synthesized polymer is semi-crystalline with a degree of crystallinity 

of at least 20% and temperature of melting around 60°C. Finally, 

nanoparticles with a co-stabilizer liquid phase, possibly liquid core, 

were obtained and phase separation was observed through DSC. In 

future works the kinetics of thiol-ene polymerization in miniemulsion 

should be investigated to evaluate phenomena such as radical 

compartmentalization and the development of molecular weight with 

reaction time. Also thiol-ene miniemulsion polymerization of DGU 

could be used to synthesize nanocapsules of active compounds. Lastly, 

nanoparticles derived from renewable resources synthesized herein 

possess hydrolysable bonds in the main polymeric chain and therefore 

the (bio) degradation of the poly(DGU-Bu(SH)2) could be investigated.

CHAPTER VI 
 

6 FINAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 

6.1 CONCLUSION 

 

In this work, it was reported the synthesis of a renewable ?,?-

diene diester monomer, dianhydro-D-glucityl diundec-10-enoate 

(DGU), produced from 10-undecenoic acid (derived from castor oil) and 

isosorbide (derived from starch). DGU was copolymerized with 1,4-

butanedithiol (Bu(SH)2) through thiol-ene polymerization both in bulk 

and miniemulsion to yield linear semi-crystalline poly(thioether-ester)s. 

Different parameters were evaluated such as reaction temperature, 

initiator concentration, and surfactant type and concentration. 

The synthesis of novel monomers from bio-feedstock was 

evidenced to be a powerful tool to produce differentiated polymers with 

prospective for diverse applications. Brazil, as one of the world‘s 

biggest producers of vegetable oil, possesses a great potential to develop 

sustainable chemistry based products using vegetable oils as raw 

materials. 

DGU was successfully copolymerized with Bu(SH)2 via thiol-ene 

polymerization both in bulk and in miniemulsion. Polymer obtained by 

miniemulsion polymerization resulted in a higher molecular weight 

when compared to bulk polymerization. Thus, there is evidence of the 

occurrence of radical compartmentalization. Poly(thioether-ester) 

nanoparticles were obtained through miniemulsion polymerization and 

morphology was evaluated by TEM. Microscopy analyses have shown 

spherical nanoparticles. DLS has shown that according to surfactant type 

and concentration particles from 130 up to 250 nm can be obtained. 

However, components are partitioned between organic and aqueous 

phases, especially those compounds that possess a significant solubility 

in the both phases, which is the case of the 1,4-butanedithiol. This 

partition between the two phases may change local stoichiometry inside 

the droplet. As thiol-ene polymerization is strictly dependent of 

stoichiometry, this might have been the reason for the decrease in 

molecular weights values when particle size was reduced. Non-

stoichiometric attempts containing a 20% excess of dithiol further 

confirmed that thiol-ene polymerization is reliant on stoichiometry. 

In general, increasing the temperature of the polymerization there 

is an increase in molecular weight. thiol-ene polymerization is a step-

growth polymerization that proceeds as free radical reactions and 



 

 

 

therefore it needs undergo initiation. In step-growth polymerizations, 

molecular weight depends on functional group conversion, with the 

increase in temperature the initiator decomposes at a faster rate and thus 

functional groups are allowed to react faster and the degree of 

polymerization is enhanced because more thiyl radicals are being 

generated. 80°C was the temperature condition that provided the best 

molecular weight results for both miniemulsion and bulk 

polymerization. 

In traditional free radical polymerization, molecular weight is 

directly dependent of the amount of initiator, the higher the 

concentration the lower the molecular weight; and this behaviour is 

observed independent on the type of the initiator, water or organo-

soluble. However, in thiol-ene polymerization a different behaviour for 

AIBN was observed, among the concentrations tested, the intermediary 

concentration of 1 mol% presented the best molecular weight result. On 

the other hand, KPS provided its highest molecular result with the 

lowest concentration of 0.5 mol%. Furthermore, DSC and XRD analyses 

have shown that the synthesized polymer was semi-crystalline with a 

degree of crystallinity of at least 20% and Tm around 60°C. In addition, 

depending on the co-stabilizer type, hexadecane of Crodamol, and 

amount, phase segregation inside the polymer particles was observed 

through DSC. Finally, thiol-ene polymerization kinetics in miniemulsion 

has shown that even though FTIR does not indicate any measurable 

peak of double bonds after 20 minutes, molecular weight still increases 

until 200 minutes of reaction. It is not clear the reason why KPS 

provides a much lower, half approximately, molecular weight than 

AIBN. KPS, being a water-soluble ionic compound, only forms radicals 

in aqueous phase and this might be favourable to thiyl-thiyl termination 

to form disulphide in the water even before thiyl radicals could enter the 

droplets. On the other hand, AIBN, being an organo-soluble initiator, 

favours droplet nucleation. 

 

6.2 FURTHER WORK 

 

1. To synthesize other types of diene monomers. 
2. To evaluate other types of thiols comprising different 

functional groups to perform thiol-ene polymerization in 

miniemulsion. 

3. To test DGU as crosslinking agent for MMA and styrene 
4. To investigate the actual morphology of nanoparticles 

containing high amount of hexadecane and Crodamol
®
. Some 

100



 

 

 

other microscopy techniques, such as SEM and AFM, can be 

utilized to gain additional information to supplement TEM 

and DSC results. 

5. To synthesize nanoparticles via thiol-ene polymerization in 
miniemulsion with different ene or thiol surface functional 

groups. 

6. Further investigation of kinetics by evaluating functional 
group conversion through NMR. To investigate why AIBN 

and KPS, different types of initiator, behave differently in 

thiol-ene polymerization. 

7. To test the biocompatibility of the synthesized nanoparticles 
by evaluating in vitro cytotoxicity in fibroblast cells and 

hemocompatibility of poly(thioether-ester) nanoparticles. 

8. Many works in the literature state that thiol-ene 
polymerization is not inhibited by oxygen. However, it 

should be further investigated until what extent this statement 

is valid. 

9. To evaluate poly(DGU-Bu(SH)2) degradation. Since it is a 
polymer with ester groups in the main chain, it is susceptible 

to hydrolysis. 

10. Improvement of the evaluation of crystallinity since it might 
affect the susceptibility to hydrolysis, i.e. affects polymer 

degradation. To obtain a fully crystalline polymer sample to 

use as reference in DSC analyses.
