Abstract  

 

In a previous work a strategy with citrate buffer used to deconstruct the paper matrix of 

commercial printing and writing paper with the objective to isolate its mineral loading resulted 

in the discovery of lamellar particles, interesting from a papermaking point of view. This led to 

a complementary study, where industrial scalenohedral PCC (Precipitated Calcium Carbonate) 

particles contacted with the citrate buffer, confirming that in fact the origin of the lamellar 

structures is related to it. 

This dissertation aims to study and optimize the conditions of the reaction between the 

citrate buffer and the mineral particles. To understand which variables influence this PCC 

modification and later apply these particles as coating pigment and paper filler to evaluate the 

resultant properties, are also objectives of the work. 

A preliminary research was made where the influence of the pH buffer and CIT (Citric 

Acid)/PCC ratio was studied, at 50ºC. From this experimental investigation resulted two new 

protocols to have a better control of CIT/PCC ratio. Also, an experiment using GCC as starting 

material was made. From this approach, it was concluded that the lamellar particles are 

favourable to form in a suspension with pH 5.5. The CIT/PCC can be controlled by the different 

protocols, where a solution of CIT (1M) is added to the PCC suspension or two distinct 

solutions of CIT (1M) and NaOH (1M) are added separately until the optimum pH is reached. 

The modification of GCC particles did not present lamellar morphology, but a platy/rounded 

one. 

These particles were subjected to thermal analysis (calcination and TGA up to 900 ºC) 

revealing that calcium citrate is its major component, ca. 30% is CaCO3 and 10% are 

unidentified compounds. The size of the particles was measured by the LDS technique, 

revealing that the modified particles are smaller than the starting material, having an average 

size of 3.30 – 3.50 µm. The modified particles obtained from GCC present higher size than its 

original one. Relatively to the particles surface charge, it was found the new structures are 

highly negative. 

The modified particles were applied as paper pigment coating. The coatings with the 

pigments produced with citrate buffer exhibited higher optical density and higher gamut area 

values when compared with the paper base, revealing promising results of these particles in 

increasing paper printing quality. Contrarily, the PCC particles modified only with a CIT 

solution and all GCC modified particles, did not present results as good as the previous. 



 
 

 

 

From the application of these particles into the paper matrix resulted sheets with lower 

filler content. For this reason, conclusions about the influence of these fillers in the paper 

properties are not possible. Further studies are needed related with the retention agent, and the 

possible tendency of the particles to flocculate.

Resumo  

 

A partir de estratégias de dissolução da matriz fibrosa presente no papel de impressão e 

escrita, recorrendo a tampão citrato, com o objetivo de separar o material inorgânico, resultaram 

estruturas lamelares interessantes do ponto de vista papeleiro. Este estudo realizado num 

trabalho anterior, levou a um outro estudo complementar: foi adicionado tampão citrato ao PCC 

(Carbonato de Cálcio Precipitado) escalenoedro industrial, provando assim a origem destas 

estruturas. 

A presente dissertação tem como objetivo o estudo e otimização da reação que ocorre entre 

o tampão citrato e as partículas minerais. Pretende-se também entender que variáveis 

influenciam a modificação do PCC. Posteriormente, a aplicação destas partículas como 

pigmento de revestimento do papel e filler é avaliada pelas propriedades obtidas. 

Num estudo preliminar foi estudada a influência do pH do tampão citrato e a razão entre 

ácido cítrico e partículas de carbonato de cálcio (CIT/PCC) à temperatura de 50 ºC. Desta 

investigação resultaram dois novos protocolos com o objetivo de ter um melhor controlo da 

razão CIT/PCC. Foi também realizada uma experiência usando GCC como material de partida. 

Desta abordagem conclui-se que as partículas lamelares se formam favoravelmente quando a 

suspensão se encontra a pH 5,5. A razão CIT/PCC pode ser controlada pelos diferentes 

protolocos criados onde uma solução de ácido cítrico (1M) é adicionada à suspensão de PCC, 

ou quando duas soluções distintas de CIT (1M) e NaOH (1M) são adicionadas separadamente 

até que o pH ótimo seja atingido. Da modificação das partículas de GCC resultaram partículas 

com morfologias semelhantes a uma moeda. 

Da análise térmica destas partículas (calcinação e TGA até 900 ºC) conclui-se que as 

amostras têm como maior constituinte citrato de cálcio, cerca de 30% de CaCO3 e 10% de 

compostos que não foi possível identificar. A análise à energia de carga superficial revelou que 

as partículas modificadas são eletricamente negativas. 

As partículas foram aplicadas como pigmento de revestimento. Dos revestimentos onde 

foram usadas partículas modificadas com tampão citrato, obtiveram-se valores de densidade 

ótica elevados, resultando por consequência em valores que área gamut superiores aos obtidos 

no papel base usado. Este facto revela resultados promissores na aplicação destas partículas 

para o aumento da qualidade de impressão. As partículas modificadas apenas com solução de 

CIT e as resultantes da modificação de GCC não apresentaram resultados tão bons como os 

anteriores. 



 
 

 

 

A aplicação destas partículas na matriz do papel não foi bem sucedida uma vez que resultou 

na formação de folhas com pouca percentagem de filler. Por esta razão, não podem ser tiradas 

conclusões acerca da influência que estas partículas podem ter nas propriedades do papel. 

Posteriormente, será necessário fazer-se estudos relacionados com o agente de retenção usado 

e sobre a possível tendência das partículas para flocular.

1. Introduction

1 Introduction 
 

1.1  Motivation and Objectives 
 

Mineral fillers, which are paper functional additives, can be found in different types of 

paper, being mostly used on printing and writing paper grades. 

These minerals have several properties (such as morphology, size, surface area, and 

brightness and chemical composition) that improve paper properties such as optical properties, 

bulk (specific volume of the paper), smoothness, and printability. Besides, since fibers are 

replaced by mineral fillers, these have also a very positive impact on the economy of the paper 

making process. 

 Mineral particles can represent 20 to 30% of the paper composition, and higher values are 

uncommon because fillers disrupt the fiber network, so disturbing some mechanical properties 

such as tensile strength and stiffness (Hubbe and Gill, 2016).  

In this scenery, for benchmarking and reverse engineering reasons, it is of utmost 

importance to access the content and structure of the fillers in the paper sheets, and this requires 

the deconstruction of the fiber matrix without damaging the fillers, as much as possible. 

In a previous work, different strategies to deconstruct the fibrous matrix of commercial 

printing and writing papers (P&amp;amp;W) were studied, aiming at isolating the mineral fillers without 

their degradation. In this work, a biological solvent containing citrate buffer was used, among 

other chemical treatments, and as a result particles of PCC (Precipitated Calcium Carbonate) 

with an interesting lamellar shape were obtained, as revealed by FESEM (Field Emission 

Scanning Electron Microscopy). 

This discovery led to a complementary study on what effect could this buffer have on the 

industrial PCC particles. It was confirmed that the citrate buffer can change the scalenohedral 

original PCC shape to a lamellar one. This kind of structure may have a positive impact on 

paper properties when used as filler or also as a pigment coating. 

In this context, the present work was developed with the objective of optimizing the 

conditions of the reaction between the citrate buffer and the mineral particles, and also of 

evaluating the resultant mineral structure and its influence on paper properties (both when used 

in the matrix or at the surface as pigment coating).

2 Paper and Papermaking 
 

In a broader definition, paper is a suspension of cellulosic fibers, properly mixed and 

prepared to form stable bonds with each other that can originate a structure able to support 

traces and stains or used as packaging material as well as other specific applications. The fibrous 

suspension is essentially originated by plants, and additives can be added to it. The final sheet 

is formed after the elimination of water through the mesh of the web and successive drying. 

Paper applications are very vast, however printing and writing (P&amp;amp;W) papers are the most 

widely used, and wood is the main cellulosic source. 

In the papermaking process, wood is used as a renewable raw material that comes from 

well managed forests. The process starts by debarking and chipping the wood. Then the pulp 

manufacture can be done by mechanical or chemical methods, depending on the desired final 

sheet. Chemical pulping is the most used process to obtain high quality printing papers and its 

objective is to remove the lignin components without destroying the cellulosic fibers. In this 

stage, wasted paper for recycling (after de-inking) and broke (paper trimmings and paper that 

must be reprocessed in the mill) can be added to the mixture. 

The next step is refining and it is one of the most important operations since it determines 

some physical properties and the quality of the final sheet - it increases the apparent density of 

the paper (Hubbe and Gill, 2016). Here, fibers suffer mechanical action (such as tensile, 

compressive, shear and bending forces) that opens up and divides them, increasing their surface 

area and consequently improving the fiber bonding. Before heading to the paper machine, fibers 

are washed and screened. Chemical additives can also be added, including dyes and pigments, 

and also fillers (Bajpai, 2015). 

The stock is fed into the paper machine and water is removed forming the paper web, 

initially with the consistency of 0.1%. The sheet is formed in the wire section where water is 

drained through the mesh and fibers are aligned in the machine direction. Vacuum boxes located 

under the wire also help the water drainage. After this, paper undergoes compression, to squeeze 

out more water, and drying, where the remaining water (4-6%) is removed by evaporation. This 

last step, despite only removing a small amount of water, is the most expensive one as it requires 

high energy. The forming paper reaches the consistency value of 97%. 

At the end of the paper machine, the paper is rolled up and cut with the desired diameter. 

Depending on the purpose of the paper, the process is now finished or it will require other 

operations such as coating, calendaring and winding. 

The coating step is usually done in papers that demand high quality and brightness. The 

coating layer is added to the base paper that was produced in the paper machine, and it is

composed by pigments (eg. clay, calcium carbonate), binders (starch) and other additives such 

as polymers and optical brighteners (Biermann, 1996). Binders are used to ensure that the filler 

material connects with the paper surface, forming a cohesive layer. This operation improves, 

not only the uniformity of the paper but also the smoothness and brightness of the base paper. 

It also has an important role in the printing process, since it refines the resolution of printed 

images, improving the gloss of the film and decreasing the show-through, keeping the ink into 

the paper surface. 

An on-machine process called calendaring follows the previous step, where the paper 

passes by a series of polished steel rolls. Here the irregularities in the sheet are reduced, 

improving the smoothness and creating a sheet with higher density. 

 

 

2.1  Paper fillers 
 

As it was previously said, the paper is not made only of cellulosic fibers and that happens 

because the fibers themselves do not comply the requirements of the final customer, with the 

regard to opacity, in typical grades of printing papers, at lower values of basis weight (mass per 

unit of area). Thus, the use of mineral loading gives the papermaker several ways to meet 

customer needs and profitability. Also, to aid the process of papermaking and to improve the 

finished sheet, various types of fillers and additives are added to the pulp before formation 

(Hubbe and Gill, 2016).  

In terms of additives, they can be classified as functional and control additives. The first 

type includes dyes, internal sizing agents, adhesives, and fillers; the second one refers to 

biocides, drainage and retention aids and defoamers, and they do not affect the final paper 

directly and are not necessarily retained on it (Biermann, 1996). 

Fillers, by definition, are water insoluble substances with size magnitude of 0.1 to 10?m 

dispersed into the slurry before paper formation (Hubbe and Gill, 2016). Being the second 

ingredient with the major percentage in the paper, fillers have dominant application in P&amp;amp;W 

papers. There are several reasons for its use, one of them is to reduce the cost of paper 

production, where the increase of 1% in loading material saves approximately $2.50/ton in 

feedstock and energy costs. This cost reduction is due to the drainage and drying improvement 

(energy savings), and to the use of less virgin pulp, since the capacity of paper production can 

be increased with the use of mechanical pulp (with low quality) and recycled pulp (Hu, Shao, 

Li, et al., 2009; Bajpai, 2015).

The filler shape is an important factor to have in consideration, since it affects the light 

scattering properties, the calendaring process, the drying rate, and the air permeability of the 

paper (Biermann, 1996). In terms of shape, they can be classified as “platy”, where are included 

clay, talc, and mica, or as “blocky”, such as ground calcium carbonate (GCC) (Hubbe and Gill, 

2016). 

Depending on the filler size distribution, fillers can have different behavior if applied as a 

coating or bulk material. In the coating process, a wide particle size distribution can be an 

advantage, as the particles join together forming a dense layer (Hubbe and Gill, 2016). 

However, as paper filling, a uniform particle size distribution has a better impact. Besides it, in 

this context, the mineral length is a key factor, since particles with a larger diameter may not 

be retained in the matrix due to their decreased specific surface area. On the contrary, smaller 

particles have a higher surface area but they compete with the sizing agent, being difficult to 

give internal sizing to the final sheet (Biermann, 1996). 

Among other reasons, mineral loading contributes to improving the paper formation since 

it fills the empty spaces around the fibers. For this reason, the inorganic material provides the 

sheet a more uniform and a smoother surface, increases the opacity and brightness and enhances 

the printability (the show through is decreased and the receptivity to ink is increased) (Au and 

Thron, 1995; Jimoh, Ariffin, et al., 2017). 

It is obvious that, depending on the interaction of the filler with inks, glues, or other 

polymers, applied to the paper surface, the final product can be differentiated. So, a detailed 

knowledge of the mineral composition and morphology can be helpful to the papermaker to 

evaluate the pros and cons of the use of a certain filler. 

 

 

2.2  Coating process  
 

The coating process is commonly used in the papermaking industry to improve the 

appearance and printability of the paper. The base paper is rough and difficult to cover with a 

thin coating layer. For printing methods it is required that the coating layer is homogeneous and 

covers the substrate. The desired properties for a coated paper are usually high brightness and 

high gloss. Although, this step increases the production cost and is therefore mainly used when 

the appearance of the product is of great importance. 

In paper coating, an aqueous suspension is applied to the base paper surface, filling the 

uneven spaces, and covering the highest lying fibers as possible. The size of the covering layer 



New Precipitated Calcium Carbonate Derived Structures for Application in Papermaking 

6 

 

is influenced by its density: for the same weight, a coating with low density has a greater 

covering area than a coating with high density. It can be done in one side, or in both sides of 

the sheet. After, the paper is dried and finished, achieving the gloss and smoothness required.  

The suspension used for the coating is a mixture of water with white pigments (eg. clay, 

calcium carbonate, talc and titanium dioxide) and binders (eg. starch and latex). Some additives 

can be added to influence the solid content, rheology and water retention, such as dispersants 

and thickeners. The coating layer consolidates as water evaporates, allowing the binder to form 

bridges between the pigment particles and the base paper. This suspension should only contain 

the necessary amount of water to ensure flow properties, in order to save energy and costs for 

drying. In the industrial coating, the solid content is about 70wt%. 

As one of the purposes for coating paper is to enhance the printability, the coating layer 

should be strong enough to resist the stress of the printing process, thus there is an allowable 

minimum amount of binder that can give the necessary strength to the coating. However, when 

the suspension has excess of binder, it can have a negative effect on the coated paper such as 

low opacity and gloss, as well as glueability problems. 

The industrial coating technique is in constant evolution to comply with the demands for 

high quality and faster production. The most common coating processes used are applicator 

rolls (also called dip coater) and jet applicators (Figure 1). In these methods, an excess of coat 

is applied to the substrate that is after measured with the desired coat weight (Ek, Gellerstedt 

and Henriksson, 2009). In the first method, the suspension is transferred from a bin to the 

substrate which is supported by a large backing roll. The amount of coating transferred to the 

substrate is influenced by the distance between the backing roll and the applicator, the speed of 

the applicator, and by the viscosity of the mixture. The jet applicator applies the coating 

suspension on the paper surface through a nozzle and here, the coating transfer is controlled by 

the width of the opening, the pressure of the jet and the angle of the applicator to the moving 

paper web.

In laboratory studies, the coating process is made with a bench coater, an equipment very 

easy to handle. This coater uses a rod placed on the top of the substrate which is attached to a 

holder that moves the rod over the substrate at a given speed. The coating suspension is applied 

manually in front of the rod and then is transferred to the substrate by the gap between the rod 

and the paper surface. The excess of coating is pushed forwards by the moving rod until the end 

of the paper base. The thickness of the coating layer is controlled not only by the distance 

between the rod and the surface, but also by the kind of rod used. 

When the coating is applied in the paper, the water is absorbed into the paper and the natural 

evaporation helps to promote the drying process. However, the absorption of water must be 

allowed in the shortest time as possible to preserve the dimensional and strength properties of 

paper. To speed up the drying process the coated paper is dried by means of air or infrared (IR) 

dryers. The last ones can remove water more efficiently than the air dryers, and for that reason 

are the most used dryers. 

The properties of the final coated paper can be improved by the calendering process, 

producing a surface suitable for printing. Here, the paper undergoes compression in one or more 

rolling nips, reducing the roughness of the surface. These rolls can be heated or have a higher 

line load to increase the compression. However, in this treatment, the temperature has high 

impact in the increasing of gloss and decreasing of roughness. Besides its positive effects, 

calendering promotes the decreasing of the opacity and brightness of the coating layer. 

 

 

2.3 Pigments 
 

The pigment particles in the coating layer represent about 85-95wt% of the coating layer, 

and its properties influence not only the coating layer formation but also the calendaring 

process. The coating mixture must be able to flow during the application and should cover all 

the paper fibers. Because of the last reason, coarse and platy particles as well as high coat 

weights are often used in the mixture; also, the minerals used are white pigments to hide the 

fibers and thus allowing the improvement of brightness, whiteness, opacity, and smoothness.  

The cost of the coating is determined by the pigment used, and the more commonly used 

are calcium carbonates and kaolin. These pigments are usually from natural origin and are 

physically and chemically homogenous; their properties (such as particle size and distribution, 

particle shape, refractive index, light scattering, light absorption, and density) can affect the 

final appearance of the coating as it can be seen in Table 1 (Holik, 2013; Bajpai, 2015). 



New Precipitated Calcium Carbonate Derived Structures for Application in Papermaking

The largest dimension of a pigment is defined as its aspect ratio and gives the platiness of 

the pigment, responsible for the properties of the coated paper such as gloss and porosity of the 

surface (Holik, 2013). Those pigments are often agglomerates or aggregates of many particles, 

which can be difficult to measure in size. For that reason there are techniques, such as laser 

light diffraction that provide the particle size distribution (PSD) of equivalent spherical 

particles, however it can be used as comparative methods for particles with other shapes. A 

narrow PSD has very small and very large pigment particles, which leads to a more porous 

structure of the coating layer, contributing strongly to optical properties such as increasing of 

gloss and brightness. However finer particles promote higher gloss and lower roughness of 

coatings (Caner, Farnood and Yan, 2006).

2.3.1 Printing process and printing quality 

 

Printing properties are dependent on the coating process, since this treatment enhances the 

paper surface properties, and can make it suitable to receive ink. The objective of printing is to 

reproduce texts and coloured pictures using cyan, magenta, yellow, and black inks (CMYK). 

Nowadays, the processes used for printing proposes are the technologies of offset, flexographic 

and rotogravure printing. In addition, digital printing process, such as inkjet and xerography, 

are also widely used (Holik, 2013). The process used in the present work is the inkjet printing, 

and for that reason, this section will be relative to it.  

In the inkjet printing the image formed directly on the substrate is controlled by digital 

data. For this reason, this system can work with a large variety of inks and is able to print several 

kinds of data. Inkjet papers are usually coated by starches, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polymers, 

and pigments. This is mostly made to enhance the whiteness and the inks’ receptivity to the 

surface (Mesic and Johnston, 2013). 



2.Paper and Papermaking

It is a contactless printing process, which means that it can be used in several types of 

substrates. The ink passes from a reservoir and can be propel onto the paper in two distinct 

ways: drop-on-demand (DOD) and continuous inkjet. In the DOD inkjet, the ink droplets are 

expelled from the reservoir, directly to the paper, due to a pressure change created by a heating 

element or a piezoelectric element. In continuous inkjet, a continuous flow of ink is created by 

means of a pump, and with help of the vibration of piezoelectric crystals, it is broken into 

individual droplets. This droplets are then charged and subjected to an electrostatic field, 

controlling this way their direction to a specific point (Singh et al., 2010). 

The print quality is influenced by the ink properties (surface tension and viscosity), which 

control the droplet spreading, and by the substrate’s absorption properties, such as roughness, 

surface tension and porosity (Martin, 2005). The inks used in this printing process are normally 

composed by an aqueous solvent that serves as a vehicle for dyes and pigments to disperse 

evenly.  

 Despite the fact that the ink needs to be rapidly immobilized onto the paper surface, its 

high absorbency can lead to print-through and poor optical density. However, if the absorption 

process takes more time than the desired, it may spread laterally resulting in colour-to-bleed. 

To have the pretended printing quality properties, it is the major importance to control ink 

spreading, holdout and its penetration in the paper; the paper opacity is also an aspect to be 

taken into account. 

The printing quality requires the evaluation of its parameters with high exigency. 

Printability results from the complex interactions between the ink, the printing process, and the 

paper. The sheet must be able to accept evenly the solids of the ink, without the formation of 

irregular films and stains (Bajpai, 2015). 

The evaluation of the printing quality should be made with methods able to quantify 

numerically its parameters. These tests evaluate the uniformity, definition, contrast and optical 

density. Some important aspects related to these properties are: 

 

- Mottling: stained pattern observed in a printed sheet. 

 

- Colour-to-colour bleeding: measure the mixture between two adjacent colours. This 

parameter is related to the lateral spreading of the ink to an adjacent area where another colour 

was printed. This phenomenon is due to low ink absorption in the paper, leading to higher 

drying time, and increasing the risk of blending between the two colours. 

 



New Precipitated Calcium Carbonate Derived Structures for Application in Papermaking 

10 

 

- Optical Density: it is dependent on the amount of ink that penetrates in the paper. It is 

given by the relation between of light reflected from a paper sheet before and after printing. A 

higher optical density corresponds to a thicker film of ink, resulting in higher colour intensity 

(Moutinho, Ferreira and Figueiredo, 2007). 

 

 

- Gamut area: this value translates the paper’s ability to reproduce colours. It is given by 

the area on a hexagon whose vertices correspond to the pairs (a*, b*). These values are 

integrated on the coordinated system CIELab, which uses the colour coordinates L* 

(luminosity), a* (measure of shade in the red/green axis), and b* (measure of shade in the 

yellow/blue axis). The positive values of a* and b* are the correspondent colours of red and 

yellow (Moutinho, Ferreira and Figueiredo, 2007). A representation of this can be seen in 

Figure 2 . 

 

 

- Print-through: is relative to the ability to see a printed image on the opposite side of the 

sheet. It is calculated with the chromatic coordinates L*, a* and b*, and influenced by the 

pigment/dye penetration. 

 

- Show-through: depends on the quantity of pigment/dye that is retained at the paper 

surface. It is also calculated with the chromatic coordinates L*, a* and b*, and it is evaluated 

laying a sheet above the printed one, evaluating the ability to see the printed image through it. 

 

Another important aspect of the printing process is the runnability. This parameter is 

influenced by the strength properties of the paper and corresponds to the velocity that the paper 

passes through the printing machine without causing disturbs and stops (Bajpai, 2015).

2.4 Inorganic materials most used in the papermaking process 
 

The loading material used onto the paper can be distinguished in two different groups, 

organic and inorganic. The organic fillers are mostly used in speciality papers or coated P&amp;amp;W 

papers. However, due to their high cost, they are not used in all paper grades. In this group are 

included polymers, starch derivatives, and resins. The inorganic fillers are the most widely used 

in the papermaking process, since they confer great properties to the paper at low cost. 

As it was said before, the main objective of the present thesis is to study the new material 

found in a previous work based on reverse engineering, where the main goal was to isolate the 

inorganic fillers contained in the matrix of commercial printing and writing paper, without their 

degradation (Carecho, 2016). 

To better understand some characteristics of this new material, it is important to know in 

advance which are the inorganic fillers most used in the papermaking process, as loading fillers 

and as a coating pigments. 

As shown in Figure 3, in terms of quantities applied and global demand in the papermaking 

filler market, the main loading material used are calcium carbonates (64%, where 49%  is GCC 

and 15% is PCC), followed by kaolin (29%), titanium dioxide (1%), and talc and other pigments 

(6%) (Nutbeem, 2013; Bajpai, 2015).

A coated paper is characterized for its excellent printability, esthetical attractiveness and a 

valuable feel. Most of the pigments used in coating are cheaper than chemical pulps, and their 

use represents a very important economic factor. Figure 4 shows the global consumption of the 

inorganic materials used as pigments, where it can be highlighted the use of calcium carbonates 

(76%) and kaolin (20%) as the minerals with highest demand market (Nutbeem, 2013). 

Nowadays the use of calcium carbonate is increasing and talc is showing constant growth, 

whereas kaolin is stagnating (Bajpai, 2015). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There are some important characteristics of the pigment that are very relevant from a 

papermaker’s perspective such as colour, brightness, opacity power (given from their scattering 

coefficient) and, of course, its cost. Usually, the fillers with the highest optical performance 

have the smallest particle size, and the highest refractive index, brightness and scattering 

coefficient. Table 2 summarizes typical values for the minerals mentioned before and the 

following topics give a brief description of these materials and their properties that will 

influence in the papermaking process (Holik, 2013; Hubbe and Gill, 2016). More importance 

will be given to PCC, since it was the starting material of the new particles in study in this work.

2.4.1 Kaolin 

 

Kaolin, Al4(OH)8(Si4O10), is a white silicate material that can be found in sedimentary 

and metamorphic deposits, and it is formed by decomposition of granite. It has a platy 

morphology and it is predominantly used in uncoated papers. This almost inexpensive mineral 

has desirable optical properties when used as filler, since it lowers the porosity of the sheet 

increasing the gloss of the finished paper after calendaring (Holik, 2013; Bajpai, 2015; Hubbe 

and Gill, 2016). 

Nowadays, kaolin remains a major resource in papermaking as a wet-end additive and as a 

coating pigment. The growth of the supercalendered paper market raises the need of higher 

brightness in the sheets, which promotes the continuous use of kaolin. This is due to its natural 

shape that, when used for fiber coverage, leads to paper and printing gloss. Also, mixing this 

pigment with GCC, PCC and talc can lead to a better performance (Bajpai, 2015). 

The coating pigment is mixed with water and binder, and applied to a paper substrate by 

means of a high speed blade coater (Bundy and Ishley, 1991). Its particle shape with higher 

aspect ratio and its high brightness are the most appealing properties for application in the base 

paper. After calendering, the particles tend to orient parallel to the surface promoting both 

proper smoothness and gloss, giving an optimal ink receptive surface (Bundy and Ishley, 1991; 

Caner, Farnood and Yan, 2006; Ek, Gellerstedt and Henriksson, 2009).

2.4.2 Talc 

 

Talc, Mg3Si4O10(OH)2, is a layered silicate with a platy morphology. The layers of this 

mineral are electrostatically neutral resulting in a mineral strongly oleophilic. However, due to 

its surface properties, talc is known as a detackifier and used a pitch controller in the 

papermaking process. This inert mineral is also characterized by its softness and for being 

organophilic (helping to reduce dye consumption and two-sidedness in the coloured paper) 

(Gane and Ag; Bajpai, 2015; Hubbe and Gill, 2016). 

When used as a filler, this mineral contributes to paper hydrophobicity and uniformity of 

colour in both sides of the sheet. Due to their relatively large particles and water resistant 

particles, this mineral improves dewatering in the papermaking process, it leads to higher 

retention in the sheet and lowers the papers’ strength properties. The pitch control function 

leads to a better runnability of the paper machine. Speaking in the paper quality itself, the use 

of talc increases the smoothness, gives better printability (especially in rotogravure papers), 

deeper colour in coloured papers, and has a lower impact on strength properties than other fillers 

(Holik, 2013; Bajpai, 2015).  

Talc is used nowadays in light weighted coated paper (LWC) and coated fine papers in 

offset formulations. As coating pigment, since talc has a low coefficient of friction due to the 

low cohesion that exists between the crystal layers inside the talc particles,  it reduces paper 

breaks, even when subjected to constant tension (Holik, 2013). The properties of the coating 

can improve some properties such as smoothness, coarseness peeling resistance and ink 

absorption. However, talc tends to reduce gloss and prolong the ink drying time. It is also said 

that if a composite of talc and silica is used as coating pigment, it enhances the quality of the 

printed images better than when used as a single pigment (Lin et al., 2016). 

 

 

2.4.3 Titanium Dioxide 

 

Titanium dioxide, TiO2, is a speciality filler and it has the highest brightness, density and 

opacity power of all the pigments used in papermaking. However, it costs 5 to 10 times more 

than other commonly used fillers. It is mainly used in paper with low basis weights that have 

demanding requirements for opacity.  

Titanium is the fourth most abundant chemical element on earth and occurs in the form of 

oxides or mixed oxides of other elements. Titanium dioxide is produced by the sulfate or the 

chloride process, and it has three modifications with different structures, giving therefore 



2.Paper and Papermaking

different physical properties. They are rutile, anatase, and brookite. But, due to their 

thermodynamic characteristics and physical properties, rutile and anatase are the most 

important in the field. These pigments show an extremely high refractive index (2.75 for rutile 

and 2.55 for anatase), even when the paper is wet (eg. label paper). Rutile is used in grades that 

require high opacity, while anatase supports OBAs better. However, the size of the particles of 

titanium dioxide are extremely small with sizes between 0.2?m and 0.25?m, and this mineral 

has a very complex chemistry in application, causing difficulties of retention is the paper web 

(Holik, 2013; Morsy et al., 2015; Hubbe and Gill, 2016). 

As paper coating, TiO2 is the most effective white pigment and provides the increase of 

opacity of the coated paper, and it also enhances the topographical properties of the paper 

surface.  The quality improvements, besides the ones already mentioned, are related to the 

smoothness and, most importantly, the printability and print image quality. These pigments are 

often used together with extenders to provide highest efficiency (Holik, 2013; Morsy et al., 

2015). 

 

 

2.4.4  Ground Calcium Carbonate 

 

Natural calcium carbonate, CaCO3, commonly known as GCC, is a filler with an extreme 

importance in the industry. It is predominantly applied in woodfree uncoated papers, 

mechanical uncoated paper, newsprint, and coating base papers. The mineral form of GCC 

occurs in limestones, chalks or marbles. Depending on the ambient pressure, temperature and 

water contact, calcium carbonate has six different polymorphs: amorphous calcium carbonate 

(ACC), calcium carbonate hexahydratate, calcium carbonate monohydratate, vaterite, aragonite 

and calcite; its thermodynamic stability increases from ACC to calcite (Hu, Shao, Cai, et al., 

2009; El-Sheikh et al., 2013; Hubbe and Gill, 2016; Jimoh, Okoye, et al., 2017). 

The crystal structure of GCC is rhombohedral, and fillers based on limestone and marble 

are chosen in the papermaking industry to give higher brightness. In the production of 

newsprint, where there is less demand for brightness, fillers based on chalk are used because of 

its lower brightness. The finesses of GCC fillers for paper gives higher gloss and may improve 

brightness, thanks to higher light scattering, low abrasiveness, and low dusting out of the paper 

surface in the printing process. Coarser GCC particles, at a given percentage, tend to increase 

the strength of the sheet and requires low demand of sizing agents, when compared with other 

types of fillers.

16 

 

Another advantage in the use of GCC in the papermaking is its low cost. The use of GCC 

also promotes drainage, reducing the energy of the drying stage of the papermaking process.  

The negative surface charge of many GCC products can be controlled with the use of 

dispersants, otherwise the behaviour as wet-end additives can be affected. 

Since calcium carbonate is soluble under acidic conditions, the papermaking environment 

must be near neutral or at slightly alkaline pH. Paper containing GCC produced under acidic 

conditions can decompose relatively faster, requiring expensive measures of conservation. 

As coating pigment, GCC needs less amount of binders and allows drying energy savings. 

Its structural shape promotes excellent runnability even with high solid content and highest 

coating speed (Holik, 2013; Bajpai, 2015). 

Nowadays, GCC particles have been modified, originating a pigment with completely 

different morphologies and properties. The specific surface of this mineral can be increased and 

can provide excellent paper properties, such as good printability in offset and rotogravure and 

easy gloss development (Wang et al., 2009). 

 

 

2.4.5  Precipitated Calcium Carbonate 

 

Starting from GCC particles, it is possible to synthesize another type of CaCO3, by a 

precipitation reaction, called precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC). The new mineral has 

different morphologies, characteristics and crystal size from the precursor material. Generally, 

GCC is cheaper than PCC, although due to the grinding process that is necessary to form 

particles size of GCC with several microns, its price increases due to the high-energy costs 

involved (Hu, Shao, Cai, et al., 2009). 

 PCC has several advantages over GCC because of its unique properties, high purity, and 

a uniform particle size distribution and shape. The shape, sizes and properties of the crystal 

surface, depends on the specific synthesis reaction process used. Usually, commercial PCC 

purity is about 97% on CaCO3 content, and the remainder is MgCO3 and other residues of the 

industrial process (Hu, Shao, Cai, et al., 2009; El-Sheikh et al., 2013; Holik, 2013; Bajpai, 

2015; Jimoh, Okoye, et al., 2017). 

There are several methods of producing PCC, where the simplest one is a solid-liquid route, 

which involves a direct reaction in aqueous solution between the ions Ca2+ and CO3
-2. Other 

common route is the carbonation method, a solid-liquid-gas reaction. Although it is a slower 

method compared with the first one, it is the procedure most used by the industries due to its 

low cost, higher yield and higher purity. Depending on the geochemical composition, the

original rock, rich in carbonate, is calcined using temperatures from 900 to 1000 ºC to produce 

calcium oxide (also called lime) and carbon dioxide. In this step, 44% of the mineral’s original 

mass is lost. After this, the calcium oxide is treated with distilled water to produce calcium 

hydroxide (milk of lime). The resulting material is then purified and carbonated with the carbon 

dioxide (CO2) obtained earlier in the calcination process. These steps are shown below in the 

Reactions 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3. The low solubility that CO2 has in water leads to a slower reaction 

(Geyssant, 2003; Xiang et al., 2004; Bajpai, 2015; Hubbe and Gill, 2016; Jimoh, Okoye, et al., 

2017).

During the precipitation step, the exposure of Ca(OH)2 to CO2 gradually lowers the pH. 

This is one of the factors that may influence the size and morphology of the product crystal. 

Other factors include temperature, agitation, pressure, reaction speed, addition of other soluble 

materials. The PCC particles have a more uniform structure compared with GCC. The end 

material can have several structures such as scalenohedral, rhombohedral and acicular, as 

represented in Figure 5.

PCC is the most widely used filler for paper and this is motivated by its high light 

scattering, making possible to achieve great results of opacity and brightness without the use of 

expensive minerals, such as TiO2 (Velho, 2003). 

The most common kind of PCC used is the scalenohedral one. This shape gives paper 

favourable properties such as stiffness and bulk, when compared with other fillers. Although, a 

higher bulk decreases the strength properties because the sheet becomes more porous and 

permeable (Bajpai, 2015; Hubbe and Gill, 2016). This property is also propitious to ink 

receptivity, resulting in better print quality. 

As coating pigment, when blended with GCC, it is possible to adjust a balance between 

bulking properties and strength and runnability (Laufamann et al., 2000). Also, strength of the 

paper can also be enhanced when using a suspension of PCC with cooking starch. 

PCC is a mineral that is in constant study as there are numerous factors that can contribute 

to its modification and to improve its use in a specific area. For this reason, there are some 

companies specialized in the polymorphism’s study of this material for paper application and 

improvement of its properties, when used as filler or coating pigment (Omya, 2015; Imerys, 

2017; Inc., 2017).  

Some researchers reported the use of modified PCC as paper filler to improve its properties. 

Loading material of PCC with whiskers shape may confer improvements of electric resistance 

and elasticity modulus (Cheng et al., 2004; Chen, Qian and An, 2011). Also, Hu et al. (2009) 

showed improvements of the physical and optical properties of the paper when fillers of needle-

shape aragonite were used. 

To better understand how the modification of PCC occurs is the main study of this thesis; 

thus, it is important to make a review (Section 2.5) of the research that was already made to 

obtain neddle-shape, whisker or lamellar structure. Other aspect to have in consideration is the 

use of the organic additives as CIT and/or sodium citrate (SC) with calcium carbonate to obtain 

the mentioned structures. 

 

 

2.5  Calcium carbonate and Organic Compounds 
 

In the previous work, one of the techniques used to deconstruct the cellulosic matrix of the 

paper, to obtain its mineral loading without its degradation, was an enzymatic complex. This 

complex is activated with the use of SC buffer.  This led to a white dust as residue that was 

after characterized by several methods in which is included FESEM. The obtained pictures 

show a completely different morphology of the original PCC used as loading filler. The residue 



2.Paper and Papermaking

obtained has lamellar morphology. Thus, it was possible to conclude that the used buffer causes 

the change on the shape of PCC (Carecho, 2016). 

To better understand how the PCC is influenced by the citrate, it is important to have an 

idea of the approaches already tested (with citrate or other organic compounds) to obtain the 

same or similar structures, such as needle-shape or other elongated shapes. The application of 

this modified particles on paper is also a point to take into account. Other aspect to have in 

consideration is the use of citrate with calcium carbonate and in which aspects it influences this 

mineral. 

 

 

2.5.1 A review 

 

The controlled synthesis of calcium carbonate has received much attention due to its wide 

application in many industrial fields, including paper, paint, and plastics production (Geyssant, 

2003). As it was said in the previous sections, there are several aspects that can be manipulated 

to control the morphology and the properties of the end particles. Numerous researches are 

being made to study the behaviour of this particular mineral, and some of them will be presented 

below. A resume of these studies can be found in Table 3. 

 

Meldrum and Hyde (2001) synthesized calcium carbonate precipitated from saturated 

solutions in the presence of magnesium (Mg) and organic additives (citric and malic acid (MA), 

both known to enhance incorporation of Mg in the calcite lattice). Their aim was to investigate 

the impact in the end particles morphologies mingling Mg with the calcite. The particles 

precipitation was made by the carbonation process, at pH 7 at room temperature and pressure, 

and the crystals were grown for ten weeks. The resulted material exhibited a range of shapes of 

calcite and some of them can be pointed out: 

- Precipitation in the absence of Mg (only using calcium carbonate and the organic acids): 

the influence of malic and citric acids was very striking. CIT showed a more pronounced affect 

in the crystal morphology and growth then the malic acid, while malic acid exerted influence 

on crystal morphology even at very low concentrations. The final result showed elongated 

crystals with both acids, depending on the concentration used. 

- Precipitation in the presence of Mg and organic acids: from this experiment resulted 

even more pronounced structural modifications, and once again, CIT exerted a stronger

morphological influence. Depending on the concentrations used, it can be highlighted the 

appearance of elongated and lamellar crystals.

Westin and Rasmuson (2003) investigated the influence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid 

(EDTA) and citrate on the process of precipitation of calcium carbonate. The effect of the 

concentration of this organic compounds on the particle size and shape was also observed. Other 

process conditions were also studied such as feed rate, calcium/carbonate ratio and pH. The 

reaction temperature was maintained at 50ºC and the pH varied from 9 to 11. The resulted

obtained particles presented changes in their morphology depending on the absence or use of 

additives. Without the presence of additives, the obtained material was needle-like shaped. The 

complexing agents proved to have strong influence on the crystals’ morphology: CIT promotes 

the rhombic structure at pH 10 and a calcium/carbonate ratio of ¼, whereas the presence of 

EDTA generates mostly spherical particles. 

 

Cheng et al. (2004) studied the crystallization of CaCO3 particles in the absence and 

presence of polyacrylic acid (PAA), polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) 

and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), by a solution process. The reaction occurred 

at temperatures of 25ºC and 80ºC, respectively, and pH 10. The resultant solution was allowed 

to stand under static conditions for 24h. The reference particles (without any additive) revealed 

to be a plate-like aggregate of calcite at 25ºC, and rhombohedral at 80ºC. This study showed 

that PAA has significant influence on the morphology of CaCO3 at 25ºC, forming ellipsoidal 

particles. Also, with the use of CTAB at 80ºC, there were obtained aragonite wiskers. PVA 

induced also great modification at 80ºC, forming drendrite-shaped aggregates. PEG showed no 

influence in crystal modification. 

 

Altay, Shahwan and Tano?lu (2007) investigated the influence of the additives CTAB, 

EDTA and polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA) on the morphology of CaCO3 at 

variable temperature (30ºC, 50ºC, 70ºC, and 90ºC). The precipitation reaction was made by a 

solution process, at pH 9 and with an aging time of 24h. The effects of these additives were 

studied, showing that the higher temperature has great influence on the particles’ modification. 

PDDA additive transforms the original rhombohedral shape into rectangular prism calcite. The 

CTAB at lower temperatures forms plate-like crystals, while at higher temperatures promotes 

the formation of branch-like particles. When adding EDTA to the solution, the crystals obtained 

are composed by calcite and aragonite and the final morphology at lower temperature is similar 

to an apple core; however with the increase of the temperature, the crystal tends to elongate and 

at 90ºC the particle shape is prismatic rod. 

 

Park et al. (2008) investigated the effects of the ions Mg2+ and organic additives such as 

citric and malic acid in the synthesis of PCC by the carbonation process. The reaction occurred 

at 80ºC and controlled pH, and the obtained crystals were filtered and dried for 12h at 80ºC. 

The study showed that the crystals’ aspect ratio increases as the concentration of Mg2+ 

increases; also there is an optimal ratio Mg/CIT where the growth of needle-like minerals are

favoured. Also, SEM images show needle-like shape well defined when citric or malic acid are 

used. The authors also consider that these organic additives may disrupt aragonite formation by 

reaction with magnesium ions rather than facilitating calcium carbonate synthesis through 

association with calcium ions.  

 

Wang et al. (2009) obtained lamellar aragonite by using sodium stearate (SS) as additive 

in the solution process of precipitation of CaCO3. The reaction occurred at 60 ºC for 15h. After 

this time, the precipitate was washed and dried for one day at 80 ºC. This additive was proven 

to not only modify the morphology of the precipitated aragonite, but also to increase its 

hydrophobicity.  

 

Chen and Xiang (2009) synthesized CaCO3 polymorphs with double injection of CaCl2 and 

NH4HCO3 solutions without any additive. The temperatures used in this study vary from 30ºC 

to 80ºC. The resulted material was dried at 105ºC for 12h. The study of the influence of the 

temperature on the shape of the particles revealed that at 30ºC mushroom-like lamellar 

aggregates are formed, and with the increasing of the temperature the material’s shape tends to 

be more lamellar; at 80ºC rod-like products were obtained. It was also noticed that the values 

of [??3
?2]/[??+2] decreased with the increase of temperature, and the authors say that this fact 

could be one of the reasons for the difference between the shapes formed at 30-40ºC and at 

80ºC. 

 

Hu et al. (2009) reported the synthesis of needle-like aragonite directly from GCC using a 

reversible reaction between magnesium chloride (MgCl2) aqueous solution and GCC. The 

calcination process was not used in this case. The reaction occurs at the synthesis temperature 

of aragonite, 70ºC. The crystals were aged at room temperature for 2h. 

The same authors (Hu et al., 2009) introduced these same particles as paper fillers to 

evaluate the strength of the paper. Their results showed improvements in some paper properties 

such as tensile strength and folding endurance, when compared with paper using commercial 

PCC. The stiffness of the sheets on the machine direction was increased. This experiment 

revealed that the price of the paper can be decreased even when the loading with needle-like 

aragonite is increased.

2.5.2 Citric acid/ sodium citrate influence on calcium carbonate 

 

The influence of CIT and its salt on calcium carbonate particles is not yet fully understood. 

However, there are some characteristics such as its low toxicity that make CIT one of the 

organic acids most used widely. The reaction of organic acids with carbonate compounds is 

complex due to its reversibility and for being thermodynamically limited by the presence of 

reaction products (Chatelain, Silberberg and Schechter, 1976). 

CIT has three carboxylic (COOH) and one hydroxyl (OH) groups, which have a great 

importance in its reactions. Figure 6  shows CIT and SC molecules, respectively. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In the presence of calcium ions, CIT behaves as a sequestering or as a chelation agent, 

resulting water-soluble or water-insoluble compounds, respectively. This depends on some 

factors such as the ionic strength, pH, and temperature of the mixture. 

Some researchers had studied the behaviour of this carboxylic acid with calcium carbonate, 

mainly when used in the precipitation process (Reddy and Hoch, 2001; Wada, Kanamura and 

Umegaki, 2001; Westin and Rasmuson, 2003; Karar, Naamoune and Kahoul, 2016). One aspect 

in common in these studies is that CIT acts as a growth inhibitor during the crystallization step, 

and this phenomenon increases with the increasing of the concentration of CIT. Wada, 

Kanamura and Umegaki (2001) suggested that this inhibition capacity may be dependent on the 

carboxylic groups, by their adsorption onto the calcium carbonate particles. This mechanism 

may also contribute to the modification of the characteristic morphology of calcite crystals. The 

same study say that the bond between carboxylate ions (from the carboxylic acids) and free 

Ca2+ of the calcium carbonate surface, may lead to the increase of the particles hydrophobicity. 

Karar, Naamoune and Kahoul (2016) also studied the effect of mixing CIT and SC with 

CaCO3. As this mixture has two inhibitors, the chelation capacity for calcium ions is higher 

than the one with the two organic compounds used separately. This causes the increase of the 

nucleation time and the crystal size reduction. In this study, the formation of calcium citrate 

(Ca3(C6H5O7)2 ? 4H2O) is also described. The deprotonation of CIT in the presence of SC 

chelate with Ca2+ forms a calcium-CIT complex, Figure 7.

CIT is a weak acid, it ionizes as the following steps (Reactions 2.4 to 2.7), and considering 

A = (C6H4O6) (Gerardo, George and Marten, 2004; Apelblat, 2015; Karar, Naamoune and 

Kahoul, 2016).

? ?  ????2? + ?+ (2.5) 

????2? ?  ???3? + ?+ (2.6) 

???3? ?  ??4? + ?+ (2.7) 

 

These reactions depend on the pH and the respective dissociation constant, pKa. At 25ºC, 

for CIT these values are pKa1=3.13, pKa2=4.76, pKa3=6.4 and pKa4=11.6 (Al-Khaldi et al., 

2007). The ionic distribution of CIT as function of pH is plotted in Figure 8  (Al-Khaldi et al., 

2003). This shows that when CIT is dissolved in water, its pH is in the range 1.7-2.1. With the 

increasing of pH, the carboxylic groups are released from the molecule, being free to accept the 

calcium ions in the solution, as concluded by Karar, Naamoune and Kahoul (2016). 

Thus, as the pH value increases, more CIT (?3???), di-hydrogen (?2???
?), and mono-

hydrogen (????2?) citrate ions are ionized to produce citrate ions (???3?) at pH greater 

than 6.

As CIT enters in contact with CaCO3, calcium ions are released, as well as water and carbon 

dioxide (Reaction 2.8). Then the di-hydrogen citrate ions capture the calcium ions and form a 

calcium-CIT complex (Reaction 2.9)) (Al-Khaldi et al., 2007).

If the solubility limit of calcium citrate is exceeded, at pH ? 6 it precipitates, as described 

by the Reaction 2.10. In fact, (Carecho, 2016) reported that at this point of the reaction, the 

white suspension of PCC with SC turned transparent, turning white again after a few minutes - 

corresponding to the dissolution and posterior precipitation of calcium citrate.

The formed calcium complex is insoluble in water and its solubility is not strongly 

dependent of the temperature, since as the temperature increases the solubility value is slightly 

increased (Apelblat, 1993). 

Since the calcium citrate precipitation depends on the pH value, the presence of CO2 is an 

important factor: CO2 dissolves in water, forming carbonic acid (H2CO3) which reacts with 

CaCO3 (Reaction 2.11 and 2.12).

The previous reactions prevail at pH higher than 5, where the partial pressure of carbon 

dioxide exceeds the atmospheric pressure (Al-Khaldi et al., 2007). 

To sum up, the overall reaction between CIT and CaCO3 can be written as presented in 

Reaction 2.13.  

 

2 ?6?8?7 +3 ????3 ? ??3(?6?5?7)2 +3 ??2 ? + 3 ?2? (2.13) 

 

As the 2nd proton of CIT is being released, CO2 is being formed allowing the formation 

of carbonic acid with the reaction with water. The di-hydrogen citrate ions accept the free 

calcium ions, forming a calcium-CIT complex. The formation of carbonic acid seems to prevent 

the 3rd citric acid proton from spending. Since the 1st proton of carbonic acid has a pKa of 6.35, 

and the 3rd proton of CIT has a pKa of 6.4, the system is buffered around these pH values, due 

to the protons’ competition. As the CIT concentration increases, the pH lowers, and its protons 

have a dominant effect. Thus, the release of the 3rd proton is promoted, and consequently the 

molecule can accept the calcium ions, forming the calcium citrate molecule (Al-Khaldi et al., 

2007 and Al-Khaldi et al., 2003). 

However, in none of these investigations is referred the formation of lamellar structures 

due to the reaction of calcium carbonate with CIT or SC. A more detailed study must be made 

to understand how the lamellar particles are originated in the presence of SC.

3 Materials and Methods 
 

The aim of this dissertation, as previously referred, is to study the modifications on the 

scalenohedral PCC morphology when it is in contact with citrate buffer. The final mineral has 

a lamellar shape, and it is not yet understood the mechanism that originates this kind of 

structure. Thus, as starting point, the experimental protocol used in the complementary study 

made by Carecho (2016) was reproduced, and used as reference (Appendix A. I). After this, 

some process modifications were made in order to optimize the logistic of the reaction and 

reduce its time as well. To assess how the reaction conditions can enhance the formation of 

lamellar particles, a pH study was made, maintaining the temperature that was initially used. 

The influence of the ratio of CIT/PCC was also investigated. 

The next step concerns the characterization of the obtained particles and posteriorly their 

application as coating pigment. The printing quality of the coated paper was evaluated. The 

behaviour of these particles used as paper filler with a content of 30% was also studied by the 

determination of paper properties. 

 

 

3.1  PCC modification with sodium citrate buffer 
 

This procedure is fairly simple and the reaction preparation starts by adding PCC (2 g) 

and ultrapure water (50 mL) in a 400 mL beaker. After, the mixture undergoes vigorous 

magnetic stirring with gradual heating up to 50 ºC. The citrate buffer 1M and pH 4.5 

(preparation process in Appendix A. II.) is added until the reaction pH reaches 5.5, measured 

at 50 ºC. The addition of the buffer must be done slowly and the amount needed is about 40 mL 

(~ 8.4 g of CIT). 

When the reaction conditions are reached, the mixture remains under stirring for 1h. 

After this time, the mixture is poured into falcon tubes to proceed the centrifugation step in the 

Hettich Universal 32 equipment. The centrifugation must be done for 20 minutes and at 4500 

rpm. This process should be repeated three times with two intermediated washes with distillate 

water. 

The obtained solid residue is after dried in the oven (Scientific series 9000) at 40 ºC 

until it is completely dry. Usually the drying stage requires one day, and to be more efficient 

the residue can be transferred to petri dishes, however some material may be lost. After, the 

dried material is grinded into a uniform dust and stored in a suitable recipient.

The industrial PCC used was provided by the research center RAIZ, and the reactants 

used were NaOH in pellets and CIT monohydrate. 

 

3.1.1 pH and Ratio CIT/PCC study 

 

To investigate the origin of the lamellar morphology with the use of SC buffer, some 

variables were changed from the reference procedure. Thus, there were four points in study: 

- The influence of the buffer’s pH and consequently the pH of the obtained 

suspension; 

- The CIT/PCC ratio; 

- The use of CIT in the absence of NaOH; 

- The use of GCC instead of the PCC in the original procedure. 

In order to have a better control of the CIT/PCC ratio, new protocols were created: 

- A solution of CIT (1M) were prepared and poured drop-to-drop into the PCC 

suspension. When the reaction conditions are reached the pH is measured at 50 ºC 

(Appendix A. IV); 

-  Two different solutions were prepared, CIT 1M and NaOH 1M, and then poured 

separately drop-by-drop into the PCC suspension, until the pretended ratio/pH is 

reached. After, the pH of the final suspension is measured at 50ºC. A detailed 

description of this procedure can be found in Appendix A. V. 

Therefore, the three procedures can be identified as: 

a) SC 1M added to the PCC suspension and obtained in two different ways: 

a.1) by using a solution of NaOH 0.1 M until a pH of 4.5 

a.2) by using pellets of NaOH until the required pH was reached 

b) Addition of CIT (1M) 

c) Addition of CIT (1M) and NaOH (1M) to the PCC suspension. 

Table 4 resumes the experiments that were made. The obtained particles were 

characterized posteriorly. For better understanding, the nomenclature of the obtained particles 

will be S (as sample) followed by its number, eg. S2.

After the reproduction of the reference protocol, the next objective was to test the 

influence of a citrate buffer with a high pH (S3). S4 was performing with the aim to test the 

influence of the absence of NaOH and lowering the CIT/PCC ratio, to produce a more economic 

compound. 

S5, S6 and S7, followed the same protocol. Though, in S5 the suspension was kept at 

pH 8 to a ratio of CIT/PCC half of the reference, to test once again the influence of pH in the 

final suspension. S6 and S7 were made to evaluate the CIT/PCC ratio, maintaining the same 

pH as the reference. 

To have a parallel with S5, the S8 experiment was made, where the starting protocol 

was the same as the reference. 

S9 was tested to evaluate which amount of CIT was needed to reach the pH 5.5 to further 

evaluate if that amount was the needed to form lamellar morphology. 

As in all the previous experiments the amount of citrate (or CIT) was in excess relatively 

to the amount of calcium carbonate, experiment 10 was made, in which stoichiometric amounts 

were used. 

To have an approach of the CIT pKa, the citrate buffer of S11 was prepared in order to 

have a pH of 6, corresponding to the realising of the 2nd proton of the acid (as study in Section 

2.5). The influence of other pKa were also tested in S3, and S4.  

Finally, the starting material was changed to GCC. S12 follows the same protocol as S2, 

and S13 has the same procedure as S10.

3.1.2 Characterization of the obtained particles 

 

The characterization step has the utmost importance since it can give a more detailed 

description about the particles that are being studied, and a comparison between the original 

and the modified particles can be made. For such purpose several techniques were used, such 

as Microscopy for particle visualization (size and shape), laser diffraction for particle size, Zeta 

Potential for surface charge and Thermogravimetric Analysis and Calcination for 

decomposition rates. 

 

 

 Optical Microscopy (OM) 

The optical microscope is an instrument that, with the help of a system of lenses, allows 

the magnification of small samples using visible light. This equipment consists of mechanical 

component and an optical component. The mechanic part supports and controls the optical part, 

and the latter promotes the images’ enlargement. This equipment can provide a first approach 

to the sample in study, giving an idea of its shape and size. 

The microscope used in this characterization was the Olympus BH2 and it was connected 

to a system with a camera (Color View III) and a digital programme (Analysis 5) through which 

the samples can be seen. 

Only the particles that apparently had a lamellar shape were chosen to continue with the 

characterization process. 

 

 

 Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) 

The principle of this technique is based on the emission of an electron beam, through 

magnetic lenses that bombards the surface of the dried conductive sample. As a result, 

secondary electrons are emitted from each point of the object and are captured by a detector. 

Thus, by the decoding of the energy emitted by the electrons, it is possible to reproduce virtual 

images of the sample’s surface. With this method, it is possible to understand some 

characteristics of the material as its size, its morphology and its topography (Dedavid, Gomes 

and Machado, 2007; Alyamani and Lemine, 2012). 

The tests were performed in the LED&amp;amp;MAT laboratory of the Instituto Pedro Nunes 

(IPN) and the equipment used was the Zeiss Gemini 2 Merlin Compact/VP Compact, Field 

Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy. The samples were placed into a carbon tape and 

identified. In this analysis the samples were not coated with gold, as it would normally be done. 



3.Materials and Methods

The aim of the coating is to help the conduction of the electrons and hence making possible to 

achieve an image with better resolution. There were obtained pictures with magnifications of 

20000x, 7500x and 3500x. To improve the sharpness and the definition of the obtained image, 

it was introduced an inert gas above the sample during its collection. 

With this analysis it was possible to confirm the real shape of the particles in study and 

only the particles with lamellar morphology were chosen to continue with the characterization 

stage.  

 

 

 Calcination at 900 ºC 

The calcination at 900 ºC has the aim of decomposing the inorganic material present in the 

samples, causing the degradation of CaCO3 into CaO, as described in Reaction 3.1. 

 

????3  ? ??? +??2 (3.1) 

 

This technique was used to chemically characterize the samples, since its composition is still 

unknown. The original PCC and the modified particles were placed in the oven until it reaches 

525 ºC to make sure that all the organics were decomposed. The weight was registered and the 

particles were placed once again in the oven for 14h up to 900 ºC. The protocol used followed 

the standard TAPPI 413. 

 

 

Thermogravimetric analysis/differential scanning calorimetry (TGA/DSC) 

This analysis allows the evaluation of the thermal stability of a sample and the amount 

of organic and inorganic parts present on it. The principle of TGA is related the weight changes 

in a sample as function of the temperature and time in a controlled atmosphere and the obtained 

results gives an idea of the material composition. The DSC is based on the measurement of the 

heat flow rate from a sample to obtain thermal critical points of the substances (Linseis, 2012a, 

2012b). The equipment used was a TA Instruments SDTQ600, and approximately 10g of each 

sample were added to the pan and submitted to a 10 ºC/min heating rate, from room temperature 

to 900 ºC.

 Laser Diffraction Spectrometry (LDS) 

The aim of this technique is to measure the particle size distribution of the sample. The 

operation method consists in passing the particles through a focus laser beam. The light is 

scattered by the dispersed particles at an angle that is inversely proportional to their size and 

photosensitive detectors measure its angular intensity. Knowing the material’s refraction index 

and the dispersing medium, it is possible to convert the diffraction pattern into the size 

distribution, with the Lorenz-Mie theory. However, even though the particles may present 

irregular shapes, the LDS considers that the particles have spherical shape, defining the results 

as equivalent spherical diameter. 

For the LDS measurement, the sample needs to be previously prepared. For that, a 

suspension of 1wt% of the material is made, where about three drops of dispersing agent 

(ammonium polycarbonate 6 % (v/v), Targon® 1128) was added before adding the water. The 

suspension was subjected to magnetic stirring for 20 minutes and then placed in a sonication 

bath (50 kHz) for 15 minutes. After this time, the measurement can be done by adding a small 

volume of the suspension to a 700 mL of water in the equipment vessel until reaching an 

obscuration around 10 – 20%. The measurement was carried out under stirring (2000 rpm). 

The analysis was done in the Malvern Instruments’ Mastersizer 2000 that allows the 

measurement of particle sizes between 0.02 and 2000 µm. 

 

 

Electrophoretic Light Scattering (ELS) 

The ELS allows the measurement of the surface charge of the particles in an aqueous 

medium. In this technique, the particles in suspension are subjected to an electric field that 

makes them move with a velocity related with their zeta potential (?). This value is a measure 

of the attraction-repulsion magnitude between the particles. A higher potential zeta represents 

a higher stability of the suspension. Charged particles repel themselves and this prevents the 

natural tendency of aggregation between particles. 

The sample needs to be prepared before its analysis, with a similar protocol used in the 

LDS. However, the dispersant agent is not added and the suspension here is about 0.1 wt% to 

obtain results of good quality. 

To perform this analysis, a Malvern Instruments’ Zetasizer Nano ZS was used, and the zeta 

potential was evaluated at the environmental room temperature with an equilibrium time of 120 

seconds.

3.2  Coating and Printing Quality 
 

After the characterization, the modified PCC particles were applied as coating pigment 

over printing and writing paper produced from a bleached Kraft pulp from Eucaliptus Globulus, 

with a basis weight of 80 g/m2 – namely paper base (PB). The coating properties and printing 

quality were evaluated in RAIZ.  

 

3.2.1 Coating Process 

The coating suspension is made with cationic starch (12 wt%) previously prepared 

(Appendix B. I.), the modified PCC particles, a few drops of dispersing agent and a small 

amount of water.  

The suspension had the formulation described in Table 5. 

 

Table 5. Formulation of the coating suspension 

Additives Quantity (g) 

Starch suspension (12 wt%) 12.5 

PCC 3 

Dispersing agent (Targon ®) 0.25 

Water 2 – 4 mL 

 

To prepare the coating suspension, the PCC particles are inserted in a beaker, and then 

drops of dispersant are added. After, the water must be added drop-by-drop while the operator 

blends the mixture with a stirring rod until a paste is formed. This mixture should not be too 

fluid. The next step is the addition of the starch suspension. The final suspension must be stirred 

magnetically until a uniform mixture is obtained. 

To perform the coating stage, 5 mL of the suspension are taken from the beaker with a 

plastic syringe and then poured along the applicator rod of the bench coating equipment. The 

coating equipment is a Mathis SVA-IR-B, which operates at different speeds of the applicator 

rod. The rod used was smooth with a diameter of 0.15 mm. 

The drying process of the coated papers is divided in two stages: first, the IR-dryer dries 

the coating layer at the same time as it is done, and then the coated paper is exposed to the room 

air for some time.

The formulation and the process used are the same for the modified particles. There were 

made at least two duplicates for each type of particles. The coated papers were cut into an A4 

sheet and the ‘pick-up’ was determined in RAIZ. 

 

 

3.2.2 Coating Properties 

After the ‘pick-up’ determination, two properties of the coated paper were evaluated: its 

air permeability and roughness. The air permeability was done by the Gurley’s method (ISO 

5636-5), in which the time that takes 100 mL of air flow to pass through the paper sheet is 

measured, using the Gurley SE 121 equipment. The Bendsten method (ISO 8791-2) was used 

to measure the air flow that passes in between a circular head and the paper surface, giving in 

this way the roughness of the paper. This test was performed in the equipment L&amp;amp;W Bendtsen. 

 

 

3.2.3 Printing Quality 

To perform the printing quality analysis, a test mask (Figure 9) was printed in each of the 

coated paper. This was made with a HP PhotoSmart B8850-IJTarget 13 in its best printing 

quality mode. To evaluate the quality parameters, the spectrophotometers X-Rite i1 and QEA 

PIASII were used (Figure 9). 

The optical density of the colours black, magenta, cyan, and yellow was measured with the 

X-Rite i1 to determine the gamut area and volume. The print-through and show-through was 

also calculated with the help of this equipment. 

The QEA PIASII was used to determine the line raggedness, the black and white feathering, 

and colour-to-colour bleed.

3.2.4 Coating characterization 

After the printing quality analysis, the coated papers with the highest values of gamut area 

were analysed by image analysis SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope). The resulting images 

from this technique result from a scan made by a beam of electron to the samples’ surface. The 

electrons interact with the atoms of the sample, sending back signals with information of the 

topography of the sample. 

The analysis was performed in University of Aveiro in the equipment Hitachi (S4100) at 

15 kV, with double deposition of carbon.  

 

 

3.3 Paper Testing 
 

After the modification of the PCC particles and their characterization, besides the testing 

as coating pigment, they were also used as paper filler. For that, there were made handsheets 

and later their characterization. These procedures were performed in RAIZ, where it is available 

all the needed equipment. 

 

3.3.1 Production of Handsheets 

Before the sheets production, the first thing to do is to prepare the raw material and the 

additives needed to the production of P&amp;amp;W paper. The fiber used was previously refined in a 

conical refiner and having a Schopper-Riegle of 32. 

In order to reduce the loss of additives during the paper formation, an aqueous solution of 

a retention agent (0.025 wt%) was used: cationic polyacrylamide (CPAM) with the commercial 

name Percol®. The sizing agent used was the alkenyl succinic anhydride (ASA) that was later 

added to a starch suspension 2.5% (wt%). Finally, an aqueous suspension (1 wt%) with the 

mineral loading was made. The procedures of these suspensions can be found in Appendix C. 

I – III. 

The mixing of the enumerated compounds has to comply with the mixing times that are 

previously established. Those times can be found in Table 6 as well as the amount of fiber and 

additives needed to obtain a sheet with a weight of 1.6 g and a grammage of 80 g/m2. To 

accomplish this task, an adequate equipment is needed, the batch handsheet former MARVI 

(model 255/SA). 

All the protocols related with the sheets formation, pressing and conditioning are described 

in Appendix D.

3.3.2 Handsheets Characterization  

The paper characterization was made after its drying in the paper testing room. The room 

conditions follow the ISO 187 that establishes constant temperature and humidity, 23 ºC± 1 

and 50% ± 2%, respectively.  

First, non-destructive properties are evaluated, such as optical and mechanical properties. 

After, the sheets are cut following the standard ISO 5269/1, to proceed with the structural tests. 

Table 7 has a description of the equipment and its respective standard used to determine the 

optical, structural and mechanic properties of the handsheets.

3.3.3 Filler retention 

After the sheets formation, it is necessary to know the amount of effective filler that was 

present in the paper. For that, the formed sheets were calcined at 525 ºC, for16h as described in 

the standard TAPPI 211. During this procedure, the organic matter of a certain amount of paper 

is decomposed remaining at the end only the inorganics. After this determination, it was 

possible to calculate the filler that was retained in each sheet. This procedure was made in 

duplicate to each kind of sheets with different fillers.

4 Results and Discussion 
 

In this section, the results obtained by the characterization techniques described in Chapter 

3 will be analysed and discussed. The order of presentation will be the same as previously 

presented: first, an approach to the characterization of the original PCC and the modified 

particles will be made, and subsequently an evaluation of their effect as coating pigment and as 

paper filler. 

 

4.1. Particles Characterization 

 

The characterization of the original PCC and the modified particles was made in order to 

know their morphology, composition, size and surface charge. 

 

4.1.1 Morphology 

 

Optical Microscopy 

The first attempting approach to analyse the morphology of the materials that were 

modified was made with the help of an optical microscope. Besides the low definition of the 

pictures, the particle’s morphology can be noticed. In Table 8 are resumed the obtained 

morphologies for each reaction and the correspondent pictures can be found in Appendix E. I. 

The sample obtained by Carecho (2016) will be taken as reference (S0, Figure 10) to 

evaluate the morphology of the particles posteriorly produced. Thus, it is possible to observed 

that lamellar shapes were obtained in the samples S1, S2 (Figure 10), S4, S9, S10, S11, S12, 

S13. However, the size of the particles is different from one another. S4, S9, S11, S13 presented 

a smaller dimension when compared with S0. The samples S6 and S7 present a higher aspect 

ratio and a morphology of what appears to be needle-type. S8 showed some lamellar particles, 

but it also had a high number of spherical particles. S3 and S5 showed to have spherical 

morphology. 

The reactions of the particles presented in Figure 10 have the same protocol in terms of 

reaction conditions, although there were made some modifications in the process logistic. In S0 

it was used mechanical stirring with the use of a blade agitator, while S2 undergo magnetic 

stirring. This can explain the broken aspect noticed in S0, compared with S2.

The influence of the pH is very noticeable in this analysis. It can be pointed out that the 

CIT/PCC ratio is an important factor, since it influences the pH of the final suspension. Thus, 

this parameter is determinant in the formation of lamellar morphology. Suspensions with high 

pH (&gt; 8) resulted in particles with spherical shape. The lamellar morphology is obtained at pH 

5.5, and the CIT/PCC ratio can be adjusted depending on the protocol used.

In the absence of NaOH, particles with lamellar morphology are also formed but for 

CIT/PCC &gt; 1.5 it is noticeable a high size reduction. This can indicate that the solution of CIT 

is degrading the particles of PCC. 

To proceed with the characterization stage, the particles with spherical morphology were 

discarded, as well as lamellar particles with small size. Also, since S6 and S7 were performed 

with the same protocol and presented the same morphology, the one that had higher CIT/PCC 

ratio was also discarded. 

Thus, the particles selected were S2 (reproduction of the reaction made by Carecho (2016)), 

S6 (from the new protocol but with lower CIT/PCC ratio and the same pH as S2), S10 

(stoichiometric CIT/PCC ratio) and S12 (same protocol as S2 however, instead using PCC, 

GCC was used) and these were analysed by FESEM. 

 

 

Reaction behaviour 

To perform the coating and paper application there were produced more particles from the 

chosen samples. The yield of each reaction was calculated taking into account the amount of 

solids added in the beginning of the reactions and the obtained dried solid content. It can be 

found in Appendix E. II. The yield of the process varies mostly because of the centrifugation 

step, since in this stage there is high weight loss during the washing step.   

With the new replicas of the reaction, it was noticed that the effective ratio of S12 is less 

the 6.3; the CIT/PCC ratio is in fact ca. 4. This means that the stirring must be vigorous to 

optimize the interaction between the reactants. 

Carecho (2016) reported that when the SC is being added and the suspension reaches pH 

6, there is a colour change of the mixture (from white to transparent), meaning its dissolution. 

After ca. 10 minutes the suspension precipitates and the original white colour appears. The 

same phenomenon was observed during these experimental procedures, but only when protocol 

a) was used, even when the starting material is GCC. However, since the lamellar morphology 

was originated with the other protocols, this phenomenon may not be an important factor to 

obtain the desired modification.  

 

 

 

 

 

 



4.Results and Discussion 

41 

 

FESEM 

To take a closer look on the particles morphology, the selected particles were subjected to 

FESEM analyses. To have a comparative image (Figure 11 a)), the research group provided to 

this work the SEM pictures of the original PCC. As it is possible to see, the original PCC used 

has a rosette morphology, characteristic of scalenohedral PCC. The modifications to this PCC 

resulted in lamellar particles, as expected. Figure 12 show the obtained modified particles S2, 

S6, S10 and S12 with magnification of 20 000x. The low definition of the pictures is due to the 

lack of particle coating with gold when the FESEM analysis was made. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It is possible to observe the sharpness of lamellar particles S2 (a). S6 and S10 ((b) and c)) 

present also lamellar morphology although with higher aspect ratio. 

The modified GCC (S12) can be compared with the SEM images (Figure 11 b)) of the 

GCC used by Sequeira (2014), the same starting material used in this work. The original GCC 

has a rhombohedral morphology and from the modification with the citrate buffer resulted 

particles with sharped edges, and a more platy structure. 

Appendix E. III. contains images of the modified particles with other magnifications. 

There, it is revealed an unevenness of particle size distribution. Also, it can be seen that for 

S12, not all the particles presented sharp edges; some particles have rounded morphology 

similar to a coin. In the same appendix, the SEM images of S4 and S11 are also presented. The 

images confirm the lamellar morphology of S4, and it is notorious the low dimension of the 

particles, meaning that the action of CIT itself forms lamellar shapes but also disrupt them. On 

the other hand, S11 analysis show scalenohedral morphology, meaning that the optical 

microscopy analysis was not very accurate. These images reinforce the importance of the pH 

of the final suspension into the modification morphology – in a low pH lamellae are formed, 

but the aspect ratio of que particles is low; a high pH do not contribute to lamellae formation.

4.1.2 Thermogravimetric analysis  

To better understand the chemical composition of the modified particles, the samples were 

investigated by thermogravimetric analysis.  

The thermogram of the original PCC was provided by the research group and can be seen 

in Figure 13. The weight loss of the original PCC is about 43% (in the range of temperatures 

between 580 and 900 ºC) which corresponds to about 97 wt% of CaCO3. The weight loss of ca. 

3% is related to the impurities that the PCC may contain.  

The TGA curves of the modified particles can be seen in Figure 14. The results presented 

are normalized, since the first approach revealed high percentage of water in the samples 

(Appendix F. IV). For this reason, the curves were changed in order to remove the highest 

percentage of water from the given weight loss values.

It is notorious that the thermograms of the modified particles are not similar to the one 

presented for the original PCC. 

The complexity of the thermal behaviour of these particles can be noticed by the number 

of weight loss steps that exists from 105 ºC to 900 ºC. In the literature review (Section 2.), it 

was described that some authors studied the reaction of calcium carbonate with citrate resulting 

??3(?6?5?7)2 ? 4?2? as reaction product. The TGA curves of the modified particles are 

similar to those presented by Zhou et al. (1998) and Radfarnia and Iliuta (2013), suggesting 

that the resulted particles are actually composed by calcium citrate.

Mansour (1994) reported the reactions related to each step of the curve. Having in mind 

that some percentage of water was already released, the steps can be described as: 

- Stage I, from 105ºC to 380 ºC: the steps of weight loss are related to the release of water 

molecules from ??3(?6?5?7)2 ? 4?2?. It is also referred the melting of this compound at 

temperatures near 230 ºC. 

 

??3(?6?5?7)2 ? 4?2? ? ??3(?6?5?7)2 ? 2?2? ? ??3(?6?5?7)2 (4.1) 

 

- Stage II, from 380 ºC to 570 ºC: decomposition of calcium citrate into intermediate 

compounds such as calcium aconitate [??3(?6?3?6)2] and CaCO3, as well as some gases like 

CO and CH4.

- Stage IV, temperatures higher than 800 ºC: all carbon produced is burned off. 

Table 9 compiles the weight loss in each stage. It can be highlighted that, as its 

thermograms, S2 and S10, present similar behaviour. 

Table 10 presents the amount of calcium citrate and CaCO3 presented in the samples. The 

samples revealed to be in its majority composed by calcium citrate (65 – 52%), and ca. 24 – 

38% of CaCO3. Also there are some unidentified compounds contained in the samples. These 

values were obtained considering the weight used to measure the TGA and the stoichiometric 

coefficients presented in Reactions 4.1 – 4.3.

4.1.3 Calcination  

The calcination stage was made to quantify the inorganic material that exists in the samples. 

The reaction that occurs in this process is favoured by high temperatures. The particles were 

subjected to temperatures up to 900 ºC to make sure that all the calcium carbonate is 

decomposed in CaO and CO2. This method is not very accurate, since the weight loss is 

determined by weighing after cooling in the desiccator, allowing a small percentage of the air 

humidity to be absorbed into the particles. For this reason, duplicates were made and then an 

average value was determined. 

Table 11 shows the obtained percentage of weight presented in the temperature intervals 

in the calcination process and the percentage of CaCO3 in the particles. However, this

percentage is not obtained in the same way for all particles. As said in Section 2, the performed 

reactions form a complex calcium-CIT, so it cannot be treated as pure CaCO3. Mansour (1994) 

reported the decomposition of calcium citrate up to 900 ºC, and described several step 

decomposition reaction – also presented in the Section 4.1.2. Therefore, the percentage of 

CaCO3 in the modified particles is calculated taking into account the reactions stoichiometric 

coefficients, as illustrated in Equation 4.1.: 

 

??3(?6?5?7)2  
? (105?525 ?)
?          2 ????3  

? (525?900 ?)
?           3 ??? (4.4) 

 

 

The degradation of CaCO3 occurs from 570 ºC to 800 ºC, so the calculations for the original 

PCC and the modified particles follow these equations: 

- Original PCC:  

% (? ?) ????3 = [?????? ???? (525 °? ?900 °?)]×
100.1

44
?  (4.1) 

 

Where 100.1 g/mol is the molecular weight of CaCO3 and 44 g/mol the molecular weight 

of CO2. 

 

- Modified Particles: 

% (? ?) ????3 = [?????? ???? (525 °? ?900 °?)]×
2 ×100.1

3 ×56
?  (4.2) 

 

Where 100.1 g/mol is the molecular weight of CaCO3, 56 g/mol the molecular weight of 

CaO, and 2 and 3 the respective stoichiometric coefficients, as presented by the reactions 4.1 – 

4.3.  

It is possible to see that the modified particles lose more than half of its weight during this 

process. The major weight loss observed for these particles is in the interval of temperatures 

105 ºC – 525 ºC. These values correspond probably to the degradation of the calcium citrate 

and other compounds formed in each reaction. The modified samples only have about 38 – 22% 

of CaCO3 in their composition (similar to those values obtained with the thermogravimetric 

analysis), meaning that the remain percentage corresponds to those same compounds. The 

amount of calcium citrate was not calculated using the same approach since the degradation of 

the complex at high temperatures is more complex than the one that happens in PCC.

The original PCC only loses ca. 3% of its weight in the same range of temperatures, which 

can indicate the presence of impurities, probably due to its fabrication process (Gamelas, 

Lourenço and Ferreira, 2011).  

 

 

4.1.4 Laser Diffraction Spectrometry 

To know the size of the modified particles and compare it with the original PCC, the LDS 

technique was performed. This method is only used to make a comparison between particles, 

since the measurement in the equipment is given in terms of diameter, considering the particles 

as spheres. For each sample, two measurements were made and the values presented are an 

average of the obtained ones. 

Figure 15 shows the size distribution of the particles in study. For S2, S6 and S10 (a), b) 

and c)), the comparison was made having into account the starting material used. For S12 (d), 

this comparison was not made since the starting material of this reaction was not characterized. 

However, in a future work this characterization should be made. For comparison between the 

modified and the original GCC, it will be taken as reference the result from Sequeira (2014).

The sized distribution of the PCC particles has a bimodal behaviour. Besides the use of a 

particles dispersant, stables aggregates are formed. Thus, the first peak corresponds to the range 

of sizes of the individual particles and the second one is related with the stable aggregates 

formed. The modified particles do not have the same kind of distribution as the PCC, with 

exception of S2, and the volume fraction needed for their analysis is less than the needed for 

PCC. It is possible to observe that the modified particles are smaller than the PCC.  

The behaviour of S6 is not clear, as it has three distinct peaks, and the highest one 

corresponds to a majority of particles with diameter higher than 10 ?m. S10 and S12 have two 

distinct peaks in the range of particles diameter of 1 ?m and 10 ?m. Sequeira (2014) reported 

that the original GCC has a unimodal distribution, which is different from the modified sample 

S12.   

To better understand the dimension of the particles, Table 12 presents the range of the 

particle sizes in the different samples.

S6 0.98 6.36 55.8 

S10 0.64 3.54 11.1 

S12 0.95 3.77 12.0 

 

As it was observed by the SEM images, S6 has particles with very different sizes. This is 

corroborated with the behaviour of the size distribution and, as it is possible to observe above, 

the sizes range from 0.98 to 55.8 ?m. This can be justified with the experimental protocol used 

in this reaction: to lower the pH of the suspension, the PCC particles are first in contact with 

CIT (low pH) which promotes its deconstruction, and thus forming small particles sizes. As the 

pH stabilizes and the NaOH is added, this effect stops. The presence of the NaOH solution 

probably contributes to the elongation of these particles. Also the use of dispersant may not be 

sufficient to prevent the formation of aggregates with high dimensions, giving the size 

distribution a trimodal behaviour. 

S10 is formed by the addition of CIT in stoichiometric ratio to the PCC (1.4). The same 

phenomena happen with regard to the deconstruction of the PCC, which justify the high peak 

the in fines zone.  



4.Results and Discussion 

49 

 

The sample S12 is formed with GCC as starting material with the same protocol used in 

S2, and when these two samples are compared, it can be pointed out that there size is similar. 

Although, the peak of fines is higher for S12. The dp50 of the original GCC is about 2.1 µm 

(Sequeira, 2014),  showing that the modification process increased its particle size. 

During the measurement of S12, a high amount of the suspension was needed to reach the 

desired obscuration index. The suspension seemed to dissolve in the 700 mL of water used to 

perform the analysis. Further studies will be needed to understand the behaviour presented by 

these particles.  

 

 

4.1.5 Electrophoretic Light Scattering 

The zeta potential is important to analyse the electrostatic bonding between the particles. 

Table 13 presents the results obtained for each sample. To do this test, three measurements were 

performed with the same suspension and the presented values are an average. 

 

Table 13. Zeta potential values 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

As it can be noticed, the zeta potential of the modified particles is negative. This can 

indicate that the suspensions have basic conditions. Values of zeta potential of calcium citrate 

cannot be found in the literature to use as comparative parameter. Though this superficial charge 

changes only happen for PCC. GCC particles have zeta potential of -29 mV (Sequeira, 2014) 

and its modified particles (S12) have -40 mV, revealing an increase of the particle stability. S2, 

S6 and S10 are located below the stability zone (that is in between ±30 and ±40, as reported by 

Chernyaev and Enberg (2015)), which may induce particle aggregation.  

For filler application, this negative value is not favourable for its bounding with the fibers. 

Besides its effect being attenuated with the use of cationic starch, an appropriated retention 

agent should be used to prevent the loss of filler content in the paper. Lourenço et al. (2013) 

indicates CPAM as the indicated retention agent to be used in the application of these particles 

as paper fillers.

4.2 Coating and Printing Quality 
 

After the characterization process, the next step is to test the modified particles as paper 

coating pigment. The coating process is described in section 3.2. 

Before going through the coating process itself, to better understand which amount of PCC 

(and posteriorly, of modified particles) is the most suitable to use in this step, coating tests with 

different ratios starch/PCC were made. The base paper was coated with three different 

starch/PCC ratios: 1/1, 2/1 and 3/1. The pick-up (difference between the basis weight of the 

uncoated and coated paper) of the samples was measured, as well as its air permeability and 

roughness. These results can be found in Appendix F II. The air permeability and the roughness 

are similar between the three samples. The pick-up increased with the starch/PCC ratio. The 

ratio 2/1 was found to be the most appropriated to proceed with the coating process, obtaining 

a pick-up of 5.5. 

 

4.2.1 Coating Properties 

After the preliminary tests, sheets of base paper were coated with the modified particles. 

The solid content of the suspensions used in each sample is about 24 to 26 wt% (a detailed 

description is presented in Appendix F. II.). For each essay, there were made duplicates and, 

for the modified particles there were also made replicas. 

Before evaluating the printing quality of the coated papers, their pick-up, air permeability 

and roughness were measured and the results are organized in Table 14. For better 

understanding, the nomenclature of these samples will be: paper (P) followed by the sample’s 

name, eg. P-S2. The base paper (BP), paper coated only with a starch suspension (P-Starch) 

and paper coated with a suspension of PCC particles (P-PCC) where used as references. 

The results of pick-up vs Gurley and pick-up vs roughness are plotted in Figure 16. As it 

can be seen, the points are too dispersed and there is no linear tendency between the obtained 

pick-up and the air permeability, as well as the roughness. Although, for P-S2 and P-S6 it is 

clear that the air permeability increases with the pick-up. In this point, it can be highlighted that 

for P-S2 with high pick-up, the Gurley test was performed with 50cc due to the long time that 

was taken to be measured with 100cc. This means that a high pick-up decreases the paper 

porosity, thus hampering the passage of air. Also, the roughness values for S-P10 and S-P12 

show a slightly tendency to increase with the pick-up.

4.2.2  Printing Quality 

To evaluate the printing quality, a test mask was printed in each coated paper, and then 

several parameters were evaluated, such as gamut area and volume, optical density (of cyan, 

magenta, yellow, and black), print-through, colour-to-colour bleeding among others. 

Gamut area and volume values are presented in Table 14. It is possible to see that some of 

the obtained values are near or higher to those from the base paper. In P-S2 and P-S6 there were 

obtained values for gamut area higher than 7000. For the same samples the values of gamut 

volume are also higher. This shows improvements in printing quality when compared with the 

uncoated paper. However, the replicas for these samples present lower gamut area. This can be 

explained not only by the difference between the pick-up values, but also by the environmental 

changes that may have happened when the replicas where made. Thus, to avoid modifications 

in the rheology of the coating suspension, but also fluctuations during the drying stage, the 

coating process should be performed under controlled environment. 

The gamut area of P-S10 and P-S12 is lower than the one of the base paper. Besides this 

fact, P-S10 shows better results than P-Starch and P-PCC, which means that these coating 

particles may also lead to improvement of the printing quality. 

As referred, one of the aspects that can influence the printing quality is the pick-up. As 

plotted in Figure 17 the gamut area of the coated papers P-S2, P-S6, and P-S10 increases with 

the pick-up. For P-S12 there is no possible conclusion, since the gamut area values are not 

influenced by the pick-up.

The gamut volume increases with the pick-up for P-S2 and P-S6, as shown in Figure 18. 

This might be due to the highest optical density of the black colour presented by these paper 

samples. The remaining samples have lower optical density of the black colour. However, when 

compared with the base paper, P-S10 shows a slightly improvement. 

The optical density of the black and yellow shows also higher values for P-S2 and P-S6, 

when compared with the base paper. The cyan density is slightly lower than the base paper. 

However, these two samples show greater results for this property. Relatively to the samples P-

S10 and P-S12 the optical density of the colours does not show improvements when compared 

with the base paper. 

The properties of print-through, show-through, black and white (B&amp;amp;W) feathering, and 

colour-to-colour bleed are compiled in the Table 15. 

In the analysis of print and show-though properties it is clear that the presented values are 

lowered then the ones obtained for PB showing improvements of these parameters when the 

paper is coated with the modified particles. Compared with the PB, only P-PCC shows higher 

values of print and show-through, meaning that the ink is more likely to penetrate in the paper 

when coated with PCC particles than with the modified particles.

The B&amp;amp;W feathering analysis is not that clear, since some papers show improvements 

while others do not, when compared with PB. However, taking a closer look between samples 

(Figure 19), the values also vary with the pick-up, showing one more time that the control of 

the pick-up during the coating process is an important factor. P-S6, P-S10, and P-S12 show that 

the feathering effect of the line decreases with the increasing of the pick-up. From the analysis 

of P-S2, there is no correlation to be highlighted.

The colour bleeding is divided in two parameters, the width (W) and raggedness (R) of the 

line, that are related with the ink absorption into the paper. However, the pick-up does not seem 

to influence this property. The ink absorption depends on the pigments coating characteristics, 

which can increase the drying time. The low capacity of absorption increases the probability of 

the bleeding phenomena to occur. Thus, from the obtained results, it can be pointed out that the 

modified coating pigments, in their majority, improve this characteristic when a comparison 

with BP and P-PCC is made. 

Another aspect to take into account when the printing quality is being evaluated is the 

circularity of the black and magenta dots that were printed in the mask. The obtained results are 

present Table 16. Once again, there is no correlation of the point circularity and the pick-up of 

the sheets. For this reason, the average values of circularity and colour-to-colour bleed are 

compared in Table 17. It is noticed that the values improve in the coated papers and those with 

lower colour-to-colour bleed have also lower circularity. The circularity of magenta dots is 

improved for P-S2, P-S6 and P-S10, though P-Starch and P-PCC show better definition of these 

dots. 

To sum up the overall obtained results, the printing quality of the coated paper is improved 

by the modified particles. High values of gamut area and volume were obtained for P-S2 and 

P-S6. Also, these samples revealed high optical density of CMYK colours. These results are 

correlated with the pick-up obtained, meaning that this parameter must be adjusted for the 

improvement of printing quality. The print and show-through capacity were also measured and 

the papers coated with the modified particles had these parameters decreased. 

In regard to line quality, B&amp;amp;W feathering decreases with the increasing of the pick-up for 

P-S6, P-S10 and P-S12. Also, the colour-bleeding parameter is improved by the coating with 

the modified particles. 

The black and magenta dots have higher definition in P-S2 and P-S12. P-S10 only showed 

improvements for magenta dots. 

There are some aspects that can influence the obtained results, such as the environment 

conditions, as referred. Also, the coating equipment was adjusted between essays. This can be 

the cause of the differences found in the replicas of P-S2 and P-S6.

4.2.3 Coating characterization 

To understand what went wrong with coating replicas, especially P-S2 and P-S6 (with the 

highest gamut values) the coated paper was analysed by SEM. Figure 20 shows the first attempt 

of coating paper with the particles S2 and its replica. It is noticed that the particles of the replica 

have different morphology, meaning that something went wrong with the reaction process, 

causing the decrease of the gamut area. Figure 21 shows the base paper coated with particles 

S6, revealing the lamellar shape of the particles.  The coated paper matrix for each sample is 

presented in Figure 22. It is notorious that the particles cover most of the paper matrix, and P-

S2 had a denser coverage than P-S6, justifying the high pick-up obtained for P-S2. 

 However more replicas are needed to prove that these particles, made with citrate buffer, 

can really improve the printing quality of the papers.

4.3 Paper testing 
 

After testing the modified particles as pigment coating, the next step was to use it as paper 

filler. The sheets formation was performed in RAIZ as well as its posterior characterization. 

The evaluation of the loading content in each sheet was evaluated in DEQ. 

 

4.3.1  Handsheets Characterization 

 

Filler Retention 

The mineral loading of the produced handsheets was determined following the standard 

TAPPI 211, and the content and percentage of retention was calculated by the Equations 4.3 

and 4.4, respectively. 

 

?????? ??????? (??%) = 
??? ?????? ?? 525 °?

?????? ?? ????? ?? 105 °?
 ×100 (4.3) 

 

% ?????? ????????? = 
?????? ??????? (??%) 

??? ????? (??%)
 (4.4) 

 

The retention values are presented in Table 18. For better understanding, the nomenclature 

of the fillers will be: sheet (S) following the modified particle used as filler, eg. S-S2. The 

reference will be named as S-PCC for the sheet with PCC filler and a basis weight of 80g/m2. 

As it is noticed, the sheets with the modified particles have lower percentage of retention. For 

this reason, and to make a better comparison between sheet samples, another sheet reference 

was produced with PCC filler, though with an average basis weight comparable to those 

produced with the modified fillers. This sample will be named S-PCC1. 

The target filler content in the sheets was 30 wt% and as it can be seen, only the PCC 

particles reached approximately that value. 

The retention is related with the entanglement of the filler with the fibers, and usually 

CPAM promotes filler retention. The connection between the fibres and PCC is due to their 

opposite charges: fibres have negative charge and PCC, has positive charge, as seen previously. 

The attraction between the PCC particles and the fibers is improved with CPAM.

The modified particles present (high) negative surface charge and it is expected that the 

affinity towards the fiber decreases, leading to low retention values. Actually, this can be seen 

in Figure 23, where it is plotted a linear correlation between the zeta potential of the modified 

particles (Table 13) and the filler content values. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Although Lourenço et al. (2013) had reported that the efficiency of CPAM with highly 

negative charged particles, the same was not observed in this study. This means that the amount 

of CPAM may not be sufficient to compensate the particle charge in order to create bonds with 

the fibers. Also, CPAM may not be the adequate retention agent to use on these modified 

particles. This aspect requires further studies to evaluate what can be altered in order to increase 

the mineral loading retention, namely flocculation studies by LDS using only the modified 

particles and a polyelectrolyte.

Paper properties  

After the evaluation of the filler retention, the paper properties were evaluated. In Table 19 

the results of each property associated with each kind of filler used, are presented. 

As it was expected, the grammage of the sheets with the modified samples decreases with 

the filler content in the sheets. The bulk and permeability properties follow the same behaviour. 

In comparison with the references, for the sheets with modified filler, the bulk decreases and 

the air resistance increases. This is due to the lower mineral content in the sheets, increasing 

fiber bounding and thus closing the paper matrix.  

 The roughness of the paper with the modified fillers is also lower than the references, 

however S-S6 presents a higher value for this property. This is probably due to the large 

agglomerates present in the particles sample. Comparing the remaining samples, the roughness 

decreases with the increasing of the filler content, most certainly because the mineral particles 

fill some of the surface pours. On the other hand, it is too soon to predict if these modified 

particles contribute to smooth the paper’s surface. 

The optical properties are related with the interaction of the light with the paper 

constituents, such as fiber and mineral loading. The fiber refining is a factor to take into account 

when these properties are evaluated. However, the refining degree is the same in all the sheets 

in study. Thus, the optical properties are strongly dependent on the filler content. It is noticed 

(Figure 24 and Table 19) that the sheets with the modified fillers present lower values for 

opacity and light scattering when compared with the reference S-PCC1. The brightness values 

present the same tendency, however S-S6 has the same value as S-PCC.

The opacity, brightness and light scattering have some tendency to increase with the filler 

content. This is normal, since the light has more obstacles to be dispersed. Figure 25 shows a 

linear correlation between opacity and light scattering, which is also in agreement with the trend 

of light scattering with grammage (Figure 26), reinforcing the influence of the filler content 

with these properties.

5.Conclusions 

 

65 

 

The mechanical properties increase for the modified particles relatively to the reference 

PCC-1. This is due to the low filler content of the sheets with the modified filler which increases 

the fiber-to-fiber bounding. The filler content of PCC-1 is higher, decreasing the bounding 

between fibers, and thus being less resistance to mechanical tests.  

Although, S-S2 has not the lowest filler content but has the highest values for mechanical 

properties. This can be related to the lamellar morphology that, once again, increases the filler-

to-fiber bounding. 

The tensile strength and the tear resistance have the same behaviour, when compared 

between the modified samples. As shown in Figure 27, the tensile and burst strength have a 

linear correlation, as it was expected. 

 

 

Figure 27. Tensile Strength vs Burst Strength 

 

To sum up, all the properties are dependent on the filler content of the sheets. Compared 

with the S-PCC1, the modified particles formed a less permeable sheet, and the roughness was 

decreased. The optical properties are also disturbed with the use of the modified fillers. The 

mechanical properties increased due to the low filler content. Although S-S2 have the highest 

values for these properties, maybe due to the lamellar morphology of the particles. In fact, when 

comparing with S-S12, which has a much lower filler content, the tensile strength is similar to 

the one of S-S2.  Replicas are needed to really make sure which are the paper properties that 

will improve with the use these modified fillers.

5.Conclusions

5 Conclusions 
 

A discover made by Carecho (2016) where a lamellar morphology, interesting from a 

papermaking point of view, was obtained from the mixture between scalenohedral PCC with 

citrate buffer, leading to the present dissertation. Thus the aim of this work consisted in the 

study and optimization of the reaction between PCC and citrate buffer to understand how the 

lamellar morphology was obtained, and its posterior application as paper coating pigment to 

evaluate printing quality, as well as its application as paper filler.  

A preliminary research, where the influence of the citrate buffer pH and CIT/PCC ratio at 

50 ºC was studied, indicates that the CIT/PCC ratio is a crucial parameter to the formation of 

the mentioned particles. The CIT/PCC ratio will influence the final suspension pH, revealing 

that this is also an important aspect to take into account to obtain lamellar particles. Thus, these 

particles are favourably formed at a CIT/PCC ratio ca. 4 and a final suspension with a pH 5.5. 

For better control of the CIT/PCC ratio during the experimental essays, it was created a new 

protocol, in which instead of the preparation of the sodium citrate buffer, two distinct solutions 

of CIT (1M) and NaOH (1M) were poured into the PCC suspension. The CIT/PCC ratio was 

decreased for 2, to obtain the same pH, which also resulted in lamellar particles although with 

higher aspect ratio. 

To test more economic solutions to obtain the same structure, the stoichiometric CIT/PCC 

ratio (1.4) was used with the absence of NaOH. The pH obtained in the final suspension was 

ca. 5, and lamellar morphology was also obtained. Other aspect was the use of GCC as starting 

material. The protocol used was the same as the one used in the first experiment, however the 

resulted particles presented platy-morphology. 

Thus, the lamellar morphology can be obtained at an optimum pH of 5.5 and the CIT/PCC 

ratio can be controlled, depending on the protocol used. Suspensions with low pH also show 

the formation of lamellar particles, though with lower aspect ratio; suspensions with high pH 

did lead to present lamellar particles. 

The thermal analysis (calcination and TGA up to 900 ºC) revealed that the particles in study 

are composed in its majority with calcium citrate and ca. 30% of CaCO3.Though there are some 

unidentified compounds that represent about 10% of the samples composition. These 

compounds can also be related to this radical modification of the scalenohedral PCC.  

LDS analyses revealed that the particle size decreased when compared with the starting 

material, except for the particles obtained by the modification of GCC that showed an increase 



 

 

68 
 

of particle size. The particles of modified PCC have a d50 of 3.30 – 3.50 µm. However, particles 

with higher aspect ratio seemed to form large aggregates. 

Relatively to the particle superficial charge, the PCC modified particles presented negative 

charge, outside of the stability zone. For the GCC modified particles this parameter showed to 

increase the suspension stability. 

After the characterization process, these particles were applied as coating pigments 

revealing promising results in printing quality. The PCC particles modified with citrate buffer 

revealed high values of optical density resulting in high values of gamut area in comparison 

with the base paper used for coating. The pick-up of these papers was about 7-9, which caused 

high air permeability. Though the same results were not obtained in replicas made posteriorly. 

These differences can be caused by fluctuation of the environmental conditions, which may 

alter the coating suspension properties and the drying conditions, changing in this way the 

coating surface. 

The application of the modified particles as paper fillers did not present good results due 

to their low retention in the paper matrix. The highly negative zeta values can be related with 

the filler content: the filler content increases with the particles superficial charge. This can 

reveal that the use of CPAM as a retention agent is not efficient. The paper properties were 

evaluated with a reference paper with PCC filler with a similar grammage to those obtained 

with the use of the modified fillers. These properties are strongly dependent of the filler content 

in the sheets, and thus the mechanical properties increased relatively to the reference. However, 

it is noticed an improvement of these properties when lamellar particles are used as filler. As 

expected, the optical properties decreased. The air permeability increased due to the lack of 

filler, allowing the fibers to form a closer matrix. Thus, there is no conclusions to be taken from 

these tests. 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 



6. Future Work

6 Future Work 
 

In a future work, the next step to be done is the replicas of all the reactions where the 

lamellar particles were obtained to confirm these results. It is also important to test the influence 

of the temperature in these reactions. 

A more complete particle characterization should be done, namely related with elemental 

analysis, since as concluded there are some unidentified compounds presented in the analysed 

samples. Analysis related with the structural mineralogy should be done, such as XDR (X-Ray 

Diffraction) to understand the special arrangement of the crystalline structure. The refractive 

index and the hydrophobicity of the particles should also be measured.  

As the application of these particles as paper filler did not lead to results due to their low 

retention, it is important to study if the CPAM is the adequate retention agent, or if it is 

necessary to increase its amount to promote higher retention. Also flocculation studies should 

be made to better understand the behaviour of these particles during paper formation.  

Relatively to the application of these particles as coating pigment, the coater should be 

fixed to have a correct distance between the paper surface and the rod, resulting in a more 

accurate pick-up. Also, replicas of the previous coatings should be made. 

The use of these particles as coating pigments revealed good results related to printing 

quality. An economic study in a laboratorial scale should be done to see if a scale up of this 

process is viable.

 PCC Modification Reaction 

 

I. Procedure used by Carecho (2016) to modify the PCC particles – Reference 

procedure, S0. 

 

The procedure used in the previous work followed the presented steps: 

1) Add 2 g of industrial PCC in a 400mL beaker, and the add 50 mL of ultrapure water; 

2) To homogenize the suspension, it undergoes vigorous magnetic stirring. The 

suspension is heated gradually up to 50 ºC. 

3) Add the citrate buffer solution (prepared as described above) until it reaches the pH 

5.5, measured at 50 ºC. 

4) Place the mixture in an oil bath at 50 ºC. With the help of the mechanic stirrer, Heidolph 

RZR-1, and a round point glass propeller, it is stirred at 165 rpm for 48h. After, pour 

the mixture into falcon tubes to undergo centrifugation in the Hettich Universal 32 

equipment. The centrifugation must be done for 20 minutes and at 4500 rpm. This 

process should be repeated three times with two intermediated washes with distillate 

water. 

5) The obtained solid residue is after dried in the oven (Scientific series 9000) at 40 ºC 

until it is completely dry. 

 

II. Citrate buffer 1M and pH 4.5 

 

To prepare 100mL of citrate buffer the following steps must be done: 

1) Using a beaker, weight 21g of citric acid; 

2) Add 75mL of ultrapure water and stir magnetically until it dissolves completely; 

3) Adjust the mixture pH to 4.3 with pellets of NaOH (about 7,5 g needed); 

4) Pour the mixture into a volumetric flask (100 mL), fill up with water and stir; 

5) Measure again the pH of the solution. If pH 4.5 is not reached yet, add some NaOH 

until the pH is obtained. 

 

 



Appendix A 

A.2 
 

III. PCC particles modification (optimized process) 

 

1) Add 2 g of industrial PCC in a 400mL beaker, and the add 50 mL of ultrapure water; 

2) To homogenize the suspension, it undergoes vigorous magnetic stirring. The 

suspension is heated gradually up to 50 ºC; 

3) Add the citrate buffer solution (prepared as described above) until it reaches the pH 

5.5, measured at 50 ºC. 

4) When reaction conditions are reached, the mixture remains under stirring for 1h, to 

make sure that all the of the compounds react; 

5) After this time, the mixture is poured into falcon tubes to proceed the centrifugation 

step in the Hettich Universal 32 equipment. The centrifugation must be done for 20 

minutes and at 4500 rpm. This process should be repeated three times with two 

intermediated washes with distillate water. 

6) The obtained solid residue is after dried in the oven (Scientific series 9000) at 40 ºC 

until it is completely dry. 

 

This procedure was used to produce the particles S2, S3, S8, S11, and S12. In these 

reactions, the buffer pH is changed. This change is made when the buffer is prepared, by adding 

more NaOH to increase the buffer’s pH. 

 

The particles of S1 were produced with the same protocol, although as it was an attempt to 

reproduce the reference protocol, the buffer preparation was not yet fully understood. So, in 

this case, to form the citrate buffer, instead of using pellets of NaOH, it was used a NaOH 

solution of 0.1M.

IV. Procedure using a CIT 1M 

 

This protocol requires the preparation of CIT 1M before starting to follow the steps 

described below. 

 

1) Add 2 g of industrial PCC in a 400mL beaker, and the add 50 mL of ultrapure water; 

2) To homogenize the suspension, it undergoes vigorous magnetic stirring. The 

suspension is heated gradually up to 50 ºC; 

3) Add the CIT solution drop-to-drop until with until the desired ratio/pH is reached. 

4) When reaction conditions are reached, the mixture remains under stirring for 1h, to 

make sure that all the of the compounds react; 

5) After this time, the mixture is poured into falcon tubes to proceed the centrifugation 

step in the Hettich Universal 32 equipment. The centrifugation must be done for 20 

minutes and at 4500 rpm. This process should be repeated three times with two 

intermediated washes with distillate water. 

6) The obtained solid residue is after dried in the oven (Scientific series 9000) at 40 ºC 

until it is completely dry. 

 

This protocol was used to obtain S4, S9, S10 and S13. The ratios and the pH of the final 

solutions altered between the samples.  S10 and S13 have the same protocol except that GCC 

was used as starting material of S13. 

 

 

V. Procedure using a CIT 1M solution and a NaOH 1M solution 

 

This protocol requires the preparation of CIT 1M and NaOH 1M before starting to follow 

the steps described below. 

 

1) Add 2 g of industrial PCC in a 400mL beaker, and the add 50 mL of ultrapure water; 

2) To homogenize the suspension, it undergoes vigorous magnetic stirring. The suspension 

is heated gradually up to 50 ºC; 

3) As the pH of calcium carbonate is close to 9.5, start carefully with the addition of CIT 

solution drop-to-drop and near the desired pH of 5.5, start controlling it with the NaOH 

solution until the CIT/PCC ratio is reached.  



Appendix A 

A.4 
 

4) When reaction conditions are reached, the mixture remains under stirring for 1h, to make 

sure that all the of the compounds react; 

5) After this time, the mixture is poured into falcon tubes to proceed the centrifugation step 

in the Hettich Universal 32 equipment. The centrifugation must be done for 20 minutes 

and at 4500 rpm. This process should be repeated three times with two intermediated 

washes with distillate water. 

6) The obtained solid residue is after dried in the oven (Scientific series 9000) at 40 ºC 

until it is completely dry. 

 

These method is used in S5, S6, S7 reaction. The principle of all of these reactions is the 

same. However, the CIT/PCC ratio can be altered, as well as the pH of the final suspension.

Additives and Fiber Preparation 

 

I. PCC suspension 

 

The PCC / modified particles suspension is prepared as following: 

1) Weight the amount of particles needed to the sheets production and dilute with water 

until making a suspension of 1wt%. 

2) The suspension undergoes magnetic stirring for 20 min; 

3) After this time, take the suspension to ultrasounds for 15 min and then more 20 min of 

magnetic stirring; 

4) Keep the suspension always in agitation. 

 

 

II. Starch and ASA suspension  

 

1) Weight a 1000mL with a magnetic bar (wbeaker) and weight 20g of cationic starch; 

2) Add 800mL of demineralized water pre-heated at 60 ºC, to avoid the gel formation and 

facilitate the agitation; 

3) Heat the suspension up to 78 ºC, add 10 ?L of ?-amylase enzyme and thus starting the 

hydrolysis. Extend the heating for 5 minutes to 80 ºC; 

4) Add 3.3 mL of zinc sulfate to end the enzymatic conversion. Keep the mixture always 

in stirring; 

5) Extend the heating up to 90-92 ºC for 15 minutes (starch’s cooking) 

6) Cool down to 80 ºC and add 2g of ASA; 

7) Keep the suspension temperature between 60 ºC – 70 ºC. 

 

The beaker must be covered to reduce evaporation of water, thus altering the starch 

concentration. 

Before the first use, the beaker must be weighted (wtotal) to know the exact concentration of 

starch presented in the suspension (Equation A.1). With the paper formation the starch 

concentration changes, therefore by the Equation A.2 the exact amount to take out of the 

suspension is determined, before the paper formation.

Coating properties 

 

I. Coating Properties 

To investigate the coating properties of the modified particles, there were made tests to 

evaluate the ratio starch/PCC most indicated to this process. There were tested three ratios: 1/1, 

2/1 and 3/1, and duplicates of each coated paper were made. The ‘pick-up’ of the coated papers 

was measured and there were also performed analysis of air permeability (Gurley) and 

roughness to each paper. Table F1.1, present these values.
