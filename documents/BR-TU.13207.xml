O objectivo deste trabalho foi estudar o fluxo de materiais e de 
energia no bacteriopâncton do complexo sistema da Ria de Aveiro. 

O estudo de campo permitiu caracterizar perfis longitudinais, 
verticais e tidais de abundância e de produtividade bacteriana, pondo em 
evidência alguns dos factores que controlam esses padrões de variação. Os 
ensaios laboratoriais foram realizados para caracterizar o potencial 
bacteriano de reactivação, o efeito das correntes tidais sobre a actividade do 
bacteriopâncton e a contribuição da infecção viral e da predação para a 
mortalidade bacteriana. 

No estuário foram encontrados perfis longitudinais de abundância 
(bactérias totais 2,6-15,3 x 109 l-1 e bactérias activas 0,1-3,7 x 109 l-1) e de 
produtividade (0,05-18,6 µg C l-1 h-1) distintos, com máximos no estuário 
médio e mínimos no estuário inferior. 

Na secção mais baixa do estuário a abundância e produtividade 
foram semelhantes ao longo da coluna de água mas, na zona marinha, a 
produtividade bacteriana foi significativamente mais elevada à superfície 
(até 0,5 m) que nas camadas mais profundas da coluna de água. 

Foi observado um padrão tidal de variação bastante nítido, 
nomeadamente na zona marinha, caracterizado por aumentos de densidade 
e produtividade perto da baixa mar e decréscimos na preia mar. 

A variação sazonal do bacteriopâncton foi característica de um 
sistema temperado, com picos durante a estação quente e valores mais 
baixos nos meses frios. 

Neste estuário, a maior parte das bactérias (cerca de 70 %) são 
aparentemente inactivas e podem não responder, em períodos curtos de 3 
horas, à estimulação com nutrientes. 

De entre os factores ambientais estudados, a temperatura e a 
salinidade foram as variáveis que melhor explicaram a variação bacteriana. 
A disponibilidade em substratos também foi um factor importante no controle 
da actividade bacteriana, nomeadamente na zona marinha do estuário. 
Embora durante a estação quente uma média de 21 % da produção primária 
seja potencialmente suficiente para suportar a produção bacteriana no 
estuário, a matéria orgânica aloctone pode suportar uma parte significativa 
do crescimento bacteriano, nomeadamente nos meses frios e na zona 
salobra. A contribuição da ressuspensão de sedimentos e da entrada de 
materiais particulados a partir da área de sapal pode ser considerada 
irrelevante para a actividade bacteriana. 

A infecção viral e a predação exercem um controle forte sobre o 
bacteriopâncton da Ria. A contribuição da predação para a mortalidade 
bacteriana foi similar ao longo do estuário (69 % na zona marinha e 73 % na 
zona salobra) mas o controle por infecção viral (nas condições da 
experiência) na zona salobra atingiu quase o dobro (59 % na zona salobra e 
36 % na zona marinha). 

A capacidade de resposta rápida à variação das características da 
água põe em evidência a existência de reactividade bacteriana durante o 
ciclo tidal. Os diferentes perfis de variação apresentados pelas bactérias 
marinhas e salobras sugerem que a comunidade bacteriana pode variar ao 
longo do estuário.

nutricionais e biológicas que estão em diferente balanço nas zonas marinha 
e salobra do estuário.

The objective of this work was to study the fluxes of materials and 
energy at the level of the bacterioplankton in the complex system of Ria de 
Aveiro. 

Field studies were undertaken in order to characterise longitudinal, 
vertical and tidal profiles of bacterioplankton abundance and productivity, 
putting in evidence some of the factors that control these profiles. Laboratory 
assays were performed to characterise the bacterial potential to loose or 
resume viability, the effect of tidal currents on bacterial activity and the 
contribution of viral infection and predation to bacterial mortality. 

A distinct longitudinal profile of bacterial abundance (total bacteria 2.6-
15.3 x 109 l-1 and active bacteria 0.1-3.7 x 109 l-1) and productivity (0.05-18.6 
µg C l-1 h-1), with peaks at the mid-section, was observed in the estuary. 

In the shallower section of the estuary, bacterial abundance and 
productivity were similar down the water column but in the marine zone 
bacterial productivity was significantly higher (3.3 times, on average) at the 
surface (down to 0.5 m) than in the deeper layers of the water column. 

A clear pattern of tidal variation in density and productivity could be 
observed, namely in the marine zone. It was characterised by increasing 
density near low tide relatively to high tide. 

The seasonal variation of baterioplankton was characteristic of a 
temperate system with peaks during the warm season and the lowest values 
during the cold months. 

In this estuary, most of the bacteria (about 70 %) are apparently 
inactive and could not respond to nutrient amendments within the period of 
time of 3 hours. 

Among the studied environmental factors, temperature and salinity 
were the variables that better explained bacterial variation. Substrate 
availability was also an important factor controlling bacterial activity, namely 
in the marine zone. Although during the warm season, an average of 21 % of 
the primary production was potentially sufficient to support the whole 
bacterial production in the estuary, allochthonous organic matter showed to 
support significant bacterial growth, namely in the cold months and in the 
brackish water zone. The contribution of sediment resuspension and of the 
input of particulate matter from the salt marshe area was irrelevant to 
bacterial activity. 

Within the estuarine system, viral infection and predation exert strong 
control on the bacterioplankton compartment. The contribution of predation 
to bacterial mortality was similar throughout the system (69 % in the marine 
zone and 73 % in the brackish water zone) but the control by maximal viral 
infection (in the conditions of the experiment) almost doubled in the brackish 
water zone (59 % in brackish water and 36 % in marine water). 

The capacity for short-term responses to changing water properties is 
evidence for reactivity during tidal cycles. The different profiles of marine and 
brackish water bacteria to these conditions suggest that bacterial 
assemblages are diverse within the estuary. 

In face of the present results, it is concluded that the bacterioplankton 
of Ria de Aveiro evolves under physical, chemical, nutritional and biological 
pressures that are in different balance in the marine and brackish water 
zones.

CHAPTER 1 

 
INTRODUCTION 
 
1. Marine and estuarine bacterioplankton 
 
1.1. Ecological role of bacterioplankton 
Bacteria are the most abundant and the most important biological component involved in 

the turnover (transformation and remineralisation) of organic matter in aquatic systems (Cho and 
Azam, 1990; Pomeroy et al., 1991). In coastal waters, heterotrophic bacteria often amounts to 10-
30% of the living carbon biomass (Holligan et al., 1984, Cho and Azam, 1990) and may utilize as 
much as 40% of the carbon fixed by the primary producers (reviewed by Cole et al., 1988; Cho and 
Azam, 1990; Ducklow and Carlson, 1992). 

Heterotrophic bacteria are particularly skilled for organic matter transformation. They 
hydrolise dissolved and particulate organic matter, they can utilise substrates of difficult 
degradation and even use different allocthchtonous compounds as further sources of organic 
carbon. They convert dissolved organic carbon that would inevitably be lost to other members of 
the food web, into particulate carbon that becomes then potentially available to higher trophic 
levels (microbial loop). This capacity to the recover of dissolved organic carbon is significant in 
that it represents a link between the sources at different levels and higher consumers (Azam and 
Hodson, 1977; Azam, 1998; Pomeroy and Weibe, 1998). Moreover, studies in several aquatic 
environments have indicated that the microbial loop (phytoplankton ? DOC ? bacteria ? 
protozoa ?metazoa) can processes roughly as much energy as the classical grazing food chain 
(phytoplankton ? herbivore animals ? carnivores animals) as reported by Riemann and 
Sondergaard (1986). Therefore the microbial loop has become increasingly recognized as an 
important component of the aquatic food web and it has been suggested that it must be explicitly 
represented in ecosystem models (Anderson, personal communication). 

Through remineralisation of organic matter, bacteria regenerate nutrients in situ which are 
then used by the primary producers. Heterotrophic bacteria respire organic carbon to inorganic 
carbon at high rates, making bacterial respiration the major fraction of the total measured 
respiration in most aquatic systems (Williams, 1981). Cole et al. (1988) estimated, across a wide 
range of trophic conditions, that bacterial respiration is, at least, as larger as zooplankton 
respiration, reaching values up to 40% of the total planktonic respiration (Cole and Pace, 1995). 

It has been shown that bacteria not only transform and respire organic matter, but they also 
contribute for the export of relatively recalcitrant compounds to the bottom layers of water basins 
(Smith et al., 1992; Rivkin et al., 1996). Export is supported by the occurrence of enzymatic 
hydrolysis without efficient uptake of the resulting hydrolysate (Smith et al., 1992). Recently,

Stoderegger and Herndl (1998) showed that bacteria release up to 9% of the total carbon uptake in 
the form of difficult-to-degrade capsular material. The incorporation and respiration rates of this 
carbon material by bacterioplankton is three orders of magnitude lower than for glucose, suggesting 
that some forms of bacterial derived organic carbon may contribute substantially to the semilabile 
organic carbon pool in aquatic systems (Stoderegger and Herndl, 1998). Moreover, it has been 
shown that the small organisms that characterise the microbial loop (mainly bacteria), although 
generally grazed by organisms in the traditional food chain, may also aggregate and sink (Cho and 
Azam, 1988). So, the traditional view that carbon export is solely operated via large organisms 
requires revision (Anderson, personal communication). 

Understanding the transformation and remineralization dual character of planktonic 
bacteria in aquatic systems is a central paradigm of contemporary microbial ecology (del Giorgio 
and Cole, 1998). 

 
1.2. Contrasting properties of marine and estuarine bacterioplankton 
Differences and similarities between ecosystems, communities, species and processes have 

always attracted the scientific community. Such comparative analyses produce valuable 
information about basic structures and possible functions of the ecosystems (Rieman and 
Christoffersen, 1993). 

It is clear that physical, chemical and biological factors influence the microbial 
communities and operate with different strength in oceanic and estuarine environments. 
Nevertheless, the fundamental principles of the trophodynamic structure and functions are the same 
in oceanic and estuarine environments (Rieman and Christoffersen, 1993). Differences between 
ecosystems comprise the relative importance of various microorganisms or microbial processes 
(Rieman and Christoffersen, 1993). Autochthonous material, nutrient starvation (oligothrophic 
conditions), small cells, sodium growth requirement and seasonally-stable regime dominate in 
ocean systems (Cushing, 1989; Schultz and Ducklow, 2000), while allochtonous material, high 
nutrient concentrations (mesotrophic and eutrophic conditions), large cells, high bacterial diversity, 
strong-seasonal regime, steep physical, chemical and biological gradients are more important in 
estuarine ecosystems (Cushing, 1989; Rieman and Christoffersen, 1993; Thingstad et al., 1999; 
Schultz and Ducklow, 2000). In addition, physical factors as wind forcing and water circulation are 
capable of changing estuarine conditions over a much smaller temporal scale than those occurring 
in the open ocean (Schultz and Ducklow, 2000). Moreover, the strong relationship between 
bacterial and primary production observed in the open ocean and in lakes (Cole et al., 1988; 
Connan et al., 1999) is not seen in estuarine systems (Ducklow and Kirchman, 1983; Wright and 
Coffin, 1984; Findlay et al., 1991; Ducklow and Shiah, 1993). This absence of strong links could 
be due to differences in the metabolic capabilities of different bacterial communities found within 
the estuary according to space and time (Schultz and Ducklow, 2000).

1.3. Diversity of bacterioplankton 
In general it has been observed a relatively low bacterial diversity in aquatic environments 

(Rehnstam et al., 1993; Murray et al., 1998). Pinhassi et al. (2000) found that a limited number of 
individual bacterial (typically 10 species) consistently represented the majority of the bacterial 
community in different marine areas. Moreover, the denaturing gel electrophoresis technique, 
recently applied to samples from aquatic environments, revealed a limited number of bands, while 
the same technique applied to a soil microbial community revealed a very high diversity (Murray et 
al., 1996; Ovreas et al., 1997; Ovreas et al., 1998). A low or moderate bacterial diversity in aquatic 
samples has also been derived from theoretical considerations based on the number of 
bacteriophages versus bacterial numbers (Thingstad and Lignell, 1997). In aquatic systems, viral 
density is high and this implies that each potential host must be present also at high concentrations 
in order to allow efficient virus propagation (Wiggins and Alexander, 1985; Wilcox and Fuhrman, 
1994). It was concluded that, in marine environments and at each site and moment, there is a 
limited number of dominant bacterial species, refuting the hypothesis of the presence of an infinite 
number of species at high densities (Pinhassi et al., 2000). Moreover, it has been shown that most 
of the representative genera, widely distributed between different sea areas, show closely related 
isolates (Hagstrom et al., 2000). 

In estuarine environments it is expected a high bacterial diversity due to the mixing of 
seawater and freshwater and the transportation of particles from many sources, including salt 
marshes, mudflats, rivers and bottom sediments. Bible and Fletcher (1995) found that in the 
Chesapeake Bay the free-living bacteria composition differed considerably in the upper- and mid-
bay regions. Moreover, Bie et al. (2001) showed that the composition of microbial assemblages 
varied along physical and chemical gradients. Murray et al. (1996) found that in two California 
estuaries the bacteria similarity in adjacent stations was greater than the similarity in distant 
stations. They suggested that differences in the quality of organic matter and in phytotypes along 
gradients may control the composition of bacterial assemblages. However, mixing of different 
communities may also contribute to the observed gradients (Murray et al.,1996). 

It has been shown that bacterial composition of estuarine environments differ from oceanic 
waters (Martinez et al., 1996; Hagstrom et al., 2000). Hagstrom et al. (2000) studied the bacterial 
composition from marine and estuarine areas and found that the bacterial community of the Baltic 
estuary had a different overall composition at the genus level when compared to the open sea areas. 
The authors detected the lack of marine (salt tolerant) genera in the Northern Baltic and attributed 
this to the low salinity observed in this area (&amp;lt;10 psu). In fact, Hofle and Bretar (1995, 1996) 
found the presence of Pseudomonas and Shewanella in the Baltic instead of species with salt 
requirement for growth (i.e. Alteromonas, Roseobacter and Vibrio) detected in open sea areas. 
Moreover, Methé et al. (1998) found high abundance of ?-proteobacteria in freshwater lakes but 
the lack of these organisms in the sea and suggested that the presence of these bacteria in coastal

environments could be used as a marker for terrigenous inputs of bacteria in coastal waters 
(Hobbie, 1988). These community differences could be explained, in part, by different 
requirements for salt, but there are, probably, other factors determining the geographic distribution 
of different assemblages of bacterial species. Dynamic events like algal blooms, temperature 
change and upwelling have been also referred as important factors in the changing of the structural 
composition of bacterial communities (Fukami et al., 1985; Hagstrom et al., 2000). 

 
Differences in metabolic properties (e.g. bacterial production and substrate turnover) in 

different aquatic areas can be related to the distribution of specific bacterial populations 
(Hollibaugh, 1994; Martinez et al., 1996; Murray et al., 1996, Pinhassi et al., 2000; Fandino et al., 
2001). In fact, Crump et al. (1999) found that the rapidly growing members of particle-attached 
estuarine bacteria were almost absent from the free-living or particle-attached bacteria of both 
coastal and riverine waters. On the other hand, the free-living estuarine bacteria were similar either 
to river or coastal bacterial members. Additionally, it has been proved that the higher cell specific 
activity of particle-attached-bacteria (Karmer and Herndl, 1992; Smith et al., 1992) derives from 
the different phylogenetic identity of these bacteria when compared to free-living cells, rather than 
to substrate induction (DeLong et al., 1993; Acinas et al., 1999; Fandino et al., 2001). 

 
1.4. Bacterioplankton abundance and production 
Since the 1970`s it has become increasingly clear that bacterioplankton makes a significant 

contribution to planktonic abundance (Holligan et al., 1984; del Giorgio and Cole, 1998;) and 
productivity (Cole et al., 1988; Goosen et al., 1997) in aquatic systems. 

Physical and chemical properties of the water column as well as the abundance and 
productivity of the bacterial community vary in aquatic systems according to the temperature range 
(Heinanen and Kuparinen, 1991; Di Siervi et al., 1995), depth of the water column (Pace and Cole, 
1994; Talbot et al., 1997) and, in estuaries, with the proximity to the sea (Almeida and Alcântara, 
1992; Alcântara and Almeida, 1994; Goosen et al., 1995; Goosen et al., 1997; Kornas et al., 1998) 
and with tidal water circulation (Almeida and Alcântara, 1992; Shiah and Ducklow, 1995; Hoppe et 
al., 1996). In spite of the large ecological diversity among particular areas, common features of the 
bacterial community can be determined. Total and active bacterial numbers and productivity are 
generally highest in the warm season, in the photic zone, at the mid-upper estuarine sections as well 
as near low tide (Almeida and Alcântara, 1992; Alcântara and Almeida, 1994; Di Siervi et al., 
1995; Hoppe et al., 1996; Goosen et al., 1997). 

 
1.4.1. Profiles of bacterioplankton abundance (total and active bacteria) 
The levels of bacterial abundance in various aquatic systems (usually in the order of 108 to 

109 cells l-1) are relatively invariant when compared to the variation over 4-5 orders of magnitude

in activity measurements (Chin-Leo and Brenner, 1992; del Giorgio et al., 1996; Hoppe et al., 
1996). Bacterial density, however, can vary greatly in different environments. Estuarine waters are 
1-3 orders of magnitude richer in bacterioplankton than the open ocean (Hall and Vincent, 1990; 
Pomeroy et al., 1994; Bianchi and Giuliano, 1996; Talbot et al., 1997; Bouvy et al., 1998; Kornas 
et al., 1998; Borsheim, 2000). Bacterial abundance in the ocean seldom exceeds 2 x 109 cells l-1, 
whereas it commonly does so in estuaries (Ducklow, 1992). The lower limit of the range reported 
for the open ocean reach values in the order of 107 cells l-1 (Hall and Vincent, 1990; Pomeroy et al., 
1994; Bianchi and Giuliano, 1996). The upper limit of the range has been observed in temperate 
estuaries and is in the order of 1010 cells l-1 (Hoppe et al., 1996; Amon and Brenner, 1998; Cunha et 
al., 2000). In the open ocean, bacterial abundance exhibits clear vertical profiles of variation 
according to the decrease of cell density below the photic zone (Bianchi and Giuliano, 1996; 
Borsheim, 2000; Bode et al., 2001). In coastal waters, bacterial density is, in general, highest in 
surface water (Heinanen, 1991) but in shallow estuarine systems bacterial abundance can be 
homogeneous down the water column (reviewed by Ducklow and Shiah, 1993) or even higher near 
the bottom (Amon and Benner, 1998). Total bacterial numbers in open oceanic waters and in 
coastal waters decrease, in general, in the cold season by a factor of 4 to 14 relatively to the warm 
season (Hoppe, 1978; Sommmaruga and Conde, 1997; Yanada et al., 2000). In estuarine systems, 
distinct longitudinal profiles of variation are generally characterised by increases in bacterial 
abundance from the outer to the upper- (Palumbo and Fergunson, 1978; Goosen et al., 1997; 
Kornas et al., 1998) or mid- (Wright and Coffin, 1983; Bordalo et al., 1998; Cunha et al., 2000) 
estuarine sections. In these systems the variation associated to tidal currents is generally 
characterised by increasing bacterial density near low tide compared to high tide (Shiah and 
Ducklow, 1995; Hoppe et al., 1996). 

 
It has been shown that only a fraction of the total bacterial number is metabolically active 

(del Giorgio et al., 1996; Ullrich et al., 1996; Sommaruga and Conde, 1997; Sherr et al., 1999; 
Choi et al., 1999; Bernan et al., 2001). Consequently, the total bacterial number may not be a 
useful ecological parameter, since only the fraction of metabolically active bacteria are responsible 
for growth, nutrient uptake and transformation of organic carbon substrates. On the other hand, this 
fraction may also be selectively grazed (Sherr et al., 1992; del Giorgio et al., 1996) or infected by 
viruses (Proctor and Fuhrman, 1990). Total bacterial numbers yield valuable information on 
standing stock without however reflecting the real metabolic activity (review by Es Van and 
Mayer-Reil, 1982). It is possible that the number of active cells is more variable among systems 
than the total number of bacteria, and that this variation is masked by a rather large and constant 
pool of inactive bacteria (del Giorgio and Scarborough, 1995). Therefore, it may be pertinent to 
distinguish between active and inactive bacteria in an ecosystem. 



 
Introduction

Several methods have been developed to estimate the fraction of active bacteria in aquatic 
environments. Among them, those involving microscope direct counts (Tabor and Neihof, 1984; 
Rodriguez et al., 1992) and, more recently, flow cytometry (Porter et al., 1995; Button et al., 1996) 
have been preferred to the more complex and time-consuming microautoradiography procedure 
(Meyer-Reil, 1978; Tabor and Neihof 1982). Direct viable count methods, based on cell 
enlargement response, suffer however from methodological limitations when applied to natural 
samples (Joux and LeBaron, 1997; Ullrich et al., 1999; Choi et al., 1999). Direct viable count 
methods based on the addition of a single antibiotic (nalidix acid), or of an antibiotic cocktail, 
require the addition of supplementary substrates (yeast extract) and, when applied to complex 
communities have limitations due to the variable response of the different bacteria to the antibiotic, 
making the enlargement response difficult to evaluate (Thorsen et al., 1992). On the other hand, 
direct methods based on determinations of the activity of the electron transport system, 
predominantly following the use of the tetrazolium salt 2-p-iodo-phenyl-3-p-nitrophenyl-5 
phenyltetrazolium chloride (INT) (Zimmermann et al., 1978) and, more recently, of a fluorochrome 
version, 5-cyano-2,3 ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (CTC) (Rodriguez et al., 1992) underestimates the 
fraction of active bacteria (Ullrich et al., 1999; Choi et al., 1999). Underestimation is due to the 
toxicity of the redox compound to bacteria (Ullrich et al., 1996) and to the fact that not all bacteria 
can effectively reduce CTC (Smith and McFeters, 1997). More recently, other methods have been 
proposed to distinguish inactive from active bacteria using fluorogenic compounds, such as 
TOPRO-1, methods that identify non-viable cells with membrane and cell wall integrity 
compromised (Williams et al., 1998). Universal 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes have 
been also used to identify bacterial cells as potentially metabolically active (Karmer and Fuhrman, 
1997). 

Although few studies have analysed in detail the variability of the abundance and 
proportion of active bacteria, the general pattern is that, despite the different methods used, in most 
aquatic systems only a small fraction of bacteria is metabolically active (del Giorgio and 
Scarborough, 1995; Zweifel and Hagstrom, 1995; Choi et al., 1999; Sherr et al., 1999). Data from 
the literature compiled by del Giorgio and Scarborough (1995) indicate that the proportion of active 
bacteria increases from&amp;lt;5% in the most oligotrophic open ocean areas to &gt;50% in estuarine 
environments. Active bacterial number seems to vary considerably more than total number of 
bacteria. Over a broad range of aquatic systems, the active bacterial number varied by four orders 
of magnitude, whereas the number of total bacteria varied by three orders of magnitude (del 
Giorgio and Scarborough, 1995). Active bacteria number show a distinct minimum during the cold 
season (about an order of magnitude bellow warm season values) but the annual variation in the 
fraction of active bacteria is not so distinct (Hoppe, 1978; Sommmaruga and Conde, 1997; Bernan 
et al., 2001). The highest values of active bacteria number are frequently observed in surface water

but the proportion of active bacteria either decreases with depth (Novitsky, 1983; Simek, 1986) or 
varies irregularly down the water column (Bianchi and Giuliano, 1996). 

 
Although a large fraction of bacteria has been considered as metabolically inactive, it is 

well known that inactive bacteria may be dead, dormant, or slowly growing (Morita, 1997; Schut et 
al., 1997; Sherr et al., 1999). Choi et al. (1999) demonstrated that a substantial fraction (30 to 85%) 
of the apparently inactive marine bacteria, in relation to the detected activity of the electron 
transport system, can become active within 1 to 2 days after addition of organic matter and/or 
increase of water temperature. Bernan et al. (2001) found also that some bacteria, which appear to 
be inactive, can become active when stimulated by substrate addition, even though cell division is 
inhibited. This result suggests that a significant proportion of less active bacteria have the capacity 
to change their physiological state becoming metabolically active under favorable growth 
conditions. 

 
1.4.2. Profiles of bacterioplankton production 
Biomass production by heterotrophic bacteria is, from an ecological viewpoint, secondary 

production and reflects the overall bacterial response to the prevailing ecological conditions. The 
current methods for measuring bacterial production are simple to perform and are a convenient way 
to follow bacterial growth over time (Bell and Kuparinen, 1984), or over changing geographical or 
local conditions (Pace and Cole, 1994). On the other hand, comparison of bacterial production and 
primary production is a well-accepted indication of the trophic state of a system. It is known that 
ecosystems in which bacterial production is in excess of net primary production are dominated by 
allochthonous inputs of organic carbon and are decidedly heterotrophic. Contrarily, systems in 
which bacterial production is in deficit of net primary production are characterised as autotrophic 
(Cole and Pace, 1995). 

In spite of the fact that only a small proportion of the total bacteria are active under natural 
conditions, their production in various aquatic environments has been found to average 20% of 
primary production (Williams, 1981; Cole et al., 1988), and about twice the production of the 
macrozooplankton (Cole et al., 1988). 

Biomass productivity by heterotrophic bacterioplankton in aquatic systems is in the range 
of 0.0003-26.2 µg C l-1 h-1 (Shiah and Ducklow, 1995; Jellett et al., 1996; Bouvy et al., 1998; Gasol 
et al., 1998; Hoppe et al., 1998; Kisand and Noges, 1998, Shiah et al., 1999). In estuarine systems 
the values are often high when compared to the adjacent coastal areas and open sea (Ducklow, 
1992; reviewed by Ducklow and Shiah, 1993; Di Siervi et al., 1995). Ducklow and Carlson (1992) 
compilated data from various marine habitats and found means ranging from 1.8 to 5.6 µg C l-1 h-1 
in estuaries and from 0.5 to 0.6 µg C l-1 h-1 in open ocean. The highest values have been registered 
during summer months and the lowest during the winter in both estuarine and oceanic waters

(Kuosa and Kivi, 1989; Di Siervi et al., 1995). Vertical profiles of bacterial production in oceanic 
waters have been characterised by decreasing values from surface to the deeper water layers (Jellet 
et al., 1996; Talbot et al., 1997). In estuarine systems bacterial production is, in general, higher at 
surface water (Heinanen, 1991; Fuks et al., 1994) but in shallow estuaries bacterial productivity 
can be similar throughout the water column (Ducklow and Shiah, 1993) or even higher near the 
bottom sediment (Amon and Benner, 1998). It is most frequent bacterial productivity to increase up 
to 10 times from the lower to the mid-upper sections of the estuary (Goosen et al., 1997; Sanudo-
Wilhelmy and Taylor, 1999; Cunha et al., 2000). In these systems, the highest values of bacterial 
productivity have been observed near low tide (Shiah and Ducklow, 1995; Hoppe et al., 1996; 
Cunha et al., 2000). 

 
Several authors reported good correspondence between variations in bacterial and primary 

production in several ecosystems (Kuosa and Kivi, 1989; Fuks et al., 1994; Lignell, 1990; 
Panzenbock et al., 2000). Cole et al. (1988) examined the data from 70 studies on production of 
bacterial biomass, and found that bacterial production was 20% of primary production, on a 
volumetric basis. This value agrees well with the earlier estimation by Williams (1981) and with 
other direct studies in lakes and marine systems (Reinheimer, 1981; Fernandez et al., 1994; Connan 
et al., 1999; Panzenbock et al., 2000). When the entire water column is considered, bacterial 
production is more significant, averaging 31% of primary production in the data from the 70 
referred studies in lakes and coastal marine systems (Cole et al., 1988). In deep water columns 
where the depth is many times greater than the photic zone, the importance of bacterial production 
may be higher (Cole et al., 1988). On shorter time and space scales the ratio of bacterial production 
to primary production can, however, vary greatly (Bano et al., 1997; Witek et al., 1997; Bano et 
al., 1998; Shiah et al., 2001). Depth profiles of secondary and primary production were found to 
correspond poorly (Pace and Cole, 1994). Changes in bacterial and phytoplankton production 
within years were not closely related (Hoch and Kirchman, 1993) although total values covaried 
over the years Cole et al., 1988).  

 
2. Factors of variation of bacterioplankton growth 
Since a large fraction of carbon in aquatic systems is now thought to flow through bacteria, 

the knowledge of the factors controlling bacterioplankton production is relevant to the 
understanding of biogeochemical cycles functioning and, particularly, to the prediction of their 
evolution after perturbation. 

The main factors regulating bacterial growth include different variables namely nutritional 
(availability of organic and inorganic substrates), physical (e.g. temperature, water circulation), 
chemical (e.g. salinity), and biological (predation and viral lysis). Surprisingly, however, the

qualitative and quantitative relationships among these factors are still poorly understood (Shiah and 
Ducklow, 1995; Dufour and Torréton, 1996; Pomeroy and Wiebe, 2001). 

 
2.1 Availability of organic and inorganic nutrients 
Substrate supply has long been recognized as a dominant factor in regulating 

bacterioplankton abundance and production in aquatic systems (Ducklow and Carlson, 1992; 
Fuhrman, 1992; Shiah et al., 1999). Several studies have suggested, however, that the strength of 
the bottom-up control might be system- dependent and might also change within a system (Wiebe 
et al., 1992; Ducklow and Shiah, 1993; Bernan et al., 1994; Shiah and Ducklow, 1995; Shiah et al., 
1999). 

The strong positive correlation between phytoplankton and bacterioplankton biomass and 
bacterial production usually observed in field and enclosure studies suggests that phytoplankton 
may be an important autochthonous source of bacterial growth substrates (Williams, 1990; White et 
al., 1991, Panzenbock et al., 2000). Phytoplankton can directly supply bacteria with organic matter, 
through exudation from healthy cells and lysis of senescent and dead cells (Vadstein et al., 1993; 
Panzenbock et al., 2000). Indirect supply occurs via viral lysis or grazing by herbivorous 
zooplankton (Peduzzi and Herndl, 1992; Stom et al., 1997; Bratbak et al., 1998; Noble and 
Fuhrman, 1999; Hasegawa et al., 2000). 

In coastal and estuarine systems, bacterial growth substrates frequently derive from 
additional sources such as river transported materials, terrestrial runoff, antropogenic discharges, 
benthic fluxes and sediment resuspension. It has been found that non-phytoplankton or 
allochthonous organic matter supplies mediate, to a large extent, bacterioplankton growth in coastal 
and estuarine systems (Lee et al., 2001). Findlay et al. (1992), for example, estimated that the 
amount of allochthonous carbon inputs needed to support bacterial productivity in the Hudson 
Estuary was three to six times greater than the net carbon fixed by phytoplankton. Other authors 
(Coveney and Wetzel, 1995) arrived at identical conclusion with respect to Lawrence Lake. The 
original allochthonous compounds had undergone, however, partial degradation and transformation 
before entering the aquatic system, and were thus less labile than the autochthonous substrates 
originated from phytoplankton production (Hobbie, 1988). It has been suggested therefore that 
allochthonous organic matter provide stability to bacterioplankton, in the sense that the large pool 
of recalcitrant organic matter supports continuous slow growth, independent of the intermittent 
growth associated with the less constant presence of autochthonous labile organic matter (Wetzel, 
1984; Hobbie, 1988). 

The concentration of inorganic substrates is also a factor of control of bacterial production 
(Toolan et al., 1991; Thingstad et al., 1993; Torréton et al., 2000; Ferrier-Pagès and Furla, 2001). It 
is not yet clear, however, to what extent the inorganic or organic substrates may limit 
bacterioplankton production (Toolan et al., 1991). While availability of organic carbon has

traditionally been thought of as a key factor in the limitation of bacterial growth, the high inorganic 
nutrients requirements (Vadstein et al., 1988) and the high percentage of uptake traceable to 
bacteria (Currie and Kalff, 1984) suggest that the inorganic nutrients supply could also limit 
bacterial abundance and production. In fact, several studies have shown that bacterial growth 
increases with increasing availability in inorganic nutrients (Kroer, 1993; Pace and Cole, 1996; 
Wikner et al., 1999; Torréton et al., 2000). Moreover, heterotrophic bacteria have been shown to 
compete successfully with phytoplankton for inorganic nutrients (Currie and Kalff, 1984; 
Thingstad et al., 1993). Blackburn et al. (1998) showed that bacteria have nutrient uptake potentials 
around 100 times faster than that of phytoplankton. At low concentrations, the competitive 
advantage of bacterioplankton over phytoplankton for inorganic nutrients is a consensual idea 
(Dufour and Berland, 1999; Torréton et al., 2000). 

 
2.2 Water properties 
The growth of bacteria in aquatic systems is affected by in situ temperature, as concluded 

from the generally found positive correlation between bacterial production and temperature (Shiah 
and Ducklow, 1994; Kirchman and Rich, 1997; Shiah and Ducklow, 1997). It has been shown that 
the different temperature optima for bacterioplankton growth reflect the in situ temperature range 
(Simon and Wunsch, 1998). Recent studies have demonstrated that the variation in the rates of 
bacterial activity in eutrophic and mesotrophic ecosystems might primarily be regulated by 
temperature, with substrate supply playing a lesser role (Bernan et al., 1994; Griffith et al., 1994; 
Shiah and Ducklow, 1995). In oligotrophic systems the reverse situation occurs, with substrate 
supply playing a higher role on regulation of bacterial growth than temperature (Shiah et al., 1999). 
Wiebe and Pomeroy (1992) have clearly demonstrated reciprocal interactions of temperature and 
substrate concentration in the control of bacterial growth: bacteria could grow rapidly at low 
(&lt;10°C) temperature and high (micromolar) substrate concentration, or at high (&gt;10°C) 
temperature and low (nanomolar) substrate concentrations, but not at low temperatures and low 
substrate concentration. 

 
Salinity acts as a selecting agent of the bacterial strains that may proliferate in an 

ecosystem (Campbell, 1983; Rheinheimer, 1985). For example, bacteria with a salt requirement for 
growth will not be able to grow in estuarine environments with a large impact of freshwater 
(Campbell, 1983). On the other hand, it is unlikely that inflowing freshwater bacterial populations 
may survive within an estuary (Valdés and Albright, 1981; Painchaud et al., 1987). Stahl et al. 
(1992) showed that phylogenetically distinct species of Caulobacter occur in freshwater when 
compared to saline environments. In estuarine systems, in general, bacterioplankton exhibit higher 
abundance and activity at low salinities with decreasing values towards higher salinity values 
(Palumbo and Fergunson, 1978; Murrell et al., 1999). Peaks of bacterial abundance and activity 



 
Introduction 

 

 11

may occur, however, at intermediate salinities (Wright and Coffin, 1983; Fuks et al., 1991; Chin-
Leo and Benner, 1992; Cunha et al., 2000). 

 
It is well known that phytoplankton is negatively affected by high light intensities 

prevailing at the surface water, but there are only a few reports of light effects on bacterioplankton. 
Photoinhibion of heterotrophic bacteria has been reported (Pakulsky et al., 1998; Pausz and Herndl, 
1999; Mousseau et al., 2000). Herndl et al. (1993) found that bacterial production at the Adriatic 
Sea surface was inhibited by UV-radiation up to 40 %. The authors observed that this inhibition 
could be detected down to 5 m. Bacteria below the photic zone were as sensitive to light as bacteria 
in the euphotic zone, suggesting that bacteria are, in general, not adapted to UV-radiation (Lindell 
and Edling, 1996). However, in spite of the decrease bacterial activity by photoinhibition, 
photolysis of recalcitrant organic matter can stimulate bacterial growth (Wetzel et al., 1995; Miller 
and Moran, 1997; Bano et al., 1997; Bushaw-Newton and Moran, 1999). 

It has been found that UV-radiation can reduce phytoplankton photosynthesis (Helbling et 
al., 1996a) and growth (Jokiel and York, 1984), enhance phytoplankton exudation (Zlotnik and 
Dubinsky, 1989; Feuillade et al., 1990) and even modify the structure of the phytoplankton 
community (Helbling et al., 1996b). Contrarily to bacteria, phytoplankton may respond to light 
stress with different strategies including decrease of metabolism, increase in the production of 
protective pigments and by migration to deeper water (Karentz et al., 1994). 

Solar irradiation, on the other hand, is a major cause of decline in viral infectivity in 
surface waters (Wommack et al., 1996; Noble and Fuhrman, 1997), reducing virus-mediated 
mortality of bacterio- and phytoplankton. 

The indirect effects of light on the bacterioplankton are certainly complex. 
 
2.3. Water circulation 
The circulation of estuarine water is driven by a complex interplay of mechanisms, all of 

which have been shown to be important in regulating biological processes (Painchaud et al., 1987; 
Ducklow and Shiah, 1993). Circulation is capable of changing the conditions of the ecosystem over 
a much smaller temporal scale than that occurring in the open ocean (Schultz and Ducklow, 2000). 
In estuarine systems circulation may have a large effect on the abundance and production of the 
bacterial community as it supplies allochthonous organic matter, concentrates and conserves within 
the estuary locally produced organic matter and provides mechanisms for longer-term coupling of 
bacterial production and authochonous sources of organic matter (Ducklow and Shiah, 1993). 

In estuaries, water circulation is conditioned by tidal currents, river discharges and wind. 
Tidal currents move plankton populations back and forward creating complex circulation patterns. 
For example, Wright and Coffin (1983) studied bacterial distribution in the Essex estuary and 
showed a peak in abundance in the mid-estuary, flanked by lower numbers up- and downstream. 



 
Introduction 

 

12 

The authors explained this pattern of variation as due to the tidal regime which allowed bacterial 
populations to be retained within the estuary over several tidal cycles, and exposed them to contact 
with enriched salt marsh waters. Tidal currents also interfere with vertical distribution patterns in 
estuaries. Tidal currents can, for example, destratify the water column (Haas, 1977), stimulating 
total bacterial production (Ducklow, 1982). 

 
2.4 Mortality through infection and predation 
The discovery that the abundance of free viruses (&amp;lt;107 to &gt; 1011 viruses l-1) can exceed 

that of planktonic bacteria by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude (Proctor and Fuhrman, 1990; Jiang and 
Paul, 1994; Maranger and Bird, 1995; Weinbauer and Peduzzi, 1995a) motivated the research 
effort on the impact of viral infection on aquatic microorganisms. 

Numerous studies on a wide variety of aquatic ecosystems have indicated that 
bacteriophages can be important in controlling bacterial growth (Proctor and Fuhrman, 1991; 
Bratbak et al., 1992; Fuhrman and Noble, 1995; Maranger and Bird, 1995; Weinbauer and Peduzzi, 
1995b). It has been shown that up to 30% of planktonic bacteria were infected by litic viruses 
(Fuhrman and Suttle, 1993; Suttle, 1994). Estimates of bacterial mortality due to viral lysis 
indicated that phages can be responsible for as little as 1% up to 100% of the observed bacterial 
mortality (Proctor and Fuhrman, 1991; Bratbak et al., 1992; Steward et al., 1992; Bratbak et al., 
1993; Proctor et al., 1993; Suttle, 1994; Fuhrman and Noble, 1995; Hennes et al., 1995; Weinbauer 
and Peduzzi, 1995b), depending on environmental conditions and host community structure 
(reviewed by Wommack and Colwell, 2000). In coastal waters the virus-mediated bacterial 
mortality was estimated to represent a value similar to grazing by protozoa (Fuhrman and Noble, 
1995). Likewise, in an eutrophic lake, viruses caused large bacterial mortality and their 
contribution to mortality increased with depth since protozoa were absent in the anoxic zone 
(Weinbauer and Hofle, 1998). 

Viruses may also influence the structure of bacterial communities since they are host 
specific (Suttle et al., 1990; Thingstad et al., 1993; Wommack et al., 1999). Additionally, viruses 
may influence bacterial diversity at the genetic level since they can mediate genetic exchange via 
transduction (Miller and Sayler, 1992; Paul, 1999). 

Although the proportion of bacteriophages in the total virioplankton is not known, many 
authors have speculated that bacteriophages comprise the majority of the virioplankton population. 
In fact, in aquatic systems viruses are, in general, strongly correlated with bacterioplankton density 
(Heldal and Bratback, 1991; Maranger and Bird, 1995, Steward et al., 1996) and the virioplankton 
density has been found to be higher when bacterial productivity is also higher (Steward et al., 1996; 
Weinbauer and Hofle, 1998). 

 



 
Introduction

In aquatic systems, predation has been reported as a major mortality factor in bacterial 
communities (Weisse, 1997; Weisse and Muller, 1998). Heterotrophic nanoflagellates and ciliates 
are the most important grazers of bacteria in both marine (Sherr et al., 1989; Wikner et al., 1990) 
and freshwater systems (Bloem et al., 1989; Sanders et al., 1989). Several studies have shown that 
grazing by protists influences both cell size distribution (Simek et al., 1997; Hahn and Hofle, 1998) 
and the taxonomic structure (Simek et al., 1997; Hanhn and Hofle, 1998, Suzuki, 1999) of the 
bacterial community. 

Grazing rates have been observed to be higher on active than on inactive bacteria (Sherr et 
al., 1992; del Giorgio et al., 1996) and on motile bacteria than on non-motile bacteria (González et 
al., 1993). Furthermore, protists selected their prey based on size (González et al., 1990; Pernthalen 
et al., 1996; González, 1999) controlling, in this way, the size distribution of the bacterioplankton. 
Size selective grazing has been shown to result in an increased dominance of small cells that escape 
predation (Anderson et al., 1986) or, after periods of intensive grazing, in an increased dominance 
of larger cells, since these cells are difficult to ingest by a small flagelattes (Pernthaler et al., 1996; 
Hahn et al., 1999; Jurgens et al., 1999). Estimates of bacterial mortality due to predation in aquatic 
systems have been reported to range from 10 to 80% (Solic and Krstulovic, 1994; Fuhrman and 
Noble, 1995; González, 1999; Ferrier-Pagès and Furla, 2001) depending on environmental and 
biological variables (Vaqué et al., 1994). 

 
 
3. Thesis outline 
 
This work is focused on the trophic processes of the water column of Ria de Aveiro and on 

the factors underlying the shape of the spatial and temporal profiles of bacterioplankton activity in 
this ecosystem. 

In order to interpret the functioning of an ecosystem one has to approach the interplay of 
physical, chemical and biological processes and the interaction of the different compartments of the 
system. It is essential, in particular, to evaluate the different factors that may control the fluxes of 
materials and energy. 

It is well recognized that bacteria play an important role in driving the fluxes of carbon and 
nutrients and that they exert a relevant control on microbial food webs (Azam, 1998; Pomeroy and 
Weibe, 1998). 

The characterisation of longitudinal profiles of estuarine waters is fundamental in order to 
establish a general outline for the rational underlying the imports and exports between the estuary 
and the sea, putting in evidence some of the factors that control these profiles. 



 
Introduction 

 

14 

In estuarine systems, strong tidal currents may act as a major determinant of 
bacterioplankton distribution. Tidal currents may increase seston concentration and, consequently, 
decrease light penetration restricting primary production and, in turn, bacterial production. 

In the case of Ria de Aveiro, a shallow system, the stratification of the water column is 
mostly unnoticeable even in the deeper zone. In fact, the difference in salinity and temperature 
values between surface and bottom, when existing, is very small (Moreira et al., 1993). The Ria de 
Aveiro is characterised as a well-mixed estuary (Pritchard, 1967). The bacterioplankton may, 
however, follow or not the general pattern of the system. 

Dissolved organic carbon released by the phytoplankton, mainly at the senescence phase, 
has been reported as the best source of organic matter for bacterial growth (Wetzel, 1984; Hobbie, 
1988; Malinsky-Rushansky and Legrand, 1996). In some estuaries, however, other carbon sources, 
for example allochthonous inputs, may be equally available for the bacterioplankton. 
Allochthonous inputs will tend, in this case, to uncouple bacterial abundance and production from 
phytoplankton abundance and primary production, affecting the natural pattern of the two 
communities. Bacterioplankton abundance and distribution follows then the occurrence of natural 
and allochthonous sources of carbon and nutrients. In estuarine systems it is relevant to take into 
account not only river discharges but also the diffuse inputs and runoff from the banks surrounding 
the system. 

In shallow systems, as the case of Ria de Aveiro, the benthic compartment may also be an 
important source of organic matter and inorganic nutrients by simple diffusion. In fact, estuarine 
sediments are considered a privileged compartment for the deposition, accumulation and 
mineralisation of locally produced and deposited organic matter. On the other hand, transfer by 
simple advection or after sediment resuspension linked to erosion by tidal currents or to 
bioturbation may enrich the water column with bacteria, particulate materials and nutrients. 

 
Experimental research is frequently required in order to clarify hypothesis on the biological 

processes underlying the trophic processes observed in aquatic systems. For instance, the fraction 
of active bacteria in marine communities seems to vary widely in different systems (del Giorgio 
and Scarborough, 1995) with important and foreseeable effects on organic matter recycling but the 
reasons for this variability is not yet clear. On the other hand, a variable fraction of the non-active 
bacteria are still viable, and may be activated at different times through metabolic adaptation or 
through suitable stimulation. The experimental approach to the environmental conditioning of 
bacterial viability may explain not only the different status of the bacterioplankton in different 
communities and also clarify the ranking of factors inducing positive or negative responses in a 
particular community. 

The effect of long residence time of estuarine water on the differentiation and adaptation of 
the mixed marine and freshwater bacterial populations has not been translated into the question of

the presence or not of true brackish water communities. This may possibly be addressed under a 
well-controlled experimental set up. 

The viral impact on bacterial mortality in sea- and brackish water, a subject that deserves 
attention since 1989, is mostly dependent on manipulation of the two communities under 
experimental conditions (Peduzzi and Weinbauer, 1993; Weinbauer and Peduzzi 1995a). 

 
The knowledge of the functional responses of an ecosystem to natural or 

anthropogenic factors may allow the prediction of natural tendencies linked to the 
alterations in its trophic status as well as the possible effects of specific interventions. In 
the case of Ria de Aveiro, a system with considerable anthropogenic influence, a database 
of relevant parameters defining the functioning and the reactivity of the ecosystem to 
physical and chemical perturbations may be important in predicting and evaluating the 
range of possible effects and in avoiding undesired impacts. Natural or managing problems 
like massive release of nutrients during storms, increased eutrophication, and dredging 
may be equated at the light of experimental findings. It is known that dredging operations 
are frequently carried out in the estuary of Ria de Aveiro and that these activities interfere 
with the quality of the water column (Almeida and Alcântara, 1992). It has also been 
observed that the bacterial community in the bottom sediment is two to three orders of 
magnitude denser than in the water column (Almeida and Alcântara, 1992; Alcântara et al., 
1996). Although bacterial productivity in the sediment is not yet determined in this system, 
it was observed that, in a per volume basis, the rate of oxygen consumption in the sediment 
was 9 to 70 times higher than in the water column (Cunha et al., 1999). It is foreseeable 
that sediment resuspension during dredging, besides affecting the zoobenthos, will increase 
not only water turbidity but also bacterioplankton activity in the water column and organic 
carbon turnover. This will interfere with the natural pattern of bacterioplankton variation. 
The expected positive effects of the sanitary outfall under construction, on the quality of 
the Ria de Aveiro system may be followed in order to evaluate the capacity of the system 
for auto-depuration and as a test for present predictions. The sanitary outfall will discharge 
high numbers of freshwater bacteria and high levels of organic matter in the nearshore 
waters. In an ecological perspective, it will be interesting to investigate if freshwater 
bacteria, when suddenly discharged in the nearshore will be able to degrade the particulate 
and dissolved organic matter of the effluent, driving these materials through the microbial 
food web to higher trophic levels. 

 
Objectives of the work: 

1. To characterize the variability of the bacterial density (total and active bacteria) and 
productivity in the water column of the estuary.

2. To determine the relative importance of autochthonous primary production and allochthonous 
organic inputs as sources of organic matter to bacterioplankton growth. 

3. To investigate the response of the bacterial community to periodic changes in salinity and 
nutrient availability. 

4. To evaluate the effect of viral infection as a factor of bacterioplankton loss and to determine 
how it compares with the predation pressure. 

5. To investigate the trophic effects of sediment resuspension and runoff on bacterioplankton 
activity. 

 
To achieve these objectives several field and experimental studies were undertaken. 
 
Field-work 
Field research in the marine and in the brackish water zones of the estuary was driven in 

order to determine longitudinal, vertical, transversal, and 
tidal profiles of bacterioplankton and phytoplankton 
abundance and production, virioplankton abundance as 
well as accompanying physical and chemical 
parameters. 

The marine zone encompasses a water volume 
of 31.2 Mm3 (26% of the total water volume) and has a 
maximum depth of 20 m at the mouth of the estuary. In 
this work, the marine zone was represented by station 
N1 (figure 1), located in the Canal de Navegação. The 
chosen location - 2 Km from the mouth - avoids most of 
the water turbulence and traffic that exists closer to the 
mouth of the estuary and the strong currents that would 
risk the instrumental readings and sample collection. On 
the other hand, this location allows the better detection 
of the effects of transport of particulate and dissolved 
materials coming from the brackish sections. In order to 
put in evidence eventual stratification and local 
resuspension of sediments in the marine zone, 
measurements were performed during the warm season 
at four different depths (0.2 m below surface, 4.5, 2.5 
and 0.5 m above sediment surface) along six spring and 
neap tidal cycles. During the cold season the sampling 
effort was reduced. Water sampling at 0.2 m below

surface was performed only at slack water (high tide and low tide). 
The brackish water zone encompasses a water volume of 88.6 Mm3 (74% of the total water 

volume). The mid- and inner estuary is flat, shallow (average depth of 1 m) and generally flanked 
by salt marshes and mud flats. In order to assess the relative impact of flooding and runoff as well 
as of sediment resuspension in this zone, vertical and transversal profiles of bacterioplankton 
abundance and activity were studied and characterised. The brackish water zone was represented 
by station I6 (figure 1) located in the Canal de Ílhavo. This Channel is one of the five main 
channels in the Ria. Its location is very convenient as it follows the direction of the water current 
passing station N1. It has an easy access from the margins, is relatively calm, is not too deep and it 
is not far from the laboratory. The sediments along this channel vary from sandy to silty what 
makes possible to study resuspension and runoff in different geological conditions. Measurements 
were performed at two depths (0.2 m below surface and 0.5 m above sediment) along a transect 
established between the east margin (close to a salt marsh) and the center of the channel. The study 
involved four tidal cycles during spring and neap tides in the warm season. In the cold months, this 
station was also sampled at slack water but only at the center of the channel and at 0.2 m below 
surface. 

During the warm season, bacterio-, virio- and phytoplankton abundance and production 
were studied along a longitudinal gradient of salinity, extending across the outer- mid and upper 
sections of the estuary. Six sampling stations, including stations N1 and I6, spaced regularly at 3 
km were established along the longitudinal gradient (figure 1). Station N1 and station I2 in the 
Canal de Navegação, stations I4, I6 and I8 in the Canal de Ílhavo and also Rio Boco. Samples were 
collected only at low tide and high tide, at the center of the channels, and close to the surface (0.2 
m below surface). 

 
Experimental approaches 
The interpretation of some of the results obtained in fieldwork was subjected to 

experimental verification. 
Laboratory experiments were performed to characterise the viability state of the 

bacterioplankton through stimulation with organic and inorganic nutrients. The number of active 
bacteria and their proportion in the total bacterial community were determined after brief (10 
minutes) or long (up to 3 hours) pre-exposure to low concentrations of organic and inorganic 
compounds followed by staining with CTC.  

Also, the effects of the changes in salinity and other water properties on bacterial activity 
during tidal transport were studied in laboratory assays, in diffusion chambers. One same 
population (marine population from station N1 or estuarine population from station I6) was 
exposed to changed environmental conditions in the presence of the contrasting water (water from 
the other station). In each case, bacterial abundance (total and active bacteria) and productivity 



 
Introduction

were measured after 2, 4 and 6 hours of exposure and compared with the initial characteristics of 
the water and with the unchanged control. In order to test the effects of reversion exposure, an extra 
sample of each zone was incubated in the contrasting water for the first 2 hours, and then 
transferred to its natural environment. Incubation for an additional 4 hours period revealed the 
response to the reversed conditions. To evaluate the effects of increased salinity on bacteria, 
samples from stations N1 and I6 were exposed to natural brackish water conditions (18 psu), as 
well as to the same water after adding of NaCl to a final salinity of 34 psu, similar to that of the 
marine zone. 

The potential contributions of viral infection and predation to bacterial mortality was 
assayed in an artificial microcosm set-up on six combinations of plankton variables affecting the 
presence/absence of predators, viruses-to-bacteria ratio, viruses-to-bacteria distance and bacterial 
growth rate. The number of bacteria was determined after 6, 12 and 24 hours of incubation and 
compared with the initial values of bacterial density. 

 
Vertical and tidal profiles obtained at stations N1 and I6 were compared and the factors 

influencing bacterial abundance and productivity were identified (chapter 2). 
The contribution of primary production versus allochthonous carbon to bacterioplankton 

growth was studied along the longitudinal gradient of salinity during the warm season. In the cold 
season the study was restricted to stations N1 and I6 (chapter 3). 

Fieldwork data of bacterial abundance and activity obtained during the tidal cycles in both 
zones were compared with experimental work of bacterial stimulation assays and of diffusion 
chambers experiments in order to test whether a single, largely adaptable community exist in the 
estuary, or several distinct communities can be recognized (chapter 4). 

Vertical, longitudinal and tidal profiles of virioplankton abundance were determined and 
compared with those of bacterioplankton. The impact of the virioplankton on the bacterial 
community was assayed in a laboratory microcosm set-up and compared with that of predation 
(chapter 5). 

The vertical profiles of bacteriological, chemical and physical parameters were analysed 
for evidence of sediment resuspension during tidal cycles at stations N1 and I6. Runoff from salt 
marshes was also investigated but only in the brackish water area. In this area, transversal profiles 
of bacterioplankton abundance (total and particle-attached bacteria) and productivity were 
compared with the profiles of seston, particulate organic carbon, chlorophyll and dissolved organic 
carbon in order to evaluate the impact of runoff from salt marshes (chapter 6).

_______________________________________________________________________________ 
ABSTRACT: The bacterioplankton of the marine and brackish water zones of the complex system Ria de 
Aveiro was characterised as profiles of bacterial abundance and biomass productivity. During the warm 
season, total bacteria ranged from 0.2 to 8.5 x 109 cells l-1 and active bacteria number from 0.1 to 3.1 x 109 
cells l-1. Total and active bacterial numbers were, on average, 3 times higher in brackish than in marine water. 
Bacterial productivity  on different dates and different  tides in the marine zone varied from 0.05 to 4.5 µg C 
l-1 h-1. Here the average productivity (1.1 µg C l-1 h-1) was 3.5 times less than in brackish water (average 3.8 
µg C l-1 h-1; range 0.7-14.2 µg C l-1 h-1). Specific productivity per cell varied from 0.05 to 2.61 fg C cell-1 h-1, 
a range that was similar throughout the ecosystem. However, specific productivity per active cell was 19% 
higher in brackish water. Bacterial production variation was best explained by the number of active bacteria, 
which, in turn, was highly associated with total bacterial number, temperature and particulate organic carbon. 
In the marine zone, bacterial production was also influenced by depth and salinity. In the brackish zone, the 
set of independent variables explained a smaller percentage of bacterial production variation than in marine 
zone, suggesting greater importance of other variables. In the marine zone, and mainly near low tide, 
productivity was significantly higher (average 3.3 times) at the surface (down to 0.5 m) than in the deeper 
layers of the water column. This stratification of bacterial productivity was linked to the increased specific 
productivity per active cell, as no modification in the proportion of active cells in the population could be 
detected. The vertical profile of bacterial production in the deeper zone of this estuarine ecosystem, in which 
no clear salinity or thermal stratification occurs throughout the tidal cycle, seemed to reflect a biochemical 
stratification generated by increased phytoplankton exudation and/or by photochemical transformation of 
semi-labile or recalcitrant organic compounds. Shallower water masses tend to blur this surface effect. The 
relative importance of photochemical transformation in the pattern of estuarine bacterial production will 
therefore tend to vary with the bathymetry of the system. 

_______________________________________________________________________________ 

 
INTRODUCTION 

It is well known that the distribution and intensity of bacterial biomass production in 
estuaries depend on the location and size of carbon and nutrient sources, and on profiles of physical 
and chemical characteristics of the environment associated with water currents (15, 16, 22, 23, 28, 
34). Autochthonous organic matter is liberated by a variety of processes including phytoplankton 
excretion and mortality (14, 17), zooplankton feeding (30, 37, 39), bacterial mortality (21, 31, 44) 
and detrital hydrolysis (7). Several studies indicate that the organic matter excreted by 
phytoplankton is very labile and subjected to high turnover rates by heterotrophic bacteria (20, 24). 
Cole et al. (13) suggested that approximately half the carbon released by phytoplankton is 
processed by bacteria. Even so, labile organic matter is frequently accumulated in aquatic systems 
(41). This may happen, for instance, when bacteria compete with phytoplankton for inorganic 
nutrients (38). On the other hand, organic matter produced in marine ecosystems may exhibit low 
biological lability when it includes chemical structures that require complex ectoenzymatic 
hydrolysis (2) or physico-chemical transformation. Photochemical transformation has been

identified as an important process in substrate modification (3, 9, 11). Bano et al. (3) observed that 
exposure of water samples to natural or simulated daylight, increased bacterial use of organic 
matter by 300%, and that humic substances were the principal carbon source for the additional 
bacterial growth. Bushaw-Newton &amp;amp; Moran (9) also demonstrated that humic substances irradiated 
with natural sunlight supported enhanced bacterial growth due to the increased availability of both 
carbon and nitrogen. In comparative studies of bioavailability, natural humic substances from near-
surface water showed the same quality as carbon sources for bacteria as DOC (10). It has also been 
observed that humic substances in surface water are significantly better sources of carbon and 
nitrogen for bacteria than those from deep water (10). 

Allochthonous organic matter, particularly in coastal systems, is an important substrate 
supply for bacterioplankton (5, 27), its importance increasing, in general, when the volume of the 
water body decreases (40). We have determined (unpublished data) for the shallow estuary of Ria 
de Aveiro, that phytoplankton was potentially sufficient to support the whole bacterial production 
during the warm season but not during the cold months. Allochthonous carbon seemed, however, to 
contribute a significant fraction of the bacterial production even during the warm season. 

In order to understand the variation of bacterial production within a shallow estuarine 
system we compared information derived from longitudinal and vertical profiles in different tidal 
phases. 

 
 
 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Study site 

Ria de Aveiro (Figure 1) is a tidal lagoon on the western coast of Portugal, connected to the 
Atlantic by a narrow opening. The lagoon covers an area of 66 and 83 km2 at low and high tide, 
respectively (35). It exchanges with the sea a volume of water of 89 Mm3 in tides of 1 to 3 m 
amplitude (35). Several rivers carry fresh water into the lagoon with an average water input of 1.8 
Mm3 during a tidal cycle (4). The Ria has a complex topography, with different channels spreading 
from the mouth towards the different streams, forming a complex estuarine ecosystem. In this 
study, we compared one station in the main channel ? Canal de Navegação (station N1) ? 
representing the marine zone of the system (MZ), with station I6, a brackish water station in the 
Canal de Ílhavo (a secondary channel), which represents the brackish water zone (BZ). 

 
Sampling 

All sampling took place during the warm season (early May to early September). Station 
N1 was studied over six different tidal cycles (two in June 1996, two in August 1996 and two in

September 1997). Station I6 was sampled over four tidal cycles (one in April and three in May 
1997). Samples were collected from near-water surface (0.2 m depth) and deep water (0.5 m above 
sediment floor), at high tide (HT) and low tide (LT) and intermediate time intervals of 2 hours 

(HT+2h, HT-2h, LT-2h, LT+2h). In the marine zone water 
samples were also collected in 1996 at 2.5 and 4.5 m 
above the bottom. Water samples were transported and 
processed within 2-3 hours of collection. 

 
 
Physical, chemical and phytoplankton 

characteristics. Temperature and salinity were obtained 
with a conductivity meter (WTW ? Wissenschaftlich 
Technische Werkstätten, Model LF 196). Dissolved 
oxygen concentration, expressed as percentage of 
saturation, was determined with a oxygen meter (WTW, 
Model OXI 96) equipped with a stirrer (WTW, Model BR 
190). The concentration of suspended solids was 
determined by filtration of triplicate 0.5 l water sample 
aliquots through pre-weighed and pre-combusted 
Whatman GF/C filters. The filters were washed with 100 
ml of ultra-pure water, dried at 60ºC for 24 hours and 
suspended solids calculated as the increase in dry weight. 
Particulate organic matter was determined as the loss of 
weight after 4 hours incineration at 525 ºC (29). 
Particulate organic carbon (POC) was calculated as 50% 
of the particulate organic matter (32). Samples for nutrient 
assay (PO4

acetate membranes (MSI - Micron Separation Inc.).

(42) after filtration of 0.5 l triplicate sub-samples through 
Whatman GF/C filters and overnight cold extraction in 
90% (v/v) acetone.

Total bacterial number (TBN). Bacterial cells were counted by epifluorescence 

microscopy using a Leitz Laborlux K microscope. The samples were fixed with 2% (v/v) 
formaldehyde (final concentration), filtered through 0.2 µm pore black polycarbonate membranes 
(Poretics) and stained with 0.03% (w/v) acridine orange (25). At least 200 cells or 20 microscope 
fields were counted in each of three replicate preparations. 

 
Microautoradiography (MAR). Active bacterial numbers (ABN) were determined by 

microautoradiography (12) after amendment of samples to 30 nM 3H-leucine (Amersham, specific 
activity 15.9-24.8 GBq mmol-1). After 5 hours incubation at in situ temperature, samples were fixed 
with 2% (v/v) formaldehyde and triplicate sub-samples (2-3 ml) of each sample (10 ml) filtered 
through 0.2 µm black polycarbonate membranes. The filters were placed face down on slides 
coated with the autoradiographic emulsion NTB-2 (Kodak) and exposed in total darkness, at 4°C, 
for 7 days. The slides were developed with Kodak Detkol (one-to-one dilution in ultrapure water) 
and fixed in Kodak fixer. The developed autoradiograms were stained with acridine orange solution 
(0.04%) and hydrated in citrate buffer (0.004 M). Microautoradiographs were examined using a 
combination of epifluorescence (as above) and bright-field illumination in a Leitz Laborlux 
microscope. Cells were counted as active if associated with three or more silver grains. 

 
Bacterial biomass productivity (BBP) and specific biomass productivity (BBPcell and 

BBPactive cell). BBP was determined in 10-ml triplicate sub-samples plus a control that was fixed by 
addition of formaldehyde (2% final concentration). The samples were incubated at a saturating 
concentration (30 nM) of 3H-leucine (Amersham, specific activity 15.9-24.8 GBq mmol-1) for 1 
hour, at in situ temperature, in the dark. After incubation, sub-samples were fixed at 2% (v/v) 
formaldehyde. Protein precipitation was performed through the addition of 1 ml of 20% (w/v) ice-
cold TCA followed by incubation for 15 minutes on ice. Sub-samples were then filtered through 
0.2 µm polycarbonate membranes (Poretics), rinsed with 2 ml of 5% (w/v) ice-cold TCA and 5 ml 
of 90% (v/v) ice-cold ethanol (8). After standing for 3 days in scintillation cocktail UniverSol (ICN 
Biomedicals, USA) the radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS 
6000 IC). BBP was calculated from leucine incorporation rates using a ratio of cellular carbon to 
protein of 0.86 and a fraction of leucine in protein of 0.073 (36). BBPcell was calculated as the 
quotient BBP/TBN (BBPcell) and BBPactive cell was obtained from BBP/ABN. 

 
Statistical methods. SPSSWIN 7.1 was used for data analysis. As an attempt to explain 

the variation of bacterial abundance and production, stepwise multiple regression analysis was 
used. Temperature, salinity, depth, POC and chlorophyll were used as independent variables. ABN 
and TBN were also included as independent variables for the regression analysis of BBP and ABN,

respectively. The significance of difference between surface and bottom values in bacterial 
abundance, bacterial production and physico-chemical characteristics was assessed using one-way 
ANOVA. Three sub-samples were used for each variable at the six tidal phases in different dates. 
Only the data with normal distribution (assessed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) and with 
homogeneity of variances (assessed by Levene test) were used. The significance of both depth and 
tide on bacterial production variation was assessed using two-way ANOVA.

cells l-1 at I6. The average numbers were 
three times higher in the BZ than in the MZ. 
The fraction of active bacteria (%AB) 
varied from 5.9% to 55% and the average 
value was similar in both zones (26.6%) 
(Table 1). Bacterial biomass productivity 
(BBP) ranged from 0.05 to 4.5 µg C l-1 h-1 at 
station N1 and from 0.7 to 14.2 µg C l-1 h-1 
at I6. The average was 3.5 times higher in 
the BZ (Table 1). Specific productivity per 
cell (BBPcell) ranged from 0.05 to 2.61 fg C 
l-1 h-1 and the average value was similar at 
both stations (0.7 fg C cell-1 h-1) (Table 1). 

Productivity per active cell (BBPactive cell) was, however, 19% higher at station I6 (range 0.7-9.6 fg 
C cell-1 h-1) than at station N1 (0.2-7.2 fg C cell-1 h-1) (Table 1). 
 

 
Vertical profiles of bacterial number and productivity 
Bacterial production in the MZ was similar at 4.5 m, 2.5 m and 0.5 m above the sediment 

but it was less than in surface water (Figure 2). Further data compared only surface (0.2 m) and 
deep (0.5 m above the sediment) water layers. TBN and ABN were more abundant at the top of the 
water column (Figure 3), but the difference between surface and deep water was not significant 
(ANOVA, p&gt;0.05). The fraction of active bacteria was, however, similar at both depths (Table1). 
Bacterial productivity was significantly higher (ANOVA, p&lt;0.05) near the surface (Figure 4) being 
on average 3.3 times greater than in deep water but reaching values up to 8.5 times greater. BBPcell 
and BBPactive cell were also higher near the surface, being on average 2.8 and 3.0 times greater than 
near the bottom (Figure 5). The larger BBP registered in near-surface water was circumscribed to a 
maximum depth of 0.5 m (Figure 1). The contribution of the surface water layer to the total BBP in

the marine water column was 35%. The stratification of BBP, BBPcell and BBPactive cell was 
particularly noticeable near low tide (Figures 4 and 5). No stratification of bacterial number, 
fraction of active bacteria or bacterial productivity was observed in the brackish water zone 
(Figures 6, 7, Table 1). The difference between surface and deep water was not significant 
(ANOVA, p&gt;0.05). Specific productivity per cell was, however, frequently higher near surface 

(Figure 8) but the average was similar in surface and bottom water (Table 1).

Fluctuation of bacterial number and productivity during the tidal cycle 
The abundance and productivity of the bacterioplankton reacted to tidal fluctuation in both 

the marine and brackish water zones (Figures 3-8). The maximum and minimum values occurred 
around LT and HT slack water, respectively. The fluctuation in abundance of total bacteria and 
active bacteria was greater at the marine site. The percentage of active cells fluctuated randomly. 
The tidal effects on bacterial production were also greater in the marine zone.

Statistical analysis 
Stepwise multiple regression showed ABN as the variable that better explained the BBP 

(Table II). In the MZ, depth and salinity explained also the BBP variation. In this zone, ABN, depth 
and salinity explained 69% of BBP variation. In BZ only 12% of the BBP variation was explained 
by ABN. TBN variation was better explained by temperature in MZ (66%) and by percentage of 
dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll in BZ (33%) (Table III). TBN was the variable that better 
explained ABN variation (Table IV). In the MZ, TBN, POC, temperature and percentage of 
dissolved oxygen explained 64% of ABN variation. In the BZ, only 26% of ABN variation was 
explained by total bacterial number. 

One-way ANOVA indicated a significant difference between surface and bottom values of 
BBP only in MZ (p&lt;0.05). Bacterial abundance (TBN and ABN), chlorophyll concentration and 
physico-chemical characteristics were not significantly different between near-surface and bottom

water in both zones (p&gt;0.05). In the MZ, the results of two-way ANOVA showed the significance 
of the depth and tide on bacterial production variation. The interaction between these two factors 
was also significant indicating that depth and tide may act synergistically (Table V). However, the 
homogeneity of variances in this test was not observed (p&lt;0.05). In the BZ, the effect of depth and 
tide on bacterial production variation was not significant (p&gt;0.05). In this case the homogeneity of 

variances was observed (p=0.106).

DISCUSSION 
In this estuary, the fluctuation of bacterial production during the warm season was 

dependent on the absolute size of the active bacteria sub-population and on the intensity of their 
activity rather than on increment of the active fraction. It depended also on the variable intensity of 
the bacterial activity in response to the changing water properties during transport. It was observed

the changing water conditions. In marine zone, bacterial production variation was also influenced 
by depth and salinity. In the shallower brackish water zone, the set of independent variables 
explained a smaller percentage of bacterial production variation than in the marine zone, suggesting 
the greater importance of other variables, namely diffusion of nutrients from sediment and 
allochthonous organic matter inputs. Allochthonous  organic matter is most abundant in the inner- 
and  mid-estuary  of  Ria  de Aveiro  (Silva,  personal  communication).  Additionally,  it  has  been

reported (18, 33) that these compounds determine the major composition of the humic fraction of 
dissolved organic compounds in the surface water of this estuary. The combined effects of these 
factors give rise to larger fluctuations in bacterial production in the marine zone than in the 
brackish water zone (average tidal fluctuation in production of 12.5 and 4.9 in the MZ and BZ, 
respectively).

negative effect of solar irradiation, was not related to any of the studied physical and chemical or 
biological variables, which were relatively constant along the water column. Although a first 
approach suggests that increased values of near-surface productivity could be associated with 
phytoplankton and bacterioplankton transport by surface water from the brackish water zone, other  
biological parameters (i. e. total and active bacterial numbers and chlorophyll concentration) were 
relatively constant along the water column. Even though, the phytoplankton distribution could not 
directly explain the higher bacterial productivity in the half-meter surface water layer, irradiation 
may enhance phytoplankton exudation (6, 19, 43) and consequently bacterial productivity in this 
water layer. In addition, higher bacterial productivity in near-surface water could be stimulated by 
photochemical transformation of recalcitrant dissolved organic matter into labile compounds that 
may stimulate locally and transiently the growth of active bacteria. Although chemical analysis 
showed that phosphate and nitrite plus nitrate levels were not significantly higher in near-surface 
water, it has been found that photodegradation generates low molecular weight organic compounds 
such as primary amines (9) amino acids, combined amino acids and urea (26) that are readily 
assimilated by bacterioplankton. The higher stratification of bacterial production near low tide 
suggests that part of the recalcitrant organic matter transformed by solar irradiation in the marine 
zone may be transported by tidal currents from the brackish water. It would be worthwhile to study 
vertical and longitudinal distribution of dissolved organic matter in the estuary and test the effects 
of irradiation on the degradation of recalcitrant DOM and on phytoplankton exudation.

The factors are tide (HT, LT and intermediate time intervals of 2 hours) and depth (m). 

 
In the brackish water zone no stratification was detected. This may be caused by a much 

higher degree in turbidity that blocked light penetration and reduced photodegradation and/or 
phytoplankton exudation. On the other hand, substrate diffusion from the nearby sediment may 
increase bacterial production in deeper water, thereby obscuring the increase induced in near-
surface water by photodegradation of recalcitrant organic compounds and/or by phytoplankton 
exudation. 

The observed differences between surface and deep water bacterial production in the 
marine zone invite speculation about the relative importance of irradiation for the distribution of 
bacterial production within the system. It is worth noting that the vertical variation of bacterial 
production in the marine zone of the Ria de Aveiro was of the same magnitude as the longitudinal 
variation between brackish water and marine water. In the less eutrophic zones of estuaries, and in

coastal waters in general, solar irradiation may be instrumental in making available additional 
sources of nutrients for bacterial growth compensating for limitation of other sources

ABSTRACT: We intended to evaluate the relative contribution of primary production versus allochthonous 
carbon in the production of bacterial biomass in a mesotrophic estuary. Different spatial and temporal ranges 
were observed in the values of bacterioplankton biomass (31-273 µg C l-1) and production (0.1-16.0 µg C l-1 
h-1, 1.5-36.8 mg C m-2 h-1) as well as in phytoplankton abundance (50-1700 µg C l-1) and primary production 
(0.1-512.9 µg C l-1 h-1, 1.5-512.9 mg C m-2 h-1). Bacterial specific growth rate (0.10-1.68 d-1) during the year 
did not fluctuate as much as phytoplankton specific growth rate (0.02-0.74 d-1). Along the salinity gradient 
and towards the inner estuary, bacterio- and phytoplankton biomass and production increased steadily both in 
the warm and cold seasons. The maximum geographical increase observed in these variables was 12 times 
more for the bacterial community and 8 times more for the phytoplankton community. The warm to cold 
season ratios of the biological variables varied geographically and according to these variables. The increase 
at the warm season achieved its maximum in the biomass production, particularly in the marine zone and at 
high tide (20 and 112 times higher in bacterial and phytoplankton production, respectively). The seasonal 
variation in specific growth rate was most noticeable in phytoplankton, with seasonal ratios of 3 to 26. The 
bacterial community of the marine zone responded positively - generating seasonal ratios of 1-13 in bacterial 
specific growth rate - to the strong warm season increment in phytoplankton growth rate in this zone. In the 
brackish water zone where even during the warm season allochthonous carbon accounted for 41 % (on 
average) of the bacterial carbon demand, the seasonal ratio of bacterial specific growth rate varied from about 
1 to 2. During the warm season, an average of 21% of the primary production was potentially sufficient to 
support the whole bacterial production. During the cold months, however, the total primary production would 
be either required or even insufficient to support bacterial production. The estuary turned then into a mostly 
heterotrophic system. However, the calculated annual production of biomass by bacterio- and phytoplankton 
in the whole ecosystem showed that auto- and heterotrophic production was balanced in this estuary.

INTRODUCTION 
The functioning and, in particular, the productivity of estuarine ecosystems is largely 

reflected in the levels of primary production and in the fate of autochthonous and allochthonous 
carbon. Changes in bacterial density and activity along trophic and salinity gradients affect 
differently the balance between carbon incorporation and carbon mineralisation in different parts of 
the estuary (Carlson &amp;amp; Ducklow, 1996; del Giorgio et al., 1997, del Giorgio &amp;amp; Cole, 1998). In the 
case of the mesotrophic ecosystem of Ria de Aveiro, most of the carbon which is uptaken by the 
water column bacteria is incorporated into biomass (about 90% for glucose) (Cunha et al., 2000). 
This is not the common conclusion derived from studies in other marine ecosystems where the 
bacterial growth efficiency in eutrophicated waters plateaux near 50% (reviewed by del Giorgio &amp;amp; 
Cole, 1998).

Figure 1: The estuarine system of Ria de 
Aveiro. Sampling stations are indicated by 
arrows along Canal de Ílhavo. Station N1 in 
Canal de Navegação represents the marine 
zone of the ecosystem. Stations I2, I6 and I8 
represent the brackish water section of the 
salinity gradient along Canal de Ílhavo. Rio 
Boco (RB) is a river station although it is 
much affected by the variable strength of the 
tidal current.

It is recognised that primary production plays a fundamental role on bacterial activity (Cole 
et al., 1988; Conan et al., 1999; Ducklow &amp;amp; Carlson, 1992) and that other factors, namely 

exogenous carbon (Cunha et al., 1999; Goosen et al. 
1997; Mann &amp;amp; Wetzel, 1996; Reitner et al., 1999) may 
affect the coupling of these activities in aquatic 
ecosystems. On the other hand, physical and other 
chemical factors such as temperature, salinity and the 
concentration of mineral nutrients (PO4

3- and NO3
-) are 

also involved in the modulation of the 
bacterioplankton metabolism (Almeida et al., 2001a; 
Cunha et al., 2000; Riegsbee et al., 1996; Shiah &amp;amp; 
Ducklow, 1994; Tabor &amp;amp; Neihof, 1982). 

It is also known that the heterotrophic 
bacterioplankton consumes a large, although variable, 
fraction of the primary production (up to 50%) in 
marine and freshwater ecosystems (Cole et al., 1988; 
Conan et al., 1999; Ducklow &amp;amp; Carlson, 1992; Lignell, 
1990). The phytoplankton community, however, does 
not always supply the total amount of carbon required 
for the observed level of heterotrophic bacterial 
growth (Scavia &amp;amp; Laird, 1987). In this case other 
substrate sources have to be admitted (Shiah &amp;amp; 
Ducklow, 1994). In this study we intended to evaluate 
the importance of primary production in bacterial 
growth in a shallow estuary during the warm and cold 
seasons. 

 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 

Description of study site 
Ria de Aveiro (see Fig. 1) is a mesotrophic 

shallow estuarine system on the western coast of 
Portugal connected to the Atlantic by a narrow 
opening. It is subjected to considerable inputs of 
industrial and domestic discharges occurring mainly at 
the periphery. 

The lagoon covers an area of 66 to 83 Km2, 
respectively at low and high tide (Silva, 1994). It

exchanges with the sea 89 Mm3 of water in tides of 1 to 3 m amplitude (Silva, 1994). Several rivers 
carry an average of 1.8 Mm3 of fresh water into the lagoon during a tidal cycle (Barrosa, 1985). The 
Ria has a complex topography, with three channels spreading from the mouth towards the different 
streams forming a multi-estuarine ecosystem. Secondary branches originate from the three main 
channels to form a tight net of channels, islands and mudflats. In this study, we chose the Canal de 
Ílhavo, the smallest of the second-order channels, with a water volume of 2.8 Mm3 at low tide and 
9.3 Mm3 at high tide. This channel offers the advantages of a straighter water circulation and the 
absence of meaningful agriculture activity along the banks that might affect irregularly its trophic 
condition. 

The marine zone (MZ) of the ecosystem is represented by station N1 in Canal de 
Navegação. Stations I2, I6 and I8 represent the salinity gradient in the brackish water section (BZ). 
Rio Boco (RB) is the river station that is periodically affected by the variable strength of the tidal 
current. 
 
Sampling. Water samples were collected along the longitudinal profile of salinity (see Fig. 1) in 
summer of 1997 (12th and 20th July). In the cold season, samples were collected only at two 
sampling sites (station N1, 10th December 1997 and 9th January 1998; station I6, 28th October and 
7th November 1997). Surface water (0.2 m below surface) was collected at HT and LT at the centre 
of the channels. The diel variation in bacterial production was studied in the marine zone during the 
warm season (16 and 17 of June 1997). In this case surface water samples were collected at 
intervals of 1 hour during a total of 24 hours. Water samples were transported to the laboratory and 
processed within 2-3 hours after collection. 

 
Physical and chemical variables. Samples for nutrient (PO43-, NO3- + NO2-) analysis were filtered 
through MSI acetate membranes with a 0.45 µm pore size. PO4

3- was determined by the molibdate 
method and NO2

- plus NO3
- were quantified by the sulfanilic acid method after reduction of NO3

- to 
NO2

- in a cadmium column. The analyses were performed in a Segmented Flow Injection 
Automatic Analyser Alliance Instrument – Evolution II (Abreu &amp;amp; Duarte, 1997). The concentration 
of suspended solids was determined after filtration of triplicate 0.5 l water aliquots through pre-
weighted and pre-combusted Whatman GF/C filters. The filters were dried at 60ºC for 24 hours and 
suspended solids (seston) calculated as the increase in dry weight. The organic matter fraction in 
the seston (POM) was determined as the loss of weight after 4 hours combustion at 525 ºC (Parsons 
et al., 1989). Particulate organic carbon (POC) was assumed to be 50% of POM (Rodier, 1996). 
The depth of the water column was measured with a Sonar probe (Hondex PS-7 LCD Digital 
Sounder). The turbidity of the water column was assessed as Secchi depth values (SD). 
Temperature and salinity values were read in a WTW LF 196 Conductivity Meter. Dissolved

oxygen concentration, expressed as percentage of saturation, was determined with a WTW OXI 96 
oxygen meter equipped with a WTW BR 190 stirrer. 
 
Total Bacterial number (TBN) and bacterial biomass (BB). Bacterial cells were counted by 
epifluorescence microscopy with a Leitz Laborlux K microscope equipped with a I 2/3 filter for 
blue light. The samples were fixed with 2% formaldehyde (final concentration), filtered through 
black polycarbonate membranes of 0.2 µm (Poretics) and stained with 0.03% acridine orange 
(Hobbie et al., 1977). At least 200 cells or 20 microscope fields were counted in each of three 
replicate preparations. Bacterial biovolume was determined after measurement of 50 cells in each 
of triplicate samples. Cell volume was converted to cell carbon after assuming a conversion factor 
of 350 fg C µm-3 (Bjornsen, 1986). 

 
Bacterial production (BP). Bacterial production was determined in 10 ml triplicate sub-samples 
plus a control that was immediately fixed by addition of formaldehyde (2% final concentration). 
The samples were incubated in the presence of a saturating concentration (30 nM) of 3H-leucine 
(Amersham, specific activity of 58-92 Ci mmol-1). Incubation was carried out for 1 hour at in situ 
temperature. After incubation, samples were fixed with formaldehyde. Protein precipitation was 
performed through the addition of 1 ml 20% ice-cold TCA followed by 15 minutes incubation in 
ice. These samples were filtered through 0.2 µm polycarbonate membranes (Poretics), rinsed twice 
with 2 ml of 5% ice-cold TCA and 5 ml of 90% ice-cold ethanol (Blight et al., 1995). After 
standing for 3 days in scintillation cocktail (Universol) the radioactivity was read in a liquid 
scintillation counter (Beckman LS 6000 IC). Bacterial production was calculated on a per litre 
basis (µg C l-1 h-1) and integrated per square meter (mg C m-2 h-1) according to water depth. The 
total BP for the ecosystem during the cold or the warm season was calculated from the averaged 
BP at the two tides (HT, LT) expressed on a per litre basis. These values were multiplied by 24 
hours not taking into account the eventual difference in production during night and day periods. 
The semester production in each zone resulted from diel production multiplied by 183 days and the 
average volume of water in the respective zone - 32.1 Mm3 in the MZ and 88.6 Mm3 in the BZ - 
(Silva, 1994). The annual BP in the lagoon resulted from the sum of the two semester values. 
 
Bacterial specific growth rate (BGR). BGR was calculated as the ratio of bacterial production 
(BP), expressed in µg C l-1 h-1, and bacterial biomass (BB) expressed in µg C l-1. BGR per day 
respected a 24 hour period. 
 
Chlorophyll a (CHLO). The concentration of chlorophyll a was determined fluorimetrically 
(Yentsch &amp;amp; Menzel, 1963) after filtration of 0.5 l triplicate samples through Whatman GF/C filters

and overnight extraction in 90% acetone, at 4°C. Phytoplankton biomass was calculated from the 
concentration of chlorophyll a assuming a conversion factor of 50 (Eppley et al., 1977). 
 
Primary production (PP). Primary production was determined by the 14C-bicarbonate uptake 
method (Steeman-Nielsen, 1952). Duplicate samples (50 ml) were incubated with 8 µCi 14C-
bicarbonate (Amersham, specific activity of 50-60 mCi mmol-1) at simulated in situ light conditions 
adjusted with neutral light filters to 100%, 50%, 25%, 12,5%, 1% and 0,1% of incident light 
intensity. After 4 hours of incubation, 10 ml triplicate samples were filtered through a 0.2 µm pore-
size membranes (Poretics polycarbonate membranes). The filters were treated with fuming HCl for 
15 minutes and placed in picovials containing 5 ml of scintillation cocktail (Universol). The 
radioactivity was read immediately in a Beckman LS 6000 IC scintillation counter. Secchi depth 
was used for the calculation of the depths corresponding to 50, 25, 10, 1 and 0.1% of incident light 
intensity. Secchi depth was multiplied by an empirical factor, 0.40, 0.81, 1.35, 2.70 and 5.40 
respectively for 50, 25, 10, 1 and 0.1% of incident light intensity (K. Gocke, pers. com.). The 
integrated value, expressed in mg C m-2 h-1, was calculated taking into account the production and 
the thickness of each photic layer. PP was then averaged according to the total volume of the water 
column (µg C l-1 h-1). The total PP in the cold and warm seasons and the annual PP in the lagoon 
was calculated as described above for bacterial production but taking into account 12 hour period 
of insulation.

RESULTS 
 
Physical and chemical variables 

A clear longitudinal gradient of salinity was observed between station N1, in the marine 
zone, (33.5-35.6 PSU) and Rio Boco (4.5-7.3 PSU) (as shown in Table 1). In winter the salinity 
values were 6-8 PSU lower when compared to summer values. Water temperature in the warm 
season varied between 16.6 and 26.6 °C increasing upstream in daylight. In the cold season the 
temperature declined to 11.2-18.5°C, not as much as usual for winter. The level of oxygen 
saturation in the water column fluctuated from 76 to 116%. POC ranged from 5.5 to 7.0 mg l-1 in 
the warm season, and from 6.7 to 9.5 mg l-1 in winter. The longitudinal profile of water depth 
varied from 0.5 to 7.7 m during the warm season and from 1.8 to 13.0 m in the cold months. Secchi 
depth was greater in the marine zone, ranging along the salinity gradient from 0.5 to 4.5 meters in 
the warm season and from 0.8 to 2.0 meters in winter. The concentration of NO2

- plus NO3
- in the 

warm season showed a longitudinal pattern of variation characterised by an enormous peak (111.6-
204.6 µM) in the inner estuary. This peak did not reach the mid estuary and only a small variation 
in this concentration (0.9-5.5 µM) could be noticed from the mid-estuary to the mouth. The 
variation in the concentration of PO4

3- (0.3-3.3 µM) was not so clearly patterned, but the lowest 
concentrations were always found at the outer estuary and the peaks at the mid-estuary (as shown 
in Table 1). The nutrients levels were usually higher at low tide throughout the longitudinal profile

the warm season (HT 12th July 1997, LT 20th July

1998 and LT 16th December 1997; Station I6, HT 7th
November 1997 and LT 28th October 1997). Bacterial 
production (BP), phytoplankton production (PP). 

Biological variables 
Bacterial biomass (BB) varied from 45 to 273 µg C l-1 in the warm season (see Fig. 2) 

establishing a sharp pattern of enrichment from the outer to the mid-inner estuary. In the cold 

season, BB decreased, in general, by a factor of 2 (as shown in Table 2). BB was higher at low tide 
(LT) in the marine and brackish water zones and in both seasons. Phytoplankton biomass (PB) 
showed also a clear longitudinal pattern of variation with a maximum value of 1675 µg C l-1 at 
station I8, in summer and at high tide (HT). In the cold months the levels of phytoplankton biomass 
decreased 8.5 times at station N1 and 2.5 at station I6 (as shown in Table 2). At station I6, in the 
brackish water zone, phytoplankton biomass was higher at LT (1.5 x) in opposition to station N1, 
in the marine zone, where phytoplankton was 1.8 times more concentrated at HT. Bacterial 
production (BP) was more intense in the brackish water stations of the lagoon. In the warm season 
BP ranged from 1.1 to 16.0 µg C l-1 h-1 (6.3 to 36.8 mg C m-2 h-1) along the longitudinal profile  
(see Fig. 3). In a 24 hour tidal cycle in the marine zone during the warm season, BP decreased to 
around 50% during the dark period when compared to the diel average (see Fig. 4). At noon, BP 
was around twice the diel average while at mid-night, in the same tidal phase, BP was 1.6 times 
lower than the diel average and 2.7 times lower than the noon value. In winter, BP values (0.1 to 
6.0 µg C l-1 h-1 or 1.5 to 17.7 mg C m-2 h-1) decreased 2 times at LT and 20 times at HT in the outer 
estuary (station N1) and within a range of 2-3 times in the mid estuary (station I6) as shown in

Table 2. However, the pattern of BP variation with tide was not very clear in any of the two 
stations. 

Phytoplankton production (PP) in summer varied along the longitudinal profile from 13.6 
to 512.9 µg C l-1 h-1 (60.1 to 512.9 mg C m-2.h-1) increasing from the outer to the inner estuary (see 
Fig. 3). The sharpness of the increasing profile was attenuated when PP was integrated according to 
water column depth. In fact, although phytoplankton activity was lower in the MZ, the greater 
water depth of this zone  increased the integrated value. In the cold season, PP varied from 0.11 to 
3.3 µg C l-1 h-1 (1.5 to 6.0 mg C m-2.h-1). Compared to summer values it decreased 35-112 times at 
station N1 and 9-21 at station I6 (as shown in Table 2). The maximum values of PP per unit of 
volume were generally observed at LT.

In the marine zone, BP expressed on an annual basis and on a per unit water volume was 
lower (9201 µg C l-1 y-1) than PP (32574 µg C l-1 y-1). In the cold season, however,  BP (1425 µg C 

l-1 h-1) amounted to a higher value 
than PP (606 µg C l-1 h-1). On the 
other hand, in the BZ, BP (67953 µg 
C l-1 y-1) and PP (72966 µg C l-1 y-1) 
were similar on an annual basis (as 
shown in Table 3). Considering the 
total water volume of the lagoon 
(119.8 Mm3 being 31.2 Mm3 in the 
MZ and 88.6 Mm3 in the BZ) (Silva, 
1994), BP summed to 6309 ton C y-1 
and PP 7482 ton C y-1 fractionated 
as shown in table 3.

and cold season (Station N1, HT 9th January 1998 
and LT 16th December 1997; Station I6, HT 7th
November 1997 and LT 28th October 1997). 

In the cold and warm seasons, bacterial specific growth rate (BGR) generally increased in 
less saline waters, showing a range of 0.10 to 1.68 d-1 (see Fig. 5). In the marine zone, BGR at HT 
was 13 times lower in cold water than in summer. At LT BGR was similar in both seasons. In the 
brackish water zone, BGR at HT was similar in the warm and cold weather but at LT was about 2 
times higher in warm water. Phytoplankton specific growth rate ranged from 0.32 to 0.74 d-1 in the 
warm season and from 0.02 to 0.12 d-1 in winter (see Fig. 5). In summer PGR could increase up to 
26 times at HT in the marine zone. PGR maxima were observed at HT and coincided with PP 
maxima in both seasons. 

In the warm season, BP/PP varied from 0.02 to 0.35 along the longitudinal profile of Canal 
de Ílhavo (see Fig. 6) with maxima at LT. The proportion of bacterioplankton biomass to 
phytoplankton biomass (BB/PB) in this season ranged from 0.13 to 0.30. Both ratios tended to 
increase from the outer- to the mid-inner estuary. In the cold season, however, BP/PP and BB/PB 
ratios increased to values of 1.00 to 3.61 and 0.34 to 0.91, respectively (see Fig. 6). 

 

DISCUSSION 
Different seasonal, geographical and tidal conditions, involving temperature, salinity and 

nutrient supply, originated a wide range of bacterioplankton specific growth rates (0.14 – 1.68 d-1). 
Warm weather enhanced the specific bacterial growth rate by factors of up to 2 in brackish water

and of up to 13 in marine water. The factor of increase in BGR fluctuated considerably during the 
tidal cycle. Previous laboratory experiments have demonstrated the strong response of bacterial 
activity to exposure to contrasting water properties (Cunha et al., 2001). Taking these results into 
consideration, the tidal fluctuation of BGR was interpreted as the result of poor growth of brackish 
water bacteria when transported to a high salinity environment as well as of the stimulation of 
marine water bacteria when transported to brackish water. The positive response of marine bacteria 
to brackish water is, however, counterbalanced to some extent by the low salinity. Preliminary 
results showed that the stimulation could be enhanced if salinity of brackish water was increased by 
the addition of NaCl (M. A. Almeida, M. A. Cunha, F. Alcântara, accepted for publication). These 
facts resulted in an absence of a significant increase of BGR at LT in the marine zone as well as at 
HT in the brackish water zone during the warm season as might be expected. For this reason, the 
general increase in BGR from the mouth to the mid-inner estuary was clearer at LT. These facts 
taken together help to explain the observed spatial variation in bacterial production and reinforce 
our prior conclusion on the existence of bacterial communities with distinct salinity optima in the 
estuary (M. A. Almeida, M. A. Cunha, F. Alcântara, accepted for publication). The seasonal and 
geographical variation of phytoplankton specific growth rate followed the same pattern as BGR but 
was affected by higher factors. Phytoplankton growth rate in the cold season decreased by factor of 
3 to 26, probably due more to reduction of insulation than the small decrease in temperature, 
whereas BGR decreased by factors of 1-13. The greater (2-4 times) PGR values observed in the 
brackish water zone followed the increase in nutrients concentrations. 

In the cold months and throughout the longitudinal profile of salinity, the bacterio- to 
phytoplankton biomass ratio was considerably high (0.34-0.91) suggesting that primary production 
may not be enough to support secondary production. Indeed, the production ratio (BP/PP) along the 
salinity gradient varied, during this season, from 1.00 to 3.61. We infer that in the cold season, the 
potential contribution of allochthonous carbon to bacterial biomass production was very high (close 
to 100%) in both zones of the lagoon. 

In the warm season, the scenery in the lagoon changed. The bacterio- to phytoplankton 
biomass ratio along the longitudinal profile of salinity decreased to much less than 1 (0.13 to 0.30) 
both at HT and LT. These ratios suggest that bacterial production, in the warm season, might be 
essentially supported by phytoplankton carbon. In fact, the results showed that BP/PP ranged from 
0.02 to 0.35. The carbon incorporated in bacterial biomass at the different sampling stations 
corresponded, on average, to about 21% of primary production, an acceptable value as observed in 
other environments where phytoplankton could support the whole bacterial production (Cole et al., 
1988; Fuks et al., 1994; Kuosa &amp;amp; Kivi, 1989; Lignell, 1990). Assuming that the contribution of 
primary production to bacterial production in winter is negligible, that the sources of allochthonous 
carbon are seasonally stable and that the water temperature did not vary drastically from one season 
to the other, the bacterial production in winter could be taken as a measure of allochthonous carbon

inputs and used to more accurately estimate the contribution of phytoplankton to bacterial 
production in warm weather. The fraction of primary production diverted to the bacterial biomass 
production in the warm season (BPsummer–BPwinter/PPsummer) would decrease to 13%. These figures 
are within the range of the estimated 6-16% by Conan et al. (1999) for aquatic systems in general 
and of the experimental estimated 5-15% obtained by Fernandez et al. (1994) in the Mediterranean 
Sea. Neither is it far from the 20% value reported by Rheinheimer (1981) for the Kiel Bight. 
Furthermore, the observation of diel fluctuation in bacterial productivity, characterised by a 
decreased average during the dark period, suggests coupling between phytoplankton production 
and consumption by bacteria as reported by Gasol et al. (1998). Although during the warm season 
primary production could be enough to support the whole bacterial production in the estuary, in the 
brackish water zone allochthonous carbon could contribute, nevertheless, to the production of a 
significant fraction of bacterial biomass. Taking into consideration the previous estimate of 
allochthonous organic carbon inputs it is possible to estimate the contribution of primary 
production to bacterial production during the warm season by subtracting the fraction sustained by 
allochthonous sources from the total bacterial production in summer. The fraction of bacterial 
production sustained by primary production was estimated in this way as 59% of the total bacterial 
production in the brackish water zone and as 74% in the marine zone. This confirms the results of 
other authors who found that in mid-inner estuary the coupling between BP and PP was lower than 
in the outer estuary (Shiah &amp;amp; Duklow, 1995). 

 
CONCLUSION 

The specific growth rate of the bacterioplankton within the estuary was patterned according 
to space and season along the estuarine gradient. The presence of bacterial communities with 
distinct salinity optima, adapted to marine or brackish water conditions, seemed to affect the 
pattern at different tides. 

The geographical, seasonal and diel variations in biomass production bring about the 
conclusion that on an annual basis and on a per water volume unit, the ratio bacterial production to 
primary production was less than 1 in the marine zone and almost 1 in the brackish water zone. 
This defines two broad subsystems where bacterioplankton and phytoplankton are in different 
balance in relation to biomass production.

ABSTRACT: The reactivity of spatially distinct bacterial communities within an estuarine gradient to 
contrasting water properties was evaluated in the field and experimentally tested in diffusion chambers. In 
field conditions, it was observed that total and active bacterial numbers were, on average, 3 times higher in 
brackish water than in marine water. The fraction of active bacteria was, however, similar in both zones 
(26.6% on average). Total leucine incorporation, as a measure of biomass productivity, was 3.5 times higher 
in the brackish water zone following the increase in bacterial population size. Productivity seemed also to 
depend on the level of activity of individual cells since specific leucine incorporation per active cell was 19% 
higher in the brackish water zone. Experimental assays in diffusion chambers showed that when the marine 
bacterial community was exposed for 6 hours to brackish water, the fraction of active bacteria and leucine 
incorporation increased (20 to 60% and 50 to 220%, respectively). The opposite was observed when the 
brackish water community was exposed to marine water (20% decrease in the fraction of active bacteria and 
50 to 80% in leucine incorporation). The positive response of marine bacteria to the brackish water 
conditions was higher when the salinity of the brackish water was artificially increased to 34 psu. Brackish 
water bacteria, however, responded negatively to this increase in salinity. When the marine community was 
exposed for only 2 h to brackish water it promptly showed increased activity. The immediate transfer of this 
community to marine water for an extra 4 h period induced a return to the initial low activity level. In 
contrast, the negative response of the brackish water community after 2 h of exposure to marine water was 
irreversible when transferred back to brackish water. Bacteria remained at a low activity level for the extra 4 
hours. The high bacterial abundance and production in mid-estuary and the similar patterns of variation of 
total and active bacteria throughout the system, seemed to indicate conservative transport of an euryhaline 
bacterial community from its main source in the mid estuary. However, the experimental assays with 
diffusion chambers invalidated this hypothesis. They suggest the presence of 2 communities: a nutrient-
limited marine zone community that grows optimally at high salinity, and a nutrient-replete brackish water 
community requiring salinities bellow 25 psu.

INTRODUCTION 

Bacterioplankton communities in estuarine systems are frequently exposed to varying 
environmental conditions. The mixing of seawater and freshwater, the different residence time, the 
transportation of materials from diverse sources, including salt marshes, mudflats, rivers and 
bottom sediments and different climatic conditions, may induce different patterns of bacterial 
abundance and activity in different estuaries. Estuarine gradients of bacterial abundance are 
generally characterised by a steady increase in density (factors up to 3) from the outer- to the 
upper-estuary (Palumbo &amp;amp; Fergunson 1978, Goosen et al. 1997) or to the mid-estuary (Wright &amp;amp; 
Coffin 1983, Bordalo et al. 1998, Cunha et al. 2000). Although the metabolically active cells in 
these populations correspond generally to a small fraction, rarely reaching 50 % (Rodriguez et al. 
1992, Button et al. 1993, del Giorgio &amp;amp; Scarborough 1995, Zweifel &amp;amp; Hagstrom 1995, Ullrich et 
al. 1996, Sherr et al. 1999, Choi et al. 1999), the shifts in water characteristics have been reported 



 
Physiological responses of marine and brackish water bacterial assemblages 

 

 50 

to induce stronger responses in the size of the fraction of active bacteria than in the total bacterial 
number (del Giorgio &amp;amp; Scarborough 1995). The relative size of this fraction is minimal in 
oligotrophic ocean water (&lt;5%) and increases towards the estuaries up to 50% (Rodriguez et al. 
1992, Button et al. 1993, Gasol et al. 1995, del Giorgio &amp;amp; Scarborough 1995). The reasons 
underlying this variation are not well understood. Substrate availability has been extensively 
studied as a potentially important factor controlling cell activity. A number of studies showed 
positive correlation between the number of active bacteria and the concentration of inorganic 
nutrients and of dissolved organic carbon in highly productive lakes and estuaries (del Giorgio &amp;amp; 
Scarborough 1995). The systematic differences in the percentage of active cells in systems with 
comparable trophic conditions suggest at other factors combine to control bacterial activity (del 
Giorgio &amp;amp; Scarborough 1995). Temperature (Quinn 1984, Wright &amp;amp; Coffin 1984, Tabor &amp;amp; Neihof 
1984, Shiah &amp;amp; Ducklow 1994), salinity (Rigsbee et al. 1996), viral infection (Proctor &amp;amp; Fuhrman 
1990) and bacterial predation (Gonzalez et al. 1990, Sherr et al. 1992, Bird &amp;amp; Kalf 1993, Cole &amp;amp; 
Caraco 1993) may interact and produce different final results. 

Bacterial responses to changing water properties are generally higher in terms of activity 
rates than in terms of abundance (del Giorgio et al. 1996). Leucine incorporation, different 
enzymatic activities and glucose turnover, although maximal in the mid-estuary, may show, 
however, different environmental reactivities (Cunha et al. 2000). These differences in metabolic 
properties along the estuarine gradients may be related to the spatial distribution of distinct 
bacterial communities. In fact, Bidle &amp;amp; Fletcher (1995) have already found, in Chesapeake Bay, 
genetic differences in free-living bacteria populations from the upper- and mid- bay regions. 
Murray et al. (1996) analysed the phylogenetic diversity of bacterial assemblages in two California 
estuaries and concluded that bacterial similarity in adjacent stations was greater than in distant 
stations. These differences in genetic similarity may, according to the authors, be interpreted to 
result from the mixing of different communities or to the influence of the organic matter gradient in 
the physiology of the same microbial assemblage. 

 
Previous studies on the dynamics of bacterioplankton in the lagunar system of Ria de 

Aveiro found a curvilinear profile of bacterial abundance and bacterial activities with peaks at the 
20-30 psu section of the estuary (Almeida et al. in press, Cunha et al. 2000). Nutrients, organic 
matter and phytoplankton biomass concentrations were maximal in the mid- upper- estuary (Cunha 
et al. 1999, 2000, in press). In this study we attempt to distinguish 2 hypotheses in experimental 
conditions: the patterned gradient of bacterial activity results from flexible physiological responses 
of a single bacterial community to a changing environment or either from different reactivities of 
bacterial communities with distinct activity profiles.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Study site 

Ria de Aveiro (Figure 1) is a tidal lagoon on the western coast of Portugal, which is 
connected to the Atlantic Ocean by a narrow opening. The 
lagoon covers an area of 66 to 83 km2 at low (LT) and 
high tide (HT), respectively (Silva, 1994). It exchanges 
with the sea 89 millions of cubic meters of water over 
tides amplitude ranging from 1 to 3 m (Silva 1994). 
Several rivers carry fresh water into the lagoon with an 
average water input of 1.8 millions of cubic meters during 
a tidal cycle (Barrosa, 1985). The Ria has a complex 
topography, with different channels spreading from the 
mouth towards the different streams forming, in fact, a 
multi-estuarine ecosystem. Secondary branches originate 
from the 3 main channels forming a tight network of 
smaller channels, islands and mudflats. For this study, two 
sampling stations were selected to represent contrasting 
water characteristics: Station N1 in Canal de Navegação, 
representing the marine zone, and station I6 in Canal de 
Ílhavo, representing the brackish water zone. 

 
 

Sampling 
The marine zone of the Ria was studied during 6 

different tidal cycles (1 and 3 June 1996, 28 and 30 
August 1996, 2 and 10 September 1997), 5 of them in 
spring tide and 1 in neap tide. The brackish water zone 
was sampled during 4 tidal cycles (29 April and 5, 22 and 
30 May 1997), 2 in spring tide and 2 in neap tide. Samples 
were collected at surface (0.2 m from the surface) and 
deep water (0.5 m above sediment floor) at HT and LT 
and at intervals of 2 h (HT-2h, HT+2h, LT-2h, LT+2h). 
Water samples were transported and processed within 2-3 
h after collection. 

Samples for experimental assays were collected at 
the same 2 zones. For better contrast of the environmental

 52 

conditions at the 2 zones, station N1 was sampled at flood tide, 2 h before HT, and station I6 at ebb 
tide, 2 hours before LT. Water samples collected during the flood tide in the marine zone 
represented marine environmental conditions and the corresponding bacterial community. Samples 
collected during ebb tide at station I6 represented the characteristics and the bacterial community of 
the brackish water zone of the estuary. For assays in diffusion chambers, surface water was 
sampled in February and June 1998 and in November 1999. For studying the response of bacteria 
to the amendment of nutrient several surface samples were collected at the 2 stations from January 
1998 to November 1999. 

 
Physical and chemical characteristics. Temperature and salinity were read in a 

conductivity meter (millions of cubic meters, WTW ? Wissenschaftlich Technische Werkstätten). 
Dissolved oxygen concentration, expressed as percentage of saturation, was determined with an 
oxygen meter (Model OXI 96, WTW ? Wissenschaftlich Technische Werkstätten) equipped with 
a stirrer (Model BR 190, WTW ? Wissenschaftlich Technische Werkstätten). The concentration 
of suspended solids was determined after filtration of triplicate 0.5 l water aliquots through pre-
weighted and pre-combusted Whatman GF/C filters. The filters were dried at 60ºC for 24 hours and 
suspended solids (seston) were calculated as the increase in dry weight. The organic matter fraction 
in the seston was determined as the loss of weight after 4 hours combustion at 525 ºC (Parsons et 
al. 1989). 

 
Total bacterial number. Bacterial cells were counted by epifluorescence microscopy with 

a Leitz Laborlux K microscope equipped with a I 2/3 filter for blue light. The samples were fixed 
with 2% formaldehyde (final concentration), filtered through black polycarbonate membranes of 
0.2 µm (Poretics) and stained with 0.03% acridine orange (Hobbie et al. 1977). At least 200 cells or 
20 microscope fields were counted in each of 3 replicate preparations.  

 
Active bacterial number 
Microautoradiography. The number of active bacteria was determined by 

microautoradiography (Carman, 1993) after amendment with a 30 nM 3H-leucine solution 
(Amersham specific activity of 58-92 Ci mmol-1). After 5 hours incubation at in situ temperature, 
triplicate sub-samples (2-3 ml) of each 10 ml sample were filtered through black polycarbonate 
membranes. The filters were placed face down on slides coated with the autoradiographic emulsion 
NTB-2 (Kodak). The exposure, in total darkness and at 4°C, was carried out for 7 days. The slides 
were developed with Kodak Detkol (1:1 dilution in ultrapure water) and fixed in Kodak fixer. The 
developed autoradiograms were stained with acridine orange solution (0.04%) and hydrated in 
citrate buffer (0.004 M). Microautoradiographs were examined using a combination of

 53

epifluorescence (as above) and bright-field illumination (in a Leitz Laborlux microscope). Cells 
were counted as active if associated with 3 or more silver grains. 

 
CTC reduction. Five millilitre triplicate water sub-samples were placed in sterile plastic 

tubes and supplemented with freshly prepared 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyltetrazolium chloride (CTC) 
solution to a final concentration of 5 mM (Ullrich et al. 1996). A fixed control was prepared by 
first adding filtered formaldehyde (2% final concentration) to an otherwise similarly prepared water 
sample, which, after 30 min, was further supplied with the CTC solution. Controls and test samples 
were incubated in the dark for 4 hours at room temperature with slow agitation (100 rpm). Samples 
were filtered through 0.2 µm black polycarbonate membranes (Poretics) and observed for red 
fluorescence. At least 200 CTC positive cells, or 20 microscope fields, were enumerated in each of 
the 3 replicate samples. 

 
Leucine incorporation. Leucine incorporation was determined in 10-ml triplicate sub-

samples plus a control that was fixed by the addition of formaldehyde (2% final concentration). 
The samples were incubated at a saturating concentration (30 nM) of 3H-leucine (Amersham, 
specific activity of 58 to 92 Ci mmol-1) for 1 h at in situ temperature. Sub-samples were fixed in 
2% formaldehyde. Protein was precipitate through the addition of 1 ml of 20% ice-cold TCA, 
followed by incubation for 15 min in ice. Sub-samples were filtered through 0.2 µm polycarbonate 
membranes (Poretics), and rinsed with 2 ml of 5% ice-cold TCA and 5 ml of 90% ice-cold ethanol 
(Blight et al. 1995). After 3 days of being in scintillation cocktail (Universol) the radioactivity was 
read in a liquid scintillation counter (LS 6000 IC, Beckman). Leucine incorporation was calculated 
using a ratio of cellular carbon to protein of 0.86 and a fraction of leucine in protein of 0.073 
(Simon &amp;amp; Azam, 1989). Cell-specific leucine incorporation was calculated as the quotient between 
leucine incorporation and the total bacterial number, whereas leucine incorporation per active cell 
was the ratio between leucine incorporation and the active bacterial number. 

 
Bacterial activity in diffusion chambers assays. These assays were devised to measure 

rapid (up to 6 h) responses of the bacterial community of a tidal estuarine environment to the 
conditions prevailing in different phases of the tidal cycles. The idea behind this was to expose the 
same population to changing environmental conditions. Two experimental incubation systems were 
prepared, each consisting of a stirred, temperature controlled, water bath filled with 15 l of water, 
either from station N1 (representing the marine zone) or from station I6 (representing the brackish 
water zone). Diffusion chambers with a capacity 170 ml were prepared as described by Pereira &amp;amp; 
Alcântara (1993). Two 12.5 cm diameter of 0.2 µm pore size polycarbonate membranes formed the 
sides of each chamber, and allowed ample percolation of water and dissolved substances. One set 
of 7 diffusion chambers was filled with water from the marine zone and another set with water

 54 

from the brackish zone. Four chambers from each set were incubated in the bath filled with the 
same type of water (1 blank and 3 controls) and the other 3 in the contrasting bath (test chambers). 
The closed chambers were incubated completely immersed in the water bath at 20°C for 6 hours, 
corresponding approximately to the duration of half of a tidal cycle. Samples were taken after 2, 4 
and 6 h of incubation without removing the chambers from the bath. Each time a volume of 40 ml 
of water was collected through an opening at the top of the chamber. Dilution due to permeation 
after sampling (entrance of water due to the reduction of pressure inside the chambers) was taken 
into account and corrected using the blank chambers, which were also sampled after 2, 4 and 6 h. 
In the blank chambers the remaining volume of water was always measured and again inserted into 
the chamber. At the end of the exposure period, the volume of water inside the test, control and 
blank chambers was also measured. The initial characteristics of the marine and brackish water 
samples were determined immediately after field sampling.

In June 1998, to test the effects of reversion exposure, an extra chamber of each set was 
incubated in the contrasting water for the first 2 hours, sampled and transferred to the natural 
environment (bath with similar water) before being refilled and incubated for an additional 4 h. 
Further samples were taken after 4 and 6 h of incubation in the now reversed conditions. 

In November 1999, to evaluate the effects of increased salinity on bacteria, samples from 
stations N1 and I6 were exposed to natural brackish water conditions (salinity 18 psu) and to the 
same water to which NaCl was added to get a salinity of 34 psu, which was similar to that of the 
marine zone and processed as above. 

These samples were analysed for total bacterial number, active bacterial number and 
leucine incorporation. The active bacterial numbers were determinated in February and June 1998 
by the microautoradiography method, while in November 1999 the CTC reduction method was 
used. The values obtained for total bacterial number, active bacterial number and leucine 
incorporation were multiplied by the inverse of the factor of dilution determined in the blank 
chamber. 

 
Bacterial activity after supplement amendment. Surface water samples were 

complemented with different combinations of inorganic and organic substrates to induce recovery 
from occasional dormancy in the bacterial communities. Marine and brackish water samples were 
separately enriched with different substrates as described in table 1. 

To avoid significant dilution of the samples, 10 to 100 times concentrated substrate 
solutions were used. Samples for active cells counting were taken 10 min after substrate addition, 
except in November 1999, when the pre-stimulation period was extended to 1, 2 or 3 h. Active 
bacterial numbers were determined using the CTC technique (see above). It is assumed that during 
the short incubation period the total number of bacterial cells did not increase significantly. To 
avoid interference of CTC fluorescence in total bacterial counts, parallel sub-samples were 
incubated, after the supplement addition but without CTC, for determination of total counts. 
 

 

RESULTS 
 
Physical, chemical and biological properties of marine and estuarine water 

During the tidal cycle, the salinity varied from 23.7 to 36.1 psu (average 34.4 psu) in the 
marine zone and from 11.4 to 33.7 psu (average 26.0 psu) in the brackish water zone. The average 
water temperature was 16.8°C (range 15.3 to 20.6 °C) in the marine zone and 20.2 °C (range 17.0 
to 23.5° C) in the brackish water zone. Oxygen concentration was usually below saturation in both 
zones. The mean value was 76.7 % in the marine zone and 69.8 % in the brackish water zone. 
Particulate organic matter varied from 6.0 to 31.0 mg l-1 (average 14.4) in the marine zone and

from 6.0 to 17.0 mg l-1 (average 11.0) in the brackish water zone. No stratification could be 
assigned, in either of the 2 lagoon zones, to any of the physical and chemical variables studied.

Total bacterial number varied, in different phases of the tidal cycles from 0.2 x 109 to 8.5 x 

109 cells l-1 (Table 2). The active bacteria number (determined by microautoradiography) varied 
from 0.9 x 108 to 31.0 x 108 cells l-1 (Table 2). Bacterial abundance (total and active) was, on 
average, 3 times higher in the brackish water zone than in the marine zone. In both zones the 
highest values of total and active bacteria were observed near LT (Fig. 2). Although total and active 
bacterial densities were frequently higher at the surface in the marine zone, the values were not 
significantly different from those observed near the bottom. In the shallower brackish water zone, 
the values were rather similar throughout the water column. The average fraction of active bacteria 
was similar in both zones (26.6%), down the water column and over the tidal cycle (Table 2). 

 
Leucine incorporation varied from 0.05 to 14.2 µg C l-1 h-1 (Table 2) and the average value 

was 3.5 times larger in the brackish water zone. The values were higher near LT mainly in the 
marine zone. In the marine zone, leucine incorporation was higher at surface water, reaching values 
of up to 8.5 times higher than that near-bottom water. In the brackish water zone the leucine 
incorporation did not vary along the water column (Fig. 3). Leucine incorporation per cell (from 
total bacterial number) was similar in both zones (0.7 fg C cell-1h-1, on average) and ranged from 
0.05 to 2.6 fg C cell-1 h-1 (Table 2). However, leucine incorporation per active cell was, on average, 
19 % higher in the brackish water zone than in the marine zone (range from 0.2 to 9.6 fg C active 
cell-1 h-1). In the marine zone leucine incorporation per cell and per active cell were also higher near

at surface (0.2 m below surface) and deep (0.5 m above sediment floor) water, at high tide (HT) and low tide 
(LT) and at intervals of 2 hours as indicated. The values shown for each tidal phase were calculated as the 
average of six (marine zone) and four (brackish water zone) determinations at different sampling dates of the 
warm season. Total bacterial number (x 109 l-1) at surface water (TBN ???) and deep water (TBN ---?---); 
active bacterial number (x 108 l-1) at surface water (ABN ???) and deep water (ABN ---?---); percentage of 
active bacteria at surface water (%ABN ???) and at deep water (%ABN ---?---); salinity (psu) at surface 
water (???); salinity (psu) at deep water (---?---). 

LT and the maximum values were observed at the surface. In the brackish water zone, these 
parameters were similar at LT and HT, and were constant down the water column (Fig. 3). 
 
Bacterial activity in diffusion chambers assays 

Salinity in diffusion chambers filled with water from the brackish water zone was 9-23 psu 
lower than in chambers filled with marine water (Fig. 4). The time course of the salinity values 
indicated that the permeation through the membranes allowed a rapid (2-3 h) equilibrium in the 
concentration of dissolved materials between the chamber and the bath compartments (Fig. 4). 

 
At time zero of the incubations, the total bacterial number was 1.3 to 2.6 times higher in 

the brackish water. The active bacterial number, determined by microautoradiography, (February 
and June 1998) was 2.3 to 2.8 times higher in the brackish water, but when determined through 
CTC reduction (November 1999) was 5.6 times higher in the brackish water zone. The percentage 
of active bacterial cells varied from 14.2 to 32.1 % as determined by microautoradiography 
(February and June 1998), and between 2.9 and 6.4% when determined by the CTC reduction

method (November 1999). Leucine incorporation was also higher in the brackish water (2.0 to 10.8 
times). 

The bacterial community responded quickly to exposure to the contrasting water. Changes 
in leucine incorporation and in the proportion of active bacteria were detectable after 2 h of 
exposure to contrasting conditions (Figs. 5 and 6). When the marine bacterial community was 
exposed to the brackish water environment, the fraction of active bacteria and leucine incorporation 
increased. The opposite was observed when the brackish water community was exposed to marine 
water. 

 
The amplitude of positive and negative effects was different between variables and 

between experiments. The variation in the fraction of active bacteria during exposure was lower 
than that observed in leucine incorporation. The fraction of active bacteria and bacterial 
productivity in the marine zone increased 20 to 60% and 50 to 220%, respectively, in relation to the 
control when exposed to brackish water conditions. The fraction of active bacteria and leucine

incorporation in the brackish water decreased 20% and 50 to 80%, respectively, after 2-6 h of 
incubation in marine water (Figs. 5 and 6). 

The results of the reversion assays 
performed in June 1998 indicated, as mentioned 
before, that 2 h exposure of the bacterial 
community for 2 h to the contrasting water was 
sufficient to activate marine bacteria or to 
inactivate brackish water bacteria (Fig. 7). The 
fraction of active bacteria increased by 25% in 
the marine community and decreased by 22% in 
the brackish water community after 6 h of 
exposure. Leucine incorporation increased by 
30% in the marine zone and decreased by 56% 
in the brackish water zone. The positive 
response of marine bacteria to brackish water 
was reversible: when marine bacteria returned 
to marine water the fraction of active bacteria 
and leucine incorporation decreased, reaching 
values similar to those of the control. However, 
the negative effect of marine water on the 
brackish water community was irreversible. 
After 2 h, when the brackish water bacterial 
community returned to brackish water, the 
fraction of active bacteria and leucine 
incorporation remained stable during the 4 h of 
incubation. 

The positive response of marine 
bacteria to brackish water conditions was higher 
when the salinity of the brackish water was 
artificially increased to 34 psu (Fig. 8). After 6 
hours, the fraction of active bacteria and the rate 
of leucine incorporation were approximately 
50% higher than that observed in the 18 psu 

natural salinity of the parallel experiment. Brackish water bacteria, however, responded negatively 
to the increase in salinity. After 2 h of incubation, the fraction of active bacteria and the rate of 
leucine incorporation were, respectively, 13 and 23% lower those that registered in natural salinity.

Bacterial activity after supplement amendment 

The active bacterial number (determined by the CTC reduction method) did not increase in 
marine and brackish water communities after the addition of different combinations of inorganic 

and organic substrates 
(Tables 3 and 4). The 
initial fraction of 
active bacteria 
determined with this 
technique was very 
small in both zones 
(average 5.0 %) and 
did not change 
significantly after 
substrate additions. 
The fraction of active 

bacteria determined in 
these assays by the 
CTC technique was 
much lower than that 
obtained by 

microautoradiography. Comparative studies had already showed that the CTC reduction technique 
gave a  lower  percentage  of active  bacteria  than  given by  the  microautoradiography   technique

DISCUSSION 
 
Previous work in this estuary (Cunha et al. 2000) has shown that bacterioplankton 

abundance and activity (leucine incorporation, ectoenzymatic activities and glucose turnover) 
follow a curvilinear 
longitudinal profile. 
These variables 
reach maximal 
values generally in 
mid-estuary (20 to 
30 psu) in response 
to a set of 

favourable 
conditions including 
organic matter and 

nutrients 

availability. For this 
reason, it may be 
expected that in this 
estuary section not 
only would the 
number of active 

bacteria be greater than in any other region of the salinity gradient but also their proportion in the 
total bacterial community would increase. The percentages of active bacteria in marine and 
brackish water were, however, very close (average 27.9 % in the marine zone and 25.1 % in the 
brackish water zone) in similar sampling occasions although they could vary within a considerable 
range (6 to 55 % in the marine zone; 8 to 44 % in brackish water). This variation was erratic, with 
no relation to tidal water circulation. The constancy in the fraction of the active bacteria may be 
interpreted as denoting the conservative transport of bacterial cells along the estuarine salinity 
gradient. The alteration in the average level of activity per active cell (19% increase in brackish 
water) would be explained by the observed nutrient gradient. This hypothesis of conservative 
transport is weakened by the relatively long residence time of freshwater in the mid-estuary (10 to 
97 days) and in the outer-estuary (1 to 45 days) (Silva 1994). 

The long exposure of the bacterial community during transport to a less favourable 
environment than upstream may interfere with the spatial patterns of abundance and activity. When 
residence time is long, distinct bacterial assemblages may occur in different zones of the estuary.

Fig. 8: (A) Variation in the fraction of active bacteria (%AB) and in leucine 
incorporation (LI) during 6 h of exposure of marine and brackish water 
bacterial communities to brackish water with natural salinity (18 PSU) or 
with increased salinity (34 psu). (B) Percentage of variation in relation to the 
control of %AB and LI during the 6 h of exposure. November 1999. ---?--
marine water in brackish water with natural salinity (18 psu), ---?---
brackish water in brackish water with natural  salinity (18 psu), ???
marine water in brackish water with increased salinity (34 psu), ???
brackish water in brackish water with increased salinity (34 psu). 

To clarify these two interpretations and in order to evaluate the importance of the salinity 
gradient in the eventual differentiation of estuarine bacterial communities, we looked for 

experimental evidence 
in diffusion chambers 
experiments. When the 
marine and brackish 
water communities 
were exposed to 
reciprocally exchanged 
water they responded 
promptly (&amp;lt;6 h) and 
inversely to the new 
environment. Leucine 
incorporation and the 

fraction of active 
bacteria increased in 
the marine community 
incubated in brackish 
water. On the contrary, 
the brackish water 
community challenged 

with marine water responded negatively reducing leucine incorporation and the fraction of active 
bacteria. Again, this may be associated solely with the higher concentrations of organic carbon and 
nutrients in the microcosms exposed to brackish water. It is underlined that the decrease in salinity 
(from 32 to 16 psu, on average) did not preclude the positive response of the marine community to 
brackish water although the artificial increase of the brackish water salinity to 34 psu produced a 
more intense reaction in the marine bacteria. 

The attempted discrimination between several simple and complex substrates that could be 
more or less involved in the promotion of bacterial activity in the conditions of this estuary was not 
successful. The size of the active community was insensitive to 3 h exposure to any of the chosen 
substrates. These results, confronted with the positive reactions obtained with natural water in 
diffusion chambers, may indicate that a combination of factors may be required to induce bacterial 
activation. The awakening cell activity after experimental stimulation may not, however, be 
detectable through CTC-reduction due to the toxicity of the chemical (Davey &amp;amp; Kell 1996, Ullrich 
et al. 1996, Karner &amp;amp; Fuhrman 1997). 

The reversion experiments in microcosms produced results that were more informative. 
They showed a distinct contrast between brackish water and marine bacteria. After the prompt and

positive response during the initial 2 h incubation in nutrient rich brackish water, the marine 
bacteria, when transferred back to marine water, reverted rapidly to the activity profiles shown by 
the control. In similar experiments with brackish water bacteria exposed to marine water and then 
returned to brackish water, the response was negative, rapid and irreversible in the 6 h course of the 
experiment. This suggests that the high percentage of non-active bacterial cells observed in this 
estuary may result, at least partially, from the impact of the flooding current on brackish water 
bacteria. In fact, at HT, this current brings into the lagoon enough water to increase salinity above 
28 psu in 99% of the total water volume (compared with 35% in LT) (Silva 1994). Alternatively, 
the irreversible negative responses of brackish water bacteria to marine water in contrast with the 
positive and reversible reactions of marine bacteria to brackish water suggest the presence of 
distinct bacterial assemblages adapted to the environmental conditions prevailing in different 
sections of the estuary as also found in other estuaries through genetic approaches by denaturing 
gradient gel electrophoresis of 16S rDNA fragments and by low molecular weight RNA analysis 
(Bidle &amp;amp; Fletcher 1995, Murray et al. 1996). The bacterial reactivity speaks against the hypothesis 
of conservative transport in this estuary.  

 
 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
Most (ca 70%) of the bacterioplankton from this estuary was inactive as revealed by 

microautoradiography. Amendment assays with different nutrients could not stimulate hypothetical 
inactive cells, indicating that this fraction is composed mostly of dead cells. The CTC-reduction 
technique used in these assays may not, however, be the best method to detect incipient activity. 
The small size of the fraction of active cells in the mid-estuary can result from the negative and 
mostly irreversible impact of flooding water on brackish water bacteria as observed experimentally. 

The hypothesis of conservative transport of the upper- and mid-estuary bacteria suggested 
by field data on bacterial abundance and activity in Ria de Aveiro is not sustained by the 
experimental results obtained in diffusion chambers. These results suggest the presence of 2 
different communities: (1) a marine zone community, limited by a short supply of nutrients, 
reacting positively to nutrient-rich brackish water (down to 16 psu) and to high salinities (ca 34 
psu) and (2) a brackish water community, growing in rich water, that reacts negatively and 
irreversibly to salinities above 25 psu. Salinity and nutrient availability seem to control the activity 
of these 2 communities generating an apparently conservative longitudinal continuum.

ABSTRACT: The bacterioplankton density in Ria de Aveiro, a shallow estuarine ecosystem, varied in the 
broad range of 1.9-10.6 x 109 cells l-1. The range of values was about 2 times higher in brackish water than in 
marine water. At high tide bacterial abundance was 2-3 times lower than at low tide. The overall variation in 
virioplankton was in the range of 2.4-25.0 x 1010 particles l-1. Brackish water was about 2 times richer in viral 
particles than the marine water. Near low tide the virioplankton was 2-3 times higher that at high tide. Viral 
density followed the pattern of bacterial abundance (it explained 40% of virioplankton variation). The viruses 
to bacterium ratio varied, throughout tidal cycles, by a factor of about 10 establishing the range 4.7-55.6 
(average 17.6). This ratio was rather similar in the two estuarine zones. We compared the effects of infection 
and predation on the control of bacterioplankton size in the two zones of the estuary. The approach to this 
question was conducted in experimental microcosms, set-up in six combinations of plankton variables 
affecting the presence/absence of predators, virus-to-bacterium ratio (10-fold increase), virus-to-bacterium 
distance (2.2-fold increase), and bacterial growth rate. The results showed that predation was similar, in a 
percent basis, in marine (69%) and brackish water (73%). Viral infection was, however, higher in brackish 
water (59%) than in the marine water (36%). We conclude that the bacterioplankton along the salinity 
gradient evolves under biological pressures that are in different balance in the marine and brackish water 
zones. The effect of viral lysis on bacterial communities with enhanced growth (after yeast extract addition) 
was masked even when the initial ratio was 10-fold greater than in the natural samples. The high density of 
the virioplankton did not preclude the large and rapid increase in bacterial density. We suggest that the 
dynamics of the equilibrium between bacteria and viruses in the environment is driven to higher numerical 
levels during periods of intensive bacterial growth. On the contrary, at low bacterial growth rates the 
temporarily increased viruses–to–bacterium ratio may drive the equilibrium to its lowest levels.

INTRODUCTION 
The growth of bacterioplankton in marine or estuarine water is affected by the 

environmental values of salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, competition for available nutrients 
as well as by predation (12, 18, 27). More recently a new element of the scenario became obvious 
when it was found that viral infection might greatly contribute to bacterial mortality in coastal 
ecosystems (10, 17, 33, 35). It was also found that bacterial mortality by viral infection might reach 
values similar to those of predation by flagellates (10, 34) in the community. Several authors 
reported impacts of viral lysis in the range of 1 to 100% (6, 7, 10, 22, 31). The contribution of viral 
lysis to the overall bacterioplankton mortality depends strongly on environmental conditions and on 
host community structure (36). The small number of the examined aquatic systems and the 
insufficient precision of in situ virus-mediated mortality determinations did not allow the confident 
understanding of the role of the virioplankton as an ecological mediator in the control of 
bacterioplankton density (36). 

The reported densities of virioplankton in coastal ecosystems range from &amp;lt;107 l-1 to &gt; 1011 
l-1 (36) but the proportion of the bacteriophage population in the total marine or estuarine

virioplankton is not established conclusively. It is widely believed (4, 9, 14), however, that they 
represent the major component of the picoplankton. Phage density and infectivity exert strong 
negative pressure on secondary production and respiration rate in bacterial communities (32, 35). 
However, the release of organic matter by viral lysis of different planktonic biota, namely bacteria, 
can be expected to induce the opposite effect when enhancing bacterial production. 

The experimental approach developed in this work was intended to answer the question on 
the control of geographical and seasonal evolution of estuarine bacterioplankton density through 
predation and viral infection and effectiveness of this last factor in counteracting intensive bacterial 
growth. 

 
 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 

Study site 
Ria de Aveiro (figure 1) is a tidal lagoon on the Northwest coast of Portugal separated from 

the Atlantic by a narrow opening. The lagoon covers an area of 66 to 83 Km2 respectively at low 
and high tide (28). It exchanges with the sea a volume of water of 89 Mm3 in tides of 1 to 3 m 
amplitude (28). Several rivers carry fresh water into the lagoon with an average water input of 1.8 
Mm3 during a tidal cycle (2). The Ria has a complex topography, with channels spreading from the 

mouth towards the streams, 
forming a complex estuarine 
ecosystem. Canal de Navegação 
is the main channel, and leads to 
the smaller channels. Here we 
study one of these smaller 
channels, Canal de Ílhavo (with 
a volume of 2.8 Mm3 at LT and 
9.3 Mm3 at HT), that offers the 
advantages of a straighter water 
circulation and a diminished 
impact of agriculture. The 
freshwater supply to this channel 
is at the south end. 

 
 

 

Sampling 
Samples were collected along a longitudinal profile of salinity (Figure 1) during the warm 

season (from early May to early September 1997). Six sampling sites spaced regularly at 3 Km

were established along the longitudinal profile of salinity. The stations were numbered, from north 
to south, as N1 and I2 in the Canal de Navegação; stations I4, I6 and I8 in Canal de Ílhavo and Rio 
Boco (RB, the river). Sampling along the whole profile took place at high tide (HT) and low tide 
(LT). Station N1 ? representing the marine zone (MZ) and Station I6 ? representing the brackish 
water zone (BZ), were sampled further during two different tidal cycles. Samples were collected 
from near-surface water (0.2 m depth) and from deep water (0.5 m above sediment floor), at high 
tide (HT) and low tide (LT) and also at intermediate intervals of 2 hours (HT+2h, HT-2h, LT-2h, 
LT+2h). Water samples were processed within 2-3 hours of collection. 

 
Methods 
 

Physical and chemical characteristics. Temperature and salinity readings were obtained with a 
conductivity meter (WTW ? Wissenschaftlich Technische Werkstätten, Model LF 196). Dissolved 
oxygen concentration, expressed as percentage of saturation, was determined with an oxygen meter 
(WTW, Model OXI 96) equipped with a stirrer (WTW, Model BR 190). The concentration of 
suspended solids was determined after filtration of triplicate 0.5 l water aliquots through pre-
weighted and pre-combusted Whatman GF/C filters. The filters were dried at 60ºC for 24 hours and 
suspended solids calculated as the increase in dry weight. The organic matter fraction in the 
suspended solids was determined as the loss of weight after 4 hours combustion at 525 ºC (19). 
Particulate organic carbon (POC) was calculated as 50% of the particulate organic matter (25). 

 
Biological characteristics 

Viruses. Viral particles were harvested from 8-18 ml water sub-samples fixed in 2% 
glutaraldehyde (final concentration) directly onto carbon stabilised formvar-coated 400-mesh 
copper grids (Labometer). Water centrifugation took place at 28 000 rpm (140000 x g) for 2 hours 
at 20°C in a Beckman L8-80K ultracentrifuge equipped with a swing-out rotor (SW28). Grids were 
then stained with 1.5% (w/v) uranyl acetate during 60 seconds (5). Viruses were enumerated on a 
JEOL 100CX TEM at a magnification of 100000x. View fields were shifted randomly and 100 
microscope fields were counted in each preparation. 

 
Total bacterial number (TBN). Bacterioplankton cells were counted by epifluorescence 

microscopy using a Leitz Laborlux K microscope equipped with a I 2/3 filter for blue light. 
Samples were fixed with 2% formaldehyde (final concentration), filtered through 0.2 µm black 
polycarbonate membranes (Poretics) and stained with 0.03% acridine orange (13). At least 200 
cells or 20 microscope fields were counted in each of three replicate preparations. 

 
Active bacteria number (ABN). Active bacterial number were determined by 

microautoradiography (8) after amendment of samples to 30 nM 3H-leucine (Amersham, specific

activity 58-92 Ci mmol-1). After 5 hours incubation at in situ temperature, samples were fixed with 
formaldehyde and triplicate subsamples (2-3 ml) of each sample (10 ml) were filtered through 0.2 
µm black polycarbonate membranes. The filters were placed, face down, on slides coated with 
autoradiographic emulsion NTB-2 (Kodak) and exposed in total darkness, at 4°C, for 7 days. The 
slides were developed with Kodak Detkol (one-to-one dilution in ultrapure water) and fixed 
(Kodak fixer). The developed autoradiograms were stained with acridine orange solution (0.04%) 
and hydrated in citrate buffer (0.004 M). Microautoradiographs were examined using a 
combination of epifluorescence (as above) and bright-field illumination in a Leitz Laborlux 
microscope. Cells were counted as active if associated with three or more silver grains. 

 
Bacterial biomass productivity (BBP). Bacterial biomass productivity was determined in 

10 ml-triplicate sub-samples plus a control that was fixed by addition of formaldehyde (2% final 
concentration). The samples were incubated at a saturating concentration (30 nM) of 3H-leucine 
(Amersham, specific activity 58-92 Ci mmol-1) for 1 hour, at in situ temperature, in the dark. After 
incubation, sub-samples were fixed at 2% formaldehyde. Protein precipitation was performed 
through the addition of 1 ml 20% ice-cold TCA followed by incubation for 15 minutes on ice. Sub-
samples were then filtered through 0.2 µm polycarbonate membranes (Poretics), rinsed with 2 ml 
5% ice-cold TCA followed by 5 ml of 90% ice-cold ethanol (3). After standing for 3 days in 
scintillation cocktail UniverSol (ICN Biomedicals, USA) the radioactivity was measured in a liquid 
scintillation counter (Beckman LS 6000 IC). BBP was calculated from leucine incorporation rates 
using a ratio of cellular carbon to protein of 0.86 and a fraction of leucine in protein of 0.073 (29). 

 
Chlorophyll a (CHLO). Chlorophyll a was estimated fluorimetrically (37) in a Jasco 

spectofluorimeter after filtration of 0,5 l triplicate sub-samples (triplicates) through Whatman GF/C 
filters and overnight cold extraction in 90% acetone. 

 
Microcosm experiments 

The experimental studies in microcosm conditions was devised to clarify the importance of 
viral infection relative to predation on the control of bacterial growth in marine or brackish water 
communities of the estuary. The plan implied the manipulation of viruses-to-bacterium ratio (VBR) 
and the virus-to-bacterium distance (VtB), through differential dilution of bacteria and viruses 
present in water samples after removal of predators (pre-filtration through 3 µm membranes). 
Differential dilution of bacteria (without modification of viral density) was done with predator-and-
bacteria-free water (filtration of 3 µm filtered water through 0.2 µm membranes). Increase in the 
VtB distance (without VBR modification) implied dilution with predator-bacteria-and-viruses-free 
water (0.2 µm filtration followed by 0.02 µm filtration or microwave irradiation). 



 
Viral infection and predation of estuarine bacteria

Water samples (5 l) were collected at stations N1 and at station I6 from June to September 
1998. To better contrast the conditions in the two sampling stations the water was collected near 
HT at station N1 (in the marine zone) and near LT at station I6 (in the brackish water zone). A 0.5 l 
sub-sample was incubated directly (microcosm 1). The remaining volume was filtered through 3 
µm cellulose acetate membranes to obtain predator-free samples. In order to avoid occlusion of 
filter pores the membrane was changed after filtration of each 0.5 l. Considering the high turbidity 
of the water the risk of large bacterial loss precluded the use of membranes with greater cut-off. 
Even so, filtration through 3 µm membranes decreased TBN by an average factor of 1.8. A 0,5 l 
portion of this water was incubated (microcosm 2). The 3 µm-filtrate leftover was filtered at low 
pressure through 0.2 µm polycarbonate membranes, 142 mm in diameter (A.E.B filtration unit, 
Model S.R.L) to generate predators-and-bacteria-free water. This filtrate was used to produce 10-
fold dilutions of the 3 µm filtrates to be used in microcosm 3. 

In order to obtain predators-bacteria-and-viruses-free water the previous filtrate was either 
filtered at low pressure through 0.02 µm polycarbonate membranes, 25 mm in diameter 
(membranes changed after filtration of 50 ml portions) or inactivated by exposure to microwaves 
(on 19 June, 16 and 23 September). In this case, 50 ml sub-samples of the 0.2 µm filtrate were 
exposed to 650 W emissions for 3 minutes (3 times 1 minute with intervals of 30 seconds in ice), in 
100 ml screw-capped glass bottles (26). The obtained water served for a 10-fold dilution of the 
predator-free suspension (3 µm filtrate) causing the simultaneous dilution of bacteria and viruses 
and originating a 2.2-fold increase in VtB distance without changing VBR. This was the suspension 
present in microcosm 4. 

Replicates of suspensions as used in microcosms 3 and 4 were amended with 0.05% yeast 
extract (final concentration) sterilised through 0.2 µm membrane filtration and autoclaving. They 
were used to induce high bacterial growth rates and constituted microcosm 5 and 6, respectively. 
Table I summarises the set of the six experiments with the indication of treatment, its effect and 
purpose of the experiment. 

Samples of 0.5 l of the six suspensions were incubated in parallel for 24 hours at 20°C, 
under agitation (50 rpm in a Lab-line Orbit Shaker), in 1 l acid-washed and sterilised glass 
erlenmeyers. Sub-samples were taken at time 0 and after 6, 12 and 24 hours (t0 to t24) and analysed 
for total bacteria number and bacterial biomass productivity (in this case only on 16 and 23 
September 1998). 

Bacterial loss by predation after 24 hours (Lp24) was calculated as Lp24 = 100 x (cTBN2 – 
TBN1) / cTBN2, that is, as the percent difference in cell production per initial cell, after 24 hour 
incubation at 20ºC. In microcosm 1, predation and infection occurred at near natural conditions. In 
microcosm 2, the control, predators were absent. cTBN2 (corrected TBN2) corresponds to total 
bacterial number per ml in microcosm 2 at 24h, corrected for the initial difference in density when 
compared to microcosm 1. TBN1 represents total bacterial number per ml in microcosm 1 at 24h.

The correction compensates for the inevitable initial loss of about 40% cells in microcosm 2 due to 
membrane filtration (3 µm nominal porosity). The higher initial bacterial density in microcosm 1 
could cause an earlier depletion of nutrients during the 12-24 hour period of incubation that could 
be misinterpreted as predation. This was not observed, however, as bacteria in microcosm 2 always 
grew to higher densities than the maximum attained in microcosm 1.

Bacterial loss by viral infection after 12 hours (Lv12) was derived from similar 

calculations. It was calculated as the maximum value of infection in the conditions of the 
experiments, that is Lv12 = 100 x (cTBN4 – TBN3) / cTBN4. It expresses the percent difference in 
cell production per initial cell, after 12 hours incubation, taking microcosm 3 as the maximum level 
of viral infection and microcosm 4, the control, as the lowest level. cTBN4 corresponded to total 
bacterial number per ml in microcosm 4 at t12h, corrected for any initial difference in density when 
compared to microcosm 3. TBN3 represented total bacterial number per ml in microcosm 3 at t12h. 
The incubation beyond 12 hours was not considered because viral infection was partially masked

Temperature, salinity, depth, POC, chlorophyll and TBN were used as independent variables. 
SPSSWIN 7.1 was used for data analysis. 
 
 
RESULTS 
 

Field data 
 

Physical and chemical characteristics. A clear salinity gradient was observed along the 
longitudinal profile. In different dates and tides the salinity values ranged from 32.7-35.8 PSU at 
station N1 to 2.3-17.7 PSU at RB. The temperature of the water column varied from 16.3 to 26.0 
°C, increasing steadily from station N1 to station RB. The highest values were reached near LT. 
The water column was generally below oxygen saturation showing only occasional high oxygen 
levels (39-123%). Station I8 was, however, frequently oversaturated (up to 162%). Tidal currents 
did not develop a clear pattern of variation in the levels of dissolved oxygen. Particulate organic 
carbon (POC) varied between 3.0 and 12.0 mg l-1 and was higher near low tide. 
 

Biological characteristics 
Viral density in the estuary 

varied from 2.4 to 25.0 x 1010 
particles l-1, establishing a sharp 
pattern of enrichment from the 
marine to the brackish water 
stations (Figure 2) where, on 
average, the concentration was 2 
times higher. The highest values 
were observed, in general, near LT 

(figures 3 and 4). Viral density was, 
however, rather constant along the 
water column (Figure 3). The 
majority of the viruses showed

diameters of 30-90 nm (average 45 nm). Tail-less viruses were numerically dominant (D and E 
groups in Bradley's classification). Some of them had tails (A and B groups in Bradley's 
classification). The range of seasonal variation in bacterial number was considerable (1.9 to 10.6 x 
109 cells l-1) but, in each sampling date, TBN levels increased only 2-3 times along the profile 
towards the inner section of the estuary (Figure 2). Maximum TBN values were observed near LT 
(Figures 3 and 4). In the marine zone TBN was frequently higher in near-surface water but in the 
brackish water zone the values were constant down the water column. Active bacteria number (1.0-
37.3 x 108 cells l-1) showed patterns of variation that followed TBN curves (Figures 2, 3 and 4). 

The ratio of viruses to total 
bacterial number (VBR) was similar in 
the two estuarine zones but was quite 
variable (up to 12 times) over tidal 
cycles with the overall range of 4.7 to 
55.6 (average 18). Referred to the 
number of active bacteria (ABN 
values), VBR increased to a range of 
25.8 – 323.6 (average 134.0). 

Chlorophyll a concentration 
showed a clear pattern of geographical 
variation with a maximum of 41.9 µg l-1 
at RB (Figure 2). CHLO levels were, in 
general, 2 times higher in brackish 
water than in marine water and the 
highest values were observed near LT 
(Figures 3 and 4). CHLO concentration 
was quite homogeneous down the 
brackish water column but in the 
marine zone the concentration could 
peak at 0,5 m from the sediment floor 
(Figure 3 and 4). 

 
Statistical results 
Stepwise multiple regression 

showed TBN as the variable that better 
explained the viral variation (r2 = 0.40, p &amp;lt;0.001, ? = 0.617). Bacterial abundance and POC 
explained 43% of viral variation (p = 0.046, ? = -0.193).

Microcosm experiments 
During the first 6 hours of incubation, only slight variations in TBN could be detected 

(figures 5 and 6). No net loss was observed during the first 6 hours. Net gain in TBN was evident, 
in different degrees, after 12 hours incubation. 

 
Loss of potential growth in cell 

number due to predation (microcosm 2 
vs. microcosm 1) was clear in both zones 
(Figures 5 and 6). After 12 hours of 
incubation the increase of TBN in non-
filtered water samples (microcosm 1) 
was impaired by an average factor of 
69% (range 60-78%) in marine water 
and of 73% (range 68-78%) in brackish 
water (Table II) when compared to the 
respective microcosm 2. 

 
Microcosm 4 versus microcosm 

3 led to determination of the maximum 
loss effect by viral infection under the 
experimental conditions. After 12 hours 
the loss of bacterial growth 
corresponded, on average, to 36% (range 
30-41%) in marine water and to 61% 
(range 49-74%) in brackish water 
(Figures 5 and 6 and Table II). 

In microcosm 5 and 6, where 
yeast extract was added to samples that 
were otherwise similar to experiments 3 

and 4, the effect of the 10-fold increase in VBR (microcosm 5) was undetectable as it was masked 
by the extraordinary increase in TBN (Figure 7). The increment in density reached a factor of about 
5000 in marine water and of about 1500 in brackish water, regardless of the initial value of VBR. 

The response of bacterial productivity during the period of incubation was clear in all 
experiments. In general, the pattern of variation followed the variation of TBN (Figure 8). In 
microcosm 2, however, the increase of BBP when compared to the values in microcosm 1, 
occurred up to 6 hours earlier in brackish water (duplicating the initial value at t12) than in marine 
water (1.3 increase at t12). Experiment 4 (representing the lowest level of viral infection) led, in the

to those obtained in experiment 3 (representing 
the maximum level of viral infection) both in 
marine and in brackish water. In the 12-24 hours 
period, however, growth was more intense in 
experiment 4, when compared to microcosms 3, 
in spite of the fact that initial bacterial density 
was similar in microcosms 3 and 4. Productivity 
in experiment 3 never reached the values in 
experiment 4. 

 
 
 
DISCUSSION 

The high density of viral community in 
the water column of the estuary (2.4-25.0 x 1010 
particles l-1) immediately suggests a strong 
overall effect on the planktonic system and, 
eventually, a modulation of bacterial activity. 
Electron microscopy showed in this work that the 
majority of the viruses were in the bacteriophage 
size-range (1). This agreed with the observation 
that the pattern of geographical, tidal and vertical 
variation of virioplankton followed bacterial 
abundance as confirmed by regression analysis. 

The microcosm dilution experiments 
were constructed on serial filtration of estuarine water to remove different biological groups. It has 
been commented in the literature (31) that a variable fraction of viruses can be lost by 0.2 µm 
filtration (intended for bacterial removal) due, in part, to particle loads in environmental samples. 
This would result in low filtration efficiency by occlusion of filter pores and/or viral adsorption to 
the membrane (20). In our case, however, 0.2 µm filtration was performed through large 
membranes (142 mm diameter) after 3 µm filtration, in the hope of reducing these unwanted 
effects. 

The biomass productivity in bacterial populations is usually calculated through the rate of 
incorporation of particular substrates. We conclude, however, that bacterial productivity may be 
elusive in terms of bacterial vitality, as it does not distinguish bacterial growth from viral 
replication. This is particularly true when VBR was increased as in our experiments. In this case,

the increment in bacterial number compared to the 
control was, on average, two times smaller at a time 
when leucine incorporation was running at similar, 
or even higher, rates in the experiment. 

 
The experimental data of microcosm 

dilution experiments provided a first approach to 
the relative importance of bacterial infection and 
predation in the estuary as well as to the relative 
impact of viral infection on the growth response of 
bacterial communities. Average bacterial loss by 
predation was similar, in a percent basis, in marine 
(69%) and brackish water (73%). The contribution 
of predation to bacterial mortality fit within the 
ranges reported in the literature (10-80%) for 
coastal systems (10, 11, 30). Average bacterial loss 
by maximal viral infection (in the conditions of the 
experiment) was much higher in brackish water 
(61%) than in the marine zone (36%). The 
contribution of viral infection to bacterial mortality 
in the estuary (average 50%, range 30-74%) was 
higher or slightly higher than the published values. 
The frequency of infected cells (FIC) produced 
values in the range of 2-74% and the median at 
34% (36). The enrichment of bacterial 
suspensions with high-molecular-weight-
concentrates containing viral particles (HMWC) 
increased bacterial mortality by 25 to 40% (21, 
23, 24, 33). The direct determination of viral 
production elicited the calculation of the lysed 

cells fraction as 1-67% of the total (10, 31). Our values are however within the range (25-100%) 
established on calculations of virioplankton loss rate (6, 7). 

 
Bacterial mortality due to viral infection is controlled mainly by the encounter rate between 

viruses and their hosts (16). The efficiency of infection in different environments could depend on 
the numerical ratio between bacteriophages and bacteria. The experimental increase of VBR 
increased bacterial loss in marine and brackish water, an indication that the potential for viral

infection was not saturated in the estuary. We conclude that viral infection may be operative in 
reducing the density of estuarine bacteria below the values determined by nutrient decline and 
predation, a situation that drives to VBR increases. 

 
 

 

 
Any possible effect of viral lysis 

on the bacterial communities presenting 
clear enhanced growth after yeast extract 
addition, was masked even when the 
initial VBR was 10-fold greater than in 
the natural sample. The high density of 
the virioplankton did not preclude a large 
and rapid increase in bacterioplankton 
density. Growth was so great that it easily 

obscured any residual loss by infection. Such a quick response in bacterial density may not depend 
so much on the hypothetical awakening of dormant cells – a slow process – but on the immediate 
intensification of the growth response of already active cells. This implies that, unless other factors 
may come into play, and depending on the size of the food source, viral infection may lag much

behind bacterial growth until a new and higher level of dynamic equilibrium is reached. At the 
other end of the fluctuation process, viruses may control the low-level balance between the two 
communities when transiently increased VBR pushes bacterial density further down.

_______________________________________________________________________________ 
ABSTRACT: The potential export of materials from bottom sediments and salt marshes into the water 
column of a shallow estuarine system of Ria de Aveiro was examined in order to evaluate their contribution 
to the observed high bacterial productivity in the mid section of this estuary. Vertical profiles of physical, 
chemical and bacterial variables were studied in the marine and brackish water zones. Transversal profiles of 
the same variables were studied in the brackish zone only. Although the concentrations of seston (17-241 mg 
l-1), particulate organic carbon (3-15.5 mg l-1) and chlorophyll a (1.2-7.0 µg l-1) varied widely, the vertical 
and transversal profiles were rather uniform. Total bacterial number (0.2-8.5 x 109 cells l-1) and the number 
of particle-attached bacteria (0.02-2.50 x 109 cells l-1) along vertical and transversal profiles did not differ 
much, but bacterial productivity (0.05-14.2 µg C l-1 h-1) and dissolved organic carbon concentration (6.0-69.2 
mg l-1) were frequently higher near the salt marsh margin at the brackish water transect. The increase in 
productivity could not be associated with runoff of particulate matter but coincided with inputs of dissolved 
organic carbon. The results of vertical and transversal profiles point to a minor role of particulate matter 
additions from the salt marsh area or from bed sediments.

INTRODUCTION 

The distribution of bacterial abundance and production in estuarine systems depends in part 
on the location, quantity and quality of the pool of organic matter used as growth substrates (Page 
et al., 1995; Goosen et al., 1997; Cunha et al., 2000). Processes involving external transport of 
materials to the estuary and exchange of materials between the sediment and the water column may 
influence the availability of substrates for bacterioplankton growth (Prahl &amp;amp; Coble, 1994; Goosen 
et al., 1995; Hoppe et al., 1996; Hopkinson et al., 1998; Middelboe et al., 1998). 

The input of large quantities of allochthonous organic matter may exert a strong influence 
on the carbon flow in the microbial food web in aquatic systems (Coffin &amp;amp; Sharp, 1987). In several 
estuaries the external source of organic carbon was observed to be greater than primary production 
(Vallespinos &amp;amp; Mallo, 1990; Findlay et al. 1992). In the case of the Ria de Aveiro, a shallow 
temperate estuary, it has been shown (Almeida et al., 2001b) that allochthonous carbon may 
support a significant fraction of bacterial production in the cold season and also during the warm 
season when phytoplankton activity is potentially sufficient to support the whole bacterial 
production. The high ratio of planktonic respiration to primary production in this estuary (range 2-
17, average 4) also suggests the presence of important sources of allochthonous labile carbon 
(Almeida, MA; Cunha, MA &amp;amp; Alcântara, F, unpublished data). The input of allochthonous organic

matter into this estuary derives in part from rivers and from small freshwater streams but mainly 
from diffuse domestic and industrial discharges (Silva, personal communication). It has been 
reported, however, that tidal runoff from salt marshes may also carry important amounts of 
allochthonous organic matter into estuarine systems (Prah &amp;amp; Coble 1994; Hoppe et al., 1996). 

The accumulation of allochthonous and autochthonous carbon on the bottom of aquatic 
systems, when followed by resuspension can considerably influence heterotrophic processes in the 
water column of shallow estuaries (Middelboe et al., 1998). Resuspension increases sediment-
water exchanges and may result in higher concentrations of organic matter and nutrients for 
planktonic bacteria (Hopkinson et al., 1998; Middelboe et al., 1998). The complexity of the benthic 
compartment, including flow characteristics (Nowel &amp;amp; Jumars, 1984), sediment properties (Mehta, 
1988) and biological activity (Rhoads &amp;amp; Boyer, 1982), influences resuspension kinetics. The 
minimum values of tidal current energy causing sediment resuspension have been reported for 
different estuarine systems (Henriksen et al., 1983; Blanchard et al., 1997). For example Lindsay et 
al. (1996) showed that, in the Ford Estuary, sediment resuspension requires a minimum current 
speed of 0.60 m s-1. Moreover, it has been observed in estuarine systems with relatively high 
current speed that sediment resuspension occurred only in spring tide when the current reached 
speeds of 6.3-8.9 m s-1 (Medeiros &amp;amp; Kjerfve, 1993). On the other hand, Oliveira et al. (1993) 
reported resuspension events in complex shallow estuaries with much lower current speed (0.2-2.0 
m s-1). 

It is recognised that other factors including physical (e.g. temperature, water circulation) 
chemical (e.g. salinity, dissolved oxygen) and biological factors are involved in the modulation of 
the bacterioplankton metabolism (Weisse and Muller, 1998; Shiah et al., 1999; Schultz and 
Ducklow, 2000; Wommack and Colwell, 2000). Physical, chemical and biological factors as well 
as substrate availability interact in the regulation of bacterioplankton activity in such a way that it is 
often difficult to discriminate between individual effects and to assess their relative contribution. 
However, several studies have demonstrated that the variation in the rates of bacterial activity in 
estuarine and coastal systems might be regulated by temperature, with substrate supply playing a 
lesser role (Berman et al., 1994; Griffith et al., 1994; Shiah and Ducklow, 1995). 

Different profiles of bacterial production in the estuary Ria de Aveiro have already been 
studied at the interfaces with the river and with the ocean (Cunha et al., 2000). Stimulation of 
bacterial productivity at the 0.5 meter water layer of the marine zone was attributed to photo-
oxidation of semi-labile or refractory organic compounds and/or to increased phytoplankton 
exudation (Almeida et al., 2110a). The impact of the tide induced changes in salinity was examined 
experimentally and revealed the presence of two broad bacterial communities distributed 
longitudinally in the estuary, adapted either to high or to mid salinity ranges and influenced by tidal 
transport (Almeida et al., 2001c). In this work we intend to outline the effect of salt marshes and 
sediment proximity on bacterioplankton production in shallow waters and to clarify the impact of

these processes on the establishment of the relatively high profiles of bacterioplankton abundance 
and productivity in the mid-section of the Ria de Aveiro. 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 

Study site 
Ria de Aveiro (Figure 1) is a mesotidal lagoon on the Northwest coast of Portugal 

separated from the Atlantic Ocean by a sand barrier. The tidal range at the mouth varies from 0.6 m 
in neap tides to 3.2 m in spring tides (Dias et al., 2000). 
The lagoon covers an area of 66 to 83 km2 respectively at 
low and high tide (Dias et al., 2000). It exchanges with the 
sea a volume of water of 89 Mm3 in tides of 1 to 3 m range 
(Silva, 1994). At the mouth, current speed reaches 0.4-2.4 
m s –1 (Dias et al., 2000). Several rivers discharge fresh 
water into the lagoon with an average total input of 1.8 x 
106 m3 per tidal cycle (Barrosa, 1985). The Ria has a 
complex topography representing a multi-estuarine 
ecosystem associated with different inflowing rivers. The 
different channels are frequently flanked by low salt 
marshes. The main channel, Canal de Navegação, is 
connected with four second-order channels. In this study, 
we chose the Canal de Ílhavo, the smallest of the second-
order channels, 15 km in length, with a water volume of 
2.8 Mm3 at low tide and 9.3 Mm3 at high tide. This 
channel offers the advantage of a directly water circulation 
as compared with the other three small channels that have 
an irregular and complex geometry. Freshwater is 
supplied at the south end by a small river, Rio Boco. 
There is a considerable anthropogenic pressure along this 
channel, via harbour facilities in the outer section and 
aquaculture ponds, industrial plants, diffuse domestic 
sewage inputs in the mid- inner sections. The salt marshes 

along the channel are typically covered by Halimione portulacoides and, among others, by 
Spartina maritima. 

 
 

 

Sampling 
Evidence for sediment resuspension was studied in the marine zone and in the brackish 

water zone of the estuary. Salt marsh runoff was investigated only in brackish water where salt

marshes are more abundant (Figure 1). Sampling took place during the warm season and over 
different tidal cycles at high tide (HT) and low tide (LT) and at intervals of 2 hours (HT+2h, HT-
2h, LT-2h, LT+2h). Station N1 in the centre of the main channel of the Ria de Aveiro, represented 
the marine zone (MZ) and was sampled over six tidal cycles (two in June 1996, two in August 
1996 and two in September 1997), five of them in spring tide and one in neap tide, at four depths 
(0.2 m below surface; 4.5 m, 2.5 m and 0.5 m above sediment surface). Transect I6, in Canal de 
Ílhavo, represented the brackish water sections (BW) (Figure 1). It was sampled over four tidal 
cycles (April and May 1997), two in spring tide and two in neap tide, at two depths (0.2 m below 
surface and 0.5 m above sediment surface). The transect included 4 study sites located between the 
west margin and the centre of the channel – S1 close to the margin, S2 one meter from the margin, 
S3 half-way to the centre and S4 at the centre of the channel. In May 1997, surface and deep water 
samples were also collected at station N1 and at transect I6, only at low tide and high tide, for 
determination of dissolved organic carbon. Water samples were processed within 2-3 hours past 
collection. 

 
Methods 
 

Physical and chemical characteristics. Temperature and salinity were measured with a 
conductivity meter (WTW, Model LF 196). Dissolved oxygen concentration, expressed as 
percentage of saturation, was determined with an oxygen meter (WTW, Model OXI 96) equipped 
with a stirrer (WTW, Model BR 190). Depth of the water column was measured with a Sonar probe 
(Hondex PS-7 LCD Digital Sounder). The concentration of seston was determined after filtration of 
triplicate 0.5 l water sample aliquots through pre-weighted and pre-combusted Whatman GF/C 
filters. The filters were dried at 60ºC for 24 hours and seston content was calculated as the increase 
in weight due to the dried particulate matter retained. Particulate organic matter was determined 
through loss of weight of the dry seston after 4 hours incineration at 525 ºC (Parsons et al., 1989). 
Particulate organic carbon (POC) was calculated as the 50% fraction of the particulate organic 
matter (Rodier, 1996). Samples for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) analyses were filtered through 
pre-combusted Whatman GF/C membranes and maintained frozen. Quantification of DOC was 
carried out by combustion and infrared detection in a Total Organic Carbon Analyser (Shimadzu 
5000A). Chlorophyll a was read fluorimetrically (Yentsch &amp;amp; Menzel, 1963) after filtration of 0.5 l 
triplicate sub-samples through Whatman GF/C filters and overnight cold extraction in 90% (v/v) 
acetone. 

 

Total bacterial number and particle-attached bacteria. Total and attached bacteria numbers 
were determined by direct counting under epifluorescence microscopy (Leitz Laborlux K 
microscope) with a 50 W mercury lamp, blue BP 450-490 exciter filter and LP 515 barrier filter. 
The samples were fixed with 2% formaldehyde (final concentration), filtered through black

polycarbonate membranes of 0.2 µm (Poretics) and stained with 0.03% acridine orange (Hobbie et 
al., 1977). At least 200 cells or 20 microscope fields were counted in each of three replicate 
preparations. 

 

Bacterial biomass productivity. Bacterial productivity was determined in 10 ml triplicate sub-
samples plus a control that was immediately fixed by addition of formaldehyde (2% final 
concentration). The samples were incubated in the presence of a saturating concentration (30 nM) 
of 3H-leucine (Amersham, specific activity of 58-92 Ci mmol-1) for 1 hour in darkness at in situ 
temperature. After incubation, sub-samples were fixed at 2% formaldehyde. Protein precipitation 
was performed through the addition of 1 ml 20% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid followed by 15 
minutes incubation in ice. Samples were filtered through 0.2 µm polycarbonate membranes 
(Poretics), rinsed  twice with 2 ml of  5% ice-cold TCA and 5 ml of 90% ice-cold ethanol (Blight et

al., 1995). After standing for 3 days in the scintillation cocktail UniverSol (ICN Biomedicals, 
USA) the radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS 6000 IC). 
Bacterial biomass productivity BBP was calculated from leucine incorporation rates using a ratio of 
cellular carbon to protein of 0.86 and a fraction of leucine in protein of 0.073 (Simon &amp;amp; Azam, 
1989). 

 
Statistical analysis. The significance of variation in the different characteristics between surface

homogeneous variances (assessed by Levene test) were used. Variation in bacterial abundance and 
productivity was assessed by stepwise multiple regression analysis. Seston, POC, chlorophyll, 
temperature, salinity and oxygen concentration were used as independent variables in order to 
assess the environmental factors that explained bacterial abundance and production. 

 
 

RESULTS 
Environmental conditions. At station N1 salinity varied from 23.7 to 36.1 psu (average 

34.4 psu) and from 5.4 to 34.0 psu at transect I6 (average 26.2 psu). Water temperature varied from 
15.3 to 23.5°C increasing from the marine zone to the mid brackish zone. Oxygen saturation varied

between 39 and 123%. The values were, generally, below saturation in both zones. Salinity, 
temperature and oxygen saturation values were similar along transects and down the water column 
in both zones (ANOVA p&gt;0.05). Water depth varied from 4.1 to 8.9 m (average 7.4 m) at 
stationN1 and from 1.3 to 3.3 m (average 2.3 m) at transect I6.

transect I6, however, the values were, on average, 30 % higher in spring tide. Seston and POC

higher at near-surface water (3.3 times on average). This reaction to surface conditions was not 
observed in transect I6, where bacterial productivity was similar (ANOVA p&gt;0.05) down the water

DISCUSSION 

The origin and degradability of organic matter in the Ria de Aveiro ecosystem are issues of 
great ecological and management interest. It has been reported that estuarine systems with enriched 
sediments and productive flooded margins may develop patterns of tidally induced transfer of 
organic matter and nutrients between their different compartments (Prah &amp;amp; Coble, 1994; Goosen et 
al., 1995; Hoppe et al., 1996; Hopkinson et al., 1998; Middelboe et al., 1998). In the case of the 
Ria de Aveiro, the extension of the bordering salt marshes and the considerable turbidity of the 
mid- and inner-sections of the estuary raised the need for considering the eventual relevance of 
sediment resuspension and runoff in the support of a brackish water bacterial community 3 times 
denser and 3.5 times more productive than the community at the outer estuary. 

When looking for resuspension events, the comparison of deep and surface water at station 
N1 and transect I6 failed to show (in a total of 10 tidal cycles) any evidence for the expected 
effects. In fact, seston, POC and chlorophyll a concentrations were, in general, similar at the 
different levels of the water column. Bacterial density (total and particle-attached bacteria) and 
productivity were also rather constant along the vertical profiles in both zones (excluding the 0.5 m 
surface layer of the marine zone, a phenomenon which is explained by a different logic (Almeida et 
al., 2001a). This was observed even at spring tide when current speed and the area of the flooded 
margins increased. At the marine water, where tidal current speed can reach values of 2.4 m s-1 
(Dias et al., 2000), higher than those required for resuspension in other estuarine systems (Oliveira 
et al., 1993; Lindsay et al., 1996), the nature of the sediments – coarse and medium sand – resisted 
resuspension. Given the sequence of tide induced vertical profiles of seston, the observed increase 
in seston and POC concentrations in deep water at low tide is interpreted as the result of particle 
deposition in slack water. At the brackish water transect I6, the 0.4 m s-1 current speed (Dias et al., 
2000) was insufficient to resuspend even the fine sand sediment or the organic matter that it 
contained – 2% (w/w) (Cunha et al., 1999). 

When the transport of particulate matter through runoff was investigated at ebb tide in the 
neighbourhood of a salt marsh, no evidence could be found along the transect for inputs of seston 
or enrichment in POC or chlorophyll a. Although bacterial density followed this same pattern, 
bacterial productivity increased within the 1 m range from the interface with the salt marsh, 
denoting the presence of stimulation factors. Newell &amp;amp; Krambeck (1995) found also an increase in 
bacterioplankton productivity (2 fold) after tidal inundation of a cordgrass saltmarsh. The authors

94 

interpreted these results as due to the increased availability on nutrient from cordgrass shoots 
and/or the marsh sediment. 

Statistical analysis showed that POC was not a suitable variable for explaining bacterial 
growth variability. Temperature and chlorophyll were the variables that better explained bacterial 
abundance variation (55 % of the variation). Although POC was a variable that also explained 
bacterial density, the relation was negative and only increased the variance accounted by 2 %. 
Moreover, the variation in bacterial productivity was better explained by other variables than POC. 
For instance, salinity and temperature were responsible for 41% of the total variation. On the other 
hand, we had noticed (Cunha et al., 2000) that the increase in POC was associated with the increase 
in ß-glucosidase activity but not with the rate of glucose incorporation. The complex, high 
molecular weight pool of POC fails to stimulate bacterial growth in a short range of time. The 
positive relationship between bacterial productivity and temperature suggests that bacterial activity 
might primarily be regulated by temperature, with substrate supply playing a lesser role as 
observed in other eutrophic and mesotrophic ecosystems (Berman et al., 1994; Griffith et al., Shiah 
and Ducklow, 1995). 

Even though DOC distribution in the water column was not fully characterized, it appears 
to be the major form of organic carbon supporting bacterioplankton production in this shallow 
estuary as already observed in other aquatic systems (Hopkinson et al., 1998; Jorgensen et al., 
1999; Sanüdo-Wilhelmy &amp;amp; Taylor, 1999; Wikner et al., 1999). In fact, DOC concentration was 3 
times higher than POC along the estuary. The data available at transect I6 indicates that DOC may 
be the only contribution of salt marsh runoff (2.3 times increase of DOC at the margin) to the high 
bacterial activity at the mid-estuary although it may have only fringe spatial effects. In fact, the 
rough estimate of the volume of runoff may not support a widespread impact of the ebb tide DOC 
input in the receiving stream. The brackish water sections of the lagoon sum up, depending on tidal 
phase, a volume of water of 51-126 x 106 m3, 2 to 4 times greater than the volume calculated for 
the deeper outer estuary. The flooded margins cover a maximum area of 17 x 106 m2 (Dias et al., 
2000). Considering that the flooding water is no more than 0.3 m deep, the maximum total volume 
of runoff is about 5 x 106 m3 in each tidal cycle, amounting to a maximum of 10 % of the total 
brackish water volume at low tide. The doubling in DOC concentration near the margin of the 
transect does not give enough support to the average 3 and 3.5 times increase, respectively, in 
bacterial abundance and productivity in brackish water; but the DOC may have a positive effect on 
bacterial productivity out of proportion to its relative increase in concentration. 

In view of these results and building on previous studies that revealed planktonic 
respiration to be 4 times greater than primary production (Almeida, MA &amp;amp; Cunha, MA, 
unpublished data), we conclude that most of the organic matter supporting bacterial activity in the 
Ria de Aveiro estuary must be allochthonous. Contributions from the sediment compartment or 
from flooded margins proved to be unnoticeable or localized, without any influence.

CHAPTER 7 

 
DISCUSSION 
Bacterial abundance (2.6-15.3 x 109 cells l-1) and productivity values (0.05-18.6 µg C l-1h-1) 

in the estuary Ria de Aveiro are within the range obtained in other Portuguese estuaries (1.2 to 50.0 
x 109 cells l-1 and 1.19 to 4.83 6 µg C l-1 h-1, respectively) (Barbosa, 1991; Bordalo et al., 1993; 
Caeiro, 1996; Gocke, personal communication) and agree with those determined in other coastal 
waters (Fucks et al., 1994; Gossen et al., 1997; Bouvy et al., 1998; Hoppe et al., 1998). The 
number of active bacteria (0.1-3.7 x 109 cells l-1) falls also in the same order of magnitude 
registered for other coastal waters (Lovejoy et al., 1996; Tuomi, 1997; Kisand and Noges, 1998; 
Kornas et al., 1998; Smith, 1998; Vosjan and van Noort, 1998). The authors have no knowledge of 
any other study quantifying the total active bacterial number in Portuguese estuaries and its 
proportion within the total community. 

In the Ria de Aveiro, as already observed in other systems (del Giorgio and Scarborough, 
1995; Ullrich et al., 1996; Choi et al., 1999; Sherr et al., 1999), a large fraction of the total cell 
count consists of metabolically inactive bacteria that do not participate in growth. Most of the 
bacteria (about 70 %) were apparently inactive. Although it has been hypothesized that the fraction 
of active cells seems to increase in parallel with the productivity of the system (del Giorgio et al., 
1995), in the Ria de Aveiro, where bacterial production increases by a factor of 3.5 from the marine 
to the brackish water zones, the proportion of metabolically active bacteria in the two zones was 
similar. It has been shown, however, that temperature, salinity, predation and viral infection also 
play a role in determining the relative size of the active and inactive fractions of bacterioplankton 
in aquatic systems (Proctor and Fuhrman, 1990; Shiah and Ducklow, 1994; Rigsbee et al., 1996). 
Moreover, the fraction of inactive bacteria did not respond to nutrient amendment within the period 
of time of 3 hours. When different substrates were added to the bacterial communities of the 
marine and of the brackish water zones, the proportion of active bacteria was not different from the 
controls. The bacterial responses were similar when simple inorganic (e.g. phosphate) or organic 
nutrients (e.g. glucose, amino acids, vitamins) were added, or when a complex yeast extract base or 
even phytoplankton exudates (from diatoms of Ria de Aveiro or from a commercial formula) were 
used. The fraction of active bacteria was similar after 10 minutes, 1, 2 or 3 hours of stimulation 
attempts. It was concluded that the large fraction of inactive bacteria may correspond essentially to 
the presence of dead cells. However, these results, confronted with the positive reactions obtained 
with natural water in diffusion chambers, may indicated that a combination of factors may be 
required to induce bacterial activation. On the other hand, the negative results of the stimulation 
attempts could, however, be related with the high toxicity of the CTC (Ullrich et al., 1996; Karner 
and Fuhrman, 1997), which would impair the detection of the awakening of cell activity. We may 
also think that the activation response of bacterial cells may be a slow process that can only be

revealed by CTC-reduction after longer exposures. In fact, Choi et al. (1999) demonstrated that 
substantial fractions (30 to 85%) of inactive marine bacterial cells, in what concerns the electron 
transport system, could become active within 1 to 2 days after addition of organic matter and/or 
increase in water temperature. 

 
In Ria de Aveiro, in the Douro Estuary (Bordalo et al., 1998) and in some non-portuguese 

estuaries (Wright and Coffin, 1983; Kornas et al., 1998) the peaks of bacterial abundance and 
productivity were observed in the mid-section of the estuary. In the Ria de Aveiro, these peaks 
were reported to the absolute size of the active bacteria population and to the intensity of their 
activity rather than to the relative size of the active fraction. Total and active bacterial numbers 
increased between the outer and the mid-section by the same factor (3 times) and, consequently, the 
fraction of active bacteria remained similar in both sections (26.6 %). The factor of increase of 
bacterial productivity was higher (3.5 times, on average). Specific productivity per cell was similar 
throughout the estuary but specific productivity per active cell was 19 % higher in the mid-section. 

 
In the brackish water zone, bacterial density and productivity were constant down the water 

column, as expected for shallow estuarine systems (Ducklow and Shiah, 1993; Fuks et al., 1994; 
Jellet et al., 1996; Talbot et al., 1997). In the marine zone, with the average water depth of 7 m, 
bacterial productivity was significantly higher at surface. Moreover, the stratification of bacterial 
productivity in the marine zone occurred in the absence of significant physical or chemical 
variation down the water column. Although a first approach to the explanation of this fact 
suggested that the increased values at surface water could be associated with phyto- and 
bacterioplankton transport in ebb water, other biological parameters (i.e. total and active bacterial 
numbers and chlorophyll concentration) were relatively constant along the water column. 
Moreover, turnover rate of glucose and ectoenzimatic activity, determined in the same samples of 
the marine water, were also constant down the water column (Cunha MA, unpublished data). Even 
though, phytoplankton distribution could not directly explain the higher bacterial productivity in 
the half-meter layer of surface water, it was found that irradiation may enhance phytoplankton 
exudation (Zlotnik and Dubinsky, 1989; Feuillade et al., 1990) and consequently bacterial 
productivity in this water layer. In addition, the higher bacterial productivity at surface water could 
be stimulated by photochemical transformation of recalcitrant dissolved organic matter into labile 
compounds that may stimulate locally and transiently the growth of active bacteria. Lindell et al. 
(1995) suggest that solar irradiance (UV-B radiation) may cleave recalcitrant high molecular 
weight dissolved organic matter into smaller fractions, and thereby facilitate bacterial utilisation 
with the result of an increased bacterial biomass production. Fuks et al. (1994), in the estuary of the 
Krka River, also found enhanced productivity at the surface layer of the water column, but only at 
one sampling station, a fact that was interpreted as the result of organic matter transformation. It is 



 
Discussion 

 

 99

well known, however, that the exposure to solar irradiance can influence negatively the production 
and metabolism of heterotrophic bacteria by photoinhibition (Pakulski et al., 1998; Pauz and 
Hernd, 1999). The results of Herndl et al. (1993) suggest that bacteria do not adapt to UV-radiation 
as reported for phytoplankton (Helbling et al., 1992). These authors found a reduced activity (as 
much as 40 % reduction) in bacteria after exposure to UV-B, and suggested that this was attributed 
to photolysis of extracelular enzymes. The photochemical transformation of recalcitrant organic 
matter in aquatic systems may then compensate for the loss of enzymatic cleavage of dissolved 
organic matter. In fact, in the Ria de Aveiro the vertical variation of bacterial productivity in the 
marine zone (possibly due to photochemical transformation and/or enhanced phytoplankton 
exudation) was of the same magnitude as the longitudinal variation between the brackish and the 
marine water. 

In the brackish water zone the much higher turbidity that reduced light penetration and, 
consequently photodegradation and/or phytoplankton exudation, may preclude the increase of 
productivity in surface bacterioplankton. On the other hand, diffusion from the close sediment may 
increase bacterial productivity in deeper water and consequently, obscure the increase induced in 
the surface water layer by photodegradation of recalcitrant organic matter and/or phytoplankton 
exudation. 

 
Short-term variation of bacterial production associated with tidal currents was observed in 

both zones of the estuary but in brackish water the fluctuation was not, as evident as in the marine 
zone. The fluctuation in bacterial productivity during the tidal cycle resulted not only from the 
fluctuation in total bacterial number (and active bacterial number), but also from the rapid response 
of active cell productivity to the changing water conditions. The variation associated with the tidal 
cycle was not, then, the result of simple mixing and dilution during tidal transport. The exposure of 
marine and brackish water communities to extremely contrasting conditions (assays in diffusion 
chambers) showed that the marine and the brackish water communities responded quickly and 
differently to tidal fluctuation of environmental factors. A decrease was observed in the fraction 
size of active bacteria and in bacterial productivity of the brackish water community incubated in 
marine water. Contrastingly, an increase in the fraction of active bacteria and in bacterial 
productivity of the marine community was observed when it was incubated in brackish water. The 
positive response of marine bacteria to the brackish water conditions was even higher when the 
salinity was artificially brought to 34 psu. Brackish water bacteria, however, responded negatively 
to the increase in salinity. Moreover, in the reversed experiment the marine community response 
showed to be reversible (bacteria rapidly re-acquired their previous characteristics) but the response 
of the brackish water community was irreversible (bacteria did not recover from the negative effect 
of exposure to marine water). These results suggested the existence of distinct bacterial 
communities adapted to the environmental conditions that prevail at the two zones of the estuary. 



 
Discussion 

 

 100 

The short-term reactivity of the two communities to changes in salinity and in nutrient content of 
the water column is compatible with the hypothesis of activation and inactivation of bacteria during 
tidal transport, and has implications in the interpretation of estuarine profiles of bacterial activity. 

 
The seasonal effects of bacterial abundance and production in the estuary were quite clear, 

with higher values in the warm season, and agree with other observations in other temperate 
systems (Heinanen and Kuparinen, 1991; Di Siervi et al., 1995; Yanada et al., 2000). The different 
climatic conditions were also reflected in the bacterioplankton cell-specific growth rate and in the 
ratio between bacterio- and phytoplankton production. The specific growth rate increased during 
the warm season, as well as the specific growth rate of the phytoplankton, but the ratio of bacterio- 
to phytoplankton production decreased significantly. The seasonal change in this ratio indicated 
that bacterial production might be essentially supported by phytoplankton carbon during the warm 
season (21 % of primary production could be potentially sufficient to support the whole bacterial 
production) but, in the cold season, the total primary production would be either required or even 
insufficient to support bacterial production. In this season the estuary turns into a mostly 
heterotrophic system. 

 
Among the set of variables studied (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, seston, POC, 

Chlorophyll a), temperature was the factor that most influenced bacterial abundance in the estuary. 
Bacterial productivity was mostly dependent on temperature and salinity. In the marine zone, depth 
was also an important factor of bacterial productivity variation as already mentioned. The positive 
relation of bacterial abundance and productivity with temperature and the negative relation with 
salinity and depth help to explain the higher values found at low tide and during the warm season. 
In the brackish water the fraction of the total variation in bacterial density and productivity 
explained by this set of variables was, however, much smaller than the determined value for marine 
water. These results suggest the relevance of other variables, namely the size of the supply of 
authchonous and allochthonous organic matter and the presence of biological control. 

In the Ria de Aveiro the availability of the substrates was one of the main factors of 
bacterioplankton variability. The strength of the bottom-up control by substrate supply varied 
within the system, as found in other systems (Shiah and Ducklow, 1995; Shiah et al., 1999). In the 
brackish water zone, primary production and the estimated allochthonous inputs of organic matter 
were greater than in the marine zone. Nevertheless, when yeast extract was added to brackish 
water, the bacterial community responded intensively and quickly. This suggests that the lability of 
the available organic matter was low and, consequently, that the incorporation of this organic 
matter by bacteria was dependent of lengthy enzymatic cleavage. In the marine zone the addition of 
yeast extract also increased bacterial growth after 12 hours of treatment. Bacterial density reached 
values similar to those obtained in brackish water when added of yeast extract. The marine 



 
Discussion 

 

 101

bacterial community also showed a positive response in situ, increasing significantly the 
productivity at the surface possibly due to enhanced availability of labile organic matter after 
stimulation of phytoplankton exudation and/or photochemical transformation of recalcitrant 
organic matter. On the other hand, the experimental analysis in diffusion chambers showed that the 
marine bacterial community when exposed to brackish water reacted with enhanced growth. This 
positive response was shown to be due to improved throphic conditions and not to the decrease in 
salinity. It was noticed that the marine bacteria response was stronger when the salinity of the 
envolving brackish water was increased from 18 psu to 34 psu. In estuarine systems salinity 
gradients are superimposed on throphic gradients making difficult to distinguish the different sets 
of effects on the communities. 

In Ria de Aveiro, allochthonous organic matter seems to amount to an important source of 
organic carbon. Its contribution to bacterial production was greater in the brackish water zone of 
the estuary. This confirms the results of others authors who found that in the mid- and inner-estuary 
the coupling between bacterial production and primary production was lower than in the outer 
estuary (Shiah and Ducklow, 1995). As mentioned above, during the cold season primary 
production could not support bacterial production. As a matter of fact, the bacterial 
production/primary production ratio varied from 1.0 to 3.6, indicating that other carbon sources 
were very representative in the estuary. In the warm season, although an average of 21 % of 
primary production could be potentially sufficient to support the whole bacterial production, in the 
brackish water zone the estimated allochthonous carbon supply could be responsible for a 
significant fraction (41 %) of bacterial biomass growth. The geographical and seasonal variation in 
the production values showed that, on an annual basis and on a per water volume unit, the balance 
of secondary to primary carbon production was different in the two zones of the estuary. The 
marine zone was a predominantly autotrophic water mass and the brackish water zone was almost 
at balance in the auto- and heterotrophic growth. Other studies revealed planktonic respiration to be 
four times greater than primary production in these estuary (Almeida MA and Cunha MA, 
unpublished data), a finding that supports the conclusion that most of the organic matter supporting 
bacterial activity in this estuary is allochthonous. 

Particulate organic matter is frequently referred as an important source of organic matter in 
estuarine systems (Murrel et al., 1999). In Ria de Aveiro, however, when the transport of 
particulate allochthonous matter through runoff was investigated in the neighborhood of a salt 
marsh in the brackish water zone, no evidence could be found along the transect for inputs of 
seston or enrichment in POC or chlorophyll. The concentration of DOC was, however, 2.3 times 
higher at the margin. These results suggest that DOC may be the only contribution of salt marsh 
runoff for bacterial growth in the water mass. In fact, bacterial productivity increased within the 1 
m range from the interface with the salt marsh denoting the presence of stimulation factors. 
However, the rough estimate of the volume of runoff provided by the total flooded area in relation 



 
Discussion 

 

 102 

to the total volume of the brackish water may not withstand a widespread impact of the ebb tide 
DOC inputs in the receiving stream. The maximum total volume of runoff amounts to only 10 % of 
the total brackish water volume at low tide. Consequently, the input of organic matter by runoff 
could not possibly support the average 3 and 3.5 increase, respectively, in bacterial density and 
productivity observed in the brackish water zone. The input of allochthonous organic matter to the 
estuary derives mainly from diffuse domestic and industrial discharges (Silva, personal 
communication). In fact, along the Canal de Ílhavo there is a considerable anthropogenic impact 
associated with harbour activities in the outer- and mid-sections, aquaculture pounds, industries, 
domestic sewage discharges and small agriculture explorations in the mid- and inner sections of the 
estuary. 

The contribution of organic matter from the sediment compartment through resuspension 
proved to be unnoticeable in the marine and in the brackish water zones of the estuary. At the 
marine zone, where tidal current speed can reach values of 2.4 m s-1 (Dias et al., 2000), higher than 
those required for resuspension in other estuarine systems (Oliveira et al., 1993; Lindsay et al., 
1996), the nature of the sediments (coarse and medium sand) resisted resuspension. At the brackish 
water zone, the 0.4 m s-1 current speed (Dias et al., 2000) was insufficient to resuspend even the 
fine sediments. 

Although the export of particulate materials from bottom sediments was not detected in the 
estuary, in the brackish water zone diffusion from sediments may increase the pool of organic 
matter and nutrients in the water column. Not even in the brackish water zone, where organic 
matter content of the sediments was higher (2.9 % of the dry weigh) than in the marine zone (0.5 % 
of the dry weigh) and the water column depth was low (1.3 m, on average), could be detected 
stratification of bacterial productivity as evidence of enrichment at the bottom. If, however, 
bacterial productivity is strongly stimulated at the surface (as in the marine zone) then the lack of 
stratification had to be interpreted as evidence for significant sediment contribution to bacterial 
production. Experimental approaches to this subjected will be required. 

Even though DOC distribution in the water column of the estuary was not fully 
characterised, it appears to be the major organic carbon form regulating bacterial production in this 
shallow estuary, as already observed in other aquatic systems (Hopkinson et al., 1998; Jorgensen et 
al., 1999; Sanudo-Wilhehmy and Taylor, 1999; Wikner et al., 1999). In fact, DOC was 3 times as 
abundant than POC along the estuary and its concentration was 3 times greater in brackish water 
than in the marine zone. It is also thought that it was the only major carbon contribution of salt 
marsh runoff into the estuary. The negative association of POC with bacterial abundance and 
productivity suggests its considerable recalcitrance in this estuary. The complex high molecular 
weight pool of POC fails to stimulate bacterial growth in a short period of time. The low fraction 
(19 %) of particle-attached bacteria in the Ria de Aveiro confirms the small relevance of particulate 
matter as a source of bacterioplankton carbon. Previous determinations (Almeida and Alcântara, 



 
Discussion 

 

 103

1992) showed even a lower fraction (9 %) of bacteria attached to particles in this estuary and that, 
curiously, the smaller particles showed to be more densely colonized. 

In Ria de Aveiro viral infection may greatly control bacterioplankton density and 
productivity. The high density of the viral community (2.4-25.0 x 1010 particles l-1) in the water 
column of the estuary (18 times higher than baterioplankton, on average) suggests a strong overall 
effect on the planktonic system and, eventually, on bacterial density and activity. It was found that 
the majority of the viruses were in the bacteriophage size-range and the patterns of geographical, 
tidal and vertical variation of virioplankton followed bacterial abundance. The experimental data of 
microcosm dilution experiments showed that the average bacterial loss by maximal viral infection 
(in the conditions of the experiment) was much higher in the brackish water zone (61 %) than in the 
marine zone (36 %). The contribution of maximal viral infection to bacterial mortality in the 
estuary (average 50 %, overall range 30-74 %) was higher or slightly higher than published values 
(Steward et al., 1992; Bratback et al., 1993; Peduzzi and Weinbauer, 1993; Weinbauer and 
Peduzzi, 1995a; Fuhrman and Noble, 1995). The effect of viral lysis on bacterial communities with 
enhanced growth (after yeast extract addition) was masked even when the initial ratio of viruses to 
bacteria was ten fold greater than in the natural samples. The higher density of the virioplankton 
did not repress the large and rapid increase in bacterial density. This unexpected result can be 
attributed to the very rapid growth of non-infected bacteria. In this case, marine viruses would be, 
essentially, selective agents acting on short term temporal fluctuations in the composition of 
bacterial communities but not so much in intensely growing bacterial community. 

The contribution of predation to bacterial mortality fits within the range reported in the 
literature (10-80 %) for coastal systems (Fuhrman and Noble, 1995; Gonzalez, 1999; Posch et al., 
1999) and, contrary to viral infection, was similar in marine (69 %) and brackish (73 %) waters. In 
brackish water, the effects of viral lysis and predation to bacterial mortality were similar but in the 
marine zone predation almost doubled the loss by viral infection. The high level of viral lysis in 
brackish water, where the throphic conditions are richer and where it could be expected to find an 
increased percentual value of active bacteria, may keep under control the size of this fraction, 
which, in fact, is similar all over the estuary. 

Physical, chemical, nutritional and biological pressures are exerted on the bacterioplankton 
and it shows to be in different balance in the marine and brackish water zones of the Ria de Aveiro. 

 
 
COMPLEMENTARY WORK IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE 
 
Summing up all the results of this thesis one can see that important aspects of the 

regulation of bacterial activity in this estuary are still not yet fully understood and some remarks 
can be made towards further work. 



 
Discussion 

 

 104 

Dissolved organic matter seems to play, as expected, a major role in the regulation of 
bacterioplankton activity in the Ria. It would be interesting to follow the spatial and seasonal 
profiles of dissolved organic matter in order to evaluate the relative size of the different sources 
along the estuary. The major composition of particulate and dissolved carbon could be analysed 
against the expression of ectoenzimatic activity as well as against the strength of the exchanges at 
the interfaces. The increased bacterial productivity found at the surface of the marine zone, mainly 
at ebb tide, suggests a degradation process that may gain further relevance if continued to the 
nearshore. On the other hand, some doubts still persist about the occurrence of a similar process in 
the shallow brackish water zone of the estuary. This would turn insulation a major factor of 
bacterial productivity. 

 
Laboratory experiments demonstrated that when the viruses-to-bacteria ratio was 

artificially increased, the virioplankton could play a major role in the regulation of bacterial 
density. In order to draw a realistic picture of the contribution of viral infection to bacterial 
mortality in the estuary it will be necessary to find a way to circumvent the difficulty of separating 
loss due to viral infection from obscuring bacterial growth in experimental cosmos. 

The identification of the bacteriophage fraction in the total virioplankton would bring 
preliminary and useful information on the control of infection. Up to now, it has not been reported 
any attempt to distinguish bacteriophages in the whole of the marine virioplankton. 

 
The marine and brackish water bacterial communities in this estuary responded differently 

and within short-time intervals to shifts in environmental factors. The distinct response of the two 
communities can be interpreted as resulting from intrinsic differences in the composition of the 
bacterial assemblages and/or as deriving mostly from similar bacterial assemblages responding to 
changing environmental factors. Cross-hybridization of genomic DNA of the two bacterial 
communities may provide relevant information to the clarification of this issue. Since viruses are 
host specific, cross-hybridization of DNA of the virioplankton present in the two communities 
would further help to distinguish the alternative hypotheses. 

 
For a better assessment of the trophic conditions prevailing in Ria de Aveiro and in order to 

integrate the processes occurring in the estuary, the construction of a numerical model of the 
system would be decisively important. The distinct estuarine interfaces, namely with the ocean, the 
freshwater and the bottom sediments, are certainly areas of enhanced instability and, consequently, 
of different bacterial activity, deserving further analysis. In this analysis are included, among 
others, the bacterioplankton dynamics, namely in terms of bacterial productivity, size of the active 
bacterial fraction and viral activity.

In 2000, an interdisciplinary study was launched in order to construct the first model of the 
Ria de Aveiro. The project "Water quality modeling of the Ria de Aveiro lagoon (MODELRIA)", 
coordinated by the University of Aveiro, counts with the participation of the Instituto Superior 
Técnico and Hidromod. The validation of the model will take also into account results of previous 
work developed by the University of Aveiro, including the contribution of the microbial 
compartment, an important component of the aquatic food web.
