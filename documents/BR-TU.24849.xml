Resumo 

O petróleo é um dos elementos mais relevantes para a economia mundial, pelo que o 

aumento do consumo de petróleo a nível mundial tem crescido ao longo dos anos. A 

produção mundial de petróleo é superior a três biliões de toneladas por ano, e os stocks de 

petróleo são significativos em muitas regiões do globo. O petróleo não só é uma fonte de 

energia, mas também é usado na produção de muitos químicos, como plásticos e cosméticos. 

A exploração das reservas de petróleo, a transformação do petróleo nas refinarias, os 

derrames e as águas resultantes da limpeza de reservatórios cria volumes elevadíssimos de 

efluentes que, devido à grande produção mundial de petróleo, estão sempre a aumentar. 

Estas águas residuais, com elevadas concentrações de poluentes, necessitam de um 

tratamento, usualmente complexo e caro. Estes factos originaram um interesse crescente 

pelo estudo de efluentes contaminados da indústria petroquímica assim como dos possíveis 

processos de tratamento (biológicos e químicos). 

Um dos grupos de poluentes mais tóxicos que tem sido detectado nos efluentes de 

refinaria são os hidrocarbonetos de petróleo, nomeadamente alifáticos e aromáticos. Os 

hidrocarbonetos aromáticos policíclicos (PAHs) são dos componentes que merecem mais 

destaque e preocupação, devido à sua toxicidade (nomeadamente carcinogenicidade), 

persistência ambiental e resistência à degradação microbiana. Os PAHs de elevada massa 

molecular tendem a adsorver aos sedimentos, o que diminui o seu impacto ambiental, 

enquanto que os PAHs de baixa massa molecular se dissolvem mais facilmente em água, 

sendo transportados para as águas subterrâneas ou de superfície, tendo assim um maior 

impacto ambiental. De entre os 16 PAHs que fazem parte da lista de poluentes considerados 

prioritários pela Agência de Protecção Ambiental dos Estados Unidos (USEPA), foi 

seleccionado para este estudo o acenafteno, cujas fontes principais são as refinarias de 

petróleo e a queima do carvão.  

A biodegradação apresenta vantagens do ponto de vista económico e ambiental em 

relação aos processos convencionais frequentemente usados para remoção de PAHs. Devido 

à presença destes compostos no meio ambiente, os microrganismos desenvolveram vias 

metabólicas para poder removê-los. Os microrganismos que biodegradam estes compostos 

na presença de oxigénio (aerobiose) são conhecidos desde o início do século XX, tendo sido 

feitos muitos estudos de biodegradação de PAHs em condições de aerobiose. No final dos 

anos 80, foram caracterizados microrganismos capazes de degradar hidrocarbonetos em 

condições de anaerobiose, e estudos posteriores demonstraram que estes microrganismos 

realizam degradação por vias metabólicas totalmente diferentes das usadas no metabolismo 

aeróbio. No entanto, a biodegradação em condições de anaerobiose está ainda menos 

explorada e o seu estudo poderá ser importante, uma vez que não há oxigénio disponível em 

todos os ambientes onde os PAHs estão presentes (por exemplo em sedimentos a grandes 

profundidades e em reservatórios de petróleo). 

O objectivo deste estudo é a identificação de um consórcio de bactérias nativas do 

efluente da refinaria da GALP, localizada em Sines, com resistência toxicológica e capacidade 

de biodegradação de acenafteno em condições de anaerobiose. Para tal, foram formulados e 



testados diferentes meios de cultura ricos em nutrientes, sais minerais, aceitadores de 

electrões e fontes de carbono diferentes (glucose e lactato), de modo a promover o máximo 

crescimento anaeróbio das bactérias presentes neste efluente. Foram seguidas duas 

estratégias de enriquecimento da comunidade microbiana. Numa das abordagens, o inóculo 

centrifugado foi adicionado ao meio de cultura num reactor, enquanto que na outra 

abordagem igual quantidade do efluente de refinaria e meio de cultura foram combinados no 

mesmo reactor. Em cada estratégia, a fonte de carbono usada foi diferente: glucose ou 

lactato. Em todos os reactores foi adicionado acenafteno a uma concentração de 100 µg/L. 

Ao longo do enriquecimento o crescimento microbiano foi seguido por medição da densidade 

óptica a 600 nm, enquanto que a monitorização da concentração de acenafteno foi efectuada 

por cromatografia em fase líquida. Foi também realizada a sequenciação do RNA ribossomal 

16S para compreender a dinâmica das comunidades microbianas durante o enriquecimento 

nos diferentes reactores. A comparação dos diferentes reactores permitiu compreender que o 

crescimento da comunidade microbiana não depende da estratégia de inoculação seguida. O 

lactato foi seleccionado como a fonte de carbono a usar nos ensaios de resistência e 

biodegradação subsequentes por promover maior crescimento e biodiversidade da população 

microbiana. A comunidade obtida tinha como phyla maioritários Proteobacteria (68%) e 

Firmicutes (31%), enquanto a minoria era constituída por Actinobacteria (0.3%), Synergistetes 

(0.003%), Thermotogae (0.002%) e Deinococcus-Thermus (0.002%). Em termos de classes, o 

phylum Proteobacteria apresentou com predominância as seguintes classes: 

Betaproteobacteria (56%), Alphaproteobacteria (10%), Proteobacteria não classificadas (1%) 

e Gamaproteobacteria (0.5%). Por sua vez, o phylum Firmicutes teve como classe maioritária 

Clostridia (28%) e como membros menos representados Firmicutes não classificados (3%) e 

Bacilli (0.009%). Os phyla minoritários foram representados pelas classes Actinobacteria 

(0.3%), Synergistia (0.003%), Thermotogae (0.002%) e Deinococci (0.002%). 

Para testar a toxicidade do acenafteno para a comunidade bacteriana seleccionada após 

o enriquecimento, assim como a sua estabilidade, foram realizados testes de resistência, 

onde se testaram diferentes concentrações de acenafteno (100-1500 µg/L). Os reactores não 

inoculados foram usados como controlos de adsorção, para testar a estabilidade do 

acenafteno. Tal como no ensaio anterior, o crescimento da comunidade foi acompanhado por 

medição da densidade óptica a 600 nm e a concentração de acenafteno foi monitorizada por 

cromatografia em fase líquida. Estes testes sugeriram que a concentração mais adequada 

para realizar os ensaios de biodegradação é 100 µg/L. 

Os ensaios de biodegradação tiveram como objectivo avaliar o potencial de remoção do 

acenafteno pela comunidade microbiana na ausência e na presença de lactato, de forma a 

compreender se o acenafteno poderia ser usado como fonte de carbono única pelas bactérias 

ou se a presença de lactato seria necessária. Tal como no ensaio anterior, o crescimento da 

comunidade e a concentração de acenafteno foram monitorizadas. Para caracterizar e 

comparar as comunidades microbianas na presença e ausência de lactato, no início e no final 

do ensaio de biodegradação nos dois reactores, foi também efectuada sequenciação do RNA 

ribossomal 16S. Verificou-se que o lactato é necessário para o crescimento da população 

microbiana e que a remoção do composto é maior na sua presença, sugerindo que a 



 
 

existência de uma fonte de carbono extra é necessária para a remoção do composto pela 

comunidade microbiana seleccionada após o enriquecimento. Na ausência de lactato obteve-

se maioritariamente Proteobacteria (79%) e Firmicutes (15%), sendo que o phylum 

Proteobacteria teve como classes predominantes Gamaproteobacteria (46%) e 

Betaprotebacteria (27%), enquanto o phylum Firmicutes foi principalmente representado por 

Clostridia (14%) e Bacilli (0.08%). Na presença de lactato os phyla maioritários foram os 

mesmos, sendo que Proteobacteria foi ligeiramente mais abundante (84%) e Firmicutes 

ligeiramente menos abundante (6.4%). A principal diferença foi que a classe 

Betaproteobacteria passou a ser maioritária (66%), seguido da classe Alphaproteobacteria 

(14%) e por último Gamaproteobacteria (0.04%), enquanto o phylum Firmicutes foi 

principalmente representado por Clostridia (3.2%) e Bacilli (0.5%).  

A instabilidade do acenafteno verificada através da sua remoção na ausência da 

biomassa em todos os ensaios realizados sugere que a sua remoção na presença da 

biomassa resultou não só de uma acção biológica, mas provavelmente também da adsorção 

ao vidro, o que poderá estar relacionado com a instabilidade que caracteriza os 

hidrocarbonetos policíclicos aromáticos de baixa massa molecular e a sua hidrofobicidade. Os 

resultados obtidos e descritos nesta tese indicam que o acenafteno é um composto instável e 

que a sua remoção por biodegradação só será uma vantagem se os tempos de residência 

nas estações de tratamento para os processos biológicos forem curtos.

Abstract 

The demand for petroleum is always increasing. Therefore, refineries also face an increasing 

problem: to treat large volumes of oily wastewater containing hazardous compounds such as 

polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Acenaphthene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, 

is among the 16 PAHs considered priority by the United States Environmental Protection 

Agency due to its environmental persistence and toxicity. Biodegradation treatment offers 

advantages in terms of environmental protection and costs over conventional treatments to 

remove PAHs from these oily wastewaters. Biodegradation of PAHs is not only possible under 

aerobic conditions, but also under anaerobic conditions. Oxygen is not present in all the 

environments containing PAHs and there are not a lot of studies addressing the 

biodegradation of acenaphthene under anaerobic conditions by microbial communities from 

refinery wastewaters. Therefore, further assessment in terms of the removal of this compound 

was carried out in the scope of the present thesis. 

The aim of this thesis was to identify a consortium of bacteria, from a refinery wastewater, 

that could be able to remove acenaphthene under anaerobic conditions. 

The refinery wastewater used to enrich the microbial community was obtained from the 

GALP refinery, located in Sines. Two different approaches were followed during the 

enrichment in terms of inoculation and carbon source (lactate and glucose). Since the 

microbial community growing in the presence of lactate presented higher growth and diversity, 

it was further addressed in resistance and biodegradation assays. The most abundant phyla of 

the community obtained were Proteobacteria (68%) and Firmicutes (31%). Betaproteobacteria 

(56%) and Alphaproteobacteria (10%) were the classes most represented of phylum 

Proteobacteria, whereas Clostridia (28%) was the most abundant class of phylum Firmicutes. 

Resistance assays were carried out to assess the toxicity of acenaphthene to the 

microbial community as well as its stability by spiking acenaphthene in the reactors at different 

concentrations (100-1500 µg/L). This assay showed that the compound has less toxicity for 

the community at the lowest concentrations and presents some instability. Based on these 

results, it was decided to carry out subsequent biodegradation assays using acenaphthene at 

100 µg/L. The biodegradation assay was performed to assess the ability of the microbial 

community to degrade acenaphthene with and without lactate as an additional carbon source. 

It was observed that acenaphthene is mainly removed in the presence of lactate and that the 

taxonomic profile of the microbial community is different depending on the presence of lactate. 

In its absence, Proteobacteria (79%) and Firmicutes (15%) were the most abundant phyla. 

The major classes of phylum Proteobacteria were Gammaproteobacteria (46%) and 

Betaprotebacteria (27%), whereas phylum Firmicutes was mainly represented by Clostridia 

(14%) and Bacilli (0.08%). In the presence of lactate, the most abundant phyla were similar, 

although Proteobacteria were slightly more abundant (84%) and Firmicutes were slightly less 

abundant (6.4%). The main difference was that Betaproteobacteria became the most 

abundant class (66%), followed by Alphaproteobacteria (14%) and Gammaproteobacteria 

(0.04%), whereas phylum Firmicutes was mainly represented by Clostridia (3.2%) and Bacilli 

(0.5%).  



 
 

The instability of acenaphthene observed through its removal in the absence of bacteria in 

all the assays suggests that acenaphthene removal is not only due to bacterial metabolism, 

but probably also due to its adsorption to the glass of reactors, which can be related with the 

instability and hydrophobicity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of low molecular 

weight like acenaphthene. The results obtained and described in this thesis allow concluding 

that acenaphthene is an unstable compound and that its removal by biodegradation will be 

advantageous only if short residence times are used in biological treatments in wastewater 

treatment plants.

Introduction 

Petroleum plays an important role in the world economy as a chemical and energy supply. Since the demand 

for petroleum is always increasing, the production and discharge of large volumes of oily wastewater is also 

growing. Therefore, refineries face the increasing environmental problem of having to treat large volumes of oily 

wastewater composed of hazardous compounds. In this section an overview of the recent developments 

concerning petrochemical wastewater problematic and treatment is presented. 

 

1. Composition of refinery wastewaters 

The composition of refinery wastewaters varies according with the origin of the petroleum as well as the 

processes taking place during the refining process (Dibble and Bartha, 1979). Generally, these wastewaters are 

complex mixtures of organic and inorganic acids, suspended particles, heavy metals, phenols, oils and greases, 

as well as aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons (Igunnu and Chen, 2013). 

 

1.1 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are between the most dangerous and problematic pollutants, 

according with the Environmental Protection Agency of United States (USEPA). These compounds have many 

aromatic rings, composed of carbon and hydrogen atoms. The stability of aromatic PAHs with less rings, namely 

three and four, is lower than for PAHs with five or more aromatic rings. Additionally, the latter are less soluble in 

water than PAHs with three and four rings and are also more hydrophobic, and consequently have a higher 

tendency for adsorption on particles and sediments, whereas low molecular weight PAHs are easily dispersed in 

groundwater and surface water (Tsai, Kumar and Lin, 2009), leading not only to an environmental problem, but 

also having an impact on human health (Meckenstock, Safinowski and Griebler, 2004). The treatment of low 

molecular weight PAHs is therefore of high importance.  

PAHs are well known for their toxicity, namely carcinogenic and mutagenic properties, and are therefore 

listed as priority pollutants by the US Environmental Protection Agency (United States Environmental Protection 

Agency 2008, Vasilieva 2011, Uad 2010). 

 

1.2 Acenaphthene 

The low-molecular weight PAH acenaphthene (Figure 1 and Table 1) is included in the list of priority 
substances of EPA.

In Table 1 can be observed the properties of acenaphthene, as well as the Chemical Abstract Service 

Number (CAS), log Koc (logarithm of soil organic carbon-water partitioning coefficient) and log Kow (logarithm of octanol-water 

partition coefficient).

One of the most usual ways of acenaphthene exposure is by breathing contaminated air. Acenaphthene can 

irritate the skin and mucous membranes, as well as the eyes. In a 32 days study where rats were daily fed with 2 

g of acenaphthene it was shown that this low quantity led to changes in rat blood, as well as in the liver, kidney 

and lungs. The skin also can be exposed when it contacts with contaminated soil or products that contain 

acenaphthene and others PAHs (EPA, September 23
th 

2014). 

The ingestion of food or drinking water contaminated with acenaphthene is another way of be exposed, and 

can cause acute vomity if swallowed in big quantities (EPA, September 23
th 

2014).  

In aerobic soil and surface waters, acenaphthene biodegradation half-life time ranges from 10 to 60 days and 

from 1 to 25 days, respectively. However, under anaerobic conditons or at high concentrations, acenaphthene 

may be persistent, since it is toxic to microorganisms. With sunlight, acenaphthene is expected to disappear by 

photolysis. In soils, acenaphthene can adsorb to sediments and suspended particles, as well as disappear by 

volatilization, which the half-lifes from a model river and a model pond are about 11 h and 39 days, respectively 

(ToxNet, October 12
th 

2015). 

Even though the PAH acenaphthene is listed as a priority substance and has been found in refinery 

wastewaters at concentrations from less than 0.05 µg/L to 606 µg/L (Benyahia et al., 2006, Philemon and Benoît, 

2013), there are not many studies reporting its removal. The European directive 91/271/EEC applies to the 

collection, treatment and discharge of urban wastewaters as well as the treatment and discharge of wastewaters 

from industries. But in 2000, the European Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) set a “zero-discharge” policy 

in order to control aquatic pollution. Since then, oil and gas companies have been working towards the 

implementation of the “zero discharge” of contaminants present in petrochemical wastewaters (Igunnu and Chen, 

2013). The continuous increase of oil demand combined with more restrictive discharge regulations makes 

necessary the development of effective treatment technologies. 

 

2. Treatment of petrochemical wastewaters 

There are many physico-chemical processes to treat oily wastewater, namely flotation, coagulation, 

flocculation, sedimentation, and sorption with activated carbon. However, all of these processes are unsuitable to 

deal with the removal of the most toxic and effective pollutants (Dibble and Bartha, 1979). For this reason, 

biodegradation of many pollutants has been investigated, since it is effective and a less expensive process to 

remove organic contaminants from oily environments (Dibble and Bartha, 1979). 

 

3. Biodegradation of PAHs 

Biodegradation is a metabolic capacity that microorganisms have to transform or use organic pollutants as 

carbon source (Zhong et al., 2011). Petroleum hydrocarbons are the carbon and energy source of many bacteria 

and fungi, with a wide phylogenetic distribution, that are able to adapt to these types of compounds (Chaerun et 

al., 2004). This process involves the breakdown of organic molecules through transformation into less complex

metabolites and/or mineralization into inorganic minerals, water, carbon dioxide (aerobic) or methane (anaerobic)  

(Haritash and Kaushik, 2009). 

Aerobic degradation implies the involvement of oxygen in the metabolic pathway. Most of the degradation 

pathways of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons have monooxygenases catalyzing oxidation reactions, but there 

are also dioxygenases, enzymes that add one or two oxygen atoms to the hydrocarbons. Relatively to aromatics, 

the degradation ratio is related with the number of rings of the hydrocarbon. The first degradation step for many 

aromatic compounds is the addition of a diol group, which is cleaved afterwards, originating a carboxylic acid 

group that in the case of bacteria is a cis-cis diol. Polyaromatic hydrocarbons are degraded by bacteria mainly by 

the action of oxygenases and dehydrogenases (van der Heul, 2009). 

Many of the metabolic pathways already described for PAHs biodegradation are observed under aerobic 

conditions, whereas anaerobic metabolic pathways are less well characterized (Tsai et al., 2009). In anaerobiosis, 

alkanes and others aromatic hydrocarbons are degraded by the bacterial synthesis pathway of fatty acids. The 

pathway begins with the addition of a carbon fragment to the main carbon chain, leading to a radical mechanism 

for further reaction that reacts with fumarate, forming a substituted succinate that can latter react through 

pathways very similar to the fatty acid degradation. The mechanism of the reaction is still unknown (van der Heul, 

2009).   

Many studies have reported that some hydrocarbons can be anaerobically oxidized when nitrate, sulfate or 

iron reduction, methane synthesis or photosynthesis are coupled to hydrocarbon oxidation. Many aromatic 

hydrocarbons, including acenaphthene, are known to be degraded under anaerobic conditions (Harayama et al.,  

1999). For toluene, all the known pathways include benzoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) synthesis. In the case of Thauera 

sp. strain T1, toluene oxidation starts by benzylsuccinate production from toluene and fumarate. After benzoyl-

CoA synthesis, it is reduced by benzoyl-CoA reductase to cyclohex-1,5-diene-1-carboxyl-CoA. The subsequent 

steps are controversial. On another side, in Rhodopseudomonas palustris, cyclohex-1,5-diene-1-carboxyl-CoA is 

reduced to cyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxyl-CoA, while in Thauera aromatica, it is hydrated to 6-hydroxycyclohex-1-

ene-1-carboxyl-CoA (Harayama et al.,  1999).  

Microbial biodegradation pathways are completely different under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Berry, 

Francis and Bollag (1987) suggested that when microorganisms have an organic carbon source in the quantity 

that they need, their diversity only depends on how available its electron acceptors are, such as nitrate, sulphate, 

and carbon dioxide. Under anaerobic conditions, redox potential (Eh) becomes one of the main factors affecting 

the metabolic diversity of populations in environments like soils, sediments and aquifers. Hambrick, Delaune and 

Patrick (1980) demonstrated that the biodegradation rates of two petroleum hydrocarbons, namely octadecane 

and naphthalene, were affected by the redox potential. In this study, around 22.6% of naphthalene was degraded 

at Eh = 130 mV, while at an Eh of -220 mV the degradation ratio was around 0.62% at the 35-day assay.  

Microbial reduction of NO3
- 
to NO, N2O and finally N2 is called denitrification, where nitrate is the final electron 

acceptor. Denitrification is common in the oxidation of organic compounds, and usually the final product of the 

reaction is nitrogen. Denitrifying microorganisms have been reported in some anoxic environments, such as soils 

and oceans. Denitrification can occur when oxigen dissolved is present at concentrations lower than 10 µM and 

can take part of biodegradation pathways of organic pollutants (Karthikeyan and Bhandari, 2001).  

Mihelcic and Luthy (1988) reported for the first time naphthalene biodegradation under denitrifying conditions. 

The authors analised biodegradation of acenaphthene and naphthalene, at soil-water ratio of 1:25 and 1:50. With 

nitrate in excess, both PAHs were biodegraded to less than 0.01 mg/L in less than nine weeks, where an 

acclimation time of 12 to 36 days in soils not previously contaminated with PAHs was observed. This was not 

observed in soils with a historical of PAHs contamination. These results were also an indication that PAH 

biodegradation using nitrate as electron acceptor depends on the ratio of PAH relatively to the other carbon 



4 
 

sources. Al-Bashir et al. (1990) studied naphthalene biodegradation in a soil-slurry system under denitrifying 

conditions, with an initial concentration of 50 mg/L, which around 90% was biodegraded within 50 days, and with 

the highest biodegradation ratio hitting 1.3 mg/L per day. In a recent study, pure cultures of denitrifying bacteria – 

NAP-3-1 and NAP-4 – were also identified and isolated with the ability to anaerobically biodegrade PAHs, namely 

phenanthrene, naphthalene and biphenyl, where naphthalene relevant biodegradation occurred only in the 

presence of nitrate. The isolate NAP-3-1 was found to be a denitrifier bacteria, because significant concentrations 

of nitrogen were produced, while NAP-4 produced nitrite also at significant concentrations. This was the first study 

reporting nitrate-dependent anaerobic naphthalene biodegradation by pure cultures (Rockne et al.,  2000).      

Sulfate reduction is another pathway of anaerobic biodegradation, also named sulfidogenesis, where 

microorganisms consume low molecular weight organic acids, alcohols, and H2 as electron donors (Karthikeyan 

and Bandhari, 2001). Sulfate reducing microorganisms are strictly anaerobes and they are present not only in 

freshwater and marine sediments but also in soils, besides they are more frequent in the marine environment, 

because there is much more sulfate than oxygen, nitrate and ferric iron in the sediments, being sulfidogenesis the 

predominant terminal electron-accepting progress (Karthikeyan and Bandhari, 2001). Some studies of PAHs 

biodegradation under denitrifying conditions reported that sulfate reduction does not contribute to PAHs 

degradation, which was not reported in sulfate-reducing conditions until 1996, by Coates et al., where not only 

was reported naphthalene and phenanthrene degradation to CO2 under strict anaerobic conditions, which sample 

was sediments from San Diego Bay, California, but also that sulfate reduction was essential for PAH degradation 

in this sample. The same authors also reported the anaerobic biodegradation of methylnaphthalene, fluorene and 

fluoranthene, in the same sediments (Coates et al., 1997), where naphthalene biodegradation was sulfate 

dependent. In sediments from a less contaminated place in San Diego Bay, where PAHs were not readily 

degraded, the authors inoculated the sediments with the cultures of the heaviest contaminated place, and 

observed PAHs biodegradation. These results suggest that sulfate reduction can be used for the treatment of 

marine sediments contaminated with PAHs, where microorganisms that use sulfate as electron acceptor could be 

used.   

It has been suggested that carboxylation is the initial reaction in the anaerobic biodegradation of PAHs under 

sulfate-reducing conditions. Carboxylation leads to the synthesis of benzoate-like analogs, the better substrate for 

activation by coenzyme A binding, which is followed by ring reduction. PAH carboxylation consolidate the idea that 

reductive hydrogenation happens only after the destabilization of the aromatic ring, or its activation by 

carboxilation. If carboxylated PAHs are metabolized by sequential ring reduction and ring fission, as it occurs with 

benzoate under anaerobic conditions, is still unknown (Karthikeyan and Bhandari, 2001).   

Zhang and Young (1997) identified the main metabolites of degradation of naphthalene and phenanthrene, 

which was 2-naphthoic acid and phenanthrene-carboxylic acid, in a sulfate-reducing enrichment culture, which 

also was verified by Meckenstock, Safinowski and Griebler (2004), showing that 2-naphthoic acid is an 

intermediate of naphthalene degradation pathway. More metabolites of the pathway were identified such as 

1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-naphthoic acid, 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthoic acid, hexahydro-2-naphthoic acid, octahydro-

2-naphthoic acid and decahydro-2-naphthoic acid. The reduction pathway is thought to proceed with 5,6,7,8-

tetrahydro-2-naphthoic acid, in agreement with a naphthalene-degrading culture analysis, where this compound 

was found as the major metabolite. Another study of naphthalene degradation, with a marine and sulfate-reducing 

culture, also showed that this was the metabolite of 2-naphthoic acid degradation. This discover indicated that the 

ring cleavage should begin in the beta-position of the carboxyl group of 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthoic acid, which 

results in the production of a compound like a cyclohexane. This is in agreement with previous experiences, 

where two degradation products with a cyclohexane ring and two carbonic acid side chains, respectively, were 

identified (Meckenstock, Safinowski and Griebler, 2004).

Biodegradation of fluorene and phenanthrene was reported by sulfate-reducing bacteria, that growed for 

nearly 4 years with lactate as carbon source in the enrichment phase. Biodegradation ratios were measured in 

mixture and with the single PAHs during 9 days and from day 10 to 21 days. During the process, was observed a 

decrease of the initial sulphate concentration (8.8-17.8%), what means that PAHs were biotransformed 

simultaneously with sulfate reduction (Tsai, Kumar and Lin, 2009). Methanogenesis consists in the conversion of 

low molecular weight organic acids to methane, and it is a strictly anaerobic pathway. The availability of electron 

donors can lead to competition between sulfidogenic and methanogenic microorganisms, since when it is low, 

sulfate-reducing bacteria are predominant at sulphate concentrations lower than 1 mg/L, whereas when it is high 

methanogens are predominant (Karthikeyan and Bhandari, 2001). The degradation of unsubstituted PAH in 

methanogenesis it is not frequent, since only compounds with polar substituents such as naphthol can be 

metabolized (Meckenstock, Safinowski and Griebler, 2004).   

The first step of the anaerobic biodegradation pathway of toluene by Azoarcus sp. and Thauera sp., which 

are denitrifying bacteria, is the addition of fumarate to the methyl group of toluene. This reaction is mediated by 

benzylsuccinate synthase, that removes a hydrogen atom from the methyl group of toluene and add it to the C-2 

atom of fumarate (Meckenstock, Safinowski and Griebler, 2004).   

Yuan and Chang (2007) reported the anaerobic biodegradation of a mix of five PAHs, namely acenaphthene, 

fluorene, phenanthrene, anthracene and pyrene. The authors verified that the biodegradation was higher when the 

PAHs were mixed than when individually assessed. This can be due the higher availability of PAHs, since there 

are many carbon sources available. The effectiveness of the degradation in the mixture was the following by 

decreasing order: acenaphthene (0.2 µg/g/day), fluorene (0.01 µg/g/day), phenanthrene (0.07 µg/g/day), 

anthracene (0.03 µg/g/day) and pyrene (0.01 µg/g/day). The authors also tested the effectiveness of the PAHs 

mixture biodegradation using three different carbon sources, namely lactate, acetate and pyruvate, under 

methanogenic, sulfate-reducing and nitrate-reducing conditions. Comparatively to the inoculum, for all the PAHs 

and all carbon sources, the highest biodegradation enhancing was observed under sulfate-reducing conditions, 

and by last under methanogenic conditions, since the biodegradation was inhibited under nitrate-reducing 

conditions. The order of carbon sources for the biodegradation of acenaphthene under sulfate-reducing conditions 

was the following: acetate (0.54 µg/g/day), lactate (0.49 µg/g/day) and pyruvate (0.41 µg/g/day). The authors 

found that all these carbon sources promote the growth of methanogenic bacteria, leading to degradation 

enhancement in methanogenic conditions. On the other hand, acidogenic metabolism of lactate or pyruvate 

produces hydrogen or hydrogen carbonate, which stimulates methanogen production (Yuan and Chang, 2007). 

Relatively to sulfate-reducing conditions, bacteria that use lactate produce pyruvate plus two electrons as final 

products, while pyruvate action promotes acetate plus two electrons as final products, both of which will improve 

sulfate-reducing degradation (Yuan and Chang 2007), while nor lactate, acetate or pyruvate are carbon sources in 

nitrate-reducing conditions, inhibiting PAHs degradation (Yuan and Chang, 2007). 

 

3.1 PAH degrading microorganisms 

Bacteria from different phylogenetic groups have been detected in petrochemical wastewaters (Haritash and 

Kaushik, 2009, Silva et al., 2013,) and several authors reported their ability to remove hydrocarbons (Lopes-

Oliveira et al., 2012, Mazzeo et al., 2010, Meckenstock, Safinowski and Griebler, 2004). The most efficient 

bacteria present in petroleum that have been reported to remove aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, under 

aerobic conditions, are: Rhodococcus erythropolis, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas 

fluorescens, and Mycobacterium frederikbergense (Steliga, Jakubowicz and Kapusta, 2012). These bacteria are 

members of phylum Proteobacteria, namely of the class Gammaproteobacteria, at the case of Pseudomonas 



6 
 

spp., whereas Rhodococcus erythropolis, Micrococcus luteus and Mycobacterium frederikbergense belong to the 

phylum Actinobacteria. Also Archaea were already described in beach sediments and spilled oil (Roling et al., 

2004). In another study under aerobic conditions of crude-oil biodegradationin soils, Actinobacteria, namely 

Rhodococcus erythropolis and Rhodococcus coprophilus, knowns to degrade hydrocarbons, were found in the soil 

with highest ratio of n-alkanes degradation (81% by the 10
th
 essay day), coincident with the shortest latency phase 

of bacteria (Hamamura et al., 2006).  

Under aerobic conditions, acenaphthene degradation was reported by a strain of Ochrobactrum sp., of the 

class Alphaproteobacteria, three strains of Brevibacillus parabrevis, of Bacilli class (Bao et al., 2012), and also 

Beijerinckia sp. and Pseudomonas spp., belonging to Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria respectively 

(Cerniglia, 1992). Some genes involved in acenaphthene degradation have been reported in the strictly aerobic 

Sphingomonas sp., an Alphaproteobacteria known by its existance in soils, water and sediments and for having 

the ability of using acenaphthene as only carbon and energy source (Kouzuma et al., 2006). Acenaphthene 

degradation, as well as acenaphthylene, was also reported in Beijerinckia sp., which aerobic metabolic pathway 

was reported by Schocken and Gibson (1984). Acenaphthene oxidation is also reported in the following 

Proteobacteria: Beijerinckia sp., of the class Alphaproteobacteria, the six Gammaproteobacteria, Pseudomonas 

putida, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas sp., Cycloclasticus sp., Neptunomonas naphthovorans and 

Burkholderia cepacia, and also Alcaligenes eutrophus and Alcaligenes paradoxus, both of them members of the 

class Betaproteobacteria (Juhasz and Naidu, 2000), and Acinetobacter sp., a Gammaproteobacteria in which is 

characterized the aerobic metabolic pathway (Ghosal et al., 2013). 

McNally, Mihelcic and Lueking (1998) determined that Pseudomonas fluorescens W2, Pseudomonas putida 

KBM1 and Pseudomonas stutzeri SAG-R were able to degrade three and four-rings PAHs under denitrifying 

conditions to undetectable levels. The authors tested Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas putida for 

biodegradation of a mixture of naphthalene (3 mg/L), acenaphthene (3 mg/L), anthracene (0.045 mg/L) and 

pyrene (0.13 mg/L). Both bacteria degraded naphthalene to levels below detection in 6 to 8 h and acenaphthene 

was degraded by both Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas putida after 80 h. Biodegradation under 

denitrifying conditions was demonstrated by the steady concentration of nitrate after 58 h, by the time that all the 

PAHs have been degraded to undetectable levels.  

It has been observed that PAHs degradation, namely naphthalene and phenanthrene, as well as others 

hydrocarbons, is possible under anaerobic conditions by methanogenic bacteria affiliated with Thermotogales, 

Synergistales and Defferibacterales, members of the phyla Thermotogae, Synergistetes and Deferribacteres 

respectively. The bacterium Anaerobaculum hydrogeniformans, also member of Synergistetes phylum (Gieg et al., 

2010) and also Sphingomonas sp., Rhodobacter sp. and Roseobacter sp. are reported as polyaromatic 

hydrocarbon degraders (Meslé, Dromart and Oger, 2013), curiously all of them Proteobacteria, namely 

Alphaproteobacteria.  

Rhodococcus sp. (Walter et al., 1991) and Mycobacterium sp. (Schneider et al., 1996) have been described 

as benzo[a]pyrene degraders (Trzesicka-Mlynarz and Ward, 1995). Clostridium sp. also was reported as 

acenaphthene degrader in a mix of five PAHs (acenaphthene, fluorene, phenanthrene, anthracene and pyrene), 

since the most effective strain degraded completely acenaphthene and fluorene of the mixture (concentration of 1 

µg/g either alone or in mixture), in a period of 72 days (Yuan and Chang, 2007) under anaerobic conditions.

3.2 Factors affecting biodegradation 

Bioremediation, one of the best approaches to clean petroleum contaminated environments, attempts to 

accelerate the naturally occurring biodegradation of contaminants through the optimization of limiting conditions 

(Margesin and Schinner, 2001). 

Bioremediation of a pollutant and its rate depends on the number and type of the microorganisms, nature and 

chemical structure of the contaminants, as well as environmental conditions (Haritash and Kaushik, 2009). 

Therefore, several factors need to be accounted to achieve the successful removal of a micropollutant: pH, 

temperature, oxygen, microbial population, degree of acclimation, accessibility of nutrients, chemical structure of 

the compound, cellular transport properties, and chemical partitioning in growth medium (Haritash and Kaushik, 

2009). 

Temperature is an important factor due to the enzymes involved in the degradation pathway that have an 

optimum activity temperature and consequently this factor influence the metabolic turnover (van der Heul, 2009). 

The low temperatures lead to an increase of oil viscosity, a reduction in the volatilization of toxic short-chain 

alkanes and an increase in water solubility of these compounds, resulting in a smaller degradation ratio at low 

temperatures. Normally, low temperatures lead to a decrease of the enzymatic activity, whereas higher 

temperatures allow microorganisms to reach the maximum rate of hydrocarbon metabolism, which commonly 

occurs between 30°C and 40°C, since above this temperature range hydrocarbons have a higher toxicity for cell 

membranes. In fact, the low winter temperatures were considered the limiting factor in the biodegradation of 

polyaromatic hydrocarbons in estuarine sediments (Shiaris, 1989) and of many hydrocarbons in freshwater lakes 

(Leahy and Colwell,1990). 

Oxygen is the determinant factor for aerobic or anaerobic reaction to take place (van der Heul, 2009). 

Furthermore, oxygen concentration was already identified as the limiting factor for the biodegradation ratio of 

petroleum in soil and the biodegradation of gasoline in groundwater. Relatively to marine and freshwater 

environments, in upper levels of the water column, oxygen concentration is generally high. Moreover, sediments 

are normally anoxic, except for the thin layer at the sediment surface. The oxygen available in soils depends of its 

microbial consumptiom, the type of soil, if the soil is waterlogged or not, and the presence of substrates that lead 

to oxygen depletion. Recent studies showed that microbial consortia from soil and sludge metabolize many 

aromatic hydrocarbons in anaerobiosis, including benzene, toluene, acenaphthene and naphthalene. 

Furthermore, the hydrocarbons removal can be relevant, since at least 50% of benzene and toluene were 

biodegraded in 60 days under methanogenic conditions, and naphthalene and acenaphthene reached non-

detectable levels in 45 and 40 days, respectively, under denitrifying conditions (Leahy and Colwell,1990). 

Was done a study where seven strains of facultative anaerobic nitrate reducing bacteria, isolated from 

polluted soils, were assessed in terms of their potential to degrade hydrocarbons, which five of the seven strains 

were determined as Pseudomonas sp. and the others two as Brevundimonas sp. The study showed that aerobic 

degradation is much faster than anaerobic degradation. Furthermore, only biodegradation of naphthalene and 

fluorene has been observed in anaerobiosis. These were a ten day aerobic and a fifty day anaerobic experiments. 

Bacteria growing in the presence of oxygen were able to degrade 90-95% of the alkanes and a statistically 

relevant degradation of PAHs was not observed. At the 50
th
 day under anaerobic conditions, 20-25% of the 

alkanes were degraded and biodegradation of naphthalenes was between 13% and 18%, while it was 23% for 

fluorene. It was also shown that the degradation of alkanes of intermediate length was higher than the degradation 

of shorter and longer alkanes (Grishchenkov et al., 2000). 

Nutrients are another factor with importance in anaerobic biodegradation. The release of hydrocarbons into 

aquatic environments with low concentrations of inorganic compounds leads to very high ratios of carbon/nitrogen 



8 
 

or carbon/phosphorous, which negatively impact microbial growth. It is known that the concentration of nitrogen 

and phosphorus available for microorganisms limits the biodegradation of hydrocarbons in water environments as 

estuaries, sea, freshwater lakes, Arctic ponds, and groundwater. It was observed that the addition of nitrogen and 

phosphorus enhanced the biodegradation of crude oil and its hydrocarbons in seawater, Arctic ponds and lakes. 

On the other hand, besides inorganic salts of nitrogen and phosphorus are effective in enclosed systems, they 

tend to wash out in experiments ex situ (Leahy and Colwell,1990).  

Salinity also has influence in the biodegradation efficiency and microorganisms present. Normally, higher 

salinity is associated with higher biodegradation efficiency, according with Shiaris (1989), that studied the 

biodegradation of phenanthrene, naphthalene and benzo[a]pyrene in sediments of an estuary. However, other 

studies reported the opposite correlation, namely in hypersalines salt evaporation ponds, in which the metabolic 

rates for hydrocarbons decreased with the increases in salinity, what was determined as a consequence of the 

reduction in microbial metabolism (Ward and Brock, 1979). 

It is thought that pressure is an important factor in the biodegradation of hydrocarbons when we are talking 

about deep-sea environment. There are few studies about the impact of pressure in the biodegradation efficiency, 

since only the studies of Schwarz, Walker and Colwell (1974) are known. The authors analysed the degradation of 

hexadecane by a mixed bacteria culture of deep-sea sediment, at a pressure of 1 atm, and 495 or 500 atm. At 

4°C, there was a biodegradation of 94% of hexadecane under higher pressures in 40 weeks, where at 1 atm the 

same efficiency was reached in 8 weeks, revealing that there is a negative correlation between pressure and 

hydrocarbon biodegradation (Leahy and Colwell,1990).  

In water, the pH is relatively stable. Most heterotrophic microorganisms have an optimal growth at neutral pH 

or near it, so extreme pH values are expectable to negatively impact the effectiveness of hydrocarbons 

degradation. Was tested the biodegradation of gasoline in an acidic soil (pH 4.5), and observed a very low 

biodegradation ratio. However, when the pH was adjusted to neutral values (7.4), the biodegradation ratio was the 

double of the observed in the acidic sample, what unexpectly was not observed with pH values of 8.5 (Leahy and 

Colwell,1990). These results are in agreement with another study of mineralization of oily sludge in soils, where 

the optimal pH was of 7.8, in a range of 5.0 to 7.8 (Dibble and Bartha, 1979). 

A previous exposure of the microbial communities to hydrocarbons is one of the most important factors for 

the velocity of biodegradation in case of exposition to contaminants, which contributes for an enhancement in the 

hydrocarbon biodegradation ability of a community, also called of adaptation. This phenomenon can occur by 

three different but related ways: induction and/or repression of the enzymes responsible by biodegradation; 

genetic changes that lead to the acquisition of new metabolic pathways; selective enrichments of microorganisms 

that are able to use the compound. Many studies have reported not only that after exposure to crude pollutants 

hydrocarbon biodegraders are in bigger number, but also that its abundance is related with the degree of 

contaminantion of its ecosystem. Sometimes, adaptation reflects a higher abundance of certain biodegraders 

genera, but by another hand, it has already been observed that heterotrophic populations have a tendency to be 

diverse and maintain or increase their diversity after a contamination (Leahy and Colwell,1990). 

 

4. Objectives and thesis outline 

The main objective of the work developed and presented in this thesis was to identify a consortium of 

bacteria from a refinery wastewater that is able to remove the PAH acenaphthene under anaerobic conditions.  

This thesis is divided in three parts: Chapter 1 – Introduction - consists of a revision of the state-of-the-art 

focusing on the composition of refinery wastewaters, occurrence and toxicity of PAHs (particularly acenaphthene), 

as well as biological treatment (efficiency and degrading bacteria); Chapter 2 – Materials and Methods –describes 



9 
 

all the experimental details of the work developed; Chapter 3 – Results and Discussion – presents and discusses 

the results obtained at this work. 

Chapter 3 is divided in three main sections. The aim of the first section was to address the best enrichment 

strategy in terms of inoculation strategy and carbon source as well as to identify the most suitable bacteria 

consortium for following experiments. Microbial communities profiles of the raw wastewater and enriched cultures 

were attained by next-generation sequencing and compared. In the second section, the stability of acenaphthene 

and respective toxicity towards microbial growth was evaluated with the objective of establishing the 

acenaphthene concentration to be applied in following biodegradation experiments. In the third section, 

biodegradation experiments were conducted in the presence and absence of an extra carbon source (lactate) to 

evaluate the degrading potential of the microbial consortium under both conditions and assess the respective 

microbial profiles. 

 

Materials and Methods 

1. Chemicals 

The following reagents with the highest purity available (&gt; 98%) were used to prepare culture media: D-(+)-

glucose (Sigma Chemical CO., USA), ascorbic acid (Sigma Chemical CO., USA), ammonium chloride (Panreac 

Quimica SA, Spain), sodium sulphate anhydrous (Panreac Quimica SA, Spain), potassium di-hydrogen phosphate 

(Panreac, Spain), iron II sulphate heptahydrate (Panreac, Spain) calcium chloride-dihydrate (Merck, Germany), 

trisodium citrate dihydrate (Merck, Germany), sodium lactate solution 50% (Merck, Germany), magnesium sulfate 

heptahydrate (Fluka, Japan), yeast extract (Biokar Diagnostics), sodium thioglycolate (ACROS ORGANICS, USA) 

and sodium nitrate (Chem-Lab NV, Belgium). Resazurin (Sigma-Aldrich CO., USA) was added to the medium as 

anaerobiosis indicator. Sodium hydroxide 1 M was used to carry out pH adjustments. 

High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade acetonitrile (Fisher, UK) was used for the 

chromatographic analysis of acenaphthene, as well as for the preparation of stock and intermediate solutions. 

Milli-Q water used in the chromatographic analysis and in the preparation of culture media was produced by a 

Milli-Q water system (Whatman, Nylon, 0.2 µm, 47 mm, Germany). 

 

2. Refinery wastewater 

The wastewater used in the work described in this thesis was collected from the GALP refinery, located in 

Sines, after the flotation treatment of the global effluent, which results from the combination of all effluents from 

the oil refining process. 

 

3. Enrichment of microbial community 

3.1 Preparation of culture medium 

The composition of the culture medium used for the enrichment of the microbial community under anaerobic 

conditions was set based on previous experience in the laboratory (Table 2).

Resazurine was used as anaerobiosis indicator since it is pink in the presence of oxygen and colorless in the 

absence of oxygen. Trisodium citrate, ascorbic acid, and sodium thioglycolate were used as reducing agents, 

while sulphate and nitrate were used as potential electron acceptors of anaerobic metabolism.  

All the components detailed above were weighted in an analytical scale (Sartorius, BP2100S, USA) and 

added to a gobelet where the adequate amount of Milli-Q water was added to achieve the required 

concentrations. Magnetic stirring was used to ensure solubilization of all components, followed by pH adjustment 

at 7.0-7.2 with a 1 M sodium hydroxide solution using a potenciometer (Crison instruments, S.A., micropH 2002, 

Spain). Then, the medium was distributed in 1 L anaerobiosis flasks, degassed under a nitrogen stream, and 

sealed with common flasks caps containing a rubber in the central part. The culture medium was considered 

anaerobic when it was colorless. The flasks were then sterilized at 120°C during 20 min. Lactate and glucose 1 M 

stock solutions were then filtered using 0.45 µm sterile filters (Milipore, Type HA, 47 MM, USA), and added to the 

corresponding flasks (see section 3.2) under anaerobic and sterile conditions to achieve the required 

concentrations. 

 

3.2 Innoculation 

Two different approaches were followed for the enrichment of the microbial community present in the refinery 

wastewater under anaerobic conditions. In the first approach, two reactors containing 250 mL of sterile culture 

medium each were directly inoculated with 250 mL of refinery wastewater under anaerobic conditions using a 

syringe and a needle. These reactors only differed in terms of the carbon source: glucose (reactor A) or lactate 

(reactor B). Since these reactors are composed of 50% culture medium and 50% wastewater, the concentration of 

the components in the culture medium was doubled relatively to what is detailed in Table 2 in order to achieve 

those final concentrations after inoculation.

In the other approach, 1.5 L of wastewater were centrifuged (Labnet International, Inc, Spectrafuge 24D, 

USA) at 4000 rpm during 10 min to concentrate the biomass. The pellet was ressuspended in 100 mL of sterile 

culture medium and then, equally distributed in two reactors containing 450 mL of culture medium each under 

anaerobic conditions using a syringe and a needle. As in the first approach, these two reactors also differed only 

in terms of the carbon source: glucose (reactor C) or lactate (reactor D). In this approach, the inoculum volume 

corresponds to 10% of the total reactor volume.  

All reactors were spiked with the appropriate volume of acenaphthene stock solution to achieve a 

concentration of 100 µg/L. Then, all reactors were incubated in the dark (to avoid photodegradation of 

acenaphthene). Whenever the concentration of acenaphthene was found low, another spike was carried out to 

ensure selective pressure. The assays were performed at room temperature (21.4 ± 0.86) during 17 days (Table 

2). Optical density at 600 nm was measured daily using a spectrophotometer (Biochrom Ltd., Ultrospec 2100 pro, 

UK) to follow microbial growth. Samples of 1 mL were also collected and filtered using 0.45 µm sterile filters 

(Milipore, Type HA, 47 MM, USA) for HPLC analysis to evaluate the variation of the concentration of 

acenaphthene in the reactors. 

Samples were refrigerated at 4°C until analysis. In the 17
th
 day of incubation, 50 mL (10%) of the cultures in 

reactors A to D were individually inoculated in 450 mL of fresh sterile culture media with the same composition 

described in Table 2. A third inoculation was done, using the cultures attained in the end of the second 

inoculation, to remove particles and organics present in the petrochemical wastewater.  

A stock culture was prepared for each reactor. For that, several vials were prepared containing 100 µL of the 

respective microbial culture collected in the exponential growth phase and 900 µL of glycerol. The vials were 

immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen, removed with a tweezer after freezing, and stored at -80ºC for 

subsequent experiments.  

 

3.3 Characterization of microbial communities 

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 16S ribosomal RNA was conducted by Biopremier (Portugal), using an 

Ion Torrent equipment (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), to assess the dynamics of the microbial communities 

during the enrichment. For that, samples of the petrochemical wastewater as well from reactors A to D were 

collected in the end of enrichment. 

 

4. Resistance assays 

Resistance assays were carried out to assess the resistance of the enriched microbial community from 

reactor D towards acenaphthene as well as the stability of this PAH. In this view, these tests gave insights on the 

acenaphthene concentration to be used in subsequent biodegradation assays.  

 

4.1 Preparation of the inoculum 

The inoculum used in this assay was prepared as follows: A stock culture (1 mL) was thawed and 

immediately inoculated in a 10 mL tube containing culture medium with lactate (prepared as described in section 

3.1), as well as 100 µg/L of acenaphthene under anaerobic and sterile conditions. The culture was allowed to 

grow during 24 h (time necessary to achieve maximum growth) in the dark at room temperature. Then, 3 mL of 

this pre-inoculum were added to a 30 mL reactor containing the same culture medium and acenaphthene. Another 

incubation period was carried out during 24 h under the same conditions.

4.2 Assessment of acenaphthene toxicity and stability 

Nine reactors containing 30 mL of the culture medium with the same composition used for inoculum growth 

were assessed (Table 3).  

 

Table 3 - Reactors evaluated during resistance tests. 

Reactors Designation Aim 

A Inoculum + 100 µg/L acenaphthene Test acenaphthene toxicity 

B 100 µg/L acenaphthene Test acenaphthene stability (abiotic control) 

C Inoculum + 500 µg/L acenaphthene Test acenaphthene toxicity 

D 500 µg/L acenaphthene Test acenaphthene stability (abiotic control) 

E Inoculum + 1000 µg/L acenaphthene Test acenaphthene toxicity

All reactors, except reactor I, were spiked with the adequate volume of acenaphthene stock solution to 

achieve concentrations of approximately 100, 500, 1000, and 1500 µg/L. 

 

 

Figure 3 – Reactors used in resistance assays. 

 

These concentrations were set based on the occurrence concentrations detailed in the Introduction section 

[(from 0.05 µg/L (Benyahia et al., 2006) to 606 µg/L (Philemon and Benoît, 2013)], as well as the solubility of 

acenaphthene in water [(3.9 mg/L (ChemSpider)]. A volume of 3 mL of the inoculum prepared as detailed in 

section 4.1 were also added to reactors A, C, E and G to assess acenaphthene toxicity to bacteria, and to reactor 

I to test community growth in the absence of acenaphthene (Table 3). Reactors B, D, F and H only contained 

acenaphthene in order to test acenaphthene stability at the mentioned concentrations. All reactors were incubated 

in the dark at room temperature (21.4°C ± 0.86) during 7 days. Temperature measurements were taken two to 

three times a day. Optical density at 600 nm was measured daily by collecting 1 mL samples; two m easurements 

were conducted for each sample and the average value was determined. Samples of 1 mL were also daily 

collected for HPLC analysis. Standard solutions with the following concentrations were prepared for HPLC 

analysis using culture medium with the same composition of the medium contained in the reactors: 0, 5, 10, 50, 

100, 500, 1000, 1500, and 1800 µg/L. 

 

5. Biodegradation assays 

Biodegradation assays were carried out to evaluate the potential removal of acenaphthene by the microbial 

culture used in the resistance tests in the presence and absence of an extra source of carbon (lactate).  

 

 



13 
 

5.1 Culture medium 

In the biodegradation assay, the culture medium was changed since ascorbic acid, trisodium citrate and 

sodium thioglycolate were removed. This change was based on a study taking place at the same time in the 

laboratory, where this culture was able to grow faster in the absence of these reducing agents. The other 

components of the culture medium were used at the same concentrations (Table 4). 

 

Table 4 - Composition of the culture media used for the biodegradation assay. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5.2 Preparation of inoculum 

The inoculum used in the biodegradation assay was prepared as described in section 4.1. However, a 60 mL 

reactor was used instead of 30 mL and therefore, 6 mL of pre-inoculum were used to inoculate 60 mL reactors. 

Furthermore, the microbial culture was washed before its addition to the biodegradation reactors to ensure the 

removal of residual lactate and acenaphthene since some of the reactors did not contain lactate. For that, 18 mL 

of inoculum were collected at the exponential growth phase and centrifuged at 4000 rpm during 10 min. Biomass 

was, then, ressuspended in 3 mL of fresh sterile medium without lactate, and 1 mL of this suspension was added 

to certain reactors. 

 

5.3 Assessment of acenaphthene removal 

Five reactors containing 60 mL of culture medium were prepared with or without lactate (Table 5). 

 

Table 5 - Reactors evaluated during biodegradation assay. 

 

Reactors B and D were not inoculated to test the removal of acenaphthene in the presence and absence of 

lactate by other mechanisms besides biodegradation. Reactor E was used as the biotic control. This control was 

therefore the only reactor that was not spiked with 100 µg/L of acenaphthene. This concentration was selected for

biodegradation assays based on resistance assays. All reactors were incubated in the dark at room temperature 

(24°C ± 0.5) during 31 days.  

Optical density at 600 nm was measured daily after collecting 1 mL sample from each reactor; two 

measurements were conducted for each sample and the average value was determined. Another 1 mL sample 

was also daily collected for HPLC analysis. Two sets of standard solutions were prepared for HPLC analysis that 

differed only in terms of the presence or absence of lactate and presented the following acenaphthene 

concentrations: 0, 5, 10, 50, 100, and 200 µg/L.  

 

5.4 Characterization of microbial communities 

NGS was carried out as described in section 3.3 to assess the dynamics of the microbial communities during 

biodegradation assays in the presence and absence of lactate. For that, samples were collected from the reactor 

where the microbial culture used as inoculum was grown (taken at time 0 of the biodegradation assay) as well as 

from reactors A and C in the end of the experiment. 

 

6. Analytical Methods 

Samples were analyzed by direct HPLC injection for the determination of acenaphthene concentration using 

a Waters system (Alliance e2695 Separations Module) equipped with a Multi Fluorescence Detector (2475, 

Waters Chromatography, Milford, MA, USA) and a HyperClone 5 µm PAH (250 mm × 4.6 mm) column 

(Phenomenex Inc., Torrance, CA, USA). The analysis of acenaphthene was carried out under isocratic conditions 

with a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min and mobile phase composed of 55% acetonitrile and 45% milli-Q water. The 

injection volume was 50 µL, the oven temperature was set at 40°C and acenaphthene was monitored by 

fluorescence, using emission and excitation wavelengths of 340 and 225 nm, respectively. The detection limit of 

the method is 5 µg/L. 

For each analysis, calibration standards (0, 5, 10, 50, 100 and 200 µg/L) were prepared in the same culture 

medium used in the reactors, with or without lactate, depending on the reactors from where samples were taken. 

 

Results and Discussion 

1. Enrichment assay 

In this assay, two different approaches were followed to attain a microbial community that is able to grow 

under anaerobic conditions in culture medium and that could be used in biodegradation assays. In the first 

approach, two reactors containing sterile culture medium were directly inoculated with refinery wastewater while in 

the second approach two reactors containing culture medium were inoculated with centrifuged biomass. These 

two different approaches were followed to assess if the microbial community originally present in the wastewater 

could adapt to the culture medium composition or needed nutrients from the original wastewater. For that, 

microbial growth rates, as well as the community profiles were assessed and compared. In both approaches, two 

different carbon sources were addressed – glucose and lactate - to determine the best carbon source for the 

microbial growth. Reactors were codified as: (A) 50% of refinery wastewater and glucose, (B) 50% of refinery 

wastewater and lactate, (C) 100% of culture medium and glucose, (D) 100% of culture medium and lactate.

 Figure 4 - Logarithm nepperian of the optical density attained at 600 nm during the microbial enrichment in reactors A to 

D. RW: Refinery Wastewater; CM: Culture Medium  

 

 Figure 4 shows that the microbial growth was faster in the reactors containing 50% of refinery wastewater (A, 

B) despite the initial lower absorbance comparatively with the other reactors (C, D) since i) the exponential phase 

is more pronounced (A: µ=0.06; B: µ=0.05; C: µ=0.003; D: µ=0.001), with a higher maximum absorbance value, 

and ii) shorter lag and stationary phases were observed. Furthermore, a stationary phase is observed between the 

9
th
 and 17

th
 days for reactors A and B. The higher initial absorbance determined at time 0 for reactors C and D is 

related with the high volume of wastewater that was centrifuged and that led to a very concentrated inoculum. 

These results indicate that the adaptation of the microbial community to the enrichment conditions might not 

have been as easy in the reactors containing 100% of culture medium (C, D) as in the other reactors (A, B). 

Therefore, the presence of compounds originally from the refinery wastewater is likely to have supported a faster 

adaptation and consequently, a more pronounced growth since the change in the composition of the medium was 

less drastic. Similar absorbance values were, however, determined at the 17
th
 day for all reactors addressed.  

Regarding the carbon source, the maximum microbial growth was observed with glucose in the reactor 

containing 50% of refinery wastewater (A). However, the decline phase is less pronounced in the reactor 

containing lactate (B) (Figure 4). It seems that although glucose promotes a faster growth, the stationary phase is 

longer in the presence of lactate. Fairly similar growths were observed for the other reactors (C, D), independently 

of the carbon source. 

Lactate has been reported in the literature as a carbon source for some anaerobic bacteria (Hippe et al., 

2003). However, glucose is used to routinely address the growth of many anaerobic bacteria (Grabowski et al., 

2005). 

At the 17
th
 day of the enrichment assay, the enriched cultures from each reactor were separately re-

inoculated in 100% of fresh culture medium (10% of inoculum in culture medium) to remove further components 

from the original wastewater. Growth profiles observed for all reactors after both re-inoculations were similar to 

those observed in Figure 4 for reactor A (data not shown). These results demonstrated that all microbial 

communities were able to adapt to the culture medium addressed despite the different adaptation in the first 

inoculation. However, lactate was found to be slightly better than glucose in these subsequent re-inoculations. 

Even though the microbial growth attained was fairly independent of the approach followed, the most common 

enrichment approach reported in literature is the inoculation of centrifuged biomass (Almeida et al., 2013). 

Therefore, the community attained in reactor D was selected as inoculum in the experiments described in the next 

sections.

1.2 Variation of acenaphthene concentration 

Haritash and Kaushik (2009) reported that the pre-exposure of a microbial community to hydrocarbons is one 

of the factors determining the rate of acenaphthene degradation. Adaptation leads to the increase in the 

hydrocarbon oxidizing potential of the community. Therefore, acenaphthene at a concentration of 100 µg/L was 

added in all reactors at time 0 to ensure the selectivity pressure during the enrichment. Whenever the 

concentration of this compound in one reactor was lower than 20 µg/L, a new spike of acenaphthene was carried 

out to achieve 100 µg/L in all reactors. The variation of the concentration of acenaphthene in all reactors 

addressed is depicted in Figure 5.  

 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 Figure 5 - Variation of C/C0 of acenaphthene in reactors A to D. RW: Refinery Wastewater; CM: Culture Medium. Were done 

the following spikes: 100 µg/L of acenaphthene at t0 and 200 µg/L of acenaphthene at t9. 
 

Figure 5 shows that acenaphthene concentration decreases over time in all reactors. Furthermore, the 

concentration determined by HPLC was generally lower than 100 µg/L in the samples taken immediately after 

spikes conducted at time 9 days for reactors A and B, and time 7 days for reactors C and D. These results 

indicate that the compound might adsorb to the glass due to its high logarithm of octanol-water partition coefficient 

(3.92) (ChemSpider) and/or not be very stable since it is a low molecular weight PAH (Lorenzi et al., 2011). 

Further discussion on this topic will be provided in section 2 and 3 of discussion. 

 

1.3 Characterization of microbial communities 

Next-generation sequencing was carried out to address the differences in the microbial communities at time 0 

(original refinery wastewater used as inoculum) and in the end of the first inoculation in reactors A to D, during 

enrichment. All data from sequencing related to enrichment assay are presented in Tables A1 to A5 in Appendix.

The microbial community originally present in the refinery wastewater (time 0) is mainly composed of bacteria 

from phyla Proteobacteria (89%) and Firmicutes (11%). Gammaproteobacteria class represents 87% of the total 

abundance and includes mostly bacteria from the Moraxellaceae family, which major representatives are 

Unclassified Moraxellaceae (19%) and bacteria from Acinetobacter genus (9%) (Table A1 in Appendix). Although 

bacteria from Acinetobacter genus are strictly aerobic (Li et al., 2015), have been reported in refinery effluents, as 

well as Moraxella sp., the type genus of Moraxellaceae family (Mazzeo et al., 2010). Bacteria from this genus 

cannot make fermentation in the absence of O2, and were expected to disappear during the anaerobic

enrichment, however, the oxygen production by anaerobic bacteria in its metabolism can explain Acinetobacter 

sp. and Unclassified Moraxellaceae presence (Silva et al., 2013).  

Regarding Firmicutes, Clostridia class represents 10% of the total abundance and it is essentially composed of 

microorganisms from Acetoanaerobium genus (7%). The other phyla (Actinobacteria, Synergistetes, 

Cyanobacteria/Chloroplast, Thermotogae, Bacteroidetes, Cloacimonetes and Unclassified Bacteria) represent 

less than 0.6% of the microbial population (Figure 7 and Appendix 1). Microorganisms from the Archaea domain, 

particularly phylum Euryarchaeota, were also identified at a relative abundance of 0.005%. Many authors have 

reported the occurrence of bacteria from phylum Bacteroidetes in oil-polluted environments. According with 

Grabowski et al. (2005), the strain BN3
T 

of Petrimonas sulfuriphila, which is member of the same phylum, was 

isolated from an oilfield. Bacteria from phyla Actinobacteria and Thermotogae have been also reported in coal 

deposits and oil reservoirs (Meslé et al., 2013). However, it is yet unclear how Actinobacteria, which are mainly 

cellulolytic under aerobic conditions, are able to grow in these environments (Meslé et al., 2013), whereas 

Thermotogae scarce abundance could be explained by many members of this phylum growing in anaerobiosis 

through fermentation (Silva et al., 2013). Synergistetes phylum was recently reported in samples of crude oil in 

China (Silva et al., 2013). These bacteria are known as aminoacid fermenters, as well as Cloacimonetes, both of 

them able to transform aminoacids in methane in sintrophy with hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Cloacimonetes 

have been detected in wastewaters, namely the candidate division WWE1 (Waste Water of Evry 1), besides 

bacteria from phylum Cloacimonetes have never been isolated, probably because these are symbiotic 

microorganisms (Chojnacka et al., 2015). Cyanobacteria/Chloroplast bacteria are described in many industrial 

effluents such as refinery effluents. When present, this is the dominant phylum between the algae, what is related 

with the shortage of oxygen and the presence of moderate levels of nutrients (Vijayakumar, 2012) in this type of 

effluents.  

Bacteria from Proteobacteria and Firmicutes phyla were still the major representatives of the microbial 

communities in all reactors after the enrichment, showing that these microorganisms were generally able to adapt 

to the enrichment conditions. However, a noteworthy shift in Proteobacteria classes was observed since 

Gammaproteobacteria (87%) and Betaproteobacteria (51-91%) were major representatives at time 0 and in the 

end of the enrichment, respectively [(Figure 7(a))]. Furthermore, Betaproteobacteria are present in all the reactors, 

being more abundant with glucose as carbon source (51% in reactor B and 56% in reactor D), while lactate is a 

better carbon source to Clostridia [(Figure 7(a))]. Furthermore, the major Betaproteobacteria – Diaphorobacter 

genus – is much more abundant in the reactors containing glucose (75% and 89% in reactors A and C, 

respectively, vs 50 and 54% in reactors B and D, respectively) (Table A2 to A5 in Appendix). Bacteria from this 

genus were detected in sludge from an wastewater treatment plant of a nitroaromatics manufacturing chemical 

industry (Sing and Ramanathan, 2013). Diaphorobacter sp. utilizes yeast extract to grow, which was a component 

of the culture medium used in the enrichment described in this thesis, although in a very low concentration (0.2 

g/L). Furthermore, Diaphorobacter sp. can grow under anaerobic conditions and in the presence of nitrate, which 

was used as electron acceptor (Khan and Hiraishi, 2002). This may explain the predominance of this bacteria 

genus in reactors A to D. In previous studies, Diaphorobacter sp. was also reported in refinery wastewater 

treatment plants as one of the most abundant genus (Silva et al., 2012). In addition, the functional analysis of the 

metagenome of the bacterial community indicated the presence of genes linked to nitrate and nitrite 

ammonification and denitrification (Silva et al., 2012). 

Unclassified Firmicutes are likely to have experienced more difficulties to adapt to the new conditions since 

their relative abundance is higher in reactors containing 50% of refinery wastewater (reactors A and B). Bacteria 

from Tissierella genus are an example of this, since their relative abundance in the presence of lactate was higher 

in reactors containing 50% of refinery wastewater (8% vs 0.7%). Furthermore, the abundance of Acetoanaerobium 



20 
 

genus was reduced from 7% to 0.001% (reactor A) or 0% (reactors B to D), showing that these bacteria were not 

favored by enrichment conditions. Since, according to Sleat et al. (1985) these microorganisms use yeast extract 

and glucose as carbon sources, other nutrients for their growth could be necessary. 

Regarding bacteria present as minority, a reduction in diversity was observed in all reactors during 

enrichment and their abundances were lower than 0.09% in all reactors [(Figure 6(b))]. Bacteria from phylum 

Deinococcus-Thermus were only detected in reactor D. This phylum is described in sea-water processing 

wastewater treatment plants, however varies significantly in abundance depending on the wastewater tested 

(Sanchez et al., 2011). Members of Archaea domain, which produces methane by acetate or H2 comsumption, 

have been reported not only in formation waters (Silva et al., 2013), but also have been reported as predominant 

in produced water, between them Methanobacterium sp. (56%), where was verified that the methane production 

was in agreement with the disappearing of more than 50% of the hydrocarbons, which aromatic used were 

methylnaphthalene, dimethylnaphthalene, phenanthrene and methylanthracene (Berdugo-Clavijo and Gieg, 

2014). These data show that the growth of microorganisms from the Archaea domain was not favored by the 

enrichment conditions because the culture medium used had glucose or lactate and yeast extract, which are more 

complex carbon sources than acetate or H2. 

Figure 6 and Figure 7 show that the different enrichment strategies in terms of inoculation did not impact 

significantly communities profiles although changes were observed comparatively with t0. 

 

2. Resistance assays 

The objectives of resistance assays were to test the toxicity of acenaphthene to the microbial community and 

test the stability of acenaphthene in the culture medium. The concentrations addressed were chosen based on the 

solubility of acenaphthene in water [(3.9 mg/L (Cerniglia, 1992)] as well as on the occurrence concentrations in 

refinery wastewaters reported in literature that varied between less than 0.05 µg/L (Benyahia, Abdulkarim and 

Embaby, 2006) and 606 µg/L (Philemon and Benoît, 2013). The objective in the assessment of concentrations 

above these values (1000 and 1500 µg/L) was to mimic real conditions and ensure complete solubility of 

acenaphthene, limiting its adsorption to the reactor walls. 

 

2.1 Microbial growth 

Figure 8 shows the growth of the culture in the presence of different concentrations of acenaphthene, where 

it is represented not only the bacterial growth over the 8 days, but also the optical density of the reactors without 

cells at different concentrations of acenaphthene (abiotic controls).

containing inoculum as well as in the respective abiotic controls at different acenaphthene concentrations (100, 500, 1000, and 
1500 µg/L). 

 

The culture medium prepared for this assay presented a brown colour, which could be related with an excess 

of iron. During the experiment, the colour of the culture medium in the control reactors got more transparent, 

which might explain the decrease of the optical density over time in these reactors. Reactions between the iron 

and the reducing agents may have occurred and might explain these differences in color and optical density.

At the different concentrations tested the obtained values representing the removal of acenaphthene were 

similar. Furthermore, the similar removal of acenaphthene in the absence and presence of the inoculum, 

particularly in the end of the experiment [(Figure 9(a) to (d))], shows that its removal is probably related with its 

instability as previously discussed in section 1.2. Tsai, Kumar and Lin (2009) tested fluorene and phenanthrene 

biodegradation by a mesophilic sulfate reducing bacterial culture, with lactate as carbon source, isolated from 

anaerobic swine wastewater sludge, and observed adsorption in the abiotic controls, comproving that PAHs are 

very unstable. Furthermore, Edwards et al., (2011) reported that total petroleum hydrocarbons at a concentration 

of 1.9 mg/L, had a small half-life mainly due to variables like evaporation, photo-oxidation and physical dispersion 

than due to biodegradation. Combining these results with the fact that the lowest concentrations addressed are 

more realistic in terms of occurrence in refinery wastewaters and have a lower impact on microbial growth, the 

concentration of 100 µg/L was selected for the biodegradation studies described in section 3. 

 

3. Biodegradation assay 

The objective of this assay was to evaluate acenaphthene biodegradation in the presence and absence of an 

extra carbon source, in this case lactate, by the reasons mentioned in section 1. The capacity of the microbial 

community to use acenaphthene as sole carbon source was assessed when lactate was not added to the medium. 

Microbial growth rates and the community profiles were compared to characterize the microbial population and to 

evaluate which members of the microbial population could be the most probable candidates of being enrolled in the 

degradation of the compound. Reactors were prepared and were codified as: (A) PAH + Inoculum + Lactate, (B) PAH 

+ Lactate, (C) PAH + Inoculum, (D) PAH and (E) Inoculum in culture medium without lactate.

Figure 10 –Microbial growth curves attained at 600 nm: (a) in reactors A to E; (b) in reactors C to E. 

 

Figure 10(a) shows that, in the presence of lactate, the exponential phase is very short, and the microbial 

community grows very fast, reaching optical densities higher than the ones attained without the supplementation 

of lactate. In the negative controls (reactor B and D), the optical density was always constant and very low, which 

was expected since the inoculum was not added in these reactors and acenaphthene doesn?t absorb at 600 nm.  

In the experiments using acenaphthene as only carbon source [(Figure 10(b))], an exponential phase was not 

noteworthy. The slight increase in the growth of bacteria in the absence of lactate during the initial 24 h period was

probably due to the residual amount of yeast extract present in the medium. These results suggest that lactate is 

easier to metabolize by bacteria than acenaphthene. In fact, acenaphthene is an aromatic compound with a more 

difficult structure to breakdown. Majumder et al. (2014) determined that after degradation of hydrocarbons present 

in a refinery wastewater, aromatic compounds were found in higher concentrations than aliphatic compounds.  

The growth observed in the presence of lactate during the biodegradation assay was faster than the growth 

observed during the enrichment phase (See Figure 4) since, according with data attained in the laboratory, the 

absence of the reducing agents (trisodium citrate, ascorbic acid, sodium thioglycolate) in the medium favors the 

growth of this microbial community. Therefore, some of these agents may have some inhibitory effect on the 

growth of some bacteria.  

 

3.2 Assessment of acenaphthene removal 

The concentration of acenaphthene was followed over a 31 days assay to assess the ability of the 

microbial community to biodegrade acenaphthene. The variation of the concentration of acenaphthene is 

depicted in Figure 11.  

Figure 11 – Variation of the concentration (C/C0) of acenaphthene: (a) in reactors A to D (b) in reactors A to D from t0 to t3 
of the assay. 

 

Figure 11(a) shows that, as observed in the enrichment assay (see section 1.2), acenaphthene concentration 

decreases over time in all reactors, even in the absence of the inoculum. This decrease is particularly pronounced 

during the initial 10-15 days period. These data is in accordance with data shown in the previous sections of the 

Results and Discussion chapter (Figure 5 and Figure 9), supporting the instability of acenaphthene in controls that 

results in similar removals in the presence and absence of the microbial community. Nevertheless, the removal of 

acenaphthene was slightly faster in the presence of lactate in the initial stage of the experiment (initial 3 days), 

since with lactate as carbon source (Reactor A) the percentage of remotion hits a maximum of 61% at t2, whereas 

with acenaphthene as only carbon source (Reactor C) the percentage of remotion hits a lower maximum (47%), 

only at t3. By another hand, in the controls the maximum percentage of remotion it is very similar, which is of 24% 

in Reactor B and of 27% in reactor D, both of them hitting the maximum at t3, what shows that lactate does not 

influence the adsorption of acenaphthene. From the 13
rd

 day of the assay the percentage of remotion it is similar 

in all reactors. These data suggest that bioremoval might have occurred at some extent either because of the 

production of cellular machinery to degrade the compound or due to the adsorption of acenaphthene to the 

microorganisms when microbial population reached a certain concentration (after 24 h). A combination of both 

mechanisms could also have occured. This feature also explains the higher removal of acenaphthene in the 

presence of lactate (Reactor A), where the microbial growth is much more pronounced as previously discussed.

A study done with phenanthrene, where a culture was isolated from the anaerobic sludge of swine 

wastewater, reported that the compound disappeared by biodegradation or biosorption, with the highest 

percentage of biosorption in the biotic reactor at the highest initial concentration of phenanthrene. The authors 

concluded that highest the concentration of the PAH, highest is the biosorption (Tsai et al., 2009). In another study 

where phenanthrene was used as a model PAH, it was analyzed how much biosorption contributes to 

biodegradation. The main conclusion was that PAH biosorption may be important for wastewater refinery 

treatment systems (Stringfellow and Alvarez-Cohen, 1999). 

When exposed to PAHs, bacteria biodegraders amplify genes involved in acenaphthene metabolism which 

according with Haritash and Kaushik (2009), can occur through selective enrichment or gene transfer. On the 

other hand, the addition of an extra carbon source may enhance the biodegradation ratio by stimulating the growth 

of biodegraders microorganisms, known as „biostimulation?, which was already reported for lactate, explaining the 

slightly higher degradation observed in its presence in this study (Haritash and Kaushik, 2009).  

As an attempt to better understand the removal of acenaphthene in the presence and absence of the 

microbial community, the Estimation Programs Interface (EPI Suite)™, developed by the Environmental Protection 

Agency, was used. This program estimates physical and chemical properties of several organic compounds as 

well as their environmental fate properties, which can indicate where a chemical can be found in the environment 

and how long it is expected to remain there. PAHs have many ways of dispersion such as volatilization, photo-

oxidation, chemical oxidation, adsorption on sediments and microbial degradation (Haritash and Kaushik, 2009). 

According with BIOWIN 7, the Anaerobic Probability Model used by EPI Suite, the probability of acenaphthene to 

be biodegraded under anaerobic conditions is very low – 0.0199, which is relatively in line with data shown in 

Figure 11 for the reactors containing the microbial community. 

Table 6 show the fugacity of acenaphthene in air, water, soil, and sediments in terms of distribution and half-

life, according with the Level II Fugacity Model integrated in the EPI Suite.  

 

Table 6 - Distribution of acenaphthene in air, water, soil and sediments. 

 Mass Amount (%) Half Life (hours) 

Air                0.278                4.43 

Water 11.7 900 

Soil 84.6 1.8x10
3
 

Sediment 3.4 1.8x10
3
 

 

Data shown in Table 6 show that acenaphthene is expected to strongly adsorb on soil and sediments and is, 

therefore, expected to be adsorbed on the glass walls of the reactors. Combining these data with the previous 

discussion regarding the high log Kow of acenaphthene, the removal of this compound in the negative control 

might be due to its ability to rather adsorb to other elements than remain soluble in water. This also corroborates 

the fact that the concentration determined after each spike was lower than the concentration effectively expected, 

even in the negative controls. Looking at the compound half-life in water (900 h; approximately 38 days) as well as 

the removal of acenaphthene by the microorganisms in the initial stages of the process [(Figure(b))], a further 

optimized anaerobic biodegradation process could be advantageous in case residential times in wastewater 

treatment plants are not long.  

 The results attained show that, despite the significant acenaphthene removal due to its instability in water, 

this compound is still a problem because of its persistence since it remains in sediments of treated effluents. 

Chemical processes could be better treatment options since the accessibility of the compound to microorganisms 

(due to high adsorption and instability) would not be a problem.

3.3 Characterization of microbial communities 

Microbial population was characterized by next-generation sequencing at time 0 (inoculums selected after the 

microbial enrichment described in section 1.1 and that was used in the resistance assays) and in the end of the 

biodegradation assay (day 31) in reactors A (reactor containing lactate) and C (reactor without lactate). All data 

from sequencing related to biodegradation assay are presented in Tables A6 to A8 in Appendix. Figure 12 depicts 

the relative abundance attained in terms of global abundance [(Figure 12(a))] and relative abundance of the 

minority phyla [(Figure 12(b))].

At the initial time (t0), the abundance of the major phyla is similar to the one determined in the reactor D in the 

end of the enrichment, with 91% of Proteobacteria, and 5% of Firmicutes [(Figure 7(a) and Figure 12(a))], which 

was expected. The relative abundances of the major phyla in the reactor containing lactate are slightly more 

similar to the ones that correspond to time 0 than with the reactor without lactate. This higher similarity was 

expected since the composition of the medium in these reactors was not changed. The differences in the microbial 

profile of the inoculum used in this assay and the one attained for the reactor D in the end of the enrichment 

(Figure 7) is probably due to the changes carried out in terms of the withdrawal of the reducing agents from the 

culture medium, as previously described. Figure 12(b) and Figure 13(b) also show that the diversity of the less 

abundant phyla is low.

Figure 13(a) shows that the presence of lactate highly impacts the abundance of some classes present in the 

reactors. At time 0, Proteobacteria phylum is mainly constituted by bacteria from the classes Betaproteobacteria 

(85%) and Alphaproteobacteria (3%), whereas Gammaproteobacteria are the minor class of this phylum (0.1%). 

The predominance of Betaproteobacteria in the presence of lactate is mainly due to Unclassified 

Betaproteobacteria (35%), Diaphorobacter sp. (24%), and Thauera sp. (11%) (Table A7 in Appendix). 

Proteobacteria abundance was influenced by the presence of the extra carbon source (lactate): with lactate, the 

major classes are Betaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria while Gammaproteobacteria is the major class 

when acenaphthene is the only carbon source, although Betaproteobacteria are also present. The most abundant 

Betaproteobacteria in the presence of lactate is Diaphorobacter sp. (21%), which is similar to its abundance in the 

beginning of the assay (24%) and slightly less abundant in the absence of lactate (12%). Commonly, this bacteria 

uses aminoacids (?-alanine and ?-asparagine), yeast extract, peptone and also ethanol, acetate and pyruvate as 

carbon sources (Khan and Hiraishi, 2002). A common supplement used in Diaphorobacter sp. growth is yeast 

extract, which is present in much less quantity than during the enrichment phase and may contribute to the 

decrease in relative abundance relatively to the values indicated above (Khan and Hiraishi, 2002). Diaphorobacter 

sp. has already been reported to use nitroaromatic compounds as sole source of carbon, nitrogen and energy, 

with nitrite release (Singh and Ramanathan, 2013) and, in fact, nitrate is present in the culture medium used in the 

study reported in this thesis. For all these reasons, Diaphorobacter sp. may be involved in acenaphthene 

biodegradation.  

Thauera sp. relative abundances are nearly the same at time 0 and in the reactor with lactate (10% and 8% 

respectively), whereas in the reactor without lactate its relative abundance is 2%. It is known that Thauera sp. 

grows under anaerobiosis with selenate or nitrate as electron acceptor and that one of the carbon sources that it is 

able to use is lactate, which justify the higher relative abundance in the presence of lactate (Macy et al., 1993). 

Since Thauera sp. is more abundant in the presence of lactate, it may also be involved in acenaphthene removal. 

In fact, Thauera sp. is reported as a biodegrader of a lot of alkylbenzenes, as toluene (Meckenstock, Safinowski 

and Griebler, 2004), which metabolic pathway was suggested by Heider et al. (1999).  

Gammaproteobacteria are present only in the reactor without lactate, what is mainly due to relative 

abundance of Unclassified Gammaproteobacteria (31%) and Acinetobacter sp. Bacteria from Acinetobacter genus 

are strictly aerobic (Li et al., 2015), so the only explanation for its presence it is the oxygen production by 

metabolism of anaerobic bacteria (Silva et al., 2013). Furthermore, since Acinetobacter sp. relative abundance 

decreases in the reactor with lactate, probably is not responsible for acenaphthene degradation. 

Firmicutes phylum mainly includes Proteiniclasticum sp. (3%) and Unclassified Firmicutes (3%), and their low 

abundance might be explained by the absence of specific nutrients necessary for their growth (Zhang, Song and 

Dhong, 2010), since their preferred carbon sources are aminoacids instead of lactate or aromatic hydrocarbons 

(Zhang, Song and Dhong, 2010).   

Regarding the minority phyla (Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria), these represent less than 4% of the total 

community. Some Actinobacteria have been described in many petroleum reservoirs worldwide and reported as 

hydrocarbon degraders in aerobiosis (see section 1.3 of discussion) (Silva et al., 2013). Dietzia sp., for instance, 

was isolated from Campos Basin and the enzymes responsible by biodegradation of hydrocarbons presented high 

activity (Silva et al., 2013). However, Streptomyces spp., another Actinobacteria, was detected in an oil Brazilian 

basin, where biodegradation was not observed, suggesting that not all Actinobacteria may be enroled in 

biodegradation of hydrocarbons in oil fields (Silva et al., 2013). Bacteroidetes use yeast extract as carbon source 

(Chen and Dong, 2005) and are widely represented not only in oil reservoirs and coal deposits, being responsible 

by metabolism of its organic acids (Meslé, Dromart and Oger, 2013), but also in wastewater treatment systems, 



28 
 

having a role in fermentation of organic compounds (Silva et al., 2013). Since Bacteroidetes are slightly more 

abundant in the reactor with lactate, this phylum can be involved in acenaphthene biodegradation in some way.  

 

Conclusions and Future work 

In this study, the enrichment of microbial communities from a petrochemical refinery wastewater was 

successfully accomplished, independently of the enrichment strategy followed. Microbial communities were able to 

adapt to acenaphthene and grow when an extra carbon source – glucose or lactate – were added. However, the 

microbial community grew faster in the presence of lactate as well as in the absence of reducing agents. 

Furthermore, the use of lactate led to a higher diversity in the microbial community. The microbial community 

selected as inoculum for resistance and biodegradation assays was mainly constituted by Betaproteobacteria, 

Alphaproteobacteria, Unclassified Firmicutes and Clostridia. Betaproteobacteria were the most abundant, followed 

by Clostridia, Alphaproteobacteria and Unclassified Firmicutes. The main Betaproteobacteria present have been 

reported in refinery wastewaters (Silva et al., 2013) and use nitrate as electron acceptor (Singh and Ramanathan, 

2013).  

It was also shown that acenaphthene can be toxic for bacteria at concentrations from 500 to 1200 µg/L. Since 

acenaphthene is generally present at lower concentrations in refinery wastewaters, its toxicity at such 

concentrations seems not to be a noteworthy problem for bacterial growth. The abiotic controls carried out during 

the studies performed showed that this compound is very unstable and hydrophobic. Therefore, biodegradation 

under the addressed conditions may not be suitable for acenaphthene removal unless residence times are short 

(less than 3 h) in wastewater treatment plants, because it is removed over time even in the abiotic control (27% of 

remotion at the third day of the assay). Furthermore, the maximum percentage of remotion in the presence of 

lactate was hitten at day 2 (61%) and at day 3 (47%) in its absence. Otherwise, other treatment processes that 

could remove acenaphthene faster could be better alternatives since this compound presents high affinity towards 

sediments and particles and, therefore, it is still a threat for the aquatic environment. It can be also concluded that 

biodegradation occurs mainly in the presence of an extra carbon source, either because of the need to produce 

cellular machinery to degrade acenaphthene or because of the need to achieve high cellular density for 

biosorption.  

In further studies, it would be interesting to assess how much the biosorption of acenaphthene contributes for 

its removal, since due to its high hidrophobicity acenaphthene can adsorb to the reactor walls, be degraded by 

bacteria or adsorb to biomass. These studies could also have in consideration the adsorption of acenaphthene to 

other components present in refinery wastewaters, like organic compounds and trace metals.  

Other carbon sources, pH, salinity, temperature, among other important factors impacting biodegradation, 

could be also addressed to improve biodegradation. It could be also interesting to isolate microorganisms from the 

community to understand the individual role of each one in bioremoval as well as to identify the genes and/or 

proteins involved in the biodegradation pathway. Another interesting study would be to analyze acenaphthene 

toxicity along biodegradation. 

The ability of the selected microbial community to remove other micropollutants present in refinery 

wastewaters, particularly compounds that are priority pollutants according to EPA, could also be evaluated.  

Another interesting work would be the evaluation of alternative treatments for acenaphthene removal, that 

could allow overcoming the problems faced during this work in terms of the adsorption and instability of the 

compound.
